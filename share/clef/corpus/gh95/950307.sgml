JEFF Gillooly became infamous around the world as the husband of ice
skater Tonya Harding.
He was sentenced to serve time in a boot camp programme for his part
in the attack on Harding's rival, Nancy Kerrigan.
Gillooly will be released next Monday, but it seems he is reluctant to
walk back into the public glare.
Consequently, he has elected to change his name to Jeff Stone. The
only problem is that one or two Jeff Stones around the US are not too
happy. ''Here's a guy who's a known felon,'' said Jeff Stone, Mayor of
Temecula, California. ''He shouldn't be able to hide behind someone
else's name.''
Baseball player Jeff Stone commented: ''If he's going to change his
name, he should change his face, too, because people are going to
recognise him.''
Gillooly might be forgiven for not taking that advice.
Stone is the man who, asked if he would like a shrimp cocktail before
dinner, answered: ''No thanks. I don't drink.''
On another occasion, after playing baseball in Venezuela, he was asked
if he would be bringing his TV set back to the US.
''Why would I?'' he responded. ''It only gets Spanish stations.''
Gillooly may elect to keep his own name after all.
A HORSE-racing track is no place to be without a slice of luck.
Possibly that's why one unidentified individual works taking bets at
Laurel Park.
The anonymous clerk accepted a wager from a patron wanting to place a
$72 three-way bet that included a 40-1 shot called Nun Bee Wiser.
Unfortunately, instead of producing a $72 ticket, the clerk
inadvertently punched out one for $730.
The punter refused to pay meaning, under the course rules, the clerk
had to accept liability.
Imagine how upset he was . . . until Nun Bee Wiser won and the others
came second and third.
Suddenly that $738 ticket was worth $22,028, all payable to the clerk.
''After winning, he quietly went back to his window and worked through
the rest of his shift,'' said a track spokesman.
NEAL Morton, a reserve on the basketball team at Michigan State
University, is trying not to take things personally. But that may be
difficult.
During a recent match he was sitting on the bench when a stick of
deodorant thrown by a spectator landed at his feet.
Asked what significance it might have, Morton commented sadly: ''Maybe
the fan was trying to tell me I stink.''
INJURED basketball players Derrick Coleman and Sean Higgins of the New
Jersey Nets walked into a situation normally seen only in TV sitcoms.
They arrived at the Meadowlands arena to watch their teammates play
Charlotte Hornets.
Both were wearing black corduroy trousers and identical sweaters from
the same designer.
''They looked like twins,'' commented Butch Beard, coach of the Nets.
Neither was willing to go home and change, and vanity prevented them
sitting under the glare of public scrutiny.
So they resolved the problem by retiring to the changing rooms and
watching the game on TV.
Strange behaviour, but possibly it could have been expected,
especially from Coleman.
Earlier in the season he had offered Beard a blank cheque in
anticipation of all the dress code violations he expected to
accumulating while on the road with the team.

NICOLE Bobek, the colourful and controversial American skater, cruised
into the main competition at the World Figure Skating Championships in
Birmingham yesterday.
The 17-year-old, whose lifestyle has been a constant source of media
attention in the run-up to the championships, won her qualifying group
at the NEC.
It was revealed last week that the American champion had been put on
two-years probation for ''home invasion'' after having been found in the
house of a fellow skater in Detroit without permission.
The sentence should have remained confidential and its leaking led to
unsupported claims that rival camps were attempting to unhinge her world
title challenge.
Bobek put the incident behind her yesterday as she upstaged the
highly-fancied Chinese competitior, Chen Lu, who had to settle for
second place in the qualifying group B.
The pair were forced to compete because only the top 10 from last
year's championships were exempt.
Swindon's Jenna Arrowsmith also progressed to the short programme,
which takes place on Friday, despite not filling one of the 11
qualifying places in group B.
The 14-year-old finished thirteenth after having fallen during her
programme, but she already was assured of a place in the later stages
because Britain is hosting the championships.

DOUGIE Morgan, Scottish rugby coach and chiropodist in Jenners, the
top people's department store in Edinburgh, has his feet planted firmly
on the ground as he savours the prospect of taking his team to
Twickenham for the Grand Slam showdown with England.
Morgan, a former Scotland scrum half and captain, was a member of the
four-man coaching unit which out manoeuvred England when they came to
Murrayfield as Grand Slam favourites in 1990.
Ian McGeechan was in charge then, and there was strategic input, too,
from Morgan, Jim Telfer, and Derrick Grant. Then, as now, England were
the hot tip, and the Scottish hierarchy played the media game to
perfection as they lauded English merits at every opportunity.
Yesterday, with the lessons of 1990 in mind, and in the aftermath of
Scotland's fine win over Wales at Murrayfield, Morgan looked forward to
the task which lies in store on Saturday week at Twickenham.
''I think England will be even bigger favourites than they were five
years ago. They are a better side than they were in 1990. They've been
together for a while now and they've beaten New Zealand and South
Africa. Under their new manager, Jack Rowell, they are a very well
organised outfit. But having said that, you know, this is a one-off
occasion and, from a Scottish viewpoint, we have just kept getting
better with every game this season,'' he said.
''In the days ahead we'll be trying to keep the pressure off the
players. There's still a danger of over-hype, building them up too much.
It's very much a question of striking just the right balance.''
Calm is the word which most perfectly describes Morgan and his
attitude to the criticism which came his way when things weren't going
as planned. Until the fortune-turning encounter against Canada on
January 21, Scotland had gone nine matches without a victory. Since then
they have not lost.
Morgan came under intense pressure during that dark spell. Outwardly
at least he remained unruffled under the straffing fire from media and,
particularly, from recently retired internationalists turned Press
pundits.
The results this season, with the prize of the Grand Slam shootout at
Twickenham, has vindicated his approach.
Yesterday he conceded that the constant barracking had not left him
entirely unscathed. ''I'd be lying if I said that the pressure hadn't
got to me. But having said that I always had belief in what I was trying
to do.
''Those who know me realise what a determined kind of guy I am. Even
when I was a player, in every game and in every situation I was always
looking for the next challenge and I wasn't easily diverted from the
course that I thought was right,'' he said.
Morgan has, indeed, always been his own man. He won 21 Scottish caps
between 1973-78 and played two Tests with the British Lions in New
Zealand in 1977.
During his final season as Scottish captain, he displayed an early
indication of the single-mindedness that he has brought to the Scotland
coaching job. Against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, he spurned a penalty
opportunity to tie the match at 12-12 in favour of a brave but
unsuccessful attempt to run the ball in search of a win. The gambit did
not come off and Ireland were the victors 12-9.
That was an early taste of controversy for Morgan, but it was but a
pin-prick compared to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune which
he has suffered in the Scottish cause since 1993.
Now, though, he can afford to face down his detractors and contemplate
strategy for the Twickenham test ahead.
England have no obvious weaknesses and, in particular, their back row
of Rodber, Clarke and Richards, allied to the beetling strength of
Victor Ubogu, have so often, around the fringes, proved to be the launch
pad for the running skills of Guscott, Carling, the Underwoods et al.
Morgan declares:''Yes, we do expect them to be driving around the
fringes of rucks and mauls. France used to do the same and we devised
strategies to deal with that. Basically if they are coming round the
edges then you have to knock them back to source again. You can't allow
them to gain any momentum.''
The coach is full of praise for the way in which his new-look Scotland
side have buckled down to produce the goods in the past four games. ''We
have always had a good few youngsters around the side and the key to
success is always the performance of the senior players.''
Morgan concurs absolutely with the old coaching adage that the most
difficult area in which to make an impression is on the four inches
above the players' eyes.
''The most difficult area to coach is decision-making. You can talk
about it as much as you like. You can look at the match videos and you
can say well you should have done such and such in a given situation but
the players learn the more they are together in practical situations.''

ABERDEEN'S players have shelved a #5000 per man survival bonus to
concentrate on saving their premier division place. The struggling Dons
have insisted they do not want to talk about cash until their fate is
settled.
Caretaker Manager Roy Aitken revealed yesterday: ''The players
approached me with this proposal and I am happy to go with it. They said
their priority was to concentrate on remaining in the premier division.
This is an indication of their professional pride.
''What they are saying to everyone out there is that they realise the
situation the club is in and are banking on their ability to get out of
trouble.
''Once we retain our place in the league, the bonuses will be paid out
depending on the involvement of each player. This will be done
internally but there is no extra financial incentive.''
If Aberdeen avoid the drop, players who have played in every one of
the nine remaining games will receive #5000.
There is a reduced scale of pay-outs depending on how many games each
man plays, and for substitutes who are used. But any player who does not
feature in the critical last quarter of the season has agreed to forfeit
his bonus.
Aitken added: ''We still have to play every team in the league so
there is ample chance to preserve our status.''
Midfielder Paul Kane, who missed the Celtic match with a calf injury,
will have intensive treatment to have him fit for the basement battle
against Partick Thistle at Firhill. Keeper Theo Snelders will return
after a one-game ban.
But midfielder Ray McKinnon will be forced to sit out three of the
relegation-threatened Pittodrie club's last nine matches of the season
due to suspension.

THE seriousness with which the Scottish rugby hierarchy are treating
the Grand Slam showdown against England was underlined last night with
an announcement from Murrayfield that club teams with players in the
Twickenham squad can apply to have Saturday's league games postponed.
There is a full programme of McEwan's national league matches
scheduled for Saturday but, with Twickenham looming on March 18, the
Scotish Rugby Union -- reflecting the point made by The Herald
columnist, John Beattie, yesterday -- has taken the sensible decision
not to subject the top players to unnecessary risk of injury.
The team for Twickenham will not be chosen until tonight, with an
announcement tomorrow, and the special dispensation includes not just
the XV in the side but also the six replacements.
Despite the fact that the national championship was won by Stirling
County 10 days ago, there still is a lot to play for with mid-table
clubs battling for the crucial top-eight placing that will ensure they
are in the new Premier Division 1 next season.
For instance, Gala and Heriot's FP, in seventh and eight spots in the
table, still have one or two points to harvest before they can consider
themselves safe.
Gala play second-bottom Currie at Netherdale and may well feel that
they can do without the services of Gregor Townsend, but Heriot's,
playing champions Stirling, might well seek a postponement in view of
Kenny Milne's certain inclusion in the Twickenham side, and Cameron
Glasgow's probable continuing role as a replacement.
The SRU have said that if clubs wished to postpone their matches then
they should seek dispensation from Murrayfield and it would be given.
Postponed matches have to be played by April 7, and for any
international players affected by such postponements, the Rugby World
Cup playing cut-off date will be extended from March 31 to that date.

NO sooner had Gary Jacobs left America to return home yesterday than
the sniping started about his credentials to challenge Pernell Whitaker
for the World Boxing Council welterweight championship.
Jacobs, who fought for most of his bout against Jose Miguel Fernandez
in Atlantic City at the weekend with a horrendous injury to his right
hand, which required five stitches, is now set to meet Whitaker -- now
regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world -- but already
the Scot is under attack.
His biggest critic is John Shields, Whitaker's new trainer, who guided
the American to an impressive win over World Boxing Association
light-middleweight champion Julio Cesar Vasquez on the same bill.
Said Shields: ''Jacobs is not my idea of a world-class welterweight,
but he is the mandatory challenger, and that's what is wrong with
mandatories.
''The idea of mandatory challenges was to make sure champions could
not duck legitimate contenders. In practice, however, it often produces
mismatches. Jacobs does not belong in the same ring as Whitaker.''
There is no doubting the ability of Shields as a boxing trainer, and,
indeed, Whitaker paid him high tribute at the weekend. But Shields did
not even take the trouble to find out why the Glaswegian was below par
in Atlantic City.
Jacobs had five stitches inserted in his hand wound, which was also
infected, yet he still won every round on two of the judges cards.
''It will suit me if they underestimate me,'' said Jacobs, who is
happy and relieved that his injury should not halt his world title bid.
He added: ''The doctor who treated me has assured me that the wound
will heal completely and that I shouldn't have further trouble with
it.''
Shields, however, feels that Whitaker would be better employed in a
fight against the WBA champion Ike Quartey, of Ghana, who was also in
action in Atlantic City, giving an awesome punching display against
South Korea's Jung-Oh Park.
Shields also would like his man to have a rematch against the
legendary Julio Cesar Chavez, the world light-welter champion.
They met in September, 1993, when Whitaker put his title on the line
against the then unbeaten Chavez. The result was a majority draw, two
judges scoring the contest even, the other going for Whitaker. Chavez
has not been interested in a return.
Said Shields: ''If it was up to me, the first guy Pernell would fight
is Chavez, second Quartery, and third Felix Trinidad, the IBF
(International Boxing Federation) champion. Fourth ? Fourth would be
retirement.''
Despite all that, Jacobs is No.1 challenger and must be given his
chance in the summer.
Incidentally, a spectator at the weekend action in America was
Wilfredo Vasquez, the WBA super-bantamweight champion whom Sheffield's
Naseem Hamed wants to fight.

THE former Liverpool and Rangers manager, Mr Graeme Souness, yesterday
dismissed fresh claims about alleged irregularities in transfer deals
involving overseas players.
His lawyers described the new allegations as ''completely untrue'',
and said they would start libel proceedings immediately.
The lawyers were responding to a report published in the Today
newspaper which claimed that Liverpool FC had paid #550,000 for Danish
star Torben Piechnik in 1992, but that Copenhagen FC had said it had
received only #250,000.
Souness, who left the Anfield club early last year, could not be
contacted for comment yesterday. It is understood he is in Australia.
However, his London lawyers said in a statement issued on his behalf:
''Certain serious allegations have been published about Mr Graeme
Souness in today's edition of the Today newspaper. These allegations are
completely untrue.''
The legal firm, Lipkin Gorman of Mayfair, added: ''Libel proceedings
will be issued immediately against this newspaper and against any other
newspapers or broadcasting organisations which repeat the allegations,
either explicitly or implicitly.''
The lawyers later confirmed that a writ for damages for libel had been
issued against News (UK) Ltd, the publishers of Today.
Mr Gerard Cukier, one of the partners in the law firm, told The Herald
that Mr Souness was abroad and could not be contacted for comment. He
was expected back in Britain some time in the next two weeks.
In December last year, the lawyers issued a similar warning after
another newspaper, the Mail on Sunday, published allegations that Mr
Souness had received payments from an Israeli football agent as part of
transfer deals involving overseas players.
One of those alleged payments was claimed to have been made in
September, 1988, during his five-year spell at Ibrox.
Mr Cukier yesterday confirmed that a libel writ had been served on the
Mail on Sunday, its editor, and two of its reporters following
publication of that story. The matter was progressing towards a trial,
he added.
The Mail on Sunday's allegations were dismissed at the time by Rangers
FC vice-chairman Donald Findlay, one of Scotland's leading QCs, who said
that the club did not do business that way.
Yesterday, Mr Findlay repeated his support for the former Rangers
manager. He said: ''In Graeme Souness's time at Ibrox we had no reason
to suspect any irregularities, and the Rangers books are there and
open.''
He added that he would be ''astonished'' if the new allegations were
true. ''He always struck me as being as straight as they come and as
hard as they come, in equal measure.''
The English Premier League has already said that it is investigating
all transfers involving overseas players and the league's clubs, in the
wake of its commission of inquiry into claims against George Graham.
Graham was dismissed as manager of Arsenal last month as a result of
an investigation by the commission which focused on an allegation that
he had accepted almost #300,000 as part of the transfer of Danish
internationalist John Jensen.
Asked about the allegations published yesterday about the Piechnik
transfer to Liverpool, a Premier League spokesman said: ''I can confirm
that this transfer is under investigation, as are all foreign transfers.
''We have made it perfectly clear that every foreign transfer dating
from 1992 is being investigated by the commission of inquiry. That is
ongoing.''
He could not say whether the commission had already spoken to Mr
Souness, nor could he say when the commission might complete its work.
He added: ''It is a thorough and vigorous inquiry. We will not be rushed
into anything.''
A spokeswoman for Liverpool FC  said yesterday that the club was not
making any comment on the claims made in Today.
Mr Jim Farry, chief executive of the Scottish Football Association,
also declined to comment on the latest allegations against Mr Souness,
saying such matters would come under the jurisdiction of the English
football authorities.
Asked if the SFA was planning to take any action regarding the earlier
allegations, he replied: ''I am unaware of any allegations against Mr
Souness in his employ with Rangers FC.''

TOMMY Burns has made it clear that he will place his imprint on the
Celtic team -- no matter how many egos may be bruised in the process.
Last month the manager stunned Scottish football by dropping club
captain Paul McStay. On Sunday he followed that by axeing John Collins.
Yesterday Burns was treating the affair as a matter of managerial
decision making. No matter how big the name, it is clear that at
Parkhead these days, no one is safe unless he is proving that he
deserves to be in the first team.
''It was an easy enough choice to make,'' said Burns. ''I am not going
to spend my time worrying over this type of decision. I am not going to
lose any sleep over them. I am the manager and if there are any
difficult selection problems then I shall deal with them.
''Paul McStay accepted it in the right way. Sure he was hurt and then
he was angry and then he wanted to show that he could still do a job.
That was the attitude of the perfect pro and I was delighted that I was
able to bring him back against Aberdeen on Sunday.
''John has accepted it the same way. I did not think that he was at
his best over the past few weeks in the centre of midfield, and so I
pushed Paul back in there.
''I had a full discussion with John this morning and at the team talk
he put in his tuppence worth and as a good professional I expect him to
accept the situation.
''I make any decisions for the good of Celtic Football Club. Not for
individuals.''
Burns believes that there is room for ALL of his international
midfield players in the first team. When asked if Collins, McStay, and
Phil O'Donnell could play together, Burns insisted that they could.
''There is no problem about that, ''he said. ''But they all have to be
playing well. That is what all this is about. We want to have players
who are performing at their best week after week.
''If that is not happening and we have to make changes then that is
the name of the game. I won't hesitate if I think a change will benefit
the team.''
At Ibrox, Rangers are ready to invite Maltese internationalist keeper
Davie Cluett back for a second training spell. The 6ft 4in. keeper who
has been capped 60 times has already spent a week in Glasgow.
Now Rangers may join other interested clubs to watch him in action
against Holland in Amsterdam next week. After that they could bring him
back for a further trial period.
On the presumption that the Partick Thistle game against Dundee United
at Firhill goes ahead tonight -- which is a bit like backing Norman
Lamont to be European of the year -- there could be a remarkable
scenario in the premier division if the Maryhill team win. Should that
happen the league would then have six teams from the bottom up separated
by only eight points.
In a league where three points are awarded for a win, that represents
a difference of two wins and two draws between the relegation
favourites, and sides still chasing a European place. Hearts,
Kilmarnock, Dundee United, Falkirk, Aberdeen, and Thistle would then
have to be considered under some kind of threat of demotion.
The Firhill team, who trail the rest of the league by five points,
could produce a concertina effect if they overcame a United side which
would be eminently beatable if in the same form as they showed at
Kilmarnock on Saturday.
The chances of the game going ahead are officially good, even if it
has been postponed five times already. On all of those occasions the
reason was flooding and that has persuaded the Thistle chairman, Jim
Oliver, to invest in coverings which were in place yesterday morning.
The snowstorm which forced the abandonment of the game with Hearts on
Saturday has to be considered freakish, if there is such a thing when
used in a Firhill context, and icy conditions should be beaten by the
under-soil blanket.
The possibility that a monsoon, backed by Hurricane Molly, could still
intervene has to be conceded but, all being well, United will make their
way to the stadium in Glasgow determined to make amends for a dreary
show at Rugby Park.
''That was our first bad performance since we lost to Hearts two
months ago,m'' said United manager Ivan Golac, ''and we are desperate to
get back into action as soon as possible.
''Conditions at Kilmarnock were against football but it was still a
disappointment and we want to make up for that before we meet Hearts at
the weekend in the Scottish Cup.''
But Golac continues to dismiss any suggestion of a relegation threat
hanging over his team. ''If we win our game in hand we are only three
points behind Hibs,'' he claimed.
Tranmere Rovers, whose manager, Johnny King, watched United defender
Brian Welsh on Saturday, have not lost interest in the player, even
although King did not believe he had a good game against Kilmarnock. But
even if he makes a bid it is unlikely that Golac, who thinks highly of
Welsh, would be persuaded to let him go.
Thistle defender Alan Dinnie is suspended and four other players are
doubtful, Rod McDonald, Callum Milne, Alex Taylor, and Albert Craig.
Motherwell can consolidate their position in second spot if they beat
Falkirk in the game postponed from Saturday, but there will be three
very determined opponents in the other side.
Paul McGrillen and Steve Kirk, two Fir Park men transferred to
Brockville recently, and striker Maurice Johnston, bought from Hearts
last week, will be keen to help their new team-mates in the bid to move
out of the demotion zone.

ONE of the coaches sacked by GHK yesterday launched a stinging attack
on what he sees as the ''panic'' that has beset the Glasgow club.
Brian Gilbert also hit out at what he described as the lack of
application he has had to suffer from the players during his time in
charge.
The other GHK coach, Hugh Hamilton, was also dismissed and fitness
coach Bob Tomlinson resigned.
Gilbert said: ''As everyone knows, it's the players who get the credit
and the coaches who get the blame.
''All GHK's recent coaches have had the same problem. Nairn McEwan and
Ian Russell both told me what a hard job it was -- GHK have had seven
different coaches in the last seven years.
''GHK have a habit of sacking their coaches. Yet, if I look at my
recent record, I see that we have lost only nine of our last 55, and the
second fifteen is third in the Inter City League.
''Hugh and I have been made scapegoats.''
Club president, Ian Litster, said: ''Recent performances have been
disappointing.
''It is a collective responsibility, and the players are happy to
accept that over the next two games. It is critical that the team is
successful in these.''
Gilbert said the club has panicked as GHK lie ninth in the table and
could be in the second division next year.
''The committee and players expect to be in the top eight, and they
are terrified because they are not.
''Only once in our history have GHK been in the top eight, yet because
this is the season of league reconstruction, they have definitely
panicked.''
''The attitude has been all wrong, and I find it all difficult to
understand and forgive.
''The team's approach to the head-to-head with Gala recently, was, for
example, unacceptable. In comparison to the Borderers, we capitulated.''
Gilbert went on to say that some of his outbursts, both public and
private, were responsible for the club's action.
''Hugh and I upset some people with some plain speaking,'' he said.
''Now it's payback time. There has been pressure from a small cabal of
high-profile players, some of whom have been dropped in the past, and
they have forced the issue.
''I have received countless phone calls of support. I feel very sorry
for Walter Malcolm, a man of integrity, that this should happen in the
last month of the league season, and maybe his career. He does not
deserve it.''
Malcolm, the club captain who dropped himself for the last league game
and is understood to be carrying out the main coaching duties, said:
''As far as I am concerned it is history. We now must focus on our next
two league games, against Stewarts Melville and Stirling County.''

LINFORD Christie gave up his chance to win the only major athletics
title that has eluded him yesterday when he withdrew from Britain's team
for the World Indoor Championships, which begin in Barcelona on Friday.
The Olympic and world sprint champion's decision not to run the 60
metres is a significant blow to the British team, but an even bigger one
to the world governing body, the International Amateur Athletic
Federation. Their first event of 1995 -- which president Primo Nebiolo
has designated the ''Year of Athletics'' -- now looks increasingly
devalued.
Christie pleaded tiredness ''from the indoor races I have already run
this season following my return from Australia.'' He has raced 18 times
this winter. He told the British Athletic Federation he was not prepared
to risk the schedule of three races in one day, fearing he would be
''putting myself at risk of injury for what is going to be a very
important outdoor season.''
Yet in a conspicuously chauvinistic press conference just minutes
after defeat by fellow Briton Darren Braithwaite in Birmingham 10 days
ago, Christie announced he had decided to run in Spain.
Though a further defeat, in Stockholm a week past Monday, prompted him
to voice doubts to national coach Malcom Arnold, it was only after
Christie spoke on German TV that the BAF learned yesterday that the
British team captain would not be running. Neither his coach nor the UK
team manager knew anything about it.
His decision forced the BAF to eat a large helping of humble pie and
provoked outraged comment from the IAAF.
When Christie raced in Birmingham a week past Saturday, it was on a
programme rescheduled without the knowledge of one of the participants,
Mike Rosswess, who had looked certain to go to Spain. Rosswess missed
the race, and with Christie saying he wished to run, and Braithwaite
beating Christie, it relegated Rosswess to the reserve berth.
Yesterday the BAF had to plead with Rosswess to come back into the
fold.
Rosswess, from Handsworth, had been told he would not be paid as he
had not run in Birmingham ''even though it was no fault of my own. I
have been shabbily treated.''
Fortunately, in the interim, the BAF were persuaded of the moral
justice of Rosswess's case, and paid the money -- a timely gesture, and
not just on public relations grounds.
Mike Oluban, Rosswess's coach, said last night that in the past few
days Rosswess had lost two sponsorship contracts. ''One was a clothing
deal, and the other had given him the use of a car for the past three
years,'' said Oluban. ''It has been a devastating two weeks for Mike.
''He was in the shape of his life for that race, but what happened
completely upset him. He has taken a few days off, and that's not the
best preparation for a world championship.''
Oluban once worked as a male stripper to feed and clothe his protege
-- he could not afford running spikes, and raced in an old pair held
together with superglue. Now he is running on a shoestring again, but
Oluban believes that three-times European indoor bronze medallist
Rosswess ''still might surprise a few people. There is a lot of anger
there, a lot of aggression, and I think he will do something very
special this year.''
There is also anger at IAAF headquarters in Monaco. Only 48 hours
earlier press chief Chris Winner had spoken of Christie in glowing
terms: ''With the star quality and moral authority he brings to the
sport . . . his presence is absolutely priceless.''
Last night, on hearing of Christie's defection, Winner said: ''He has
damaged the quality of the competition and the credibility of the sport.
It is disappointing and disheartening -- not befitting a champion.''

AYR United manager Simon Stainrod yesterday called for a winter
shutdown, and summer football for Scotland.
He was preparing to lead his side, weather permitting, into tonight's
important match at Clydebank that could go some way to deciding the
relegation outcome in the first division.
Said Stainrod: ''I can't believe we still play in this weather. We
should be involved in pre-season training and taking players to
somewhere warmer.
''We should be looking forward to the season starting in two weeks'
time and running through until November.
''It is incredible that people want to play and to watch in the winter
conditions. We spend our week in creative coaching, but then have to hit
the ball into space and run.''
Ayr are still without injured Sammy McGivern, John Traynor, and Vinnie
Moore. Suspended Scott Murdoch and injured Craig Flannigan miss out for
the Bankies.
Finns Janne Lindberg and Marko Rajamaki are on international duty in
the Czech Republic, which has given Morton problems for tonight's
second-division clash with Clyde.
Craig McPherson and John Fowler come in against a Clyde side still
hoping striker George McCluskey will be fit.
Stenhousemuir's new full back, Gordon Russell, is standing by for his
debut as they meet Berwick.Manager Terry Christie said: ''We have to put
Saturday's Scottish Cup-tie against Hibs out of our minds. This is yet
another important match with a bearing on promotion.''
Berwick are still without injured John Gallagher and Paul Rutherford.
AlbionRovers' midfielder Darren Riley will be on the bench . . . as
substitute keeper when Rovers visit East Stirlingshire. Alan Davidson
was sent off on Saturday, and reserve keeper John Wight comes in.

WALES are on course to stage the 1999 World Cup final after having
made concessions to Scotland, France, and Ireland in order to stave off
Australia's bid for the tournament.
This time last week, Wales and England -- the main hosts -- appeared
to be isolated. But vigorous lobbying among the other European nations
by Vernon Pugh, chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union, probably has
collected 10 of the 11 votes out of 20 required to win the approval this
week of the International Board, of which Pugh also is chairman.
The final vote should come from either Italy or Argentina. Italy seem
sure to go along with France, but England have done plenty of favours to
Argentinian and Italian rugby recently, and it might be time to call in
a few of them.
Pugh met delegates from the three wavering countries last week, and
has promised Ireland and Scotland more matches as well as inviting
France to stage some fixtures.
So the tournament -- if the vote at the start of next week goes to
Wales -- will be similar to the 1991 event, with the matches being
spread over five countries, or six if a game is played in Belfast.
Irish Rugby Union president Ken Reid, who called the four-nations'
meeting that followed Pugh's lobbying trip to France, said: ''We are
very hopeful that the World Cup will be held in the northern
hemisphere.''
The Irish and Scots were dismayed at being given only their own
matches in their pools, plus a quarter-final, when the original Welsh
bid was revealed. But it is believed that all matches in the pools
involving Ireland and Scotland would now be played in those countries.
France are late entrants to the equation and their trade-off for
supporting the Welsh bid is the support of the British and Irish for
their own bid for the year 2003.
The southern hemisphere will not like two successive events in the
north, but Ireland's view is that two out of every three World Cup
tournaments should be played in Europe.
With an expected 20 countries entering in 1999 instead of 16 in the
first three World Cups, there are more matches to distribute -- 48
instead of 32 -- although there is a suggestion that there will be five
pools of four instead of four pools of five, creating even more
fixtures.
In future World Cups, seeding will be severely restricted and nations
that have a say in the venue of the tournament are wise to give
themselves the best chance of qualifying automatically for the next
event.
The IB, who meet in Bristol all this week, will debate the matter on
Saturday, with their council reaching a verdict at the start of next
week.

SCOTLAND captain Gavin Hastings was described yesterday as
''majestic'' by the man who is plotting to shatter his Grand Slam dream
on Saturday week.
England manager's Jack Rowell watched with admiration as Hastings
masterminded the 26-13 victory over Wales on Saturday to set up a
winner-takes-all confrontation with England at Twickenham on March 18.
And Rowell enthused: ''Hastings is a man in a man's world. He is
majestic.
''It is a measure of him that he has come back even stronger as
leader, player, and man after the recent run of poor Scottish results
and the criticism he received as a consequence.''
Rowell also admitted that he took a measure of personal satisfaction
from Scotland's success after having watched two of his former charges
at Bath play starring roles.
He said: ''The Scotland win gave me personal pleasure because not only
did Dave Hilton and Eric Peters score the tries, but they also looked
the part in the international arena.
''They came to Bath in my later period there as coach and, though they
did not break into the first-team regularly, I am certain the Bath
influence has helped them get where they are.''
Rowell, chasing a Grand Slam title in his first season in charge of
England, knows his men will face a tough task against a Scotland side
rejuvenated by their Five Nations successes this season.
''The Scottish team are very impressive,'' he said. ''They are on a
roll, like England, and the performance is greater than the sum of the
parts. They are a collective and are in the job together. They look
sharp and know what they are doing.
''They kick and chase better than anyone, but they are using their
backs effectively and I believe that the pack is playing as well as ever
-- better than 1990.''
Meanwhile, England continue their preparations for the showdown with a
squad training session at Marlow tomorrow night.
And they will also take advantage of a gap in the Courage League
programme this weekend to further formulate the plan which they hope
will bring heartbreak for Scotland.

SCOTTISH cricket officials have been amazed by the response to their
search for the sport's first development officer. The Glasgow-based job,
which will involve encouraging schools cricket throughout the west of
Scotland, was advertised for the first time last Friday.
SCU general manager Alex Ritchie said: ''Our office fielded 16
applications within 24 hours of the advert being published. It's an
amazing response.''
The SCU last year published a Development Plan in the wake of its
successful bid for Associate Membership of the International Cricket
Council (ICC), and they intend creating similar posts. Ritchie added:
''This is just the beginning. In time, we want another three officers
operating thoughout the country.''

Airdrie 1, Raith Rovers 2
RANGERS last night stepped up their interest in Raith Rovers striker
Steve Crawford.
Manager Walter Smith and assistant Archie Knox watched the 21-year-old
in last night's first-division match against promotion rivals Airdrie.
Crawford, who has hit 11 goals this season, was one of the Kirkcaldy
side's successes. He and Colin Cameron provided a constant threat as
Jimmy Nicholl's men extended their unbeaten run to 12 games.
Raith are now in joint top spot with Dundee.
However, as a rehearsal for Saturday's Tennents Scottish Cup
quarter-final at Stark's Park, the match only occasionally aroused the
1726 Broadwood crowd.
It took 63 minutes for the stalemate to be broken. Steve Cooper
brilliantly controlled the ball with his chest before sending a shot
past Scott Thomson.
Raith equalised six minutes later, Jason Dair scoring in a goalmouth
scramble. Then Ally Graham grabbed the winner with a looping header from
a Stephen McAnespie cross nine minutes from time.
Airdrie fought in vain for an equaliser and the closest they came was
when a powerful effort from John Davies was blocked by Shaun Dennis.
Three Raith players were booked -- Cameron and the scorers, Dair and
Graham.
AIRDRIE -- Martin, Stewart, Jack, Sandison, T McIntyre, Black, Boyle,
Davies, Cooper, A Smith, Lawrence. Substitutes -- T Smith, J McIntyre,
McCulloch.
RAITH ROVERS -- Thomson, McAnespie, Rowbottom, Lennon, Dennis,
Sinclair, Wilson, Cameron, Graham, Crawford, Dair. Substitutes --
Dalziel, Broddle, Allan.
Referee -- T Brown (Edinburgh).

AUSTRALIA'S coach, Bob Dwyer, said yesterday he felt entitled to
payment for his off-field duties, bringing him in line with senior
players.
He said he had no objection to players earning huge sums as a result
of their involvement with the game. ''The coach works under exactly the
same rules as the players concerning professionalism,'' he said.
Dwyer, who must re-apply for his honorary position after Australia's
World Cup defence in South Africa in May and June, said he expected the
issue to be covered in any future agreement with the Australian Rugby
Union (ARU).
''I would be looking for an addition to it (his agreement as coach),''
Dwyer said. ''Quite frankly, I just assume it will happen.''
His comments follow a move by the ARU to place senior players on
annual contracts reportedly worth up to A$80,000 ($60,000). In return
for the guaranteed income, the players must be available to promote and
endorse rugby union's major sponsors.
Asked whether he had any objections, in theory, to players being paid
four or five times the amount currently on offer, Dwyer replied: ''I
have no problem with that.''

AMID the justified euphoria over Scotland's unexpected position of
eminence in the Five Nations' Championship their coaches, Douglas Morgan
and Ritchie Dixon, will be aware of the need for improvement in certain
areas, especially defence, if English aspiration is to be torpedoed at
Twickenham on March 18.
It has to be of some concern that, even on much shorter rations of
subsequent phase ball, the Welsh made a number of alarming incisions
that, with better support and fortune, might have set Scotland a tougher
examination.
The method by which Wales created that shock early try will be given
close Scottish study because if Emyr Lewis can make such a dent in the
Scottish defence, heaven knows what damage Ben Clarke and Tim Rodber
might inflict.
It is towards coping with those big, withdrawn, loose forwards, who
take up position in midfield, that attention must be directed. It is
there that first tackles assume special importance, and they should be
made by Scottish loose forwards so that their backs are spared such
onerous duty so as not to leave a gap like the Mersey Tunnel.
The Welsh posed most threat off lineout ball because speedy delivery
afforded them extra space and time in which to give their ploy momentum.
England are well off all along their lineout. Such quality delivery
enabled Lewis to latch on to that short feed from Nigel Davies at a rare
old lick. He is not known as ''the bull'' for nothing and by the time
Craig Chalmers and Kenny Logan had arrested him, the damage was
irretrievable. Scotland's flankers were alive to the danger.
Defenders have to be so focused because there are other options open
to the attack side. Davies could have fed Hemi Taylor on the inside
instead of Lewis on the outside. Then, having used that Lewis charge,
Wales went through a similar drill soon after but this time, Jenkins
sent a miss-pass wide to Michael Hall, whose dummy and pace change
threatened a score. Fortunately for Scotland Gregor Townsend stayed out
to shadow the Welsh fullback, thus cutting off Hall's link and forcing
him to veer inwards where he was nailed by Eric Peters.
Robert Jones twice exposed Scottish defence frailty. He found his way
clear up the West Stand side line because Bryan Redpath had entered the
lineout maul in order to stop the Welsh hooker's advance. Later, when
Jones took off between Rob Wainwright and Peter Wright from a tap
offence kick, it was as well for Scotland that the break was made far
out on the Welsh 22 and that the only immediate support came from
flanker Ritchie Collins.
This surely was a case of the Scots momentarily losing concentration
or expecting a clearance punt so that early arrest was not achieved. It
won't have been lost on Scotland's coaches that England, too, have a
cocky, aggressive, quick scrum half in Kieran Bracken who takes offence
kicks quick and who has a nose for a break.
It was encouraging not only to see Craig Joiner cut off supply to
Wayne Proctor as the Scots coped pretty well with Ieuan Evans turning up
on the other flank, but also to note that Logan and Townsend had Evans
in their sights after Neil Jenkins, for once, had broken out of the
Chalmers' grasp.
Scotland is fortunate in the musketeers attitude of one for all and
all for one towards chopping chores and in the mobility of their
forwards that enabled them to achieve notable feats in retreat cover.
But concentration levels must be kept at peak and the earlier the
English are knocked over the better.

THE number of pasteurising dairies in Scotland could fall from the
present total of 135 to ''a mere handful'', as a result of deregulation,
says Dr Donald McQueen chief executive of the Scottish Dairy Trade
Federation.
Internal predictions within the federation suggested that the number
would be down to less than 50 within the next five years, Dr McQueen
told a conference in Edinburgh organised by chartered surveyors D M Hall
&amp; Son. The time-scale for subsequent decline was more difficult to
judge, he said.
''It will certainly mean lower unit processing costs -- but also
higher distribution costs.''
Despite the dismantling of the old milk marketing board system the
industry was still substantially organised in two opposing camps, he
said. One consequence of that was a preoccupation with short-term price
levels and how to get the biggest possible share of the cake -- too
often at the expense of considerations about how the cake might be made
a little bigger and richer.
Dr McQueen forecast that when contracts in England and Wales were set
for the next marketing year, starting in November, there would be a
reduction in average prices. This would set the tone for the entire UK
industry.
There were few observers who believed that the present milk prices
could be sustained beyond the 1994-95 contract period, he said. A number
of UK milk products had already become relatively expensive on the
retail market and continental suppliers had gained market share in the
UK in recent months. ''Those tempted to bask in the warmth of recent
milk price increases should ponder these realities,'' he said.
In his view the recent sharp increase in first-hand prices was almost
bound to be re-adjusted within the next year to a level which was more
acceptable internationally. Further ahead it was the international
market itself which would determine the fate of all those involved in
the dairy industry.
On the internal UK market, he said, the most conspicuous early effect
of the implementation of the Gatt agreement would come from a planned
50% increase in the volume of New Zealand butter imports.
''The New Zealanders are showing determination to make the fullest
possible use of this increased opportunity which becomes available in
July. It will bring their share of the UK market to a remarkable 60% --
far above the share in the pre-EEC days of Commonwealth preference. My
federation, along with our colleagues in England, is working hard in
Europe at the present time to have this deal re-negotiated but there is
little sympathy from our major European partners who still see it,
irrationally, as a particularly British issue,'' he said.
Because of Gatt pressures all milk markets would come under increasing
pressures, he said. Where markets were lost there would be a shift to
production of butter and skimmed milk powder, for which intervention
support existed. In such a situation the tendency then was for Brussels
to reduce support prices and impose further quota cuts.
The European Commission had already proposed a 2% cut in the butter
intervention price, he said. ''I predict that the first quota cut will
be imposed in April next year, probably also 2%.''
For the future, he suggested, there was a need for co-ordinated and
collective initiatives within the dairy industry. The interests of dairy
farmers and of milk processors were inextricably linked. ''Sixty years
of statutory milk marketing drove them apart and placed thm face to face
instead of shoulder to shoulder. We need to change all that.''

MARIA Hjorth's mentors in Scotland are far from surprised at the
21-year-old Swede's weekend triumph in the Spanish Amateur championship
at Las Brisas.
Before she arrived with compatriot Anna Berg in 1993 as Stirling
University's first international golf scholarship students, Hjorth had
played for Sweden and had a string of successes behind her.
These included one on the Swedish Women's Tour in a field containing
professionals, an indication that she is well capable of following
illustrious countrywomen Lisalotte Neumann, Helen Alfredsson, Catrin
Nilsmark, and Annika Sorenstam as a Solheim Cup player.
Ian Thomson, the university's sports bursaries co-ordinator, does not
underestimate the Spanish triumph.
''This is the tournament that always starts the season. The Scottish
team were over there, too. This success is superb,'' he said.
What pleases Thomson even more is the way the Swedes are helping to
promote Scottish universities as an attractive alternative to the
American collegiate system, where hoards of Scotland's finest have gone
over the last decade.
Among the current batch are internationalists Mhari McKay and Janice
Moodie, respectively at Stanford and San Jose State universities,
California.
However, seven Scottish universities now offer golf scholarships. This
year more than 40 students are benefitting with annual funding of #1250
each, mainly from the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, who aim eventually to
make awards to a total of 64.
Thomson, who sparked the movement in a conversation with R &amp; A
secretary Michael Bonallack 15 years ago, said:
''In my opinion, golf scholarships in Scotland are better than
anything in the world for quality of degree and standard of courses and
coaching. ''That may sound an exaggeration, but I have seen what is on
offer at several of the best American universities.
''What are called golf coaches there are rarely technical teaching
professionals. They are usually managers who arrange fixtures and money.
''Moreover, since we began our programme at Stirling we have had
several students who have come here after one year in America, convinced
there was not enough emphasis on academic work.''
He conceded that the weather in America is much better, but at
Stirling the 11 golf scholars -- six women and five men -- have a par 3
course on campus and a good practice facility under construction.
They also have membership at Stirling Golf Club and regular access to
John Chillas, the professional at Glenbervie with whom the students
spent a week in Tunisia in January.
Like the other Scottish universities, there are no academic
concessions except that at Stirling an extra year is allowed to complete
degrees.
Thomson persuaded the two Swedish girls to try Scotland instead of the
US on a study visit as guest of the Swedish Golf Federation.
They were based at a golf school in Malmo, one of two of its kind in
the country, and he has been delighted at their contribution at
Stirling, where they are taking a three-year course in English.
''They are tremendously hard workers, fit and disciplined,'' Thomson
said. ''The spin-off in the experience they give the others is terrific,
and this is the principal benefit.''
The Swedish women's team visits Scotland next month to play in the
Helen Holm Trophy at Troon.
Manager Pia Nilsson has promised to speak to the class of '95 which
includes Scot Valerie Melvin, runner-up to Katrina Mathew, a former
Stirling burser, in the Scottish Amateur last year, plus two from
England and one from Ireland.
Leading light among the men is Kilmarnock Barassie's Gordon Sherry.
Thomson regards him as the best male golfer ever at the university,
and proof that talent can be developed in this country. The others are
Scots Steven Carmichael, Russell Thornton, and Stuart Roberts, and
Welshman Stuart Austerberry.

has a skilled workforce to service the increasing quantities of timber
which will be coming on the market over the next 10 years.
''Forestry is one of the rural industries that can truly look forward
to the future with confidence,'' said Sir Hector. ''We know that timber
can find a ready market.
''We need to ensure that we will have the right people with the right
skills to take full advantage of this developing opportunity. Dumfries
and Galloway alone produces 500,000 cubic metres of timber a year, and
this is set to double by the end of the century.
''Forests cover a quarter of the land area, a figure twice that for
Scotland as a whole. The region has a turnover of wood products
estimated to be worth over #60m a year. From planting through to
harvesting, and in the processing industry, there are some 2000 jobs
directly dependent on forestry in the region.''
Sir Hector said that the Forestry Contracting Association and Dumfries
and Galloway Enterprise were undertaking a joint initiative to ensure
that there was proper provision of training for the skills the industry
required.
Robert Hay, chairman of the association, said that its aim was to
improve the training of contractors at all levels, in the specialist
skills of forestry and in the skills that were required to run small
businesses.
The first training undertaken in forestry skills last year had been in
chainsaw training and attracted 90 people, initially in Galloway. The
training expanded throughout the whole region and was also extended to
reflect the move to greater mechanisation within the industry.
The latest courses will offer practical training in work methods,
felling practices, measurement and tariffing. They will also cover
business management -- starting with basic computing -- risk assessment
and first aid. The final components will be the use of harvesting
machinery and improved work practices.
Funding for this year will be #40,000, of which #17,000 will come from
the enterprise company. The businesses themselves will put up #9000 and
#14,000 will come from the European Social Fund.
The full-time training co-ordinator for the initiative will be Graeme
Hodgson.
FCA operations manager Barry Hudson said that similar initiatives were
up and running in Tayside, Forth Valley, Borders, Grampian, Moray,
Badenoch and Strathspey. The lead in Scotland had come from the local
enterprise companies, he said.

WHILE Peter Nicol has earned the nickname ''Nugget'' following his
money-spinning rise up the world squash rankings, fellow-Scot Martin
Heath goes into today's #30,000 Portuguese Open struggling to finance
his appearances on the circuit.
The 21-year-old from Oban has climbed to No.38 in the world but
admits: ''Since moving to London at the start of the season, I have
really struggled financially.
''There are tournaments in Bermuda and America coming up on the
schedule, but I don't think I will be able to afford to go. At the
moment, I'm making a loss.''
In his biggest event to date, Heath meets Tony Hands in today's first
round and, in addition to the prize money, another incentive to beat the
English internationalist is the prospect of a second-round clash with
Nicol.
''I was unlucky to lose 3-2 to Tony in a recent league match, so I'm
hopeful that I can reverse that result,'' said Heath.
Nicol, the No.4 seed, opens against a qualifier, and he is confident
of repeating last year's performance by reaching his appointed
semi-final place, and a probable meeting with world No.1 Jansher Khan.
There has been a three-month break in the world-ranking schedule, and
the 21-year-old Scottish champion admits he is desperate to get back
into action. ''It's difficult to get keyed up for league matches.
''But I've got a good draw this week, and I'm really looking forward
to it. The prospect of a semi-final with Jansher is the perfect
incentive.''
Khan is the defending champion, while England's world No.2 Peter
Marshall, the 1993 winner, is expected to reach the final.

CHRISTIAN Salvesen yesterday announced the #63.5m sale of its brick
operations to a venture capital company, as it continues to focus on
international distribution and specialist hire.
Announcing the sale, the Edinburgh-based group said it would be
pursuing further acquisitions and organic growth in its core business
areas.
Christian Salvesen indicated its wish to sell Salvesen Brick, W H
Collier and associated assets, generically known as Salvesen Brick, when
it posted interim figures in November.
A new company, formed by London-based venture capital giant CINVen and
existing management, will pay #61m in cash, with the balance satisfied
by a #2.5m unsecured convertible loan stock note in the company.
Salvesen Brick manufactures and sells facing and engineering bricks
from sites at Cheadle in Cheshire, Denton, near Manchester, Walsall in
the West Midlands, and Colchester in Essex.
CINVen, which outbid other prospective financial buyers and trade
purchasers from the UK and overseas, has elected to retain what it
described as a top-class management team. It plans to develop the brick
operations further.
Chris Masters, group chief executive of Christian Salvesen, said:
''The successful sale of Salvesen Brick is in line with our strategy of
focusing group resources on our international distribution and
specialist hire activities, where we see further opportunities for
growth in the future.''
The proceeds from the sale of the recovering Salvesen Brick, which
posted an operating profit of #3m for the 12 months to March 31 last
year and had net assets of #16.8m at the year-end, will be used to
reduce gearing.
Net group borrowings were #132.3m on March 31, representing 51% of
shareholders' funds.
Christian Salvesen, whose other principal area is food services,
invested more than #200m in distribution and specialist hire in the 18
months to September. Included in this expenditure was the #84m
acquisition of Northampton-based international distribution operation
Swift from a former Lep Group management buy-out team in October 1993.
In January, Christian Salvesen acquired 40% of German logistic
services supplier Wohlfarth Group from the Lep Group for an initial #2m.
It hopes to take full control in about a year, with additional payments
of between #4.9m and #25m, depending on Wohlfarth's performance.
The disposal of Christian Salvesen's Vikoma oil spill clearance
machinery operation is still in the offing.
Dr Masters said: ''For a number of years, Christian Salvesen has been
in a wide variety of businesses. By the time we announce our full-year
results, we will be very clearly focused on our international business
service activities.''
Christian Salvesen's halfway pre-tax profit was up #300,000 at #41.4m,
on turnover 21% greater at #319m. Its shares lost 1p to 253p yesterday.

WHATEVER Nick Faldo's victory in the Doral open might have done for
his own morale -- and that must now be at a higher level than for a long
time -- it should also have served notice to America's professionals
that he will be a factor again in the Masters tournament, the first
major of the season, which is only a month away.
Faldo, whose fourth success on the US Tour this was, but his first
since 1990 when he won his second successive title at Augusta, was,
however, surprised that his decision to commit himself to full-time
competition in America for the first time since 1989 had been so quickly
rewarded.
It enabled him, incidentally, to retain third place on the Sony world
rankings.
''I really wasn't sure how I would get on, and this has taken a lot of
pressure off me,'' Faldo reflected.
''It was exactly what I've been working for and I've done it -- to win
as early in the year as possible. Now I'll just have to see if I can
keep it going over the next few weeks.''
Pursuit of the championships is, as usual, the priority.
Faldo's preparations for the Masters comprise playing in the three
remaining tournaments in Florida -- the Honda and Nestle events and The
Players' Championship -- and sitting out the New Orleans open before he
reacquaints himself with the Augusta National club's course.
Ahead even of that, Faldo's odds for the US open have been cut from
14-1 to 7-1 joint favourite with the holder, Ernie Els.
Until that first serious engagement, Faldo will be looking to sustain
consistency in his game, for there was no hint from his four previous
outings, in Arizona and California, that the 39th victory of his career
was imminent.
After two moderate opening performances, Faldo finished ninth at
Pebble Beach and the next week at San Diego missed the cut.
Having crossed the continent, he inflated his bank balance by
#180,000.
The difference, as Faldo told his manager, John Simpson, over the
phone after he had won, lay in his putting.
His determination to persist with the cross-handed grip was thoroughly
justified, and at last he had the measure of the fast greens that are
the routine in American tournaments and never more so than at Augusta.
Now that Colin Montgomerie, Europe's No.1, Faldo, Severiano
Ballesteros, and Bernhard Langer are to be joined in America by Sandy
Lyle, Ian Woosnam, and Jose-Maria Olazabal, the opportunity will be even
further increased for the lesser European lights to continue to push
themselves closer to the front of the stage.
Alexander Cejka's breakthrough in the Andalucian open was the fifth
this season by a newcomer (when the American, Fred Couples, is included)
in the seven European tournaments completed during the first three
months of this winter.
Thus a pattern comparable to that which developed in the first half of
last season has again emerged.
In 1994 there were eight first-time winners, six of whom enjoyed their
baptism of success in the opening 12 events.
No-one else had that exhilirating experience after mid-June, by which
month, of course, fields had begun to strengthen as prize-money grew,
conditions improved, and the game's greater prizes came into view.
The cynical will say that this is simply a case of the mice being
allowed to play while the top cats of the game are away.
But that can be no bad thing, since serving an apprenticeship in the
art of winning and of being in contention to win is an essential part of
the tournament player's education.
Across the Atlantic, meanwhile, there has so far been only one new
winner in nine attempts.

<TEXT>
INVERESK has been doing all the right things but it has been pretty
powerless when faced by the avalanche of higher costs caused by the
escalation in wood pulp prices over the last few months and where early
relief seems unlikely.
Just 14 months ago, the commodity which traditionally accounts for
just over a third of the paper and board-maker's manufacturing costs has
escalated from $400 per tonne through December's $750 to the current
$825 and could well increase to over $900 by June as the shortage
intensifies with some competitor European paper mills no longer able to
obtain supplies.
Fortunately, Inveresk has supply agreements with erstwhile parent
Georgia Pacific.
So while the Pitreavie-based company was able to boost sales last year
by 11.9% to #101m, operating margins fell from 10.3% to 8% which
resulted in pre-tax profits dropping over 12% to #8.13m.
Chairman Bill Goodall said that in 1994, Inveresk sold more overseas
than in the UK, while chief executive Stefan Kay pointed out that
Germany, North and South America and the Far East were all good markets
with strong demand for furniture laminates and security papers.
Market reaction was to drop the shares 8p to 139p or 11p below the
1993 flotation price. That was despite a 5.1% increase in the dividend
total to 5.52p with a 3.68p final for a 5% yield.
The company is running at full capacity with the expansion at
Carrongrove boosting volumes, while the St Cuthberts mill moves on to a
seven-day basis in August. But while volume is there, supermarket label
users are extremely reluctant to concede price increases.
Also, there has been extreme competition from integrated Scandinavian
board manufacturers who upped pulp prices but held those for processed
paper.
Some #1m a year of costs is being taken out of the business.
One slightly disturbing point is anecdotal evidence that UK paper
merchants now have full pipelines, particularly for stationery products,
and that demand growth may well tail off. That begs again the question
as to how solid is the UK recovery and how much is due to stockbuilding.
Those investors with a medium to longer-term view should seize upon
the current share price weakness of a stock which is trading at about
11[1/2] times likely earnings as a beneficiary of an unwinding of the
pulp price in perhaps a year's time.

THE City sighed with relief when foods group Hillsdown Holdings said
that it would accept an offer worth up to about #300m for its 56%
controlling stake in Maple Leaf Foods of Canada.
The bidder is the Wallace McCain Family of frozen chip fame in
association with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. The deal is subject
to there not being a higher offer.
Hillsdown, under then chairman Sir Harry Solomon, acquired initially
Maple Leaf Mills in 1987, injected that into Canada Packers in 1990 and
renamed the enlarged company Maple Leaf Mills. The book value of the
investment is about #250m.
Current chairman Sir John Nott believes that Hillsdown's future lies
much more in the European market where it has been actively on the
acquisition trail.
Purchases have included the Cadbury's biscuits business, Lyons
Biscuits and Hobson's Canning in Britain. Further afield it has bought
the Danone jam business in France to make it the second-largest
jam-maker in Europe and Beledia chilled salads.
Maple Leaf has never lived up to expectations, partly reflecting the
dull state of the Canadian economy over the years. The proceeds would be
used to pay down Hillsdown's debt -- the details of which will be
revealed on Thursday with the 1994 results.
Although the majority shareholder, it has never had full control and
without direct access to Maple Leaf's #50m or so of cash.

FOR Roberto Quarta, the easy bit is over even if it has meant a
horrendous experience for the workforce at motor components to heavy
electrical coils and transformers group BBA.
The payroll has dropped 10% or by 2000 while the heads of three
divisional chiefs have rolled so that some #46m of costs have been
eliminated.
The aggressive former BTR manager is however well on his way to
achieving margins of 10% in 1996 with those in the second half of last
year emerging overall at 9.4% compared with just 6% a year earlier which
brings the full-year average to 8.4%.
The group made #63.9m before tax last year and helping matters has
been a divestment programme amounting to #131m which appears to be about
half completed as BBA concentrates on its core business of
autocomponents, aviation services in the US, non-woven textiles and
electricals.
That has boosted cash flow with gearing slumping from 46.5% to just
12% or debt of #49m which is enabling the company to move back on to the
acquisition trail -- its misfortunes in the past were caused in part by
previous chief executive Dr John White seemingly always on the lookout
for the next deal before the last one had settled down.
Mr Quarta is intent on expanding the group into the so far untouched
markets of South America and the Pacific Rim in friction products where
at present it has 30% of the European car market for clutch and brake
pads and is number two worldwide, and in textiles and electricals.
Although chairman Trevi Vannes views the company's future with greater
confidence than for some years, there does not seem any great reason to
become involved with the stock.
The reduction in the dividend total from 7.5p was not as bad as had
been forecast with an outcome of 4.75p for a 3% yield with the shares
closing 4p better at 194p.

THE takeover spotlight moved from the electricity sector to the
privatised water companies yesterday following news that French water
company Lyonnaise des Eaux wants to buy Northumbrian Water, the smallest
of the ten privatised water and sewerage companies in England and Wales.
News of the proposed cash offer to shareholders, which could take
place in the summer, saw Northumbrian shares bubble up 128p to 870p and
propelled other water shares higher. Welsh Water gained 28p to 637p.
Lyonnaise has yet to set out its terms which are conditional on the
satisfactory outcome of a regulatory review. Jacques Petry, president of
Lyonnaise's international water division, said the company was ''very
confident'' that it would clear all regulatory hurdles.
City analysts believe that Lyonnaise could have to pay at least 900p a
share for its takeover bid to succeed. This premium of around 20% to
Friday's closing price, before news of the bid, is seen as fair value
without much bid premium. However Northumbrian's board, chaired by
Professor Sir Frederick Holliday, said that the bid was ''unwelcome'',
which could push up the potential bid premium paid by Lyonnaise.
Northumbrian is viewed as one of the few attractive takeover targets
in the sector. The others are deemed to be too big and unattractive for
a number of reasons.
''Northumbrian is the most attractive water company on a financial
basis,'' said Andrew Stone, utilities analyst at Daiwa, who also
predicted that its dividends could rise 15% per annum.
Michael Cohen, utilities analyst at Salomon Brothers, believes that
Northumbrian would be a good buy for Lyonnaise, forecasting gearing of
around 7% for 1995 compared with about 40% for other water companies.
Lyonnaise already owns North East Water which is the main competitor
to Northumbrian in North-east England. The two companies share common
water sources and Northumbrian provides sewerage services to almost all
of North East's customers. Both companies supply an area with a
population of around 2.5 million people providing about 800 million
litres of treated water per day to customers. About 60% of
Northumbrian's water is supplied to industry.
North East Water was formed in 1992 following the merger of the
Newcastle &amp; Gateshead Water Company and the Sunderland &amp; South Shields
Water Company, both of which were acquired by Lyonnaise in 1989.
Lyonnaise also owns Suffolk &amp; Essex Water in southern England. Its UK
water businesses made a pre-tax profit of #46.3m in the year to March
1994 on sales of #162.4m. This compares with Northumbrian's taxable
profits of #62.8m and turnover of #298.6m.
Lyonnaise believes that the combination of Northumbrian and North East
Water will produce greater value for money for customers in terms of
lower charges to many customers through efficiency gains. It was also
keen to stress the regional economic benefits of the merger in terms of
creating a strong north east-based group and one of the largest UK water
companies.
As an international environmental services and urban development
group, Lyonnaise believes that its expertise will provide Northumbrian
with the critical mass to secure and manage international projects in an
increasingly competitive marketplace. Northumbrian already has a
significant international consultancy business.
The floodgates are likely to be opened on the water companies if the
MMC gives the go-ahead to Lyonnaise. There is now clearly the need for
the Government to say what, if any, social obligations the privatised
utilities must honour.
Given their long history in the public sector the privatised utilities
in many cases are not as hard nosed as other public companies under
existing management.
However the arrival of ''outsiders'', such as Trafalgar House in the
case of Northern Electric and Lyonnaise, means that this could all be
about to change. Friday is the closing date for the Trafalgar House bid.

ANNUAL results from healthcare group Smith &amp; Nephew suffered a deep
wound from one-off factors.
Before the exceptional items pre-tax-profits were up 9% on 1993 to
#172.2m on turnover increased to #964.6m from #948.7m.
However, it has written off #150.3m on disposals, mainly the US eye
implant company Ioptex sold last August.
Most of the loss relates to goodwill written off at the time it was
acquired in 1998 and now put through the profit-and-loss account.
A further #27.4m has been set aside for a programme of factory cost
reduction and rationalisation and restructruing of distribution across
Europe. The group is hoping job losses, which do not affect the UK, will
be absorbed by natural wastage.
After exceptional items, there was a pre-tax loss last year of #5.5m
compared with a profit in 1993 of #164.9m.
Smith, whose consumer products include Elastoplast and Simple
toiletries, said its five main product areas had continued to achieve
strong underlying growth in 1994.
''The business has performed well in 1994 with Smith &amp; Nephew again
demonstrating its ability to outperform the global healthcare market,''
said chairman Eric Kinder.
''We expect the strength of our innovation and technology to increase
this competitive edge,'' he added.
''We will continue to invest in the key areas of our business and we
are confident that organic growth will continue. We have been actively
pursuing acquisition opportunities in our existing areas of expertise
and will continue to do so.''
Last year's loss per share after the exceptional items was 4.96p
against earnings in 1993 of 10.55p. The dividend total rises to 5.28p
from 4.91p.

BRITISH Polythene Industries' proven trading formula continued to
deliver the goods last year despite surging raw material prices.
Profits of the Greenock-based group, by far the biggest manufacturer
of polythene products in the UK, jumped by a quarter to #19.2m.
Dividends are raised by 20% to 13.7p after a final of 9.25p.
The price of the polythene pellets raw material soared by 75% and
selling prices lagged behind the rapid increase. However, the group
still managed to raise margins as volume moved forward, helped by the
latest crop of acquisitions, which numbered seven last year.
The industry has a low cost of entry and there are myriad small
operators. British Polythene is the Goliath of the sector and has a
quarter of the market. There are other sizeable players like Bowater,
Sidlaw and Low &amp; Bonar, but chief executive Cameron McLatchie reckons he
can carry on buying up companies without encountering monopoly problems.
More capital investment is going in this year, in fact for the group
as a whole spending is scheduled to be up sharply to #18m after a dip in
1994 but both this and purchases will be funded from cash flow.
Meanwhile, debt has reduced sharply, with gearing standing at 17%.
British Polythene shares climbed 13p to 506p where they sell at 15
times earnings and yield 3.4%.

THE pound and the French franc posted fresh lows against the German
mark as chronic weakness in the US dollar continued to cause turmoil on
foreign exchange markets around the globe.
Sterling weakened throughout the day and by late afternoon it had
fallen through last Monday's all-time low of DM2.2950. As money poured
into the rampant mark the pound continued to give ground and by 6pm was
just above DM2.27, a drop of nearly six pfennigs since Friday's close.
The resignation of a junior Minister, Robert Hughes, after an
extra-marital affair, put the Government's fragility back on the agenda.
At one point sterling was trading at around $1.6550, but it fell away
sharply to $1.6220, a little below Friday's close.
The trade-weighted index dropped from 87.9 to 87.7, but this has still
to reflect the pound's late relapse. In the morning when sterling seemed
to be a winner in the currency stakes the index hit 88.2.
The dollar had to live with the failure of Friday's half-hearted
attempt by central banks to resuscitate it. Another fresh low of 92.45
yen was recorded and it came within a whisker of its all-time low of
DM1.3860.
By the close of European trading it was hovering around DM1.40. The
weakness of the dollar has been the key factor at work in the latest
currency crisis, which spilled over into Europe's exchange rate
mechanism forcing devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese
escudo at the weekend.
The Bank of Spain followed up the peseta's 7% devaluation by raising
its key intervention rate to 8.55% from 8.05%.
Uncertainties in the ERM enhanced the safe-haven characteristics of
the mark, which forced both the French franc and the Portuguese escudo
to fresh lows.
The franc is now 8.5% below its central rate in the ERM, still well
above its floor in the currency grid but vulnerable ahead of the
Presidential election which starts later this month.
After the New York markets opened rumours circulated that the Federal
Reserve had called an emergency meeting of the open market committee,
which reviews monetary policy. This was later denied by a central bank
official.
Japanese Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said earlier that his
country was considering calling an emergency meeting of the Group of
Seven nations.

OK girls, settle back and relax, this is your big day. Well, don't
relax too much, because you've still got to get the shoulder to the
wheel, the nose to the grindstone . . . and the trolley round the
supermarket for the hunter/gatherer in your life. Ruth Wishart updates
the story so far in the struggle for equality
SO WHAT do Martin Luther King, St Patrick, Queen Victoria and
Australia have in common with women? Easy really, they all have their
once-a-year day. A whole 24 hours in which the world may reflect on
their particular concerns . . . or not as the inclination takes them.
And tomorrow, girls, is all yours. Or that portion of it left over
once you've mopped up the rest of the troops on your patch. For somehow,
as you will not have failed to note, International Women's Day hardly
enjoys quite the cachet of Mothers' and Fathers' token celebration.
No floral tribute on the breakfast tray. Come to that, no tray. No
shops full of cards espousing your unique qualities in an assortment of
florid prose. No racks of chox shoved to the front of the supermarket
display in hope of inducing latent guilt in the partner person on the
way back from another day's hunter/gathering.
Of course you too will be hunter/gathering most of that fine day. But
that is filed under another category. You are not winning bread for your
family, you are merely supplementing the herculean efforts of the father
of your children.
A senior female broadcasting executive once observed that no matter
how closely men and women came to resemble each other in the matter of
fashion and haircuts, you could always spot which was which as they
scurried back to the work station after a lunchbreak. The women were the
people clutching three plastic bags from the supermarket.
That is because the female of the hunter/gatherer species requires to
take that title literally. If she does not bring home the bacon, be
assured the spouse will not have thought to purchase so much as an egg.
It is passing strange and damned inconvenient how New Man can now
bring himself to have his baby son and heir strapped to his chest in
airport queues, has been persuaded that the use of deodorant does not
contravene the international masculinity laws, and can even be spotted,
in the right conditions, cooking a passable dinner, yet still hasn't
made the connection between the need to eat and the requirement to shop
for the ingredients.
Given the massive amount of research into male and female brain
patterns, spatial awareness, logical application of research and all
that rot, how come nobody has addressed the fact that men sent to shop
for an item of footstuff will not, finding that unavailable, twig that
coming back with no substitute edible purchase is not a viable option?
They can't be that stupid . . . there's clearly just some genetic fault
line. Why can't a man be more like a woman?
However, let's not fritter away our time on the subject of men, given
that they get top billing on the other 364 days. Let us examine where
many decades of Women's Days have got women. The superficial answer is
not very far. Abysmal child care provision, persistent pay
differentials, very few barricades stormed at Westminster, 12 years of a
female Prime Minister who contrived to demonstrate all the worst
excesses of the kind of hierarchal dictatorship women would supposedly
rise above. And isn't it depressing how many women on the up think they
need to adopt the old power plays and crush dissent in the ranks,
talking sisterhood and practising tyranny?
Depressing, too, how many young women in this age of supposed
post-feminism (whatever that is) have jettisoned a lot of hard-won
respect by reverting to Barbie Doll impersonations. And we now have to
contend with self-appointed female gurus of the Naomi Wolf variety who
collectively display delusions of originality.
Very wearing for women who've been there and done that and
mass-produced the T-shirt, having to listen to Naomi clones re-inventing
the equality wheel. Or worse still, lecturing the rest of us on how we
got it wrong.
Because any lack of progress hasn't been for the want of trying and
some of the victories have not been insignificant. The contract of
marriage has altered out of all recognition over the last two decades,
with neanderthal husbands now occupying the figure-of-fun status once
accorded wives and mothers-in-law.
Political correctness, for all its loopy excesses, has helped clean up
a lot of unsavoury acts. Campaigns like Zero Tolerance have started to
make domestic violence have the same anti-social connotations in the
wider community that now characterise drink-driving after similar
high-profile treatment.
Control over conception has revolutionised female sexuality and given
women fundamental choices about how they wish to use it. Careers advice
no longer makes crass assumptions about female aspirations (or male for
that matter). Young men have recognised how disenfranchised their
fathers were in their skimpy relationships with their children, and
parenthood is discernibly more of a two-handed event.
Against all of which are the stark facts of under-representation in
the real seats of power, but even here women have been networking
vigorously to redress that imbalance. Imagine getting the irretrievably
macho trade union and labour movement to accept the principle of
all-women short leets even 10 years ago.
Consider the hard all-party, all-female slog which has been behind the
efforts to ensure a Scottish parliament doesn't replicate the
Westminster one with serried ranks of grey suits solemnly arguing the
toss about a woman's right to choose.
Too many boardrooms and quangos are still in the business of just
enough women to add a bit of window dressing, but many major
institutions, like the Scottish Arts Council and the BBC, have
full-scale equality programmes. Cause at least for a couple of cheers
without encouraging complacency.
Meanwhile, have you heard the one about the men who were so excited
about International Women's Day that they decided to resign and give
their jobs and salaries to women? No? Neither have I.

SUTER chairman David Abell should receive an even more than usual
attentive hearing from the Scottish institutions as he visits them today
after the engineering and chemicals group has apparently placed itself
in a position where there should be quite dynamic growth over the next
couple of years.
Putting aside exceptional profits on the sale of the valves
operations, stated pre-tax profits rose 24% to #23.6m. That was despite
a dull experience in the late summer at Mitchell Cotts chemicals where
the contribution was #1m lower because of a poor level of demand for
synthetic pyretheums as a cotton insecticide from Pakistan after
flooding.
But in recent months there has been a major transformation with
Chinese demand buoyant, Libyan orders under the belt for and an overll
good year in prospect.
The vast bulk of the profits advance came from acquisitions, including
James Wilkes, with the core businesses seeing margin pressure in
automotive, while hair-care supplies were hit by the re-locating of a
head office.
The current year will see a stronger performance from Chemoxy
speciality chemicals including pharmaceutical intermediates while the
group overall which achieved a 48% ratio of overseas sales last month
will continue to benefit from a generally favourable sterling position.
Suter reckons like-for-like unit costs in Germany are 2.1 times those
in the UK while even those in France are 1.4 times greater. So usefully
over #150m of the likely sales totalling #300m this time round will come
from overseas.
Analysts should be pencilling in about #28m for 1995 which would leave
the shares at 157p trading at 12 times likely earnings.
The dividend total has been raised from 9.2p to 9.5p with a 6p final
for an attractive and secure 7.6% yield.

MEDIA group Carlton Communications confirmed yesterday that it is part
of a consortium bidding for the MGM cinema chain which is being
auctioned off by its current owner, the French bank Credit Lyonnais.
The consortium includes the Dutch music and entertainment group
Polygram, US investment bank Goldman Sachs and the MGM management led by
Bill Doeren.
Carlton and a development capital fund of Goldman Sachs are the
principal partners putting up equal amounts of cash. The bid centred on
the chain's UK outlets is thought to be worth up to #170m and makes it
the front-runner to acquire the chain.
Rank Organisation is also interested in acquiring MGM cinemas although
it could face a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission given
its ownership of more than 300 rival Odeon screens in the UK. Last year,
Rank had an 18% share of box office takings compared with MGM's 25%
market share.
If Carlton's bid is successful, Carlton is expected to start with 50%
of MGM which has 120 traditional cinemas and 18 multiplexes giving it
more than 500 screens. Its profits last year topped #20m on sales of
#120m. In the longer term Carlton could end up taking full control with
the chain renamed Carlton Cinemas, a name already used by MGM in
Ireland.

THE bloodstained birth of the Benetton baby was also the birth of an
increasingly bloody billboard war. Somewhat to the surprise of the
Advertising Standards Authority, which does not like to be seen as
censors, Joe Public is sick of the shock tactics.
''Posters as a medium are being used more, and also more effectively.
I think the general public welcomes exciting advertising. It is
something people talk about,'' said Bill Lennon, spokesman for the ASA.
''Complaints relating to taste and decency have to be judged against
the background of standards applying in the UK. A high-profile poster
campaign can cause much more offence than the same adverts run in
specialist magazines,'' he added.
Current protest centres on two posters advertising films: Disclosure,
illustrated by a clinch between Demi Moore and Michael Douglas which
exposes a large chunk of her buttock, and Pret a Porter in which model
Helena Christiansen sprawls naked save for black stockings, stilettos,
and an artfully-draped feather boa.
The ASA says it has had ''a handful of complaints'' about the
Disclosure posters, which are currently under consideration. A decision
by the ASA council on whether they should be banned is expected within
days.
''Some people see this image as sexually explicit while others do not,
but the concern expressed has been mainly about the effects of the image
on children. It is more a question of where it is displayed and whether
it is going to be seen by people from the ages of three to 93.
Advertisements should not cause widespread or serious offence,'' said Mr
Lennon.
He rejected the idea that billboard advertisements should be vetted in
the way that they would be if they were to be shown on television on the
grounds that the public would not like to be told whether or not they
should be offended by something. ''We respond to public reaction. We
receive between 10,000 and 11,000 complaints a year and about 10% of
those are on the basis of an ad causing offence -- that is about 1000 a
year,'' he added.
In this case, the public has applied simple common sense: if you post
these particular ads in bus shelters they are going to be seen by people
who use buses, who tend to be more of the young and the old and parents
with small children than adults in their middle years. Some of the
indignation (and embarrassment) must stem from the fact that the exposed
Moore buttock is at child eye-level.
The Pret a Porter ad has attracted more condemnation as a traffic
hazard, because it distracts male drivers' attention, than for being
sexually explicit, but a number of women's groups have objected to the
portrayal of woman-as-sex-object image. The ASA said: ''We have had
about three complaints that this one is offensive. The issue of sexual
innuendo in advertisements depends on the context and the nature of what
is being sold.
''There are plenty of examples of complaints about sexual imagery not
being upheld. Really it ultimately comes down to whether the treatment
is gratuitous or not, whether sex is being used to sell something
entirely unrelated -- for example using a picture of a nude woman to
sell a car. Recently we banned a poster on just those grounds -- where a
building firm used a picture of the builders working on a house, but in
the foreground had a woman wearing a fur coat open to reveal her naked
breasts. It was completely irrelevant to the product they were
advertising.
''There is also a difference between sexism and sexual imagery. For
example one which we banned was from BSkyB for their showing of the film
Indecent Proposal showing a woman's bare midriff above a pair of
knickers with the caption: 'If the price is right, they will come down'.
The message that a lot of people read into that was that all women can
be bought at a price. That was unacceptable and we asked them to take
the posters down.''

INVESTORS in PowerGen and National Power saw an instant 10% profit on
their investment when dealings began yesterday.
Compared with the first instalment of 185p, PowerGen part-paid shares
began trading at 202p, while National Power started at 188p against the
first instalment of 170p.
During the day the prices bobbed about, with PowerGen hitting a high
of 207p and touching a low of 194p before closing at 198[1/2]p. National
Power reached 194p and hit 181p, concluding the session at 186[1/2]p.
Some 46 million National Power shares were traded and 29 million
PowerGen.
The closing levels were equivalent to fully-paid prices of 525[1/2]p
for PowerGen and 492[1/2]p for National Power. These compare with the
old shares at 491p, down 1p, and 456[1/2]p, unchanged, respectively.
The difference represents the value the institutions place on the
advantage of spreading the payment for the shares over 18 months, with
the final instalment of 142p for PowerGen and 136p for National Power
due in September 1996.
The allocations for applications through share shops favour applicants
who were already shareholders. Such applications for up to 500 shares
are met in full, those for 600 receive 550; 700, 600; 800, 625; 900,
650; and 1000, 700.
Non-shareholder share shop applications are satisfied in full for up
to 300 shares but are scaled back thereafter. Applications for 400
shares receive 325; 500, 350; 600, 375; 700-900, 400; and 1000, 425.
These figures clarify those we published on Monday.

<HEADLINE>Approval given for Barings takeover</HEADLINE>

HIGH Court approval was given late yesterday afternoon for Dutch group
ING'S takeover of Barings whose losses in the Far East, revealed as
#860m, brought about the collapse of the bank.
Vice Chancellor Sir Richard Scott said that not to do so would
threaten the stability of Far East markets. The only alternative was to
put Barings into liquidation which would mean the end of the name and
less for creditors.
ING'S chairman Aad Jacobs at a long delayed press conference awaiting
the High Court' decision said that all depositors and creditors of
Barings companies acquired, which excludes the Barings PLC parent, would
be paid in full.
He also said that all bonuses, valued at around #100m, with the
exception of Leeson -- whose dealings had brought Barings to its knees
-- would also be paid. However, the ING chairman qualified this later,
saying that are members of the company who risked not getting a bonus.
''There are persons in this organisation who have had someting to do
with what happened and, if you don't mind they are not getting a
bonus,'' he said. He would await the Bank of England probe.
Tackling the contentious issue of bonuses for Barings directors, Mr
Jacobs said that the six directors of Barings PLC, led by Peter Baring,
had made clear early in the talks between the companies that they did
not expect to be paid bonuses for 1994. Some of bonus payments being
made will be deferred but the group hopes to have them all paid by the
end of the year.
He parried questions on the future of some of these directors, saying
he would not talk about the board. He merely referred to the Bank of
England report on the affair and said he would be ''asking for a copy.''
ING also dismissed some reports that Barings losses had amounted to
#916m, stating that the figure was actually #860m -- comprising #610m in
Tokyo, #90m in Osaka and #160m in Singapore. There was some #420m of
shareholders funds and ING will immediately be injecting #660m of cash
into Barings. After restructuring and charging off loans, this would
leave shareholders funds of around #240m which ING is confident will
prove adequate.
However, while the Dutch group is paying all depositors and creditors,
there are two exceptions. It will not pay unknown sums which may arise
in the future. Nor will it pay the full #100m to the subordinated bond
holders in Barings.
It was these bondholders who had endeavoured to prevent the deal from
getting court approval as they would be better off under liquidation.
The ING chairman says that they took on a risk investment and were paid
a higher than usual yield on this basis. ING will however pay #5m (5%)
up front and another #20m should the funds become available. Mr Jacobs
made clear that he considered this very generous.
The Dutch banking and insurance giant is clearly anxious to keep staff
at Barings and has said it will keep them all on. It also wished to
encourage the bank's clients to stay with the company, promising ''at
least the same service as in the past.''
ING is also making a donation of #10m do that it can continue its
charitable work.
Meanwhile, the Singapore justice department's charge that Nick Leeson
committed forgery is based on a document allegedly from one of the
biggest firms on Wall Street, the Singapore state prosecutor said
yesterday.
Leeson is accused of forging the name of Richard Hogan, described by
the Singapore state prosecutor's office as a director of the firm Spear,
Leeds &amp; Kellogg.
Prosecutor Hans-Herman Eckert said a copy of the document was sent
from Singapore before Leeson's extradition hearing in Frankfurt last
Friday.
It purports to indicate that the specialist firm, Spear Leeds &amp;
Kellogg, had transferred DM108m (about #47m at the time) to Barings
Futures in Singapore for derivatives trading, or making bets on the
direction of the Nikkei 225 stock market index.
The state prosecutor's office said that the Singaporean justice
department alleges Leeson used the document as collateral to obtain from
Citbank in Singapore money with which to conduct the futures trading
that led to Barings' collapse.

TOMORROW, I'm told, is some sort of international ''Women's Day'', and
across Scotland dozens of girls-only events -- discussions, seminars,
encounter-groups and so on -- are being thrown for such females
inadequate enough to need them. While the extreme feminism of the early
eighties seems to have passed, the war of the sexes goes on. And this
particular carnival, of a Wednesday, follows neatly 10 days of
girl-thump-boy hysteria in our national affairs.
In Scotland we have endured the farcical row surrounding Roseanna
Cunningham's candidacy for the SNP nomination in the looming Perth and
Kinross by-election. And in England, after a short and typically
unpleasant trial, comedian Craig Charles has been cleared of rape. I
have never met Craig Charles, nor do I like his coarse brand of Scouse
wit. I have met Roseanna Cunningham, once. I thought she was tough, warm
and clever with delicious wit. Neither she, nor he, deserve in any way
what has befallen them.
First, the case of Ms Cunningham. She, and perhaps Margaret Ewing,
alone emerge from the selection debacle with some degree of standing.
The affair has done great damage. The SNP as a whole, which over the
last decade has been steadily building a reputation for professionalism,
suddenly threw us all back to the streets of Glasgow Garscadden, 1978;
the by-election which restored Donald Dewar to the Commons, when the
seat -- in which the SNP less than a year previously had taken every
district ward -- was thrown away by the Nationalists via a hopeless
candidate and general incompetence.
Winnie Ewing, yet again, allowed her mouth to run away from her brain.
It is not the first time Madam Ecosse has recklessly derailed her party.
Her antics at the Ayr Conference in 1982 resulted in wholesale
expulsions and destroyed the SNP's prospects for the looming General
Election. In 1988, almost single-handedly Mrs Ewing drove the SNP to
repudiate the Scottish Constitutional Convention; this crass decision
did the party huge damage, doing much to end Gordon Wilson's leadership
by the autumn of 1990.
Two Sabbaths ago -- the SNP's persistence in holding such meetings on
the Lord's Day must make Calum MacDonald very happy -- Mrs Ewing did it
again. On an appalling personalised roll, she accused Roseanna
Cunningham of ''breaking up my daughter-in-law's first marriage'',
citing memories of a long-buried affair between the very young Ms
Cunningham and one Donald Bain.
This was bizarre, to say the least. Ms Cunningham has not denied the
amour. But all agree that, by the time she and Mr Bain became involved,
his marriage with Margaret Bain -- then MP for East Dunbartonshire --
was dead in the water. The couple had been separated for months. At that
time, there was no great warmth between the SNP's two lady members. It
was 1984 before Margaret Bain took aboard the sprog and became Margaret
Ewing, beloved daughter-in-law.
So why the passion from Lossiemouth? Apart from anything else, it
tempts providence for any senior Nationalist to accuse any fling of the
husband's for destroying the matrimonial bliss of chez Bain. For all we
know, there could be another side to that story. Someone might tell it.
But worse piled upon worse. Senior party figures were pointedly slow
to spring to Ms Cunningham's defence. It is said that some entertained
genuine doubts about Ms Cunningham's credentials as a by-election
candidate in Perthshire.
I do not recall such doubts being expressed when, at short notice, Ms
Cunningham stepped heroically into the Perth and Kinross breach in 1992,
as the previous candidate dramatically resigned to run off and rave in
the hills. I do not recall anyone then objecting to her weeks of
exhaustion, loneliness, travel, flesh-pressing and foot-slogging to keep
the Nationalist flag flying. I do not recall anyone suggesting that Ms
Cunningham deserved compensation for earnings lost in the game of
political commitment. (Ms Cunningham, an advocate, lost a great deal.)
It is said that a left-wing republican candidate could be a vote
loser. After six years of scandal upon scandal from our tedious little
Teutons in London, I suspect even Crieff may be ready for a touch of
lese-majeste.
Bluntly, the treatment of Ms Cunningham stinks. It stinks because it
is quite inconceivable that such harassment at a selection meeting could
have been inflicted on a man. It stinks because Mrs Ewing's outburst,
whatever her motive, sounds truly malicious, and not a soul present
dared to say so. It stinks because no-one -- no-one -- deserves to be
quizzed on their personal or sexual past, without warning, in front of
other people, unless they themselves have made sexual accusations.
And it stinks because someone present at that meeting, quite
deliberately, went out and shared the juicy little tale with the people
of Scotland. (This, of course, inspired an electronic sweep of the
boardroom: not content with Garscadden, the SNP offers us Watergate.)
All credit to Margaret Ewing, whose distress and anger was immediately
apparent. And a mocking bow to Alex Salmond, who has kept himself above
the tumult with stylish dexterity, inclining ever so gently from winning
side to winning side -- as, dear Alex, you do so well.
I am not a feminist, but I do believe in a level playing-field. And so
let us consider Craig Charles. This week, his reputation and life lie in
ruins. For the rest of his career his chipper little face, his very
name, will be associated with rape. He has survived three months in the
cells. He had to use every last penny he owned for his defence, until
penury finally qualified him for legal aid. (He has, happily, been fully
reimbursed.)
The charge Craig Charles faced proved so incredible in court that the
jury took less than an hour to throw it out. It came from a woman of
notorious character, who had myseriously failed to seek medical
examination or press a complaint for some considerable time after her
alleged ordeal. We will never, in law, hear the name or see the face, of
this woman. But the law of the land had no objection to the face and
name of the man she falsely accused being plastered through the papers.
The reaction to Charles's acquittal was what we have come to expect
from the hard man-hating left. Anti-rape groups made little secret of
their disappointment; such a high-profile conviction would be meat and
drink to them but Craig Charles has called for the anonymity at present
granted to rape complainants to be extended to accused rapists. And in
that demand he is entirely justified.
All we ask for is a level playing-field. But to suggest, however
mildly, that a woman wailing ''rape'' may be lying is to invite a
lynching. To protest the right of counsel to cross-examine a woman on
her previous sexual history -- a perfectly justifiable move, if her
consent is the basis of your defence -- is to invoke the fury of the
harridans around the land. We are now drawing perilously close to a day
when the acquittal of a man charged with rape will be legally
impossible. If that day comes, we may be tempted to mount a Zero
Tolerance campaign of our own.
Tomorrow, is it a forlorn hope that the assorted woman-only gathering
will centre, for once, not on a male monopoly of viciousness, but on the
evil and malice within us all?
And on Thursday, can we now be sure that Nationalists in Perth and
Kinross will reward Ms Cunningham with the SNP candidacy? She has been
tried with fire. She has come through a wretched time with dignity and
grace. The SNP is now, wretchedly, unable creditably to deny her
nomination. If Roseanna Cunningham were finally bested by some dull and
tweedy little man, we should not hesitate to destroy them.

The Citizens' is to stage a fund-raising extravaganza to celebrate the
work of the late Alasdair Cameron. Mary Brennan reports
YOU can -- so the saying goes -- tell a man by the company he keeps.
Alasdair Cameron kept company with a rare host of folk: actors and
academics, gay activists and theatre archivists, playwrights and
critics, enthusiastic foodies and serious fans of Maisie the Kilted
Kitten.
Since his death last June, it has become ever clearer just how far
Alasdair's company of friends extended. As his brother, actor Robin
Cameron, points out, Alasdair lived life to the full, forever making
space for people and causes: ''And still finding time to bake a banana
loaf for a student tutorial group!''
He was an unstuffy intellectual with a passion for Scottish theatre, a
lively and engaging teacher who enjoyed the role of the senior lecturer
in the Department of Theatre, Film and Media Studies at Glasgow
University. He was a hands-on practitioner of what he taught -- he wrote
plays, produced and directed plays, helped set up new companies (Clyde
Unity is a prime example) and willingly advised many more.
Messages are still reaching his family from various parts of the
globe, all echoing one thing: Alasdair's gift for inspiring others. Time
and again, his guidance and support helped friends -- many of them
former students -- to find their own path, have confidence in their
abilities, their goals, their sexuality.
What also emerged was that people didn't just want to mourn Alasdair
-- they wanted to celebrate him. And they wanted, somehow, to continue
his giving spirit of marvellously practical encouragement. Which is why,
on Sunday, March 19, the Glasgow Citizens' will surrender its stage to
Tartan Trifles, an evening of rousing hilarity aimed at raising funds
for The Alasdair Cameron Scholarship Trust.
So far the lineup includes Jimmy Logan, Neil Bartlett, Clyde Unity
Theatre, Karen Matheson of Capercaillie, Horse and some of Robin
Cameron's colleagues from Take the High Road. Janice Forsyth is
compering and Ian Brown of the Traverse has come in on the production
side.
Others -- like Una McLean --were keen to take part but couldn't manage
to be there on the night. ''It's been quite amazing,'' Robin says.
''Everyone we'd spoken to has immediately said they'll help if they can.
You only have to mention Alasdair's name and you get this tremendous
response. He meant so much to so many different people. And they want to
do something in return.''
Tickets for Tartan Trifles are #5, #10, #15 and #20 available from the
Citz and through the city's ticket line. All proceeds go towards the
scholarship fund being set up in his name at Glasgow University (which
will also advise on how to make other donations and covenants).
The award, linked into the Erasmus scheme -- which Alasdair helped to
organise -- will enable a student director to travel with his or her
production to participating universities overseas. Previously there was
cash for the cast to travel, but directors had to find the necessary
funding themselves.
It is so very appropriate that the fund will encourage theatre-making
in a university context for that was a vital part of Alasdair's working
life. And it's rather nice that the award involves travel -- Alasdair
had a flair for combining business and pleasure as his postcards home
from academic conferences proved. He could always find a theatre
performance, exhibition or tearoom in the most unpromising spots.
Alasdair Cameron would have been 42 on the second of this month. He
was just starting to make a name for himself in prestigious
international academic circles where he tirelessly promoted the cause --
the history and the practice -- of Scottish theatre.
Here, at home, he was loved and respected for his unstinting support
of Scottish theatre in all its forms, from variety to live art. But more
than that, he was sought out in foyers, because he was such good, good
company. Tartan Trifles is one way for friends to tell the world now
much his company meant.

LAST Thursday evening I was sitting in the grand ballroom of the
refurbished Vista Hotel in Lower Manhattan. Two years before, the floor
we were sitting on had disappeared as a terrorist bomb, 50 feet below,
in the underground car park of the World Trade Centre next door, went
off, killing six people.
Some $60m later, the Vista -- one of five Ladbroke-owned Hilton
International hotels in the United States, where the Hilton brand name
is still the reserve of the domestic Hilton Hotels Group -- is back in
business. We were gathered for the formal re-opening dinner.
If I was looking just a bit more flushed than some of the guests, it
wasn't the champagne or the sushi. It was the thought that minutes away
lay the evening's star cabaret turn, an hour-long session with the
incomparable Ray Charles.
We are talking teenage obsession here. I've still got all his blues
and soul albums from the late 50s onwards. Now into his 60s, Charles
looks frailer although the act of making music still triggers those same
convulsive limb and body movements of old. The voice may have lost some
of its sheer raw liquid energy, but its haunting quality burns bright.
Just one song into his set, Ray Charles launched into Busted, a
Georgia farmer's lament about no longer being able to make ends meet. My
bills are all due and the baby needs shoes and I'm busted. Cotton is
down to a quarter a pound and I'm busted . . .
The maestro's timing was spot-on. Balancing the budget isn't just a
headache for poor southern cotton farmers these days. Modern governments
find it hard to live within their means too. They find it even harder to
kick the habit of trying to spend more money than they raise from taxes.
We live in the era of fiscal deficits or, as we in the UK prefer to call
them, public sector borrowing requirements.
Hours before Ray Charles launched into Busted, the US senate had
thrown out, by a single vote, the central plank in the new Republican
majority's Contract with America. The amendment, to approve a balanced
federal budget by the year 2002, drew support from 14 dissident
Democratic senators, but just failed to make the required two-thirds
majority.
On Friday, one Democrat -- Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, the
only native American Indian in the senate -- switched parties to the
Republicans ostensibly in protest at the amendment's failure, although
disputes with other Democrats in his home state were said to have played
a big part. On television, sporting his distinctive ponytail and neck
jewellery, the 60-year-old Harley Davidson devotee urged that, unless
America sorts out its national finances, it will eventually go the way
of ailing Mexico. ''And who will be there to bail us out when that
happens?'' he asks rhetorically.
But Senator Campbell himself is part of the problem. A conservative on
fiscal matters, he is a liberal on social issues. He wants federal money
spent on education and social security programmes. He has voted with the
Clinton Democrats some 80% of the time. Like a lot of people in
Washington, Campbell wants to have his cake and eat it too.
He is far from alone. Public opinion polls in the US show an
overwhelming popular majority -- up to 80% -- in favour of balancing the
federal budget. But that rapidly shrinks to a minority view if social
welfare spending is to be the prime target. Even the American people
find it impossible to face up to the really hard choices.
The Republicans could have had their two-thirds majority for last
week's amendment had they been prepared to ring-fence the social
security budget from the planned cuts. They wouldn't, most Democrats
voted against and so the cat-and-mouse will go on right through to the
next presidential election.
Everyone, President Clinton included, preaches some version of fiscal
rectitude. But when it comes to what needs cutting to avoid going, as
Ray Charles would have it, busted, the political sophistry really
starts. Thus, in the few days I was there, Hillary Clinton was to be
seen sharing school meals with some bewildered kids (highlighting one
threatened target) while Bill himself turned up at a dinner for public
service broadcasting (another reported Republican target) to extol its
non-commercial virtues.
Republicans were at it too. House speaker Newt Gingrich said he was
all in favour of public service broadcasting, provided the federal
government didn't have to stump up for it. Republican presidential
hopeful Bob Dole accused the Democrats of trying to scare the elderly
with talk of swingeing welfare cuts.
These are not just transatlantic abstractions. When we get round to
the next General Election in this country, the battle for hearts and
minds here will almost certainly focus on the economic credibility of
the Major and Blair camps in ways which directly parallel the current
budget battles on Capitol Hill.
Our budget deficit is shrinking fast from the days when it threatened
to yawn beyond #50 billion. But the uneasy tension between fiscal
rectitude and which programmes each party would be prepared to cut to
reach such a state of bliss will persist right up till polling day.
Labour's current stance is to promise virtually nothing that costs
more money, lest the reckless-with-your-money label prematurely sticks.
But, as with Senator Campbell, while Labour wants to prove its
credentials on fiscal rectitude, it is instinctively a party wedded to
social reform through spending programmes.
In the US, the Republicans now believe they can pin the reckless label
on the Clinton Democrats. The President and his supporters, in turn, are
convinced they can win with the electorate by focusing the electorate's
attention on the Republicans' spending axe. Received wisdom has it that
Clinton is already a busted flush, while over here the same consensus
suggests Blair is a shoe-in. When it comes to convincing fickle
electorate, in either case, I'm not so sure.

Clare Higgins as Martha Dobie in Lillian Helman's The Children's Hour:
'We live in a homophobic society -- prejudiced against women
playwrights.'
Mark Fisher discusses the prejudices that kept two plays by women off
the British stage
WITHIN a week of International Women's Day, two female-written plays
are to appear in Scotland after years of shameful neglect. The last
chance you had to see Ena Lamont Stewart's Starched Aprons was in 1953.
It's back again tomorrow night, after more than 40 years, being
performed by second-year students at Glasgow's RSAMD.
Your only chance to see Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour would
have been in a members-only theatre in the days when the Lord
Chamberlain held sway over the nation's moral wellbeing. Until the
National Theatre revived it last year, it had never been given a major
British production in its 60-year history. But next week it is calling
into the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, as part of a national tour.
So why the silence? Both plays might have been debut works, but in
their day both received significant acclaim. Starched Aprons was a major
hit for Glasgow Unity when it premiered at the Old Athenaeum Theatre in
1945. Its success lead to the commissioning of Stewart's Men Should
Weep, which was rediscovered -- again after years of neglect -- by 7:84
in its celebrated Clydebuilt season of 1982. Over in New York, Hellman
had burst onto the theatrical scene a decade earlier with The Children's
Hour which played on Broadway for 691 performances.
It was made into two films, These Three in 1936, and The Loudest
Whisper with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine in 1961. Although a
subsequent tour did run into trouble, the play was revived -- directed
by Hellman herself -- in 1952.
The neglect of The Children's Hour is perhaps easiest to explain --
which is not the same as to justify. Inspired by a notorious Scottish
libel suit of 1810, but relocated to 1930s New England, the play is
about two teachers whose careers and school are ruined after a malicious
pupil accuses them of having a lesbian relationship. Although the child
has no foundation for her allegation, the resulting furore leads the two
teachers to examine the true nature of their feelings, which do indeed
turn out to be homosexual.
Homosexuality was, of course, the last thing to be tolerated by the
Lord Chamberlain who had jurisdiction over the British stage until 1968.
When first an attempt was made to stage The Children's Hour over here,
the Lord Chamberlain told Hellman, much to her amusement, that although
there was ''a male homosexual problem'' in Britain, there were to his
knowledge no lesbians in the country.
Three private venues did stage the play, in 1936, 1950 and 1956, but
with a ban in force for longer than any play this century bar Shaw's Mrs
Warren's Profession, it is not exactly surprising that it should have
been forgotten.
It's hard to say whether the play would have returned more readily to
the repertoire had it been written by a man. Although she stopped
writing for the theatre in 1963, more than 20 years before her death,
Hellman is still widely regarded as one of America's major dramatists,
and other of her less controversial plays, such as The Little Foxes,
have enjoyed revivals.
The subject matter of The Children's Hour is far more likely to be the
problem -- after all, the representation of male homosexuality on stage
has hardly had a happy history either -- but it's not out of the
question to imagine that the playwright's gender might have played a
part.
''It's no accident that this play hasn't been done,'' asserts Clare
Higgins, who plays Martha Dobie, the teacher whose love dare not speak
its name, in the National Theatre production. ''We live in a homophobic
and deeply prejudiced society -- prejudiced against women playwrights.''
As Higgins points out, The Children's Hour is not suspect, dirty or
pornographic, rather it is a tightly-constructed (Hellman was heavily
influenced by Ibsen), well-paced, emotionally engaging human drama that
precedes Arthur Miller both in craftsmanship and content (Hellman's
theme of the power of rumour crops up again in The Crucible).
The worst you could say about it is that it veers a little too close
to the melodramatic for modern tastes, but certainly in Howard Davies's
NT production there is no grand action that is not emotionally
justified. And what that production convincingly demonstrates is that
the British stage has been denied a powerful and pertinent tragedy that
is ably suited to many a mainstream rep.
''Obviously we haven't moved on at all in the 60 years since the play
was written,'' says Higgins. ''It should be a commonplace sight and the
fact that it is an extraordinary sight shows that we're completely stuck
in the Dark Ages.''
It is rather more easy to attribute the neglect of Ena Lamont Stewart
to male prejudice. Certainly that was the way she felt having abandoned
playwriting through lack of encouragement only to be rediscovered three
decades too late.
''Of course it hurt,'' she was quoted as saying. ''Men select the
plays that are put on. They are more likely to put on a play by a man
than a woman. Male chauvinism is rife in Scottish theatres.''
Stewart did at least live to see the renaissance of her own work. Even
then it is over 10 years since the revival of Men Should Weep and only
now that Starched Aprons is being looked at. Of course, a possibility
has to be that the play just isn't up to scratch, but given the repeated
success of her second play and the debut success of her first, it must
surely be worth giving it another airing.
Director Alasdair McCrone certainly thinks so. ''I wanted to do it
immediately,'' he says, ''because it's a Scottish piece by a woman
writer, with lots of good parts for women, and in its historical context
it's interesting because the theatre in Glasgow 50 years ago was a very
different beast. The students have learned a lot about what has
changed.''
Like The Children's Hour, which has only two men in its 16-strong
cast, Starched Aprons puts women centre-stage in similar numbers. Set in
a late-1920s hospital it draws on Stewart's own experience working in
Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children in the 1930s. ''Its admission
hall,'' she said years later, 'afforded me a splendid, if harrowing,
opportunity to indulge in blatant eavesdropping.''
McCrone confirms that it gives his students some splendid
opportunities for character acting. ''What's been very pleasing is that
this play has stood up to a modern psychological analysis,'' says the
director. ''It's not a feminist piece by any means, but I think she was
very conscious that most of the other writers of that time were
producing men's plays. She was consciously writing something that was
about and for women and their experience.''

Milan, Tuesday
WAR, they say, breeds a certain kind of photographer, fearless, agile,
taciturn in fatigues. A brigand with a Leica, who allows the pain and
heartbreak of hell to speak only through his pictures.
And then there is Rusty, a man with his own war to fight. Rusty works
down in the trenches of the fashion industry as a catwalk snapper during
the International Collections, and for him this is an especially
difficult battle because Rusty is not really a photographer at all. In
fact, Rusty is not even his true name but then who knows what is fact or
fiction about Rusty any more.
However, in his everyday life, back in New York he is by all accounts
a psychoanalyst. Here, in Milan, though, shooting models from the ankle
up, he is ostensibly feeding a long addiction to glamour. But in close
focus glamour never amounts to very much; it is far better observed from
a distance where the bruises on the mannequins' shins remain invisible.
Of course, by the time Rusty learned this another addiction was boiling
in his blood: the lust for money.
So, if we are to be frank about it, Rusty is not only an impostor, he
is a spy. Not a CIA agent or anything graceless like that, but an
industrial infiltrator who aims to sell his trespassing pictures to
rip-off merchants on Seventh Avenue, the garment district of New York.
Thus what the emperors of style show in Milan or Paris on Tuesday the
schmutters kings at home can have on the backs of Broadway by Friday
night.
It won't be the same quality by any means and after a few wearings the
details -- zips, buttons, the thrown-together seams -- will tell a sorry
story, but for $100 and as many hours, Zoe Clinger from Brooklyn Heights
will be able to shape about in a persuasive imitation.
Her unknown benefactor in much of this will be the unauthorised Rusty
who slides past the heavy security on designer shows by claiming to be
the tripod bearer of an accredited photographer for an important
American daily. This sullen compadre called Tom, with gingery dreadlocks
and a natural grunge expression, also has a metal leg -- his keepsake
from Vietnam. He lends Rusty a camera, and positions him in the pit at
the side of the catwalk. Many photographers now have assistants loading
equipment for them with the swift deftness of a conjurer's helpmate.
But the problem with Rusty is that you can tell he is an amateur
because he keeps forgetting which of his many pockets holds his stock of
film.
''What is this guy, some kind of fraud?'' cries an exasperated
Jean-Pierre from a French glossy called Ravisement. ''Listen bonehead,''
retorts Tom, ''this is my apprentice. Got it? A little technically
retarded, may be, but I am employing him as part of President Clinton's
new urban aid initiative for the creatively disadvantaged. If my moral
responsibility to fellow human beings gives you a problem, see me after
the show, asshole.''
''D'accord, he's your buddy,'' says Jean-Pierre, and he hugs Rusty
while giving Tom a sceptic's wink. But why make enemies when a united
front is required against an interloping heavyweight Japanese
photographer, the Sumo wrestler of fashion realism? Merely by raising an
elbow he has prised Tom from his traditional position in the trench.
''Who are you pushing around, buster?'' yells Tom, grabbing the offender
by his flak jacket. ''No-one crowds my space.''
The Sumo wrestler is unnerved by the fury pulsing through Tom's neck
muscles. Perhaps he, too, has heard the rumour that Tom is a man who
knocked out his picture editor in a delicatessen. As it happens, Rusty
defuses the trouble. Despite no badge of accreditation, he sweet-talks
the bouncer on the door into stepping forward to defend his friend.
The Italian lurches into operatic anger, hustling the defeated
outsider into another position in the pen at the end of the catwalk.
''Remember, I did that for you, Tom,'' says Rusty with feeling, but by
now Tom has joined the posse of photographers hectically snapping the
arrival of Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley.
Suddenly, by his side, there is Rusty now developing something of a
longer view. When the mob has receded, he positions himself in front of
the couple laminated in wide-angle smiles, and politely requests them
both to say dolcelatte. Then, he jumps into the empty seat beside Hurley
and asks the woman to his right if she will take a picture of them
together. The posse looks back, astonished. But by then up go the
lights, off come the lens caps and on lope 50 girls parading what
appeared to be Scarlett O'Hara's cut-down curtains. How many other women
have not responded to an emergency in similar fashion, muses Rusty as,
forgetful as ever, he lifts an empty camera to his eye.

BELLY'S strength is Belly's weakness. They are all-too-obviously
gungo-ho graduates from some anonymous All-American College of Art-Metal
whose curriculum is admirably gritty and yet sadly limited,
undergraduate study-modules being centred solely on the novels of
Charles Bukowski and William S Burroughs, and the required musical
listening-list comprising albums by Television and Love.
At its best, the end-product is songs which are powerful, dynamic,
melodic. At its worst, as on Belly's current LP, it's worthy but dull;
indiscriminate loudness. Sunday's show tended towards the latter.
They do try, though. Sleeves rolled up, perky frontwoman Tanya
Donnelly grinned her wholesome chipmunk grin and bobbed her blonde
bunches. Feisty, kilted bassist Gail Greenwood flailed her waist-length
hair and ran the full gamut of heads-down, no-nonsense mindless
rock-poses. Legs akimbo, semi-limbo, clenched fist skywards,
pogo-promenade. But when Belly ground remorselessly through their best
song, Feed The Tree, they revealed the campus library's latest addition:
Big Country's Gratingest Hits.
Crossing the road to the informal gig highlighting three of the
Glasgow bands on the Hamburg-based Marina label, I was fortunate enough
to experience a small sample of the intense delicacy of Chris Thomson
and his latest line-up of Bathers, featuring James Grant on guitar.
Operating on a confessional plane somewhere between Van Morrison and
Tom Waits, Thomson's reach occasionally outstretches his grasp.
Nevertheless, his vision of music as an instrument of beauty is wholly
compelling. Enrol now at the Tramway for the next two Sunday-night
courses at the Bathers' University of Emotional Truth.

ONE of four UK concerts acting as rehearsals for the one in Copenhagen
next week at which featured soloist Tony Coe will receive the
prestigious Jazzpar Prize, this was in consequence more tentative than
we have come to expect.
Unlike the BBC's Radio 2 equivalent, the DRBB has moved on from the
golden age of the big band into territory charted by some of its many
American collaborators. Arranger/conductor Bob Brookmeyer produced
several charts which had apparently lost him his musical director's job
with the Mel Lewis Band and which proved a bit ''too modern'' for some
of the audience.
The closing Nasty Dance to me sounded full of clever writing, was
resolved brilliantly, and featured such relatively daring exploits as
having the trombone section impersonate a choir of marauding bees. To
others it may well have seemed like a heck of a way to hand in one's
notice.
Coe's first-half contributions on tenor sax, though beautifully
realised, sounded more suited to a smaller, even more contemporary band,
and when he and Brookmeyer, on gorgeously languid valve trombone,
combined in a conversational quintet reading of What Is This Thing
Called Love, the results cried out for a concert all to themselves.
However, Coe's Jazzpar-commissioned piece, Captain Coe's Famous
Raceabout, was enterprising big-band writing, with the composer's
clarinet skating over an arrangement as skilful as it was individual --
a virtuoso display that was only exceeded by Coe's tear duct-challenging
soprano on one-time DRBB collaborator Maria Schneider's lovely, spacious
My Lament.

THE title signifies the structure. Roots and Fruits is the Chamber
Group of Scotland's concert series about teachers, pupils, and pupils'
pupils. Last night's -- with a repeat in Glasgow tonight -- was firmly
rooted in the music of Zoltan Kodaly, but branched out in various
directions, extending to Kodaly's protege Matyas Seiber before reaching,
much less predictably, John Tavener, David Lumsdaine, and our own Judith
Weir.
Like previous programmes, it was enhanced by three gifted performers
-- Ruth Crouch, Robert Irvine, and Graeme McNaught -- on violin, cello,
and piano, but a percussionist (Jay Allen) was additionally required for
Lumsdaine's atmospheric portrayal of an Australian kangaroo hunt, and a
viola player (Carolyn Sparey-Gillies) for Weir's equally evocative
Distance and Enchantment.
In terms of shining timbres, Lumsdaine's was the evening's most
colourful piece, though Kodaly's big Duo for violin and cello was
vibrant, too, and considerably more intense.
Making something out of Tavener's Thrinos, a melancholy meditation for
cello, was perhaps a less rewarding task, though Robert Irvine made much
of its haunting dissonances. Weir's short quartet proved wonderfully
robust, employing Irish and Scottish folk music in a way that Kodaly
would surely have recognised and applauded. It clinched the evening to
perfection.

THE scene is Queen Street Station in Glasgow last Wednesday where
shivering passengers are waiting for an Edinburgh train which has been
much delayed due to that wrong kind of snow, of which there appears to
be a lot about these days.
Those nice people from ScotRail announce that passengers, when they
finally get on the train, are to get a free cup of cheering tea or
coffee.
A young lady passenger duly asks the trolley chap for her free cuppa.
He knows nought of what she speaks. It was announced over the station
Tannoy, she says. I don't get off the train, he says, I never heard it.
The man in the seat across the aisle joins in the debate and confirms
that he, too, heard the announcement. Why not check with the train
conductor, the young lady suggests.
The trolley chap returns with the news that the young lady can indeed
have a free cup of tea but the man opposite cannot.
Why not? ''Well, I don't have enough hot water for everybody and the
conductor told me to look after the women and children first,'' he says.
Piped haggis
A BURNS Supper tale which just squeezes in by the Diary's strict
sell-by date regulations, especially since it has come all the way back
from Portugal.
The celebration of the bard was organised in the Algarve by Willie
Wilson, a kenspeckle Helensburgh builder, who has interests over there.
He had imported from the auld country sundry musicians and speakers for
the occasion. Also imported, of course, was the haggis.
Everything went very well. Good speeches, great neeps. Except that the
chieftain of the puddin' race was, well, a bit squidgy.
The owner of the restaurant, who is of English extraction, admitted
that she had been expecting a comment or two on the bland consistency of
the haggis.
It was the French chef. When the haggis came back from being
ceremonially stabbed, he disembowelled it from its genuine sheepskin
stomach container, put it into a blender, stuffed it into a bag with a
nozzle on the end, and squirted it on to the plates.
Asked why he had done so, the chef replied that he had noticed on the
programme that the haggis had to piped in.
Road to Dundee
PERTH customers of a well-known insurance brokers received a letter
recently with the cheery heading: ''Things are changing for the better
at Swintons.'' Customers eagerly reading on to hear the good news were
told: ''We are constantly seeking to improve the services we offer and,
as a result, your Swinton office will be merging with another branch.
The new address and date for your diary is: 11 Tay Square, Dundee.''
Yes, the really good news is that Swinton was closing the Perth branch
and everybody was getting an excuse for a trip to Dundee.
Cheque this
A TRUE story, honest, from a legal practice in a rural fastness of
Scotland which we will not identify, for obvious reasons. A customer
wrote to express satisfaction with the service which had been provided.
Settlement of the account would be gladly made but (and how is this
for a variation on the old cheque is in the post theme?): ''I have
forgotten my signature. Could you please wait until I ask the bank to
send me the specimen of my signature''.
To Russia
with thanks
ONE of the ways the BBC manages to keep our licence fee so low is by
selling its programmes to foreign TV networks. Thus we hear that
Eldorado, the soap of blessed but fading memory, has been sold to
Russia. To a company called Angst TV. Seems appropriate. The word Minsk
springs to mind as well.
A HEIDIE of this parish writes to let us know that Strathclyde
University's faculty of education, Jordanhill College as was, is
offering places on a sex education course on ''a first come, first
served basis''.
High achiever
THE Name Game: According to the media directory of Glasgow University,
they have on their staff a psychology lecturer called Dr Dick Dafters
who is an expert on Ecstasy.
Crumbs . . .
SCOTLAND'S Top Tim, Cardinal Thomas Joseph Winning, was in Clydebank
for a civic reception the other night and was presented with a huge cake
to celebrate his red-hattedness.
It being Lent, he in turn handed it over to Sister Rita of St
Margaret's Hospice. The cardinal is being religious about lenten cakes.
At a recent dinner in Glasgow he asked a waitress if she would mind
giving him only half of the large piece of gateau she had put on his
plate.
''Nae problem,'' the waitress said, as Glasgow waitresses do. ''We
don't like fat Popes anyway.''

It is not possible to research the Scottish Women's Suffragette
movement without a certain amount of personal grief. Women have not so
much been been written out of history as surgically removed. There is a
poverty of information. The sparse chunks of collated material read like
a secondary schoolbook; superficial, factual, with all the interesting
matter kept out. The documentation on women in Scotland who were
fighting for the vote is as illuminating as a 10-watt bulb. The vitality
and eccentricity of the main, female protagonists is missing, their
personalities ignored in history, as they were by the authorities
against whom they rebelled. It seems that International Women's Day,
argues Anvar Khan, is simply a case of trying to remember what has been
dusted, put to the back of the cupboard and conveniently forgotten
FASHION has overtaken politics. It is trendy among professional women
to denounce International Women's Day as a token celebration. Feminism,
they masticate, is for women who need a crutch. But to deny the
importance of feminism is to declare oneself completely ignorant of
international inequality, past and present.
At 10.30am tomorrow, Glasgow City Council Women's Committee will erect
a plaque at the site of a tree which was planted on April 20, 1918, in
Kelvin Way, by Glasgow Women's Suffrage Organisations. At that time, the
tree was intended as a commemoration of women getting the vote. On
Wednesday, the oak will be singled out, and its history explained,
symbolic of the way feminism and the fight for equal rights have to be
continually justified to men and twentieth-century women.
Those who have experienced discrimination are more inclined to want to
eliminate it. In September 1907, there was a split within the women's
suffrage movement over the question of democracy. Some women regarded
Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst as dictators, and they, in return,
regarded dissenters as ''wreckers'' of the movement. The wreckers
seceded to form the Women's Freedom League, which had a strong
representation in Scotland. The League opened a suffrage centre, with a
tea-room and bookshop, in Sauchiehall Street.
The front-line of Scottish feminists included Louisa Innes Lumsden,
Frances Melville, Chrystal MacMillan, Anna Munro, Maggie Moffat, Kate
Evans; women who were among the first to enter the male sanctum of
universities, politics, law and science. Their academic credentials were
immaculate. There isn't one who doesn't have an alphabet behind her
name. But the most interesting is Eunice Murray, a powerful speaker and
propagandist from Cardross.
Eunice wrote many essays on why women should be allowed to vote, why
women should no longer be kept ignorant of the issues, both moral and
legal, which directly affected their lives. Hers was a mission to
explain why women, like slaves, should be treated not as property but as
people. Like every other suffrage organisation, the Women's Freedom
League saw the vote as a means to an an end, a key which would open the
floodgate of legislation to alleviate female oppression. They campaigned
for justice, listing court cases weekly in their newspaper. The cases
were entitled ''How Men Protect Women'' and gave examples, such as when
Sheriff J M Gray sentenced one man at Dundee Sheriff Court to 40 days
imprisonment for stealing two pounds of sugar, and another for 14 days
for sexually assaulting a little girl.
The celebration of women getting the vote, in 1918, however, was a
hollow one. Let's put it in perspective. From 1885, voting in more than
one UK constituency was permitted to owners of land, occupiers of
business premises, and to university graduates. In 1918, when Scots
feminists planted the suffrage tree, the Representation of the People
Act had reduced the residence qualification to six months and
enfranchised some categories of men. Yes, it also enfranchised women,
but only those over 30. Given that female life expectancy was about 40
years, women couldn't hope to vote that often. It wasn't until 1928,
when the Equal Franchise Act lowered the voting age, that women could go
to the polls at 21. Then, in 1969, the Representation of the People Act
provided everyone with a vote as soon as they reached the age of 18. In
effect, women have not been trusted with the ballot until a mere 26
years ago, this writer's lifetime.
Eunice Murray was a terrific logician. In her pamphlet, Warrior Women,
1923, she said: ''We have always held, and hold now, that it is because
men and women are so different, and not because they are so alike, that
we require the vote. If man fulfills his duty to the nation -- by being
ready to sacrifice even his life for the nation -- woman equally
fulfills her part by being ready to sacrifice her life for the producing
of life. Thus each sex fulfills its obligation to the community. Each
women is a potential mother as each man is a potential defender of his
country.''
In Prejudices Old and New, again in 1923, she said: ''It is prejudice,
not reason, that has delayed the emancipation of women. Every step
forward has been won in spite of prejudice. It was prejudice which
excluded girls from good schools. It was prejudice that declared that
woman must not enter a hansom without a man to accompany her. It was
prejudice that prevented her going to a public swimming bath or even
bathing in the sea. (But) it is reason, not might, which should govern
the world.''
Eunice continues: ''If we study women's history for the last 50 years,
we find that what made their ultimate victory certain, was the unbarring
of university doors to them in 1869. Once a person can read and reason,
liberty and freedom follow in due course. Many arguments were produced
to demonstrate that to educate women would be an irreparable disaster.
With education, they would lose the feminine charms of docility, modesty
and delicacy.
Their brains were not made to grapple with the problems of theology,
mathematics, science or art, declared men, and more than one asserted
that were women allowed to compete with men in examinations, their
brains would give way under the strain.''
This is the laughable lore, the vague, woolly, self-serving images of
women the Scottish suffragettes were up against. They marched on
campaigns like bulldogs, at a time when fainting was considered a pretty
and feminine thing to do. They found themselves in opposition to other
women, the way some feminists might feel today, in arguing a case for
political empowerment against women who insist that there is no need.
The fear used to keep a woman in line was that if she proved herself
intellectually equal to a man, she would never get a husband. The man's
desire for a subordinate partner was never questioned, just the woman's
for asking why. The Scottish suffragettes were in combat with years of
conditioning. Eunice wrote of another female writer: ''She tells us that
'Nothing is so likely to conciliate the affection of the other sex as a
feeling that women look to them for guidance and support'.''
There were women who were brave enough to go their own way, unhindered
by threats from a sex for which they had no real respect. ''In 1869,
Miss Jex Blake sought to obtain a medical degree in Edinburgh
University,'' Eunice recounts. ''The opposition to this was as great as
the militant suffragette experiences in 1913. Yet in the year 1913 a
memorial tablet to Dr Sophia Jex Blake was erected in St Giles
Cathedral, Edinburgh. In 1869 she was told that to study anatomy was
impossible for a lady, and even to discuss the question was indelicate.
It was suggested that she wished to enter university to carry on
'flirtations and intrigues' with the students''.
The message was clear. In order to have an apology of a relationship,
to live in the shadow of men, and hope to be married off as a
subordinate, women had to hide their talents and subsume their
intelligence. It was too much to ask. Women wanted to establish
themselves as sentient beings, not decor. And even if it was at the cost
of being seen as ''feminine'', even if they were punished for their
efforts by being ignored by the hirsute sex, these were an insignificant
levy for intellectual and emotional freedom.
* The Women's Unit is keen to find out more about the suffragettes who
planted the tree, and about any descendants alive today. Although they
have managed to source some basic data, they would be pleased to receive
more information on Eunice Murray, Frances Melville, Louise Lumsden and
Chrystal MacMillan. If you can help, contact the Women's Unit on

Polyglot, n. one who speaks or writes many languages.
ACCORDING to the dictionary, the noun comes from the Greek words for
many and tongues. Horvath Laszlo, the very role model of the polyglot,
is familiar with its etymology. After all, he reads ancient Greek and
Latin.
True, the 26-year-old Hungarian, currently in Scotland on a British
Council-sponsored study trip, requires a dictionary to help him digest
the Classics. Hardly the stuff of which polygots are made, you might
think.
Well, you'd be wrong because ancient Greek and Latin come ninth and
tenth in Horvath Laszlo's league table of languages. In diminishing
degrees of competence -- to use his phrase -- he also speaks, after his
native Hungarian, Esperanto, English, Russian, German, Gaelic, Modern
Greek, and Polish.
Oh, and before we forget, he also has old Irish and Turkish. He is
sufficiently proficient to make conversation in, and read, the latter.
So languages are his speciality and they are the subject of his
studies in Scotland? Wrong again. Horvath is also something of a
polymath. He teaches economics -- in English -- in the college of
commerce and catering and the university of horticulture in Budapest.
From his base at Glasgow University he has been studying how economics
is taught in further and higher education in West of Scotland
institutions. He has also been taking the opportunity to buy books to
help him with the consuming passions, language and linguistics.
Horvath learned English from his father, also an economist who visited
Glasgow in 1978 and struck up a friendship with Dr Joe Latham, who then
taught in the department of political economy at the university.
The friendship has extended to both families and Horvath has been
staying in Glasgow with Dr Latham, who has since retired. ''I think it's
important to encourage people who show signs of real talent. I think
Horvath has real talent,'' Dr Latham said last week.
Such is the young Hungarian's flair for languages that he learned
Gaelic through English textbooks. Inevitably he had problems
understanding the tongue when he first heard it but Dr Latham sends him
tapes of Gaelic television and radio programmes which help with the
listening and speaking aspects of the language.
When he last visited Scotland he spent two weeks at the Gaelic college
in Skye, and found to his cost that learning from the Lewis
pronounciation wasn't much use when he was speaking to native speakers
from Argyll.
From an emotional point of view, Horvath is most attached to Gaelic.
Why? ''I was nine when my father came home with lots of materials about
Scotland. I immediately became interested in the country and decided
later to study this ancient language of the Scots. It stirred the
romantic soul of the young child,'' said Horvath.
Such stirrings are also being felt in Hungary, he maintained. The
country is experiencing the unhappy tensions which come with shaking off
communism, ditching tradition, and seeking to rush headlong into the
bright capitalist future.
But, said Horvath, more young Hungarians are becoming interested in
Celtology. ''Celtic is not just a Scottish thing. It was the first
European civilisation, the first pan-European culture. There are many
Celtic connections in history and Celtic knowledge is spreading.''
But how to disseminate that message further, and exploit the growing
interest in Gaelic and things Celtic? Well, it will come as no surprise
to learn that Horvath is heavily involved in the forthcoming
establishment of a centre of Celtology in Budapest.
In addition to lecturing in and researching economics, Horvath will
begin teaching Gaelic at Budapest University in September. His duties
will include teaching the reading of old Irish texts.
And where will he be based? In the Latin department, of course!

Moscow, Tuesday
RUSSIAN leaders reacted to the contract murder of a television star by
warning that organised crime had become so serious that it was
threatening state security.
President Boris Yeltsin and the powerful Security Council, which
groups the main law enforcement and defence chiefs, said no progress had
been noted in the fight against crime.
''This position discredits the power of the state, diminishes faith in
it, and threatens the national security of Russia,'' said the
presidential press service.
The council criticised the Interior Ministry, prosecutors, and secret
police for not doing enough to fight the criminal gangs running riot
across Russia.
The meeting was called after star television journalist Vladislav
Listyev was gunned down last Wednesday, the latest in a series of
killings which have undermined Russians' faith in the forces of law and
order. Police say they have few leads in the murder.
Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the lower house of Parliament and a member of
the council, said 75% of those responsible for serious crimes were still
at large.
''For a normal society these figures are intolerable,'' he said.
The presidential statement said the council had come up with a series
of proposals to make the crime fight more effective, but it gave no
details.
Listyev, 38, an ebullient personality who had become well known to 200
million viewers across the former Soviet Union, was in line to carry out
reforms of the state-run Ostankino television.
Many people suspect his death may have been linked to his plans for a
moratorium on multi-million-pound advertising on the new public channel.
The council blamed Parliament and the government for not doing enough
to stem the crime wave, which it said was particularly bad in Moscow.
Hours before the Council session began, Russian officials went ahead
with a recommendation by Yeltsin to remove the city's prosecutor,
Gennady Ponomaryov, and police chief Vladimir Pankratov.
However their dismissal set him on a collision course with Moscow's
mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, a potential rival to Yeltsin in 1996 presidential
elections.
Ponomaryov told independent NTV television that he had no idea why
Yeltsin thought order could be restored in Moscow simply by sacking him.
''Let's be honest -- crime will grow and we'll need the necessary
measures to fight it. These measures will take a lot of money and today
we are doing as much as we can,'' he said.
Liberals deeply suspicious of Yeltsin's intentions after the violent
campaign to quell Chechen independence fear he could try to exploit
Listyev's death to introduce authoritarian measures.
This would be popular with the nationalists whose votes he may need if
he hopes to win re-election.

Damages won from former Education Minister John Patten will form the
cornerstone of an appeal to launch the University of the First Age Fiona
Scott reports
PROFESSOR Tim Brighouse looked anxious when we reached the threshold
of his office. ''Oh, dear,'' he said. ''You must think I'm mad.''
This is the director of education who sued John Patten for libel and
won after the former Education Secretary branded him a ''nutter'' in
1993 and added a rude remark about him frightening children.
He won substantial damages, reputedly #15,000, from Mr Patten as well
as a ''humiliating apology'' in the High Court.
Now he wants to spend #20,000 on a project to capture the hearts and
minds of young adolescents in Birmingham whom he feels are let down by
the education system.
His so-called University of the First Age in Birmingham would
encompass all pupils in the first three years of secondary schooling in
the area and would have its own purpose-built campus on a council-owned
site already identified in Digbeth. It would include an auditorium where
children would be encouraged to debate the issues of the day, stretching
from local controversies to United Nations politics.
Pupils would attend two or three weeks a year during school holidays.
They would study subjects which gripped them, and learn at speed in
mixed age groups from inspirational teachers.
Back at school, they would keep in touch via distance learning courses
based on Open University models. Cable television computers and CD-Roms
would deliver lessons, initiating pupils onto the information
superhighway.
In the first year pupils would go on trips away from home to encourage
better pupil-teacher bonding.
''The target group for me is the 11, 12 and 13-year-olds,'' said Mr
Brighouse. ''It's then we're really losing them.''
He is looking for funding from multinational companies, educational
foundations, the public sector, even the National Lottery. The campus
will not rise without help from the Lottery's Millennium Fund. The
estimated cost of running the scheme using existing buildings is between
#4m and #8m a year in Birmingham. That translates to #160m for 20 cities
in Britain.
Mr Brighouse is determined to see the idea through, despite admitting
he can spend only a fraction of his time on it. He wants to invest his
personal money to get the idea off the ground. But he doesn't revel in
the irony of John Patten's money being put to such an unorthodox use.
Of the name-calling incident and his subsequent libel action, he said:
''It's an episode that reflects no credit on anyone, including me, so
I'd be delighted to give money to help people who at the moment seem to
me to have a pretty bad deal in life.''
He believes less than four out of every 10 secondary school pupils do
well out of the present system. He hopes the University of the First Age
would galvanise another four to open their minds to the rewards of
learning.
''You could narrow it to a small percentage that are at great risk but
I do honestly believe round about 50% of secondary school pupils in
those years need a different approach. They need an extra approach.''
Frank Pignatelli, Strathclyde region's director of education, fully
endorses the professor's aims.
''The philosophy which underpins it is spot-on. I keep telling my
staff that education is what's left when you've forgotten everything
you've learnt. More important than whether you remember your scientific
notation, or maths, or languages, is whether you are enterprising,
sensitive, caring, outward-looking and all that. A formal education
system doesn't help in that respect. You can have youngsters who get a
clutch of GCSEs or Highers and they are not articulate, not
inspirational, not confident and not imaginative.''
Strathclyde is spending about #1.5m a year on a supported study scheme
which gives youngsters from disadvantaged areas the opportunity to
return to school after hours to do supervised work.
But he fears it is not enough to reach children who are truly
disillusioned -- the kids who live in areas of high unemployment, whose
parents have perhaps never worked, who simply see no point in learning.
Prof Brighouse believes that as many as two out of every 10 pupils
fall into this category. But he will not give up. ''This proposal will
not mean 100% of young people succeeding in life. But it will mean there
is a substantial shift from 40% to maybe double that.
''For the cost of half a year's lottery winners we could double the
success of secondary education, increase the inventiveness of the
nation, substantially raise the aspirations of future generations and
give youngsters a real taste of young citizenship.
''If you are really saying that's expensive, just try ignorance. Don't
you agree?''

Brussels, Monday
THE European Union toughened its stance on Chechnya today by
postponing indefinitely the signing of a planned trade accord with
Russia.
EU Foreign Ministers instructed French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to
tell the Russian leadership during a visit later this week that they
needed clear signals on human rights before going ahead with the pact.
Mr Juppe, stressing that the EU supported the democratic reform
process in Russia, told reporters he would impress on Moscow the need
for it to follow international standards on human rights.
The Kremlin has reacted stiffly to previous suggestions in the West
that trade or aid should be used as leverage, saying Chechnya was a
purely domestic Russian matter.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who met Mr Juppe before the main EU
meeting, told reporters the EU move was not a sanction against Moscow:
''This is simply a postponement, we hope to see more progress on
Chechnya,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, is to meet President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday to put the
finishing touches to a multi-million-pound loan for Russia.
Mr Camdessus is expected to seek assurances that reforms will stay on
track and that Russia will stick to an anti-inflation budget.--Reuter.

Kabul, Monday
FOUR Britons are among 15 foreign relief workers trapped in a Red
Cross hospital in the Afghan capital Kabul after government forces
launched a dawn assault on an enclave held by Shi'ite Muslim militiamen.
Government jet fighters screamed across the city, making more than a
dozen bombing sorties against Shi'ite Hezb-i-Wahdat fighters who
retaliated with anti-aircraft fire.
Gunners loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani poured in rocket and
artillery fire from surrounding hills as the government began what a
Defence Ministry spokesman said would be a fight to the finish.
Spokesman Dr Abdullah said the government wanted to protect Kabul's
civilian population from Wahdat shelling.
Earlier, he said the government forces expected to fight until Wahdat
was defeated. ''We have taken a decision to clean out Hezb-i-Wahdat and
we are starting house-to-house fighting.''
Two rockets slammed into the Red Cross-supplied hospital in the Karte
Seh suburb, wounding several local staff, said a Red Cross official.
The fighting trapped thousands of civilians, along with 15 foreigners
working for the church-based relief agency International Assistance
Mission (IAM) in Karte Seh.
The foreigners, including the four Britons, were all sheltering in
basements and cellars, said the official.--Reuter.

Washington, Monday
THEY sit in a row in the dock, two brothers aged 16 and 18, and a
cousin of 18, three hulking teenagers with shaven skulls and a
compelling air of bovine stupidity, menace -- and vulnerability.
They have every reason to be nervous. The brothers are charged with
beating their parents and 11-year-old brother to death in Allentown,
Pennsylvania, the cousin with being an accessory to the crime.
The first impression they give, shuffling manacled legs into court, is
that these are very big young men.
Their appearance of stupidity may be an illusion, but is reinforced by
their tattoos. The 16-year-old, David Freeman, has BERZERKER, the name
of a rock band, tattooed on his forehead. His brother Bryan has the
words SIEG HEIL on his forehead and a swastika on his neck.
The three boys are reportedly followers of a Nazi cult in the region,
a spin-off of the Aryan Nation. The local chapter, if that is what it
is, is a white supremacist group with a particular loathing for Jews.
None of this explains why David and Bryan Freeman allegedly beat their
parents and brother to death. Their parents were Jehovah's Witnesses,
and the boys rebelled against the relative strictness of their
upbringing.
Their mother was living in fear of her sons and had asked for help
from various local authorities, including the Jewish anti-Defamation
League, but none of those to whom she appealed appreciated how extreme
the danger was.
The boys were arrested in Michigan a week after the murders. Their
lawyers are trying to prevent their extradition to Pennsylvania which,
unlike Michigan, has the death penalty.
Four days after the Freeman murders, another couple were found beaten
to death, four miles away. Their son, also a skinhead, has been
arrested.
News reports say that the final episode that may have prompted the
murder was when the boys' father confiscated Bryan's car, and sold it.
The two brothers then had their foreheads tattooed. The murders occurred
two weeks later.
There has been a sudden increase in neo-Nazi militancy in central
Pennsylvania, whose industries were closed down in the mid-80s.

In reply to last week's call for a standard Scots to be used in
classrooms, Stuart McHardy argues in favour of teachers using the
language children bring to school as the way forward for the Scots
language
LAST week on this page David Purves set out a case for using Standard
Scots based on literary sources to teach the auld leid, the mither
tongue of the majority of Scots. His article was timely, because things
are looking up for Scots, particularly with the forthcoming Scottish
Language Project in the 5-14 curriculum.
Mr Purves raised the issue of Standard Scots but I'm afraid there are
several reasons for not adopting the approach of using the literary
canon to develop a new standard. One of the most important questions
such an approach raises is, who exactly would decide what the standard
should be?
Although we at The Scots Language Resource Centre have received
welcome government support over the past year, there is no way that I
can foresee us having the resources to set up the kind of body that I
assume he was thinking of. If we are to have a standard set, it will
have to involve a great deal of discussion amongst a wide variety of
people including academic linguists, educationalists, and language
practitioners.
That would be time-consuming and expensive and, with the limited
resources currently available for Scots language development work, gey
difficult. There are other objections to creating a Standard Scots based
on our literary heritage that go to the heart of what we mean when we
talk about Scots. As Liz Niven, Scots Language Specialist for Dumfries
and Galloway region's education department put it: ''A vital element
missing in Mr Purves' article is that we're not talking about marching
through Scottish schools teaching the bairns how to speak Scots. The
vast majority already do.
''What we're talking about is recognising that they do and, as
suggested in the 5-14 guidelines, helping them to be confident and
creative in the language. The Scottish Language Project is based on the
idea of respecting the language bairns bring to school -- for sound
linguistic and educational reasons -- so we must deal with the dialects
the children are using.''
Despite their lack of specific training, Mrs Niven finds that many
teachers are enthusiastic about teaching Scots, and that their
enthusiasm is shared by pupils. At the moment the best use of resources
is in supporting the Scottish Language Project which, of course, applies
equally to Gaelic.
Obviously most of the material will be based on literature. We have an
abundance of poetry, an increasing amount of drama is being written into
Scots, and perhaps the problem regarding prose is not as bad as Mr
Purves' article suggested. A great deal of Scots prose was written in
magazines and other periodicals in the second half of last century.
Quite a few of the writers involved went on to have collections of their
articles published and though now gey auld, they might provide the kind
of prose model Mr Purves suggested was necessary.
But the problem remains the shortage of work done on Scots over the
past century. Although we have an increasing number of texts available
for the primary sector and for the expanding interest in our secondary
schools, there are many unanswered questions. We do need an established
grammar but this will come in time. We're entering a new era as far as
the auld leid is concerned and we must ca cannie. The universities will
gladly carry out any work necessary but for now their hands are tied
because of a lack of resources.
One particular point bothers me. If we use literature as the basis of
setting a Standard Scots, how modern are we to be? Despite their
commercial success, I am not sure the works of James Kelman or Irvine
Welsh would be welcomed in our secondary classrooms and certainly not in
our primaries. Their work, too, like much of Scotland's historic
literature is grounded in dialect. Again, who would decide what was
acceptable and what was not?
We are at the dawn of major new developments for Scots and we maun
learn tae walk afore we cin run. What has been grand over the past
couple of years is the way that all the organisations concerned with
Scots have been working together and in the main agreeing on the way
forward.
For the meantime that is through supporting the development of the
Scottish Language Project in the 5-14 curriculum while stimulating the
growing interest in Scots language and literature in our secondary
schools. Recent developments in the examination curricula suggest that
this, too, is an area of growth for Scots. As David Purves said last
week, a serious start has been made and gin we aa tak oor time, an mak
siccar we aye speak tae each ither, we'll get tae whaur we want tae be.
One last point -- at the SLRC we recommend the use of the spelling
guidelines suggested by the Scottish National Dictionary which allow for
variations in dialect. A copy of these guidelines can be obtained from
The Scots Language Resource Centre, A.K. Bell Library, 2-8 York Place,
Perth, PH2 8EP.
Stuart McHardy is the director of The Scots Language Resource Centre.

How do you find the New Graduate without nationally agreed standards?
Gordon Wallace (below), director of the Centre for Training and
Enterprise at Glasgow College of Building and Printing, identifies this
as a key American problem as he returns from an exchange visit to
Chicago's McHenry County College
AT the entrance to McHenry County College, a banner proclaims this to
be ''The Home Of The Fighting Scots''. Further in, I discover a
publication called Bagpipes and the college newspaper called Tartan.
Understandably, I sometimes wonder where I am exactly . . . Inverness or
Illinois?
Then the accents around me confirm that this is indeed the American
Mid-West. Here, classes can begin at 7am and teachers need work no more
than 15 hours a week to fulfil their contracts. The college has an arts
theatre, a conference centre, a children's learning unit, and a
manicured look about it which belies its 25 years of existence.
I wander outside to watch a baseball game. Beyond the campus, a
prairie of khaki-coloured wheat awaits the blows of a combine harvester.
It's a place that McHenry -- a hero of the War of Independence -- would
surely have approved of.
Next day. I'm in a yellow cab speeding through Chicago en route to a
major conference on the School To Work programme. School To Work (which
will involve both secondary and post-secondary institutions like
McHenry) is one of the few qualified successes of the faltering Clinton
administration. It is being put forward as the means of re-defining
vocational edcuation throughout the US, and the support of American
industry, which is demanding changes to the way people are prepared for
work, ensured the programme's safe passage through Congress.
Seventy-odd yeas of provision is to be given a shakedown, and the
barriers between federal, state and local interests are expected to
tumble. School To Work is described as collaborative, flexible,
innovative, and entrepreneurial -- terms which will be familiar to the
ears of Scotland's FE institutions. And indeed Scotland might be seen as
being ahead of the game. The need to survive the brutal amputation of
traditional industries was our Armageddon and may yet prove aetiological
to those across the Atlantic.
America needs a new type of college graduate, who is more readily
employable in a hi-tech economy; and McHenry County will be expected to
provide.
Over the conference lunch-table, however, I ask how this is to be
achieved in a land which refuses to have nationally agreed standards of
competency. There follows a great rustling of napkins and swallowing of
tonic water. ''I would regard that as a step backwards,'' one college
president manages eventually'' . . . indeed, I would shudder at the very
thought.''
And this becomes a recurring feature of my 14-day study visit to
Illinois . . . tension between a liberal arts approach to vocational
education and those who see economic regeneration in terms of a
more-customised generation of employees. I mention the $213bn which US
industry invests every year in training its workforce and how a mere 3%
of this ever finds its way into colleges because the prevailing view is
that colleges are not updated enough to deliver what is wanted. But the
president is not for shifting.
I sense he has opted for the incremental approach to change, and
return to the conference hall feeling that he will have a few major
questions to address pretty soon -- especially if his college has
designs on the funding available under the School To Work programme.
Back at McHenry College, however, an intriguing variation of this
theme is preoccupying staff and administration alike. Within a year, the
giant Motorola company will have opened a plant in the county, employing
upwards of 5000 people. The effect will be to siphon-off the best
employees from surrounding businesses with packages which offer enhanced
hourly rates and health insurance. At a meeting of the Small-Business
Advisory Board, I am told by one company proprietor that this could
spell disaster for his fledgling electronics firm.
''I just won't be able to compete,'' he says, ''and will be stuck with
choosing from second-rank graduates.'' Oddly, he seems totally unaware
that McHenry Colelge offers a student-employment service -- an agency
that will advise employers regarding the suitability of graduates for
vacant posts in industry.
Happy to return some of the hospitality, I lead him off at the close
of the meeting, and introduce him to a woman who runs the agency. Later,
I observe him scanning the bulletin board, open notepad in hand.
But the incident continues to bother me. McHenry, like most US
colleges, operates an open management style, one grounded on trust (the
word is encountered everywhere) and where possession of information is
not seen as power. Yet the way freely-distributed information is made
use of often falls short of the ideal.
Upstairs in the College Foundation -- a unit established to supplement
income through industry donations, gifts, and endowments -- I find they
have little understanding of the work that is already going on in
forming links between other college departments and the local business
community.
Indeed, they seem to suggest that this is of no concern to them, and
that the foundation deals only with the captains of industry, leaving
others to do business with distinctly lower levels of company
management. It is an elitist approach which I sense causes friction and
can only act to the detriment of success.
And at another meeting, I again encounter an instance of how valuable
information fails to have the impact it might have in Scotland. A member
of staff from the Automotive section quietly ruminates on the outcomes
of a recent survey about business developments in the county over the
next 10 years. He talks about projected growth patterns, population
shifts, what skills will be needed and which won't, and a host of other
things which I would perceive as being vital to the future of the
college. Yet no one picks up on any of these points.
The discussion frequently drifts off into more immediate things,
including tomorrow's Day Against Drugs event in the college gymnasium.
Afterwards, I express the view that those who have a regard for
necessary change in American education, are still to have their day. The
guy from Automotive looks interested. I feel he knows it won't be too
long in coming.

SHE may not exactly be an impartial observer but Seona Reid, director
of the Scottish Arts Council, summed it up perfectly: ''What is unique
about the arts, and people's experience of them, is that sometimes a
performance or painting can bypass the brain and go straight to the
heart.''
SAC will shortly advertise the new post of education officer, to take
forward the five principles of its policy on education:
* To promote the breadth and diversity of the arts
* Strengthen the relationship between the arts, education and society
* Create an understanding of the value of arts
* Encourage people to use the arts for their own development
* Make the arts more accessible.
The new post appears at a critical time. Resource packs to support the
Scottish Office's 5-14 Guidelines on the expressive arts are now in
schools. The council's director of planning and development, Christine
Hamilton, says: ''The guidelines present marvellous opportunities. They
recommend that at least 15% of the primary school timetable should be
devoted to the expressive arts -- music, drama, art and design, and mime
and dance aspects of physical education. In secondary schools, the
figure is 10%, plus 5% for PE.''
These percentages do not reflect the reality of life in the primary
school, where the arts are integrated into the curriculum and are often
used to teach other subjects. The commitment of the classroom teacher is
paramount, since specialist support to the schools -- though it varies
across authorities -- is generally fairly sparse. The exception is music
-- for instance, Strathclyde region employs 250 instrumental
instructors, and Fife runs eight orchestras. On the other hand,
specialists in drama and dance are relatively few in number.
SAC will therefore continue to advocate the recognition of the arts in
education, partly through the employment of specialists, more so through
staff development for teachers. It will go on promoting activity in
schools through such initiatives as the popular writers in residence
programme, the school tours undertaken by its travelling gallery, and
its outreach projects in the performing arts. It will continue to fund
arts organisations which work with schools and colleges, such as Theatre
About Glasgow, Theatre Workshop, Scottish Ballet and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra.
It will urge local authorities to consolidate central arts budgets and
specialist arts officers to retain a policy overview. In this it is
quick to acknowledge a potentially serious problem.
Local government reform will lead to smaller unitary authorities with
less flexibility to sustain expensive central services. Already special
educational needs, advisory and psychological services feel under
threat, and this concern applies equally to central arts provision.
Christine Hamilton says: ''The experience in England has been
disastrous. For example, theatre in education work has been more or less
destroyed.'' On the positive side, she sees the bringing together of
education, leisure and museum services offering the new councils the
opportunity to take a strategic view.
The devolved school management scheme to pass major financial
responsibilities to schools becomes mandatory next year and likewise
poses a threat to the arts in education. Headteachers may not see
spending in this area as a priority. They may be tempted to buy the
cheapest rather than the best, and arts organisations may not be able to
cope with the burden of dealing with individual schools rather than
authorities.
However, the council takes the optimistic view that the good
relationship which schools enjoy with visiting arts groups and the
impact of the 5-14 guidelines will work to the benefit of the expressive
arts.
Its new education officer will have the remit to set up in each area a
regional forum which will bring together arts organisations, teachers,
and local authorities. The post will also carry responsibility for
initiating research and recommending pilot projects which the council
might fund.
''It is an evangelical role,'' says Christine Hamilton. ''The
successful applicant will probably have extensive experience in
education at a strategic level and must have a wide knowledge of the
arts in Scotland. We will develop our dialogue with schools and
colleges, and harness the resources of organisations like TAG, which are
so good at bringing teachers together and broadening their expertise. It
is a relatively small investment which could reap an enormous amount of
benefit.''
It is a coincidence that the council is taking this initiative at a
time of such ferment, since the creation of the post is merely the
latest step in implementing its educational policy. However, the post
now carries with it multiple expectations as well as opportunities. The
expressive arts have reached the educational crossroads. The hope must
be that they will not be forced to turn round and retrace their steps.

SHE works as marketing manager for Applied Sweepers based in Falkirk
-- but Meriel Watson now lives in Germany, writes Sue Coutts.
Her career success mirrors that of a new mentoring programme produced
by the Trade Development Centre -- also in Falkirk -- and her language
course was just one component of a post-graduate programme (Post
Graduate Exporting for the Small Business) run by the Scottish
Enterprise Foundation at Stirling University.
It has been running for five years. Alongside a 17-week academic
course there is also a 22-week placement make-up. About 25% of the
students go on to take full-time employment in the firm they were placed
with. Although placements are taken up throughout the UK, the emphasis
is in Scotland, across all industry sectors.
The Trade Development Centre has been involved in the programme since
September. Its chief executive, John Gillies, was aware of the course
and, feeling that more could be done locally, stepped in to help
Stirling University market the programme to surrounding companies and to
develop long-term relationships with local business.
The first students the TDC is involved with placing will graduate this
summer and, besides marketing the idea to firms throughout the Forth
Valley area, it also helps financially, subsidising half the placement
costs -- #1250.
Watson is convinced the move on to the course improved her marketing
skills and boosted her job prospects. The course, which she took in its
very early days, was aimed at students with fluent languages (she has
German and French) and covered one month of intensive seminars in
international marketing, financial management and market research.
An important element was a five-month placement with a company in
Scotland. Following this, she was offered a full-time position with
Applied Sweepers. Now her job is not just in the German marketplace --
Applied Sweepers has subsidiaries in Austria and Switzerland, plus
projects in Sweden, Poland, Thailand and Malta. She also works with the
distributors in these countries.
The overall objective of the course was to promote the export of
Scottish products within the European and international marketplace.
Watson has been working at the German subsidiary of Applied Sweepers
from 1993. She is pleased to have had the opportunity to work for a
company exceptionally active in the export market: ''When I joined, 15%
of our machines were sold to the export market; this year 50% of our
machines are exported.''
She feels the job is now very challenging -- it includes deciding
which key exhibitions and seminars to attend, and where to advertise the
product.
Robin Gilbert, course director at Stirling University, says: ''We get
applicants of a very high standard . . . more than 50 applied last
year.'' Plans are now on-line to upgrade the course to an MSc, on which
Gilbert has recently written a paper. He adds: ''There is a demand for
the course both from companies wanting students and from the students.
''We are seeking to increase the performance of smaller firms in
European markets. At present we are looking for manufacturing companies
employing up to 100 people.
''This country produces a surplus of language graduates but they
haven't the relevant qualifications or experience to pick up jobs in
industry and commerce.
''With the small to medium enterprise sector under-performing in the
export sector, our idea was to put the two together -- take linguists,
bolt on an export marketing training, and put them in a workplace. This
way you are using the students to train the managers.''
Other universities moving into this market now include Napier in
Edinburgh and Strathclyde which run an international marketing MBA.
Of her future, Meriel Watson says: ''Wherever I work, I would like to
be in an export environment where I can use my language skills,
integrate with a foreign culture, and contribute towards a successful
export operation.
''By doing the course I had the chance to work with a very
export-oriented company. In 1993 our export turnover was #90,000 while
in 1994 it was #1.4m. This year it's #2.7m.''

Reggio di Calabria, Monday
FORMER Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, testifying as a
defence witness today, denied ever meeting a leading Mafia boss.
The trial in this Calabrian city, for the 1991 murder of Appeals Court
Judge Antonio Scopelliti, is unrelated to the case in Palermo, Sicily,
where Andreotti was indicted last week on charges of having ties with
the Mafia. His trial is scheduled to begin on September 26.
Andreotti testified for 10 minutes as a witness by lawyers for
Salvatore ''Toto'' Riina, the reputed Mafia ''boss of bosses''. Riina
and other reputed top mobsters allegedly ordered Scopelliti's killing.
Scopelliti had been assigned to hear the final appeal of convictions
of hundreds of Mafiosi in the so-called ''maxi-trial'' of 1986-1987 in
Rome. The prosecution maintains that the judge was killed to cause
enough delay in the case to force the defendants' release from jail.
A Mafia turncoat who is a key witness against Riina testified that
Andreotti had met with a mob boss. The boss, Stefano Bontade, supposedly
told the politician that while the government might be in power in Rome,
the Mafia ruled in Sicily.
The defence called Andreotti apparently in an attempt to undermine the
credibility of the turncoat.
CATANIA: Mafia hitmen shot dead four men in as many hours today,
brining to nine the number of killings in 10 days. Three victims died in
an ambush at Catania, eastern Sicily. A fourth man was killed in
Palermo. Last week five people were killed in Mafia-style murders around
the capital Palermo including two in Corleone, Riina's home town.
Earlier police captured susp-ected local clan boss Venerando
Cristaldi, who had been on the run since December 1993 from charges of
drugs trafficking, extortion, and usury.--AP/Reuter.

The much-maligned YTS programme has a new look and new name but has it
improved? Nick Cowie finds some signs of promise.
IT'S got a snappy name, and you get a smart looking credit card as
well but is Skillseekers, the successor to the Youth Training Scheme any
more than a glossy paint job on YTS and another way to massage the
employment statistics?
The scheme is about to go nationwide in Scotland and the country's 16
to 18-year-olds will deliver their own verdict in due course.
But after being piloted by some of the local enterprise companies
including GDA, Renfrewshire, Dunbartonshire and Ayrshire, the signs are
that among employers, teachers and most importantly school leavers that
the wall of cynicism which surrounded YTS is being broken down.
It gives youngsters real money, typically around #2,000 a year on a
Skillseekers credit card to spend on the training they want. More
importantly it gives them the right to withhold payment if the training
does not meet standards.
The aim is to help employers meet the skill needs of the future
workforce, keep Scotland competitive -- and help young people meet their
career aspirations. The progress of each trainee is watched closely by
the local enterprise companies and the training providers -- mostly
employers -- have to satisfy quality milestones before they are paid.
Dunbartonshire Enterprise, the first LEC to pilot a training credit
card based system, has been monitoring performance since they started
running Skillseekers alongside YTS in April 1993. Currently they have
1835 Skillseekers in training and just one left on YTS.
Two statistics stand out. One is that despite the increasing trend of
staying on at school after the age of 16, more young people are using
Skillseekers than used YTS -- there was an increase of 300 in the past
12 months.
The second, and most notable, is that almost half -- 47% -- have full
employee status with the companies they are training with, that compares
with under a third of youngsters on the old YTS scheme.
A high proportion of the rest are expected to get jobs when they have
completed their two years training stint.
And they are aiming higher: 42% are aiming for a level three SVQ --
compared to 32% under YTS.
Dunbartonshire Enterprise's HRD (Human Resource Development) manager
Jim McAloon who has steered Skillseekers through two pilot years says:
''The difference between Skillseekers and YTS is that it empowers the
youngsters. If youngsters didn't like YT they left and we didn't hear
about it.
''Now we hear about it and do something about it. The progress of
every single Skillseeker is monitored by my staff. If a youngster has a
problem, then they have the right not to hand over their card which is a
transaction of payment. That does happen with our firm backing.''
But he admits that there are remnants of criticism left over from the
YTS scheme. Undoubtedly there are still those who see Skillseekers as a
glossy paint job -- or even as a means to get cheap labour.
But McAloon argues: ''The youngsters are not daft. They wouldn't be
coming on board in such numbers if they didn't think there was a chance
of getting good training and a good foot on the career ladder -- if it
is a paint job we are fooling an awful lot of people.''
But what about the customers? Like every school leaver in her area,
Jacqui Bathgate, 16, was given her Skillseekers card by a teacher at
Clydebank High School when she left last December. She nursed an
ambition, but perhaps not too much hope, of becoming a fitness
instructor.
Meanwhile in Gray's Gym in the Clydebank shopping centre Gillian Gray
wondered what help she could get to train a youngster to work with the
growing number of customers in the gym as well as help out on reception
and sales. The LEC and the careers service brought the two together.
Gillian said; ''I hadn't really heard of Skillseekers. I found out
about it while I was asking the local enterprise company about something
else.''
Jacqui, is paid a wage like any other employee. From April there will
be a minimum payment #40 a week for a Skillseeker, but in fact 85% are
currently paid more than that by employers, usually at the rate for the
job.
Jacqui said: ''It's worked out great for me. A lot of young people
like me thought that YTS was just a waste of time. But this gives me
control over my training and solves the problem of not being able to get
a job without training -- and not being able to get the training without
getting a job.''
She is currently working towards an SVQ level two in Sports and
Recreation. It is just one of the 260 different qualifications currently
available. Her training is done at the gym and assessed regularly by a
visiting member of staff from Bells College in Hamilton.
Some employers are still critical of the way Skillseekers is being
sold. Despite a video made for schools starring the very street ''cred''
Craig Ferguson, Isobel MacQueen who runs an air conditioning supply
company in Bishopbriggs believes that too many youngsters do not use
their cards effectively.
''We have three young employees who have been encouraged to use their
Skillseekers cards. It is a guarantee to us and to them of a quality of
training. Yet I am sure that far too many get them when they leave
school and put them in a drawer, '' she said.
''If they had gone to university or college they would be entitled to
free education and perhaps a grant. But for many that route is not
suitable. Skillseekers gives the rest a similar level of government aid
allowing them to work and be trained. For me it means I get a better
trained and more able staff. Yet I wonder how many employers know about
the scheme.''
Typical is one of the company's skillseekers, Lynn Fleming who
recently left school. She gets training on the job plus a day away at
college every week where she is studying for a level three SVQ in
information technology.
And do the teachers feel they can reassure sceptical parents that
their non academic offspring would in fact be far better off leaving and
training through the Skillseekers option?
Statistics show that around 40% of pupils who return to take Highers
won't pass them, and while many are encouraged to take SCOTVEC modules
instead, the fact remains that over the past decade there has been a
turnaround from just a quarter of pupils staying on after the age of 16
to the position now when only a quarter of them leave.
''We'd like to think that is because academic standards have improved.
The truth of course is that most are staying on because there are no
jobs for them to go to,'' says Colin O'Brien, headteacher at Clydebank
High School.
''I happen to believe that staying on another year is a good thing,
but Skillseekers is a real option we can offer parents and children. And
even if they do stay on, Skillseekers doesn't go away, the option
doesn't close because you are 17 or 18. I can and do recommend it to
parents. It is more professional and a lot more supportive than earlier
options.''
And at Dunbartonshire Enterprise, Jim McAloon answers the inevitable
question with a firm nod: ''I would certainly encourage any son or
daughter of mine to use a Skillseeker programme. The proof is there.
It's been shown that it gives youngsters the tools to get into their
careers.''
The report card so far on Skillseekers would seem to show a promising
start -- but as the scheme goes nationwide it will be subject to more
detailed scrutiny -- especially from Scotland's youngsters who, as Jim
McAloon succinctly puts it, are not daft.

SUDDENLY, for some pale and sedentary people, at the end of the month,
in Edinburgh, for an entire weekend, it will be spring.
More sensibly than seasonably, the event will be held indoors. Every
other year it doesn't happen at all. But this spring will be sprung. For
bookish enthusiasts a three-day bonanza in an old hotel amounts to their
bank of daffodils.
After a long winter of burning scholarly oil, they will emerge from
their dens to exchange old lamps for even more old lamps at a biennial
fair of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association.
On even years the antiquaries gather in Bath. They seem to be people
who have a sense of style about where they meet and when. As to their
craft, the sense it makes is of mystery. They adopt the camouflage of
shy and retiring creatures who naturally inhabit the sheltered burrows
of secondhand books even when it is not raining outside.
They cherish -- and damn the expense -- early editions as if first
pages somehow make the most enriching reads. And they prefer volumes
that through thick and thin have retained their crumbling dust covers.
They do not accept that jackets are dressed-up salesmanship by
publishers.
More awkwardly exists the cussed conundrum that, whereas Glasgow
boasts all of nine secondhand shops, Edinburgh has only l7.
On top of those puzzles accumulate layers of money. Abundant readies
are involved in the business. They make an innocent bystander even more
bewildered. For instance, it appears that a first edition of Anna
Sewell's Black Beauty has gone at auction for #8000. Right enough, it
was the copy given by the writer to her sister. But philistines wonder
why not just wait to see the film.
To be led by the hand into this strange world where money either
matters much or hardly at all a gentle guide is Scottish Book Collector
magazine. It is one of those small, sensitive, almost secretive
publications that give journalism a good name.
Its founder, editor, and proprietor are the same. She has a staff of
one -- herself. Jennie Renton is her own advertising executive. She
handles circulation. If a photo needs to be taken, she takes it. She has
been seen doing deliveries, towing a shopping pram between bookshops.
Her magazine's big-money news she leaves to a contributor called
Anobium Punctatum. Crudely translated from a Latin dictionary, it comes
out as furniture beetle. Possibly, the pen-name is intended to disguise
some kind of book worm.
The lush saleroom loam he burrows into includes the recent #5625
purchase of a three-volume Encyclopaedia Britannica replete with bang
up-to-date learning -- up to l77l, that is.
A solitary non-book item in his column records that the black dingus
used in The Maltese Falcon (l941) picture has fetched #230,770 at a New
York sale.
As with any other shopping feature what most brightens the blank eye
of a dim reader is that magic sign BARGAIN. The current issue celebrates
the find in a Bournemouth shop of a copy of T S Eliot's Prufrock and
Other Observations. An alert young student who picked it up for #l.50
passed it on for #l600.
''When you go into a bookshop you have to believe that there might be
something marvellously valuable on a shelf,'' Jennie Renton said. ''If
you believe it, you'll see it.''
She was not talking money. If possessions much interested her, there
would never have been a Scottish Book Collector. To keep her magazine
going involved the commercial irony of selling her own book collection,
mainly of nineteenth-century children's works, to invest in a word
processor.
For seven excitingly lean years there has been a survival worth
saluting. Explaining it, however, she insists is beyond her. ''It is a
mixture of luck and personality and things I don't understand,'' she
said. ''I had the confidence of ignorance. The reason I could do it was
I hadn't the foggiest idea what I was doing.''
She edits on foot. On book business she flits petitely about
Edinburgh's learned cobbled alleys in tiny red pixie boots, hauling with
her the makings of the next issue in a shoulder bag that would topple a
lumberjack.
''I can get people going,'' she conceded. ''But I don't direct what
they contribute. My part is to bring disparate things together, while
keeping the fulcrum on book collecting and secondhand books.''
Just so, but the February-March issue has also the start of a campaign
to support a museum of printing in Edinburgh, an interview with novelist
Iain Banks, a long letter of rebuke from a reader, reviews of new books,
and a short story, along with free ads from subscribers whose lives will
be incomplete until they can buy an Oor Wullie Annual or a jigsaw of the
Titanic.
She befriends books against common abuse that they make lumpy
companions, collect dust, and take up inordinate space in the homestead.
''Televisions collect dust,'' she retorted.
With elfin sprightliness she rushed to the aid of the Bournemouth
bookseller who knows so much he let go that #l600 T S Eliot for 30 bob.
''I just think he is a human being. He can't be on the ball all the
time,'' Jennie Renton said. ''Why should he know everything?''

<HEADLINE>Poverty conference opens with warning of indifference</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Copenhagen, Monday
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned on its opening day
that an international poverty conference already risked running aground
on indifference.
''The problem of the United Nations is to cope with donor fatigue,
conference fatigue,'' he said at the opening of the week-long meeting.
''Fatigue will provide something more dangerous, which is
indifference,'' he said. ''Our goal is to show we are all of the same
community. We must help each other.''
Behind closed doors, delegates at the 183-nation meeting argued over
setting up a fund to help eradicate poverty.
''There's a lot of disagreement,'' said Prakash Shah, India's
permanent UN representative. ''We're disappointed that no decision has
been made on additional resources to help developing countries.''
A proposed call for ''new and additional'' aid is among the most
contentious. US delegates said privately they would not accept a
commitment to giving more money to poorer nations.
However an influential caucus of more than 130 developing countries
signalled that it would fight for such promises.
The emerging confrontation did not bode well for agreement on concrete
action in the summit's final document, to be signed on Sunday by nearly
120 leaders, including German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and US Vice
President Al Gore.
The United Nations says success at the poverty summit should be
measured in the convergence of ideas, rather than hard commitments, as
it strives to justify the #17.5m assembly amid calls for cutbacks in its
own organisation.
''One of the purposes of this conference is to keep the world awake,''
Boutros-Ghali said. ''Our problem is how to maintain public interest in
a new culture which wants quick images and has no time for the long
term.''
Boutros-Ghali said 1.3 billion people -- more than one in four --
lived in poverty and 1.5 billion had no access to basic health care. The
gap between rich and poor has doubled since 1960.
However summit was tinged with an air of futility, compounded by the
absence of key leaders, notably US President Clinton and John Major.
Among the debates, the message from the United Nations and wealthy
countries was that poorer nations must take care of themselves.
''In industrialised countries, we know that this summit will only
herald few changes. In the poor countries, they want to be heard and
it's these groups we have to help,'' said French Health Minister Simone
Veil.
Germany's Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, Norbert Bluem, added
that any progress will take time.
''The world will not have changed much by Monday,'' he said.--AP.

THE debate about a future common European currency may be damaging the
British Conservative Party all the time it goes on, but its theoretical
dimension is underlined by yesterday's Spanish and Portuguese
devaluations. Few members of the EU could actually participate in such a
currency were the option available now. Those who fear the EU could, for
such purposes, divide in two, with fast and slower tracks must think
again: there are now three distinct monetary blocs within the Union. The
indisputable fast movers are Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and
Luxemburg. France and Belgium would like to be in the same position but
their currencies do not fully endorse the aspiration. Not matter how
much the thought might enrage them, they are not much better placed than
the UK and Denmark. Ireland and Sweden are not very different either.
The real slow lane would include Iberia and Greece and, possibly, even
Italy whose present position is distinctly worrying. This is really too
wide a spectrum to meet the Maastricht hopes, without even thinking of
the potential central and east European entrants.
The case for a common currency remains strong, but there should be
nothing unthinkable about its being achieved by gradualism, except that
it is not really clear that popular support for it really exists, even
in the fast-track movers. There would, for example, be no reason why the
fast-track movers should not adopt a single currency once the immediate
practicalities were overcome. Nothing, except for the fact that the
Germans would not want anything inferior to the mark, which is simply
the strongest European currency available; while the others would not
want to surrender their own existing currencies to the mark -- and
though they might settle for the Ecu, the Germans might not. Yet this
core contains all those who could make the transition without much pain.
Middle-track members could possibly bear the pain -- France and Belgium
would certainly want to try -- but the third track could not, which is
why some suspect that the currency issue could seriously damage the
Union unless it is handled carefully. The problems involved are not
beyond our experience, for the reunification of Germany showed the
enormous streses attendant on mismatched economies moving to a single
currency even on generous assumptions of help for the weaker partner.
An alternative gradualist approach would resurrect an idea of Nigel
Lawson's, originally derided, whereby all the currencies could be
tendered legally for transactions in all the member states. In practice
the major currencies would dominate, but usage would eventually favour
the preferred currency (almost certainly the mark). Computer systems,
now very widespread in all monetary activities from retailers to
bankers, make this possibility real. As for the exchange costs, they
could be absorbed by the financial businesses which carry them out at
present for little more than the cost of sterling transactions. The
biggest proponents of a common currency are the banks and other big
financial institutions, and they already are aware that it will cost a
lot. They also know that exchange costs are, normally, very low, though
no-one would believe that from the charges actually imposed. All of that
ignores political consequences, but backers of a common currency have
already looked these in the eye, and not blinked.

MR Tony Blair is a cautious man. If he were to walk across a swamp he
would let someone else, probably Mr John Major, walk ahead. Now that Mr
Major has lost his footing and is sinking up to his oxters in the
Euroswamp, Mr Blair is picking his way adroitly from tussock to tussock.
The problem with this level of caution, and the strategy of letting
everyone else make fools of themselves because they are so good at it,
is that policy is not best made that way. If Mr Major and Mr Blair could
sit down together and discuss their innermost feelings on Europe with
candour and honesty, it is most likely that they would agree on a great
deal. The Maastricht Social Chapter would be a source of argument but on
most other issues, including the establishment of a single currency once
the demands of economic convergence were met, it is probably that there
would be significant areas of agreement. The paradox of British politics
at the moment is that Mr Blair can say all this publicly, and he did
last week in the Commons debate, but Mr Major dare not do so for fear of
destroying his riven party and his own position.
This is all very fortunate for Mr Blair, despite the Euro-sceptics in
his own party. He can unpick Mr Major's position at will, but he has
developed the curious habit of using the baiting of the Prime Minister
as the context in which to develop and announce his own policies. Thus,
we had Mr Blair setting five questions for the Prime Minister in the
Commons last week, all of which were meant to illustrate the splits
between Tory right and left-wingers in Cabinet. In the course of
questioning the Prime Minister Mr Blair announced that Labour would
commit Britain to a single currency if the economic conditions were
right. In subsequent questions we learned that Mr Blair does not see any
constitutional threat in a single currency, nor any danger of it leading
to a federal Europe or loss of essential power from Parliament. It is
good to know this, but it would be preferable to have the information
given to us as part of a coherent and properly enunciated Labour Party
policy on Europe, rather than discovering Mr Blair's beliefs in the
course of a Commons knock-about. Once more, we return to the theme that
Labour may gain support by letting the Tories continue to shoot their
toes off, but that this is no substitute for simple exposition of Labour
policy.
Matters are not much better when we come to consider Scotland and
Europe. The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, assures us
that Scotland's relationship with Europe need not always be through
Westminster. Warming to this theme recently, he implied that a Scottish
parliament would be in precisely the same relationship to the European
Council of Ministers as the state parliaments in Germany. This sounds
intriguing, and exciting. The German Lander have considerable autonomous
power and are highly influential in the workings of the European Union.
The problem with these happy thoughts is that Germany is
constitutionally a federal state of which the Lander are an integral
part. Labour Party policy as we understand it does not envisage turning
Britain into a federal state. If Mr Robertson really believes that a
devolved Scotland, with a parliament which will still be granted
whatever powers it has by Westminster, can aspire to the power of the
Lander he must tell us how this can be achieved. Again, we need to know
the detail of Labour policy, and the sooner the better.

YOUR editorial tells us that ''we should never forget that the
Scottish people did, in the referendum of 1979, vote specifically for
change'' (February 24).
Had ''the Scottish people'', or a majority of the Scottish people, or
had even 40% of the Scottish people, voted for change in 1979 we would
have an assembly today but a majority of 67.6% of the Scottish people
declined to vote for change and Labour's assembly proposal collapsed,
having failed to attract a modest 40% support.
If there is a case to be made for Scottish devolution it is not one
that can be made by stringing together a series of semantic blanks about
''the Scottish people'' and hoping that your readers will not notice
that they are entirely unsupported by electoral fact.
The paradox in Scotland's politics is one of the Scottish opposition
parties and the Scottish media claiming to have identified a desire for
constitutional change which fails to manifest itself in Scottish voting
behaviour in General Election after General Election.
Since 1979 the voting pattern in Scotland has been almost static
except for some minor movement in the Liberal Democrat and SNP vote.
Since the devolution issue was created by Edward Heath in 1968 it has
failed to move Scottish voters in one direction or another. If any
newspaper leader writer, Scottish media pundit, or Scottish opposition
politician can produce hard electoral evidence to the contrary, I will
gladly retract that statement in the largest lettering The Herald will
allow.
In the meantime, if Scotland's leading quality newspaper persists in
discarding reasoned argument in favour of semantic blanks, hyperbole,
and cringe-inducing emotive language, its lifelong readers such as
myself must question not only its own motivation but the underlying
validity of the devolution argument.

EVERYONE is naturally relieved when people straying into danger in the
hills are rescued and everyone admires the courage and skill of the
rescuers.
That said, many of us share Stewart Lamont's misgivings about risking
the lives of people in the rescue services to save those foolhardy
enough to go where it is manifestly extremely unsafe to go merely for
the kicks they get out of gratuitous daring (February 25).
Is it not time to set up some recognisable procedure whereby people
can be warned that, in the given conditions, they climb wherever it may
be strictly at their own risk?
We who live in remote places are served routinely by brave and
selfless people doing jobs that need to be done even, and sometimes
especially, in atrocious weather. There is the postman or postwoman who
never fails to deliver the mail (even if it's mostly junk mail)
cheerfully and promptly whatever the weather.
The doctor and the nurse come when called whatever the conditions.
I have in mind the seamen who keep us supplied with most of our
necessities, the electricity board engineers who repair broken power
lines in gale and blizzard, and the crews who man the air service and
the air ambulance.
All these splendid people deserve our best thanks; they are not
self-indulgent pretend heroes showing how tough they are; they are
people doing conscientiously the jobs they are paid to do. They are
serving others bravely, not putting others needlessly at risk in a
spirit of self-regarding bravado.

DR Burns and Professor Markus accuse me of denying an association
between poverty and health. I did not claim that there was no
connection. What I do object to is the straightforward suggestion that
poverty causes ill-health.
It is fashionable to blame an external agency for any misfortune and
it is easy to arrive at the conclusion that if someone is poor it is not
their fault but is caused by someone or something else. In the case of
poverty the Government is an ideal culprit.
Dr Burns's article was a political statement aimed at discrediting the
Government because the people of Drumchapel were less healthy than their
counterparts in Bearsden, and getting worse.
The premise was not strictly true. The article in the British Medical
Journal in December showed that with one exception the rates of all
common illnesses have declined in all social classes, even in
Drumchapel. The exception is among young males where deaths from suicide
and other undetermined causes have increased by a third.
It is true, of course, that the improvement in health has been greater
in Bearsden.
Dr Burns was right to state that fecklessness in all its features
contributes to ill-health. People who are poor are often the less
successful members of society by definition. Poverty is one part of the
syndrome which includes ill-health, unemployment, poor educational
standards, social failure, and other manifestations of deprivation. It
is not the cause.
There is no magic wand which will make inequality go away; there will
always be winners and losers. The only way to improve the lot of the
less successful is to lift the standards of the whole of society and
they will come with it.
It is naive to expect that the gap will disappear and just as naive to
suggest that any Government can effect anything more than a very gradual
change in the situation.
I must apologise to the people of Drumchapel for once more dragging
their statistics through the press. I started my career as a GP in the
first Drumchapel scheme in 1954/5 and then, as I am sure now, most
people were successful, healthy, and happy.
It is only the minority who damage the good name of Drumchapel and
distort the figures.

I AM writing to add our voice to the campaign of the nursing trade
unions to oppose the 1% pay imposition. The Community and District
Nursing Association has never been involved in industrial action. It is
not just that our constitution excludes it but that the nature of our
work rules it out. As a professional association we have never
considered public campaigns on political matters, let alone industrial
action.
However, the combination of extra pressure on workloads as a result of
community care policies and the squeeze on pay is intolerable. Unlike
hospital wards, communities are never full and cannot turn patients
away. District nurses will be joining the ''hearts and minds'' campaign
of the trade unions because we feel we have no other option.

SUPPORT for the SNP has increased by two points to 25%, while all
other main parties have seen their support fall or remain static in the
latest System Three/Herald monthly poll.
The Nationalists' gain, which takes the party to its highest position
so far this year, came as Labour's support fell by two points to 52% --
its second consecutive slip from a 10-year high of 57% in January.
However, the Conservatives also saw their support fall by one point to
11%, while the Liberal Democrats remained on 10%.
The SNP's increase will be attributed by some observers partly to the
performance of leader Alex Salmond in last month's debate with Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson on Scotland's constitutional future.
The poll was taken among 1035 people in 40 constituencies throughout
Scotland, between February 23 and 28, two weeks after the ''great
debate'', which was held on February 12 and screened on television the
following day.
The SNP said yesterday that the poll results would also boost its
campaign in the run-up to the local council elections on April 6, and
the Perth and Kinross by-election.
However, the poll was concluded on the same day as news of Ms Roseanna
Cunningham's withdrawal from the contest to fight the Perth and Kinross
seat for the SNP was reported in the press, and the events probably had
little, if any, effect on the poll results.
Ms Cunningham withdrew, after an attack on her personal life, but at
the weekend reversed her decision and said she wished to be considered
for the selection procedure.
Commenting on the poll yesterday, Mr Salmond said: ''In the 'great
debate', George Robertson admitted he would rather live in a Tory
Britain than see an independent Scottish Parliament.
''It is his performance and damaging admissions that have laid bare
Labour's shameful attitude to Scotland.''
He added: ''Labour is slipping fast from the high tide of support
which it reached at the start of the year, and the drift of support away
from it will leave Blair, Robertson, and the rest stranded high and dry
on their unionist beach.''
Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party,
attempted to play down the party's drop in support, focussing instead on
the commanding lead it retained over its rivals.
He said: ''Scottish Labour now constantly has double the support of
its opponents, and this is an excellent platform for the local elections
and the Perth and Kinross by-election.
''Scots know that only strong Labour support delivers for Scotland,
helps fight for jobs, and will stop rail privatisation.''
The chairman of the Tories in Scotland, Sir Michael Hirst, said The
Herald's poll was at variance with another recent polls which put the
Conservatives on 17%, and it significantly overstated Labour support.
''The forthcoming unitary authority elections and Perth and Kinross
by-election will give us ample opportunity to promote a more informed
debate about our policies and achievements,'' he said.
Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said:
''These figures show a continued steady performance by the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, but the poll that really counts is on April 6.
''All over Scotland, and especially in our target areas, the Liberal
Democrats are gearing up for the campaign, and we are looking forward to
a good result on polling day.''

THE letter from Michael and Margaret Scanlan attempting to deflect
Lord McCluskey's comment on the poor quality and overpayment of lawyers
and the fact that they are not popular cannot go unanswered (February
24).
There are regular reports that leave no doubt on the poor quality of
and poor opinion on what should be a noble and respected profession.
Lord McCluskey's comments are not in isolation.
The Herald told us on March 9, 1994, that the number of lawyers struck
off doubled in a year; we were again told by The Herald on June 1, 1994,
that Scottish legal fees for conveyancing were double those in England
and another report said the number of fraud, dishonesty, and theft
complaints against lawyers had doubled in three years from 273 in 1991
to 700 in 1994.
A most unbelievable local example of dissatisfaction was The Herald
Perspective on August 17, 1994, covering the unfortunate experiences of
Iain McIntyre which resulted in his solicitor having an Outsider article
published on August 30, critical of the system and the Law Society's
poor protection of lawyers' clients.
I am sorry that the Scanlans are not extremely concerned with the 15%
dissatisfaction level from the survey they highlighted and at their
rejection of the comment that lawyers are not popular.
It must be appreciated that when wronged clients cannot obtain
satisfaction there will be a long-held feeling of anger and, while the
Law Society rules firmly where criminal breaches of their members exist,
there is no satisfactory recourse for clients who suffer at the hands of
an incompetent legal business or one which has taken on too much work to
handle the responsibility efficiently.
The public have no way of knowing when they approach such a firm that
there may be a history of inefficiency and no way of easily obtaining
independent arbitration when they suffer at the hands of such a firm.
The present system, where Parliament and the Law Society offer unique
protection to the legal profession must stop and the good and caring
lawyers must instruct their union, the Law Society, to encourage an
independent supervisory body.

I AGREE completely with Russell Ecob that widowers should be given the
same benefits as widows (February 21). However, he fails to recognise
why women receive greater benefits.
Our patriarchal society demands that women be the carers for children
and men be the breadwinners. This is reflected in women's lower status
in the workforce and lower levels of pay.
Nursery places are not provided to enable women to work full-time.
While the Government may recognise that women can work and care for
children, this is normally part-time work which fits in with women's
family responsibilities.
Therefore it is recognised that when a woman is widowed she has lost
the main breadwinner; when a man is widowed he still has his salary,
hence the benefits provided are greater.
Any form of inequality is unacceptable. However, we will not achieve
true equality until both men and women have equal status and opportunity
both in the workforce and in the home.

THAT the Barings collapse has occurred is tragic, but such a financial
collapse in some quarter was not unexpected.
The British banks' attempts to float a lifeboat operation has failed,
not because of lack of willingness but because the sheer scale of
Barings' potential exposure is said to be so unquantifiable as to render
the related risk unacceptable. That this position could have been
arrived at, allegedly, as a result of the unfortunate trading of one
28-year-old, is an appalling reflection of the major and uncontrollable
risks being undertaken in the financial sector.
Perhaps the financial markets will indeed take the lessons that are
there to be learned. For every profit made in such market dealings there
is an equal and corresponding loss -- somewhere. Unfortunately the
front-line troops are often more talented, in facility with a keyboard,
than in terms of economic or commercial comprehension.
Often more computer-literate than their superiors, many youngsters do
not even have the backstop of a fully experienced mentor.
Many financial houses still balance their books only daily. Control
programmes need now to operate on a real time basis, evaluating overall
risk literally by the minute. If that is not practical, it is debatable
whether the related risks can reasonably be taken.
The advance of computer technology has brought great opportunities but
has also brought with it the opportunity to make mistakes faster and on
a grander scale than at any time in human history.
No doubt when the Barings' saga is fully investigated it will be
concluded that management controls were either inadequate or had been
circumvented. The fact is that every audit and control process has three
principal effects: it limits risk and loss potential, it limits the
upside potential profit, and it produces, inexorably, the evolution of
alternative ''products'' or means of circumventing the controls. If
their result is success and profitability, the effort is hailed as
creative and, if not, condemned as irresponsibility.
At all levels computer and communications technology is advancing at
an accelerating rate and with it there is increasing pressure upon
boards of directors to remain at the cutting edge. Unfortunately the
audit and control processes are necessarily reactive, rather than
proactive, running behind like a terrier while the hounds range far and
wide after an ever-more unpredictable quarry.
In such a business environment, control processes are expensive and
often commercially unpopular. However, if the individual members of a
board of directors do not fully understand the realities of an
electronic trading and control process then they would do well to
consider withdrawing from that sector.

I FIRST met Hugh Cochrane when we both arrived at BBC Glasgow in 1968
to join the Television News and Current Affairs Department. He was from
newspapers, I was from radio and neither of us had much experience of
television. There were several people around who liked to remind us of
that.
I was the first producer of the new series Current Account, which
became something of a milestone in Scottish broadcasting, and Hugh was
its principal reporter. From the very beginning, he was a natural. He
allied journalistic flair with sympathetic authority on the screen. His
penetrating reports ranged from the council estates of Scotland and
their deep-seated deprivation to the bulb fields of Holland and their
lessons for the Highlands and Islands. His vivid profiles stretched from
the leading businessman of the day, Hugh Stenhouse, to the feared and
elusive murderer, Bible John.
He made so many memorable films and conducted so many splendid
interviews in the short space of only three years before succumbing to
the temptation of applying for, and getting, the job of Editor,
Television News, Scotland. It was a mistake. He was a writer and a
performer, not a manager, and his failure in the post hurt him deeply.
He had so much more to give to the exploration and explanation of
Scottish life.
Hugh was great company. He was so confoundingly knowledgeable and so
breathtakingly well-read. He told stories so that the tears of helpless
laughter ran down your cheeks -- and his. His interests were as catholic
as his knowledge. He could talk from Scottish politics to American
literature with the best. His great failing was that he did not look
after himself or his considerable talent.
He dressed and danced nattily, admittedly in a determinedly fifties
style, and he was generous. I still have his Perleman Omnibus. He told
me to keep it. Thanks Hugh. For everything.

DR H S Conn expresses concern that amidst all the publicity against
the M77, little is being said about the proposed M74 northern extension.
But he can rest assured that Glasgow for People and many individuals
-- over 600 to date -- have indeed lodged objections to this latest
astonishing proposal from the dinosaurs in Strathclyde's roads
department.
The inhabitants of Rutherglen and the other areas of Glasgow affected
by it -- Toryglen, Polmadie, Oatlands, Tradeston, and the Gorbals -- are
unlikely to be fooled by the arrogant claims that this road would halve
traffic on surrounding streets in the long term: if it did, it would be
the first new motorway on the planet to do so.
Road opponents should and will continue to concentrate on the battle
over Pollok Estate, because, if the M77 does ever get built, you can bet
Strathclyde will use it as an argument to support the extension of the
M74.

IF YOU are one of those people whose holiday plans are determined by
the ups and downs of the foreign exchange markets, it looks like being a
choice between Renaissance art in Italy or holidaying in the Canadian
Rockies.
This year sterling has been making ground against the North American
currencies, but losing it against the ERM currencies.
Even the weekend devaluations of the peseta and escudo have done
little to arrest the escalating cost of holidaying in Europe. So far
this year the pound has gained just over 1% against the peseta, but it
is nearly 2.5% weaker on the escudo.
The lira, which left the ERM at the same time as sterling, is the sick
man of the European currency market. The pound has gained over 7% so far
this year as the lira has plummeted to around 2700.
Most of the rest of Europe has become much dearer. A scenic trip to
the Swiss lakes and mountains is now a rare treat. The pound has fallen
by nearly 6% against the Swiss franc since the start of the year.
Weekends in romantic spots such as Paris and Amsterdam are also
dearer. The pound is down over 5% on the Dutch guilder and nearly 2.5%
on the French franc.
The German mark has been on the rampage in a battle royale with the
dollar, and you would now get about 5% fewer marks for your money than
at the end of last year.
No wonder increasing numbers of British holidaymakers cross the
Atlantic to either the US or Canada. The pound has gained over 5% on the
dollar this year. Against the even weaker Canadian dollar sterling's
advance is over 5.5%.
Wherever you go expect hordes of Japanese and Germans. The strength of
the yen and the mark make most holidays look cheap.

Paris,
PERCEIVED in Britain as yet another threatening aspect of greater
European unity, a single currency is seen by most politicians and
business people in France as a desirable element of economic stability
and growth.
The right-wing UDF group of parliamentary parties is committed to the
single currency, as are the majority of Socialists. The right-wing of
the RPR Gaullist party still grumbles about monetary union, but is going
along with it. Only the Communist Party, the National Front, and the
breakaway extreme right-wing candidate in the presidential election,
Philippe de Villiers, are still openly hostile, two-and-a-half years
after the referendum on Maastricht produced a timid ''oui'' on single
currency and all other aspects of the treaty.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, himself a candidate for the Elysee,
said at the end of January that he would view the introduction of a
single currency by 1997, if that first possible date spelt out in the
Maastricht Treaty proves feasible, ''with serenity''. His Finance
Minister, Edmond Alphondery, recently told a conference on Franco-German
financial affairs in Paris, that it was necessary to push ahead with the
preparation of a single currency.
French serenity about a single currency is based on far more than just
their longer commitment to Europe. Unlike the British, they regard
monetary union as a method of regaining a degree of national sovereignty
over their currency, which has for years been pegged very close to the
Deutschmark. The French are also ready with a central bank. Unlike
Britain, they have one which is independent of government, the Banque de
France having obtained its autonomy a year ago.
Proof of the broad-based support for a single currency was the
unsuccessful bid by Jacques Chirac to make it a major issue of the
presidential election campaign. Mr Chirac proposed a further referendum,
if he were elected President, on the subject of EMU. Politically, it was
a signal to veteran anti-Maastricht campaigners, particularly those on
the right-wing of his own party, the RPR, to assert his difference from
his main right-wing rival, the very pro-Maastricht Mr Balladur. But it
backfired. No-one was impressed and Mr Chirac's promise had a bad effect
on markets, forcing him to back-track ever since.
Even if a single currency is second to other national concerns,
especially unemployment, at the moment, it will become a major issue
again once the presidential election is out of the way and as the first
deadline of 1997 approaches. It remains to be seen how political and
financial circles and public opinion in general will respond to seeing
their country lock itself into a system which is, by definition,
irreversible.

Brussels,
* What does a single currency mean to the ordinary British citizen?
* It means that if -- and it is a big if -- all goes to plan there
will eventually be a single currency for all 15 European Union
countries. In other words, the days of the pound, D-mark, franc and
peseta, etc, will be gone forever and we will all share the same brand
new currency.
The notion of a single currency is laid down in the Maastricht treaty.
Simply put, it will come about possibly as early as next year but only
if a majority of EU member states meet certain requirements.
These requirements are the so-called convergence criteria of
Maastricht which are, in effect, performance targets for inflation,
interest rates, currency stability, debt, and government deficits in the
member states.
If a majority is not found among the EU members next year the process
will take longer. But most people in Brussels take the view that a
single currency is a probability by the end of the century.
* Who needs it?
* Increasingly, big business. Groups like the Confederation of British
Industry believe a single currency will save money in exchange
transactions and help to oil the wheels of the single European market.
It will also allow industry to plan ahead with more accurate estimates
of costs and returns, confident that the wild swings in the exchange
rate of currencies like the pound will no longer wreck planning. It will
also save tourists the hassle and expense of changing all the various EU
currencies on their travels. Those living in the EU outside their own
home countries would also save on the expensive exchange rate charges
imposed by the banks.
* So why the fuss?
* Well, the reasons are more political than economic, so far. An
element of the Conservative Party, mainly the Thatcherites and
right-wing Eurosceptics, believes that abandoning the pound in favour of
a European single currency is surrendering national sovereignty.
* Why?
* They see the agenda for monetary policy being dictated from outside
the UK. They also believe you cannot have monetary union without
political union and they want Britain to stay aloof from a single
currency and continue exerting influence on the strength of the pound
through the Bank of England.
* What's so wrong with that?
* Several things, if you believe other senior Tories like the
Chancellor. The most obvious drawback if Britain stays out is the likely
effect on sterling. Since the war the pound has been a speculator's
plaything. It was not even safe in the old European exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) mainly because it was slotted into the grid at too high
a rate against the D-mark by Margaret Thatcher and John Major.
Speculators drove it out of the ERM eventually, and it remains out.
Abandoning the pound would end speculation on that scale for ever.
Also, the notion that a country's currency is a symbol of independence
is a touch old-fashioned in these days of the global village. Besides,
having a strong single European currency would be a defence against the
power of the Japanese yen and American dollar.
* But there must be a downside?
* Most probably it is the fact that if all 15 EU countries shared a
single currency some would simply have more money than others and less
room to manipulate their own economies. Unemployment, for example, would
be more difficult to deal with under a single currency unless it was
accompanied by strong regional policy. The EU is becoming very
regionally minded these days, partly as a result of this worry.
* What would replace the pound and D-mark etc?
* According to the European Commission, the Ecu which is the acronym
for European currency unit.
* Haven't we heard of that somewhere before?
* It is, in fact, an old Franco-Scottish coin going back to the days
of the Auld Alliance with France. Ecus were then part of monetary union
between France and Scotland, notably during the sixteenth century, and
were in daily use in Scotland. The Portuguese escudo derives its name
from the Ecu. The name could also, by the wildest coincidence, have
something to do with the fact that Jacques Delors was the force behind
the push for a single currency, and he is very French.
* So there's nothing new in it for Scotland?
* Not really. We have had monetary union with France in the past and,
of course, monetary union with England now for a couple of centuries.
The sovereignty argument cuts no ice in Scotland where we have no
central bank. We therefore have no sovereignty to lose in this issue.
* Any other examples of monetary union?
* Yes, Belgium and Luxembourg have shared their franc for a long time
now, but the union has not been without its problems. A few years ago
Belgium devalued unilaterally and provoked a storm of protest in
Luxembourg. Otherwise it has worked quite well. Britain and Ireland had
monetary union when Ireland was British.
* Will we really have to call it the Ecu?
* Perhaps not. The Germans are reluctant to abandon the powerful
D-mark and some have spoken fearfully of the ''peseta-isation'' of their
currency through monetary union. They are talking about calling the new
currency the Euromark.
* How will that go down in the rest of Europe?
* Probably quite well in Finland where the markke is the currency.
Elsewhere, not too well. It all adds up to a tricky political problem.
* Will the poor old pound just vanish overnight?
* Perhaps not. The backroom boys are working on this in Brussels. One
theory is that there could be a common -- as opposed to single --
currency for a transitional period. In other words we could have notes
printed as pounds or francs or D-marks on one side of the paper and Ecus
on the other side for a while. The idea of a Big Bang switch to a single
currency overnight is said to be losing favour in Brussels. But the most
likely plan is to have the Ecu in circulation for a while alongside the
national currencies which would eventually be phased out.
* Will Ecus carry a picture of the Queen?
* Possibly on one side of the note or coin, if there is a common
currency for a time. Otherwise, to be decided. The experts say it would
be better to have one design for all as a means of combating fraud.
Policy makers in Brussels are currently trying to invent a symbol for
the Ecu like the # and the $.
* What about our Scottish notes?
* See above. That also depends on the Royal Bank of Scotland which is
the only Scottish bank still printing pound notes.
* Where can I see an Ecu coin or note?
* You can't. They don't exist yet. Although the Ecu is the official
currency of the EU and the basis of all EU calculations, it is, in
effect, only notional. There have been Ecus minted as commemorative
coins but the nearest you can get to the real thing so far is a
chocolate version in gold wrapping paper in the Brussels Airport duty
free. Very popular they are, too.
* What will happen to automatic tellers in banks and slot machines?
* They will all have to be changed to take the new money. The cost to
the banks will be enormous and to industry generally it will be vast.
No-one has been able to calculate the full cost. Savings could be made
by making more machines, telephones, etc, credit-card friendly. And much
of the money would have been spent anyway on maintenance and
modernisation over the same period.
* Who will run the single currency?
* The new European Central Bank. It will be based in Frankfurt,
naturally, and will take over the functions of the national central
banks. It exists in embryo form already as the European Monetary
Institute and is run by a Belgian. Eventually, as the ECB, it will be
completely independent of the EU member states' treasuries and finance
ministries, another fact which worries some Eurosceptics. In effect, it
will be the Bundesbank writ large, but since the Germans will be
outnumbered on its board, the German ability to manipulate European
economic and monetary policy will be limited. That's the theory, at
least.
* Which countries are likely to be first to qualify for making the
switch?
* As things stand officially today, only the Irish, whose economy is
shaping remarkably well, and the Luxembourgers (who have special banking
rules) are definitely on course to meet the criteria. But when the time
comes the others likely to qualify are the British, Germans, Dutch and
Austrians.
The French are possibilities but Portugal, Spain, Finland and Denmark
are struggling to meet the criteria at present. Those who will probably
be last to join are Belgium (still too much debt) Italy, Sweden and
Greece.
* Have the British any choice?
* Yes. John Major negotiated a deal at Maastricht whereby we have the
right to remain out of a single currency meantime. Parliament will
decide whether we join although there is also talk now of a referendum.
* If Britain joins a single currency will we inherit Greek inflation
and high interest rates?
* No, in theory. Dealing with inflation will be a matter for the ECB
as will interest rates, which should by then be universal in the EU.
* If we don't like a single currency can we get out?
* In theory, no. But we said that about the ERM and the pound was, in
effect, blown out of it.
* Who decides what the Ecu will look like?
* Possibly the heads of government when they meet at Cannes in June
under the French presidency of the EU. Meanwhile, the European
Commission's experts are planning a green paper in time for Cannes. When
that appears we shall have a better idea of what progress is being made.
* Seems a bit like a fait accompli?
* Not quite. A clear majority of people in the UK don't want a single
currency, according to the polls. The same applies in Germany, where the
Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl is warmly in favour of the
principle but appears to be comfortably ahead of public opinion. The
French are very iffy about it as well. Despite the best efforts of the
Eurocrats, businessmen and politicians, the people could still have the
last word.

WHEN the idea of a single currency was launched in the EU, German
reaction was more than sceptical. For, in Germany, the loss of the
national currency is more than just a fiscal matter. The experience of
social deprivation in the 1920s and 1930s leading up to Nazi rule, has
enshrined a deep fear of inflation in the nation's psyche, which is
still at work.
From this background, the German economic miracle of the 50s, the
so-called wirtschaftswunder, and the subsequent economic performance has
been closely associated with the strength of the new currency. The
Deutschmark has since become the very symbol of German wealth and
prosperity.
It is no wonder that the prospect of losing this national asset makes
German citizens extremely worried. According to recent opinion polls,
between 50% and 80% (depending on the wording) of the population are
opposed to a Single European Currency.
Populist politicians have started long ago to make use of these common
feelings, ridiculing the idea of ''esperanto-money'' and scaremongering
by drawing up scenarios of Italian-like conditions.
Surprisingly, the most unlikely group to panic has always been the
German financial community. Their prime concern is neither with national
sovereignty nor with democratic control but with the autonomy of their
key institution, the Bundesbank. Sceptics have warned that the whole
idea of a common European currency is a deliberate ploy of envious
rivals to break the power of Germany's central bank. But the general
view in the profession is somewhat different. Instead of contemplating
their loss of autonomy, they want to become more active in shaping the
new institutions according to the German model.
With regard to the single currency, bankers have recently argued for
the creation of a ''national currency forum'' to define German interests
in the reform process and to prepare for the period of transition.
''Stability is more important than the timetable,'' says Hans Tietmeyer,
president of the Bundesbank, expressing the German position in a
nut-shell. To go ahead with a single currency that lacks confidence is
seen as a recipe for disintegration, and, worse, inflation.
In practice, this points to the infamous two-speed Europe.
Strong-currency states would go ahead, leaving voluntary opt-outs and
non-adjusted economies behind. The former would create a single
independent currency subject to the control of the European Central
Bank. Its name might not be called Ecu, which has a connotation of
weakness and might still be needed as a composite currency for the
latter group and as the accounting unit of the EU budget. Already
whispers about a Euromark are to be heard.

R E Dundas, Chief Financial Editor, introduces our single currency
special report with an analysis of the latest crisis to hit the ERM.
THE weekend devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese
escudo have dealt another blow to Europe's flagging exchange rate
mechanism. The previous ERM crisis, in August 1993, resulted in the
fluctuation bands being widened from 2.25% or 6% to 15%, except for the
Dutch guilder and the German mark.
The peseta has now been devalued by 7% as it was within sight of its
lowest permitted rate within the ERM, and the accompanying 3.5%
devaluation of the escudo was necessitated by the close trading ties
between the two countries.
Since September 1992, when the pound and the lira were forced out of
the ERM, the peseta has been devalued four times and the escudo three
times.
Each realignment of currencies within the ERM has had the same
fundamental cause. The German mark has been soaring to fresh heights as
the US dollar has plummeted. The failure of Friday's concerted central
bank intervention to defend the dollar brought matters to a head in
Brussels at the weekend.
Only the guilder has the strength to move up with the mark within the
ERM. A strong mark creates tensions for the other member currencies.
Yesterday the French franc hit an all-time low against the mark, and
is around 8.5% below its central rate in the ERM. The Danish crown and
the Irish punt are also seen as weak currencies within the ERM. Denmark
has close links with the other Scandinavian countries and Ireland's main
trading partner is Britain.
The latest ERM debacle has revived speculation that a fast lane, based
on the German mark, would lead Europe to a single currency. If there is
to be a single currency in the next 10 years it will almost certainly be
restricted to a hard core of ERM members, sometimes referred to as the
Euromark bloc.
Each crisis pushes back serious consideration of a starting date. In
the financial markets Spain and Portugal are not seen as candidates for
participation in a single currency. The pound and the lira have each
posted fresh lows against the mark in the past week, and it is difficult
to see how either could clamber back into the ERM.
Sterling's basic difficulty is its historic ties with the dollar. Back
in 1992 when the pound hit the $2 mark, the financial markets took this
as a signal that it could not sustain its rate against the mark within
the ERM.
The lira is a victim of the succession of financial and political
crises which have plagued Italy, and it is further away from stability
than ever. The Greek drachma has never been in a position to join.
The Belgian franc is one of the most stable ERM currencies, but the
public-borrowing criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty could prove
an insurmountable barrier.
The key to a single currency is France. Successive governments have
followed a franc fort policy which has kept inflation low but saddled
the country with a double-figure rate of unemployment.
Unless France is able to participate, a single currency would be no
more than a greater Deutschmark encompassing Germany, Holland, Austria,
and possibly Belgium and Luxembourg.
The franc is likely to face a few crises before France makes up its
mind or the decision is taken out of its hands by the foreign exchange
markets.
The dollar/mark tussle has by no means run its course, and further
tensions within the ERM are inevitable. Meanwhile, the debate about
whether there should be a single currency, and if so, when, looks
increasingly divorced from the real world. Nowhere is that more so than
in Britain.

ABERDEEN'S newest museum will open next month in one of the city's
oldest buildings.
The museum at the Tolbooth, built between 1616 and 1629 to house
prisoners awaiting trial or punishment, will give an insight into the
civic history of the city, and visitors will be able to pass through the
condemned man's cell.
It was known originally as the Wardhouse and served for 200 years as
the prison for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.
The first room visitors will enter is a cell built in 1704 which will
include a 3-D model based on a map of Old and New Aberdeen drawn by
Parson James Gordon of Rothiemay 334 years ago and showing the general
layout of the city before modern developments like Union Street.
There will also be a ''Timeline'' putting the development of Aberdeen
into the contest of major events happening at the time.
Perhaps the most gruesome area of the new museum, which opens on April
1, is the room traditionally known as the condemned man's cell. In
medieval Aberdeen there were no custodial sentences and justice was
swift and painful, ranging from being branded on the cheek with a hot
iron to being tied to a stake on the beach facing the incoming tide.
Such punishments prompted numerous escapes and one of the most daring
was Alexander Keith of Balmuir, who was imprisoned for debt. He escaped
to the family castle at Boddam, near Peterhead, concealed in a deed
chest.

THE vice-chairman of Hamilton Accies has regained consciousness after
being in a coma for more than two months.
Mr Robert Gibb, 57, suffered head, chest, and spine injuries when his
car overturned into a field between Helmsley and Thirsk, just before the
New Year.
He had been on a life support machine at Friarage Hospital,
Northallerton, Yorkshire after being pulled from the wreckage.
Mr Gibb, who owns the Flamingoland Zoo and theme park in North
Yorkshire as well as Cleethorpes Pleasure Park, has now been transferred
to a special spinal unit at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield.
His wife, Maureen, son Gordon and daughters, Melanie and Vicky, have
constantly been at his hospital bedside.
A spokesman for the football club said yesterday: ''He still hasn't
spoken since the accident but appears to be taking more notice of what
is happening around about him.''
A spokesman at Pinderfields described Mr Gibb's condition as
satisfactory last night.
''He has made encouraging progress in the past few days. His breathing
has improved and he is off the life-support machine. Specialists are now
attending to his spinal injuries,'' he said.
Originally from Strathaven, Lanarkshire, Mr Gibb moved to Yorkshire
about 11 years ago, and now lives in Scarborough, but he has remained a
shareholder at the club.

PEOPLE living near a proposed sand and gravel quarry at the
picturesque Peebles-shire village of West Linton should have no fears
about noise from crushing machinery because the quarry will not have to
use any, the first day of a public inquiry was told yesterday.
Mr Geoffrey Hornsby, joint managing director of the Ryton Sand and
Gravel Group, said the deposit to be worked at Tarfhaugh Farm was of
high quality and would not require a crusher.
Two companies associated with Ryton, William E. Christer (Gravel) Ltd
and United Quarries (Sand &amp; Gravel) Ltd, are appealing against the
refusal of Borders Regional Council to grant planning permission to
extract and work sand and gravel at Tarfhaugh.
Mr Hornsby, the first witness for the appellants, said the company
would comply with the recommendations of its acoustic expert consultant
to reduce noise and would take all necessary steps to ensure that
nuisance did not arise from dust.
He said that the proposed quarry had caused great concern to residents
of West Linton, but the company would ensure that all quarry traffic
would enter and leave the site by the A701.
Once passing places had been created, no lorry would want to head for
West Linton on purely practical grounds.
Lorry drivers could be stopped from entering West Linton by using
Romanno Bridge as the quarry address. The quarry would be known as
''Tarfhaugh, Romanno Bridge''.
Mr Hornsby said the deposit at Tarfhaugh would yield a low-shrinkage,
high-quality aggregate, technically suited for use in the processing
industries -- ready-mixed concrete, mortar, and asphalt.
The aim was to produce 150,000 tonnes a year. A market existed within
a 30-mile radius for a minimum of 1.2m tonnes a year. The Tarfhaugh
development would contribute positively to satisfying this demand.
It was estimated the quarry could generate spending of #300,000 a year
in the local economy, which would be the equivalent of #8.4m over the
life of the quarry.
It would bring employment for 11 or 12 people, five or six of whom
would be employed at the quarry. Six others would be employed as
drivers.
Mr Hornsby said that the company operated quarries in Northumberland,
including Caistron and Roddam.
The Caistron quarry was one of the finest examples of industry and
nature working in harmony in the creation of a nature reserve. At
Roddam, there was a colony of sand martins.
The inquiry is being conducted by Mr Alan Walker, Scottish Office
reporter. The case for the appellants is being led by Mr Andrew Hardie,
QC, Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, and for the planning authority by
Mr Neil Murray, QC.
Evidence by third party objectors, which is expected to be heard next
week, is to be given by organisations including the Quarries Action
Group, West Linton Area Tourist Group, West Linton Primary School Board,
the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland, local community
councils, and a number of individuals.
The inquiry is expected to last three weeks.

MILKMEN are being recruited in the fight against crime as they deliver
the daily pintas.
In a pilot scheme with Grampian police, the milkmen of Robert Wiseman
Dairies will be on the alert in the early hours when many criminals are
active.
They are being given special briefings on what they should and should
not do and the kind of things to keep a look out for when on their
rounds.
By joining the Early Bird Scheme, the milkmen are simply formalising
the assistance they already give to the police.
Two weeks ago one chased an armed raider at an Aberdeen shop.
In another recent incident, two youths were caught and convicted after
breaking into a supermarket thanks to help given to police by a milkman.
Police Sergeant Gordon Merchant pointed out that the scheme ''is not
aimed at recruiting vigilantes and secondly no one will be asked or
expected to indulge in heroics. All they will be asked to do is observe
and report any incident which may arouse their suspicion.''
He said they often automatically knew when something was wrong in
their neighbourhood.
Mr Malcolm Murray, the dairy firm's retail director, said: ''This is a
pilot scheme but if it is successful and other police forces are keen it
could cover the whole of Scotland.''

THE English rugby internationalist Wade Dooley -- a policeman -- is to
be charged with drink-driving after an accident in which a 14-year-old
girl's skull was fractured.
PC Dooley, 37, England's most capped second row forward, is expected
to appear in court later this month.
He was driving his Land Rover Discovery when Rochelle Muskett was
injured near her home in Kirkham, Lancashire, in January.
Rochelle suffered a fractured skull and other injuries in the
accident, which happened as the former British Lion, a community
policeman in Blackpool, was on his way home after playing for his club,
Preston Grasshoppers.
PC Dooley, who has been off work sick since the accident, is expected
to appear in court before magistrates at Blackburn, Lancashire, on March
31.

A SOLICITOR and property developer defrauded the Royal Bank of
Scotland out of #300,000 in a desperate gamble to keep his business
afloat, a court heard yesterday.
Andrew McCulloch, 59, came unstuck when he used the same method to try
to swindle Barclays Bank out of #250,000, Lord Kirkwood was told at the
High Court in Edinburgh.
The judge told McCulloch, of Gilchristland, Closeburn, Dumfriesshire,
that he took into account his age and the fact that he was a first
offender.
''However, the fraud on the Royal Bank of Scotland was carefully
planned and executed and involved a large sum of money. You also
attempted to defraud Barclays Bank, again by issuing forged documents.
''These were serious offences and I have no doubt that a substantial
custodial sentence is called for.''
He jailed McCulloch for three years for fraud and attempted fraud and
added six months for McCulloch's failure to turn up for trial last year
while on bail.
McCulloch, whose career and personal life are now in ruins, admitted
the offences.
Mr Alan Turnbull, Advocate-depute, told the court that although
McCulloch retained his solicitor's practising certificate, since about
1980 he had concentrated on his business as a property developer.
Both the Royal Bank and Barclays Bank charges arose from a housing
development McCulloch was pursuing in Dunfermline. He approached the
manager of the Royal Bank in Kirkcudbright in January 1991 and requested
an overdraft facility of #300,000.
He offered to put up Gilchristland, said to be worth #500,000, as
security.
The bank then received documentation, apparently from a firm of
Edinburgh solicitors, which appeared to confirm details of the security.
However, the solicitors' letter was forged.
By March the bank was satisfied that it had adequate protection for
its #300,000, but in reality the house was already subject to a standard
security in favour of the Nationwide Anglia Building Society and the
bank had no protection whatsoever.
When the Royal discovered the true position it arranged for McCulloch
to be sequestrated, but discovered that he had no free assets, and the
#300,000 was never recovered.
By the end of June 1991 McCulloch had used up all the cash and
approached a corporate manager of Barclays Bank in St Andrew Square,
Edinburgh, in an attempt to persuade him to advance #250,000 for his
property company, Ardwall Holdings.
Again, it was to develop the site at Dunfermline, and again McCulloch
offered Gilchristland as security. He also offered to set aside #275,000
worth of stocks and shares, allegedly held on his behalf by a London
finance company.
He produced a letter to this effect, apparently from the finance
company, but again it was forged.
The Barclays manager was not satisfied with this documentation and
phoned the finance company, which confirmed that it held no assets for
McCulloch. As a result, the #250,000 was never advanced.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, explained that with the coming to power
of the Conservative Government and the encouragement of private
enterprise, McCulloch gave up practising as a solicitor and concentrated
on property development.
He ploughed his life-savings of #300,000 into Ardwall Holdings and
during the 1980s completed four housing developments worth more than
#8m. However, as time went by, he was badly affected by the slump in
property prices and soaring interest rates.
By 1990 he was very badly placed to finance the conclusion of his
fifth, last and fatal development at Lower Transy, Dunfermline.
However, he believed the Chancellor when he referred to the situation
as a ''temporary blip'' in the economy and thought that, if he could
only complete the development, things would be all right.
Faced with the loss of the company he had built up, he committed the
fraud in desperation in the belief that all the money would be repaid in
a short time.
Mr Ogg added: ''He was at sea, but dry land was in sight and people
were waving at him from the shore. This money was not used to purchase
flash cars, designer suits, yachts or furs for his wife. It was used in
an attempt to save his business.''
Now, approaching 60, McCulloch was bankrupt and disgraced socially.
His house and the Dunfermline site had been repossessed, his wife had
left him and his family had broken up.
He had been due to stand trial last year, but panicked and ran away to
South Africa. Within 10 days he had come to his senses and returned, via
the Netherlands, to give himself up.
Attempted murder charge thrown out by Bahamas jury
ANDREW McCulloch appeared in the dock as a first offender yesterday --
thanks to a jury in the Supreme Court of Nassau, in the Bahamas, who
acquitted him of attempted murder 22 years ago.
The man he was charged with shooting was Edinburgh dentist James
Mitchell who, in 1963, married Babs Beverley, one of the singing
Beverley Sisters, in Edinburgh's wedding of the year.
Although the Bahamas jury took just 35 minutes to acquit McCulloch on
a 10-2 verdict in February 1973, Mitchell was awarded damages of #75,000
when he sued over the shooting in the Court of Session four years later.
At the time that was a record damages award in a personal injuries
case.
Back in October 1972, as now, property development was at the root of
McCulloch's problems.
Mr Mitchell was president and executive director of Jason Investments
(Bahamas) Ltd, a company formed to buy, sell and invest in land and
property. McCulloch, then a partner in an Edinburgh law firm, held 75
shares.
He and Mr Mitchell got to know each other in 1967 when McCulloch
expressed an interest in investing in the Bahamas and over the next
three years McCulloch and his family invested $765,000 in land and
shares in the islands.
At first, the two men were on friendly terms, but by the time Mitchell
travelled to Nassau in October 1974 to attend a shareholders' meeting
their relationship had cooled considerably. Mr Mitchell believed that
McCulloch was about to join an attempt to gain control of Jason
Investments.
Mr Mitchell claimed: ''McCulloch, being a solicitor, was aware that I
could not be ousted from executive control by legal means, and I believe
he resolved to remove me by murdering me.''
McCulloch travelled to the Nassau on October 23 with a .22 pistol
which he smuggled through Customs and, according to Mr Mitchell, used
the weapon to shoot him twice in the back.
Mr Mitchell survived to endure six operations, including the removal
of his spleen, and spent 13 weeks in hospital.
McCulloch admitted travelling to the Bahamas with the .22, but claimed
it was for personal protection because, he alleged, Mr Mitchell was a
man of violent disposition.
His story was that Mr Mitchell produced a gun first and fired at him
and that he only used his .22 because he was in fear of his life.
Mr Mitchell described that version of events as ''an absolute tissue
of lies'' but the Nassau jury found it rather more convincing.
The dentist had the last laugh in the Court of Session when McCulloch
admitted that he was liable in damages for the shooting.

GUESTS at a Perthshire wedding will be asked to be very careful what
they eat up to 24 hours before the ceremony because one whiff of the
breath of someone who has consumed peanuts could kill the bride.
Just being in the same room as a person who has eaten peanuts -- even
hours after they have left -- is enough to trigger a deadly anaphylactic
attack in Miss Susie Whyte, 19, of Scone, near Perth.
It shuts down her respiratory system and sparks violent muscle spasms.
She will die unless she gets an injection of adrenalin immediately and
is in hospital within 30 minutes.
Miss Whyte and fiance, Mr Steve Brown, 22, are to marry in July at a
ceremony in Scone with around 100 guests who, together with church
staff, will be briefed of her chronic condition.
It has become so bad that she has been forced to stay behind closed
doors for the last two years to avoid chance contact with strangers.
However, on a rare outing at her sister's wedding 19 months ago, Miss
Whyte met Mr Brown, an RAF technician, and romance blossomed. When he
left the RAF, he moved from Norfolk to Miss Whyte's family home in
Scone.
The severity of allergies is normally measured on a scale of one to
four. Miss Whyte's is so severe it registers five.
Her doctor, consultant dermatologist John Ferguson, of Ninewells
Hospital, Dundee, said her case was the worst he had come across.
''Susie has the most severe form of peanut allergy we've ever heard
of,'' he said. ''But she's a brave girl with a great attitude. She deals
with it as well as anybody could.''
Miss Whyte's allergy was discovered when she was 18-months-old. She
came out in a rash after her father, Brian, who had been eating peanuts,
wiped a tear from her face.
The condition worsened until she had to leave school two years ago
because her attacks were leaving her close to death.
The couple are taking no chances with the wedding and are holding the
reception in their garden well away from any possible contact with
strangers.
Miss Whyte said she had been told by doctors it would be ''highly
unlikely'' her condition would be passed on to her children.
''I've been told that if I sustained an anaphylactic attack while
pregnant, I could lose the baby so I'll have to be really careful if I
get pregnant,'' she added. ''Steve has been wonderful and has been a
great shoulder to cry on.''
Mr Brown said: ''I know things will be difficult because of Susie's
condition. But we love each other and we want to overcome this thing
together.''
Miss Whyte's mother, Sheila, 48, said: ''We're just delighted and
looking forward to the wedding so much. It's very important for Susie to
get married in church.''
Doctors around the world are still trying to find a cure for the
condition. Anyone wishing to find out more or offer help to people like
Miss Whyte should contact the Anaphylaxis Campaign, 8 Wey Close, Ash,
Aldershot, Hampshire, GU12 6LY.

A #1m plan to eliminate contract drivers and the single-manning of
ambulances in the North of Scotland within the next 12 months was
unveiled yesterday.
The news was welcomed by Mrs Norma Brown, whose paramedic husband,
David, died in an ambulance crash in 1993. But she warned that, until
double-manning was introduced all over Scotland, a similar tragedy could
occur.
However, the Scottish Ambulance Service regional director, Mr John
Drummond, promised to complete the phasing out of single-manning
throughout the country by March next year.
The joint initiative announced yesterday by Highland Health Board and
the Scottish Ambulance Service will bring 30-50 more jobs to the area.
More importantly, they say there will be more fully-trained paramedics
and a better response times to emergencies.
The wide geographical spread of the Highlands and Islands area
convinced the Scottish Office that additional funding should be made to
have double-manning on all vehicles within a year, increasing the
trained workforce by 20 per cent to about 250.
The ambulance service in the Highlands and Islands came under fire
after a horrific accident in which a young mother lost her baby, and a
paramedic and a midwife were killed, on a journey from Skye to
Inverness.
Portree High School languages teacher Mrs Louise Hill, then aged 30,
was catapulted from an ambulance taking her to hospital. Her baby was
still-born.
Paramedic Mr Brown, 38, and midwife Mrs Susan Beaton, 41, a
mother-of-four, died instantly as the vehicle, driven by a contracted
ambulance driver, Mr Gerald Barnes, 64, of Ose, by Struan, near
Dunvegan, skidded on ice and somersaulted across the A887
Glenurquhart-Kyle road early on a morning in December 1993.
The policy of contracting out ambulance driving to relatively
untrained local men came under scrutiny at a fatal accident inquiry last
summer. In her findings, Sheriff Angela Cowan criticised the training
programme for contracted drivers.
She did not blame Mr Barnes or give an opinion on whether a
better-trained driver could have avoided the accident.
The Scottish Ambulance Service divisional manager for the Highlands,
Mr Bob Johnson, admitted the FAI strengthened the resolve to eliminate
single-manning, but he would not say if it speeded it up.
He added: ''We were going down that road, anyway, when this terrible
accident happened.
''There were elements in the inquiry, particularly involving training,
which we looked at. By next March, all areas will have double-manned
ambulance cover round the clock. The rural areas, in particular, will
see the biggest benefit.''
Mrs Brown said: ''If this means there will be two trained technicians
on our ambulances round the clock, then I welcome the news.
''But if this is just playing with words and the service mean an
auxiliary and a trained man will continue to man the vehicles at times,
then we are back to square one.''
Scottish ambulance regional director Mr Drummond promised the
announcement did mean an end to single-manning throughout Scotland.

VIVIAN Stanshall, leader of the sixties group Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band
has died in a fire at his home.
Stanshall, 52, whose best known hit was Urban Spaceman, was found dead
by firefighters on Sunday morning in the bedroom of his third floor
flat, in Hillfield Park, Muswell Hill, north London.
An inquest will be held following a post mortem examination yesterday.
Fire investigators were trying to find the cause of the blaze, which
destroyed half the flat and part of the roof of the building.
Stanshall's death came just as he was about to start recording an
album with his new record label WEA.
In addition to his English-eccentric recordings, Stanshall -- with his
distinctive ginger hair, beard, and moustache -- was also a respected
comic, poet, and painter.
He formed the Doo-Dah Band in 1965 while studying at Goldsmiths
College. His satirical style made the band one of the most individual
groups of the time.
Urban Spaceman was in the charts for 14 weeks and reached number five.
The group made five albums before the singer had a nervous breakdown
brought about by addiction to tranquillisers and drink. He later spent
years campaigning against them.
He had been married twice, but was living alone when he died.

THE seven Ayrshire children in care for almost five years following
allegations of ritual sex abuse should be returned home to their parents
within three weeks, it was decided yesterday.
Within hours of the decision, the children and their parents met
face-to-face at supervised meetings, their first, in some cases, for
four years and nine months.
The timetable for family reunions, and removal from social work
control, was approved yesterday by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord
Hope, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and Mayfield.
They took just 20 minutes to decide, cutting through the morass
created by the children's ''unjustified'' removal into care from two
families in June, 1990.
The seven children have remained together in a special unit since
1990, and are now aged five to 15.
At least two have no recollection of their parents: one girl was aged
just seven months, and two boys were aged between one and
three-years-old when taken into care by social workers after allegations
of what amounted to satanic paedophile orgies.
Mr Paul Burns, the families' legal spokesman, said he was pleased that
matters have progressed so smoothly.
He predicted the private meetings would be ''of great joy and also of
great sadness at what they have lost'', and added: ''I would be
surprised if there wasn't a little bit of apprehension on both sides.''
Mr Burns said the lawyers for families expect to meet later this week
to discuss legal actions. Claims for damages will be considered, along
with suggestions that social workers who allegedly massaged evidence
should be brought to account.
A 15-year-old girl from a third family was reunited with her parents
last week. Lawyer Maurice Smythe said she was very happy, but the family
might now need counselling.
He said, however, that it was premature to talk about legal action
because the families wanted time to reflect on events.
Last week the judges had ordered the return home of the children ''as
soon as possible'', after upholding Sheriff Colin Miller's finding that
their removal was not justified.
However, the judges were also conscious that speed could prove even
more damaging to the children's welfare than being torn from their
parents in the first place.
Yesterday, they studied confidential reports from two psychologists,
Dr John Powell and Dr Christine Puckering, appointed as curators to act
in the children's best interests after Lord Hope described the case as a
tragedy of immense proportions.
One family had not seen three of their four children since 1990, while
the second family had not seen their three boys since 1992 when access
was denied by the Children's Panel.
The judges yesterday accepted they should be returned home within
three weeks after reading the psychologists' recommended methods for
reintroductions.
It was also agreed to hold another hearing on Tuesday, March 21, to
receive an update on how access arrangements leading to reunions had
progressed. Some of the children are likely to be allowed home on that
Tuesday because it is clear the curators, families, and lawyers are
confident two weeks will prove long enough to overcome barriers.
Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, for the family of four children aged five to
15, told the Court of Session yesterday that Miss Puckering had already
found the children's anticipation of a reunion was ''unbearable''.
He said the parents had no qualms about her report, and that the
supervisory arrangements leading to their children's return will be
introduced immediately.
He said it was not anticipated there would be ''any lack of
co-operation'' from social workers.
However, in a reference to the exceptional circumstances in which
children will return to parents they do not remember, he added:
''Obviously, during the fortnight things could go wrong.''
Mr Edward Targowski, QC, for the family of three, said he was in total
agreement with Dr Powell's timetable for their ''relatively rapid return
within two-to-three weeks''.
There had been reports that the three, aged six, eight, and 10, did
not want to return home. However, Miss Mary Hartnoll, Strathclyde's
director of social work, confirmed that their fears were normal because
the children did not know their parents properly and did not want to
leave the unit where they lived.
Mr Graham Bell, QC, for Mr Fred Kennedy, Reporter to Strathclyde
Children's Panel, told the judges he had no problem with the
recommendations from Dr Powell, called in by Lord Clyde after the Orkney
sex scandal, and Dr Puckering, of Glasgow University, who has formed
close relationships with the traumatised children.
One family lawyer later warned the children would need long-term
counselling, even if all went well with the reunions. He said that,
years on, some children in the Orkney case still needed counselling
although in care for just five weeks.
The solicitor added the Ayrshire families hope that counselling will
be provided through the National Health Service because any involvement
by social workers ''would be inappropriate''.
The Court of Session last week ruled the children's removal was
unjustified after a year-long investigation by Sheriff Miller. The
sheriff found that the children were not abused, and criticised social
workers for providing evidence that was blinkered, ineptly collected,
and contaminated.
However, social workers remain unconvinced.
Lord Hope confirmed the time would come ''fairly soon'' when the court
bring its proceedings to an end after ruling the referral grounds for
the children's removal were not established.
He stressed the psychologists' reports refer to the need for future
support for the families, although the court had nothing to do with that
process.

GETTING good value for money and the effective delivery of council
services should be uppermost in people's minds when they vote at next
month's local elections, Scottish Local Government Minister George
Kynoch said yesterday.
Speaking at a special briefing in Edinburgh, he declined to forecast
how the Conservatives will fare on April 6, but stressed the elections
for the new single-tier councils were about the delivery of local
services, not national issues.
However, Mr Kynoch suggested his own party could work on improving its
communications with the voters.
''As a party, I think we could have been better in getting across our
success stories,'' he said, and there were success stories to be told in
virtually every field in Scotland.
The Minister said there was scope immediately for Scottish councils to
be conducting a critical analysis of how they delivered services.
Looking further ahead, the move to unitary authorities and the end of
the old region and district structure presented ''a golden opportunity''
for a new look at their operations.
There must be flexibility in achieving the good, efficient, and
cost-effective delivery of services.
''I don't think there is a prescribed way for delivering those
services right across the country. What is appropriate in Glasgow might
not be appropriate in Aberdeen,'' said Mr Kynoch.
In a week when many councils are having to cut their budgets following
a tough financial settlement from the Government, the Minister said he
was sure taxpayers knew that in other walks of life there had been a
significant squeeze to get better efficiency and output for the same
amount of funding. They expected the same from their councils.
The Minister, who replaced Mr Allan Stewart last month, said the
Government had a responsibility to ensure that public spending was kept
firmly under control.
He did not envisage an end to the capping powers of Ministers over
council budgets in the foreseeable future.
Mr Kynoch also let it be known that the Scottish Office had received
''a very significant and healthy response'' to its recent call for
possible members of the boards of the three new public water
authorities.
Some opposition council leaders had suggested the Government was
having difficulty filling the 8 to 12 jobs on each board.

The questions, some of them highly technical, deal with what Lockerbie
campaigners claim are discrepancies in the Crown's case against two
Libyan intelligence agents who are wanted for the murder of 270 people
who died when a bomb on board PanAm flight 103 exploded above Lockerbie
just before Christmas, 1988.
Dr Jim Swire, spokesman for the British families of the Flight 103
victims, as well as other relatives, will meet Mr Dalyell in the Commons

SCOTS are half as more likely again than the English to die from
smoking in middle age and, while Scotsmen between 35 and 69 seem to
getting the message, their female contemporaries are failing to stub
out, and now have the highest tobacco-related death rates in the world.
The grim statistics are highlighted in a new analysis unveiled today
on the eve of No Smoking Day by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. It
shows that a third of all deaths in middle-aged Scots is caused by
smoking.
Among women in the vulnerable age bracket, mortality rates are
two-thirds higher in Scotland than in England. In men, they are one
third higher.
According to the study, smoking deaths of middle-aged Scotsmen are at
long last on a downward trend, but there has been no similar drop among
women in either Scotland or England.
Professor Richard Peto, the head of the charity's cancer studies unit
in Oxford, said yesterday: ''If women smoke like men, they will die like
men. Even in England, smoking is by far the biggest cause of premature
death, but in Scotland it is much worse.
''Scottish women have the highest death rates in the world from
tobacco.''
Professor Peto, who said that smoking killed more than 9000 men and
6000 women in Scotland every year, added: ''Many people who have been
smoking for a long time mistakenly believe that it isn't worth quitting
because any damage must already have been done.
''That is absolutely not true. Even in middle age, those who do manage
to stop smoking avoid most of their future risk of being killed by
tobacco.''
Another report on the dangers, from the Health Education Board for
Scotland and Action of Smoking for Health(Scotland), urges health
professionals to give more help to the older smoker.
The report, As Time Goes By, focuses particularly on older women.
Author Yvonne Bostock said: ''Women, especially, started smoking at a
time when it was glamorous and have very positive associations with
smoking.''
It is estimated that more than 10,000 smokers in Scotland will try to
kick the habit tomorrow. Scotland's unique free telephone helpline for
people trying to kick the habit will be open from 7am tomorrow until 1am
on Thursday morning to offer support.

<HEADLINE>MPs given assurance by Lang over M77</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang reaffirmed his commitment to the M77
extension on the south side of Glasgow yesterday, and deplored the
presence of schoolchildren playing truant at what he described as
''dangerous demonstrations''.
Last night, Mr Lang met a cross-party group of MPs whose
constituencies are affected by the motorway project. He told them
law-and- order measures would be maintained to ensure the extension is
completed on time.
Afterwards, the MPs welcomed Mr Lang's determination and said it
reflected the widespread support for the project among local residents.
They said it was time for the demonstrators to ''go home and let the
construction continue''.
The delegation was made up of Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and
Doon Valley -- Lab.), Mr Brian Donohoe (Cunninghame South -- Lab.), Mr
Willie McKelvey (Kilmarnock and Loudon -- Lab.), Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr --
Con.) and Mr Allan Stewart (Eastwood -- Con.).
The MPs sought the meeting as part of their campaign -- launched last
month -- to counter what they feel is the negative publicity the project
has received. They argue that the demonstrators against the route have
dominated the debate through violence and intimidation.
Last night, the MPs emphasised that the project had passed through all
the statutory inquiries; would relieve congestion in suburban Glasgow;
would reduce environmental damage caused by slow-moving traffic,and
would reduce the accident rate on the A77.
The MPs asked Mr Lang to look at ways of deterring any more pupils
from staying off school and joining in the demonstrations.
Mr Foulkes said: ''All agreed that parents should be reminded of their
responsibilities, that pupils should stay in work and continue with
their work. He deplored the way some of the protesters are exploting the
school pupils.''
A spokesman for Mr Lang: ''It is regrettable that schoolchildren have
played truant to become involved in dangerous demonstrations. Mr Lang
welcomes the fact that the education authority are taking the steps they
consider necessary to tackle the truancy problem.''
Last week, a Strathclyde councillor accused Scottish Militant Labour
councillor Tommy Sheridan of playing ''Pied Piper'' by attracting
schoolchildren to the demonstrations, a claim he firmly rejected. Adult
demonstrators also were accused of encouraging students to pull false
fire-alarms as a way of getting out of school to attend the protests.

LABOUR'S deputy leader in Scotland called yesterday for some regional
council departments to be retained when the authorities themselves
disappear under local government re-organisation next year.
Mr John McFall, the depute-Shadow Scottish Secretary, said that
councillors elected to the new unitary authorities should ''think
globally'' when considering how services should be provided, to prevent
the wholesale scrapping of efficient and effective local government
organisations.
Citing Strathclyde's school meals service, Catering Direct, as an
example, Mr McFall said it would be a tragedy if experience built up
over the years was lost through ''political vandalism''.
He told delegates at a conference on community regeneration hosted in
Stirling by Central region: ''In Parliament at the moment, we're
protesting at the loss of 6000 high-tech, high-quality jobs from
Rolls-Royce in East Kilbride -- and rightly so -- but in Catering Direct
there are 7000 employees.
''It has served the region well, and served the children of the region
well, yet with local government re-organisation there is a possibility
of its demise.''
Mr McFall said his message to local authorities in Strathclyde and
elsewhere in Scotland was: ''New boundaries have been set -- but do not
set yourselves within these boundaries.
''Don't have a mind-set where the territory stops at your boundaries.
Don't destroy for the sake of destroying, but look beyond your local
boundaries for the future. We do not want any territorial mentality.''
Mr McFall went on to criticise the Government's economic record in
Scotland.
He said that in the last year the profitability of small firms had
almost halved, despite Government claims of recovery, and in each of the
last three years the number of jobs in Scotland had decreased by 2%.
Scotland appeared to be entering an era of ''jobless growth'', with
firms engaging in ''de-layering, workforce re-profiling, out-sourcing''
and generally getting fewer people to do the same amount of work, if not
more.
Monklands East MP Mrs Helen Liddell said there was a need to simplify
the system by which help and grants were offered to new businesses.
She said that in central Glasgow, someone coming along with an idea
that would create jobs could be diverted to 81 different grant-giving
agencies.

THE biggest Labour Party affiliate yesterday delivered a huge snub to
Labour leader Tony Blair's attempt to modernise the party.
The executive of the Transport and General Workers' Union voted to
retain Clause 4, which commits the party to the principle of common
ownership, despite moves to reword the historic phrase.
The 30-member executive decided to urge TGWU delegates -- at a special
Labour conference next month aimed at updating the clause -- to vote
instead for its retention. Trade unions still control 70% of the votes
at Labour Party conference, with the TGWU controling more than 14% of
the total vote.
Meanwhile, the second largest affiliate, the General Municipal and
Boilermakers (12% of total vote), is among a small group of unions
emphasising that it will support a rewrite of Clause 4, provided it also
includes a commitment to the goal of full employment.
Unison, with 11.6% of the vote, also has accepted the principle of
change provided the re-worded clause includes a strong commitment to
public ownership and public service.
However, it has called a meeting of its national political forum to
consider the final wording of any proposed rewrite.
The fourth largest affiliate, the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union (8.6%) is expected to be four-square behind whatever Mr
Blair proposes, and leaders of the shopworkers' union Usdaw (4.8%) and
the Manufacturing Science and Finance Union (3.7%) hope to persuade
their ruling bodies to be equally supportive.
It is against this confused background, and in advance of next week's
special Labour Party executive to discuss the actual wording of any
substitute Clause 4, that the Scottish Labour Party annual conference
will debate the issue later this week, after hearing Mr Blair's views on
the subject.
Even were he to get a ''bloody nose'' at the Scottish conference --
where union affiliates tend to be somewhat to the left of their
English-based parent unions -- a sensibly-reworded Clause 4 should win
approval at the full party conference in London on April 29.
The TGWU said a consultation process had shown that a ''clear
majority'' of TGWU members supported Clause 4, and only a minority
backed calls for a new statement of Labour's aims and values.
General secretary Bill Morris said: ''TGWU members have sent a clear
message that they want the Labour Party to retain Clause 4 as it is.
This reflects the strength of feeling within the union on the principle
of public ownership.''
Subject to the party's special executive meeting, the TGWU's 75
delegates will take the final decision on how to cast the TGWU's vote at
the April 29 party conference, although it is expected they will back
yesterday's executive's decision.
Mr Morris said the consultation process had shown a ''very deep
commitment'' to public ownership. ''That was the recurring theme from
our members who feel very strongly that utilities like water should be
retained under some modicum of public ownership.''
TGWU members had shown that they ''were satisfied'' with Clause 4 as
it stands, Mr Morris said.
The union snub came as Mr Blair was in Barcelona, meeting other
European socialist leaders.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ''I think the important thing is
I believe Tony Blair will win this vote on April 29.''
Asked if the union's decision represented a ''serious snub'' to Mr
Blair, he added: ''I think we've got to recognise that it is part of a
debate.''
The TWGU executive also called for Labour's special conference to be
given the opportunity to vote on retaining the existing Clause 4 rather
than simply voting on the new wording.

Brussels
DEVALUATION of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo late on Sunday
appears to have supported the British Government insistence that a
single currency for Europe in 1997 is a fantasy.
Although the Portuguese were angry at the escudo's being dragged down
by 3.5% because of difficulties afflicting the neighbouring and dominant
peseta, the Spanish themselves had no choice but to ask for a
realignment inside the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The result is that Spain and Portugal together are now less likely to
be among the first countries -- the so-called hard core of currencies --
moving to economic and monetary union (Emu) under the Maastricht
timetable.
Maastricht stipulates that a majority of states must meet certain
criteria involving debt, deficits, inflation, interest and exchange
rates, if the next step towards Emu is to take place on schedule.
Failing that, the EC can decide during 1997 on a date for a single
currency. If there is no agreement, the new currency will automatically
come into existence on the first day of 1999 for those countries that
qualify.
As things now stand, the only countries with a fair chance of
qualifying appear to be Britain, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
France, Austria and Germany. Britain, however, has negotiated the right
to opt out, which means the majority required would be fewer than eight,
especially if the Danes, who also have an opt-out, choose to remain on
the sidelines.
Some doubt remains about Finland and, more particularly, Belgium,
whose debt is a barrier but whose government is adept at dodging
economic problems because of the nation's embedded place in the heart of
the EU and its proximity to the D-mark and the French franc.
But without the Spanish, who were committed to remaining in the
hard-core group, the majority -- on schedule -- now seems lost.
Another potential problem has arisen for the Spanish and Portuguese.
Maastricht states that a country which voluntarily devalues within two
years of a single currency forfeits the right to join in Emu. Much now
depends on whether the EU regards Sunday's events as voluntary. Although
the Spanish asked for a realignment, they are seen as having had little
option.
The root cause of this latest setback for currency stability within
the ERM had nothing to do with international speculators, the
traditional enemy of the grid. The peseta's problems were caused mainly
by the continuing weakness of the scandal-ridden government of prime
minister Felipe Gonzalez and Spain's horrific unemployment which is the
highest in the EU.

PEACE appeared to have broken out in SNP ranks yesterday as the party
attempted to put behind it initial controversy in the Perth and Kinross
selection process, which now shapes up as a four-way fight on Thursday
night.
Even after the weekend's dramatic restoration of Roseanna Cunningham
to the race from which she had withdrawn over scrutiny of her private
life, there was one final sputter of controversy late on Sunday from SNP
president Winnie Ewing's husband Stewart about Ms Cunningham's
suitability.
However, this was soon countermanded by a statement from his wife
saying that Ms Cunningham would make ''a dedicated, talented and
effective MP''.
Meanwhile, Ms Cunningham herself was giving her first account of her
ordeal at the hands of the tabloid press, saying: ''The blame for the
media-feeding frenzy of the past week lies squarely with the person who
leaked the proceedings of the committee to the media. That was a vile
thing to do.''
In an interview with Dundee's Courier newspaper, she spoke of the tide
of party opinion which flowed her way during last week and led to her
re-entering the fray. She also made a strong defence of Mrs Ewing,
saying: ''Winnie has never broken that confidence and never would.
Winnie is the outstanding female Scottish politician of her
generation.''
With the hatchet buried, attention turns to the final selection
meeting on Thursday. Attention has focused on Ms Cunningham, 42, a Scot
brought up in Australia after her family emigrated, and who returned to
Scotland 20 years ago to pursue a career at the Bar.
But three other candidates stand in the way of the environment
spokeswoman in the SNP's Scottish cabinet, who took the late Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn to within just over 2000 votes at the last General
Election. They are:
* Alasdair Morgan, 49, national secretary of the party and a trusted
lieutenant of leader Alex Salmond. He is from Aberfeldy and is married
with two daughters. A computer project manager, he lives in Dunfermline
and has held a string of senior party posts.
* Keith Brown, 33, party transport spokesman, contested Dundee West at
the 1992 General Election and Lothians in the European Election last
year. Married with two children, he went to school in Edinburgh,
university in Dundee, and lives in Dollar. A former Royal Marine, he
works in local government and is rumoured to have impressed in the
preliminary selection meeting.
* Bruce Crawford, 40, the son of a local hotelier, is SNP leader on
Perth and Kinross District Council. A personnel officer in the Civil
Service and married with three sons, he is personable and well-liked,
but lack of experience in parliamentary contests may count against him.
Their fate will be decided by 20 delegates on Thursday night, four
from each of the five branches.

<HEADLINE>Labour accuses British Gas on 'scandal' of share option deal</HEADLINE>

BRITISH Gas chief executive Cedric Brown today will be asked by MPs to
explain a secret share option deal -- worth nearly #3m at the current
share price -- which Labour claims was kept from shareholders and the
public.
Labour's latest disclosures on boardroom salary excess will add to the
growing pressure on the Government to control pay awards for top
executives in the privatised utilities.
This afternoon, Mr Brown will make his second appearance in six weeks
before the Employment Select Committee, as the controversy over his pay
package continues and MPs expressing doubts over his justification for a
#475,000 salary.
At a London news conference yesterday, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown
said British Gas had awarded seven directors options on one million
shares last year, including 268,211 for its chief executive.
Mr Brown called the disclosure ''a new share option scandal, which
Cedric Brown had failed to disclose to the committee when he appeared
before it in January.''
He added: ''Without an announcement to shareholders or the public,
British Gas awarded its directors one million share options in October
and November 1994, including 268,000 to its chief executive, Cedric
Brown.
''This huge award -- six times last year's -- is the biggest share
option pay-out to directors in one year by British Gas.
'' It is almost equal to the total number of outstanding share options
awarded over the previous four years to the current directors of British
Gas.''
Last month, Mr Brown told a tense session of the Employment Committee
that his salary was ''at the median level'' compared with other
executives.
Accused of being tactless and insensitive, he admitted that news of
his pay rise could have been handled differently.
The Shadow Chancellor yesterday urged Mr Brown to tell the committee
''what precise aspects of his performance justifies an increase in the
number of share options awarded to him from 23,000 in 1993 to 268,000 in
1994.''
He added: ''At the time of privatisation, British Gas launched a
campaign to 'Tell Sid'. It is time for a public campaign to 'Tell
Cedric' these awards are unjustifiable, offensive and should be brought
to a halt.''
Labour claims Mr Brown's remuneration package includes a #475,000
annual salary, a long-term share-based bonus scheme worth up to
#593,000, and options on 268,211 shares, worth more than #750,000 at
yesterday's share price.
Mr Brown added that the basic salaries of the seven executive
directors of the British Gas board cost more than #2.5m this year, and
could cost up to #4.7m after an incentive scheme was included.
''With one million share options on top, this multi-million cost
compares with a pre-privatisation figure of #495,000.''
Labour proposes full disclosure of executive pay, placing an
obligation on boards to get prior and explicit approval from
shareholders for pay increases, giving the regulator the power to cut
prices, and taxing executive share options as income.
For the Liberal Democrats, Employment spokesman David Chidgey said Mr
Brown's efforts at self-justification were ''sickening''.
He said: ''After 40 years in the gas industry, Mr Brown must explain
why his personal performance has suddenly been transformed in the last
year to justify a 75% pay rise.
''Alternatively he could try explaining how despite his supposed
talent he was not head-hunted during his long years of low pay in a
nationalised utility.
''It is quite frankly sickening to see an executive running a
privatised near-monopoly, with a large captive market, attempting to
justify the rewards of a true entrepreneur.''

<TEXT>
OFFENDERS are to be electronically tagged in Britain for the first
time, Home Secretary Michael Howard anounced last night.
Trial schemes are to be introduced in Manchester, Reading and Norfolk
for nine months beginning in June, he said in a Commons written reply.
Tagging will involve offenders subject to curfew orders. Any
violations will be reported to the courts.
The tagging of people on bail was introduced in 1989 in three areas of
England: Nottingham, North Tyneside and the Tower Bridge district of
London for a trial period, but discontinued.
Securicor Custodial Services will provide the service which operates
in the United States and other overseas countries. Up to 250,000
offenders have been tagged in the US.
A Home Office spokesman said that that under the scheme a transmitter,
about the size of a large diver's watch, is attached to the ankle or
wrist.
A home unit about the size of a fax machine is placed nearby. When the
offender is within range, radio signals are picked up by the home unit.
The range is then tailored to the specific curfew location -- for the
forthcoming trials it will be set between 20 and 100 metres of a
receiver.
This will enable the offender full freedom of his or her home.
The home unit is connected to a central monitoring unit via a
telephone line and sends a variety of messages when certain events
occur, such as the the equipment being interfered with or the offender
going outside the curfew area.
Securicor Custodial Services will be responsible for presenting
information to the courts, possibly through the Probabation Service,
reporting any violations of a curfew.
Present equipment can only indicate whether an individual is within
range of a receiving unit and is not designed to track anyone who is
away from home.
The Home Office spokesman said that one use of tagging could be to
ensure hooligans banned from football grounds and made subject to curfew
orders while matches take place, did not breach those orders.
The cost of the trials is expected to be about #1.4m.
Powers to introduce tagging in selected areas were first introduced in
the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act.

THE postal workers' union has called for a public inquiry into the
franchising of Crown post offices as a war of words raged over the
effects of yesterday's second 24-hour strike against ''backdoor
privatisation''.
Post Office Counters said the walk-out in 19 regions of the country
including Glasgow, London and Bristol closed only 75 offices and
described the action as a ''complete flop''.
But the Communication Workers Union said there was a 70% response from
the 3500 members called out and accused the Post Office of
''manipulating'' figures and of ''importing'' managers from as far a
field as Inverness, Northern Ireland and even southern England to man
post offices in Strathclyde and Dumfries where support was said to be
over 90%.
PO Counters claimed that 27 out of 35 main post offices in the area
were ''open for business''.In an extension of the tactic used in the
first one-day strike last December, managers from Inverness were
prominent in the East Kilbride Crown Office, while other North of
Scotland accents were much in evidence in the George Square office.
Bellshill Post Office was operated by managers from Northern Ireland,
while customers at Paisley Crown Office were startled to be confronted
by four Englishmen.
Joint general secretary Alan Johnson said the strike had been a
success, giving a national platform to the ''scandal'' of franchising.
He called for a halt to the franchising policy while a public inquiry
was held, adding: ''We believe that the closure and sell-off programme
is stalling in the face of increasing caution from managers and
potential franchisees as well as opposition from the public.''
The union maintained that half the Crown offices had been closed,
leaving 750 throughout Britain, with threats to hundreds more, because
of the policy of transferring them to retail outlets including
superstores.
Mr Johnson added: ''Our members have given up another day's pay to
draw attention to this national scandal and I do not see them being less
determined to press on with this campaign.''
Mr Richard Dykes, managing director of Post Office Counters, said:
''The union call for industrial action by clerical staff at some main
post offices has been a complete flop. The union should now halt plans
for further action.''
Mail deliveries were not affected by the walk-out.

The Home Secretary yesterday moved to strengthen powers in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland to investigate a growing number of alleged
miscarriages of justice.
Mr Howard told the Commons the work would be undertaken by a new fully
independent body, the Criminal Cases Review Commission.
''It will be independent, accessible and open. It will have strong
investigative powers and it will be well resourced,'' he promised.
The move comes after widespread concern over the current system of
dealing with alleged miscarriages of justice, given the lengthy,
ultimately successful appeals in cases like that of the Birmingham Six
and the Guildford Four.
Opening second reading debate on the Criminal Appeal Bill, which
provides for the new Commission, Mr Howard refused to apologise for
having waited before bringing in the reforms.

THE future production of a rare Scottish cheese appeared doomed last
night after a justice of the peace ordered that 528 kilos, worth
#27,000, should be destroyed.
Mr Humphrey Errington, the Lanark farmer who makes Lanark Blue cheese,
said the decision was likely to bankrupt him. He said he would like to
fight the matter in the Court of Session, but claimed he did not have
the money to do so.
The farmer also warned: ''This decision means no specialist
cheesemaker in Britain can feel safe from the threat of closure.''
Lanark Blue -- a brand sold at Harrods and other top stores and bought
by the royal family -- was voluntarily taken off the market by Mr
Errington in December, after a random test on a sample from an Edinburgh
shop was claimed to show much higher than acceptable levels of the
potentially hazardous listeria bacteria.
Tests by environmental health officers at Clydesdale District Council,
in whose area the cheese is produced, endorsed those found by Edinburgh
District Council.
However, following his own laboratory tests, the farmer later
contested the findings of both local authorities, claiming that the
levels of listeria were normal for soft blue cheese and posed no risk.
Local magistrate Elizabeth Wilson, ordered that an independent test
should be carried out on a sample of the cheese during a legal hearing
into Clydesdale's plan to destroy almost Mr Errington's entire stock.
The test confirmed that only six of 50 batches of cheese had levels of
listeria below that demanded acceptable. The six batches were released
back to Mr Errington.
A statement issued by the district council yesterday, said: ''Mrs
Wilson has now issued a judgment on the matter and has informed both the
district council and the company's legal agents that she is of the
opinion that the cheese is unfit for human consumption, and should be
disposed of or destroyed.''
Mr Bob Russell, the council's director of housing and environmental
health, said the cheese would be taken to a prepared landfill site --
outwith Clydesdale because it has no such facility -- where it would be
buried tomorrow.
The threat to the cheese has been linked to moves in the EU and
Britain to clamp down on some soft cheeses in the wake of repeated
scares about food poisoning deaths caused by listeria.
However, Mr Errington, 50, was adamant last night that his cheese --
one of the recently developed varieties which have helped revive the
reputation of Britain's cheesemakers -- was safe to eat.
He said the loss of the 528 kilos of cheese and the cost of legal
action necessary to try to reverse the decision would spell the end of
Lanark Blue, which is made from unpasteurised ewes' milk.
It is produced between April and November and is compared by some with
French Roquefort. Production of Dunsyre Cheese is also likely to cease.
The farmer, who employs seven cheese workers at Oggscastle, Dunsyre,
Lanarkshire, said: ''Almost 63,000 people ate the cheese between the end
of November and the beginning of December, and not one single stomach
upset was reported, as far as I know.''
Mr Errington, who supports his wife Diana and three children aged 15,
13, and 10, added: ''We are going to have to sell the farm. Defending
ourselves and what we have lost is more than the farm can support.''

SCOTLAND'S first private prison, a Category B facility for 500 to 600
men, will be built just outside Glasgow.
The Scottish Prison Service has asked the local planning authority to
have Government land beside Low Moss Prison, Bishopbriggs, rescheduled
in the local plan for prison purposes.
Staff at the Glasgow Resettlement Centre, a refuge for homeless men
which currently occupies part of the site, have told The Herald they
have received unofficial word from the Scottish Office that a new remand
prison is proposed.
There has been immediate local opposition.
Councillor Billy Hendry, Conservative member for the Cadder ward of
Strathkelvin District which includes the site, said the ''local
community is bitterly opposed'', and his view was supported by Labour
MP, Mr Sam Galbraith.
While a number of other sites are being looked at in Central Scotland,
the Bishopbriggs land has the advantage of being close to Glasgow and
its courts. Informed Scottish Office sources say it has emerged as a
clear front runner.
Although Scottish prisons generally are currently 11% overcrowded, the
problems at Barlinnie, the largest, are acute. The Glasgow jail is
holding around 1200 men in accommodation for 852 -- close on 40%
overcrowding -- and the remand wing is heavily overcrowded, with more
than 350.
For years the independent inspectorate has criticised the standards
provided for those on remand in Scotland.
When the private jail plan was first made official last year, the
indications were it would be designed to meet the demands of remand.
Experience in England has led to a change of view here which will mean
the contract awarded to the successful private bidder is more flexible.
There has been controversy in Kirkintilloch and Bishopbriggs on the
basis that the SPS plans to expand Low Moss Prison itself, but that is
unlikely.
However, it is clear there will be considerable local opposition to
the new move.
Mr Hendry said yesterday: ''Bishopbriggs has a population of around
20,000 people and we already have a large prison and a List D school.
''Low Moss is a Category C prison housing less-dangerous men but over
the years there have been regular incidents and escapes. Everyone in the
local community is bitterly opposed to the idea of having
higher-category prisoners on our doorstep.''
Mr Galbraith, MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, also said the local
community was against further prison expansion in the area.
He was ''not in the least surprised'' that the site was now the front
runner for the new private jail, adding: ''It would have been much
better if these matters were handled out in the open.
''I object strongly to getting parliamentary questions answered with a
vague reply designed to put me off the scent. I will not be giving up.''
He was referring to two answers given by Scottish Office Minister,
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the last in January, which said the
suitability of the site for prison facilities was one of a number of
possible options being examined, that no decisions had been taken, and
that any proposal would be subject to an outline planning application.
Earlier, Lord James had told Mr Galbraith that a study would be
carried out to examine the possibility of replacing the existing Low
Moss huts by new houseblocks adjacent to the present site.
Scottish Prison Service spokesman, Mr John Gerrie, repeated yesterday
that no decision has been taken and that studies into various options
are not yet complete.
He said: ''The Secretary of State for Scotland last year asked the
chief executive of the SPS to look at the possibility of building
another prison under the Private Finance Initiative due to the
consistent overcrowding in Scottish prisons.
''The business case for such a development has not yet been completed.
A number of sites are being considered but none has been selected. It is
too early to rule any site out or any site in.''
The resettlement centre next to Low Moss is a refuge for homeless men
which belongs to the DSS. As with the prison itself, it consists of the
huts of a former RAF barrage balloon camp from wartime and the buildings
are in poor condition.
One of only two such centres remaining in the UK, it is scheduled for
closure a year from now, with the 77 men being rehoused in Glasgow.
A staff member at the centre yesterday disclosed they had been told
unofficially that part of the four acres currently occupied by the huts
would become a car park with the prison being built on land, also
belonging to the DSS, lying behind the centre and Low Moss Prison and
formerly the site of large RAF hangers.
When the SPS proposals are finalised, which would have to be almost
immediately if the prison is to be ready within the three-year timescale
mentioned last year, there are likely to be four or five front runners
from the private sector including Group 4 and Securicor.
Scottish Office Ministers are believed to be conscious that Scotland
is lagging in the private jail stakes. Plans are well advanced for one
more in England and one in South Wales.

AYR yesterday spearheaded Labour's drive to increase the
representation of women in Parliament, when the local constituency
association announced it will be insisting on a women-only shortlist in
selecting its candidate to fight the seat in any forthcoming election.
The association is the first in Scotland to volunteer to restrict its
selection on the basis of gender, going along with a conference decision
to insist on women candidates in 50% of seats assessed as ''winnable''.
The constituency chairperson, Mr Douglas Campbell, said the
association had decided ''enthusiastically'' to implement the rule
change.
While the priority in the next election was victory over the
Conservative Party, the association also had the responsibility of
deciding whether or not to assist in changing the face of the Labour
Party in Parliament, where women are badly under-represented, he added.
No shortlist has been drawn up yet.
The association's decision was welcomed warmly by the Shadow Scottish
Secretary, Mr George Robertson, who was visiting the town to help launch
the party's campaign for the forthcoming elections for the new South
Ayrshire unitary authority, being held on April 6.
The sitting Conservative MP, Mr Phil Gallie, condemned the decision as
an insult to his electorate. He accused the constituency association of
kow-towing to pressure from Labour's London office, and indicated that
the decision had strengthened his faith in his ability to retain the
seat, which he won with a majority of 82 in the 1992 election.
The Ayr MP said: ''The people of Ayr deserve the best candidates on
the basis of their abilities, not their sexes.
''This will be a huge insult not only to the people of Ayr but also to
some excellent local Labour councillors, who happen to be male, who
would have made excellent candidates and would have given me very tough
opposition indeed.''
Mr Gallie's chances of a successful defence of his seat have, however,
been eroded by boundary changes which moved the predominantly Tory-
voting area of Alloway into the neighbouring Carrick, Cumnock and Doon
Valley constituency, Labour MP George Foulkes said.

<HEADLINE>Minister admits affair and quits. Major pre-empts scandal by accepting resignation</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister scooped the media yesterday by accepting the
resignation of a Junior Minister who confessed: ''I have had an
affair''. It is the first time in a long four years for Mr Major that he
has been able to pre-empt a scandal before it appears in the press.
The Minister concerned, Mr Robert Hughes, 43, admitted yesterday
outside his London constituency office with his wife, Sandra, standing
beside him, that he had had an affair which ended six months ago.
He said: ''I have put unacceptable pressure on my marriage because
last year I had an affair. Although the affair has been over for more
than six months, I cannot carry out my Ministerial responsibilities at
the same time as putting my marriage back together.''
His wife said: ''I am very distressed. You can't go through something
like this without being very upset about it. Essentially we are a very
happy and united family and we intend to remain that way. I love my
husband and everything will work out for us.''
A former TV journalist, Mr Hughes has three children from his second
marriage to Sandra Vaughan, a local government officer. His first
marriage was dissolved in 1986 after 12 years.
He is replaced by Mr John Horam, who was a Transport Minister in the
last Labour Government. He abandoned Labour to join the SDP and then
transferred to the Tories as the MP for Orpington.
The speed of the resignation operation carried out over the weekend
contrasted with Mr Major's previous experiences of Ministers -- like
former Heritage Secretary David Mellor -- being forced out, despite his
support, by media pressure.
Last Friday, Mr Hughes, who was a Government whip until last July when
he joined the Cabinet Office as number two to Mr David Hunt, the Prime
Minister's ''chief of staff'' and Citizen's Charter Minister, confessed
to Chief Whip Richard Ryder.
He had told his wife of his transgression because they thought he was
about to be exposed in a Sunday newspaper. By Saturday, Mr Major had
accepted his resignation and on Sunday he contacted Mr Horam. There was
no attempt to invite Mr Hughes to stay on and there will be no exchange
of letters between him and the Prime Minister.
This breaks with recent precedent in so far as all sacked or resigning
Ministers, Cabinet or otherwise, have been granted an exchange of
letters with the Prime Minister. The fact that Mr Hughes was the Junior
Minister to Mr Hunt, who is charged with co-ordinating Government
propaganda, required instant action.
Last year, Mr Major let it be known to his Ministers that he would
expect them to resign instantly if they found themselves in personal
difficulties that might compromise the Government. Scottish Minister
Allan Stewart resigned immediately last month when he found himself
involved in a pickaxe fracas with demonstrators against the M77 motorway
extension. But Mr Stewart's incident had already appeared in the press.
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Mr Hughes, the MP for Harrow
West, has left office before the glare of publicity. Yesterday, he
confessed to his constituency party with his wife by his side. His
constituency chairman, Ms Joyce Nickolay, said she was saddened by his
sudden decision to go but respected his reasons.
Mr Hughes, former Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Edward Heath,
is on the pro-European left of the Tory Party. He was first elected in
1987 following two unsuccessful previous attempts.
Mr Horam, 56 today, was elected as a Labour MP for Gateshead West in
1970 and served as a Junior Transport Minister from 1976 to the end of
the Callaghan Government.
He was briefly an Opposition spokesman on economic affairs in 1979 and
then left Labour to join the now-defunct Social Democratic Party in
1981. The 1983 General Election cost him his seat. He joined the Tory
Party four years later and became the Tory MP for Orpington, Kent, in
the 1992 General Election.
* The all-party Committee of Privileges was deadlocked last night
after a 90-minute meeting over the disciplinary issue of the conduct of
MPs who are accused of accepting money to ask questions. Mr David
Tredinnick and Mr Graham Riddick are accused of accepting #1000 to table
Commons questions, along with Scots MP Bill Walker, in an entrapment by
the Sunday Times last summer.

ULSTER Unionists have been approached by pro-Union groups in Scotland
to help field a candidate in the forthcoming by-election for the late
Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's seat.
The Unionists on both sides of the Irish Sea want to make the Ulster
question a major issue in the Perth and Kinross contest in a bid to
spotlight what they regard as double standards in the Government's
approaches to the constitutional questions in Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
However, any such surprise intervention would be unlikely to influence
the chances of the Conservative candidate, Mr John Godfrey, who already
has his work cut out to retain the seat for the party.
Newspaper reports that the Ulster Unionist Party is considering
fielding its own candidate were dismissed last night by Mr Jeffrey
Donaldson, UUP honorary secretary.
He said no-one had been chosen to stand under the Unionist banner, and
emphasised it was not a case of the UUP ''parachuting into Scotland''.
Scottish Unionists had come to them with the suggestion, which was one
they endorsed because the Government was undermining the Union. ''If we
take votes from the hypocritical Tories then we won't lose any tears
over that.''

THE Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, the club which claims to
be the oldest in the sport with a continuous history, has been deleted
from the Scottish Golf Union membership list because it has not paid its
full 1994 subscription, union officials said yesterday.
The 251-year-old club, which drew up the first rules of golf and whose
Muirfield course has hosted 14 Open championships, has paid the SGU only
half of the #5 per capita levy on its 550 members, many of whom are
members of the legal profession, creating a shortfall of #1375.
However, it said the full amount might be forthcoming as soon as the
SGU had a firm plan for its proposed national golf centre which was the
reason for the rise in subscription from #2.40 last year.
The Honourable Company is the only one on the SGU list of more than
600 clubs, accounting for around 200,000 golfers, not to have paid the
full amount. The cash raised has resulted in #400,000 being put aside
for the golf centre which has been under discussion for more than one
year but with no venue so far decided.
Mr Ian Hume, secretary of the SGU, said yesterday: ''They are no
longer members of the union but we will be happy to have them back at
any time.''
Dr George Gormley, the SGU president, added: ''This is not our
decision. It is for Muirfield to decide and they must accept the
constitutional consequences.''
The SGU constitution says subscriptions must be paid in advance by
February 28 so the club is now overdue by more than one year.
However, the lapsed membership was news to the captain at Muirfield,
Mr Douglas Foulis, who last night was under the impression that the club
was still affiliated.
He said: ''To the best of my knowledge, we are still members and there
seems to be a misunderstanding. We are not picking bones with anyone. We
get on very well with the SGU and there is no row.''
He did confirm the Honourable Company was not in agreement with the
idea of clubs providing money up front for the national golf centre.
Mr Foulis said: ''Whenever we are told what they are to do, I am quite
sure we will support them. The idea has a lot to commend it for the
furtherance of golf in Scotland.''
In the meantime, members of the Honourable Company will not be allowed
into SGU-run competitions which is unlikely to have any effect as there
were no entries from the club last year. Neither will the club be
allowed to issue handicaps to members who play mainly social golf at
Muirfield, but most also belong to other clubs and can be issued with
official handicaps there.

THE finals of a seven-a-side football competition for 11 and
12-year-olds were postponed last night after Queen's Park Football Club,
owners of Hampden Park, decided the games could damage the pitch and
threaten tonight's Scotland vs Brazil schoolboy international.
To protect the Hampden surface, Queen's Park officials and the
Scottish Schools' Football Association had planned to switch the
semi-finals to the Castlemilk sports complex. Only the final would be
played at Hampden.
But the four schools involved were so upset by the decision that they
threatened to boycott the competition -- sponsored by The Herald --
unless all three games were played at the national stadium.
The teams from John Ogilvie High in Hamilton, St Bride's High in East
Kilbride, Peebles High, and Our Lady and St Patrick's High in Dumbarton,
had been looking forward to playing at Hampden and the decision left
many of the young hopefuls in tears.
However in the face of the threatened boycott, the SSFA opted for a
postponement.
The two semis were due to be played before the under-15
Scotland-Brazil international, with the final being contested at
half-time. The games last for 20 minutes each and would have been played
across the pitch at one end of the Hampden ground, between one of the
penalty areas and the centre line.
One parent, Mr Jim Doyle, whose son Jamie plays for St Bride's, said
last night: ''The whole idea was to give kids the chance to play at
Hampden. For most it is the only chance they will have to play at the
national stadium, and to take the semi-finals away at this late stage is
a bit ridiculous.''
Mr Neil Forsyth, a technical teacher who runs the Peebles High team,
said: ''We are absolutely delighted to have got through three qualifying
rounds in the Borders, Edinburgh, and Glasgow with the carrot for the
young boys of playing at Hampden.
''But it was then suggested that the two semis should be played away
from the ground because the boys could cut up the pitch. The boys we
have weigh four-stones-nothing when they are soaking wet. It is
outrageous to think that 11 and 12-year-olds could rip the playing
surface apart.
''The four schools have spoken together and decided that, if they
cannot all play at Hampden, nobody will take part because the whole
thing is going to be devalued.
''We are trying to encourage youngsters, but they are being kicked in
the teeth. The result is not important to us. What is important is
giving these youngsters the opportunity to play at Hampden.''
The Queen's Park secretary, Mr Alistair McKay, said: ''The weather has
been fierce over the last month. We have a monumental battle to get the
pitch ready for any game.
''At the moment it is far from ideal. It is very heavy and
waterlogged. Our priority now has to be the under-15 international
against Brazil. There can only be one shot at playing that.
''We could have more adverse weather in the meantime and the pitch
will have to be forked to try to make it playable. I fully understand
the disappointment that the seven-a-side teams must feel.
''However, that has to be ancillary to getting the Brazil match played
and we have done our very best by offering to play the final on the
pitch.''
The SSFA general secretary, Mr John Watson, said the organisation
regretted the postponement. ''Due to the inclement weather it was going
to be necessary to move the semi-finals to an alternative venue and this
proved unacceptable to the competing schools, which want the final
stages to be held over.
''The SSFA wishes to acknowledge the efforts made by Queen's Park to
accommodate the final at Hampden Park . . . and regrets that the
competing schools felt unable to regard this as an acceptable option.''
Mr Alex McMenemy, assistant general secretary of the SSFA, said
Queen's Park could not have been more helpful.
''All along, they have warned us that the state of the pitch was
causing concern, but a decision was delayed to see if matters would
improve,'' he said.

CHINESE porcelain which lay aboard a merchant ship sunk in 1817 in the
Straits of Malacca, fetched more than #1m at a Christie's auction
yesterday in Amsterdam.
The 24,000 pieces of blue and white porcelain were salvaged from an
Indian ship which traded between the English East India Company and
Canton, south China, and each year carried cotton and opium to the
Chinese. Her wreck was discovered three years ago.
The sale was held on behalf of the Malaysian Government.

* From Labour contributor to the Socialist newspaper Tribune to
Conservative Minister for Public Service is a notable political journey.
Even more so if, en route, you have been a Labour MP, a Labour
Minister, a founder member of the SDP, a convert to Conservatism and a
Conservative MP.
This progress from neo-Marxism to conviction Thatcherism has finally
brought Orpington MP John Horam office in a Tory Government, a day
before his 56th birthday and nearly 16 years after he stepped down as
Transport Under-Secretary in Jim Callaghan's Labour Government.
Chance brought him to the despatch box yesterday within a short time
of being given the job, but unlike the average new entrant, he had three
years' experience under his belt from the time when he and his Secretary
of State, William (now Lord) Rodgers, used to provide a foretaste of
what an SDP Government might have been like as they fielded questions
with a good deal less acrimony than most departments in that
increasingly beleaguered administration.
Although Mr Dennis Skinner shouted ''double rat'' at him in the
chamber, there seemed little malice in it and MPs from both sides
welcomed him to the job.

ONE of the sad things about the departure of Mr Robert (Bob) Hughes
from Ministerial office, apart from the circumstances, is that, from
being a never-say-die veteran of hopeless seats which he fought always
knowing he was going to lose, he finally made it to the lush pastures of
Harrow West, part of Sir John Betjeman's Metroland. Then after a
seven-year wait, he finally became a Minister in last July's reshuffle.
Persistence had paid off.
Yesterday's tributes to him in the chamber showed he had made a modest
mark, with a sense of humour usually appreciated on both sides of the
House.
A Young Conservative local chairman, he organised the Hounslow Britain
in Europe campaign in 1975 during the referendum and moved on to become
Young Conservative National Chairman. There he achieved considerable but
not very profitable publicity by attacking Mrs Thatcher for not
attending their conference after, he said, 20,000 YC's had ''broken
their backs'' working for her election.
When he was eventually accepted and elected for Harrow East, he took a
generally loyalist line without disowning his left-wing past.
He voted against both hanging and abortion. His wife Sandra is a Roman
Catholic.
Although described as ''one of the pushier new boys'' when he arrived
in 1987, he seemed always likely to achieve Ministerial rank.
He had made a fair start and might have hoped to move up to Minister
of State level before the next election when the affair cut his career
short. At 43, he is young enough to come back if he achieves his first
objective of rebuilding his marriage.

FEARS were growing last night for two English climbers who have been
missing in sub-zero conditions on Cairngorm since Saturday.
A massive air and ground search of the snow-covered mountains will be
resumed today, but rescuers -- hampered by the fact that the climbers
left no details of their route -- fear the two could be buried beneath
avalanche debris.
Another climber was found dead yesterday after being caught in an
avalanche in the hills near Grey Mare's Tail in Dumfriesshire.
Official warnings had been issued during the weekend and yesterday
about the high risk of avalanches in the Cairngorms.
The Cairngorm and RAF Kinloss mountain rescue teams were assisted by
sniffer-dogs and an RAF Sea King helicopter from Lossiemouth.
Overnight blizzards were forecast for the Lairig Ghru and Loch Avon
areas, where the search is concentrated.
Police said last night that they were not yet able to reveal the
identities of the climbers because relatives had not been informed, but
confirmed that they were both men in their early 20s from the Lake
District.
The lack of information about their intended route meant the search
had to be spread over a wide area in the highest mountain massif in
Britain.
Inspector Colin MacKintosh, of Aviemore police, said last night:
''Obviously, we are now very concerned for these men, particularly given
the length of time they have been up on the mountain and because of the
high avalanche risk.''
The man found dead in Dumfriesshire was named as Mr Mervin Kelly, 49,
of Blakehope Court, Tweedbank. His family had raised the alarm when he
failed to return home from a day's walking on Sunday night.
Mr Kelly, a joiner and father of two, was found buried in avalanche
debris at about 700m on the 822m White Coomb just after noon and was
airlifted to Borders General Hospital, near Melrose but was found to be
dead on arrival.
Mr Gavin Shaw, a member of the Search and Rescue Dog Association which
found Mr Kelly said: ''It is the first occasion I can remember of
someone being killed in an avalanche in that area but if you get a lot
of snow on a steep hillside then you can have an avalanche anywhere.''
Two other climbers who had been reported missing in the Cairngorms
turned up safe and well yesterday.

A SON of the manse will fight Labour's corner in the Perth and Kinross
by-election caused by the death of Conservative MP Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn.
Mr Douglas Alexander, 27, a trainee solicitor, who spent four years as
a researcher for Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown was selected at Perth
last night.
He is single, works for Brodies in Edinburgh and joined the Labour
Party at the age of 14 in Bishopton, Renfrewshire, where his father, the
Rev Douglas Alexander, is minister of Erskine Parish Church. Mr
Alexander jnr's sister, Wendy, is also a former researcher for Labour.
His adoption was a close run decision with the constituency selection
committee voting in his favour by 29 votes to 24.
The loser is Ms Susan Deacon, 31, of Musselburgh, East Lothian, a
business analyst who is director of the MBA programme at Heriot-Watt
University.
Mr Alexander said afterwards: ''I am delighted to have been selected.
There is everything to play for in this by-election.
''The Tories and the SNP are in disarray. We have been winning the
arguments and now it is a matter of winning the votes for Labour.''
He said that Labour would fight ''tooth and claw'' for every vote in
Perth and Kinross where two of the issues would be the 2500 unemployed,
and the need for assistance to deal with damage caused in the 1993
floods.

ONE of America's leading Roman Catholic colleges has cancelled a
planned award, the Ignatius Medal, to Baroness Thatcher.
Officials at Boston College said it had received a call from the
former Prime Minister's office saying she would be unavailable on the
date of the award: May 5, the 14th anniversary of the death of IRA
hunger striker Bobby Sands.
There had been protests from the Irish-American community on the
issue. New York Cardinal John O'Connor had expressed ''perplexity and
deep concern at the plan''.
College spokesman Doug Whiting said she would be honoured at a later
date, ''but not in the form of the Ignatius Medal''.

THE collapsed Barings Bank has donated more than #700,000 to the Tory
Party since Conservatives came to power in 1979, it was claimed in the
Commons yesterday.
Labour's Dennis Skinner (Bolsover), demanded a Government statement,
saying: ''It's just now been discovered that Barings Bank have allocated
over the years of the Tory Government more than #700,000 to Tory party
coffers.
''On the basis of that evidence and the collapse of this bank, I
believe the public demand a statement from the appropriate Minister so
we can question what's happened to that money and whether that money
should be put back.''
Speaker Betty Boothroyd said she had no authority to require a
statement from any Minister.
Mr Skinner said later his figure was for donations between 1979 and
1994 and was based on records compiled by the magazine Labour Research
which is not part of the Labour Party.
A Tory spokeswoman said her party did not comment on donations it
received. She added that they would appear in companies' accounts.
Labour City spokesman Alistair Darling also demanded a statement from
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.
He said that on Friday Mr Clarke had admitted on the BBC withholding
certain details when he made a statement in the House last Monday.
Mr Darling asked: ''In the light of what's happened over the last week
-- especially the concerns over the role of the Bank of England in this
affair -- and in view of the fact that the takeover is now going ahead,
is there any mechanism for requiring the Chancellor to come back and
explain what he meant when he said he hadn't revealed the whole story to
us?''
The Speaker insisted she could not force a Minister to make a
statement.

COMEDIAN Freddie Starr's gardener claimed jewellery items allegedly
stolen from the entertainer were gifts in return for sexual favours, a
jury was told yesterday.
Mr Robin Coxhead, 44, who is gay, told police in an interview after
his arrest that some #41,000 worth of jewellery he was alleged to have
stolen, was given to him by Mr Starr for performing sex acts.
Mr Starr denied the claim at Reading Crown Court.
''It's totally and utterly despicable and that's why I'm in court
now,'' he said. ''I've come down here to defend myself against people
who do this to people in the public eye.
''It's all about money. It's not about truth. It's the way the world
is and I can't change the world.''
Mr Coxhead, from Audley Street, Reading, Berkshire, has denied three
theft charges involving a variety of jewellery such as watches,
bracelets and an engagement ring, worth more than #10,000, which
belonged to Mr Starr's former wife, Sandra.
Mr Paul Reid, prosecuting, said Mr Coxhead, who admitted being #38,000
in debt, was interviewed by police after his arrest last March.
Mr Reid told the jury how the alleged theft came to light after the
Starrs, then still married, returned from a three-week holiday to
Florida in February 1994.
Mr Coxhead had been looking after their #1.5m mansion close to Waltham
St Lawrence, near Maidenhead.
''He was interviewed and admitted having jewellery which he said he
had disposed of. He said he had been given it over a period of five
years by Freddie Starr,'' Mr Reid said.
The court heard that Mr Coxhead had worked for the Starrs since 1987
and had become more of a friend than just an employee.
Mr Reid said that in addition to a monthly wage of #727 he received
perks including the use of a cottage and an Audi car. In 1991 the Starrs
gave the gardener #5000 after he told them he had been mugged.
He said Mr Coxhead had abused this friendship and trust while in
charge of the Starrs' house. He entertained boyfriends there, helped
himself to food and drink and tried to keep the Starrs' housekeeper, Mrs
Susan Englefield, away from the home which she was supposed to clean
three times a week, Mr Reid said.
''He had mentioned to her that he had tried to sell a quantity of
jewellery for #13,000,'' he said, adding that Mrs Englefield mentioned
this later to Mrs Starr.
Mrs Starr told the jury: ''I was very upset because I thought such a
lot of him. I didn't expect him to treat me like this.''
Mr Starr told the court: ''I didn't give any of those items away to
anybody.''
Mr Richard Kovalevsky, defending, said the comic's addiction to drugs
at the time made him prone to violent mood swings.
The trial continues.

SCOTLAND'S only opt-out school, the two-year Dornoch Academy, has
applied, for the second time, to upgrade to a full six-year secondary.
If Scottish Secretary Ian Lang again refuses, it could spell the end
of the flagship of the Government's opting-out policy in Scotland.
Until 1968, Dornoch was a senior secondary, and determination to win
back that status drove the opt-out move.
Delay in achieving it has frustrated some parents. The forthcoming
intake of 24 out of a possible 39 from Dornoch's two feeder primaries:
Dornoch and Bonar Bridge, is down on last year by about 6%.
According to Mrs Jennifer Cameron, spokeswoman for the Dornoch Academy
Board of Management, the single biggest drawback for parents remains the
upgrading issue. ''If we get permission, we are confident the numbers
will show an upturn.''
Mrs Cameron added that another very important complication was
Highland Regional Council's decision to include the Dornoch catchment
area in those of both Golspie High School and Tain Royal Academy.
''Before, our children went to Golspie at the beginning of third year.
The first stage of their Standard Grade work would have been started in
Dornoch in the third term of S2. That was a fairly simple matter. All
that happened was the history teacher here would phone the history
teacher in Golspie to hear what work should be done.
''As a result of the change in delineated areas, we can't do that
because Tain and Golspie do not follow parallel courses. It is now the
recommendation of the director of education that pupils transfer to
either Tain or Golspie to begin their Standard Grade work in early
May.''
This is a crucial plank to Dornoch's submission. The school argues
that as a result of this change it cannot operate under the terms of its
role as a two-year school.
The board of management stresses it has 200 pupil places, whereas
Golspie and Tain are close to capacity.

THE winner of Scotland's second highest Lottery pay-out of #387,000
picked his lucky numbers on a twenty-minute drive between Killearn and
Stirling.
Mr Andrew Davidson, 29, -- an unemployed gardener --
selected the numbers from car registration plates, road signs, and
from passing lorries on the way to buy his first tickets.
Mr Davidson and his wife Jean, who live with their three children in a
council house in Killearn, set aside #5 each week for Lottery tickets
and had already won #10 three times with the same numbers, before
matching five plus the bonus ball on Saturday.
They now plan to have a holiday, buy a house and a Land Rover
Discovery, having already sold their 1983 Cavalier to a relative for #1.
The Scott family of Bishopbriggs won #800,000 on the Lottery.

<TEXT>
COUNCILLORS yesterday gave the go-ahead for a controversial scheme to
rehabilitate problem families in a ''Colditz'' tenement block at the
heart of a respectable council estate.
But local residents pledged to continue their fight against the plans
for a three-storey ''sin-bin'' which they fear will become a ghetto.
The #1m project to refurbish an existing tenement block is regarded by
social workers as a pioneering scheme. Four families at a time will
spend six months in the unit being educated in social behaviour. A play
therapist will teach them how to play with their children and a
nutritionist will advise on healthy food.
The flats are to be ringed with a six-foot steel fence, floodlit, and
kept under surveillance by four security cameras.
Residents will have to sign a contract promising good behaviour and
will have to keep to a curfew of 10.30pm.
Six counsellors will live with the tenants to help them reform their
anti-social habits.
Yesterday, SNP and Labour councillors joined forces at Tayside's
social work committee and voted, by 16 votes to 2, to go ahead with the
scheme. The committee also approved a strategy proposing more
consultation with the local community in the operation of the unit.
But community leaders in St Mary's, Dundee, where the block is to be
sited, angrily rejected the new offer of consultation and vowed to
continue their opposition.
Mrs Lynn Vaughan, chairperson of St Mary's community action, said:
''This offer of consultation is a whitewash. We should have been
consulted about the scheme in the first place.
''What kind of consultation is it, to offer us a say in the running of
something we don't want?''
The plan will now go to a full meeting of the council on March 30
where it is expected to be rubber-stamped.
But independent councillor Ian Borthwick, who represents the ward,
yesterday promised to take the opposition further.
He said, ''The hastily-cobbled together offer of consultation in the
operation of this project is completely phoney. It is like closing the
railway to Dundee and then asking people what they think of it.''
But Merv Rolfe, leader of the Labour group on Tayside, supports the
plan by Dundee District Council and the National Children's Home
charity.
He said: ''This scheme will go ahead. This is a very, very worthwhile
project.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair was challenged yesterday to defend his
proposal for a Scottish Parliament in the light of reports that Labour
is to defer setting up regional assemblies in England.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said the reason given was that there was
''no consensus'' in England on the desirability of assemblies.
However, Mr Lang added, ''it surely cannot have escaped your notice
that this is also true in Scotland.''
He said: ''The SNP want separatism, the Liberal Democrats want
federalism, Labour propose assymetrical devolution and Conservatives
want to maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom.
''If consensus is to be the benchmark against which you judge Labour's
proposals for constitutional change, then you should also abandon your
plans for a separate Parliament in Edinburgh or at the very least commit
yourself to a referendum.
''If a referendum was appropriate in 1979, why would it not be
appropriate for your present proposals?''
Mr Lang said that both Mr Blair and Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson had been keen to emphasise that the English regional
assemblies provided an answer to the ''anomaly'' as they phrased it of
the West Lothian question.
''Now that you are bereft of even this fig leaf to hide your
embarrassment, it is high time you provided an honest answer to this and
the many other inconsistencies in your proposals for a separate
parliament in Edinburgh.''
A Labour Party spokesman said that as Mr Lang had consistently opposed
devolution his alleged anxiety about the future of English assemblies
was simply a case of playing political games.
Claims of a split between Mr Blair and his deputy John Prescott over
the creation of regional assemblies in England were strongly denied
yesterday.
Mr Prescott, when pressed in a television interview whether Labour was
not committed to regional assemblies any more, appeared to contradict Mr
Blair by replying
''No, I don't say that that's the position . . . What we are doing is
reviewing it.''
Shadow Home Secretary, Jack Straw responsible for drawing up the
scheme, dismissed the claim of a split between Mr Blair and Mr Prescott
as ''whistling in the wind''.

MORE troops could be sent to train in former Warsaw Pact countries in
a bid to cut the need for intensive use of UK areas, the Government said
yesterday.
However, junior Armed Forces Minister Lord Henley warned that, with
the return of much of the Rhine Army, there would be a need for more
training in areas such as Otterburn, in Northumberland and Salisbury
Plain.
Lord Henley said at Question Time: ''We will try to increase the
amount of training we can do in Eastern Europe, particularly training
for our forces still remaining in Germany, so long as that is
cost-efficient.''
He added that the ''draw down'' of forces in Germany, with
introduction of new weapons, was placing ''significant demands'' on
existing UK training areas.

LABOUR yesterday called for an independent inquiry into the state of
the Forth Rail Bridge.
Shadow transport spokesman Henry McLeish said the response by
Railtrack and the Scottish Office to anxieties over the bridge's
long-term future had been woefully inadequate.
''We are sick and tired of the buck-passing between the Transport
Secretary and the Scottish Secretary, and the confusion created by his
junior Ministers about this issue,'' he told a news conference at North
Queensferry.
''We are demanding an independent engineering assessment of the bridge
to be commissioned by Railtrack.''
Railtrack has insisted that it is safe, and that dilapidation of some
of the superstructure is merely superficial. However, Mr McLeish said it
was essential that a thorough investigation of corrosion was carried
out.
''Railtrack is caught between the rock of the Transport Secretary and
a hard place of having to cut costs. We want to ensure that the Forth
Bridge -- probably the most important symbol of Scotland -- is fully
utilised as a vital rail link, with improved services, well into the
next millennium,'' he added.
Mr McLeish said the uncertainty about the bridge was mirrored by the
Government's rail privatisation programme. It was costing #700m, but all
it had produced was layer upon layer of bureaucracy as Motorail and
sleeper services, both vital to Scottish tourism, were being cut.
''It is an unbelievable mess. Track-use charges and leasing costs for
rolling stock are crippling Scotland's railway network. It is high time
the Scottish Secretary stood up in Cabinet to defend it,'' he added.
Councillor John McDougall, leader of Fife Regional Council, said it
was essential for the region's economy to maintain rail links over the
Tay and Forth bridges, and keep full access to the UK network.
However, the pressure from privatisation would be to cut services or
increase fares.
''Our concern is that the result would be to bypass Fife from the rest
of the network. What we should be doing is encouraging people to use
public transport and develop our tourist and trading links on the east
coast,'' he added.

<HEADLINE>French group in bid for British water company</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979517699</RECORDNO>

LABOUR last night condemned the ''Tory-sponsored open season on public
utilities'' after a French group announced a takeover bid for a
privatised British water company.
The company, Northumbrian Water, saw its shares rocket as it became
the first privatised water company to receive such a bid when Lyonnaise
des Eaux revealed a proposed cash offer.
Before yesterday's moves, Northumbrian was valued at #507m by the
Stock Market. Water sector experts expected that Lyonnaise, based in
Paris, may have to put more than #700m on the table.
The bid could open the floodgates for takeover moves for other British
water companies, mirroring growing interest in the power sector after
the bid for Northern Electric by Trafalgar House.
Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said the offer
was ''a predictable follow-on from the decision not to refer the bid for
Northern Electric to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission''.
He added: ''We are now into a period of Tory-sponsored open season on
public utilities with the consumers' interests the least of
participants' concerns.''
The Labour MP for Newcastle Central, Mr Jim Cousins, was equally
scathing. He said: ''The public utilities -- gas, electricity, water --
are a licence to print money for the people who own them. It's natural.
They have a high market value, they are worth a lot to shareholders, and
they are going to be bought and sold like packets of frozen peas.''
The GMB union, which is not recognised by Northumbrian Water, was
cautious. Mr Derek McCabe, the senior GMB officer for the water industry
in the northern region, said: ''Our initial reaction is not one of
shock, horror''.
He said that there was obviously concern at the prospect of an
overseas company achieving a near monopoly of the regional water
industry.
''But our major concerns are that whoever is in control of
Northumbrian Water should have a firm commitment to investing in the
workforce and in the region as a whole.''
The French group intends to merge Newcastle-based Northumbrian with
North East Water company, which it already owns, but has not set an
offer price because it expects the move to be referred to the Monopolies
Commission.
However, the Northumbrian board described the Lyonnaise statement as
unsolicited and unwelcome, and advised shareholders to sit tight.
North East Water serves customers in the Newcastle and Sunderland
areas, and the French company also owns the Essex and Suffolk Water
company.
Mr Philippe Brongniart, executive vice-president of Lyonnaise, said:
''Northumbrian and North East Water already work together in a number of
areas and we strongly believe that merging our UK water interests with
Northumbrian will strengthen both businesses, providing further benefits
for customers''.
He went on: ''It has always been our approach to seek an agreed deal
in the past,'' and revealed that an approach had first been made to
Northumbrian ''a few months ago''. However, Northumbrian said
shareholders should be aware that Lyonnaise ''is not making an offer,
nor has it made any commitment to do so''.
It added: ''Lyonnaise states that it intends to enter into
negotiations with the board of Northumbrian. Northumbrian already
co-operates with North East Water in a number of areas to the benefit of
customers.
''Following an approach by Lyonnaise, Northumbrian has in the recent
past discussed opportunities to buy certain of Lyonnaise's UK interests,
but nothing has come of these discussions owing to Lyonnaise's
unrealistic views on value.
''Lyonnaise's unsolicited statement is unwelcome. There is an
unacceptable absence of specific terms, it will create business
disruption, and expose shareholders, customers, and employees to a
prolonged period of uncertainty.
''The board remains confident in Northumbrian's strong prospects as an
independent group. The board strongly recommends shareholders to take no
action at this stage.''

<TEXT>
A PROMINENT doctor who has admitted carrying out ''mercy killings'' of
two severely handicapped babies was warned last night that the
deliberate killing of any human being was an ''illegal act''.
It was also contrary to a doctor's ethical obligations, junior Health
Minister Tom Sackville said in a Commons written reply to Tory Ann
Winterton.
He added it was for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to
decide whether any action should be taken over the claims made by Dr
Richard Nicholson, deputy director of the Institute of Medical Ethics
and editor of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics.
Mrs Winterton, MP for Congleton, had asked the Minister to comment on
Dr Nicholson's admission on the 3-D television programme last month that
he had hastened the deaths of two babies with overdoses of pain-killing
drugs.
The killings had taken place ''20 years ago at hospitals which have
been closed for 10 years or more'', Dr Nicholson said.
He would not identify the hospitals and said he could not remember the
names of the babies who had been suffering from extreme spina bifida and
water on the brain.
They had been expected to die in days but had hung on for several
weeks before he gave them drugs which could have caused their deaths.
''There was an intention to stop this slow process of dying and allow
the babies to die relatively soon,'' Dr Nicholson told the programme.
He added he had not been in clinical practice for more than 10 years.
Mr Sackville commented: ''The deliberate killing of any human being is
an illegal act.
''It is for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to decide
whether any action should be taken over Dr Nicholson's claims.''
The Minister noted: ''Current Home Office criminal statistics do not
identify any cases involving the killing of newborn handicapped babies
by doctors or others.''
Mr Sackville emphasised: ''All doctors are well aware that the
deliberate killing of patients is illegal. It is also contrary to their
ethical obligations.''

POLICE investigating attacks on men in Edinburgh's Regent Road area
are working on a theory that two men from the West of Scotland have been
deliberately targeting homosexuals and that they themselves could be
gays.
The most recent incident happened early on Sunday morning.
As a 25-year-old man walked along Royal Terrace, an area known for
attacks on gay men, a man approached and spoke to him for a few seconds,
then another came up from behind and held him by the arms.
The victim was punched on the face and body, and his watch stolen.
A police spokesman said the culprits, with Glasgow or West of Scotland
accents, appeared to have been visiting gay nightspots in the city
centre over the past few weeks.
''We cannot rule out the possibility that these are the same two men
and that they are targeting their victims. This latest incident is
similar to attacks in the Regent Road area last month,'' he said.
The police are advising people against walking alone in quiet,
poorly-lit streets, pathways and parkland after being at late-night
entertainment venues and to take a bus or a taxi.
The spokesman said: ''We can't overlook the possibility that gays are
being targeted. The culprits could even be gay themselves. They could be
using late-night venues to select targets, though we do not really know
whether the various incidents are linked or not.
''We are saying to people that, if they go to this sort of area, and
whether you are gay or not, you are liable to be the victim of an
attack.''
The attackers on Sunday were both white and around 5ft 5in. One was in
his early twenties, had dark hair cut in a step style, slim and wore a
long, black leather jacket, white T-shirt and blue jeans. He was called
John by his accomplice, who was stocky, a few years older, and wore a
green baseball cap with a dark peak.
Anyone with information is asked to contact the police.
