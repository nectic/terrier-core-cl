* FOR almost 30 years, the appearance of Gertrude Shilling (left) at
Royal Ascot was an event in itself, or at least a sideshow. Her
over-the-top headgear, always designed for her by her son David, earned
her the nickname ''the Ascot mascot''. Among her most memorable
ensembles were the huge love-heart she wore in 1972; the futuristic
space outfit which she christened ''Ascot 1986'' in 1976 and the
newspaper dress with matching paper-boat style hat modelled in 1971.
In 1989, Shilling announced that she was retiring from Ascot, saying
that her heart wasn't in it since her husband's death. She made her
farewell appearance in a hat shaped like a picnic hamper -- complete
with a plateful of strawberries and glasses. This year, however,
Shilling has obviously found the heart to make a comeback with a
striking, spangly poppy-red vengeance.

YOU need to be an optimist to be a builder in Scotland. Just when any
reasonable person would have expected the Scottish market to be well
into its stride after the long years of low activity, clouds of gloom
and doom rolling up from the South have obscured some home truths.
The fact is that in every part of Scotland house prices are higher
than they were at the peak of the boom in 1988, according to the Halifax
Building Society.
Most parts of the country have seen increases of at least 10%, while
Dumfries and Galloway has enjoyed steady rises for six years which have
created an average price increase of 52%. The Grampian region's prices
are up by more than 40%, on average. The Halifax calculates that across
the Central Belt there has been average increases of more than 20 %.
Scotland has virtually no negative equity. Most people caught in the
trap of having borrowed much more than their home is now worth are in
the South of England - and most of them bought their homes in the last
three or four months before the bubble burst at the beginning of 1989.
Having escaped relatively unscathed from the bonfire of insanities
which swept through middle and southern England, Scotland's market
should be enjoying a firm recovery. Yet builders are having to labour
hard and long to win sales - which is good news for buyers, because
there are bargains out there.
Prices on many building sites have stood still for at least 12 months,
and one builder says that he is charging virtually the same price as
five years ago.
Keen to win market share and cashflow, most builders are offering
incentives such as carpets, furnishings, turfed gardens, and even, on
occasion, free garages. Tough-minded buyers are finding that they can
negotitate the price downwards on some sites, especially if the
development is selling slowly or if the builder is coming towards the
end of the financial year.
Many builders are doing their bit to tackle the buyer's worst fear -
the worry that they will not manage to sell their current home.
Part-exchange deals have become a widespread part of the building
industry's marketing strategy. Others will pay your estate agency fees,
or provide free advertising, to help you sell your current home.
Low prices, low interest rates and help with selling your current home
all combine to make new-build property very affordable at the moment.
Alex Steel of L&amp;C Homes says: ''Sales are still tough to achieve, so
most builders are offering a wide range of incentives. At some of our
sites, such as Erskine, I'll build you a garage for free. We are selling
some houses at virtually the same prices as they were fetching five
years ago - that's got to be a bargain!''
Other L&amp;C incentives include part-exchange, assistance with selling
your current home, and, on certain properties, the builder will throw in
white goods in the kitchen or turf the back garden.
''It's a very patchy market, extremely difficult to predict,'' says
Ian Mahon of Bellway Homes. ''We had a good start to the year but things
seemed to fall away in May. Then sales and visitor levels picked up
again in the last two or three weeks, which is very encouraging.''
Mahon is not totally dismayed by the market. Bellway is seeing steady
sales on many sites and is poised to open up a clutch of new
developments from Paisley to Edinburgh. He is frustrated by the sluggish
nature of the market and believes that people's unrealistic expectations
are holding back activity.
''A lot of people want to buy a new home, but they can't sell their
current home. Often this is because they want too much for it.''
He is convinced that the market offers great potential for buyers.
''There really has never been a better time to buy. Interest rates are
low and most prices have virtually stood still for at least the last 12
months. That can't last for much longer.''
Bellway prefers to avoid offering incentives, but with the financial
year due to end at the end of July anyone who moves quickly could
benefit from a cash-back offer.
Specialist Glasgow builder David Nelson, managing director of Adam
(Scotland) Ltd, blames the media for the lack of the feel-good factor.
''The barrage of doom and gloom in the national newspapers and on
television, which refers to the state of the housing market South of the
Border, has dented the confidence of Scottish house owners.''
While visitor levels at his Bearsden development remain high, he says
that most buyers prefer to sell before they sign on the dotted line.
''This has the effect of building up a large number of people who have
a pent-up desire to move house but do not wish to commit themselves
until they have finalised the sale of their own property.
''It does seem a pity that the property market in Scotland has been
adversely affected by all the facts and figures regarding negative
equity and property prices slumping South of the Border. Let's stop
peddling all the doom and gloom from down south and let's start blowing
our own trumpet up here in Scotland.''

<HEADLINE>Chairman Peter Carr says trading has worsened.  What Everyone Wants hit hard by the Lottery and cool weather</HEADLINE>

THE National Lottery is one of the three factors that have dealt a
blow to the Glasgow-based What Everyone Wants (WEW) discount stores
group and led to chairman Peter Carr making a trading warning yesterday.
Two of the elements are general for the retail trade -- the weather
and the absence of the ''feel-good factor'' among consumers.
However, the Lottery had pulled in the majority of its money from the
customer groups that patronised the 78 WEW stores the most.
Saturday is the busiest shopping day of the week and many customers
would typically spend #5 on tickets between Friday evening and the time
the Lottery tills were closed on Saturday.
Mr Carr said this June was the coldest on record and the weather was
the most damaging reason for the downturn in sales.
Encouragingly, the store in Clydebank which was revamped has performed
significantly better than the rest of the portfolio of which just 29
outlets are in Scotland and the others in the North of England and
Ireland.
In a formal statement to the Stock Exchange, he said that in common
with other High Street retailers, trading has worsened since the interim
results for the half year to January 28 were announced on April 20.
Although these showed a pre-tax profit of #5.81m, it seems clear that
there will be a loss in the second half although WEW is confident that
the full-year results will be better than the #3.25m total of last year.
That points to losses in the closing six months of up to #2m.
Mr Carr was under a Stock Exchange obligation to make the move as
profit expectations in the City of around #6m were too high.
The shares fell 4p to 20p and to a low point for the year to
capitalise the company at #29m.
It seems likely that profits could emerge at around #4m or perhaps a
touch more.
What Everyone Wants is not the first nor will it be the last to issue
an adverse trading statement. The biggest company so far has been
English High Street giant W H Smith which has been hard hit by
supermarket sales of greetings cards and newspapers. There have also
been warnings in the last week from Etam and Allders.
There was a pointer in the WEW interim statement when it was revealed
that like for like sales had fallen by 7.3% because of the weak level of
trading in the autumn in stores that had not been refurbished. It was
said at the time that since January there had been a recovery in these
stores with trading ahead of the previous year.
What Everyone Wants was founded in Glasgow by Gerald and Vera
Weisfield in 1971 and was sold to ambitious Philip Green's Amber Day in
1989 for #47m.
Mr Carr took over as chairman in 1993 after a period of considerable
management turmoil -- Mr Green having resigned in the previous year
after institutional pressure, receiving a controversial #1.13m golden
handshake.

BREATHING and porous materials group Porvair is buying the Selee
ceramic metals filtration manufacturer of North Carolina for a total of
#23.6m.
It made a pre-tax profit of #1.9m the 10 months to the end of April on
turnover of #14.1m.
The deal which is immediately earnings enhancing is being part
financed by a one for two rights issue to raise #20.3m on the basis of
one new share at 285p for every two held.
In the first six months, Porvair increased pre-tax profits 51% to
#1.3m and the dividend by one eigth to 1.8p.
City expectations are for full-year profits of #5.1m (#3.1m) and
earnings of 18p.

WHEN house sales slowed down Miller Homes knew where to go - right
back to the drawing board. ''We decided to stop building on all of our
sites until we had completely redesigned our house styles,'' says
Lindsay Gilchrist, sales manager for the West of Scotland. ''As a
result, we can now offer buyers a very different choice to that which
was available a few years ago.''
The return to the drawing board was only part of the Edinburgh-based
builder's blueprint for the future. The other part of the plan was to
become a major player in the West of Scotland.
''We have had a presence around Glasgow for many years, but we have
now decided to go for the West in a big way,'' says Lindsay Gilchrist.
''The West of Scotland has the highest population, yet home ownership is
relatively low, so we see it as a major market.'' By rolling its wagons
westwards Miller has seen growing success at places like Barrhead,
Canniesburn, Ayr, East Kilbride, Old Kilpatrick, Erskine, Paisley and
Newton Mearns.
''East Kilbride is amazing. The town is growing all the time and
people are moving in from all over Lanarkshire. The market in Ayr is
getting stronger again, although at the moment it is mainly locals
trading up or down, rather than commuters, who are driving the market.''
Miller's most prestigious development in the West of Scotland is at
Mearns Park in Newton Mearns where the builder has opened a new Leven
showhouse. Specially designed for the sloping site as a split-level
house, it marks the release of the last phase at this attractive
development which consists of 20 four-bedroom detached properties,
including three new split-level designs.
The split-level homes are available in three different styles.
The Leven includes a spacious lounge with a separate large
kitchen/breakfast room, dining room, a downstairs study and an integral
double garage. The Rannoch style includes a large lounge, main bedroom
with en-suite bathroom, detached double garage and landscaped gardens.
The Newburgh includes large lounge, separate dining room,
kitchen/family room, bathroom, en-suite shower room, separate study and
integral double garage.
In addition, there are three other styles of four-bedroom detached
properties available. Prices range from #136,000 for a four-bedroom
Findhorn to #182,000 for a four-bedroom split-level Newburgh.
''Our research has shown significant customer interest and we are very
confident that potential buyers will be very excited by the new
designs,'' says Lindsay Gilchrist.
Meanwhile, Miller has released first phase of a new development at
Millstream Court in Paisley's Seedhill Road. The development consists of
flats offering from one to three bedrooms and prices start from around
#42,000.
In the East of Scotland, the company's development at Aberlady in East
Lothian has achieved seven sales within a short period and is reporting
strong interest in the remaining 14 homes. The development is close to
the village yet overlooks open countryside. Prices at Aberlady range
from #85,000 for a three-bedroom home to #116,000 for four bedrooms.

OPTIMISTIC that the house market in Scotland is getting back into its
stride, Tay Homes is firing ahead on a number of developments across the
Central Belt.
''The new home buying market is picking up and we are currently
witnessing a resurgence of interest,'' says Iain Stewart, Tay Homes's
sales and marketing director.
The company is offering a range of incentives, including a fixed rate
mortgage and a first time buyer's package.
Purchasers at the company's Woodend Meadows scheme in Kilwinning will
be eligible for a 5.95% mortgage, fixed until February 1997.
The builder has opened a new three-bedroom Beauly showhome at
Kilwinning which features a fresh interior design with particular
emphasis on the use of shades of blue. It costs from #75,000 and
includes a single garage.
New homes at Woodend Meadows range from the three-bedroom
semi-detached Jura, from #75,000, and the three-bedroom detached Troon
and Rannoch, from #72,000 and #69,750 respectively.
Meanwhile, Tay Homes is at work on a number of other new homes
developments including Hamilton, Larkhall, and Airdrie.
Two new showhomes have been opened at Caldercraig View, the company's
Airdrie development. Both are four-bedroom detached properties, an Ailsa
and a Lewis.
The Ailsa features a predominantly black and beech coloured kitchen.
The living room and bedrooms are also professionally designed with
distinctive colour schemes.
The development will comprise 130 three and four-bedroom homes when
complete.
Prices for three-bedroom properties range from #65,500 to #83,250. The
four-bedroom homes cost from #85,500 to #119,500.
Tay Homes also plans to open two view houses at Airdrie later this
month. Both the Rannoch and the Harris will be three-bedroom homes.

A VEIN of clear common sense, it has been said, runs through the
musical personality of Thea Musgrave. But that is to ignore the vein of
theatrical imagination which, as yesterday's lunchtime recital in
celebration of her honorary doctorate confirmed, remains a striking
feature of her instrumental works.
It was heard instantly in Piccolo Play, a sequence of short
''responses'' to the titles of harpsichord pieces by Couperin, in which
she transformed the French composer's spiky sound world into a
combination of piercing, darting piccolo tones and shimmering, rippling
piano ones. The Frenchness of the original inspiration seemed to bring
out her own French connections in gleaming pictures of frogs and
butterflies.
There were hints of Ravel here, but also of Charles Ives in march
music depicting the fog of war. Above all, throughout the programme,
there were timbres as lucid and fastidious as Boulez's. Her keen, often
witty sense of theatre made its point in an impromptu for flute, oboe,
and clarinet, where the players indulged in animated, sometimes heated,
conversation, of a sort for which she was finding her own instrumental
voice around 1970.
Her Music for Horn and Piano of the same period revealed another
ingredient of her musical make-up, but a darker, emotionally more
ambiguous sound world was projected by her wind quintet of 1992, which
formed the programme's climax. Here a solo bassoon cast disturbing
shadows over a work whose wit seemed considerably more mordant. Fine,
intent performances from Scotland's expert chamber group.

IT never rains but it pours. And when it rained last winter, problems
came pouring down relentlessly on the heads of the beleagured builders.
When he officiated at a small ceremony to mark the first buyers to
move into his Henderland Gate development in Bearsden, David Nelson of
builders Adam (Scotland) allowed himself a quiet glow of satisfaction.
After the appalling winter which saw some of the highest rainfalls on
record, his development was two months behind schedule. But as he handed
over the keys, a bunch of flowers, and a bottle of champagne to Janice
and Peter Jamieson, he knew that the sun was coming out at last.
Located on a leafy eight-acre site at the top of Henderland Road, just
off the Switchback Road, Henderland Gate will have a total of 43 units
ranging in size from two to five bedrooms.
Bordered by a perimeter of mature trees, the #6.5 million development
is being landscaped with rockeries, shrubs and more trees. Prices range
from #96,000 to #198,000.

''.''
A LEADING Scottish house builder is hoping that Glasgow's Botanic
Gardens will bear new fruit in the home sales sector.
While usually a specialist in detached properties, CALA Homes is
developing two blocks of flats at Kirklee Wynd in the city's West End.
The scheme is well under construction on a leafy former allotment site
overlooking the River Kelvin near the Botanic Gardens. The showflat at
the development has a summer theme appropriate to the location.
Designer Pat Moretti has used French furniture and a Provencal-style
stone fireplace in the sitting room. The hall has a Spanish console
table and mirror. Colours throughout are mainly turquoise, pink, green
and lemon.
The two and three-bedroom apartments at Kirklee have a high
specification, with en-suite bathrooms and top-quality kitchens with
oven and hob, fridge/freezer, microwave, dishwasher and washing
machine/tumble drier.
Prices start at #89,000.
Meanwhile, last month provided CALA with record sales figures.
''May was our best month of the year,'' said managing director Alan
Downie. ''We achieved over #4m in sales across a range of sites. That's
15% up on the figure for the equivalent month in 1994. Our new
developments at Sherbrooke Gardens, Pollokshields and Kirklee in Glasgow
are attracting excellent visitor levels and sales.''
In the East of Scotland, CALA has already sold 10 detached properties
in advance of the launch of two new showhouses at the firm's latest
development in Linlithgow.

THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
Paris-based forecasting agency, has issued a timely warning that UK
interest rates may have to rise to around 8% to slow the economy down.
There has been an apparent freeze on base rates, currently 6.75%,
since the contentious meeting on May 5 between the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. The minutes are being
published this morning.
The City has been assuming that the two men were at loggerheads over
rates. The OECD report, which was compiled last month, seems to be
closer to the Bank's view than the Treasury's.
The UK economy, which grew at 3.8% last year, is forecast to slow
down, though only to 3.4% this year and 3% next year. These projections
are at the upper end of independent economists' expectations and were
fixed before the most recent evidence of weakness in domestic activity.
''Even so short-term interest rates may have to be raised further,
perhaps to around 8%, to slow demand growth to that of potential output
beyond 1996,'' the report said.
Tax increases would restrain demand this year; thereater rate rises
would have an increasing impact. ''Such a configuration would prepare
the ground for a soft-landing beyond 1996,'' the OECD claimed.
However, the organisation warned that there would be a further threat
to inflation if the pound, which has lost nearly 5% of its value this
year, stayed weak.
''The decline (in sterling) does not reflect the currently favourable
economic fundamentals. But if the depreciation is sustained it would be
equivalent to a modest easing of monetary conditions with higher
inflationary pressure.''
The pound's plight is thought to have been the main factor in the
Bank's concern about the Government missing its inflation target and its
presumed advice to the Chancellor that rates should have been raised
last month.
The report forecasts growth of 2.75% this year and next for the 25
OECD member nations after a downward revision from 2.9% because of the
protracted slowdown in Japan and the effect of the Mexican crisis.
Yesterday the agency's chief economist, Kumiharu Shigehara, warned
that growth in the US and Japan could be less than forecast in the
official report. On the other side of the Atlantic Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan conceded that there could be a marginal decline
in American GDP in the current quarter.
The OECD lent no support to the clamour for lower US interest rates to
avert a recession, and it expects German rates to begin rising again
later this year. The report also assumes a further half-point increase
in short-term American rates.
Back in the UK there were strong numbers from two unexpected quarters.
The broad measure of the money supply, M4, rose by 0.8% in May taking
the annual rate up from 5.4% to 6.3%, the first time it has been in the
upper half of its 3% to 9% monitoring range since September 1991.
The Building Societies Association also revealed a sharp recovery in
mortgage lending last month from the depressed level in April.
The strength of broad money was reflected in another very strong rise
in M4 lending which increased by #5500m after a #4700m rise in April.
Recent M4 figures have been distorted by Glaxo's borrowing to buy
Wellcome, but the effect should be diminishing as the enlarged company
isues Eurobonds to repay debt.
Lending to the personal sector for anything other than house purchase
remained strong. Credit card borrowing surged ahead by #200m.
However, British Bankers' figures showed a net repayment by
manufacturers after a string of monthly increases. The suspicion is that
manufacturers are tapping overseas banks for funds.
The figures also showed a sharp decline in bank advances to finance
house purchase. This more than offset the stronger figures from the
building societies, which would seem to be gaining market share on the
back of attrative fixed rate offers.
Gross and net advances by building societies increased by 20% and 35%
respectively in May; both were 9% higher than in May of last year. Net
new commitments also showed gains and outstanding commitments were at
their highest level since June 1992.
With further rises in base rates likely later in the year the housing
market seems set to remain the weakest link in the economic chain.

AN East of Scotland builder has gone forth to bridge the property
market. Over half the properties at Riverside View, a development by
Roselink overlooking the Forth at South Queensferry, were reserved
before work began on the site.
The 18 two-bedroom apartments are double-glazed and equipped with gas
central heating. Prices of the remaining flats range from #51,450 to
#62,500, including car parking.
The development is in Hopetoun Road, just 200 yards from the old
harbour and the centre of South Queensferry. Both the airport and the
motorway are easily accessible, and the centre of Edinburgh is less than
half-an-hour's drive.
''There can't be many sites in Scotland that offer such a view,'' says
Mike Earrey, director of Roselink. ''Residents will enjoy an
uninterrupted vista across the Forth to Fife, framed by the two
bridges.''

FOR a nation which sent emigrants to every corner of the globe,
Scotland is a country with a surprisingly parochial outlook on
house-buying decisions. Most people move home within a fairly short
distance - often a couple of miles.
Pollokshields people move upmarket by heading uphill towards Newton
Mearns or Eaglesham. West-enders prefer to move from Byres Road to
Bearsden, rather than probe the final frontier of Planet Southside.
With its developments spread across the breadth of Scotland, Beazer
Homes is reporting a ''significant'' level of sales to purchasers who
have strong connections with the area in which they buy.
At its Irvine development, Park View, the company has sold 27 of the
first 30 to be released - all of them to people with local connections.
The trend has continued at the company's Dunottar Park development at
Coatbridge where the final phase has just been released.
Sales director Maureen Anderson says: ''Many of our developments have
proved very popular with people who are from the area or have friends or
family there. Both Park View in Irvine and Dunottar Park in Coatbridge
have been very consistent in this.
''Our new Sunnyside development, also at Coatbridge, looks set to
continue this trend with sales so far made to people who have an
established association with the area.'' With the option of one and
two-bedroom flats starting at #39,995 and two-bedroom end-terrace houses
at #49,995, Sunnyside is also likely to attract first time buyers, she
believes.
Meanwhile, Beazer Homes hopes to attract house hunters who don't have
a property to sell to its developments at Paisley, Erskine, and
Clydebank.
The company is providing the ''ready to buy'' with a choice of five
three-bedroom semi-detached homes, each set within a cul-de-sac at Park
Vale in Erskine, for #69,995.
Meanwhile at its Park Grange development in Clydebank, Beazer has
recently released its four-bedroom detached Bute showhome with extras
included. Sales director Maureen Anderson has reported significant
interest in the remaining properties at these developments.
''Both Park Vale and Park Grange have proved very popular by their
quiet but accessible proximity. Judging by the amount of interest shown
recently in these properties, we expect most of the remaining homes top
be sold within the next few weeks.''
Meanwhile, the company has almost sold out at its Gleniffer Gate
development in Paisley, with prices ranging from #59,495 for the
three-bedroom semi-detached Ettrick, to #82,495 for the three-bedroom
detached Culzean carpeted view house.

BETT HOMES is an East of Scotland-based firm which in the West has
been is gambling on the pulling power of its new showhome at the
company's Woodlea development at Newton Mearns. It should be a winner.
The Rothesay showhome is a five-bedroom detached house on two levels
with integral double garage. Two of its key selling points are its
expansive country-style dining and living kitchen and the main bedroom.
The latter is possibly the largest bedroom currently available in a
showhome in the West of Scotland.
The design of the house is based on ''a fresh approach to living.'' A
recent survey of Bett's customers showed that an increasing number of
people want living space in the kitchen.
''The design is an old one which we have changed to meet customer
preferences,'' says sales manager Kareen Davidson. ''Most people who
come to Woodlea are very surprised by the size of the kitchen and the
master bedroom.''
The kitchen comes with a large dining area which makes the whole room
substantially larger than many of the lounges found in showhomes today.
''The house is great for entertaining in a casual style. You can chat
to your guests while cooking and, after the meal, the patio doors allow
direct access to the garden,'' says Kareen Davidson.
With its en-suite bathroom, the bedroom runs the whole depth of the
house from back to front and has plenty of space for a couple of
armchairs or a settee.
''Sometimes the bedroom is the only place where mum can get away from
the kids and unwind, but most bedrooms are too small for anything except
but a bed and a wardrobe. This one offers the chance of flopping into an
amchair with a good book.''
Prices at Woodlea range from #189,000 to #212,000 featuring a total of
19 homes in a mix of four and five-bedroom detached homes with garages
in four house styles.
At Newton Mearns housebuyers can choose from a range of quality fitted
kitchens with integral appliances and have a choice of bathroom style
and colour. The houses also feature double glazing, gas fired central
heating and garages.
''People who want a house in this price range are looking for a great
many extras,'' says Kareen Davidson. ''They expect a good looking
exterior with many luxurious interior fittings. They are not an easy
sale - these people are very discerning and know what they want.''
She has noted a key change in the attitude of house-buyers over the
last couple of years.
''People are no longer buying a home as an investment, they are buying
it primarily as a place in which to live. That is why we spend so much
time and effort ensuring that it is the kind of place in which they
would love to live.''
A similar development to Woodlea is under construction at Polmaise
Road, Stirling, featuring four and five-bedroom villas and three-bedroom
apartments.

CAR park king Sir Donald Gosling is to bring his National Parking
Corporation to the market within the next four years.
Meanwhile he is to receive a multi-million dividend from the company
he founded with Ronald Hobson in 1949.
The two joint chairmen, their families and charitable trusts are to
get #132m between them as a special dividend from the company, which
takes in National Car Parks and the Green Flag breakdown service, which
is sponsoring the England football team.
The Gosling and Hobson stakes total 72%. Institutions bought an
interest in National Parking in 1986 at 155p a share and now all
shareholders will receive a dividend of the same amount.
''The dividend proposal and our commitment to seek a full Stock
Exchange listing for the company's shares at an appropriate time within
the next four years marks the start of a new phase in the evolution of
NPC,'' said chief executive Bob Mackenzie, who joined the group last
month.
Sir Donald and Mr Hobson built up their business using bombsites in
London. Profits in the year to last March came to #48m, down slightly
from #50.5m, on turnover of #285m. Last year a group of executives
backed by institutions tried to mount a management buyout, reportedly
offering #600m.
The attempt failed when the controlling shareholders held out for
more.
The two chairmen are already among the UK's richest people.
In the latest list of the wealthy compiled by The Sunday Times, Mr
Hobson was joint 35th with a fortune estimated at #250m and Sir Donald
was ranked 52nd with #200m.

WHITBREAD chairman Sir Michael Angus has thrown his considerable
weight behind the various calls for the referral of the proposed #425m
agreed Scottish &amp; Newcastle acquisition of the Courage brewing
subsidiary from Foster's to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
He told yesterday's annual meeting that the market share of the merged
company would lead to the biggest ever concentration in UK brewing. It
would also trigger a series of actions by other brewers to protect or
enhance their positions. Failure to make a reference would mark a
significant shift in UK competition policy.
Sir Michael added that it would amount to a re-writing of the rules
while the game was still in progress and might well be open to challenge
in the courts.
S&amp;N was playing a straight bat to the Angus call. A spokesman said
that each case has to be considered on its merits. He added that the
merger would be a geographic fit in that S&amp;N is active in Scotland and
the North of England while Courage is concentrated in southern England.
He also said there was a European dimension to be considered.
The Office of Fair Trading is expected to make its recommendation on
whether there should be MMC action when it gives its report to President
of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine probably next week.

THE Stonehouse-based Wilson Home Builders have opened a new showhome
at The Park, Hamilton.
The new showhouse is The Windsor detached villa which has lounge,
dining room, family room, main bedroom with en-suite shower room and
three further bedrooms. The kitchen and double integral garage are
linked by a utility room.
The development at The Park is now nearly finished, with only a small
number of detached homes remaining. There is however, still a choice of
three different styles, all of which incorporate a comprehensive
specification, including double glazing, gas central heating, security
alarm systems, and double garages, kitchens with integral appliances and
fitted bathrooms.
In addition to the detached villas, a number of three-bedroom
apartments are still available.
Prices at The Park range from #139,950 to #164,950 for the villas and
#77,600 for the apartments.

MORRISON Bowmore, whose whisky portfolio includes the Bowmore Islay
single malt and the Auchentoshan Lowland malt, has been named the
first-ever Distiller of the Year at the international Vinexpo trade fair
in Bordeaux.
The Glasgow-based company won the trophy when its brands were chosen
for ''supreme excellence'' from hundreds of rival spirits worldwide,
gins, vodkas, and brandies as well as whiskies, by a panel of seven
international judges.
Brian Morrison, the company's managing director, called the award one
of the most significant developments in the company's history. ''It is
also a great boost for the Scotch whisky industry at a time when so much
comment is being made about the long term future, particularly in the
UK.
''There is much to be optimistic about the future of the industry and
this award proves that Scotch is alive and well.
It proves that, when it comes to quality and presentation, whisky is
the drink above all others.''
As well as winning the Distiller of the Year accolade, Morrison
Bowmore also carried off the best single malt whisky in the up to
12-years-old category with Bowmore Legend. Sales of the company's
principal single malt, Bowmore, rose 25% last year.
After yesterday's award, the company could celebrate in style at
Chateau Lagrange, source of the third growth St Julien claret.
Lagrange and, since last year,
Morrison Bowmore are both owned by the major Japanese drinks group,
Suntory.

HAZLEWOOD Foods has completed its restructuring and believes that it
has a strong basis on which to build future profitability, helped by new
product launches and further cost-reduction measures.
This is just as well because profits last year were 32% lower at #35m.
The shortfall was largely because of costs associated with selling or
closing 13 loss-making businesses with 1500 job losses.
It was a tale of two halves with margins staging a recovery in the
second half to 6.1 from 3.6. Earnings per share excluding exceptionals
dropped to 10.89p from 16.0p but the dividend was held at 6.7p. Dividend
cover fell to 1.6 times from 2.5 times but Hazlewood hopes to rebuild
its cover in the years ahead as well as further reduce its gearing which
was 85% last year. Interest cover was four times, down from 5.7 times
previously.
The group is focused on well-defined markets. For example, in the UK
it has 29% of the own-label ready meals market and a 11% share of the
ethnic finger food market items such as onion bhajis and spring rolls.
It is particularly optimistic about the prospects for its ready meals
and convenience food division.
Hazlewood supplies all the major supermarket groups except Marks &amp;
Spencer and is supplying food items to petrol retailers on a trial
basis. Forecourts are fast developing into major shopping zones and
Hazlewood hopes to offer its distribution and marketing expertise.
It has made a conscious decision to move into the value-added end of
food manufacture rather than the cheaper commodity end where there are
pricing pressures. Alongside ready meals, it makes cook-in salsa sauces
and supplies fresh herbs in pots. More recently it has entered the ''New
Age'' non-alcoholic drinks market distributing products such as guarana
juice and Snapple.
The shares have been out of favour for much of the year, along with
the rest of the food manufacturing sector. They touched an all time low
of 95p shortly after the disappointing interims but have since staged a
cautious recovery. Yesterday, Hazlewood shares gained 8p to 115p.

DESPITE the obvious negative effects of the recession, the rise in
home ownership in Scotland over the past few years has continued.
One initiative that has proved particularly successful has been
public/ private sector house-building partnerships, and these have
worked particularly well in inner city areas and at peripheral estates
where previously there had been little or no private house building
Every year since 1990, over 10% of all new house-building starts in
Scotland have been supported by the Scottish Homes GRO Grants for Owner
Occupation scheme - a total of 7700 new homes for sale since its
inception - and this year a further #27 million will be invested through
GRO Grants to build a further 1850 new homes for sale
Scottish Homes has recently issued new guidelines on GRO Grants in an
effort to encourage more private builders to become involved in
housebuilding partnerships. Average grants awarded are around 25%, but
grants of up to 40% of the total developm ent costs of projects are
available.
The new guidelines have been drawn up after consultation with the
Scottish Builders Employers Federation (SBEF). The chairman of SBEF's
Partnership Committee, Calum Murray, who is also the commercial director
of Beazer Partnership Homes welcomes the new guidelines, and sees the
GRO Grants as having made a major impact on the Scottish housebuilding
scene, especially for the first time buyer
He said: ''These improvements in procedures and guidelines, which we
will keep under review, can only help increase the pace and impact of
housebuilding activity in Scotland and this will be welcomed by
housebuilders, large or small.''
Ian Mahon, divisional director of Bellway Homes in Scotland echoed
that response. He said: ''It is an excellent initiative which helps us
to provide affordable houses for owner occupation in areas where this
would not otherwise be possible. The GRO Grant has been such a success
in helping first time purchasers onto the housing ladder, that we would
be delighted to see it extended into other market sectors an, of course,
available for many years to come.''
There are three particular types of development that attract Gro Grant
funding. Those projects which are part of area-based urban regeneration
programmes and introduce or increase the private sector housing
provision in areas of predominantly ren ted housing or improve the
quality and variety of home ownership in older urban districts, are
likely to be successful in obtaining grants.
The third type of development that would attract this type of funding
is where affordable owner-occupied housing is provided in areas where
there is a shortage or where low income households have difficulty
buying their homes. It is further aimed at people on low incomes, like
first time buyers.
The targetted areas for the grants include four Urban Partnership
Areas, fifteen Smaller Urban Renewal Initiatives, and other priorities
identified in Scottish Homes' District Plans, and those eligible to
apply include private developers, housing trusts and building societies,
and housing associations registered with Scottish Homes.

KEEPING their customers loyal is one of the challenges faced by
builders of new houses. Since few people change home more than four or
five times in their lives, the idea of brand loyalty is not easy to
achieve.
In a bid to keep its buyers ''feeling good'' about their new home long
after they moved in, Wimpey Homes has launched a magazine for its
customers.
The first issue of Bright Ideas! includes features on the secrets of
showhome design, ideas for the garden, the latest products and gadgets,
a guide to holidays in the Greek Islands, and an opportunity to win a
weekend for two in Paris.
Keith Cushen, managing director of Wimpey Homes, believes the new
publication will be welcomed by his customers. ''It is important to us
that we can keep in contact with our customers and help them make the
most of their homes.
We used our extensive research with our customers to design Bright
Ideas! so that it would be of interest to them, giving practical advice
as well as more general features rather than simply being another
marketing tool.''
Published three times a year, the magazine has been mailed to everyone
who purchased a Wimpey home since 1988.
Meanwhile, Wimpey Homes has won two awards for its two-bedroom
semi-detached house The Cary. The home picked up the Evening Standard
Home of the Year Award and the Best New First Time Buyers Home.
The prizewinning house-style is available at Wimpey's developments at:
Aberdeen's Cove Bay, Carmyle, Coatbridge, Dunfermline, Edinburgh (off
Lasswade Road), Newton Mearns, Prestwick, and Uddingston.

KEN GALLACHER,Chief football writer
SCOTLAND'S football fans have been warned that they could find
themselves locked out of the European Championship finals if the
national side qualifies for the matches in England next summer.
The Tartan Army could have as little as 7000 tickets for the games
across the Border, and SFA spokesman David Findlay admitted yesterday:
''This would create a major security problem for the organisers and the
SFA.''
The SFA gave the first indication of their concern when they announced
the sale of tickets for the Hampden qualifying game against Greece in
August.
They advised supporters: ''In the event of Scotland qualifying for
EURO '96, only a limited number of tickets will be made available to
Scotland by the organisers. Priority will be given to those who are
members of the Scotland Travel Club.
''If any additional tickets are available, and dependent upon the
decision of the relevant authorities, consideration will be given to
regular attenders at Scotland's European Championship qualifying matches
at the national stadium.
''It is imperative, therefore, that ticket stubs for this and our
other EURO '96 home matches are retained.''
Later, Findlay stressed: ''This will be a headache for us -- a
pleasant headache, because we will have qualified, of course. But also
the headache of trying to fit a quart into a pint pot. That is what the
probable ticket allocation means.
''The figures mentioned vary between 7000 and 10,000 and that won't
meet the demand we expect. So far the organisers report that 300,000 of
the one million tickets which will be available have already been taken
up. That tells you the extent of the demand.''
Findlay said that the scramble for tickets for the crunch game against
the Greeks has begun -- two months in advance of the August 16 match.
Thirty-eight thousand tickets go on sale today and advance orders were
sitting at 1500 last night.
Scotland coach Craig Brown exhorted the support: ''Come along to this
game and get behind the team. We need your help.''
Brown faces three home matches and if he racks up victories against
Greece, Finland and San Marino the Scots will be in the finals.
''It is in our own hands,'' said Brown. ''If we defeat Greece and
Finland then we go to the finals ahead of them. The games comes early
for us, but there are important friendly fixtures which will have the
players ready for it.''

* THIS is the high season for special editions -- cars loaded with
extra equipment at trimmed-down prices -- and several make their
appearance this week.
Renault is offering the Clio Oasis with sunroof, five-speed gearbox,
better upholstery and sound system from #6995, undercutting the usual
entry-level Prima on which the Oasis is based.Nissan showrooms have the
Micra Hollywood, the Primera Action, Terrano Seeker, 100 NX Pacific,
Sunny Preview and Sunny Special. The Cavalier's 20-year production run
is celebrated with the Cavalier Classic at #11,875.
An entirely different kind of special edition is the ''Series McRae''
Subaru Impreza Turbo 4WD saloon. Costing #22,999 and prepared by the
Prodrive team at Banbury, this 208bhp flat-four engined high-performance
job marks Colin McRae's victory in the 1994 RAC Rally.
* WHILE applauding June Henderson-Laird's well-publicised charity
drive round the Scottish coast, I wonder about the claim that the route
was the one pioneered in 1923 by Arrol-Johnston ''of Kirkcudbright and
Renfrew''. The company started in Glasgow, moved to Paisley and ended
its days at Dumfries. For a while it did build the separate Galloway
make at Tongland in Kirkcudbrightshire, but that is a not very near
miss.
* SOME figures from Daihatsu suggest that employees who opt for a
company van, rather than a private car, could save a fair amount of
money in the process.
Daihatsu -- which, as you might expect, has three new van versions of
its 4x4 Sportrak on offer -- calculates that user-choosers who pick a
van could be anything from #35 to #190 per month in pocket, depending on
their business mileage and personal tax bracket.
The new Sportrak vans, with varying equipment levels, cost from #8901
to #11,795.
* SUNDAY'S race meeting at Knockhill will see Tony Caig (Ford Fiesta)
defending his lead in the Goodyear Eagle road saloons championship.
Points are allocated according to how well a driver finishes in his
car's capacity class; so, although Caig could hold on to his
championship lead, he may be outgunned in the race itself by more
powerful cars like the Sierra Cosworths of Andrew Forrest and Mario
Caira, or comeback driver Sandy McEwen's BMW M3.
Other races on the programme include three for the tubular-chassis,
Kevlar-bodied Eurocars. These Mondeo look-alikes, racing in Scotland for
the first time, use 230bhp Ford V6 engines and fairly skinny tyres which
make them an intentional handful under pressure.
* ALTHOUGH the improved political situation means that Ireland --
north and south -- has come back into favour for new-model press
launches, with major test drives already held there this year by
Vauxhall, BMW and Daihatsu, manufacturers have also been boosting the
Scottish economy. Honda and Fiat have based recent UK launches here, Kia
will be at Loch Lomond later in the month, while Ford has, most
unusually, been running a joint UK/German launch in Sutherland.

MONKLANDSGATE is sordid, petty, small-time stuff, but it goes deeper
than individual delinquency. That we should censure and if necessary
punish, but not go on blithely afterwards as if the problem had been
solved. The fault lies not only in a few godfathers. It lies just as
much in a political structure which has allowed the worst in them to
ooze out.
We shall never make human beings on average better, yet we ought to be
able to arrange matters so that the old Adam is restrained from doing
his worst. That is in fact what democratic systems try to arrange. When
they fail, even at a trivial local level, we are well-advised to ask
whether the failure arises from the system. The question is especially
pointed for us in Scotland now, because of the possible chance in the
next few years to construct a new political structure, better than the
old one, we hope -- or not, as the case may be.
The first fault in the political structure of Monklands is its
likeness to a one-party state, in common with the West of Scotland
generally. In democratic principle, there can be no objection. I think
the voters are mad, but they are perfectly entitled to elect the Labour
Party in perpetuity if they want.
With every respect to that democratic principle, it still exacts a
high prize. Corruption is endemic to one-party states the world over,
and especially so when they rest on democratic principle, rather than on
the mere violence of tyrants.
In such cases, the democracy itself is perverted, because votes are
bought. It is indeed no true democracy when, by hook or by crook, its
leaders endow themselves with the means of rewarding enough groups of
voters to secure a permanent majority. Politics in any serious sense
then dies; there is just an exchange of patronage from above for
servility from below.
Broadly speaking, this is precisely the system that the West of
Scotland has evolved for itself over the past half-century and more. Its
rulers have steadily gathered into their hands the power to reward their
hirelings, through cheap rents, through allocation of housing, through
jobs in the public sector, through capital investments favouring this
place or that, through calling in the aid of central government and its
many agencies on any pretext they can think up.
Especially on the last count, they have also steadily relieved
themselves of the obligation to pay, which means to bear responsibility,
for all this. And irresponsibility is another symptom of the death of
democracy.
These elements were well in evidence in Monklands. In the past they
have been well in evidence in Glasgow, back to the 1940s, when the
Secretary of State threatened to eject the councillors and send in his
own commissioners to the City Chambers, up to the 1970s, when for once
Labour actually lost control through its henchmen's scandalous
behaviour. The same elements are again in evidence in Renfrew even now.
We need not doubt that the West of Scotland is pretty rotten.
What is to be done? Perhaps, with so much practical socialism about,
we might hope for the perfection of humanity at which it eventually
aims. Professor Robert Black takes this line in his report. If the
councillors of Monklands in future rely on ''rational argument and the
submission of relevant evidence,'' on ''appropriate planning criteria,''
on the ''disclosure of pecuniary and other interests,'' on ''openness
and transparency,'' and if the Knights of St Columba are as ready as the
Freemasons to declare their interest -- why, all will be well.
Another possibility would be to throw Labour out, but the legions of
bribed voters have predictably just passed up a fine chance of doing
that.
Our attention is perforce concentrated on the political structure. If
we establish such vast systems of local influence, we must expect to
attract people whose prime interest lies in playing them. They may claim
to stand for compassion or social justice, even fool themselves and
others into believing that they do. But what they really want is power.
With power comes all too easily the abuse of power, unless it is
hedged round with safeguards, with checks and balances. Every democratic
constitution ever written has been designed to provide them. We have no
written constitution, and here we see a penalty of that. If the abused
folk of Airdrie had been Americans, they would long ago have gone to
law.
But soon we may in effect be writing a constitution for Scotland. My
own preference would be to entrust it to Michael Forsyth, on the lines
of his address to this year's Scottish Conservative conference. Then the
problem of abuse would be removed by removing powers from the people who
may abuse them, by stripping central and local government of its
functions. But I suspect Forsyth would turn down the job.
Short of that, we can at least try to ensure that old evils are not
carried forward into a new system. Under the devolution proposed by
Labour, with the gullible support of the Liberal Democrats, the
functions of Scottish government and the means of financing them are to
be preserved. This means the system of exchanging patronage from above
for servility from below is to be preserved too.
In that case, the idea that we would be democratising anything
worthwhile is spurious. Besides, the curious manoeuvrings of George
Robertson, to limit the size of the Scottish parliament and the
proportionality of its representation, leave little room for doubt that
he will fix a permanent majority for Labour if he can. Scotland, in
other words, is to be converted into greater Monklands.

WHILE big supermarkets battle for the weekly shopping basket, Watson &amp;
Philip is mining gold from small convenience stores where people pop in
daily to buy a newspaper, a Lottery ticket, or a pint of milk.
The Dundee-based food services and retail group added 76 new corner
shops to its Allday chain in the first eight months of the current
financial year.
Allday owns or franchises a total of 421 shops throughout the UK and
Watson &amp; Philip chief executive David Bremner said he expected the chain
to expand at a rate 100 shops per year ''for quite a time yet.''
Group pre-tax profits rose 25% to #6.3m in the six months to April 30,
outpacing turnover, which rose 5% to #229m.
The Allday corner shops accounted for half of group sales, the
remainder coming from Watson and Philips' catering supply business and
its chain of Trademarket cash-and-carry warehouses.
Same-store turnover in the Allday chain remained flat during the half
year, but operating margins rose to 3.7% from 2.8% after the
introduction of a new product mix and a rapid growth in Lottery sales.
Mr Bremner said Allday shops had reduced the amount of space devoted
to packaged foods that large supermarkets could sell more cheaply.
''We sell a lot more newspapers and magazines, a lot more fresh foods
and a lot more chilled foods than we did a year ago and the Lottery is
bringing more people into our stores,'' he said.
The chief executive forecast that lottery sales alone would contribute
#1m to profits during the full year.
The acquisition of 18 Presto and Galbraith stores from the Argyll
group last month helped fill a gap in Allday's presence in of Central
Scotland and Mr Bremner said the chain would expand further in this
area.
Watson &amp; Philip aims to spend more than #20m on acquisitions during
the present financial year on both the retail and food service side, but
so far it had only spent half this budget, he said.
The food service division, which supplies hotels and large caterers,
was boosted by the acquisition of Alexander Clark and Son, a Scottish
competitor, in late April and the opening of a new depot in Motherwell
earlier this week.
Operating profits from the division almost doubled during the half
year.
But Watson &amp; Philip's chain of eight Trademarket cash-and-carry stores
turned in a lacklustre performance.
These suffered a 2%-3% decline in like-for-like sales during the half
year to April 30, but Mr Bremner said this loss had been fully recovered
by an upturn since then.
Watson &amp; Phillip felt confident enough to raise the interim dividend
to 5.0p from 4.7p and looking ahead, Mr Bremner forecast that the
present upswing would continue well into next year.
''We are pretty positive about the second half. We have had an
excellent start and the momentum will continue into 1996,'' the chief
executive said.
Investors shared his optimism and Watson &amp; Philip shares closed up 10p
to 435p after reaching 448p earlier in the day.

THERE are only three sexy professions; journalist, lawyer, or police
person. If you want to impress the opposite sex take up the pen, the
law, or the truncheon: nothing less will suffice. Hang on you conceited
hack, I hear you heckle, what a self-aggrandising statement. Let me
assure you that it is simply fact totally unprompted by any personal
bias.
Admittedly, there are other vocations which might strike one as more
glamorous -- for instance, model, pop star, actor, or shark hunter but
such jobs are merely superficially sexy. The superwaif on the catwalk or
the pouting musician on the stage might hold the nation in thrall awhile
but their callings are built on empty values, lacking the necessary
blood-stirring noble dimension.
However, journalists, lawyers, and policemen deal with the grand
passions of life on a daily level, constantly coping with dramatic
conflicts and locked into public and private debates on the very nature
of good and evil. Don't just take my word for it. We know this because
television and film says so and if television and film says so then so
it is. On screen journalists, lawyers, and policemen expose Government
corruption, save innocent lives from imminent electric chairs, and bust
major Mafia rings. This is thrilling stuff. Damn sexy.
So busy are they meting out justice and ensuring the world is a finer,
fairer place for all, that they have to make personal sacrifices.
Journalists have such a hectic life tracking scoops that they don't even
have time to iron their clothes and are invariably rumpled and unshaven,
obviously in a sexy kind of way. Apart from the women (she hastens to
add) who usually have power suits and power bobs which end in sculpted
points you could cut diamonds with, a la Lois Lane.
Lawyers give up sleep and their eyesight. On the eve of the the
summation in an important trial they will have eleventh-hour inspiration
and stay up all night poring over library books by weak light, slugging
coffee, and slumping over imposing tomes, obviously in a sexy kind of
way. This will result in a jubilant pronouncement in court, quoting some
obscure precedent and subsequently saving the day and the neck of the
defendent.
The police sacrifice family life and cutlery. They are more married to
the job than their put-upon wives who are occasionally glimpsed wearing
martyr-like expressions and special-occasion lingerie (always ignored).
A really devoted policeman is contractually obliged to miss Junior's
birthday party, his father-in-law's funeral, daughter's wedding, and
wife's attempts at seduction. Eventually she and her special
occasion-lingerie will disappear with the nine-to-five accountant next
door at which point the cop will be promoted and become an alcoholic,
obviously in a sexy kind of way.
When policewomen get pregnant they carry on busting down doors till
full term then pause to drop the sprog in the middle of a blood-soaked
major drugs raid.
Cynics among you might reckon that the average demands made on of most
journalists, lawyers, and policemen are the distinctly unsexy tasks of
penning obituaries, settling small-claims disputes, and directing
traffic and while this might contain a kernel of truth it is inspired by
jealousy. It is also irrelevant as the public derives their perception
of these professions from the filmic portrayals.
Thus when I announce my trade at parties my desirability instantly
increases and people quiz me about my working life, eg, it must be
fascinating, do you meet many famous people? do you get to travel on
special assignments? This allows me to demonstrate the professional
tools of flair for language and imaginative interpretation of the truth.
Haven't you noticed, dear reader, that when you announce that you are
a market analyst, computer operator, or interior decorator that you are
met with thin smiles and wandering eyes? Better to burn in hell than
admit to being a chartered surveyor. Better by far simply to lie and
pretend to be a journalist, lawyer, or policeman. God will certainly
forgive you this understandable transgression -- though perhaps it's
best not to take my word on matters divine.
It's basically a power thing. Journalists have a forum and thus the
breathtaking potential to bring down the Government, with the added
perks of lots of freebies, good party anecdotes, and the glamour of
association with famous people.
Lawyers have a forum in court, allowing them an opportunity to
demonstrate what an A-grade smartass they are. And after a suitably
pious period spent in Legal Aid they have the added perk of a megabucks
salary. This is very sexy.
Police have unbelievable power, including the power to frame their
enemies. They also have guns. And uniforms. And handcuffs. This is very
sexy.
The firearms dimension is essential to sexiness here. We're talking
cops not plods here. Juliet Bravo is not sexy. The Bill is not sexy. The
Streets of San Francisco, Hill Street Blues, and NYPD Blue are sexy.
British police series trying to be sexy have to compensate for lack of
firearms with more bad chases and bad language, like The Sweeney or at
least have Neil Pearson in them, like Between The Lines.
There are pretenders to this sexy pantheon but frankly they don't cut
the Colemans. Our screens might be crammed with series and films about
the medical profession but doctors are not sexy, no matter how warm
their bedside manner, as they spend too much time up to their elbows in
bodily waste. This is not sexy. Such programmes must be aimed at
death-obsessed older audiences who are so feeble and desperate they
actually fancy Dr Finlay.
There is inevitably fierce competition between journalists, lawyers,
and police as to who is sexiest of all. This can be demonstrated by the
fact that any film lauding one profession will invariably denigrate the
others. Thus we have incisive journos exposing corruption upheld by bad
cops and useless lawyers, eg, The Paper or brilliant briefs showing up
stupid cops eg, My Cousin Vinny or good cops frustrated by corrupt
lawyers and sleazy journos eg, every cop movie.
But the answer is obvious. Clark Kent did not trot off to law school,
Peter Parker did not tread the beat. Nope, both Superman and Spiderman
chose journalism for their day job. Turn green but face facts; my work
is not only sexy it is clearly a job for the superhuman.

THE mad bombers, leaders of the Militia movement, came to Washington
last week, to testify to a Senate committee. They offered a
disconcerting glimpse of the rage and paranoia that lurks around the
fringes of American society and that led to the Oklahoma City bombing.
They deny it, of course. They said that the federal government had set
the bombs itself, or had possibly subcontracted to the Japanese
government to set the bombs. Note the plural: they insisted that the
damage could not have been caused by a single fertiliser bomb, but was
the work of two or three explosions set inside the building. As for
Japan, that was returning a favour: the American government carried out
the nerve-gas attack on the Tokyo subway, apparently at Japan's request.
Why kill all those people? Easy: the feds want to justify a new attack
on the citizens' militias.
There is more, much more. One of the witnesses, Robert Fletcher, the
official spokesman of the Montana militia, explained, ''We know who John
Doe number 2 is. He is a person of foreign ancestry,'' he said. ''The
FBI knows and won't reveal it.'' In fact, Mr Fletcher was behind the
curve. The FBI has admitted that John Doe number 2 is a soldier who
happened to visit the Ryder truck rental agency a day before Timothy
McVeigh was there, and has nothing to do with the case.
But he was a soldier, and no doubt Mr Fletcher will now amend his
fantasy to include him in the conspiracy. The commander of the Montana
militia, a bearded fanatic called John Trochmann, denounced the
corruption of government and the press, which he called ''the twisted,
biased, slanted media, putting out rumors and a gossip mill of
disinformation''.
The Michigan Militia included James Nichols among its some-time
members (he is the chief suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing not yet
indicted). Norman Olson, the commander of a militia in Michigan, said
that he understood the motives of whoever carried out the bombing, which
he said was an act of retribution.
He brought in the CIA: ''It is the grandest conspirator behind all
this government,'' he said. ''Perhaps its puppeteer strings even reach
into the Senate.''
Mr Fletcher assured the committee that hundreds of railroad flat cars
loaded with Russian and UN military equipment are being distributed
around the country.
The feds are supplying local police with heavy equipment which are
part of the plan to enforce a dictatorship, and: ''There are
weather-control techniques being used by the government so that the New
World Order will be able to starve millions of Americans, and others
world wide.''
One of the Senators asked him about this, and he pointed out that 85
tornadoes occurred simultaneously in one of America's agricultural
areas, and this was obviously the work of the government.
The scariest thing about the hearings was the anger of the witnesses.
They almost spat their contempt of the Senators who questioned them and
insisted that the federal government and, in particular, its law
enforcement and tax agencies, were all illegitimate. They violate the
Constitution and the English Common Law that underpins it.
The Militias are boiling with hatred. Some of them are explicitly
racist and anti-Semitic, but their rage extends itself far beyond blacks
and Jews -- as the children in the day-care centre in Oklahoma City
discovered.
Nor is it an exclusively far-right phenomenon. For years past, at
least since the 60s, the United States has been awash with far-left
paranoia and hatred. Hollywood has been putting out movies for decades
based on the supposition that there is a secret and all-powerful
government concealed from the citizens.
In North by North-West, it was benign, protecting us from the
communists. In The China Syndrome it was altogether malevolent,
protecting corrupt nuclear industries, and there have been any number of
other movies since with the same theme (Oliver Stone has made a
brilliant career out of making them).
As far as we can tell, the Oklahoma City bombing was the work of two
or three crazies, brought to a frenzy of hatred by the Waco disaster,
and other government actions and enactments. But they did not dream it
all up by themselves. They had been drinking at the polluted fountain
fed by Trochmann, Olson, and the others. As one of them told the
Senators, ''If a war is waged, (by the government), these groups plan on
winning.'' Another said ''This nation is one of the most heavily armed
force on Earth. We're the ones who calm things down.''

SPEAKING personally, we can't see why there should be all this fuss
just because some foreign chappie named Christo has wrapped up the
entire Reichstag. What's the big deal? Monklands District Council was
under wraps for years and no-one said a word about it. Indeed, we
understand that ''Wrap up'' was a jocular greeting often exchanged by
comrades within the Labour administration.
Manning dispute
NICE to see that Bernard Manning, a saintly man, has lost none of the
sensitivity that made him the loveable humanitarian he is today.
Yesterday in Manchester, for example, the fat buffoon survived an
attempt to prevent the renewal of the entertainments licence for his
Embassy Club.
Shopkeeper Hitesh Bhatt had objected on the grounds that Mr Manning
may have told the odd racist joke or thousand. Magnanimous in victory,
and demonstrating a clear grasp of the issues, the comic told Mr Bhatt:
''If you come to my club there will be no colour bar. The pianist is
Jewish.''
Out of puff
OH DEAR, how very sad. This, from the lonely hearts column of Another
Newspaper: ''Trainspotter seeks female timetable reader with view to
producing little engines . . . S. Yorks.''
No steam enthusiast he, the lad also insists on a ''non-smoker''.
Law to themselves
WHAT is it with lawyers? (No, please, that's what's known as a
rhetorical question.) Why all the jokes, and why is it that we always
hear such drolleries being related by lawyers themselves? Is it some
elevated form of guilt, or just a desperate attempt to prove they can
see the funny side even when they're not compiling your bill?
Exhibit A: What's black and brown and looks good on a lawyer? An
Alsatian.
Exhibit B: What do lawyers and sperm have in common? They're both
squirmy, both live in slime, and only one in 250 million accomplishes
anything.
Exhibit C: What do you get when you cross a librarian with a lawyer?
All the information you'll ever need -- but you can't understand a word
of it.
Exhibit D: If a lawyer and a tax inspector were both drowning, and you
could only save one, would you go to lunch or read the newspaper?
Exhibit E: Why do male advocates wear those tight collars and ties? It
keeps their foreskins from covering their faces.
Sitting pretty
TASTEFUL as the Diary always is, we are genuinely unsure about this
one. It may count as a comment on motorway service stations, or perhaps
on the possibility of lengthy traffic jams this summer. Nevertheless, it
falls to us to report that the ''Emergency 'Convenient' Portable CAR
LOO'' is now available by mail order for only #15.
According to the advertisement ''Every Car Should Have One'' for,
thankfully, this ''neat Polythene product'' is ''unspillable, odourless,
reusable''. Disturbingly, however, it offers ''separate male and female
receptacles, interchangeable and connected to a two-litre . . .''
No, that's enough. Has it, for the Wednesday Diary, come to this? Very
probably.
Shrinking violets
AN Edinburgh charity worker of our acquaintance was due to conduct a
horticultural therapy session for a women's group one recent sunny
afternoon. Bemused when no-one turned up, he made a few inquiries.
''Ah,'' came the response, ''that'll be the agoraphobics again''.
Out of sight
IT'S true, then. Or as the UPI news agency has just reported: ''In at
least partial confirmation of myths that sexual activity can lead to
blindness, a University of Pittsburgh ophthalmologist reported Monday
six rare cases of injuries to the eyes that resulted from vigorous
sexual activity''.
With the marvellous restraint that only Americans can summon, the
report continued: ''A 53-year-old man suffered a sudden, dramatic
decrease in vision in his right eye during particularly vigorous
autoerotic activity. He had a massive haemorrhage in his eye that forced
him off the job . . .''
Speaking for the university, Dr Thomas Friberg added, sagely: ''We
believe that loss of vision occurring during sexual activity must be a
rare event, considering the paucity of such cases in light of the
frequency of sexual encounters''.
Bone to pick
AUSTRALIANS outraged by France's decision to renew nuclear testing in
the Pacific now have the chance to convey their feelings directly to
President Jacques Chirac by e-mail. As of yesterday, 1253 had taken up
an offer by AUSNet, an Australian Internet access provider, to do just
that.
Given the nature of what the French are proposing for Mururoa Atoll,
it therefore seems entirely appropriate that the usual Internet term for
abusive correspondence is ''flaming''.
Still, let no-one run away with the idea that everything is hi-tech
down under. In Darwin, for example, two men were committed for trial
yesterday accused of threatening an entertainer with an Aboriginal
curse.
A magistrate heard the pair had said they would ''point the bone'' at
the entertainer if he did not hand over $10,000. The intended victim's
name (it says here) was one Kevin ''Bloody'' Wilson. As opposed, no
doubt, to Bernard ''Bloody'' Manning.
Jonah and wails
SIMON Kelner, sports editor, the Independent on Sunday: ''It is
tempting to view this afternoon's semi-final of the Rugby World Cup in
simplistic terms: England v New Zealand, white and black, good and
evil''. Evil? Come, come Simon old bean: England weren't that bad.
It does occur to us, though, that some of the comments on the splendid
Jonah Lomu have had about them just the merest whiff of racism.
Bring him down ''with an elephant gun'' said some; a ''freak'' said
the ever-sporting Will Carling. Yet had Jonah been born within hailing
distance of Droitwich he would, without doubt, instantly have become one
of those honorary white men with which South Africans and old farts
everywhere were once so familiar.
Speaking, however, for those exceeding 6ft 5in who will never see 18
stone again (it's just age, fitness, speed, cigarettes, alcohol, and
skill that holds us back), we say ''lumbering'' Lomu (if only Scotland
had lumbered so) struck a blow for the averagely proportioned. Against
England Jonah had a whale of a time, as did, vicariously, we. Racist,
us?
Last orders
DEPARTMENT of Don't Ask Me: Traders at the Shanghai Stock Exchange
have been ordered to stop drinking and smoking on the trading floor.
They have also been told to stop gambling, eating snacks, opening canned
drinks, sleeping, shouting, ''joking around'', and -- your guess is as
good as, etc, -- knitting.
To wit: new rules announced by the exchange this week say traders
caught knitting sweaters will receive a formal warning. Purl, we cannot
help but ask, of the Orient?

Moscow, Tuesday
RUSSIAN far-right leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky fought his way back into
the headlines today, scuffling with a top talk show host and throwing
orange juice into the face of a fellow guest during a live broadcast.
Nizhny Novgorod regional governor Boris Nemtsov, whom Zhirinovsky had
called ''scumbag'' and ''bastard'', replied in kind by emptying his
fruit juice over Zhirinovsky.
The two men have a history of antagonism. Nemtsov, much admired by the
Western economists Zhirinovsky despises, once accused Zhirinovsky of
breaking into his office with a group of aides.
Nemtsov produced a copy of Playboy magazine and suggested Zhirinovsky
had contracted syphilis through sleeping with some of the 200 conquests
of which he had boasted in an interview with the magazine.
''We know your problem,'' Nemtsov said with a smile, pointing to the
magazine.
''You've just made that up,'' erupted Zhirinovsky, who has variously
made the news for hurling plant pots at French students, threatening to
flood the Baltics with nuclear waste, and advocating Russia's need to
expand to the Indian Ocean.
''We can cure you. We have two simple injections,'' Nemtsov said.
Zhirinovsky rose to his feet with cries of ''bastard'' and
''scumbag''. Talk show host Alexander Lyubimov tried in vain to restore
calm.
''You are a bastard. I spit in your face,'' shouted Zhirinovsky,
picking up a glass of orange juice and throwing the contents in
Nemtsov's face.
Nemtsov replied with his fruit juice and the two men stood dripping in
the studio before Zhirinovsky threw his empty glass at his adversary.
''Sit down, sit down both of you,'' pleaded Lyubimov.
''How can I when that bastard is saying such things?'' replied
Zhirinovsky, grabbing another empty glass and hurling it at Nemtsov.
The screen suddenly faded to black, but Pravda reported that the two
men had continued their duel by hurling make-up kits at each other.
Nemtsov told a news agency that Lyubimov had then punched Zhirinovsky
in the face. The journalist declined to comment today but said: ''All I
can say is that we had a man-to-man talk'' -- Russian shorthand for a
scuffle.--Reuter.

Ross Finlay sits back and enjoys an unhurried ride
WHEN I mentioned to some colleagues that I would be taking a
base-model Volkswagen Golf diesel estate to Berkshire and back, there
was a certain amount of lip-pursing from the ones who had driven the car
before. This is by no means the fast car of the Golf range, and motoring
writers do prefer to have something with more get-up-and-go for 900-mile
journeys of that kind.
But, especially where working estate cars are concerned, there is a
lot to be said for the no-frills version. If it will cruise comfortably
at motorway speeds, take a good amount of cargo -- whether conventional
luggage, samples, spare parts or whatever -- and combine that with low
fuel returns, then a working estate does the job it was bought to do.
There is generally little need for much else.
At #11,395 the L-specification diesel is the lowest priced car in the
quite extensive Golf estate range. This is not simply a body conversion
on the hatchback, although the load area is longer and its floor
dimensions, with the rear seat upright, are very competitive in the
class. Volkswagen fits the estate with different rear suspension struts
which reduce the space needed for them in the wheel arches.
VW in the UK thinks in mixed metric and imperial terms. Loads one
metre wide can be fitted between the wheel arches, while the 16.5 cubic
feet of load volume with the rear seats in place increases to as much as
50.3 when they are folded flat. Even on this base model, the seat backs
have a 60/40 split, while a concertina-style security blind stretches
from the rear seat to the back door. Double-locking doors are standard,
and other anti-theft measures include a removable radio front.
Releasing some extra space, thanks to the revised suspension struts,
means that the Golf estate will take a bigger fuel tank than the
hatchback. It holds 13.2 gallons, which gives the diesel a substantial
range. I refuelled at an indicated 530 miles of mostly motorway driving,
and could happily have gone on a little farther. In fact, had I realised
in advance what inflated prices are charged at one of the M40 service
areas, I certainly would have. Volkswagen reckons that the unblown
1.9-litre estate should return about 61mpg at 56mph, 44 at 75 and 41mpg
on the urban cycle.
Carrying quite a heavy body, the diesel engine's peak output of 64bhp
cannot be expected to provide anything in the way of vivid performance.
The statistics are not very cheery: a 0-60mph time of 18 seconds, quite
fair mid-range pull, and a test-track maximum round about 95mph.
However, once the Golf estate has got up to its cruising speed, it
will hold its place easily in a line of quite smartly-moving motorway
traffic, and settles down nicely. I had wondered if, on longish climbs
like Shap, it would tend to peter out as it struggled with the gradient
in fifth gear, but there was no problem there. Relaxed, economical
cruising is one of the car's strongest suits. Noise levels at 70mph or
so are perfectly reasonable.
Simple practicality is the keynote of the interior presentation. The L
model has no truck with details like electrically operated windows or
door mirrors, the trim materials are hard wearing, but there is space
for a couple of picnic cups in the let-down lid of the glove box, which
coyly reveals one extra feature -- clips for a ball-point pen. I am
sorry to say that the driver's door mirror is one of those awful
twin-lens efforts.
Rear passenger space is unexpectedly good, in both headroom and
legroom. Like all Volkswagens, this one has a well-engineered feel, even
in details like the switchgear. The familiar Golf fascia is very darkly
trimmed, but the layout is fine, with sensibly recessed instrument
dials. Overall, this is the kind of car which attracts virtually no
headlines, but it is an honest workhorse all the same.

The MGF will make an appearance at the Royal Highland Show, Ingleston,
in the first stop of a Scottish exhibition tour.
ONE of the most eagerly awaited new cars of 1995, which should lead to
a great revival of interest in a currently neglected make, is the MGF.
It goes on sale in the autumn, and will not be seen in the showrooms
much before then, but a display example is about to start a Scottish
exhibition tour.
The MGF is the first mid-engined production car the company has ever
built, which came as a shock to traditionalists who had been picturing
something in the retro style. It uses Rover's highly regarded K-series
engine in its biggest-so-far 1.8-litre capacity, and the top-rated VVC
model employs the latest variable valve technology to push the power
output to 145bhp. It should be a flier.
The car will be on display at the Royal Highland Show, which starts
tomorrow at Ingliston. On Sunday it will move to the well-supported
gathering of MG enthusiasts from all over Scotland, the MG Ecosse 95
event at Doune Motor Museum. And on Monday and Tuesday of next week it
will be on show at Parklands Country Club, Newton Mearns, home ground of
many sporting MG drivers of a generation or two ago.
MG Ecosse 95 starts on Saturday with a mildly competitive road run
around the Trossachs, Loch Lomondside, and the Campsies. Sunday is the
public day at the motor museum, where there will be a display of cars
owned by members of the three principal MG enthusiasts' clubs in
Scotland, from a J2 of the early 1930s to the RV8, and a gymkhana where
many of these cars will be put through their manoeuvring paces.
That was the great thing about MGs of earlier years, they could be
used as ordinary transport during the week and wheeched around in
competition at the weekend. A remarkable number of now apparently solid
and respectable business types have a background of rallying, racing,
and generally getting muddy, rain-soaked or oily, persuading their
long-lost MG two-seaters round the pylons of manoeuvring tests or up
impossibly steep and rocky trials hills.
There are many books on individual aspects of MG history, and a new
one called MG Trials Cars, by Roger F Thomas, has just been published at
#14.95, by Magna Press, which shares its own name with an MG model of
the 1930s. This is a well-illustrated account of the works-team trials
cars -- the Cream Crackers and the Musketeers -- and the drivers who
swept them to so many awards. It opens up contemporary correspondence
between the drivers and the factory about modifications and failings
which were kept quiet at the time.
Enthusiasts who like to locate old competition sites will find plenty
of interest in the book, and it is good to see that the MG Highlanders
-- the Scottish team who could take on the works drivers on an almost
equal basis, thanks to the expertise of Keith Elliot, George Murray
Frame and Norman Gibson -- are also given their place.

THE hostage crisis has prompted the influential Communist faction in
the Russian Parliament to start a campaign aimed at impeaching President
Boris Yeltsin.
Viktor Ilyukhin, deputy head of the faction, said the Communists in
the State Duma (lower house) had started collecting signatures needed to
launch long, complicated impeachment proceedings.
''Budennovsk has become the last straw,'' said Ilyukhin.
The Communists, who traditionally oppose Yeltsin, have to rally the
support of at least 150 MPs to put the issue on the chamber's agenda.
A vote of no confidence in the government was scheduled for tomorrow
but observers doubted it would take place.

THE MBA or Master of Business Administration degree is the fastest
growing post-graduate qualification in Britain today. Ten years ago
there were 25 MBA courses to choose from throughout the country -- now
there are more than 90.
The number of continental business schools has also increased
dramatically. There are more than 300 available in Europe at the present
time. In the USA almost 300,000 students are currently enrolled for the
MBA qualification and in 1992 nearly 85,000 became graduates.
In the 1970s the possession of an MBA was the automatic qualification
for a good job. Today it is not so simple. Employers are more and more
interested in where the MBA has been obtained rather than the mere fact
of possession. You are where you study is the new name of the game.
The intended MBA student should choose a course which has the AMBA's
-- Association of Master of Business Administration degrees -- stamp of
approval. The institution chosen should have been visited by academic
experts in the field who have been satisfied that the teachers on the
MBA programme and the course content itself are of a high standard of
excellence.
Three years ago in 1992, Britain's higher education funding councils
carried out a survey to assess the quality of teaching and research in
the country's many business schools. The top grade of ''excellent'' was
only achieved by six. In Scotland the only one on the list was
Strathclyde. The 1995/96 Association of MBAs guide to business schools
handbook lists 10 different institutions offering MBA programmes north
of the Border ranged geographically from Aberdeen to Glasgow.
Intending MBA students whether full-time, part-time or distance
learning should take into consideration the length of time
establishments have been offering MBA courses because some have only
been including them on their prospectuses in recent years although they
have been available in Britain since the 1960s. As tuition fees range
from #4000 to around #20,000 the student should strive to get value for
money.
The Association of MBAs (AMBA) was founded in 1967 by a group of
British graduates who had returned from studying at some of the leading
American business schools. They believed in the need for an active
pressure group to promote the idea of management education in the UK.
Before 1965 no management schools awarded the MBA and the influence of
AMBA members played an important role in the expansion of business
education since then. The quality issue was brought sharply into focus.
Currently 32 out of the 100 or so institutions conferring the MBA in the
UK -- now including four distance learning programmes -- are accredited
by the AMBA.
Its criteria are rigorous and offer a kind of consumer protection for
intending students. Some of the principal features are:
The school should have its own identity and physical facilities within
the institution of which it is part.
It should have had at least two graduating classes since its
foundation.
The faculty should have around 40 staff as that is the minimum the
AMBA believes is the minimum required to provide adequate contact with
students during the course.
The staff should be credible in terms of their academical
qualifications, their ability to teach business at post-graduate level,
the quality of their research and the extent of their business contacts
and consultancy activities.
The admission standards for students must be high and based on work
experience as well as academic criteria.
The study body must be large and varied enough to form an
intellectually critical mass.
The curriculum must cover core business skills: marketing, the
economic and legal environment of a business, accounting and
quantitative methods, organisational theory and inter-personal skills,
the processes and practice of management.
The examination results must be the principal though not the sole
measure of attainment.
In addition AMBA accreditation is based on such factors as the
availability of language teaching, library and computer facilities,
international contacts and the content and quality of assessment of the
project/thesis/dissertation which towards the end of the course
integrates what has been learned and relates it to a real situation.
Also considered is the extent to which student reactions are taken into
account in the continuing process of course design and improvement.
The choice between taking a full-time, part-time or distance learning
course may depend on whether the student can afford to take a year off
work.

The Glasgow Cycling Campaign's claim tht the pushbike is the fastest
means of commuting cannot go unchallenged (June 13). The experiment in
which different modes of transport were used to travel to George Square
from Newton had a fatal flaw which invalidates the result. The cyclists
in their enthusiasm forgot about other kinds of two wheelers.
My own experience as a daily commuter within Glasgow demonstrates that
the fastest commuting method by far is to ride a motorbike. This is
because it combines the traffic-cheating qualities of pedal bike with
the speed afforded by the internal combustion engine.
I've tried all the travel options on my regular run from the South
Side to the West End. The journey by motorbike takes about two-thirds of
the time taken by car or pushbike, which in turn are much faster than
public transport.
On a relatively short urban trip I reckon I save about 80 hours a year
(at least two working weeks) by choosing a motorbike over a car or
bicycle. For people with further to travel the gain would be much more.
By all means readers should ride a pushbike if they want to keep fit
and cut costs, but not if the aim is to waste as little of life as
possible in commuting. Instead they should get a motorbike.
If the Glasgow Cycling Campaign wants to repeat its commuter contest,
I'm ready with my crash helmet.

IN a survey conducted to mark the 25th anniversary of the Association
of MBAs it was found that around 80% of both full and part-time students
had a first degree and around 50% had achieved a first or upper second.
They were significant differences in the ages marital status and work
experience.
Among full timers the average age was 25 to 29, 23% of students were
women, 44% were married and 27% had ten or more years work experience.
Among part timers the average age was 35 to 39 with almost 28% over 40,
18% were women, 75% were married and 47% had ten or more years work
experience.
The growth of part-time MBAs in Britain means that managers in
employment can choose an evening course at a business school close to
their workplace. There is also the possibility of distance learning with
more and more courses coming on stream. A job transfer need not
necessarily interrupt MBA studies as the transition from a part-time
course to distance learning is possible. The Open University Business
School MBA, for example, is now the largest of its kind in the UK.
No matter where or how the MBA is taken, a recent report indicates
that most students pay for the qualification themselves. This is true
certainly where full-time courses are concerned. It has been estimated
that 45% of those who financed their own MBA did so from savings, 25%
from private or bank loans and the remainder by other means. Part-time
students faired better with around 50% on the Open Business School MBA
programme sponsored or supported by their employers.
For the majority of students, bank loans through the Association of
MBAs Business School Loan Scheme would be the most cost effective method
of funding. A Department of Employment-backed career development loan is
another possibility.
How employers view the MBA is an important factor since most students
take the course to advance their careers either within their own
organisation or by changing jobs. It has to be said that except in
sectors like consultancy and financial services, reactions to the MBA
are mixed. Attitudes are changing, however, as a younger generation of
managers climbs to the top and as the value of a global perspective in
business issues -- now a regular feature of the MBA programme -- becomes
more evident.
What do employers expect to gain by hiring MBA graduates and what
qualities should an MBA expect to come away with having taken part in
the intensive and expensive programme? According to the AMBA the current
answers are a breadth of business understanding of management principles
across the key concerns of organisations; specific pools for analysing
strategic issues and options; the ability to identify priorities in
courses of action and, most importantly, presentation and communication
skills.
Many employers feel the MBA course adds value to in-company training
and incorporate it in their internal schemes.

Brian Moore has no regrets about Twickenham affair
THE familiar pit-bull face is battered into an almost permanent scowl
after nine years on rugby's wild side. The right eye is bruised and half
shut, a legacy of last Sunday's mauling by the All Blacks.
As he sits stripped to the waist in England's hotel base in Pretoria,
Brian Moore constantly flexes the muscles around his pork-barrel
shoulders and his bulging biceps.
The man that Scots just love to hate has agreed to talk about his
rugby life and, eventually, about his role as Caledonian public enemy
number one. Colin Herridge, the England team's media liaison man, was
the go-between. ''Brian will talk to you, but only if you don't wave any
of those St Andrew's cross thingies in front of his face. He doesn't
want to dredge up all that Twickenham stuff again.''
OK, Brian, no St Andrew's cross thingies. But tell me about that
Twickenham stuff. Do you now regret having made those disparaging
comments about Scotland after the Grand Slam decider?
You were responsible for an outbreak of national apoplexy when you
said on TV that you felt sorry for the Twickenham spectators, because
Scotland had killed the game as a spectacle. You said that Scotland had
done what they had come to do which, frankly, was not very much.
''No, I don't regret it, and it doesn't bother me. I know the Scots
players and I have fought toe to toe with them for the Lions and against
them for England. I know the ones that I respect and I know the ones
that I don't. It is the same with me. They either respect me or they
don't. It is up to them.
''For instance, the opinion of someone like Finlay Calder, who was the
Lions captain when we won in Australia in 1989, is far dearer to me than
people who write me abusive letters.
''I had scores of letters from Scotland after the Twickenham game, but
I still don't regret what I said. One man in particular wrote nine pages
-- and he was still swearing on the ninth page.''
The 33-year-old Moore is a conundrum. He is a commercial litigation
lawyer in London. An intelligent, professional man, softly spoken and
with a lisp, he is -- battle scars aside -- not at all the belligerent,
archly-competitive beast that we see in the rugby paddock. Speak to the
Scottish Lions who played alongside him in Australia and they will, to a
man, tell you that he's just the kind of bloke you would want alongside
you in the trenches.
Moore, who will win his sixty-fourth cap against France in the
third-place play-off tomorrow, says he does not dislike the Scots,
although he does admit to bringing down the rafters when France scored
that injury-time try which scuppered Scotland's World Cup chances.
''Well, we all did, didn't we. I like the French. I've taken to
chatting to them after games and we get on well despite the huge battles
we've had with them on the field,'' he says.
Returning to that Twickenham affair: ''No, I don't regret it. I didn't
make any nationalistic statements. I wasn't abusive. I came off the
field and said that I thought the Scottish team had played one way. They
had come to play one way and they did it.
''Yes, I did say that Scotland had a wider responsibility and that
they had neglected that by killing the game. But they did, and they did
so because that was their best way of winning. If I had been them I
would have done exactly the same thing.
''Look, in 1988 we went up to Murrayfield and killed the game against
Scotland stone dead to win 9-6. We killed it because we had to. We
desperately needed a win. There were a lot of heads on the block and we
just said that no matter what it took we were going to control the game
and we weren't going to lose.
''Murrayfield is a difficult place for the opposition to play and we
took the game by the scruff of the neck. We kept the ball tight and
didn't let anyone play.
''Then Derrick Grant, the Scottish coach, came in and we said thanks
for the game, and he said: 'What f...ing game was that?' He said we had
killed the game stone dead and he was absolutely right. The difference
between what he said then and what I said this season was that he didn't
have heaps of opprobrium dumped upon him.
''I made a game-based comment which was not particularly directed
towards a nation or to an individual. But all of the press comment
afterwards, especially the article from John Beattie, was just personal
abuse. He called me an idiot. I have never talked to John Beattie. He
doesn't know what sort of person I am. For him to call me stupid and an
idiot is just ridiculous.
''But no, it doesn't bother me. The best response is just to say, so
what. That's what Gavin Hastings did. He just said Brian is entitled to
his opinion and I have a different one. That's what I call a balanced
approach.
''A lot of the hysteria which came afterwards was odd in the extreme.
I must have touched something very deep-rooted. Maybe it's so sensitive
because it's near to the truth and that does always incense people.''
The message, then, is clear. Brian Moore regrets nothing. And despite
laying himself open to the charge that, just perhaps, he doth protest
too much, the trained lawyer in his him puts forward an entirely
convincing case for the defence.
Moore was one of the current crop of Englishmen who had their hopes
and their egos broken by David Sole's Grand Slam Scots at Murrayfield in
1990. How did that experience compare to the Rugby World Cup semi-final
defeat by New Zealand on Sunday?
''Well, Sunday's game was hugely disappointing, and in a different way
just as disappointing as 1990 at Murrayfield.
''I suppose the only sense in which it was less disappointing is that
the opening 10 minutes in Cape Town were almost unreal. Before breaking
breath we were so behind on the board to a good team that we weren't
going to get back, and in that sense it was a non-game. It was a very
odd feeling, actually.
''Murrayfield was different in that we were in the game throughout and
even at the end we could still have won with a try.
''I don't think that we were favourites on Sunday, because we haven't
clicked that well in this tournament. Although, as forwards, we didn't
control the game as expected, I thought that the forward battle was
tied, if not even shaded by us.
''I don't want to go on about Jonah Lomu, but a man like him who steps
into the game and takes it by the scruff of the neck can't always be
planned for.
''I'm sure he must be stoppable. But the problem is that if you commit
two or three men to him then Walter Little and Frank Bunce and Glen
Osborne are very good players and pose threats all the way across the
line. I don't know what the answer is.''
Moore, who is playing in his third World Cup and will consider his
international future once the summer is over, reckons the modern game is
played at a faster pace and by physically stronger and fitter players
than when he made his 1987 debut against Scotland.
Like England team manager Jack Rowell, Moore believes England have to
spread their wings and play on a global scale more often. He does not,
though, want to see the Five Nations' Championship diminished.
''Of course, we have to play the Southern Hemisphere sides more
regularly, but the Five Nations is an important tournament in its own
right and a tournament which, whatever the Southern Hemisphere says
about their Super Ten or Super Twelve, or whatever it's currently
called, is the envy of the world.
''It is a very difficult tournament to win. You are playing against
history, against nationality, against variations in the weather,
variations in pitch conditions, and refereeing styles.
''But before this World Cup it was four years since we had played the
Australians and that is too long. It was six years prior to the first
game of the 1991 World Cup before we played the All Blacks -- and that
is too long for any side because, in Super Ten terms, all of these
players are playing against each other three and four times a year and,
as anyone will tell you, if you play against other good players
consistently then you improve yourself.''
Moore is a firm advocate of the professional, or at least,
semi-professional game. He believes professionalism is inevitable.
''Yes, the game will become, at the very least, semi-professional. I
define that as some players full-time, as in rugby league, where it is a
professional structure and some people are fully professional and others
are semi-professional. If you need to work, then you will work, and if
not, then you don't.
''I sympathise with the predicament of any career person -- and I have
been in this situation -- who will be lost to international rugby if the
game goes professional. But I am afraid that these people are going to
get squeezed.''
They will find a way of juggling things, or decide whether to pursue
their careers or their rugby.''
So far as reports of his imminent retiral are concerned Moore says
that, like Mark Twain's reported death, they are premature. ''I'm going
to consider retiral after the summer. Apart from the first 10 minutes of
the New Zealand game on Sunday I've really enjoyed this tournament.
''South Africa are coming to open the new stand at Twickenham next
season and I may fancy that. Neither would I underestimate the enjoyment
I get out of the Five Nations' Championship. There are huge battles and
it's a huge adrenaline rush. I felt the same this year as I did when I
first started. I still get a huge buzz from it.
''The book will be coming out in October. It doesn't have a title yet.
We're still arguing about it. The title, seemingly, is the one thing
that you don't have control over. There shouldn't be a problem, but it
depends what you want to call it!''
This is said with a grin, indicating that both the title and the
contents may not be suitable for those of a nervous disposition. Neither
should he bank upon leisurely retirement from royalties north of the
Border.
I had scores of letters after the Twickenham game. One man in
particular wrote nine pages -- and he was still swearing on the ninth
page.

WITH its much lower negative equity than the South, Scotland has
become a happy hunting ground for English-based builders who want to
poach a share of the market.
Following its launch in the east of Scotland just over a year ago,
Bryant Homes is now making an impact in the West, with an extensive
build programme at Stewartfield in East Kilbride, Paisley, and
Milngavie.
Poacher's Knoll in Bearsden aims to snare upmarket West of Scotland
buyers with the quality of the properties and the advantages of the
location, which borders open countryside off the Stockiemuir Road.
Nick Smith, managing director of Bryant Homes Scotland, says: ''We now
have six developments in Scotland, three of which are in the West and
are proving to be just as successful with housebuyers as those in the
Edinburgh region.
''The Bryant Homes name has quickly become well established -- we are
known across the country for providing distinctive quality homes in a
traditional style, a combination which appeals to the discerning
Scottish housebuyer. I am confident that our rapid expansion will
continue across the Central Belt.''
The three showhomes at the development have each been decorated in
distinctive styles. Many housebuyers worry about what their house will
look like as part of a new development, and Bryant has invested heavily
to overcome any such doubts by setting the three showhomes in a
landscaped setting designed to give potential buyers a perspective on
how their home will look once they move in.
Poacher's Knoll is situated in Craigton, Milngavie. It features a
selection of the company's top four and five-bedroom detached properties
priced from around #150,000 to about #220,000.

CONVENT living may not be your idea of the perfct lifestyle. But take
luxurious apartments, set them in the grounds of what was the first
convent to be built in Scotland since the Reformation - and you'll find
none better, if you'll pardon the pun.
St Margaret's Place in Edinburgh's Merchiston/Greenhill conservation
area, was part of the grounds which surrounded the former St Margaret's
Convent, built in the 1830s and at that time, standing in the midst of
farmland.
Nearby, is the splendid A-listed chapel designed by Gillespie Graham,
an acclaimed architect of the period. The voices and laughter of the
girls who were educated within the convent have long faded away, along
with the dreams of Bishop Gillis, whose plans for the creation of St
Margaret's Cathedral never came to pass, but there is a new life for the
area, with its rich tapestry of ecclesiastical history.
Applecross has completed the first two phases of an exceptional
development of high quality flats with Phase Three now underway. The
flats in Phase One are completely sold out, and Phase Two is currently
being marketed, with a quite splendid show flat on view: occupancy of
the latest properties is due next month. The completion of Phase Three
is expected to be in November.
St Margaret's Place benefits from mature trees, and is sheltered to
the north by lofty stone walls on Thirlestane Road, with Whitehouse Loan
bounding it to the west. In spite of its convenience to the city centre
- under 10 minutes by car - and the local shops, the development is a
peaceful backwater tucked quietly away in landscaped gardens out of the
bustle.
The current phase offers 12 apartments - 10 of which remain available
- ranging in size from two public rooms and two bedrooms, priced from
#147,000 to a penthouse with two public rooms, four bedrooms - three of
which have en suite - a large kitchen and cloakroom, plus a generously
proportioned sun terrace. The penthouse price tag is #304,000. Each flat
has a single garage, and in the case of the penthouse, a double.
Of an architecturally pleasing style sympathetic to the neighbouring
buildings, St Margaret's Place presents to the world exterior finishes
of roughcast or precast stone. The internal specification is of a very
high standard, with ornate cornicing where possible in public rooms, and
hall, some master bedrooms, and cove cornicing in other bedrooms.
Kitchens by Zeyko of Germany have been designed and supplied by Chris
Jones, and include integrated fridge, freezer, electric double oven, gas
hob, cooker hood, dishwasher and home laundry, all by Neff. There's a
video entry system, and most flats have access to a balcony, terrace or
patio.
Convent living was never like this.

HOW did the bungalow get its name? The story goes that a builder was
half-way through building a traditional two-storey house when he ran out
of money. ''Bung a low roof on it and we'll see if somebody will buy
it,'' he told his tradesmen. ''Bung a low roof''?
Bunkum. The bungalow has a much grander derivation. It is an
Anglo-Indian word which has existed since the 17th century, finding its
way into our language during the days of the Empire.
Back in the 1800's, the word was used as in ''a small bungalow or
garden house'' of the sort found in Bengal. In the 1840s, one writer
described bungalows in India as ''built of unbaked bricks and covered
with thatch'', with a central hall and the whole building being ringed
by an open veranda.
The attraction of the bungalow for many people is the fact that all of
the living accommodation is on a single level. The boom of the British
bungalow was back in the 1920s and 1930s, creating new suburbs like
Kings Park in Glasgow, which offered a new lifestyle for up-and-coming
families that wanted to get as far away from the tenements as possible.
But many of the earlier bungalows have not been kept up-to-date and they
now lack modern features like energy-efficient double glazing and
central heating.
Now Scots housebuilder Walker Homes is offering a wide choice of
bungalows on seven sites in central Scotland. Priced from #62,995 to
#106,995 upwards, their specification includes upmarket kitchen unit
designs, central heating, double glazing, and a 10-year NHBC warranty.
Walker Homes bungalows can be visited at: Armadale, Bo'ness, Comrie,
Edinburgh, Falkirk, Kinross, and Livingston.
Meanwhile, Beazer Homes has responded to market interest and released
a bungalow at its Knightswood Gate development in Garscadden, Glasgow.
The Mull is a three-bedroom bungalow with en-suite shower room and
garage priced at #86,495.
Knightswood Gate is a 175-home development which also features two,
three and four-bedroom properties in mid and end-terrace, semi-detached
and detached styles.

FIRST of the all new multi-purpose vehicles to be on sale, rather than
still the subject of pre-launch publicity campaigns, is the Honda
Shuttle. In the familiar and confusing Japanese way, this MPV bears no
resemblance whatever to the Honda which carried the Shuttle name before.
But if it is a true standard bearer for the new generation of MPVs, we
can stop worrying about how well or badly they will drive out on the
open road.
If these new MPVs sell in the quantities which manufacturers even in
their less fanciful moments suggest, we will have to get used to seeing
a lot of them around. The first thing to appreciate is that, despite
their general appearance, they are certainly not vans with windows. From
one point of view, even that would be no bad thing. Aerodynamicists
dislike the conventional car-like bonnet with an abrupt change of angle
at the windscreen. The MPV line, as on the Shuttle, where the two
surfaces merge almost imperceptibly, provides a more stabilising
airflow.
There is not much point in creating a people carrier if it does not
have plenty of cabin space, and the Honda scores well here. Honda has
introduced the Shuttle with just one specification at a showroom price
of #22,995. The air-conditioned interior comes as standard with three
rows of seats, the first two in the ''captain's'' style with armrests on
each side and -- something which not all its rivals feature -- space to
walk through between each pair.
The Shuttle comes as standard with automatic transmission, controlled
by a selector not between the front seats, but on the steering column.
The high-standing long-wheelbase body provides an airy interior, a
commanding driving position and the ability to move the seats.
The Shuttle can accommodate six people, or almost any number less than
that with a bigger pile of luggage. Six-up, though, it offers no better
answer than its rivals to the problems of what to do with half a dozen
lots of luggage. Roof rack rails are a standard fitting.
The front end of the Shuttle platform is similar to that of the
Accord, so that it uses much the same engine and front suspension
arrangements as the saloon. The engine is a 2.2-litre 16-valve affair
whose balancer-shaft system, combined with Honda's traditional expertise
in building smooth and responsive power units, is a major element in
creating car-like standards of refinement.
It peaks at 150bhp, allowing a lightly laden Shuttle to reach 60mph in
about 12 seconds and go on to a test track maximum approaching 115mph.
MPVs are never going to be the choice of owners preoccupied with
economy, but the Shuttle's returns of 35mpg at 56mph, 29 at 75 and 22mpg
on the urban cycle should be competitive in the class.
There are a few things that people new to MPVs will find unfamiliar at
first. The well-designed fascia is a much bulkier unit than you find in
saloons or estates, and passengers in the middle row of seats sit high
enough to feel more of the sway during fast cornering than they would in
ordinary cars. But some features which might have been expected are
lacking. The Shuttle, for instance, provokes remarkably low levels of
road noise. As far as the latest generation of MPVs is concerned, Honda
has a head start, not just in availability but also in refinement.

A NUCLEUS of five owners and potential owners launched Scottish
sailing's newest class of racing boat at Kip Marina last weekend.
The Scottish Melges 24 Association was formed by a core group who see
the American-designed, high speed sportboat as the perfect vehicle to
emulate motorsport and for the first time attract widespread commercial
support to underwrite the purchase and running costs of the #25,000
boats.
Three companies have already signed up to purchase and promote the
lightweight, 24-foot boats with a further two currently under
negotiation.
Until now a combination of the lack of a suitably attractive high
performance craft and a prevailing apathy towards the relaxation of
rules to allow advertising on boats and sails has held back such a
significant development.
The move follows a precedent set by the Melges class racing on
England's south coast and also in America, where the Melges fleets have
snowballed over the past 18 months.
The embryonic five-boat class will make its debut at Tennents West
Highland Yachting week in early August and a Scottish championship is
planned for the Clyde in late September, when 14 boats are expected to
compete.

LINFORD Christie came back to form after a poor week to win the 100
metres at a meeting in windy Madrid last night, edging out Canadian
Donovan Bailey in 10.35sec. for his first international victory of the
season.
Christie, whose mother died on Thursday -- three days after he
announced on TV that he would quit at the end of the season -- had lost
in St Denis and Rome.
His only two successes were in low-key domestic races but last night
he came through well in the last 10 metres to get the verdict and kick
start his world championship season.
Business partner Colin Jackson, the first to congratulate him, also
returned to winning ways in the 110m hurdles.
Jackson, beaten in Nuremberg and Duisburg, recovered from a stumbling
start to outpace Cuban Emilio Valle off the final barrier. However, such
was the strength of the wind against him that a time of 14.07 was his
slowest for years.
Roger Black scored a convincing win in the 400m, clocking 45.07 to
head Olympic bronze medalist Samson Kitur, of Kenya.
In the women's event, Britain's Jackie Agyepong returned a time of
13.35 when just shaded by Olga Shishigina, of Kasakhstan, in the 100m,
while away from the track, Cuban Ivan Pedroso jumped 8.73m in the long
jump.

TIM Henman has Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras in his sights after a
straight-sets victory yesterday in the Nottingham Open.
The 20-year-old Oxford lad, who broke a leg playing in Singapore just
nine months ago, defeated the No.2 seed, Swede Jonas Bjorkman, 7-6, 7-5
in the first round.
Only last week, slimly-built Henman eclipsed the world's 49th-ranked
Martin Sinner of Germany at the Stella Artois tournament.
Yesterday's success came just hours after he learned he will meet
Sampras at Wimbledon in the second round next week -- provided he
removes Kenya's Paul Wekese in his opening test and Sampras does not
slip up against Karsten Braasch of Germany.
''That's something to think about,'' said Henman, ''but I've had an
inkling about it and I've played Sampras before. That was in Tokyo in
September and I came second -- nearly third. It was 6-1, 6-2 actually.''
A much bigger disaster overtook Henman a few weeks later, though, when
he broke his left leg in three places, crash-landing after a failed
attempt at a flying forehand in Singapore.
''It was three months before I could train again and five months
before I could play,'' he said. ''But I'm 100% again now and feeling
good.
Jeremy Bates, who ended his doubles partner Henman's run at Queen's
Club last week, was a picture of frustration as he was beaten 7-5, 7-5
by the No.4 seed, Russian Alexander Volkov.
''I don't feel at all well,'' said Bates afterwards. ''I'm absolutely
exhausted and have just seen the doctor. But I could have won regardless
of how I feel and that's what is most frustrating.''
Henman was left as the lone British survivor of the first round when
Chris Wilkinson went down 7-6, 2-6, 6-3 to Australian Mark Woodforde,
the third seed.
* BRITAIN'S Karen Cross failed to overcome the intimidating obstacle
of Zina Garrison-Jackson in the second round of the Direct Line
Insurance championships at Eastbourne. The 21-year-old from Exeter was
beaten 6-2, 6-3.
The top seeds, Kimiko Date and Natasha Zvereva, both won with ease.
Date overcame compatriot Nana Miyagi 6-2, 6-1, while Zvereva defeated
American Nicole Arendt 6-3, 6-2.
Yayuk Basuki's 6-3, 6-4 victory over Nancy Feber was delayed for an
hour and 40 minutes while a covering was placed over the sponsors huge
red telephone to prevent it reflecting the sun into the eyes of the
players.
* JIM Courier was beaten 6-7, 6-3, 7-6 by fellow-American Richey
Reneburg in the first round of the Halle grass-court tournament in
Germany.
Veteran Jimmy Connors, on his first tour appearance for more than a
year, beat young Canadian hopeful Sebastien Lareau 6-4, 7-6.

DENNIS Bergkamp, the Dutch internationalist, yesterday became Bruce
Rioch's first signing as Arsenal manager when he joined the Gunners from
Inter-Milan for #7.5m.
Rioch, of course, was delighted with purchase, claiming that he has
acquired one of the world's top players, albeit at a reported #25,000 a
week.
''Arsenal have indicated with the acquisition of Dennis Bergkamp our
ambition, our intention, and our determination to compete with any club
for the very best players available, so that we can continue to
challenge for the major honours,'' said the manager.
Barcelona made an eleventh hour bid to top Arsenal's offer, but
Bergkamp said: ''For me Arsenal have always been one of the greatest
teams in the world.
''When I heard from my agent that Arsenal wanted me I never thought
about any other team -- I just wanted to come here. It is been a dream
for me.''
Bergkamp's Arsenal debut will be at Highbury on August 10 against
Inter -- the first of four friendlies between the clubs as part of the
deal which takes the player to London.
While the former Bolton manager was putting the finishing touches on
the Bergkamp deal, Roy McFarland stepped into the Burnden Park hot seat
with Colin Todd confirmed as his assistant.
McFarland, who paid the price for his failure to steer Derby into the
top flight when his contract was not renewed after it ran out a week
before the end of last season, was more than happy with his appointment.
''I'm delighted to be working at Bolton and joining up with Colin,''
said McFarland. ''I hope it will be a bright future for the club -- it
will certainly be an exciting one.''
Meanwhile, transfer dealings in the capital are not expected to stop
with the Bergkamp deal, because Arsenal's north London rivals,
Tottenham, are today expected to announce the #4.5m acquisition of Chris
Armstrong from Crystal Palace.
Armstrong will sign this afternoon following a routine medical check.

* MORE bad news on the international front: the biennial golfing
contest between Scottish sheriffs and English and Welsh circuit judges
at Royal Porthcawl ended 6-4 the wrong way. But the best fairway
performances were from the northern contingent of Noel McPartlin (Elgin)
and Kieran McLernan (Peterhead) which at least bodes well for the next
encounter at Royal Dornoch in 1997.
Straight bat
* AWAY from the golfcourse there has been much grumbling at proposals
to teach judges how to avoid making offensive remarks against
homosexuals. A working party under Mr Justice Potter is looking at
seminars to demonstrate interrogatory techniques without being
derogatory about the sexuality of the person, along the same lines as a
previous racial awareness programme. It smacks of political correctness,
moan the male, white, heterosexual judges on the English circuit bench,
but with backing from their senior colleagues it will go ahead anyway.
Equal before law
* BY 1997, of course, we might have a new Government with different
attitudes to women's roles in the male-dominated law and judiciary. Days
after Lord Mackay's public exhortation to women to apply to become QCs
(there are nearly 400 senior enough in the English Bar to bung in an
application) we witnessed Cherie Blair's arrival as one of the latest
appointments. Together with Roseanna Cunningham's spectacular success
for the SNP at Perth, one might tentatively conclude that equal
opportunity is no longer just an old wives' tale to be left on the shelf
in the old boys' law library.
Plumbing depths
* MEANWHILE at the other end of the scale, we hacks are well used to
dog's abuse from sundry neds who want keep their names out of the paper.
Like the cowboy plumber at Edinburgh Sheriff Court which heard how he
had conned frail pensioners out of thousands of pounds. He made an
unsuccessful plea for anonymity to the reporter, then admonished him for
his occupation: ''It's a helluva way for the likes of you to earn a
living, feeding off other people's misery.'' That's us telt.
Truth or canard?
* A BIZARRE farmyard tale from Robin McEwan QC at the International
Bar Association beano. As sheriff in Lanark, he dealt with applications
for people wanting release from the State Hospital at Carstairs. One of
the few he did grant related to a man kept in various institutions for
around 40 years for an offence with . . . a duck. Presumably, the
sentencing beak thought it went beyond mere ruffling of feathers.
Bastions of the Law (No 75)
* WE all know the smooth working of the courts has nothing to do with
judges or lawyers, but depends entirely on the dedicated band of clerks,
typists, secretaries and other backroom staff.
Which is why the sheriffs of South Strathclyde are now beginning to
tear their hair out. What will they do without Shug?
Regional Sheriff Clerk Hugh Findlay, OBE, has reached 60 and is now
bowing out. Irreplaceable is perhaps an understatement when considering
his unstinting dedication and prodigious appetite for work. A legend in
his own larktime, he would be in at his desk at the crack of dawn:
fellow sheriff clerks throughout the country held a competition to find
the earliest fax they had received from Hugh -- 6.12am won it.
Nor would any white-out hell on the railway from Glasgow to Airdrie
deter him: during one blizzard he hitched a ride on the BR work train
sent to plough its way through the drifts.
Mr Findlay joined the Civil Service in 1952, first at the Admiralty
before becoming a sheriff clerk in 1956, working at Dumbarton, Glasgow,
Stornoway, Airdrie and Lanark. He was a key figure in the Rules Council,
has visited every court in Scotland as a staff inspector and was also a
leading influence in the Cox-Nicholson committee which revised sheriff
court procedure.
In between times, he was back at his desk acting as a walking
encyclopaedia for judges, solicitors, and anyone else who wanted to tap
into his unimpeachable knowledge, plus doing other wee jobs like
organising the Lockerbie FAI.
The unsung hero is not being allowed to leave without a swansong. Five
different retiral bashes in fact, including a dinner last Friday at the
Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow. Court just won't be the same without him.
Plain wrapper
* NEVER judge a book by its cover, nor a magazine by its wrapper.
Presiding at a pornography trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, John
Horsburgh QC, was told that some of the exhibits came in plastic-sealed
packets. Was this like the Journal of the Law Society of Scotland where
any naughty bits are hidden by an opaque wrapper, or the Scots Law Times
which presumably has nothing to hide in a clear cover? A box for a video
also posed a conundrum as to which was the right way up. In the end, the
shrieval judgment was that, given the mountains of flesh and the
complexity of couplings, it didn't really matter. Obviously a case of no
legal bearing.

ROBIN Smith is hoping that actions will speak louder than words at
Lord's this week.
''I've done a lot of talking recently,'' said the Hampshire batsman,
who knows his England career could be ended by another failure against
West Indies.
''The plain fact is that I've got to go out and do it in the middle
now. I don't want to say too much at the moment but if I get a hundred,
I'll be delighted to chat to anyone.''
After his disastrous experience as an opener at Headingley -- where he
scored 16 and 6 -- Smith returns to England's middle order for
tomorrow's second Test.
But chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth has made it plain there is
no room for further error.
''At the moment we feel Robin is the right choice,'' said Illingworth
when he announced England's 13-strong squad. ''But he has got to produce
for us.
''He's played 54 Tests but he always seems a bit nervous. I think he's
now got to stand up and be counted.''
Injured pair Mike Atherton (back) and Peter Martin (thigh) were also
put through their paces.
''I'm hopeful we'll be choosing from all 13,'' said Illingworth. ''But
we'll have to make sure Mike and Peter suffer no reaction from the work
they put in today.''

STEFFI Graf will find her return path to Wimbledon glory blocked by a
familiar name next week. Graf's long-time rival Martina Navratilova
waved an emotional goodbye to the singles last year, but now the German
faces a child prodigy named after the legendary queen of the Centre
Court.
Martina Hingis is already beginning to suggest she has been touched by
Navratilova-like greatness at the tender age of 14. She is the latest
young genius to follow Tracy Austin, Andrea Jaeger and Jennifer Capriati
off the tennis production line at a time when her contemparies pore over
schoolbooks.
The Czech-born Swiss maid has already claimed some big scalps, like
Jana Novotna, Helena Sukova and Anke Huber.
Her mother, Melanie Zogg, introduced Hingis to the game at an age that
meant she was wielding a racket at three and entering tournaments two
years later.
At 12, she eclipsed Capriati as the youngest ever Grand Slam junior
champion by winning the French Open. Last year she added Wimbledon to
her list of junior honours.
Now Hingis will relish meeting the German legend, who has won five
Wimbledon titles in seven years but proved herself human with last
year's first-round exit against American Lori McNeil.
Assuming she beats Hingis, Graf should go all the way to a probable
semi-final meeting with Novotna, whom she beat in the 1993 final after
having been 4-1 down in the final set.
Champion Conchita Martinez, seeded only three, will be pleased to be
in the opposite half to Graf, who beat her in the French championship
just two weeks ago.
Now Martinez will expect to play her compatriot, second seeded Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, who has never passed the quarter-final stage in eight
attempts. She may find it difficult again, for she could clash with Zina
Garrison-Jackson, a grass-court specialist and winner of the DFS Classic
at Birmingham on Sunday, in the third round.
Mary Pierce is expected to make her Wimbledon debut after late
withdrawals in the past two years, but will not be pleased with a
possible second-round clash with French rival Nathalie Tauziat.
As for the men, Pete Sampras, winner for the past two years, seems to
have had an easier draw than top-seeded Andre Agassi.
Sampras is in the same quarter as Sergi Bruguera of Spain, Olympic
champion Marc Rosset, and Guy Forget, the tall Frenchman he beat in the
final of the Stella Artois tournament on Sunday.
Then he should meet Croatian Goran Ivanisevic, the man he beat in the
most boring final on record last year.
Agassi has the prospect of the unpredictable Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev
in the last 16, either former champion Michael Stich or the
up-and-coming South African Wayne Ferreira in the quarter-finals, before
a probable semi-final with three-times champion Boris Becker.
English favourite Jeremy Bates, who has reached the last 16 in two of
the last three years, has the difficult Derrick Rostagno in the first
round. Mark Petchey will meet former world No.1 Mats Wilander, while new
British No.1 Greg Rusedski aims for his first win under the Union Jack
against big-serving American Jim Grabb.
At 95, Tucson-based Grabb is 38 places lower in the rankings than
left-hander Rusedski, who has yet to win a match under British colours.
He withdrew from the French Open through illness and then lost in the
first rounds of the Stella Artois championship and the Nottingham Open.
Michele Mair's bid to join fellow-Scots Ross Matheson and Myles
Maclagan in the main draw for Wimbledon ended in yesterday's opening
round of the qualifying event at Roehampton.
The Scottish No.1, who won through three pre-qualifying rounds at
Surbiton last week, came within a point of defeat at 6-2, 5-0 down
against Russian Tatiana Panova and survived a further five match points
before bowing out by 6-2, 7-6.
Matheson has been dealt a difficult first-round tie against American
David Wheaton, the world No.35, while Maclagan takes on French Open
quarter-finalist Renzo Furlan, of Italy.

HEADED by defending champion Nick Price, next month's Open
Championship at St Andrews has attracted a record entry of 1836, beating
the previous figure of 1827 set in 1993 at Royal St Georges, writes
Matthew Lindsay.
The calibre of field for the world's premier golf tournament prompted
Michael Bonallack, the secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, to
predict: ''This year's Open will be one of the most memorable in the
championship's long and distinguished history.''
Bonallack added: ''The quality in depth is unprecedented with the
presence of 65 of the top 66 in the Sony rankings, but it will also be a
very special Open for many of our former champions.
''It will be the last Open for Arnold Palmer, whose first championship
appearance was in 1960 at St Andrews, and who won the title in 1961 and
1962.''
Included in the list of exempt players are 12 other former champions:
Ian Baker-Finch, Seve Ballesteros, Mark Calcavecchia, Bob Charles, Nick
Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Gary Player, Lee Trevino,
Tom Watson and Tom Weiskopf. Previous winners at St Andrews include
Nicklaus (1970 and 1978), Ballesteros (1984), and Faldo (1990).
The geographical spread of the record entry is illustrated by the
addition of Beau Desert and Romford to the list of regional qualifying
venues on July 10 with final qualifying on July 16 and 17.
Scottish trio
the masters
THE triumvirate of Colin Gillies, Kevin Stables and Lee Vannet won the
Regional Challenge for Scotland yesterday at sun-drenched Gleddoch,
providing an invaluable warm-up for the Sunderland of Scotland Masters,
which starts today.
The trio recorded a three-round aggregate of 208 to deny the West
Region by two strokes. The individual section was won by Murdoch McEwan,
who carded a six-under-par 66. Leading scores:
Individual: 66 -- M McEwan (Frome GC). 68 -- C Gillies (Falkirk), M
Brunton (Sale). 69 -- D Gavrilovic (Oxford GC), R Evans (Dyle and
Kenfig). 70 -- R Walker (Weirside), K Stables (Montrose), L Vannet
(Carnoustie), M Taylor (Shortlands), M Joseph (South Shields). 71 -- R
Weir (Cowal), J Robinson (Ballyearl), A Bownes (Edgbaston).
Teams: 208 -- Scottish Region (C Gillies 68, K Stables 70, L Vannet
70). 210 -- West Region.

Scotland went on the
rampage in their penultimate group match in the European Nations Cup
in Amsterdam yesterday, beating Sweden 9-0 to register their highest
score in international competition since they defeated Denmark by a
similar scoreline in 1975.
The Swedes, who had conceded 20 goals in their three previous games,
rarely made an impact in the contest. Scotland coach Neil Menzies
withdrew his chief striker, Susan MacDonald, seven minutes from time
after she had brought her goal tally to five which brought her
international record to 38 goals from 56 internationals. Rhona Simpson
bagged a hat trick and Diane Renilson scored Scotland's other goals.
The scoring spree will give Scotland's confidence a boost for this
afternoon's contest with Russia as the Scots will be anxious to get the
verdict to enable them to take third place in the group and be
guaranteed a fifth or sixth place finish. This would avoid them having
to prequalify for the 1999 finals at Hurth in Germany.
England booked their place in the semi-finals with a 2-0 victory over
Ireland.
They will meet the winner of tonight's match between Olympic champions
Spain and Holland in the last four on Friday. Scotland team:
Sue Lawrie, Gill Messenger, Carrie Corcoran, Diane Renilson, Susan
Fraser, Helen Walker, Alison Ramsay, Wendy Fraser, Pauline Robertson
(captain), Susan MacDonald, Rhona Simpson. Substitutes: Susan Gilmore,
Alison Denholm, Janet Jack, Ann Menzies.
Results: Group A -- England 2, Ireland 0; France 5, Belgium 2. Group B
-- Scotland 9, Sweden 0; Holland 3, Russia 0.
Today's games: Group A -- Italy v Germany. Group B -- Sweden v Czech
Republic, Russia v Scotland, Holland v Spain.

''There is no way at all that we have even thought about selling

WATCHING the New Zealanders train in the run-up to the final is
something else, and listening to them is an education.
There is competition in everything they do on the paddock. I was like
a pig rolling in mud watching them go at it. To drop a ball in an All
Black training session warrants being shot at dawn.
Scotland thought that they had won a small victory with their late
fightback against the New Zealanders, but I can tell you that Sean
Fitzpatrick, their captain, told his team to ease up against the Scots
in the second half.
The referee on the day heard Fitzpatrick when his team was points up.
''Right, that's the game won,'' said the captain. ''I don't want any
injuries, I don't want more than four people in rucks, and, if the backs
want to, then they can try out some of their moves.''
The big question as a Scot is to know whether the All Blacks found the
England game more physical, or easier, than their match with Scotland.
''England was a bigger test for us, purely because it was a
semi-final,'' coach Laurie Mains said to me on their training ground in
Johannesburg.
''I thought that England would cope much better than they did. On
paper, they have a stronger team than the Scots, certainly a better back
division, but they don't give their backs as many chances as Scotland.''
The one thing you find about these New Zealanders is that they don't
bull you out of sympathy. They say what they think. Usually.
Johannesburg is dry, and so is some of the All Black humour.
Fitzpatrick again: ''The only weakness we have in the side is Jonah
Lomu,'' he said. ''He can't defend, he's no good under the high ball,
and his positional play is very weak . . . ha, ha, ha.''
One man still limping badly after the England game is Zinzan Brooke,
New Zealand's devastating back-row forward who had the unheard-of cheek
to drop that goal against the English.
''I am utterly sick of hearing about it,'' said Jeff Wilson, the New
Zealand winger. Brooke has promised never to do it again.
Brooke is a maverick. He states his profession as ''Sky TV
presenter'', but he has spent much of his rugby playing career
globe-trotting.
A Maori, and brother to second-rower Robin, he has an easy smile, a
hint of shyness, and a massive presence on the pitch.
His brother has confidence, by the way. Bill McLaren said to him that
he thought he had played well. Robin thanked him. ''Yeah, so did I,'' he
said.
Some would say that Zinzan Brooke's side looks to be one of the
best-ever All Black teams, but they have still leaked points.
''I think that this is a very good New Zealand side, but as to whether
it's the best ever I would leave that judgment until after the final,''
he said.
Just looking at two of the men in charge, Colin Meads and Brian
Lochore, makes me think that it would need to be a very brave All Black
to claim to be the best while those two were within earshot.
Meads and Lochore have a tangible effect on their charges. ''As to
giving away points late in our games, I think we still have to
concentrate on playing for 80 minutes and not relax at any time.''
Brooke wasn't going to admit to deliberately slowing up in any of his
games, and refused to be drawn on whether the England game was harder
than the Scotland one.
But the final is just a few days away now, and as the All Blacks
pounded away on the dry South African turf there was just one thing on
their minds, and that was Francois Pienaar's South African team, who are
relaxing in Sun City before the showdown at Ellis Park.
''South Africa have been playing well all tournament,'' said Brooke.
''We have to make sure that we put them away as best we can, but I think
that this will be the biggest game that we have ever played.''
Campaign manager Lochore says that this All Black side has coped with
the pressures of playing five Test matches back to back and he expects
all of his players to be fit for selection, although a few are battle
weary, the hirpling Zinzan Brooke among them.
Brooke only took to the field against England with the help of
extensive strapping to an Achilles tendon injury that has plagued him
for six weeks.
''So far, it's so good,'' said Brooke. ''I think that we are all very
focused. I enjoy being with these guys and I hope to be fit for
selection. And I also know that we are going to get a whole lot
better.''
Saturday's game will be the biggest test of New Zealand rugby ever,
and the more time you spend with these All Blacks, the more you realise
that they have been preparing for this for six months solid, and their
initial low-profile entry into the competition suited them perfectly.
When you see them out of their All Black strips, walking down to the
training ground, you wonder what it is that gives them their success.
Some of them look like little boys. When you see them training and
hear them talk then you understand why they are what they are.
These are the All Blacks, and they are a different breed.
' The England match was a bigger test for us than Scotland, purely
because it was a semi-final '

After a 15-year absence in the sporting group, Fiat has launched a
coupe that may have edge its nose forward to the front of the starting
grid.
FIAT based the press launch of its new coupe at Ackergill Tower near
Wick, which provided the chance to drive on the kind of open roads for
which a sporting coupe is designed. It also allowed the car to show off
its well-balanced handling on the A and B-class routes of Caithness and
Sutherland, but while the sweeping bends came thick and fast, the
surfaces there are so good that they always flatter the ride quality.
One of the most striking pre-war coupe designs was the Fiat 508CMM,
specifically developed for the Mille Miglia race. A smoothed-out 1100S
continued the basic line from 1947, and Fiat made many another coupe,
from the rather grand 2300S to the rally-bred 124 Abarth and the
Ferrari-engined Dino. But it sidled out of coupe production in 1979,
letting saloons and hatchbacks rule the roost until now.
Fiat went through a rather stodgy phase, and it is only recently that
a statement made at Ackergill ''we're a company that's passionate about
cars'', could once more ring true. Pete Davies, head of Fiat's styling
centre, which was responsible for the overall design and the exterior
appearance of the coupe, while Pininfarina looked after the interior and
the actual coachbuilding, reckons that: ''We became too rational, too
intellectual, too logical, too architectural in our styling. We forgot
that cars are not buildings, they're automobiles.'' The present chief
executive of Fiat Auto, Paolo Cantarella, is a real car enthusiast. No
mere bean-counter would have given the Cinquecento the nod, and the same
can be said about the eye-catching new coupe.
This is a modern-looking car, with a few retro details like the
old-fashioned racing-style fuel filler. It was quite a brave decision to
go for the ''razor slash'' bonnet opening line. When you lift the
bonnet, which includes the wheel arches, you think for one awful moment
that the engine is going to spill out over the sides.
A stand-out interior feature is the metal strip, in bodywork colour,
sweeping across the fascia and along the doors. Reflections badly affect
the instrument glasses on it.
The standard 16-valve model, whose 1995cc engine peaks at 142bhp,
costs #17,348. Fiat people tend to be more enthusiastic about the turbo,
boosted to 195bhp and costing #19,248. However, after driving a 16-valve
over those northern roads I feel that, although its 0-60mph time of
about nine seconds and 129mph test-track maximum pale beside the turbo's
7.5 seconds and 140mph, the smooth power delivery, flexibility and fine
handling balance make up for a certain performance loss.
The appropriately fruity exhaust note never develops into a rasp,
while the car is quiet at its cruising speed and low on road noise as
well. The overall impression on the move is of sports performance and
handling combined with mechanical refinement. Fiat may have kept away
from sporting coupes for a decade-and-a-half, but it has put its new car
on the front row of the grid.

WITH the old guard having moved over -- Elliot Bunney retired to the
rugby pitch -- there has been a youth assault on Scottish sprinting.
The top five rankings for the season to date, courtesy of the Scottish
Association of Track Statisticians, show Doug Walker heading the 200
metres, the oldest runner at 21.
Walker, whose marginally wind-assisted 20.53 seconds puts him among
Britain's leading 200m runners, has a legal clocking of 21.02, in the
heats of the British Universities championships. On the strength of
these he must be guaranteed a place in the World Student Games team.
With his only 400m run, indoors, he has booked second place at that
distance, though world junior bronze medallist, Ian Mackie of Pitreavie,
is in pole position over the 100m.
The Heriot Watt student has a slight hamstring problem and is debating
whether to miss this weekend's national championships at Meadowbank.
Brian Whittle has not been in action outdoors, having suffered from
back problems. But he still leads the one-lap times, ahead of Walker,
from his indoor time on the boards and will be back this weekend. Tom
McKean also has not yet raced outdoors and will make his season's debut
this weekend.
Darren Ritchie, 20 in February, has reached 7.46m in the long jump,
topping the standings. With defending champion John Mackenzie and a
fit-again Duncan Mathieson, this could be the highlight of this
weekend's field competition.
* YVONNE Murray faces a fierce field in the 1500m at the Gateshead
Games on July 2. Three of the world's seven fastest last year -- Murray
was seventh -- are in the field, including Sonia O'Sullivan, the world
No.1 who relieved her of the European 3000m title, and AAA champion
Kelly Holmes.

ENGLAND have made two changes to the side which was steamrollered by
New Zealand on Sunday for the third-place play-off game against France
in Pretoria tomorrow.
The All Black wing Jonah Lomu must be considered to have claimed yet
another victim in the form of English right winger Tony Underwood who
is, officially, ''rested'' after his nightmare at the hands of the
Tongan express in Cape Town. Ian Hunter, the Northampton wing, takes
over the No.14 shirt.
The other change to the side which will seek victory over France at
Loftus Versfeld -- and avoid the necessity of pre-qualification for RWC
1999 -- is in the pack where Dean Richards gives way to Bath's Steve
Ojomoh.
Yesterday, team manager Jack Rowell said that Richards -- who had a
poor semi-final against the All Blacks -- was carrying a shoulder injury
from the game against Australia.
However, of the younger Underwood, he said: ''Tony is rested on the
right wing and Ian Hunter takes over. My view is that Tony remains the
best right wing in England. He has 20 caps already and he will double
that number in the future but, right now, he needs a rest. I have spoken
to Tony personally and I have told him that he needs a rest.''
Rowell said that Underwood had suffered no lasting psychological
damage as a result of facing up to the giant Tongan.
''Lomu is a challenge for anyone and if you met him on the street you
would feel challenged by his presence. He is a phenomenon and an
outstanding athlete but I feel sure that for the final, South Africa
will have more time to prepare and plan for him.
''Tony did not do too well against him but the England team did not
give him the support that we had planned.''
Rowell was asked whether the ''car-crash theory'' -- which runs along
the lines that there is no better time than now for an accident victim
to get back behind the wheel -- might not apply to Underwood.
''Well,'' he said, ''I know that my wife has tested that theory many
times and I know that it doesn't always work.''
Rowell was quitely critical of both the decision to have all but the
top three sides qualify for the 1999 tournament and of the manner in
which England have been ''shipped all over the country'' and will play
their first game at altitude against France tomorrow.
However, he declined to respond to media questions regarding newspaper
comments about England's performance against New Zealand from his
predecessor, Geoff Cooke.
''I don't read domestic papers and I don't want to hear what the
previous England manager has to say,'' he said, testily.
He said that tomorrow, in what was still an important game but not one
that the players on either side would particularly be looking forward
to, he wanted to see removed the ''aberrations'' which his side
committed on Sunday.
''England had won 10 games in a row until Sunday but we committed
several aberrations and I would hope that we would not commit them
again. A lot hangs on Thursday's game -- not least the qualification
angle -- and you can be sure that France, who trained this morning and
will train again this afternoon, are taking it seriously and will be
saying, let's stop the rot against England.''
''We have been shipped around the country and have never had a chance
to settle. Let's hope that our will to win will overcome the altitude
problem.''
France, meanwhile, have made three changes to the team that lost to
South Africa.
Albert Cigagna wins his first cap, replacing No.8 Marc Cecillon, while
Franck Mesnel comes in at fly-half for Christophe Deylaud, and Laurent
Benezech replaces prop Louis Armary. Teams:
England -- M J Catt (Bath); I G Hunter (Northampton), W J C Carling
(Harlequins), J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R Andrew
(Wasps), C D Morris (Orrell); J Leonard, B C Moore (both Harlequins), V
E Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C Bayfield, T A K Rodber
(both Northampton), S O Ojomoh (Bath), B B Clarke (both Bath).
France -- J-L Sadourny; E N'tamack, P Sella, T Lacroix, P Saint-Andre;
F Mesnel, F Galthie; L Benezech, J-M Gonzalez, C Califano, O Merle, O
Roumat, A Benazzi, L Cabannes, A Cigagna.

RUGBY-MAD South Africans consider New Zealand's 18[1/2]-stone, 6ft 4in
Jonah Lomu to be a serious threat to their side's chances of winning the
Rugby World Cup.
But cabinet ministers in the country's Senate -- who are not taking
the threat so seriously -- have discussed ways of stopping him at
Johannesburg's Ellis Park stadium on Saturday.
On Monday, Deputy Environment Minister Bantu Holomisa -- a keen rugby
player -- said the cabinet would have to think of ways of stopping the
All Black dangerman who scored four tries against England on Sunday.
Former Springbok captain Dawie de Villiers, who is now minister of the
environment, said he might curb Lomu by using a clause which empowers
him to ban any activity that could harm the environment.
Lomu also has dominated the front and back pages of most of the
country's newspapers.
''Springboks have a plan for Lomu,'' trumpeted the Afrikaans-language
Beeld in its lead story.
''Small is not scared of Lomu,'' declared The Citizen, referring to
Lomu's marker on Saturday, James Small.
In its inside pages, Beeld carried a cartoon of South African
President Nelson Mandela on the telephone to Francois Pienaar, asking
the Springbok captain: ''Francois, about Lomu, must I call out the
army?''
The wave of interest in Lomu has diverted the pressure away from his
team-mates in the build-up to Saturday's final, according to fellow
winger Jeff Wilson.
Wilson, until recently unchallenged as the golden boy of All Black
rugby, said that Lomu fever was being viewed as a positive influence
among the rest of the New Zealand squad.
''We certainly don't resent the attention he's getting,'' said Wilson.
''I think it's taken a lot of pressure off the guys, and you can just
see he's thriving on it.''
''He's a star and a great player. I'm just glad he's on our side. He's
certainly had to mature a lot in the last six weeks and it's great to
see him come through that.''
Asked how he would stop Lomu if required, Wilson replied: ''Play in
the same team as him.''
New Zealand will name their side tomorrow but former All Black great
Brian Lochore warned people not to dismiss the current unit as a one-man
team.
''We know that's not a fact,'' said Lochore. ''He's only one of 26
when he's in our tour party. We know how important the other guys are to
making him play well. He's getting tremendous support from the other
players on and off the field.''

A NEW book celebrates the career of one of the most highly regarded
Scottish racing drivers of the 1950s. Archie and the Listers, by Robert
Edwards, is sub-titled ''the heroic story of Archie Scott-Brown and the
marque he made famous''. I hope it does that marvellous character
justice, although promises from the publishers that a copy of the book
was or would be in the post have produced not a sniff of it here.
In these days when there is overblown publicity for Formula One at the
expense of other forms of motor sport -- halfway through this season, do
we have to have so much speculation about who will sign Michael
Schumacher for 1996? -- it is good to be reminded of a decade such as
the 1950s when top-class sports car racing, seen at circuits all over
Britain and abroad, was also given its due.
Archie Scott-Brown was one of the most exuberant sports-car racers of
a competitive era. He could take on any of the top British drivers man
to man, beat them on many occasions, and earned from Stirling Moss
himself the accolade of ''brilliant''.
Yet he was born with one hand virtually unformed, and his legs were
too short for his normally proportioned body. None of this stopped him
hurling around some of the hairiest sports cars imaginable, or dashing
across the track in Le Mans-type running starts.
Archie's first forays in motor sport were modest affairs, as when he
entered his pre-war Standard Eight tourer for a little Scottish Sporting
Car Club event at Stepps stadium. Then he bought an MG TD, and when he
moved south to work -- also reporting on the English motor sport scene
for the Glasgow-based magazine Top Gear -- raced a fearsome little
Tojeiro-JAP sports car for Brian Lister of Cambridge.
Lister started building sports cars of his own. With Scott-Brown at
the wheel the Lister-MG, Lister-Bristol, Lister-Maserati and eventually
the tremendously fast Lister-Jaguar won races all over Britain, against
tough opposition.
Although some organisers would not accept entries from a driver they
regarded as disabled, he graduated to the Connaught Grand Prix team.
Photographs of Archie driving a Connaught show how close to the wheel he
needed his seat positioned, to be able to reach the pedals.
But it was in a Lister that he drove his final race, the Belgian
Sports Car Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps in 1958. Archie was hammering
round in the lead when his car slid off an unexpected wet patch of road
and crashed heavily. The lion-hearted Scot died in hospital of his
injuries.
Archie and the Listers costs #17.99, and the simplest way of acquiring
a copy may be through the mail-order firm Mill House Books at Eastville,
Boston, Lincolnshire, PE22 8LS. It should tell a heart-warming story, of
a spectacular driver who once said that he never thought of himself as
handicapped, because he had never known himself any different.

THE wind of change is about to torpedo through Scottish rugby in the
coming months as preparations begin for the next Rugby World Cup, in
1999, and for the future structure of the sport well into the 21st
century.
There will never have been a time when so many alterations are made,
so fundamental a review undertaken. But the SRU, guardians of the game
in this country, have to make choices, and quickly.
Consider this: among the appointments which have to be made before the
international team takes the field again are: 1, a new team manager; 2,
a new coach; and 3, a new captain. I will give my opinion on who they
might be a little further on.
In addition, there is a new domestic set-up with the top leagues
containing home and away fixtures, plus a Scottish Cup, both to be
financially backed by new sponsors Tennents. The union will receive more
cash from private companies than ever before, and the demands from clubs
and players for a greater share of the money is also likely to increase.
Most importantly of all, the SRU, like all other ruling rugby bodies,
will have to define again its attitude to professionalism. Just how much
are players to be permitted to earn, and for doing what? These are
questions which will not go away.
For more than three years I have been in a privileged position, acting
as the SRU's part-time adviser on media and public relations. I was also
a member of the World Cup squad, a great honour and an experience which
I shall never forget. As one who lived with them for over five weeks let
me tell you they are among the finest ambassadors this country has ever
sent abroad.
Gavin Hastings would be an asset at any embassy, a man of enormous
patience and civility, of good fellowship. He had 100% backing from all
his players, who thought nothing of training twice a day before
attending a function at a club or business premise in the evening. These
''amateur'' sportsmen worked a far longer day than most professionals on
tour.
In the World Cup not all the players in the party could get a game.
Jeremy Richardson, John Manson and Cameron Glasgow were the unlucky ones
this time. Yet their contribution was immense. They were coaching at
schools, organising golf games, generally keeping spirits high. The
other regular reserves, members of the ''dirt-trackers' team,'' Ian
Smith and Peter Walton, were always at the heart of the fun.
My haunting memory of South Africa will be going into the dressing
room after that devastating injury-time loss against France. You could
have cut the emotion with a knife, the heads were down, not even Doddie
Weir could raise a smile.
Manson and Walton did what we always do in a crisis -- they made a pot
of tea. An hour later the boys were back up, some even believed we could
beat the All Blacks. Well, they certainly gave it a better go than some.
At the end of the tournament I handed my resignation to Bill Hogg, the
SRU chief executive. Mine was always to be a short-term appointment, and
I believe now that the union, which is a multi-million pound business,
needs the services of a full-time person or company in the field of
public relations. This was never a job I sought as I wish to continue to
write.
They also require a full-time manager of the international side.
Latterly, Duncan Paterson was spending more time on rugby than he was on
his business, and being paid only mileage to do it. That is a ridiculous
situation and cannot continue. Scotland were very lucky to have
Paterson, who won the respect and loyalty of the players. I liked
working with him.
The most logical choice for manager is Jim Telfer, already director of
rugby and a full-time employee. We have had our tiffs, yet this is a man
with cast-iron credentials and a will to match. He is also a winner.
Richie Dixon, who I think has earned the right to seniority, is likely
to be joined on the coaching staff by David Johnston, the former
Watsonian centre. DJ has built a solid reputation with the A team and,
like most lawyers, knows how to present a good case.
Rob Wainwright will be the new captain. The Army doctor is among the
finest forwards in Europe and will lead by example. In the longer term
Graham Shiel, one of the players to enhance his reputation in the World
Cup, may well emerge as a candidate. Maybe he should work on his
goal-kicking, too.
The SRU itself needs a re-organisation of the committee structure.
There is a need for an executive body, one which is able to take action
quickly.
Professionalism? Yes, it is coming, if it is not already here. I do
not believe in paying for playing, nor do I think that it is in the
players' interests. What they should be permitted to do, however, is to
earn cash from any off-field activities.
The Union fought hard to give the players the best accommodation in
South Africa. From their five-star hotel in Johannesburg the Rugby World
Cup disputes committee instructed that the team should be housed in a
three-star establishment.
These days have gone and if rugby administrators do not realise it
they will be swept away, not by professional players, but by officials
who will be paid to make sure the stars of the show are in the top
dressing rooms.
I believe in the future of Scottish rugby, a message I will continue
to expand upon on these pages.
'The most logical choice for manager is Jim Telfer, a man with
cast-iron credentials and a will to match'

DAY one of the royal meeting at Ascot, and Herald racing expert Martin
Gale was on the mark straight away, napping the winner of the big race,
Bahri, 11-4, (pictured left), who was very impressive when landing the
St James's Palace Stakes by four lenghts.
Twice third in classics this year, the John Dunlop-trained Bahri
demonstrated he is a class act by racing clear of Charnwood Forest and
Vettori after having entered the straight.
Bahri's Irish 2000 Guineas defeat at the Curragh by Spectrum and
Adjareli was blamed on a slow pace.
Pacemaker Muhab led the field to the two-furlong pole, from where
Willie Carson took it up and the race was quickly over, Adjareli
finishing a well-beaten seventh on the day his owner, the Aga Khan,
returned to British racing.
Carson was thrilled. ''We went into the race thinking he might not
stay a stiff mile, but we came out of the racing thinking differently,''
he said. ''It looks as though he might be one of the best milers this
year. He's definitely a better horse than when he ran in the Guineas.''

WARNING Shadows represents excellent value at around 12-1 for today's
#140,000-added Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot.
Harayir, winner of the 1000 Guineas, looks likely to go off as
favourite but the form of the Newmarket classic has taken a few knocks.
And Dick Hern's filly looks poor value following her modest fifth in
the Irish 1000 Guineas, which connections blamed on rain-softened
ground.
That did not worry John Oxx's Ridegewood Pearl, who ran out a decisive
four-length winner from Warning Shadows, the latter putting in her best
work in the closing stages.
But while Ridgewood Pearl is an unknown quantity on today's forecast
fast surface, it will suit Warning Shadows.
The going was good to firm when she made her racecourse debut in a
Newmarket maiden in April, where she showed a fine turn of foot to beat
Tinashaan by one-and-a-half lengths.
Trainer Clive Brittain was in typically bullish mood after that
success and his decision to supplement the chestnut for the Irish
Guineas was clearly justified.
Her performance at the Curragh was all the more remarkable considering
she had only set foot on a racecourse for the first time around five
weeks previously.
Warning Shadows has scope for further improvement and looks capable of
reversing the Curragh form with Ridgewood Pearl.
Darnay can defy top weight in the #50,000-added Royal Hunt Cup.
Saeed bin Suroor's runners are the flavour of the month after his
amazing Oaks-Derby double with Moonshell and Lammtarra.
That augurs well for Darnay, who spent the winter in Dubai and he is
the class act here.
He finished a length second to the smart Millkom in the Group 1 Prix
Jean Prat at Longchamp last year and earlier ran a good third to Foyer
and Overbury at York.
Darnay could prove even better than his current rating of 109 and he
has reportedly pleased in his preparation.
Petit Poucet can take the opening #50,000-added Jersey Stakes.
Noel Clement's colt held a St James's Palace Stakes entry but the
decision to aim a bit lower can prove a shrewd one.
He is the form selection here on his fine two and a quarter length
third to Vettori in the French 2000 Guineas, where he kept on in good
style.
Marl, so impressive when beating Satellite Star six lengths at Newbury
last month, will be a popular order and can oblige in the #40,000-added
Queen Mary Stakes.

A US Air Force court-martial has acquitted the only officer charged in
the accidental shooting down of two American helicopters over northern
Iraq last year.
Twenty-six men were killed, including two British officers, when an
American air patrol mistook the two helicopters for Iraqi planes on
April 14.
The patrol was enforcing Operation Provide Comfort, the relief of the
Kurds in northern Iraq. One of the rules is that Kurdistan is a ''no-fly
zone''. The patrols had orders to shoot down any Iraqi planes they
encountered.
The two Blackhawk helicopters were on a related, diplomatic mission,
taking a group of Kurdish officials and Allied intelligence officers to
a meeting. An exhaustive Pentagon inquiry was held to discover why the
pilots of the two F-15s mistook the Blackhawks for Soviet-built Hind
helicopters.
Six men were originally charged, including the pilots and four men
aboard the Awacs radar plane that was watching over them.
Charges against the five others were dropped, and now the Awacs pilot,
Captain Jim Wang, has been acquitted after a 12-day trial.
The prosecution contended that two radar screens aboard the
surveillance plane showed green blips indicating friendly planes.
The defence denied this. They contended that they had never been told
that Allied helicopters were operating in the area.
The two pilots reported that they had looked over the two helicopters,
misidentifying them. They had only a second or two to recognise, or fail
to recognise them.
There is a system known as Identify Friend or Foe (IFF), by which a
friendly plane sends out an identifying signal that can be picked up by
its own side.
Evidently, the system failed this time. The Pentagon has yet to tell
us how it will improve it.

<TEXT>
A BUILDING firm, which has won twelve safety awards, was fined #5000
yesterday and accused by a sheriff of ''a blatant disregard for the
safety of its employees''.
Sheriff David Crowe imposed the maximum fine on AMEC Construction
Scotland Ltd but said that it was totally inadequate for a company with
a turnover of #50m.
The company was convicted at Edinburgh Sheriff Court of breaching
safety rules at a building site at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital
last August.
It admitted failing to provide suitable guard rails along a 16- metre
length of ceiling edge.
Sheriff Crowe heard that workman Donald Tait fell three-and-a-quarter
metres backwards from the ceiling where he was working to the floor
below.
He landed on his heels, his hard hat fell off, and he hit his head on
scaffolding poles.
Mr Tait, of Firth Street, Newtongrange, suffered a gashed head and
injuries to his spine and ankles.
Depute-fiscal Pamela Watson told the court that work on the site was
six weeks behind and pressure was being applied by senior management to
get it back on schedule.
The solicitor for the Renfrew-based firm, which employs between 500
and 1200 staff depending on contracts, said it had a particularly good
safety record.It had won the British Safety Council's annual award for
each of the last 12 years.
He said there had been a dispute between AMEC and the sub-contractor
which was supposed to have fitted the rails.
The firm accepted that there had been a lack of management control,
although it denied the workforce had been encouraged to press on
regardless of safety.Mr Tait should have been specifically instructed
not to work on the ceiling until a guard rail had been fitted, said the
solicitor.
Sheriff Crowe said: ''It must be brought home to people in the
construction industry that the safety of their employees is paramount.

<HEADLINE>Surgeon uses pioneer technique for by-pass</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977780898</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FATHER of three was recovering at home yesterday after Britain's
first ''keyhole'' heart by-pass operation.
Bus company cashier Patrick Magennis was allowed home three days after
surgery at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital.
The technique, carried out by consultant cardiothoracic surgeon
Stephen Westaby, has been performed by just three other heart
specialists, in New York, Buenos Aires, and Italy.
Mr Westaby claims the ''minimal intrusion'' surgery is cheaper,
quicker, and less traumatic and could reduce by-pass waiting lists.
The operation, suitable only for patients with single artery disease,
takes one hour instead of the normal two and costs around #1000 instead
of #5000.
Mr Magennis, 42, of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, had suffered two
heart attacks since developing angina last summer. He was told he could
have been waiting until November for conventional surgery.
Mr Westaby and his team operated on Friday and, within three hours, Mr
Magennis was sitting up in bed asking for tea and toast.
In the 6O-minute operation, Mr Westaby made one six-inch incision in
the chest, through which he re-routed a coronary artery and by-passed
the blocked blood vessel.
A conventional operation would have meant opening a patient's chest,
stopping his heart, and using machinery to pump blood round the body
while a vein taken from his leg was used to form the by-pass.
Mr Westaby, who treated entertainer Frankie Vaughan for a potentially
lethal heart complaint two years ago, said the technique had yet to
convince some colleagues.
He said: ''There has been some criticism about this method but four of
us around the world have demonstrated it with success and I believe
others will follow.
''The waiting list here at the moment is at least a year and has 700
to 800 names on it. Hopefully, five to 10% of these patients can be
dealt with via this minimal intrusive surgery.
''It will mean we can get through the waiting list much more quickly.
The surgery is cheaper, takes less time, and the patient recovers more
quickly meaning beds are available.''
As he left hospital, Mr Magennis said: ''I wasn't at all worried when
I heard the doctor wanted to use this new technique because he was so
confident that it would be a success.
''I'm quite proud to have been the first person in Britain to have
this operation. It was nothing to worry about at all. I hope other
surgeons will soon be using it too.''

<HEADLINE>Hard words for Highland Cattle breeders.  Abattoir operator says breed is not important</HEADLINE>

BEEF farmers who imagine that their own particular breed is tops for
taste are largely kidding themselves, it was claimed yesterday.
Mr Owen Ryan, export development manager with Anglo Beef Processors
said: ''It's what we do in the plant that determines eating quality and
flavour -- the type of breed isn't so important. This may be heresy to
some -- but it is true and is proved every day by tasting panels in each
of our plants.''
His company is one of the biggest abattoir operators in the UK and is
a major supplier of beef and lamb.
''With our products it is tenderness, flavour and consistency that
keep the housewife coming back,'' he said. ''It is what we do in terms
of meat handling and maturation -- and what the housewife does in the
kitchen -- that is the real quality decider.''
Mr Ryan's message was possibly not what delegates at the first
international gathering of Highland Cattle Breeders wanted to hear as
they were about to consider improved marketing and promotion for their
beef.
He wished the Highland Cattle Society well in its attempt to corner a
niche market although he produced figures to show that 50% of meat sold
is now bought in supermarkets -- as against 27.8% for traditional
butchers.
The supermarket share was likely to rise to 70% over the next few
years, he forecast, and within one year he expected to see all
supermarkets insisting on farm-assured supplies. Safeway and Sainsbury
both wanted full farm assurance for beef and lamb by January of next
year, he said.
The Highlanders were trying to break into the market at a time of
falling meat consumption generally, he warned. However, his experience
was that farmers were more concerned about falling prices than falling
consumption. The meat industry was being hit by vegetarianism, by health
scares and all sorts of attacks from the welfare lobby but the biggest
threat, he perceived, came from chicken, pizza, prerpared meals and
ethnic food with little meat content.''
There were strong words too from farmer/butcher Michael Gibson of
Forres, a former president of the society, who said that too often
Highland cattle were in the hand of ''ingorant amateurs''.
''Remember, the butcher is not the final consumer but must sell it on
to a customer,'' he said. ''As a quality butcher my preference is
obviously for a prime animal, ready to slaughter and sell to my very
discerning customers. I should not be confused with the knacker man so I
am not interested in cows, aged steers, reject bulls and other such
oddities that I frequently get offered. The top prices are only paid for
the right animal.''
His advice to producers emphasised the importance of continuity of
supply. ''Consider fattening your beast over a period to enhance their
marketability,'' he advised. ''Push on the better ones and aim for July
and let the rest follow naturally on.''
Mr Ian Scott of the Robert Owen Foundation, who produced a marketing
report for the society, said that in the UK breed variety had become a
kind of short-hand for the consumer. Aberdeen Angus had managed to use
that correctly and Marks and Spencer were trying to extend the idea to
lamb products with blackface lambs and highland sheep.
If the Highlanders were to be marketed the producers would have to
show enthusiasm and commitment, he said. ''the meat is good, the
background is good, the story is good.''
The marketing scheme to be considered by the society calls for agreed
specifications for animals; a feeding regime requiring calves to be
suckled by the mother; subsequent feeding on natural forage and a list
of forbidden antibiotics.

New York, Tuesday
A MAN who admitted swindling film star Peter Falk's 92-year-old mother
out of more than $1m (#625,000) in cash and valuables has made a plea
bargain not go to prison.
Alphonso Cacace, 50, pleaded guilty to fourth-degree grand larceny
after he admitted to stealing cash, jewellery, furniture, and securities
from Madeline Falk between 1992 and 1994.
He signed papers saying he owed Mrs Falk $670,000 as well as jewels,
bonds, and $416,000 in cash that he has already returned.
The deal also requires Cacace to sell a house in Fort Lauderdale and
an apartment on New York's Central Park and give the proceeds to Mrs
Falk. Prosecutors say he bought the properties with her money.
Cacace, who could have received up to four years in prison, will now
be sentenced to five years' probation at a hearing in August.
At first Cacace said the money and property were gifts from Mrs Falk
after he befriended her at the opera and became her companion.--AP.

Bucharest, Tuesday
A ROMANIAN A310 Airbus which crashed in March killing all 60 people on
board had a technical problem just one day before the disaster, but it
went unreported, investigators said today.
In their preliminary report, accident investigators said the same
aircraft had a history of automatic throttle problems in 1994 and again
when it was used by America's Delta Airlines.
However the incident the day before the crash went unlogged.
''In the last 25 hours recorded on the flight data recorder two
similar abnormal incidents were identified, one during take-off from
Dubai on the last leg to Bucharest on March 30 1995,'' the inquiry said.
The incident ''was not entered by the crew in the aircraft's log''.
The second incident was during take-off moments before the
Brussels-bound Tarom airlines Airbus crashed near Bucharest on March 31.
The automatic throttle is the focus of the disaster inquiry.
Its report listed a catalogue of problems with the throttle control
systems of the Airbus.
The report did not definitively blame the throttle for the crash, but
repeated an earlier conclusion that the Airbus spun into the ground
after an imbalance in the power to its Pratt and Whitney-made engines
after a throttle command did not reach one engine.
It said a final verdict would come in a later report.
The inquiry has drawn in teams from Britain, Switzerland, Belgium,
France, and the United States.
The European Airbus Industrie consortium has also been closely
involved. Airbus has said any mechanical problems with the automatically
controlled throttle mechanism should have been picked up during routine
maintenance.
It has also said that Airbus pilots were trained to cope with an
imbalance of power between the two engines.--Reuter.

YOUR recent report that the new Glasgow Unitary Council is to be
dedicated not in a Christian church but in a mosque will cause alarm
bells to ring in many places.
While I believe it is vital that we have good relationships with
people of all cultures and religions, in this case I believe the council
have made a serious mistake.
Quite simply, in including one minority group who represent on recent
figures less than 2% of Glasgow's citizens they are thereby overlooking
and excluding the wishes and feelings of the vast majority. At best, it
is an oversight. At worst, it is an appalling abdication of civic
responsibility.
Also, there is a tacit assumption that the God each religion worships
is one and the same God. This is a common fallacy. The Muslims have at
least 101 names for God but to my knowledge not one of these names is
''Father'', the description par excellence of the God every Christian
worships.
Is there not a real difference of understanding here? According to
proponents of both faiths, Muslim and Christian, there is. Why should
the Convener of the City of Glasgow Council assume otherwise?
For these reasons I agree wholeheartedly with Dr William Morris,
minister of Glasgow Cathedral, that at the beginning of the new council
this is a very serious precedent. If this is the beginning, what will
the end be?

JOHN Macleod, in condemning the ''Mosquing of the council'' (June 20),
gives an eloquent display of the kind of bitter, twisted, and
narrow-minded thinking which merely serves to vindicate a bold and
progressive step by the Glasgow district councillors.
To equate Scotland's Muslim community with ''the suicide-bombers of
Lebanon'' and ''massacres in the Balkans'', quite apart from being a
cheap and nasty piece of gutter journalism is akin to lambasting the
country's Catholics for atrocities in Ireland and South America.
Furthermore, he goes on to assert that tolerance is ''something
notoriously lacking in Islamic nations'' and invites the councillors
instead to attend the Free Presbyterian Church. In view of the letters
from ''Wee Frees'' recently published in The Herald plus the nefarious
rantings of the demagogue himself, I doubt very much if these people
know the meaning of the word.
In his rabid vilification of Islam, Macleod also denigrates Cardinal
Winning, the Catholic Church, Bill Morris, the Church of Scotland,
Councillor McFadden, Glasgow's Asian community, and finally Allah. Such
tolerance indeed from the sad little man, for how hard it must be to
live as a saint among so many sinners.

A MURDER trial collapsed yesterday when the main prosecution witness
lied about her past.
Army Air Corps Corporal Scott Van Nuil, a Scot, was stabbed to death
outside Seven Sister's tube station in north London when a man tried to
steal more than #10,000 worth of cocaine from him.
Mr Roger Medford, 25, was charged with the killing after allegedly
confessing to his former girlfriend Samira Mannasib, who claimed she was
told: ''It went wrong and I gave him a couple of nicks to get away. I
think I made it worse when I pulled the knife out because he fell
down.''
Mr Medford, of Morant Place, Commerce Road, Wood Green, London, had
denied murdering Mr Van Nuil on July 29 last year.
Yesterday, on the eleventh day of the trial, Judge Bruce Laughland,
QC, decided the trial could no longer continue after defence counsel, Mr
Stephen Batten, QC, proved Miss Mannasib had lied about posing for
pornographic magazines.
Miss Mannasib, the mother of Mr Medford's five-year-old son, Tad, was
asked if she had ever worked for an escort agency, leaving her child
home alone, or posed for magazines.
The Moroccan-born 25-year-old strenuously denied the claim, only to be
caught out when Mr Batten produced the magazine.
During her cross-examination, Mr Batten asked her: ''Who is that in
those photographs?'' Miss Mannasib replied: ''She looks like me but it's
not me.''
Mr Batten later called her back to the witness stand, having tracked
down the photographer.
Giving her the magazine, he asked her: ''That's a photograph of you,
isn't it? It is a photograph of you. Where and by whom was it taken?''
In a barely audible voice, Miss Mannasib admitted: ''In a studio.''
Mr Batten stormed: ''Would you like to admit now that you lied before
I go on?''
Miss Mannasib sobbed: ''Yes.''
Turning to the jury, Mr Batten said: ''You lied when I showed you
those photographs, didn't you? You lied a few moments ago when you said
there were no such photographs of you in existence, didn't you?''
Miss Mannasib replied: ''It was a long time ago.''
During the trial, the jury was told that Mr Van Nuil, of Kirkhill
Road, Penicuik, Lothian, had agreed to act as courier for the drugs and
to deliver them to a former soldier, Mr Neville Medford, the defendant's
brother, one of two men who allegedly set up the deal.
However, the prosecution alleged Mr Neville Medford told his brothers,
Kevin and Roger, to steal the drugs and as they tried to do so, Roger
stabbed Mr Van Nuil through the heart.
Prosecutor John Nutting said that, soon after the murder, Roger
Medford met his ex-girlfriend Samira Mannasib in a McDonalds and
confessed to the killing.
In her evidence, Miss Mannasib, who is no longer having a relationship
with Mr Medford, said the only reason she told police of the confession
was to help Mr Medford.
She admitted that Medford had had a string of affairs but denied she
was bitter.

Wellington, Tuesday
NEW Zealand won an assurance from the United States today that it was
not about to end a three-year-old moratorium on nuclear testing in the
wake of last week's French decision to resume tests in the South
Pacific.
''I think it's important to assure the people of New Zealand who are
concerned in light of the French tests . . . that the United States is
not considering a resumption of nuclear testing,'' said US Ambassador
Josiah Beeman.
''The United States is observing a moratorium on nuclear testing, and
we will continue to observe that moratorium,'' he said.
Beeman, who met New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon today,
played down remarks by US Defence Secretary William Perry that the
Pentagon expected to decide soon on whether to stage fresh underground
nuclear tests, saying it was the president's decision.
''The White House has reaffirmed that the president will hold the line
and we are not considering a resumption of nuclear testing,'' he said.
* The British Government refused to rule out the possibility of
Britain following the French lead in resuming tests if the US did so.
Junior Defence Minister Lord Henley told the House of Lords: ''Whilst
working for a comprehensive test ban treaty, we do reserve the right and
must be allowed to ensure that we can take adequate steps for the safety
and reliability of our nuclear weapons.''
Earlier in the Commons, the Prime Minister again refused to condemn
France over its decision to resume testing in the Pacific.

Independent oilfield services supplier Expro International has
reported operating profits of #12.2m for the year to March 31, up from
#10.4m in the preceding year. This compares with a forecast of #12m when
the company was floated in March through a placing at 175p a share.
Yesterday the shares firmed 2p to stand at a high of 229p.
Operating margins has increased to 17.5% from 16% in 1994. Following
the flotation, net debt at the year end had fallen to #5.3m with gearing
of 34% at the year. A year ago, Expro had #58m of debt, much of it as a
result of its 1992 #52.4m management buyout from Flextech. Debt is
expected to fall again in the current year.
Group chief executive John Dawson commented: ''We are pleased with the
success of the flotation and to have exceeded the profit forecast. We
are encouraged with the progress of the business and look forward to the
future with confidence.''
There is no dividend for the year as shareholders had been forewarned
at flotation. The first dividend payable will be an interim for the year
ending March 31, 1996, payable in January.
A substantial part of group revenues come from the development and
production phases of the upstream oil and gas industry making Expro less
vulnerable to the more erratic exploration and appraisal activities.
Looking ahead, while market conditions have been difficult activity
levels are now said to be more upbeat, though oil prices remain
relatively low, in real terms, and the industry continues to focus on
cost reduction.
With oil companies budgeting on flat oil prices, they are continuing
contract out a wider range of key activities and responsibilities to to
oilfield service companies such as Expro.
In addition, companies are continuing to build their asset bases
outside the established oil provinces providing further opportunities
opportunities for Expro to develop geographically.
The company is continuing its selective international expansion. New
operations are about to commence in Norway, Australia, and in the US.
Expro is already well positioned to grow in the more established areas
of the Asia-Pacific region and Africa.
At their present level, the shares are selling at approaching 17 times
historic earnings. They have done well since flotation and the company
is clearly confident it can continue to expand its markets.

HOUSING pressure groups yesterday demanded action by the political
parties after two new surveys showed how seriously Scots look on
homelessness and bad housing.
They said the politicians must respond by giving housing a higher
profile and come forward with effective policies to solve the growing
crisis.
In a Shelter/Gallup survey, nine out of 10 members of the public
considered homelessness and bad housing a serious problem, generating a
higher level of concern than standards of education or health care.
Another poll conducted by the Scottish Federation of Housing
Associations showed that housing was the issue most often raised at MPs'
surgeries.
Ms Kate Caskie, Shelter in Scotland's depute director (communications)
said the public knew housing in Scotland was in crisis and homelessness
was at record levels.
''Housing might not be the sexy issue for politicians, the chattering
classes or the media but it is of great concern to the public,'' she
said.
She said that, last month, Shelter had put forward a programme for
additional housing investment for the next five years. An extra #580m a
year was needed to fund the programme, which would create 33,000
additional jobs in the construction and associated industries.
Twenty-four Scottish MPs responded to the SFHA survey, with 22 ranking
housing as the issue most raised by constituents at surgeries. Benefits
took second place, followed by health and social work.
Leith Labour MP Malcolm Chisholm, who is chairman of the all-party
Scottish housing group, said: ''This survey confirms that thousands of
Scots throughout the country desperately want action on the housing
front. It should remind politicians that an increase in housing
investment would be enormously popular as well as enormously
necessary.''
SFHA director David Orr said it was time that housing took up the
place it deserved on the political front.
MPs needed to make the transition from concern about the circumstances
of their individual constituents to the development of housing policies.

CAIRN Energy announced yesterday the sale of its remaining stake in a
US subsidiary to help finance a new acquisition in the Netherlands.
The Edinburgh-based oil and gas exploration company also announced the
start of commercial production at a new onshore oilfield in Thailand
which may eventually produce several thousand barrels of oil per day.
Cairn sold its remaining 15.5% stake in its former US subsidiary Cairn
Energy USA (CEUSA) for #16.1m.
The net proceeds of #12.3m after tax and expenses will help finance
its #17.3m purchase of the Dutch gas exploration and company Holland Sea
Search Holdings.
But Cairn chief executive Bill Gammell said his company was planning
to return to the United States to drill for oil and gas in the Gulf of
Mexico with a new wholly-owned subsidiary called CE North America Inc.
Cairn's said its Wichian Buri-1 onshore oil well in Thailand's SW1
concession, 250 km (150 miles) north of Bangkok, began producing 300
barrels per day of 30 degrees API crude last week.
Cairn has a 30% stake in the concession, where another well, Na
Sanun-1, flowed at 1375 bpd on a test in October.

OXFAM launched its biggest anti-poverty campaign simultaneously
yesterday in Glasgow and eight other cities around the world.
It will emphasise that poverty is a global problem which can be
tackled only by people of all countries, rich and poor, acting together.
''Poverty has to be addressed globally. This campaign does this in a
way that has never been done before,'' said Mr Iain Gray, Oxfam's deputy
head of campaigns, at the Glasgow launch.
Human rights are being flouted on an incredible scale, says Oxfam. The
report's central tenet is that poverty is a denial of basic rights, of
which it identifies 10.
Everyone, says the charity, has a right to enough to eat, clean water,
a livelihood, a home, education, health care, a safe environment,
protection from violence, equality of opportunity, and a say in their
future.
You do not have to be in a poor country to be poor, says Oxfam, which
recently started a small range of projects in Britain, including the
distribution of blankets to homeless people.

PARIS: Former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius urged artists,

right-wing National Front (FN) in weekend elections.
''Companies do not necessarily have to go to those sites. They can go
to neighbouring areas,'' said Fabius, who is of Jewish origin and has
long been the butt of FN attacks and anti-Semitic cartoons in the
far-right press.
''It's up to everyone to . . . show in practical terms that voting for
the National Front backfires on the people who vote for the National
Front.''
The FN won control of the Riviera naval port of Toulon, the aerospace

Orange, where singers due to perform at a music festival in August were

THE CBI has joined those trying to make their voices heard on the
issue of Britain's membership of the European Union. The employers
organisation yesterday set out its stall for Britain's policy makers
ahead of next year's Inter-Governmental Conference urging EU member
governments and the Commission to use the IGC to tackle the twin
challenges of competitiveness and employment.
In a document entitled Shaping the future -- a Europe that works, the
CBI reinforced the British business commitment to the EU and called on
the UK Government to re-establish its credibility as a negotiating
partner within it.
Speaking in London, CBI director-general Howard Davies said British
business saw membership of the EU as a core element in their global
business strategy.
Mr Davies, who is deputy Governor-designate of the Bank of England,
said the British Government should set out a constructive agenda for the
IGC, putting forward realistic proposals on how to improve competition
and deregulation.
There are certain areas where the CBI feels action should be taken
with a view to increasing competitiveness and generally improving the
performance of the EU. These include removing existing barriers to trade
and competition in areas such as telecommunications, transport, and
energy. In addition, the confederation called for reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy and stricter controls of state aid to industry.

<HEADLINE>Summer warning in new campaign on drink driving</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977780916</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DRINK and driving accidents are as much a risk in summer as the
traditional festive periods, according to Scottish Office Minister Lord
James Douglas Hamilton yesterday when he endorsed a national campaign.
Despite the success of campaigns to change public attitudes, Transport
Minister Steven Norris said drink driving still kills about 10 people
every week.
A tough TV commercial, which will only be shown after the 9pm
watershed, spearheads the campaign aimed primarily at 18 to
24-year-olds.
Two young men play the parts of villain and victim. The villain drinks
then drives and the victim is his mate who ends up with horrific
injuries. The advert shows the remorseful villain asking his critically
hurt friend: ''Can we still be friends?''
Men in the 18-24 age group hold 8% of driving licences, yet they are
involved in 26% of drink-drive accidents. In 1994, men in their 20s were
involved in 40% of all drink-related accidents.
Mr Norris said: ''Over the last 10 years, the number of people killed
in drink-drive accidents has fallen by nearly 60% from 1173 in 1984 to
around 500 last year.
''Publicity campaigns, legislation, and enforcement have all played
their part in this success. Together they have resulted in a growing
public condemnation of drinking and driving. But we must keep this
success in perspective. Drink-driving still kills around 10 people every
week. That is totally unacceptable.
''Young men tend to drink in groups. They enjoy nights out with the
lads and can easily be influenced by peer group pressure. What gets
under their skin, what makes them stop and think, is the possibility of
killing or crippling their mates.''
The new campaign received a warm welcome from the AA which said it
supported ''shock advertising'' and the bid to crack down on a ''serious
problem''.
''The majority of drivers never drink and drive but there is still a
hard core who persistently offend,'' said Mr Andrew Howard, the AA's
head of safety.
''Nearly 550 people are killed in drink-drive related accidents every
year and succumbing to the temptation of a drink at the barbecue, the
pub, or the hospitality tent can lead to tragedy.''

SHANKS &amp; McEwan has perked up following the sale of its loss-making
construction division, but the waste disposal group faces losses at its
Rechem subsidiary.
Shanks, which has moved its headquarters from Glasgow to
Buckinghamshire, saw profits before taxation and exceptional items rise
16% to #16.3m in the year to April 1 from #14m previously.
After writing in exceptional losses on its former construction
business, the group moved to a profit of #14.5m from a loss of #6.1m.
Chairman Gordon Waddell said the group's waste management business,
which collects domestic rubbish and buries it at landfill sites, did
well last year, particularly in England.
The waste services south division benefitted from reorganisation and
cost cutting measures and was able to impose price rises ''substantially
higher than the rate of inflation'', he said.
But Shanks &amp; McEwan's Rechem subsidiary, which incinerates hazardous
waste, made an operating loss of #400,000 after showing a profit of
#4.9m in the first half of 1993/94.
Mr Waddell said Rechem had been forced to operate at only two thirds
of its 75,000 tonnes per year capacity because of the Government's ban
on hazardous waste imports and the UK's failure to impose more stringent
standards of waste disposal, in line with those of its main EU partners.
The sale of Shanks &amp; McEwan's troubled Scottish construction division
last April cleared the way for future expansion in its core business of
waste management.
Mr Waddell said the group was on the lookout for new landfill sites
throughout the UK and would spend #12m over the next two years on
building power stations to convert heat from waste gases into
electricity.
''That will start to pay handsomely in 1997,'' he said, noting that
Shanks &amp; McEwan will sell the 19 megawatts produced with a government
subsidy.
Mr Waddell said the first two months of the current financial year had
been satisfactory. ''We are hopeful that the recovery and profitability
will continue,'' he added.
The full-year dividend was raised marginally to 3.30p from 3.24p with
a final payout of 2.2p and Shanks &amp; McEwan shares closed down 1p at 95p.

HOLLAND House has extended its #4.9m bid for Ferguson shipyard for a
further two weeks after receiving a positive response from only 42% of
shareholders.
The electrical wholesale firm owned by 80-year-old Frank Dunnet
offered 406p per share in a bid that was due to expire yesterday.
But Mr Dunnet's son Alan, who is managing director of Holland House,
said: ''We have received 42.43% acceptance from shareholders at the
present time and we are going to extend the offer for a further two
weeks.''
Holland House wants to buy at least 50% of the profitable Port Glasgow
shipyard, he added.
The Ferguson board is privately split on the bid which values the
shipyard at #1m more than its net assets and offers shareholders four
times the money that they invested four years ago.
Four of the six directors, including chief executive Bill Scott,
support the Holland House bid, but chairman Sir Ross Belch and one other
director oppose it.
Sir Ross launched his own unsuccessful bid for Ferguson in February
through his financially troubled firm Altnacraig Shipping.
Control of Ferguson rests with 290 small shareholders who bought into
the shipyard under a Business Expansion Scheme in 1990.

I FIND it a little curious that on publication of the Queen's Birthday
Honours list on June 17, Sir Cliff Richard was accorded front-page
acknowledgment while Dr Morris -- the minister of Glasgow Cahtedral --
who was awarded a KCVO was not even mentioned.

FIRST Leisure is still looking for development acquisitions in
Scotland where at present it has just three pubs and also a discotheque
in Aberdeen.
Currently, the main push is into bingo in England where start-up costs
will be #1m in the second half of the current financial year and perhaps
#3m in 1995-96.
Interim pre-tax profits were above most expectations, showing a 24.6%
increase to #17.2m on overall turnover up 12.9% to #71m.
Chief executive John Conlan said the National Lottery had not had much
impact on the majority of the businesses apart from bingo. But he is
much more cautious about scratchcards. He added that one has to be
realistic, the Lottery is here to stay. ''Don't whinge -- get market
share from the next guy,'' he said.
Dancing activities have been highly successful with the return up
almost a quarter at #10.5m. The company's policy of courting the student
an over-25s sector in the early part of the week appears to have been
successful.
It has also bucked the general trend in bowling where some competitors
are cutting back on capacity athough that has meant lower prices to
encourage higher numbers of participants.
Profits at the resorts, the important one being Blackpool, were
marginally lower, reflecting the poor weather. The interim dividend has
been raised 9.9% to 2.33p.
The outlook is for full-year profits to rise about #4m to #40.5m.

THE #750,000 award to Graeme Souness is the latest in a series of
astronomical awards by English courts in libel actions. When the former
deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, Jeffrey Archer, recovered
#500,000 from the Sun newspaper, it became apparent that juries were
prepared to place a high monetary value on a wrongly-slurred reputation.
Until then most large awards had been based on actual financial loss
when, for instance, a company had lost money and business because of a
false accusation about its viability.
Jeffrey Archer was, and still is, a world-acknowledged author, and
sales of his novels were not adversely affected by the lies published
about him. To award him such a large sum of money (every penny of which
he donated to various charities) probably caused an intake of breath in
many an editor's office, and if it served as a timely reminder of the
dangers of falsely wrecking a person's reputation then it served its
purpose.
Scottish courts see few defamation actions; a committee into court
business reported that over a 15-year period the Court of Session only
heard an average of one a year, while Sheriff Court cases are not very
common either.
One such action arose in the 1970s, when the former Lord Provost of
Dundee sued a political opponent after he took offence at a leaflet used
in the local elections. The case, which lasted for three days, resulted
in Sheriff John Christie finding in favour of the defender and awarding
expenses against Charles Farquhar. Political colleagues and friends
probably helped to pay the bill.
However, most Scots appear to be either cannier about litigating or
have thicker skins. As it is impossible to obtain legal aid to fight an
action to clear one's reputation, only those who are very rich or have
outside support can afford to embark on such litigation. The late Robert
Maxwell knew this well, and it is said used it to his advantage.
Protected by his supposed vast wealth, he threatened litigation
against anybody who dared to speak against him, and promised to defend
every writ raised until the opposition could risk no more. Such
behaviour, if true, was a gross abuse of power.
The English courts have, over the years, seen some amazing libel
actions, a few of which seem somewhat ridiculous in retrospect. During
the 1930s a London policeman obtained #1000 damages from the makers of
Jeyes fluid because they published his photograph beside an
advertisement commending their product. A court held that the
advertisement implied that the unfortunate police officer had smelly
feet!
Why the case was not settled at an early stage, with an apology and a
public declaration that no such imputation was ever intended, is not
known. The case was in fact only one of a number in which newspaper
advertisements were scrutinised.
In 1929, stockbroker Cyril Tolley sued the chocolate manufacturers J S
Fry &amp; Sons Ltd for damages. Tolley was a former amateur golf champion
and one of the few people ever to beat the legendary Bobby Jones. He
argued that Fry's had impuned his amateur status by publishing, without
his consent, his picture, accompanied by a ditty praising his golf and
equating it to a Fry's chocolate bar.
Aided by the forensic efforts of the future Lord Goddard, and despite
a temporary setback when the Appeal Court quashed the jury's award of
#1000, Tolley won a final victory in the House of Lords by 4-1. The
court concluded that anybody seeing the advertisement might think he had
been paid for his endorsement, and had thereby violated his amateur
status.
When one hears of modern, so-called non-professionals receiving
sponsorship and large cash awards, it is difficult to realise how
strongly Tolley must have felt to pursue his case through three courts
until he achieved final vindication in 1931.
One year later another stockbroker went to law as a result of an
advertisement which had appeared in the Evening Standard of May 26,
1932. At the time, the yo-yo was being launched onto the market. The
manufacturers decided to instruct a John McNulty to prepare a humorous
form of advertisement drawing attention to this harmless toy. It was as
a result of his efforts that the humourless Blennerhasset became the
laughing stock of his colleagues in the Stock Exchange.
The advertisement consisted of the tale of a Mr Blennerhassett, who
changed from a sound businessman who ate lobster salad and played golf
at Walton Heath into a demented yo-yo player in a lunatic asylum. The
story was accompanied by a series of drawings depicting the downfall of
the yo-yo fanatic from a sober businessman with bowler hat and
pinstriped trousers into a pathetic figure with straw through his hair,
concentrating intently on a recalcitrant yo-yo.
The fact that the author had never heard of the stockbroker and that
the name was an invention of his four-year-old daughter, did not deter
the intrepid plaintiff from suing McNulty and the newspaper.
Although he had never played golf, never owned a yo-yo and did not
like lobster, he insisted on taking his case before Mr Justice Branston
and a jury, where he learnt that a lack of a sense of humour could be
very expensive. The case was thrown out on the orders of the judge.
Faced with paying the legal costs of both sides Blennerhassett might
have done well to remember the advice that ''sticks and stones may break
your bones but names will never hurt you''; on the other hand if the
future Lord Archer had followed that tack, five charities would be much
poorer today.

COMEDIAN Bernard Manning promised yesterday to tone down his
controversial act after objections to ''offensive and vile'' racist
jokes.
The heavyweight comic survived an attempt to stop the renewal of the
entertainments licence at his Embassy Club in Manchester, when it came
before the city's licensing committee.
Shopkeeper Hitesh Bhatt, 33, told the committee that Manning should
have his licence taken away because of material he had used at a recent
charity dinner, which was secretly taped and shown on TV's World in
Action programme.
However, the committee renewed the licence for a year after
councillors were told their powers were limited.
Manning told the committee: ''Thank you very much indeed and I will
try to tone it down, I promise you that. It is up to me and I shall do
it.''
Mr Pat Karney, secretary of the ruling Labour group, said councillors
joined the chief constable and the Bishop of Manchester in condemning
what they saw on the TV programme as ''offensive and objectionable and
vile''.
Mr Karney, a councillor in Harpurhey, Greater Manchester -- where the
comedian has run the club for 36 years -- suggested its licence should
be renewed for only six months to give Manning a chance to improve his
act.
Mr Bhatt, who has two children and was the only objector to the
licence, said: ''I came to ask the simple question, whether racist
remarks are a valid form of entertainment and what the council wants to
see in pubs and clubs. Do we need this sort of provocative material?''
The World in Action programme centred on a dinner attended by police
officers and led to calls for Manning, 65, to be prosecuted for inciting
racial hatred.
He told the committee: ''That was an all-male show. It was a
tailor-made act to an audience, all men, macho police.''
He told Mr Bhatt: ''If you come to my club, there will be no colour
bar. The pianist is Jewish. There will be nothing in the act that
reflects on your colour or country. You would enjoy yourself.''

HUGE crowds turned out yesterday to catch a glimpse of high society's
wedding of the year at Richmond register office in south-west London.
However, former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan and English
heiress Jemima Goldsmith declined to kiss for the cameras after a short
civil ceremony.
Hordes of well-wishers and the media were buzzing with expectation
over what 21- year-old Jemima -- now known as Haiqa Khan -- would wear.
Finally emerging with her billionaire father Sir James Goldsmith from
a black Daimler, she delighted crowds with her stunning cream suit.
The outfit, a creation of top designer Bruce Oldfield, was a subtle
cocktail of Asian and European styles.
Imran, 42, who arrived a full half-hour before his bride, wore Punjabi
national dress -- cream trousers with a tunic top, covered with a black
sleeveless jacket.
The couple were married last month in an Islamic ceremony in Paris.
They reaffirmed their vows before close family in a small room in the
Georgian register office on Paradise Road.
Jemima, who appeared somewhat overwhelmed by so much attention, smiled
coyly at the cameras.
Her husband, obviously more accustomed to the limelight, was far more
relaxed as he ushered his young bride through the photographic
formalities.
They left the register office to be greeted by a huge roar of approval
from the throng, many of whom were from Britain's Pakistani community.
A march played by a piper cut through the air as they were driven away
to a lavish reception at Sir James's #1.5m eighteenth-century mansion
nearby.
Imran and Jemima stayed for lass than two hours at Ormeley Lodge after
the ceremony before being driven away together.
Guests invited to a dinner and mid-summer ball at the mansion were not
expected to begin arriving until mid-evening.
Among those expected were Prince and Princess Michael of Kent and
Princess Alexandra and her husband Sir Angus Ogilvy.
Other famous names included Sir David and Lady Frost, former England
cricket captain David Gower, and Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer.

ROY BEERS'S speculations on the outcome had Charles Edward Stuart
actually reached London in the '45 are somewhat flawed (June 14).
While it is true that the English did not rise in support of the
Stuarts, I doubt they would have put themselves out to defend the
detested Hanoverians, particularly if the head of that faction had fled.
Had Charles Edward Stuart come any closer, German Geordie would have
run away so fast he would have reached Hanover before his ship.
As for the ''seasoned veterans closing in for the kill'', let us
remember that Marshal Wade could have done precisely that at Carlisle.
Instead, he chose to lie low and say nothing, thereby proving himself
the perfect embodiment of the pragmatic genius of the English nation.
Following his failure to appeal to the clans to stake everything on a
march on London from Derby, Charles Edward looked (from that point only)
like a loser. Therefore, he lost.
As the great Montrose observed,
He either fears his fate too much,
Or his desserts are small,
That dares not put it to the touch,
To win or lose it all.
He should know. He lost too.

Alison Kerr meets Patrick Doyle, who began his musical career as a
punishment exercise.
FEW actors take the stage at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall, but then
few actors become composers. At least, not good ones. Uddingston-born
Patrick Doyle is the exception -- on both counts. The composer of scores
for such films as Dead Again, Carlito's Way and Indochine, Doyle will be
presenting an evening of his music, as played by the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra as part of its Glasgow proms, next Tuesday.
In terms of achievement, Doyle has come a long way. In terms of
distance, however, he hasn't: on Tuesday he will be appearing only
metres from where his talents were first nurtured -- at the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama building in what's now Nelson
Mandela Place. Doyle first attended the RSAMD as a tuba player in its
junior orchestra, and later became an undergraduate there.
The interest in music had been there since Doyle -- the middle child
in a brood of thirteen -- asked his parents for lessons. But what
convinced him to sign up for a degree course in the subject was the
influence of his opera-loving father, himself ''a great singer, with a
voice like McKellar''.
In typical teen style, Doyle resisted his father's taste in music for
as long as possible. ''My father used to play this stuff -- like John
McCormack and Caruso -- and I couldn't bear it. Then one day when I was
about 16, he put on a Jussi Bjorling recording of the Celeste Aida.
Bjorling hit a top B-flat, and this note just tingled my spine -- I
thought: 'This is great -- a human being doing that'. My interest was
kindled overnight and suddenly everything fell into place.''
At the academy, Doyle studied piano and singing (investment in a voice
being cheaper than buying his own tuba). Composition did not enter into
it, and he certainly never considered becoming a composer, although one
incident did hint at his talent in that area.
One teacher, Stanley Thomson, as punishment for Doyle's larking about,
told him to produce a piano trio for the following week. Doyle recruited
two classmates -- cellist Shona McFadyen and violinist Wilson Hainey --
and together they performed his penance.
''I can remember Stanley's astonishment -- everyone thought it was
really good. I was surprised because it had come quite easily, and
because I thought it was crap . . .''
The original plan after graduation in 1975 was to teach, but Doyle had
realised that he wasn't a natural born teacher. He stuck it out for a
year before giving it up, and within a week he was called by Morag
Fullarton of the Brass Monkey Theatre Company. Fullarton had known Doyle
at the RSAMD,and although he hadn't acted there, she felt that -- based
on his clowning around and talent for mimicry -- he was the man for her
play Nice One, Maggie and a revue she was planning.
A year as an actor and musical director at the Citizens' Youth Theatre
company followed before Doyle again hooked up with Fullarton for their
1950s-set musical, Glasvegas.
Glasvegas was Doyle's first experience of writing all the music for a
show, and it was a huge hit. The next significant production to involve
Doyle was John Byrne's The Slab Boys, in which he played Hector (and
which led to his bit-part in Byrne's Tutti Frutti -- as the engineer in
the hilarious episode where The Majestics try to record their silver
anniversary album).
The Slab Boys took him down to London where he launched himself into
the actor's life -- trailing around casting agencies, doing voice-overs,
playing piano in restaurants. But by 1987, the thrill had gone from
acting. ''I had just finished a TV series called The Monocled Mutineer
and it had been a success, but I thought: 'The bigger these parts get,
the less satisfied I feel'. I was about to give up acting completely,
but I didn't know what to do next. Then I got a call from a man called
Kenneth Branagh.''
Branagh knew of Doyle through John Sessions, with whom Doyle had
struck up a friendship. Sessions -- who had heard Doyle doing pastiches
of Mozart pieces -- had suggested him as musical director for Branagh's
planned production of Twelfth Night, to be staged by his Renaissance
Theatre Company.
First choice for the part had been Paul McCartney, but he was too
busy. He did, however, volunteer a completed song -- Once Upon a Long
Ago -- on which Doyle based Come Away Death, and which justified the
billing of ''Music by Patrick Doyle and Paul McCartney''.
Twelfth Night won the Renaissance rave reviews, and earned Doyle
employment as actor and musical director for three of the company's
touring Shakespeare productions. Increasingly, Doyle got more of a buzz
out of the musical side of his contracts, and he decided again to give
up acting. He pestered Branagh for the chance to score the Renaissance
Film Company's first venture, Henry V.
Branagh, a first-time director, was understandably nervous, but agreed
to let Doyle audition; giving him a budget of #200,000 to produce three
sample pieces. As Doyle says: ''I got the gig.'' And the rest is
history. He won the Ivor Novello award for the music, and the
specially-written Non Nobis has become the most popular hymn for
graduation ceremonies in America. Bye bye Gaudeamus Igitur.
Surprisingly, Branagh's instructions for the Henry V music required
Doyle to look at 1940s film noir since the director wanted to play up
the thriller aspects of the plot. This was to be combined with a Land of
Hope and Glory-type of jingoism. Doyle realised that the seeds for an
entire score could lie in one idea.
''It's amazing how much can come out of a basic theme. Look at
Beethoven's Fifth . . . What's different about composing for film is
that it's a much more dramatic form of writing because it addresses
drama, and you require to be very disciplined in terms of how long you
time the music. Personally, I enjoy having a set of parameters to work
to. People ask if I feel that I'm restricted because I only write a
two-minute piece of music, but I say No, because that's all that's
required.
''I mean, an opera has to end sometime: there's a finite length for
everything. Even The Ring eventually ends. The thing to remember is that
the music, while addressing the film, should ultimately stand up as a
work on its own.''
And Doyle's film music clearly does stand up on its own. Hence the
Royal SNO gig, which will feature a selection of scores from some of the
14 films he has worked on, including that of Branagh's recent
Frankenstein. By coincidence, when Doyle was working on that score, he
was instructed by his Sony bosses to bear in mind the possibility of a
Frankenstein Suite for performance in concert halls.
And he has been given the same brief for his current project -- the
score for director Ang (The Wedding Banquet) Lee's version of Sense and
Sensibility (starring and scripted by Emma Thompson). So we can maybe
expect to hear the Sense and Sensibility Suite in future Royal SNO prom
programmes?
* The Royal SNO's Evening at the Movies takes place at 7.30pm next
Tuesday at the Royal Concert Hall. Patrick Doyle will make a personal
appearance after a screening of Frankenstein at the GFT this Saturday at
2pm.

PERMIT me to reply to John Macleod's article, The farce of token
religion (June 20).
The farce, I believe, is in John Macleod's imagination and
misunderstanding of the facts. First, the ''Mosquing of the city'' is
not instead of the ''Kirkin' of the city'' but is complementing the
annual service at Glasgow Cathedral with the Rev Bill Morris and the
annual Civic Mass celebrated by Cardinal Winning, which have both taken
place.
Secondly, the suggestion of the ''mosquing'' is not the ''brilliant
wheeze'' (as stated by John Macleod) of Councillor McFadden but the
suggestion of Councillor Bashir Mann, Chair of Strathclyde Community
Relations, to Councillor McFadden, our Convener, and yes there are at
least four councillors known to me who practise Islam, without even
considering how many councillors represent significant communities who
also practise Islam.
So there is no ''sudden lurch from established custom'', as suggested,
but more a welcome awakening, that Glasgow is happily a multi-cultural,
multi-faith city, which we as elected councillors not only represent but
serve in public duty.
Thirdly, I don't find the tone of John Macleod's article in the spirit
of tolerance or understanding that I believe was taught by Jesus Christ.
Those who have religion of whatever faith have more in common with each
other than those who don't. Which category does John Macleod fall into?
Finally, may I say that so few people believe in anything these days,
that I think you should respect belief wherever you find it.

JOHN MACLEOD is really one of the worst kind of religious paranoids.
The very thing he accuses other religions of -- a fundamentalist
contempt of other's beliefs -- is the very thing of which he is most
adept practioner. That self-righteous pomposity can barely conceal his
bilious hatred of other people and their faiths.
Before treating us to his glib rantings on the moral barbarity of
Islam he might want to consider the atrocity, cruelty, and acts of
genocide committed in the name of his true faith.
His tortured justification of the historical Protestant basis of this
country might sit well as some arcane religious discourse in some parts
of the country but is hardly relevant for an increasingly secular,
modern Scotland. Perhaps he would do well to re-learn the Christian
message of humility.
As a militant atheist, all I can say is God save us from such Holy
Willies!

I WROTE to the Secretary of State for Transport, Dr Brian Mawhinney,
about the proposed closure of the sleeper and motorail services to Fort
William.
I received a reply from OPRAF (the Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising). The Minister thereby avoided answering any of my questions
and ''value for money'' featured largely in the response.
However, I was informed that certain services would now be
''safeguarded for the first time''. I find it most reassuring to know
that some trains will run between London and Glasgow and Edinburgh.
I suppose that even the franchise director knows there might be some
profit in services to Scotland's largest city and its capital.
Aberdeen does have some financial significance in the UK economy and
I'm sure the Government does not want the offshore oil platforms to
declare their independence.
But what does Inverness have to warrant a guarantee of rail services?
I am sure it is a big mistake wasting taxpayers' money on encouraging
travel and transport to a town that is over 150 miles from Edinburgh and
600 from London.
Fort William and Oban are not, of course, included. The profits to
future shareholders are far more important than the jobs and well-being
of all Scots living north and west of Glasgow.
The Highlands have been cleared before to make way for sheep. No
reason why they should not clear themselves again and make way for
trees. Who wants people anyway?
It is reassuring to know the Minister has his priorities right.

EVEN stranger dispatches arrive from Skye (June 13). Now John Bidwell
admits that the MacCrimmons were merely a fairy story and the ''legend''
was a fantasy all along. Perhaps he should rename his place of business:
''The MacCrimmon Jape Centre, incorporating the Phineas T Barnum (Son of
Skye) Publicity Stunt College.''
Until I published a book on the subject in 1980 the MacCrimmon
''legend'' was our holiest cow with a genealogy giving years of birth
and death in an unbroken line for 300 years.
The ''legend'' also unequivocally stated that the MacCrimmons were the
greatest pipers, teachers, and composers the world has ever known, and
ran a piping college at Borreraig where clan chiefs sent their best
pipers for seven years' tuition, and so forth.
There they invented and composed the finest pibrochs (and I do wish
that both the Pibroch Society and Mr Bidwell would drop the word
''piobaireachd'' in the interests of credibility) again which the world
has ever heard.
Except this is where the real MacCrimmon ''gift'' is exposed --
kleptomania -- as almost all their famous tunes had earlier and
different names.
And this is where the fantasy turns ugly. Even the tragic Lament for
Culloden (Couloddin's Lament) was stolen and renamed as part of the
scam. The tune was of no account to the MacLeods of Dunvegan who, with
the MacDonalds of Sleat, committed acts of genocide on the Jacobite
survivors and their defenceless families after Culloden to ingratiate
themselves with their commander, ''The Butcher'', whose wrath they
feared.
The MacLeods had already run away at Inverurie and Moy (same piper),
and when the Jacobite pipers were heard at Inverness again they fled
across the Firth and refused to return despite Cumberland's explicit
orders.
Instead they hurried back to Skye, only returning to the mainland
after Culloden to commit atrocities on their fellow-Highlanders in the
hunt for the prince and the ''#30,000 of English gold'' on his head.
Anywhere that a piper was involved the fabricators stole the story and
the pibroch and claimed the piper was a MacCrimmon. The piper at
Worcester, so airily mentioned by Mr Bidwell, was thus supposed to be
Patrick Mor MacCrimmon, specified to have been given a kiss of the
King's hand and to have written a spontaneous pibroch.
About 250 years later an eyewitness account turned up showing the
incident took place at Stirling and the piper had a different name.

I THINK your critic was at a different concert from me on Saturday,
June 17. My party of three and all of those around us enjoyed Jose
Carreras singing, together with the wonderful atmosphere of the whole
occasion at Gleneagles.
It was innovative and bold in concept and superbly organised if people
arrived in good time. It was hardly the organisers' fault if people were
late arriving.
The sound system was more than adequate and the orchestra and soprano
(who I admit did look chilly) were a delight as was the unmentioned
firework display. I feel sorry for Conrad Wilson is he can't really
enjoy such a unique event.

Usually when John Major backs someone to the hilt they end up sinking.
In the case of Shell, Brent Spar has stayed afloat! As chance would have
it the controversy over Brent Spar blew up as we reached the twentieth
anniversary of the first landing of North Sea oil.
The oil industry must forgive us if Scotland's enthusiasm for the
industry is tempered by a degree of cynicism about the extent of the
lost opportunities of these two decades.
Vast fortunes have been accumulated for both the Exchequer and for the
leading companies. One hundred thousand million pounds of revenues -- or
20,000 quid a head for every man, woman, and child in this country --
has flowed direct from Scottish waters and bankrolled successive Tory
Governments.
In return pip-squeak Tory back benchers jump up at Scottish Questions
and tell us that we really are a subsidised bunch of loafers who should
be grateful for the munificence of Her Majesty's Treasury!
The leading oil companies have done almost as well -- particularly
those, like Shell, who were in at the start and participated in the
first four ''golden rounds'' of North Sea licencing.
Of course Scotland has had the direct benefit of tens of thousands of
jobs, but the hard fact is that there are still many more oil and gas
jobs in London than there are in Aberdeen.
And, although there is at least another half-century of huge
production to come from the waters around Scotland, technology will
dictate that even while oil and gas production is rising the number of
front-end jobs will decline. What
will not be in decline are the highly skilled and highly paid backroom
jobs which, despite an encouraging trend in some companies towards
Aberdeen, are still focused on London.
So indeed are the lobbying and ancillary jobs which will remain in
London as long as political control of the industry remains at
Westminster. One such London-based job is that of Andrew Searle,
director of the UK Offshore Operators Association.
When I last wrote in this column about Brent Spar a month ago Mr
Searle immediately went in to bat for one of his most significant client
companies. He accused me of the ''selective use and misuse of facts'',
although I took some professional comfort from his description of my
''misleading'' as a ''classic example'' of the genre. I'm not sure of
which facts I was meant to be misusing. However, in the weeks that have
followed I am very sure that my reading of the public mood is rather
more accurate than that of either Mr Searle or that of the Shell Oil
Company. My basic position is very simple. Every oil and gas field which
has been developed in the North Sea had built into the field
calculations the assumption of abandonment and total removal.
Therefore for that not to be done is a breach of the original
understanding on which oil companies were allowed to exploit the riches
in Scottish waters.
It may very well be that there are a number of installations and
platforms which it may be impossible or unwise completely to remove and
recycle. It might even be, although this is now highly debatable, that
Brent Spar is one of them.
However, what is unsustainable is the industry argument that the best
people to judge what procedure should be followed are Shell Oil and the
UK Government, both of whom have a financial interest in deep-water
disposal against onshore decommissioning.
On Shell's own estimates the gap between deep-water disposal and the
onshore option for Brent Spar was around #33m. Gross that up for the
other 50 or so installations which may come into a similar category and
we have a tidy sum.
Assuming an average of 60% tax relief on decommissioning costs then
the precedent being set by Brent Spar could be worth hundreds of
millions to the oil companies and a billion or more to the Government.
If there is to be public confidence in this process what we require is
an independent body to evaluate the options, working on the premise of
total removal and land-based decommissioning, but allowing the companies
to put forward an alternative case.
It has already been demonstrated that information which could have
been considered inconvenient to the Shell/Government proposal somehow
did not find its way into the published Brent Spar Abandonment Report.
It is totally absurd to argue that we should have confidence in a
Government with a clear financial interest and a Prime Minister who
demonstrated yesterday that, such is his command of this subject, that
he doesn't even know the difference between a drilling rig and a
production platform.
Greenpeace have focused attention on a matter which should long before
now have been one of considered and public debate. They have won a
famous victory. This was done through concentrating the mind of Shell by
hitting them where it hurts -- in the pocket and at the pumps.
From now on a touch more gratitude and a tad more humility might be in
order from Mr Searle and the rest of the oil industry. Most countries
which discover oil and gas in substantial quantities end up filthy rich.
There is no reason for Scotland to end up just filthy.

THE Rev Maxwell Craig opines as if he speaks for us all in matters
spiritual, when in fact he speaks only in his capacity as general
secretary of Action of Churches Together in Scotland (June 13).
Moreover in his letter he fails to take cognisance that there are
many, (perhaps the majority) who wish to remain faithful to the
Doctrines of Grace, and to remain absolutely presbyterian in worship and
government.

IF you have an intractable boil there is not much point in messing
around with creams and lotions. What you should do is take something
sharp to it. Labour, at long last and really far too late, have sliced
into the mess which they allowed to happen in Monklands District
Council. The result will be cathartic and painful, but perhaps
ultimately healing. One of the crucial questions which the party must
address is why they failed to take drastic action when the poisonous
ailment affecting the Labour Party and the conduct of the council in
Monklands was first brought to their notice. We know an inquiry was held
and Mr Robertson is right when he says that its conclusions were
published in 1993. That much is not in dispute, but it avoids the
question of why nothing even remotely effective was done to cleanse the
situation. It was clear that power was held in too few hands and that
new procedures were needed within the party. It was equally clear that
councillors were too involved in the appointment of council employees.
It should have been clear that the cure recommended by Labour's inquiry
was unlikely to work and it is subsequently clear that nobody appears to
have bothered to monitor the situation to see if any improvement was
effected.
In the event we know that there was no improvement, at least as far as
Professor Black can discover. Labour's Scottish general secretary
accuses his political rivals of being pathetic, but that description can
best be applied to his own justification for the failure to take
effective action. It is simply unbelievable that the wider Labour
leadership did not know what was going on in Monklands. In all other
respects Labour has shown itself willing to twist arms in order to
restore party discipline. If proof of this were needed Militant members
can show their bruises. Somehow Monklands was sacrosanct, and the Labour
Party in Scotland cannot duck that fact.
The ducking appears to have ended last night, and that at least is
good news. The decision to suspend all of Labour's Monklands councillors
pending further inquiries by a national officer into the conduct of each
one is precisely the decisive action which should have been taken years
ago. It has the added advantage of showing the Government how to deal
with allegations of wrongdoing. Mr Major, who was so eloquently shocked
at the Monklands affair in the Commons yesterday, is much more of an
ointment-and-bandage man himself. Several of his own party have enjoyed
his unqualified support long after their iniquities were obvious to
everyone else and it is somewhat hypocritical of him to wag his finger.
If Labour has made a decent stab, if belatedly, at resolving this
affair, there are other worries not far down the line. Allegations of
other wrongdoings by Labour councils in Scotland have been common
currency for some time. None of these allegations has been presented to
the proper authorities, but Labour must make sure that it has its own
house in order.  Suspending the Monklands councillors is a good start;
further problems must be dealt with in a similarly vigorous manner.

WHY are women criminals so much worse than men -- at least in the
public imagination? Some of the most notorious cases (the Madeleine
Smith trial, the child-killer Mary Bell, and Edith Thompson, who was
accused of conspiring to kill her husband) involved women. Even Lady
Macbeth always seemed nastier than her feckless husband.The motives of
Ruth Ellis and Beverly Allit continue to fascinate.
It is now 30 years since the Moors Murders and yet Myra Hindley (not
Ian Brady) remains a symbol of revulsion and condemnation. So why are
women deemed worse than men?
Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in Britain, shocked the public
when she appeared on the witness stand in a fur coat and with bleached
hair.
''Feminists have since argued that one of the reasons Ellis was sent
to the gallows was that, in the eyes of the all-male jury, her
appearance did not match the line of her defence,'' says Helen Birch,
editor of Moving Targets, Women, Murder and Representation (Virago
Books).
At her trial, Myra Hindley had full make-up and newly-peroxided hair.
According to Birch, Hindley also appeared ''remorseless, unrepentant and
certainly not a victim''.
However, recent research has shown the notion that the courts
discriminate against women is a myth. Court statistics show that for
most crimes women are much less likely to be imprisoned than men.
So the idea that women are judged more harshly in the courts does not
bear scrutiny. For example, a 1991 survey showed that women first-time
offenders were half as likely to receive a custodial sentence as men.
But why is Hindley so much more reviled, in the popular press and the
public imagination, than Brady? Possibly it has something to do with the
fact that as a potential mother she committed such distasteful crimes
against children.
''Hindley's transgression is that she embodies and yet affronts the
idea of femininity,'' observes writer Beatrix Campbell. ''Why do we care
about Hindley and yet rarely remember Brady? Men who murder do not
surprise us. Murder, however mad, confirms their masculinity. Women who
kill and torture children are felt to be impossible -- the ultimate
transgressors.''
It is certainly true that higher standards are expected of women when
it comes to the care of children: Hindley betrayed her sex. Women who
show the ability to kill or a propensity for violence, transgress social
and gender norms and are supremely threatening to both men and other
women.
The famous Hindley mugshot, showing a peroxided 22-year-old Medusa,
has become an icon of evil. This status has been helped by a dearth of
in-focus photographs of Hindley either before or since her imprisonment.
Hindley's reputation has been greatly distorted over the years, thanks
to the speculation of journalists and memoirs of those who have come
into contact with her. Hindley has become a mythic figure -- indeed,
having lived most of her life in prison, she is now the longest-serving
female prisoner of recent legal history.
In Moving Targets Helen Birch has written a chapter on the famous
Hindley mugshot. ''That image has become symbolic of the threat of
femininity unleashed from its traditional bonds of goodness, tenderness,
nurturance. It strikes at the heart of our fears about unruly women.
''Hindley has become a scapegoat for some of society's greatest
anxieties -- through her, moral panics have a register,'' writes Birch.
''Hindley became a kind of tragic anti-heroine; the victim of a sick,
clever male mind. Her active desire to gain eventual freedom is cited as
evidence of her lack of genuine remorse. Of course, women have always
killed children -- their own. But women who kill other women's children
are somehow inhuman.
''Brady did the decent thing, he went mad. He wants to stay locked up.
Hindley did the unforgivable, she appeared to stay sane and wants to be
let out.''
''I think that the rarity of the female offender makes her appear
worse than men in the public mind,'' says Dr Loraine Gelsthorpe, of the
Institute of Criminology at Cambridge University. ''A woman offender is
out of place in the courts -- so there is a tendency to think that those
women who do offend must be especially 'bad'.''
In the popular culture, women often tend to fare less well than men.
In TV and film presentations (Prisoner Cell Block H, and Caged Heat for
example) women prisoners are depicted as being mad, bad and beyond hope.
By contrast, men in prison are shown (in the TV sitcom Porridge, or the
recent Oscar-nominated film The Shawshank Redemption) as lovable lads
with hearts of gold.
''Why, indeed, do (TV producers) persist in portraying men and women
so very differently? The reality is that prisons for men and women both
have 'tough' offenders, and those who have had a tough deal in life,''
says Dr Gelsthorpe.
''The Prison Reform Trust's report Identikit Picture gives a true
indication of the situation in prison. The jolly, lovable prison lag of
Porridge is not generally very close to the truth, but neither is the
'hardened hussy' of Prisoner: Cell Block H.''

SOMEBODY is trying to sabotage the Scott Inquiry into arms to Iraq. Is
it an opponent of the Government or a Government supporter? In the light
of the Prime Minister's vehement characterisation yesterday of the leaks
as '' malicious'', the latter possibility may seem fanciful. It is not.
There are several very good reasons for Government supporters to leak
aspects of the draft report by Sir Richard Scott but they all centre on
the notion that, once a condemnation of a Government Minister has
escaped into the public domain, it loses the shock of immediate impact
on final publication day. When the complete report is produced it is
possible to say, airily, that those allegations are old ones and were
answered back in June. In the meantime, each leak is dealt with angrily
and contemptuously by those allegedly maligned. Thus, Mr Waldegrave
spoke yesterday of the continuing unfairness to him and Lord Trefgarne
denied that he, Mr Clark, or Mr Waldegrave had misled anyone. The
accusations are made, the denials are given, and the world moves on.
There is nothing new in the theory of pre-emptive strikes. They are
designed to draw the darts of the enemy before they can do any damage,
but in this case they risk not only harming the Scott Inquiry but
undermining the way in which our liberal democracy is run and hurting,
moreover, the faith placed in it by citizens.
It is possible of course that we are being too cynical here and that
the leaks from Sir Richard Scott's draft report come from a different
sort of source -- one concerned principally with damaging the Government
and its Ministers. On this way of reading things the pressure must be
kept on the Government with a steady drip of accusations, culminating in
the final report which will confirm them all. Psychologically this is a
daft way of going about such a dirty business. There may be a brief
attraction in the idea of doing the damage now in case the final report
accepts the arguments of the accused and changes its mind and
accusations. But if Sir Richard doesn't change his mind (and those leaks
that have been seen thus far suggest that he is in a fairly stern mood)
the effect of the final report will be dissipated if many of its
accusations have been read in newspapers weeks before. Lord Trefgarne
admitted as much yesterday and it is worth repeating his words. ''If you
go on drip feeding leaks no-one will pay any attention to the final
report once it is published'', he said. Quite.
The history of the Scott Inquiry has been bedevilled by attempts to
undermine the credibility of Sir Richard and the manner in which the
inquiry has been conducted. Many officials were genuinely shocked at
being required to give straight answers to straight questions. Their
traditional obfuscations were brushed aside and their yelps of painful
disbelief have been long and loud. Others have suggested that the
inquiry is not fair because those suspected of wrongdoing have not been
allowed legal representatives and the opportunity to cross-question
other witnesses. Nothing is clearer than that this sort of process would
have had the Scott Inquiry running long past the millennium and straight
into the sand. Last, but certainly not least, was the attempt by Lord
Howe to suggest that Sir Richard Scott was a decent fellow, but not one
privy to the way in which the precious British system of government
worked. By that, of course, he meant its tradition of dark secrets and
even darker corners. We should be infinitely relieved that Sir Richard,
whether or not he appreciates the deviousness of the Establishment, is
none the less determined to shine light into the darkness. His response
to the latest leaks is to insist that they will not affect the final
report in the slightest way. This is encouraging, but the final report
must not be delayed any longer than is absolutely necessary. To linger
is to give more opportunities for leaks which we must assume are
intended to undermine, either the report or the Government. It is not
acceptable that either should be targeted in this way and the final
version of the Scott Inquiry must be published with as much speed as is
humanly possible.

THEA MUSGROVE has a background of formidable accomplishment as a
composer and conductor. Long-time admirer LESLEY DUNCAN caught up with
her during a brief visit home
THEA MUSGRAVE is briefly back in her native Scotland -- though
Orcadians might dispute the fact. The composer has just spent the
weekend at the St Magnus Festival, where two of her works, including a
world premiere, were performed to acclaim. Today she receives an
honorary doctorate from Glasgow University.
Musgrave has been domiciled in the United States for almost a quarter
of a century. It shows in the southern drawl overlying her Anglo-Scots
accent. She lives in Virginia -- where her husband Peter Mark is general
director of the Virginia Opera -- and commutes regularly to New York to
teach in the City University at Queens College.
We talked in the tearoom of the Queen's Hall, Edinburgh, where
conductor Nicholas Kraemer had been rehearsing the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra for the St Magnus concerts. Now in her late sixties, Musgrave
remains an impressively attractive woman. With her tall presence and
long, humorous face, she exudes intelligence and authority without being
in any way daunting. Not knowing her background of formidable
accomplishment, no-one would guess she was a contemporary composer of
international stature.
The New Grove Dictionary of Women Composers is highly complimentary to
her, not only as a composer but as a conductor of opera and concert
music who has ''won international renown''. It talks of her ''capacity
for an intensely personal revitalisation, which recognises and
incorporates contemporary musical developments while clearly retaining a
personal, stylistic integrity.''
The road to such accolades started modestly with her first commission,
the Suite o' Bairnsangs, to poems by Maurice Lindsay. The young Musgrave
had actually embarked on a career in medicine at Edinburgh University
before switching to music, then studying with Hans Gal and the legendary
Nadia Boulanger in Paris.
The Bairnsangs, ranging from the rollicking to the tenderly melodic,
caught the fancy of many people, including this writer as a teenager.
Entranced by the Bairnsangs I approached Miss Musgrave in Troon to ask
how the music could be acquired. The suite had not yet been published
but she had a photocopy of her original manuscript made for me -- a
treasured possession and a kindness still appreciated.
Was her new oboe concerto, entitled Helios, written with any soloist
particularly in mind? ''You bet,'' says she, in transatlantic mode. It
is dedicated to Nicholas Daniel who played it on Saturday. Musgrave had
just heard the first run-through when we met, and pronounced herself
''thrilled'' -- as she is also about her honorary doctorate from Glasgow
University. She speaks warmly of Fred Rimmer and Robin Orr, former heads
of the university's music department.
She has many musical links with Glasgow, through the university's
McEwen Concerts, performances of her work by both the SNO/RSNO and the
BBC SSO, and of course her links with Scottish Opera.
Last summer she wrote a marimba concerto for the deaf Scottish
percussionist Evelyn Glennie. The piece was first played at the
Cheltenham Festival, where Musgrave's work has often been aired. ''She's
a wonderful artist and a remarkable young woman.''
Musgrave's orchestral and chamber music is performed widely in the US.
The New York City Opera, San Francisco Opera, and of course the Virginia
Opera, as well as other companies, have staged her works.
We spoke on the possible drawbacks of being a woman composer. Musgrave
says she has never let the fact that she is a woman be an issue --
''Music is about human beings, not about gender.'' She thinks that being
a woman composer is less of a problem in this country than in the States
and is becoming less of a problem there too. ''We're lucky to be alive
in the twentieth century,'' she muses. ''We have a little bit more
control over what we do.'' Today's women composers are also fortunate
not to be the first generation. In their grandparents' generation there
was Ethel Smyth. The next generation had Elisabeth Lutyens and Elizabeth
Maconchy. Musgrave says she herself has never been made to feel
extraordinary.
In spite of the demands on her time, Musgrave tries to come to Britain
every year. ''I like to keep in touch with friends. My mother and my
publisher are in London. Besides, I enjoy coming here. I just wish the
Atlantic were a little smaller.''

Khasavyurt, Tuesday
CHECHEN rebels released the remaining civilians they were holding
tonight after driving back into their breakaway homeland in a tense
conclusion to the hostage crisis in southern Russia.
The outcome appeared to be a clear victory for the Chechen rebels, led
by top field commander Shamil Basayev, and a humiliation for the Russian
leadership.
Tass news agency, citing the Interior Ministry in Dagestan, from where
the rebels travelled by convoy into Chechnya, said the remaining
civilians were released at 8.30pm in the village of Zandak.
A Russian government spokesman said 123 hostages, including nine MPs,
11 journalists, and seven drivers, had been released.
The procession of buses had earlier crossed the border to Zandak from
Dagestan, ending a tortuous journey home from Budennovsk, where the
rebels defied Russian authorities for five days by holding hundreds of
hostages inside a hospital.
When they left Budennovsk yesterday, under a deal worked out with the
Russian government, the rebels released most of those held in the
hospital.
However they took with them the hostages, some of whom had volunteered
to act as insurance for the rebels against a possible Russian trap.
Tass said that many of the civilians freed in Chechnya immediately
began travelling home.
Basayev gave the order for the convoy to move out of Dagestan into
Chechnya tonight only after a top Russian government official reaffirmed
safe passage pledges.
The convoy had stayed at a standstill near Khasavyurt in Dagestan for
most of the day while Basayev sought fresh assurances from the Russian
government that there would be no double-cross.
The guerrillas' final destination was Dargo, a rebel base in the
Chechen mountains taken by Russian forces earlier this month.
In other developments, officials reported progress at Chechen-Russian
peace talks in the Chechen capital of Grozny, hastily arranged as part
of a deal to end the Budennovsk crisis.
Sandor Meszaros, head of the Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) mission in Grozny, said the two sides had
agreed a framework for a three-day ceasefire and a gradual withdrawal of
Russian troops.
The ceasefire would start tomorrow, Meszaros said.
In Moscow, a security alert brought the sudden evacuation of the
Russian Government building on the banks of the Moskva river.
The emergency move highlighted the jumpiness of security officials
after the Chechens' strike against a soft target in Russia proper.
Tass said the evacuation was ordered after an anonymous telephone
caller warned of a bomb in the building, known as the White House.
Nothing was found in a search of the premises.
President Boris Yeltsin, upstaged politically by Prime Miister Viktor
Chernomyrdin who handled direct telephone negotiations with Basayev,
said a special meeting of the powerful Security Council would discuss
the crisis and determine who should carry the blame.
The Russian president, savaged by newspapers for his performance
during the crisis, also sent security council secretary Oleg Lobov to
Budennovsk to investigate.--Reuter.

A MAN who launched a commando-style flame-throwing attack on pupils at
his old school was convicted of attempted murder last night.
Garnet Bell, 46, aimed his home-made incinerator at students sitting
A-levels at Sullivan Upper Grammar School in Holywood, County Down.
A jury at Antrim Crown Court took one hour 35 minutes to reach its
verdict at the end of a seven-day trial.
Parents and some of his teenage victims smiled as Bell, an unemployed
electronics electrician, was found guilty of three charges of attempted
murder, three of causing grievous bodily harm, and one of arson.
Bell, a Sussex University drop-out and part-time stunt driver from
East Belfast, gave himself up to police in the Irish Republic 48 hours
after the attack in June last year.
He told police he held a grudge against the school because of
''inappropriate career guidance'' but he denied intending to kill any of
the pupils with his improvised flame-thrower -- two gallons of petrol
and paraffin attached to a converted fire extinguisher which had been
fitted with a special nozzle.
Thirty-one pupils were sitting their A-level French and technology
exams when Bell burst into the assembly hall and indiscriminately
sprayed them with flames.
Several pupils were burned, three of them badly.
He told the jury he did not mean them any harm. He was suffering
stress and had sleeping problems. At the time, he was taking
tranquillisers which he claimed had a dulling effect on him.
Bell harboured a 25-year grudge against the school, claiming it had
given him bad career advice and sex education. He also rowed with his
brother Leslie over their mother's will and, just after the
flame-thrower attack, set fire to his brother's home in the fishing port
of Portavogie, County Down.
He then crossed the border into the Irish Republic before surrendering
in Limerick.
Bell, bespectacled with thinning grey hair and wearing a dark tweed
jacket with open-necked shirt, sat impassively as the foreman of the
jury of 10 men and one woman announced the unanimous verdicts. He was
cleared of one arson charge.
Bell, who underwent psychiatric treatment at one stage, was a stunt
driver with a fascination for fire and used to stage shows driving an
old car through bales of burning hay.
He will be sentenced today.

THE Scottish Office has been accused of wasting time and money by
staging further ballots of new-town tenants to determine who they wish
to be their future landlords.
Councillor Catherine Craigie, the Labour leader of Cumbernauld and
Kilsyth District Council, said the recent ballot in East Kilbride showed
that tenants were overwhelmingly in favour of the district council
taking over their homes. The 98% vote had been ''a staggering success''
for the council.
In view of this and the earlier 85% vote by Glenrothes Development
Corporation tenants in favour of Kirkcaldy district, the Government
should now simply transfer the housing stock belonging to the other
three development corporations to the local councils, she said.
Councillor Craigie, who chaired Slant (Scottish Local Authorities with
New Towns) until last week, said: ''It is scandalous the amount of time
and money being wasted in the five new towns on this unnecessary
exercise when it is patently obvious that tenants in Scotland's 31,000
new-town homes have already made up their minds. Why won't the
Government listen?''
Slant has elected Mr Peter Johnston, an SNP councillor of West Lothian
district, as its new chairman.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
HEAVY gun and mortar fire erupted today on a ridge looming above the
Bosnian capital Sarajevo as the EU's new peace mediator began a new bid
to halt the war.
The fighting broke out on Debelo Brdo, a promontory controlling a key
Serb supply route. Bosnian government troops and rebel Serbs have
repeatedly fought over the area in recent weeks.
The city had been relatively quiet after a brief but intense gun
battle along the supply route on Sunday evening.
The road connects the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale with an
important Serb military base at Lukavica, south-west of Sarajevo.
Muslim-led government forces were said to have cut the road during a
massive weekend offensive intended to try to break the Bosnian Serb
stranglehold on the city. They pulled back after heavy fighting and the
Serbs now claim to be back in complete control.
''We have taken back everything that we lost,'' said one Serb official
today.
Meanwhile EU envoy Carl Bildt held talks with Bosnian government
leaders in the southern city of Mostar. He was accompanied by United
Nations envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg.
It was considered too dangerous for Bildt to travel to Sarajevo
because of the latest fighting.
The release of the last UN hostages held by the Bosnian Serbs has
provoked a minor flurry of diplomatic activity. France is leading
efforts to restart the peace process and thwart what it sees as a
renewed appetite for war on all sides.
Russian peace envoy Vitaly Churkin met Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic after long overnight talks with Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale.
His visit was the highest level official contact the Bosnian Serbs have
had for months with any of the five leading powers in the so-called
''Contact Group'' that is trying to bring peace to Bosnia.
Churkin said he had brought new peace proposals, but did not say what
they were.
UN relief officials said Bosnian government forces blocked four aid
convoys that would have taken the first food for nearly a month to the
hungry people in their own capital.
The government said the fighting near Sarajevo made the last leg of
the journey too dangerous. Aid workers said the trucks, carrying more
than 450 tonnes of food and fuel for both Serb and Bosnian government
communities, would try again tomorrow.
The airlift of supplies into Sarajevo was cut off more than 10 weeks
ago because the Bosnian Serbs have refused to guarantee its safety.
''This is more than twice as long as we have gone before without
air-lift supplies going into the city,'' said UN refugee spokesman Ron
Redmond.
Meanwhile, some of the British UN troops held hostage by the Bosnian
Serbs had an emotional reunion with their families tonight as they flew
into RAF Brize Norton.
The 22 Royal Royal Welch Fusiliers hugged and kissed their wives and
parents during a tearful greeting at the Oxfordshire airbase.
The Fusiliers, some of whom were told they might be shot if Nato
carried out more air strikes, then headed back to Wales in a convoy of
minibuses.
They now have 14 days' leave to relax before returning to their
peace-keeping duties in the war zone.--Reuter.

THIS is the timetable of events leading to today's about-turn on
disposal of the Brent Spar:
* May 1, 1995: Greenpeace activists occupy oil loading buoy Brent
Spar, 250 miles north east of Aberdeen, after DTI permit for Shell's
plan to dump it in deep water.
* May 12: Shell granted an injunction ordering activists off the
19-year-old platform, but Greenpeace says it will defy it.
* May 23: Greenpeace activists dislodged by Shell security men who
storm the rig. Some activists hide but are eventually discovered.
* June 8: Britain's Environment Secretary, John Gummer, criticised by
other European ministers at North Sea Protection Conference in Denmark
for granting permission for dumping.
* June 11: Towing operation begins -- after Greenpeace activists
dislodged from anchor chains. Jon Castle, who headed occupation,
skippers Greenpeace ship Altair shadowing Shell flotilla of two tugs and
three support vessels.
* June 16: German Premier Helmut Kohl confronts John Major at Group of
Seven meeting in Canada to protest at Britain's agreement for dumping,
but Major ''stands firm''. Two Greenpeace activists landed on Brent Spar
by helicopter which dodged spray from water cannons. Picketing of Shell
petrol stations in Britain echoes widespread boycotts in Germany. One
station in Hamburg firebombed and shots fired near another in Frankfurt.
* June 17: Shell forced to cancel Better Britain environmental awards
because of furore.
* June 19: Major tells the Commons: ''I have to say that I believe it
is the right way to dispose of Brent Spar . . . in the Atlantic in 6000
ft of water.''
* June 20: Shell backs down on deep-sea dumping decision -- less than
24 hours before Brent Spar is due to reach dumping ground.

SOCIAL workers have moved in to a home for the elderly in the
Highlands to look after the 21 residents following an investigation into
allegations of ill-treatment of them and sexual harassment of staff.
Owners of the Balmoral Lodge in the Ross-shire spa village of
Strathpeffer have been informed by Highland region that they are to be
stripped of their registration.
Social work managers moved in at the weekend following a private
meeting of the Registration Panel and gave Mr Bill Monaghan, his wife
Margaret, and son Paul the ultimatum: agree to social workers moving in
or we will move the residents out.
The social work move followed a police investigation at the large
stone house which can accommodate up to 28 residents.
A spokesman for Northern Constabulary said: ''A complaint has been
investigated by the police and nothing of a criminal nature was
revealed.''
Confirming the move at the weekend a spokesman for Highland region
said: ''At a private meeting of the registration panel, certain matters
relating to the suitability of those running the home were discussed and
the owners of Balmoral Lodge were notified of the decision to move to
deregistration. They have 14 days to show reason why this should not
happen.''
It is understood several of the staff of 20 have left or been
suspended recently and complaints from them led to the social work
investigation.
An insider said yesterday that the Monaghans had run Balmoral Lodge
for almost 10 years and were ''devastated'' by the allegations.
She said: ''The home is inspected by the council three or four times a
year and there has never been any trouble before. I know the Monaghans
intend to fight this all the way.
''Apart from the police, who found nothing, the social work department
have had all sorts of people like environmental health and even the fire
brigade in to inspect Balmoral Lodge.''
At the home, there was ''absolutely no comment'' from the Monaghan
family.

The president of the National
Union of Mineworkers, Mr Arthur Scargill, opened a new union war
yesterday when he announced that the NUM intended taking over the
breakway OILC union.
The audacious move by the NUM to take over the North Sea oil workers'
union brought forth a torrent of anger, especially from the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union. It will be taking the matter up with
the TUC.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEEU executive member for Scotland and chief oil
industry official, said the only way Mr Scargill could get away with it
would be by exploiting Tory employment laws.
''Arthur has probably lost his mind,'' he said. On reflection, he and
OILC probably deserved each other, he added.
Mr Harry McLevy, AEEU Scottish regional organiser, was equally
scathing. It was ironic, he said, that the Offshore Industry Liaison
Committee, which had never negotiated for oil workers as it had no
recognition agreements, wanted to join up with Mr Scargill, who in his
11 years as president had never negotiated on pay for colliers. ''Coal
and oil bosses must be quaking in their boots.''
Mr Scargill wrote to the AEEU earlier this month, saying that OILC had
expressed a wish to transfer engagements to the NUM and that the NUM was
disposed to accept, ''bearing in mind'' both organisations were involved
in the energy field. ''I trust you have no objection,'' he ended.
In reply, Mr Paul Gallagher, AEEU general secretary, pointed out that
OILC, set up in the wake of the 1988 Piper Aplha disaster, was in direct
opposition to TUC affiliated unions including the AEEU, GMB, MSF, and
T&amp;G with the ''sole objective and purpose'' of recruiting members from
those unions.
''We think it is an absolute disgrace that you could even raise this
issue in the light of your union's experience with a breakaway union.''

THIRTY-EIGHT Lewis schoolchildren narrowly escaped serious injury
yesterday as the bus in which they were travelling was engulfed in
flames.
The bus was on its way from Bayble School in Point to a sports
competition in Leurbost in the Lochs area, with the pupils, three
supervisory staff, and the driver aboard.
In the village of Sandwick, on the outskirts of Stornoway, the janitor
noticed smoke coming through the floor. The children were taken off the
bus as flames caught hold and, seconds later, the vehicle was ablaze.
Headmaster George Moody said: ''The two teachers and the janitor, Alec
Matheson, did a remarkable job, and the children themselves kept calm
and obeyed instructions. Thankfully, they all got out unharmed.''
One girl said: ''Our janny deserves the OBE. Flames were coming out of
a hole in the floor and he put his foot on it so we could get past
without being burned. But the bus was filling with smoke, and the last
girl out had a blackened face.
''We stood a little bit down the road and there were a few explosions
and the windows melted. The front tyres blew up.
''Then there was a big explosion and tremendous heat. If we had been
travelling another five minutes, we'd all have been roasted.''
Three fire engines attended the scene. The bus was destroyed.
Mr Neil Galbraith, director of education for Western Isles
IslandsCouncil, said: ''We are thankful that the children managed to
escape unharmed.
''But there will be an investigation of the incident and we will be
taking up the matter with the contractor, Lochs Motor Transport.''
Mr Roddy Dan Macdonald, who owns Lochs Motor Transport, said he had
never experienced anything like it in his 27 years of operation.
''Fortunately, the children escaped unharmed.
''The bus was tested in April and came out of the garage today after
engine repairs. We are still trying to find the cause of the fire but,
at the moment, it looks like an electrical fault,'' he said.

Far from occupying ivory towers, art students are coming down to earth
and using their talents in business and commerce, reports CLARE HENRY.
ART STUDENTS? Long-haired, weird Bohemians who live in an ivory tower?
How wrong this public perception is. In fact, even before they graduate
some have successfully worked outside in the big bad world.
More and more art students are learning to work in the marketplace,
collaborating with big business, obtaining technical advice and
financial assistance -- and, impressively, providing new ideas for
companies and clients of all sorts.
On Friday, Glasgow School of Art, currently celebrating its 150th
birthday, opens its doors to the public for the students' degree shows.
As director Dugald Cameron says: ''Universities merely announce lists of
graduates in philosophy, physics or whatever. They don't let the public
leaf through the exam papers. Our students have to put their work on
display for all to see.''
Cameron is keen to emphasise that 100 years on, one part of GSA is
still practising what it was originally set up for -- namely as a design
school to assist local manufacturers -- but nowadays with the benefit of
a fine arts and architecture context.
Certainly its product design engineering course Viva was impressive.
Over two days students made presentations to a high-powered audience of
industrialists at the Burrell.
Ken McAlpine from Psion, in London, was there for the second year
running, scooping up graduates. ''I gatecrashed last year's Viva and was
very impressed. The mix of skills is just what we're looking for.''
Andrew Lauder, who developed a portable phone combined with electronic
personal organiser, spent 10 weeks last summer on a placement and goes
to work for Psion on graduation.
The department has a track record for success. It now has a world
first: the 1995 product design show is on the Internet, so foreign
employers can surf through people and products. These include a project
from a group of students who came up with viable aluminium products for
Design Alloys, of Grangemouth. Managing director John Baddeley, who gave
them an open brief, told me he was delighted with the students'
response.
But what about the more esoteric world of painting and printmaking?
Painter Marcus Rosie is just one who has laid down his brushes in
exchange for a VDU and computer technology. His finals exhibition has
involved him with seven different firms.
Some disciplines, like printed textiles, interact with industry on a
regular basis. When Alan Shaw got the Smarts Bursary and the chance to
print his textile designs with Belford Prints, in Macclesfield, he used
his favourite image: football.
Now silver cups from the trophy room at Ibrox adorn fine silks and
lush velvets and blow-ups of old Chelsea programmes from the 1970s and
footballs adorn rainbow-coloured chiffon. .
Blair Millen, a figurative painter, is one of an increasing number of
students who work with young and old people throughout Strathclyde.
Jane Allan who runs the Artists in Schools projects says: ''We see a
huge difference in students who have taught. More and more schools are
asking for students and the scheme is growing all the time.''
When Susan Hall wanted a special twenty-first birthday present for her
daughter, she rang GSA's jewellery department. They suggested she speak
to Andrew Dunlop. ''She'd fancied a bracelet costing about #100,'' he
told me. ''But when we met I showed her some jewellery I was making
exploring fold forming, a method of working silver by hammering along
the edge so that it curves naturally.
''I did some sketches then and there and she decided on a silver
necklace. I'd done work for friends before, but never for an unknown
client.'' Hall, up from London working at the BBC, told me: ''I'm
absolutely thrilled and so is my daughter. The necklace is just
beautiful.''
As you might expect from an art school, there is the madcap side to
student-commerce interaction, like Lucy Bacon's ploy to turn her
obsession with Coronation Street into a research project for her Fine
Art finals.
It took a lots of persistent phone calls and faxes to get through to
one of TV's favourite soaps, but once she had her foot in the door,
three visits to Granada ensured a long chat with her hero Ken Barlow --
played by actor Bill Roach.
''My show is a monologue plus video loop of Ken saying, 'Now you're in
control,' '' says Bacon.
Chris Barrowman, from Printmaking, has also ploughed an unusual furrow
-- literally. He rented a field from a Dumfriesshire farmer, took
several metres of strong polythene, tractor tyres, fertilisers, oilseed
rape and rye grass; arranged his design in the shape of the Plough
constellation and waited for several months. After a process of removing
polythene and wheels, watering with nitrates and phosphates, he hired a
helicopter and a camera and prayed for sun. Result? Crop art.
If you're interested in seeing what art students are capable of, visit
one of the four degree shows.
* Glasgow and Dundee degree shows run from Friday until June 30;
Aberdeen and Edinburgh are running until June 26.

IN the black book of the German Greens, the name of Britain stands
very high. It is not only because for the past 16 years there has been a
rampantly capitalist government in London. It is also because Britain is
reckoned a dirty country.
Tourists think Britain dirty compared with the spick-and-span Federal
Republic. She is suspected of dirtying her neighbours by pouring out
pollutants into the sky, and now into the sea. Many Germans blame the
acid rain borne on westerly winds for the death of their forests. To
them Brent Spar is the last straw, and it has brought an extraordinary
outburst of indignation, even violence.
It is irrational, but the Green movement in Germany takes an
especially irrational form. It emerged in the late 1970s, has seen
frequent ups and downs, and embraces people and policies of many types.
It appeals more to the young than to the old, but its hard core is the
educated bourgeoisie of 30 or 40-something -- what we would call the
chattering classes.
A lot of them were radical students in the 1960s, when student
radicalism was far more widespread than in Britain. They have never
forgotten their experience, which was also of repression by the state,
far more severe than in Britain. They have sought to apply their
experience ever since, and along the way have recruited from new waves
of ideas, hopes, and lifestyles.
The ideology shared by all Greens is ecological. They want to conserve
resources and protect the environment. They mistrust modernism,
especially in the form of energy -- above all nuclear energy, but
evidently oil as well. They long for a simpler and less materialistic
way of life.
There are many moderate, reasonable Greens. But others go much
further, into an impassioned hatred of all technology, and a romantic
yearning to return to some kind of agrarian society, mixed up with vague
inklings of the purity of nature.
A dominant current is anti-militarism, but the movement has also lured
a rag-bag of malcontents and single-issue fanatics. They range from
natural food freaks to gay and lesbian liberationists, from militant
feminists to Marxists and anarchists. They even include, to the
embarrassment of the Green leadership, racists who want to preserve
Aryan ecological purity.
Most Western countries contain such groups, but only in Germany have
they all united into a party capable of exerting a powerful political
influence. Why should this be so? Peace campaigns, fed by the residue of
German war guilt and a revulsion against militarism, grew powerful
because of the country's exposed position on the front line against the
Soviet bloc until 1989.
The strength of ecological feeling arises from the fact that Germany
is a thickly populated, industrial country, with an incredibly neat
countryside, forests planted in rows and never a blade of grass out of
place. That awakens a sort of claustrophobia, and a wish for a more
natural nature.
Finally, there is disillusion with the same neatness in German
politics, and with older parties that have stayed too long in power and
compromised down the line with the corruptions of capitalism. Idealists
find the whole of society conformist and materialist. This has long been
true of Germany, and regularly produces more or less extreme romantic
reactions.
In short, all these people are looking for causes to fight, causes
which are often elusive, and Brent Spar has suddenly given them a highly
visible and symbolic one.
The violence may arise from the fact that the Greens are constantly
frustrated inside their own political system and can feel even more
frustrated about the political system of another country.
For politicians, it is a lucky break. They make gestures and allow the
idealists to let off steam, but leave foreigners to pick up the tab.

THE award-winning journalist who uncovered the Monklands affair said
yesterday that the inquiry had vindicated her work during a three-year
campaign.
Miss Eileen McAuley, who covered the story for the Airdrie and
Coatbridge Advertiser, the local weekly newspaper in Monklands, welcomed
the inquiry's findings and said they confirmed what she had known all
along -- that a jobs for the boys policy was operated by ruling Labour
councillors and that there was a spending imbalance in favour of
Coatbridge and against Airdrie.
However, Miss McAuley, 34, who won the Bank of Scotland Journalist of
the Year and Local Reporter of the Year awards in 1993, said the
newspaper's intention had not been to reveal alleged criminal
activities, which have been passed to the Crown Office.
''Criminality was never something we were seeking to expose,'' she
said. ''It was the abuse of power by councillors and their treatment of
the council as a personal employment service, and I will not gloat if
any criminal charges arise from this.''
Speaking in Hamilton, where she is now chief reporter with the
Lanarkshire World freesheet -- one of her previous newspaper's
stablemates -- she said: ''Obviously, I'm pleased that finally there has
been some vindication of the investigations that myself and the Airdrie
and Coatbridge Advertiser undertook. I'm pleased that, particularly on
the nepotism front, our claims were found to be valid.''
Miss McAuley, who was assisted in the campaign by the four ''rebel''
Labour councillors and others, also commented on the inquiry's finding
that, even excluding strategic projects, capital expenditure in
Coatbridge was 54% over the past five years, compared with 34% for
Airdrie.
''There was clearly an imbalance on the big projects, although a lot
of arguments about why they were sited in Coatbridge have some validity.
Where I think the council went wrong was that they didn't do anything to
correct the perception in Airdrie that people there were getting a raw
deal.''
Although the Monklands affair was recognised early as a ''big story''
and an interesting one to cover, she admitted the campaign was at times
very stressful for her and the then editor, Mr Graham Isdale, as
relations between the newspaper and council deteriorated.
''I would be a liar if I said I didn't enjoy it but I would also be
lying if I said it wasn't very pressurised and difficult at times. Being
persona non grata with the Labour Party was obviously a consequence and
on many occasions they were too keen to shoot the messenger and not
listen to the message.''
Another consequence of the campaign was legal action against Miss
McAuley and the newspaper by council leader Jim Brooks, which is
on-going, and the council's retaliatory withdrawal of advertising from
the newspaper.
Now enjoying a post which involves more editing than reporting, on a
newspaper less inclined to cover ''heavy'' stories such as the Monklands
affair, she said: ''I felt I wanted to distance myself from it a bit. It
had been heavy going for three years and it was good to step back after
being in the cauldron for so long, especially after the rancour of the
(Monklands East) by-election.''
Miss McAuley denied suggestions that her move last December after six
years with the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser was a political attempt
to get her off the scent of the Monklands story.
''I knew before I left that it was going to be perceived that way and
if that is the story certain people want to put about then so be it. As
far as I'm concerned, I got promotion and a nice pay rise. I'm happy
doing what I'm doing''
She was later critical of the Labour Party's Scottish executive and
said that, although the party now appeared to be taking a tough stance
against the councillors, she was very disappointed that its inquiry in
1992 had failed to get to the bottom of the allegations.
''At the end of the day, they side-stepped all the pertinent issues
and concentrated on the mechanics of how the Labour Party was run. I
feel that Labour missed an opportunity to nail this much earlier.''
She also criticised Monklands East MP Helen Liddell for her U-turn
during the by-election campaign when she had first dismissed the
allegations as ''tittle-tattle'' and then admitted there was an
unacceptable spending bias after gaining access to details of council
spending.
An honours graduate in modern and economic history of Glasgow
University, Miss McAuley was brought up in Uddingston and educated at
Notre Dame High School for Catholic girls in Glasgow. She is unmarried
and lives in Bothwell.
Describing herself as apolitical, she added: ''Everybody, particularly
in the Labour Party, assumes that I am vehemently anti-Labour. In fact,
if I was going to be described as anything it would be left-of-centre. I
would certainly support the vast majority of Labour's policies. But I
don't swear allegiance to any political party -- not even the SNP, who
many people thought I supported.''

STORAGE facilities for weapons-grade uranium were being offered by
Dounreay nuclear plant between 1989 and 1991, according to an Atomic
Energy Authority document sent to the US but never before released in
this country.
Anti-nuclear activists claimed yesterday this was a direct breach of
long-standing Government policy that all such material must be returned
to country of origin, in this case the US. However, the Atomic Energy
Authority at the plant insist it was proposing only temporary storage.
Since the 1950s, as part of its atoms-for-peace programme, the US has
provided peaceful nuclear technology to 43 other countries on condition
that they did not develop nuclear weapons. Part of this was the
provision of the highly-enriched uranium (HEU), weapons grade material,
to fuel the reactors.
After 1978, however, there was a change in policy. Foreign operators
were to be persuaded to stop using HEU and convert to low-enriched
uranium. If they did, the US would take back their HEU. In 1988, this
policy was changed again, with the US no longer accepting the HEU
without an environmental impact study, thus delaying the process.
At that time, Highland Regional Council was opposed to any nuclear
waste dumping, including the Nirex national nuclear waste repository
being sited at Dounreay. The Government, meanwhile, had always insisted
that any material coming to Dounreay for reprocessing had to be returned
to the country of origin, which the plant appeared to observe at the
time.
However, in a United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority paper entitled
Nuclear Sites Operations Capability of Dounreay Fuel Plants, written by
A J Scullion, product manager of Dounreay's fuel services in May 1994,
it states: ''During 1989 to 1991, AEA offered irradiated element storage
contracts to research reactor operators with immediate storage problems.
''This was seen at the time to allow sufficient time to resolve the US
off-site fuels policy but, alternatively, operators could take up an
option to have their elements reprocessed.''
According to an AEA spoksman yesterday, there had been no breach of
regulations because: ''At that time, what we were proposing was interim
storage until 1994 with the option of reprocessing, with the waste
finally being returned to the country of origin. This was not a secret
document. It was sent to the office of the Governor of South Carolina in
1994.''
Anti-nuclear campaigner Mrs Lorraine Mann, however, said yesterday:
''Whatever they say, it is quite clear they were offering storage but
were saying publicly they weren't. When I raised this at the time, I was
accused of scaremongering and lying.
''Now it is there in black and white. I don't know how often I have
been accused of scaremongering but it is all beginning to come out now.
''At the time the US wasn't keen on reprocessing but now after the DTI
and Dounreay's lobbying they are now looking at using Dounreay for
reprocessing this reactor material.
''This could mean thousands of nuclear fuel pins, the most dangerous
configuration of nuclear waste, coming to Dounreay, making it to all
intents and purposes a nuclear waste dump.''
Meanwhile, an independent expert on the links between radiation and
cancer warned yesterday that some of the radioactive particles found on
the seashore near Dounreay are so 'hot' they could kill an adult.
Nearly 150 radioactive metal particles, the size of sand-grains, have
been discovered over the past 10 years on the shore near the Caithness
nuclear site.
Dr Tom Wheldon, head of the department of radiation oncology at
Glasgow University's Beatson research laboratories, claimed that some of
the particles were emitting enough radiation to prove fatal if
swallowed.
''Any person lying on a beach on top of some of these hot-spots would
get quite a nasty burn,'' he said.

THE closure of Rutherglen Maternity Hospital is expected to be
confirmed by Greater Glasgow Health Board today, despite an extensive
campaign by community groups and unions to save it.
Opposition to the closure also came from the Victoria Infirmary NHS
Trust, which operates Rutherglen Maternity. It had claimed that the
financial savings of closure were minimal and also questioned the
medical reasons behind the shut-down.
Unison's regional officer, Mr Jim Devine, welcomed the fact that the
trust had opposed closure and hoped that it would combine with the
unions and community groups to continue the campaign.
''It's the first time we've had a trust responding with almost exactly
the same arguments as the trade unions,'' he said.
Mr Barry Small, chief executive of the Victoria Infirmary Trust,
confirmed yesterday that the trust had written to the health board
during its consultation period opposing the closure.
Its submission stated that Rutherglen Maternity was well placed for
its catchment area, had an excellent quality of service, and a perinatal
mortality rate below the national average and well below that of other
Glasgow maternity hospitals.
The main medical argument against Rutherglen is that it is a
stand-alone hospital and mothers would be better served at a maternity
unit attached to an acute hospital in case blood transfusions and other
specialist help were suddenly required.
Mr Small pointed out, however, that in its 18-year history, no mother
had died at the Rutherglen hospital.
As an alternative, the Victoria Trust suggested that a maternity unit
could be sited within the grounds of the Victoria Infirmary but there
are no indications that the board has accepted this.

SHELL'S dramatic decision to tow the Brent Spar oil platform back to
land for decommissioning rather than sink it, and the oily sludge and
chemicals on board to the bottom of the Atlantic, was celebrated last
night as a victory for the Green lobby's slick publicity machine.
While oil giant Shell maintains dumping the rig at sea still makes
environmental sense, the company has been forced to concede that it had
lost the battle for minds after failing to spell out effectively to both
the consumer and European governments the advantages of deep-water
disposal versus the more costly land disposal.
The battle for hearts was lost when Greenpeace activists and their
rainbow-striped ships took to the choppy northern waters seven weeks
ago.
Last night on board their ship the Solo, Greenpeace activists admitted
they were stunned but delighted at the U-turn. Away from the front line,
as Shell delivered its announcement at a press conference in London,
Greenpeace's Lord Melchett said the company had been forced to back down
because of the sheer strength of public feeling, not simply in Britain,
or indeed Europe, but world-wide.
The battle over the Brent Spar has involved both dramatic publicity
stunts and violent, direct action. Greenpeace activists, in customary
combative style, invaded the rig, only to be forcibly removed in the
full glare of the world's media.
The Brent Spar saga began on the sunny, spring afternoon of May 1,
when four Greenpeace climbers scaled the platform lying 118 miles
north-east of Shetland. That day the environmental group managed to get
12 activists on board the 14,500-tonne structure.
Television pictures of the hijacking were beamed around the world,
leaving Shell to issue lacklustre reassurances that dumping at sea was
safe -- and threats.
Greenpeace's operation involved activists from Britain, Germany,
Norway, France, and other European countries. For three weeks they lived
in daily fear that Shell would try to evict them in a daring raid. Those
fears were conveyed on a daily basis via ship-to-shore links to the
media.
With few legal means of evicting the protesters, the oil giant
eventually sought and received orders to evict Captain Greenpeace,
Jonathon Castle, and his colleagues. And Shell pressed ahead with its
original plan to bring the giant Stadive semi-submersible alongside.
A 15-strong squad of security men, sheriff officers, and police
stormed the installation in an early-morning raid. They were swung
aboard the Brent Spar's barricaded heli-deck by a crane from the
semi-submersible.
By the early hours of the following morning all the protesters,
including Castle, had been taken off and work began to prepare the
platform for its journey out to the Atlantic.
But last Friday the protesters were back again. Grainy television
pictures beamed in from far offshore, as the Brent Spar neared the
dumping sight, showed two activists chaining themselves to the defunct
oil installation while being hosed by high-pressure water jets.
As Shell attempted to discredit leaked reports that the oil
installation contained dangerous chemicals, it had become clear the
widespread media coverage of the off-shore drama had prompted public
disgust on shore.
At the weekend, protesters stood outside Shell petrol stations in the
Highlands. The message to the oil giant, spelled out on homemade
placards, was simple. ''Stop the dumping. Boycott Shell.''
The ad-hoc protest came after Friends of the Earth found an unexpected
ally in the owner of Shetland's only Shell filling station, following a
call for Shetlanders to boycott the company.
The filling station owner declared he was a Greenpeace supporter,
pointing out that although a prolonged boycott would hit franchisees
before Shell, he backed the boycotting consumers' stand.
It was a message which Shell has heard loud and clear on the
Continent, where the Royal Dutch/Shell group has seen itself portrayed
as putting profit first. Protest came not only from the Green lobby but
consumers with Deutschmarks, Krona, and Schillings, as well as European
governments and the pivotal Green parties.
Before yesterday's announcement, by Shell, things had already hotted
up in the political arena with several European countries following the
German lead.
With a vocal Green and church lobby on his back, Germany's Chancellor
Kohl set the ball rolling at the G7 summit in Halifax, Canada, with an
angry salvo directed at Prime Minister John Major.
In Sweden, the country's Environment Minister met with Shell
representatives to discuss a move she described as unacceptable.
Austria's Green party called on the country to boycott the company. It
said Austria should cancel all its business ties until there was an
''ecologically responsible disposal of the Brent Spar''.
The party's leader told a packed news conference in Vienna that civil
servants supplied with cars should be barred from filling them up at
Shell stations.
The Austrian call came simultaneously with a Danish Government demand
for the British Government to reconsider its sanctioning of the
controversial dumping.
The Danish Environment Minister had earlier described the dumping as
abominable and urged all Danish government agencies to boycott the
company. The plea was heeded by around 16 Dutch companies which
announced they were to boycott the company, followed by noises yesterday
from a leading Danish pharmaceutical company and a major pump
manufacturer that they were considering following suit.
Denmark's Prime Minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, declared the Brent
Spar's imminent sinking to a watery grave as ''unacceptable''. In a
hard-hitting statement, he echoed the concerns of the Green lobby and
consumers when he raised fears over the possible consequences of
scuttling rigs. ''We cannot passively look on while the Atlantic is
being turned into a cemetery for hundreds of platforms.''
He added, on a personal note, that he would not buy a drop of Shell
gas for either his car or his lawnmower.
Such sentiments had already struck a chord with European protesters
who were prepared not only to boycott Shell products but to set fire to
them.
On Saturday, protesters targeted a filling station in the German city
of Hamburg. After spray painting slogans, the attackers threw petrol
bombs through the sales window, destroying the building and causing a
major explosion.
Throwing bombs, hijacking a rig, and the threat of a biting consumer
boycott worked yesterday, but as Shell tempered its climbdown with a
statement justifying deep-water disposal it was clear the battle is
nowhere near resolved.
There are around 60 rigs in the North Sea waiting to be
decommissioned. The British Government has yet to agree the land
disposal, and the Shell publicity machine has yet to shift gear.

They came, they played, they conquered. reports on two young musical
stars who, along with their unique appearances, amazed Orkney with their
triumphant talent
WHATEVER the audiences at this year's St Magnus Festival in Orkney
remember of the events in a year or so, there will be one thing they
will not forget in a hurry. Or rather, two things -- a pair of
remarkable characters, the gentle giant and the dandy in denim: Truls
Mork and Jean-Yves Thibaudet.
They played separately, they played together. They always played
triumphantly. They drove writers into committing confident and conscious
apparent contradictions to print. The other day I wrote of them playing
with abandon and a buccaneering style while, at the same time, being in
absolute control. Together and separately, they produced some of the
finest playing I have ever heard at the St Magnus Festival.
You couldn't miss them on the island. Physically, they appeared the
antithesis of each other. Truls Mork, the fabulous cellist, is a giant:
stocky, a bear of a man with the face of a boy. Unusually pale of
complexion, and with liquid eyes, he loped softly around Kirkwall,
slightly stooped, encased in an enormous leather jacket whose size
suggested that its first owner must have been an outsize grizzly.
Onstage, even paler, and with a concentrated, faraway look in those
eyes -- eyes that wander unseeingly over the audience as he plays -- he
produced, first in Haydn's Cello Concerto with the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra, and then in his recital with Thibaudet, playing of such
consummate polish, such physical strength, and controlled poise like you
wouldn't believe, that he just has to be one of the best of his
generation.
Thibaudet cuts a different dash. He's like something out of another
century. Slender, slightly effete, flawlessly tanned, immaculately
coiffured, and exuding a very French sensuality, he floated around
Kirkwall looking every inch the male model in his stonewashed
designer-denim clothes, shades (always), lethally pointed shoes, and the
crimson pullover casually tied over his shoulders (never worn).
Onstage, le chic Monsieur Thibaudet drew gasps -- and not just for his
playing. No tux for this fashion-plate, no sirree. He comes on Versace'd
from head to foot, from his oh-so-casual slip-on shoes with their gold
buckles, and his red socks, to an array of spectacularly technicolour
ties. If his piano playing was merely a fashion accessory to his film
star appearance, he'd be written off as a poser; and, critically, he'd
be dead meat.
But, oh, can the man play; can he ever. Contrary to his looks, there
is not one ounce of affectation in his playing. He possesses an
astounding technique that is faultlessly wedded to a scrupulous
musicality and craftsmanship, and -- just like Truls Mork -- a control
that is breathtaking. That sense of control meant that, in his mesmeric
performances of Debussy's Book One Preludes, there was no trace of
wishy-washy impressionism: clouds of sound were cut with a rare clarity
of articulation.
And when he unleashed himself on the deep-purple warhorses of Liszt,
he redefined them in some of the most brilliant, unshowy virtuoso
playing I have heard in years.
In the magical Fountains of the Villa d'Este, Liszt was revealed as
the father of impressionism (which we might well know, but few pianists
depict). In the Second Ballade, a classic case of apparent Lisztian
bluster, Thibaudet unveiled a masterpiece of musical drama. And in case
you think by now he's just an intellectual pianist, he followed all of
this with a performance of Liszt's wondrous transcription of the
Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan that almost rivalled the original in its
evocation of swooning eroticism.
Almost unique playing, this. And a wee bird tells me that Jean-Yves
Thibaudet will be returning to the Royal Scottish National Orchestra
next season, possibly to play Rachmaninov. Mon dieu; book les tickets
fast. Thibaudet est magnifique -- vraiment.
From the cello man and the piano man to The Wildman. Nicola LeFanu's
new two-act opera -- The Wildman -- to a libretto by Kevin
Crossley-Holland (who has been the festival's resident poet, giving
readings in Kirkwall and Stromness), has been receiving its Scottish
premiere performances at St Magnus.
The opera -- a twelfth-century tale of a wild, animalistic,
speechless, uncivilised man caught in a fishing net and brought into a
village on the south-east coast of England -- opened just more than a
week ago at the Aldeburgh Festival before transferring to the Orkney
Arts Theatre. In a scenario vaguely reminiscent of Greystoke meets Peter
Grimes, the wildman -- the classic outsider -- is feared and ostracised
by the men of the village, while eliciting a seductive fascination in
some of the women.
Apparently the opera was trashed by the London critics. It's not a
great piece, though it's not that bad; there are coastal, atmospheric,
and shall we say mythical, parallels between Orkney and Aldeburgh that
quite possibly eluded the super-urbane London brethren. It's an opera
where appreciation is dependent on some sort of sympathetic
understanding with the type and level of legend and myth that permeate
the history of such places.
That said, The Wildman isn't a strong piece, dramatically. Running at
almost two-and-a-half hours, it's overwritten. Musically and
theatrically, LeFanu and Crossley-Holland have not written in enough
developmental substance to sustain and drive it over the stretch -- not
enough narrative thrust, too many musical drones, repetitions, and
oscillations. There is some effective instrumental writing for the
chamber ensemble (the Britten Sinfonia, which has a concert of its own
to come in the festival), and some ecstatically lyrical writing for the
singers, though their difficulty of having to play dual or multiple
roles is getting a hold on solid characterisation. Atmospheric and
mysterious, yes; dramatically, The Wildman is a bit thin.

NICKNAMES can be a problem. ''Wizz'' Jones reckons his, which dates
back to his school days and relates to a boyhood talent for conjuring
tricks rather than his guitar prowess, could even breach the Trades
Descriptions Act.
Such modesty. If, as he says, his guitar playing is limited, there
must be many guitarists out there who would like to achieve such
limitations. Wizz began his 35-year career as a true troubadour. Having
been inspired to take up guitar after seeing Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy
Waters, and fellow Glasgow International Folk Festival guest Ramblin'
Jack Elliott play in Soho in the late 1950s, he set out for Paris to
busk.
The first time he chickened out and had to be repatriated by the
British Consulate. But he went back. And back. Later he busked on
towards Morocco via Spain -- and here Wizz would like to set the record
straight.
Rod Stewart has claimed that he and Wizz got deported from Spain for
busking in the early sixties. It wasn't Wizz. They only played together
in London where Stewart, playing harmonica, would gatecrash Wizz's gigs.
While his impromptu partner went on to enjoy massive record sales,
Wizz had rather less success with a series of one-off albums for major
labels which sank without trace at the time.
''I missed out on the singer/songwriter boom because I wasn't writing
my own songs. I was always more inspired by other people's songs and
doing them my own way. It's a fear of failing.''
European audiences were appreciative, however, and to the detriment of
his visibility back home, Wizz lived off Germany's romance with acoustic
music for many years. When that market collapsed in the early 1980s he
got a job driving a furniture van, playing the occasional wine bar gig
with his son, flautist and saxophonist Simeon.
Then the furniture trade took a dip. Redundancy was a blessing in
disguise. Wizz picked up old contacts and, thanks to his excellent
Grapes of Life album, has been working steadily, although these days he
has difficulty booking Simeon, who keeps busy with Take That and Gary
Glitter among others.
Their Glasgow International Folk Festival concert together at the Tron
Theatre on Monday comes in the middle of Wizz's Scottish tour, which
starts at Glasgow's New Dawn Folk Club tomorrow, calling on Newport on
Tay (Friday), Dumfries (Saturday), Inverness (Sunday), Montrose
(Tuesday, June 27) and Irvine (Wednesday, June 28).
Not the most straightforward of schedules but no worse than Simeon's,
which involves two sets with two different bands on two different stages
at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday followed by a drive to Glasgow.
''Typical,'' says Wizz with fatherly resignation. ''We hardly get a
chance to play together and when we do he'll be cream crackered.''

STRIKE Up the Band, the title of last night's Royal SNO Prom, hosted
and conducted by the ebullient Sir William Southgate, proved to be an
umbrella term spanning just about every aspect of popular music from the
1920s to the 1960s.
A real mixed bag of a programme, the only obvious link between most of
the numbers played was that they were stained by the stamp that
Southgate's own arrangements had left on them. Hell, this guy managed to
make Porter dull and Berlin bland.
Part of the problem was the selection of numbers. Clearly, the choices
were very personal, but Southgate did Porter, Berlin, and Richard
Rodgers and their fans a huge disservice by representing them with such
non-favourites as he did.
Songs like Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and Heatwave don't
necessarily stand up on their own when they have been plucked from their
contexts, and don't always benefit from being performed without their
lyrics -- which, in the case of both Berlin and Porter who wrote their
own words, were an integral part of most songs.
The rest of the problem lay in the Southgate arrangements which were
-- with the exception of a South Pacific medley -- at best bland and
easy to listen to, and at worst so over-written and over-coloured that
they verged on the mickey-take.
The only number the Royal SNO really seemed to get their collective
teeth into was the encore of Alexander's Ragtime Band -- played in a New
Orleans style.

LABOUR called it a successful attempt to ''ventilate local party
democracy''. Critics called it a cover-up and claimed yesterday that
Labour's own investigation into the Monklands affair has now been proved
to be a whitewash.
For the Tories and the SNP, the announcement that the entire Monklands
Labour group has been suspended does not eclipse the fact that, two
years ago, Labour's Scottish executive did not address the key
allegations of nepotism, spending bias, and financial mismanagement in
its own Monklands inquiry.
Instead, the party admitted the council had left itself open to
criticism for the way staff were appointed and ordered a major shake-up
of local party operations.
Labour says it was misunderstood and that it was never its remit to
investigate the local authority, just the local party.
When it was published in March 1993, the 35-page report by the
Scottish executive did not mention a single councillor or party official
but talked in general terms about modernising outdated party procedures.
At the time, the party's clearest criticism was reserved for the local
newspaper, the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, which it accused of
''going beyond reasonable bounds'' in some of its coverage of the
Monklands affair.
Yesterday, Ms Anne McGuire, chairman of the Scottish Labour Party at
the time of the report, said its remit had always been to investigate
the operation of the local party and it did not have the authority to
examine the council.
''We didn't have the legal status to investigate the running of the
council, which is what Professor Black had,'' she said.
''That gave him access to information that we never had access to.
What we did have locus to do was investigate how the Labour group
operated. We found practices there that were unacceptable and these were
changed.''
Ms McGuire said she thought there may have been a misunderstanding
over the role of the Labour party inquiry.
''I think there was confusion over what the role of the Scottish
executive was and I regret that confusion. Our responsibilities are
clear and we delivered on that responsibility. We delivered on our
remit. If you speak to any of the party members in Monklands, we opened
up the party there.''
Ms McGuire said she welcomed Professor Black's report and the ''speedy
action'' of the party's national executive in suspending the Labour
group yesterday.
''We have consistently called for the Secretary of State to use his
powers to investigate Monklands District Council. We have consistently
called for those who have evidence of malpractice to deliver that
evidence to the appropriate authorities.
''That has been a consistent line of the Scottish executive and there
has never been any deviation,'' she said.
Tory and SNP officials, however, have demanded a public explanation
for the findings of Labour's initial inquiry.
''These allegations and concerns were known and along came the Labour
Party executive and said we will hold an inquiry and they held an
inquiry and they gave the impression that basically everything was
okay,'' said Scottish Tory Chairman Sir Michael Hirst.
''The fact is that, now Professor Black has confirmed that there was
substance in these allegations, it begs two questions. Why did the
Labour Party not find out that these things were wrong? And if they did
find out something wrong, did they conspire to whitewash the whole thing
in the ensuing period? Either way, the Labour Party is culpable.''
The Labour inquiry was launched in September 1992, after growing
public concern over the charges of bias, nepotiosm, and bigotry were
made by political opponents and dissident members of the ruling Labour
group. The report did find that claims of power being concentrated in a
few hands were largely justified and ordered all Labour organisations in
the district to adopt new rules.
The report's recommendations called for councillors to be involved
only in the appointment of senior officials; provosts and council
conveners should serve no more than two terms; and there should be a
more equitable distribution of committees among group members.
The key accusations of nepotism, spending bias, sectarianism, and
financial mismanagement were ignored. At the time, party officials
dismissed accusations that it was a whitewash and said the report and
its recommendations would help restore credibility and renew confidence
in the local party.
''If it was not their remit, then that's even worse,'' said Sir
Michael Hirst yesterday. ''They were then running away from what were
uncomfortable allegations. Either way, the Labour Party emerges from
this in a very weak and shamed way.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond was equally critical. He said: ''The reality
is that Labour have known for a number of years that something was
rotten in the state of Monklands but their behaviour has been that if it
can be brushed under the carpet, brush it under the carpet.
''We need to know what happened at the initial investigation. The
questions have to be asked what information was supplied. Was that
inaccurate? Was the inquiry misled or did the inquiry not ask the key
questions?''
Last night, Labour's Scottish general secretary, Mr Jack McConnell,
said his political rivals were being pathetic, adding: ''Because we made
it very clear, and everyone understands this, that the political party
can't get into a council and look at personnel files and call witnesses.
That has to be done by an independent legal body and that's what
Professor Black has done.
''I think the original Labour inquiry has been completely vindicated.
It changed the recruiting practices of the council and overhauled local
party organisation. We said at the time that all other allegations
should be referred to the proper authorities.''

We are talking dinosaur politics here, local party bossmanship that
can even intimidate MPs.
THE beatific face of Labour leader Tony Blair, smiling both on the
poor and the not so poor, is far removed from the unsavoury world of
local Labour Party politics as manifest in Monklands and several other
areas.
While at national level the party is wooing big business and the
institutions in a bid to sanitise the image of Socialism, at local level
many councils are influenced by a ward party structure dominated by a
few politically active families and interest groups with dubious
motives.
These families, who sometimes often comprise the entire membership of
a ward party, have tremendous local clout and are often in a position to
dictate who should get the party nomination at local elections.
It is not unknown for a nomination to be supported in exchange for a
commitment that the candidate, when elected, will channel council loans
and grants to local community groups which they also control.
Financial control and accountability is invariably lamentable and
amounts to a form of patronage that would strike a chord among our
exemplars in Parliament.
There are obviously difficulties with the membership system. These
chiefly arise because, for all the public noise that's created about the
rise in party membership, in urban areas with a high concentration of
population, party membership is woefully small.
What's more, it has always been the case that local party bosses,
councillors among them, see very good grounds for having small and
pliable party organisations, who don't get noised up and who don't
require much in the way of accountability.
You have a whole series of areas where this problem of minuscule
membership is endemic.
There are others where there are inflated memberships which don't
exist in terms of activity, and are merely bought in, either by sitting
councillors or local party king-makers.
In such areas the concept of ''New Labour'' is a sad joke.
We are talking dinosaur politics here, local party bossmanship that
can even intimidate MPs.Selection or deselection can often depend on
turning a blind eye to the questionable activities of local party
bosses.
Monklands may be in the headlines today, largely through the high
profile accorded it by the late Labour leader, John Smith.
However, other local areas have been the source of embarrassment to
the party nationally.More disturbingly, the party seems reluctant to
correct errant councils on the grounds of preserving local autonomy.
The Labour-run City of Dundee has, over the last two decades, become
synonymous with financial scandal.
Two prominent Labour figures were jailed following an investigation
into council contracts.
A second scandal emerged later regarding financial irregularities in
the running of Dundee's Labour Clubs.
In Glaagow, a ghastly housing scandal in the seventies resulted in two
leading city councillors being struck off the party's panel of
candidates.
In Dumbarton district, several councillors fell foul of the law over
expenses claims, while, more recently, Labour councillors in Motherwell
achieved notoriety because of their highly developed taste for foreign
travel at the local taxpayers' expense.
Bitter internecine warfare in Glasgow, Renfrew, Dumbarton, and
Kirkcaldy has brought the party into further disrepute.
Indeed, there is no hatred quite like it as when the comrades fall
out.
As one enemy of a leading Glasgow politician said of him recently: ''A
body bag riddled with bullets in George Square is too good for that
man.''
Comrades indeed.
Somewhere along the line, the ethic of public services among
councillors is subsumed by a drive for personal advancement which often
draws them into hideous personal and sectional conflicts with party
''colleagues''.
It all makes for a pretty shabby picture of the Labour Party at local
level.
The local government reorganisation to which the party has been so
strongly opposed could well turn out to be a Godsend.
It will give the party an opportunity to wipe the slate clean in
certain embarrassing areas and hopefully make a new beginning.

The bright young things who attend Royal Ascot these days can, it
seems, turn anyone's head but their own . . . those extravagant,
whimsical creations with which they adorn their crowns are not made for
nodding acquaintances, but to catch the limelight full in the face.
THERE are precious few chances in the average girl's life to flounce
about in fancy headgear, and not look like a complete headcase. One such
occasion is a wedding (but not if you're the bride). Another is if
you're in the school musical (especially if it's My Fair Lady).
Even in the anything-goes 1990s, hats are still almost exclusively the
preserve of the rich and the famous -- and the daft. Weddings and
fancy-dress parties aside, only celebs get invited to the kind of
occasion for which a crazy millinery creation resembling a (very untidy)
bird's nest would not only pass without causing hilarity, but would also
be considered absolutely essential, credibility-wise. If you walked down
your high street wearing such a confection, as some folk do, you would
look as out of place as a duchess in denims at the races. Taste and
elegance are as much about understanding how to dress for an occasion as
they are about the actual components of an individual outfit.
For as long as anyone can remember, Royal Ascot -- which started its
1995 season yesterday -- has not been as much a sporting event as a
fashion event. As such it brings out the luvvies and the loonies in
equal measure. And how do you tell the difference? By examining their
heads, of course. And you don't need to be a fashion doctor to know that
there's a fine line between making a stylish sartorial statement and
looking like a mad hatter. The concept of wearing a cabbage on one's
bonce may sound like the deranged fantasy of some fruit and veg
fetishist who has overdosed on Carmen Miranda films, but -- as designer
Phillip Treacey shows -- even a cabbage has its charms when it's set
amongst huge floppy petals, and placed on the head of a simply-clad
model.
Ascot has become the milliners' answer to the Paris shows. The more
outlandish the creation, the more likely it is to be photographed and
end up on the news pages of the press. Celebrities wearing conservative
colours and staid or safe styles find themselves being overlooked in
favour of ''Cindy from London'' or ''Avril from Warrington''. While
Euro-chicks make their desperate bids for stardom by peeling off the
layers for the benefit of the slavering paparazzi on the promenades of
Cannes, the more sophisticated Ascot gazelle seeks her 15 seconds-worth
of fame by fixing herself up with a frothily-fashioned chapeau of
preposterous proportions in which she will nonchalantly parade about
until some photographer just happens to stop her and ask to take her
picture
This is one occasion when ordinary punters -- in photogenic bonnets,
of course -- have a better chance of getting their faces plastered
across front pages of the next day's papers than members of the Royal
Family. Let's face it, if you've seen one of the Queen's hats, you've
seen them all.
The aim for many, however, is not to be discovered (whoever remembers
the names of Ascot belles?), but simply to have a reason to dress up and
have a good time. And maybe even watch a few horses . . .

There could be a very long furrow to plough before enough hard
evidence is gathered.
THE next move in the investigation of allegations of criminal conduct
in the affair, as opposed to the parallel allegations of malpractice,
financial imbalance on religious grounds, and nepotism, lie with the
Crown Office in Edinburgh.
It emerged yesterday that the Crown Office had in its possession all
the allegations uncovered by Professor Black as well as further papers
on allegations made to Strathclyde Police Fraud Squad, based in Glasgow.
The whole picture has yet to be examined by Crown counsel who would
then recommend a way forward. The initial feedback yesterday, however,
tended to reveal a mishmash of gossip, unsubstantiated rumour, innuendo,
and hearsay, rather than substantive evidence that would stand a chance
of reaching court.
The reality is that there could be a very long and hard furrow to
plough before enough hard evidence is gathered which could convict
anyone -- despite the fact that half the people of Airdrie and
Coatbridge are now saying: ''We all knew it was going on.''
It was also emerging that most areas of alleged criminality were those
touched on by Professor Black at various points in his report.
Among the points which fraud squad detectives will have to investigate
in the coming months are allegations against specific councillors that
repairs, extensions, alterations, and maintenance were carried out on
their houses by council workmen. Professor Black specifically mentioned
such work as not being a legitimate council responsibility. He did no
further investigation because it was outwith his remit, reporting the
allegations instead to the Crown.
Allegations have also apparently been made that specific councillors
used their seniority in the Labour Party to coerce or bully employees,
many of whom had originally secured their jobs by becoming Labour Party
members, into carrying out this work. It is believed that four
councillors have been named in this connection.
Further claims have apparently been made that council houses could be
secured by the payment of a bribe to certain councillors. One source
told The Herald that the favoured method involved the councillor
entering a club and hanging up his coat, to find on leaving that a brown
envelope had been placed in the pocket of the jacket while he was at the
bar.
Another allegation reportedly made to the police involves the sum of
#5000 allegedly handed over to a councillor in order to secure planning
permission. Yet another allegation involving taxi licence fees has
already been investigated and information passed to the
procurator-fiscal at Airdrie who has yet to indicate whether further
action is to be taken.
At least the Scottish National Party emerges from the mess with
credit, its two elected members having first identified the alleged
racketeering as long ago as 1989 when they resigned from the Staffing
and Rota Committee which appointed employees. They quit because of the
blatant ''jobs for the boys'' policy being operated none too subtly,
according to one of that pair, Councillor Graham Russell.
His colleague, Councillor Neil Douglas, said yesterday that if there
was any collective decency among the Labour group, they should resign en
masse because ''with their thick skins and brass necks they have for
years thumbed their noses at democracy, dragging the good name of the
people of Monklands through the mud''.
He believes that a Scottish Office inquiry should be created, looking
back as far as the inception of the council and into the activities of
past councillors, some of whom had attained high Labour office.
He said scores of people had come to him in his three years as a
councillor; some of them had been employees of the district council and
their relatives, fearful and intimidated by the machinations of the
council. They had even been too fearful to give evidence to Professor
Black's inquiry because it had been sited at the council headquarters.
''The whole Labour Party has to be lambasted for this sordid affair,
including, sadly, the late John Smith, although I held the man in the
highest regard, and still hold his memory in the highest regard. I
approached him with these allegations some time shortly before his
death. He had known about these allegations for years.''

Political Editor, Geoffrey Parkhouse describes how leaks of some sort
have embarrassed Prime Ministers down the years.
THE Prime Minister called the latest one ''malicious'' yesterday. Most
of his predecessors -- Labour or Tory -- have used the same word when a
leak of information has embarrassed them, thwarted them or exposed them.
All Prime Ministers, I repeat all, like to control the flow of
information, rather than be controlled by it.
The wretched media, newspapers and broadcasting, the so-called whores
of the Fourth Estate, takes the contrary view, blundering about in an
attempt to get somewhere near the truth. British Government and
administration is still unnecessarily secretive.
Mr Major promised more open government. His reward has been a plague
of leaks. Leaks from civil servants, leaks from Ministers, leaks from
private meetings with his back benchers, leaks of his words (''the
bastards'' about Cabinet colleagues) when he thought the microphones
were turned off. These leaks have played a large part in undermining his
authority.
In the Commons yesterday, he went out of his way to present clean
hands concerning the latest leak, clearly authentic, of Sir Richard
Scott's drafts of his long-awaited report on the notorious arms-to- Iraq
affair. Mr Major called them ''malicious'' without making it clear who
was being malicious to whom. What he sought to do was stake a claim that
the leak was not Government-motivated to discredit the Scott inquiry --
now in its third year and unlikely to report before September.
The Prime Minister highlighted a key factor about leaks down the ages.
They come in infinite variety and the motivation behind them has changed
since television capitivated the minds of politicians and the
consequential necessity for them to go ''on the record''.
In the days of Macmillan, Heath, Wilson -- Callaghan even -- Prime
Ministers indulged their Ministers. They used to float policy ideas to
lobby correspondents to gauge public reaction before Government
committed itself.If the public
thought the idea was lousy, Ministers disowned it.
Margaret Thatcher changed all that. She knew what she wanted, what was
best for the public, and went ahead and did it. Ministers who leaked
against her, hoping she could be turned by public outrage, found
themselves beached. Famously, she was not for turning.
Unwitting leaks are often the best. Last week, Mr Patrick Robertson
(Thatcherite Bruges Grouper, acolyte of the beleaguered Treasury Chief
Secretary Jonathan Aitken and a director of Taskforce Communications)
banged off an unsolicited fax to Aitken offering advice. Unfortunately,
he got the fax number wrong and his tactical advice on how to play the
media -- perfectly valid -- went astray to a ''New Zealander'' who
passed it straight on to the press, who in turn got the advice before
the further embarrassed Aitken even heard of it.
One Classic unwitting leaks involved the Labour Chancellor Hugh Dalton
and former Defence Secretary Roy Mason. Dalton was forced to resign
after muttering to an evening paper journalist in the members' lobby on
the way into the Chamber to deliver his Budget. The market-sensitive
information was hitting the streets before the Chancellor's
announcement.
There are also the principled leaks. There was a plethora of these in
the Thatcher years, often involving civil servants who rebelled against
what was going on. Sarah Tisdall was one such on matters concerning
security service behaviour; Clive Ponting was another. Unusually, they
were tracked down and prosecuted (Tisdall was convicted and Ponting was
aquitted.)
In vain, Sir Bernard Ingham, Thatcher's press secretary, would try to
convince journalists that the ''cock-up'' theory prevails over the
''conspiracy'' theory of government, so much preferred by political
correspondents. He was in special difficulty in this regard when perhaps
the most celebrated leak of modern times took place at the height of the
Westland Affair.
This argument about helicopters caused the resignations of the two
main protagonists in Cabinet -- Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine and
Trade Secretary Leon Brittan. Indeed, Thatcher reveals in her memoirs
that it was the closest she got to resignation herself -- that is,
before Heseltine finally toppled her in 1990.
Miss Colette Bowe, press secretary to Brittan, was ordered to leak a
confidential memo giving legal advice on the issue to Heseltine from the
then Solicitor-General Sir Patrick Mayhew. She phoned it to the
celebrated Chris Moncrieff of the Press Association. It was designed to
undermine Heseltine and it was alledged that Bowe's instructions came
from No 10.
The outraged Mayhew threatened resignation unless the true culprit was
exposed. His boss, Attorney-General Sir Michael Havers, backed him and
went so far as to tell the- then Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong
(he of the famous ''economical with the truth'' phrase over Spycatcher),
that unless an inquiry was launched, he, the Attorney, would order the
police into the Cabinet office.
Bowe was a victim. She had been unable to contact her Permanent
Secretary on the day for his advice, which was odd as he was attending a
Civil Service college. It was Leon Brittan whose resignation was
demanded by the Tory back benches. This leak was contrived and malicious
and scored a big hit.
The unfortunate Major has not quite reached this perilous stage yet.
But who can say what the next leak will bring.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang is set today to come under renewed
pressure on two fronts -- the Scottish Office budget and the amount of
public money given to the HCI private health project in Clydebank.
Mr Lang will appear before the Scottish Select Committee to answer
questions on Scottish Office funding up to 1998, and later his officials
will be called to account for the money spent on HCI.
The National Audit Office has submitted a confidential memorandum on
HCI to MPs who are members of the Public Accounts Committee, and last
night different interpretations were being placed on it by MPs.
A copy of the memorandum has been obtained by The Herald and, while it
pulls no punches, it simply sets out the detail of what happened, when
it happened, how much it cost and why. All the NAO has done is set out
the parameters within which today's inquiry will be conducted.
Labour MPs described it as ''dynamite,'' because of what they
perceived as criticism of the way the project had been handled, but the
Scottish Office said Mr Lang was very comfortable and relaxed about what
the memorandum contained.
Central to the whole HCI affair has been how much public money was
spent on the project. The Scottish Office has maintained, and is
sticking by, an overall figure of #27m, but other estimates are that the
final bill could be #41.5m.
Mr Lang has maintained throughout that a certain amount of money had
to be spent on the project to keep it alive, and sources pointed out
yesterday that the project still was continuing -- having been bought by
the Abu Dhabi Investment Agency -- with 400 people employed.
The argument being put forward was that HCI, said to be attracting
more private patients from overseas while still carrying out surgery on
some NHS patients, would turn out to be a success story.
However, both Mr Peter MacKay, a senior civil servant at the Scottish
Office Industry Department, and Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive
of Scottish Enterprise, can expect a severe grilling from a committee of
MPs not yet fully convinced that public money was properly used.
If they are not satisfied with the answers they receive, Mr Lang
himself may be summoned before the PAC to give a full, authoritative
account of how public money was used.
In the Scottish Select Committee, Mr Lang will face his annual
grilling from MPs on the planned budget for the next two to three years
-- up to and beyond the next General Election. HCI may once again
surface as the MPs investigate exactly how much was spent supporting the
private enterprise project.

THE Greek oracle at Delphi was famous for returning highly ambiguous
replies to anxious questions about the future. A touch of the Delphic
spirit, Delphicism perhaps, invaded the Tory back benches yesterday.
Unlike the oracle, which the Sketch suspects enjoyed producing replies
which looked as if they meant this but, on the other hand, could mean
that, the two Tory soothsayers clearly intended to give good news to
their beleaguered leader. It just didn't turn out that way.
Mr Quentin Davies (Stamford and Spalding) overcame a Cambridge and
Harvard education to console the Prime Minister with Kipling's famous
lines from ''If.'' -- ''If you can keep your head when all about you are
losing theirs . . . '' This so accurately represented Mr Major's current
difficulties with his parliamentary party that a huge roar of laughter
halted the quotation in its tracks.
Mr Davies then launched into a panegyric of Mr Major's recent Bosnian
policy and urged him to ''take a little credit.'' Possibly taken aback
by the Kipling, Mr Major provided one of the rare illustrations of a
politician not taking credit when being urged to do so. Urging is
generally unnecessary.
Mr Jerry Hayes (Harlow -- Con.),whom the Oratory School and London
University had given no better sense of the fitness of a quotation, went
for an old Middle Eastern proverb -- ''The dogs may bark but the caravan
moves on,'' and urged Mr Major to take the words to heart.
One had to admit he had caught the Delphic quality of making the
listener wonder what on earth the oracle was going on about. Laughter
was delayed as MPs tried to work out if this was reassurance or threat.
Mr Major said he was delighted that his campaign for literacy was
bearing fruit, which seemed a polite way of saying that the proverb was
Greek to him.
The Tories made the most of the Black Report on Monklands council.
Mr Tom Clarke (Monklands West -- Lab.), whose good luck in getting a
question to the Prime Minister might not have seemed quite so wonderful
to him --  as he had to rise to a storm of catcalls about the council of
which he is a three times Provost --  asked about discrimation against
the disabled.
Mr Major could hardly resist suggesting that discrimination in favour
of relatives appeared to be more the order of things in Monklands.
Mr Blair naturally wanted to talk about something else and the latest
Scott inquiry leak was readily to hand. The Prime Minister fenced with
his first two questions, saying he would wait for the final report. At
the current rate of leakage, he will have seen most of the conclusions
before they are published so to speak.
Unless, of course, Sir Richard, overwhelmed by the rebuttals he
receives from those criticised in draft, should alter his opinion. He
does not ride his bicycle like a man who readily changes direction.
Mr Blair worked his way towards his pre-arranged soundbite -- failure
to accept Scott would ''put the final seal of contempt on a discredited
Government'' -- but also had sensibly attempted to pin Mr Major down on
the vital point.
Would he accept Scott's conclusions whatever they might be? Mr Major
did not say No. But he certainly did not say Yes either. He said he
would read the report and reach a judgment. Quite Delphic, in fact. but
we think we can translate. If he agrees with a finding. he will accept
it. If he doesn't he won't.

THE IRA will not meet British demands for the handing over of guns
before all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein's
Martin McGuinness said yesterday.
''There isn't a snowball's chance in hell of any weapons being
decommissioned this side of a negotiated settlement,'' he said.
Mr McGuinness said his party president Gerry Adams, SDLP leader John
Hume and the Republic's Prime Minister John Bruton were working hard to
try to resolve the issue which was at a critical stage of the process.
Just before leaving for Brussels for the opening of a Sinn Fein office
he said: ''This is an obstacle which has been placed in the road of all
party talks by the British Government. It has something which has been
debated widely in the course of last seven months.
''I believe the whole decommissioning debate has almost been flogged
to death and people on the streets are sick to death of it. Because the
vast majority of people who know Irish history know in reality there is
not a snowball's chance in hell of any weapons being decommissioned this
side of a negotiated settlement.''
Sinn Fein president Mr Adams said yesterday he had written to Northern
Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew seeking a meeting on how to advance
the peace process in the province.
Mr Adams said the letter had raised issues on the lack of progress on
peace in Northern Ireland after decades of strife.
''I'm awaiting a response from Sir Patrick. I am seeking a meeting
with him to explore how we can advance the situation. The ball is very
firmly in the court of Patrick Mayhew and I hope he will respond
positively,'' he said.
It is the second request by the Sinn Fein president for a meeting
since the two men had a brief courtesy meeting in Washington last month.
Sir Patrick has so far rejected a further meeting at this stage. Mr
Adams also announced that two lawyers for Sinn Fein would make a
submission to South Africa's Cameron Commission inquiring into arms
deals during the apartheid era over alleged illegal arms sales to
loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland.
A Sinn Fein statement said South Africa's Armscor state arms dealer
had supplied weapons and ammunition, apparently in the hope of gaining
access to missile technology from Belfast's weapons and aircraft maker
Short company.

<TEXT>
BARONESS Thatcher yesterday issued a stark new challenge over Europe,
warning that Britons did not fight the Second World War to create a
Europe dominated by Germany.
The former Prime Minister, in what sounded like an oblique message to
John Major, declared that she did not want the future to go ''wonky or
wobbly''.
She spoke out at a Foyle's literary luncheon in London's Grosvenor
House Hotel to mark the publication of The Path to Power, the second
volume of her memoirs.
She sat among many of her former Cabinet colleagues, including Lord
Tebbit, Lord Parkinson, Lord Hailsham, Sir Norman Fowler and Mr Kenneth
Baker. It was like being at a revivalist meeting, she said.
Baroness Thatcher said: ''I cannot leave the future alone. I don't
want it to go wonky or wobbly. I want it to have real Conservative
principles.
''We did not go into Europe to have our parliamentary powers
constantly diminished and to have our rule of law, which is far better
than theirs, virtually taken away from us.''
She said that in her life both major political parties had been
divided over Europe.
However, she said that Britons had not fought in the war ''for the
diminution of democracy in Europe under the domination of Germany or the
diminution of our rule of law''.
Earlier, Baroness Thatcher said: ''I hate opposition. Opposition is
about talking and I and many of those people at this table are doers. We
like to put what we believe in into action.''
She said she feared socialism and knew that the Labour Party was
totally and inexorably attached to the trade unions.
''I know that perhaps their greatest wish is to undo some of the
changes I made in trade union legislation.''
Meanwhile, Britain rebuffed Neil Kinnock's first serious attempt to
wield European power yesterday, despite imminent legal action against
the Government by the former Labour leader.
The UK looks certain to join six other member states in the dock of
the European Court of Justice over its determination to sign its own
airline deals with the United States.
Mr Kinnock, the EU's transport commissioner since the start of the
year, said he alone should have responsibility for negotiating such
deals on behalf of all 15 EU countries to protect the commercial
interests of Europe's airlines.
He asked the transport ministers meeting in Luxembourg to give him the
negotiating mandate -- but they told him to go away and prepare written
evidence to demonstrate that he can get them better deals than they can
expect in individual negotiations.
Only Britain's Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney challenged the
competence of Mr Kinnock's department to act for Europe on transatlantic
air deals -- serving notice that Britain will fight every step of the
way to avoid ceding sovereign power.
Dr Mawhinney made it clear at yesterday's talks that Britain believes
it can do its own negotiating without help from the transport
commissioner.
He described the outcome as ''most satisfactory'' from Britain's point
of view, and said he was ''very dubious'' about Mr Kinnock's legal
competence to represent the EU.

TAYSIDE Police Constable Brian Murphy, 24, of East Moulin Road,
Pitlochry, was charged with indecency and breach of the peace at Perth
Sheriff Court yesterday. He was accused of exposing himself in a
shameless manner in the presence of four children, aged between seven
and 11, at his home on various occasions between April 1 and May 18
last. He was also charged with conducting himself in a disorderly manner
and disturbing the peace on various occasions between the same dates. On
these occasions, he was alleged to have put six children in a state of
fear and alarm by presenting himself to them at his home while wearing

THERE is no shortage of people who want to buy a new home, but worries
about the chances of selling their current property are preventing many
would-be purchasers from dipping their toe into the market.
Several builders have responded by offering part exchange deals or by
helping potential purchasers with the sale of their current home. As a
result, Barratt has become one of the biggest movers and shakers in the
second-hand house market, taking in thousands of older homes each year
in part exchange deals.
Barratt is enjoying considerable success with its free agency sales
service, under which the builder effectively takes on the marketing of
your existing property by circulating details within its extensive
property lists until a buyer is found.
In a remarkably quick recent deal, Coatbridge couple Ian and Rena
Woods found a buyer for their old property within just two days, leaving
them free to place a reservation and plan their move into their new
Barratt home at the company's Victoria Park development.
Being in the market for a larger, move-up home, they chose the three
bedroom detached Allenby home with garage, costing from #77,950, which
is one of five house types available at Victoria Park.
''We are absolutely delighted with the service we've received from
Barratt. Compared with the usual process of putting your house up for
sale with all the expense, hassle and uncertainty usually involved, this
has been a piece of cake and we've had plenty of time to concentrate on
getting everything ready for our new home,'' said Ian.
Barratt recently opened its new showhome complex at Victoria Park with
three professionally interior designed house types available to view
seven days a week.
Prices at the development start from #55,200 for the two-bedroom
semi-detached Roseberry home, designed for couples and those with young
families; from #66,950 for the three-bedroom semi-detached Palmerston;
from #77,950 for the three-bedroom Allenby and from #93,250 for the top
of the range four bedroom detached Buckingham home.

PART of Falkirk's railway history was about to be shunted into the
scrapyard, until a housebuilder signalled a new use for an old gate
which clanged shut for the last time more than thirty years ago.
For generations, pedestrian, cycle, horse-drawn and motor traffic
stopped at the level-crossing gates on the town's Slamannan Road, to
allow the trains to cross to and from the colliery and brickworks on the
Callendar Estate.
Timber was also brought into the Estate Sawmill at Muirhouse on the
Slamannan Road, and left again as a variety of finished timber products,
especially the Callendar and Herbertshire gates much prized by the
farming community.
Ironically, the level-crossing gates, sited right next to the Mill's
own wooden gates, were of sturdy steel construction. They protected the
road crossing for the spur line that climbed the steep gradient from the
old 1840s Edinburgh Railway line which served the High Station and the
town, long before Falkirk's Grahamston Station was built. The spur line
was closed in the 1960s.
Earlier this year, the sawmill site was sold to Ogilvie Homes for its
Ridgemont development of 17 detached villas, but the company wanted to
ensure that the historic level-crossing gates which were still on the
site should be preserved for posterity.
Development manager Alan Horn contacted Jim Watson, Falkirk-based
director of the Scottish Railway Preservation Trust Society, who was
chuffed when told that the builder would be gifting the gates to the
trust.
The crossing gates were transported to the Bo'ness workshops of the
preservation society and Jim Watson was there to supervise the handover,
which was formally made by Sandy Ogilvie of the Ogilvie Group and Alan
Horn on behalf of Ogilvie Homes.
As a railway buff, civil engineer Jim Watson is very much involved in
keeping relics of railway history as working artefacts. ''When the
level-crossing gates have been refurbished at our workshops, they will
resume their working life, acting as ambassadors for Falkirk's railway
heritage in Bo'ness where my society operates the Bo'ness &amp; Kinneil
Railway.''
The gates will operate on the crossing opposite the bus station.

LORD Justice Scott's inquiry was told that the decision to relax
export guidelines on arms sales to Iraq was taken in November, 1988, by
then Trade Minister Alan Clark, then Foreign Office Minister William
Waldegrave and Lord Trefgarne, the Defence Minister, following the
Iran-Iraq ceasefire.
* ALAN CLARK left Parliament at the 1992 General Election. His
evidence to the Old Bailey in November, 1992, led to the collapse of the
Matrix Churchill trial and to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry.
Three executives of the Midlands machine tool firm had been charged
with trying to evade controls on exports of defence equipment to Iraq.
They were acquitted after Mr Clark told the court he had been
''economical with the actualite'' in advising machine tool makers to
emphasise the peaceful uses of their goods when applying for licences to
export to Iraq.
In his evidence to the Scott inquiry, Mr Clark told of meeting
representatives of the Machine Tools Association in January, 1988, to
discuss export licences to Baghdad.
He said he understood the intelligence services had an agent in Iraq
who would have been in physical danger if the exports were blocked.
Mr Clark said he told the firms he understood their goods were for
''general engineering purposes'' -- the phrase he later admitted was
''economical'' -- and made no mention of concerns over munitions
manufacture.
''I had to, if you like, indulge in a fiction and invite them to
participate in a fiction,'' he said.
Mr Clark told the inquiry he had wanted to tell Parliament in 1988
that the Government had decided to relax the export guidelines, but
other Ministers had been reluctant to do so.
Asked by Lord Justice Scott whether his attitude would have been
interpreted by the companies as a sign that the Government did not mind
what the equipment was being used for, Mr Clark insisted that at no time
did he give them ''a nod and a wink''.
* WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE gave Foreign Office approval to export licences
worth more than #12m for two batches of Matrix Churchill machine tools
in 1989 which went to huge munitions factories outside Baghdad.
Mr Waldegrave told the Scott inquiry he might have made different
decisions if his officials had shown him intelligence reports on the
equipment's destination.
He denied that he had been party to a secret relaxation of controls on
defence exports. Repeatedly, he insisted that the change in words did
not amount to a change in policy.
Lord Justice Scott and his counsel, Miss Presiley Baxendale QC,
questioned Mr Waldegrave intensely, citing minutes of Whitehall meetings
and ministerial correspondence which referred to ''revised guidelines''
and ''implementation of a more liberal policy''.
Mr Waldegrave persisted: ''I am justified, and I passionately believe
I am justified, in saying there was no change in policy and therefore no
necessity to say anything to parliament.''
* LORD TREFGARNE was Minister of State for Defence Procurement and Mr
Clark's successor as Minister for Trade.
He told the inquiry there had been strong foreign policy reasons,
including the plight of British hostages in the Middle East, for not
announcing the change of stance over exports to Iraq.
In a series of belligerent exchanges, he insisted that the guidelines
had never been changed.
Lord Justice Scott asked him what was the philosophy underlying the
decision on whether or not an announcement was made.
Lord Trefgarne said: ''It's 90 per cent pragmatic. I am certain that
political pragmatism must be the right approach.
''Of course you must not tell parliament an untruth or mislead but you
don't tell them everything.''

ABOUT 650 people in Scotland may have been infected with the
potentially fatal Hepatitis C virus through medical procedures, Scottish
Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton disclosed last night.
He said in a Commons written reply: ''A 'lookback' exercise is
currently under way to seek to identify, counsel and treat patients who
may have been exposed to the Hepatitis C virus via blood or blood
products.
''It is estimated that around 650 people throughout Scotland may have
been infected in this way, 350 of whom are likely to be haemophiliacs.''
Replying to a question from Dr Norman Godman (Greenock and Port
Glasgow -- Lab.), the Minister said that a breakdown of the figures for
Inverclyde and Strathclyde was not available.The potentially fatal C
form was discovered in 1989 and can take up to 30 years to develop.
The British Liver Trust estimates that Hepatitis C may affect 1% of
the general population in the United Kingdom.

LABOUR MP Mike Watson (Glasgow Central) threatened in the Commons last
night to name individuals he believes to be involved in the drugs trade
in Glasgow.
In a late-night debate, he said he had been in touch with Strathclyde
Police about the matter and had been advised that to name names at this
stage ''would not be advisable.''
However, Mr Watson indicated he would be prepared to name people at
some future stage, and he gave the House the clear message: ''I want to
get these people off the streets. I believe there should be no hiding
place for them.''
The MP called for more Government action to tackle the problem of drug
taking in Glasgow. He said Strathclyde Police needed more dedicated drug
squad officers to combat the ever-growing number of pushers and
suppliers. Too often drug-related offences were simply the
responsibility of officers who were also dealing with car crime,
assaults, housebreaking, and so on.
Mr Watson argued that more funding was needed for
detoxification-rehabilitation centres to help addicts trying to get off
drugs, and said the law needed to be examined, with tougher penalties
for pushers and suppliers.
He said there ought to be charges of culpable homicide for those found
to have supplied users who had died, and called for greater recognition
of the fact that there were many indirect sufferers of drug abuse.
''The families and friends of users, particularly the bereaved, need
support and counselling to assist them in coming to terms with the
horrors of addiction,'' Mr Watson said. ''It has to be accepted that the
use of drugs is now so widespread that only containment is possible.''
For the Government, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton said Ministers were totally committed to turning the
tide of drug misuse in Glasgow and indeed throughout Scotland, and he
appealed for anyone with information to pass it on to the police.
In 1994 alone, drug misuse had claimed the lives of 139 young people
in Scotland known or suspected to be dependent on drugs. He said: ''That
is an appalling statistic, graphically underlining why we regard drug
misuse as one of the greatest challenges facing us today.
''It is why public expenditure on drug misuse, across a spectrum of
services, including police, social work, education, urban aid, health
and prisons, exceeds #40m every year,'' he said. What was required was a
concerted, strategic, targeted approach, which brought together the
efforts of all the agencies.

A HOSPITAL sister, disciplined after she carried out part of an
appendix operation, has taken early retirement.
Mrs Valerie Tomlinson, 53, was given a final written warning and put
on six months' probation after an investigation into the incident last
December at Treliske Hospital, Truro, Cornwall.
However, Mrs Tomlinson, a nurse with almost 30 years' experience, has
left after she did not get full support from other nurses in the wake of
the incident. Many colleagues welcomed her back but others felt she had
let down their profession.
''I have taken early retirement and my nursing career is now a closed
chapter,'' said Mrs Tomlinson, of St Wenn, Cornwall. ''I am now a lady
of leisure and I can spend my time gardening and campaigning for Friends
of the Earth. I find this work very rewarding.''
Mr Tahir Bhatti, the surgeon involved in the operation, was allowed to
keep his job after being reprimanded by the South West Regional Health
Authority.
Investigators were told Mr Bhatti was present throughout the operation
on the un-named male patient but Mrs Tomlinson made the first incision,
cut out the appendix, and closed the wound.

A NURSE whose life has been haunted by tragedy has won damages of
#138,300 after a hospital accident plunged her into a state of deep
depression.
As a child, the 43-year-old woman was abused physically by her mother
and sexually by her brother. She became pregnant after her brother raped
her. The baby was taken away from her.
Later in life, she fell in love with a doctor and planned to marry
him. She was carrying his child when he was killed in a car crash
without ever seeing his son, who is now 21.
In a judgment issued yesterday at the Court of Session, Lord Prosser
said that ''Mary'' was working as a sister in a hospital in central
Scotland in February 1991, when a tube of surgical disinfectant spilled
over her right hand, causing a chemical burn.
The health board admitted responsibility for the accident and the only
question for the judge to decide was the amount of damages to be
awarded.
Lord Prosser said that, although the burn was painful and took time to
heal, the main problem for Mary had been the severe psychological
problems triggered by the accident.
Because of her personal history, she had a vulnerable and fragile
personality which meant that events, which would have no significant
effect on most people, could produce serious and disabling results for
her.
The burn to her hand meant she had to stop work with a considerable
degree of uncertainty as to when she could go back. Because her work was
so important to her and played a significant part in helping her cope
with life, this in turn led to a state of morbid depression.
Lord Prosser added: ''Despite her underlying psychological fragility,
she has brought up her son from birth to the age of 21, alone and
successfully.
''Latterly, she was a sister in a geriatric ward, a responsible and
demanding job which she appears to have fulfilled both to her own great
satisfaction and in such a way as to win the respect of patients and
those with whom she worked.''
The judge said her present state remained seriously depressive. She
had left her home to live in less stressful surroundings in the country.
However, without a working life involving regular and ordinary contact
with others, she lacked the defence against depressive illness which her
job had provided.
There was also the fact that, having substantially devoted her life to
bringing up her son, he was now grown up and, naturally, to some degree
growing away from her.
She was clearly not yet ready for any return to ''significant'' work.
She had made a ''gallant attempt'' to work but had become swamped if she
had to cope with more than half a dozen people.
One psychiatrist had told the court that Mary was unlikely ever to
work again as a nurse. She thought that the kind of work she might be
able to cope with in future would be something like helping in an animal
sanctuary
Lord Prosser said that in assessing damages he had to take account of
the real possibility that some other incident, apart from the burn,
could have affected Mary and triggered off a serious depressive illness.
He made a reduction of 20% on that basis.

A BROTHEL madame who trained runaway children as call girls was
convicted of controlling prostitutes yesterday.
Myra Ling-Ling Forde, 39, taught the teenagers, mostly from a care
home, how to talk to clients on the phone and have sex in front of porn
films.
She provided them with a lurid price list for their services,
Winchester Crown Court was told.
One 13-year-old girl would go straight from school to sell her body at
Forde's brothel -- a house in Salisbury, Wiltshire, which she called The
Oriental Massage Parlour.The court was told that one 15-year-old had sex
with five men at once and lost count of the number of times she sold
herself for sex while under Forde's control.
Forde, originally from the Philippines, became a prostitute three
years ago when she got behind on her mortgage payments but she denied
recruiting young girls for the trade, claiming she was capable of
servicing her customers herself.Hairdresser David Tungatt, 42, was
accused of helping to run the trade but claimed he was simply a friend
of Forde's and had nothing to do with prostitution. He also was
convicted of two charges of controlling prostitutes and also of
indecently assaulting one of the girls.
Forde was remanded in custody and will be sentenced today. Tungatt was
remanded on bail for pre-sentence reports.

THIRTEEN survivors from the weekend Turkish holiday bus crash were
being treated in hospital last night after being flown back to Glasgow.
Their flight had 29 survivors along with relatives and medics who had
travelled to Turkey to treat them. It was met by a team from Glasgow
Royal Infirmary.
After assessment, 19 of the injured were admitted to hospital.
Mr Rudy Crawford, an accident emergency consultant at the Royal, said:
''There are a number of seriously injured among the group, some of whom
will require surgery.
''Some were still distressed but most of them were quiet and subdued.
They have obviously been through a lot.''
Nine of the injured were taken to the Royal and four with spinal
injuries to the Southern General.
The only injured passenger to be named yesterday was Ms Doreen Wright,
who is being treated at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow for compound
fractures. Her condition is stable.
The bodies of Mrs Mhairi Telford, 23, from Dundee; Miss Catriona
Currie, 48, from Lenzie; and Mr Raymond Hassey, 41, from Edinburgh, who
were killed when their coach collided with a lorry and plunged into a
gully outside the resort of Marmaris, were also returned to Scotland
yesterday.

AN accountant who was kidnapped in broad daylight during a shopping
trip was stabbed and then ''executed'' on a desolate shingle bank,
Winchester Crown Court was told yesterday.
He was murdered in as ''callously, cruel, chilling, and calculated'' a
manner as one could imagine, the prosecution said.
He was taken to his place of ''execution'' where he was stabbed and
then left. Eventually he died from a combination of shock, hypothermia,
and stab wounds, the jury was told.
Mr Matthew Pearce, 21, of Chichester Road, Portsmouth, and Mr Darren
Jones, 21, of Grayshott Road, Southsea, Hampshire, both deny murdering
Mr Grant Price, 43.
They also deny a second charge of unlawfully wounding another man, Mr
James Wink, 20.
Mr Michael Hubbard, QC, prosecuting, said the accountant had been
kidnapped in a busy car park at Gosport, Hampshire, on a Saturday
afternoon in January last year.
''He was kidnapped in the sense that he was bundled into his own motor
car, which he had parked in that car park in the sight of his
eight-year-old boy,'' said counsel.
''He was about to take his son to keep an appointment at an optician's
in the High Street in Gosport.''
Counsel said he was then taken around the countryside and attempts
made, some successful, to get money from cashpoint machines using his
cash cards. He was then bundled into the boot of his car, gagged, and
driven more than 40 miles through the New Forest to Keyhaven.
''Then he was subjected to a walk of something in the order of one and
a half miles along a desolate shingle bank which marks the entrance of
the Western Approaches of the Solent,'' said Mr Hubbard.
''He was led to the spot of his execution,'' said counsel, and there
he was stabbed in the back of the neck.
''He did not die immediately. He was left in a spot which is as
desolate as you might expect to find on the coastline and eventually he
died from a combination of shock, hypothermia, and stab wounds.''
Mr Price's body was found six days later, said Mr Hubbard.
He said that three hours or so before Mr Price was kidnapped, a
20-year-old man had been subjected to a vicious attack with a knife in a
car park five miles away at Fareham, when he would not hand over the
keys to his car.
The prosecution alleged that both attacks were linked and committed by
the two accused.
At the time of the kidnap in Gosport, a witness said the front seat
passenger in the car seemed ''as if he had the fear of God in him''.
The court was told Mr Price's son David was found crying in the car
park by a passer-by after the kidnappers had driven off with his father.
He was taken to the police station nearby.
He was spared the trauma of giving evidence before a jury after
defence barristers agreed a summary could be read out.
In the written statement, the boy said they left the vehicle in the
car park near the bridge.
''After walking for a while, I told dad I had left my glasses in the
car. We were going to the optician's and he went back to get them.
''He left me at the car park entrance near some flats and I saw him go
back to the car. I then saw dad's car driving off with three people in
it.
''There were two in the back and one in the front but I could not see
who was driving,'' he said.
Mr Jones was arrested after police carried out house-to-house searches
of the area near where Mr Price's car was discovered, the jury was told.
Officers recognised him from an artist's impression produced from a
description of a man seen at a cash-point in Alton on the day Mr Price
was kidnapped.
The trial was adjourned until today.

THE chief executive of the Stirlingshire-based Central Scotland
Healthcare Trust, responsible for the care of mentally handicapped
patients throughout Scotland, confirmed last night the trust is to shed
700 jobs and a significant number of beds.
Mr Derek Pollacchi said the cuts were part of the trust's three-year
business plan to move away from hospital care to community-based care.
He said reports that 500 beds could go were on the high side but
confirmed that there would be a major reduction.
However, he added that job losses in the hospital sector would be
compensated for with jobs in the community sector.
The trust, whose purchasers include 14 of Scotland's 15 health boards
and five GP fund holders, said the job cuts would be across the board.
''The plan for the next three years reflects the balance of hospital
care and community-based care required by the purchasing authorities.''

<HEADLINE>Tribunal told of catalogue of faults at club</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE new chief executive of the Royal Scottish Automobile Club found a
catalogue of faults which could have led to it being prosecuted, an
industrial tribunal heard yesterday.
Mr Timothy Kelly joined the RSAC last June and immediately began to
make improvements. He said guests and members at the Glasgow club and
hotel faced:
* Standards of hygiene which broke the law.
* No fire evacuation procedures.
* Having to listen to music that sounded like hymns during diner.
* No breakfast menus for five months.
* Menus with no prices on them.
* Brown and white sugar in the same bowl.
* Dirty crockery, tablecloths, carpets, and chairs.
* Debris left on breakfast tables from the previous evening's meal.
* Decomposing fruit in a bowl.
* Coffee made at 9am and left brewing until it was served three hours
later.
Mr Kelly admitted there were serious problems with hygiene and that he
could have been prosecuted and ''heavily punished for permitting that
type of standard''.
He added that the food and beverage areas of the club were among the
worst that he had ever experienced and placed responsibility with Miss
Nicki Arcari, the department manager at the time.
He said the standards at the club were to be no less than those of a
four-star hotel. When he found poor morale, lack of discipline, and high
levels of absenteeism among staff, he became concerned about Miss Arcari
and her lack of commitment to improvements in service and profitability.
Shortly before a very important function, he found that Miss Arcari
had left the club to visit a colleague in hospital who had had a baby.
He told the tribunal he was ''beginning to panic'' when he realised the
reception for 100 guests was not ready.
There was no sherry for the sherry reception and nothing was set up.
The top table VIP reception in the boardroom was not ready and there
were no glasses or drink. When he went downstairs to the function suite,
he found there was no wine or whisky and the guests were due to arrive
shortly.
He said: ''I summoned my assistants and told them, 'We have a
problem.' We closed ranks and we got people served. There wasn't
adequate stock in the liquor store. Not enough staff. We had senior
managers putting bottles of wine on tables.''
Mr Kelly said the function was so important to the RSAC that, if it
had been a disaster and he had been dismissed the following morning, he
would have accepted it.
Mr Kelly also claimed Miss Arcari failed to change a menu which showed
a glass of wine and a bottle of wine both costing 45p.
After issuing a final written warning to Miss Arcari, Mr Kelly sacked
her last December.
Miss Arcari, of Brackenrigg Road, Rouken Glen, Glasgow, told the
tribunal how the SRAC had been run for over two years without a chief
executive. She said started work at the club in 1990 as assistant food
and beverage manager but, when she was promoted after 13 months to
manager, she had no assistant.
She said she had received no training in her job and revealed there
had been no breakfast menus for more than four years.
Asked about a dishwasher described by Mr Kelly as the ''dirtiest he
had ever seen'' and whether it was her responsibility, she replied it
was ''questionable''.
When it was put to her by the RSAC's solicitor that she was not up to
the job, she said: ''The club did progress further than my knowledge or
my background could cover.''
The tribunal will issue a written judgment at a later date.

EXCLUSIVE
THE Accounts Commission has been called in to look at the
circumstances surrounding a deal between Ayrshire and Arran Health Board
and a private firm to build and operate a 90-bed home for the elderly
mentally ill.
The deal has angered the local MP and trade unions as well as
prompting both NHS Trust leaders and private nursing home operators to
question the way it has been handled.
Now the Controller of Audit, Mr Robert Black, will be asked to look
into the contract which has been signed for 15 years on a tapering basis
starting with 90 beds but reducing if the demand decreases as it is
expected to do.
The contract has been signed with Irvine Care which is owned
ultimately by Integrated Health Care Services based in Maryland, US. The
company has made its money in a string of specialist care homes and has
now set its sights on the UK.
The news of the referral to the Accounts Commission, which examines
the conduct of local authorities and health service bodies, emerged
after a meeting between Cunninghame South MP Brian Donohoe and health
board chairman Jim Donaldson and chief executive Jim Eckford.
All parties agreed that an approach should be made, although there is
no guarantee that a full-scale investigation will ensue once an initial
look at the circumstances has been taken.
Mr Donohoe, a fierce critic of the plan to build the facility in the
grounds of Ayrshire Central Hospital to take psychogeriatric patients
from Ravenspark and Ailsa Hospitals, said: ''I welcome the fact that a
call to the Accounts Commission to look at the whole contract will be
supported by the health board itself.
''It is quite clear that there is widespread and major concern about
this contract and there is no reason why it should not be looked at by
the Accounts Commission given the issues which this whole affair has
raised.''
He added: ''I remain convinced that the whole tender process was
flawed and that the board failed to carry it out properly.
''This is a multi-million pound deal which brings parts of the NHS
closer to private control and that cannot possibly be for the good of
the people of Ayrshire.''
Mr Eckford said: ''I stressed at our meeting with Brian Donohoe that I
had no concerns whatsoever on how this contract had been handled within
the board.
''As a public sector manager of 35 years I was, however, very jealous
of the board's reputation for probity and use of public funds and would,
therefore, be more than happy if the Accounts Commission so agreed to
see the Commission review our actions and procedures.''
''I believe strongly that any such review will confirm that the
board's actions were proper in the light of practice and legislation at
the time of tendering.''

<HEADLINE>Injured boy rescued from ordeal on cliffs after three days</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977780990</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCHOOLBOY who jumped over cliffs at Beachy Head in Sussex after a
row about his girlfriend lay in agony for 72 hours before being rescued
yesterday.
Martin Hinchcliffe, 15, broke his leg and cracked several ribs when he
hit jagged outcrops as he fell 35ft into a 15ft-deep gully.
The crevasse saved his life -- next came a drop of 45ft -- but it also
hid him from view and the chance of rescue.He realised he was too badly
hurt to stand or to clamber up the cliffs. He started shouting for help
but was not heard because he had fallen in such a remote spot. He sucked
on rocks to stop himself becoming dehydrated.
His faint cries were eventually heard by a man walking on the beach
below.
After the alarm was raised, three firemen and a paramedic abseiled
down the cliff to give Martin first aid before he was strapped on to a
stretcher and lowered to the beach below where his parents were waiting
with a lifeboat crew and rescue helicopter.
Martin disappeared on Saturday after a family row about what he had
been up to when he took his girlfriend, Michelle Daignault, for a night
out at the cinema.
The schoolboy was described by friends as ''very upset'' by remarks
made by the girl's father and went home to scribble a note to his
mother, Mrs Janet Hunnisett, saying he would kill himself.
He then walked to the white chalk cliffs at the Sugar Lump, an 80ft
cliff a few hundred yards from the highest spot of the cliffs at Beachy
Head, and jumped off.
The terrified boy had to cling to the ledge until his rescuers found
him yesterday morning covered in chalk, but still able to give them a
cheerful greeting.
Sergeant Malcolm Richards, one of the rescuers, said: ''Martin was
hidden from view in a deep crevasse and, because he weighs some 15
stones, they had difficulty winching him out of the gap.''Rescuers were
eventually able to get him out on a stretcher and then lower him down to
the beach below. It was a difficult operation because there were rocks
falling all around.''
Speaking as he was being rescued, Martin said: ''I feel very thirsty.
I never thought I was going to make it.''
Mr Richards said: 0''The boy and his girlfriend had gone to the cinema
during the day on Saturday and ended up indulging in some passion behind
the cinema. When the girl was picked up by her parents, they thought
something was wrong. Later, Martin rang the girl's parents to explain
what had happened and he then went missing. He thought he was in deep
trouble.''

THE romance between Princess Margaret and royal equerry Group Captain
Peter Townsend, who died yesterday, was doomed from the start because of
his divorce.
In 1955, when their affair became a public issue, divorce still
carried a social stigma. A lot changes in 40 years. Today, it seems a
positively civilised option, not a prelude to the collapse of society
and the fall of the monarchy.
In 1978, in his autobiography, Time and Chance, Capt Townsend wrote:
''She could have married me only if she had been prepared to give up
everything -- her position, her prestige, her privy purse. I simply
hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have
lost.''
The love affair between the equerry and the Princess had been going
for several years by 1955 but had not made the papers here. The British
press in the 1950s was, by and large, just as reticent on royal
pecadillos as it was during the Windsor and Wallis affair in the 1930s.
Overseas, it was another matter, however, and when the princess
brushed a speck of dust from Capt Townsend's jacket on her sister's
coronation day in 1953, it gave the American press the peg from which to
hang their story. Twelve days later, The People broke the news and the
fat was in the fire.
Capt Townsend wrote that, unbelievably, nobody at the palace had taken
what sailors call ''avoiding action''.
On the orders of the then Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, who
wanted ''this troublesman man'' out of the way, Capt Townsend was
dispatched into exile. The job, air attache in Brussels, he described as
''an unnatural move to an obsolete post''.
The lovers were told to wait two years, by which time the Princess
would be 25, and the Royal Marriages Act, under which she required the
Queen's assent, would no longer apply. They did not see each other
during that time, or, if they did, nobody found out. The separation
worked. In October 1955, as speculation about their intentions raged,
they met and agreed they had no future together. She announced her
decision in a personal statement on October 30, 1955.
The establishment, intent on ensuring that the royal boat, in which it
was such a comfortable passenger, was not rocked, had brought every
imagineable pressure to bear on the Princess.
It was made clear to her what the cost of happiness would be. Not that
she was in any doubt. She had the awful example of the Duke of Windsor,
who had had more to lose by marrying for love than a mythical place in
the succession to take into account.
He was dispatched into the outer darkness, ostracised by his family,
so it is hardly surprising, devout Christian or not, that she opted for
the status quo.
The popular view, the one the royal image making machine has fostered,
is she put duty before happiness, but it is just as reasonable to argue,
since she is notorious for behaving like a princess, and is famed as the
house guest from hell, that love did not stand a chance.
In 1959, Capt Townsend married a 20-year-old Belgian girl, Marie Luce,
and they have lived outside Paris for the last 30 years. In 1960, the
Princess married Anthony Armstrong Jones in Westminster Abbey. They had
two children but, after 16 years, the marriage ended in divorce and the
toyboys, the landscape gardeners, and the gentlemen ''walkers''
followed.
Society did not crack asunder at the divorce and today nobody cares
much what she does, which is not a lot, her official engagements being
few and far between.
Lord St John said she was very happy and fulfilled and it was nonsense
to think of her pining away in Kensington Palace. ''She has many good
friends and I don't think she has ever been happier than she is at the
present time,'' he added.
However, the position she once occupied as the nation's admired,
fun-loving royal, the darling of cafe society, always good for a laugh
and a singsong at the piano, has not endured.
Peter Wooldridge Townsend was one of several equerries brought in by
George VI towards the end of the war.
He accompanied Princess Margaret on her first important foreign trip
to attend the coronation of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands in 1948.
Given the closed world in which the Princesses moved, he must have been
irresistible.
After they decided not to marry, he behaved like a gentleman and his
memoirs are totally unsensational in content. In retrospect, the romance
looks like the first crack in the veneer of happy family perfection the
Windsors had cultivated so assiduously in the aftermath of the
abdication.

PRINCESS Margaret hid her grief for the man she once loved as the
death of Group Captain Peter Townsend cast a shadow over Royal Ascot
yesterday.
The Princess, whose announcement that she would not marry him
astounded the nation 40 years ago, put on a brave face at the royal race
meeting.
However, she was undoubtedly deeply saddened by Group Captain
Townsend's death in France, reportedly from cancer. He was 80.
The Princess -- who will not be going to the funeral -- appeared
composed and in good spirits as she smiled and acknowledged the polite
applause of racegoers.
It is not known whether she was in touch with him towards the end of
his lifebut it is certain that their love affair not only rocked the
Establishment but also touched the hearts of millions of ordinary
people.
It had fairy tale written all over it. She was the pretty and lively
younger sister of the Queen.
He was the dashing former Battle of Britain hero, who shot down 11
enemy aircraft, including the first German bomber to crash in England.
His string of medals included the Distinguished Service Order and two
Distinguished Flying Crosses for gallantry.
From 1944 to 1952 he was equerry to King George VI, during which time
he met the Princess.
His wartime marriage, which produced two sons, was gradually
undermined by constant separations and his official duties.
Later, the romance with Princess Margaret developed -- for 11 years
they were part of each other's lives. But it was not to be.
The Establishment could not countenance the marriage of a divorced
commoner to the Queen's sister, third in line of succession to the
throne.
Always the quintessential Englishman abroad, Townsend developed a
varied and successful career from Paris as a wine buyer, a public
relations man, a Radio Luxembourg disc jockey, United Nations adviser
and author of six books.
He sold his 12 war medals for #22,000 in 1988 to set up a trust fund
to help children who have suffered in war.
In recent years, he and his wife lived 30 miles outside Paris at St
Leger-en-Yvelines.
Group Captain Townsend had suffered from agonising ''gastric
problems'' but details of the illness were not disclosed.
He and the Princess met at an official function in 1992 for the first
time in 30 years -- and that led to a luncheon invitation at Kensington
Palace the following year, when they ''chatted like old friends''.
He died on Monday night, the British Embassy in Paris announced. The
funeral will be on Friday.
The Princess, although ''sad to learn'' of his death, decided to
attend Ascot as planned -- but did not stay long.
She arrived, dressed in pale apple green, in the traditional royal
carriage procession, sitting next to the Queen Mother.
The Queen, who sent a private message to Group Captain Townsend's
widow, will be represented at his funeral.
* Buckingham Palace said that Princess Margaret would keep a
commitment to travel to San Francisco on Friday for an official
engagement.

STIRLING is a good area for housing. There's a good variety in terms
of residential lets. The Allen &amp; Harris people, for example, have a
splendid lodge on offer, not too far out of town.
It has a southern exposure, with a fine view across wooded policies.
And you can fish for trout on the nearby lochs if you've a mind.
For your #750 a month, you get an entrance hall, three reception
rooms, study, store room, bathroom, pantry, kitchen and utility room.
First floor adds on six bedrooms and two bathrooms. The attic has store
rooms, and an additional smaller bedroom.
It's around 200 years old, stone-built, and with lots of polished oak
floors. Saves having to bother with new-fangled fitted carpets.
There's central heating, garage and kennels, and an attractive garden.
Not to be outdone, Slater Hogg &amp; Howison come up with a modern-style
property. Same price but different detail.
This is a detached villa, in Dollar, providing a family atmosphere in
a quiet area. Along with four bedrooms and two public rooms goes a
fitted kitchen, decent-sized gardens, parking space and a garage. There
is gas-fired central heating as well.
Not that everything is restricted to this style of let by any means.
Possibly the old-established local company of Graham &amp; Sibbald would
typify the kind of range clients can expect.
''We deal with everything from starter flats to rather upmarket
executive properties,'' says G &amp; S associate, Derek Anderson. ''Prices
would range from, say, #250 a month to perhaps #1000, and the area would
take in Stirling itself, the Hillfoots, Dollar and Dunblane - places
like that.''
Like many other areas, Stirling and its surroundings have noticed
people coming north, and going for the option of rental rather than
buying.
''Sometimes these are people dealing with local projects for a fixed
period,'' says Derek. ''They may simply be people with a house in the
South, and they don't want to take on another here.
''Stirling is a thriving place, with an expanding commercial centre.
There is a lot on the go. And with the university as well, we find
business pretty steady.''
For students then, a top floor flat in town. Lounge, bedroom, kitchen,
bathroom and toilet, furnished and available, for #250. Slightly larger
- living room, bedroom, kitchen/dining area, bathroom, gas central
heating. Furnished, and coming in at #350.
Still in town, but possibly more into the executive range. Living
room, master bedroom with en suite, double bedroom, fully fitted
kitchen, shower room. Gas central heating, double glazing, single
garage. #550 a month.
Out to Dollar, where the same sort of rental gets a semi-det with
living room, sitting room, three bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom. Gas
central heating, double glazing, car port.
Bridge of Allan is another of those desirable residential areas. A
detached bungalow would be around #650. You could try Causewayhead,
where #850 gets you an unfurnished, executive-style three-bedroom villa
with integral double garage.
Very much the kind of range you would expect in the Glasgow area,
really.

HILLPARK Pines in Edinburgh, which must qualify as one of the most
prestigious developments currently being built in Scotland, if not the
UK, has seen buoyant sales of the past six to eight months... with price
tags for the four, five, and six-bedroom homes ranging from #325,000 --
#490,000.
Mactaggart and Mickel whose development it is, plans to enter Hillpark
Pines in a national competition which is looking for the Best Luxury
Development in the country, reports Ed Monaghan the company's general
manager.
In the Blackhall area of the capital, Hillpark Pines sits at the foot
of Corstorphine Hill and has carefully preserved 60-year-old pine trees
within its landscape confines.
The house designs have been inspired by those of the renowned
architect Sir Robert Lorimer.
Phase One, consisting of 10 houses, was started in 1989 then
mothballed as the bite of the recession slowed the economy to a
standstill.
The one remaining house in that phase is currently the show house,
while two houses have been built and sold in the second phase with
planning awaited for the remaining seven.
Whichever house type is chosen, purchasers can be guaranteed an
extremely high specification, and a very luxurious lifestyle with
tremendous individuality in terms of choice of finishes and fittings.
Kitchens for example, come in a choice of three standard lay outs, and
the units are traditional solid timbers -- cherry, oak, or the very
popular limed oak for instance, or they can be hand painted on site to
customer's taste. Each has an oven, hob, microwave, BBQ unit, cooker
hood, fridge, freezer and dishwasher and all have utility rooms.
Similarly in master bedrooms, the fitted furnishings can be hand
painted to coordinate perhaps with wall coverings or fabrics.
Radiators in public rooms -- and in rooms where window seating has
been fitted -- are discreetly contained within decorative boxed grilles.
At least one fireplace with living flame fire, is included in each
house -- there are three in the lounge, formal dining room and family
room of the six bedroomed house -- and a choice of fire place is given
to the customer.
Some very distinctive features have been built into the houses at
Hillpark Pines, such as columns, adding character, solidity and an
elegance which owes its inspiration to the earlier part of this century.
The feeling of individuality is completed by purchasers being able
also to choose carpets, curtains, and wall coverings, within the
package, giving the opportunity for that rare luxury -- a totally
coordinated home.
Hillpark Pines could well bring the Best Luxury Development prize to
Scotland.

WHEN Cumbernauld was launched almost 40 years ago, it was designed to
provide jobs and better housing for overcrowded Glaswegians. Now it is
surpassing all previous expectations by becoming a popular choice for
homebuyers.
The new town has just had one of its most successful years in terms of
private housing completions, with some 14 housebuilders active in the
town.
The number of completions totalled 413, with a further 82 homes under
construction. Four builders, Bellway Homes, Carvill Homes, McLean Homes,
and Tilbury Douglas, each completed over 50 units in Blackwood, part of
the Broadwood Project.
Later this year, Cumbernauld Development Corporation plans to release
a group of individual plots as part of the Craigmarloch Village project.
Craigmarloch comprises a mixed tenure development of private and rented
housing. The rented accommodation includes a sheltered housing complex
and luxury rented flats run by Quality Street.
The development has been planned to look as much as possible like a
traditional planned Scottish country village and comes with its own High
Street, Village Green, golf course and loch.
A wide variety of private housing is already being built. A nearby
shopping centre includes a major foodstore. The Broadwood complex, with
Clyde's football stadium and other facilities, is within easy reach.
Craigmarloch offers easy access to the centre of Glasgow via the Stepps
bypass. The development also has the advantage of being within a
five-minute walk of Croy Station.
Since its inception in 1956, Cumbernauld Development Corporation has
built almost 15,000 homes, ranging from high rise flats to executive
villas. Today, owner occupation stands at 72.5% with over 10,000 former
corporation properties now sold to the sitting tenants.
The development corporation says it intends to continue its commitment
to complete as many of its economic, social, and residential projects as
possible prior to its wind-up date in 1996.

COUNCIL tax bills across Scotland could rise by an average of 10% next
year, local government finance officers in Edinburgh have told
councillors.
Edinburgh residents already pay the highest council tax in Scotland
and a rise of 10% would mean Band D bills increasing from #827 to around
#900.
The predictions were made at a finance seminar for Labour members of
the new unitary authority which takes over next April.
Councillor Brian Weddell, Labour finance spokesman on the new council,
said it was too early to predict what the 1996-97 charge would be in
Edinburgh but he warned of financial difficulties facing the new
authority.
Council officials were working with Scottish Office finance experts to
try to get the best deal possible for the city and to ensure a fair and
equitable distribution of resources for the new council, he said.
Labour's bleak forecast of rising bills and possible further
reductions in service provision is based on the Government's continued
determination to reduce public spending levels.
Council spending rises are due to be restricted to only 2% next year
with once again no provision being made for staff wage rises.
However, opposition Conservative councillors in Edinburgh have accused
Labour of artificially freezing council tax levels last year in advance
of the local elections and raiding the reserves. They recalled that, as
a result, they had warned of big rises to come in 1996-97.
The new Scottish unitary councils could get an indication of their
base budgets when Cosla meets the Scottish Secretary next month but will
have to wait until after the November Budget to learn the level of grant
and spending targets being set by the Government for 1996-97.

MORE than 200 houses are to be built in four communities across the
Highlands and Islands at a cost of more than #10m, it was announced
yesterday.
The two Government organisations behind the developments said they
would be the first of many such schemes and would lead to the economic
regeneration of the areas.
The projects involve housing, light industry, and community facilities
on the island of Raasay, off Skye, in Lochboisdale, South Uist, in the
Pulteneytown area of Wick, and on Bute.
They are being funded jointly by Scottish Homes and local jobs
agencies, under the ''umbrella' of Inverness-based Highlands and Islands
Enterprise. Building will start at the Lochboisdale site later this year
and the first occupier is expected to move in next year, with all four
projects completed in three years.

SIR Bruce Pattullo, Governor of the Bank of Scotland, yesterday
questioned the quality of corporate governance in the privatised
companies which have made ''excessive'' pay awards to directors.
He also fired a broadside at stock options granted to often newly
appointed directors of privatised utilities, which produce windfall
profits for the recipients when the shares start trading at a premium.
His attack came as the Shadow Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, was warning
that the controversy over boardroom greed was getting worse and
executives of privatised utilities had more than #100m worth of share
options waiting to be cashed.
Mr Brown warned that public disquiet over the scale of ''abuse'' was
set to grow unless the Government took action.
Sir Bruce's comments were made during and after the bank's 299th
annual meeting in Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel.
Reacting to speculation that the Greenbury Committee, which is looking
at the issue of directors' pay, might come out against stock options,
Sir Bruce stressed that Greenbury and the Government had to draw a
distinction between option schemes which rewarded loyal and effective
service and those which created windfall profits.
Sir Bruce said: ''It is the windfall profits for a few individuals at
the point of privatisation that are getting up people's noses.''
Earlier, responding to an overwhelmingly defeated resolution aimed at
regulating directors' pay at Bank of Scotland, Sir Bruce told the small
shareholder who tabled the motion: ''I think we all have some sympathy
with the thrust of your general criticism of some of the excessive pay
awards that we see elsewhere, particularly amongst some of the more
newly privatised companies, perhaps even raising questions about the
quality of corporate governance in those corporations.''
In Parliament, Mr Brown told the Commons Employment Select Committee
that, despite the huge outcry over the pay and perks of executives, top
bosses in utilities were still being given huge pay rises.
He said that the top five executives at National Power had received
pay rises averaging 17% last year, and had made #4m worth of profits
between them by exercising executive share options.
''The National Power results, published yesterday, show that they have
learned nothing and are not responding to the public's outcry. The
evidence is that things are getting worse,'' said Mr Brown.
Executives of privatised utilities have made #30m profit from share
options over the past two years and still have more than #100m of income
still to come from options yet to be exercised, said Mr Brown.
He urged directors of privatised utilities to show ''self restraint''
by not exercising their options and said no more executive share options
should be issued because of the controversy.
Meanwhile the Bank of Scotland itself came under fire from some
proprietors (shareholders) who objected to a move which will prevent
individual shareholders putting forward resolutions for future annual
meetings.
With the changes proposed by the bank having been passed at an
extraordinary meeting which followed the annual meeting, small
shareholders wishing to table a resolution will have to secure the
backing of another 99 like-minded proprietors.
Defending the changes, which bring Bank of Scotland into line with
Companies Act practice, Sir Bruce highlighted the danger of future
annual meetings being hijacked by pressure groups which could until now
have generated publicity for a particular cause celebre by purchasing a
single share.
Activists have already disrupted bank meetings south of the Border by
chaining themselves to the speakers' platform and having to be removed
bodily.

Shell shock
statement
This is the text of Shell UK's statement in full:
''Shell UK Ltd still believes that deep water disposal of the Brent
Spar is the best practicable environmental option, which was supported
by independent studies.
''Shell UK obtained the necessary permit for disposal from the UK
authorities, which have handled every aspect of the approval process in
accordance with established national and international policies and
standards.
''As the disposal involved the Atlantic deep water, other governments
have taken an interest and voiced strong objections. Notwithstanding the
efforts to convince these governments of the validity of the approach,
most of them remain strongly against deep water disposal.
''The European companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group find
themselves in an untenable position and feel that it is not possible to
continue without wider support from the governments participating in the
Oslo-Paris Convention.
''Shell UK has decided to abandon deepwater disposal and seek from the
UK authorities a licence for onshore disposal. This application for
onshore disposal will include a further review of methods to minimise
the risks involved.
''The way forward will require the co-operation of all concerned, in
particular the support of other governments in securing the availability
of a deep water safe anchorage for Brent Spar in the immediate future.''

A GERMAN helicopter pilot who allegedly dropped two Greenpeace
activists on board the Brent Spar oil installation, appeared yesterday
from custody at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.
Mr Uwe Lahrmann, 39, faced charges of endangering his helicopter and
the people inside, and four ships and their crews accompanying the
former tanker loading buoy.
His defence lawyer challenged the competency of the charges and the
jurisdiction of the court, and Sheriff David Bogie fixed a hearing to
discuss this submission for August 11.
The sheriff released Mr Lahrmann on bail but made it a condition that
he should not approach within 500 metres of the Brent Spar by aircraft
or any other means.
The charges, brought under the Air Navigation Order, 1995, and the
Civil Aviation Act, 1982, allege that Mr Lahrmann recklessly and
negligently acted in a manner likely to endanger his helicopter and
anyone inside it, and two vessels and their crews towing the Brent Spar,
and two stand-by boats and their crews which were accompanying it.
He is alleged to have repeatedly circled in the neighbourhood of the
Brent Spar, attempted to land persons and drop packages on it, and to
have flown the helicopter through jets of water being deployed by the
two stand-by boats over, on, and around the installation.

CAMPAIGNERS were celebrating one of the biggest victories for people
power seen in recent times.
No consumer-led boycott in history has produced such a speedy and
dramatic result.
Down the years, a number of firms have felt the sting of public outcry
-- but none has reacted so suddenly.
Barclays Bank came under enormous pressure to end its involvements in
South Africa in the 1970s.
Student-led protests went on for years.
Opposition to nuclear weapons and whaling has been handed down through
the generations.
Most recently, the huge outcry over live animal exports has failed to
stop ships leaving British ports on a daily basis.
Currently, campaigners are fighting a host of firms on a range of
issues.
They are targeting airlines which carry live monkeys, credit card
firms which have allegedly worsened Third World debt, and drug companies
over alleged animal testing.
However, few have caught the public imagination and many have little
hope of success.
The Consumers' Association, which has never called for a boycott, said
last night Shell's shock reaction was probably unique.
''I can't think of any kind of campaign that has really compared with
it,'' said a spokesman.
''I would think it's got to be a first.''
Mr Derek Prentice, former assistant director of the association and
now an independent consumer affairs specialist, agreed.
''There has never been a successful consumer boycott in this
country,'' he said. ''The problem with boycotts has traditionally been
that you only need a few hundred people to keep buying something and
sales stay high.
''I think the really important thing with Shell was not the public
outcry or the consumers who took action but that individual governments,
who can make life very difficult for Shell in terms of licences to
operate and so on, objected.''

THE number of homes affected by negative equity increased by more than
200,000 in Britain in the first quarter of 1995, latest Government
figures disclosed last night.
In Scotland, the number of homes affected has rocketed from 8520 in
last quarter of 1994 to 53,000 in the first few months of 1995. Only
Wales and the West Midlands have seen a drop.
The news, in a Commons written reply by junior Environment Minister
Robert Jones, comes amid growing Tory calls for Government action to
boost the housing market.
South-east England still had the largest number of households where
the borrowing on the property was higher than its current value.
About 1000 homes in Northern Ireland are affected, compared with 1060
in the previous quarter. The UK figure is 886,000 (677,440).
The value of negative equity rose from #2.589bn to #3.292bn.

THE Prime Minister suffered another astonishing setback yesterday when
he was wrong-footed over the Iraq arms affair by Labour leader Mr Tony
Blair in the Commons.
Mr Major was attempting a ''pre-trial'' of his Ministers involved in
the notorious affair.
The latest undenied leak from the draft findings of Sir Richard Scott
-- the lawyer who is finalising a three-year inquiry -- states three
Government Ministers ''deliberately'' misled the Commons about a change
of Government policy. An arms export ban was weakened to favour Saddam
Hussein in his war against Iran.
Mr Blair yesterday demanded Mr Major commit himself to sacking these
Ministers in support of the Scott inquiry. The Prime Minister could only
condemn the leak as ''malicious''. Mr Blair warned that, if Mr Major
rejected the Scott findings, ''you will put the final seal of contempt
on a disintegrating Government''.
Mr Blair said: ''Do you recall that shortly before the Scott inquiry
you said Parliament had not been misled deliberately or otherwise and
the guidelines over the sale of arms to Iraq had not been changed after
1985? Is that still the Government's position today?''
The Prime Minister retorted that he had set up the Scott Inquiry so
that he might examine whether or not that was correct. He refused to
comment until he had the full and final report of Sir Richard Scott, not
now expected until September at the earliest.
This latest leak of the Scott draft findings shattered the Prime
Minister on a day when Shell had totally undermined him by its reversal
of its decision to sink the Brent Spar oil installation. Mr Major had
defended the original Shell decision to sink it in 6000ft of water in
the North Atlantic as ecologically sound.
The effect of both events yesterday in the Commons further reduced
Tory morale and caused a cursing of Mr Major's desperate luck.
The Labour leader had roasted him on the issue involving at least
three Government Ministers in the Iraq arms inquiry. Mr Blair: ''If you
say you have to await the report, can we have your categorical assurance
that, if the report does find that Parliament has been misled, you will
abide by its findings and act on them?''
Mr Major: ''I have made it clear in Questions of Procedure that
Ministers who deliberately mislead Parliament should resign, except in
the very exceptional circumstances of a devaluation. The Lord Callaghan
example is a case in point of that.''
Lord Callaghan, as Labour Chancellor, resigned because he told the
House that there would be no devaluation of the pound, knowing that a
devaluation was inevitable.
Mr Major clung to the concept that the Scott inquiry leaks were
''malicious''. He said: ''They are intended to blacken Ministers' names
before they have responded to a provisional report with which they
strongly disagree. I hope that people in future will see those leaks for
what they are and await the final report from Sir Richard.''
Sir Richard has condemned the leaks which some people believe are
intended to discredit his whole inquiry. Yesterday, he promised to track
down the culprit.
At stake are the careers of Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave,
Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell, and the reputations of former
Ministers Alan Clark and Lord Trefgarne. The Scott draft sent to these
individuals states: ''Answers to questions in both Houses of Parliament
failed to inform Parliament of the state of Government policy. This
failure was deliberate and was the inevitable result of the agreement
between the three junior Ministers that no publicity should be given to
the decision.''
Mr Waldegrave denounced the leak as ''wicked'' and proclaimed his
innocence of the charge of misleading the Commons. In Brussels for a
meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers, He said: ''Those who are doing
these leaks are clearly seeking to damage the Government and me and many
other people as much as possible in the fear, I suppose, that Sir
Richard Scott might accept our arguments and change his report.
''They want the damage done now. It is wicked behaviour. I reject
utterly the argument put forward in the provisional report and believe
that I will be able to persuade Sir Richard Scott and indeed the wider
world that nothing like that happened and I believe I will be able to
demonstrate that from the documents.''
He denied misleading the House and said he believed he could
demonstrate why he was wrongly accused. Many of his parliamentary
colleagues accepted he had done nothing wrong, he said.

LABOUR took the unprecedented step of suspending the entire ruling
group on Monklands District Council yesterday in response to the damning
Black Report on misconduct in the local authority.
The speed and severity of the action appeared to catch even Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson off guard. Speaking at a Labour
Party membership drive in Edinburgh, he refused to be drawn on what
measures might be taken over the affair.
As he was speaking, the general secretary of the party in Scotland, Mr
Jack McConnell, was meeting with his London counterpart, Mr Tom Sawyer.
They made a decision which was clearly designed to show how New Labour
would deal with allegations of old-style town chamber favouritism.
Mr Sawyer announced: ''Following the publication of the Black Report
yesterday into conduct within Monklands District Council, the Labour
Party is suspending the entire Labour group on the council.
''Their suspension will be followed by an immediate Labour Party
inquiry into the conduct of these councillors in the light of Professor
Black's report, to be carried out by a national official.''
He went further by warning, that in the meantime, Labour reserved the
right to take further action against individual councillors ''as
appropriate, including expulsion from the party if necessary''.
Monklands Provost Eric Burns said last night: ''I am shocked to find
the entire Labour group has been suspended.''
He said he felt it right that the Labour party must be seen to take
action but he added that he felt the issue was being used as ''a
political football''.
Provost Burns, who took up his post in January this year, and who has
been a councillor since 1980, said Professor Black's report would be
debated at a meeting on Friday. He would only add: ''Let us wait and see
what happens there.''
In the meantime, the administration run by councillor Jim Brooks can
no longer act as Labour councillors. Mr Sawyer also announced an
immediate audit of the membership of the two local constituency parties.
Mr Robertson had earlier referred to the Black Report findings as ''a
catalogue of seedy examples of bad practice'' and he promised swift and
decisive action. However, there was no hint at that stage that
headquarters would move towards immediate suspension.
The suspension was scorned by the SNP, with party leader Alex Salmond
calling it a belated and inadequate response to ''Labour's Monklands
midden.''.
Mr Salmond also said his party had raised the issues since 1989 but
Labour had changed their tune only when they were facing by-election
defeat. He added that local MP Tom Clarke, as defender of the council,
should face suspension too.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace welcomed the suspension
but said: ''The people of Monklands will hope the inquiry is
considerably more effective than the Labour Party's previous inquiry
into this issue, which did little but prolong discontent and division in
the local community.''
Councillor James McGuigan, leader of the new North Lanarkshire
Council, urged all Monklands councillors who are members of the council,
to resign from the new authority if guilty of abusing power.
Mr McConnell made it clear last night the suspensions were the
starting point of Labour's action. The next step would be to consider
which of the group members should be cleared of involvement, and then
warnings, suspensions, or expulsions would follow ''within weeks rather
than months''.
The next stage would be to look at whether any action should be
extended to cover their status as councillors in the new North
Lanarkshire unitary authority.
In the Commons, Prime Minister John Major said to loud cheers from
Tory MPs: ''It's their council run by their councillors''.
When Mr Tom Clarke, MP for Monklands West, who had a question on the
Commons Order Paper to the Prime Minister, rose to ask it, he was
greeted by cries of ''guilty'' and ''Mr Monklands'' and demands from the
Tory side to comment on the report.
Instead, he called for further measures to reduce discrimination
against disabled people, long a topic in which he has taken a special
interest.
Mr Major answered him but added: ''If you are concerned about
discrimination you might also be concerned that people ought not to
discriminate in favour of their relatives on your local council.''
Labour also hit back fiercely against Government claims that they had
suppressed the party's own internal report on the affair.
Mr Robertson declared himself ''astonished'' at a letter from Mr Lang
asking: ''Why did you suppress it? Why did you take no action?''
Had it been passed to him, said Mr Lang, he could have decided if the
evidence warranted a statutory inquiry.
Mr Robertson said the report was published in full in March 1993 and
''has been available to all ever since''.
He also said that he and the late John Smith, former MP for Monklands
East, had consistently called for the Scottish Office to conduct an
inquiry.
One of the four so-called ''rebel'' Labour Monklands councillors from
Airdrie who initiated the allegations against the Labour group, Mr Tommy
Morgan, said last night: ''The disappointing thing is that the four of
us have been put in the same category as everyone else on the group,
although I think they had to suspend all 17 so as not to be seen to be
giving us (the rebels) preferential treatment.''
Council leader Jim Brooks and chief executive Maurice Hart could not
be contacted to comment on the suspensions last night.

OIL giant Shell last night caved in to the massive international
pressure against the dumping of the Brent spar.
In a spectacular U-turn, announced only hours before the disused
installation neared its final resting place, the company unexpectedly
called a halt to the plan.
Despite the company's explanation that the change of heart was forced
on it by other European governments, rather than the seven-week campaign
by Greenpeace, the pressure group hailed it as a victory for the
environment and people power.
The move was widely welcomed by opposition parties who roundly
condemned Prime Minister John Major and the Government for ''standing
alone in Europe'' in supporting a decision that was ''clearly not in the
best interests of the environment''.
This view was not shared by President of the Board of Trade Michael
Heseltine who launched an outspoken attack on Shell for backing down in
the face of protest.
''They have caved in under pressure,'' he told Channel 4 News. ''I
think the Prime Minister has behaved in an exemplary way, and I think he
deserved better from a leading British company.
''I think they should have kept their nerve and done what they
believed was right.'' Shell had ''no sympathy'' from him, he said.
In a statement Shell UK said: ''As the disposal involved the Atlantic
deep water, other governments have taken an interest and voiced strong
objections.
''Notwithstanding the efforts to convince these governments of the
validity of the approach, most of them remain strongly against deep
water disposal.''
A Greenpeace spokeswoman countered: ''It is a victory for us but more
importantly it is a victory for all the people who campaigned against
the dumping.''
There are now suggestions that the platform may be towed to Norway to
be broken up although it is possible the operation could take place in
north-west Scotland.
Western Isles Labour MP Calum Macdonald, one of the leaders of the
campaign against dumping Brent Spar, has already called for an
investigation to be made of the suitability of Kishorn, the west coast
former platform construction yard, for such work.
Energy Minister Tim Eggar warned that the Government would not
automatically issue permission for the Brent Spar to be broken up on
land.
He said the Department of Trade and Industry had accepted proposals
for deepwater disposal after three years of talks.
''If Shell wishes to propose an alternative course of action the
Government will consider it,'' he said.
''That proposal will have to contain solutions to the problems which
led to the identification of deep sea disposal as the best practicable
environmental option.
''Until solutions acceptable to Government departments concerned have
been found, no agreement on abandonment will be available.''
Out in the Atlantic personnel on board the flotilla of ships were
shocked at the news. The reversal at such a late stage in the dumping
operation caught both Greenpeace and Shell crews unawares.
Brent Spar, a 14,500tonne loading buoy, was only hours from its
intended final resting place 6000ft under the Atlantic when the
climb-down was announced.
Soon after the announcement came the protesters occupying the Brent
Spar could be seen setting off flares. Crew members on board the
Greenpeace vessels Solo and Altair were said to be ''delirious'' with
joy and were reported to be hugging and kissing each other.
The standby vessels spraying Greenpeace vessels and the Spar with
water cannon turned off their hoses and foghorns blasted from the Solo.
One of the activists on the Spar contacted by radio with the news
said: ''I don't know if we can get better news than that. We're a bit
speechless.
''We don't normally win things do we? That's great! We're going to put
the kettle on.''
The German sea captain who was a central figure in the Greenpeace
campaign against dumping the Brent Spar last night offered to work with
Shell to find a better way to get rid of it.
Mr Ulrich Jurgens, 42, campaigns director for Greenpeace
International, said in Lerwick, Shetland: ''It's not a victory against
Shell or the British Government. It's a victory for the sea. We're all
willing and eager to work with the industry and the Government, to find
the real best practicable environmental option for solving this
problem.''
Shell UK chairman Dr Chris Fay said last night the company's decision
to abandon deep-water disposal of the Brent Spar had nothing to do with
protests by Greenpeace.
''I can say quite unequivocally it has nothing to do with the four
Greenpeace people sitting on the Brent Spar,'' he told a news conference
at Shellmex House, in London.
''We have spent quite a bit of time rescuing Greenpeace people in and
around the Spar in recent weeks, and if you don't believe we take safety
in the widest sense of the word, you don't understand.''
He admitted though that the company had been embarrassed by the
affair.
The company maintained that deep-water disposal was the best
practicable environmental option supported by independent studies.
However, it said it would now seek a licence from the UK authorities
for onshore disposal.
The question now arises where a suitable deep-water site exists to
store the Brent Spar in the short-term.
The only places in Europe with deep enough water to take it in would
be the fjords of Norway, which has not so far indicated any willingness
to harbour it.
As news of the U-turn swept Westminster, Shadow Scots Secretary George
Robertson led demands for a Government statement. Liberal Democrats
environment spokesman Matthew Taylor called the U-turn a ''triumph for
the environment movement and the general public and a total humiliation
for the Prime Minister''.
A Downing Street spokesman said the Brent Spar decision was ''a matter
for the company''. The Prime Minister had the previous day strongly
defended the Atlantic dumping as the best method of disposal.
Government sources pointed out that Shell UK had not altered its view
that disposal in the Atlantic was the preferable but had taken account
of public reaction.
Before the decision was announced Liberal Democrat leader Paddy
Ashdown asked Mr Major in the Commons if he proposed to deal with the
other 50 or so rigs waiting for disposal. Mr Major replied that each
would be dealt with on a case by case basis.
The Prime Minister strongly denied that Government scientists had
warned against dumping the Brent Spar at sea.
Mr Major insisted at Commons Question Time that the views of Ministry
of Agriculture Fisheries and Food scientists had been ''completely
misreported''.He said a leaked paper ''expressly did not apply to deep
sea disposal, which is what is proposed''.
Shell's climbdown was welcomed in many parts of Scotland last night.
Mr Lewis Smith, convener of Shetland Islands Council, congratulated
the company for listening to public opinion and responding positively.
''In Shetland we have always been aware of the fragility of the sea,
whether the North Sea or the Atlantic, both of which provide a living
for our fishermen.
''Our council will maintain pressure on the relevant authorities for
the safe and complete removal of the infrastructure necessary for the
offshore oil industry,'' he said.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said it was a famous victory for Greenpeace
and the environmental movement.
He called for an independent organisation to oversee the
decommissioning of offshore installations as they become redundant.
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald said he did not think any oil company
would now dare to dump a platform at sea. ''Shell's about-turn is a
terrible embarrassment for the Prime Minister who just hours before was
against defending the dumping at sea decision,'' he said.
The MP added: ''For a #30m saving in disposal costs Shell has
attracted hours and weeks of the worst publicity any multi-national
company has had. Even before it decided the about-turn the battle had
been won. No other company is going to put its head into such a
noose.''He said the Government's defence of sea dumping had been absurd.
''Recycling the metal on the Brent Spar would be the equivalent of 400
million beer cans. How can the Government ask people to recycle their
beer cans for environmental reasons when they are prepared to support
such environmental waste?''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said he was pleased that
Shell had finally ''seen sense''. He added: ''The idea that dumping
Brent Spar in the Atlantic would have no serious environmental
consequences was ridiculous.
''John Major has now been made to look extremely foolish having stood
in Shell's corner over the matter.''
