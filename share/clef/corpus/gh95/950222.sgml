GREGOR Townsend has been called many things in his short rugby life.
The 21-year-old Edinburgh University politics student and now Scotland
centre-threequarter made his senior debut for Gala as a 17-year-old
Galashiels Academy schoolboy.
He was hailed then as a footballing prodigy. Blessed with the kind of
intuitive skills not found in any coaching manual, he was likened to a
young Andy Irvine. The epithet, though, was double-edged.
Like Irvine, the teenage Townsend was able to turn a match with a
streak of champagne rugby which came close to genius.
But, again, just like the former Scotland and British Lions full back,
he was prone to the kind of absent-minded error which induced mass
groaning on the terraces.
There was the pass that he threw out to the intruding Philippe
Saint-Andre during last season's encounter at Murrayfield which allowed
the French captain to scorch home for a try. Then there was his first
Test nightmare in Argentina last summer which induced coach Dougie
Morgan to break the first unwritten rule of the coaches' manual by which
he publicly singled out Townsened for post-match criticism.
Morgan declared that Townsend's performance that afternoon in Buenos
Aires had been ''shocking''. Townsend, from his preferred position at
fly-half was back in the midweek team at centre, but he redeemed
himself, still within a losing side, at stand-off for the second Test a
week later.
That criticism still hurts, the Gala student maintaining that the
quality of ball which he was being provided in the Buenos Aires Test was
well short of par. Townsend, though, is one of that rare breed of
players who must be allowed scope for failure. Such is the depth of his
natural talent and such is the mercurial nature of his skills that he is
always going to land team-mates, coaches, and supporters in the queue
for the coronary care unit.
But he is always liable, too, to set a match alight with a touch of
pure genius. On Saturday, in Scotland's heroic victory over France at
Parc des Princes, the Jekyll and Hyde nature of his play was there for
all to behold.
He scored a virtuoso try by dint of some rare footballing skill --
technique honed as a promising soccer player with the Hutcheson Vale
Boys' Club in Edinburgh -- when he toe-poked a loose ball before
cradling it up to scorch over the French line. That was Dr Jekyll at his
best.
Next came Mr Hyde. A rushed kick to touch let Saint-Andre, young
Townsend's bete noire from Murrayfield a year previously, rush in for
the try.
Yesterday, over lunch in Edinburgh, Townsend reprised the moments in
Paris which led to him re-assuming Dr Jekyll guise. ''Gavin gathered us
behind the posts as the French were taking the conversion. I was really
down. Gavin said that we were going to get right back up there and score
a try. He looked straight at me and said 'OK Gregor'. I just nodded.
''When I got the ball and went for the gap I heard Gavin shouting
behind me. I just held the ball out to him with my right hand and he
took it at pace. After that I was unsighted and when everything went
quiet I thought at first that he hadn't scored. But that was just the
reaction of the stunned French crowd. When he put over the conversion to
give us the lead I was so relieved,'' said Townsend.
The Gala youngster, who is virtually certain to pursue his
post-university rugby and career prospects in England with Ian
McGeechan's Northampton next season, spoke yesterday of his feelings
when things don't go quite as he had planned on the rugby field.
''Well, I think that too much is made of my capacity for making
errors. I don't think that I've made that many really. Maybe, though,
because I want to make things happen on the pitch they are more obvious
than with other players.
''When they do happen, though, I'm always looking to redeem myself.
Sometimes the ball doesn't come your way and it's not possible. I don't
tend to worry much during the game itself. If you did then your play
would just go to the dogs. You just have to be patient and hope that you
will get the chance to make amends.
''I think I'm a bit of perfectionist, though, and during the week
after a match I'll be thinking of the things that I could have done
better,'' he said.
It was the Boroughmuir winger, Derek Stark, who coined the term
''Toonyisms'' for the brainstorming moments in Gregor's career. ''In my
first season in senior rugby I was in the Scotland B team and I wasn't
happy with the way that I played. I think, though, that I've improved
since then.
Townsend, in addition to his gift for rugby, also possesses the rare
gift of being able to see himself as others see him. ''A couple of years
ago during the build-up to the World Cup Sevens I was in the Scotland
side at Dubai. I passed the ball straight to an Englishman. I thought he
was a Scottish player despite the fact that he was wearing white. I
maintain to this day that it was a desert mirage.
''Doddie Weir has even started calling me a 'space cowboy' because of
the way that I'm quite often late for team meetings and things like
that. Coming from Doddie that really is the pot calling the kettle
black.''
Townsend broke through into the senior Scottish ranks in 1992 during
the Scotland tour to Australia. He was a boy among rugby men and did not
make the Test sides. ''But it was a great experience to be out there
with the Scottish team. These guys were my heroes and there I was in the
same team as them.''
His international debut came the following season at Twickenham and it
did so in the most inopportune of circumstances. Craig Chalmers broke an
arm and Townsend went on as a replacement. He went to outside centre in
a side which went down 26-12.
He was ever present throughout the following Five Nations' season but
still appeared often to be ill at ease in the centre. His natural
instinct is to go for the gap but, too often, it seemed that he was
caught in two minds, choosing the safety-first option.
Now, as he gains in confidence, his natural game is re-asserting
itself. ''The gaps do exist in international rugby but you have to be
confident enough to go for them.''
Those who saw Townsend playing summer rugby in Australia for Warringah
have never doubted his talent and now that latent self-belief is
beginning to blossom in Scotland colours.
When he leaves university at the end of this summer Townsend hopes to
pursue a career in merchant banking or corporate finance. He has tried,
unsuccessfully, to secure employment in Scotland and has a number of
interviews lined up down south, one of which is with Societe General,
sponsors of Saturday's international in Paris.
''I would like to stay in Scotland and to continue playing for Gala
but I have to think of my career as well. I have signed provisional
forms with Northampton and, just now, that looks like the most likely
option.
''I've not totally decided yet what I am going to do, but Gala know
the situation and they understand. I've no doubt, though, that if and
when I do come back to Scotland then I'll still want to play for Gala. I
just couldn't see myself turning out for any other club.''

THEY used to say, but wouldn't dare to now, that behind every
successful man was a good woman. It is certainly true that behind most
good ministerial performances there is a group of good briefers.
Ministers spend much of the morning of the day on which they answer
Commons questions being briefed on what they are likely to be asked and
what they should reply.
The toughest job is briefing the Prime Minister. The initial question
to him is usually general -- what are your engagements for the day? The
follow-up supplementary can be about almost anything.
The briefers are good. If a Labour MP lets the Prime Minister have it
about job losses in his constituency, Mr Major can often respond by
reminding him that total unemployment in his constituency has fallen by
x per cent over the last six months, year or whatever.
Last week, Mr Blair not so much caught them out as stumped them with
the one asking the Prime Minister if he agreed with his Chancellor that
adoption of a single European currency had no constitutional
implications. Barred from saying that of course he didn't and the
Chancellor was talking through his hat, Mr Major was forced into blatant
and embarrassing evasion.
The briefers would have seen it coming, but could think of no form of
words that would carry conviction in a Question Time atmosphere. Mr
Blair therefore drew blood.
Yesterday, the briefers saw that the Health Authorities Bill was down
for debate later and estimated that Mr Blair might seek to give his
side's attack a fillip by raising health with Mr Major.
Mr Blair has a maximum of three questions, and the usual tactic is to
draw the Prime Minister into an early reply which leaves him vulnerable
to the second or third follow-up question. This time, it did not work
out quite that way.
Mr Blair opened by asking for confirmation that since the health
reforms began, administrative costs had risen by more than #1bn.
The Prime Minister replied, in effect, that once you have decided that
the NHS should know more accurately the cost of the services it provides
you need more people to count them. A fair reply, but accountants will
never seem as worthwhile as nurses.
Mr Blair followed up with a neat enough sound bite about the
difference between what Government Ministers say about the health
service and people's experience of it. He then said, you've got it, that
people would prefer the #1bn spent not on accountants but nurses.
So far, Mr Blair was winning hands down, as he must have expected he
would. However, the No. 10 briefers had unearthed one of the reputable
British Attitudes surveys which showed that since the reforms the number
of people satisfied by the NHS had, ''leapt,'' said Mr Major, by 20% and
nine out of 10 thought the service was satisfactory or better.
Letting Mr Blair have the second barrel, he produced a recent survey
of doctors which found that the overwhelming majority of them felt
health needs had been better met since the reforms and a 2-1 majority
felt competition among hospitals had improved the service.
Kicking his man when he was down, Mr Major suggested that the patient
and doctor respondents knew more about the health service than Mr Blair.
Mr Blair, rather like a fighter rising on the count of nine, wondered
rather feebly why, if the NHS was that good, deputy Tory chairman John
Maples had said the party should seek zero coverage of the service.
Mr Major brushed Mr Maples aside, produced a flurry of record-breaking
services and ended by recalling unkindly that the last Labour Government
was the only one ever to actually reduce NHS resources. It was a
knock-out punch but much of the credit want to the anonymous figures in
his corner.
Just before confronting the Prime Minister on the Government's health
service record yesterday, Labour leader Tony Blair visited London's
Guy's Hospital -- which is threatened by changes in health provision.

EXCLUSIVE:
SCOTLAND'S rugby players, fresh from their historic victory over the
French on Saturday, look set to give their coaches a share of the money
generated for the players' pool. The pool benefits from fund-raising
activities undertaken by squad members, and also receives a proportion
of some of the sponsorship money received by the Scottish Rugby Union.
National coach Douglas Morgan, a chiropodist at the Jenners store in
Edinburgh, says the true cost of being the coach of Scotland's rugby
team is far greater than anyone could imagine. ''Every time I take a day
off to be with the team I lose money,'' he said. ''Before each
international match I have to take two days off work, and although I get
the two payments of #40 and #22 per day as compensation, that in no way
makes up for what I forego in loss of earnings.''
He added that the World Cup in South Africa this summer, in which
Scotland are drawn alongside France, will place greater financial
strains on his family. ''When I go to South Africa with the team in the
summer I will find things hard because I will be away from my work for
so long,'' he said. ''In fact, my wife, Doreen, who is also a
chiropodist and already has a part-time job, will have to work in my
place at Jenners to help us make ends meet. It has definitely come to
the time when nobody should lose money when they are on international
duty. I know that the coaches sharing in the players' pool has been
talked about behind the scenes, but nothing further has come of it. But
I can see it happening.''
The Herald can also reveal that last season the average squad member
received #675 per game before agent's commission and tax, whereas that
sum was reduced to #300 a man for the game late last year against the
touring South Africans. Neither Morgan, nor his assistant, Richie Dixon,
received any similar payment.
Iain McLauchlan, the former international prop who is the players'
agent, said he hoped that this will change, ''I agree with Douglas
Morgan, and it is a collective decision among the players to decide who
shares the money.
''They all work together, and I hope that it is in place for the World
Cup.''
Gavin Hastings, Scotland's try-scoring captain in the Paris win, also
said he had no objections to Morgan and Dixon sharing in any squad
payout. ''I am very happy and relaxed about it,'' he said. ''The coaches
are a crucial part of the whole squad effort.''

Scotland B 3, N Ireland B 0
SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown could not have scripted this match much
better.
He had named beforehand the players he hoped would prove themselves at
this level -- and one of them was Hibs' striker Darren Jackson.
In the fifty-sixth minute he produced a moment of magic, a memorable
goal, which showed that he has the temperament and the skill to make it
into the full international arena.
Indeed, it was a night for Hibs fans to celebrate yet again following
the weekend victory over Motherwell in the Scottish Cup. Last night they
saw Steven Tweed score the first goal and another local hero, Jackson,
add the second. The third was scored by Aberdeen's Stephen Wright.
Brian Martin and Brian O'Neil were the other main men mentioned by
Brown for the European championship clash against Russia in Moscow. They
were not tested by the Irish but still came through comfortably, and
always looking to begin the attacks from the back which Brown insists is
the way forward for the team.
Brown confirmed afterwards that Jackson had substantiated his claims
for a place in the side for Moscow next month. He said: ''Jackson scored
a sensational goal and I think that he is a big performance player. Alex
Miller confirms that to me.''
Said Jackson: ''It was a very good goal but I'm still taking nothing
for granted. What I want is to continue to impress with my club
performances and convince the Scotland manager I should be in the
side.''
There was little early on to excite the 4000 fans. But in 35 minutes
there was a real chance when Jackson sent in a cross from the left and
Paul Lambert was there to meet it. The Motherwell man's header beat
Irish keeper Allan Fettes but smacked against the foot of a post.
By then part of Brown's plan for the match had gone wrong. Nicky
Walker had been forced to limp off and allow Steve Wood of Motherwell to
come on, instead of the keepers being on for a half each.
However, just on half-time Scotland went in front. There was a piece
of magic from Lambert which deceived the Irish defence. He played the
ball into goal, Tom Brown's shot was blocked, but Tweed was somehow up
there to force the ball over the line from close range.
At the start of the second half Brown brought on Billy Dodds and Colin
Cameron for Brown and Lambert.
Scotland began to dominate and Jackson's spectacular goal soon
arrived. He got a ball 25 yards out, brought it down with his left foot,
and then volleyed it home with his right.
Brown continued to change things. Rob McKinnon went off and Chris
McCart came on, and in 65 minutes there was another goal. A marvellous
passing movement involving Jackson and Dodds eventually found Stephen
Wright in a wide position and he scored with an angled shot.
SCOTLAND B -- Walker (Partick), Wright (Aberdeen), McKinnon
(Motherwell), Tweed (Hibernian), Martin (Motherwell), O'Neil (Celtic),
Lambert (Motherwell), Rae (Millwall), Brown (Kilmarnock), Jackson
(Hibernian), McGinlay (Hibernian).
NORTHERN IRELAND B -- Fettis (Hull), Wright (Norwich), Rowland (West
Ham), Dunlop (Crusaders), McGibbon (Man Utd), Matthews (Rochdale),
Morrow (Rangers), Sonner (Erzgebirge Aue), O'Boyle (St Johnstone),
Lennon (Raith), Finlay (Doncaster).
Referee -- D Elleray (England).

GEORGE Graham, one of only a handful of individuals capable of
maintaining a significant Scottish influence south of the Border, was
sacked yesterday after an eight-and-a-half year reign as manager of
Arsenal. The Scot was shown the door, disgraced after the findings of a
special inquiry into allegations that he had accepted almost #300,000 as
part of a transfer deal had been made known to the north London club's
board of directors.
Arsenal dismissed the most successful manager in their history only
hours before last night's 1-0 victory against Nottingham Forest. Chris
Kiwomya, one of Graham's last signings, was the scorer in 81 minutes.
Immediately, however, the search for a successor was under way,
although Graham insisted last night that he would ''vigorously contest''
his removal.
The investigation focused on the transfer of Danish internationalist
John Jensen to Highbury in 1992. It was alleged that Graham received a
payment of #285,000, but he claimed it was a gift from Norwegian agent
Rune Hauge and says he returned the cash to Arsenal.
Graham's assistant Stewart Houston, a fellow Scot, was installed as
interim manager and will be in the reckoning for the job on a permanent
basis. However, he will face stiff opposition from a long list of
candidates which will include Rangers' manager Walter Smith if Arsenal
are still of a mind to maintain a Scottish connection.
His reputation is known in the south and it would be no surprise at
all if Arsenal were casting envious glances towards Ibrox where Smith
has shown himself to be a winner. Also, and perhaps significantly given
the traumas and controversies which have plagued the premiership side in
recent years, a manager with Smith's image holds great appeal.
His style is low key, but effective, leaving his players to do most of
the talking. He is articulate and politically correct, which would be in
keeping with the Arsenal tradition.
There are parallels between Rangers and Arsenal right down to the
marble staircases. Rangers had legends in management like Bill Struth
and Arsenal had their own in the shape of Herbert Chapman.
Arsenal, who may have been shamed by brawling players, Tony Adams'
incarceration, Paul Merson's drink and drug problems, and now the
allegations which suggest Graham may have acted improperly, need to
portray a different image. Smith has not had his problems to seek
because of wayward players at Ibrox, but always he presents a dignified
front.
Also, he has behind him an array of trophies and is currently
shepherding a crippled squad towards a seventh successive premier
division championship.
Other candidates include former Rangers player Ray Wilkins, now
player-manager of Queen's Park Rangers, Bobby Gould, Joe Kinnear, Ray
Harford, former Highbury favourites Pat Rice, Liam Brady, and David
O'Leary, and also Steve Coppell, who was one of the members of the
Premier League Inquiry which reported their findings to Arsenal.
Apart from having lost his job, Graham must wait until later in the
week before being told whether or not there will be further punishment.
His employment was terminated by unanimous decision and Arsenal's board
said the inquiry were happy with the action taken.
The premier league's chief executive Rick Parry will meet with Sir
John Quinton, chairman of the board of the FA Premier League, to
consider the next move before reporting to a meeting of clubs tomorrow
morning. ''The FA Premier League is determined that all necessary steps
will be taken to ensure that the game is clean. The integrity of
football is of paramount importance,'' said Parry.
The Premier League have also been investigating transfer deals
concerning other Scandinavians and Parry, Robert Reid QC, and Coppell
recently flew to Norway to continue their work.
Graham believes he was entitled to better treatment after his long
association with Arsenal, and called for a ''full and open inquiry by
the FA.'' He broke his silence through his London-based solicitors after
Arsenal's chairman Peter Hill-Wood claimed Graham had not acted in the
best interests of the club.
''I have made the welfare of Arsenal my sole objective for the
eight-and-a-half years I have been manager,'' he said, ''and my track
record shows my success.
''The allegations are nonsense. I deeply regret that this kangaroo
court judgment should have been reached in such a hole-in-the-corner
way. My record of loyalty and service demanded better treatment.
''I believe this matter should be fully investigated by the Football
Association. What is the future for football if the standards of justice
inside the game can be ignored in this way?''
Graham said there was little more he could say on the matter because
of the action he intends taking to clear his name, but he did add: ''I
appeal to all right-minded lovers of the great game of football to press
for a full and open inquiry by the Football Association.''
However, it is as Hill-Wood said. It was a sad end to Graham's contact
with the club.

THE arbitration tribunal to decide how much Celtic will have to pay
Kilmarnock for the loss of Tommy Burns and Billy Stark will meet on
Monday, March 20, one day before the clubs meet in a league match at
Rugby Park.
Only 10 days before that game the clubs will play at Hampden on
Friday, March 10, in their Tennents Scottish Cup quarter-final, which
will be televised live on Sky (kick-off 7.30). There is also the
possibility of a replay at Rugby Park the following Wednesday.
Spice has been added to the encounters because of their proximity to
the tribunal, which will be chaired by Lord Ranald McLean. Celtic had
indicated that they would be unwilling to go along with the tribunal's
decision, but they have since agreed that the ruling will be final and
binding.
It is thought that Kilmarnock are seeking about #350,000 and have
probably based their calculations on the #250,000 which Celtic paid
Stoke City by way of compensation when Lou Macari was brought to Celtic
Park as manager.
But Celtic chief executive Fergus McCann does not feel compensation
should be paid when a manager leaves one club and goes to work
elsewhere. However, the Scottish League have already fined Celtic a
record sum of #100,000 for having induced Burns to leave and Kilmarnock
have been in dogged pursuit of what they see as justice.
The quarter-final between Hearts and Dundee United will be screened
live on Sunday, March 12, from Tynecastle at 3pm.
Local police have given the go-ahead for Stenhousemuir to stay at home
for their quarter-final against Hibernian, and the Ochilview club can
expect another 3500 all-ticket sell-out.
The tie will be played on Saturday, March 11, the same date as Raith
Rovers against Airdrie.

THE applause finally subsided yesterday. George Graham, a realist
whose work allowed others to dream, probably knew it was over back in
November of last year when allegations that he had accepted #285,000
from a #1.1m transfer deal first made the game's bushwire sing.
The Scot, who became the most successful manager in Arsenal's history,
had looked comfortable fronting one of the biggest cubs in British
football. He had the panache of a cosmopolitan which hid a toughness
acquired during a childhood in Bargeddie, a small community just outside
Glasgow where Vinny Jones and Eric Cantona would have been allowed only
to hold the jackets.
Graham had studied the history of Arsenal and harboured the notion of
one day seeing a bust of himself occupy a space beside that of Herbert
Chapman, the club's legendary manager, in the marbled hallways of
Highbury. Chapman will continue to stand a lonely sentinel studying all
who enter the front door.
Yesterday, he watched Graham leave in disgrace, his integrity and his
future in doubt. The euphoria of a European Cup-winners' Cup triumph
against Parma last year a distant memory of a good life.
Graham leaves Arsenal in a mid-table position in the premiership and
just nine days before the first leg of the club's European Cup-winners'
Cup quarter-final against Auxerre, of France. His dismissal came after a
Premier League Inquiry informed Arsenal of the outcome of their
investigation into alleged irregularities of certain transfer dealings.
It was only eight days ago Graham was allowed to spend #2.5m on a
Dutch internationalist, Glenn Helder, who made his debut last night
against Nottingham Forest, but while he tried to make it look as though
it was business as normal he was, in fact, hovering close to the exit.
It was typical of Graham, who was known as Stroller in his playing days
because of the imperious manner with which he patrolled a midfield, that
he should retain his cool to the end.
''This is a sad day in the club's history,'' said Arsenal chairman
Peter Hill-Wood, who made the fateful announcement which ended Graham's
eight-and-a-half year reign as manager of the London club. It was a
short statement, but more than enough to damage the reputation of a man
who rose from the muddy environs of Bargeddie's brickwork park.
The chairman paid tribute to 50-year-old Graham, whose contract had
two more years to run, for the success he had brought the club, but that
won't matter if and when he decides to seek employment elsewhere within
the game and neither will much credence be given to his pleas of
innocence.
There has been speculation about his #300,000-a-year job since
November when it was alleged that he received payment from the transfer
deal which brought Danish international midfield player John Jensen to
Highbury in 1992.
Graham claimed the money was a gift from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge
and said he returned the cash to Arsenal. ''I have made no money from
transfers,'' he insisted.
His association with Arsenal spanned 15 years and, while he may have
strolled through as a player, his time as manager was not always so
easy. There were good times and bad as controversy accompanied his
success.
He succeeded Don Howe as manager in May 1986 after having learned the
managerial ways during a spell with Millwall. He took over in 1982 and
directed them into the old third division the year before Arsenal
decided he would be their man.
Graham had travelled a long way to the top, starting off as a raw
player with Aston Villa before Chelsea's manager, Tommy Docherty, bought
him for #6000 in 1964. Arsenal recognised his value in 1966 when Bertie
Mee paid #50,000 to take him to Highbury for the first time and he was a
vital influence on the side which won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup four
years later. The League and FA Cup double was achieved the following
season.
With two Scottish under-21 caps to his credit, he made his senior
debut in a match against Portugal in 1972 and went on to collect 11 more
caps, the last four of which were awarded after he had teamed up with
Docherty for a second time. This time Docherty took him to Manchester
United.
He went to Portsmouth two years later and completed his playing career
by helping Crystal Palace win promotion to the old second division in
season 1976-77. When he had thrown the boots to the back of the cupboard
he worked as a barman before returning to football as a coach with
Queen's Park Rangers and then Palace.
From Selhurst Park Graham found his way back to Highbury via Millwall
and a contract believed to be worth #300,000 a year. Now it has all gone
and Graham, much wealthier but on the outside looking in, must decide
where he goes from here.
However, apart from the Cup-winners' Cup win in Copenhagen he leaves
behind an impressive list of achievements which will be difficult to
follow. Under his guidance Arsenal won the Littlewoods Cup in 1986, his
first season as manager, and three seasons later the club won their
first title in 18 years when Michael Thomas scored a dramatic winner in
injury time of the final match of the season at Liverpool.
In 1991 they became champions again losing only one league match in
the entire season and, two years later, Graham's side won a historic FA
Cup and Coca-Cola Cup double beating Sheffield Wednesday in both finals.
Always, though, controversy dogged the manager.
Paul Davis was fined #3000 and suspended for nine matches after he had
broken the jaw of Southampton's Glenn Cockerill in 1988, and in 1989 and
1990 Arsenal were involved in on-field brawls with Norwich City and
Manchester United respectively.
Graham's captain, Tony Adams, was jailed for 56 days in 1991 after a
drink-driving conviction, Wrexham humiliated them in the FA Cup the
following year, and several months ago Paul Merson confessed to alcohol
and drug abuse. It was then alleged Graham accepted what is known in the
business as a ''bung.''
When his directors failed to back him publicly earlier this month it
was clear his days were numbered.

* RANGERS' worries mounted yesterday in the wake of their Scottish Cup
defeat by Hearts at Tynecastle, with both goalkeeper Andy Goram and
striker Mark Hateley facing London visits to specialists today.
Goram returns to hospital for an X-ray to determine whether he needs
an operation on his damaged calf-muscle. Hateley will find out if he
needs surgery on a deep-seated groin injury.
If operations are necessary, manager Walter Smith will find his
depleted first-team squad further weakened, and both players could be
ruled out for the rest of the season.
Up front, Rangers have been handicapped with nagging injuries all
season. Ally McCoist won't be back for several weeks after having
clashed with Dundee United keeper Kelham O'Hanlon in his comeback two
weeks ago, and Rangers could be left with only Gordon Durie as a
recognised front man.

Dundee United 1, Falkirk 0
IF captains are supposed to lead by example, Maurice Malpas did his
duty to some purpose at Tannadice when he scored the goal that lifted
his team out of the demotion zone in the premier division, at least for
the time being. He left it a bit late, but his strike three minutes from
the end left Falkirk with no room to reply.
It was a bit harsh on the Falkirk side who had worked so hard to take
something home in the bus, other than disappointment.
Perhaps United were marginally better than their rivals overall, but
the visiting side put in such staunch efforts after the interval in
particular that they were entitled to a point as reward.
United move into fourth-bottom place and keep up the frisky February
promised by manager Ivan Golac. So far they have drawn with Rangers at
Ibrox, got through two rounds of the Tennents Scottish Cup, and moved
away from the relegation department.
They were never at their best last night, but had some good players in
David Hannah, Malpas, and Billy McKinlay.
Falkirk had the best man on the field in Steve Fulton and a whole lot
of willing helpers, but they missed a couple of crucial chances and that
proved their undoing.
Golac admitted his team had won without playing well, but it was a
furious Jim Jefferies of Falkirk who promised a new striker for his team
shortly.
''We'll have to do something about the chances we're missing. We did
it again tonight when we played well, showed commitment, but failed to
put the ball in the net. I'm very hopeful we'll get moves started
tomorrow to bring a goal scorer to the club.''
He may have been referring to Joe Allon of Port Vale, a forward he has
been trying to bring north for some time.
Maybe he just wanted to keep the Brazilian, Sergio, company, but the
sight of Brewster, a braw lad from Dundee, wearing gloves was
unexpected. The sight of a penetrating, superb pass from Billy McKinlay
is familiar enough at Tannadice, however, and he delivered one of his
best when he sent Jim McInally clear on the left.
The low cross from McInally was cunningly placed between the keeper
and Joe McLaughlin, with Sergio challenging. McLaughlin managed to
intercept the ball and lay it back to the arms of his keeper, although
the referee, Tom Brown, who had substituted for late call-off Ian
Taylor, did not see it as an attempted pass-back.
Sergio, who was involved in much of the early action, almost snatched
a bizarre goal when Falkirk keeper Tony Parks ran out to clear a
pass-back and hit it straight at the Brazilian. Fortunately for the
keeper, he was able to reach the rebound before the striker and make a
proper job of the clearance.
The next time we saw Sergio in the spotlight he was being booked for a
foul from behind on Clark.
David Weir has his name taken after kicking the ball away early in the
second half, and McDonald was shown the yellow card when he protested at
another decision by the referee.
Oliver, of Falkirk, and Petric, of United, went into the referee's
book as the frustrations of both sides began to show.
Falkirk almost grasped the goal they were now seeking eagerly when
Henderson lobbed the ball over the outrushing O'Hanlon only to see it
slide inches outside a post.
In 82 minutes, United made the switch that was to make the difference,
Dragutin Ristic replacing Sergio.
The new man made a telling intervention five minutes later when he
headed a McKinlay cross back in front of goal, where Malpas hit a left
foot shot high into the net.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, McInally, Malpas, Hannah, Petric, Welsh,
Bowman, McKinlay, Sergio, Brewster, Dailly. Substitutes -- Ristic,
Nixon, Garden.
FALKIRK -- Parks, Weir, Johnston, Oliver, McLaughlin, Clark, May,
Henderson, McDonald, Fulton, McKenzie. Substitutes -- Rice, Shaw,
Lamont.
Referee -- T Brown (Edinburgh).

TOP Olympic and UN officials yesterday appealed to athletes around the
world to join the fight against drug abuse by teaching youth the
positive values of sports.
At the conclusion of a two-day conference in Rome, the International
Olympic Committee and the United Nations' Drug Control Program expressed
their commitment to fight drugs, organise drug-prevention programs and
promote sports activities.
''We call upon the athletes of the world to make a decisive commitment
to protect our youth from drug abuse and misuse, and we invite them to
disseminate this message through the sport events in which they take
part,'' read the appeal.

HAD to smile the other morning when the spokesman for Bookmakers'
Against Coronation Street popped up on the old wireless. No, I kid you
not -- our brave lads with the boards and satchels are very upset about
the way they are being portrayed in the nation's favourite soap.
A character named Sean Skinner, who runs the betting shop on the
Street, is threatening to break young Steve MacDonald's legs if he does
not cough up the two grand he owes. Even worse, the sex-mad Sean is
trying to have it off with Steve's long-legged mother, Liz.
I mean, would you Adam and Eve it, a turf accountant with a heart of
steel and hands that go all over the course? The bookies should
definitely be consulting their briefs.
Actually, I have a confession to make; I quite like bookmakers, at
least the ones who stand in all weathers at Scotland's tracks, because
they are usually scrupulously honest and they manage the odd smile when
they have to pay out. Without them racing would be a much duller sport;
even with them it is not doing all that well at attracting new recruits.
Attendances fell at race meetings in Britain last year. While it is
hoped that Sunday meetings -- long overdue -- will reverse that trend,
there is genuine concern about the pulling power of National Hunt
events, which are suffering partly because of the spread of all-weather
tracks which mainly specialise in Flat racing.
It would be tragic if there were a decline in jump races for they are
the traditional life-blood of the sport. For me, the Derby holds few
thrills; the Grand National, and even more so the Cheltenham Gold Cup,
are the ''creme de la creme,'' the courage of horse and rider to be
cherished.
But, even with syndicates, there are not enough owners prepared to
risk their cash -- it can cost more than #10,000 a year to keep a
steeplechaser in training -- on horses which can be badly injured in an
accidental fall. Fewer horses means less prize-money and a threat to
smaller tracks. It is not much of an adventure to visit a meeting where,
out of six races, there are three odds-on favourites, and that happened
in Scotland last season.
Can the decline be arrested? I think there certainly are steps which
can be taken to improve the situation.
For a start we could do with better commentaries. Surely I am not the
only one who is irritated by course commentators who think by shouting
they can conceal their ignorance of what it actually going on.
Perhaps they, and the punters, require horses to be more clearly
identified. Putting the name of the horse or the jockey somewhere where
it can be seen is hardly impossible.
A friendlier atmosphere would help, too. Do we need all those
different enclosures, suggesting there is one area for the toffs and
another for the riff-raff? I have never known specators at racing to
cause the slightest trouble, even when the Stewards have behaved with
remarkable insensitivity.
Is it not possible to have broadcast interviews with trainers,
jockeys, and maybe even bookies, between races? A lot of corporate
clients come to racing for the first time and would not know whether 5-2
was the odds or the starting time.
Kelso is my favourite track and, while the horses are in the ring, the
announcer chats away informatively, providing facts that are not
included in the programme.
One of the major problems of racing is the half-hour gap between
anything happening. Trainers tell me they cannot unsaddle one mount,
prepare another, meet with owners and instruct jockeys in much less
time. On dismal days, this can seem a very long 30 minutes.
I think it could be shortened but, if not, I would urge the racing
authorities to provide some alternative entertainment during the breaks.
A band, a pony race, even a few Frank Sinatra tapes would be better than
nothing.
Even more would be added if horseracing and greyhound racing could be
combined. Edinburgh, it would appear, is about to lose its dog track at
Powderhall.
Would it not be possible for greyhounds to be raced up a straight 600
yards at Musselburgh race track? That would surely provide an extra
incentive for punters, more revenue for the track and a pot of gold from
which funds could be made available to improve facilities.
Such a scheme, which need not be confined to Edinburgh, would bring a
smile to the face of Sean Skinner.

CLAIRE Waddell disproves the theory that full-time is best. After a
year playing squash in Belgium, she returned to college this season, and
is confidently looking forward to collecting her sixth Scottish Grand
Prix title in this weekend's Stewart Milne Construction North of
Scotland Open in Aberdeen.
The 19-year-old won her first Scottish Championship in December, while
her sole domestic defeat came from world No.16, Senga Macfie, in the
Lothian Open final in December.
Waddell more than made up for that loss with the Scottish Championship
win the following weekend, and the pair should have another intriguing
clash if the seedings work out this weekend.
''I've really enjoyed my squash this season,'' said Waddell, who has
been in the Scottish senior team for the past three years. ''I'm
enjoying studying at Aberdeen College, it's nice to have something else
to do.''
Playing on the world circuit does still have its attractions, but
adding to her qualifications remains the priority. ''I want to go to
University, although once I have a degree I may think about giving it a
go as a full-timer.''
Oban's Martin Heath, ranked No.36 in the world, is also in the midst
of his best season, and is hoping to fend off the English raiders in the
North Open this weekend.
Tony Hands and Paul Gregory, ranked 17 and 18 in the world, are the
top two seeds, with Jonathan Lilley rated 3/4 with the Scot.
Heath has already had a boost this week with direct entry into the
32-man main draw for the #40,000 Andersen Portuguese Open in Lisbon at
the start of next month.
It is the first time he has avoided having to qualify for a major
event, and he will join world No.5 Peter Nicol, who reached the
semi-final last year, as a strong Scottish double threat.

<TEXT>
A NEW penalty structure designed to rid racing of non-triers by
introducing bans for racehorses was granted final approval by the Jockey
Club yesterday.
To be introduced tomorrow week, it will provide local Stewards with
more power to deal with offences. Jockeys will risk bans of up to two
weeks for offences that previously incurred fines.
And now horses involved in any attempt to deceive the handicapper or
set up a future coup can be suspended for 30 days. The guilty rider will
also be banned and the trainer fined.
Most concerned by the proposals were the Jockeys Association, which
claimed their members were being singled out.
Jockeys Association joint-president John Reid said: ''In our opinion,
not that much non-trying goes on, but jockeys involved in any schooling
in public are doing so under instruction.''

AS FAR as Scottish rowing is concerned, it would appear that charity
no longer begins at home, writes Mike Haggerty.
Because of lack of interest from the clubs this year, Glasgow
University has been forced to cancel their traditional Charities
Regatta, an event which, for decades, has been run to raise money for
the students' annual charities appeal. The event due to take place this
Saturday, but when entries closed last weekend only Strathclyde
University and Heriot-Watt University had put forward crews, a total of
18 in all, which was much too small to make the event viable.
Strenuous efforts by the organisers to drum up more interest have
failed completely, leaving the University club with no option but to cut
its losses and cancel the event for this year.
In former years, the Glasgow clubs in particular entered eagerly into
the spirit of the event, raising substantial funds in the process.
In order not to disappoint the two university clubs that had taken the
trouble to enter, Glasgow University intends to organise an informal
low-key event at Glasgow Green on Saturday.

JIM Bett yesterday paid tribute to Tommy McLean for talking him out of
retirement and putting him on the trail of a fourth Scottish Cup
success, writes Ian Broadley.
The veteran midfielder quit Scottish football last season,
disillusioned at the decline in playing standards, and, having ended his
career with Aberdeen, he accepted a player-coach post with KR Reykjavik
in Iceland.
But the 36-year-old revealed yesterday, after having inspired Hearts
to a quarter-final place with a thrilling win over Rangers: ''Tommy kept
in touch constantly and finally got me to change my mind.
''I am delighted he was so persuasive, because there is now the very
real chance of winning another cup medal -- something I never thought
was possible when I walked away from the Scottish game.
''The manner of our win over Rangers will provide us with a lot of
confidence for the quarter-final. When they came back to equalise after
being two down, we could have folded.
''It was a test of our character and we came through with flying
colours. For that you have to hand the credit to the manager.
''In a very short space of time he has transformed Hearts. He has made
seven or eight changes and has the team playing a passing game.
''When you talk about managers, then he is an example to the rest. It
is all too easy to buy million-pound players.
''Tommy won promotion with Morton and he won the Scottish Cup at
Motherwell -- incredible feats considering he had to operate under
strict financial controls.
''Right now he is doing very well and there is a belief within the
club that we can win the cup this season.''

THERE is not a vindictive bone in Dave McPherson's considerable frame,
but he must have enjoyed a quiet laugh at the expense of that section of
the Rangers' support who hounded him so viciously during his second
spell with the Glasgow club.
That period ended earlier this season when McPherson took the
inter-city route back across the country to start his second term at
Tynecastle.
The other night saw the 6ft 3ins tall centre half inspire his team
towards the already-famous Scottish Cup win over champions and
tournament favourites Rangers.
This time, if the Ibrox supporters were venting their spleen on the
31-year-old McPherson it was, as he pointed out, for ''the right
reasons.''
Yesterday he admitted: ''There is a certain part of me which says it's
good to shut up some of these people who tried to give me a hard time.
But, really, I have never felt it was as bad as maybe other people
thought.
''I was able to handle it, I think. Now it is all in the past in any
case. I have spoken to young players about what happens when the time
comes for you to leave a club where you are happy.
''It has happened to me three times now because I didn't particularly
want to leave Ibrox to start with and then I settled in happily at
Hearts before going back to Rangers.
''Basically, there is no point in looking back. You don't have time
for that in football. A couple of years back I scored for Rangers
against Hearts in the semi-final at Parkhead and it was Rangers who went
on to win the Scottish Cup.
''This time I have scored against Rangers and helped set up another of
the goals and that's just doing my job. I can't think about my time at
Ibrox any more. It is more important to prove that there is life after
Rangers.
''I think I was able to underline that fairly adequately the other
night . . .''
There is little doubt about that. Those people in the Ibrox stands who
took to blaming all the defensive frailties of their team on McPherson
will recognise that more than most as they look at a season which has
only the title left for their team to win.
Meanwhile, McPherson agrees with the bookmakers who have not rushed to
make Hearts favourites following their 4-2 victory. He said: ''It would
be daft to start believing that we can now just simply go on and win the
trophy. Things don't work out that way.
''All we have done is defeat the favourites, Rangers. Now we have to
go on to prove that we can do better. Perhaps we can. I would like to
think that we are capable of winning the cup.
''However, we have the holders, Dundee United, in the quarter finals
and they won't make it easy for us at all. The one good thing, though,
is that the match is at Tynecastle and United don't have the greatest
record in the world at our place. But it would be wrong if we were to
think the way some of our supporters were thinking after the game --
that we have won the trophy already. That isn't the case.''
It was yesterday before McPherson was able to admire the killer fourth
goal which was scored by Kevin Thomas. He set it up but didn't see the
finish by the youngster until he saw the match highlights on television.
He added: ''My own goal was more simple. Craig Moore seemed to lose
the ball in the lights for a moment. That is something which can happen
at Tynecastle and I felt sorry for him but when the ball came back over
the goal it was a simple nod in for me from my favourite three yards'
range.''
It all sounds so simple. Yet it ended Rangers' Cup dreams and gave
Hearts the boost that their new board and manager have needed as they
attempt to re-build a team and a stadium.

WORLD boxing's biggest puncher, Gerald McClellan, simply cannot
conceal his thrill for the knock-out.
The 26-year-old challenger for Nigel Benn's WBC super-middleweight
title in London on Saturday yesterday issued the chilling warning:
''It's a great feeling to me of knocking men unconscious and watching
them fall. I enjoy the feeling better than sex.''
He has stopped 20 men in the first round -- including three WBC
middleweight title defences -- and plans to add a world
light-heavyweight title to the WBC middle and super-middle crown which
he is favourite to take from Benn.
Victory for another middleweight, Commonwealth champion Richie
Woodhall, over Italy's Silvio Branco tonight in the vacant European
middleweight championship encounter at Telford will guarantee him a shot
at the winner of next month's WBC title bout between big-punching former
holder Julian Jackson and Agostino Cardamone in Boston.
Woodhall has home-town advantage as he bids to break Italy's six-year
monopoly of the EBU middleweight crown.
The last Briton to wear it was Herol Graham, who later was only
minutes from becoming world champion in 1990 until knocked cold by
Jackson, who held the world title until Benn's Saturday foe, McClellan,
wrenched it away in an explosive Las Vegas bout 21 months ago.
Branco, 28, has won 24 of 26 contests (one draw), with the sole loss
against compatriot Cardamone three years ago.
Billy Hardy cut Ghana's Percy Commey down to size to retain the
Commonwealth featherweight title in front of his home-town fans in
Sunderland last night. Hardy stopped the tall and awkward former
champion in the eleventh round.

COMMONWEALTH gold medallist Richard Corsie was the man of the moment
in Preston yesterday.
Just a few hours after having been named as successor to David Bryant
in the world bowls players' association, Corsie continued his bid for a
record fourth win in the #132,000 Churchill Insurance world indoor
singles championship with his second successive straight-sets win.
Following his first-round demolition of Russell Morgan that included
three world records, Corsie swept aside the challenge of Australia's
Cameron Curtis 7-5, 7-4, 7-4.
The Edinburgh man raced to a 6-0 lead in the opening set but Curtis
hit back. ''The opener could have gone either way. Cameron came back
well and I was a bit fortunate to win it,'' said Corsie later.
The Scot continued to dominate the second set moving 5-1 ahead before
wrapping up a 7-4 victory and in the next, with the scores tied at 3-3
he counted a decisive 3 on the fifth end.
East Lothian's Graham Robertson and Dunfermline-born Hong Kong man
Mark McMahon saw their pairs hopes end at the quarter-final stage when
they went down in straight sets to six-times former winners Bryant and
Tony Allcock.
The Scots led 5-3 after five ends of the opening set but successive
doubles gave the former champions a 7-5 win. Bryant and Allcock again
came from behind in the second and, helped by a maximum 4 on the fifth
end, edged home 7-6 and they repeated that scoreline in the third set.
''The match was a lot closer than the scoreline suggests -- all three
sets could have gone either way,'' said Bryant.
McMahon said: ''We can't have any complaints. I had chances to
capitalise on promising positions and didn't do it.''

TRUST the English to appoint a canny Scot to control the distribution
of more than #2000m in sport funds.
As a lad with rural Aberdeenshire roots, Mike Barron used to organise
main events for the Young Farmers' Club at the Royal Highland Show --
but now he is ringmaster in a far bigger circus, controlling the destiny
of England's sporting proceeds from the National Lottery, #150m this
year, #260m next, and projected to reach #1600m annually by the year
2000.
Barron could be described as the biggest lottery winner to date. For
his appointment, by the English Sports Council, as director of their
lottery sports fund, gives him the power to call the major shots for a
revival in Britain's sporting fortunes.
''It is perhaps the greatest opportunity that any one person has had,
to influence the future direction of sport in the UK,'' said Barron, who
until recently was chief executive of Gordon District.
Alford-born Barron will advise his joint-chairmen, Trevor Brooking and
Gerald Dennis, on the merits of the flood of applications for lottery
largesse -- 15,000 enquiries to date, 4000 information packs out to
prospective applicants, and 383 completed applications returned.
Backed by a staff of 43 at the council's London headquarters, Barron
is already assessing their value, and the first awards will be made
before the end of March. Scotland will also make their first grants next
month.
Already 41 different sports, in all 46 of England's counties and
shires, have lodged applications. ''Everything from aerobics, through
netball and scuba diving, to water skiing,'' said Barron. ''Including
sailing clubs, new sports grounds, gymnastic equipment, and disabled
sport, there are 27 multi-sport projects. But two-thirds of applications
are for schemes costing less than #100,000, and only 14 are in excess of
#1m. So you can see the main beneficiaries are likely to be at the grass
roots.''
No British sports administrator in history is likely to be subjected
to greater lobbying than that facing the 53-year-old Scot.
Iain Sproat, the heritage minister, already has suggested the lottery
should fund a national stadium and centre of excellence in England.
On the face of it, an admirable idea. But if control is vested in the
English Sports Council, it will become an English centre of excellence,
one from which Scots would almost certainly be excluded given English
myopia.
Far better if such a centre were run by the new UK Sports Council, a
distinction of which Barron, who served his time in the youth and
community service in the Highlands and Islands, is far more likely to be
aware than any English appointee.
Under the Lottery Act the four national sports councils are prevented
from soliciting applications for projects. ''We must be independent, and
free from prejudice,'' insisted Barron. ''I am aware of Mr Sproat's
suggestion, but cannot confirm whether he has initiated any enquiries
with us about plans for a national arena, or centre of excellence.''
Well, perhaps not yet, but you can bet it will not be long in coming.
And with Sproat, a Scot, nationalistically challenged in his lobbying
for such facilities for England, is it not time that Sir Hector Monro,
the Scottish minister with responsibility for sport, did likewise here?
Even the revamped Hampden is a midden compared with major stadiums
across Europe.
Barron plays this suggestion with a straight bat, just as he does the
next ball, namely my assertion that he is fighting Britain's sporting
decline with one hand tied behind his back.
Only capital items can be funded by the lottery, and, save for
exceptional circumstances, 50% of funds for each project must come from
independent sources, for example local and regional authorities, or
private enterprise, who, having built must charge economically viable
rates to the detriment of elite sports clubs.
The British Olympic Association, and Scottish Sports Council, are
adamant that the lottery rules should be amended to allow support for
elite sport, referred to in official jargon as performance and
excellence. Indeed, the SSC held an open forum on the subject on Monday
at Murrayfield. They believe, rightly in my view, that it is nonsense
for top sportsmen to be starved of funds to chase success at the highest
level.
Until recently, before adopting the role of poacher turned gamekeeper,
Barron was a member of the SSC -- its longest-serving member -- and
supported this thesis, though once he thought the council lived ''in an
ivory tower.'' So presumably he would welcome changes in the lottery
rules, changes which its critics believe are inevitable?
''I could not possibly comment on that,'' said Barron.
But when, rather than if, the change is made, the former Inverurie
Academy boy will not be found wanting. He has always been an innovator,
prepared to make things happen. As director of leisure and recreation
for 11 years in Monklands, one of his successes was in giving birth to
bowls as a TV sport, making Coatbridge the home of the world
championships.
He approached 37 companies before Embassy agreed to back the event,
but he still had to convince Malcolm Kellard, then BBC sports editor,
and Pat Chalmers, head of TV in Scotland, that the sport was television
material.
''I admit to some good luck,'' he said. ''All football and racing was
cancelled on the first weekend of the world bowls, and the event was
networked -- it never looked back. But it was crucial that we changed
the format, to a single rink, and persuaded Scottish bowling to accept
coloured shirts and other innovations which are now standard.''
Having succeeded with a sport as conservative as bowls, Barron looks
like the man to jack up England's sporting needs. But Scotland needs a
similar rub of the green.

NOT long ago, two spectators detached themselves from the group
following a match in the first round of the Madeira Open. Their
withdrawal from the scene left three, as it were, reserves in attendance
and there was at least one of them who had no difficulty in feeling
comfortable with the shrinkage and the even more unrestricted view of
the play.
To be sure, at an altitude of almost 3000 feet on an island not
exactly inflamed with indigenous passion for the game, rampaging hordes
were not expected to materialise. In fact, this occasional European Tour
camp-follower was quite beguiled by this throw-back to less disciplined,
more relaxed, ways of watching golf.
Walking down a fairway to follow the progress of leading players
involved an intimacy of association which ropes, fences -- and, for all
anyone knows, electrified wire -- have, over the last 30 years, all but
destroyed. Henry Cotton used regularly to have his heels trodden on and
his shoes detached from his feet by over-enthusiastic spectators.
Now, by contrast, there are professionals whose audio-sensitive organs
are so finely-tuned that they are able to detect the rustle of a
toffee-paper at a range inaudible to a bat. As to their reaction when
they come into dispute with what constitutes line-of-sight relief, and
are denied justice, their sense of outrage is almost tangible.
Sometimes, the reaction of some professionals to a large and lively
gallery seems so hostile as to reinforce the belief that if every
tournament was played behind closed doors the better they would like it.
Exchanging the hurly-burly of the paid admission for the deep peace of
the exclusion zone, so to speak.
The compulsion for the spectator to be close to the player may, in the
professional game, have a peculiarity similar to that deployed by the
autograph hunter. Merely to have stood within touching distance of the
incredible object of desire is all the justification that is needed for
a signature on a scrap of paper.
Not being possessed of access to satellite television's coverage of
the early-season European tournaments, this unreconstructed terrestrial
viewer must rely for this comment on his occasional visits to a Merchant
City hostelry to make sense of their appeal. It has to be said that the
pulse was not exactly racing at wrist and throat.
Much has been made -- and rightly so -- of the expansion of the
European Tour during the first four months of the year. As an example of
creating job opportunities few other sports, if any, can match it. But
there is a down-side to this worthy development. The surface image does
not always necessarily convey the underground message.
Indeed, the cathedral-like silence in which these mid-winter
tournaments are usually played in Spanish, Portuguese, and North African
territories makes such a negative impression that the worth of
televising them at all has been questioned. The almost total absence of
atmosphere certainly leaves the players to draw inspiration from each
other.
It is, apparently, not unknown for television directors to cajole
technicians into contributing applause for a good shot which otherwise
would have been acclaimed with the equivalent of the definition of
Existensialism: ''You know the sound made by two hands clapping, but
what is the sound made by one hand clapping.''
As test-beds for developing tournament careers these events are
invaluable and as Ken Schofield, executive director of the PGA European
Tour, has reasonably said: ''I would rather have tournaments with no
spectators than no tournaments and no spectators.'' So, without
question, would the players.
The problem is that golf is still far from being ingrained in the
sporting culture of the continental countries, which has always made
questionable the preference for Spain over Ireland as the next European
host of the Ryder Cup match. Without the instinctive British (and Irish)
interest and support, Valderrama would qualify for the Rev Sydney
Smith's description of the countryside -- ''a kind of healthy grave.''

THE worst thing anyone can do, according to Save &amp; Invest, is to
commit sums of money to PEPs or any other plans without taking
professional advice.
Save &amp; Invest's Hope Street shop is a client-friendly environment in
which to discuss such issues and Jeffrey Deans and his staff can use or
recommend any PEP product available.
''We look for pure fund management groups with proven records, says
Deans. ''We also advise a spread of investments, over two or more funds,
rather than put all one's eggs into one basket.''
This was one of the reasons for the establishment of the Scottish PEP,
introduced by Save &amp; Invest in order to allow people to choose from the
investment funds of leading Scottish-based fund management groups within
the one #6000 general PEP.
Specifically, it offers the chance to split the #6000 into four groups
of #1500, investing in any combination of SVM, Murray Johnstone, Martin
Currie, Abtrust, Dunedin, Baillie Gifford, Glasgow Investment Managers,
Edinburgh Fund Managers, and Ivory &amp; Sime. It all depends on whether one
wishes the accent to be on growth or on income, and Save &amp; Invest advise
accordingly.
Also, the normal 3% entry charge is reduced to 2% for Herald readers
until the end of the current tax year.
Save &amp; Invest also has the choice of all other PEPs on the market,
including the highly popular M&amp;G PEP and others which it has no
hesitation in recommending. It does, however, have reservations about
the performances, potential, and charges of some other products and this
is where the value of professional advice comes in.
Jeffrey Deans is in no doubt about the place of PEPs. ''Once an
investor has ensured that enough capital is held as a cash and emergency
fund, PEPs are the logical next step,'' he says.
''They offer tremendous tax advantages and can be used for a variety
of purposes, and by people with many different requirements.''

OPPORTUNITIES have to be taken when they arise, and anyone
contemplating a Personal Equity Plan at the moment should note two
things: that the tax year ends in a matter of weeks, and that two
particularly attractive new PEPs are available to those who act quickly.
March 1, says Jeffrey Deans, managing director of Glasgow-based Save &amp;
Invest, is the final date for applications for Schroder's Income Builder
and a week later is the deadline for Henderson Touche Remnant's
Accelerated Income PEP.
Each has slightly different emphasis when it comes to income and
growth. Both are recommended by Save &amp; Invest, which specialises in
assessing fund managers, charges, performance potential, and income
records.
Investment trust PEPs have outperformed unit trust PEPs down the years
and Jeffrey Deans points out that there could hardly be a better time
for a new fund to assemble a portfolio.
The market is down between 12 and 13% from this time last year, and
Deans forecasts a strong recovery in the next 12 months, so this appears
an ideal time to buy. Also, the two new funds in question are charging
neither entry nor exit fees.
Schroder's track record is a fine illustration of how a managed
stock-market fund can generate excellent income along with substantial
growth. For the past 15 years Schroder has had a Unit Trust Income Fund.
A #6000 investment in 1979 would have yielded income of more than
#12,500 to 1994, with the capital having grown, as at December 2, to
#42,000. As a comparison with a building-society investment, if that
society had been able to give an average of 10% over these years, the
income would have been only #7500 and the capital would still be the
original #6000.
For the year 1993 alone, that Schroder investment would have paid
income of #1392.66 net of basic-rate tax.
It is reasonable to expect the new Schroder fund to perform at least
as well.
And as part of the launch offer, investors are being allowed to invest
in a 1994-95 PEP for this tax year and take one out for the 95-96 tax
year.
That means that if the market were to grow substantially in the next
year, the investor gets the full benefit. He or she can also pull out at
any time, taking the tax-free profits.
Schroder's Income Builder is aimed at a 4.5% income initially, with
the accent on growth and consequently higher income later. The new
Henderson Touche Remnant PEP is aiming at 7.5% income, with lower
growth.
Jeffrey Deans considers it advisable to get the best of both worlds.
The HTR fund, like Schroder's, is free of entry or exit fees and offers
the same opportunity to use both the 94-95 and 95-96 PEP allowances.
He cites the example of a couple with cash to spare and able to invest
their maximum allowable #6000 each for each of the two tax years in
question. That would total #24,000, split between the two new funds and
yielding an average of 6% income (nearly 1.5% above what would be
available from a building society) with very acceptable capital growth
into the bargain.
That 6% would yield #1440 of spendable income, compared with the
building society's #1100. And with no exit charges, the investor can
withdraw his or her cash at any time.
So what's the catch? ''Stock markets are not guaranteed investments,''
says Jeffrey Deans. ''There is the element of short-term risk.
''But down the years, the figures speak for themselves and tell a
story of strong growth and excellent income yields, by far outperforming
the record of building societies.
''Right now the market is down, and one would expect it to rise again
soon. This is a good time to take advantage of the conditions, and here
we are with two new PEPs on offer, with all the tax advantages they
bring and being launched by two companies with proven track records.
''It does seem a time of golden opportunity, and those who do not have
a PEP would be well advised to make sure they act in good time.''

<HEADLINE>Farmers welcome High Court decision on partial disposal. Retirement relief victory</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>VICTOR ROBERTSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979730570</RECORDNO>

FARMERS who dispose of only part of their business as a prelude to
retiral may benefit from a recent High Court decision in England.
The court's finding recognises that a farming enterprise may be made
up of several businesses and retirement relief can be claimed on partial
disposal, say accountants Kidsons Impey.
The decision could have a substantial bearing on the position of dairy
farmers who may be considering taking advantage of the current buoyant
market for milk quota but wish to remain on the land.
In past years some farmers have experienced difficulty in obtaining
capital gains tax relief when disposing of part of a farm. The Inland
Revenue has sought to withhold relief unless at least half of the land
was sold.
In the case at issue the farming operations had consisted of both
dairying and store cattle. The farmer sold his milking parlour and yard.
During the interval between agreeing the contract for that sale and the
formal completion of the deal the cows were also sold, so that milk
production ceased.
The Inland Revenue argued that the tax commissioners should have
looked at the disposal of the parlour and yard in isolation -- simply as
the sale of an asset and not as the disposal of part of the business.
The High Court, however, accepted the taxpayer's argument that it was
necessary to look at the sales of different assets to establish whether
a business had been disposed of.
Kidsons Impey argues that from the court decision it can be deduced
that a farmer does not necessarily have to make a substantial disposal
of land in order to obtain retirement relief. This point could be
particularly important where milk quota is sold, realising substantial
gains, but the land is retained. Provided the other conditions are met
it appears that retirement relief should be available on any gain
arising from the sale of quota.
Retirement relief is also often a critical factor in lessening tax
liability on the disposal of land which has realised substantial gains
-- for example, where there is development value.
Mr Iain McGuire, Scottish regional tax partner with Kidsons Impey,
said: ''This decision will be welcomed by farmers as it recognises that,
in practice, the disposal of a business may involve a number of separate
disposals of assets taking place at different times.
''It is also commonsense to allow relief where the disposal of land
takes place slightly before the disposal of other assets. It still
remains to be seen, however, whether the Revenue will take it further in
appeal.''
Obtaining retirement relief could still be a battle, which could only
be won by careful planning and critical timing, he said.

BRITISH livestock producers have been given a pat on the back by
consumers for their caring attitude towards animals.
This emerged from the latest annual NOP Survey of UK consumers carried
out by the Danish Bacon &amp; Meat Council which showed a dramatic rise in
the number of people who thought that animals were well treated by
farmers.
Curiously, in view of its leading position in the meat league tables,
chicken emerged as the product most people associated with poor
treatment with a 37% share of respondent's concern.
Only about one in five thought that veal calves were badly treated and
one in eight worried about pigs with lower numbers for beef cattle,
sheep and dairy cows. In 1994 the worries about chicken and veal calves
seemed to remain constant with a rise in concern about pigs, beef cattle
and sheep.
''The research suggests that the UK public is more aware of the issue
generally,'' said Mr Andreas Toft Fensvig, managing director of Danske
Slagterier, the Danish grouping of pig producers, factories and
processing units, at a London news conference yesterday.
''Although sales of free range and welfare meats are quite small,
certainly in the case of bacon, we understand very clearly that animal
welfare is increasingly important to the UK market. Many of our
customers are now sending clear signals to us and, I promise you, we are
taking note.''
About 15% of Danish pig production was now free range and a major
research programme, funded by producers, was now under way to examine
alternative systems and allied welfare benefits.
''The systems must work and must be commercially viable and this of
course means that the consumers who require us to make these changes
must be prepared to accept a higher cost,'' Mr Fensvig added.
Additional consumer research showed that more people were consuming
bacon butties at different times of the day and not just at breakfast
and that more families were returning to the idea of the traditional
Sunday lunch complete with a roast meat. The Danish Bacon &amp; Meat Council
is spending something like #2m to promote these products in the British
market this year.

CHAMPION curler Peter Smith (above), a member of a Perthshire farming
family, has been appointed by Hydro Chafer as area manager for
Aberdeenshire and Angus. He will be responsible for promoting his
company's liquid fertilisers, spraying machinery and range of nutrition
products.
Mr Smith,30, studied agriculture at Edinburgh University before
returning to work on his family's three farms near Perth, centred on
Knowehead Farm, Wolf Hill.
As a curler he competed in the 1988 winter Olympics when curling was a
demonstration sport. In 1992 he won the world fours title in Winnipeg
and currently plays in a four skipped by his elder brother, David. They
are currently setting their sites on qualifying for the 1998 winter
Olympics in Nagano, Japan, when curling will make its debut as an
Olympic sport.

<TEXT>
A RUSH of farmers seeking to buy organophosphorous sheep dips is
expected between now and the end of March when new regulations come into
force. From April 1 anyone seeking to purchase dips will require to hold
a certificate of competence.
Mr Gethin Maddocks, a vet with Mallinckrodt Veterinary, leading
suppliers of dips, said that fewer than 6000 farmers had taken the
certification test so far. As a result they were expecting a high demand
ahead of the deadline.
For broad spectrum prevention and residual control in a single
treatment -- covering scab, blowfly, lice, keds and ticks -- plunge
dipping with OP dips was the only viable option, he said.
Compulsory dipping was abolished in July 1992 and since then research
carried out by the British Leather Council has shown a 40% rise in
damaged skins through parasitic infestation, which is estimated to cost
the sheep industry an estimated #15m a year.
''Unless farmers become more vigilant and concerted action is taken by
all sheep producers, implications for the whole industry are serious,''
said Mr Maddocks. ''Veterinary surveillance at sheep markets has been
increased throughout the UK, and if sheep are removed from stalls for
being diseased the producer could face a fine of up to #5000 per
sheep.''
In addition, he said, there was a maximum fine for irresponsibnle
handling of OP dips, an indication of the importance of certification.''
As an alternative to dipping some farmers have gone over to a system
of injections.

THE Bank of Italy last night raised its key interest rate by 0.75% to
8.25% after the lira plunged to a record lows against the German mark.
The bank's fixed term advances, or Lombard, rate was raised to 9.75%
from 8.5%.
A shock jump in Italian inflation had earlier plunged the lira to new
lows of around 1098.25 lire to the German mark from an opening 1080.30.
The mark remains the pick of the bunch as far as European currencies
are concerned.
It is likely to remain so given that price pressures are starting to
emerge in the German economy which suggests that German interest rates
will not be cut in the near future. The French franc was hit by worries
about the declining prospect of Prime Minister Balladur becoming
President.
Sterling's advance was held back by the strength of the mark but it
managed to recover some of its recent lost ground, its trade-weighted
index adding 0.1 to 87.0. However, its upside is limited by continuing
domestic political worries.
Against the mark it gained almost quarter-of-a-pfennig to DM2.3361 but
was virtually unchanged against the dollar at $1.5820.
The dollar moved in a narrow range ahead of today's policy testimony
from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, although it initially was
boosted by US agreement on aid to Mexico.

THE end of the winter is the best time of year for painting and
decorating. The weather is nasty, so you can get the spring cleaning
which necessarily precedes any serious decorating out of the way well
before spring actually arrives, when you will have much better things to
do.
Superwoman author Shirley Conran suggests that one ought to spring
clean with a friend who will spur you on. Choose one who doesn't talk
too much, and be careful to agree the mutual help on an hourly basis,
since your friend's h ome might be twice as large as yours.
Decide what to clean and what to renew, because it only takes a little
more trouble to paint a wall than just to scrub it, and although paint
costs more than water, it achieves much more exciting results. Late
winter and spring are the best times for decorating because you are past
the danger of choosing the kind of too richly coloured, over-snug scheme
which might tempt you pre-Christmas, and it's much too early in the year
for the summer pastels which will leave you cold when winter returns, as
it inevitably will.
Professional decorating firms can provide palettes of colours and
swatches of curtain fabrics and furnishing textiles which will stimulate
your imagination, and there are some simple rules which can help you
choose a decorating scheme which will be appropriate and enjoyable all
year round. Look at photographs of interiors in the glossy magazines,
buy or borrow some books on interior design, or decide to re-interpret
some favourite room from a friend's home in colours and styles which
reflect your own tastes.
Showhomes at new housing developments are also a source of
inspiration, but most real lived-in rooms could accurately be described
as eclectic, containing in the decor, fabrics and furnishings with
elements from widely different periods in history, alongside modern
pieces and the high technology household goods and leisure equipment --
videos, hi-fis and computers -- which are now a major part of our lives.
A few guidelines help to ensure that the result is an interesting and
stylish mix, rather than an unsightly muddle.
First, establish which qualities appeal strongly to you -- the
colours, shapes and details which you enjoy seeing in a home -- and use
these to give some unity to your decorating scheme. Do a little research
to find out why they developed as they did, and what the philosophies
are behind them. This kind of information is not only very interesting,
it will also help you by making it clear what guiding principles they
have in common.
For example, the arts and crafts movement in interior decor is based
on ideas very similar to those of the International Modern School, so it
makes sense that solid, honest arts and crafts items will not jar with
straightforward, unadorned modern ones. For the same reason, Oriental
things will go well with with either of these styles, but typically
Victorian furnishings, with their emphasis on surface decoration and
curvy shapes, would not.
Early English furniture might also look odd with Georgian or Victorian
specimens, but would sit happily next to a Bauhaus chair or sofa.
Primitive or ethnic artefacts need a suitable austere setting, so don't
try to fit them into a gentle, chintzy country scheme.
Most of the interiors photographed for the up-market glossy magazines,
and also most housebuilders' showhomes, aspire to the decorator look --
they have as their main characteristics co-ordination and attention to
detail. Unlike the homes in which we live , these interiors are
carefully planned and highly designed to create a particular effect --
with every element making a significant contribution to the effect.
Essentially these interiors are concerned with fashion, but they are
also fresh and lively sch emes, using all the latest tricks, techniques,
colours and patterns, and you can borrow all of these ideas for your own
painting and decorating plans.
Check out the elements that make these designs work, and remember that
the walls offer the largest available surface for adornment. For a
really dramatic effect, choose specialised paint effect like dragging,
stippling, sponging or rag-rolling -- a good professional decorating
firm will be able to provide all of these fashionable paint techniques,
and will be able to offer matching or co-ordinating fabric ranges and
wallpapers, to help give the right overall effect.
Professional decorator James Ferguson has noted the trend towards the
use of broken colour effects. ''Sponging, glazing and rag rolling are
very effective when a softer effect is required and can be used either
instead of, or with, finished wallcoverings, '' he said. Having provided
a personal design and colour service to his clients from his Milngavie
base for more than a decade, he has found a niche in the market, serving
customers who appreciate his friendly but professional service and high
quality workmanship. ''Tastes vary enormously from client to client, but
in the past few years we've seen increased demand for traditional decor
styles,'' he explained. ''Friezes, picture rails, dados, and borders can
dramatically alter the feel of a room and a cornice can provide
definition.
''The most important benefit a professional decorator can provide is
an ability to understand exactly what the customer requires, and to
assist them by advising on colours and finishes. It is also important
that the work is completed with the minimum disruption to their
household.'' For full details of the Ferguson decor service, telephone

AS its name suggests, Dawn Homes has brought a welcome freshness to
the house building industry since it was set up in 1991, following the
restructuring of Dawn Construction, the major construction company which
has been in business for more than 22 years. Dawn Homes is an associated
company of the Dawn Group.
From the start, this innovative newcomer has set out to create bright,
new house styles in unusual and picturesque locations, and the quality
of its homes has been paramount.
Finding the best and most suitable location for each and every one of
the company's developments has been very important, and there have been
no compromises.
Whether the site is in the middle of established Victorian villas, or
down by the harbour or in the leafy suburbs of the city, the
developments have been designed to complement the surroundings.
Andrew Reid, the managing director of Dawn Homes said: ''We consider
the quality of the location to be the first essential in choosing a
site, and we think we know what our clients are looking for.''
Dawn Homes' headquarters are at Prestwick, in Ayrshire, and while many
of the company's developments are on the west coast, Dawn developments
are not confined only to that area.
Current developments include one at Broomhill in Glasgow as well as
those at Gourock, Kilmarnock, Prestwick and Ayr Harbour.
Each site has different specifications which demands an individual
approach to the design and style of the houses to be built there.
''If our first condition for building is location,'' explained Andrew
Reid, ''then our second is certainly the need to incorporate house
designs that maximise the opportunities offered by each location.''
This is borne out at Ayr Harbour and Gourock where the developments
overlook the water, while at the development located in a more urban
environment sets out to make maximum use of the surrounding greenery.
The company's latest development in Glasgow is at The Laurels in
Broomhill while further down the coast there are new developments at
Merchants Quay, Ayr Harbour; Cragburn Gate, Gourock; Carrick Court and
Monkton Court, Prestwick; and Brigade Court, Kilmarnock.
Dawn Homes has come a long way in four years, and throughout that
time, it has managed to find and then build on some of the most
beautiful locations in the West of Scotland.

AT Merchants' Quay, South Harbour in Ayr, there are six individual
flat styles, all appropriately named after seafaring vessels, and all
with balconies overlooking the river.
The Schooner, Clipper, Galleon, Barque, Windjammer and Square Rigger
are all two-bedroomed apartments, and each has a large lounge, a fitted
kitchen with oven, hob and washer/drier, and fitted bathroom. Prices
range from #59,500 to #64,500.
The names of the homes at Carrick Court in Prestwick have again been
chosen to reflect the outlook. Arran, Bute, Cumbrae, Ailsa and Gigha,
are one, two and three-bedroomed flats in this development.
Prices start at #43,750 for the Arran, rising to #49,950 for the Bute.
There are 24 flats at the second phase of the Monkton Court
development, also at Prestwick, priced from #52,000 to #84,000.
At Kilmarnock, the former fire station has been carefully refurbished
and converted to offer nine individually styled two-bedroomed flats.
Prices there are from #41,000 to #44,950.

Ross Finlay tries out the Mitsubishi Shogun and finds it an impressive
off-roader
FOUR-wheel drive off-roaders have had a mixed press recently. One 4x4
has been criticised for its lack of stability in certain normal-road
manoeuvres. The Mitsubishi Shogun's popularity among suburban owners has
been pilloried. And there is a widespread assumption that when the next
wave of ''people carrier'' multi-purpose vehicles arrives on the market,
the conquest sales will come from 4x4s.
Taking these things in order, I am sure that, in emergencies, some 4x4
drivers forget that their heavy vehicles, with a high centre of gravity
and inevitably more sluggish responses than an ordinary car, simply
cannot be hauled around in the same way . When you swerve a 4x4 with a
first turn of the wheel, the fact that it takes a second or so longer to
react induces many people to put on still more lock. The result is that
when the required swerve actually happens, another -- and often
excessive -- turn is already coming through the system.
As far as suburban Shoguns and MPVs are concerned, many vehicles which
chunter around on school runs during the week may have to tow boats,
horse boxes or caravans during a family's leisure time. If you want
really good off-road capability, or easy towing, or sure-footed handling
in wintry conditions, a 4x4 will do the business. The Shogun, it is
worth remembering, is the Caravan Club's ''all-terrain towcar'' for
1995.
With production now around the 1.3 million mark, the Shogun obviously
hits the spot for many people who want some or all of those features. At
#35,889, the 3.5-litre V6 automatic Shogun I have been driving is an
impressive off-roader, even if, unlike some of the others, it majors on
power rather than low-down torque. That is not surprising, since the
engine is based on the unit fitted to the 3000 GT.
It peaks at 205bhp, while the maximum torque figure of 221lb ft comes
at 3000rpm. The long-wheelbase five-door automatic will reach 60mph in
about 12.5 seconds. Test track maximum is around 112mph, and it has a
56mph fuel consumption figure of 25mp g compared with 16mpg around town.
Overdrive is standard.
Many 4x4 customers are looking for more on-road refinement than was
the case a few years ago. Shoguns built for 1995 have their suspension
modified, with a lower roll-centre and altered stabiliser bars to reduce
body lean in cornering. The old ''swings and roundabouts'' system
applies, however. Ride is harder than in some rival 4x4s. There are new
tyres too, and I was impressed by the test car's low levels of road
noise.
Mitsubishi has loaded the 3500 V6 with special equipment. It has air
conditioning and cruise control, anti-lock braking, selectable
four-wheel drive, lockable differentials, heated front seats, a CD
autochanger, a central instrument panel containing a compass display,
clinometer and even an altimeter.
Off-road, the Shogun is a match for just about anything in the class.
On steep muddy climbs it powers its way up, rather than slogging. One
stop-start test in these conditions showed how businesslike it is at
finding traction in difficult circumstances. For all the gizmos fitted
inside, it is a very effective off-roader as well as a school-run car.
The folding occasional seats are, incidentally, for children rather than
for adults.
Mitsubishi knows that it cannot let Shogun prices run riot. It has
recently introduced a less ambitious model.  The neat-looking Shogun GLX
range starts with a 2.5-litre three-door turbo diesel at #18,599. In
Japan, Mitsubishi has also begun to sell a scaled-down ''mini'' version
with an engine of only 660cc. That one, though, will not be coming to
the UK.  Apart from anything else, the Shogun's import quota here is
already bulging at the seams.

<RECORDNO>979730579</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BANK of England Governor Eddie George said last night that a decision
on a move towards monetary union in Europe could not be taken before
European Union members had resolved the problem of unemployment.
In a carefully balanced speech in Luxembourg, Mr George backed
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's line by stressing the dangers of rushing
headlong into monetary union without first making sure the economies of
member states were properly aligned.
But, like Mr Clarke's controversial single currency speech earlier
this month, he also did not shy away from highlighting the potential
economic benefits, which, he said, included oiling the wheels of the
single European market and increasing economic and monetary stability.
''It would be an enormous step,'' said Mr George, delivering the
Churchill Memorial Lecture. But he added that any decision to move to
monetary union must be taken dispassionately. ''It is not a decision
that can or should be taken now,'' he added.
The Governor has said in the past that it was very unlikely monetary
union could go ahead in 1997 -- the earliest possible start date under
the EU's Maastricht Treaty -- although he has also stressed that by then
Britain would meet the criteria.
Pointing at high structural unemployment in the Union, Mr George said
that this stood in the way of progress towards Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU). But he was not suggesting existing conditions for a closer
union should be changed.
''I am concerned with the substance rather than the form,'' he said.
''The important thing is convergence is real and that it is sustainable
before moving forward.''
Current economic convergence criteria, outlined in the Maastricht
Treaty, call for relative stability of inflation, exchange rates and
interest rates, while setting ceilings for governments' fiscal deficits
and public debt ratios.
Under the Treaty the conditions have to be met before EU countries can
join EMU and a single currency be launched.
The Governor warned there was a risk of political and economic
disharmony if the unemployment problem was not solved.
Two ways of adjusting the labour market imbalances -- migration from
high unemployment countries to areas of lower joblessness and
transferring money to high unemployment countries to simulate growth --
were not attractive, he said.
Low unemployment countries would have to open themselves up to other
nations' labour market surpluses or transfer their taxpayers' funds to
resolve a foreign nation's problems.
Instead, Mr George said, the wide differences in structural
unemployment levels could require adjustments in wages or exchange rates
to ensure sustained convergence.
Singling out the unemployment problem as a key risk to EMU, he said
that rewards could take the form of lower costs of transactions between
areas, certainty for companies about stable exchange rates and reduced
risks for long-term investment. -- Reuter.

UNILEVER'S annual results bear the scars of the soap wars sparked off
by the Persil Power surveillance detergent debacle, which cost the group
a #57m write-off. This is a fleabite for a company of Unilever's size
and 1994 profits were still 24% ahead at #2383m for the year, before
restructuring costs.
Dividends are raised by 7% to 26.8p after a final of 20.3p.
Power was the result of research to discover a more powerful
stain-removing detergent and used what is called a manganese
accelerator. Unfortunately it reacted with certain dyes to damage
clothes, a fact which was jumped on by Unilever's arch-rival Procter &amp;
Gamble.
The competitive pressures in detergents are intense and the temptation
to steal a march on competitors was evidently too great. But how the
product could have been marketed with such a fault still beggars belief
and it inevitably raises doubts over the quality of management.
But Unilever is trying to put the episode behind it. Chairman Sir
Michael Perry said yesterday that lessons had been learned and internal
processes reviewed. He added that it was the biggest marketing setback
they had suffered in his time with the group.
The event did not apparently affect other detergent brands apart from
Persil, which is a strong brand in the UK. But Unilever is confident it
will recover from the setback. Unilever's share of the UK market has
slipped from 32.6% to 31%, while Procter's Ariel and other brands have
climbed from 50.6% to 52.8%, according to market researcher Neilsen.
Once market share has been lost it takes a lot of money to regain it.
Reformulated Power will still be sold if there is a demand for it but
the name will no longer be promoted. It originally had some #200m thrown
at it, which sounds a lot but was only 6% of total group marketing
spend.
The setback was reflected in a small decline in European operating
profits to #1324m though the state of the economy was just as important.
The group did see an upturn in the final quarter, which is encouraging
for 1995.
The detergent contribution overall was still ahead at #501m as a
result of a stronger performance outside Europe and North America, with
new markets in the Asia Pacific region, including China, now coming more
into the equation. The American business was restructured to help fend
off competition and as a result margins were maintained. Sir Michael
said the US detergent business was in a healthier state than for some
years.
North America was generally a good area for Unilever, which sees the
US economy continuing to grow strongly. Profits were 20% ahead on sound
volume gains. Ice-cream was to the fore helped by a 1993 purchase.
Market leadership was obtained and rationalisation gave margins a boost.
The tea business T J Lipton recovered ground lost earlier and is market
leader in that peculiar American product, canned and bottled tea.
New products were introduced in personal products, such as Calvin
Klein's CK-One fragrance and new versions of Mentadent toothpaste and
these enabled the division to report a better performance.
Unilever is turning increasingly to markets outside the mature areas
of North America and Europe for growth and sales in these areas rose by
an underlying 17%. They now account for 29% of profits.
The biggest developing country market for the group is Brazil and this
was actually one of the poorer performers as result of the economic
changes in the country. But volumes rose well and the year finished on a
positive note. Elsewhere in Latin America the group traded strongly. The
problems in Mexico came after the year-end.
Detergents and personal products are the powerhouses in these markets,
though ice-cream is growing strongly.
The Far East is the other fast-growing area and Unilever is moving
into China in a big way. Sales there and in Hong Kong trebled to #130m.
A second ice-cream factory is being built in Shanghai to meet virtually
insatiable demand. Sir Michael said China would absorb funds for some
time, though costs were being strictly controlled.
Developing regions in general will attract a higher proportion of
Unilever's investment in coming years and it will be concentrated in the
products the group understands well, such as detergents, ice-cream and
shampoo. As Mexico has shown there are risks in putting money into these
areas. But, as Sir Michael pointed out, there is greater risk in being
left behind through not investing in current growth markets.
This is undoubtedly true and the risks are manageable so long as there
is no overdue concentration in one country. With its core portfolio of
basic products the group is well placed to benefit from these countries'
development.
Unilever shares initially dipped 18[1/2]p but later recovered to
unchanged at 1173p and are rated quite modestly at 14 times earnings,
though the yield is on the low side at 2.9%.

JOB losses are on the way at insurance group Guardian Royal Exchange
(GRE), which yesterday reported a jump in profits from #183m to #298m
before taking account of investment losses and gains.
The group is aiming to improve efficiency further with more
computerisation and 500 jobs will be lost across the UK general
insurance operations and in the head office over the next two or three
years, though it has not yet been decided where the cuts will fall.
But some are likely to be in Scotland where the group employs 500,
though this includes those on the life and pensions side which is not
affected by the cuts. Some #28m has been set aside to cover
restructuring costs this year. Included in this sum is rationalisation
in Germany and the US as well as the UK.
GRE said the aim of the reorganisation is to improve customer focus
and capitalise on existing strengths. More responsibility has been
delegated to operating subsidiaries enabling central functions to be
reduced.
The UK continued to do well in 1994, with trading profits more than
doubling to #160m as an underwriting surplus was achieved. Claims
frequency in motor and household declined, though theft claims remain
significant. Motor claims are down from a peak of 30 per 100 cars
covered to 24.
The new Guardian Direct operation has picked up 31,000 policies, which
was short of expectations. This market is becoming increasingly
competitive as more companies follow Direct Line's example. GRE is now
starting a direct life operation.
European operations moved from losses of #15m to profits of #10m, with
the key German business benefiting from premium rises in motor.
With competition generally hotting up, rates are bound to come
gradually under greater pressure but GRE says it is determined to retain
a tough underwriting stance even if it means surrendering market share.
More accurate rating is made easier by the better management information
Investment losses of #373m have reduced net asset value from 193p to
171p per share and solvency ratio at the end of 1994 was 53%. GRE shares
edged up 4p to 177p, where they are supported by a 5.8% yield on
dividends 9% higher at 8.25p after a final of 5.4p.

THE UK gilts market is in line for a major shake-up with the
introduction of a Repo (repurchase) market.
It basically means that gilts will be able to be borrowed and sold by
anyone and brings the market in Government debt into line with
international practice.
At present only the Gilt edged market-makers (Gemms) are permitted to
do this and then only since 1986. Repos allow investors to lend stock to
each other freely. The lenders make a small profit while borrowers can
use the facility to take short or leveraged positions.

<HEADLINE>Dutch group achieves tenth successive year of growth. PolyGram on song. Film side gets boost from Four Weddings</HEADLINE>

THE worldwide success of the film Four Weddings and a Funeral,
nominated for two Oscars for best provided a welcome boost to the
fortunes of PolyGram's fledgling film division. The $5m film has grossed
$250m with further revenues to come from television and video rights.
The surprise hit of Shallow Grave in the UK, the black comedy by
Scottish director Danny Boyle which recently opened in the US and the
release of films such as French Kiss, a romantic comedy starring Meg
Ryan and Kevin Kline from the producers of Four Weddings, and Loch Ness
starring Ted Danson and Joely Richardson, augurs well for 1995.
However, it is expected to be several years before the division makes
a profit despite the fact that PolyGram -- 75% owned by
Netherlands-based Philips Electronics -- reduces its exposure to any one
film through selling distribution rights in particular markets.
It estimates that its profits from Four Weddings would have been 50%
higher if it had handled all the distribution. Last year PolyGram Filmed
Entertainment (PFE) recorded a loss of $24m, equivalent to 4% of sales.
PolyGram, one of the world's leading music and entertainment
companies, is keen to diversify its activities in order to maximise
earnings growth potential in the future. The company may take a minority
stake in the MGM cinema chain currently up for sale.
Alain Levy, president and chief executive of PolyGram, said there were
synergies between film and the music business, where the company makes
close to 90% of its income.
Overall last year PolyGram achieved its tenth successive year of
growth with sales up 16% and net income 20% higher. It benefited from a
strong recovery in its music markets in the US and UK, particularly in
the second half of the year.
The performance was mixed on the Continent and sales in the Far East
were adversely affected by a flood of cheap Chinese pirate copies and
the lack of material from local artists in Japan. Mr Levy said that as a
European company he wished the European Commission would adopt as robust
an attitude to Chinese piracy as the US authorities had done.
A total of 29 PolyGram albums sold over one million units in 1994,
including Bon Jovi's greatest hits compilation Cross Road, Sting's
Fields of Gold and Bryan Adams' 1993 release So Far So Good.
PolyGram's three classical labels maintained their leading market
position in 1994 and increased their sales by 3%. Best-selling classical
titles included Decca/London's Three Tenors which sold a further one
million copies in 1994, taking its total to over 11 million audio and
video units.
During the year, Luciano Pavarotti extended his contract with Decca
into the next century. On Deutsche Grammophon, Adagio Karajan sold
500,000 units and is topping pop charts in Europe.
Despite this strong performance, overall music margins at 12.4%,
compared with 12.6% last year, still have some way to go before they
reach the company's targets of 15%. In the UK, PolyGram and Thorn EMI
are now almost neck and neck in terms of market share. PolyGram has
24.7% of the UK market while Sony trails the pair with 10%.
The company is optimistic about its success in the music business
given its acquisition of record labels specialising in niche artists and
overseas markets.

THERE is unlikely to be vinegar on the tables or fish 'n' chips on the
menu when the Prime Minister rises to address the Tory-funded gentry in
Glasgow on Friday.
There might, however, be a touch of acid in his speech. One of the
recurrent problems with the Tory attitude towards Scotland is a
prevailing sense that they are irritated with our ingratitude.
It was a British Ambassador in Dublin who once noted about Ireland
that ''phrases make history here''. The Prime Minister could benefit
from some instruction on the use of language in Scottish politics.
To be fair, Mr Major has never managed to reach the same falsetto
pitch about the Scots as did his predecessor. However, in turn she never
displayed his degree of petulance. And she had infinitely more in the
way of style.
Only one of us (to coin a phrase) up here can lay a legitimate claim
to have got the better of the great dame down there -- that Scot being
the former Moderator of the General Assembly, Duncan Shaw.
In the, perhaps apocryphal, account Prime Minister Thatcher, impatient
of the then Moderator's earnest pleas about poverty and injustice,
breached protocol by rising to leave an audience after 15 minutes.
The point being that at the General Assembly she was having the
audience with the Moderator, not the other way round, and it was
therefore for him, not her, to bring it to a close.
Totally unfazed, Duncan rose and intoned ''Let us pray, Prime
Minister'' and proceeded to keep her there, head bowed, for the rest of
the full allotted span of the interview.
Scotland is unlikely to be handbagged by John Major on Friday. He may
even be relieved to escape from the recurrent political crisis south of
the Border to a land where the Tories have little left to lose.
Ireland and Scotland have for many English politicians been issues to
avoid. Irish politics was the ultimate bog while the Scots had too many
grouses off their moors.
For Mr Major, however, the Celtic fringe offers some respite from the
Tory's English civil war even if his statesmanship on Ireland contrasts
rather badly with his partisanship on Scotland.
For what has he offered Scotland since the 1992 campaign when he
himself declared that the Union was the issue which ''transcended the
election''?
The ''taking stock'' exercise has been exposed as no more than
procedural tinkering with the Westminster rule book -- a few more
Scottish Questions is hardly a serious answer to the democratic deficit
in the nation of Scotland.
Admittedly in strict constitutional terms the Prime Minister is now
pursuing a logical argument. He has accepted (albeit after a great deal
of pressing from yours truly) that if Scots opt for independence then
the game's up with Westminster ''and no English politician or party
would stand in their way''.
Until such time as that happens then in constitutional terms Scots are
indeed at the mercy of a parliamentary majority the bulk of whom have
little knowledge of, and even less time for, their northern neighbour.
And that applies regardless of how many times Scots MPs are allowed to
bump their gums in a toothless Grand Committee.
But just because something is constitutionally correct doesn't make it
right, proper, just, or popular. And the Tory tendency to daur meddle
with Scotland has sown the seeds of their own destruction. In this
respect the Major language of ''teenage madness'' is hardly helpful to
their cause.
A few years ago the then Secretary of State, Malcolm Rifkind, bridled
when the Scottish Field reported him comparing the powers of his office
to those of a colonial governor.
Perhaps it was a remark taken out of context, although the Scottish
Field hardly has a reputation for inventing quotes to create stories.
What it betrayed in terms of attitude, however, was uncomfortably close
to the truth.
Under Mrs Thatcher the governance of Scotland approached the
pro-consular. With Mr Major the tone has changed but the substance is
unaltered. Instead of nanny knows best it is now the adult talking
severely to the unruly teenager.
It isn't the correct way to speak to a nation whether as Prime
Minister or as a visitor and it is one reason why, whatever money he
raises on Friday, the Prime Minister can expect only political crumbs
from the Scottish table. It is just possible that we are approaching the
stage where we believe that we are grown up enough to wish to make our
own way in the world.

Rosalind McInnes looks at the crime of breach of the peace, which
seems to cover everything from eating ice cream in a lewd and libidinous
manner to football hooliganism
HOW rude can you be before it becomes a matter for the law? According
to recent cases the answer is: Not very. A Dumfries man was found guilty
of breach of the peace by eating an ice cream in a lewd and libidinous
manner. Over protests of innocence -- ''I only know one way to eat an
ice cream and that's to lick it'' -- he was fined #250 for this and
other breaches of the peace, viz, staring, and opening the top buttons
of his shirt.
This verdict came four months after an unemployed knitwear worker from
Berwickshire was found guilty of causing distress under the Public Order
Act 1986. He had said: ''You've got an ugly bairn'' to a passer-by. He
was sentenced to 180 hours of community service -- and made to pay #30
in compensation.
The criminal offence of breach of the peace originates, seemingly, in
the notion of ''the king's peace''. Nowhere in the vicinity of the
mobile medieval monarch was there to be ignoble skirmishing.
This has blossomed in the twentieth century into a ''breach of the
peace'' that passeth understanding. The peace can be breached in a huge
variety of ways.
A fairly small number of the reported cases deal with threatening
people, throwing objects, provocation, breaking things, vandalism,
tribal or racial abuse, loud and obnoxious inebriation. For convenience,
let us term this the Glasgow Bar Association breach.
A second category covers what may loosely be termed an excess of high
spirits. Examples include late-night partying, playing of loud music,
break dancing, and playing ball games in the street: The Queen Margaret
Union breach.
The third group embraces, so to speak, minor indecencies such as foul
language, intrusive questioning, exhibitionism, and enticement: The
Lower Aisle breach.
The fourth type is reminiscent of the days of ''the king's peace''. It
seeks to preserve ''order'' in the sense of ''authority''. Nowadays this
unofficial category -- the Masonic breach -- extends specifically to the
police. Those who saw The Trial on TV will have noted the vehemence with
which the police witness denied having arrested the accused ''for cheek;
and insolence''. A nerve had clearly been struck.
Some breaches are clear-cut examples of one category or another, but
often, of course, these categories overlap.
All of these fall within the umbrella of prohibiting anti-social
behaviour. However, there are further breaches which are really
intrusions on private rights rather than public. Trespassing, voyeurism,
and nuisance telephone calls have all been held to be breaches of the
peace. One conviction resulted from asking inappropriate personal
questions during a job interview, even although two of the three women
interviewed did not say that they had been caused distress. The test is
whether the conduct was likely to cause alarm or apprehension, not
whether it has done so.
A number of breach cases centre around that last bastion of privacy,
the lavatory cubicle. In a 1989 case it was held that injecting oneself
in a cubicle in a restaurant could amount to breach of the peace. In a
March 1992 case the accused was a peeping tom discovered looking through
a hole in a locked lavatory cubicle into a solarium.
The Public Order Act 1986 bars still fewer holds. It was designed to
deal with problems as diverse as mobbing and rioting, race relations,
trade union activities, football hooliganism, and, according to Hansard,
the banging of dustbin lids. The Berwickshire baby-critic comes under
Section 5 of this Act which states:
''A person is guilty of an offence if he (a) uses threatening, abusive
or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or (b)
displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is
threatening, abusive, or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a
person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby . . .
except that no offence is committed where the words or behaviour are
used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation is displayed,
by a person inside a dwelling (ie, domestic) and the other person is
also inside that or another dwelling.''
Thus it preserves the sanctity of the family in its most basic form,
ie, the right to insult one's own relatives. (Also, by the miracles of
modern technology, to insult someone by private phone or fax.) Other
than that, an insult which is likely to cause distress is criminal. The
only defence is that your conduct was ''reasonable''. There is no clue
in the statute as to what ''reasonable'' might mean.
Section 5 was originally drafted to require ''substantial alarm,
harassment or distress'', but the word substantial was removed. The
result is a charter for eggshell personalities.
The commentary in the statute book notes: ''Of all the criteria,
distress is the most subjective and might include varying degrees of
affront, upset or anger, and incidents as diverse as swearing, silly
walking . . . or carrying a controversial banner.''
Gerald Gordon, author of the Modern Standard Text Book on Criminal
Law, says of one breach of the peace case: ''It is difficult to resist
the conclusion that 'breach of the peace' was used to penalise the
accused for behaving immorally''. The usual consensus is that the law
exists to enforce mores rather than morals. Both the Berwick and
Dumfries cases seem to flout that consensus. These stigmatised as
criminal behaviour which could not reasonably be predicted to be such.
The Dumfries case also raises a more serious question. It seems that
at least one citizen was genuinely unnerved by the man's behaviour. This
case, like the hypodermic incident, hints at a third category of breach
-- when the police suspect that a serious crime has taken or may take
place but cannot prove it.
THIS is understandable, but not, perhaps, productive. A breach of the
peace conviction, while damaging, is unlikely to take a dangerous
criminal off the streets. I, too, have a dream of a world in which every
infant, no matter how ill-favoured, can perambulate the streets without
cruel cat calls. But do we want the line-drawing involved to be in the
hands of the courts?
There may be an argument for criminalising some specific kinds of
merely obnoxious behaviour. For example, the Civic Government (Scotland)
Act 1982 prohibits levels and types of noise which possibly would not
amount to civil nuisance. Perhaps a law should be passed against
gratuitous public comments about personal appearance, or staring at
strangers. But shouldn't such criminalisation, if reckoned to be
necessary, be specific in its terms and provide for as objective a
determination as possible? And should it be hidden behind such
misleading blanket phrases as ''breach of the peace'' and ''public
order''? There is absolutely no evidence that the Dumfriesshire Haagen
Dazs has been stormed by lieges bearing flaming torches.
''Manners are more important than laws,'' said Edmund Burke. True, but
one doesn't have to be over-sophisticated to want to preserve the
distinction. At present, it is unsafe to rely on that. So keep a civil
tongue in your cornet -- and if you can't say anything nice, don't say
anything at all.

Robert Dickson recalls two cases where the evidence of forensic
experts brought about doubtful verdicts
JURIES are said to like evidence which is either black or white. Clear
emphatic statements, the truthfulness and accuracy about which they can
make their own assessments, are easier to deal with than the views of an
expert who shifts his ground. The world-famous Home Office pathologist,
Sir Bernard Spilsbury, was a past master at reaching an opinion from
which nobody could budge him. Once he had considered all the facts and
reached a decision as to the cause of death then he would never waver.
Such an approach is of course very dangerous, and while Sir Bernard
was almost invariably correct, there were cases when his assessment flew
in the face of the combined views of numerous equally qualified
professional colleagues. Never was this more so than when Norman Thorne
was convicted of murdering his girlfriend, Elsie Cameron. Called in to
conduct a postmortem on the decomposed body, found where Thorne had
buried it under his hen hutch, the Crown pathologist stated that a
bruise on the throat proved the victim had been strangled.
Six experts, including Professor Robert Bronte from Dublin, gave
evidence for the defence that they could find no evidence of bruising
and that Thorne's defence that Miss Cameron had committed suicide by
hanging herself was probably true. Panicking because he believed that he
would be blamed for her death, Thorne explained to the jury that he had
hidden her body, hoping it would never be found.
Despite the immense numerical advantage in favour of the defence, the
jury, possibly swayed by the eminence of the Crown witness, convicted
the young man and after his appeal had failed he was executed.
Two years later another young man stood trial in Edinburgh. He was
accused of murdering his mother, but a complete change of opinion by a
professor of forensic medicine weakened the case against John Donald
Merrett. If subsequent reflection continues to cast doubt on whether
Norman Thorne should have been hanged, then a similar review of Donald
Merrett's career leaves no doubt that in 1927 he escaped his just
deserts.
Mrs Bertha Merrett had moved to Scotland in 1926 to allow her only son
to attend Edinburgh University. If Donald ever heard Professor Harvey
Littlejohn lecturing it must have been one of the few classes he
attended as he preferred to drive a fast motor bike, to go dancing, and
indulge in rabbit shooting with a pistol he had acquired.
To finance his hobbies he drained his mother's bank account using a
series of forged cheques. Ultimately, as he must have foreseen, his
mother realised that her funds were depleted and that instead of a
healthy balance in two accounts she had an overdraft.
Her bank manager wrote to her pointing out that her overdraft was
increasing, and as she sat at her desk considering the letter she was
heard to tell her son to stop bothering her. This was followed by the
sound of a loud bang as Mrs Merrett sustained a head wound from a shot
fired from the pistol which Donald used to kill rabbits. The gun was
kept in the top drawer of the bureau.
For reasons which have never been entirely clear, the authorities
treated the incident as an attempted suicide. Although she repeatedly
told hospital nurses and other relatives that she did not know what had
happened, nobody tried to take a statement from Mrs Merrett and a
fortnight later she died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
When he carried out the subsequent postmortem, Professor Littlejohn,
instead of challenging the theory of suicide, supported it. ''The wound
is consistent with suicide,'' he stated in his report dated April 5,
1926. Meanwhile Donald Merrett continued to squander money using more
forgeries and it was only when questions were asked about some of the
cheques that the police realised that they had been deceived.
TOO late, Professor Littlejohn changed his view; evidence which he
considered had pointed to suicide, he now felt showed definitely that
this was a case of murder. At the end of a second report, dated January
13, 1927, he concluded: ''I am of the opinion that suicide was in the
highest degree improbable.''
In the witness box he was shown his first report and despite his
dignified admission that his initial conclusion had been based on a lack
of information he could not convince the High Court jury that second
thoughts were best. The defence had been assisted further by securing
the services of Sir Bernard who, with his customary clarity, stated that
the professor's original version was the correct one. The murder charge
was found not proven, although the swindling son did serve 12 months on
the cheques charge.
The fallacy of the verdict is best illustrated by turning on the clock
27 years. A police hunt for a Ronald Chesney ended when he killed
himself in a German wood, after he had bungled his attempt to cover up
the murder of his wife and mother-in-law. By 1954, Donald Merrett had
changed his name to Chesney; his criminal tendency towards fraud and
murder had persisted.

STRONG growth in the retail insurance market last year helped
Sedgwick, Britain's biggest insurance broker, to lift pre-tax profits by
34% to #94.4m.
The European and north American retail businesses were notably strong
and enabled Sedgwick to become the world's second largest insurance
broker in terms of revenues, behind Marsh &amp; McLennan. Total brokerage
and fees advanced by 17% to #888.7m.
Earnings per share increased by 22% to 11.0p. A final dividend of 3.5p
is proposed making a total shareholders' payment of 6.5p for the year. A
scrip dividend continues to be available.
In its traditional broking business, Sedgwick is working closely with
its clients to minimise the effects of falling premium rates in many of
the world's markets. A charge of #13.5m has been made in the UK
insurance broking business primarily to cover provisions against assets
and premises-related costs.
In recognition of the changing nature of insurance markets worldwide,
Sedgwick is keen to build its business both organically and via
acquisition. In addition it intends to venture into new and
complementary markets said chief executive Sax Riley. It intends to
develop the fee income side of its business to account for 50% of total
revenue and reduce its dependence on cyclical commission-related
operations. Last year, the fee element grew to 35% from 26% in 1993.
However, the brokers plans to grow its Sedgwick Noble Lowndes employee
benefits consultancy were hampered in the UK by problems facing the life
insurance and pensions industry. In addition profits at Sedgwick Payne,
its specialist insurance operation, were lower as a result of
difficulties in the London insurance market and changes in the buying
patterns of clients.
The group's results were ahead of City expectations and so Sedgwick
shares gained 2p to 162p.

SHIRES High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust is confident its
portfolio will benefit from a continued UK economic recovery this year,
in spite of a slight setback in 1994.
The investment trust, known as Shirescot, recorded a negative total
return of 2.7% in the year to end-December. However, it outperformed the
FTSE All-Share and Hoare Govett Smaller Companies indices, which
suffered respective negative overall returns of 5.8% and 3.0%.
Fully-diluted net asset value fell 6.2% to 137.3p, compared with a
capital decline of 9.6% in the All-Share index.
Shirescot will pay a final dividend of 1.8p, increasing the total
dividend by 6.9% to 5.4p.
The #28m trust, run by Glasgow Investment Managers, believes the UK
economy will continue to be quite strong. Smaller companies, less
diversified internationally than blue chips, are more dependent on the
UK economy.
Glasgow Investment Managers therefore believes shareholders are
well-positioned to take advantage of what it predicts will be a
sustained domestic recovery.
Although recent economic data have fuelled fears of a slowdown in the
UK economy, David Williams, managing director of Glasgow Investment
Managers, said: ''We think it is more of a short-term hiccup than a
major change in trend.''
Shirescot, which raised #10.4m through a conversion share issue in
June, intends to pay a total dividend of at least 5.7p for 1995. This is
more than covered by fully-diluted earnings per share of 6.3p last year.
The trust's dividend forecast is on the conservative side because it
is keen in the long term to switch some of its convertible securities
holdings, which accounted for 15% of the fund at the year-end, into
equities.
This would reduce the yield of the portfolio and Glasgow Investment
Managers want to ensure such a switch would have no impact on the
dividend payout.
On the Ordinary shares side, the portfolio is overweighted in general
manufacturing and financial stocks, and light on consumer goods.
Chairman Michael Hardie will step down after the trust's annual
general meeting in March. He will be succeeded by John Stubbs.

ASIDE from any fuss being generated over a #100,000 bonus National
Westminster Bank's chairman Lord Alexander is expected to receive at a
time of redundancies and a freeze in certain staff pay, the market chose
to concentrate yesterday on the more negative aspect of the bank's
annual results.
Pre-tax profits for 1994 have in fact emerged within analysts'
projections at #1592m, up from #989m in the preceding year when there
was a #159m provision for withdrawal from certain foreign operations.
There is also a useful increase of 17% in the dividend total to 21.6p
covered by earnings per share up 80% at 63p. None of which prevented the
shares slipping 7p to 486p.
What seems to have upset the market, if only mildly, is the bank's
cost base which has grown by 5% over the year to 69.2% as it strove to
make itself less dependent on an increasingly competitive domestic
banking scene.
However, NatWest expects to see a reduction in costs by the end of the
current year as benefits of the investment programme become apparent.
For the moment, though, at the pre-tax level the bank has benefited
from a decline in bad-debt provisions rather than an increase in loan
demand which, if anything, remained flat although it is starting to
improve. UK banking profits before exceptionals and bad-debt provisions
actually fell from around #1000m to #928m.
While NatWest UK (the former UK branch business), which contributed
slightly over a third of profits at the pre-tax level at #591m, remains
''a continuing source of strength'' the bank is reducing its dependence
on the UK economy by continuing to build its income overseas. It is
undertaking this through developing corporate and investment banking and
international private banking on a global basis.
Lord Alexander stresses that the business is cyclical and has
benefited from improving economic conditions. But equally important is
the company's increased focus on risk management and the greater
diversity of its portfolio. ''This is leading to better asset quality
and will help us to sustain our profitability across an economic
cycle,'' said the chairman.
Clearly NatWest's strategy is aimed at avoiding another pounding in
the event of a UK recession or downturn.
Meantime, full benefits take time to accrue. A breakdown of pre-tax
profits shows that US retail operations improved from #184m to #239m,
the international business turned in #403,000 against #172m last time
following a #159m provision, while NatWest Markets fell from #453m to
#359m.
NatWest Markets, which is establishing new ventures in Hong Kong and
India, expects to see a recovery in dealing profits on the back of a
growing client base after their decline in 1994. Client volumes remained
high in difficult market conditions and are now growing, said NatWest
Markets' chief executive Martin Owen. There is no breakdown of divisions
within NatWest Markets but the foreign exchange contribution to its
profits was down about #30m in 1994.
During the year, the bank, Britain's second biggest, strengthened many
of its retail businesses, including NatWest Home Loans, Lombard, Ulster
and NatWest Bancorp. At the same time it is exiting those businesses
which it considers lack a strategic fit. This included the disposal of F
van Lanschot and the registrars' business.
Looking ahead, the company forecasts modest lending growth in the UK,
coupled with intensifying competition in all its markets. ''This
environment demands ever enhanced cost vigilance and a continued drive
for new sources of income,'' said Lord Alexander.
The shares are currently selling at around eight times historic
earnings and yield 5.9%.

PANIC in emerging markets everywhere in the wake of the Mexican
financial crisis further battered the net asset value of Pacific Assets
Trust, which plunged 29% in the year to January 31.
Diluted NAV fell to 426.0p and Pacific Assets will pay a dividend of
1.3p, up 8%. Earnings per share were down 15% at 1.98p.
The dramatic decline in the portfolio came against the backdrop of a
40% crash in sterling terms in the dominant Hong Kong stock market,
where 25% of the #128m fund is invested.
Indonesia, with a 6% portfolio share, lost 37%. The semi-closed
markets of Korea and Taiwan, which account for 5% and 7% of the fund,
lost only 5.8% and 2.2%.
However, the remainder of the Asian Pacific markets in which the trust
is invested, namely Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines,
lost between 10% and 22%.
The heavy use of borrowings to boost the fund, which is managed by
Ivory &amp; Sime, exacerbated the plunge in NAV, which came after a 91%
advance the previous year. Gearing amounted to #32m at the year-end.
Pacific Assets' January year-end means that, unlike some other
investment trusts, the full extent of the damage is reflected in its
final results. During last month, virtually all of the markets in Asia
came off 9% or 10%.
Commenting on the fall-out from the Mexican crisis, James Anderson,
investment director of Hong Kong-based Ivory &amp; Sime Asia, said:
''January was a traumatic time for Asian stock markets. People who don't
understand the make-up of the Asian economies probably took their money
out and returned it to their home base, whether that was America or
Japan.''
While acknowledging that the last year had been horrific, Mr Anderson
took comfort from the rarity of two bad years back-to-back in Asia.
He said: ''The economies in Asia are extremely strong and earnings
continue to come through strongly. With our total belief in Asia and a
geared investment trust, we think Pacific Assets is well positioned for
the future.''
The trust's objective is long-term capital growth and, in spite of the
plunge in NAV over the past 12 months, an investment of #10,000 when
Pacific Assets was launched in 1985 would now be worth #45,000.

SCOTTISHPOWER subsidiary CaledonianGas has made major inroads into the
commercial market south of the Border, where it is now attracting
#500,000 worth of new business every month.
Link-ups with companies throughout England with strong track records
have paid dividends for CaledonianGas, whose 5000 business customers
outside its home patch include York Minster and Liverpool Football Club.
Since the Government deregulated the business sector more than two
years ago, the company has built up a market share of about 20% in
Scotland. However, half of its sales are in England and Wales.
Martin Fleming, managing director of CaledonianGas, emphasised the
importance of setting out the company's stall in what is a
highly-competitive marketplace.
CaledonianGas puts its success in England and Wales down to cost
savings for customers, service standards and continuity and security of
supply.

THOSE who voted against the siting of the Greenan sewage treatment
works did so for three main reasons.
First, because Strathclyde Regional Council failed to present a
convincing case for the siting; secondly, it refused to explain its
decision to ignore its own engineer's report; and lastly, those who
voted against it felt they had to represent the views of their electors.
Everyone in Ayr wants a treatment works but it would be madness to
spend #40m and put it in the wrong place.

I AM very depressed on reading Tom Shields's item on Pollok Park

I too remember the area from years ago and the pleasure it gave, and
also the relief when it was realised that here, after much searching,
was an area that satisfied the stringent environmental requirements for
the priceless artefacts left by Sir William Burrell to enable an

One shudders to think of the effect years of heavy traffic and
consequent exhaust emissions will have on these treasures.

THE diary has heard of papal infallibility, but extending it to the
judiciary, even when it includes the Lord President, seems to be taking
things a bit far. The Dean of the Faculty, Mr Andrew Hardie QC, was
addressing the appeal court and opened his address to the Bench with the
words: ''I don't know if your lordships have ever made a mistake . . .''
Hot on the trail
AN ominously warm welcome greets visitors to the Lothian and Borders
Police forensic science laboratories for a couple of days during the
Edinburgh International Science Festival: suggested car parking is at
the nearby Mortonhall Crematorium.
Judge bites Minister
LORD McCLUSKEY wrote to the Scotsman following that newspaper's
interview with Scottish Office Minister and former Lord Advocate, Lord
Fraser of Carmyllie. Lord Fraser had told the interviewer that he was
unimpressed with the quality of criticisms of Government law and order
proposals. He described the criticism as synthetic.
Lord McCluskey expressed surprise at this since the disapproval had
been voiced by such imposing bodies as the Law Society of Scotland and
the Faculty of Advocates.
''If he feels able to dismiss so lightly the criticisms from such
distinguished critics he must obviously possess even more wisdom and
greater experience in the law than the rest of us have hitherto
realised,'' added Lord McCluskey. Ouch!
Bastions of the law, no 71
LITERARY allusions to man's best friend are common enough, although
after the Lansdowne Road riot, it does seem deeply insulting to mad dogs
to have been classed by Noel Coward alongside Englishmen.
It is all too easy for the law to give a dog a bad name, as Slitz, the
alleged pit bull terrier who turned out to be a Staffordshire cross can
testify.
Or at least she could have, had she been brought to the courthouse in
Peebles for her case. As the urbane Sheriff Nigel Thomson, citing the
Warwickshire Bard, observed: ''It is difficult to have Hamlet without
the Prince of Denmark and to appreciate what experts are talking about
when the subject is not before the court.''
Slitz may have got a bit of a raw deal from the start. Bought in a pub
in exchange for a piece of frozen salmon (unlikely, by the way, to have
come from Sainsbury's shelves) she even acquired her name as a result of
mis-spelling an American beer, although it could have been worse if the
''h'' had been retained instead of the ''l''.
Humans would take a dim view if, hauled up on a breach of the peace
charge, they then had to prove they were not guilty and face a firing
squad if they failed. It might suit the politics of a taxi driver in
Barking, but he's probably most likely to have a real pit bull as his
best pal, especially if he goes to football matches in Dublin.
However, as Sheriff Thomson remarked, under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs
Act, law-abiding mutts cannot rely on the basic presumptions of
innocence and preservation of life.
Slitz also had the indignity of three veterinary examinations poking
around at her teeth, bones, tail, gait, and even measuring her
skinfolds. Those were by people who were probably rude enough to call
her a bitch.
But every dog has his or her day in court. Slitz, you will be glad to
hear, was spared a fast exit stage left to the Big Kennel in the Sky.
Sheriff Thomson was able to consider good behaviour: in four years she
hadn't as much as growled boo to a goose. As her jubilant owner, a
Borders bricklayer, later remarked: ''Slitz doesn't even chase cats.''
Rough justice, who needs it? Answers to the Canine Defence League.
Frontiersman
AS regular Devil's Advocate readers will recall, the legal profession
includes a number of Captain Kirk devotees in its ranks, who will no
doubt already have beamed themselves down to the excellent Star Trek
Exhibition, just a phaser-blast away from the Court of Session.
According to one member of the bar, however, their journey was not
really necessary. Asked if he intended to go to the exhibition, he
replied: ''No. I see enough aliens and bizarre life forms at Parliament
House already.''
The bottom line
WITH apologies to our more delicate readers, but purely in the
interests of truth and justice, we feel obliged to relate two stories
which reflect the sometimes anatomical nature of events which unfold in
our courts.
The first concerns the always-intriguing question of when does robust
criticism cross the legal divide and become actionable?
In the past the courts have decided it is defamatory to refer to
someone as debauched, corrupt, two-faced, a low dirty scum, a
blackguard, a calumniator, a disgusting brute, an infidel, a mansworn
rogue, a glutton, and a plagiarist.
Now, in deepest Angus, a learned legal debate has arisen as to whether
is is defamatory to refer to someone as an ''a***hole''. No doubt much
of the argument will centre round the defence of veritas.
Tailpiece
THERE is a Latin maxim to the effect that the law does not concern
itself with trifles. That will presumably have to be changed now that
that master of trivia, Noel Edmonds, has been granted a High Court order
in England to protect the name Crinkley Bottom.
The court order restains Crinkley Bottom Ltd of Gosforth, Newcastle,
and three food and drink firms from using the name pending a possible
trial over alleged breaches of copyright.

PENNY LEWIS voices concern that people demonstrating against exporting
calves to veal crates are expressing their ''disillusionment with
humanity'' (February 16). She is right.
People are disillusioned and disgusted by the misplaced human
ingenuity which condemns animals to factory farming systems designed to
deny them any expression of their natural instincts and behaviour
patterns.
I cannot agree that it is anthropomorphic to describe animals as being
rapes, murdered, or imprisoned.
Animal rights is not about projecting our values upon other creatures.
It is about recognising the behavoural needs of the animal and catering
for those needs instead of devaluing them to suit our commercial aims.
Penny Lewis would like to see animal rights supporters direct their
energy against redundancies, racism, and poverty. If she had attended
the pit closure pickets or anti-Nazi rallies she would have seen many
animal rights badges and sweat shirts among the demonstrators.
One of the many arguments against modern meat production is that it
causes famine in the Third World by encouraging the export of grain
which could feed local populations instead of being turned into
expensive beef for consumption in the West.

MOTOR taxation in 1992 was #19.4bn and total expenditure on roads was
#5813m, being 2.1% of all public expenditure.
In this year (1994-5) the tax revenue raised from road use will be
about #24bn, exceeding the expenditure on improving, maintaining, and
administering roads by more than four times.
The increases in excise duties and planned reductions in road
expenditure for 1995-6 will probably increase the ratio of taxes to
''track'' costs nearer to five to one from next year.
George Davidson tries to maintain that roads are built from ''general
taxation'' (just like rail) and that road users pay nothing for the use
of the track (February 7).
The truth is that roads have always been built and maintained from
current road taxation and there is no need to borrow capital.
On specific vehicle taxation, cars pay annually #135, taxis and buses
up to #450 depending on seating, and lorries up to #4000 each depending
on number of axles and weight. Duty and VAT is 71% of fuel pump prices
for all vehicles. Buses get a rebate on fuel but I believe that rail
pays no tax.
It is simply not true that road users are subsidised in any way. They
not only pay for all road costs but they are a major contributor to
national taxation, being third highest in total after income tax and
VAT. Many users consider road taxation to be oppressive.

YOUR cartoonist Bill deserves a hard skelp across the lug and his pens
confiscated for submitting such a grossly offensive parody (February
17).
Familiar with Bill's partiality for lampooning everything and anything
associated with the Union, I was yet unprepared for the viciousness of
his latest offering.
Ulster Unionists were portrayed in the role of the rioting England
fans at Lansdowne Road while in the lower stand were such innocents as
Gerry Adams. If this is what passes for a cartoonist's incisive wit,
it's time for Bill to consider a career change.

THE fears being voiced about another ideological upheaval in the NHS
should Labour be returned to power are misguided. The upheaval element
in the restructuring of the NHS brought about by the Conservatives stems
solely from the fact that this restructuring was imposed unilaterally.
It goes against the whole grain of the NHS, not to speak of the
anti-market, public-service ethos on whose basis the health service was
founded.
Hardly a day passes without fresh evidence coming to light of the
perverse incentives which are built into the internal market in health
care.
As we progressively discriminate against the elderly and the mentally
ill -- priority groups in any health care system worthy of the name --
and as the NHS moves ineluctably towards a reductionist concept of
repair medicine, or ''hernias for yuppies'', a fiasco looms which could
put the poll tax fiasco in the shade.
We cannot be too quick in picking up the trail of an imperfect, but
still value-based, NHS.

DR HARRY BURNS quite rightly blames smoking, alcohol abuse, unhealthy
eating, and general fecklessness for the increased mortality in
Drumchapel over Bearsden, but he then tries to blame the stress of
poverty for these bad habits (February 13).
There is no study which demonstrates that stress occurs more often in
one level of society than in any other.
He says that people in Sweden with a more equitable division of wealth
have a better life expectancy than the United States population, which
have greater per capita income but greater social divisions. He should
know better than that.
Sweden is a small, stable country with a largely Caucasian population
whereas the US is a huge, diverse country with a large multi-ethnic
immigrant population. The statistical comparison is just nonsense and
demonstrates a desire to justify his original premise regardless of the
facts.
In 40 years of general practice, more than 20 of them in Monklands, I
have seen many homes where poverty and ill health have gone hand in
hand, but often, in an equally poor house next door, I have seen people
living healthy and fulfilling lives.
Poverty is one factor among many which contribute to ill health and
early mortality. Government can improve wealth generally, but there is
no evidence that reducing the differential between the affluence of
Bearsden and the poverty of Drumchapel will affect the gap in the
relative longevity.
In animals, even human ones, those that perform better usually live
longer.
It is also interesting to note that in my 40 years as a GP I must have
made about 100,000 house calls. I never met a public health doctor or a
sociologist in any of them.

EATING whale meat evidently affects the brain. Your correspondent
seems to have dined well in the ''good old days'' (February 14).
Whales are mammals, not fish, and unlike all but a few fish species
are protected by both national and international laws from the
enterprise culture which rendered them virtually extinct.
Visitors to Renfrewshire's coast seeing the humpback whale have been
enthralled by its appearance and performances just offshore. It is the
first of its species ever to appear in Clyde waters and is globally
regarded as an endangered species.
The cleaner waters of the Clyde and the abundant small fish have
attracted it to our coastline, where such sights may well have been
regular before the Industrial Revolution and its inherent pollution.
Visitors should also make a point of viewing the spectacular herd of
more than 200 whooper swans near Inchinnan. Here the enterprise culture
is about to strike again and destroy the ancestral grazing grounds of
these legally protected visitors from Iceland.
Renfrewshire Enterprise, a quango of the whale-eating variety, plans
to plant a forest park where trees have never existed since the last ice
age. While such a scheme would be welcome at Linwood car plant or other
industrial deserts in the area, the present proposal has little to
commend it.
Whooper swans, like whales, may become once-in-a-lifetime visitors to
Renfrewshire in the future.

In life, the fabulously rich Doris Duke was suspicious of everyone
around her. In death, suspicions continue. As friends and acquaintances
vie for a share of her fortune there are claims that she was murdered,
and in a plot worthy of Poirot's attentions fingers are being pointed at
her bizarre butler
WE KNOW one thing for certain and that is that Doris Duke, ''the
richest girl in the world'', is dead. According to her obituary notices
the cause was ''pulmonary oedema resulting in cardiac arrest''. But was
it? She died on Thursday, October 28, 1993, and that is where the facts
run out and the allegations and gossip and rumours begin. Duke, a
strange, bewildering woman, left an estate valued at between $1200m and
$2000m.
The stewardship of the estate, one of the largest offered for probate
in New York, was left to the US Trust Company of New York and to Bernard
Lafferty, 49, who was her butler for six years. The Irish-born Lafferty
wears a ponytail, a gold stud earring, and a perpetual whimsical smile.
And before you can say Poirot or Miss Marple, all manner of Duke
intimates as well as doctors and nurses who treated her before her
death, at 80, are indicating that the butler did it. Most involved in
the controversy have a fiscal interest, for Duke wrote wills like others
write letters.
In the end it was Lafferty, the drink-challenged, affable Irishman who
would serve dinner in full butler's uniform, a real Jeeves except that
he would be barefooted, who in the final days became Duke's most trusted
confidante. In the last of scores of wills she wrote, Lafferty, as her
co-executor, would receive a $5m fee, $500,000 a year for life, and was
put in charge of her Doris Duke Charitable Foundation which is to
receive almost her entire fortune.
The proceeds from administering the foundation as a trustee are to the
financial horizon and worth many millions of dollars a year -- at least,
it is once the legal mess and possible murder investigation are sorted
out. As Duke's friend Claus Von Bulow -- who was charged and acquitted
of murdering his heiress wife Sunny -- found out, there could be a
reversal of fortune.
After nurse Tammy Payette, one of six who looked after the tobacco
heiress around the clock during the last days of her life, claimed Duke
''did not die of natural causes'' at her Beverly Hills mansion, the Los
Angeles District Attorney, Gil Garcetti, ordered a police investigation.
The move followed a New York court decision to investigate allegations
that Duke may have been murdered through systematically administered
overdoses of drugs instigated by Lafferty.
The intrigue and the sinister claims which are the top gossip from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills all revolve around the usual bottom line --
money. Duke's will is being challenged by several former employees,
including her doctor, Harry B Demopoulos, whose patients include Clint
Eastwood and Sylvester Stallone. He was named as her executor in a
previous will.
The charge that Duke died from ''a massive sedation regime'' was made
by nurse Tammy Payette in an affidavit filed in the New York probate
case. Payette accompanied the heiress in an ambulance from Cedars-Sinai
Medical Centre to her Beverly Hills estate, the lavish Falcon's Lair,
which was once owned by Rudolph Valentino, following her treatment for a
series of strokes.
She claims her patient was ''in good, stable condition and alert''.
She said Duke had the potential to get better and return ''to some form
of independence''. Duke's life expectancy, according to the nurse's
testimony, was at least five years. But Pearl Rosenstein, another nurse
who was on duty when Duke died, dismissed the murder claims
''I am horrified by the charges. Payette's assessment that Miss Duke
was recovering from her stroke and Payette's charge of a fiendish plot
to sedate the patient to death are contrary to the medical reality and
fly in the face of all reason. The medical care she received was
administered with the intention of sparing her pain and discomfort.
Doris Duke was never over-medicated.''
Enter the chef. Duke's cook, Colin Shanley, has filed an affidavit
which contradicts nurse Rosenstein. He says he was in the kitchen of
Falcon's Lair with Bernard Lafferty on the afternoon of the day before
Duke died. A package was delivered to the estate's back gate and
forwarded by a security guard. ''I received the parcel and read aloud to
Lafferty the sender and the addressee information,'' said Shanley, who
added: ''Upon hearing the information Lafferty leapt across the kitchen,
grabbed the parcel out of my hands and stated that 'Miss Duke is going
to die tonight'.''
Shanley said that at first he did not believe the butler because
Lafferty ''had made these claims numerous times in the previous
months''. But then there was the phone call.
''A short time later one of the afternoon-shift nurses came up to the
kitchen to use the phone. I heard her telling the night-shift nurses
that they 'wouldn't be needed'. I then began to suspect Lafferty's
statement might be true.''
Court papers filed by Raymond Dowd, a Manhattan lawyer representing
the chef, claim it was Rosenstein who made the call cancelling the
nurses' late shift. And the papers filed by Shanley's lawyer also say
that the package delivered to the kitchen 'contained a potentially
lethal dose of Demerol'.
Shanley also claims ''an eyewitness to Doris Duke's death told me that
Doris Duke had been murdered''.
Like just about every party in the case, Nurse Rosenstein has a
lawyer. Eric Dobberteen said from his Los Angeles office that he would
not comment on the allegations, but of Shanley he said: ''He's in
litigation with members of the estate. You draw your own conclusions.''
Suzelle Smith, who is representing Dr Demopoulos in his dispute of
Doris Duke's will, said the Duke estate had hired lawyers for Nurse
Rosenstein and was paying her legal bills.
This week more claims are expected in the New York and Los Angeles
courts. Police in both cities are ''fully co-operating'' in the bizarre
case which, in its way, mirrors Duke's life.
''The richest girl in the world'' -- the title of a 1992 biography of
Duke -- was not exactly accurate. The 1993 Forbes magazine 400-table
lists her as the 18th richest woman in America. But for Doris Duke it
was a million dollars there, a million dollars here. She was careful
about the arithmetic of her fortune. She just dealt in telephone
numbers.
She was 13 in 1925 when she inherited $100m in trusts from her father,
James Buchanan Duke. He was a rough diamond, a talented self-made man
who founded the American Tobacco Company and Duke Power Company. He
endowed Trinity College in North Carolina with millions of dollars on
the condition the university changed its name to Duke College.
Only one thing obsessed ''Buck'' Duke more than money -- his daughter.
He gave a deadline to builders to finish what was then the most
expensive house on New York's Fifth Avenue so Doris Duke could be born
at home on November 22, 1912. He named his private rail car and his
80-foot yacht after her. From birth she was surrounded by bodyguards.
She was taught at home until she was 10. As a youngster she wrote her
father love letters. He told her never to trust anyone and she once
confided: ''You know, my father always said no-one would ever love me
except for my money, and to be careful.''
She was, comparatively, careful with the money. Men were something
else.
At 14 she sued her mother Nanaline -- she was 42 when she gave birth
to Doris -- to stop her selling Duke Farms, the estate her father had
made out of New Jersey flatlands, which included a 30-room house, indoor
swimming pool, indoor tennis courts, artificial lakes, and man-made
hills. All her life -- despite estates in California and Hawaii and a
''cottage'' in Newport, Rhode Island -- Duke Farms was her main
''home''.
When she was 21 she received the first $10m of her inheritance. Two
years later she married James Cromwell who was 16 years older and whose
family had lost their fortune in the 1929 Wall Street crash. Their
honeymoon lasted two years as they tripped through the Middle East and
Asia.
A long honeymoon, but it did not last forever. Cromwell wanted her to
finance his political career but she in turn upset Eleanor Roosevelt by
snubbing her at a fund-raiser. Then, in what was to become a lifetime
habit, she hired private detectives to investigate her husband's
philandering.
Meanwhile, she wasn't being chaste. She had affairs with Errol Flynn,
the Hawaiian swimming champion Duke Kahanamiku, and British MP Alec
Cunningham-Reid. Divorce from Cromwell was inevitable. He wanted a $7m
settlement. She fought him for five years in the courts until he stopped
his demands. ''She thought everybody was after her money,'' said her
Brazilian friend Nelson Seabra, adding: ''I used to tell her, 'You know,
Doris, some people do like you for yourself'.''
It was something she never really believed. When she married legendary
lover Porfirio Rubirosa in 1947 she handed him a prenuptial contract at
the altar -- and this was nearly 40 years before palimony and the like.
''Rubi'' -- said to be in a constant state of erection and known in
French society as ''the peppermill'' -- was given a house in Paris as a
wedding gift. And more than one million dollars. A fortune.
Before they divorced within a year she also bought him a plane. Even
after his marriage to the Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton she still
gave him money and gifts. Their sex life did not end with the marriage.
''It was ironic that the man Doris loved most was the greatest gigolo of
all time,'' said her friend Marina Cicogna, adding: ''Sometimes people
are attracted to the thing they fear most.''
There were no more marriages but plenty of ''friends'', younger men
who were given her patronage and sometimes her bed. She studied ballet,
she sang in a gospel choir, she was a friend of Elvis, she donated $1m
to Elizabeth Taylor's Aids Foundation, she put up $5m for Imelda
Marcos's bail when she was indicted for racketeering, she had constant
cosmetic surgery and underwent much time on the ''magnetic rejuvenation
machine''.
In her 70s she would belly dance; her pet camels, Princess and Baby,
had freedom of the New Jersey mansion; and her world, if eccentic,
appeared reasonably carefree. But then came the paranoia, the writing
and rewriting of wills, the adoption of Chandi Heffer in 1988. Heffer
was 35 -- her new ''mother'' 75. Gossips said they were having a lesbian
affair. Others that Duke had always wanted a child and someone rather
than a bank or law firm to administer her estate.
But the two became estranged, and now Chandi Heffer has an outstanding
lawsuit against the Doris Duke estate. She is claiming breach of
contract, saying Duke had promised to maintain her in the Duke lifestyle
for the rest of her life.
Chandi Heffer lives on a 300-acre horse ranch on the Big Island of
Hawaii which Duke bought for her for $1.5m. She sleeps with a loaded
pistol on her bedside table. Paranoia is contagious.
So are legal costs.
Bernard Lafferty is said to be only semi-literate. He lunches with
William Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum, which was left $10m
by Doris Duke. He is involved in the Doris Duke Foundation for the
Preservation of Endangered Wildlife, the Doris Duke Foundation for the
Preservation of New Jersey Farmland and Farm Animals, and the Doris Duke
Foundation of Islamic Art. His power, say lawyers, over one of the
world's largest charitable trusts is ''awesome''. And, so far in this
bizarre tale, Bernard Lafferty has not wished to make any comment other
than issuing a terse statement: ''My duty to Miss Duke is to maintain
her privacy even though she is gone.''
But this week and in the weeks to come Doris Duke's sad end is going
to be examined and re-examined in the courts as those baying for a slice
of ''the richest girl in the world'' bring claim and counter-claim.
In the end ''Buck'' Duke got it right. Even dead, no-one appears to
care about Doris Duke except for her money.

THE report ''Pledge by Labour to ban NHS trusts'' (February 15) can
only be read with dismay both by staff working in the NHS and, very
importantly, by patients. The last thing the NHS in Scotland needs is
another reorganisation, with all its turbulence and uncertainty. (By my
count we have had five restructurings in the past 20 years.)
There is a real danger that patients' needs are not being addressed in
this debate. NHS trusts were set up to improve patient services. There
is real evidence this is starting to happen in the trusts already
established. I am confident the new trusts will do likewise.
To indicate that trusts will be brought back into the NHS is
misinformation on a grand scale. Trusts are firmly in the NHS and
provide treatment free at the point of need -- the founding principle of
the NHS.

YOUR columns have not exactly been crammed with protests at the latest
insult to nurses and teachers.
I do not have any children but I wish to see the future generations of
this country having some hope of becoming fair-minded and responsible
people, or am I just old-fashioned in believing that our salvation is
through education?
I also have had little or no requirement of our health service so far
in my life, but I want to see our future generations well cared for and
encouraged to take action on their own health.
This cannot and will not be achieved without good nursing staff, whose
morale must now be rock bottom.

MARGARET VAUGHAN falls into the age-old trap of confusing moral
absolutes with the people who practise or proclaim them (February 16).
The fact is that, whether we abide by them or even believe in them,
these absolutes are the rule of life.
If I hate someone enough to kill them; if I want something so badly
that I am prepared to steal to get it; if I fancy my neighbour's wife
and commit adultery with her, then I automatically unleash forces and
trains of events over which I have no control and for which I shall be
accountable.
Likewise, if someone at the close of my years decides that, for
whatever reason or motive, my existence should be terminated, then it is
they, not I, who will have to answer; first, because they do not know
where they are sending me, and secondly, because they do not know the
extent of my will, awareness, or understanding.

JULIET STEVENSON's return to the stage (after giving birth to a
daughter) shows that she has lost none of her verve. Taking on the
mantle of one of the most ravaged of Jacobean heroines -- the widow who
defies patriarchy, marries in secret, and pays dearly for it -- she
gives us a Duchess hot in sexuality, headstrong, defiant, but quite
contrary to the picture of wronged innocence commonly served up.
In jail (the one imaginatively designed part of Tom Piper's otherwise
surprisingly dull and unattractive set), she rises nobly above the
mental tortures and the traps laid by her brother, Ferdinand, meeting
death with frantic but courageous despair.
But in Philip Franks's workaday production, Stevenson's performance,
while impressive, is unmoving. Overall, one looks in vain for irony or
ambiguity. Only in the dying minutes, when all the male conspirators --
the Duchess's brothers and their reluctant henchman Bosola -- have
turned on each other and laughed themselves into an absurd grave, does
something of the play's glittering irony and stench of mortality begin
to ooze out into the auditorium.
Simon Russell Beale, meanwhile, after a muddled start, almost becomes
the fulcrum of the play. He makes Ferdinand a singularly destructive
presence, suggesting that the jealousy eating away at him lies in
overarching possessiveness. Pathetic and distraught, he's like a mad
child who destroys a much-loved toy just to make sure no-one else will
have it.
Stevenson's Duchess, on the other hand, is unapologetically her own
woman. Interesting but as yet not entirely convincing, I can't quite see
this production making it to the West End as is currently planned. But
we'll see.

At last the oboe has shaken off its pastoral image. Michael Tumelty
reveals how John Maxwell Geddes has elevated it to stardom in a new
concerto
COMPOSER John Maxwell Geddes is reaching for the stars. Again. It's
almost eight years since his spectacular orchestral piece, Voyager,
coinciding with the return of Halley's Comet, took off into the galaxy
in a blaze of shooting stars. Since then Voyager has made a few orbits
of the globe, with performances in Russia, Poland, Germany, the United
States, and dozens in Britain, including many BBC broadcasts.
Wherever this most-travelled of Geddes's works is at the moment, in
the metaphorical planetary system, it is about to be joined by a new
work that also climbs to the stars. Geddes has written his first
concerto for the Paragon Ensemble and its founder-oboist, Jonathan Small
(now principal with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra).
The age of 53 may seem a little late to be writing your first
concerto, but it's a form that Geddes has always resisted. For a start,
until a few years back he had a day job, training teachers to teach. ''I
was getting to the stage where I was worrying that I couldn't accept
commissions: composing takes all your time and energies.''
So he now restricts his contact with students -- which he finds
rejuvenating -- to supervising a group of young composers at the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, and devotes himself fully to
composition. And he has been extremely busy.
Last week there were performances of three of his works. Yesterday
another three were played in Glasgow. Today and tomorrow his Dances at
Threave receive east coast performances. At the weekend the new concerto
will be unveiled. Next week the Glasgow Wind Band play his Galloway
Bouquet. Also in the immediate future his music is being played in
London, Copenhagen, and St Petersburg.
Among all this activity, the idea of concerto composition did not
appeal. ''It wasn't a form that I'd even thought about before; the idea
in a concerto of struggle or strife between a virtuoso soloist wrestling
against the great dinosaur of the orchestra frankly never appealed to
me. I always enjoyed the symphonic paintbox without the strife.''
Part of the persuasion in taking this most fastidious craftsman of a
composer towards his first concerto was that the commission was for the
oboe, the instrument he has played since a child.
He recognised instantly the challenges in writing for an instrument
that has not attracted the great body of composers. ''It's not perceived
as a concerto instrument,'' he said. ''It's not exactly the heroic horn
or the bardic cello, is it?
''The conventional role for the oboe has been a rustic one, all the
way from Bach through to Berlioz. In Bach, whenever God's mentioned,
it's high trumpets. But as soon as you get to the lowly shepherds in the
fields, it's out with the oboes. The oboe has been typecast --
everything from a sad shepherd to a manic pine cone.'' So Geddes is out
to dispense with the exclusively pastoral image of the oboe.
In addition, he is aware of the technical limitations of the
instrument. ''There are problems of stamina: it is a tiring instrument
to play. It has the smallest range of any pitched instrument. And it
certainly has the smallest dynamic range -- its cousins the flute and
clarinet can easily appear to be more virtuosic.''
So Geddes has set out to create an expressive role for the instrument
in an environment where the surrounding, lightly-scored orchestral
forces are carefully controlled, ''It's an oboist's piece,'' he said.
''I've deliberately put the brakes on virtuosity in the ensemble. It's
big chamber music rather than an orchestral piece.''
The starting point for the new concerto, which is in a single
movement, was in a piece of American folklore. Geddes read an Indian
legend about a sacred mountain in Oregon where young men of the tribe
were sent alone for four days and nights to fast and meditate until they
received their ''spirit song'', which could be recalled only in moments
of crisis.
Though the programmatic element became distilled during the course of
composition of the concerto, Geddes admits that ''I still have
associations with the soloist representing a lonely figure, wandering
through a series of landscapes -- sometimes exotic, sometimes hostile,
sometimes indifferent -- until he finds his destiny, his 'spirit song',
in a starscape.''
The starscape, with which the concerto culminates, is evoked by
vibraphone and string harmonics and is, said the composer, ''transparent
with exotic textures, ethereal and quite glacial, fading away to
nothing''.
Soloist Jonathan Small is so delighted with the new piece that he has
already asked the composer to rescore it for full orchestra so that he
can perform it with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and on several
concerto dates he has in Sweden. ''Maybe I'll leave that sort of
rewriting until my real retirement,'' said John Maxwell Geddes.
* Paragon dates: RSAMD, Glasgow, Sunday February 26, 7.45pm; Queen's
Hall, Edinburgh, Monday February 27, 8pm; Lemon Tree, Aberdeen, Sunday
March 5, 7.30pm.

EDDIE IZZARD is on the road. From Southampton to Glasgow (Royal
Concert Hall on Friday); from Dublin and Exeter to Aberdeen (Music Hall,
Saturday) and Edinburgh (Playhouse, Sunday); from Guildford to Aviemore
(Speyside Theatre, April 1). Whoo-hoo! Way-hey! Excess all areas!
''When you think of rock'n'roll bands on the road, the image is of TV
sets being chucked out of hotel windows,'' says Eddie. ''Comedians are
more cash-conscious. If we threw tellies through windows, there'd have
to be a net to catch them in. Actually, comedians gently lob extra
tellies into their hotel-rooms so they can have two to watch.''
Praise be for Eddie's convoluted, whimsical thought-processes, which
he employs to unravel fresh skeins of mirth on the spot. Mention of TV
-- to which Eddie has hitherto appeared to have had an aversion --
brings us to Eddie's long-overdue sitcom, The Cows. ''I'm writing it
with Nick Whitby now, and there'll be a Channel 4 pilot recorded in
June. Character and structure and plot . . . I'm not very good on those
areas, which are Nick's strengths.
''I'll be filming with Antoine des Caunes soon, too, in a series aimed
at teaching French to kids. Communication first, grammar second . . .
that's my theory of language.''
Just go out and bally well do it would seem to be another of Eddie's
practical theories. Following his two successful forays last year on to
the London West End stage -- in The Cryptogram, by David Mamet, and
David Beaird's 900 Oneonta -- Eddie will next be thesping as the star of
one of Will Shakespeare's biggies, Richard III, in London's Regent's
Park open-air theatre, directed by Brian Cox.
''The Cryptogram got me from 0-60, but this is another big leap
altogether. It's the thing I always wanted as a kid, to be approached by
a famous director and asked to star in a big part. And it is a big part,
and a big play. Someone said that if Hamlet is a one-ghost play, then
Richard III is a 12-ghost play.
''I used to loathe Shakespeare at school, but now I realise how bloody
good his stories are. I want to be true to the verse and at the same
time I want to get the sense of that story over to people. And I'll
either be crap at it, or I'll learn from it.
''And I've been asked to do a film. By Christopher Hampton, of Les
Liaisons Dangereuse, who's directing another film he's written, his
version of Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent. I've only got a small part --
Bob Hoskins is the star -- but Christopher Hampton asked me! I keep
getting offered things that I ought to be fighting to get!''
Eddie was also offered a Radio 4 series. It's called Misdemeanours. It
was recorded last month, employing the formidable comic talents of
co-hosts Stephen Frost and Neil Mullarkey, and such illustrious guests
as Jo Brand, Mark Lamarr, Lee Cornes, Donna McPhail, and Mark Steele. It
is scheduled to start its early evening Monday-night run soon.
''It's a talking-a-load-of-old-bollocks panel game, loosely like Have
I Got News For You. A researcher goes away and researches things -- like
the history of the motor car, the life of George III, how submarines
work -- and then we write lies about the same subjects and read them out
as the truth. My gut feeling on this one is that it'll work really
well.''
Any gut feelings towards Scotland? Any message for us, your devoted
laughter-slaves?
''Message? Um . . . ah . . . oooh . . . when you tell people in London
that you're doing gigs in Glasgow, they go pale and say: 'Remember the
Glasgow Empire . . . English comics' graveyard.' It's nonsense. When I
first did stand-up in Glasgow, at the Theatre Royal, the audience were
so lovely and so educated they let me do a whole 15-minute routine in
French . . . everywhere else I'd had to do a running translation.
''I'm looking forward to playing in Aviemore. I want to do what Billy
Connolly did, and play in theatres in the far north. I did Fort William
on my last UK tour -- I actually beat Billy Connolly to it. Although he
did get more of a crowd than I did: there were 35 people in a
1000-seater theatre . . . it was crazy, but it was great.
''But a message for Scotland . . . People of Scotland! Hear me address
you in a voice like that of Charlton Heston! I love your Highlands! Keep
your mountains pointing upwards!''
OK. And we pledge allegiance to your comedy peaks, too.

seven-week stint at London's Albery Theatre.

DAWN UPSHAW sure knows how to work an audience. She shot straight into
her first song the moment she hit front stage, focusing attention on her
voice while the impact of her glittering dress was still hot on the
retina.
A zap through pantomime from Debussy's Vasnier songbook and then there
she was delivering a chummy introduction, putting everyone at ease,
mapping out the format for the rest of the Vasnier songs that were to
lead up to the interval.
Heady stuff as it turned out. This relaxed stage presence was matched
with effortless command over Debussy's exaggerated interval leaps to the
upper register.
What was also in evidence was this singer's abundant expressiveness,
which poured out not only through her convincing articulated French but
from a rich vocabulary of body language and gestures.
Plenty of power in the voice to accompany its agility, and she missed
none of the opportunities for projection which this song cycle provided.
Perhaps after a while all this intensity tended towards the daunting,
the thrill proving more satisfying with eye averted from all the
attendant movement.
After the interval there were songs by Copland, Ruth Crawford Seeger,
and Alban Berg, all of which again suited the taut brightness of this
voice.
As in the first half, however, there might have been room for a bit of
shade from the radiance.
Robin Bowman accompanied impeccably and the small but enthusiastic
gathering obviously enjoyed the performance enormously, their applause
eliciting no less than four encores.
Judge for yourself when the recital is broadcast on Radio 3, March 11
as part of its Songlines series.

I READ with interest Gavin Bell's moving account of how Jackie Stewart
coped with his dyslexia (February 14). His experiences reflect those of
many people who in the past were written off because of their
difficulties.
However, I have to take issue with two major points in the article.
The assertion that ''virtually no provision is made for them in regular
schools'' may have been true 20 years ago but it is certainly not the
case now.
As a learning support teacher I have worked with dyslexic pupils in
mainstream schools in Grampian, Central, and Strathclyde.
Many schools have excellent support strategies for dyslexic pupils and
there must be very few schools in Scotland where there is no recognition
of such difficulties and where there are no special arrangements made
for these pupils to enable them to have suitable support with their
Standard Grade and Higher exams. Indeed many pupils with these
difficulties will benefit from the new Spoken English exam.
Dyslexic pupils are best supported by a range of strategies, including
use of scribes, dictaphones, laptop computers, and predictive language
software which enable them to access the mainstream curriculum in a way
best suited to their needs.
Usually this is co-ordinated by a learning support specialist who will
be qualified to deal with a range of learning difficulties, including
dyslexia.
Part of the learning support specialist's role is to raise awareness
of specific learning difficulties, and teaching strategies to support
them, with all staff that the pupil will come into contact with.
This is an issue for all teachers in all schools. Perpetuating the
myth that dyslexic teachers are the answer only serves to marginalise
these pupils and the very real difficulties they face.

I ASKED Dr David Clark, Shadow Secretary of State for Defence, what
was Labour's stance within its devolution plans on the possible
re-forming of merged and cut Scottish infantry regiments.
He assures us that Labour would have a full defence review to
establish the UK's true requirements.
This was all that we had asked of the Conservative Government. In
rejecting our request, the Government stated that the decision to cut
the infantry was that of the senior officers in whose judgment they had
complete confidence.
It is the same seniority of officers who twice now in recent months
have had to resign or retire as the same Government apparently no longer
has confidence in their judgment.
When will this Government realise that its judgment has long been
questioned and do the ''honourable thing'' itself?

THERE is a nastiness abroad in this country; a grasping greed which
makes its acquisitiveness more offensive by a pretence of worth. It is
to be found in certain boardrooms where executive officers of large
businesses award themselves pay rises and perks which are far above the
percentages offered to their employees and which in most cases are
utterly unearned. This is not news. It would be impossible to have read
this newspaper in recent months without becoming acquainted with the
remuneration (such a cosy, euphemistic word) of the likes of Mr Cedric
Brown of British Gas, who believes himself worthy of a 75% increase to
#475,000 per annum, or Lord Alexander of NatWest, who is merely the
latest executive to be gifted a large bonus while many of his staff get
nothing. It is easy to be angered by these appalling examples but that
is not a sufficient response; it is perfectly possible to fling
adjectival outrage at Mr Brown and Lord Alexander but their corporate
complacency is impervious. What is needed is an analysis of the
conditions which allowed this situation to develop, to examine the
justifications produced for it and to suggest ways of distributing the
rewards for hard and successful work more equitably.
The first lesson to learn is that the present Government will be no
help at all. Mr Major professes himself disappointed by evidence of the
greed of some corporate officers but his only response is that the
remedy should be left to shareholders. This ignores, as he knows well,
the fact that many large companies have institutional shareholders whose
block votes are unlikely to be used to upset the applecart. The
Confederation of British Industry, which is more attuned to public
opinion than the Government, has formed a study group to examine the
question. This has been criticised because seven of the 11 members of
the group received nearly #4m in remuneration, including share options,
in the last financial year. Criticism of this sort is not wholly
justified. The people in question, including chairman Sir Richard
Greenbury of Marks and Spencer, are genuine entrepreneurs who have
created money for their companies and who are actively involved in
developing methods of distributing better wages to their employees. The
proper target of both public anger and of the CBI's inquiry is the
extraordinary behaviour of the officers of the privatised companies and
utilities who operate virtual monopolies, who have displayed no
entrepreneurial behaviour whatsoever, who pretend that their
remuneration is the going market rate when no other serious company in
its right mind would be tempted to headhunt them, and whose motivation
is no higher than a rush to riches before they are taken over or
deposed.
Add to this the banks, many of whom have served Britain and their
customers ill in recent years. NatWest is a case in point. The reported
#1600m profits sounds wonderful. Should Lord Alexander and his executive
team get the credit? Most emphatically not. The significant portion of
the profits is accounted for by the declining need to write off money
against bad debts, and those bad debts were acquired by the stupid
lending practises of the executives in NatWest and other banks who now
make a virtue of the fact that their past mistakes are fading with the
passage of time. The banks are also one of the repositories of the
short-termism which has plagued the British economy for the past two
decades. This decrees that money lent or invested must be done so on the
basis of a fast return. What this means is that insufficient attention
is given to small and start-up businesses and to enabling established
industries to make proper capital investments. For instance, much is
made of the lack of entrepreneurs in Scotland. This is nonsense.
Enlightened studies have shown that there are plenty of good business
ideas in this country, and men and women willing to take the risks to
develop them. What they are plagued by is the inability to borrow
capital. Start, then, with banking which is closer to customers and
which is not conducted by managers who are required to do their duty by
means of Pavlovian responses to predetermined stimuli from head office.
Continue the process by developing economic policies which would not
only deliver sustainable growth, but which would also lead to long-term
business planning and the investment of money in education and
industrial training. That way we will have more jobs and better wages.
As for the undeserving executives, they should be left to wither in
their gilded boardrooms. They are a function of the present times and
unlikely to survive beyond the next General Election.

IT is strange how many US Presidents have found the time to play golf.
Not many of them have been very good at it, of course, or at least
pretended not to be. Being bad at golf, say public relations experts, is
a sure way for politicians to gain support. Knowing that even the most
powerful man in the world has difficulty with a two-foot putt accounts
for the affection in which so many Presidents are held, even after
demitting office. An excellent case was the recent Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic tournament at Indian Wells, California, in which President
Clinton lined up with two former Presidents, Mr George Bush and Mr
Gerald Ford. ''I would advise people to stay behind us,'' said Mr Ford,
who is notorious for his erratic drives.
It was Mr Bush who hit the first bystander, however, when a shot
cannoned off a tree and broke the glasses of Mrs Norma Early, who was
taken to hospital on a golf trolley. He hit another spectator at the
14th, and Mr Ford did the same at the 17th, while President Clinton's
only wayward shot was into the back garden of a house. All in all,
allowing for a number of ''mulligans'', or free shots, and ''gimmes'',
or conceded putts, the Presidents did quite well. Mr Ford was said to
have scored exactly 100, while Presidents Clinton and Bush recorded 93
and 92 respectively, which will have warmed the cockles of a normal
golfer's heart. Any President who cracked 80, especially while in
office, would certainly lose votes.
With the notable exception of Arthur Balfour, few British politicians
have been keen golfers. John Major and Kenneth Clarke prefer football
and cricket, Normnan Lamont is said to play a mean game of table tennis,
but Michael Heseltine and Malcolm Rifkind confess to no sporting
interests at all and Douglas Hurd's one relaxation is ''writing
thrillers''. The only US President totally ignorant of sport seems to
have been Ulysses S Grant. When a friend took him to a golf course, in
an attempt to introduce him to the game, he watched a beginner hacking
away at the grass. ''It seems excellent exercise,'' he said. ''But what
is the little white ball for?''

THREE years ago the Royal Lyceum staged a version of the Arthurian
legends that was rude and funny, scatty and demanding.
In contrast you might expect a youth theatre treatment of the same
subject to go for a cute, soft-centred approach.
What's interesting about the National Youth Music Theatre's Pendragon,
however, is how much more hard-hearted it is.
Here, Arthur is no whiter-than-white hero, but an impetuous boy with
nasty misogynist and authoritarian streaks.
He is plagued by his spiteful half-sister Morgan and her malicious
magical curses.
Even Merlin is less a maverick guardian than a hard-nosed warlord with
a shrewd eye towards political expediency.
Appropriately then for a company with no member over 20, Pendragon
becomes a rites-of-passage drama in which the young Arthur must not only
battle with giants, dragons, and human adversaries, but also learn
humility if he is to lay a moral claim to the title of king that has
been supernaturally bestowed on him.
The NYMT production is in a league of its own in terms of slick
confidence, imaginative theatrical polish, and musical control.
I can't help feeling, though, that it doesn't have the nerve to settle
anywhere, to let a little spontaneity slip through the cracks in the
gloss. It's impressive and enjoyable but also rather bland.
One point of note: the young Morgan is played by Hayley Gelling.
Remember the name. Just a wee slip of a thing at only 12 years old, she
is a singer and actor of unnerving maturity.
If she makes it through puberty all right, the odds are in favour of
her turning into a major star.

IF you must have an alliance, even an auld one, you could do worse
than to have it with the French. They give us claret and Flodden; we
give them whisky, freshly killed animals, and the perpetually
tantalising possibilities of the kilt.
We don't say the French today know as little about the 700-year-old
Anglophobia pact as we do, but we couldn't help but overhear the garcon
on BBC Scotland's Saturday night celebration of the thing vouchsafing
the fact that nudity beneath the kilt arose, so to speak, merely to
facilitate post-battle ravishing. This will be splendid news for country
dancers everywhere.
Otherwise, for our money, the highlight of the night was an episode of
Tin Tin in the Highlands. Mais oui, the boy detective wore his kilt, but
at no point was it stated what, if anything, he wore beneath. This was a
blow, but it brought back, in the way of such things, memories of the
miners' strike and a certain Edinburgh Gala.
Mick McGahey is on the platform and greeting, as only he can,
fraternal delegates from France. Mick speaks of socialism, of struggle,
of solidarity. ''An' at this juncture,'' he adds, ''we'd just like to
welcome wir comrade Tintin.''
Astonishment all round among weary and grizzled colliers. At last, a
glimpse of victory. Forces of darkness routed, Thatcherism crushed, case
solved. Allez NUM! How could they lose? Alas, the perfectly decent but
distressingly ordinary French trade unionist who turned up with the
unfortunate name was not able to promise to set Snowy on the coal board
or form the Thompson Twins into a flying picket.
It was, with hindsight, an historic setback.
* AT this point, though, it is as well to remember that Norman Irons,
SNP Lord Provost of Edinburgh, is a man well known for his love of robes
and flummeries, the kilt not least among them. He won't abseil in the
garment, for obvious reasons, but otherwise his pride in the national
dress knows no bounds.
Which may be why certain items on the LP's busy schedule are known,
informally, as KWOs. That's Kilt Wearing Opportunities.
Faux pas
KILTS apart, however, we could see nothing wrong with the despatch of
elements of Edinburgh District Council, Lothian region, the Lothian and
Borders Pipe Band, and a Scotland under-16 team to Paris to renew the
venerable alliance, promote tourism, watch the game, lose John Jeffrey
along the way, have words avec Wark, and get an early night.
Sadly, other diaries were less generous. Scotland on Sunday's sporting
almanac went so far as to describe the initiative as something
approaching a junket, of all things, while churlishly doubting its
obvious worth. ''Heaven help Paris,'' wrote Graham Spiers, ''they're all
out there . . .''
Remembering that Neil Drysdale, rugby man for the SoS, was also in
attendance, he went on: ''I'm writing these words on Friday evening, but
here are bets on Drysdale's back-page piece today beginning thus:
''Pride, passion, tartan-terrored trauma. Alas, it wasn't enough. We got
gubbed.'' Tragically for the Mystic Meg of the sporting press, the
impetuous Drysdale was in fact obliged to record: ''This was history in
the making, and those of us lucky enough to be present will never forget
it.'' Something to do with the score, apparently.
Huns and Hibs
HOW TO annoy a Hearts fan: describe Monday night's cup-tie cryptically
as ''Big Huns versus Wee Huns''. How to annoy a Hibs fan: Wee Huns 4;
Big Huns 2.
Fitting send-off
MANY, fulsome, and puzzling have been the tributes to Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn, some even going so far as to call his death untimely. Since
he once threatened to sue us for an entirely accurate account of a
stupendously racist speech he had given (nationhood and the ''bastards
of black airmen'', you'll recall) we don't feel obliged to join the
chorus. Oddly, we don't recall actually being sued either.
We can, however, note that fate contrived a fitting send-off for the
Beast of Fordell with a coincidental Commons exchange on the lifestyles
of MPs this week. Inter alia, as Fairbairn might have said, Labour's
Tony Banks argued: ''Isn't it about time we had a proper programme that
sets an example -- and that we had healthy minds and bodies in this
House?''
As Mr Blair might say, never promise what you can't deliver. Healthy
bodies are one thing . . .
Sheik up
GIVEN that it has now been acquired by the Abu Dhabi Investment
Company, will we henceforth be obliged to describe the HCI hospital at
Clydebank as a white camel?
Viva Las Vegas
LIKE US, you've probably spent years wondering how to describe the
multiplicity of nutters in white rhine-stoned jump suits and floppy
quiffs who spend their days and nights tormenting the ouevre of Elvis
Aaron Presley. Help is at hand.
Two choices of collective noun are available apparently. Either you
can opt for ''Elvises'' or (rather biblical, this) ''Elvi''. If you
happen to be in Las Vegas you can flesh out the difference by turning
your Kings into competing teams of sky-divers, watching one jumper land
heavily on an Oldsmobile Delta 88, and then booking a seat in court to
see which of the plummeting heirs is declared legitimate.
To explain: in 1992 the actor Nicholas Cage starred in a comedy movie
entitled Honeymoon in Vegas. This featured an entirely fictitious troupe
of sky-diving Presleys precisely as ridiculous as you might imagine.
Vegas being Vegas, however, the satire was promptly turned into a
perfectly serious entertainment and marketing concept by impresario
Richard Feeney.
Thus were born the Flying Elvi.
Early in 1993, however, Elvi Mark Miscevic bounced off said
Oldsmobile, shook, rattled, and rolled, landed in a coma, and awoke to
the revelation that there was room in the world for Flying Elvises as
well as Elvi. Feeney sued in court, claiming ''interference with
business opportunity'' among other things, prompting Miscevic to
counter-sue in the name of free enterprise and curled lips everywhere.
All concerned will drop into court again next month where a judge,
according to our correspondent, will sort out suit, countersuit and
jumpsuit.

Steve Bruce reports how Ian Paisley's brand of politics and religion
remains a potent factor in Ulster
IN early 1946, in a small church in East Belfast, a tall young cleric
came face-to-face with one of his heroes. At the end of the service
William P Nicholson, the great Ulster revival preacher, walked to the
communion table, rapped it and said to the youthful preacher: ''Young
man, have you ever seen a cow's tongue?'' The young man replied: ''Yes,
sir.'' Nicholson asked: ''What is it like?'' ''It is like a file,'' came
the reply. Nicholson lifted his hand and prayed: ''Lord, give this young
man a tongue like an old cow!'' When Ian Paisley related that tale 40
years later, he paused for a moment, and added: ''And some people would
say perhaps that prayer has been answered far more abundantly than we
can ask or even think'' and burst out laughing.
Well he might laugh. The 60-strong East Belfast congregation grew into
the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and now has over 10,000 members
in 50 congregations in Northern Ireland and 20 churches in Australia,
Canada, the United States, England and Scotland. The Democratic Unionist
Party which Paisley founded in 1971 has three MPs and over 100
councillors. His own position as Ulster's most popular Unionist
politician is unassailable.
Church and party share similar roots. For Paisley the Northern Ireland
conflict is a religious conflict. In politics as in religion the real
enemy is the false faith of popery. However much Catholic Church leaders
condemn violence, the Church will be happy to see Ulster, one of the
last strongholds of the pure gospel in Europe, destroyed.
The first step in resisting Romanism is to separate from the
''ecumaniacs'' in the main Protestant Churches who weaken the gospel by
promoting liberal theology and closer ties with the old enemy. The first
step in politics is to separate from those Unionists who cannot be
trusted to resist Irish nationalism.
Although friendly, almost mild, when sitting shoeless in front of his
fire, like the biblical prophets who are his role models, the public Ian
Paisley is a controversialist, never so much at home as when denouncing
apostasy. In this his personality has been firmly shaped by his culture.
The evangelical Protestant world with its emphasis on individual
conscience is naturally disputatious and schism-ridden: Paisley's father
quit the Baptist Union and established an independent church in the
North Antrim market town of Ballymena. The Ulster evangelical world is
also permanently under siege, threatened by Irish Catholicism without
and the unreliable friends of the British Government within.
Paisley was well prepared for his future career. As a teenager he went
to Barry School of Evangelism in South Wales where he learnt the hard
craft of preaching to rowdy audiences. He then returned to study
theology with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, the descendants of the
Scottish Covenanters, in Belfast. His early efforts as an orator brought
the invitation to minister to a small group which had broken away from
an Irish Presbyterian congregation in East Belfast.
In politics as in religion, Paisley was always on the radical
separatist and alarmist wing. In the 1950s he was active in a variety of
Unionist ginger groups and was befriended by William Nixon, a maverick
Unionist politician who had been forced to resign from the police under
suspicion of involvement in vigilante murders of Catholics in Belfast in
the 1920s.
His critics accuse Paisley of creating the present troubles by
preventing the redress of legitimate Catholic grievances. A hostile
biography called him a ''malign colossus''. This credits Paisley with
far too much power and influence. The speed with which the civil rights
agitation became traditional Irish nationalism showed that the partition
of the island in 1921 had only delayed, not settled, the conflict.
Paisley's leadership of street opposition to the civil rights movement
and to the hesitant response of Terence O'Neill's government only
hastened the inevitable resumption of battle; it did not cause it.
In 1968 O'Neill called what turned out to be the last General Election
for the Stormont parliament. In his famous ''Ulster at the Crossroads''
speech he declared that this was the last chance for Ulster to deal with
its problems while keeping Westminster at arm's length. Paisley stood
against O'Neill and ran him close enough to force him from office. In a
victory speech that would have sounded bizarre anywhere else in the
United Kingdom, Paisley called: ''Oh God, save Ulster from popery! Oh
God, save Ulster from apostasy! Oh God, save Ulster from going into an
Irish Republic! Save Ulster from being sold down the river! Oh God, give
us a great deliverance!''
Paisley won the by-election and later the same year took the
Westminster seat for North Antrim. As the Unionist Party collapsed into
factions, Paisley founded his Democratic Unionist Party and gradually
established it as the guarantor of Unionism, not only wining his own
electoral mandate but also, by offering conservative Unionists the
option of defecting to a more rigorous position, ensuring that the
Ulster Unionist party returned to orthodoxy.
For all the outsiders see him as a narrow Protestant bigot, Paisley is
well-known for his efforts on behalf of his constituents, Catholic and
Protestant. That goes some way to explaining his record of seven
consecutive Westminster victories, but parochial labours cannot explain
his Ulster-wide popularity. For elections to the European parliament,
Northern Ireland is treated as a single constituency with three seats.
In each of the four elections Paisley has come first, with between 29%
and 33% of the votes cast. Every one of those results has stuck in the
throat of a British Government that has spent 25 years searching for a
mythical middle ground of liberal Protestants and Catholics, and wishing
to believe that ''the ordinary people of Northern Ireland'', to use John
Major's patronising phrase, really disgree with their elected
representatives. In the 1980s the DUP vote slipped as Unionists trickled
back to the Ulster Unionist Party but Paisley defied every prediction of
his demise.
During Paisley's wilderness years he acquired some unsavoury
followers. Even friends have sometimes questioned the wisdom of certain
associations. In the late 1960s some of his cohorts were so sure that
compromising with nationalists would simply encourage the IRA to revive
its military campaign that they did not wait for the then moribund IRA
to act. They pretended to be the IRA and blew up a number of public
utilities.
The case for the prosecution, echoed by many disillusioned Loyalist
terrorists, is that Paisley encouraged young men to take up arms, while
making sure he was always able to deny responsibility.
The truth is more complex and less dramatic. Paisley is certainly not
a pacifist but nor does he condone terror. He believes that in return
for its protection, the citizen gives up to the modern state the
legitimate right to use violence.
If the state fails in its duty, the citizen is released from that
obligation and has the right to act in his own defence. In 1912 Ulster
Unionists had a right to form the UVF and arm themselves to resist
British attempts to expel them from the Union. At least three times in
the Troubles he has tried to repeat that popular mobilisation. In 1974,
with the leaders of all the other Unionist parties, he actively
supported the General Strike which brought down the power-sharing
executive. In 1977 he encouraged the UDA to repeat the strike tactic.
In 1981 he led 500 men on to a wet hillside and had them wave their
firearm certificates. But he has consistently denounced Loyalist
terrorism on the twin grounds that the murder of innocents is unbiblical
and that the state has not yet so flagrantly abandoned its obligations
to its citizens that they are justified in going beyond preparation. His
response to the recent upsurge of Loyalist killings was clear enough: he
called for the restoration of the death penalty.
Paisley possesses, or is possessed by, the drive of the prophet.
Encouraged by the belief that he is doing God's will, he is little
troubled by self-doubt. He throws himself into grand schemes with the
enthusiasm of Toad of Toad Hall, and has the same attention span. It is
left to others to make those schemes work.
His church has consolidated its growth with a theology college, an
impressive number of debt-free modern church buildings, and a number of
independent Christian schools because it has been run by a core of quiet
diplomatic men quite unknown outside church circles.
The DUP has not been so fortunate. The evangelical Protestant theology
and the rituals of the church give it solidity and allow lesser mortals
to get on with their jobs. The party is much more dependent on the
person of Paisley and the shadow he cast has been too diming for a
series of bright ambitious young men who have been unable to survive the
squabbling that goes on around the master's coat tails.
When, as Paisley put it, the Lord decides he has finished his work and
calls him home, his political coat may be donned by his son Ian Paisley
Jr. That is itself the cause of dark mutterings among some of the
faithful.
It is a mark of the father's restless energy that it will take two
sons to succeed him. While Ian junior prepares to inherit the politics,
his brother Kyle preaches the gospel as a Free Presbyterian minister.
Sensibly he has begun his career a long way from the comparisons with
his father that would blight his ministry in Ulster. He is presently
bringing a light to the darkness of East Sussex.
Clearly the British Government hopes otherwise but it may yet be some
time before Paisley retires. Although only six years younger, he talks
of the 75-year-old James Molyneaux, for whom he had a great deal of
affection, as though he were of an earlier generation.
The mountains of home baking that are the required accompaniment to
any church event will have done his heart no favours but he has never
smoked or drunk alcohol and his father lived into his 80s.
Dismissed as a Jeremiah when he denounced the Downing Street
declaration as a ''sell-out to republican scum'', his reputation for
foresight is reviving as details of the London-Dublin framework for the
future of Northern Ireland are leaked.
At present it is still difficult to see how the Unionist desire to
remain British can be reconciled with the nationalist desire for a
united Ireland but if a popular settlement is achieved that will be the
time for Paisley to retire. His unwavering conviction that he is right,
his commitment to the cause, his inspiring oratory, and his perpetual
vigilance against betrayal have made him a highly effective leader of
the opposition.
Even if his past had not made him unacceptable to most Catholics and
many liberal Protestants, it is hard to imagine him running an
administration. But there is a long journey between the present truce
and a lasting peace and in the meantime there is a war of words and
votes to be fought. Ulster still needs ''a great deliverance'' and Ian
Paisley, so often written off, still believes he is the man to deliver
it.

THERE was bad news last week for anyone who has bought a computer
recently: Intel has produced a chip twice as fast as the Pentium (which
is the current world champion chip). It will work at 250mips (million
instructions per second) and 133 megahertz, with 5.5m transistors -- all
compared with Pentium's 100 mips, 60 MH and 3.1m transistors.
I'm not at all sure what all this means, except that Pentiums will be
sold at half price before the year is out, and those antique chips known
by numbers (386, 486) will be given away. After all, who wants last
year's technology? And if you spent a couple of grand on a
top-of-the-line machine last week -- eat your heart out. You will be
able to play Mystic and Doom-III, but not the extraordinary and
wonderful things that will appear in the next few months (Doom-IV,
perhaps, with really life-like figures), let alone the really
super-duper games and projects that will follow.
Those of us who have waited to update, who jog along happily with
golden oldies (I mean really oldy -- how about a 286 with 12 MH?), will
feel smug and superior. By postponing the day when we take the plunge
into the latest technology, we have survived several generations of
novelty while the up-to-date brigade has wasted its substance in a vain
attempt to keep up. Of course, we have never played Doom. Some of us
can't even play Tetris or use Windows, and lumber on with dear old Word
Perfect and very little else.
We are the Luddites, crouched on the shore of the Internet, afraid to
dip our toes in. We can exchange messages by e-mail but we have never
joined a forum, let alone browsed through the wild selection allegedly
waiting for us.
So what are we to make of Kevin Mitnick, who was arrested in North
Carolina last week and has been charged with invading scores of
computers across the country and stealing files? He doesn't even need a
computer: he can do it all with a touch-tone telephone.
He was caught when a small network in San Francisco, called Well, told
one of its subscribers that they were using too much space on the net's
computer. It turned out that Mitnick had stolen a mass of files from a
rival computer expert and stored them in the unsuspecting subscriber's
space.
He made a habit of insinuating his way into top-secret computers and
stealing files. Sometimes they noticed, sometimes not. A list of 20,000
credit card numbers, including the cards of many of the top computer
inhabitants of Silicone Valley, turned up on another computer. Mitnick
had stolen them for a joke (he never used them to buy things), needed to
put them somewhere, and borrowed another company's computer.
He also visited Government data bases and computer networks storing
secret information. Then he raided the files of Tsutomu Shimomura, a
Japanese-born specialist in computer security. He thought it really cool
to burgle Mr Shimomura's files, and left a voice-mail message for him,
with a fake English accent, taunting him and daring him to catch him --
and moved the purloined files, which were concerned with preventing such
burglaries, to the Well net.
Mr Shimomura took up the challenge -- though it is not clear that he
would have found his tormentor if Well net had not called him to report
the puzzling appearance of millions of bytes of secret data on its
computer.
Mr Mitnick used to suborn local telephone companies' switchboards, so
that his calls could navigate unnoticed around their computers, insert
himself into some computer network, and use that to reach his real
target. He may have accomplices, one of them possibly in Israel.
The thing about the Internet is that its users, legal and illegal, can
be anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, the ordinary PC user, hovering
timorously on the brink, fearing that the world is getting away from
him, is confronted with two sets of advice.
One insists that the new poor are the old -- meaning anyone over 25
who has not yet learned his way around computers and the Internet.
Mitnick is 31, Shimomura 30. If you haven't got it yet, you never will.
The other, more consoling doctrine, holds that with each advance in
hardware (those new chips) and software, it is easier to join the fun.
There are even books written in English about the Internet, we are told.
The first merits a glum face, the second a smiley face (you have to be
able to read laterally on the Internet). I don't know if there's a
recognised symbol for hopeless confusion. If not, there should be.

I AM covered in confusion. It's those Pretty Polly ads which bus
shelters across the country have been wearing. Have you seen them? In
curly-girlie-wurly-frilly script they trill, ''If you're not wearing
Legworks wait here for the next bus.''
The first time I saw one I literally did a double take; you know, that
Tom'n'Jerry jerked-back-two-feet-by-an-invisible-hook-round-your-neck
kind of thing. Frozen in Shock-Horror! stance in the middle of the
street, glaring at a seemingly banal plastic bus shelter while I
computed the implications of a copyline, I was in danger of becoming a
happening myself.
Just two days later I was bulkbuying all the Andrea Dworkin and Susan
Faludi I had scorned since I had thrown out all my back copies of Spare
Rib, converting to the socially acceptable, terribly fashionable,
benign-sounding cult of the ''post-feminist'' and, oh, ultimate
betrayal, subscribing to the ladsie mag Loaded.
In my student days I was a card-carrying, Women's Aid-volunteering,
witchy-badge-wearing rad fem, albeit a scarlet lipsticked, mini-skirted
one. I picketed men-only, beer-swilling, rugby song nights at Glasgow
University Union, marched until my high heels ground down on anti-Alton
demos and wrote scathing, sniffy articles about film directors who
''relegated women to the subordinate and demeaning positions of mere
symbols of sexual desire''. Dreadful mince, but I meant well.
Then I ''left'' -- my euphemism -- the ''patriarchal, repressive''
environs of university, ran slap, bang, wallop into the ''real world''
and realised that radical feminism, while a neat student pose, was an
awful handicap to a) getting a man, and b) keeping a job.
Shame on me, I became the sort of woman who would playfully take on
the boys in the bar about women's rights but who would also laugh at
their blue jokes. I got into journalism and when we played Scruples my
friends began to guess correctly that I was now the sort of person who
would grit my teeth and grin in the face of dreadful sexist banter --
well, they know the nature of the beast I work in.
But after my ''Legworks'' road to Damascus conversion it's no more
Miss Nice Girl. Meet Ms Sick-to-my-molars. Pretty Polly have thrown down
a gauntlet and I'd like to think I'm woman enough to pick it up and slap
them across the chops with it.
Mind you, I checked I had some ground troops first. Worried that I
might be succumbing to some stress-induced (ah, this job, this job)
paranoia attack, I convened the coven and conducted a
straw-and-spritzers poll. They backed me to the hilt. Our indignation
was boundless.
We remembered that this is a company who have courted controversy in
the past. In the late eighties they slapped up billboards featuring a
traffic-stopping pair of pins popping out of a giant cracked egg, with
the adline ''Legs as soft and smooth as the day you were born''.
Thankfully, some guerrilla fems graffitied the billboards with the
ingenious ''Born Kicking'' slogan, a brilliant brainwave which
transformed the submissive, sexually redolent image of the splayed legs
into an aggressive one. Hurrah!
Now I plan to dig out those witchy badges and put a hex on them.
Brandishing the snaggiest finger nail seen since the SS downed pliers --
the result of a no-win confrontation with a car door -- I'm going to
march into shops and wave it at Pretty Polly stands. Corporate
copywriters might call them run-resistent but we girls know that a
ladder will scarper down to your ankles at the very sight of a ragged
nail. Dare they take me and my mangled index nail on? I better warn you
Polly, it won't be pretty.

Industrial Correspondent Roy Rogers reports that British companies are
coming under increasing pressure to comply with an EU directive to set
up works councils
SLOWLY but surely British industry is grudgingly complying with the
European Works Councils directive requiring major companies to set up
joint consultative machinery.
This is despite the UK ''opt out'' of the EU social chapter of the
Maastricht Treaty and the findings of a new study of multinational
companies in the UK carried out for the Institute of Directors which
brands works councils as ''costly, loaded against employers'', and
likely to undermine existing procedures for consultation with employees.
According to the IoD study, seven out of 10 multinationals did not
want to include their UK operations in the works councils they are
obliged to establish within Europe but were coming under increasing
pressure from UK trades unions to do so.
Three quarters of respondents to the IoD survey felt their strategy
for dealing with the directive was undermined by the fear that an
incoming Labour government would sign up for wholesale imposition of the
Social Protocol of the Maastricht Treaty, thereby forcing compliance
with the directive.
Under the directive, which came into force last September, companies
employing more than 1000 workers and more than 150 in at least two EU
member states must establish works councils to provide information and
consultation on corporate strategy including key issues such as
investment and redundancies.
United Biscuits was first off the mark, setting up its works council
last November, and textile group Coats Viyella is well advanced in
discussions with it unions about following suit. Other household names
such as ICI and Pilkington are not far behind.
The TUC maintains there are now another dozen British-owned companies
where unions have formally proposed the creation of a works council.
These include SmithKline Beecham, Barclays Bank, Glaxo Holdings, Blue
Circle Industries, C &amp; J Clark, Marks and Spencer, Watmoughs, G A Pindar
&amp; Son, Arjo Wiggins Appleton, BICC, National Westminster Bank, and
Reuters.
Trade union-based steering committees have been set up in a further
batch of UK-based companies including Unilever, Reed
International/Elsevier, Cadbury Schweppes, Lawson Mardon, Ferguson
International, Redland, BPD, GEC-Alsthom, and Lucas Industries.
At the same time a growing number of foreign, mainly European-based,
multinationals are creating works councils for all their European
plants. The most recent is Swedish-owned Electrolux, which decided only
last week, while BMW is understood to be moving towards incorporating
its Rover subidiary in a similar exercise.
Within months they should join a list which already includes Elf
Acquitaine, Generale des Eaux, Assurance General de France, BSN,
Continental Can, Renault, Kone, Pechiney, Thomson, Bull, Nestle, Rhone
Poulenc, Continental Rubber Uniroyal, Volvo, Merloni Elettrodomestici,
Volkswagen, Allianze, Lafarge Coppee, Saint-Gobain, and Credit Lyonnais.
The pace of the spread of works councils in the UK looks set to pick
up as more employers begin to realise that unless they comply with the
directive by September of next year by setting up agreed machinery they
will have works councils imposed on them.
The IoD study of 44 directors and senior personnel managers of
multinationals in the UK showed that over 70% were concerned that the
directive would significantly increase costs -- especially travelling
expenses and the provision of experts to assist works councils in their
deliberations.
There were also fears that considerable cost might be incurred where,
in the absence of pan-European management structures in component
companies, tiers of management might have to be established to liaise
with the required works councils. This, many believed, might run into
hundreds of thouands of pounds.
In addition, one-third of respondents said works councils would
discourage investment by multinationals in the EU and that existing
social policies would be likely to keep unemployment high.
IoD director general Tim Melville-Ross said yesterday that the
research demonstrated that IoD concern about the damaging impact that
works councils would have on companies and European competitiveness had
been correct.
Imposing rigid structures on business at a time when it needed maximum
flexibility to maintain competitiveness was economic folly and would do
nothing to stem the rising tide of unemployment in Europe.
''It is clear that the UK opt-out is insufficient to protect business
from obsolete and damaging European legislation,'' he said, adding that
the IoD would be pressing for a review of the works council directive as
a matter of urgency.
TUC general secretary John Monks agrees that the Maastricht opt-out
had made no difference and that British companies, with huge investments
and increasing responsibilities across Europe, were realising that they
must be ready to consult with all their workers.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the General Municipal and
Boilermakers' union, maintains that works councils are here to stay and
are already changing the face of UK industrial relations. The
Government, he says, can ''like it or lump it''.

THE ghost of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn will be delighted. The impending
by-election in Perth and Kinross can only polarise Scottish politics and
give us a first-class scrap. This is because it will be fought between
the two constitutional extremes, an unchanged Union and the end of the
Union. The question that George Robertson ducked on Calton Hill will
face every citizen on the ballot paper, and he or she will have to
answer it.
The great majority will give the straight answer from which the Shadow
Secretary of State shied away. It is often uncomfortable to give a
straight answer, but it can be morally cleansing too, certainly compared
to shabby evasion. This will be good for the voters, and good for
Scotland.
Perthshire, for all the gentility of the county and the douceness of
the towns, has a way of providing us with by-elections where issues
stand out clearly, if somewhat eccentrically.
The Duchess of Atholl ran here against appeasement in the 1930s: she
lost, but she was right. Hugh MacDiarmid pitted himself unforgettably
against Sir Alec Douglas-Home in the 1960s. It is not a constituency
where dull, conformist time-serving pays off. It is not a place where
the centre holds. That makes bad news for the two parties, Labour and
the Liberal Democrats, which over most of the country claim to represent
the mainstream and the consensus.
The prospect for them in Perth and Kinross is of an excruciating
squeeze. Their existing supporters presumably want to turn the Tories
out, and the Nationalist candidate is the only one who can do that for
them. It still may not be as easy as they think.
This is after all traditional Tory territory, and territory where,
unlike in the feckless Home Counties, tradition still counts for
something. Those Conservatives who did not like the Fairbairn style can
now return to the fold in good conscience. In a campaign bound to be
dominated by the constitution, we would do well to recall that the
constituency has never held much with constitution-mongering.
If it had been separately counted in the referendum of 1979, it surely
would have shown a majority voting No, and we may doubt if the
underlying opinion has really changed since. It will be dinned into the
people of Perth and Kinross that this time of all times, is not the one
to cast a light or frivolous vote, the sort of vote that comes from
getting out of the wrong side of bed. On this point both the Tories and
the SNP will, for different reasons, be putting over the same message.
While no doubt it would take a miracle for the Conservatives to hang
on, their support could still hold up quite well.
If they lose, they will at least not be the only losers. The two other
parties claiming to represent the mainstream and the consensus, and
having had every chance to set out their wares before the electorate,
will be lucky to get 10% of the vote between them. Whaur's yer
mainstream noo?
This could therefore be a crisis not only for the Conservatives, but
also for the consensus, the one reached by Labour and the Liberal
Democrats in the Constitutional Convention. And it will come at a moment
when that consensus is already beginning to crack. It is almost a shame,
considering how laboriously the consensus was arrived at, by the efforts
over months on end of diligent and well-meaning people. That did not
stop the consensus turning out amazingly feeble.
The essence of the whole lies in the proposals for financing
devolution. The convention considered, and rejected, a scheme under
which the Scottish people would have taken responsibility for
themselves, as they are rich enough to do. They would have taken
responsibility by raising and spending all their own taxes for domestic
purposes, while making a fair contribution to the joint expenditure of
the United Kingdom. Instead the convention plumped for the dependency
culture, financed by the begging bowl.
Its preferred alternative rests on the largesse from London, leavened
only by a right to vary the rate of income tax which is rapidly coming
to be seen as unusable.
Pallid as the plan is, it looks like being abandoned as soon as it
falls short of its true purpose, to guarantee that the Labour Party can
continue to hold Scotland in the corrupt and degrading thrall of its
patronage and subsidy. Now we hear that, at the first sign of awkward
objection, Labour may be ready to ditch these financing proposals,
presumably without even consulting its partners in the convention. So
much for consensus. But we shall learn more at the party's conference
next month.
Meanwhile, we have an interesting insight into the sort of Britain
that Tony Blair might want to run, or the sort of Scotland that George
Robertson might want to run. Once you abandon all your old principles,
you naturally find it hard to attack yourself with any firmness to new
ones. A drop of a couple of points in the opinion polls, a misjudged
sound-bite, a pointed question is enough to blow you off course. Shabby
evasion becomes a habit of mind.
But moments arrive when the people do have to be confronted with the
consequences of their democratic choice. To set out the consequences to
them, and to persuade them all the same, is the glory, as sometimes it
is the tragedy, of politics.
One of those moments is about to arrive in Perth and Kinross. In
completely different ways, to be sure, both the Conservatives and the
Nationalists will show the courage of their convictions. May the best
man win. As in the process the feeble consensus dissolves, and the muddy
mainstream runs into the sands, we shall be the better for it.

A STRUGGLE between a magician and a technocrat is reaching a climax on
a field of dreams. The outcome will determine in large measure the face
that Glasgow presents to the world as UK city of architecture and design
in 1999.
The man with the wand is Geoffrey Jarvis, a local architect who dreams
of transforming the site of the 1988 garden festival on the banks of the
Clyde into a grandiose version of the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. ''I
want to put magic into the heart of Glasgow,'' he says.
His hi-tech adversary is Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of the
Glasgow Development Agency, who has another vision -- of a modern
business park featuring a national science centre. ''I want to give
Glasgow economic firepower, and bring science to the people,'' he says.
The contest has reached a critical stage, as both have submitted
outline planning proposals to Glasgow District Council, which is
expected to pronounce on the schemes within four-to-eight weeks. Mike
Hays, the council's director of planning, says each of the applications
will be judged on its own merits. He believes that both are capable of
delivering a high quality of architecture, leaving open the possibility
that both will be approved.
But the battle may be already won and lost. For while Mr Jarvis is
still trying to persuade potential investors that his project is viable,
the GDA has recruited developers based in Edinburgh and Manchester to
begin work on the site as soon as the city council gives it the green
light. More decisively, the GDA owns most of the land and Mr Jarvis owns
none of it.
Popular sentiment may be on the side of the Tivoli Gardens concept.
The success of the garden festival created a nostalgia for that summer
when the sun shone and everybody had fun; the site instantly became a
''dear green place'' in the hearts and minds of Glaswegians, who would
probably welcome any attempt to bring the magic back. Economic
realities, however, appear to have swung the balance in favour of the
GDA's business-driven project.
The prevailing independent view is that Mr Jarvis has woven a magic
carpet, but that it will not fly. One analyst commented: ''All credit to
Jarvis, he's floating an imaginative idea with some merit in it. But in
the real world out there you have to have corporate backing, you need to
get the big players on board, and so far he doesn't have them. The
essential point, of course, is that possession is 99% of the law, and
the GDA has the land.''
Mr Jarvis is not downhearted, believing that popular support may yet
turn the tide in his favour. ''This is likely to become a political
issue, and we have to persuade the people of Glasgow that a festival
gardens complex is worth fighting for,'' he says.
Surveying the empty lot around Prince's Dock, he conjures images of
bands playing in landscaped gardens, cable cars gliding above a
fairground, and people strolling along a crescent-shaped avenue of
boutiques and restaurants reminiscent of hill-towns in Tuscany. Where
gulls screech over an expanse of grass, he sees open-air concerts,
cabaret, and circus acts; where the wind whips across the grey waters of
the canting basin, he sees a glass pyramid with exotic fish swimming in
a giant aquarium beneath a tropical rain forest. ''It would,'' he says,
''be a great place for a millennium hogmanay.''
The adjacent Govan dry docks are derelict, but the shells of the
red-brick buildings could be restored. Mr Jarvis envisages a luxury ship
in one of the docks providing entertainment and dining facilities,
linked with a hotel on the quayside. The old Harland and Wolff
plate-rolling mill nearby, which recently staged productions of The Big
Picnic, would become a maritime heritage museum telling the story of
Clyde shipbuilding.
The Clyde festival gardens project would extend over about 90 acres,
twice the size of Denmark's Tivoli Gardens. Capital costs, excluding the
land, are estimated at #31.5m, and projected attendances of 1.5 million
a year would create more than 700 jobs and generate a profit of about
#4.6m.
The GDA disputes these figures, insisting the capital costs would
exceed #60m, and saying the attendance estimations are unrealistic. It
also points out the seasonal problem of dreich Scottish weather.
Copenhagen is appreciably sunnier, warmer, and drier than Glasgow, yet
its Tivoli Gardens are open for fewer than five months a year.
Mr Jarvis maintains his consultants have got their sums right, and
says his festival gardens would be open for nine months a year,
irrespective of the weather, with indoor attractions in concert halls,
leisure centres, and cinemas.
''If the garden festival had never taken place, one might have had
qualms about doing this,'' he says. ''But because it did happen, and it
was such a success, it was as if the market research had been done.
''We have to think of the communal good, rather than the private
developer. Of course we have to operate on a commercial basis, but for
the right objectives. I'd like this to be a piece of townscape in the
good old-fashioned way, not a lot of office buildings trying to be
clever. I want to see fun and fireworks. I want to give Glasgow the
magic it deserves.''
There is an element of David and Goliath in the contest. Mr Jarvis is
operating virtually alone from an office near Kelvingrove Park, while Mr
Gulliver is directing his campaign from the imposing headquarters of the
GDA in the city centre, with all the resources of his organisation
behind him.
Yet even on the brink of victory, Mr Gulliver is not a happy man. ''We
are portrayed as the bad guys, putting business before popular
attractions,'' he says. ''I'm in a no-win situation, and it's awfully
frustrating.''
His scope for manoeuvre is limited by the fact that he heads an
economic development organisation, whose prime concern is to improve
Glasgow's economic performance. His remit from the Scottish Office,
under which the GDA acquired the site in 1992, specifies a
business-driven project.
Having said that, he is as enthusiastic about his agency's proposals
as Mr Jarvis is passionate about his. Glasgow does not have a
high-quality business park in a central location, and it is losing local
investment as a result, he says. He intends the Pacific Quay site to be
the first of four or five such business complexes near motorways and
transport systems, to increase the city's economic firepower.
''At the same time, we don't want to make it a no-go area to the
public. The site offers enormous potential for leisure amenities as well
as a pleasant working environment. What we envisage is a mixed
waterfront development.''
Thus the jewel in the crown of the business park would be a Scottish
National Science Centre with four exhibition galleries, and lecture
rooms where schoolteachers could be instructed in new experiments. It
would incorporate a universarium, taking visitors on tours of the solar
system; an adjacent IMAX theatre would take spectators to the bottom of
the sea and into the heart of volcanos through films projected on to
gigantic screens; and the 100-metres Millennium Tower nearby would
afford a more prosaic panorama of Glasgow.
''A great deal has been done in Scotland to promote sport and the
arts, but there is virtually nothing to encourage participation in
science and technology,'' Mr Gulliver says. ''We are already lagging
behind other countries in this respect. I don't think the science centre
in itself will change that culture, but hopefully people will leave it
saying science is interesting and fun. It will have to have the new
'wow' stuff that people want to see, and a changing programme that will
draw them.''
It is intended that the centre be the hub of a network of eight
smaller science centres throughout the country, to be administered by a
Scottish National Science Foundation.
The third component would be what Mr Gulliver terms the glue that
binds the others together -- a multiplex cinema, restaurants, and
retailing outlets, and a budget hotel. There would also be a small
marina, and an aquarium in a quayside leisure building. ''Overall, we
want to make the site a multi-purpose destination. I think it's heroic
stuff, and if we can pull it off it would be absolutely wonderful for
Glasgow. It's a practical vision for the city, and we have developers
who are ready to deliver it. It's real.''
He does not believe Mr Jarvis's vision is real. ''We've had five sets
of consultants looking at the festival gardens concept, and they all say
it doesn't work. We've also genuinely tried to incorporate aspects of
it, but the developers say it's not viable. I think the people behind
the festival gardens project are being very dishonest and unfair to the
people of Glasgow. They are promising something that is a chimera. It's
not deliverable.''
The GDA envisages an investment of about #80m over five years on a
43-acre site, creating an estimated 2000 jobs. It has applied for
millennium funding for the science centre, and if its plans are approved
work could begin on the site in the second half of this year.
Both projects regard links with the Scottish Exhibition and Conference
Centre on the north side of the river as important, but for different
reasons. The GDA strategy is to span the river with an ''envelope'' for
business development, the Festival Gardens aim is to provide
recreational facilities for SECC visitors.
Opinion is sharply divided over the rival plans. Glasgow's Chamber of
Commerce initially favoured the Tivoli Gardens approach, which it
believed would appeal to Glaswegians who mourned the passing of the
garden festival. After GDA presentations, however, it expressed
qualified support for the agency's efforts to develop the site.
But in its latest position paper in January, it stated: ''It is clear
that many people in the city support the Jarvis proposals for the
festival gardens for the sentimental and emotional reasons mentioned
above, and the chamber is particularly keen to see a major tourist and
visitor facility erected within Glasgow prior to the turn of the
century.'' It concluded with a suggestion that the GDA should consider
whether there was space on the site for Mr Jarvis's ideas.
Mr Gulliver and his colleagues say they have done this, but that their
consultants and potential developers all insist that the gardens
proposals are not viable.
Michael Kelly, the former Lord Provost, disagrees. It was his
administration that brought a smile to the face of Glasgow with its
'Miles Better' slogan, and he considers it time for an amusing image to
be restored to the city.
Pat Lally, the leader of the city council, prefers the GDA concept.
But he says: ''I'm not terribly enthusiastic about either of them. I
don't think the Danish Tivoli Gardens approach would work in Glasgow any
more than Euro-Disney in Paris. People prefer to go and see the real
thing. Also I would prefer to see something that is open all year round,
rather than just a few months.
''The GDA proposals are fine, but it seems to me they are trying to do
too many things that are loosely related. If either get millennium
funding, however, we would have to think seriously about being
supportive.''
Meanwhile Mr Jarvis is making a last-ditch effort to interest
developers. He admits he is ''late in the field'' in this regard, but
says he is making progress. He also intends to apply soon for millennium
funding.
However, time may be running out for the magician. Unless he can
conjure substantial support quickly, his grand vision for the field of
dreams may prove to be an illusion after all.

The typical suburban villa usually has more garden than most families
are able to handle. An ''invisible'' bungalow is an imaginative solution
proposed by Glasgow architect Donald Forrester who outlined his
proposals to Simon Berry.
SOME of us are born with green fingers and dream of long afternoons
tending and pruning lush vegetation, mowing the croquet lawn and
pricking out the seedbed. Others tend to think more along the lines of
gravel chips and the concrete mixer. Donald Forrester, who lives in a
West End villa with half an acre of ground to the rear, takes the midway
position.
He appreciates the benefits a well-tended garden confers on a building
and its occupants, but he does not have the time or inclination for
extensive horticulture. The obvious solution is to divide the ground and
build another house at the far end of the site. Forrester sees two
objections to this: a conventional 2-storey house would be too close and
the planner would howl with dismay at any such proposal in a
conservation area.
''The garden is at the moment a partly wasted asset,'' he explained.
''It is on two levels and the upper one is rarely used. On the other
hand it contains mature trees and high stone walls which help to create
a natural barrier and a feeling of privacy to the rear. This is a
feature that is often overlooked in the design of modern housing estates
and I would be unwilling to sacrifice it by building uncomfortably close
to the original house.''
Forrester, partner in a well-known architectural practice, has
summoned ingenuity to his aid. A ''hidden house'' is his answer,
providing three bedrooms, a large living area and conservatory all on
one level, running the full width of the garden and providing some 230
square metres of living space.
The view from the villa is of a stone wall with a pergola which would
attract climbing plants. On the upper level (visible from the first
floor of the villa) would be a shorter wall, topped by a masonry stack,
and two flat drum-shaped structures protrude from what appears to be a
third level of grass.
The ''drums'' are in fact rooflights for the kitchen and hall areas.
Most other natural lighting comes from the south-facing
conservatory-cum-terrace which has a set of sliding glass panels that
can be closed off in wintertime to retain as much heat as possible from
sunlight. Covering the living space is a 300mm earth layer and a flat
lawn all supported on concrete panels.
''This is a structure which relates well to the surrounding natural
environment,'' Forrester points out. ''On the side facing the villa it
creates a natural-looking termination to the garden, while to the south
it embraces the existing mature trees, which provide an appropriate
seasonal variation of shade, through the terrace and conservatory.''
All this is achievable for under #150,000 (excluding cost of acquiring
the plot). For the same sort of money you could get an impressive modern
three-bedroom house, but it would almost certainly be sitting in the
middle of a plot with unsatisfying front and rear gardens. This is all
wrongheaded according to Forrester who is a great believer in providing
shared public space rather than meaningless front gardens which have to
be kept tidy in case the neighbours complain.
''A hundred years ago most three-bedroom houses were in terraces,
often with a shared garden to the front. This gave a natural progression
from the semi-public to the private. You get the same idea in tenement
back courts and closes; it is what I call meaningful space.
Unfortunately, people have now been lulled into believing the detached
house on its own plot is the only way to achieve privacy.''
About the architect
Donald Forrester was a design tutor at the Mackintosh School of
Architecture and is currently a member of CRM Buildings &amp; Interiors
Committee, devoted to the appropriate restoration of surviving
Mackintosh buildings. He is now a partner with McKay and Forrester who
have a broad base of private clients and have received a number of
recent awards. Examples of their work are the Clydesdale Bank in
Cathedral Street and the conversion of a bonded warehouse at Bowmore
into a swimming pool.

A TEENAGER who acted out a violent fantasy when he abducted two women
at gunpoint before subjecting one to a degrading sex ordeal, was sent to
Carstairs yesterday without limit of time.
The two victims described the attack by 18-year-old Allan Williams as
their worst nightmare come true. Both were convinced that they were
going to be raped and killed
At the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, Williams, of Octavia Court,
Greenock, admitted abducting the women aged 37 and 42 from the car park
at Tesco in Dalrymple Street, Greenock, on August 30 last year.
He also pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting one of his victims,
holding a gun at her head and attempting to rape her.
Mrs Fiona Reith, Advocate-depute, told the court: ''They both made
clear that this was their worst nightmare come true.''
Their ordeal began after they had been for lunch with friends and Mrs
A offered Mrs B a lift home. They became aware of Williams standing at
the driver's door and after Mrs A rolled down the window he asked if
they could tell him the time.
He produced a handgun and informed them he was going to take them
hostage.
He got into the car and said: ''I have already killed a bitch today,''
claiming that he had robbed a bank that morning, killed a girl who had
become hysterical and knee-capped her boss. He warned that he would kill
them if they tried to escape.
Both women were terrified and Williams ordered Mrs A to start the car
and drive off. As she drove through Greenock, he produced a knife,
holding it in one hand and the gun in the other.
He told Mrs A: ''Don't make me nervous. I get trigger happy when I am
nervous.''
She was forced to drive through back roads in Inverclyde, eventually
ending up at a lonely track near the Kilmacolm to Port Glasgow cycle
path. On the way he robbed Mrs B of three wage packets containing #160.
Williams told the women that he was involved in devil worship and was
a member of a cult.
By the time he got Mrs A's handbag out of the boot and asked for her
credit cards, both woman had their hands tied. At this point they
thought his only motive was to get money from a cash machine.
However, Williams then told them that he used prostitutes in Glasgow
at #40 a time and asked Mrs A how much she would charge.
He told her to put on lipstick and blusher and forced her into the
back of the car. He cut her skirt and bra straps with the knife, and
also cut a clump of her hair.
''By this stage, the women were almost hysterical, believing that they
were going to be raped and possibly killed,'' said Mrs Reith. After what
Williams had said about prostitutes, Mrs A was also afraid of the risk
of Aids.
At this point, two young boys passed by and Mrs A jumped from the car
shouting for help. Williams struck her on the back of the head with the
gun, but she ran away wearing only a polo neck jumper.
Mrs B, who was left in the car, had told how Williams just grinned and
left in quite a relaxed fashion. He said something like 'thanks for a
nice day.'
By this time, the whole incident had lasted for almost three hours.
Dr William Black, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the State
Hospital, Carstairs, described the accused as a loner.
He was suffering from a severe personality disorder, a schizophrenic
illness which was at an early stage when he abducted the two women.
His wish would have been to obtain power over someone rather than
sexual gratification. His fantasies about shooting the girl in the bank
and knee-capping her boss showed someone with a lively and violent
fantasy life.
From what the court had been told, it was self-evident that Williams
was dangerous.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, said that, after considering the
psychiatric evidence, he was satisfied that because of the accused's
dangerous, violent and criminal propensities, Williams should be sent to
the state hospital without limit of time.

THE organisation behind more than half of Scotland's annual
international trade missions yesterday launched its largest overseas
programme at a news conference in Glasgow -- amid fears that it will
prove to be its swansong.
Strathclyde Business Development has confirmed that its future is in
doubt because of local government reorganisation.
It also warned that plans to take part in major foreign exhibitions
and drum up business for local companies after March, 1996, will fall --
unless it is guaranteed survival by October at the latest.
More than half SBD's annual #20m budget comes from Strathclyde
Regional Council, which will cease to exist next year.
Yesterday SBD officials announced that more than 30 missions to
Europe, North America and the Far East are planned in the next 12
months.
Officials argued that, after 15 years of helping companies put down
business roots abroad, the SBD must be preserved particularly when it is
creating more and more contacts in key, foreign markets.
However, it was acknowledged some of the larger new unitary
authorities may want to control their own economic development
programmes.
It was also conceded some of the smaller authorities, with little or
no industry in their areas, may be unwilling to finance an organisation
which would offer them a mimimal direct return.
The SBD is relying on its record of returns of #18.50 for every #1
spent in the international arena as an argument for its retention. Its
missions last year brought #14.8m worth of direct orders for Strathclyde
firms, with millions more raised indirectly.
SBD director Mr Garrath Le Sueur, said that he was confident the
87-strong economic arm of Strathclyde Region will continue, albeit under
a different name, after local government reorganisation.
He was optimistic that crucial support will come from Scottish Trade
International in the summer when it publishes a long-term strategy for
economic development.
Mr Le Sueur predicted the STI, which is backed by the Scottish Office
and Scottish Enterprise, will recognise Strathclyde's contribution to
winning international trade and want it to continue.
Councillor Joseph McLean, Strathclyde's economic and industrial
committee chairman, was also confident that new councils will heed
advice that the SBD's positive strategy in export drives must be
retained.
More than 200 Strathclyde companies will take part in the 30 overseas
missions to 18 countries -- including Vietnam and China, and a first to
Sri Lanka.
The SBD, which has helped more than 1000 companies reach new markets,
is also playing host to American, Chinese, French and German inward
missions to Strathclyde later this year.

A GLASGOW university professor has been appointed the Astronomer Royal
for Scotland, it was announced yesterday.
Professor John Brown, the university's Professor of Astrophysics, will
fill the position which has been vacant since 1990.
His particular interest is the sun and solar activity and he has been
researching into the possibility of solar-sailed spacecraft.
''This form of craft may seem as though it's straight from the pages
of an Arthur C. Clarke story, but the way it works is that a huge sail,
unfurled on the craft would capture enough solar beams to power it
through the universe,'' said Professor Brown.

YOUNG gay men demonstrated outside the Scottish Office in Edinburgh
yesterday as they launched a campaign for an amendment to the law to
make the age of consent 16 for homosexual men instead of the present 18.
The 20 demonstrators wanted the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill to be
changed to make the age of consent the same for gay men as it is for
heterosexuals.
In a letter delivered to Scottish Home Affairs and Health Minister
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the protesters recalled that, a year ago
yesterday, Scottish MPs had voted by 53 votes to 17 for an equal age of
consent of 16 for all.
However, this had been narrowly overturned by the votes of MPs from
other parts of the UK.
Mr Tim Hopkins, from Outright Scotland, the Scottish Lesbian, Gay, and
Bisexual Rights Group, said in the letter that young gay men in Scotland
were still branded as criminals for doing something others did legally.
Mr Hopkins said that the police had made it clear they regarded it as
a waste of time and resources to investigate consenting private sex
between men over 16, yet the threat of prosecution and the stigma of
criminality remained.
Mr Hopkins said a belief in fairness and equality was a central part
of Scotland's political identity.
His group called on Lord Fraser and the Government to respect that
political identity and to support the introduction of the amendment.
Lord Fraser said later the issue had been fully debated during the of
the Criminal Justice Act last year and all the options had been
considered.

A MEMBER of one of the world's wealthiest families has joined
environmental agencies in their fight against the proposed superquarry
development at Lingerbay, on Harris.
Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan has written to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
urging him to refuse permission for the quarry.
The prince, who heads the Geneva-based international environmental
agency Bellerive Foundation, claimed the quarry would adversely affect
the population, culture, lifestyle, and environment of the island.
''Such a development would run contrary to the principles and
philosophy behind the international agreements signed by the UK
Government at the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,'' he
wrote.
He claimed that if the development was allowed to go ahead, there
would be a risk of oil pollution from tankers and a detrimental impact
on whales, dolphins, and seabirds.
Prince Sadruddin is the uncle of the current Aga Khan, the spiritual
head of the 12 million members of Ismaili sect of muslims in northern
Pakistan.
The Bellerive Foundation is best known for saving the Alps from
ecological ruin and for fighting various African environmental causes.
The prince has also written to the Scottish Office Reporter, who has
been conducting the public inquiry into the proposed quarry.
Yesterday Dr Kenny Taylor, the northern officer of the Scottish
Wildlife Trust, one of the scheme's chief opponents, welcomed the move.
''It gives our fight an international dimension. He is someone who has
the interests of people at heart as well as the interests of the
environment,'' he said.
At the inquiry yesterday it was claimed that there would be little
threat to marine life from unwanted organisms being introduced to the
waters around Harris, if the discharge of ballast water at the proposed
superquarry was properly controlled.
The effects of ships discharging ballast water has been one of the key
environmental concerns of opponents of the proposed quarry, including
the Government's own environmental watchdog Scottish Natural Heritage.
The issue is examined in a paper on the principal marine environment
issues, prepared by the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department at the request of Miss Gillian Pain, Reporter at the
Lingerbay Public Inquiry.
The inquiry will hear this week SOAFD accepts that the marine
environment could be adversely affected by contaminated ballast water
and therefore recommends that ''a robust ballast water management plan''
be developed.
Particular attention had been focused on the risk of toxic
dinoflagellates being transferred in ballast water. In Australasia their
transfer had been associated with outbreaks of Paralytic Shellfish
Poisoning (PSP), but the species of dinoflagellates concerned had not
previously been recorded there.
The paper says: ''In contrast, a number of species of toxic
dinoflagellates that are associated with PSP are indigenous in northern
European waters, and what is not fully understood are the causes of the
blooms that can result in the closure of shellfish fisheries.
''It cannot be assumed that the transfer of toxic dinoflagellates in
ballast waters discharged in the vicinity of Lingerbay would have any
significant effect on the incidence of PSP in adjacent waters.''

TWO Ayrshire MPs have agreed in principle to a public debate with M77
protesters over the #53.6m Ayr road route.
Mr Phil Gallie, Conservative MP for Ayr, and Labour MP George Foulkes
last night told The Herald that they were prepared to meet objectors to
discuss the project's merits.
However, Mr Gallie insisted that he would not debate the road with any
resident of the M77 protest camp, which he described as illegal, but
would only talk with groups unconnected with the encampment.
The Ayr MP said last night: ''I'm not talking with anti-democratic,
anarchistic louts who are stopping people earning a living and feeding
their families.''
He appealed for interested groups to contact him, and suggested a
venue in Eastwood for the debate.
''This road will go through that area, and I intend to contact Allan
Stewart, the MP for this constituency, to check his opinion,'' said the
Ayr MP.
Mr Stewart resigned his position as a Scottish Office Minister
following a fracas with M77 protesters.
Ms Alice Mosely, spokesperson for transport lobby Glasgow for People,
welcomed Mr Gallie's stance last night, but questioned his initial
choice of venue.
She said: ''Why Eastwood? Why not Darnley, or Corkerhill? They'll be
affected, disastrously, by this road. However I'm sure we can come to
some compromise over the venue and we'd be extremely happy to
participate in any debate.''
A leading M77 protester Mr Colin MacLeod said that he would welcome
any public meeting, and was not unduly concerned at Mr Gallie's refusal
to debate with any resident of the Pollok Estate encampment.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley,
said last night he would be prepared, in principle, to debate the road
with anyone, as long as the participants could agree a venue and time.
Mr Foulkes added he would have no objection to including any of the
protesters involved in the self-styled ''Pollok Free State'', as long as
they had a direct interest in this particular road project and were
local.
The road has already been subject to a public inquiry, which M77
opponents lost.
Meanwhile, Mr Gallie has called on the police to use powers given to
them by the Criminal Justice Act 1994, which would allow them to clear
the Pollok Estate camp of protesters.
He said: ''I've written to both the Lord Advocate and Strathclyde's
chief constable urging them to use these powers.
Strathclyde police Superintendant Louis Munn, said last night the
force understood it could only use the Criminal Justice Act if the owner
of the land had actually complained about the protesters' encampment.
That had not happened, he added.
He had no knowledge of Mr Gallie's letter.
A female M77 protester, charged with assaulting a Wimpey security
guard, was released yesterday morning on the instructions of the
procurator-fiscal.
The 35 year-old Lanarkshire woman had been held overnight.
Two other protesters, held over the weekend in connection with a
separate incident, were similarly released on the fiscal's instructions
on Monday.

UNREST is growing among Scottish signalmen about the deal which
settled their four-month strike.
Union officials are to raise with national RMT leaders a series of
anomalies arising from the agreement reached with management.
Although the pay and restructuring package was approved in October, it
is understood that supervisors in signal boxes at Glasgow Central,
Paisley, Motherwell, Edinburgh Waverley and Yoker have still not agreed
new rosters.
Management is concerned at the failure to introduce the rosters,
according to a Railtrack Scotland document in The Herald's possession.
The document suggests some signal box staff are needlessly receiving
two hours' overtime a day because the failure to agree rosters means
that the status quo remains -- despite implementation of the new pay
package.
The Herald revealed yesterday that signalmen's earnings in Scotland
have risen by 8% instead of the 3.4% estimated by Railtrack's
London-based headquarters on settling the dispute. Railtrack now fears a
#735,000 shortfall in budget calculations for the new pay rates in
1995-96.
Mr Mike Barry, RMT administration officer for Scotland, last night
denied any signalmen have ''got something for nothing'' since accepting
the pay and restructuring package.
He stressed rosters remained a negotiable item at individual signal
boxes under the deal. He claimed management was trying to save money by
interpreting the wording in the national agreement differently to that
of union representatives.

PLANS for a dry store of spent nuclear fuel at the Torness power
station took a major step forward yesterday when Environment Secretary
John Gummer effectively gave approval in principle for the project.
The proposal by Scottish Nuclear, which was the subject of a planning
inquiry, will now be decided by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang. The company
said last night it hoped to receive consent within the next month.
If he clears the application, it will have enormous financial
implications for Scottish Nuclear, which has estimated that it could
save #45m each year by building stores at Torness and its Hunterston
station.
At present, the spent fuel has to be sent south to BNFL's Thorp plant
at Sellafield for storage and eventual reprocessing.
At the end of the inquiry in 1993, the Reporter described the store
proposal as a ''sound engineering solution'', but raised the issue of
whether stores at a number of sites were preferable to a single national
store.
Mr Lang then deferred consideration of the planning application,
pending the outcome of the Department of the Environment's review of
radioactive waste management policy in the UK.
That review is not yet complete, but Mr Gummer said yesterday in a
Commons written answer that a safety appraisal of the single/multi sites
issue had been carried out.
''That appraisal does not point to conclusive benefits deriving from a
central store or stores, compared with one or more stores sited beside
nuclear generating stations.
''The Government has therefore confirmed its preliminary conclusion
that decisions on the siting of dry stores for spent nuclear fuel should
be a matter for the commercial judgment of the operators, subject to the
necessary planning and regulatory requirements being satisfied.''

Paris
FRANCE'S presidential election campaign was flung wide open today by
two opinion polls that showed Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, enmeshed
in a phone-tapping scandal, had lost his once huge lead.
A BVA survey for the first time showed conservative Jacques Chirac
drawing level with Balladur and Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin
winning the first round on April 23.
A Louis Harris poll was only slightly less gloomy for the premier,
showing him just half a point ahead of Jospin in the first round and
still well clear of Chirac. Both surveys showed the premier would win a
run-off vote against Jospin on May 7.
Stock and bond prices ended slightly weaker. ''The market is beginning
to realise that his victory is not necessarily a foregone conclusion,''
one bond analyst said.
Balladur, for months so far ahead of his rivals in popularity that he
had seemed a certain winner, angrily rejected suggestions that the
phone-tapping scandal was comparable to the celebrated Watergate scandal
in the 1970s.
In an interview with Radio France-Inter, he said the case was being
blown out of all proportion to sink his campaign and a far more serious
matter, involving outgoing President Francois Mitterrand, was being
ignored by the media.
''Comparisons with Watergate are unacceptable,'' Balladur said when
asked about comparisons with the bungled bugging of Democratic Party
offices which toppled US President Richard Nixon in 1974.
The BVA survey said Jospin would win the first round open to all
candidates, crediting him with 21 or 22%, a point more than Balladur and
Chirac, the mayor of Paris, running neck and neck.
Louis Harris gave Balladur 23.5%, Jospin 23 and Chirac 17 on the first
round. The polls had both conservatives beating Jospin, but Chirac by
only 54-46% and Balladur by 53-47.
If pitted against each other in the run-off, BVA showed the two
right-wingers level at 50-50.
The polls for French media were conducted amid controversy over
Balladur's approval of a phone-tap aimed at slowing an investigation
into illegal funding of his Rally for the Republic (RPR) party.
The case stems from his approval last year of a police phone-tap on
the father-in-law of a magistrate investigating RPR finances,
particularly in the west Paris suburbs which are Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua's power base.
The case has increasingly discredited the tough-talking Pasqua, whose
hopes of becoming prime minister if Balladur is elected president have
suddenly dimmed. Balladur said he still had confidence in Pasqua.
This month a French court ruled the tap was part of a plot to
discredit the magistrate and hobble his investigation.
A deeply embarrassed Balladur -- who as late as Sunday night was
insisting the tap was legal -- accused the police yesterday of
misleading him into approving the surveillance. The head of France's
criminal investigation department resigned yesterday.
Balladur's office has now ordered a review of the way police use
emergency phone taps -- supposedly meant only for Mafia, terrorist or
other major criminal cases.
''There are 3000 such (wiretap) cases legally allowed each year. Here
is a single example of the law being misused. To make this an affair of
state is of bad faith. Let's not lose reason,'' Balladur said in the
radio interview.
''How can one compare this with Watergate which involved political
espionage in the offices of a political organisation (the US Democratic
party)? We are in the midst of an election campaign and everyone is
ganging up on me,'' he added.
Balladur said the press largely ignored a far more serious case
purportedly involving thousands of illegal files on the private lives of
politicians, journalists and others drawn up by intelligence agents
working for Mitterrand and based on entirely illegal wiretaps.

Moscow, Tuesday
RUSSIAN forces launched large-scale attacks on Chechen fighters today,
ending a lull in the 10-week war which a human rights body said has
killed more than 24,000 civilians.
Experts working for Russian Human Rights Commissioner Sergei Kovalyov
reported that the scale of civilian deaths was comparable only with
Poland during the Second World War.
The Chechens confirmed fresh clashes and said Russian forces had
launched an offensive with tanks, artillery and warplanes in areas south
of the shattered capital Grozny at 5am local time.
Chechen Information Minister Movladi Udugov said fighting died down
after six hours when Russian forces failed to break through Chechen
lines.
However, it appeared aerial attacks, some involving high-altitude
bombing, continued in southern districts of the city as well as in
Argun, just to the east.
Udugov also claimed Chechen fighters shot down a Sukhoi-25 jet fighter
early today, but the Russians denied that. Chechens shot down a
Sukhoi-27 on February 4.
A fresh upsurge of fighting had been widely expected following pledges
by top Russian generals to crush rebel resistance after a four-day
ceasefire expired on Sunday night.
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev has ruled out any more talks with
rebels loyal to breakaway leader Dzhokhar Dudayev.
''The only viable scenario is a total arms surrender by the
militants,'' he said yesterday.
The estimate of civilian deaths by Kovalyov's office was likely to
stir more unease in the West.
It said that in the two months up to January 25, 3700 children below
the age of 15 were killed together with 4650 women over 15 years, 2650
men over the age of 50, and 13,350 unarmed men between the ages of 15
and 50.
It added that 650 armed men had also died -- apparently Chechen
fighters.
The report gave no figure for Russian losses, but Moscow defence
officials have put the number of Russian military dead at more than
1000. More than half those were killed in the battle for Grozny.
The Russians have made it clear they see little chance of talks ending
the conflict which began on December 11 when President Boris Yeltsin
sent troops to end Chechnya's three-year-old claim to independence.
Russian forces drove most rebel forces out of Grozny early this month
after a fierce two-month battle that left huge numbers of buildings
gutted.
The rebels have since regrouped in the strongholds of Gudermes, east
of Grozny, and Shali, to the south, while keeping up hit-and-run raids
inside the capital.
* President Bill Clinton is to visit Moscow to discuss a major new
nuclear arms reduction treaty, President Yeltsin announced today.
He said during a visit to the former Soviet republic of Belarus that
he and Clinton would begin preparations for what he called the Start-3
Treaty, but he gave no other details.
Yeltsin said: ''This year US President Bill Clinton will visit and we
have tentatively agreed to begin preparing the Start-3 Treaty.''
The two superpowers signed the Start-2 Treaty to cut nuclear weapons
in 1991, but the agreement has not been ratified by either the Russian
parliament or the US Congress.
Yeltsin has made several proposals to slash nuclear weapons stocks but
today's remarks appeared to be the first time he had raised the concept
of a new treaty.
Yeltsin did not say when Clinton would go to Moscow, but with the
Chechnya war still raging Clinton is hesitant about even accepting
Yeltsin's invitation to a May meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of
the end of the Second World War.--Reuter.

Washington, Tuesday
THE CIA confirmed today that it had enlisted spies from its covert
operations branch, better known for cloak-and-dagger work abroad, to
help boost the agency's standing with the US Congress.
''This is not a lobbying effort,'' a spokesman said, referring to the
new Central Intelligence Agency mission, disclosed by The New York
Times, that aims at burnishing the agency's image with lawmakers who
hold its purse-strings.
''The intent is to better communicate with members of Congress about
what we do here,'' CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said, alluding to the
operations directorate, which recruits foreign agents, gathers secrets
and carries out covert tasks abroad at presidential request.
He said the work of the operations directorate, which takes on such
tasks as penetrating terrorist cells, ''is generally not well
understood.''
The New York Times today published excerpts of a directive describing
the CIA mission. The memo was from higher-ups to the clandestine branch,
which accounts for perhaps one-third of the agency's estimated 18,000
employees.
In enlisting the help of operatives who normally work under cover
abroad, Mansfield said, the CIA hoped to provide members of Congress
with ''an accurate portrayal of significant on-going activities -- both
positive and negative -- as well as articulate our vision for the
future.''
Most employees work in one of the three other CIA directorates: the
Directorate of Intelligence, which analyses, produces and disseminates
intelligence on foreign policy issues; Science and Technology as well as
administration.
The classified message to operatives stirred criticism on the ground
it might involve spies in inappropriate lobbying of Congress. The
operations directorate was rocked a year ago by the arrest of one of its
own, Aldrich Ames, for spying for Moscow for nine of his 31 years at the
CIA.
The memo, sent last month, asked case officers to list everyone in
Congress with whom they had ''personal ties'' or a ''working
relationship'' as part of the new programme.
Reflecting the covert branch's high opinion of itself as the heart of
the CIA, the directive said that ''the agency's standing with the
Congress is linked inextricably to the Hill's view of the directorate of
operations''.
''A not-to-be-understated factor in our engagement of members is a
personal one,'' the directive added. ''Many of you have established
mutually respectful relationships with congressional members,'' while
''others have school or family ties.''
The CIA confirmed the accuracy of the quotes published by The New York
Times without releasing a copy of the memo. The new CIA mission was
disclosed ahead of Senate confirmation hearings of Michael Carns, a
retired Air Force general and CIA outsider who is President Clinton's
choice to replace James Woolsey.

Cape Town, Tuesday
ZULU chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, saying he had been betrayed by
President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, today led his
party in a walk-out from South Africa's new all-race parliament.
He told jeering ANC members his 21 legislators would boycott
parliament, but not the cabinet, until a special congress of his Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) on March 5 and 6 to decide whether to quit
permanently.
Complaining that an April 1994 accord on international mediation of
constitutional disputes had not been implemented, he said: ''Let us be
blunt: Honour has been betrayed.''
ANC members chanted ''Go, go, go'' as Buthelezi, minister of home
affairs in South Africa's first democratic government and a prince of
the Zulu nation, left to address a news conference.
He told reporters he would meet Mandela and National Party Deputy
President F.W. de Klerk soon to discuss the crisis.
Mandela condemned the walkout and urged the Inkatha members to honour
their constitutional obligation to their voters.
''This (walkout) cannot be justified by whatever differences exist on
the issue of international mediation,'' he said.
After two years of on-off negotiation with the ANC and then-president
de Klerk's NP, Buthelezi joined the campaign for the first democratic
election seven days before voting started.
He agreed to campaign after de Klerk and Mandela had signed an accord
promising to renew a failed attempt at international mediation on
Inkatha's demands for provincial autonomy and constitutional recognition
of the Zulu monarchy.
Mandela's ANC won by a landslide with the National Party and Inkatha
winning enough seats to share power in a five-year transition government
of national unity.
A committee of ANC, NP and Inkatha ministers has failed this year to
agree on terms for implementation of the Zulu party's demand for
implementation.
Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said, however, there
had been no rejection of the Inkatha demand: ''We are committed to
fulfilling the agreement of the 19th of April (1994), which included the
agreement on international mediation.''
ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu called the Inkatha walkout ''a
non-existent crisis'' and said his party was ready to continue talks
about terms for mediation.
Buthelezi told the National Assembly in a speech announcing the
boycott: ''We now seem to be very close to repeating the same mistakes
(of apartheid) and I may not remain silent.
''We are in a situation of total impasse . . . with the breach of the
agreement, our presence here is becoming one of the political
impossibilities which I mentioned at the opening of my remarks today.
''We of the IFP must now seek a new mandate from our constituency and
until such mandate is received, we are duty bound to suspend our active
participation in parliamentary work and in the constitution-making
process,'' he said.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
THE UN was today struggling to push its aid convoys past Serb and
rebel Muslim troops to reach starving people in the encircled Bosnian
enclave of Bihac.
A convoy escorted by UN peacekeepers crossed the Croatia-Bosnia border
at Maljevac after being held up for several hours, a spokesman for the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees said.
Croatian Serbs stopped the convoy about nine miles outside Bihac town
yesterday. It headed south today but still had to pass through the rebel
stronghold of Velika Kladusa, where previous convoys have been blocked,
before entering government-held territory.
UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi met Serbs from the Krajina region of
Croatia in their ''capital'' Knin to plead for freedom for the aid
convoys heading to Bihac and the ending of the ''systematic harassment''
of UN peacekeepers.
Aides suggested Akashi would reserve the right to threaten military
force to push aid into Bihac, although the UN has consistently shied
away from using its muscle in the past.
The Croatian Serbs, their Bosnian Serb allies and a band of rebel
Muslims loyal to a local warlord, have effectively blockaded the Bihac
''safe area'' and cut aid to more than 160,000 people.--Reuter.

Lahore, Tuesday
A SENIOR Pakistan lawyer today urged the High Court in Lahore to
acquit two Christians -- one of them a 14-year-old boy -- facing
execution on a charge of blasphemy against Islam's Prophet Mohammad.
Former law minister S M Zafer, acting as one of several ''friends of
the court'', said strong evidence was lacking in the case against
Salamat Masih and his uncle Rehmat Masih, 40.
''An acquittal would not be a win for the defence nor a defeat for the
prosecution, but a triumph for Islamic jurisprudence,'' he told the
court.
Most other senior lawyers asked by the judges to advise them as
friends of the court have declared that the case against the Christians
is flimsy or non-existent.
The pair, who have both denied the charge, were arrested in May 1993
after a village imam, or prayer leader, in nearby Gujranwala accused
them of throwing pieces of paper bearing blasphemous remarks into his
mosque.
A domestic human rights commission said there appeared to be personal
grievances involved in the case.
A third Christian accused of the offence was shot dead as the
defendants walked out of a Lahore court in April 1994. Rehmat and
Salamat Masih were wounded in the attack.
The imam, Maulvi Fazal-e-Haq, and two others were charged with murder.
Fazal-e-Haq is out on bail.
Ismail Qureshi, who was a prosecution lawyer until main plaintiff
Fazal-e-Haq removed his power of attorney yesterday, saying he no longer
wished to pursue the case, asked the court to hear new evidence against
the accused Christians.
The court's two judges said they were unsure they could grant the
request.
The two-judge bench in Lahore is due to resume tomorrow hearing an
appeal by the pair against a lower court ruling sentencing them to
death.
Outside the court, about 100 Islamic militants chanted: ''Shame on
American stooges'' and ''Hang the blasphemers''.
Qari Muhammad Salim, an organiser of a militant group in the town of
Gujranwala where the alleged offence occurred, told the crowd that the
two Christians would be killed regardless of the court's verdict.
''Even if the court frees them, the self-respecting citizens of
Pakistan will not let them live,'' he declared.
The case has aroused international concern, especially in view of the
age of Masih, only 12 at the time of the incident.
Last night, 75 British lawyers appealed to Pakistan President Farooq
Leghari to lift the death sentences.
The case has sparked fierce emotion in Islamic Pakistan.--Reuter.

A GROUND engineer was taxi-ing a small plane between hangars at an
airport yesterday when a sudden gale lifted it up, flipped it over, and
dropped it crashing to the ground.
Mr Jim Donald, 30, had to be pulled from the wreck of the four-seater
Cessna which had been caught by a 50mph gust of wind.
He suffered back and neck injuries, but was back at work just two
hours after the bizarre accident at Dalcross Airport, Inverness.
An air ambulance had to be scrambled all of 150 yards to pick up Mr
Donald, of Alness in Easter Ross and fly him to Raigmore Hospital in
Inverness.
Mr Donald has no pilot's licence and is allowed to drive the plane
only on the ground.
The plane was an American-built Cessna 172 with an 11 metre wing span
and weighing more than 1.3 tonnes. It is operated by Air Alba as a
trainer aircraft.
Damage to the plane was still being assessed yesterday, but is likely
to run into thousands of pounds.
A spokesman for Highlands and Islands Airports, which operates
Dalcross Airport, said yesterday: 'Mr Donald was badly-shaken naturally,
but he luckily escaped serious injury and was back at work by 3pm.''
He added: ''It was just a freak accident, an incredibly rare
incident.''
Flight-control staff witnessed the accident from an airport tower and
stand-by fire crew were at the scene within seconds.

<RECORDNO>979730648</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WOMAN was accused yesterday of trying to ''destroy'' Red Dwarf star
Craig Charles with false gang rape and sex ''torture'' allegations
because she was jealous of his girlfriend.
During a series of courtroom clashes, the comedy actor's counsel, Mr
Stephen Solley, QC, suggested the woman's allegations that she suffered
a humiliating orgy for hours were nothing more than a ''travesty of the
truth''.
He said she had even invented a third man attacking her and got so
carried away with her feelings that she described him as looking like
Cabinet Minister Michael Portillo.
The 38-year-old woman, frequently sobbing, repeatedly insisted she had
not told a lie during two days in the witness box at Southwark Crown
Court.
She denied ''flaunting'' herself in a provocative outfit in front of
the actor, trying to pull his trousers off, and willingly committing sex
acts.
The woman, who used to be a dancer in Soho, also rejected a suggestion
she had said to Mr Charles about his girlfriend: ''This white woman has
really got her hooks into you. You should not let her ruin your life.''
She told the jury it was wrong for the barrister to paint her as a
woman who had invented the allegations because she felt ''gutted'' after
''brewing and stewing'' over news of 30-year-old Mr Charles's planned
marriage.
She also denied her frequent sobbing while giving evidence was nothing
more than ''crocodile tears''.
At one stage during cross-examination, the woman, a single mother who
cannot be named for legal reasons, became embroiled in a verbal
confrontation with Mr Charles as he sat in the dock.
She had insisted that she had lived with the actor on and off for
about two years.
Accused of lying, she raised her voice and replied: ''I did. I did
live with that man.''
Mr Charles immediately sprang to his feet and shouted: ''No you did
not!''
Turning to him, she stabbed her finger in his direction and said: ''I
did. I cooked for you. I washed your clothes. I tidied up for you. I fed
you.''
At another point, she accused him of being ''evil''.
Mr Charles, of Tyers Street, Kennington, and company director John
Peploe, 36, of Keswick House, Crawford Road, Camberwell, both south
London, deny a joint charge of rape and four joint counts of indecent
assault last July 8.
The woman, an acquaintance of Mr Charles, claimed her ordeal took
place after the actor and two friends came to her flat in Clapham, south
London, between 5am and 6am.
Within minutes, Mr Charles -- curry-loving David Lister, the last
human in the universe, in the BBC2 science fiction cult comedy series --
had encouraged Mr Peploe to rape her.
She said she was forced to have oral sex with both men. She also
alleged a number of indecent assaults.
The trial continues.

A SUBSTANTIAL reward was last night offered for the return of a
valuable work of art which has been stolen from an Edinburgh gallery.
The work, by the celebrated German artist Joeseph Beuys, is valued at
around #12,000, and went missing from the Richard Demarco European Arts
Foundation gallery in the city's York Lane during the last week.
The piece is a small blackboard, 31 by 44cm, with the screen-printed
inscription Kunst Kapital, meaning Art Capital.
Copies of it were made, but the original work was presented by the
artist to Mr Demarco as a token of his friendship.
It was regularly exhibited in memory of the artist who died in 1986.
His work was shaped by his experiences of Scotland.
Lothian and Borders police yesterday confirmed that inquiries were
taking place into the robbery.

ON some of last summer's balmier evenings, Caroline Mair set up a
barbecue outside her flat. Nothing so unusual in that, perhaps, except
she was tucking into her steak just yards from Glasgow's Italian Centre
and the bustle of Ingram Street.
Once inside the robust security doors of Albion Court, there are
pleasant gardens surrounded by the red brick walls of the Merchant City.
Ingram Street could easily be on another planet.
Caroline first bought her ground floor studio apartment four years
ago. The acquisition of this very private bolt-hole eased her painlessly
into the pleasures of home ownership for the first time. It has been an
entirely sensible choice of starter home that she will now leave behind
with some regret.
It has one main room, as the name suggests, making it both cosy and
practical for a youngster cutting the umbilical cord between a family
home and independent living.
However the room is spacious, unlike some studio apartments that
should really be called cupboards. With two windows at one end, with a
natural wood surround, there is plenty of light.
The soft green striped paper from Laura Ashley gives the room a
restful atmosphere.
Caroline has furnished it with a pine table and bookcase, while a
Persian-pattern rug sits on top of the pale grey fitted carpet. The
carpet and toning curtains will be staying when she leaves.
Caroline found the choice of sofa bed a bit limited when she first
moved in and was furnishing her home. She now reckons a futon bed would
be an ideal choice for easy conversion at night.
At one end of the sitting room a door leads to a separate kitchen
where there are white fitted cupboards trimmed in a dusky pink. The
white hob and built-in oven are included, and there is also a washing
machine and drier. From the window there is a view over the gardens.
The cupboard space in the apartment is more than generous for one
person. Across the entrance hall a double hanging wardrobe has glass
sliding doors giving the illusion of space. Behind them there is plenty
of room for anything one person might need.
There is also a single cupboard for more general clutter, such as the
vacuum cleaner.
In the bathroom, an extra large walk-in heated laundry cupboard has
ample shelf space for airing and storing linen.
A high-powered electric shower has been fitted over the bath with a
glass screen. Like the rest of the flat, the bathroom has been
re-decorated with pale grey patterned tiles against a peach-coloured
suite.
The heating is also geared to anyone starting out on a budget, with a
white metered radiator in the sitting room.
For Caroline one of the major attractions of Albion Gate is the
feeling of security she has enjoyed. High security gates separate the
entrance to the flat and the central courtyard from the road beyond,
while a further security door leads into her block.
She has also been able to rent, quite reasonably, a parking space
directly outside her kitchen window and it will be available to the next
owner. In an area where spaces change hands for prices that would buy
the cars parked on them, this has been no small consideration.
However, for those who prefer to use a more environmentally acceptable
form of transport to get around the city, each flat at Albion Gate has
its own outer storage shed where a bike could be kept.
As this is the only studio apartment in the block, Caroline's
comfortable home is a real one-off.
From it she has been able to walk to her office while window shopping
at some of Glasgow's smartest establishments.
In her spare time, she has taken a leisurely cup of coffee in the
nearby restaurants and wine bars. Living on the same street as the Cafe
Gandolfi would certainly be a selling point for many of its devotees.
Now Caroline is spreading her wings for the West End, but she is
certain to look back on her first home in the Merchant City with real
affection.
For more information, telephone Roy Slater, 041-552-1122. Offers over
#35,500.

THE crew of Rescue 177 told yesterday of the moment they saw Andrew
Wilson, staggering only a few hundred yards from the road through
Glenshee.
Their Royal Navy Sea King aircraft had been scrambled from HMS Gannet
in Prestwick at 7.30am yesterday to assist with the continuing search
and rescue operation in the hills around Glenshee.
Lt David Tribe had brought the helicopter into the search area and,
after discussions with rescue co-ordinators, he and his crew -- co-pilot
Lt Neil Goodenough, navigator Lt Colin Miller, winchman Leading
Aircrewman Gerry Flannery and Leading Medical Assistant Karen Sharp --
had begun ferrying personnel into the mountains.
The pilot said: ''When we arrived, the weather was quite benign but
fairly quickly the wind began to pick up and the cloud thickened. By the
middle of the operation, visibility was as low as 1000 metres and the
wind was gusting up to 45mph.
''Conditions were quite difficult to fly in because of the white
background and drifting snow.''
On the way back to collect more rescuers, the crew saw a man on his
own on the mountain. Lt Tribe said: ''He was waving his arms above his
head and seemed to be distressed. We decided that the winchman should go
down and take a closer look.''
LAC Flannery said: ''I was lowered down. By this time the wind had got
up and the snow was drifting quite badly. I unhooked myself and went
over to the man.
''When I got to him, he was staggering and eventually fell into the
snow. The snow was waist deep in places and was very difficult to walk
in. I cannot be sure, but I feel he may have had enormous difficulty in
getting much further. We are all glad we spotted him when we did. I knew
by the look of him he was in a bad way.
''I managed to get his name and confirmed he was the man we were
looking for.'' Although Mr Wilson was jusy a few hundred yards from
safety, his condition was deteriorating rapidly. He was flown to a
casualty centre, where LMA Sharp joined a doctor and other medical staff
in his primary care.
She said: ''He was very cold and thirsty, and did not seem to have
eaten or drunk much since he went missing. We got his clothes off and
wrapped him in an electric blanket to slowly warm him up.
''In the meantime he was given sips of tea and slowly began to
improve. He was not able to tell us much, but he did indicate that he
had spent most of the time in a bivvy (bivouac) bag and that he had been
building his strength to try and make it down the hill. He was clearly
an experienced mountain man and was well equipped, but he was in a bad
way when he was found.''
Mr Wilson told his rescuers that he had made a cross on the hillside
with his skis -- an internationally-recognised distress sign -- but that
he expected the drifting snow had probably covered them over.

IMAGINE having your own walk-in West End hideaway, one of those
gorgeous Glasgow buildings that just reek of Victorian splendour.
There's one on the market just now, at Cleveden Crescent, the entire
ground floor of a two-storey stone-built property. Yours for #1000 a
month.
What do you get? Well it comes with three double bedrooms, a drawing
room, dining hall, utility room, kitchen, breakfast bar, toilet,
bathroom with separate shower. That doesn't begin to describe the feel
of the place, however.
Lots of original woodwork and cornices. Tiled floors. Views over the
city, to the south. Double garage, that really should have a hansom cab
or a brougham at least inside.
It's a part of old-time Glasgow, in an up-to-date setting. All the
fittings are there, phone and TV included. The mantelpiece is carved
wood. The central heating is gas-fired.
As the locally-based letting agents, Nouveau Property Bureau, point
out: ''This is the sort of place that attracts the professions --
medical people, academics and architects.
''We specialise in the West End and there is always a steady demand
for good quality property. The interest is not only from the city
itself. It takes in people in the south, and overseas.''
Other properties in the neighbourhood available at Nouveau include a
modern luxury flat in Redlands Road with a two-bedroom setting, complete
with en suite bathroom and five-piece suite. The rental here is #650 a
month.
There is a separate shower room, a lounge with open outlook, fully
fitted dining kitchen, and gas central heating.
Security entry is getting to be a conventional aspect nowadays, but
garaging under the building is more out of the ordinary. This flat has
both.
Nouveau can also offer an interesting choice of modern or traditional
properties at #480 a month.
Modern is a two-bedroom first-floor flat in Kelvindale Gardens.
Central heating is by gas. There is a shower as well as a bathroom. And
the property is fully equipped and furnished.
Is it better than, or just different from, a second-floor conversion
in Victoria Crescent, fine and handy for the amenities of Byres Road?
This more traditional property has electric heating, and again is fully
equipped and furnished.
Or what about a single-bedroom flat on the second floor, over at
Minerva Court? That makes it pretty convenient for Charing Cross and
that side of Sauchiehall Street.
As always, fully fitted and furnished. Bathroom comes with shower.
There is central heating and garage parking. Certainly that bit smaller
than other properties on the letting schedule, but then it's available
for #410 a month, that bit less than the others.
''We do a fairly wide range of properties,'' say Jo and Phil, the
ladies at Nouveau. ''We specialise in the West End and, with the
university at hand, the students are an important source of interest.
There is a lot of movement in the medical and academic fields.
''The West End is not just one kind of property or one size. It is an
area you have to get to know.''

AFTER two nights entombed in a snow-hole which saved his life,
cross-country skier Andrew Wilson yesterday walked out of the mountains
at Glenshee after surviving three nights of blizzards.
During that time rescue parties had literally been walking above his
head but in the conditions he was unable to hear them and they were
unable to spot him.
The 44-year-old Glaswegian had decided the only way to escape death
was to take advantage of a break in the weather which happened on Monday
night as darkness fell. He emerged from the snow-hole, and tried to
reach help.
Had he not done so he would almost certainly have perished as weather
conditions on the plateau were so bad yesterday that for the first time
since he went missing rescuers were unable to reach it.
Mr Wilson was eventually spotted staggering along near the edge of the
A93 by a helicopter crew who were ferrying mountain rescue team members
to start the search for him.
No-one is thought to have survived longer in the ferocious weather of
Scotland's mountains and his first thoughts were for a drink of Irn-Bru
and to get a message to his wife.
''He must have been very close to the edge,'' said one of the
exhausted rescuers.
Mr Wilson, of Crofton Avenue, Croftfoot, had disappeared on Saturday
afternoon after separating from a companion who had decided the
conditions were too difficult and had returned to their car.
It emerged yesterday that in the mid-afternoon Mr Wilson became
disoriented and a skiing party he had been tracking lost sight of him in
the blizzard. When he was unable to relocate the party he dug himself a
snow-hole on a 3000ft plateau, climbed into his survival bag, and sat
tight until an opportunity to escape arose.
When found he was suffering from hypothermia and was disoriented but
was able to talk. Grampian Police Sergeant Graham Gibb, who co-ordinated
the search which at one stage involved almost 100 men, five dogs, and a
helicopter, had decided to put the teams out for one more day because
they believed there was still a chance that Mr Wilson was alive.
''I think the fact that we went out for the fourth day on the trot
speaks for itself,'' he said. ''The team members were all totally
exhausted. If I had felt there was a real possibility he wasn't alive I
would have been saying to the men 'Let's give it a break and come back
tomorrow' to give them some time to recover, but there was always that
chance he had snow-holed and he would be alive.''
Describing Mr Wilson's situation, Mr Gibb said: ''He would have been
in the snow-hole looking out and seeing complete white-out, absolute
blizzard conditions, with the wind gusting to 80 miles per hour, easily,
and he would have thought to himself 'If I go out there I am going to
die', so he stayed and quite rightly so.
''As it turns out quite a number of team members would actually more
or less have been standing on top of him during the search but wouldn't
have seen him because of the severe blizzards and white-out conditions.
''There was a break in the weather yesterday just as we were taking
team members off the hill and at that time he decided it was time to
make a move and climbed back over the hill he had skied over three days
earlier.
''As he lost height the ground would have naturally taken him back to
the A93 road so it is unclear exactly what he did last night but by the
condition he was in it is quite conceivable it took him all night to
wander his way down through the deep snow.
''Team members were speaking about the snow being waist deep so it
would have been a struggle down.
''This morning the Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet was airlifting
team members into the hill to commence the search. They were preparing
the fourth or fifth run to pick up the last lot of team members and on
his way back up, following the A93 because conditions were such he
needed something to guide him, and heading back towards the ski centre,
the crew saw someone staggering down the side of the hill in the search
area.
''They thought it rather strange that someone should be coming off the
hill at that time of day and decided to go and look, took him on board,
and it was at that point we decided we had our missing skier Mr Wilson.
''He was airlifted up to the ski centre where he was examined by the
chairlift medics. At this stage he was so weak he could no longer stand
and they decided the best thing to do was airlift him to Ninewells
Hospital in Dundee for treatment.''
Flight Sergeant Bill Baston, leader of the RAF Leuchars Mountain
Rescue Team, was one of the first to speak to him and he said: ''We were
just very happy. It was a reward for all the effort we had put in. He
must have been very close to the edge.
''I asked him his name to confirm who he was because initially we
really couldn't believe we had found him. I was very pleased when he did
confirm his name was Andrew Wilson and the first thing he asked for was
a drink.'' In spite of his dehydration, they were unable to give him any
cold drinks but he was given a few sips of hot tea.
Mr Gibb said it was hard to criticise Mr Wilson's decision to ski on
when his colleague decided to return, but said: ''In a situation like
that the only way people should make a decision like that is if their
navigational ability is such that they know they could cope in these
sort of conditions, and really you have to be absolutely first class
with your navigation to do that and secondly you have to have the
physical strength and physical stamina to carry on in that sort of
conditions.
''I would suspect his navigational skills were not up to scratch and
that is the reason he had to snow-hole.''

THE shape came first, dark and angular against the sleet-filled sky,
followed by the ear-splitting, teeth-grinding roar.
Then Britain's first female, battle-ready pilot in her Tornado twice
ripped past the massed ranks of the world's media huddled on a storm-
lashed runway at RAF Lossiemouth.
Flight Lieutenant Jo Salter would clearly rather not have spent
yesterday being treated differently from her male colleagues at the 617
Dambusters Squadron, but as the only battle-ready female flyer she is
good public relations for the RAF.
MoD officials admitted Flt Lt Salter, 26, was dreading the press-call
but she gamely took her Tornado to an airborne rendezvous with
photographers over the north of England and then headed back to
Lossiemouth where she buzzed the press pack before landing and posing
for more pictures.
On the ground, her fellow pilots and navigators acted as escorts and
information officers for the 100-odd journalists.
''I didn't know it would be this much trouble having her in the
squadron,'' one joked as he squired another soaking camera crew to a
prime position near the runway. ''She's got a lot to answer for.''
Born in Bournemouth, Flt Lt Salter took an honours degree in
electronics systems engineering at the Royal Military College of Science
in Shrivenham before starting officer training. She won her wings in
April 1992 and has been training for the combat role ever since.
The RAF opened the door to female pilots six years ago and in 1991
extended the welcome to fast-jet combat roles. At the moment, there are
28 female pilots undergoing flying training -- eight of them already
placed with squadrons.
At the press conference, Flt Lt Salter insisted her presence in the
force was ''no big deal''.
The media was not convinced. Did she have a boyfriend? Fast car?
Nickname? ''No'' to all three. Had she given her aircraft a name? ''No,
it's called a Tornado.'' Did she think women were aggressive enough to
go to war? A slight pause, a resigned smile and an emphatic
''absolutely''.
Did she ever get any comments about women drivers? ''Not from me,''
said her navigator, Flt Lt PJ Wallace. ''I get a lot from civvies,''
said Flt Lt Salter, meeting the questioner's gaze head-on.
She faltered only once, when asked what Wing Commander Guy Gibson, the
Dambusters' legendary leader, would have thought of her appointment. ''I
have absolutely no idea,'' she said, before a whispered aside from her
navigator. ''PJ says he would have been very proud.''

BRITAIN has spent up to #100m over the past five years on a stealth
warfare programme designed to give the RAF radar-invisible attack
aircraft for the next century.
Defence and industry sources confirmed yesterday that British
Aerospace and the Ministry of Defence have been investing jointly since
1990 in a top secret complex at the aviation corporation's test airfield
at Warton in Lancashire.
The site, still partially under construction, is said to include a
secure ''black hangar'' in which prototype bombers can be built and
laboratories for developing new weapons and sensor-resistant materials.
It is thought to be the most advanced radar testing facility outside
the United States. The only known equivalents are operated at Lockheed's
so-called ''Skunk Works'' in Burbank, California, and the McDonnell
Douglas ''Phantom Works'' in Michigan. Their research produced the F-17
stealth bombers which spearheaded the air assault on Iraq in 1991.
It is believed that BAe provided the initial investment at Warton, and
is now trying to convince the MoD to pump in extra cash for a
demonstrator aircraft.
A basic aircraft could be flying in as little as five years, providing
the test bed for radar-deflecting stealth coatings on wing and body
surfaces, new radar-resistant materials, ''smart'' weapons and sensors.
BAe's determination to remain on the cutting edge of aircraft
survivability has already earned it several research contracts on the US
Joint Advanced Strike Technology programme, put out to tender under the
Pentagon's value-for-money policy.
Its past involvement with the British-designed Harrier jump-jet has
also guaranteed a role in a programme to produce an advanced
short-take-off, vertical landing strike aircraft for the US and Royal
navies.
The company insists that stealth, the science of rendering a
supersonic bomber virtually invisible to hostile radar by employing
revolutionary building materials in its construction or painting it with
a non-reflective coating, is the way forward for both the RN and the
RAF.
Since the delay between drawing board and squadron service for
military aircraft can be as long as 15 years, research has to be carried
out and tested well in advance.
According to sources, much of the work now being done at Warton is
aimed at meeting the requirements for the replacement of Tornado as the
RAF's front-line strike bomber, known as the Future Offensive Aircraft,
in two decades.

CONTINUED improvements in provision for pupils with special needs were
welcomed yesterday by the Scottish Education Minister, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton.
Figures in a Government statistical bulletin show that at last
September 10,000 pupils were in special schools and departments,
representing just over one per cent of the country's school population.
Lord James said a striking example of the progress made was that the
bulletin had shown a dramatic improvement in the achievements of pupils.
The number of Scotvec national certificate modules taken by pupils in
special schools had doubled in the last two years.
Lord James also said that the expansion of provision for pupils was
being matched by improvements in the quality of teaching.

A WOMAN has returned home after winning a four-month battle against
the fleshing eating disease necrotising fasciitis.
Mrs Linda Smith, of Bonnybridge, Stirlingshire, was hit by the disease
on October 19, days after giving birth to a daughter, Katie, by
Caesarean section at Falkirk Royal Infirmary.
After a doctor in the hospital's maternity wing had diagnosed
necrotising fasciitis, surgeon Douglas Harper cut out the infected
tissue in parts of Mrs Smith's leg and stomach. Her new-born baby was
taken away from her as a precaution.
For several weeks, the life of Mrs Smith, who has three other
daughters, Carly, seven, Rebecca, five, and Jodie, three, was at risk.
Her husband, Cliff, 33, said: ''I thought my Linda would never live.
Twice I was told by doctors that she wouldn't see the night out.''
But as her condition improved, doctors at the Falkirk Royal Infirmary
began skin grafts on Mrs Smith's wounds.
Mr Smith said yesterday: ''Linda still has to go back to hospital
later this year for a series of plastic surgery operations at
Canniesburn, in Glasgow. But she is coming on fine.''
Mr Ian Mullen, chairman of Falkirk Royal Infirmary NHS Trust, last
night paid tribute to Mrs Smith and added: ''She fought bravely against
a terrible illness. We all wish her well in her recovery.''
* Last month, Miss Elizabeth Sutherland, 71, was admitted to the same
hospital with the same disease. Surgeons cut away infected flesh from
the neck of the sister of former Beirut hostage Tom Sutherland.
However, the condition of Miss Sutherland, from Bothkennar, near
Grangemouth, deteriorated and she was transferred to the Royal
Infirmary, Glasgow, where she died a day before her 72nd birthday.
Doctors at the Falkirk Royal Infirmary emphasised the two cases were
totally unrelated.

Galashiels (Sheiling on the Gala) is a bustling Borders town on the
banks of the Gala Water, six miles north of Selkirk. Involved in milling
since 1622, Galashiels saw the first Scottish carding machine built in
1790 and is famous for its tweed and wool hosiery.The Scottish College
of Textiles (1909) is the breeding ground for many aspiring designers.
The town attracts people because of the slower pace of life. It is a
close-knit community, and residents have time to talk and are
neighbourly. It is also a safe place with a low crime rate. If you were
thinking of starting a small business in the area then there is a lot of
support offered by the council.
Galashiels is bidding to attract tourists and capitalise on its
history with Old Gala House, Galashiels Museum and the Borders Wool
Centre. In June there are Common Riding celebrations and the famous Braw
Lads Gathering.
The town crest consists of a fox reaching for some plums, with the
motto 'Sour Plums'. It commemorates an incident in 1337 when men of
Galashiels disposed of a band of English soldiers looking for wild plums
in the woods
The long grey town runs along either side of Gala Water, an
unpretentious place, less picturesque than Melrose, Kelso and Peebles.
Galashiels appearance has much to do with its industrial base and
nowadays this has diversified into electronics and printing, exemplified
by Exacta and MacQueens.
Susan Eddington, an associate at Thorburn &amp; Lyon, says: 'Galashiels is
more like Hawick than Melrose, the second Borders town in terms of
population, and industrial rather than relying on pastoral activities.'
Lynne Knox, valuer at John Sale, says: 'Compared to cities like
Edinburgh, Glasgow or Newcastle, the good areas of Galashiels, such as
Abbotsford Road, may not be as good, but then the bad areas are not as
bad. A lot of people retire to Gala, and the town has a retirement
village developed by Crestacare.
'And if you are sick of the rat race, it is within reach of Edinburgh,
Berwick and Newcastle just on the edge in terms of the commuting
distance people are prepared to travel. The A7 runs through Gala to
Carlisle and Edinburgh.'
The town is fairly self-sufficient with good shopping and larger
stores, many catering for the fashion students.
There are six primary schools which are reasonably sound, and Earlston
High School and Galashiels Academy for secondary education.
Other amenities include a swimming pool, leisure centre, refurbished
multiplex cinema (underway), 18-hole golf at Ladhope, the local
municipal course, or about five miles outside Gala at Torwoodlea. Gala,
of course, boasts one of the great Borders rugby clubs and alongside it,
Gala Fairydean FC.
Watching and participating in sports like golf and rugby is
considerably cheaper than in the city.
The council tax and the cost of housing are also generally lower.
There are plenty of properties available from ex-local authority to mill
owners' mansions. Semi and detached bungalows on the Ladhope estate sell
for A55,000 to A60,000. Most sought-after are cottages with an acre
paddock on the outskirts of town. These, says Lynne Knox of John Sale,
they could sell over and over again.
William Windram at Pike &amp; Chapman says: 'We have half a dozen small
flats at under A25,000. These make owning a starter home relatively
easy. You can also get a Thirties semi-detached home with four bedrooms
and two public rooms for a very reasonable A68,000.
'For new-build development, sites tend to be small, attracting
executive type of property. Local builders like John Templeton and
Crawford have land banks and will build the house of your dreams on
plots costing A25,000 to A30,000. These family firms have an excellent
reputation
'Three-bedroom flats are in demandNo.No. to let to the fashion
students, and there is the possibility of new-build for student lets in
the future.'
Apart from activities associated with the college, the town lacks
amenities for young people. Career opportunities are also rather thin on
the ground, and there are many low-paid jobs.
Joyce Tokely, sales negotiator at GA, says: 'Properties are very cheap
in Gala with one-bedroom flats at A18,000 and a five-bedroom detached
house at A120,000.'
'It may not be the prettiest town, but you get a better house for your
money, and a slower pace of life We have been very busy since the start
of the year.'
A town, then, with no airs and graces offering simple good value for
money.

A FATHER told yesterday how he found his 12-year-old son hanging by
his pyjama cord after he had been told off for smoking.
Mark Dobson was discovered in his bedroom by his father, Glen, when he
returned home from work.
His German wife Vreni said that Mark had misbehaved and was in his
bedroom.
''He had been fighting with his sister, Mandy, and had been caught
smoking,'' Mr Dobson said.
''Vreni had sent him to his room. He had been up there for hours, as
quiet as a mouse, by the time I got home.''
Mr Dobson went upstairs at the family home in Worsley Mesnes, Wigan,
Greater Manchester, to show Mark a magazine about satellite TV. ''When I
opened the door, the room was in darkness except for the light from the
TV.
''I saw him hanging from the top of the bunk beds he shares with my
four-year-old son Dean.
''At first I thought it was some sort of sick prank. But then I saw
his face.
''I ran over and lifted him up by his legs and lay him down on the
floor. I screamed down to Vreni to call an ambulance and gave him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
''I was like a crazy man. I was desperately trying to blow the life
back into Mark.
''But he had gone cold. In my heart I knew my beautiful son was
dead.''
Chief Inspector Peter Fletcher of Wigan police said: ''This is tragic.
Our hearts and prayers go out to Mark's parents.''
There were no suspicious circumstances.

FIRST the salon trussed her. Then advertising seduced her, until Rock
came along, releasing her to leather bondage and a skirt no deeper than
the frilly apron on a farcical ingenue. But what goes up must come down,
so in the eighties, fashion worked the hemline like a pulley, the mini
and the maxi alternating but never settling anywhere for long.
And then something strange happened. The market looked on women, rigid
to the backbone in their business suits, took unaccustomed pity, and
ushered in the ease of lazy dressing: that floppy tunic, the billowing
shirt, a baggy jumper, each garment large enough to disguise all
trespassing wads of flesh.
But there comes a moment in the life of the untoned body when not even
a tracksuit offers reliable disguise. Suddenly, that glance at a
full-length mirror reveals betrayal by the very outfit so trusted for
ultimate camouflage. There it is, that last-ditch friend surrendering
the whole torso to drastic slippage which, with luck, stops somewhere
about the knees.
What's to be done? There are two escape routes from the physical
deficiencies we strive to deny. Either we accept that tracksuits be worn
only in the privacy of the home, or we shape up, remembering the yogi's
maxim that you're never too old to stretch. But suiting the sporting
life is not what it used to be. The fact is the sporting life itself has
changed. Decades ago a jovial game of Ping-Pong was as close as most
people came to exercise. Now everyone is either a step zombie or the
bearer of dumb bells, flexing muscles large as lemons beneath Spandex
shimmer and sweat.
And today the sports outfitter is as pedantic as the couturier,
insisting that jeans, sneakers, and T-shirts are no longer the garb of
the serious athlete. Oh dear me, no: the serious athlete must dress in a
style which suggests the breaking of records is but a sprint away. She
may shun fashion in the normal sense but she will still be aware of a
certain sartorial etiquette -- the colours of the season; the preferred
ensembles of Olympian stars.
Leisure variations of sports attire have, in fact, become one of the
most profitable sections of the garment industry, for here, as much as
anything, is fashion for the unemployed. And unless you go for snooty
labels the stuff inside the squash bag can be thrown together quickly at
relatively little cost. In design the Americans have led the way,
inspired by the clubby pastimes of a wide-open, outdoor country and the
sheer verve of all that ethnic style on the block. The west coast has
brought surf chic in from the ocean while the east coast has freed boxer
shorts from the ghetto and the ringside to make them the cute play-pants
of sophisticated cities.
But for those of us who may have lapsed from the furies of aerobics to
curl into the serenity of yoga the unitard is the thing, an elongated
all-in-one worn tight as a drumskin, from shoulder to thigh, and made of
wondrously light, accommodating fabrics. Encouraged by the staying power
of exercise, many manufacturers now have extended their ranges to
include co-ordinated separates, a sort of 24-hour wardrobe to kid the
world the wearer is spring loaded.
Much of exercise, though, is narcissism packed in lycra. Yet today the
fitness sceptic who uses this excuse to defend slouching to the bone
gains little hearing. This is the age of elasticity, of physical and
aspirational stretching. A new, euphoric brigade is dressing to practise
what it preaches. But in the end the new-fangled cosmic workout is the
same old flab intolerance, tuned and pepped, tweaked and smartened to
keep virtue's mind and matter trim.

A LABOUR Party bid to extend the rights of access of absent fathers in
Scotland to their children was rejected by the Government yesterday.
Under proposals in the Children (Scotland) Bill, which began its
committee stage in the Commons, a father would have rights and
responsibilities in relation to a child ''only if married to the mother
at the time of the child's conception or subsequently.''
Labour argued that this restriction was too tight, and that there were
circumstances in which fathers who had not been married to the mother of
their children could take on rights and responsibilities for their
offspring.
Labour's argument, generally supported by the Liberal Democrats and
the SNP, was that marriage should not be the sole criterion in judging
the matter and that a number of safeguards would be introduced to ensure
that, as a number of MPs put it, ''wasters'' did not turn up after years
of neglect claiming rights over the child.
However, Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton told the
committee that he was convinced the provisions in the Bill were
preferable to what the Opposition proposed, and that after a great deal
of consideration the Government believed it had managed to get the
balance right.
He said: ''Granting automatic rights to all fathers is difficult to
justify where a child has been born as a result of a casual relationship
and the father has shown no interest in the child. There is also a
problem where a child has been born in unfortunate circumstances, such
as rape.''
The Bill would make it easier for a father who showed a genuine
interest in his child to acquire parental responsibilities and rights by
agreement with the mother. Where agreement could not be reached, the
father could apply to the courts, which would ''treat the interests of
the child as paramount in deciding the matter.'' Labour forced the
matter to a vote, but lost by eight to seven.
The Bill, which has broad all-party support, brings in a number of
changes, many of which stem from the inquiry into allegations of child
abuse in Orkney and the inquiry into child care policies in Fife.
One of the main provisions is the introduction of a wider range of
orders and more exacting criteria to be met before children can be taken
into care in emergency situations, including a new exclusion order under
which a suspected abuser could be excluded from a child's home.
Lord James said the Bill was important for Scotland's children. It was
not controversial in party political terms, but it was intricate and
raised difficult questions of child care policy. A number of amendments
had been tabled, all of which would be carefully examined and some of
which would be ''accepted in principle.''
In the Lords yesterday, the Civil Evidence (Family Mediation)
(Scotland) Bill entered its committee stage. It seeks to ensure that
information which emerges during family mediation sessions in the
build-up to separation or divorce cannot subsequently be used as
evidence in open court.
The Private Member's Bill is being piloted through the House by the
Tory peer Baroness Carnegy of Lour and is not being opposed by the
Government. However, it may run out of parliamentary time.

THERE is gloom in the south, but a gleam in the north. Scotland's
residential sector appears to be bucking a sudden downturn in the UK
market which was caused by interest rate anxieties. Market reports from
south of the border are shot through with such doom and gloom that only
a flying visit from Mother Theresa herself could comfort the authors of
the latest estate agency surveys. But in Scotland agents and builders
are much more buoyant. No-one, thank God, is predicting a boom - but
there is a quiet confidence that a fragile recovery is gathering
strength north of the border and there are some areas of rapid activity.
Average UK sales fell by 16% last month compared to January 1994,
according to the Organisation of Corporate Estate Agents -a body which
uses the sales returns of some 4,000 estate agency offices throughout
the UK. Yet during the same month an Edinburgh agent saw his sales
increase by 35% compared with 12 months earlier and, compared with his
January 1993 figures, a massive increase of 350%.
Stewart Saunders, Edinburgh's largest independent estate agency, sold
#2.6 million worth of residential property and took reservations for
#1.5 million of new property in January 1995. ''You have to go back to
the peak of the housing market in 1989 and 19 90 to see similar
figures,'' says Stewart Saunders' managing director David Alves. ''The
present Lothian property market must rank as one of the healthiest in
the country. An interesting feature is the demand for new homes under
#100,000.''
One of his rivals in the capital, Smiths Solicitors &amp; Estate Agents,
reports a dramatic increase in business since the end of January.
''We sold 20% of our stock last week over a broad range of property -
from #44,000 to #240,000,'' says Brian Smith, owner of the business.
''The week starting January 30 was the busiest we have ever had in terms
of new business, for both purchases and sales . We've been taking on
properties at the rate of one a day and selling them at the same rate.''
His counterparts in the south are having a much tougher time, if the
latest report from the National Association of Estate Agents.
Their latest Market Trends survey says that a surge of enquirers and
viewers at the beginning of January was stemmed when interest rate rises
''knocked the confidence and stifled the enthusiasm'' of homebuyers and
sellers.
Some 65% of the 200 UK estate agents participating in the survey said
that the Halifax's mortgage rate rise had an adverse effect on the
market, while the recent increase in the base rate was causing
apprehension and uncertainty.
''The New Year was a really good opportunity for the housing market to
pick up - and at the beginning of January it certainly seemed as if this
was happening,'' says Eva Lomas, President of the 10,000-member NAEA.
''Unfortunately, economic measures have tem porarily poured cold water
on the eagerness of house buyers and sellers.''
But it's not like that in Scotland. While Edinburgh is very buoyant
the Glasgow market is also picking up speed, according to Steve Hamilton
of estate agents SEAL.
''So far, the market up here has overcome the interest rate increase
and the reduction in MIRAS. Last week was the best week we've seen for
sales in more than a year - which is remarkable during February.'' Sales
ranged from first time buyers to purchasers of large houses in upmarket
south side suburbs like Whitecraigs and prices are being achieved well
above surveyors' valuations. ''But we could be right back at square one
if the Chancellor lets interest rates increase any further,'' says Steve
Hamilton.
It's a similar story in Glasgow's west end where Andy Goodearl of
estate agents Euan Wallace says that the year got off to a brisk start.
''Any traditional property in good condition is attracting a lot of
interest - particularly one and two bedroom tenem ents, these are
selling very quickly.'' Last week he sold a one bedroom flat in Hyndland
at a closing date and with eight offers. ''We've got a strong demand and
a shortage of supply to offer would-be buyers,'' he says.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison reports a ''fragile but brisk'' start to 1995
and were pleasantly surprised to find that most of their clients who
started off the year with the intention of moving decided to press on,
despite the interest rate worries. ''There is a d efinite awareness
amongst potential buyers that prices are affordable, interest rates are
still relatively low and closing dates uncommon. These are good trading
conditions,'' says sales director Stuart Black.
The firm's Glasgow branches all reported a good start to the year with
the city centre, west end and Dennistoun branches all seeing an upsurge
in demand for flats up to #70,000. But the most dramatic results came
from the firm's Hamilton branch which ach ieved its best ever results
for the beginning of a year. Demand was consistent for all sorts of
property from first time flats in Hamilton to a sale in Bothwell which
achieved over #200,000.
The new homes sector in the west of Scotland also appears to be
picking up rapidly. In a remarkable three week purple patch Barratt sold
#1 million worth of homes at Coatbank in Coatbridge. A dozen homes were
reserved straight from the plans, even though the first houses will not
be ready for occupation until May.
The quiet upturn in demand appears to be penetrating as far as the
bens and glens. Normally as cold as ghillie's welly at this time of
year, demand for country houses is getting into its stride. Paul Jackson
of country house agents Langley-Taylor says: '' An unusual number of
house hunters have defied the dark days and have decided to look in
earnest for their country property in the north of Scotland rather than
wait until the Spring. The number of genuine buyers has increased
dramatically.''
The demand is coming mainly from middle-aged people willing to work
from home or commute, preferably on a weekly basis. Their price range is
from #100,000 to #300,000, for which they hope to find a house with four
to six bedrooms and two or three public rooms. Some land and complete
privacy are key attractions.
''We anticipate that property values will rise little over the next
twelve months but we do expect an increase in the number of sales'' says
Jackson.
Pessimistic UK property statistics should be read with caution, the
markets on either side of the border appear to be diverging with
Scotland coming out on top.

A STAGGERING #300,000 an acre is the value being put on a suburban
Edinburgh building plot which comes with outline planning permission for
residential development. Building land rarely comes on the market in
Colinton, and this plot in Grant Avenue is only available because in
1923, when the Merchant Company Charities Board put the land up for sale
to form the avenue, some of the residents of Woodhall Road purchased the
land at the bottom of their gardens to prevent any new building.
The ground was subsequently incorporated into an existing private
garden and has over the years matured into an established garden with
herbaceous borders, plenty of mature shrubs and trees as well as fruit
and vegetable plots.
This near-half-acre plot at 10 Grant Avenue offers someone a rare
chance to build a house in one of Edinburgh's most popular residential
areas.
The asking price is offers over #150,000. The agents say the house
that is to be built on the plot will probably fetch #400,000 or more.

UNION leaders in Strathclyde region are on a collision course with
Labour councillors over the authority's proposals to deal with a #107m
financial crisis.
They warn that a savings package which includes #47m of cuts could
spin out of control, crippling services and lead to compulsory rather
than voluntary redundancies.
A mass lobby of Labour councillors, organised by the Strathclyde Joint
Trade Union Council, will take place outside the region's headquarters
in Glasgow today.
That will be followed by further action, possibly including a one-day
strike by a number of unions, outside the Scottish Office in Edinburgh
in early April.
Strathclyde is facing its worst financial crisis, with a budget
shortfall of #107m because of Government grant cuts. By shedding 1000
jobs, and increasing the council tax by 15% councillors hope to deal
with part of the problem.
The shortfall is to be dealt with by paying for #45m of revenue
expenditure from capital which -- if the Scottish Secretary approves it
-- will have the knock-on effect of wiping out a number of major
projects.
That is the crux of the problem for the unions, said Mr Donald Shiach,
secretary of the SJTUC. He warned Labour councillors that they don't
know what the consequences of their actions will be.
''If the Secretary of State agrees to this we are looking at massive
cuts in council departments such as roads, architects and direct works
because existing capital projects will drop out.
''If he doesn't agree we're looking at cuts across the board -- and we
fear we are back to the original budget options which include closing
old people's homes, police stations, day nurseries and outdoor education
centres.''
Mr Shiach said the capitalisation move was designed to take the
council past the looming local authority elections. He declared: ''I
think they are living on a wing and a prayer and this is a device to
take them through the unitary elections. They think they have found a
loophole but it is not. It is just a device to stall things until after
the elections.
''There are people working in areas like roads who look at the
proposed #47m cuts and say we can live with that. What they don't know
is that there is this #45m waiting to hit them.''
Mr Shiach said the unions believed the ''main villain of the piece was
Ian Lang'' but that the regional council's response was a major problem.
The unions have also challenged Strathclyde's figure of 1000
redundancies claiming the real number of job losses will be at least
2000.
Mr Shiach said it was extremely unlikely that staff would volunteer to
go -- forcing the region to consider compulsory redundancies.
But Strathclyde's Labour leader Bob Gould said the region had no
option but to go down the capitalisation road. ''If we don't take it
from the capital, we have to take it from revenue and the implications
would be worse. We feel this is the best option.
''If the unions can find a better way of doing it lets hear from them.
We feel we don't have any choice. If anybody wants a 65% council tax
increase, then I have yet to hear from them.''
Councillor Gould said he accepted the unions would lobby and make
their feelings known. ''These people represent a position. They are
anxious for their jobs and their families as they have a right to be.''
He added that compulsory redundancies would be ''the very last resort.
We will do everything possible to avoid that.''
* Amid fierce protests over Scottish Office capping, Borders Region
yesterday cut deeply into a range of services -- including education,
social work and roads -- to find #5m worth of savings.
Eighteen teaching jobs are set to go in secondary and primary schools,
despite an official appeal from the region's head teachers. To reduce
the impact on academic subjects, the job losses will be concentrated on
art, music and PE departments, and be achieved where possible by early
retirement.
The council tried to soften the blow by taking #1.5m out of its
reserves, but it must still implement more than #3m worth of savings,
which include #1,535,000 from education, #566,000 from social work and
#440,000 from roads and transportation.
In addition, council tax increases at more than double the rate of
inflation are to be imposed, raising the regional share of payment for a
Band D council taxpayer from #384 to #413.

OWNING a second home is an attractive, but daunting, prospect.
However, a Scottish property firm believes that it has the answer at its
holiday cottages in St Andrews in Fife and Drummore, near Portpatrick.
St Andrews Properties says that buying a home in the country and renting
it out as a holiday accommodation offers an affordable way of buying a
second home.
With the rental income covering running expenses and finance costs,
there are also tax concessions available to owners.
People have been deterred in the past by the worry of leaving their
country retreat unattended for most of the year, as well as the problem
of organising the lets, the cleaning and the maintenance from hundreds
of miles away. St. Andrews Properties claims to have the solution by
offering buyers its existing holiday accommodation in St Andrews and
Mull of Galloway, with proven rental income and on-site management and
maintenance services.
Dron Court, near St Andrews (the Open Championship venue for 1995), is
an architect designed farm conversion of 12 courtyard cottages set in
two acres of gardens overlooking the Eden Valley.
The second location is the village of Drummore near the Mull of
Galloway where seven fishermen's cottages have been constructed with
views over Loch Bay to the Solway Firth. All of the cottages offered for
sale are well equipped and have been rated four crowns -- highly
commended - by the Scottish Tourist Board. Prices start at #42,000.
Letting your country home as holiday accommodation can qualify you for
attractive tax breaks. These can include full relief for the interest on
a mortgage raised to buy the property (even for loans above the normal
#30,000 ceiling) as well as protection against capital gains tax through
either roll-over relief or retirement relief.
The cottages are being sold by Edinburgh solicitors Simpson &amp; Marwick.

NIGHTCLUB reveller Andrew Naylor drank himself to death on water after
taking a single tablet of the rave drug ecstasy, an inquest was told
yesterday.
He drank more than 26 pints of tap water after taking the drug, which
can cause the body to overheat.
Pathologist Dr John Clark told the Sheffield inquest that Mr Naylor,
20, died from brain damage caused by water intoxification.
He said Mr Naylor consumed more water than his body could cope with
and that caused his brain to swell.
Mr Naylor, of The Orchard, Monyash, Derby, bought the single ecstasy
tablet in Sheffield's Leadmill night club.
In the next two-and-a-half hours, a friend estimated, Mr Naylor drank
as many as 30 half-litre bottles of water, filling it repeatedly from
the wash-basin tap in the toilets.

THEY say that Lanark is big, but Biggar is better. An opportunity to
turn a Biggar cottage into a bigger house is being marketed by Edinburgh
agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe.
Mill Cottage, which stands beside the Biggar Water, is being sold
along with the former mill -- both of which are in an idyllic setting
near the centre of the town which is famous for its Long Street.
The chance to make it even bigger comes from the mill, which has
planning consent for conversion to form a dwelling house.
The adjacent Mill Cottage has two public rooms, three bedrooms,
kitchen and bathroom. There is central heating and garage.
A fixed price of #128,000 is sought for the entire property.
''This is an opportunity for a family or builder to live in Mill
Cottage and restore the mill. It offers a challenge and potential for
re-sale or conversion,'' says John Brown of DTZ Debenham Thorpe.

THE Government failed to consult properly on its plans to privatise
the air traffic control network, the all-party Commons Transport Select
Committee said yesterday.
In their report on the future of the network, the MPs criticise the
Department of Transport for not allowing enough time for views to be
expressed. ''Six weeks is simply not long enough to allow interested
parties to give a fully considered view on a complex set of proposals.''
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney has promised to bring forward
legislation to sell the National Air Traffic Control Service, known as
Nats, to the private sector in the next Parliament.
Hundreds of flights a day are handled by two Nats centres, one in
England, the other at Prestwick.
The report finds that the Government has not given sufficient
consideration to the alternative of keeping Nats in the public sector,
but as a commercially driven business.
''Before the Government proceeds with its plans, we recommend that it
publish detailed arguments as to why it does not favour the alternative
put to us of converting Nats into a profit-making public sector
company,'' the report states.
Yesterday committee member Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame
South, said he opposed privatisation as a solution, and emphasised the
need to maintain both air-space monitoring centres. ''I will continue to
to argue for that and that is why I have grave concerns about
privatisation,'' he said.
Nats is part of the Civil Aviation Authority, which has a safety
regulation group to oversee air traffic control. The committee said it
was ''uncomfortable'' with the proposal that this safety group stay
within the CAA under privatisation.
The committee has recommended that if Government plans proceed, the
safety group's work should be transferred to a separate body.
Unions and some airlines have opposed plans to privatise Nats. The
committee reported that the British Air Line Pilots' Association had
told it the proposed plans were ''almost certain'' to produce pressures
to reduce labour costs and that ''underpaid, overworked, and demoralised
controllers are not conducive to air safety''.

A SINN Fein member of Derry City Council will appear in court today.
Mary Nelis has been charged with unlawful imprisonment of a woman, and
is to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court.
Ms Nelis is one of six people detained for questioning by the RUC in
an early-morning arrest operation in nationalist areas of Londonderry on
Monday.
Two men arrested in the same operation face the same charge and a
charge of intimidation. The charges are understood to relate to an
incident in Londonderry at the beginning of the month.
The men have been named locally as Noel McCartney and Terence Meehan,
who, Sinn Fein say, are members of the Ballymagroarty Community
Association.
Three other people detained were released without charge. They include
Dodie McGuinness, a former Sinn Fein member of Derry City Council and a
member of Sinn Fein's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation delegation, and
Gerry Doherty, also a former Sinn Fein councillor.
The RUC declined to comment on reports that a 21-year-old mother of
three has been taken into protective custody.
The reports claimed the woman left her home in Londonderry's
Ballymagroarty area with her three children and last Wednesday
voluntarily walked into Strabane RUC station.

A TURKISH clothing manufacturer is setting up an #8m factory at
Irvine, creating 450 jobs over the next four years, it was announced
yesterday.
The Istanbul-based Meric International Corporation will produce
sportswear garments, mainly T-shirts and sweatshirts, for both the
European and US markets.
Mr George Kynoch, the Scottish Industry Minister, praised the joint
efforts of Locate in Scotland, Enterprise Ayrshire and Irvine
Development Corporation in landing this latest inward investment.
''Scotland faced strong international competition to secure this
project, but the availability of a skilled and flexible workforce, and
the long tradition of textiles manufacture in Ayrshire, helped us to
attract the project,'' Mr Kynoch said.
MIC chairman, Mr Iliya Meric, said: ''We plan to establish an
integrated plant in Irvine that will incorporate dyeing/finishing,
knitting and cut and sew operations. ''The project represents a
significant investment to MIC which will allow us to expand our group's
operations in the international market place, satisfying our strategy
for growth in Europe and entry in the US market.''
MIC already employs about 1000 people, manufacturing sports and
leisure wear for a number of international companies, in Turkey.
At Irvine, MIC will initially operate from a building in the
Meadowshead industrial estate while its 33,000 sq ft plant, which is
being bought from Irvine Development Corporation, in the Riverside
business park is being fitted out. The company is also purchasing six
acres of land adjacent to the Riverside factory to accommodate a new
extension and allow for future expansion on the same site.

ABERDEEN city centre has 100 new flats on the corner site at Charlotte

The project also includes a four-person shared flat which has been

residents. It features lowered work surfaces and easy access for
wheelchairs.
Colin Gough of Langstane said: ''The #1.2m project is the second to be

have been completed well ahead of schedule.''
The new flats will be put on the market soon by the housing
association. Demand is expected to be ''extremely strong''.

THE media spotlight is on the British and Irish premiers as they
pursue the cause of peace here today.
The intention is to create a historic moment at the publication of the
joint framework document which doubters will have difficulty challenging
without appearing to gatecrash the celebration.
Last-ditch pleadings from the Unionists to derail the peace process
look set to fall on deaf ears as they face a historic shift in ground.
Irish Premier John Bruton said as much when he made clear yesterday
that whatever follows by way of discussion and consultation, the
publication of the latest London-Dublin declaration of intent makes
constitutional change inevitable.
Mr Bruton said: ''There is a contingent understanding between the
Governments as to steps we would take, in our case in regard to the
constitution here and, in the British Government's case, in regard to
their constitutional legislation.''
The venue for this morning's publication of the joint framework
document owes everything to the anticipated scale of media attention.
Journalists are being asked to report two hours before the 9.30am event
at the Balmoral Conference Centre, home of the Royal Ulster Agricultural
Society -- a commercial gathering place which represents neutral
territory for all concerned.
Staff there yesterday were given virtually no notice to set up a
360-seat auditorium around a twin-podium focus for Mr Major and Mr
Bruton.
It was announced that the two leaders, who met for dinner last night
at Hillsborough, the Queen's official residence near Belfast, would have
breakfast together today and emerge at 7.30am for a televised handshake,
designed to send a message around the world.
Fearful of being locked outside the whole process, and yet central to
the continuation of the ceasefire, were former Loyalist paramilitaries
who have now embraced the political process.
The Ulster Democratic Party and Progressive Unionist Party -- the
political wings of the UDA and UVF -- met yesterday and emerged to vent
their feeling that having taken the bold step of laying down their arms
they should now be given ''parity of esteem'' within the dialogue as it
moves forward.
Mr Gary McMichael of the UDP confirmed that there could be a ''real
dialogue'' after today's publication but said it was vital that they
were not excluded. ''I think they have got to be realistic and they have
to accept that we are going to have to move the situation forward
quickly. Are we going to have a situation in which parties such as
ourselves will remain in quarantine?''
Immediately after the publication statements this morning Mr Bruton
will depart and Mr Major will convene a new meeting at the same venue to
outline the Government's proposals for its Strand One document,
explaining how Stormont will be revived as a new Northern Ireland
Assembly.
While both the Official Unionists and the DUP have published documents
to try and stall the inevitable, a distinguished Unionist yesterday
scorned the joint framework as a ''conditional surrender.''
Mr Robert McCartney, QC, said: ''It is a declaration of policy and
intent and the only solution it adumbrates is Irish unity.''
He added: ''The essence of this document is to transfer, so far as
possible, the future administration of Northern Ireland away from the
UK.
''The future governance would not be a joint authority in the sense of
a division of executive powers between the UK and the Republic. It would
be joint authority as between a puppet Northern Ireland Assembly and the
Republic.''
Mr McCartney was writing in a Belfast newspaper article, which carried
alongside a powerful plea for the peace initiative to be seized.
It came from the president of Northern Ireland's biggest private
sector firm Shorts Bombardier, Mr Roy McNulty. He said: ''The importance
which the peace process places on accelerating economic growth in the
province can hardly be over emphasised.''
Mr McNulty added that talks offered a chance for Northern Ireland to
put the troubles behind it. He declared: ''We must not miss this
opportunity.''

LEADERS of Britain's business community came out fighting yesterday in
the row over the remuneration for top executives of privatised
utilities.
The director-general of the Institute of Directors, Mr Tim
Melville-Ross, and the director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, Mr Howard Davies, appeared before the Commons Employment
Select Committee, amid fresh public concern about boardroom payments.
They acknowledged that perhaps more could be done to curb share
options which, according to recent figures, have netted millions for
senior directors, but were clear that market forces must prevail when it
came to up-front salaries.
Mr Melville-Ross, who was questioned by the committee for more than an
hour, accepted some of the criticism levelled at him by hostile MPs.
Asked by the committee chairman, Labour MP Greville Janner (Leicester
West) whether there had been a number of cases in which the share option
issue had been mishandled, Mr Melville-Ross replied simply: ''Yes.''
Pressed on the matter again, Mr Melville-Ross emphasised that it was
quite clear from what he had said that something should be done.
On the up-front payments to senior executives, however, both Mr
Melville-Ross and Mr Davies firmly denied charges from MPs that they
were ''apologists'' for senior executives, and both took a firm line.
Mr Melville-Ross said that executive remuneration clearly had an
effect on workforce morale, and that the conditions affecting staff as a
whole were one of the things that should be borne in mind.
It was wrong, however, to ''seek to determine directors' pay by
reference to the generality of what the workforce was being paid,
because ''what was being dealt with the was the market place.''
Mr Melville-Ross was clear that the ultimate sanction lay with the
remuneration committees and then with the shareholders, and he said:
''There is a degree of public concern which, if not addressed by
institutional shareholders, will get out of hand.''
Mr Melville-Ross accepted that what was happening now was the
''politics of envy'' and an ''explosion of resentment.'' The IoD had to
be more open about exactly what directors did, and he told the
committee: ''We are losing sight of the vital role directors' perform.
It is directors who are driving the whole process on which wealth
creation depends.'' Good performance should be rewarded as well as poor
performance penalised.
The IoD put forward to the committee a written submission in which it
proposed a new framework for remuneration committees in recommending the
pay structure for company directors.
At face value it is a paper tiger, but it does suggest, among other
recommendations, that if the shareholders are not satisfied that members
of the remuneration committee or the board have acted in a responsible
way, their ultimate sanction should be to remove them.
Mr Davies, backing Mr Melville-Ross's line, told the committee: ''We
are moving towards a more global market in terms of senior executives.
We have a problem in terms of rebuilding public confidence, but I do not
accept that the UK is out of line in rewards paid to top executives.
''We have a job to do in convincing people that these rewards are set
fairly, and clearly we have not managed to convince them so far.''
Both men defended the composition of a committee set up by the CBI
under the chairman of Marks and Spencer, Sir Richard Greenbury, to
consider guidelines on top salaries.
However, MPs poured scorn on its membership which is made up of 11
business leaders, all earning high salaries, without independent members
or representatives of the public.
INDUSTRY CHIEFS' IMAGE HIT OVER PAY AND PERKS
By Peter Mulligan, Parliamentary Staff, PA News
Britain's employers' organisations conceded tonight that the public
image of business has been damaged by big pay awards and perks to
company chiefs.
The admission came when Howard Davies, chairman of the Confederation
of British Industry, was cross-examined by the Commons Employment Select
Committee.
''We do accept that we have a problem in rebuilding public
confidence,'' he told the MPs who are inquring into pay levels of
business leaders following public outcry on the issue.
He insisted: ''I would not accept that the UK corporate sector was out
of line internationally in the rewards paid to senior people.
''But we have a job to do in convincing people those rewards are set
fairly. Clearly we have not managed to convince them so far.''
Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors,
said pay had to be set by reference to the market and added: ''If that
results in the sort of pay levels we are now seeing, so be it.''

Select committee chairman Greville Janner (Lab Leicester W) declared:
''This will not allay public feelings in any way.''
The Greenbury Committee was ''an internal, cosy consideration by
people, all of whom have a direct personal and corporate interest in the
result'', he said.

ADVISORY
Mr Melville-Ross, a member of the Greenbury Committee, told the MPs
that he earned #160,000 a year.
He said he was also paid a #10,000 fee for sitting on one remuneration
committee and #15,000 for sitting on another.
Mr Davies disclosed he earned #158,000 a year plus #20,000 for sitting
on a remuneration committee for one day a month.
He received between #3,000 and #4,000 a year as a member of the
international advisory board of the NatWest bank which meets two or
three times a year.
Under questioning, both witnesses voiced reservations about share
options being paid as perks to top executives.
Mr Melville-Ross conceded they were a ''one-way bet''.
Asked by Mr Janner if options had been handled ''disgracefully'' in
some cases, he said: ''I think that is fair.''
Mr Davies stressed share options were appropriate for small companies
and said he did not wish to see them outlawed.
But those that were unrelated to the whether the stock price went up
were ''becoming increasingly difficult to justify''.
Criticising compensation packages, he said: ''Companies have paid
people excessively for failure and do not have very good justification
always for the length of contract that they have or for the rolling
nature of that contract.''
mf rs
211949 FEB 95
Mr Davies also told the MPs: ''We believe there are some problems in
the way that companies set remuneration and that a considerable amount
of tidying up could be done and rationalisation of methods that people
use.''
He described the Greenbury Committee as made up of ''very highly
responsible business people whose opinion will have considerable weight.
''I recognise that there is public concern and we feel that we should
react to it,'' he added.
However, there were signs of a split among Tories on the select
committee.
Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk N) said there was a ''degree of hypocrisy''
in the country over executive pay.
But David Nicholson (Taunton) said he regarded the witnesses as
''apologists'' and declared there had been an ''explosion of
resentment'' by the public.
Former minister Tim Yeo (Suffolk S) protested when Mr Janner attacked
the composition of the Greenbury Committee.
''There seems to be no justification in your line of questioning at
all,'' he said.

MANY a tear threatened to fall yesterday as Glasgow Libraries
announced it was putting vinyl out of the game, writes JOHN MacCALMAN.
Because of declining demand, Glasgow Libraries will no longer be
lending vinyl LP records after March 31.
However, vinyl buffs will have the opportunity to snap up some
nostalgia when the collection of more than 2000 albums is sold off later
this year.
As well as lack of demand, the audio service has had difficulties with
availability of vinyl records, which are also more vulnerable to damage
than cassettes or CDs.
Some councillors expressed concern at an arts and culture committee
meeting yesterday that the proposal could mean a withdrawal of a service
for people who had a record deck but no tape or CD facilities.

BRITISH film-maker Ken Loach yesterday released his new film -- a
video short produced in 48 hours defending Clause 4 -- with a call on
Labour to take an aggressive stance in favour of widespread public
ownership.
Mr Loach's decision to come to the aid of those resisting Labour
leader Tony Blair's efforts to modernise the party was overshadowed by
controversy when he had to defend himself against charges that his
Labour Party membership has lapsed.
Clause 4: the Movie, produced on a shoestring in two days, received
its premiere in a crowded room in Westminster yesterday. The only
royalty on hand to grace the event was Mr Tony Benn, a member of the
Labour aristocracy.
The video, prepared for the Defend Clause 4 Campaign, is intended as a
response to the videos supporting change distributed by the Labour
leadership to constituencies.
In it, a group of miners, rail workers and trade unionists explain how
market forces have ruined their employment prospects.
One man claims that while working as a security guard he was paid
#1.20 an hour, while his dog received #3 an hour. Their case is
reinforced by several economists who argue that capitalism and social
justice are incompatible.
However, despite efforts by the news conference organisers to steer
questions towards the issues raised by the film -- the international
control of capital and the need to keep it under democratic ownership --
attention focused on Mr Loach's assertion that he would resign his
membership of the Labour party if Clause 4 is scrapped.
Mr Loach, whose films about social decay in Britain include Cathy Come
Home and Kes, allegedly promised to ''sell my membership card in a
charity auction because I shan't need it any more'' if Mr Blair's
attempts to throw out CLause 4 were successful.
Mr Blair's office yesterday told reporters that Mr Loach's membership
had lapsed for non-payment of dues. Mr Loach dismissed the claims and
said he had been a party member ''since before Harold Wilson was Prime
Minister''.
However, he conceded that his membership ''may well'' have lapsed.
''The local secretary has long since ceased to collect subs, and it is
all done through Visa cards, and the local organisation tends to
disintegrate on these occasions,'' he said.
''I really resent just simply giving my Visa card to Walworth Road
(Labour HQ), and saying 'OK, you subtract what you want' and having no
local organisation.''
* In the Commons Mr Major told MPs he would not be nominating Mr Loach
for an Oscar, and expressed surprise that Mr Blair is encountering
resistance to his proposal to modernise the party.

A BID to ensure that major sporting events are shown on Britain's four
terrestrial television channels, and not screened exclusively on
satellite or cable, was launched in the Commons yesterday.
MPs were told the loss of key competitions in football, golf and
cricket to Sky Television and the cable companies had left millions of
people unable to see them.
Labour MP Bruce Grocott's Television Sport (Public Access) Bill
received its formal first reading without a vote, although it stands no
chance of becoming law.
It seeks to protect key sporting events from being shown exclusively
on cable and satellite channels.
It would ensure the Fifa World Cup finals, the FA Cup Final, the
Scottish Cup Final, Wimbledon finals, the Olympic Games, the Derby,
Grand National and Test matches in England also could be screened on
BBC, ITV and Channel 4 television channels.
Mr Grocott (The Wrekin) said: ''My Bill is simply to try to stop the
rot that has set in in the loss of many sporting events to the major
channels.''
He added: ''Let's be clear how many people can watch major events,
once they are transferred.
''Penetration of the terrestrial channels is 99%: 23 million
households. Satellite and cable is 18%: four million households.''
Audiences for Sky's football fixtures were generally under a million,
as opposed to between 7.5 and 8 million for terrestrial television.''The
net effect has been the loss of millions of potential viewers from
watching live sport,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Lifelong pension for war widows rejected</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Government narrowly avoided defeat in the Lords last night when
peers rejected, by 131 votes to 124, cross-party demands for lifelong
pensions for war widows.
At present, war widows forfeit their #140-a-week pension if they
remarry or co-habit, even if they are widowed for a second time.
Last night's demands, from Independent Lord Freyberg, were supported
by, among others, former Chiefs of the Defence Staff, Lords Bramall,
Lord Carver and Lord Craig of Radley and Tory peers Baroness Faithfull,
Lord Boyd-Carpenter and Baroness Park of Monmouth.
For the Government, Social Security Minister Lord MacKay of
Ardbrecknish said that about 90,000 war widows had remarried since 1939.
Depending on how many still were alive, Lord Freyberg's proposal could
cost about #60m a year -- ''a very expensive thing to do''.
He said: ''We fully appreciate the sacrifice the late husbands made on
behalf of their country. But to continue to pay these very preferential
pensions when a war widow has remarried is neither justified nor fair to
other widows.
Lord Freyberg said: ''Many war widows are living lives of loneliness,
dictated by the character of the pensions regulations and most Service
widows are in severe financial difficulty.
''The true cost of honouring them in this victory anniversary year
would be very modest.''
Field Marshal Lord Bramall said: ''Surely, in this 50th anniversary
year of all years, there is a golden and perhaps once-only window of
opportunity to improve this discreditable situation.'' It was an
occasion for Ministers to show some compassion.
Lord Carver urged: ''This time, for heaven's sake, let the Government
put its hand in its pocket.
''On this occasion, when we are remembering the men who died and the
women who were left behind, let the Government be generous for once.''

<TEXT>
MORE than 1500 people a year are allowed into Britain from abroad
because the Immigration Service lacks the facilities to hold them,
according to a report out today.
The survey, by the National Audit Office, found that in 1993 about
1650 arrivals at UK ports of entry were given temporary admission even
though there were sufficient grounds to detain them under the
immigration laws.
The report also highlights a #22m backlog built up in unpaid charges
levied on airlines and shipping companies for bringing in passengers
lacking proper documentation.
The Immigration Service currently has access to about 470 overnight
holding places at detention centres. However, with 10,000 people a year
being held overnight or longer, this accommodation is often full or
close to capacity.
THE Government faces a fresh legal challenge to its immigration
controls under European law. The High Court next week will be asked to
refer the issue of Britain's power to carry out border checks on people
arriving from other EU countries to the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg.
The Standing Conference on Racial Equality in Europe (Score), which is
bringing the case, argues that the maintenance of passport checks
breaches Britains obligations under the Treaty of Rome.
They dismissed the Government's position that a general declaration by
the EU Heads of Government obtained by Margaret Thatcher in 1985 allows
Britain to keep its border controls.

THE row over executive pay intensified yesterday, with Labour, the
unions and the banking industry watchdog reacting angrily to reports
that National Westminster Bank chairman Lord Alexander is in line for a
#100,000 bonus on top of his #304,000 basic salary.
However, when challenged in the Commons about ''boardroom greed,'' the
Prime Minister -- while condemning ''unjustified'' pay rises -- again
expressed his opposition to a policy to control top people's pay or
ensure a minimum wage at the bottom.
NatWest -- which reported a huge #1.6 billion profit but refused to
confirm this would mean a bonus of around #100,000 for Lord Alexander --
was denounced by Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown.
He said that bank customers would be surprised and disappointed to
find that while they were paying higher charges and receiving little
benefit from the current huge rise in profits, directors were using the
cyclical increase to pay themselves substantial bonuses and free shares
without prior shareholder approval.
The Banking Insurance and Finance Union pointed out that the bonus
payment was being made against a background of 20,000 jobs cut since
1990, with a further 3000 due to go this year, and at a time when half
of the bank's 52,000 staff were due for pay increases below the rate of
inflation and 8% of them due nothing at all.
The Independent Banking Advisory Service went so far as to brand
NatWest a ''predator'' bank ''driven by greed''.
The service's chief executive, Mr Eddy Weatherill, said that the bank
received nearly one in four of all complaints made against banks last
year and pointed out that people were never aware of the broken
businesses and homes left in the wake of NatWest's profit figure.
NatWest chief executive Mr Derek Wanless said at a news conference
that the 52,000 employees of NatWest UK would receive a 7%
profit-sharing bonus at the end of March, up from 4.3% of their annual
salary for the previous year.
Lord Alexander said directors' pay was decided by a remuneration
committee chaired by the former CBI director-general, Sir John Banham.
His pay was being raised, he understood, in line with other senior
directors, although he would not confirm the actual figures which would
be made available to shareholders in next month's annual report.
Details of executive pay and how it was assessed would be set out in
the report and it would be up to the shareholders to make their feelings
known at the annual meeting.
''If the shareholders don't like it, they always have the right to
change the stewardship of the company,'' he added.
* In the Commons, SNP leader Alex Salmond said to Mr Major: ''Can I
offer you the chance to do something about fat cat salary increases.
''Thousands of shareholders in British Gas, suported by staff, are
going to the annual general meeting in two months' time with a motion to
cap the outrageous pay increase of Mr Cedric Brown.
''Does that motion carry you support or not?''
Mr Major replied: ''I have made absolutely clear to you and others
before that if you put an industry in the private sector, it must make
its decisions in the private sector, and that applies to British Gas as
for other companies.''

TWO partners in a leading Scottish legal practice specialising in
trade union work last night levelled criticism over a prosecution
against them.
Mr David Stevenson and Mr Lawrence Lumsden, of Robin Thompson and
Partners, Edinburgh, launched the attack after a fraud charge against
them was thrown out by a sheriff after three weeks of evidence and legal
debate before a jury.
Both had denied overcharging other solicitors when recovering the
expenses of successful legal actions.
Sheriff Andrew Lothian had ruled at Edinburgh Sheriff Court that the
two solicitors had no case to answer, without the defence being required
to lead evidence.
The lawyers' attack came in a statement issued by Mr Stevenson soon
after the ruling, and supported by Mr Lumsden. It said that the
solicitors were delighted, not only with their acquittal, but that the
sheriff had held that there was no case to answer.
It added: ''I strongly object to the use of taxpayers' money being
used to finance publicly a groundless prosecution based on the spurious
allegations of a disgruntled former employee.''
The statement also said: ''We have been a thorn in the flesh of the
Government from the time of the miners' strike, through to opposition to
privatisation of public services, and up to our recent success in
opposing changes to the Criminal Injuries Compensation system and the
deduction of benefits from injured victims.
''I am looking forward to renewing challenges to Government policies
which take away people's basic rights in the field of employment and
personal injuries.''
The charge against Mr Stevenson, 43, and Mr Lumsden, 38, whose
addresses were given in court as care of the firm, Castle Street,
Edinburgh, alleged that they overcharged a total of 13 times between
December 1985 and May 1992 and gained a total of #2673.09 for their
firm.
The Crown case was closed by Depute-Fiscal Iain McSporran during the
morning and counsel Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, for Mr Lumsden, and Mr James
McGhie, QC, for Mr Stevenson, then argued there was no case for the men
to answer.
Mr Jackson said that he accepted that the bills sent out by Robin
Thompson and Partners did include what were described as ''notional
items'', including items that showed that advocates had been paid for
certain work when they had, in fact, not yet been paid.
The amounts stated as paid to advocates were also not necessarily the
same as the amounts which the advocates had charged Robin Thompson and
Partners.
During the trial the jury heard that senior Scottish counsel's opinion
was that such billing methods were not strictly proper, but were
widespread and not thought of as professional misconduct, far less
illegal.
The trial heard the allegations of overcharging emerged after Mrs
Gaenor Stuart-Murray came from an associated firm in England to work for
Robin Thompson and Partners in Scotland.

BANK manager Hector MacGillivray, cleared yesterday of embezzling
#163,000 in old notes due for incineration, said later he would be
taking legal action against his former employers, Clydesdale Bank.
It took a jury of eight women and five men 80 minutes at the High
Court in Glasgow to find Mr MacGillivray not guilty by a majority of
taking the money over a 20-year period.
Mr MacGillivray, 54, of Thomson Drive, Bearsden, denied during his
three-week trial taking the money from the ''burning boxes'' at the
bank's West George Street cash centre, where he was in charge of the
destruction of around #12m a week in soiled notes.
The bank said later that procedures at the centre had been tightened
in the wake of allegations made during the case. As with the other main
banks, the Clydesdale now granulates soiled notes into a fine pulp,
which is then dumped at landfill sites.
The High Court heard that Mr MacGillivray himself triggered the case
when he allegedly confessed to police -- during a totally unrelated
inquiry two years ago -- that he had been stealing up to #600 a week,
At his bungalow home after the case, Mr MacGillivray said: ''I am
raising an action against the Clydesdale Bank for unfair dismissal, and
we should have a tribunal date soon. I worked for 35 years for the bank,
man and boy, starting in July, 1957.
''I never had any doubts about how the case would go.''
Mr MacGillivray and his wife, Anne, have two sons, aged 15 and 17, who
attend Bearsden Academy.
He said that he was still attending Gartnavel Royal Hospital and took
medication six times a day following a breakdown brought on by the case,
adding: ''I may yet get my mental health back. I have to try to pick up
the pieces and get on with my life. My wife has been the rock of this
family for the last two years. She has had to get on with her life, look
after two boys and keep going.''
Evidence at the High Court suggested that there had been less than
satisfactory procedures at the Clydesdale Bank for soiled note disposal
and, asked if he felt he had been a victim of these procedures, Mr
MacGillivray said: ''This might have a bearing on the industrial
tribunal to come, so I cannot comment. These procedures were not written
by me. I was a victim of rationalisations at the bank, which to my mind
means staff-cutting.
''The result was that for the last two years we have not lived. We
have only existed. Why anyone should have to wait so long for justice I
do not know.''
Police, investigating an unrelated theft of a case holding #43,000
from the bank, tape recorded Mr MacGillivray's confession and examined
his bank accounts. Next day Mr MacGillivray retracted his confession.
In his own evidence he claimed that he inherited #11,000 in old bank
notes from his late father. Mr MacGillivray said he kept the money in a
polythene bag for 13 years in the back of a wardrobe before depositing
it with various building societies.
He denied an allegation made by other staff that he was seen stealing
money, and said he was only changing it. When challenged that the money
was #20 short, Mr MacGillivray simply produced a #20 note, the court
heard, and threw it on the table. His colleague, clearly embarrassed,
took the matter no further, the court was told, although bank rules had
been broken. Mr MacGillivray also denied ignoring complaints that
bundles of money were under weight before being burned.
Other staff members said in evidence that they were told by him that
there was ''nothing sinister'' about notes marked for burning by them
reappearing in circulation.
The MacGillivrays had #57,000 in assets, the court heard, and Advocate
Depute Mrs Valerie Stacey claimed that #26,000 of it could not be
accounted for.
Mr MacGillivray claimed his mental health suffered because of overwork
imposed on him by the bank.
A spokesman for the Clydesdale Bank said yesterday: ''During the trial
we are aware that deficiencies in our cash centre controls were
highlighted. We are satisfied that, by reinforcing the existing
procedures after the weaknesses were identified in November, 1992, we
were able to re-establish a proper level of control immediately.''
The bank did not wish to comment on the outcome of the ''criminal
action raised by the police against Mr MacGillivray'', the spokesman
said. And, of his allegation that he had been a victim of understaffing
due to cuts, he said: ''We would not wish to comment on any existing or
former employment situation.''
A bank worker is to appear soon in court charged with stealing the
case containing #43,000 which sparked off the whole affair.

TROUBLED construction union UCATT has become embroiled in a damaging
civil war, with its elected executive council members refusing to accept
they have been suspended.
High court action has already begun, and UCATT's general secretary Mr
George Brumwell has been accused of attempting a ''coup'' to abort the
long-heralded merger with the Transport and General Workers' Union.
Mr Brumwell revealed yesterday that the union's lay general council,
''the union's highest governing body'', had decided last Friday to
relieve executive council members of their duties and suspend them on
grounds that ''such action was indispensible for the effective
maintenance of the union''.
He accused the executive of refusing to abide by a January instruction
from the general council to step down after a postal ballot of the
membership decided that UCATT should dispense with a full-time executive
and implement a new lay executive body.
The four-man executive hit back with accusations that Mr Brumwell's
objective was to prevent the UCATT-TGWU merger.
The executive council stressed it would fight Mr Brumwell's case.

DOUNREAY has been reported to HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate
over the illegal discharge of radioactive nitric acid into the Pentland
Firth.
The procurator-fiscal in Wick has forwarded to the inspectorate a
complaint against the Atomic Energy Authority at the nuclear plant.
The complaint was made by the Highland Green Party's nuclear
spokesman, Mr John Martin, after The Herald revealed last week that
Dounreay had been making the discharges for the past 10 years in direct
contravention of the Control of Pollution Act 1985.
The procurator-fiscal, Mr Alasdair MacDonald, said the inspectorate in
Edinburgh ''has fairly wide powers under the Radioactive Substances Act
1993.''
''If it came to a question of prosecution then it would come back to
me but the inspectorate has a wide range of options short of
prosecution.''
The convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson,
meanwhile, is seeking assurances from the responsible bodies that urgent
action would be taken to prevent Dounreay making further discharges.
Mr McPherson has written to Dounreay director John Baxter and to Mr
Duncan Buchanan, director of the Highland River Purification Board.
The board discovered that the discharges were being made in 1993,
eight years after the Control of Pollution Act had come into force.
Dounreay had not applied for consent.
Mr Buchanan was not available yesterday but his deputy, Mr Tom Inglis,
said: ''We have not received Mr McPherson's letter yet so I cannot
really make any comment. I can assure you, however, once we receive it,
it will receive earnest consideration.''
Mr McPherson has asked Mr Baxter ''what steps Dounreay is taking to
ensure that this practice is ceased or is at least properly
controlled?''
AEA spokesman Ian Shepherd said that for two years Dounreay had been
working with the purification board on plans to establish a
neutralisation plant. ''But the board accepts that the discharges are
neutralised very quickly by the seawater and that very little damage is
done.''

A PROPOSAL to close a homoeopathy clinic has been shelved by Greater
Glasgow Health Board after protests from patients. Instead a plan to
expand homoeopathy services has been put forward.
The clinic, in Baillieston, is a satellite of the Glasgow Homeopathic
Hospital, part of the West Glasgow Hospitals University Trust.
Protests from the public about its proposed closure could ultimately
lead to an extension of services to other areas in the West of Scotland
through a network of clinics.
Last October the health board published the closure plan as part of an
attempt to cope with soaring demand for homeopathic services. Officials
argued that transferring the resources and budget to the main hospital
would allow 300 new patients to be seen each year.
At the time there were 2800 patients waiting up to 28 months for a
non-urgent out-patient appointment, and the number was growing rapidly.
Last year the main hospital, in Greater Western Road, saw 990 new
patients, and the clinic 550.
Mr Tom Divers, the board's acting general manager, said there had been
87 responses to the consultation. Sixty-three opposed the closure. There
was also a petition against the closure, with 900 signatures.
In the light of the objections, Mr Divers said: ''The trust has taken
a step back and is looking more widely at the problem of waiting times
and looking at the service being provided elsewhere.
''We are looking at the development of a network of homoeopathic
clinics which would provide access to a homoeopathic treatment to a
greater proportion of the population than is currently possible.
''These proposals will require further discussion with the West of
Scotland health boards to gauge whether they have support from the
various purchasers.''
Pending these proposals the board agreed to defer closure of the
Baillieston clinic. The chairman, Sir Robert Calderwood, said: ''Our
choice of the word defer doesn't mean it is going to be closed on the
quiet -- if it is closed at all it will only be as part of a
reconfiguration of services.''
Homoeopathy is based on prescribing small doses of substances which
produce symptoms similar to those of the condition being treated. It has
a wide following as an alternative medicine, and has come closest to
achieving respectability among practitioners of orthodox medicine.
* The money available to Greater Glasgow Health Board for new
developments next year will be only #2m, compared to #6m last year, the
board was told.

<HEADLINE>Scottish firm to the rescue over A74 contract</HEADLINE>

AN EDINBURGH firm has been called in to bail out an Italian group and
complete a four-mile motorway upgrading of the A74.
The Morrison Construction Group last night confirmed a #4m contract
from Castelli Girola for all outstanding works on a 1.4-kilometre
section of the road.
The deal has the full approval of the Scottish Office, which has been
deeply embarrassed by the Italian contractor's grim performance since it
was awarded the #23.4m contract for the M74 stretch at Annan,
Dumfriesshire.
Castelli Girola, the British management subsidiary of two Milan firms,
was supposed to complete the work last November. Since then, it has
faced Scottish Office penalties of #250,000 for every month past the
official completion date.
But the Scottish Office even advanced #1.75m in December to allow work
to continue after the money was frozen because of a series of arrestment
orders lodged by sub-contractors due payments for work on behalf of
Castelli Girola.
Any reduction in penalties will occur only after an assessment of
reasons behind the delays, likely to be seven months over the 20-month
scheduled contract.
If penalties are imposed in full, Castelli Girola can expect to
receive only about #18m for building the motorway section -- a quarter
down on the agreed price.
A spokesman for Morrison Construction said of its #4m rescue package:
''It will help speed completion of the troubled Eaglesfield to
Kirkpatrick Fleming section.''
Morrison is currently well ahead with an adjacent #13m design and
build upgrading, and will now extend that work to meet up with the
stretch the Italians are still on.
The firm has assumed day-to-day management of the overall contract,
but Castelli Girola remains responsible for completion of the remainder
of works outwith the 1.4-kilometre section.
Morrison Group chairman Fraser Morrison said: ''We are delighted our
track record on the M74 made us the natural choice to assist Castelli
Girola with completion of this key section.''
''We have already put the necessary resources on the ground.''
An exact completion date has still not been given. The best available
remains ''by the summer''.
Castelli Girola's excuses for the massive over-running have
concentrated upon bad weather. However, several British firms which
faced the same wintry conditions and similar engineering challenges have
not only completed other sections ahead of schedule but within budget.
Questions-marks remain over the choice of Italian firms working so far
away from base when celebrated Scottish roadbuilding firms were willing
and able to do the work.

GOVERNMENT problems over health service pay escalated yesterday when
midwives and health visitors became the latest groups to consider
industrial action and Unison sought to open out the nurses' pay row to
include all 440,000 of its members employed in the NHS.
The Royal College of Midwives dismissed the 1% national award as
derisory and the Pay Review Body recommendation that introduced it as
''the kiss of Judas''.
General Secretary Ms Julia Allison said the college's long-standing
''no strike'' policy was being used against the RCM, whose council had
decided it had no alternative but to reconsider its policy on industrial
action.
Members would be balloted next week to assess whether they wanted the
policy reviewed and what sort of action they would be prepared to take,
said Ms Allison, adding that the indications were that they wanted to be
balloted on options such as withdrawal of labour, overtime bans, working
to grade, and the refusal to carry out administrative duties.
The Royal College of Nursing, which has 300,000 members, decided at
the weekend to review its traditional non-strike policy and the Health
Visitors Association also agreed yesterday to conduct a similar ballot
of its members.
Unison's health service executive, meanwhile, endorsed the views of
its nurses sector representives, who last week recommended a major
campaign to win public support for the Government to award the nurses 3%
nationally, not just the 1% nationally with a chance of up to 2% more
through local bargaining.
They also agreed to involve all its NHS member since they anticipated
that offers similar to that made to the nurses and professions allied to
medicine would follow for staff not covered by the pay review bodies.
They include ambulance, ancillary, professional, technical, and
administration staff.
In line with the wishes of their nursing members, the Unison health
service executive also decided to set in train the machinery for an
industrial action ballot, again involving all NHS members.
Before that, however, there will be a six-week consultation period,
beginning on April 1.
Unison's head of health, Mr Bob Abberley, said the campaign aimed to
secure the full 3% for all staff as a minimum, paid in full nationally,
with no reduction in jobs or services, and a withdrawal of the proposal
to introduce local bargaining on NHS pay and conditions.
Yesterday's meeting, which reflected the intense anger felt by nurses
and other staffs around the country at the award, was chaired by Ms Anne
Picking, from Dunfermline, who is now a sister at Ashford Hospital in
Kent.
She described it as her most difficult yet. In 20 years in the NHS,
she had never seen such anger, she said, not even in the 1982 dispute.
However, the issues were wider now, with pay, jobs, and services all
under threat. ''We are really now looking forward to getting into the
campaign and taking the Government on and beating them,'' she added.

THE chief executive of Fife Enterprise yesterday moved to stop the
eviction of the small Methil fishing fleet after his staff gave them 14
days notice to quit the harbour.
After The Herald told how the local enterprise company was about to
sink the fishing business of a former miner who put his redundancy money
into a prawn trawler, chief executive Robert Mackenzie contacted the
fishermen and said he hoped to find a solution.
''I will be instructing that this problem should be solved,'' Mr
Mackenzie told The Herald.
He admitted the eviction, which threatened the businesses created by
men already made redundant from other industries, was ''insensitive''.
It might also have been seen as something of an embarrassment for
Scottish Enterprise which yesterday launched a strategy called Improving
the Business Birth Rate, which aims to see 25,000 new firms in place and
50,000 jobs created by the year 2000.
Fife Enterprise manages the lease of the Methil dock, which the
fishermen use, for Scottish Enterprise. The enterprise company said
there were safety difficulties at the dock, a claim the fishermen
reject.
The lease is assigned to the Methil Boat Club of which the fishermen
are members. Its new terms exclude commercial boats from using it.
The enterprise company also raised the rent from #10 to #1000 a year,
threatening the viability of the boat club.
''The last thing I want to do is to cause anyone to lose their
livelihoods. I am very annoyed we have been seen to be insensitive,''
said Mr Mackenzie.
The Secretary of the Clyde Fishermen's Association, Mr Patrick
Stewart, also contacted The Herald to say some of his members had been
involved in a similar dispute at Greenock with the Renfrewshire
enterprise company.
But, he said, under a law passed by Queen Anne in 1705, Scottish
fishermen had unrestricted use of all harbours in the realm.

There is a little bit of Australia in the far north of Scotland.
Sydney House in Lairg, Sutherland, is a late Victorian country house
which was built by the entrepreneurial Scot James Mackay - a man who
made his fortune in Australian land deals. The property was built in
1897 by when he returned from Australia, preferring the company of the
midgie to that of the kangaroo.
Much of the original detail of the house has been retained, including
ornate open fireplaces, The agent says that those improvements which
have been implemented such as double glazing, fully fitted kitchen and
gas central heating, have been undertaken to a very high standard.
The accommodation comprises on the ground floor: hall, dining room,
sitting room, bedroom, shower room, and kitchen. In addition, there is a
utility room, laundry room, a further shower room, and back stairway
leading to an office. On the first floor are four other bedrooms,
bathroom, WC and dressing room.
Outside there are a range of outbuildings including log store, game
larder and garage, while a short distance from the house lies a
semi-derelict gardener's cottage built in traditional stone and slate.
The cottage's accommodation comprises sitting room, living room, and
three bedrooms, and provides scope for upgrading and renovation.
The grounds extend to three acres, including two grazing parks
adjoining the driveway, and a south facing walled garden with formal
bedrooms, paths, and boxwood hedges.
Bell Ingram chartered surveyors are inviting offers in excess of
#140,000.

THE Bank of Scotland is boldly going where no bank in the United
Kingdom has gone before.
It is exploring new frontiers by launching a credit card exclusive to
Trekkies, fans of the ongoing Star Trek cinema and television saga.
The bank claims that the card, portraying the Starship Enterprise NCC
1701-D engaging warp drive to escape an exploding planet, can be used in
more than 12 million places throughout the Universe.
Created specially for the estimated 15,000 UK Trekkies, it is the
latest affinity credit card to be administered by the bank and is being
marketed by TransNational Financial Services for Star Trek film-makers,
Viacom Paramount.
So far, the bank has paid out more than #3m in royalties to its 300
and more affinity partners, including the RSPCA, Action Aid, the Science
and Natural History museums, and the Institute of Advanced Motorists.
Mr Alex Steven, manager of the Bank of Scotland affinities programme,
said: ''People who take out this card will not only be showing their
interest in Star Trek but will also benefit from a very competitive
credit card.''
The venture is seen as a practical way to strengthen the bank's
relationship with fans and, at the same time, generate extra cash for
Viacom Paramount to finance further adventures.

ROYAL Ballet star Darcey Bussell stepped out at Buckingham Palace
yesterday when she was honoured by the Queen.
The Royal Ballet's youngest principal ballerina, who received the
insignia of the OBE, is now tipped for Hollywood stardom.
''It would be hard to refuse -- but it would have to be a classic
role,'' she said.
The 25-year-old dancer, who started out as a child actress, has
recently overcome a bad ankle injury.
''I've been dancing again since December and I'm now fully
recovered,'' she said.
Four Weddings and a Funeral scriptwriter Richard Curtis, who was made
an MBE, was shy of waiting press photographers and declined to be
pictured with his pregnant girlfriend Emma Freud.
Curtis, who helped launch the Comic Relief charity, said the Queen
approved of Red Nose Day.
''She said she thought the red noses were good because children like
them -- and she's right,'' he said.
Two of Britain's oldest workers, 94-year-old Leonard Vale-Onslow, a
motor-cycle mechanic from Sparkbrook, Birmingham, and Hilda Ford, 92, a
garage sales assistant from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, were also made
MBEs.

EXCLUSIVE
THE cross-country skier who survived a record three nights in the
blizzards last night spoke to The Herald about his ordeal.
Mr Andrew Wilson, 44, went missing near Braemar on Saturday and
rescuers had all but given up hope when he was found alive yesterday
morning.
Last night, as he recovered in Dundee's Ninewells Hospital, Mr Wilson
revealed how he had begun praying that he would be rescued, and how the
day before he was saved, a search helicopter had passed within 200 yards
of where he was crawling on the ground.
At an emotional family reunion, the first person to visit him in
hospital was his wife Marion, 40, who spent a few moments with her
husband before her parents, Alan and Marion Fielding, also went into the
private medical admission ward.
The couple, who have no children, were married at Battlefield East
Church in Glasgow in 1981 after Andy proposed to Marion on the summit of
Schiehallion.
They were joined in the private ward by his skiing colleague Robin
MacNeil, of Cleugh Gardens, Clarkston, Glasgow, who had set off with Mr
Wilson on Saturday, and Mr MacNeil's wife, Morag.
Doctors said Mr Wilson, who is suffering from exhaustion, dehydration,
and mild frostbite to his toes was unable to be taken from his hospital
bed to attend an impromptu news conference held at the hospital by his
family early last night.
However, Mr Wilson told The Herald how he was ''absolutely exhausted
and very lucky to be alive.''
Describing the events leading up to his ordeal, Mr Wilson, of Crofton
Avenue, Croftfoot, Glasgow, said he had wanted to try out lightweight
touring bindings on his skis and had agreed to separate from his
colleague.
He went to the hill Cairn a Claise from where he had taken a bearing
for Carn an Turic.
''I had the skins on my skis which allowed me to go slowly in a
straight line but one came off. I continued tick-tacking and it was then
I lost my bearings for Carn an Turic, but I knew roughly where Cairn a
Claise was.''
Taking regular pauses to recover his energy, he continued: ''I got
back to Cairn a Claise and I went looking in a col -- a low bit of
ground -- for the route but because it was so cloudy I couldn't find it.
I went a bit off course and I decided to put a bivouac up. I thought I
would camp where I was and get off in the morning.
''Unfortunately it stayed foul and I had to stay a second night. I
built a wall of snow around me and stayed in it.
Mr Wilson continued: ''I felt I was probably off the route that Robin
would have given to the rescue services so I felt I was going to have to
get back to the planned route.
''I walked and crawled for some time and about 100 yards from Cairn a
Claise the helicopter loomed over. It was only about 200 yards away but
it didn't see me. That was Monday.
''Then I got down the best part of Carn a Turic and I bivvied again
(in a second location) on Monday night.''
Mr Wilson said his watch had stopped and this morning, although very
tired, he tired to descend further but his progress towards the road,
crawling on some stages of his descent, was painfully slow because of
the soft snow.
He continued: ''Then I saw the helicopter a couple of times when it
was about 50 to 100 yards from the road. It saw me and landed and then
took me to Glenshee ski slopes.''
Describing how he survived for three nights in blizzard conditions, Mr
Wilson added: ''I ate snow and a Mars Bar. I also had another chocolate
bar but I couldn't eat it because my mouth was sore.
''I knew that, had I had to spend another night at 3000ft, I would
have been in trouble because it would have taken two days to get down in
the deep snow.''
Mr Wilson, who said he had had a craving for Irn-Bru on his second
night, said he became worried after the first night and started praying
that the rescue services would find him. He and his wife attend the
King's Park Baptist Church in Glasgow.
Speaking about what he was thinking while on the mountains, he added:
''I knew that after a third night people would be getting worried. I'm
extremely lucky and although I only saw the helicopter at the end I know
that the rescue services did a great job.''
Speaking as she hugged her husband and held his hand, Mrs Wilson said:
''I'm absolutely elated to see him and amazed that he is so well.''
Dr Ray Newton, of Ninewells Hospital, said: ''Mr Wilson is in a
remarkably good condition considering that he has been in the hills for
four days.
''He is a bit dehydrated and quite shattered because he has consumed
all of his energy but as far as we can see he has done all the right
things to stay alive.
''We are reasonably satisfied with his clinical condition. Vascular
surgeons looked at his toes, which were a bit blue, but he is in good
condition and should recover well very soon.''
Dr Newton said Mr Wilson was also a very fit man and this had
undoubtedly helped him survive in the atrocious weather.
He said the first thing Mr Wilson asked for on arrival at the hospital
was a can of Irn-Bru.
Mr and Mrs Wilson were just getting over the death of his father at
the time of the climbing incident. His father James Wilson, a former
newsagent from Old Castle Road in Cathcart, who retired to Largs, died
last September after a short illness.
Mr Wilson's wife had been waiting at their first-floor cottage flat
home in Crofton Avenue, Croftfoot, Glasgow, for news from the rescue
services when the family learned from The Herald that he had been found
alive.
Her father, Mr Alan Fielding, 68, of Carna Drive, Simshill, Glasgow,
said Marion -- a migraine sufferer -- had been getting very little sleep
since her husband went missing and had become withdrawn as a result of
worrying until yesterday morning when the family was contacted by The
Herald.
He said: ''I was standing in the hall when I picked up the telephone
and was told that Andy had been found alive. My wife was standing at her
daughter's bedroom door and I turned to her and put my thumb up saying
'He's okay.' My wife turned round to Marion, who was in bed at the time,
and they both had a good cry.''

A GLASGOW professor on the board of housing quango Scottish Homes has
broken ranks and called for a more open style of management from the
agency.
Academic housing expert Professor Duncan MacLennan, of Glasgow
University, in argues in a discussion paper, which is about to be
published, that there is no reason why the minutes of Scottish Homes
board meetings -- subject to matters of commercial confidentiality --
should not be published.
He told The Herald yesterday that publication of the discussions held
behind closed doors in Edinburgh would make the board -- as well as
individual members -- more accountable.
Professor MacLennan, of the university's centre for housing research
and urban studies, said: ''It strikes me that recently there has been
considerable public debate about what the board thinks about the process
of transferring Scottish Homes houses to alternative landlords, but the
board has said nothing publicly about what it believes.''
The quango has come under increasingly fierce criticism recently from
council leaders and Opposition politicians because of its policy of
refusing to allow district councils, except in rare circumstances, to
acquire any of its housing stock.
Last week, at a Scottish Grand Committee debate in Edinburgh, Labour
MPs accused Scottish Homes of abusing its power and refusing tenants
freedom of choice.
Tenants' groups have been attacking the agency's policy of allowing
only one alternative landlord's name to appear on stock transfer ballot
papers.
Professor MacLennan, clearly concerned that, in some policy areas at
least, the agency is not getting its message across, also told The
Herald: ''In view of the present controversy, I believe it is imperative
that members of the Scottish Homes board have to get out and explain to
the Scottish public what their policies are, and why they think they are
good for Scottish housing.''
He warns against having boards dominated by political appointees,
which he says can make for continuing strife between quango and
municipality.
In his paper, the professor stresses that debate on political issues
as opposed to technical and programme matters is for politicians and not
appointees.
He adds that the board of organisations like Scottish Homes has a
clear duty to inform all political parties about its decisions and the
programme it is following.
Despite his criticisms, Professor MacLennan firmly believes there is a
continuing national role for an innovative housing agency in Scotland
which is involved in funding and supervising housing associations and
municipal housing companies and in providing information for housing
planning. However he stresses it needs all-party support.
''We will need a Scottish housing quango, I believe, at least into the
next century. But we also need a cross-party consensus at national and
local levels about what we do, what it should be, and how it should
behave,'' he writes.

A DEVELOPMENT in one of the most celebrated Georgian areas of
Edinburgh is expected to be rubber-stamped today by district council
planning councillors.
Last night, however, the move was being viewed with dismay by the
Cockburn Association, the heritage watchdog which voiced fears that more
developers may move in.
Its secretary, Mr Terry Levinthal, said he was concerned that a
proposed new office building on the south side of Charlotte Square would
destroy an ''outstanding'' conservation area.
He said the square, situated at the west end of George Street, was
about to be considered a world heritage site because of its outstanding
beauty.
''I have already written to the Secretary of State for Scotland asking
him to call in the application, but received no reply.'' said Mr
Levinthal.
''If this is approved by the council, we shall do so again, the reason
being that if he cannot call in this application, how can he approve any
other in Scotland?
''Charlotte Square is such an outstanding example of architectural
beauty that we must say 'enough is enough'. It is one of the premier
sites in Europe and must be allowed to remain so.''

TWO tower blocks, described as ugly eyesores, which have stood empty
for three years can be turned into exclusive managed apartments and an
apartment hotel, members of Edinburgh district's housing committee were
told yesterday.
The committee, with a degree of scepticism, approved #5m proposals for
the Cairngorm and Grampian blocks in Leith, put forward by Muirfield
Glen Ltd.
Councillor Steve Cardownie, who once described the blocks as ''making
Alcatraz look like Buckingham Palace'', said the proposal was worth
considering. Various plans had been put forward for the buildings, which
cost the council #3000 a month for security patrols, but none had come
to fruition, he said.
The council is putting on hold a #950,000 tender to demolish the
blocks.

THE British and Irish Prime Ministers were last night trying to scheme
how to handle a dangerous Unionist reaction to their joint new
initiative on the future of Northern Ireland.
The proposals, agreed by both governments yesterday, will be launched
today, but the Ulster Unionists are threatening non co-operation.
In a dramatic move to reassure Unionists, the two governments have
apparently agreed on an assembly for the Province, on which Unionists
can expect a majority, which will be able to choose whether or not to
join any cross-border bodies.
Mr Major appealed in the Commons: ''The chance of peace that is in our
hands should not slip away because we are not prepared to examine the
matter.'' He said his mind was open to ''the right mechanism'' to ensure
that a settlement was reached which would turn a ceasefire into a
permanent peace.
Last night his appeal and the assembly plan appeared insufficient to
allay Unionist fears. Mr James Molyneaux, who commands nine votes in the
Commons, now vital to the Government, dismissed the proposals with a
grim warning of a possible return to violence. He declared that today's
document could become ''a major part of the problem instead of the basis
for solution''.
One of his MPs, Mr Ken Maginnis, demanded an end to ''this
theoretical, futile debate'' based on the Government's document.
The Rev Ian Paisley and his colleagues emerged from an 80-minute
meeting with the Prime Minister, saying that what is going to be
proposed is a ''poisonous pill'', leading Northern Ireland down the road
to republicanism.
Mr Paisley's Unionists will boycott any talks based on the joint
framework document.
The Cabinet in London took an hour to give Mr Major the go-ahead for
what is to be a massive attempt to maintain the five-month ceasefire and
to point a way forward for a political solution by consent. In Dublin,
Premier John Bruton won the agreement of his Cabinet for the joint
document.
He looked forward in the Dail, the Dublin parliament, to the framework
document, declaring: ''It will undoubtedly challenge the two traditions
on this island: but it will do so in an even-handed way.
''Neither tradition need fear its contents. It is not a blueprint to
be imposed. Its purpose is to facilitate, not pre-empt dialogue.
''At the end of the day, the people of this island, north and south,
will have the final say.''
Asked by Mr Bertie Ahern, the Fianna Fail opposition party leader, why
details of planned changes to Ireland's controversial written
constitutional claim on Northern Ireland would not be incorporated in
the framework document, Mr Bruton said that move would be inappropriate
at present.
Last night the two leaders were dining at Hillsborough Castle outside
Belfast to prepare this historic next step and to agree how they should
handle the Unionists, who were lining up to resist their efforts.
Their problem: how to keep the Unionists on board and negotiating,
despite their public statements. Today this cat-and-mouse game will
develop.
Both Mr Major and Mr Bruton will return to their Parliaments this
afternoon to make statements. The Paisley Unionists will not be in the
Commons because, as Mr Paisley said last night, they do not wish to give
the joint document ''credence''.
Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley issued their own alternative documents
yesterday, vaguely suggesting a different way ahead for constitutional
talks. The Unionist leaders are having trouble with their supporters and
are anxious not to be blamed for any return to violence.
Mr Paisley said at a news conference in Westminster after his meeting
with the Prime Minister that he could reject the London-Dublin document
without perpetrating a return to violence. He said: ''If you want to
know whether war will start again, you must ask the IRA and the
Protestant paramilitaries.''
The Unionists want to block the joint initiative, but they also want
to show willing to solve the problem in their own way.
Mr Paisley claimed that despite serious divisions between the Unionist
parties, they will unite on this issue.
A chief concern of the Unionist leaders is that a proposed Northern
Ireland assembly would not have control of security matters. Mr Paisley
said: ''The security problem is reserved to the Irish and British
Governments.'' He found this ''nauseating'' after 25 years of the people
being bombed and terrorised by the IRA.
Mr Molyneaux is more circumspect. His alternative document hinted at
power sharing. On Monday he and Mr Paisley had a private meeting with
SDLP leader John Hume, which indicated the three of them are beginning
to talk about serious co-operation.
Mr Molyneaux said yesterday: ''The problem is that people assume that
we are daggers drawn, that we never do co-operate. When maybe the
history of the last two or three weeks comes to be written, you will
find there was a great deal of co-operation.''
The actual co-operation at that private meeting on Monday night could
turn out to be exceedingly valuable to the future of Northern Ireland in
so far as the SDLP leader is trying to help the Unionists out of their
difficulties. It is not in the long-term interests of the SDLP or Sinn
Fein, whose annual conference is due this weekend in Dublin, to
undermine Mr Molyneaux, or indeed, Mr Paisley.
What Mr Major and Mr Bruton have to handle today is how to defuse
Unionist alarm. Yesterday Downing Street was insisting: ''The proposals
that we will publish are not going to be carved in tablets of stone.
They are to be used as the basis for discussion and negotiation. We do
not put them forward to the exclusion of all other ideas.''
This was not good enough for the Unionists, who smell betrayal and, in
Mr Paisley's case, are demanding a referendum now on the London-Dublin
document.
Government Ministers, in fact, hope they will eventually carry a
majority of Unionist opinion with them by highlighting that no
cross-border bodies will be imposed on Northern Ireland.
The proposed assembly would be able to choose whether or not to join
any of these bodies the governments consider would be useful to
harmonise policies on subjects like agricultural, tourism, and
professional qualifications.
If the assembly does agree to be represented, then unanimity would be
necessary before any decision could be taken. On a cross-border body of
20 a simple majority of, say, the 10 Republican representatives and
three or four Northern Ireland nationalist members would not over-rule
the Unionist minority.
Ministers are believed ready to reassure Unionists that issues like
foreign affairs, defence and law and order are unlikely ever to be
proposed for such bodies to tackle.
The assembly is likely to be slightly larger than previous Stormont
Assemblies, with around 90 members. Committees would be manned in
accordance with party strength.
In the framework document the Irish Government is expected to express
willingness to drop the words in the Irish constitution claiming the
whole island as Republican territory.
The governments are discussing the possibility of holding referendums
on any final proposals on the same day North and South to prevent one
result influencing the other.
If the delicate negotiating process results in inter-party agreement
on the way ahead, the referendums could be held by 1997, before the most
probable date of a British General Election.
Unionist MPs, while still expressing anger at what they believe will
be in the framework document, are thought by some Ministers to be
feeling their way to accepting co-operation with the Republic on matters
of common interest provided that the freedom of action of Northern
Ireland institutions is assured. It is that which the framework document
seems about to offer them.

SOCCER star Eric Cantona was charged with common assault yesterday
following his kung fu-style lunge towards a spectator during a match at
Crystal Palace.
The Frenchman, who was suspended by Manchester United for the rest of
the season and fined #20,000 over the incident, which was seen by
millions on TV, is due to appear before Croydon magistrates on March 23.
If he is found guilty of the charge, the lowest form of assault, he
could face a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment and a #5000
fine.
Cantona, of Vicar's Hall Gardens, Worsley, Greater Manchester, was
charged when he returned to South Norwood police station, south London,
for questioning.
The media were waiting for the 28-year-old striker when he arrived at
the station shortly after lunchtime in a black Lexus car. He was
accompanied by United lawyer Maurice Watkins and club security chief Ned
Kelly and left for Manchester without commenting after his interview.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ''Eric Daniel Pierre Cantona has been
charged with common assault on Matthew Simmons at the Crystal Palace
football ground on January 25.''
Mr Watkins said the player ''voluntarily attended South Norwood police
station today and he has given a statement to police. He has been
charged and in the circumstances he has no further comment to make at
the moment''.
Television cameras captured Cantona leaping into the crowd after he
was sent off when Palace played United.
The incident -- described by Football Association chief executive
Graham Kelly as a ''stain on the game'' -- did nothing for the image of
a sport embroiled in accusations of illicit payments.
Cantona is to appear before an FA disciplinary committee on Friday.
FA spokesman Mike Parry said: ''We have had no representations from
the police about our own hearing affecting the legal position, so we
will go ahead.''
The French star, stripped of his country's captaincy following the
Palace incident, was said to have been involved in a further fracas when
he attempted to escape the media spotlight on Guadeloupe. He was alleged
to have struck ITN reporter Terry Lloyd, who tracked him down to the
island in the West Indies.
United captain Paul Ince was also arrested and interviewed by police
about the disturbances at the Crystal Palace ground.
A file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service and he was bailed to
return to South Norwood police station at an unspecified date.

THE Minister with responsibility for the Highlands and Islands has
defended distribution of the first tranche of #250m Objective One money
from the EU.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, in a letter to the Labour MP for Western
Isles, Mr Calum MacDonald, said ''ill-informed criticism continues to be
levelled at the method of allocating funds and, also, on occasion some
of the agencies involved in delivering assistance to the area''.
This follows a Herald report which showed that 35% of the first #21m
distributed under Objective One had gone to the Highlands and Islands
Enterprise Network.
In the letter, Lord James says that ''it comes as no surprise to me
that Highlands and Islands Enterprise and its associated LECs should be
successful in attracting a significant proportion of Objective One
funds.
''These funds are fully additional to those which HIE receives through
its grant aid and are spent on local economic development throughout the
Highlands and Islands.''
He goes on: ''I therefore refute any suggestion that the HIE network
may have obtained a disproportionate share of funding or that they
benefit from the location of the Programme Management Executive office
at the HIE's headquarters in Inverness. This is patent nonsense. The
executive serves all the partners and reports through a management board
comprised of representatives from key sectors.''
An economist, Mr Tony MacKay, has criticised what he believes is a
lack of an economic development strategy behind the Objective One
programme.
In MacKay Consultants' Highlands and Islands: Monthly Economic Report,
he writes: ''Decisions are being taken on an ad hoc basis without
sufficient regard to what individual projects will contribute to the
economic regeneration of the Highlands. We believe that some of the
projects granted assistance in the first round of awards would have gone
ahead in any case and others are of limited economic benefit.''
Mr MacKay fears much of the #250m coming from Europe under Objective
One is going to be wasted and the economic aims of the programme not
realised.
''We believe that it needs an urgent overhaul, with particular
attention given to: an effective economic development strategy;
simplified decision-making procedures.
''The Objective One programme is a great opportunity for the Highlands
and Islands. We have wasted a lot of European assistance in the past and
it will be very sad if we make the same mistakes this time.''

A COUPLE whose youngest son died after a road accident have raised
more than #20,000 through a fund set up in his memory.
Mr Ian Burgess and his wife Alison, from New Abbey, Dumfries,
yesterday presented a ventilator to the Southern General Hospital in
Glasgow, where their two-year-old son died in 1993, one week after being
knocked down by a car near his home.
The equipment, which cost #18,500, represents one of the biggest
donations from private individuals to the hospital.
The memorial fund was boosted by proceeds of a charity shop in
Dumfries, local events, and donations from all over Scotland. It has
also given #2000 to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, and #1000 to
the couple's local GP surgery.

UK PORTS will become targets for animal welfare campaigners in a fresh
wave of demonstrations after the collapse early today of EU efforts to
fix new rules on better treatment for life exports to Europe.
Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels abandoned talks still deeply
divided on maximum journey times for cattle, pigs, and sheep across
Europe.
Failure to break the 18-month deadlock is expected to trigger chaos,
according to predictions following the collapse, with militant
protestors now more determined then ever to fill the legal vacuum.
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave emerged from the talks urging
campaigners to remain within the law. At the same time, however, he
called on them to spread their campaign to southern Europe, which he
blamed for the failure of the meeting.
He said he had been unable to accept compromise proposals because they
did not include a satisfactory journey limit: ''We cannot accept that a
12-hour break is a definite end of a journey.''
Efforts to agree new standards and journey times broke down after two
days of talks as deep divisions persisted on the maximum times animals
should be subjected to long-distance transport. Britain, Germany, and
Austria said a French compromise deal did not go far enough, while Italy
and Spain said it placed unreasonable demands on hauliers.
Mr Waldegrave said he accepted the outcome would disappoint animal
rights protesters but he said it was better than a bad outcome.
''I am sure we are going to witness a sea change on this issue but the
change has got to be a legal one. This is not the end of the struggle.''
He said countries in favour of tight controls, including Britain,
Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Holland, would be putting fresh
proposals to the French presidency in time for next month's resumed
talks.
The Minister was not making any predictions about the chances of an
agreement when the talks resume in March.
The French plan had included a concession to animal rights
campaigners, forcing British live exporters to count ferry crossings
when calculating journey limits. Traders had demanded that time spent at
sea be considered ''rest''.
British objections were based on the absence of an overall journey
limit. In other words, long journeys of 15 or 24 hours could be repeated
numerous time as long as a 12-hour break was respected.
Earlier, RSPCA campaigns director Jerry Lloyd had backed Mr
Waldegrave's stand: ''We absolutely must have a fixed journey time
included in any decision.''
The RSPCA and other animal rights groups want a limit of eight hours
for any consignment of animals. If that is too short a time to reach
their destination, they say, animals should be slaughtered at the
nearest possible slaughter house.
* A crowd of schoolchildren who ran in front of animal transport
lorries and sat in the road yesterday were described by police as
''totally out of control''.
Up to 40 youngsters joined the demonstrations in Brightlingsea, Essex,
to protest at the live export of animals to the Continent.
A police spokesman said: ''The children were totally out of control of
the organisers. We completely deplore the use of children in this way.''
Five people were arrested during demonstrations, including a
15-year-old boy.
Port owner Ernest Oliver was reported for alleged criminal damage
after an incident involving an Anglia TV cameraman.

THE German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg yesterday offered to buy and
slaughter all British cattle on its territory to stop the spread of BSE.
It follows a similar move by the neighbouring state of Bavaria. The
offers are part of a campaign to undermine the government's decision to
allow the resumption of imports of some British beef this month, and
follows an EU ruling that British cattle born after 1992 are free of
BSE, ''mad cow disease''.
Six of Germany's 16 states introduced voluntary boycotts of British
beef after Health Minister Horst Seehofer eased restrictions on imports
under pressure from the EU. -- Reuter.
