MAJOR accountancy firms hope Jersey will soon give them legal shelter from
disgruntled UK clients who can drive individual partners into bankruptcy
through court action, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse said yesterday they were both supporting
proposed legislation in Jersey that would enable accountancy firms to register
in the channel island as limited liability partnerships.
This would enable them to register offshore in Jersey to avoid the unlimited
liability to which accountancy partnerships registered elsewhere in the UK are
exposed at present.
The proposed legislation was unveiled in St Helier yesterday and will be
debated in the island's parliament in February. But it will require consent
from the Privy Council in London to become law.
It provides for limited liability partnerships in which individual partners
would only be liable for the value of their own stake in an accountancy firm,
not for their entire personal assets.
``If the proposed Jersey law is enacted it will create a similar opportunity
for UK partnerships as that recently permitted in the USA, where many large
professional partnerships, including the Big Six accountancy firms, have
converted to Limited Liability Partnerships registered in the state of
Delaware,'' said Donald Turner, managing partner regions at Ernst &amp; Young.
``Under current UK law, which dates from Victorian times, partners can be
pursued, quited literally for the shirts or blouses off their backs,'' noted
Ian Brindle, a senior partner at Price Waterhouse.

THE most recent holiday season is one the package tour operators would rather
forget. The second largest, Airtours, is now taking a more optimistic view of
1996, causing its shares to jump 25p to 361p.
This year's heavy discounting knocked profits back 22% to #59.1m in the year to
September, a little less than the 25% reduction foreshadowed. Dividends are
raised 17% to 14p after a final of 11p. The payout is covered 2.5 times by
earnings which fell 29% to 32.6p.
UK profits were more than halved to #20.5m. Fortunately, Airtours had bought a
major Scandinavian tour operator in 1994 and this delivered a good performance,
earning more than the UK side. Booking trends remain encouraging as the local
economies improve.
Airtours is hoping for a similar success with a new Canadian purchase, Sunquest
Vacations, which will help offset the dead winter months in Europe. The
company's current winter books are 17% ahead of a year ago despite Carribean
hurricanes.
During 1995, capacity was reduced several times and Airtours cut costs,
including redundancies. Now it is structuring its operations for total volumes
somewhat below recent levels. Winter bookings are up 4%, in line with the
market.
The Going Places travel agency subsidiary expanded its chain from 548 to 701
and managed a small increase in profits to #7m. The chain is thought big
enough, but more branches will offer foreign currency facilities.
The in-house airline, Airtours International, increased profits on the back of
an enlarged fleet and higher carryings. It supplies about two-thirds of the
group's summer requirements.
Airtours' capital spending picked up, with #102m on fixed assets - two cruise
ships - and #52m on acquisitions, mainly the Canadian purchase and a number of
retail travel agencies.
The opportunity of low rates was taken to borrow #70m from the banks which
resulted in cash balances at the year-end of #304m against #291m.

ALLIED Domecq has confirmed that Sir Christopher Hogg will be taking over as
chairman of the international drinks and retailing group, succeeding Michael
Jackaman as from April 1.
Sir Christopher, 59, was appointed deputy chairman in June this year and his
promotion to the top spot has been widely expected with the only question one
of timing.
He has much to do in restoring internal morale and communicating the group
strategy more effectively to the City.
He said yesterday he had been attracted to Allied because it was a very big and
interesting company and was also in consumer products where he already had
experience.
Sir Christopher became chairman and chief executive of the Courtaulds textiles
and chemicals group in 1980 and will retire next June.
He had been groomed at the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation from where he
was brought in by the late Sir Arthur Knight in 1968. Also on the board for a
time as finance director was Graham Hearne who now chairs Enterprise Oil.
In 1985, the former paratrooper also became chairman of the Reuters information
distribution group.
Allied has had a difficult time lately, in part because of what some put down
to indecision and lack of clear focus until very recently.
Its rating has been hard hit since the #995m acquisition of the Pedro Domecq
brandy and sherry group. That gave it much larger exposure to Latin America so
it was under extreme presure a year ago when the Mexican peso crashed.
The merger of its brewing interests with Carlsberg to form Carlsberg-Tetley has
not worked and there is increasing speculation Allied wants to sell its stake.
There was also City unhappiness over the departure of David Jarvis, who headed
the spirits division, to Ladbroke where he now runs the hotels - he was much
against the Domecq takeover.
Allied shares rose 5!sp to 501p.

BOOK REVIEW
PARADIGM, empowerment, re-engineering. Buzz words are commonplace and these
concepts seem to be the key to becoming a successful company these days. In
reality, all they are is a way of glamorising the obvious. How you title
something is of little importance. How you act is paramount.
McCormack on Managing* eschews fads preferring to speak plainly about how to
get ahead and in so doing demonstrates a candour which is the attribute of many
good managers. Whether or not you agree (as I do) that to handle problems and
opportunities a company should have clear objectives, this book concentrates on
practical ways to handle many a difficult management situation.
In reaching the right decisions in business, knowledge and experience go hand
in hand. Not to make the occasional effort to flick through and learn from a
``handbook'' such as this is an act of laziness tantamount to gross
mismanagement.
Mark McCormack began his career in sports management and sponsorship with just
one client, Arnold Palmer. The rest, as they say, is history.
With 67 offices in 26 countries his company may be slightly larger than Ian
McLauchlan Associates, but I can certainly empathise with many of the
situations he describes! That is why this is such a good book. It may have been
written by someone who has built a successful multi-national empire but what it
says is as pertinent to your local video store as to MGM.
In this time of IT revolution, it is gratifying that McCormack expounds the
virtues of such time honoured principles as . . . work harder than anyone else
. . . stay calm in a crisis . . . and, don't interfere unless you can add value
to the situation. Home truths which seem to have been relegated to the archive
section of today's internet.
Admittedly, traditional approaches alone cannot be the grounding upon which a
management philosophy is built. Any business leader should be able to
communicate a dynamic vision, but success only comes when you have a sound
basis from which to launch it.
The book anchors itself by mapping a route on how to maximise corporate assets
and make best use of personal authority, the sole caveat being that successful
managers keep a clear end objective in focus. A corporate mantra and mission
statement are the blocks from which the race starts, not the finish line.
Compounding experience with good management writing can only be beneficial. As
a businessman it is always comforting to see that how you operate conforms to
what an ``expert'' puts on paper - provided of course it does not lull one into
a false sense of security. Bearing this in mind, the book is particularly good
in explaining how to exploit change - by thinking one step ahead.
In our case, the professionalism of rugby brings a huge market waiting to be
tapped. Staying two yards in front is vital and as part of our approach we
began a structured recruitment programme earlier this year by taking on two
graduates for the first time. This is a key element in our approach to forward
thinking but it does take courage to risk expansion in an unproven marketplace.
McCormack states: ``There are as many snakes as ladders on your path to
success.'' How true. This is why the old Sicilian maxim - keep your friends
close, and your enemies closer - is invaluable advice.
A manager's most difficult job is controlling those who work against him. In
business, no-one remembers the thousand people who sing your praises, rather it
is the one who sticks a knife in your back. All business is cut-throat, hence
everyone's desire to pull on the boots of Machiavelli in order to beat you to
the finishing post. In this regard I particularly like McCormack's advice on
how to use deadlines to get people to do what you want, not what they want.
From exploring how to make smarter decisions, through employee assessment and
reward schemes, to measuring your management IQ, this book is comprehensive and
full of sage advice. Unlike many other business books, it comes without
unnecessary verbiage, and gives short shrift to the fashionable fads which seem
to be so prevalent in management today. It will be as relevant and interesting
in 10 years as it is now.
Throughout my life, in sport as well as in business, I have advocated the
importance of continual learning. Closed mindedness and complacency are a
recipe for disaster. The author seems to agree.

DAVID BELCHER considers the merits of Sleepwalking, a new film made in Scotland
for #6000
MIKE Kelly's Sleepwalking is a tidy short film, made for a minuscule #6000,
which thoughtfully addresses the perennial Scottish problem of what one is to
do when one is faced with the sudden incidence of a corpse in one's bijou pad.
Why should Glasgow's cleansing department be listed among the movie's special
supporters? See Sleepwalking today at either of its screenings at Glasgow Film
Theatre and you'll find out.
Yon much-lauded Shallow Grave, crafted in Edinburgh, was also given dramatic
vitality by a dead body, of course. So how will director Kelly react when lazy
critics make their shallower comparisons?
``Both films feature a body, but Shallow Grave is about avarice - how the
living characters are going to get their hands on the dead man's money - while
Sleepwalking is about naive expectation: two characters who believe that the
body will literally fly up to heaven . . . and when it doesn't, they have to
face grown-up reality.''
Sleepwalking's two central characters, Eva and Alan, are invested with
commendable amoral blankness by Pauline Lockhart and Keith Warwick. Warwick is
well versed in displays of amorality, having acted out the stage role of
blank-eyed Johnny McRotten in the Scottish Sex Pistols for two years.
Despite currently being a member of the Kaisers, a beat combo of much renown,
Keith is set on being an actor. To that end, he and Mike are working on a
script based on their shared schoolboy memories of the seventies. Additionally,
Mike is writing a script about an all-night radio chat-show set in Glasgow.
Like Sleepwalking, it should bring a new kind of life to the graveyard-shift.
n Sleepwalking will be shown today at the GFT, Rose Street, at 3.30 and 6.30pm.

Teachers can
help raise
awareness,
writes
Paula Cowan
CHILDLINE, in operation in Scotland for five years, recently benefited from the
support of schools and Catering Direct, which organised a Childline cookie
challenge. By buying a ChildLine cookie at school, children and staff helped
raise funds for the charity, and ChildLine relies heavily on public donations.
Only 8% of its total funding comes from the Government. Providing a service for
its daily callers is costly - there are around 500 of them. The Cookie
challenge was a means of obtaining funds to keep the vital service running.
This is not the first time that ChildLine has joined forces with educational
bodies. Last year it worked with the anti-bullying team at Tayside region to
provide the technology and expertise for the authority's successful
anti-bullying line.
The free phoneline was set up for children who were either being bullied or
involved in bullying. About 4000 young people made contact in a full year. But
it was discontinued earlier this year when it became a victim of its own
success. A dramatic downturn in the number of calls indicated that it had
served its purpose.
Building on this success, ChildLine is now hoping to launch a national
anti-bullying line in the near future.
Another initiative, ChildLine In Partnership with Schools, is soon to be
piloted. It will focus on awareness-raising among senior secondary pupils, but
it will also contain a fund-raising element. Secondary schools from Strathclyde
and Lothian regions will be invited to take part.
A significant number of callers phone ChildLine at a point of crisis related to
physical or sexual abuse, or bullying. There is a peak in general calls among
13-to 14-year-olds; and a further peak in bullying calls in the 10-to
12-year-old group.
Can schools and/or teachers do any more than they are doing to help these
children? Sandra McDerment, counselling manager at ChildLine Scotland, is well
aware of the teacher's situation. She says: ``Teachers have a difficult job.
They need to address the issue without blowing it out of proportion. They have
to exercise caution as indicators of abuse can indicate other types of
behaviour. In the primary school, awareness-raising is the key.''
Such awareness would enable teachers to maintain a child's perspective of the
situation. Ms McDerment describes this perspective: ``It is often one in which
the child is scared that he or she won't be believed. It is likely that the
abuser has worked hard to ensure that this is so.
``Adult outsiders also tend not to want to believe that any abuse has occurred.
If a child discloses to a teacher, the teacher should support what happens to
the child as a result and see the thing through.
``Irrespective of the subject-matter, the teacher should be there for the
child. The teacher could also help explain to the child what will happen as a
result of disclosure.''
Ms McDerment believes that appropriately-trained teachers could have a key role
in advising children about child protection procedures. ``Schools have policy
procedures which, although well-intentioned, can sometimes leave children out
of control of the situation.
``Children want the abuse to stop. They do not necessarily want the abuser
punished, harmed or blamed in any way.''
Teachers can provide practical help, by striving to ensure that young people
understand that their body is theirs. Ms McDerment suggests that this should
begin at an early age. ChildLine callers include victims who talk about an
abuse that has taken place years previously. Although one may think this
subject matter inappropriate for nursery children, this is not the case. Abuse
often starts in these years.
Secondaries could additionally provide more detail in instruction, as to what
is and what is not appropriate sexual behaviour.
Ms McDerment hopes that once a child has disclosed to his/her teacher, the
teacher would:
q.Continue to accept the child as before;
q.Provide warmth and reassurance; and......
q Make allowances for any disruptive behaviour that follows.
The chances are that at some point in a teacher's career he or she will teach a
victim of child abuse. One study reveals that 35% of identified cases of child
abuse are reported by teachers.
This highlights the importance of schools and teachers. The hope is that by
working cooperatively in a variety of ways, schools and ChildLine will succeed
in giving today's young people a degree of protection higher than that received
by earlier generations.

Supermarkets
mean jobs and
jobs don't mean
just shelf-filling,
says Sue Tranter
SALES may be booming in the pre-Christmas high streets, but the relentless
advance of the often-peripheral supermarket owes nothing to the seasons.
Openings are more and more frequent - and almost always ``on target'',
according to most of the big names in the trolley trade.
Asda has just hung out the open sign on its shiny new premises in Govan, not
far from Ibrox. With family clothes as well as household goods and food all
housed under one roof, the staffing requirement presented a major opportunity
locally with around 500 jobs up for grabs.
The new Asda at Cumbernauld, which opened a few weeks ago, also provided a
similar number of jobs locally.
Safeway is equally keen to advance its presence in Scotland and says that, of
the 17 new stores it is planning to open in Britain over the next couple of
years, a proportion will be north of the Border. Each outlet will generate
around 250 to 300 jobs.
It's a similar forecast for Sainsbury. Two new branches are due to open - in
Hamilton and Straiton, Edinburgh, in February with a around 700 jobs all being
filled locally.
But it's not just out-of-town food shopping that is proving a steady jobs
market. Ikea, the giant furniture store with outlets all over the world, is
finally opening its first store in Scotland with a site already earmarked in
Hillington. Hopefully, recruitment of around 300 staff will begin some time
next year.
Yet there is still a perception that stores and supermarkets are offering work
rather than careers, processing shelf-fillers but not pushing staff on up the
promotion ladder.
``Not so,'' according to Janette Smithson, currently in charge of customer
services in the Govan Asda. ``Staff are positively encouraged to move up under
our Colleague Development Scheme. There is always an avenue for people who want
to go on to a supervisory role.''
The scheme is open to anyone who shows promise. The manager of each department
can put names forward when he feels an employee is suitable and would benefit
from progressing within the company.
Applicants are then given a package to work through which offers them an
insight into how the department is managed. Self-training is part of the
package, allowing those who want more responsibility to take it for themselves.
At the end of their package staff sit an exam and, if they pass, are then
eligible for promotion. Clearly those who want to tread water can do so, but
opportunities for anyone who wants to move up are there to be exploited.
Janette herself is proof of the scheme's success, for she began her own
association with Asda nine years ago, becoming a check-out girl in Carlisle
where she used to live. Since then, she has moved to Kilsyth near Glasgow and,
after working in a branch in Falkirk, recently took over her new job in Govan
with 150 people under her control.
``As a mum with young children, I could see the opportunity for progress
because Asda has always been very flexible towards young women and their
responsibilites,'' she says. Shelf-fillers were actually the final piece of
Asda's recruitment jigsaw at Govan. The local job centre was largely
responsible for providing the right staff and carried out most of the initial
screening. With around 15,000 hopefuls to check out, Janette says the store
were delighted with the work done by the job centre.
``There were already several hundred names on file, the rest were found through
newspaper and radio advertising. Craft workers such as butchers and bakers were
found first and the rest of the jobs were filled in five phases starting in
early August.''
New staff are able to apply for group screening and, after 12 weeks, their
progress is reviewed and their skills looked at so they can be placed in other
departments.
A startling example of how the staff development scheme works for those who
want to move up is Alan Lennie from Clydebank, who within a month of joining as
an hourly-paid warehouseman has been promoted twice to his current job as
grocery supervisor.
After some months of unemployment Alan saw an advertisement for Asda staff in a
newspaper and applied to the Govan recruitment centre.
``I was prepared to take anything just to get a foot in the door,'' says Alan.
His attitude proved spectacularly successful and in a matter of days he had
been promoted to grocery supervisor. By the time the shop actually opened he
was wearing a tie and had become salaried rather than hourly-paid. As a manager
responsible for checking goods inward, he is putting his feet firmly on the
management ladder.
``I think my approach to the job helped, but Asda also spotted my potential and
how it would benefit them. Promotion has made me even hungrier for success and
as I know that management will be watching me, I'll be going all out.
``It has been worth the extra work and the longer hours I have been putting
in.''
Alan now does a 45-hour week but admits that he stays till the job is done.
Part of his time is spent in the warehouse and the rest in the store.
Customer service appears to be the main criterion for all the staff, not
surprising perhaps in such an intensely competitive business.
It's a message that comes across clearly as customers are greeted at the door
by staff wearing ``I'm happy to help'' sashes. Anyone who thinks of a job in
food retailing as a trip down the aisles to nowhere, should perhaps think again.
`Promotion has
made me even
hungrier for
success, and as
I know that the
management will
be watching, I'll
be going all-out'

<HEADLINE>Minister's solutions to cereal price problem fail to impress industry</HEADLINE>

SIGNS of the increasing pressure on the Government to curb cereal prices - now
at a 20-year high - were clearly displayed by the junior Agriculture Minister,
Tony Baldry, speaking at a crops conference yesterday.
However, he was a little short of solutions to the problem of prices almost 20%
up on last year and the knock-on effect on a wide range of products from
biscuits and bread to beer and bacon.
``I do worry about an imbalance in the market and the effects that continuing
high prices have for the consumer and, in particular, the livestock sector. It
really is not in anyone's interest if feed consumers are driven to the wall or
to alternative feed ingredients.
``That is why I make no apology for saying that measures are needed now to
bring cereal prices down. That is why Douglas Hogg pressed the European
Commission at the September agriculture council for the commitment to manage
the market in accordance with the 1992 CAP reform objectives and to ensure
priority supply to the European Union consumer.
He said bringing down the level of land set aside would provide only part of
the answer. Taken together with increased yields, it would probably increase
European production by about 10 million tonnes. But this could just as well be
exported from the EU and would not help by itself.
``It is, therefore, essential that the commission adopt a very cautious
approach to exports until such time as internal market prices return to more
reasonable levels. In this regard, I fully support the measures taken last week
on the introduction of an export levy.''
However, Barclay Forrest, chairman of British Cereals Exports, who was chairing
the annual crops conference at St Ives near Cambridge, was clearly sceptical.
There had been efforts to curb prices over the past three years. This had led
to intervention stocks being run down, he said. Now there was a levy on exports
which seemed to have the effect of dragging up world prices.
``Have you any other bright suggestions?'' he asked, to the accompaniment of
laughter from the audience.
Mr Baldry said the high prices were a result of poor harvests in many countries
and, in Britain at least, because of the devaluations of the green pound as
sterling declined. The commission had released five million tonnes of grain,
imposed a levy on exports, reduced set-aside and, at British insistence, linked
this to market management systems to give priority to EU consumers.
``The 1992 reforms set out very clearly what the commission should do in these
circumstances and we intend to ensure that the commission does honour this
commitment and does so in a fair and even-handed manner. In that way,
hopefully, we shall start to get prices down to the benefit of everyone.''
He said the Government would take every opportunity to press the arguments for
a more market orientated, less costly and less bureaucratic CAP to allow
farmers to respond to the needs of the market and participate in world markets
without restraint.

<HEADLINE>Landowners call for replacement of quotas and set-aside with rewards for `responsible land use' Changing the face of the countryside</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>

PROPOSALS for a radical change in the way financial support is delivered to
farming were unveiled yesterday by the Scottish Landowners' Federation in a
discussion document on the need for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
The federation calls for the phasing out of all supply controls, including
quotas and set-aside, and the discontinuation of all other existing support
schemes.
There would be no compensation for lost quota - a valuable asset for many
farmers but one which was initially received free of charge.
Financial help would then come through a rural land use support scheme designed
to aid a wider range of countryside activities than farming alone, which
attracts EU support of about #330m in Scotland under existing CAP arrangements.
While schemes such as the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances give support
to sheep farmers and cattlemen, the federation envisages a system which would
afford equal status, in terms of support, to shepherds, foresters, rangers,
stalkers and gamekeepers. Payments would be regionally adjusted to meet social
objectives in more remote and disadvantaged areas.
In broad terms, the landowners suggest re-focussing aid away from headage
payments for livestock and support for particular crops. Their aim is to reward
``responsible land use'' on a much broader front including forestry and
sporting activities.
Capital grants would be available for the planting of long-term crops such as
trees and for the repair of derelict housing stock and dykes. The main
principle behind the SLF proposals would be to treat all types of land use
equally. Market opportunities and returns would largely determine the way land
was used, but there would be a need for regional land-use policies within which
managers could develop their own plans.
``By bringing together agricultural, forestry, environmental and rural social
policy into a single programme, it would be possible to deliver a simpler, more
integrated, approach to countryside management than by the present separate,
overlapping and fragmented delivery,'' the report claims.
It goes on to suggest the creation of a Scottish Office rural affairs
department which would cover all aspects of rural policy, including natural
heritage. The consultation paper was drawn up by the SLF's agricultural
sub-committee under the chairmanship of Michael Gibson, who pointed out that
all committee members were working farmers. In addition, 70% of the SLF
membership were involved in agriculture.
The federation does not see the current CAP as being sustainable in the longer
term and regards it as a bureaucratic system which distorts land use and
fossilises both countryside and business.
The strategy outlined in the discussion paper envisages a move towards world
market prices with support provided through area payments (linked to the size
of a particular holding). In addition to size, there would be payments for land
management, environment support, disadvantaged area status and for qualifying
capital projects.
The rate of payment would, however, depend on the level of activity generated
on a holding, measured in ``standard labour units''. The federation suggests
its scheme could be introduced after the turn of the century when the CAP would
be under scrutiny as part of the next round of world trade talks. The
structure, it says, is capable of being applied on a European basis, with
member states determining the proportional relationship between different
levels of support, within an overall ceiling.
Federation convener Graeme Gordon said that the paper represented the SLF
contribution to the current debate on the future of the CAP. ``Our aim is to
encourage flexible integrated land use, within market disciplines, for the
benefit of all users of the countryside, whether they earn their living from
the land, live in rural areas or are visitors to it.''

CALL us old-fashioned at the Diary but we have this idea of the Scottish
Ambulance Service as a body of men, women, and vehicles whose job it is to
provide fast, efficient transport for patients. And, by so doing, save lives
and alleviate pain and suffering.
But no, according to a letter to his troops from Andrew Freemantle, chief
executive of the Scottish Ambulance Services NHS Trust, it's all about
``quality ideas''. In a message catchily entitled ``Policy National Bulletin
4/95'' he urges the ambulance to ``go for gold - or even platinum!''
He also says: ``It is only through an ongoing search for excellence and
innovation that we will achieve our Vision of being recognised as Scotland's
finest public service by the year 2000.'' You might think there is a reasonable
case, here, for a couple of ambulance personnel to administer a sedative to Mr
Freemantle and give him a wee hurl in the general direction of a hospital with
padded rooms.
Amulance service workers are being asked to come up through a ``Quality Ideas
Scheme'' with suggestions on how to improve patient care and to generate
savings. Mostly the latter, we suspect, having read the nature of the awards
planned for the scheme.
There will be five categories, the top being the Platinum Award of ``up to
#5000 or more'' for ``exceptional ideas''. The Gold Award of up to #1000 will
be made for ``major improvement in patient care/ substantial savings or income
earned''.
There are silver and bronze for suggesting ideas producing smaller savings and
a #25 Encouragement Award for ideas which are ``well-presented but not
adopted''.
And yes, you will have guessed, in order to make the whole scheme work, the
Scottish Ambulance Service NHS Trust, now has a Quality Ideas Co-ordinator.
Hidden meaning
MORE about life as it is lived in Stornoway. The Gazette this week carries a
public notice which reads: ``Would the person who buried the sheep's head in
the load of shingles please seek immediate psychiatric help.'' No, we didn't
ask.
Artistic endeavour
GLASGOW'S Festival of Visual Arts '96 will shortly get under way. This
year-long series of events is to celebrate Glasgow's not being selected as
Britain's City of Visual Art 1996. That honour went to Newcastle-upon-Tees or
Stoke Poges or somewhere like that. (Glasgow's decision to have its year of
visual arts anyway is a bit like the SFA declaring Scotland Country of Football
Excellence 1996 but we won't go up that cul-de-sac at the moment.)
A special fund of #100,000 has been distributed to sundry artists for works
throughout Glasgow's Not the City of Visual Art 1996. We are particularly
looking forward to:
q Aquarium by Mark Dawes which will take over an upper floor of the Charing
Cross Tower Hotel. The windows will be illuminated by videos of life-size
swimmers. ``The project is intended as a massive illusion; an entire floor of
the hotel apparently filled with water.'' But don't phone the fire brigade and
report that the hotel sprinkler system appears to have come on accidentally.
q Emily Bates whose recent works include ``distorted dresses constructed from
human hair''. (Bates? The family didn't run a motel, did they?) Emily will be
working with Kirsty Stansfield who will focus ``on the transitory spaces within
the city where people pass through relatively unconscious of their movement and
the material make-up of their surroundings''. No, it's not Sauchiehall Street
on a Friday night when the pubs are scaling.
q Interior Life by Nicola Atkinson-Griffith, an American artist now living in
Glasgow whose last wheeze was to visit people in their homes and persuade them
to donate teaspoons with which a huge chandelier was built. Nicola's idea for
1996 is to ``work with 18 randomly selected families from the city, living with
each of them for a week and documenting their rituals and behavioural
patterns.'' Or, as they call it in Partick, having an awfy nosey ludger.
Raffle mystery
A COPY of a letter circulated by Barassie Primary School PTA is brought to our
attention. It concerns the Christmas raffle and lists some of the many fabulous
prizes including ``Crop Shop cut and blow job''. Perhaps someone from deepest
Ayrshire could explain.
Sales pitch
PURE dead eclectic. That's Peter Irvine's award-winning guide-book Scotland the
Best, published this week in a new 1996 edition. Amid the mass of info on where
to stay, where to drink, and where to eat ice-cream, the author fits in a
recommendation that we should head to Rothesay for a spot of contemplation in
the splendid Victorian toilets.
And that we hie ourselves to the Meikleour Hedge, a 100ft-high beech
extravaganza (``a riot in autumn and serenely green in summer'') which can be
found on the road from Perth to Blairgowrie.
Another, perhaps more useful piece of advice, is contained in the section on
the Best of Gay Scotland. Mr Irvine points out that the Linden Hotel in
Edinburgh's New Town is ``not exclusively gay'' so ``don't be a silly old queen
with the straighter sales reps''.
Taking the prize
CONTINUING our theme about the Fourth Wise Person and what gift he or she might
have taken to the stable in Bethlehem: Tom Nellany of Ardrossan nominates The
Herald's own religious prophet John Macleod bearing a wet blanket in case
anyone enjoyed the First Christmas. For which Mr Nellany wins the Langs Whisky
First-Footing Kit.
Calum MacAulay of Cumbernauld does a bit of biblical fast-forwarding with the
concept that the Fourth Wise Man might be Judas Iscariot with a copy of his CV
and a personal recommendation for a job from Herod. Mr MacAulay wins a bottle
of Langs Supreme Whisky.

Patent deal
for Memory
MEMORY Corporation, the hi-tech company based in Dalkeith, has struck a deal
with patents specialist BTG to protect its invention for correcting faulty
computer chips.
BTG, formerly known as the British Technology Group, will help Memory secure
worldwide patent rights for its invention.
It will also enforce any production licencing agreements that Memory enters
into.
In return BTG will receive up to $1m (#650,00) of shares in Memory immediately
and options to buy a further $1.5m (#1m) of shares after 1998.
The patents protection firm will also receive 1.65% of Memory's turnover in
cash for as long as the open-ended agreement lasts.
Stocking up
NORWEGIAN engineering and shipbuilding group Kvaerner has bought another 4.17
million shares in bid target Amec, raising its holding by 2.1% to 20.14% of the
British oil services and construction company.
King to expand
REGIONAL brewer Greene King yesterday served up a half-year profits jump to
#11m and said it would step up its pub expansions. Taxable profits grew for the
six months to October 15 from #9.8m for the corresponding period last year. The
interim dividend rises to 4.5p from 4.1p from earnings per share increased to
19.1p from 17.5p.
Back seat
ITALIAN car-maker Fiat's chairman Gianni Agnelli is to stand down in a few
months and managing director Cesare Romiti will take over the reins of the
company, a spokesman said yesterday.

ITEM one. At lunch on Friday, a Scottish local authority official was wondering
out loud where his successor council will find the six-figure annual sum needed
to meet the running costs for the area's video-surveillance system next year.
Local traders don't want to know. The police don't want to know. The local
enterprise company says it isn't allowed, under its rules, to revenue fund an
initiative, which, together with more bobbies on the beat, is at the core of
the Government's get-tough-with-crime policy.
As usual, the council looks like being left holding the bill for the running
costs when the music stops. And, presumably, that bill will grow now that
Michael Forsyth, as part of next year's Scottish Office budget settlement, is
offering an additional #4m capital, in the form of challenge funding, to extend
the CCTV cameras to more areas of Scotland.
With the new councils facing a big squeeze in every other aspect of their
budgets next year, we could end up with a phenomenon familiar in both home
security devices and camera speed traps on roads. Lots of boxes. Lots of
warning signs. But no operational mechanism inside many of them to give the
threats real bite.
Item two. On Friday evening, at the Tony Blair dinner in Glasgow, a very senior
Scottish academic rushed up to me in the foyer, excitedly waving a fax under my
nose. It was an extremely strongly worded statement from university
vice-chancellors, in conclave in the south, condemning budget cuts of 31% in
higher education capital funding next year.
The English vice-chancellors threaten they will either have to charge students
substantial top-up fees or cut the number of undergraduates they accept.
Earlier in the day they had heard a senior official from the Department of
Education and Employment in stony silence.
The language subsequently reverberating round the London University senate
house was, my informant gleefully indicated, the bluest of Porterhouse blue.
Will Scotland's university chiefs give similar hostile vent to their feelings
when their funding fate is known?
Item three. For weeks senior Scottish Enterprise executives have been bracing
themselves, after years of virtual standstill budgets in cash terms, for some
really serious cuts next year. Now we know that #33m is to scythed from the
present SE allocation, with Highlands and Islands Enterprise suffering an
equivalent 7.5% reduction in resources.
The Government has already trailed its intention to get more for less money in
the mass training programmes for the unemployed. But if the Scottish Enterprise
network is to protect its other core programmes - like the business birth-rate
strategy, the business-shop network, the commercialising academic science
initiative, and so on - we can expect even greater use of part-time contractors
instead of full-time staff and a more widespread reassessment of the funding of
sub-contract bodies, like local enterprise trusts.
To put a gloss on the surgery in the Scottish industry budget, Mr Forsyth's
industry lieutenant, George Kynoch, chose instead to emphasise the positive in
his official press release, lauding his boss's decision to make ``extra money
available for regional assistance in Scotland over the next three years''. In
1996/97, provision rises from #91m to #105.3m.
That gloss was doubtless intended to give the impression of focused largesse at
a time of serious belt-tightening elsewhere. But it has little to do with
largesse. Regional assistance - which is dominated by the kind of regional
selective assistance (RSA) used to lure the Chunghwa Picture Tube company to
Mossend but also includes much smaller schemes, like regional enterprise grants
- is supposed to be demand-led.
The Government sets out its stall of carrots. If the right projects come along
and meet all the rules, they should, in theory, get their share. RSA is
normally paid out in stages as job creation targets are met. Pushing next
year's provision up by 17% either means the Scottish Office knows, on the
strength of past decisions to back projects, that larger liabilities are
already in the pipeline for payment next year. Or they are pushing up the
provision, in a semblance of measured generosity, knowing full-well that some
of that provision will never have to be raided.
For example, in 1992 the Scottish Office's expenditure plans for regional
industrial assistance in 1994/95 were forecast at #100m. Earlier this year, the
estimated outturn expenditure for that same year, 1994/95, came out at #88m.
With these kind of margins of error, Mr Kynoch's welcome for the ``additional''
resources for regional assistance over the next three years may yet prove
premature.
That is the smoke and mirrors aspect of the annual spending-round ritual. But
it has an all-too-real aspect too. Spending more on this service or less on
that can profoundly affect the quality of all our lives. A funding change can
create jobs. And equally it can take them away. You can doubtless add, from
your own experience - from the arts and the health service, to road building
and housing - countless other people who, annually, wrestle with the
consequences of the way the Scottish Office block grant of some #14,500m is
allocated.
Whether it be town centre security, higher education infrastructure, state
support for industry, or whatever, one man has the singular power north of the
Border to generate all this tension. Once the broad shape of the Government's
spending plans south of the Border is determined, the Scottish Secretary gets
his formula-based share and then decides how to divide up his cake.
I'm not suggesting that Michael Forsyth (or any of his predecessors) starts
each budgetary year with a blank piece of paper. The base load of established
programmes is vast. And new political priorities evolve all the time which
apply both sides of the Border.
But each year, as yesterday, one man disposes, changing priorities at the broad
margin, because his office - uniquely in the UK as at present constituted -
empowers him to do so. If he really is serious about revitalising the Union,
perhaps he could tell us how, short of the home rule he despises, such
remarkable power can be called to some serious democratic account.

DUNEDIN Fund Managers' chief executive has categorically denied that the
resignation-plagued company would consider selling or merging its operations.
Dunedin lost six of its fund managers last week and suffered the departure of
its chairman, deputy chief executive and three other key personnel in October.
The high-profile resignations have prompted three of its US clients to withdraw
their business, which represented $590m (#896.8m) of Dunedin's total $2000m
(#3040m) US portfolio.
The company's turmoil gave rise to speculation that it would almost certainly
succumb to a takeover. Acting chairman and chief executive Eric Sanderson said
those rumors were simply not true.
``I don't know where these stories have come from,'' he said, ``But all I can
tell you is what I've already been saying, which is that we've been contacted
by various interests inquiring as to whether we would be interested in selling,
and our answer to all of them has been `No'.''
Edinburgh Fund Managers was said to have been in talks with the Bank of
Scotland, which owns Dunedin, about purchasing the company. However, Edinburgh
Fund's managing director Iain Watt said his company's queries had been rebuffed.
``We tried to ascertain if it was for sale, and we got the same answer, which
was `No','' he said. ``If it was for sale we would certainly be interested, but
if they are not willing to sell, what can one do?''
Mr Sanderson said staff reorganisation at Dunedin was virtually complete and
the company was back into its normal business routine. ``Our only interest is
in serving our existing customers,'' he said.
Mr Sanderson is chief executive of British Linen Bank, majority shareholder in
Dunedin, and thus inherited the helm of the business after Dunedin's chairman
left in October.
He said it would probably be about another four months before the leading role
at Dunedin was filled.

FIRSTBUS chairman Trevor Smallwood is expecting to be told this week that as
preferred bidder, the company has won the franchise for Great Western Trains in
a link-up with venture capitalist 3i and the existing management of the Welsh
and West of England networks.
But even if its offer does fall by the wayside, the company, which is the
result of a #265m merger in April between Aberdeen-based GRT and Badgerline of
Weston-super-Mare, still has plenty of opportunities to expanding its exposure
to buses. It has a 13.5% UK market share compared with about 15% for Stagecoach.
In the six months to September, it was working hard to integrate and pushing
hard to reduce future on-going costs. Already deals have been struck to buy
1996 fuel at lower prices than in 1995, saving perhaps #300,000 a year, while
there will be a reduction on professional fees and costs of about #1m.
But chief executive Moir Lockwood made it clear there had been difficulties in
the initial stages in communication between Weston-super-Mare and Aberdeen in
benchmarking and setting performance standards for the 23 individual companies.
There has been an improvement in operating margins from 10.5% to 11.1% as part
of the programme of achieving the March 1997 target of 15% before the employee
profit share deduction. That is being achieved partly through investment in new
stock, with some 500 buses being bought for #50m this year as part of a
near-#80m two-year spend.
The existing fleet is some 5600 vehicles with about 14,000 employees.
In the half-year, turnover rose 16% to #174m, all due to acquisitions, and
operating profits by 23% to #19.4m. However, FirstBus had to bear some #5.2m of
reorganisation and merger costs so that after a #1m higher interest charge,
pre-tax profits eased 24% to #9.07m. Happily, interest cover is high at 4.1
times.
The challenge for FirstBus and the rest of the sector is to reverse the
long-term decline in passenger numbers of about 1% annually. That is being
attempted through increased reliability and the introduction of dedicated
bus-only routes and guided busways to achieve higher speeds. These are thought
to be more important to passengers than fares, which are rising slightly faster
than inflation, while the green tinge will soon be added through the first
compressed natural gas-powered bus being introduced in Bristol.
The purchase of the Rider group gave it substantial exposure to the
high-density urban areas of Yorkshire and it seems certain there will be more
concentration of the industry even if the regulatory regime becomes tougher.
The Transport Select Committee is due to report within two weeks on both
self-regulation and the provision of quality.
An interim dividend of 1.6p is being paid. FirstBus shares eased 1p to 143p.

Talking to Dick Louden, Professor David Raffe expands on his view
of a more flexible 16-plus pathway - which is finding some favour
IT IS widely assumed that Higher Still, the Scottish Office's blueprint for
upper secondary education in Scotland - due to be implemented in 1998 - is
about rectifying a situation in which Highers are beyond the scope of a high
percentage of pupils; in which the ``two-term dash'' between August and Easter
in fifth year is too demanding; and in which there is a need to create a
framework for academic and vocational courses to attract equal esteem.
These are the most frequently quoted factors which underpin the thinking behind
Higher Still. However, they do not by any means present a complete picture. The
best critique of Higher Still to emerge so far has been offered by Professor
David Raffe of Edinburgh University in his authoritative paper One System at
16-plus Years, produced under BP's Aiming for a College Education Programme.
He is careful to place Higher Still in an international context. Describing it
as ``arguably the first unified system of post-16 provision in Europe'', he
defines a unified system as one which ``seeks fully to integrate training with
education, and vocational with academic study''.
While nearly all other European countries are attempting to bring training and
education closer by increasing the proportion of the curriculum that is common
to both and providing more pathways between them, they are also maintaining
separate academic and vocational tracks. By integrating the tracks at school
level, Scotland is going it alone.
How has this become possible? Professor Raffe links it to two recent national
developments......
l.In 1991 Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise was set up
to oversee training in Scotland and to provide ``Scottish solutions to Scottish
needs'';
l.In 1994 training policy, previously framed for the whole of Britain by the
Employment Department and other agencies like the Manpower Services Commission,
was devolved to the Scottish Office.
There is therefore much more scope now ``for Scottish-level policies to link or
integrate education and training''.
But there are potential obstacles. The 22 local enterprise companies will now
have to set up liaison with a whole set of new education authorities under the
reform of local government which takes place next year. There is also a risk
that national moves towards institutional autonomy - colleges are now free of
local authority influence and all schools will enjoy greater control of their
affairs under devolved school management - could ``hamper further
collaboration''. However, these are challenges which can, and must, be met.
Recent pioneering initiatives in higher education have shown that flexible
structures for academic and vocational education can work. Scotvec's advanced
courses (Higher National Certificates and Diplomas) have been transposed into
modular form. This has made it easier to link them to degree courses. Likewise,
the national scheme of credit accumulation and transfer arrangements (SCOTCATS)
``provides a single ladder with a variety of entry and exit points and offers
students the flexibility to vary the pace of study, to leave and re-enter the
system, and to transfer between institutions''.
Professor Raffe foresees Higher Still offering ``a similar and connected
framework at the non-advanced post-compulsory level, with a flexible boundary
between the two levels''. In other words, if its potential is fully realised,
Higher Still could greatly extend the pathways open to all students and the
timescale available for study.
Professor Raffe goes on to explain why this new approach is necessary in
national economic terms. Staying-on rates at school (nearly 80% now continue
after fourth year) have risen continuously since 1980. Rates of entry to higher
education have now risen well above 30% and could reach 40% by the end of the
decade. Against this, school-leaver entry to further education has not
increased and ``growing proportions of post-compulsory students and trainees
are in education rather than training and are studying full-time''.
National deficiencies in the area of training are very worrying. This country
is locked into the so-called low skills equilibrium, in which ``different
social and economic institutions...... reinforce each other to produce a system
in which individuals, firms and government all have weak incentives to invest
in skill creation''.
On top of that, training policy has been ``driven by unemployment rather than
employment needs''. LECs have had to devote too much of their budget to
unemployment relief rather than training. The history of training, since the
New Training Initiative of 1981, ``may be interpreted as a failed attempt to
find a simultaneous solution to the problems of quality and quantity in youth
training''.
Lamenting the low political priority accorded to training, Professor Raffe
points out that this is reflected in a weak demand in the labour market for
vocational qualifications at intermediate and lower levels. On the other hand,
there is a strong demand for HE qualifications, including HNCs and HNDs......
``When employers recruit young people with qualifications below HE level,'' he
says, ``they often value academic qualifications (as indicators of potential)
more highly than vocational qualifications (as indicators of competence).''
These pressures for ``academic drift'' cannot be removed by a unified system
like Higher Still on its own, but it would assist greatly by seeking to
transform the problem through a new approach to the curriculum. There is thus a
pragmatic case for seeking ``to enhance vocational elements within the general
education sector, and for promoting a more integrated curriculum across all
sectors of education and training, rather than continuing with yet more
attempts to develop a separate strong vocational track''.
Professor Raffe does not believe that the success of Higher Still is
guaranteed. He emphasises that it must be seen as a ladder rather than a race,
with students able to climb to their highest levels of achievement, starting
from different points on the ladder and climbing at different speeds, with the
post-compulsory phase requring more than two years for some students.
It must not be only qualifications gained in S5 and S6 which matter and there
must be changes ``not only in attitudes and expectations, but also in funding
arrangements and in the willingness of HE and employers to recognise
qualifications gained over a long period''.
His was the best critique: Professor David Raffe of Edinburgh University who
describes Higher Still as `arguably the first unified system of post-16
provision in Europe'

NO Pain No Gain will be wondering what the chasing game is all about when he
lines up for his third race over fences in the Bet with the Tote Novices' Chase
at Folkestone today.
Josh Gifford's seven-year-old was brought down at the first on his debut over
the larger obstacles in the race won by Large Action at Uttoxeter and then fell
when well clear at Fontwell. On the latter occasion, Philip Hide managed to
remount the gelding after the twelfth fence, then stage a remarkable late rally
to go down by just a length and a quarter to the fortunate Candle King.
A clear round here would be an ideal education before No Pain No Gain gets some
very strange ideas about what it takes to win a race. He does not lack ability
over fences and, judged on the balance of his hurdling form, should not be
unduly bothered to dispatch these.
Lorna Gail, who made a pleasing introduction when behind the classy Hebridean
and King Lucifer at Worcester last month, looks the biggest danger.
Inculcate ran a cracking race when two lengths second to Zephyrus at Warwick
and was nothing but a real disappointment when failing to justify even money
favouritism at Windsor last time. However, not all horses take to Windsor's
figure-eight track and it is worth giving Colin Weedon's four-year-old another
chance in the Levy Board Handicap Hurdle around the more conventional track at
Folkestone.
Happy Hostage, a half-brother to Quick Ransom, looks potentially a cut above
his rivals for the Lympne Novices' Selling Hurdle. John White now trains the
former Mark Johnston runner and he has just one piece of jumps form to take
into this race - a distant sixth to Greenway Lady.
However, he needed the run there and, if he can save for the end of the race,
some of the speed which saw him pick up three Flat races over a mile in 1994,
he could outclass these rivals.
q EDWARD Gillespie, the official in charge at Cheltenham on Saturday, could
face discipinary action over the late abandonment of the Tripleprint Gold Cup
meeting.
The Jockey Club's director of racecourse services, Tony Goodhew, yesterday
called for three reports into the cancellation. He has ordered statements from
Gillespie, the acting clerk of the course for the day, David Stoddart, chairman
of the stewards who called off the meeting, and inspector of courses Neil Wyatt.

THE parting shot was typical, a roomful of listeners straining to hear where
the tapering-off saxophone note stopped and silence began so that they could
applaud. Iain Ballamy has never been a wham, bam, thank you, Ma'am merchant,
never been slick, never been a salesman. But there's a friendly persuasion
about his banter that continues into his music.
Ballamy emerged a dozen or so years ago like a breath of fresh air. Into a
London scene, where every saxophonist wanted to be Michael Brecker, came
someone who was happy to be himself. And so it has continued. Scarborough Fair
(yes, that one) may have been notionally a distant cousin to Coltrane's My
Favourite Things, but the soft soprano tone and execution, following unexpected
but carefully negotiated paths, were entirely and typically Ballamy.
Typical, too, was the breadth of material, from the solemn, almost Wesleyan
This World to the tongue-in-cheek tango dedication to Roland Kirk, Rahsaan.
Like Kirk, Ballamy will never conform to jazz's living museum music syndrome,
although this current band is perhaps his most conventional. It is also the
first in which Ballamy has had to play the elder statesman, a factor which
caused him some bemusement.
At 20, pianist Richard Fairhurst is contributing some remarkably mature pieces
to the band's repertoire, including the highly detailed and mobile work from
whence comes their collective name. Yet even he can give five years to drummer
Tim Giles whose confident propulsion and at times cheeky emphasis was matched
by a sympathetic accompaniment to that parting shot, Ballamy's reverent homage
to Duke on Sophisticated Lady.

IF, AS I've always insisted, live theatre relies on a combination of the
physical, the visual and the verbal, that it needs to be looked at as much as
listened to, then TAG Theatre Company's rehearsed reading of Diane Samuel's
play should have been a theatrical failure. Six actors, together with director
Tony Graham, sat in a semi-circle in a bare black space, Graham filling in the
stage directions and the one concession to physical staging a division of the
stage into ``past'' and ``present'' time zones.
That the hour-and-a-half-long reading provided a deeply moving,
thought-provoking and thoroughly compelling dramatic experience just proves me
wrong, bearing testament to the power and skills of Samuel's writing, and to
the actors' committed performances.
The piece follows the story of Eva, a German Jewish kinder, sent to England by
her parents at age nine to escape Nazi persecution. Switching with carefully
structured fluidity between timescales, it tellingly juxtaposes scenes between
the young Eva and her natural and adoptive mothers, with the present-day
relationship between the grown Evelyn (Eva's summed name) and her own daughter.
By doing so, Samuels widens the play's themes and impact well beyond the
specific instance of Operation Kindertransport delving, at times painfully,
into the nature of mother-daughter relationships, issues of abandonment,
separation and identity.
The dark and irrational emotions tied up in this complex area of the psyche are
given a further mythical dimension through the ever-present figure of the Rat
Catcher, looming menacingly over the narrative.
It's a play which avoids simplification without sacrificing clarity, which
delivers its emotional clout without sentimentality. It deserves to be seen.

<HEADLINE>Panel makes no comment on Granada</HEADLINE>

THE Takeover Panel refused to comment last night on complaints that Granada had
made over the proposed disposal of assets by Forte, as part of its defence
strategy against the former's #3300m hostile bid, writes ANDREW WILSON.
However, a panel member said shareholders would have to be consulted whenever a
material disposal did take place. That is judged to be when assets totalling
10% of the total or contributing 10% of profits, either individually or in
aggregate in each category, are to be sold off.
But there is an additional element in that when a ``jewel in the crown'' is put
up for sale, that too may require shareholder assent.
Granada would argue that the 68% Forte stake in the Savoy is in that category,
particularly as both Lord Forte and son Sir Rocco have invested so much effort
and money in building it up over the past 14 years.
Granada shareholders are meeting this morning to decide whether to approve the
takeover.
A major fund manager who has been a long-term supporter of Granada's Gerry
Robinson said last night he was not convinced Forte was the right business for
Granada to buy. Running hotels is very different to running TV rental or
broadcasting firms, he said, and the Granada share price had come back
justifiably.
He added he was concerned that another conglomerate might be on the way and
typically would get so far and then just begin to struggle.
The problem for the fund manager is that the Forte share price would almost
certainly fall back again in the event of Granada losing, so the instinct may
be to sell in the market. But selling now would miss out on a possibly higher
Granada offer, although if that did occur he would almost certainly sell rather
than wait for additional Granada paper.
The shares firmed 2p to 636p to value each Forte share at 324.6p on the
part-share, part-cash terms compared with the 321.67p cash alternative. Forte
shares were 1p easier at 337!sp.

THE latest producer price figures have provided the strongest evidence so far
that inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector have begun to abate.
This helped to revive expectations in the City of a reduction in interest rates
after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George, meet tomorrow.
Share prices took heart from the speculation and the FTSE-100 share index
gained 22.1 points to 3652.1. The pound made up some lost ground, and its
trade-weighted index rose 0.3 points to 82.8. There was widespread talk that
the Chancellor would engineer a quarter-point cut in base rates to 6.5%.
But Adam Cole, UK economist at stockbroker James Capel, said: ``The Treasury's
3% growth forecast and 3.5% consumer spending growth forecast make an interest
rate reduction look difficult to justify, and we feel the Chancellor will wait
for further evidence that these growth rates are unachievable before pressing
for rates to come down.''
The broad measure of factory gate prices rose by 0.2% last month, the Central
Statistical Office said yesterday. The annual rate fell back from 4.4% in
October to a lower-than-expected 4.3%. The surprise lay in the downward
revision of the October rate from a previously stated 4.6%.
The core measure, which excludes the food, drink, tobacco and petroleum
industries, also increased by 0.2% last month, and the annual rate declined
from 4.7% in October to 4.6%. The October figure was originally stated at 4.8%.
The historical revisions were at least as significant as the changes between
October and November. In the core index the rise in the latest three months
over the previous three months was equivalent to an annual rate of increase of
3.4%.
This points to a marked deceleration in factory gate price inflation in the
next few months. Paper and pulp prices still show the highest inflation rate
(16.7%), followed by base metals (7.7%) and plastic products (7%). But computer
equipment prices are falling by 4% year-on-year while precision instruments
(0.3%) are barely rising.
Input prices, which measure industry's fuel and materials costs, fell by a
seasonally adjusted 0.1%. The annual rate dropped from 7.7% in October to 6.2%,
its lowest rate since August of last year. It should continue to retreat as
last year's big increases in commodity prices fall out of the annual comparison.
Mr Cole said: ``The rise in factory gate inflation through the course of this
year may still leave scope for disappointing RPI (Retail Price Index) data in
the very near term, but this is unlikely to last beyond the early months of
next year.
``While there is nothing in today's figures to prevent a base rate reduction
after Wednesday's monetary meeting, we still feel early next year is a more
likely time for a rate cut.''
David Walton, senior economist at investment banker Goldman Sachs, said the
figures should help pave the way for lower interest rates in coming weeks.
``While the chances of a base rate cut this Wednesday are fairly evenly
balanced, we continue to expect a 1% drop in rates by mid-1996,'' he added.

POSITIVE interim results and promising signs for the future helped Dunedin
Enterprise Investment Trust achieve a 27p increase in net asset value per share
and a 6.7% rise in interim dividends in the six months to October 31.
The Edinburgh-based trust, which specialises in funding management buy-out
teams, increased its interim dividend to 1.6p from 1.5p during the same period
in the previous year.
Nav per share was up 14.1% to a record 219p. That figure compares favourably
against the trust's benchmark, the FTSE Small Cap index, which recorded only a
10.1% increase in the same period.
Trust manager Brian Finlayson said investment returns from the #2.1m sell-off
of shares in engineering group Domnick Hunter and the #1.8m sale of bus company
Walter Alexander helped boost the trust's interim results.
``When Domnick Hunter went on the market (in March 1994), the company was
valued at #2 per share,'' he said. ``Now we are selling those shares at #3.24,
so yes, it's been a very good stock for us.''
In November, the trust provided #2.25m to support the management buy-out of
fuel distributor Cawoods of Northern Ireland. Mr Finlayson said the deal, which
is the largest it has ever made, reflected the strength it had achieved as a
result of the fund doubling its size during the past two-and-a-half years.
He added that it was working on another deal comparable to the Cawoods
investment. That should be completed by the end of January.
Enterprise Investment Trust, which has emerged unscathed by the mass
resignations in other parts of the Dunedin Fund Managers group, anticipates
earnings increases from its concentrated portfolio will further boost year-end
income and asset value figures.

LAST week Lord Mackay of Clashfern became Britain's longest-serving Lord High
Chancellor this century, quietly overtaking Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone in
the survival stakes. To last eight years, and more, in the post is tribute to a
man's energy and resilience. The Lord Chancellor is head of the English
judiciary, architect of law reform civil and criminal, and Speaker of the House
of Lords. These are heavy briefs.
In addition, he has much ceremonial activity; the post is perhaps the most
ancient in government, and in precedence he is outflanked only by the
Archbishop of Canterbury and the royal family.
There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth in the English legal establishment
when Lord Mackay was appointed, but a good deal of this hostility has been
dissipated by the character of the Lord Chancellor himself.
When I first met Lord Mackay, in April 1987, it was outside the Free
Presbyterian Church in Edinburgh, in that faintly seedy area where Bruntsfield
verges into Tollcross. He introduced himself to me, after the prayer meeting,
and reminded me that he was due shortly to speak at our youth fellowship, in
the Free Church, on the Christian's role in politics.
Lord Mackay was now a Judge on the Bench of Appeal in the House of Lords,
having quit as Lord Advocate three years previously. A Sabbath evening or two
later, at the manse where the fellowship met, we had worship, and then he spoke
for 20 minutes - seated, fingertips lightly pressed, meditative - and we asked
him various obvious questions.
The evening still haunts me, for two reasons. One was a question I put myself -
for no apparent reason; I knew nothing of the storm then gathering in the Free
Presbyterian Church. We had been discussing the abortion issue, and I asked if
this - in the field of law and society - was a field where evangelical
Protestants might, for greater impact, profitably liaise with the Roman
Catholic lobby. ``Well, yes,'' said Lord Mackay. ``In the political arena, real
achievement is what you pursue, not standing on dignity'' - or words to that
effect. But I have never forgotten, either, the impression of Lord Mackay
himself.
He was very - ordinary, the best word I can think of. There was a great
simplicity and dignity. He exuded humility. And real humility is something you
never, ever encounter in men and women of achievement.
Such are driven people; ambition, in this world, calls for focus, ruthlessness,
a sweeping arrogance. I have met many great men; some were, in truth, good men,
but all had this edge of superiority, of satisfaction.
So I still think. But Mackay didn't. All the honours heaped on him, the great
heights he had reached and would reach yet - these he accepted as privileges in
providence. He had, I think, the mind of a servant. And in prayer - and I heard
Lord Mackay pray several times; I once even heard him preach - he knew the
friendship of God; he knew God intimately.
Lord Mackay was a holy man, one of the holiest I have ever known, and in all
that has since come to pass I have tried never to forget it.
In October 1987 he became Lord Chancellor. I saw him a week or two later - it
was the Friday night of the Edinburgh communion. What only a handful of folk at
that service knew was that, in the autumn of 1986, Lord Mackay - who had been a
communicant member of the Free Presbyterian Church for 40 years, and an elder
for nearly 30 - had attended a memorial service, a Requiem Mass, for the late
Lord Russell of Killowen. A little group in the church already strove to bring
him to account.
In November 1988, he was suspended from office and membership by the Church's
Southern Presbytery. After months of rising hysteria the suspension was upheld
by the Free Presbyterian Synod in May 1989. Lord Mackay resigned his eldership
and membership at the Church split. It was, in all his career, the one blow
that truly hurt him, hurt him to the core.
It was an appalling episode - one that scarred all, of any conscience, who
lived through those months - and the damage is apparent to this day, in divided
families and scattered congregations and broken relationships. It also came
perilously close to ending Mackay's career; by the time synod voted, assorted
Roman Catholic bigots in high places were already baying for blood. Had he not
resigned, had the Lord Chancellor retained any connection to the Free
Presbyterian Church, his position would have been untenable.
The real issue, of course, was not that Lord Mackay had gone to Mass -
something against which the Free Presbyterian Church has borne emphatic witness
throughout her history - but that he refused to undertake not to do so again.
And the real battle was not over Lord Mackay, but over who ran the Free
Presbyterian Church - its conservative hierarchy, or a rising revisionist group
centred on the Northern Presbytery. They lost and they left, to form the
Associated Presbyterian Churches, which Mackay has never joined.
The rights and wrongs of all this we may leave aside for now. And we may also
ignore the practical achievements Mackay has wrought in public office - though
they are real and significant. He has brought, I think, things more intangible
than that to public life.
For one, absolute integrity. Those who work with Mackay, in Cabinet and
elsewhere, need fear no intrigue, no indiscretion, no guile. For another,
profound wisdom. This is a man who knows that the world is a complex place,
that issues in the context of real law and statecraft abound in falls and
traps, that so much of Christian achievement in public life cannot be to
advance good but to minimise evil. The world in its sham and squalor must be
addressed as it is.
And, when Government Ministers have been subsumed in scandal - adultery,
corruption, errors of judgment - I sometimes fancy they have gone to his door
and poured out their hearts to him, in pain and shame and guilt.
He has never forgotten what it feels like to hurt, really hurt, in the venom of
a poisoned fellowship. He has never forgotten, I dare say, the little church in
Lairg, or giving out the line, or Sinclair in fine form on a Sabbath evening.
But somehow, I do not think we will ever know. There will be no memoirs, no
autobiography, no settling of old scores. Lord Mackay will take these things
with him, behind his quizzical brows, free from the picklocks of biographers.

EDINBURGH
``WILL you help Gwen look after Arthur?'' Merlin's question is greeted by
hundreds of tiny voices - and not a few adults - yelling YES!
``Even though it's very dangerous?'' says Merlin, with gentle gravity. And
there's a pause . . . and a few quavering responses before the troops rally and
promise positive allegiance. Because, you see, we have since the curtain rose
come to believe in the powers of darkness.
We have heard Morgana-le-Fay's lickerish tones coo out promises that sound like
threats. And threats that sound like promises most certain to be kept. And we
have seen fire leap from her fingertips . . . Really, fire. Which is unsettling
whatever age you are.
Come to that - even the tinies know that the darkness is rising. It gets darker
earlier and earlier coming home from school . . . And though teachers and
parents have told us this is make-believe, some bits ring uncomfortably true.
Like Kay - what a Neanderthal sumph - and his brutal bullying. Everyone has had
a Kay to contend with sometime. Or Lady Baffy (Victoria Hardcastle) nagging Sir
Hector to lose weight and smarten up. (You should hear the muffled giggles and
see the looks that pass between some couples here.)
And herein lies the spellbinding skill of Stuart Paterson's children's play,
which I notice he has tweaked slightly for this revival. Into this mystical,
medieval legend he has spirited recognisably everyday things. Rooted fantasy in
the ordinary, made the commonplace shimmer with curious possibilities. Best of
all, he proves that unlikely people - you, or your chum maybe - have magic in
them if they need it.
When everything seems to have gone chaotically awry - Morgana (a lasciviously
vicious Irene MacDougall) has Arthur in her clutches, he will never free
Excalibur from the stone, the world is doomed to fire, war, and pitiless
darkness - a wee girl, Gwen, saves the day.
She simply refused to give up on Arthur, because he is her best friend and she
cares bunches about him. And even if Merlin (Michael Mackenzie coming on like
some mythic warlord) hadn't given her a magic ring - ``Hold it against your
heart and wish for a true friend'' - she would still have pegged on through the
evil forest with its deceiving helpers, like the falsely bright Mrs Eery-Cheery
who leads her off in the wrong direction. Gwen's magic is her loyalty and her
courage. It's in fact a very ordinary magic but it can do extraordinary things.
On stage this uplifting message is done up in fast-moving adventure action,
lots of robust comedy capers - Tony Cownie's Kay and Eric Barlow's Sir Hector
are a hilarious double-act - while the magic is given an elemental flavour, as
if the forces of nature were themselves in opposition.
Malcolm Shields's Face - Morgana's henchman - slithers like some malign Ariel
after Arthur (Billy Boyd) and Gwen (Pauline Lockhart) but is finally persuaded
that goodness and kindness are a better path to freedom . . . Brilliant
story-telling that looks exquisite and is underpinned by a score of tinkling,
tingling appropriateness.

THE Sleeping Beauty is a bit like Hamlet. Not a lot happens in the middle.
Stuart Paterson has solved the problem in his new version of the story, written
specially for Northern Stage, by turning it into an odyssey.
Paterson, as most people now know, likes to go back to the original myth, a
Bruno Bettelheim approach which is a blessing for parents who can sit there
quietly metaphor spotting while their offspring get on with the serious
business of barracking the wicked witch.
His Margarita is the very opposite of the usual passively sleeping princess, a
sparky young thing not at all about to drop off for 100 years at the mere prick
of a wicked witch's spindle.
It's refreshing that when this thoroughly modern heroine finally almost comes
to harm, it's by her own hand. And since it's the wicked witch's below-stairs
world which she almost finds more alluring than her own, rather boring
above-ground one, we can feel nothing but sympathy for her.
For despite Paterson's best efforts, the old problem remains, that a
whiter-than-white, pearls-and-diamante fairy godmother hasn't got a snowball in
hell's chance of being more interesting than a flouncing, jet-laden, long red
finger-nailed wicked witch, especially when that witch flounces to perfection
like Jacqueline Phillips.
Angela Lonsdale plays Margarita with a spirited charm, but her prince, Giuliano
Neri, despite a promising beginning as a Johnny Depp lookalike, never seems to
muster that same wholehearted enthusiastic innocence that a show like this
requires.
Ian Johnstone's music though is a joy from the first electronic baroque chord
onwards, as too
are the exquisite sets by director/designer Neil Murray, which stir memories of
old-fashioned pop-up Christmas cards.
Paterson has co-opted aspects of several other fairy tales to keep up the pace.
This princess has no time to sleep. But I couldn't help wishing she had. The
plot seemed overcrowded to me, and in its determination to keep bounding along,
surprisingly cool and passionless.
It didn't seem funny enough either. The bear and the visiting princes just
weren't enough. Somewhere along the line, I missed the stock pantomime
characters which Paterson so dislikes, just like I missed the cobweb-covered
sleeping palace, the creeping briars and, yes, God forbid, that climatic kiss.
Not so the audience of 10-year-olds with whom I saw it though. They loved it.
n Sleeping Beauty is at New castle Playhouse to January 6.

I STILL remember my feelings of shock and delight the first time I saw this
particular Stuart Paterson. Cinderella, you see, doesn't marry the Prince - or
sweep off in some glass coach to a castle where indulgent dreams come true
thanks to skivvies like her former self!
No way. For this Cinderella has a sudden searing epiphany: she realises that to
the Prince - who has only seen her in her magical finery - she represents a
covetable possession, not a real person with flaws and foibles. And when she
keeps vanishing from his grasp of a midnight, the need to find her and keep her
takes on an obsessive quality.
Rarely have the impassioned words ``mine, she must be mine'', sounded so
chillingly devoid of love as when Paul Caputa's Prince is storming from pillar
to post in pursuit of his dream princess.
So where does the happy ending lie? Why, with Callum the kitchen boy - think of
Buttons, now add in intelligence and an independent, fighting spirit - who has
seen Cinderella struggling with adversity, not always gracefully, and loved all
the more for it.
Differing shades of love and loyalty - everything from self-love to a pride in
following orders that almost ends in disaster - are found throughout the entire
narrative. And time and again, there are instances of good intentions going
horribly wrong - the scheming Claudia (Carol Ann Crawford) gets her greedy
hooks into Cinderella's dad only because the girl believes he is lonely and
remarriage would bring love back into both their lives . . . What it brings, in
fact, are the step-sisters, Claudette (Caroline Devlin) and Claudine (Meg
Fraser) who are a right pair of scunners.
Think of Violet Elizabeth Bott. On speed. Now double that dreadful thought and
you will have some idea of these minxes' powers of persuasion. To be gainsaid
is to tantrum! Mind you, one look at Claudia and you can see where they get it
from. Carol Ann Crawford - in turbulent red locks and dark glowing drapery -
has a manical edge to her . . . and a cackle that would curdle the milk of
human kindness in all but the most stalwart.
Luckily Louise Montgomery's Cinderella has a determined streak as does Callum
(Kenneth Harvey). Alexander West's Sergeant Puff - the soft-centred tyrant of
the kitchen - is a regular source of merriment, for Paterson is always careful
to have outbursts of vulgarity and daftness amidst the magic and adventure.

Stirling
``ANOTHER Stuart Paterson, is it?'' said Ofpants, the official panto watchdog,
from amidst his Scottish schedules. ``He's really the opposition, isn't he?
Mind if I tag along? Academic interest. Research. That sort of thing . . .''
Perhaps Ofpants's curiosity had something to do with the MacBob's decision to
switch from traditional panto to children's theatre this year. It's a decision
which, I feel, reflects the problems that panto sometimes faces when the
audience regularly includes quite young children.
Paterson's plays, with their tapestry of high adventure, broad comedy,
heart-squeezing emotions and magic - good as well as evil - encompass much of
the same territory as panto, but the emphasis on dramatic story-telling seems
to engage a really wide span of ages without anyone feeling that some bits are
either beyond or beneath them.
This Snow Queen (directed by Richard Baron) is certainly dramatic! Eve Keepax,
garbed in folds of gleaming, sequined white, gave this malevolent majesty a
mystery that was part velvet, part steel. By her side, Kern Falconer's Cobweb
Spider, all cranky-creaky so that he too shifted: at times utterly ridiculous,
then suddenly sinister. Their growing power is, of course, boosted by the
fading sun - here personified as an African magician, Bhima (Okon Jones).
And then, of course, there's Kay (Craig Fraser) and Gerda. His big-headedness
makes him suitably vulnerable to the icy splinters of the Snow Queen's cruel
mirror. Gerda's big-heartedness makes her the only one who can redeem him from
freezing into inhumanity. Vicki Liddelle's Gerda has a lovely brightness to
her. She's plucky - but she has her moments of despair, making her a very
believable heroine.
Happy kids laughed, yelled out as required, and then fell silent as the story
gripped them as surely as the Queen gripped Kay - until Gerda's tears freed his
heart, and everyone gulped in relief. Including Ofpants! ``It's very like
panto,'' he started to say, ``only . . . different''. I'm sure the word better
would never cross his lips even if it had briefly crossed his mind!

OFPANTS - our official panto watchdog - reminded me three times that this was a
7.15pm start! The student panto has acquired a talismanic feel to it, you see,
and OFPANTS doesn't like to miss out on it. For no matter what story they
choose to tell, these final-year DDA students tend to tell it with a freshness
and a sense of personal enjoyment that hasn't been in any way tarnished or
diminished by the rat-race of the professional circuit.
This year's saga was Sinbad the Sailor - a simple tale of rescuing a kidnapped
princess that cheerfully meandered in and out of various situations for a
goodly three hours . . . and didn't lose one Brownie to boredom on the way!
Between them, John Morley's script and Peter Lincoln's direction have come up
with so many bright twists on traditional gambits that it would be hard to
chuck any of them aside.
There's a thoroughly polished ensemble feel to this show: the choreography is
lively and well done, as is the singing - and folk don't just mooch around like
peasant nonentities, they put some zip into being citizens of Constantinople or
natives of Nervana. (The band's recurring riff at the mention of Nervana grew
into a brilliant running gag.)
Praise, too, for the many principals. Chris Young as Dame - especially for his
sharp take on our Cilla. Gillian Forshaw as Sinbad - she doesn't overdo the
dashing derring do, but she has a nice chumminess about her and her strong
singing voice is well matched by that of Iona Carbarns as Talida.
Really well charactered, and in danger of stealing much of the show, however,
was the love-hate relationship between the evil Sinistro (an urbane,
world-weary Leslie Brand) and the sweet princess of Julie Dalkin. Marvellous
special effects, as well - check out the Roc bird which descends from a great
height.

IN the past few years restaurants have become better managed and better value
for money. This, coupled with an increase in the number of women in work, has
led to a rise in the number of people eating out.
Pelican Group, whose brands include Cafe Rouge and the Dome, has been a major
beneficiary of this trend.
Its success with its neighbourhood French restaurants offering value for money
in a relaxed setting has encouraged it to open branches outside the South-east
of England, initially in Birmingham but now all over the UK.
In the six months to September 30, nine Cafe Rouges opened, including sites in
Glasgow and Aberdeen. These are said to be trading well despite competition
from the likes of Pierre Victoire and Pizza Express. A new Cafe Rouge site is
under development in Edinburgh. There are 91 in existence with a further 10
under development.
The smaller chain of 10 Dome bars and eight Amalfi family restaurants also
traded well. Despite all the expansion taking place in the first half, with
almost one restaurant opening per week, Pelican Group became the first
restaurant chain to win an Investors in People award.
First-half profits were boosted by these new openings and the prolonged hot
summer weather which benefited those cafes with outdoor seating. Overall, group
profitability jumped by 124% to #3m, with City analysts forecasting annual
profits up 74% to #7.5m. Sale and leaseback deals helped gearing to end the
period at a comfortable 15%, well below the company's target ceiling of 25%.
Now that all the brands have reached a critical mass and have been proven in
the marketplace, chairman Roger Myers sees scope for rolling the Dome and
Amalfi nationwide. Evidence so far suggests that opening a Dome in the same
locality as an existing Cafe Rouge does not harm sales.
The emphasis in the coming year will be on maximising the return from existing
restaurants and a slower opening programme, predominantly outside London in
smaller towns in affluent areas. Although there is nothing in the pipeline,
Pelican remains on the lookout for potential bolt-on acquisitions.

THE direction of interest rates and the extent to which they are likely to move
is usually more important than the precise timing of any change.
One snag in the marked trend towards more open monetary policy-making is that
speculation about rate changes focuses on meetings, like tomorrow's between the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England, Thursday's
Bundesbank council, and next Tuesday's US Federal Open Market Committee.
Rate cuts in the UK, Germany and the US are widely expected. Indeed, financial
markets are anticipating that they will take place. But the $64,000 question is
whether the cuts will materialise from the latest batch of monetary meetings.
A better-than-expected set of producer prices data yesterday was seized upon by
the bulls of lower interest rates as a justification for an immediate
reduction. But with retail price inflation yet to peak, the figures were hardly
the most obvious trigger for easing monetary policy.
Both the Treasury and the Bank of England assess all the data available to them
before making up their minds. The weakness of the case for an immediate cut in
base rates lies in the Chancellor's forecast of 3% growth next year, based on a
3.5% increase in consumer spending.
If that is what Mr Clarke thinks is going to happen, why on earth should he
press Mr George to concede a cut in rates? This is a powerful argument which
the lower rate bulls who make up the majority of City pundits have not been
able to counter.
There seemed to be some back-tracking among this breed yesterday with much of
the speculation suggesting that rates would only come down by a quarter-point.
Another variation was that if the two men agreed to cut rates implementation
would be held up until after the meetings of the Bundesbank council and the
FOMC. But both of these are just as likely to disappoint the bulls as are the
UK authorities.
If Mr Clarke and Mr George dash hopes of rate cuts this week while they wait
for further evidence that the economy is cooling to the point where the
Treasury's forecasts are unachievable, attention will switch to the likely
outcome of subsequent meetings in the early months of next year.
Perhaps the most important consideration for the financial markets, the
business community, and the public at large, is that there is now a general
expectation that rates will be cut by a full 1% over the next six months.
Thrills/spills
MARKETING as it does one of the pleasures of life, the travel industry is
nothing if not optimistic by nature, though the fearsome ups and downs which
characterise it mean that its managers have to be thick-skinned.
This year's season saw a glut of holidays on the market as a combination of
doubts over the economy and fine weather at home persuaded people not to go
abroad this time. The overcapacity prompted heavy discounting which battered
already slim margins. In the case of Airtours, operating margins dropped back
from 6.6% to 3.8%. UK-based operations fell to just 2.6%.
The industry has reacted by cutting capacity for 1996 and David Crossland, who,
while having none of the flamboyance associated with the travel business, is
one of its shrewdest operators, believes overall capacity has come down by 14%
which will take it back to the level of summer 1993. This should enable margins
to recover somewhat, though the days of the relatively fat levels seen in 1994
are probably gone for good.
However, there is no sign of the punters coming back yet. By the end of October
bookings were running 26% below a year earlier, though a mild autumn hardly
gave much incentive to book a holiday in the sun. Another factor was that the
tour operators released their 1996 brochures later than usual.
The real test will come in the new year when people start perusing the
brochures in earnest. Mr Crossland is optimistic and certainly if the weather
is as cold over much of the country as it is now this will certainly encourage
people to book.
The worry is that if bookings do begin to take off the industry will be tempted
to add on capacity again. But for the moment there is a good chance of a
cyclical upturn.
Airtours is spreading its wings internationally to reduce volatility and the
latest results would have been worse but for its new Scandinavian business. Now
the group has a stake in the Canadian market which is counter-cyclical with
holidaymakers escaping the tough winter, and intends to expand further in North
America.
All this will help improve quality of earnings, though the holiday trade will
always have its thrills and spills.
Openness
THE Bank of England is thought to be considering the publication of regular
survey reports on manufacturing and service industries from its appointed
agents around the UK.
These go to make up the national reports it employs in assessing its economic
priorities and strategy for the UK. There is just one agency for Scotland,
based in Glasgow.
It is understood no decision has yet been taken, but if the Bank was to give
the go ahead, publication would probably start early next year. This would mean
an addition to the current reports which cover different areas of the UK, such
as those from the CBI and Chambers of Commerce.
Up until now none of the Bank agents' surveys have been for general publication
and in most people's minds the Bank is clearly associated with Threadneedle
Street in the City of London, hence the sobriquet ``The Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street''.
Introducing the reports to the general public would certainly be an indication
of more openness and would help people to understand how it forms its views on,
for example, which line to take over interest rates. Whether or not this meets
with the Chancellor's agreement is a different matter.
On the other hand, it would mean yet more reports for the financial markets to
get excited about, particularly coming from such a source.
Undoubtedly there would at times be more conflicting evidence, something Mr
Clarke might well do without. And the Bank would probably have to extend the
number of agents who gather their information from a network of industrial
contacts. Not only would it mean the Bank becoming more visible but it would
also mean greater accountabilty.
Certainly the plusses would seem to outnumber the minuses, at least from the
Bank's point of view.

<HEADLINE>RETAILING Allders reports #2m decline in annual profits</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974929952</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
By NICOLA REEVES
HIGH Street trading remains difficult for many retailers among them Allders,
the department store and duty-free group.
Continuing poor consumer confidence coupled with much higher costs associated
with opening sites in Paris and Copenhagen led the group to report a #2m drop
in annual profits to #23.5m.
Allders had expected opening costs of #1m but in the event they turned out to
be #5.2m partly due to having to outsource some of the business.
Allders chief executive Harvey Lipsith said he was ``disappointed with the
bottom line we've delivered''. However he remains confident that the group has
the right pieces in place ``to deliver the results that we would hope for.''
At the operating level profits were slightly ahead of last year helped by a
rates rebate. Acquisitions contributed #1.5m to profits although this was
offset by losses in start-up operations in airports in Paris and Denver.
Earnings per share were hit by a higher tax rate and the exceptional charge.
The department store business reported lower profits of #11.2m compared with
#13.2m previously. Although sales were up 2!s% in real terms there was a change
in product mix towards lower margin goods such as audio and multimedia TV
products, perfumes and cosmetics. One fifth of the selling space is new or
refurbished.
Within the international duty-free business, Allders reported strong sales
growth notably in the second half. Its new and refurbished shops in Gatwick
South and on board the cruise ships Oriana and QE2 all performed ahead of
expectations. Overall, European sales grew by 25% but profits were slightly
down at #11.8m reflecting a lower incentive payment from the UK airport
operator, BAA. The terms of the incentive payment which is turnover related are
currently under negotiations.
The North American business made a loss of #1.3m versus a previous #1.6m profit
with much weaker than expected trading at the new Denver airport.
Australasian profits were boosted by an acquisition in New Zealand.
During the year Allders commenced operations in five more countries taking its
total to well over 100. Mr Lipsith remains confident about the group's long
term potential despite the proposed abolition of duty-free retailing in 1999,
believing that at most only 20% of group turnover will be exposed.
The financial position of the group remains very strong with gearing of 35% and
interest cover of 25 times.
The Allders trading statement disappointed the City and the shares dropped 21p
to 168p. The six week period up to and just after Christmas is a crucial
trading time for Allders. It will publish a post-Christmas trading statement in
mid-January.

<HEADLINE>Hot summer and slack housing market hit carpet sales but franchises prosper Richards remains in red</HEADLINE>

RICHARDS, the Aberdeen-based carpet and yarn manufacturer, only seems to do
well selling other people's products.
The company's new carpet franchising venture and its contract furnishings
business were the only bright spots in yet another gloomy set of results.
Richards had hoped to break into profit during the year to September 30, but it
ended up with a pre-tax loss of #1.1m.
The exceptionally hot summer hammered carpet sales that were already depressed
as a result of the slack housing market. Production costs were, meanwhile,
pushed up by a 150% rise in the cost of polypropylene fibre.
``We were desperately disappointed with the second-half performance,'' said
chief executive Ray Dinsdale.
The group has shut down a number of factories over the past five years, cutting
its workforce by half to around 1200. But more surgery may still be needed
before it returns to financial health.
The Spence Bryson shirt and handkerchief factory in Northern Ireland remains
firmly in the red and the future of the Portadown plant and its 190 employees
is now in doubt.
``The shirts business is currently making a loss and it's under review. I am
not going to say more than that,'' Mr Dinsdale said.
The cost of closing two other factories led to a pre-tax loss of #4.9m in
1993-94, despite an operating profit of #813,000.
But last year Richards even made a #482,000 loss at the operating level.
To be fair, this was mostly due to the high start-up costs of Floor Coverings
International (FCI), a successful carpet franchising business which was
launched in March.
Franchisees sell direct to households, using a video simulation to show
customers what the 2000 carpets on offer would actually look like in their own
home.
``It has moved very quickly into profit. It's a much better performance than we
would have dared to predict,'' Mr Dinsdale said.
The problem is that FCI mostly sells other people's carpets.
So too does the moderately successful high quality contracts division which
provides carpeting and curtains for new homes sold by major housebuilders.
Its sales have been helped by the fact that many builders are offering free
carpets and curtains as an inducement to homebuyers instead of straightforward
price discounts.
Richards realises that cutbacks alone will not revive its fortunes and is
promising to unveil a new strategy soon aimed at reviving business.
``It involves moving into new markets, but also a strategic alliance and more
verticalisation,'' Mr Dinsdale said, refusing to be more specific.
Richards pledged its faith in a brighter future by holding the final dividend
at 0.93p, leaving the full-year payout unchanged at 2.03p.
Sales picked up in September as soon as the heatwave ended and the group traded
profitably in October and November, but Mr Dinsdale remained cautious about the
prospects for the rest of the financial year.
Richards shares closed down 3p at 38p.

THE most surprising feature of Haydn's Surprise symphony on Sunday was the
absence of the famous drum thwack. Had someone discovered it to be inauthentic?
That would certainly be a surprise, but what was performed, in fact, was J P
Salomon's genial reduction of the score for flute, piano, and string quartet.
Far from sounding like economy Haydn, the result was often quite fascinating.
More than do other performances, it demonstrated that the surprise in the slow
movement is cleverly anticipated by the accents of the tune itself which made
it, in this performance, all the wittier.
There were also some lovely flute descants in the minuet, though the loss of
the loud drum-roll in the finale - frankly a more exciting Haydn effect than
the one in the slow movement - was inevitably a pity.
The rest of the programme - one of the SCO's Edinburgh series calling for just
a handful of players - rang the changes on the timbres of flute, strings, and
harpsichord. If James Clark's account of Handel's D major violin sonata, Op 1,
No 13, lacked real Handelian radiance, his playing of three Purcell fantasias
with other members of the group did not fail to convey the kaleidoscopic
intensity of this music.
The quicksilver moods of Rameau's Pieces de clavecin en concert were likewise
adroitly caught, and Ivor Bolton - who, with the cellist Ursula Smith, formed
the concert's principal binding factor - brought additional shimmer to a pair
of Rameau's harpsichord solos.

<HEADLINE>Strong demand ensures National Grid shares sell for instant profit as transmission network floats ScottishPower set for #20m bonus</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>21</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974929955</RECORDNO>

SCOTTISHPOWER should realise a profit of about #20m from selling its shares in
the National Grid today.
ScottishPower acquired Manweb's 4.9% stake in the electricity transmission
network in England and Wales when it purchased the Chester-based electricity
company in October.
But it teamed up with North West Water to sell 181 million National Grid shares
in a placing for institutional investors as soon as the power transmission
network was floated on the stock exchange at 209p yesterday.
The joint offer, which closes at noon today, is likely to rake in about #160m
for ScottishPower and #200m for the Warrington-based water company.
City analysts said there was strong demand for National Grid shares from funds
that track the FTSE-100 index, but the placing shares would probably sell at a
5% discount to the spot market price.
``I would be surprised if the placing was any more than 200p per share,'' said
Bill Dale, an electricity analyst at broker SBC Warburg.
ScottishPower contributed 81 million shares to the joint placing, while North
West Water provided 100 million.
National Grid, which until now was owned by the 12 regional electricity
companies (RECs) in England and Wales, moved straight into the FTSE-100. At
current prices, the company has a market capitalisation of #3600m.
ScottishPower acquired its stake in National Grid when it took over the
Chester-based REC Manweb earlier this year. North West Water acquired its 8.2%
share by purchasing Norweb, which supplies power to North-west England.
Although ScottishPower is selling its grid shares immediately, the water
company is retaining 38 million to sell at a later date.
All 12 RECs have promised the Government they will dispose of their National
Grid shares within a year.
Seven RECs, which together own 53% of National Grid, are distributing their
grid shares to their own shareholders. An eighth REC, Southern, is expected to
do the same.
But the grid shares of the four other RECs, which have all been taken over by
other companies, will be sold on the open market.
Electricity customers in England and Wales will also benefit from the grid's
privatisation through a #50 one-off payment early next year. But Scottish
consumers will not receive a payout since ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro
Electric own the transmission network in Scotland.
ScottishPower will realise a profit on its sale of National Grid shares because
it valued them at 174p when it launched a successful #1130m bid for Manweb in
July. It will sell the shares for about 200p - about #20m more than it had
conservatively provided for.
``It's icing on the cake,'' said one delighted ScottishPower official, pointing
to the bonus as further evidence that the Glasgow-based company had bought
Manweb on very favourable terms.
ScottishPower is expected to announce plans for reorganising Manweb today.
These will probably include further job cuts to reduce costs and improve
efficiency as the two electricity companies become integrated.
The main impact of the sale of the National Grid shares will be to reduce
ScottishPower's debt gearing. This soared to more than 100% when it acquired
Manweb, but should fall to 75% by the end of the financial year in March.
ScottishPower and North West Water decided on a joint sale of shares to get the
best value for them. ``It is just the price efficiency that we are getting by
working together,'' the ScottishPower official said.
Despite the windfall gain from the National Grid sale, ScottishPower shares
closed down 2p at 367p, while North West Water gained 1p to 589p.
National Grid ended its first day on the market up  !sp at 209!sp, but analysts
were divided on where the share price would go from there.
Ian Graham at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh said ScottishPower and North West
Water were wise to sell now because the outcome of a price review by the
electricity regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, would hang over the
shares for the next 10 months.
The outcome should be known in September. Mr Graham pointed out that even if it
is favourable to National Grid, the 12-month period for RECs to dispose of
their grid shares would expire soon afterwards and the prospects for selling
might be clouded by the proximity of a General Election.
But Andrew Stone at Daiwa was more upbeat. ``There are some bears out there who
think the price will go below 200p, but there is a body of opinion, including
ourselves, that thinks 230p to 240p is not an unreasonable price,'' he said.
Regardless of how the price moves, privatisation has left the National Grid
directors sitting on a gain of more than #1m. Chairman David Jefferies' 374,000
shares are now worth more than #780,000, while finance director John Uttley
could sell his 124,000 shares for #260,000.
Grid directors are also in line for special dividends linked to the flotation
worth a further #432,000.

MERCURY European Privatisation Trust, one of the trusts most widely held by
private investors, is claiming a sector first, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
It is proposing to buy back its shares in an effort to reduce their discount to
asset value.
It aims to raise up to #86m by issuing Preference shares and use the money to
purchase Ordinary shares through the market. This should reduce the discount by
providing a steady demand for shares and by reducing the number in issue. If
the full number of Preference shares are issued the trust will have 16% gearing.
Mercury European Privatisation and the similar trust from Kleinwort Benson
struck a chord with private investors who had done well out of the UK and they
took in more than #1000m in their offers for sale.
However, this was before the 1994 market downturn and the shares have never
properly recovered.
In addition, privatisation in continental Europe has not been accompanied by
the ideological fervour it has had in the UK and industries were not sold at
give-away prices.
However, Lough Callahan, managing director of Mercury's investment trusts, is
hopeful prices may become more generous because governments have to raise funds.
Mercury European Privatisation has performed satisfactorily in terms of asset
value, out-performing its benchmark. But the discount on the shares has been
above average, currently 15%. It is hoped it will now narrow as a result of the
buy-back plan.
n A RESURGENCE of new issue activity saw 20 UK and Irish companies join the
official list of the London Stock Exchange last month, four times October's
figure.
The largest new UK listing was New Burford, a property company which joined the
market on November 27 with a market capitalisation of #302m. The smallest new
issue was Ernest Green and Partners, a property agency which made its market
debut valued at #4.7m.

IN Paris there was once a fabled director of Maxim's, who enjoyed almost half a
century of staging menus as elaborately as any opera. In his time Roger Viard
remembered the days when Maharanis washed their strawberries in Dom Perignon,
when Callas would fall into ectasies over second helpings of Pot au feu, and
when, in their traditional corner of the main dining room, the wizened Windsors
would sit in peeved togetherness, ordering their game blue-rare.
Much to Viard's regrets the guests towards the end of his tenure at the
restaurant took to wearing false noses and gaudy hats. ``It is not Maxim's that
has changed,'' he would sigh. ``It is the whole world that has altered. There
is a lot more vulgar wealth about.''
Viard might well have had Mr Loutish Diner in his sights, for here he comes
again, the figure of Christmas Present, throwing money down his gullet and
pestering the waitresses with salacious wassails and gropes.
There should be a clause in catering contracts which urges sexually harassed
waitresses to sue riff-raff sophisticates. But, of course, there isn't because
those who stand and serve for a living have little redress against any kind of
injustice, least of all the public's bad manners.
And even if they did, who would carry the most clout - the customer with the
fat wallet or the person paid little more than croutons to dance attendance on
the first? On the whole, young seasonal waitresses are not pouting Lolitas, and
neither do they possess the calloused experience to fell Mr Loutish Diner with
a verbal blow. That was always the duty of the vintage waitress, before she was
carried off by ageism and varicose veins.
Tough as a laminated worktop, she was among the marines of the service sector,
taking a special pride in being faster with the put-down than the grub.
Her locale was anywhere, from an old Glasgow cafe to the Soda Fountain at
Fortnum and Masons, but she was at her truculent finest amid the musty reek of
cruets in those dismal restaurants where with a shove from her elbow she would
enter by one door, exit by another.
Most women are trained to observe. Almost from birth they are taught to watch
men and note what pleases them. The vintage waitress learned a variation -
after a lifetime's schooling she knew how to confront. How could it be
otherwise, stuck as she was with all those boats of scummy gravy, and woeful
pineapple chunks?
Today she recalls those days when the coffee, poured from a dribbling pot,
would slurp into a saucer and some toff would raise his eyes in scorn and bawl:
``Do you know who I am?'' She couldn't give a tinker's curse who he was, for
the very simple reason that she believed the most obnoxious people, after the
rich, were those who actually pandered to the rich.
Of course, even in the grandest hotel those who wait often stir one another's
indignation, like a sauce being brought to the boil. Haloed by the sizzle and
glow of her culinary mission, Delia Smith may be the saint of common sense, but
the professional kitchen, for the most part, is a war zone of scalding egos.
Just now, even in the starriest hotels, a wholescale pogrom may have broken out
in the kitchen over the rights of waiters v chefs. Who knows what accidentally
ends up in the cassoulet? Last year a waiter had the top of his little finger
bitten off in a fight.
Demanding more money for less on the plate is also the festive trait of grand
restaurants at this time of year. But there is another type of stinginess
afflicting the temples of haute cuisine. Increasingly their clientele itself is
committed to obsessive leanness in the cause of longevity, and sometimes you
wonder if such neurotic faddism won't lead to posh fleshpot extinction.
But not a bit, it seems. Whether they touch their food or not, those who wish
to be fashionable will always desire to be seen in the most distinguished
restaurants. Rich men, with their young beauties bobbing and nodding beneath
ethereal hairdos, intend to go on living to be a hundred, sustaining themselves
on gourmet threads of shredded carrot.
Yet what sacrilege, Roger Viard would doubtless mutter, as the pommes cocottes
are returned to the kitchen without so much as a fork having been raked over
the top. And his knowing old eyes would rove over the dining room, noting that
today, more than ever, sugar daddies are the artificial sweeteners of life.

How can parents help relieve the trauma when their offspring study for major
exams? JOHN CUSHLEY has some suggestions
IT is coming to that time of year when those parents who have youngsters in the
later stages of secondary school come close to tearing their hair out - if they
have any left, which is doubtful if they have gone through the ``Why aren't you
studying?'' scenario before.
It is even more frustrating for those adults who recall their own time-wasting
at the same stage and are, therefore, determined that it will not happen with
their offspring.
It is at this stage that you wish that, instead of inventing means of getting
to the moon, our scientific gurus had come up with the Time Machine used by Dr
Who. That would save us wasting all those words of threat and encouragement.
All we need do is whirl the malingerers a few years forward and show them the
``fruits'' of their lack of labour! Unfortunately the ``Why do today what can
be put off until next week?'' attitude persists and many of our ``students''
are adept at convincing themselves that tomorrow will never come, never mind
next May/June.
It is essential, then, that the basic principles of good study habits - little
but often - are established as priorities in the programme of prepartion. This
is particularly important for the S4 students since this will be their first
experience of external national examinations.
They face the added pressure of having to have coursework assignments ready to
go to the Scottish Examination Board before the end of March and it is all too
easy for them to get into a crisis situation by letting it all pile up. The
idea of coursework for the Exam Board will, in itself, be something new for
many parents. This element was introduced to the Standard Grade and Revised
Higher courses to allow youngsters to show the quality of their work throughout
the session and not depend on their performance on examination day alone.
It is an excellent idea, particularly for those who suffer from exam nerves or
have a bad day on examination day, but it does put a lot of responsibility on
them to take control of their learning and organise the production of the
necessary evidence. Many class teachers will confirm that this proves to be
very difficult for a significant number of young people and is beyond quite a
few.
The crunch time comes in January when those behind schedule find themselves
being chased for work by a number of departments and it can only become a very
stress-filled peiod for some staff and pupils alike.
Schools and local authorities have been doing a great deal of excellent work to
help in this area. Many schools offer significant help through Study Skills
units in their Social Education programmes. At appropriate times pupils learn
how to use libraries and databases to enhance their research skills. They will
be made aware of the different reading techniques such as scanning and
skim-reading which are helpful in both taking and reviewing notes.
These are vital skills to have in the gathering and organising of material and
evidence for coursework. Added to these is the increasing use of IT resources
to produce the final package in a much more attractive style.
Of course the problems are also addressed in many schools by using the
admirable Supported Study initiative to assist pupils, especially those from
economically deprived areas, to manage their curriculum demands. By providing
the twin supports of a quiet room and teacher input, the process of preparing
the assignments has become less of a worry for many.
But few would argue that attending Supported Study is enough. The classes do
not go on all through the session and, even when they are on, it is for three
nights a week at most and only for a couple of hours.
If you have seven or eight S-grade subjects to cover, around 20 minutes three
nights a week is not going to guarantee that you will do as well as you might.
A lot more needs to be done away from school and this is where support and
understanding in the home comes into its own.
There are certain basic points about study methods which parents must have
knowledge of if they are to be a help and not a hindrance in the struggle. I
say struggle because that is what it is for many of our youngsters who are
tempted by a wide variety of more attractive ways to spend their time than
having their face stuck in a book!
Given this, one of the basics of parental support is the acceptance that
effective studying means having time to relax built into the programme. This
serves two vital purposes - the student will not feel that he/she is missing
out on absolutely everything that is ``cool'' and that mental burn-out, when
the brain is so swamped with data that nothing is registering, will be avoided.
The first issue to be negotiated then is the Study Timetable. All students
should give careful consideration to their subject spread and make sure that
all subjects are allocated reasonable time on this. There will be some subjects
that they feel warrant more attention than others and that is fine, but the
available time must cover their whole curriculum.
The time should be spread between homework, coursework assignments, the
revision of notes and other subject specific activities such as learning
vocabulary or historical dates. Regular time slots should be allocated to
leisure every evening and, although not all of the weekend can be regarded as
``free'', there should be some significant breaks such as Friday night off as
well as large sections of Saturday or Sunday.
It is also worth noting that this study timetable requires ongoing revision
depending on ``Schedule'' results, school reports and common sense. As the term
progresses and deadlines approach, the balance between study and leisure should
widen and the Easter break should not be regarded as holiday time by any
student who is seriously intent on doing the best he/she can in examinations.
Another basic need for the serious student is a place where it is possible to
concentrate. Obviously, it is not a good idea to attempt to do revision and
learning in the same room as the rest of the family and/or the television. This
is one area where adults can show their support to the student by making
arrangements, if necessary, to ensure that space will be made available for
them to work without distraction.
Having said this, many older people find it strange that youngsters will insist
on studying while listening to their personal stereo. This can be an area which
leads to arguing and it is perhaps better to ask the student to consider trying
to study with, then without, the music and afterwards to make a reasoned
judgment about which is the most productive. Any attempt by adults to take
control is likely to be counter-productive and may even play into the hands of
a bored student desperate to find an escape route.
Even if this were not an issue, it is likely that there will be periods of
tension and we can help a lot by recognising this and being ready to arrange a
deliberate change in routine by organising a surprise treat. Help can also be
legitimately offered by acting as a sounding board, critical friend, or even
proof-reader in appropriate circumstances.
In some instances, help can be offered in the preparation of coursework
although it must be noted that the actual work must be the student's and only
typing or word-processing help can be given. It might be, of course, that a
mini-recorder which could be used to prepare for speaking assignments in
English or Modern Languages would be much appreciated.
So to recap, some main points for adults to remember in households where there
are youngsters preparing for their first attempt at national examinations are:
l.Be supportive in your attitude;
l.Discuss and support the Study Timetable idea;
l.Insist on adequate leisure time;
l.Make an appropriate study space available.
l.Be prepared to help where appropriate.
l.Avoid being critical.
l.Be ready to give praise whenever possible.
Hopefully, as time marches on and examination day comes closer, the joint
effort will have brought the student to the What more could we ask for?

<HEADLINE>Report highlights hidden problem of over-the-counter drug addicts</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974929960</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has a hidden drug addiction problem which affects all kinds of people,
can cost them almost #200 a week and involve them in hundreds of miles of
travel.
But they are not breaking the law - for the drugs are non-prescription
medicines available over-the-counter in any chemist's shop.
The extent of the scourge is revealed in the first annual report of Over-Count,
a voluntary organisation offering free postal help, information and support to
people hooked on over-the-counter drugs.
Ex-policeman David Grieve, who launched the service, said yesterday: ``I hoped
to gain perhaps 40 clients in the first year. Instead I have been inundated
with desperate letters seeking help, from every region in the UK and even
abroad.
``To date, I have been contacted by more than 1600 clients and I believe this
is only 10% of the total. What I thought was a minor drugs problem is only the
tip of the iceberg.''
Mr Grieve, a father of two, from Dumfries, was hooked on cough linctus for more
than 10 years. It cost him his job, his home and an inheritance - and almost
ruined his marriage.
He underwent a successful de-toxification programme and started Over Count as
part of his recovery therapy. He pays most of the expenses for the service out
of his own pocket.
The report, based on a study of 1000 addicts, shows that dependency affects
people irrespective of age, sex, class or location.
The most affected groups are from Central Scotland and Greater London - mainly
women aged 25 to 45 and men between 40 and 50.
They spend up to #100 a week on the medicines - and because they can't keep
going back to the same pharmacists, fork out up to another #75 a week
travelling to other parts of the country to buy their favourite medicine.
A few regularly travel more than 600 miles from their home.
Men go mostly for opiate and ephedrine-based cough and cold linctuses while
women prefer cocaine-based analgesics.
The report says the treatment offered to over-the-counter addicts at drug abuse
centres is ``well-intentioned but haphazard and ineffectual due to a lack of
knowledge and of an established programme''.
The report says most of Over Count's clients have consulted their GPs and drug
treatment centres without success.
It adds: ``Most them feel all the current anti-drugs campaigns are geared only
to give treatment and help to people addicted to heroin, cocaine, amphetamines
and alcohol.
``This specialised over-the-counter addiction has to be addressed and
acknowledged at once by the Department of Health and by the medical profession
at the highest level.''
Over-Count is campaigning for a printed warning label on medicines and for a
national de-tox programme tailored for over-the-counter addicts.
Meanwhile, Mr Grieve has complained to the Independent Broadcasting Authority
about a commercial promoting Smith-Kline-Beecham's brand of ``All-in-One''
cough-cold treatment. He claims it is ``unethical and irresponsible''.
It portrays a hockey player, in goal, sneezing and coughing during a game. A
``Beecham's Man'' appears with a bottle of the mixture and spoons it into the
player's mouth. As he becomes alert, a voice-over statement says his cough and
cold are now better.
Mr Grieve said: ``No advert should show or infer that any sporting performance
can be enhanced or treated by taking any medication, especially during a match.
In my view it is in breach of the Advertising Code of Conduct.''
He said the medicine's ingredients include the generic drug Phenylephrine
Hydrochloride - a decongestant known as a sympathomimetic or stimulant.
Mr Grieve said:``It is listed as a banned substance on the latest prohibited
drug lists issued by the Sports and Olympic Councils' Doping Tests and Control
Units.
``So a professional hockey player taking a dose of All-in-One during a match
would be in breach of the Sport Council's anti-drugs rules.''

<HEADLINE>New extension to M8 ends nightmare of tailbacks</HEADLINE>

THE new M8 extension, designed to ease traffic congestion for drivers coming
into Edinburgh from the West, got off to a flowing start yesterday, even during
evening rush hour.
Thousands of cars in thick fog successfully manoeuvred their way for the first
time along the new four-mile route that links the M8 directly to the city
by-pass just after five o'clock last night.
Herald journalists checked the road just after it opened yesterday morning and
also joined the late-evening commuters making their way into Edinburgh from the
West.
On our first trip we found that the new extension was taking traffic away from
the notorious Newbridge and Gogar roundabouts, which had catered for 58,000
cars a day before the extension opened.
There was only a handful of cars on the stretch of road between both
roundabouts that runs past Edinburgh Airport. The Scottish Office hopes the new
extension will halve the number of cars and lorries using that part of the road.
During our rush-hour check the new road allowed us to get to the city by-pass
without any hold-ups.
Ending the Newbridge roundabout nightmare made our journey quicker and we were
impressed by the signposting on the road.
Meanwhile, two stretches of well-lit carriageway helped other drivers who,
according to the RAC motoring organisation, handled driving on the road well.
Even the jack-knifing of a lorry on the city by-pass, forcing police to close
the by-pass and put diversions in place for half an hour, did not affect
traffic flow on the new link.
There seemed to be no expressions of road rage on the new motorway, an emotion
that was warned against by the Rev Michael Shewan of Ratho during his blessing
of the road earlier in the day.
At the opening ceremony Mr Shewan called for protection from loss of life or
serious injury for all those who use the road. He called on road users to drive
with due concern for others and not to exhibit road rage.
The opening of the #40m extension was carried out by Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton at a ceremony attended by, among others, Lothian Regional
Council's transportation committee chairman, Councillor David Begg, one of the
main critics of the road plan.
The new road links the existing M8 directly to the Edinburgh city by-pass,
allowing traffic from the west to by-pass the notorious Newbridge and Gogar
roundabouts, scenes in the past of massive tailbacks at peak travel times.
Lord James said the road opening was ``a milestone in the effort to ease one of
the worst bottlenecks in the Scottish trunk road network''. He said it would
end the frustration and delays for motorists travelling into the capital from
the west.
However, Councillor Begg, a lecturer in transport economics at Napier
University, said he believed the money spent building the road could have been
put to better use to improve traffic congestion in the area.
``The Scottish Office believes the road will ease traffic congestion and stop
tailbacks for traffic coming into Edinburgh from the west,'' said Councillor
Begg. ``That may happen in the short term, but soon things will be back to
normal with more cars on the roads and the same amount of tailbacks.''
Sue Nicholson of the RAC said her organisation would be closely monitoring the
effect the extension has on traffic congestion.
``Inevitably the road will improve things initially, but it will be interesting
to see whether it has long-term affects or simply shuffles the traffic jams to
another location.''
The new road was built by Balfour Beatty and opened 10 weeks ahead of schedule.
Environmental issues were addressed by the contractors, who built badger runs
on either side and tunnels underneath the motorway to help them cross the busy
road.
To mark the special badger runs Lord James was presented with a memento of the
occasion, an ornament with badgers on it.

HARRODS owner Mr Mohammed al-Fayed is suing a firm of Scottish architects for
#500,000 in a damages action over the renovation of the Highland castle of
Balnagown, which he owns.
The action against the William Cowie Partnership, which is based in Aberdeen,
and its two partners, Mr William Cowie and Mr Harry McNab, has been raised in
the name of Balnagown Castle Estates, Kildary, in Ross-shire.
Balnagown Estates, which is being represented in the Court of Session action by
Glasgow law firm McClure Naismith Anderson and Gardiner, alleges breach of
contract and negligence over renovation work at the castle.
It is a listed building and the seat of the Clan Ross. The work includes
repairs to the the roof and external fabric.
The case is expected to be called next month, when a judge may order a hearing
of evidence or a legal debate.
Liability in the case is denied by the architects.
Mr Peter Anderson of Edinburgh law firm Simpson and Marwick, for the William
Cowie Partnership, said yesterday: ``Their position is that they have fulfilled
all reasonable obligations that they undertook in connection with the work.''

A #250,000 fraud trial which took eight years to get to court collapsed
yesterday with the two accused being freed.
The collapse of the case came just a few weeks after two cashiers at an
Aberdeen law firm were cleared of embezzling almost #600,000 after a Crown
Office mistake.
Last night, a Scottish Labour front-bench spokesman said he would be writing to
the Lord Advocate to express his ``concern'' over the two cases.
Yesterday two former directors of a double-glazing firm were cleared at Dundee
Sheriff Court of fraudulently obtaining development grants after a fiscal
decided not to lead any further evidence against them.
Mr George Miller, of Kelty, Fife, and Mr Alan Thrupp, of Cellardyke, Fife, were
charged with fraudulently obtaining #252,000 in regional development grants
between September 1985 and June 1987 when they were directors of Aluglaze
(Fife) Ltd.
However, yesterday, Sheriff John Young found the men, who had been on trial for
four days before a jury, not guilty.
The verdict came after Depute-fiscal Jane Dewar said she was to lead no further
evidence against the men. Later, she refused to detail the reasons for her
decision.
Last night Mr Miller, who attends hospital for kidney dialysis treatment, said:
``I've been worried near to death about this.
``I had a heart attack nearly a year ago and this may have been one of the
contributory factors.''
He added: ``This should never have come to court in the first place.''
The two men were directors of the double-glazing firm which went into
liquidation seven years ago.
Mr Miller said that an application for grant money was made to the Industry
Department for Scotland for staff and machinery at a factory in Dundee.
He said: ``We filled out the forms for the grants and did everything properly
through our accountants.
``I am delighted it is all over. This is a real weight off my mind.
``From day one there was nothing there against us. I didn't see that I'd done
anything wrong.
``It has been horrendous. To me, they were totally wrong to bring this to
court.''
He added: ``We have had this hanging over our heads for 19 months, since they
first charged us.
``Our legal team argued that they didn't have the evidence to convict and I
knew fine well that we didn't do anything wrong.''
Mr Thrupp was unavailable for comment last night.
Mr John McAllion, Scottish Labour front-bench spokesman, said: ``This is a
serious concern and I will be writing to the Lord Advocate about the matter.
``Clearly, to get to this stage, there has been considerable expense involved.''
He added: ``This is happening all too often and the police must also be
dismayed after so much of their time and effort has been wasted as well.''

<HEADLINE>Guppy has his bail revoked after four days</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAILED fraudster Darius Guppy, freed on bail last Thursday, was yesterday taken
back into custody after a High Court judge revoked his bail.
Guppy, who served part of a five-year sentence for staging a bogus gems
robbery, will remain in custody pending a December 19 hearing of his appeal
against an extra three-year jail term for failing to pay compensation to
insurers who paid out after the scam.
Guppy, 30, was arrested by the High Court tipstaff yesterday following a
private hearing at which it is understood that the Lloyd's insurers involved
made representations to Mr Justice May about the granting of bail.
As he left court with his arm around his tearful wife Patricia, he told
reporters: ``Just forget it. Just forget it.''
Guppy was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court in March 1993 for conspiracies
to defraud, steal, and commit false accounting and VAT offences.
Last April, he lost his appeal against his five-year sentence, but fines of
#539,000 were cut to #227,000 and converted into a compensation order in favour
of the defrauded insurers who had paid up #1.8m.
Guppy was told to pay the money within three months or serve an extra three
years.
He is now challenging the imposition of the extra sentence and at last week's
hearing Mr Justice May allowed bail, on condition that he provided a #200,000
surety and stayed at his home address.
Yesterday, bail was withdrawn. Lawyers would not disclose the reason, but it is
believed the insurers were represented in court.
In 1990 Guppy, an Old Etonian and best man at Earl Spencer's wedding, conned
insurers for compensation after faking an armed robbery of a #1.8m jewellery
collection in a New York hotel room.
His business associate, Benedict Marsh, was also jailed for five years.
A distraught Mrs Guppy said later: ``What am I going to tell my two-year-old
daughter when her daddy isn't coming home? She has only had him back four days
and we have had this hanging over us all weekend. She was just getting to know
her father.
``Darius is absolutely shocked. We just wanted to get on with the rest of our
lives. This is no longer punishment - it has gone beyond that. It is now
vindictiveness on Lloyd's part.
``I just don't know why they can't spend their money on paying back all the
Lloyd's Names instead of trying to punish my husband.''

<HEADLINE>#167,000 jobs for the image Wage bill row as New Lanarkshire councils aim to recruit 24 PR staff</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By CRAIG WATSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974929965</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COUNCIL at the centre of a Government ``jobs-for-the-boys'' investigation is
to spend #167,000 a year on staff to promote its public image.
It is understood North Lanarkshire Council will appoint nine people to run its
PR department, including a #32,000 head of department and two senior press
officers earning #24,000.
It has also emerged that neighbouring South Lanarkshire, which is larger in
land area but not as big in population, is expected to have up to 15 PR staff.
Opposition councillors at North Lanarkshire have claimed the ruling Labour
group is paying out in an attempt to avoid another Monklands-type embarrassment.
Workers are reported to be concerned the PR wage bill will mean a cutback on
jobs elsewhere in the authority.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth recently launched an inquiry into job
appointments at the council after it was revealed five out of ten top posts had
gone to Motherwell District Council officials.
SNP councillor Kathleen McAlorum said: ``My fear is that jobs at the lower end
of the scale will go so the council can afford this outrageous wage bill. The
people that are going to be affected will be the constituents, the very people
the council is supposed to serve.
``I have spoken to many workers at grass roots level who have said they are
worried sick after hearing about this. It seems to me that money will have to
be taken away from services for the people, to run a service that only benefits
the council.
``This is a total waste of money. Why on earth do they need nine public
relations officers? The only reason I can think of is because their image needs
cleaning up to such an extent.''
Mrs Susan Bell, who fought the Monklands East by-election last summer for the
Conservatives, said she was astounded no one had pointed out that
#167,000-a-year was just the ``tip of the iceberg'' for North Lanarkshire's PR
costs.
She said: ``Add on the costs for office equipment, phone calls and other costs
and the total yearly bill will be much, much more.
``Are councillors no longer in touch with their electorate that they require a
huge PR department to do their job for them? This council requires all the good
public relations it can get. But why leave that to a paid PR office when it
should be the good work of councillors and officials that speak for
themselves.''
It is thought the department will consist of a PR manager, a senior PR officer,
a senior press officer, a graphic designer, a press officer, an assistant
publicity officer, and three clerical assistants.
One Strathclyde Regional Council worker, who will be applying for a job at
North Lanarkshire, said: ``The kind of wages they are paying to the PR staff
has really worried me. I have spoken to colleagues about it and it's fair to
say we are worried that jobs we might have filled will be lost to pay for
this.''
North Lanarkshire's chief executive, Mr Andrew Cowe, said: ``On the PR side we
won't be employing any more than are already working for the existing councils.
A number of the staff will be clerical workers and they are at the lower end of
the scale.''
South Lanarkshire's #50,000-a-year PR head, Mr Drew King, said his council
would employ between 10 and 15 staff. They would include at least two other
journalists, a photographer, clerical workers and a graphic designer.
A journalist from Strathclyde's PR office is soon to be appointed to join Mr
King as his second-in-command.
Mr King said: ``It was the Government who said that people were unaware of what
councils are actually doing. We will be taking them at their word and letting
the people know what is going on.
``If the success that areas such as East Kilbride have enjoyed is to continue
then we need a strong PR department.''
Hamilton District Councillor and prospective Conservative parliamentary
candidate Margaret Mitchell said: ``It's excessive and you wonder why the
council are so obsessed with promoting a good image.
``The public do not want glossy brochures coming through their door. They would
rather see the money being spent on services.
``A certain amount of marketing is quite legitimate, but this is completely
over the top.''

A MAJOR fundraising event for voluntary groups in Scotland is under serious
threat because of competition from the National Lottery, organisers said last
night.
Disability Scotland, an umbrella organisation for 136 groups, said ticket sales
for the 1995 Care and Share prize draw were down 20% on the previous year.
It only managed to raise #35,900 from its annual drive to sell 70,000 tickets
this year, compared with #44,651 last year.
Assistant director, Mrs Mary Phisatory, said: ``The return has reduced so much
that we must wonder if we can afford to do it. The administration costs are so
high that we are going to have to see if it is still feasible.''
She said the cash from the draw was one of Disability Scotland's largest events
which represented around 10% of its annual income.
Mrs Phisatory said it was the biggest draw of its kind in the country and its
loss after eight years would be a serious blow to many small groups.
She said: ``Most of the participating groups depend greatly on this type of
shared fundraising activity, as it is so difficult to organise a successful
prize draw with the limited resources that some of the smaller voluntary
organisations have.
``It would also be sad if this shared type of activity between voluntary
organisations and community groups were to cease, as it has proved an effective
way of getting many small organisations' names into the public eye.''
Mrs Phisatory said there was a general feeling that competition from the
National Lottery was to blame for the downturn.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations said small
groups were often hardest hit by competition from the lottery. It has been
estimated that Scottish voluntary organisations will have lost #10m this year
over and above lottery handouts.
Disability Scotland said the situation would be monitored and a final decision
on the future of the draw would be made next month.

A NATIONAL mail order firm which refused to deliver goods to Skye because it
thought the island was abroad and required export documentation has apologised
with a #1000 gift.
Bradford-based Empire Stores, which had refused to deliver bookcases to
Dunvegan shopkeeper Fiona Hosford, has offered #1000 worth of equipment from
its catalogue to the village as an apology.
New hotel
ABERDEEN'S Marischal College has been given the go ahead to become a hotel.
District councillors voted 37-9 yesterday to back proposals by Scandic Hotels
to turn the largest granite building in the UK into a 190-bedroom hotel.
#14,600 teddy
A POCKET-SIZED teddy bear went under the hammer for #14,600 at Christie's in
London yesterday - more than three-and-a-half times its expected value.
Theodore, just three and a half inches tall, was snapped up in a telephone bid
by Mr Ian Pout for his Oxfordshire teddy bear shop.
Sewage spill
HIGHLAND Regional Council has admitted responsibility for a sewage spill which
killed a large number of fish in the River Druie in Strathspey last August. At
Inverness Sheriff Court yesterday sentence was deferred for one year to see
whether new procedures introduced at the Inverdruie sewage treatment plant
worked satisfactorily.
Engineer's prize
AN Engineering graduate from Glasgow will be presented with a #1000 prize today
from the Royal Academy of Engineering. Mr Paul Macgregor, 23, was one of 11
graduates selected from universities throughout the UK for outstanding academic
achievement and commitment to an engineering career. Mr Macgregor graduated
from the University of Strathclyde earlier this year.
Flight checks
PASSENGERS were advised to check with airline operators before leaving home to
catch flights today as more fog was forecast. Last night, travellers at
Scottish airports faced long waits as staff struggled to get timetables back to
normal following the weekend fog.
Driver killed
A WOMAN died and a man was left seriously injured after a car crash during
yesterday morning's rush hour. Frances Stewart, 32, of Eglinton Crescent,
Edinburgh, died when her Peugeot was involved in a head-on crash on the A904
Newton to Linlithgow road, in West Lothian. The 35-year-old driver of the other
car, who has not been named, suffered serious chest injuries and was taken to
St John's Hospital, Livingston.

COCKNEY comedy actor Arthur Mullard has died at the age of 85.
His agent, Mr Nicholas Young, said he died in his sleep in a London hospital.
Mr Young said: ``I spoke to him only last week and he seemed in fine form. He
was still doing voice-overs.''
The star of the television series Yus My Dear, had been a ``feed'' for some of
the great comic talents, hosted the Midweek Show on BBC Radio 4, and growled
his way through 50 years of showbusiness life.
A former boxer, it was as a soldier during the Second World War he discovered a
talent for comedy.
After the war he worked with Tony Hancock. His parts tended to portray him as
dim policemen and dustmen.
Yus My Dear, in which he starred with Queenie Watts, was a 1970s' ITV sitcom
and brought him a taste of the big time in his sixties.
He loved the experience. ``What d'you fink of that then? After 30 years a
bleedin' star is born.''
`I always knew I'd make  it to the top one day  and now it happens when I've
reached the age of retirement.'  He appeared in more than 400 films, and was
the voice of Butch the Dog  in Walt Disney's 101 Dalmations.
In 1978 Arthur and comedienne Hylda Baker were in the pop charts with You're
the One that I Want, a cover version of the song made famous by John Travolta
and Olivia Newton John in the film Grease.
The couple even appeared on Top of the Pops.

SCHOOLGIRL Nikki Conroy was killed by a masked knife man who blamed his dark
alter ego for wielding the blade, a court heard yesterday.
Leeds Crown Court was told that 12-year-old Nikki and two classmates were
stabbed repeatedly after Stephen Wilkinson burst into a maths lesson at Hall
Garth school, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, on March 28 last year.
Wilkinson ordered teacher Graham Nellist out at gunpoint, barricaded the door
and ordered the children to kneel with their eyes closed.
He then plunged a knife into Nikki and attacked her friends, Michelle Reeve,
13, and Emma Winter, 12.
Nikki, of Ridley Avenue, Middlesbrough, died almost instantly, but Michelle and
Emma were not seriously wounded.
Prosecutor David Robson said that Wilkinson claimed ``the person that was
actually doing it was not S J Wilkinson but the dark side of his own nature,
who he has always described as Wilson Jinks.''
Wilson Jinks is an anagram of S J Wilkinson.
Wilkinson's violent outburst came to an end when deputy head Chris Bielby and
teacher Dave Eland burst in and overpowered him, holding him down until police
arrived.
Wilkinson, 30, of Caversham Road, Middlesbrough, denies murder but admits
manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The jury was told that he also admitted the attempted murder of Michelle and
Emma.
Slightly-built Wilkinson sat with his head bowed and hands tightly clasped as
Mr Robson outlined the evidence.
Opposite were Nikki's parents, Peter and Diane. Mrs Conroy wept as her
daughter's horrific injuries were described to the jury.
Mr Robson said that Wilkinson told police he could recollect nothing about the
attack. But he later had flashbacks to the day and told psychiatrists he had
been ``watching himself doing it''.
The jury was told in a statement from Emma that just before the stabbing she
heard Wilkinson say: ``You are going to pay for what you have done to me.'' She
then closed her eyes and felt what she thought were punches. In fact, she was
being stabbed.
The rest of the school was alerted to the drama when Mr Nellist, after being
forced out of the class, shouted: ``There's a nutter upstairs with a gun and
he's got the kids.''
The teachers thought they would be putting the children's lives at risk if they
charged into the classroom, but they were forced to act when Wilkinson started
stabbing the screaming girls.
Mr Eland said: ``I saw the blood. At that point it was just instinctive - we
had to react.''
Mr Eland and Mr Bielby then burst through the barricaded door and grappled with
Wilkinson before disarming him and pinning him to the floor.
The gun was later found to be a replica.
However, the teachers' actions were too late to save Nikki, who had already
died from wounds which went right through her body and pierced her lungs,
heart, and liver.
Mr Eland said that as he was pinned to the floor, Wilkinson muttered: ``The
knife's still there. Give me the knife and let me finish it.''
Mr Eland added: ``I presumed this was his way of saying he wanted to commit
suicide.''
The court heard that, as well as two knives and the replica revolver used in
the attack, another knife and a small axe, both brand new, were found in a
holdall Wilkinson had with him.
The jury was warned to consider the ``deeply sad tale'' in a ``cool, calm and
detached way''.
Referring to recent deaths, including the stabbing of headmaster Philip
Lawrence, Mr Robson added: ``In the light of the dreadful events over the
weekend, there is a danger of emotion taking over. That you must not do.''
The trial continues.

FORMER Tory Minister Sir Nicholas Scott yesterday denied a drink-driving charge
relating to an incident in which a three-year-old child needed treatment for
shock.
The MP for Chelsea pled not guilty in his absence to driving with excess
alcohol, failing to stop after an accident and driving without due care and
attention at a hearing before Horseferry Road Magistrates Court, London.
Mr Colin Reynolds, for Sir Nicholas, told the court that his client pled not
guilty to all matters. The case was adjourned for trial on January 26 and Sir
Nicholas's bail was extended.
Sir Nicholas, a former Minister for the disabled, was charged on September 28
after an incident in Sydney Street, Chelsea, on June 1, in which his car
allegedly hit a parked vehicle, which in turn is said to have shunted into the
boy's pushchair. Thibault Perreard, three, the son of Swiss parents, was later
treated for shock.
Last month Sir Nicholas, 62, of Battersea, South-west London, won a close
battle for selection as Tory candidate for the new, safe seat of Kensington and
Chelsea. His Chelsea seat is disappearing at the next election as a result of
boundary changes.

<HEADLINE>Holy healing well found to be a fount of E-coli</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A HOLY well said to have healing powers has had its plug pulled by health
chiefs. Far from providing miracle cures, drinking the water could make a
person extremely ill, environmental health officials said yesterday.
The officials ordered water supplies to the historic Kate's Well, near
Salsburgh, Lanarkshire, to be cut off because they say the water contains
E-coli bacteria, which can cause serious stomach problems.
The water in the well is said to possess healing powers. Some local people
believe it was visited by St Katherine of Sienna more than 800 years ago, and
it has since become a shrine. Locals claim that the mysterious healing powers
are Celtic in origin.
Monklands District Council chiefs say it also has a strain of the E-coli
bacteria - which can cause severe stomach pains, cramps and sickness.
Since the well has been switched off council officials have been keeping a
close eye on bacteria levels. But yesterday they said that the well water
supply failed tests once more.
However, local priest Fr James Small, 60, wants the supply restored and the
council to erect warning signs instead, to advise visitors of the possible
risks.
He said: ``The council has acted without taking into account the wishes of the
people. I really don't think that this water is lethal. I've known people who
have been drinking it for years and suffered no ill effect.''
He added: ``People have been using that water for a long time. It is very
important to the people who live here.''
A spokesman for Monklands district said: ``We tested it last week and it failed
again. The problem could be that the water is travelling through one-inch
diameter pipes and it should be travelling through three-inch diameter pipes.
The narrow diameter of the pipes is causing water to back up.''
The water would have to pass three consecutive tests before it is allowed to be
switched on.
E-coli is usually contained in water supplies that have been contaminated by
sewerage.
q The well is named after St Katherine, an Italian, who came to Scotland in the
11th century to heal a religious split in the Roman Catholic Church.

A SCHOOL teacher and former coach with the Scottish basketball team was given
probation yesterday after admitting sexually abusing two pupils almost 20 years
ago.
George Brough, 52, was head of Physical Training at Holyrood Roman Catholic
High School, Edinburgh, when the offences occurred against two 15-year-old
girls.
His offences came to light when the two, now in their thirties, met by chance
in a cafe in 1993 and found they had both been abused by Brough while at school.
Brough, now a taxi driver, was said to be a pillar of the Catholic church in
Edinburgh, when he appeared for sentence yesterday.
Lord Johnston told the father of eight that it would not serve the public
interest to send him to prison.
The judge said that because of the length of time since the offences, the fact
there was no suggestion that Brough might re-offend, and that he no longer
worked with young people, he would place him on probation for three years.
Brough, of Cluny Terrace, Morningside, Edinburgh, admitted regularly abusing
the two females when he was with the school's PT department between 1976 and
1977.
The court heard how he admitted removing one girl's clothing, kissing her,
fondling her breasts, and simulating sex.
Mr Craig Scott prosecuting said both girls had problems at home and had
confided in Brough. His abuse of one girl began after she went to his home to
baby-sit.
Mr Scott said: ``Sometimes he would pick a girl up in Holyrood Park and drive
her to Braid Hills where the offences took place.
``He indicated to the girls that if they told anyone he would lose his job and
perhaps his family and home.''
Brough was indicted to appear for trial at the High Court after his two victims
went to the police and the procurator-fiscal ordered an investigation.
Two days before the case was to be heard he pled guilty, sentence being
deferred for background reports.
The court heard yesterday that Brough had undergone a ``spiritual change''
since the offences and was a pillar of the Roman Catholic church.
In addition to his period of probation Lord Johnston also ordered Brough to
carry out 100 hours' community service.
Brough left the court accompanied by a Roman Catholic priest.
Later one of his two victims said: ``I do not believe he had undergone a
spiritual change......He has shown no remorse to us and has hoodwinked the
church leaders.''
A priest said later: ``If a man is genuinely ashamed of what he has done and
has stopped sinning, but cannot find forgiveness in the church of Christ then
where else can he go?''

n SCOTTISH women are due to be disappointed when they unwrap the Christmas
presents this year, according to a survey from mobile phone network Cellnet.
Much as last year, really; almost three quarters say they'd like jewellery in
their stocking, thank you very much, but only one in 10 are likely to get any,
according to the answers given by their male partners. Even worse are the
quarter of all the men who said that they'd be putting something like a sexy
camisole and knickers set on their shopping list - while fewer than 1% of the
women said they wanted the damn things. Scottish women have got their men
sussed, however: aftershave and woolly jumpers are, apparently, exactly what
the man in your life wants. We won't even talk about the 6% of men who think
their women would like an domestic electrical appliance like a sandwich maker;
I feel a cattle prod might be nearer the mark.
All girl talk
n DO women make the best communicators, ask the organisers of the Institute of
Public Relations Young Communicator Award, noting that all seven of this year's
finalists were women, who do dominate the industry. A glance at the first names
of the finalists may, however, give a better indication of what it really takes
to be a good communicator in our classless society; we have an Annabel, a
Sarah, a Lorna, a Valerie, two Marias, and, distinctively, one Shaa (Wasmund,
23, who runs her own PR company and was nominated by the Guardian as one of the
people likely to be running the country in the year 2000).
It's a wipeout
n IN the best non-gender specific fashion those good people from Plysu enthuse
about the technical qualities of their new all-singing, all-dancing Mega mop,
100% viscose and with ``self-wringing action'', the ``piece de resistance of
the Mega mop design'', without saying who's most likely to be swirling it round
the lino tiles of Scotland. While all you househusbands out there might be
impressed that the #17.39 wonder ``moves mop design forward a generation'' they
should have remembered that women are less easily wooed by the technical side;
just say it gets the job done faster and we'll buy it. Maybe. Because giving up
the Vileda Wonder mop will be a wrench.
Failure to act
n PROVING that it has teeth, the Christmas issue of celebrity and gossip
magazine OK! gives Keanu Reeves the I'm Really Trying Award: ``This was his
year to cash in on his success and prove critics wrong about said acting
skills. Only problem was . . . he failed'' and to the beautiful Pamela Anderson
presents the Performance Of The Year Award: ``What a stunning performance we`ve
seen from her this year. From marriage to Tommy Lee in a white bikini,
attending Cannes with a barbed wire tattoo, this girl knows how to milk a
market''. Ouch.
Heart breaker
n ROMPING into January with Chic (``for the woman who wasn't born yesterday'')
one can hear 100 hearts breaking over the coffee bar tables of London when the
confessions of Kristen Scott Thomas (tragic but beautiful Fiona in Four
Weddings and a Funeral) are read out. Boyfriends before husband Francois were
``mostly aristocratic delivery boys at Harrods or Jacksons of Piccadilly or
silly people in the record business . . . it turned out I was choosing people
who were beautiful but thick. In Francois I discovered someone who was rather
brilliant.'' One can hear the dread words now - ``Didn't you used to go out
with her?''
Tell-tale teens
n AND also for January, Harpers &amp; Queen offers us an insight into the mind of
the nineties teenager: ``Idle, apathetic and devoid of ambition, the Underwolf
only comes out at night - to eat cornflakes, watch videos and take drugs.''
This, admittedly, on page 71, when we will have forgotten The Kidds of Barbados
on page 52 (at home with the family of supermodel Jodie Kidd who is, er, 17).

DUNDEE'S University of Abertay is to have an #8m library with less space for
books and more emphasis on electronic information.
The new facility, to be ready in two years, will devote only 25% of its space
to shelving, but students will be able to access information from across the
globe through 700 computer links to a worldwide network.
Allergy death
A WOMAN who suffered from a rare allergy to nuts died minutes after collapsing
at her office Christmas party despite frantic attempts to revive her by
paramedics. Ms Louise Westlake, 27, who was aware of her allergy and its
potential dangers, became ill as she ate a meal with colleagues at the Hilton
Hotel at Manchester Airport on Saturday night. She was pronounced dead on
arrival at Wythenshawe Hospital.
`Friendly' assault
KILMARNOCK Sheriff Court heard yesterday how a football player had to be
airlifted to hospital after an assault by an opponent during a friendly match
last June. The game, at West Bay Park, Millport, was abandoned after John Auld,
30, of Largs, punched Mr James Jamieson, of Linlithgow, who was taken by
helicopter to Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary. Auld was sentenced to 175 hours'
community service and ordered to pay his victim #750.
Rosyth question
SHADOW Chancellor Gordon Brown is to quiz Defence Minister Michael Portillo
over delays in the sale of Rosyth dockyard, whose adjoining naval base has
already been sold off. ``I want to ensure a programme of work for Rosyth that
takes us into the next century,'' Mr Brown said yesterday in Inverkeithing.
``And I will be pressing Mr Portillo for decisions.''
Rail patrols
BRITISH Transport Police in Scotland, aware of increased thefts in the run-up
to Christmas, yesterday began high-profile patrols on stations and trains to
reassure the travelling public. The officers are wearing orange tabards over
their blue uniforms to heighten awareness of their presence.
Fined for mooing
TWO young men were feeling sheepish yesterday after Stirling Sheriff Court
fined them for mooing loudly through traffic cones in Main Street, Callander.
Drew Boyd, 20, and Ross Miller, 19, were arrested on August 2 after police had
warned them for sitting on scaffolding drinking cans of beer. Miller and Boyd,
both of Callander, admitted being disorderly and were fined #125 and #200
respectively.
CJD death
IT was confirmed yesterday that a Gloucestershire Royal Hospital patient has
died of Creutzfeldt's-Jakob disease, the human equivalent of BSE. No further
details were released at the request of relatives. The body has been sent to
Frenchay Hospital, near Bristol, for a post-mortem examination.
Drink-drive rise
NINE drivers out of 342 have provided positive breath tests in the Borders
during the first two weeks of the Christmas drink-driving campaign, compared
with only five for the corresponding period last year, when more motorists were
tested.
Pay dispute
MORE than 1300 workers at Pringle knitwear factories in Hawick and Berwick are
to be balloted by their union, the General and Municipal Boilermakers, after
the company rejected their claim for a 5% pay rise.

A DUBLIN court yesterday ordered the extradition to Britain of IRA Brixton
prison escapers Nessan Quinlivan and Pearse McCauley.
Lawyers for the two men - wanted for the 1991 escape and in connection with
terrorist offences in Britain - immediately said both would be appealing
against the ruling in the Irish High Court.
Legal observers in Dublin said the appeal process and possible subsequent
hearings in the Irish Supreme Court could take up to a year to complete.
Quinlivan and McCauley, both 30, were arrested by Irish police last month after
completing jail terms for firearms offences in Ireland's top security
Portlaoise prison.
Quinlivan, from Limerick, and McCauley, who is from Strabane, County Tyrone,
Northern Ireland, broke out from Brixton after producing a gun.
They had been awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy to murder Whitbread
Brewery boss Sir Charles Tidbury and causing explosions.
Two years after the escape they were arrested separately in the Irish Republic
and later jailed for carrying guns.
They each faced a total of four warrants at a Dublin sitting of the Irish
district court yesterday seeking their extradition to Britain.
The two men failed last month in applications for bail in the Irish High Court
but may launch fresh bids to be freed following yesterday's proceedings.
Each man has 15 days formally to initiate appeal proceedings in the High Court.
A handful of demonstrators protested outside the Dublin courtroom while the
40-minute hearing went on. They carried placards opposing extradition and
querying the timing of the development in the light of the Northern Ireland
peace process.

STEPHEN McGINTY joins the queues of green-eyed Glaswegians to investigate the
sudden popularity of Irish pubs in Scotland
WHEN the Republic of Ireland jogs onto Anfield Park to face their Dutch foes
tomorrow it will be a roar to match the halcyon days of the Kop that will rise
from pubs across Scotland. From Stornoway to the Border country, pubs injected
with an Irish antidote are springing to life, animated by the sound of live
music.
An invasion of Irish theme bars has besieged it's most neighbourly nation.
Glasgow has been the biggest target with no less than three Irish pubs opening
during the past few months. While there are streets in Glasgow's South side of
which it is said the residents hails from either Bengal or Donegal, it is the
city centre that has been draped in emerald green.
While Glasgow's most famous Irish bar remains Ginty McGinty's in Ashton Lane
packed by its patrons, three new challengers have sprung up offering a welcome
diet of Ireland's best stout, friendly bar staff and atmospheres which vary at
times from a relaxed solitude to impersonations of a frenetic sardine tin.
What they said was impossible has become ordinary. Glaswegians now queue, not
for a drink, which is bad enough yet understandable, but for the simple
pleasure of entering a public house.
On a Friday night outside O'Neil's at the far end of the city's Sauchiehall
Street the queue is three deep and stretches back 15 feet. The excitement is
intoxicating, complaints are few and good-natured. A young office worker is
attempting to explain the appeal.
``It's just here the buzz is brilliant. It's relaxed, nobody is out to make an
impression, the staff are magic. And, oh, yes, here you can drink till you drop
and you're not a pisshead. You're just making a cultural statement.''
The notion of Ireland as a heavy-drinking nation was what first attracted
Europeans to the idea of theme bars. In the tight cultural control on Italy and
Spain where wine-drinking is a social part of life, Irish bars became a focus
for a night of heavy drinking hedonism.
A bar to embrace is the desired concept of both Tennents Caledonia and Scottish
Newcastle who have both invested millions to launch their own brands of pub.
Tennent's chain of O'Neil's bars are to be found in Aberdeen, Stirling, Dundee
and Glasgow, while Scottish Newcastle have a Finnegan's Wake in Glasgow and
Edinburgh.
Tennent's area manager Gillian Jack said that they were offering customers a
chance to further explore the resurgance in Celtic heritage. As Irish bars of
the past were often based in post-offices or hardware stores, Tennent's are
us-ing this as a theme in the design of each O'Neil's.
``Glasgow's O'Neil's is designed to look like a broom shop. The look is in-deed
very authentic but it's been built by the designers Thompson and MacLeod. The
staff are the most important though. We look for personality first not pour-ing
skills and then they go through a two-week training course.''
Finnegan's Wake, however is a rainbow's end of Irish bric-a-brac. You feel it
should be guarded by leprechans. There are old road signs to Kilallen, signs
for Murphy's, clippings from a million Irish newspapers and volumes of authors
such as Oscar Wilde, Seamus Heany, not to mention a tower of Irish telephone
directories.
The magpie who hoarded such treasures is the manager of Edinburgh's Rutland
hotel, Pat O'Shea, who decorated the first Finnegan's Wake in the capital then
followed up his good work in Glasgow. He was part of a four-person team that
scoured the north and south of Ireland for pubs to pick ideas from and collect
bric-a-brac.
``One of my favourites was a pub called O'Sheas, a merchant bar in Dublin it
was just brilliant - seeing that just put the final nail in Finnegan's Coffin
we knew we had to get this stuff over to Scotland,'' said Mr O'Shea. ``I think
a lot of the current enthusiasm has to do with all the optimism of the peace
process. People now see Irish pubs as a place to enjoy yourself, drink and meet
people - we like to leave all the worries behind us.''
The success of Glasgow's Finnegan's Wake has taken everyone by surprise. Callum
Wilson, the manager said business has risen six times above that earned by the
previous pub on the site.
``It was always said that people will never queue for a pub in Glasgow but they
do. On Friday and Saturday it's right out the door. They are not up-market but
Irish pubs are seen as working-class pubs by people who are not working-class.
They are seen as pubs for all. You get everybody in here from students to
office workers to lawyers and businessmen.''
A key ingredient in the success of Irish bars is their support for live music
which has all but died out in many public houses. The most popular bands on the
Glasgow circuit include The Urban Gypsies, Hair Of The Dog and Slip Jig.
In a city which still holds the scars of sectarianism it is curious to note
that Irish pubs are popular with all members of the religious spectrum. Colours

SUSPECTED housebreakers were given a taste of their own medicine yesterday when
a police force raided dozens of homes.
A series of early morning raids across Tayside by sixty uniformed and plain
clothes officers resulted in 23 arrests and recovered stolen jewellery and
electrical goods with an estimated value of #20,000.
The dawn swoops, codenamed Operation Viper, were made on between 40 and 50
homes in Dundee, Perth, Forfar, and Arbroath.
There was also a series of co-ordinated raids in London, Durham, Blackpool, and
Manchester aimed at suspected housebreakers active in Tayside.
The operation, which has been planned for three months, was launched yesterday
to co-incide with the annual rise in housebreakings that accompanies the
festive season.
Police aim to spoil Christmas for housebreakers and reduce the amount of
housebreaking by 5%. Operation Viper will run until April.
Tayside Chief Constable William Spence, whose own house was broken into on the
day he took up his post in April this year, explained: ``We are determined to
hit back at the housebreakers.
``We want to shift the balance so the housebreaker will be the individual
looking over their shoulder all the time.''
The chief constable added: ``The violation of a person's home is a heartless
and totally unacceptable crime and the aim of Viper is to reduce the number of
domestic housebreakings by 5%.''
Six teams of CID and uniformed officers were briefed at police headquarters in
Dundee at 7am before they set out to raid homes across the city.
Armed with arrest and search warrants, the teams were backed up by vans to take
the arrested ``targets'' back to the police headquarters.
Suspects were referred to only by codenames as officers communicated through a
dedicated radio channel to the special operational nerve centre in Dundee.
.q.Police recovered 35 cannabis plants from a flat in Dundee which was raided
as part of Operation Viper.

BT is not very good at talking Gaelic, according to those learning the language.
Comann an Luchd-Ionnsachaidh (CLI), the Gaelic learners association, say it has
written to the company asking what level of proven support is required before
it will treat Gaelic the same as it treats Welsh, French and other languages -
but has received no reply.
The organisation has now written to the Scottish Advisory Committee on
Telecommunications seeking its assistance in getting a proper answer.
CLI has written letters to BT in Gaelic and English on the issue.
In modern telephone boxes, instructions are displayed in different languages at
the press of a button.
In Wales, Welsh speakers can follow the directions in their native language -
but in Scotland there is no Gaelic facility.
According to CLI director Peader Morgan, BT has said Gaelic will get the same
treatment as Welsh when the upsurge in the Gaelic language mirrors the
situation in Wales. But BT refused to detail how the two languages are to be
compared.
Mr Morgan said: ``The customer services officer responsible for payphones in
Scotland also has the remit for London and the Home Counties, where he is
based. Maybe this explains why he is ignorant of the great strides forward that
Gaelic has been taking over the last decade with the support of the vast
majority of Scots.
``In many ways the upsurge in Gaelic medium education, adult learning,
employment, signage and broadcasting is very comparable with that during the
renaissance of Welsh.
He added: ``If they mean they are not interested in the popular support for the
language and only in the number of speakers, let them declare how many of us
there must be before they will grant us linguistic rights in our own country.''
However, a BT spokesman said: ``In the 1980s when we were going over to
automatic exchanges we specifically employed fluent Gaelic speakers to handle
inquiries in Gaelic, particularly emergency calls. In the end we dropped the
service because no-one used it.''
He emphasised that there were fewer than 70,000 Gaelic speakers in Scotland -
1.4% of the population - compared with 500,000 Welsh speakers - some 20% of the
population.

THE daughter of a supermarket security guard who was stabbed to death while
protecting two women colleagues has described his bravery as ``typical''.
John Killick, a 60-year-old grandfather, was stabbed repeatedly in the chest
after being attacked as he escorted the two staff members to their cars at an
Asda store in Scunthorpe, Humberside, on Saturday night.
As the hunt for his killer continued yesterday, his daughter, Mrs Julie Edges,
30, wept as she said: ``This was very typical of him. It was just the sort of
thing I would have expected him to do.
``He was very caring, not the sort of person who could pass by on the other
side of the street and not get involved. He would do anything to help anyone
else.''
Police say the 6ft security officer, who had twice been employee of the month
at the store, was confronted by a masked attacker who jumped out of bushes.
The attack, by a man wearing a balaclava, came as Mr Killick, of Scunthorpe,
escorted the women from the petrol station where they walked to their cars in
the supermarket's car park.
Detectives believe the motive for the ``frenzied and brutal'' attack was
robbery - but a bag Mr Killick was carrying contained only receipts and
paperwork.
Mrs Edges said she last saw her father on the morning of his death, when his
last words to her were: ``It's a beautiful day.''
She said: ``I am devastated, just devastated and numb. It has taken our lives
away. Not just one life but the whole family.
``I want whoever did this to be caught. I just want justice. I don't want this
to happen to anyone else's family.''
As she clutching the hand of a woman police victim support officer, Mrs Edges
described how she and her father had joked that day about how the entire family
would take a sunshine holiday if they won the National Lottery.
Mr Killick and his wife Brenda had been planning a family Christmas with Mrs
Edges, her brother, David, and five young grandchildren.
Mrs Edges said she had had her own fears about the dangers of Mr Killick's job
in security.
``It was a thought that went through my mind many times, but I never expected
it to be reality,'' she said.
``He was a much-respected, well-loved person. He had lots of friends because of
the kind of person he was. He would help anybody.
``He would never say no and would always make the time. He always put himself
last. We will miss him very much.''
Asda is offering a #5000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Mr
Killick's killer, who fled empty-handed after the attack.
Police are still searching for weapons and are studying security film from
cameras at the store to see if the attack was captured on video.

WORKERS at the HarperCollins book manufacturing plant in Glasgow have been
given until 5pm tomorrow to decide whether to accept a 9.5% pay cut or face
unemployment.
They have been warned the plant will close on Friday with the loss of all 350
jobs if they reject it.
Mr Chris Hardie, the would-be owner-manager of the manufacturing division, and
Mr Eddie Bell, chairman of HarperCollins (UK), yesterday made a series of
presentations to staff to outline the proposals.
Staff previously unanimously rejected a proposed 25% wage cut but Mr Hardie,
the owner of a small printing company in Berwickshire who is seeking to take
over the plant, has since proposed the 9.5% cut in the basic wage.
HarperCollins has been assisting Mr Hardie with his plans for the Bishopbriggs
plant, which has lost more than #10m in the past five years.
It said that if staff accepted the wage cut, this would be cushioned by an
18-month compensation package the company (HarperCollins) has put together
which would probably amount to between #2000 and #3000 per person.
Mr John MacDougall, director of human resources at HarperCollins, said:
``HarperCollins has done everything in its power to give Chris and his company
the best chance of success for the future.''
He said that, in addition to the compensation package, the company had made
``generous subsidies'' available to Mr Hardie and had agreed to guarantee a
supply of orders for five years.
He added: ``It's a fair deal and I'm confident that Chris Hardie can deliver. I
hope common sense prevails and that employees accept his proposals.''
Officials from the Graphical, Paper, and Media Union, which represents most of
the workers, were unavailable for comment yesterday.

SCHOOLCHILDREN mourned headmaster Philip Lawrence at a special mass yesterday.
Cardinal Basil Hume was the celebrant at the mass in St George's Roman Catholic
School as a team of 24 detectives tracked the gang which stabbed the teacher to
death as he went to the aid of a pupil who they were attacking.
Cardinal Hume, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales,
reminded children and staff of scripture: ``No greater love hath a person than
to lay down his or her life for a friend.
``That's what he did......This was a headmaster who was a friend to all his
pupils. They were his friends.''
Cardinal Hume told pupils the best way to honour Mr Lawrence was to follow his
example: hard work, discipline, generosity, and respectfulness.
He offered prayers for the murderer and asked the school to forgive, but added
that the culprit should be caught and punished.
He said it was unacceptable for knife-wielding gangs to be roaming the streets,
adding: ``We have allowed life to become cheap. All human life is sacred.''
As Labour and police officers called for tougher sanctions against those
carrying knives, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine told the Commons all
MPs were sympathetic to concerns raised by Mr Lawrence's murder and promised
Home Secretary Michael Howard would make an announcement soon on future action.
Prime Minister John Major was said to be ``appalled and shocked'' by the murder
and was ``keeping in close touch'' with Mr Howard and Education Secretary
Gillian Shephard to consider measures which might prevent a recurrence.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said: ``We have got to have a single offence
of carrying a knife or an open blade where the onus is on the defendant to
prove that he has it for a lawful purpose, as in Scotland, and there must be an
assumption, in my view, that if it is an adult then it should carry a custodial
sentence.''
Many pupils wept as they arrived at St George's school yesterday.
Octavia Messi, 13, said: ``The school won't be the same any more. He was a good
headteacher. He was a great man. He was fair and he was so good and generous.''
Mass was followed by lessons, but counsellors were on hand to help children
come to terms with his death.
Acting headmaster Mr Andrew Graham said the school would operate as normal from
today because Mr Lawrence would have wanted it that way.
Mr Lawrence's widow, Frances, appeared pale and drawn when she briefly ventured
out of her home in Ealing, west London.
Father Michael Hopley, her parish priest, paid the family a 45-minute visit and
said she and her four children were ``still in shock''.
``It is understandable that whatever love she has for her husband is even
deeper now,'' he said.
``Obviously, before the funeral, this is the worst time, so all we can do is to
be with them and this is what we are doing......''
Asked if Mrs Lawrence was aware of the level of public sympathy and support,
Father Hopley replied: ``I'm sure she is.''
q.In the wake of the tragedy, last night Labour leader Tony Blair called for a
new social contract to reduce crime.
He called for a restatement of personal responsibility within the context of a
caring family.
He declared: ``Just as schools should teach the three Rs, so there should be a
fourth, responsibility.''
The murder of London headmaster Philip Lawrence outside his own school last
week was a ``cruel reminder of a frightening barbarism that scars many parts of
our sophisticated and materially wealthy country,'' he said.
``There is a lack of moral purpose, of moral direction, which can be reflected
in almost any part of our national life.''
He said personal responsibility related to parents, also bullying and drugs. He
quoted an ``imaginative scheme in Scotland's Central region where students are
actively taking on the responsibility of helping their younger peers cope with
bullying and the pressure to experiment with drugs.''
Mr Blair added: ``Responsibility and citizenship can also be fostered through
student elections to school councils which encourage pupils to take part of the
responsibility for the good running of a school. The evidence is that they lead
to better discipline, better communication in the school and greater shared
commitment to the aids of the school.''
He told the Board of Deputies of British Jews at their annual dinner in
Whitehall last night that both the right and left in politics had got it wrong.
``The problem here has been that the right has simply believed that tough
penalties can be combined with economic laissez-faire, which is to ignore the
social context of the issue. The left, for a long time confused freedom with
license, discipline with oppression.
``We need to devise rules of conduct and principles relevant for the modern
world, a new social contract for today.''

NAVAL commanders lost two top secret computer disks on a train journey from
London, a court martial heard yesterday.
The officers had given a presentation to a Navy wages review team and, after
stopping in a pub for a few beers, took a train back to their unit in
Petersfield, Hampshire.
On their return, they discovered that the 3.5ins disks were missing.
The court martial, in Portsmouth, heard how Lieutenant Commanders Graham
Churton and James Richardson had copied information on to the disk at the Navy
special communication unit near Petersfield.
Lieutenant Commander Nicholas Hawkins, prosecuting, said that although the
disks did not contain top secret information, the computer they had been loaded
on to was cleared for top secret work.
He said: ``That automatically made the disks top secret, irrespective of the
data on them.''
The court martial was told that Churton, 48, and Richardson, 37, were charged
with negligence after the disks were lost on October 12 this year.
The loss was not reported until the following morning by which time the disks
had been handed in.
Lieutenant Commander Mark Emerton, defending Churton, said he accepted full
resonsibility for his part in the security lapse.
He said: ``He feels a considerable degree of remorse and embarrassment.''
Lieutenant Commander Emerton said Churton had served in the Royal Navy for 29
years and had served in the Falklands as well as the Gulf. He is due to retire
in 1997.
Lieutenant Commander James Kingbury, defending Richardson, said: ``This was an
isolated incident. Lieutenant Commander Richardson doesn't handle secret
material regularly. He is an instructor officer and he has never received
formal training in the use of classified material.''
He said Richardson was planning to leave the Navy next year after 10 years'
service.
They were severely reprimanded by the court.

On Saturday the SRU championship will be decided when Heriots play Stirling,
with Melrose waiting in the wings. By that time, Fiona Grant will have clocked
up a few more days in her six-year career as Hawick's first female physio. She
tells Ann Shaw how she matches up to the job
THE verbal crack ricochets around the physio room after the rugby match like
bullets. ``Nae kissing for you tonight lad!'' . . . ``Nae dancing for you!''
``Do come in!'' says 27-year-old physiotherapist Fiona Grant. ``You don't mind
some blood and stitches do you?''
Well, it's not a place for the squeamish. It reminds me of a hospital Casualty
Department. But this is Hawick Rugby club, and a typical end-of-match Saturday
afternoon.
There's an awful lot of male flesh around and the air is positively throbbing
with testosterone.
Stretched out on the bed is big Ian Elliot, lying like a gentle giant while
Charlie Oliver, the club doctor, daintily puts stitches in his badly cut lip.
But it's not the rugby players I've come to see. It's Fiona Grant, their
physiotherapist. For Fiona has notched up a small corner for herself in rugby
history, having led the select band of pioneering women physios who run on to
the pitch to treat injured players.
She was the first to do so six years ago. Since then many others have followed,
particularly in rugby, though an increasing number of football clubs are
employing female physios too.
Their slight figures are to be seen racing to injured players, applying pack
ice, assessing injuries, calling for the doctor, stretcher, or helping injured
players off the field.
They work fast and skilfully, spotting injuries almost before they have
happened, ready to leap forward with their black bags.
The reason for so many women on the pitch is not hard to find: most physios are
women. In the year Fiona trained at Queen Margaret College there were 40 in the
class. There was only one man, and he dropped out.
It's been a hectic afternoon with Hawick beating Stirling County, the second
resounding victory this season, and Hawick fans are delighted.
Stirling County had their own female physio too, a young woman with a
remarkable turn of speed.
Both physios never allow their eyes to stray from the game. Injuries occur with
startling speed and there's no way of assessing beforehand whether they are in
for a quiet or busy afternoon - though Fiona had said earlier she had a sense
of foreboding that they would be in for a tough time. ``Stirling County play a
hard game. We always get a lot of injuries after a match with them.''
Even so, she was surprised to find herself running on to the pitch three
minutes into the game. John Graham went up for high ball, landed awkwardly on
his left foot, tore a ligament and was taken off. He's desperately needed for
the following week's game and its going to be a challenge to get him ready.
There's a particularly nasty incident when the captain, Brian Renwick, gets
injured and lies motionless with a neck injury. He has no feeling in either
arm. But, by the time the doctor, stretcher and neck collar are all brought
together he starts to come round and with remarkable alacrity he is up and
playing again.
Rugby is a dangerous sport, not that one needs reminding of it. Certainly the
injuries look alarming. On several occasions both doctor and stretcher are
signalled for but the players rise up again, like Lazarus from the dead,
defying logic.
Fiona carries a black bag with her for emergency treatment but also has mental
baggage of all the players' past injuries.
Part of Fiona's role is to assess, with the doctor, the severity of injuries as
they occur on the field, and keep the coach informed. Often a player can do
more damage by playing on, especially if it's an old injury recurring.
Fiona may be outnumbered on the field but finds no problem in working with so
many men. ``I'm regarded as one of the team,'' she says diplomatically. ``Other
people may have problems with it but I don't. Neither do the players.''
But did she encounter any discrimination at the start? ``No, I was very
cautious the first season. You've got to earn the players' respect. Now I'm
accepted and my advice is listened to. Of yes, you do get the occasional
head-banger who will play even though you advise against it. They soon learn.
They know I am as anxious as they are that they should be fit and playing again
as fast as possible.''
Fiona is a keen rugby fan herself and that helps. Also she's a local Hawick
girl and went to school with most of the players.
As a toddler her father took her to Mansfield Park most Saturdays and among her
first words were: ``I want to be a rugby player.''
Now married to Les, with a 16-month-old toddler Kirstie, the pattern is
repeating itself. Both her parents, husband and toddler were at Saturday's
game. ``It's the next best thing to playing,'' says Fiona cheerfully.
She used to play hockey for Hawick, now she runs to keep fit. ``You don't know
how often in a two-hour game you are going to be required to run out on the
pitch.''
A keen sports-woman, she has her own way of gauging the seriousness of
injuries: ``A good guide is if it's a serious one the player does not writhe
around in agony. He just lies there motionless.
``Then you call for the doctor and stretcher.
``Most of the time they are winded. They have had a bad bang and given a few
minutes' rest they can get up and play. You've got to be certain it's not a
fracture or torn ligament and they are wanting to play on because they are on
such an adrenaline high that they don't feel the pain.'' She said it is often
not until they wake up on Sunday morning that some of the more minor injuries
manifest themselves.
Fiona works with the rugby club two evenings a week, as well as Saturday
afternoon, juggling her other jobs as housewife, mother and part-time physio at
the local hospital - a scenario all too familiar to women.
Rugby players tend to have a set standard of injuries with leg, thumbs and
wrists topping the list followed by neck, back and shoulders. Fiona describes
her job as: ``To get players back fast and safely on to the pitch.''
She remembers feeling nervous the first time she ran out to attend players
during a game. Hawick were playing Currie. How would the crowd react seeing a
``wee lassie'' running around in the middle of this very macho ritualised
sport? How would she feel treating players in the middle of the game watched by
hundreds of people instead of the privacy of her own physio room?
She need not have worried. In the heat and excitment of the game her presence
was quickly accepted.
Prior to each game there's always a queue of players wanting extra protective
bandages, injuries checked and last-minute advice.
How well do players bear pain? Fiona is frank: ``Some have got very low pain
thresholds. You've got to learn what each player can stand. Just try removing
plasters from hairy legs. Some do an awful lot of screaming.''
There's increased pressure to get players back on the pitch as fast as possible
because the league games have been restructured and now there's a league game
every Saturday.
``If a player picks up an injury one week you've got very little time to get
them fit and ready for the next week. It puts a lot of pressure on the players
and physios too. A lot of them will go through the season carrying injuries
whereas a few years ago they would have taken a couple of weeks out to recover
fully.''

<TEXT>
A ROOFER was jailed for 18 months yesterday for defrauding pensioners of
hundreds of pounds for unnecessary and shoddy repairs.
Andrew Forrest, 35, earlier admitted three fraud charges involving a total of
#2223 at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
His victims included a couple, aged 69 and 68, who paid him #595, and a
68-year-old woman who handed over #1100.
Jailing him, Sheriff Isobel Poole said his crimes had been against elderly,
vulnerable people. The offences took place in Edinburgh and Livingston in
February and June 1994.
Depute-fiscal Pam Watson said that Forrest, a prisoner, made an unsolicited
call on the first couple to tell them that he had spotted storm damage on their
roof while working on a neighbouring house.
He called up their insurers, claimed to have authority for the work, and
produced an invoice for #696. After getting #595 in cash he came back with
another man, worked on the roof for two hours and left.
Experts who later examined the work said it was of a poor standard and somewhat
unnecessary. They put its value at #295.
Forrest made a similar approach to the 68-year-old woman who gave him #1100.
Experts estmated the value of his work at a mere #373.
Defence solicitor Jim Wardlaw said that Forrest, of Lynchgate Lane, Broxburn,
described himself as a ``self-taught roofer and tiler''.
Work was done on each house and Forrest believed he was doing a job to the best
of his abilities, said Mr Wardlaw.
He added that, although he might have been ``misguided'' and charged
excessively, Forrest believed he was carrying out his business.
Forrest had been attacked and slashed while on remand, Mr Wardlaw said.
Sheriff Poole backdated the sentence to September 15 when Forrest was first
remanded.

A 62-YEAR-OLD man died of a heart attack after his young lover punched him
about the head when he tried to break off their 10-year relationship, a court
was told yesterday.
Mrs Pollyanna Peate, 34, of Calvers, The Brow, Runcorn, Cheshire, denies the
manslaughter of Mr Brian Phillips on the night of November 15, 1994.
Chester Crown Court heard that the pair played in the village band, but no-one
suspected they were having an affair until Mr Phillips was found dead in a
lovers' lane, and Mrs Peate was charged with his killing.
Mr Mervyn Hughes, QC, prosecuting, told the court how trombonist Mr Phillips -
married since 1955 - would drive Mrs Peate, a mother of two, to practice with
the Frodsham Silver Band and then drove to Hares Lane, on marshes near
Frodsham, for sex in the back seat of his car.
The night he died, Mr Hughes said, Mr Phillips had told Mrs Peate he wanted to
end their affair, then she attacked him, striking him at least four times. As a
result, Mr Phillips, who had a weak heart after suffering a coronary in 1972,
died of a heart attack.
Mrs Peate then walked a mile back into the village and caught a taxi home,
leaving Mr Phillips dead in the car.
Police arrested her on suspicion of manslaughter and when she was interviewed
she admitted that they had regularly been having sex near where the car was
found.
``That night they had both got in the back of the car together. She said that
during the act of sexual intercourse he had simply collapsed and died,'' said
Mr Hughes.
``She had tried to revive him but having failed to do so she dressed him and
walked the mile or so back to Frodsham where she caught a taxi home.''
Home Office pathologist Dr Edmund Tapp said that Mr Phillips had head injuries
consistent with being hit at least four times with a fist, and had died of a
heart attack.
He agreed that the exertion of having sex could bring on such an attack.
But he added: ``I think it is likely that he was involved in some kind of
fracas and the excitement and exertion of that would be sufficient to bring on
a heart attack.''

THE Scottish Office ordered an inquiry last night into how abortion records
were found on the site of the former Rankin Memorial Hospital in Greenock.
The hospital closed more than a year ago and the building and land were sold to
a housing developer.
The records were discovered by firefighters who were tackling a blaze at the
hospital on Saturday.
The files are believed to contain details of abortions including patients'
names, dates of birth, and operation procedures.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ``We are very concerned that records of this
kind can be accessed in this way. We will be asking for a report from the
hospital trust.''

<TEXT>
TONY BLAIR last night gave his backing to a radical overhaul of Prime
Minister's Question Time as part of a sweeping package of political reforms.
The Labour leader said in an interview with The Independent that he favoured
replacing the present ``absurd'' twice-weekly despatch box confrontations.
Instead, he envisaged a longer, half-hour session, once a week aimed at
extracting genuine information rather providing soundbites from the ritual
Front Bench skirmishes.
Mr Blair said he believed television's concentration on the ``personally
abusive exchanges'' on Tuesdays and Thursdays was bringing the Commons into
public disrepute.
Some questions would have to be notified in advance in order that more
informative answers could be provided although, he said, there should still be
opportunities to challenge the Government on the issues of the day.
Mr Blair also offered support for the idea of directly elected big city mayors,
similar to those in France and the United States, as part of an effort to
revive the role of local government.
He accepted that the idea was likely to run into criticism from within his own
party but said that such positions would encourage more talented people to
enter politics.

Tokyo
TWO members of a doomsday cult today pleaded guilty to releasing poison gas
into the Tokyo tube system at the start of the first trial involving sect
followers involved in the attack.
Toru Toyoda, 27, and Kenichi Hirose, 31, begged forgiveness for the sarin nerve
gas attack on March 20 which killed 11 people and made 4000 ill.
The prosecution says the two men and three other followers released the lethal
fumes by poking sharpened umbrella tips into plastic bags containing the sarin
gas while they rode on five underground trains.
They were members of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect), a doomsday cult
led by Shoko Asahara, who police allege staged the attack to bring down the
Japanese Government.
``Half a year has passed since the cases in which I was involved happened and
day after day, my guilty conscience is growing,'' a repentant Toyoda told the
Tokyo District Court.
``I did poke holes in bags . . . which caused many deaths and injuries. There
is no room for excuse,'' Toyoda said. ``All I can do now is to help clear up
the facts about the case.''
Toyoda and Hirose are on trial for murder and attempted murder, charges which
carry a maximum penalty of death by hanging.
``The attack was carried out under the auspices of the sect,'' Toyoda said. ``I
knew the order came from the guru.''
Asahara also faces the death penalty for his role in the attack but the start
of his trial has been delayed because the sect leader has twice sacked his
defence lawyer.
``After the attack, Asahara told us: `It is good that the victims have been
killed by those on the side of . . . the guru and Supreme Truth seekers,'''
Toyoda told the court.
Hirose read a similar statement in which he said he now realised the sect's
teachings were false.
Police have more than 100 sect followers in custody, either already on trial or
awaiting the start of court hearings, for their roles in a plot which police
say the sect manufactured the sarin gas from scratch.-Reuter.

ERIC KENNEDY meets            a young woman with                a direct
interest in                  the future character                 of banking
q SHE is the living proof that banking has changed. Indeed, Louise Newall is
one of the reasons why you can now call your bank direct and initiate a wide
variety of transactions ``without having to go out in the rain and snow''.
She started taking an interest in Scottish banks while doing a Business Studies
and French degree at Edinburgh University. That was after leaving school in
Southport, Merseyside, with four A-Levels and 10 O-Levels in 1979.
The Business Studies course was born of a vague idea that she would like to go
into business in some way. During it, however, she took the opportunity to
study marketing, and ended up examining all the Scottish banks, and why people
chose one instead of the other.
``I stood outside St Andrew Square bus station, collaring people and asking why
they had selected their particular bank,'' she says. ``Most of them had to get
their chequebooks out to see what bank they were in!''
She did a dissertation on her findings which were, largely, to the effect that
the banks were not successfully imprinting their individuality on the public
consciousness. That led to a job with the Clydesdale in 1983, when she
graduated B Comm (Hons).
She was the bank's Student Adviser, using her own experiences to help
youngsters cope with financial queries and problems, and assuring them that
banks were not ogres.
It was a rewarding time, and an opportunity to learn a great deal about the
banking world. She stayed at the Clydesdale's University Branch in Edinburgh
for three years before joining the Royal Bank of Scotland as Product Manager
for Student Accounts.
This meant working out incentives to tempt students into giving the bank their
business, and carrying out a variety of marketing projects. The bank also
introduced a Cash Club for youngsters as young as nine, under which they could
learn how to handle their money and be given a plastic card allowing them to
withdraw up to #5 a week through Cashline outlets.
There followed a period as Product Manager for the Gold Cheque Account, using
direct mail shots to those customers who seemed most likely to be interested in
the service. It was a successful campaign and Gold Cheque is now well
established.
Louise was based at the bank's St Andrew Square marketing department and had
two assistants. Then in 1987 she moved on as marketing manager for Direct
Banking, as one of a 10-strong team setting up this service from scratch.
It was, she says, a ``very exciting time'' and she was the only marketing
person on the team, liaising with people from all the different departments of
the bank involved.
``We had to find out what the customer wanted,'' she says. ``And once we felt
we had it right, we tested the service in Dundee, then followed this up with
intensive market research.''
This resulted in some minor changes to the service and the publicity leaflet
but in general, says Louise, ``we had been close to the mark''.
She now has a team of seven - four in marketing and three in sales - working
with her in a continuing campaign. Already there are 430,000 customers in
Direct Banking but there are nearly two million more to be persuaded of the
benefits.
And these are? ``It's free,'' she responds quickly, ``it's secure, and it's
round-the-clock.''
Louise also believes in Direct Talking.

IT IS a gross irony that as 179 countries around the world sign up to the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child, millions of children are being killed,
injured, starved, raped and tortured - and recruited to do the same to others -
in the war-torn corners of the world.
The launch of a 10-point anti-war agenda to call a worldwide halt to the
increase in child victims of war marks the 50th anniversary of the United
Nations Children's Fund, Unicef, set up to give emergency help to millions of
children orphaned, injured and blighted by the Second World War. Yet between
1945 and 1992 more than 149 major wars have killed more than 23 million people,
and more children than ever are being sucked into the violence.
Unicef is calling for an international law prohibiting the production, use,
stockpiling, sale and export of land-mines. They want an international
agreement that the minimum age for military recruitment should be 18, and more
support and resources for international war crimes tribunals.
They take a radical approach to the protection of children in insisting that
the idea of children as ``zones of peace'' should become a principle of
international law. The idea is that there should be geographical areas or time
periods within which children are protected from harm and provided with
essential services such as immunisation.
They are hopeful that at the next meeting of the UN inhumane weapons convention
in January, there will be further support for the land-mine ban. ``It would be
as effective as the bans on chemical and biological weapons, with breaches
being widely publicised and condemned,'' said their spokesman.
Unicef's 1996 report The State of the World's Children is a catalogue of
barbarity. ``At the end of 1995, conflicts have been running in Angola for more
than 30 years, in Afghanistan for 17 years, in Sri Lanka for 11 years and in
Somalia for seven years. The sheer length of these wars means that entire
generations have grown up in the midst of brutal armed conflicts.''
The figures for the past decade show the most appalling increase in the scale
of child victims. Best estimates are that 2 million have been killed, 4 to 5
million disabled, 12 million left homeless, more than a million orphaned or
separated from their parents, and 10 million psychologically traumatised.
The proportion of civilian casualties has been increasing from the Second World
War as a result, first, of aerial bombardment and now the fact that conflicts
are no longer between states but within them, bringing the battleground to the
village and the suburban street.
As ethnic conflict slides into genocide, child victims are not just those
caught in the crossfire but targets in their own right. As they said in Rwanda:
``To kill the big rats, you have to kill the little rats.''
One horror of technological development is that children can now be turned into
effective front-line soldiers. While a boy wielding a sword or machete with all
his strength was no match for an adult, a child with an assault rifle can take
on anyone.
``In drawn-out conflicts, children become a valued resource. They are easier to
intimidate and they do as they are told. They are also less likely than adults
to run away and they do not demand salaries,'' says the report.
There is worse. We are completely uncomprehending if we assume that such
soldier-children would be offered the greatest protection. During the Iran-Iraq
war they were sent out ahead in waves over the minefields.
For children who have grown up knowing nothing other than armed conflict,
joining an army may be the only way to survive. A military unit can serve as a
surrogate family, adds the report. It gives the example of Uganda in 1986,
where the National Resistance Army had an estimated 3000 children, including
500 girls, most of whom had been orphaned and looked on the army as a
replacement for their parents. Parents volunteer their children for the rebel
Karen army in Myanmar because they are provided with clothes and two square
meals a day.
Age is no protection against brutality. In Rwanda, for the first time in
history, children have been imprisoned and are facing trial for genocide. The
treatment of child prisoners is a whole new concern.
Women and girls suffer the additional trauma of rape and sexual abuse. In
Bosnia, Herzegovina and Croatia there has been a deliberate policy of raping
teenage girls and forcing them to bear the enemy's child.
The total number of people displaced by war is now about 53 million, half of
them children, often orphaned or separated from their parents. In refugee camps
they face malnutrition and diseases such as scurvy, beri-beri and even cholera.
``Children are suffering as a direct and immediate consequence of the decisions
of adults. If conflict seems at times to be inevitable, there is nothing
inevitable about children bearing the brunt of its consequences. Brutality,
violence, rape and torture - all would stop tomorrow if the will to stop them
existed, or if the rest of us devised means to compel them to be stopped,''
said Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef.

MR BEATTIE who says that battery powered buses are not feasible at present will
be interested to learn that two German battery and coach manufacturers are
investigating day-long operation schedules with battery-powered buses.
To achieve this requires each bus to perform a mechanical exchange of batteries
within five minutes at mobile charging stations. For two buses operating a
16-hour service, five batteries would be required.
Who knows, we may in the future see a superbreed of battery bus to give us all
respite from internal combustion fumes which pervade city centres.

THE world's fastest bear will be staying with the family of water speed
record-breaker Donald Campbell after Mr Whoppit failed to sell at auction
yesterday.
The 3!sin bear, part of a collection of Campbell memorabilia, failed to reach
its reserve price at Christie's in London.
Ms Gina Campbell, Donald's daughter, had kept Mr Whoppit at her restaurant in
Lymington, Hampshire, until bank chiefs said he was too valuable.
Now the bear and his red jacket are expected to go to a bank vault while Ms
Campbell decides her next move.
Bidding only reached #32,000 - barely half the #60,000 expected. The tiny bear
was plucked from Coniston Water just moments after Campbell's fateful bid to
break the water record in his speedboat Bluebird in 1967. The boat crashed at
328mph and although Campbell was never found the bear was spotted only moments
later.
The bear facts weren't all disappointing at Christie's yesterday, however.
Another pocket-sized teddy went under the hammer for #14,600 - more than
three-and-a-half times its expected value. Theodore, also 3!sin tall, was
snapped up in a telephone bid by Mr Ian Pout for his Oxfordshire teddy bear
shop.

CONSERVATION in Scotland has been dealt a ``body blow'' by a cut of nearly #5m
by the Scottish Office in the funding for Scottish Natural Heritage.
SNH, the statutory body charged with the conservation and enhancement of
Scotland's natural heritage, says it will have to reduce services. The
grant-in-aid allocated for 1996/97 is #36m. A spokesman said they were
``naturally disappointed''.
Mr Stuart Housden, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said:
``The scale of this cut is a body blow to conservation at a time when action to
protect special sites, promote environmental education and conserve
biodiversity in the countryside has never been more urgent.''
q The new Scottish Environment Protection Agency is to receive net funding of
#22.2m. Sepa takes over the prevention and control of industrial pollution next
year.

Madrid
A BASQUE terrorist car bomb killed six navy workers and injured at least a
dozen people today in Madrid.
The attack at a busy intersection came as the capital prepares to host the EU
summit on Friday. Authorities fear that the breakaway Basque rebel group Eta
has begun a terror campaign in the Spanish capital while it is in the
international spotlight.
Madrid's mayor, Jose Maria Alvarez del Manzano, arrived at the scene in minutes
and said the car bomb appeared to be the work of Eta.
It was just before 3pm, when the capital was on the move after lunch, that the
terrorists triggered the massive blast by remote control as a navy minibus was
passing.
A providential traffic light stopped a bus carrying 35 schoolchildren from
driving straight into the full force of the blast, the bus driver said.
``The red light saved our lives,'' he told reporters.
The six dead were all civilian employees of the navy who were travelling in the
van. Three of the injured, including a young girl cut down as she walked by,
were reported to be in critical condition.
Others suffered multiple fractures, serious burns, and cuts as the blast
damaged or destroyed at least seven vehicles and sent debris and glass flying
50yd away.
Rafael Recio, a television sports journalist, said: ``It was the most horrific
thing I have ever seen. Suddenly there was a ball of fire coming towards me.
Somehow my car managed to escape the flames and debris.''
A male pedestrian said: ``There was total panic with everyone starting to run.
I saw people with blood on their clothes and several cars in flames.''
Glass from broken windows lay on the streets as firefighters battled car blazes
and ambulances ferried the dead and injured to nearby hospitals.
The attack was the most spectacular since April when Eta tried to kill the head
of the main opposition centre-right Popular Party, Jose Maria Aznar.
Today's explosion was near a school. Panicked parents were reported to have
flocked to the area to reassure themselves about their children's fate.
Eta has repeatedly used the car-bomb tactic to terrorise the capital in its
fight for Basque independence. Today's blast was the twenty-fifth car bombing
in Madrid, which have claimed 134 lives across Spain since 1982.
As authorities appealed for calm, police began checking other parked vehicles
in case of further bombs. More than 10,000 officers will be on duty to protect
the two-day EU summit.

MR Michael Forsyth has undoubtedly fought in Cabinet for the Scottish Office
budget; that is the least that he could do. Nevertheless the details as
announced yesterday to the Scottish Grand Committee do not make encouraging
reading. There are some winners and some losers and that was only to be
expected. Yet some of the losers are losing very badly and in the case of
housing expenditure to an extent that will be extremely difficult to rectify.
Mr Forsyth is not so naive as to believe that everyone will agree with his
assertion that the Scottish people positively require a spending emphasis on
tourism, health, and law. Even within these three priorities there is
disappointment. More policemen on the beat is a generally welcome development
but we will want to know a good deal more about how the Scottish Tourist Board
and its bureaucracy will spend extra money before any cheers are raised. In
comparison the increase in funding for the National Health Service in Scotland
is risible and below anything that would enable it even to stand still.
We will return to some of the other losers in Mr Forsyth's budget, but the
greatest uproar was caused by the treatment meted out to Scottish Enterprise.
Professor Donald Mackay may be characterised as the Secretary of State's
flexible friend but there is no reason to doubt Mr Forsyth's assertion that he
had considered a bigger cut in Scottish Enterprise's budget. By volunteering a
7.5% cut, even although it will carve some #33m from SE's budget, Professor
Mackay may have saved his organisation from something worse. The effect on
Highlands and Islands Enterprise was compounded by the fact that it was not
even consulted, but only two months ago there were serious rumours that
Scottish Enterprise faced cuts ranging from 5%-15%. It is suggested elsewhere
in this newspaper that Scottish Enterprise will have to make even greater use
of part-time staff if it is to maintain its core services under the effects of
the new budget. There is a danger for SE in this, for its existing extensive
use of anything but full-time staff has led some companies they seek to help to
say that they would not share sensitive commercial intelligence with SE because
the person handling it could end up working for a competitor. That is just one
of the many holes in the brave new world of part-time work.
The housing expenditure settlement announced by Mr Forsyth is depressing in the
extreme and here, as in the roads funding budget, we see the hypothetical hand
of the Private Finance Initiative. The cutback of around 20% in housing
expenditure over the next 12 months is simply unjustifiable. As the director of
the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has made clear, the
associations and co-operatives have tried their level best to mix public and
private finance in their projects and in many cases they have succeeded. The
response of the Government to this is that more private involvement is
necessary and will fill up the holes in the budget. Taken together with the
clear intention of forcing councils to transfer their housing stock to private
landlords, the ideological drive to privatise housing in Scotland is nakedly
clear. This Micawberish reliance on something nice turning up from the private
sector is very unwise. The Government has tried for many months to promote the
PFI and has re-launched it on several occasions. Yet it shows no sign of
meeting the inflated expectations demanded of it. Mr Forsyth has done
reasonably well for Scotland in terms of the global sum in a tight year, but
the questionable ideology which powers the outworking of his policies is as
prominent as ever.

ACTRESS Frances Barber was cleared yesterday of head-butting a policewoman and
trying to bite her after being caught driving nearly three times over the limit.
Barber, 38, had been celebrating at Tramps nightclub in London's West End after
portraying Marilyn Monroe in a play when she allegedly attacked the officer in
the back of a patrol car, Clerkenwell Magistrates Court heard yesterday.
The film and TV star claimed their heads clashed accidentally while she
attempted to get out of the vehicle to put up the roof of her Golf Cabriolet
convertible.
Barber was fined #12OO and banned from driving for 20 months after admitting
drink driving.
A magistrate described her behaviour as a ``grievous'' breach of the
drink-driving laws.
Barber, of Highgate, London, was stopped as she travelled home at 4am.
Constable Maria Lovegrove and a colleague waved Barber over because her car was
swerving from side to side.
Barber told officers she had drunk only one glass of wine but was arrested
after a breathalyser test showed she had 1O2 micrograms of alcohol in 1OO
millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35 - and she was placed in the back
of the police vehicle.
Officers then struggled to raise the soft-top of her car.
Ms Lovegrove said: ``She was abusive and shouted: `If you let me out I will do
it myself.' She suddenly lunged towards me and attempted to bite me on the left
cheek. She had her teeth bared. She hit me with her head near the left eye.''
But Barber denied she had tried to attack the officer, claiming she had been
attempting to get out of the car when their heads bumped.
Her barrister, Mr David Green, pointed out Ms Lovegrove had no teeth marks and
there was no sign of the thick red lipstick Barber was wearing for her Monroe
role.
Barber told the court she had never been in trouble before and had a clean
driving licence and regretted the ``unfortunate incident''.
Barber refused to comment as she left court.

A FIFE couple were away on their honeymoon when thieves broke into their home
and found between #3000 and #6000 worth of cannabis plants.
At Dunfermline Sheriff Court yesterday Warren Bell, 36, of Houldsworth Street,
Blairhall, and his wife, Jan, 23, were charged with producing cannabis and
having the plants in their possession.
Depute-fiscal Fiona Robertson accepted a not guilty plea from Mrs Bell. Her
husband admitted the offences.
``The accused and his wife left to go on their honeymoon on July 22 this
year,'' said Miss Robertson.'' Five days later the police were told a
house-breaking was in progress at the Bells' home.
``They apprehended three men who had seven cannabis plants in their car.
``Inside the house the police found lighting and electrical equipment using a
timer switch growing 20 cannabis plants. Each plant could produce between one
and two ounces of the drug with a street value of #150 per ounce.''
Mr Douglas Thompson, defending, questioned the depute fiscal's figures and
values and Sheriff Stuart Forbes fixed a proof in mitigation for January 8.

I AM sure many sensible people will regard the negative views of some of the
so-called captains of industry in Scotland as appalling.
What a ridiculous concept that if Scotland regained its nationhood tomorrow,
many firms would overnight become less competitive and less attractive to
shareholders.
If a firm is making money for its shareholders it makes little difference
whether it is located in and/or has its HQ in Scotland or Taiwan.

AS a 70-year-old who still does occasional work, my earnings for these efforts
have been taxed via our local tax office in Dumfries. This year I received a
letter telling me that they were transferring this onerous task to Portsmouth.
I have written three times to Dumfries with no reply, but received a letter
from Cumbernauld giving me a new ID number for use with Dumfries.
Portsmouth have written with a demand based on a deliberately inflated estimate
of my earnings, to which I replied with actual figures. No reply since October,
but now there is another demand from the Inland Revenue at Bolton.
My gross earnings for the year are almost #350.

COUNCIL tax bills may have to rise by up to 8% if local authorities south of
the Border are to deliver planned increases in spending on education next year,
Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave said yesterday.
That was the Treasury's ``pessimistic'' working assumption when doing its
Budget sums, Mr Waldegrave told MPs on the Treasury and Civil Service Select
Committee.
``I very much hope it will be (pessimistic) but I don't know. We may turn out
to be justified in our pessimism. This really will depend on how people run
their local authorities,'' he said.
Labour's Shadow Chief Secretary Andrew Smith seized on Mr Waldegrave's comments
as confirmation that the Tories were ``giving with one hand and taking away
with the other''.
Mr Waldegrave defended the Chancellor's decision to cut income tax by 1p in the
pound in the Budget despite a projected overrun on borrowing.
Although forecasts for the public sector borrowing requirement in the current
financial year and 1996-97 had been raised by several billion pounds compared
with last year's Budget, borrowing was still on a downward path, Mr Waldegrave
told MPs.
A modest tax cut in those circumstances was ``sensible and reasonable'', a
judgment which had been endorsed by the financial markets subsequent calm
reaction, he said.

THE Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham, will reveal at 9.30 this morning
whether the rail franchising director can proceed with passenger franchising
contracts, the first of which were to be announced today.
Yesterday, sitting with Lord Justice Waite and Lord Justice Otton, he heard a
last minute appeal, by the Save Our Railways pressure group, against last
Friday's dismissal by Mr Justice Macpherson of its allegations that franchising
director Roger Salmon had breached Government assurances in setting minimum
service levels.
If they allow the appeal Mr Salmon will have to restart the franchising process
from scratch.
However, if the appeal judges concur with Mr Justice Macpherson's view, that Mr
Salmon had acted within his lawful discretion, then the first franchises for
passenger services on South West Trains (from London Waterloo) and LTS (London,
Tilbury, and Southend) will be announced later this morning.
At the heart of the renewed challenge was Mr Justice Macpherson's observations
on Friday that he was unable to accept that former Transport Secretary John
MacGregor's instructions meant that the minimum passenger requirements should
be nothing other than ``a mirror image'' of the current timetable, and the
franchise director had acted within his lawful discretion.
Mr Jeremy Sullivan QC, appearing for Mr Salmon, argued that Mr Salmon had acted
in accordance with his instructions from the Secretary of State.
The QC gave an assurance that the first franchises would not be announced until
after today's court hearing.

Murray Ritchie, European Editor, examines how the EU countries are coping with
the criteria for monetary union and whether the political will is still there
for the great gamble
THESE are dark days for those who support the high ideals of a united Europe
with a single currency as its totem. All manner of unforeseen obstacles and
doubts have arisen with bewildering suddenness.
Germany's opposition Social Democrats, desperate for an electorally friendly
issue, have seized on national doubts about abandoning the D-mark - and when
the German will is weakened, the whole European apparatus trembles.
Europe's greatest ambition could yet be lost in the street battles of Paris.
France has gone into a paroxysm of strikes and riots against the economic
disciplines which are necessary for those wanting to join the single-currency
club. Without France there probably cannot be a single currency, such are the
political imperatives driving this debate.
No-one knows what to do about the Belgians, whose divided country is hopelessly
in debt and, therefore, nowhere near meeting the most demanding criterion for
joining in economic and monetary union (Emu). Yet Belgium is supposedly an
inner-core EU member state run by committed federalists.
How different it all was only a few years ago when the most obscure backroom
economist in Germany, France or the Benelux states could grab lurid headlines
in any British newspaper just by suggesting that Britain and others might be
consigned to the slow lane of progress towards Emu if we did not play the game.
Nowadays prime ministers and presidents say the same thing daily and no-one
pays much notice.
One of the great ironies in this collective collapse of confidence among the
EU's leaders is the fact that Britain - by far the most Eurosceptic community
member - is one of the most obvious candidates for membership of the single
currency, and the country least likely to join (assuming - big assumption here
- that the Tories are still in power if and when Emu comes about). The Danes,
even better qualified for membership, also have an opt-out.
As the pro-European Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, is forever boasting, the
so-called Maastricht convergence criteria - the targets which aspiring
single-currency member states must meet if they are to join - are good for the
economic soul. The disciplines demand respectable inflation, interest rates,
currency stability, debt and government deficits - all most efficacious for the
national economic wellbeing, although the point might be lost on those chucking
smoke bombs on the streets of any French city this week.
Very few self-confident Euro-loyalist voices are heard these days. True,
Jacques Santer said last week he believed that between seven and nine countries
would be ready for the single currency on January 1, 1999, and that would be
enough to guarantee stable monetary union. But even the European Commission's
holy writ is somewhat devalued after Neil Kinnock's gaff-blowing exercise last
month when he made a supposedly private speech challenging the realism of early
Emu.
There is a suspicion here that Kinnock might have been quite deliberately
provoking scepticism on the issue as a favour to Tony Blair who is terrified of
being seen to be too pro-Europe in his pursuit of the middle-Englander vote,
but that is a question for another day. The commission is, we now know for
sure, split in private despite its public show of unanimity.
This week the Emu juggernaut parks itself in Madrid where a summit of EU
leaders will examine the faltering progress towards the single currency and,
along the way, will probably choose a name for it. (Still no-one can come up
with anything better than the ``Euro''.)
They might well find that making headway is easier than the headlines suggest.
As far as the performance of aspiring single-currency members is concerned, it
is not all gloom by any means.
The facts are these: of the 15 EU member states only two are uncommitted in
principle to joining the single currency: Britain and Denmark. So the political
will undoubtedly exists in theory. Few observers really and truly believe that
one or two member states can run a healthy currency in parallel with a new and
vast rival - potentially the leading denomination in the world - without huge
problems.
In plain economic terms, Santer is probably right. Those who look like being
able to join in 1999 include Austria, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and
Netherlands. Those who, with a bit more effort, could join the club include
Finland, France and Sweden.
Even the Belgians could make it if something radical is done about their
crippling debt. You don't need to be an economist to see there is something odd
about a country which is flat broke but where so many people drive around in
Mercedes and BMWs, and where the poor enjoy a social security system so
generous that Peter Lilley would slit his wrists.
But Belgium is at the federalist heart of Europe and of the hard-currency
Benelux states. These people, allied with France, have ways of bending rules to
look after their own. So don't yet rule out the Belgians.
For the Spanish, there is little hope of founder membership. They and the
Italians are probably doomed to late entry to a single currency. Portugal has
failed to be like Ireland which broke free from the influence of a dominant
neighbour's currency and will probably take the plunge only with Spain.
Indeed Ireland's economic performance is the phenomenon of the EU. Quite soon,
when the statistics are published, the UK is going to be embarrassed at being
compared with the Irish (if you ignore unemployment) whose prospects are so
improved that, unlike us, they no longer qualify automatically for Objective 1
assistance. The SNP cannot wait to pounce on the figures.
And that leaves just the Greeks whose receipts from the EU of about #1m a day
until the end of the century will still not be enough to let them join the
single currency on Day One.
About half of the EU member states, perhaps a majority, remain on course, in
theory. In practice, the number of states willing to join no longer matters.
The day is past when a majority was needed under Maastricht because that
deadline was missed. Yet politically, it could still all go horribly wrong.
Germany and the Benelux states and, say, Austria could form themselves into a
currency union and leave the others to catch up. But this would not answer
France's preoccupation with establishing a new economic and political
relationship with Germany. The ghosts of two world wars and a long history of
conflict in earlier times are the real players here. Everyone in Europe knows
it, including the French strikers, who smartly chose to press on Chirac's
exposed nerve.
No-one believes Helmut Kohl would jettison Chirac at this stage if France
failed to meet the economic challenge.
You only have to look at the history of exchange rate speculation and
politically inspired competitive devaluation to see how Britain's spending
power abroad has collapsed in a generation. France's could yet go the same way
in rather shorter order if there is no workable settlement.
I can recall four dollars to the pound (which is why we war babies used to call
the old half-crown half-a-dollar) and I also remember the night during the
Thatcher years when we almost hit the dreaded one-for-one barrier.
Not so long ago we needed the fingers of both hands to count the D-marks we
could buy for a pound. Now we get two. If Britain stayed outside the single
currency would matters really improve - or would George Soros and his friends
not assume Christmas had been delivered on a daily basis?
Most politicians and economists believe the European single currency is
inevitable at some point in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, their will
is being sapped by public opinion. The Germans will need an awful lot of
convincing that surrendering the D-mark is a great idea. Almost 60% of Germans
are against Emu for that reason. An act of great courage is required from
Helmut Kohl if he is simply to ignore his own people, as he is entitled to do,
and probably must do, when the time comes.
Emu supporters can take some heart in the knowledge that simple economics will
take care of much of the problem. There is less to worry about than we might
imagine. Why, otherwise, are banks, financiers and big business not opposed?
No, the real problem is political. Our leaders are now running scared of the
single currency for two major reasons.
First, it removes politicians' scope for sticking their hands in the till to
manipulate currencies for political ends. The sorry history of politically
expedient devaluations by governments of all colours has proved that point (and
even Mrs Thatcher got it wrong when she tried to revalue by putting the pound
into the European exchange rate mechanism at a rate which could not be
sustained).
Second, and probably more compelling, is the fact that most Europeans don't
want it because they don't understand it. They fear and distrust the unknown.
Perfectly understandably they are more interested in jobs and security than in
allowing their money to be a pawn in an esoteric European adventure launched in
a recession.
For that reason politicians are frightened to show a lead. Domestic elections
keep getting in the way. This is one issue which will separate the smart
politicians from the true leaders.

GREEK Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was put back on a respirator today
after he suffered a new infection that caused high fever, his doctors said.
``It is a dangerous situation,'' said a hospital spokesman.
Papandreou, 76, has been in hospital since November 20 with pneumonia and has
been hooked up to life support machines. After a tracheotomy operation he had
managed to breathe without a respirator for three days.
``We don't know yet where the infection is coming from,'' the spokesman said.
``We are fighting it with strong antibiotics.''
Earlier, members of Papandreou's socialist party debated whether to ask him to
step down as he entered his fourth week in hospital.
Pasok's policy-making executive bureau appeared divided over whether or how to
ask Papandreou to clear the way for a new leader who would lead the party into
the 1997 General Election.
``These are hard decisions. Papandreou created most of us politically and it
will take a brave man to tell him that his days in politics are over,'' said a
government spokesman.
Opinion polls show voters no longer wanted Papandreou to remain their
leader.-Reuter.

AN architecture journalist, Mr Deyan Sudjic, has been named as the director of
the prestigious Glasgow, City of Architecture and Design 1999 campaign, beating
four other candidates to the coveted #65,000 a year post.
Yesterday the London-based writer and professor of design theory was in Glasgow
to outline his vision of the campaign. He will take up his new post at the
beginning of February, but said he intended to move to Glasgow in the new year.
Mr Sudjic, 43, has been hailed as a design and architecture expert whose
appointment will be pivotal to the success of the campaign, which it is hoped
will bring multi-million-pound investment and hundreds of jobs to the city.
In its bid to win the title proposals have already been put forward for a
Millennium Tower and the transformation of the Lighthouse building in the city
into a centre for architecture and design. Mr Sudjic said he and his new team
would focus on public spaces and on trying to enthuse the people of Glasgow
about the merits of architecture.
The new director graduated from Edinburgh University with a BSc and diploma in
architecture. He spent many years writing for the architecture and design trade
press, including a spell as assistant news editor with the Architects Journal
and deputy editor of Design magazine.
In 1983 he was among a group of journalists who founded the international
magazine Blueprint, which he now edits.
Mr Sudjic has also written for national newspapers, working as architecture
correspondent on the Sunday Times in the 1980s. He is currently the Guardian's
architecture critic. He is also author of The Hundred Mile City, which examines
the modern metropolis.
Outside the writing arena, Mr Sudjic is a visiting design theory professor at
the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. Last year he masterminded a
competition to design a new opera house for Cardiff.
Describing his directorship as a challenge, Mr Sudjic said Glasgow was a city
that had changed dramatically over the past 20 years and was, he said, a place
that needed to be treated with respect.
``Aims and objectives set out in the bid can only in my opinion be achieved by
combining the talents, expertise, and commitment of business, investors, the
educational system in general, and Glasgow's people in particular. My role must
be to harness and focus that energy.''
Mr Sudjic, tipped as the favourite in the run-up to yesterday's announcement,
was selected by a panel of six judges, including the leader of Glasgow City
Council, Mr Pat Lally, the leader of Strathclyde Regional Council, Mr Bob Gould
and Mr Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of the Glasgow Development Agency.
He was described as a man of vision, enthusiasm, and experience by Mr Gould and
an excellent choice by Mr Gulliver. In answer to questions about Mr Sudjic's
Scottish credentials, the judges said the principal criteria had been selecting
the best person for the job.
Mr Lally said that the 1999 campaign would, like the 1990 year of culture,
attract considerable investment to Glasgow. ``I would be happy if it succeeds
in making Glasgow the Vienna of the north,'' he added.

THE Prime Minister came under fresh attack yesterday from his own side as
senior Tory MP David Howell said Government foreign policy was going ``off the
rails''.
Mr Howell, a former Cabinet Minister, who is quitting his Guildford seat at the
next election, said Britain was ``too busy running after the French and
Germans, and being terrified they are going to pull some trick and we are going
to be left behind''.
His comments came just 24 hours after former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath, a
fervent pro-European, appeared to threaten to back Labour in the Commons over
Europe.
Mr Howell, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee and a
well-respected voice on the Tory back benches, highlighted further divisions
within the party when he suggested the Government was too Euro-obsessed.
Four-fifths of Britain's commercial and financial interests lay outside western
Europe, he argued.
Mr Howell suggested Europe had become such a dominant issue, that Britain had
taken its eye off the ball.
Meanwhile,infuriated Tory back benchers moved quickly to denounce Sir Edward
Heath's reported comments on being willing to back over EU policy.
Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, said: ``The Chief Whip should call Ted
Heath in, call his bluff and give him the option of remaining within the
parliamentary party or crossing the floor.''
However, Sir Edward last night issued a statement to underline the fact that he
was talking in hypothetical terms about Europe policy of a Labour Government.
``There is no truth whatever in the press reports that I am threatening to
support Labour over Europe while the Conservative Party is in Government,'' he
said.

OUTRAGE last night greeted Michael Forsyth's announcement of a real cut in
education spending next year. The Scottish Office plans to spend the same
amount as it allocated this year, #1277m.
Scottish Office Minister for Education Raymond Robertson, said his department
had been treated very favourably despite a very tough public expenditure round.
But Mr Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the Educational Institute of
Scotland, said the standstill amounted to a real cut when inflation was taken
into account. He also wanted to know what would be cut to allow #15m of planned
new spending.
``What is going to make way for these new initiatives?'' asked Mr Smith, who
was particularly angered by plans to spend about #9m over the next three years
on doubling the number of assisted places which helps with private school fees.
About #1m will go to expand the scheme next year, on top of the annual spend of
up to #11m. As much as #3m will be earmarked to pilot the controversial voucher
scheme for pre-school education, while more than #9m will go on staff
development for initiatives such as teacher appraisal, the 5-14 programme, and
the Higher Still reform of upper secondary schooling.
Another #2.05m will be available to develop Higher Still. Mr Smith said annual
Government spending on assisted places worked out at more than #3000 per pupil,
compared with local authority averages of #1724 in the primary and #2078 in the
secondary sector.
Labour's Scottish education spokeswoman, Mrs Helen Liddell, said: ``It is a
direct subsidy for the private sector when state schools are crying out for
funding.''
Further education faces a cut of more than #4m in its budget while higher
education's reduction amounts to #7m.

responsible (October 21)
May I now praise the programme of the Celebration in Music for the Life of Sir

The design and contents were the responsibility of Scottish Opera, and it may
be that Concert Hall staff were in no way involved. I hope, however, the lesson
has been learned.
The concert was immensely enjoyable and I read the programme from cover to

FANS across the US are celebrating as Frank Sinatra, one of the most imitated
and revered singers in American history, turns 80 today.
To mark the latest milestone in the life of the man who did it his way, New
York's landmark Empire State Building will bathe itself in blue light and local
radio station WQEW-AM will wrap up 81 consecutive hours playing virtually every
song he ever recorded.
``We are playing an hour of his songs for each year of his life and one for him
to grow on,'' said a spokesman.
Sinatra watchers say he has quietly decided to quit performing except for a
rare occasion. ``There is no question about it, he has quietly retired. His
last full performance was last February at a charity gala, and interestingly
the last song he sang that night was `The Best is Yet to Come','' said
disc-jockey Jonathan Schwartz.
The Oxford University Press will tomorrow publish The Frank Sinatra Reader,
which collects close to 300 pages of serious critical writings on his music.
Daughter Nancy has also published a book about her father.
On Thursday, ABC-TV airs a two-hour birthday special featuring Ray Charles, Bob
Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, U2's Bono, Patti LaBelle, Little Richard, Tony
Bennett, Natalie Cole, Vic Damone, and Salt'n'Pepa, all covering the songs
Sinatra made famous.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>THE ARTS Gallery anger as purchasing power halved</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974930010</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Arts Minister Lord Lindsay yesterday announced capital spending of
#68.3m on cultural projects in Scotland, but provoked strong criticism from the
National Galleries of Scotland after cutting its purchasing budget for next
year by half.
The cash plans include formal approval for the main #32m construction phase of
the new Museum of Scotland, further phases of fire safety improvement works at
the National Library and a planned conversion of the Dean Centre to house
material gifted by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi to the National Galleries.
Lord Lindsay said that while he had been able to endorse the three major
capital projects, he had been forced to reduce expenditure for the National
Museums and Galleries of Scotland.
Director Timothy Clifford said last night the galleries had not been informed
of the cut before a press statement was issued. He said he was later told by
the Scottish Office that the galleries' purchasing budget was to be cut from
#1.3m to #650,000.
``I know that my staff are extremely disappointed by these figures. It is the
most swingeing cut I can remember in all my time in museums and galleries,'' he
said. There would now be nothing left in the next financial year to buy new
paintings after payments were made for the Penrose collection and a second
painting acquired by the galleries.
Mr Clifford said there would also be no cash available for any lottery
partnership grant deal.
``We would have been able to acquire many works of art in the forseeable future
for Scotland, but this will now not be possible,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for the National Museums of Scotland said that while it had
expected its budget to be tight, it was delighted at the approval for the new
museum project.
The Scottish Arts Council warned of hard times after learning it would receive
a standstill grant of #24.47m.
Chairman Dr William Brown said: ``In present circumstances, this is a positive
statement in support of the arts by the Secretary of State. However, with
inflation at over 3%, it does mean another difficult year for the arts at a
time when Scotland's arts are achieving unprecedented success at home and
abroad.''
Budgets for the Scottish Film Council will also remain at standstill level, the
Minister said.
q THE Scottish Tourist Board last night welcomed the Scottish Secretary's
decision to increase its support to a record level as ``a most welcome and
clear signal of the importance which he attaches to tourism''.
Mr Forsyth announced that he had increased the STB's budget for 1996-97 by #3m
over the previous level of planned spending for that year - an increase of some
20% which brings the budget to #18,309,000.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth last night disclosed when the Commons
Scottish Grand Committee will meet north of the Border during the rest of this
parliamentary session and named some of the venues.
This comes after his announcement last month of a reform package on the
government of Scotland in a bid to upstage Opposition parties' plans for
devolution.
This provided for the committee, which has also been sitting at Westminster, to
meet in more often in Scotland, and including venues outside Edinburgh.
Ministers could have to travel there to respond to Scottish MPs' questions.
Mr Forsyth last night sought Commons approval for 12 dates up to next July.
The first meeting is scheduled for January 15 in Edinburgh's New Parliament
House.
This is followed by sittings at Albert Halls, Stirling - in Mr Forsyth's
constituency - on January 29; Highland Regional Council Buildings, Inverness on
February 5 and Aberdeen's Town and County Hall on February 19.
Other dates named, but with no meeting places yet disclosed, are March 4, March
15, April 22, May 13, May 20, June 10, June 17 and July 8.

AN increase of #121m, amounting to 0.2% in real terms, enabled Mr Forsyth to
cling by his fingernails to the Government's manifesto commitment to continuing
growth in the NHS.
However, the lion's share of this growth goes to the Family Health Service,
reflecting the shift of emphasis to general practitioner care. The FHS also
covers dentistry, prescriptions, and ophthalmic services.
For the hospital and community health sector that leaves a slight decrease in
real terms, fuelling the conflict that drove Professor Richard Olver to quit
his job as vice chairman of Tayside Health Board last week because of the
pressure on acute services resulting from the shift of resources to primary
care.
In cash terms the increase brings total provision to a record #4200m for
1996-97, or #820 for each man, woman, and child in Scotland, said the Scottish
Health Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
Capital projects in the NHS will also reach record levels, courtesy of the
Private Finance Initiative, which is expected to produce #75m next year.
This, together with a capital investment commitment from the Government
totalling #196m, will help to fund hospital rebuilding programmes.
Health boards have been set an efficiency target of 3%, or about #83m, which is
to be reinvested in the service. This will include the recently-announced
savings of 5% from the management costs.
Lord James pointed out that per capita spending on health in Scotland runs 23%
above the comparable English figure.
While the Family Health Service grows by 4%, or #62m, NHS management executive
sources acknowledge that the hospital sector's #78m amounts to a slight
reduction in real terms for the acute, community and mental health, and care of
the elderly sector.

William Russell questions why Britain's stringent rules on accepting refugees
should require tightening
BRITAIN has a long and honourable tradition of offering asylum - ``a place of
refuge'' - to people persecuted for their political or religious beliefs. Those
who have come over the centuries have included the Huguenots, Jews fleeing
persecutors throughout Europe over the centuries, dissidents from the former
Iron Curtain countries, and fugitives from right-wing military regimes in Latin
America, Africa and Asia. Some have remained, others have simply waited until
they could return safely to rebuild democracy in their native lands.
It is undeniable that those who stayed, and most of those merely stopping over,
have enriched the social fabric of the nation, although it would be wrong to
deny that we would probably have been better off without some of the latter.
Persons given asylum can foment trouble not always in our interests.
The criteria for asylum contained in the 1951 UN convention are well-grounded
fears of persecution by reason of race, religion or nationality. It is not
enough to want a better life for oneself and one's family, so the economic
migrant need not apply. The convention is only a declaration of principle,
allowing countries to lay down their rules within these criteria.
We already have a stringent immigration regime. Those who think the Government
are doing the right thing by tightening the law, creating for the first time a
``white list'' of countries whose citizens need not bother applying for asylum,
and making it a crime to employ an illegal immigrant, allege that the
convention definition could apply to about 100 million people. But even if
there were 100 million people throughout the world seeking asylum, that is not
to say they would seek it here, so the figure is bogus.
The Asylum and Immigration Bill, needed, according to the Home Secretary
yesterday, because Britain has become far too attractive a destination for
bogus asylum seekers, was not intended to end the asylum tradition, rather to
create a firm but fair immigration policy which would make Britain ``a haven,
not a honeypot''.
But the law was last revised by the 1993 Asylum Act. Have things got that much
worse since then? How attractive is the honeypot? Is the benefit system really
being exploited to an untenable extent given that social security spending on
asylum seekers is only 0.25% of the total budget? Or is the Government playing
the race card? Nothing Mr Howard has said removes that suspicion.
AsYLum applications rose from less than 4000 in 1988 to about 40,000 for the
current year. Last year 32,380 applications were received, of which 825 were
granted asylum, a further 3600 given exceptional leave to remain and there is a
backlog of some 55,000 cases.
Clearly the rules are working. The significant figure is not the total seeking
but the number granted asylum - only 825 people last year; hardly an opening of
the floodgates. It is true the trend in applications is upwards, and there does
appear to be a racket in bogus asylum seekers which has to be tackled. But our
present stringent entry controls, if operated properly, should do the job.
Mr Howard said some countries generated a large number of claims, but few if
any genuine cases, hence his ``white list'' - including Bulgaria, Cyprus,
India, Ghana, Pakistan, Poland and Romania.
Mr Howard said our procedures were being abused and the relentless rise in
applications was outstripping our ability to deal with them. But the place to
stop the bogus seeker is at the start of his journey, not the end. Admittedly
air travel makes it easier than it once was for people to cover long distances
and tends to dump the problem on our doorstep. When the Uganda Asians were
fleeing from Idi Amin their main route to Britain was overland through the
Balkans. They were being turned back in droves at the Yugoslav frontier by an
accommodating regime, and the problem was not allowed to reach here.
The list means people from the countries on it need not bother applying, and if
they do, officialdom being what it is, their cases will receive the most
cursory examination, increasing the risk of unjust refusals, exacerbating a
problem rather than curing it. Home Secretaries tend to be remembered by their
mistakes. Just as the Dangerous Dogs Act is Kenneth Baker's memorial, this Act
could prove to be engraved on Mr Howard's heart.

<HEADLINE>Hospitals hit by shortage of consultants Waiting lists `set to grow'</HEADLINE>

WAITING lists at Scottish hospitals are set to lengthen again because of a
growing shortage of senior medical staff, the president of the Royal College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow warned yesterday.
Despite the Government's determined efforts to reduce the time patients have to
wait for operations, longer lists are forecast for a number of reasons now
emerging - including increasing numbers of consultants opting for early
retirement.
While in the past it could be anticipated that most would stay on until they
were 65, many are going four or five years earlier, disappointed with
increasing NHS bureaucracy, the difficulties of fund-holding, or simply because
of improved pension deals. Nor has it gone unnoticed that research shows that
doctors who retire earlier live longer.
Projected figures of senior staff have also been affected by the higher
percentage of women in medicine who work part-time for domestic reasons, or who
take significant time out to raise a family.
While Professor Norman MacKay, President of the Royal College, does not want to
restrict the number of women entering medical schools - it is now about 50/50
between the sexes - nevertheless the impact of career breaks has to be taken
into account, he says, when planning future services.
There is also concern about the growing numbers of people leaving the
profession. Some say they are simply disillusioned with medicine. Other trained
medical staff are tempted to alternative careers such as medical legal firms
and management consultancies.
About a quarter of the posts at senior house officer, one of the steps on the
way to becoming a consultant, are filled by doctors from overseas, many of whom
will eventually return to their own countries.
Consultants remaining in their posts also face problems - particularly the
increased hours they have to spend in counselling and explaining treatment to
relatives of patients.
The Government has recognised there will be a problem by offering universities
limited funding for an additional 100 medical students a year for the next five
years across the UK. But as it takes a minimum of 13 years of training from
student to consultant, it will be years before this increase could have any
impact.
Professor MacKay said yesterday that more had to be done to make training more
flexible, so that staff who would otherwise opt out for domestic or personal
reasons could be retained.
In addition the skill mix at hospitals will have to be looked at. ``We ought to
be looking at what doctors actually do,'' he said. ``They could be used more
effectively if certain of their work is done by other skills such as specialist
nurses, secretarial and so on. It may also be that there will have to be a
rationalisation of services - one unit, rather than two, in order to use staff
more effectively.''
More than half of the 2500 doctors surveyed for the specialist magazine
Hospital Doctor said they believed a manpower crisis is imminent in Britain's
hospitals.
They said staff shortages are leading to a deterioration in services, with
reports of longer waits, and cancellations of outpatient appointments, elective
surgery, and even emergency procedures.
Health Minister Gerry Malone has said that steps were being taken to address
restrictions in some specialities, but medical staff are questioning whether
this is too little, too late.

THE Lanark Blue cheese affair, which ended this month in the reprieve of the
threatened food, will have written itself into the history books. It is indeed
a matter of some moment, still leaving the creator of the cheese under grave
financial threat and exposing both a local authority, and behind it the
Ministry of Food, as having acted in the most savage and insupportable manner.
Many observers will have heard harsh echoes of 1984 in the sufferings of Mr
Errington, who makes Lanark Blue, for he needed successive victories in the
courts before his local council would admit defeat, and defer to common sense
as well as justice. If, initially, there has to be some understanding of the
local authority's position it is quickly eroded. It must have seemed to the
officials involved that there was a case against the cheese. It contained a
bacterium, listeria, which can be dangerous. Its presence was never denied and
is anyhow testified visually in the blue veins which give the cheese its name
as well as something of its texture and flavour. It seemed to be a health
hazard and EU regulations appeared to demand its banning in spite of its having
acquired a deserved fame as the Scottish equivalent of the world-renowned
Roquefort (though they are really quite different in both taste and texture).
The beginnings of the case might therefore be excused; and the local district
council could be further defended since it seems to have been offered poor
technical advice from its specialist consultants. Both officials and
specialists interpreted the EU regulations in the most literal manner and
seemed quite unaffected by the consequences of their opinion for Mr Errington
and his customers, the very people whom they were, presumably, trying to
protect. The fact that the cheese had no history of associated illness whatever
was entirely disregarded, as was the fact that there are many forms of listeria
not all of which, by any means, are hazardous when ingested by humans. The
whole prosecution had an abstract quality divorced from reality, something
augmented by the fact that those pursuing the case, unlike the defendant, were
not having to meet the considerable legal costs which now fall on the local
taxpayers. The willingness to ignore what was considered unwelcome legal
judgments must have owed much to the fact that considerations of cost could
simply be ignored.
Unreality, probably, insularity certainly. How were the local officials and
consultants able to ignore the experience of other EU blue cheeses, from the
popularly known Danish Blue to gorgonzola, never mind the famous ewes' milk
Roquefort which had inspired Mr Errington in the first instance? Were they
entirely unable to recall the delicatessen in all our supermarkets?
In fact had the Clydesdale officials and the technical advisers been willing to
consult the EU directly they would have found that in practice Brussels is
flexible in interpreting Directives and can have them overruled when they
contradict historical experience and common sense. Any stick which the EU gets
from this case is not deserved - that should be reserved for the Ministry of
Food and Fisheries which has acquired an unfortunate record for rigid adherence
to, and implementation of, the letter of the EU law. Mr Errington has been
saved by the courts and his own dogged performance (both worth a cheer) but he
is left massively out of pocket. Justice demands that his costs be met by the
body which almost destroyed his business. That inflicts a penalty on the
council taxpayers, but they ought to remember it when next they vote. Before
then, should not some people be considering resignation?

I WAS most concerned that a paper of such high quality and integrity as The
Herald has received, and published, incorrect facts with respect to the tenth
anniversary celebrations of links between Glasgow and Nuremberg.
It was indeed a fact that a brass band, The Bakers Band, from Nuremberg played
a concert in the Transport Museum. However, this was a joint event with the
YMCA (Glasgow) Wind Orchestra, whose musicians had already rescheduled
arrangements on two occasions to allow events to coincide with Glasgow city
councillors' plans to attend the concert.
This cultural event was enjoyed by many members of the public who were
pleasantly surprised to have a musical accompaniment to their visit to the
museum. Suffice to say that, sadly, our civic leaders missed this experience as
they failed to appear.
An apology to our foreign guests would not have gone amiss.

THE new Michael Forsyth continues his attack on a Scottish parliament with
infantile comments about so-called tartan taxes.
What happened to the reformed character who would listen to the people of
Scotland? It seems the leopard cannot change his spots. He surely is the
Cabinet's man in Scotland.
What people in Scotland want is a parliament that will take account of the
needs and opinions of people, not like the last 16 years where people's
opinions have counted for nothing, whether it was Michael Forsyth or Ian Lang,
both of whom managed to all but wipe out Tory support in Scotland.
Scottish people rejected Michael Forsyth's pet policy, the poll tax - the real
tartan tax. Ninety-seven per cent opposed removing water and sewerage from the
control of the democratically elected council in Strathclyde's water
referendum. Ian Lang went on to introduce water boards but the Scottish people
are not fooled - quangos are not in public control.
The first steps to privatised opt-out hospitals were rejected by people in
Aberdeen and Ayr in ballots. Michael Forsyth recently had to prop up Aberdeen
Hospital with #1m. HCI Hospital spent #30m of public money.
Messing around with local government has threatened services and jobs provided
by local authorities. This process has been rushed through on the basis on
political dogma against most of public opinion and costing hundreds of millions
of pounds.
The Tories have been rejected in every democratic test of public opinion - Euro
elections, Parliamentary by-elections, and local authority elections. What does
it take for someone like Michael Forsyth to understand that his tired old
arguments have been thoroughly rejected?
We don't want his phoney meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee with visits
from John Major &amp; Co. What we want is a parliament within the UK that will
truly represent people in Scotland. We've had enough of governor-generals.
The best thing now for the people of Scotland and the UK would be for Michael
Forsyth and the other Tories to stop posturing and call a General Election now.

THE director of Glasgow's 41 libraries, Andrew Miller, still refuses to stock
copies of the gay weekly newspaper, The Pink Paper, other than from behind the
counter in the social sciences department of the Mitchell Library.
At first he did so because he believed it would contravene Section 28 of the
1988 Local Government Act which forbids local authorities to ``promote
homosexuality'' in the same way as heterosexuality.
After learning of Mr Justice Collins's ruling against a similar ban by
Calderdale Borough Council, he was then reported as saying he was unhappy with
adverts. Another excuse was that the newspaper has insufficient Scottish
coverage. Gay Scotland is also under-represented.
Andrew Miller says he has to be sure there is a demand for it in the libraries.
Many gays leave their country homes for the city. Glasgow is no exception with
an estimated one in 10 lesbians, gays, and bisexuals living here. Compare this
with the country's estimated one in 100 diabetics yet, in my local library,
diabetics have access to their magazine, Balance, and three cookery books.
There are no books on homosexuality.
Does it have to take gutsy demonstrations by Outrage! and the Lesbian Avengers
to kick Glasgow Libraries into the 21st century?

Britain and Libya
expel envoys
NICOSIA: Libya last night ordered a senior British diplomat to leave the
country by Christmas Day. David Hawkes, head of the British Interests Section,
was informed of the decision through the Italian ambassador.
The order followed a similar measure earlier by the Foreign Office when Khalifa
Ahmed Bazelya was given the same date to leave for ``activities incompatible
with his diplomatic status'', a diplomatic euphemism for spying. Britain broke
off diplomatic ties with Libya in 1984 after the killing of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher.
Chechens march
GROZNY: Thousands of Chechens marked through the ruins of the capital Grozny
yesterday, demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops on the first anniversary
of the army's bloody offensive against the breakaway province.
Ebola found
GENEVA: A medical team has found four more suspect cases of Ebola virus in
Liberia after a refugee crossed into Ivory Coast suffering from the highly
contagious disease. Two suspects have been isolated in their home, one is in
hospital, and the fourth, the refugee's wife, is being traced.
Horseman held
AUCKLAND: American Bruce Davidson, one of the world's top equestrian
competitors, was arrested at Auckland airport in New Zealand yesterday and
charged with possession of cannabis.
Syrian move
WASHINGTON: President Bill Clinton announced he was sending State Secretary
Warren Christopher back to the Middle East to revive peace talks between Israel
and Syria. The move came after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
on his first US visit since the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.
Editor named
CHICAGO: Australian Nigel Wade, foreign affairs editor of the Daily Telegraph
since 1986, has been named editor-in-chief of the Chicago Sun-Times, another
newspaper in the Hollinger group of Telegraph owner Conrad Black.
Nablus joy
NABLUS: Thousands of Palestinians danced in the strees of Nablus, commercial
centre of the West Bank, after Israeli troops pulled out and handed over to the
Palestinian Authority. The move, 48 hours ahead of schedule, ended 28 years of
occupation under a peace deal with the PLO. ``We were taken off guard. It is a
historic moment,'' said Mayor Ghassan Shakaa.
Jackson better
NEW YORK: Michael Jackson was to be discharged from hospital today after
recovering from a virus that made him collapse at a rehearsal last week.
Doctors said the 37-year-old singer was in stable and improving condition, but
he would still need several days' bed rest and outpatient treatment.
Confession valid
LARNACA: A judge in Cyprus has ruled that a disputed confession by a British
soldier to the murder of a Danish woman tour guide was admissible in court. The
defence had objected to the statement signed by rifleman Alan Ford, 27, one of
three Royal Greenjackets charged with abduction and manslaughter in the death
of Louise Jensen, 23. They claimed he had signed it after 36 hours without food
or sleep and after being told his co-accused had already incriminated him.
Snow record
NEW YORK: New York state had its worst recorded snowstorm at the weekend, which
dumped 37.9in of snow on Buffalo. The cold weather was blamed for seven deaths
in the central and north-eastern United States.

doubts on the requirement that the company be a ``fit and proper'' participant
in the lottery, a requirement Mr Davis is required to enforce.
Mr Davis told MPs he had required all participants in the lottery bidding
process to complete declarations revealing any convictions or indictments. He
enlisted the help of the FBI and other agencies to investigate.
But pressed by MPs to reveal what information he had of any court cases or
other investigations against GTech, Mr Davis said he could only do so in
private session.
He had obtained the information on the condition he did not make it, or its
source, public.
``I would not be able to meet my statutory obligation if I had not given them
an undertaking of confidentiality.''
In the programme Mr Branson said he met Mr Guy Snowden, the head of GTech, in
London on 24 September, 1993, before the contract had been awarded. He claims
Mr Snowden said: ``I don't know how to phrase this Richard. There is always a
bottom line. I'll get to the point - how can we help you?''
Mr Branson said he was so ``flabbergasted'' he ``went off to the loo and
scribbled what he had said on a piece of paper''. It was the first time anyone
had ever tried to bribe him.
A witness of the meeting, Mr John Jackson, emerged last night.
In a statement he said: ``I was present at the meeting on 24 September 1993
between Richard Branson and Guy Snowden. I stand by everything that Richard
Branson has said to Panorama regarding that meeting.''
Mr Jackson, who is now chief executive of dry-cleaning firm Sketchley, said he
was also present at a meeting with Mr Branson and Mr Davis at which Mr Branson
``raised this matter with Peter Davis in the context of the wider issues of why
the Lottery Foundation had not been selected to run the National Lottery''.
THE National Lottery was plunged into further controversy last night after its
watchdog chief admitted to MPs he took flights in a private jet belonging to a
member of the operating consortium.
Mr Peter Davis, director general of the Office of the National Lottery (Oflot),
told the Commons Public Accounts Committee his decision to use the aircraft
owned by US firm GTech had been wise and had saved taxpayers' money.
A committee member accused him of being ``an innocent abroad''.
The new row came as would-be lottery operator Richard Branson stood by his
allegation, made in a BBC Panorama programme screened last night, that he was
offered a bribe to drop his bid to run the lottery.
MPs on the committee showed surprise at Mr Davis's disclosure that he took
flights courtesy of GTech when he visited the US. Mr Davis said he had gone to
Florida to talk to a rival company.
He stressed he had travelled to America at his department's expense, but added:
``Some of the internal journeys that I made within the US were made in the
private aircraft of GTech. I believe it was October 1994.''
Labour MP Alan Williams pressed him: ``Was that wise?''
Mr Davis: ``I think it was extremely economical. The decision of mine to
appoint Camelot (to run the Lottery) was announced in May.'' Mr Williams noted
that decisions on who would run associated games, like scratchcards, continued
after that.
Mr Williams challenged Mr Davis: ``Don't you understand that perhaps the
British taxpayer may be happier to have paid your fare than to have you, the
regulator, being flown around the US by someone who had a commercial interest
in your decisions and the long-term oversight of this lottery?
``I don't for one second think you knowingly did anything improper. I think you
were indiscreet and ill-advised.''
He added: ``I can understand why you might have decided to do it but I think
most people would question your judgment in doing it.''
Mr Davis said he had insisted his department would pay his hotel bills and so
on: ``My subsistence was entirely paid for out of the Budget.''
He declared: ``I incurred absolutely no obligation to GTech.''
Mr Williams: ``You know that but other people don't know that. This is the
mistake you've made.''
Earlier, despite persistent questioning, Mr Davis told the Committee he would
reveal only in private the results of his investigation into GTech.
On Panorama, Mr Branson, whose Virgin group was involved in an unsuccessful
lottery franchise bid, claimed a GTech executive tried to persuade him to
withdraw from the contest.
Mr Branson claims he subsequently told Mr Davis of the GTech approach, but
Oflot denied the claim as ``untrue'' and said it was consulting legal advisers.
GTech, which specialises in lottery technology and accounts for as much as 70%
of the global lottery industry, is one of the five shareholders in Camelot.
Panorama claimed GTech or its executives are the subject of several FBI
investigations in the US and faces proceedings in federal court in two states,
Kentucky and New Jersey.
MPs fear this would cast doubts on the requirement that the company be a ``fit
and proper'' participant in the lottery, a requirement Mr Davis is required to
enforce.
Mr Davis told MPs he had required all participants in the lottery bidding
process to complete declarations revealing any convictions or indictments. He
enlisted the help of the FBI and other agencies to investigate.
But pressed by MPs to reveal what information he had of any court cases or
other investigations against GTech, Mr Davis said he could only do so in

THE Government's ``betrayal'' of Britain's merchant shipping fleet has forced
the Ministry of Defence to charter foreign vessels to deploy troops and
equipment around the world, Labour claimed yesterday.
``It is a public outrage,'' said Dr David Clark, Shadow Defence Secretary.
``Action must be taken urgently to ensure that British vessels are somehow
available for these vital tasks.''
Dr Clark has been told in a Commons reply that during 1995 the Ministry of
Defence chartered 70 merchant vessels, of which only 15 were flying the British
flag, for various duties.
``The rest came from Panama, Malta, Ukraine, Latvia, all over the place, but
anywhere except Britain,'' he said.
``Indeed, a vessel from a Baltic source had to be used to take some British
military personnel and their equipment to Bosnia recently.'
Dr Clark said that in 1980, soon after the Tories swept to power, there were
1143 United Kingdom owned and registered merchant ships. ``This is now reduced
to 258 ships.
``This is clear evidence that the Government has betrayed the British merchant
fleet.
``It is scandalous, when you consider the heroic part our merchantmen have
played down the years in the defence of our nation, that we are compelled to
rely on ships from other countries to fulfil essential roles while the
Government turns its back on that fleet.''

<HEADLINE>ROADS Public spending freeze on motorways and trunk roads</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office announced a freeze on the amount of public cash to be spent
on building and maintaining motorway and trunk roads in Scotland next year.
However, it refused to be drawn on whether the standstill budget for next year
of #230m will hold up or cancel any existing road projects. It said there were
no plans to introduce toll roads.
Roads Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton defended the figures. He said it had
been a tough public expenditure round and keeping the same budget level for
next year was an excellent result for every road user in Scotland.
A close look at the figures shows that although the budget is set at #230m next
year it is anticipated the budget for the following year, 1997-98, will fall to
#209m. It is then expected to rise to around #224m.
Lord James said he expected some #180m of private finance to be dedicated to
roads projects in Scotland over the next three years.
He indicated that among the new roads projects likely to be tackled with
private money included upgrading the M8 between Baillieston and Newhouse.
Last week the Scottish Office announced that the A74 upgrading would be
completed by private finance. Yesterday the new #40m M8 extension, built by
Balfour Beatty 10 weeks ahead of schedule, under budget and on a private
contract, opened on the west side of Edinburgh.
However, the move towards bringing private companies in to build roads was
described as ``building roads on HP''.
Lothian Regional Council's transport committee chairman, Councillor David Begg,
said: ``The figure for motorway and trunk roads in Scotland is obviously
falling in real terms.
``Building more roads is clearly not the answer to help our traffic problems as
it has been proved it just encourages more cars to use them. Regarding bringing
in private firms to build and design roads, this is just a way to pay for roads
on HP.''
Lord James said: ``The trunk road network is fundamental to Scotland's
competitive economy and it is against this background that we have fought hard
to protect our roads budget.''

REVIEWING Runrig's performance at the Concert Hall in Glasgow, Iain Ross
describes the group's music as ``torpid'', which according to my dictionary
means sluggish, dormant, and numb. Is he serious?
I'm sure the audience, who were treated to a crafted mix of old, new, slow and
fast material would suggest otherwise.
The songs are alive and clearly demonstrate the extensive songwriting and
musical talents of the group.
Runrig's music has no boundaries, and why should it.

A WARRANT was issued yesterday for the arrest of a member of the First Sea
Lord's staff.
Sheriff George Presslie made the order at Haddington Sheriff Court after
Lieutenant James Minter, 25, failed to appear for an intermediate diet
regarding a traffic charge. Trial has been set for January 4 next year.
The court was told by a lawyer that Minter was not present because he worked in
the office of the First Sea Lord in London.
It was the second time the sheriff had issued a warrant against the Royal Navy
officer for non-appearance.
Lieutenant Minter, of Streatley House, Streatley, Reading, denies dangerous

AS always, Brian Wilson's Friday article (Why nuclear generators feared power
of the pen) makes stimulating reading (December 8).
Scottish Nuclear does understand the power of the pen and we believe in open
and honest communications. That is our stated policy. For instance, in a recent
issue of our staff newspaper we published a thought-provoking article from
Friends of the Earth (Scotland), balanced by the company's counter-arguments.
People who are confident of their views need not fear debate. Recently we
invited Brian Wilson similarly to contribute an article to the Scottish Nuclear
News.
The company is required to submit all published material for vetting by the
Government's legal advisers under the Financial Services Act (FSA) in the
run-up to privatisation of the nuclear industry.
Regrettably, time constraints made it impossible to ``FSA-clear'' the companion
article which was to present the company's counter-arguments to Brian Wilson's
article within the publication deadline.
However, I can give Brian Wilson my assurance that his article will appear in
full in the New Year edition of our company's newspaper. It merits being
printed and just to whet everyone's appetite, it starts: `` . . . Since
becoming MP for Cunninghame North, I have consistently supported the nuclear
industry and worked closely with Scottish Nuclear''.
Meanwhile, Scottish Nuclear will be hosting its traditional Burns Supper at the
Caledonian Club in London in January, 1996, to which Brian Wilson has already
been invited. I do hope he is able to accept, and, as Burns says:
``That man to man, the world o'er,
Shall brithers be for a' that.''

Lagos
NIGERIA today named a commission to hold elections under a transition to
civilian rule demanded by Western countries critical of the hangings of nine
human rights activists.
Military ruler General Sani Abacha swore in the eight members of National
Electoral Commission of Nigeria in the capital Abuja, saying Nigeria deserved
peace and stability.
``This is attainable only if democracy is allowed to flourish,'' Abacha said,
adding: ``This administration regards democracy as an inalienable right of the
people.''
The commission will be headed by Dagogo Jack, a former deputy governor of
Rivers state, the oil-producing region where writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other minority rights activists were hanged last month.
The hangings, in defiance of worldwide appeal for clemency, renewed pressure on
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation of 90 million, to restore democracy
after many years of military rule.
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth and given two years to show
seriousness at restoring civilian rule while the United States and the EU, its
main trading partners, imposed an arms embargo and stopped visas to its
officials.
The military government has proposed a three-year transition to civilian rule.
In Pretoria, southern African leaders met to discuss Nigeria but decided not to
take any initiative of their own against Abacha's government.
South African President Nelson Mandela, who has been leading a campaign to
punish Nigeria by imposing an embargo on its vital crude oil exports, said
future moves should be directed through a Commonwealth monitoring committee on
Nigeria.
Abacha told the Abuja ceremony that apart from conducting the elections, the
committee would also register political parties.
Chairman Jack said the committee would do its best to give Nigeria
democracy.-Reuter.

THE war of the words and the political ``spin doctors'' intensified yesterday
as Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and the Labour deputy leader John
Prescott swopped insults in the Commons. This blustered on with an exchange of
letters.
The result of this battle of the party image-makers is crucial as both sides
gear up for a long General Election campaign.
Mr Prescott yesterday challenged Mr Heseltine to account for a series of
Government embarrassments over PR exercises - in particular, the case of the
warning to lawyers that the Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay did not give, despite
it being reported in the Daily Telegraph.
Mr Heseltine countered last night on Labour's ``spin doctors'', in particular
Mr Alastair Campbell, the Labour leader's press officer. Would he become press
secretary at No 10? Was it true? If so, did it demonstrate that if Mr Blair
became Prime Minister he would ``politicise'' the job which has been held by
professional civil servants since the 1970s.
In the Commons earlier, the Deputy Prime Minister was answering questions on
the conduct of Tory Central Office, and in particular that of the Tory Party
chairman, Dr Brian Mawhinney. All relevant questions had been answered,
declared Mr Heseltine to Labour and Liberal Democrat protests.
``The chairman of the Conservative Party is a very valued and upright member of
this Conservative administration who is more than able to explain, as he has
done many times, as has the Lord Chancellor.''
This left MPs and reporters bewildered, trying to recall any such explanations
given by either the Lord Chancellor or the party chairman. The Deputy Prime
Minister merely retorted that questions should be addressed to specific members
of the Government responsible.
This was Mr Hesletine's ``spin'' which he had developed at yesterday morning's
private meeting of the Government's propaganda team of Ministers and officials.
At this meeting, Mr Heseltine is said to have applauded Dr Mawhinney for doing
a grand job and told him to keep up the good work. Apparently, the more Labour
complains about Tory dirty tricks the better he likes it.
Last week, Labour Chief Whip Donald Dewar went so far as to accuse the Tories
of ``lies''.
Central Office had got hold of a Home Office document concerning the details of
a Nigerian would-be asylum-seeker, which was leaked to the Guardian.
The next day, Tuesday, Tory allegations that the Labour Party had been using
intimidation in Mr Blair's Sedgefield constituency to prevent a school opt-out
were squashed when the headmaster begged the Tories to lay off.
On Wednesday, Central Office leaked a draft speech by Lord Mackay to the Daily
Telegraph which he had decided not to deliver when he addressed the country's
top lawyers in London.
The battle continued last night when Mr Prescott wrote to Mr Heseltine
demanding the answer to 10 questions. He claims that relevant questions had not
been answered by those involved in this ``sorry saga''. Furthermore, the Lord
Chancellor does not answer questions put to him by members of the Commons. He,
Mr Heseltine, who is responsible for the presentation of Government policy,
should answer.
``From this,'' writes Mr Prescott, ``we must make the obvious conclusion that
the press stories of a rift between you and Dr Mawhinney are true, that the
Cabinet is divided over Dr Mawhinney's methods and incompetence, and that your
bombast and bluster about Labour's competent media and campaigns is just
that.'' For good measure Mr Prescott accused Mr Heseltine of ``sheer
ineptitude''.
The Deputy Prime Minister maintained his lofty response to these allegations,
claiming that Mr Prescott was distorting the situation. If Mr Alistair
Campbell, a former Daily Mirror and Today columnist, was to be Mr Blair's press
secretary at No 10, the nation should be told.
``This really would be politicisation of the Civil Service.''
At the weekend, Mr Dewar referred to Tory party ``lies'' and an attempt to
politicise the Civil Service. Mr Heseltine states: ``If it is your intention to
make such an appointment (of Alastair Campbell), that sits ill with the remarks
of your own Chief Whip. To accuse us of politicisation of the Civil Service
while all along you are plotting for the Labour political machine to take over
the No.10 press office is the most breathtaking hypocrisy.''

Paris
HOPES rose sharply today that two French airmen shot down over Bosnian Serb
territory in August were still alive, and President Jacques Chirac's office
said intensive talks were on to win their freedom.
Three days before Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the leaders of
Bosnia and Croatia were due in Paris to sign a peace pact, French officials had
warned that the entire peace process was endangered by the missing pilots.
However a presidential aide said France was suspending threatened action
against the pilots' captors while talks with Serbia and France's allies went
ahead.
``Intensive contacts are under way on the one hand with our allies, on the
other hand with Belgrade. Under these conditions, the decisions taken by France
will not be announced today,'' the official said.
He was speaking after Chirac held the second meeting of the day with his
defence and foreign ministers on the fate of Captain Frederic Chiffot and
Lieutenant Jose Souvignet, whose Mirage 2000 was shot down over the Bosnian
Serb stronghold of Pale in Nato air raids on August 30.
There had been no clear word of their fate until today.
Earlier, Yugoslavia's defence minister told a visiting Nato delegation that the
Bosnian Serb authorities were about to issue a statement on the pilots and
hinted that it would be positive.
And in Washington, the White House said ``there has been activity'' on the
pilots' question and added it was ``very hopeful'' they would be released soon.
Milosevic was quoted by Belgrade radio tonight as saying his government was
doing all it could to clarify the status of the pilots. ``I hope there will be
success,'' he added.
Karsten Voigt, a Nato parliamentarian who led the delegation in Belgrade, said
Bulatovic seemed to think the pilots had been detained to force changes in the
US-brokered peace plan due to be signed in Paris on Thursday.
There has been speculation that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and army
commander Ratko Mladic were holding the airmen either to press for changes in
the Dayton deal, or as an insurance policy against their arrest for war crimes.
With the pilots' families constantly on news bulletins, it would be politically
difficult for French President Jacques Chirac to host the signature summit if
the pair's fate was unresolved.
Along with Milosevic, whom Chirac has held responsible for the pilots' safety,
the pact will also be signed by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and
Croatia's Franjo Tudjman.
President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister John Major, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl
will also attend the signing ceremony at the presidential Elysee Palace,
although France has dropped a demand that the pact be renamed the Elysee Treaty
for posterity.
In Sarajevo, Serbs were preparing for a referendum in Serb-held northern and
western suburbs which revert to government control under the terms of the peace
plan.
Western governments insist the outcome of tomorrow's referendum will have no
effect on the Bosnian peace deal.
The referendum was organised by Bosnian Serb leaders to highlight what they say
is the impossible predicament of Serbs being forced to choose between living
under the rule of their former Muslim and Croat enemies or leaving their homes.
However, in a counter-demonstration in the capital, Sarajevo residents rallied
to say they could live happily alongside Serbs in nearby suburbs who are
resisting a return to Bosnian Government control.
Some 3000 people, Serbs as well as the city's majority Muslims, gathered on the
city's main street in an organised counterblast to recent protests in Serb-held
suburbs against the Dayton peace deal that hands their areas to the government.
The protesters said they wanted to show the will still existed, despite 3!s
years of siege and bombardment by Bosnian Serb forces, to live in harmony with
Serbs.-Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE Scottish Secretary kept his law and order promises yesterday with funds for
an extra 500 police officers, 313 of them in the coming year.
Mr Forsyth also announced #4m of new money over three years which could bring
an estimated 15 more CCTV schemes in towns across Scotland.
A further #1.1m has been set aside to bring Scottish police forces up to speed
on DNA, although there are disagreements among the eight chief constables as to
whether Scotland should simply tap in to the English DNA database in Birmingham
or go it alone.
In addition, an announcement is imminent on funding for a Scottish headquarters
for the National Crime Intelligence Service.
The Scottish Office has increased police grants by #17m next year, despite the
tight spending round, with the global law and order budget for Scotland rising
from #451m this year to #455m next year followed by a jump to #476m in 1996-97.
However, hidden in the expenditure figures is a squeeze on courts spending
which goes down to #72m next year from the current #80m. The budget for prisons
is #174m next year as against #166m in the current year, which is expected to
be sufficient to cover the increase in numbers of prisoners.
Mr Douglas Keil, general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, which
represents 95% of officers, said: ``One hundred and fifty new recruits and 163
officers released by civilianising police posts next year will please the
public as well as ourselves.
``The money for DNA testing and more CCTV is very helpful.''
The extra police funding will allow Strathclyde to recruit 48 civilians and to
hire 52 new officers. Central Scotland will get an extra 44 officers on the
beat, Fife 56, Grampian 36, Lothian and Borders 35, Northern 8, Tayside 28 and
Dumfries and Galloway 6.

THE flippant answer to Robert Andrew's flippant question is that the other 87%
live in cloud-cuckoo land (December 11). I am sure, however, that Mr Andrew
well knows that it is not quite as simple as that.
Just because the Conservative Party is temporarily placed in a low position in
opinion polls does not necessarily mean that the 87% referred to by Mr Andrew
are all for a Scottish assembly with tartan-tax-raising powers or, indeed, that
they necessarily believe that an independent Scottish nation could maintain the
current level of prosperity on the taxation raised from the 2.1 million
Scottish taxpayers who contribute to the British tax coffers at present.
The real question that Mr Andrew should be asking is why should Scottish people
be asked to pay more tax than people living in any other part of Britain. The
answer, of course is just to satisfy the lust for power of a handful of Labour
and Lib-Dem politicians who have failed to gain the power they seek at national
level and who have now devised an unworkable, complicated and costly way of
satisfying that lust at the expense of the Scottish people.

THE Princess of Wales charmed the Big Apple last night as she received a major
charity award.
At the New York Hilton she was honoured as Humanitarian of the Year by former
US Secretary of State, Dr Henry Kissinger.
The award by the New York-based United Cerebral Palsy Foundation is in
recognition of the Princess's work for charity, in particular, for her efforts
on behalf of children.
Previous recipients of the award include Lady Thatcher, President Ronald
Reagan, Ms Hillary Clinton, John F Kennedy and Dwight D Eisenhower.
Among guests introduced to the Princess were Donald Trump, Randolph Hearst,
Rupert Murdoch, Gulf war hero General Colin Powell, and veteran singer Tony
Bennett.
She also met New York psychologist and sex therapist Dr Ruth Westheimer who
offered the estranged Princess confidential advice.
``I would ask her to come and talk to me and no one would ever know what we
discussed,'' Dr Ruth, 67, said.
Earlier the Princess of Wales comforted a close friend battling against cancer.
She hosted a private lunch party for Liz Tilberis, the British-born editor of
the American fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar.
Ms Tilberis, 48, is suffering from a cancer she thought she had beaten.
The former editor of British Vogue magazine, who is one of the Princess's
closest friends and confidantes, was diagnosed as having ovarian cancer in 1993
but was given the all-clear at the beginning of this year.
Then in the summer she had to have a bone marrow transplant.
The Princess was said to be ``devastated'' when she heard the news that her
friend still faced a cancer battle.

QUALITY will not be sacrificed to quantity in the expansion of pre-five
education in Scotland, Scottish Office Minister the Earl of Lindsay pledged
yesterday.
He was speaking during a Lords debate on the second reading of the Education
(Scotland) Bill, the most controversial part of which is the Government's plan
to bring in a voucher system for nursery education.
Lord Lindsay told the House: ``The Government is firm in its belief that
parents, and not the providers of education, should decide what kind of
pre-school provision is best suited to their child and to their own
circumstances. Parent choice must be the watchword of the new system.''
The Minister insisted the voucher scheme - which will operate initially on a
pilot basis - would not be means-tested.
He said: ``The voucher system will be supported by rigorous quality assurance
arrangements. Providers other than schools wishing to enter the voucher
arrangements will have to satisfy certain key criteria, including registration
by the local authority under the Children Act 1989.''
From the Labour Front Bench, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove said the Government
must clarify how the proposals on under-five education would operate in areas
where there was currently no State nursery education, and give assurances that
the inspection and regulation procedures would be sufficient to produce
high-quality nursery education.
For the Liberal Democrats, the Earl of Mar and Kellie expressed concern about
how a single voucher scheme would work in rural areas.

<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT Minister is to be asked why a departmental file was secretly
removed and produced for the prosecution in the Lanark blue cheese trial.
Senior Scottish Tory Mr Arthur Bell said yesterday he would ask Food Minister
Angela Browning to investigate what he described as ``a disturbing piece of
evidence''.
Sheriff John Allan, whose judgment saved the cheese from destruction, remarked
on the production of the file - which had not been called for by the court.
He said he was ``mystified'' by what authority it had been released and that an
official of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ``trawled''
through files to find it, then passed it to a Clydesdale District Council
employee.
The file contained an internal minute dealing with a case involving expert food
and health adviser Dr Richard North.
Dr North was a witnesses for Mr Humphrey Errington, the cheesemaker who fought
the council to save 44 batches of cheese.
Mr Bell said yesterday: ``How this file was winkled out and produced for
Clydesdale is a very serious matter. I will ask the Food Minister to
investigate this.''
Mr Bell, who is chairman of the Scottish Tory Reform Group, also called on the
Local Government Audit Commission to investigate legal costs of #350,000 facing
Clydesdale.
Local ratepayers are puzzled as to why the counil's legal team lunched at the
Ristorante La Vigna - Lanark's top Italian diner - on most of their 19 days at
the town's sheriff court. Local ratepayers were also amazed that Dr James
McLaughlin, a top listeria expert and council witness, was on a #500-a-day
retainer plus first-class travel and accom- modation.
Mr Bell said: ``If the auditors find there has been a negligent misuse of
public funds those responsible should be surcharged.
``There is clear evidence that we have seen an exercise in power without
responsibility from the officials at Clydesdale.''
Mr Bell is also demanding that the Scottish Agricultural College in Ayr examine
its scientific methodology after the sheriff said the results of its cheese
tests for listeria monocytogenes were ``not credible''.

IT is about time that so-called ``prominent Scots businessmen'' realise that it
is the electorate and not the business community as a group which has the right
to decide Scotland's constitutional future (December 7).
It was industrialists and their friends in the Conservative Party who claimed
success in stopping the unions holding the country to ransom. It is these same
people who are now doing exactly that in their unjustified attempts to stop the
Scottish electorate choosing independence or the British electorate choosing

SCOTTISH Enterprise chairman Donald MacKay was at the centre of a political
furore yesterday after the Government insisted he had volunteered a #33m cut in
his organisation's budget.
The 7.5% fall had an immediate knock-on effect, not only on the local
enterprise bodies under SE, but caused the same level of reduction in the
budget of Highlands and Island Enterprise.
The details came in the course of the announcement of the Scottish spending
round: an increased St Andrew's House budget was up from #14.25bn to #14.5bn.
It was hailed as ``an extremely good deal'' by the Government.
The increase was disparaged, however, by Labour, who said that allowing for
inflation, the real departmental cuts would range from 4.4% in agriculture to a
massive 21% for housing. Only health would break even.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities claimed the overall increase in
their budget was 0.8% at a time when inflation was 3.2%.
Despite the criticism, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth insisted his budget
reflected demand for a switch in resources to law and order, tourism and health
spending.
Mr Forsyth said he had been considering imposing a 10% cut in the SE budget but
had accepted the case made for a lesser decrease.
However, the real storm broke when Mr Forsyth confirmed at the Scottish Grand
Committee in Edinburgh that following his consultation with Professor MacKay
about the cuts his organisation could bear, the Highlands body was not even
consulted before the same 7.5% budget reduction was imposed.
This provoked a furious onslaught from Opposition MPs, who dubbed Professor
MacKay a ``political puppet'' and the cuts a ``disgrace''.
Mr Forsyth was barracked with calls of ``shocking'' when he announced his
proposals, but he referred to his cutback in Scottish Office refurbishment and
explained: ``I look to all publicly-funded organisations in Scotland to adopt a
similar approach - cut back on administration, raise efficiency and concentrate
on the essentials.
``I am encouraged that our most significant public bodies are leading the way.
Scottish Enterprise, under its chairman Donald MacKay, is prepared to take a
#33m reduction in its planned budget next year and has assured me that on this
budget it can maintain and improve its existing outputs and services.''
He said with its #439m budget next year, SE would still be able to deliver its
objectives, such as training about 35,000 young people and 12,000 adults and
securing about 40,000 jobs.
Professor MacKay said in a statement issued after the Scottish Secretary's
announcement that although nobody likes a budget cut, ``we recognise the
financial constraints across the public sector and, in the light of this,
consider our settlement to be reasonable''.
He said substantial efficiencies had already been achieved and there was
confidence ``of maintaining and improving our outputs and services even on a
reduced budget. We have advised the Secretary of State to this effect.''
An Enterprise source said: ``Surely it is good news for the public that we are
saying no, we don't want that much more of their money.''
However, there was uproar during Mr Forsyth's announcement and during the
following debate highly personal remarks were made about Professor MacKay's
links with the Conservatives, even raising the fact that his son Gregor MacKay
was political adviser to Mr Ian Lang as Secretary of State and had gone with
him to the Board of Trade.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson told the Grand Committee: ``Michael
Forsyth says nothing will be lost. Nobody who knows anything about what
Scottish Enterprise, the local enterprise companies and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise do will believe him for a moment.
``This is a shameful cut and it is particularly shameful that the appointed,
unelected chairman of SE has apparently gone along with it.''
Afterwards, he said he could scarcely believe the Government's admission that
the cut had been effectively volunteered: ``This unelected quango chief has
offered seedcorn cuts at a time when Scottish industry needs all the help it
can get.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ``It is remarkable for the chairman of Scottish
Enterprise to agree to this. What has he been doing with all this existing
budget to date? What has he spent money on that he needn't have? I find this
process of voluntary cuts in his own organisation extremely suspicious.''
Mr Forsyth was scathing of the logic of his opponents, pointing out that
Opposition parties had called for cuts in quango spending.
He told journalists: ``I discussed it with Scottish Enterprise. They indicated
that a 7.5% reduction could be achieved while maintaining our service in key
areas.'' He said he did no discuss the issue with Highlands and Islands
Enterprise.

Amid the current lottery furore,
Margaret Vaughan asks, just who is playing with the rules of the game?
IT IS a mystery wrapped in an enigma. The immediate question that arises from
Richard Branson's startling claim that he was offered a bribe by a lottery
rival concerns the timelag between the alleged incident and the decision to
make it public. Mr Branson says the incident happened two years ago, before the
lottery licence was granted to his arch-rival Camelot. So why now?
The Virgin Atlantic chief told last night's BBC Panorama programme that he was
flabbergasted to be offered an inducement to drop his bid to run the National
Lottery by the head of a US technology company that has a 22% stake in Camelot,
the successful bidder.
No less flabbergasted was the man accused of making the offer, Guy Snowden,
chairman of GTECH, who vehemently denies it ever happened. He wants an
immediate investigation to be conducted by Oflot, the lottery watchdog, as the
only way the ``untrue'' allegations can be put to rest.
Another element of the mystery lies in Mr Branson's claim that he previously
mentioned the matter to the director-general of Oflot, Mr Peter Davis. If he
did it must have slipped Mr Davis' memory. The director-general insists he has
no recollection of it ever being discussed.
Mr Branson claims the bribe was offered at his home in Holland Park, west
London, on September 24 1993, three months before the closing date for offers
to run the lottery. The BBC says it has every faith in Mr Branson's honesty and
integrity. What's more, it has written confirmation from an unnamed third party
who attended the meeting and backs Mr Branson's version of events.
The enigma of why Mr Branson has waited so long to make the bribery accusation
deepens when it seems clear that had he reported the matter at the time it
would undoubtedly have delayed the granting of the licence to Camelot. One
source indicated that Mr Branson was reluctant to make the alleged bribe public
in case it was seen as ``sour grapes''.
But, by any account, the accusation that a bribe has been offered is in itself
a serious charge. It is therefore puzzling that GTECH and Mr Snowden decided to
allow the broadcast, which makes the accusation, to be screened without legal
challenge. The BBC has also said Mr Snowden declined an offer to appear on the
programme.
In a statement issued late yesterday, GTECH said Mr Branson has to explain why
he invited the company to join his consortium and why he has waited so long to
make his accusation.
A Virgin spokesman said that the entrepreneur went public only after the
Panorama team approached him with a number of serious allegations. He was
increasingly concerned at the huge profits Camelot was making.
However, one other explanation may be that Mr Branson genuinely believed at the
time that the Virgin bid to run the lottery on a non-profit basis would be
successful.
It was a full year after losing out to Camelot before he weighed in with public
criticism, since when he has rarely ceased to castigate the consortium for
making far more money than it predicted from what he calls ``a monopoly licence
to print money''.
Mr Branson's public ire at Camelot has involved him in clashes with its
chairman George Russell who is also chairman of the Independent Television
Commission. Last month, coincidentally, Mr Branson took the ITC to court and
won a landmark decision giving Virgin leave to seek judicial review of the
ITC's award of Channel 5 to a rival media group.
The High Court in England ruled that Virgin TV had an arguable case that the
decision was flawed by illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.
Immediately after the court decision, Mr Branson's feelings were clear:
``Perhaps the ITC chairman should now concentrate his efforts on his other role
in life, that of chairman of Camelot.''
The Panorama programme reports that GTECH, a major international player in the
lottery business, has been the subject of six investigations by the FBI in the
United States, where it is based.
A spokeswoman at FBI headquarters in Washington yesterday declined to give any
details of investigations. However, researchers for the programme claim to have
uncovered four investigations which are still current. A further two have been
resolved. One involved a Californian senator who allegedly accepted $13,500
from GTECH. The second involved a trial in Kentucky in which it appeared that
GTECH had been the victim of a fraud, when a sales manager made payments to a
politician. The case involved bogus invoices totalling $71,000. However, the
case was dropped when the court learned that the company was aware of goodwill
payments made by staff.
The other four stakeholders in Camelot are British companies - De La Rue,
Cadbury Schweppes, Racal and ICL.
The programme questioned again the level of profits made by Camelot, pointing
out that by the time its licence expires in 2001 it will have made more than
#300m.
Mr Davis defends the profit levels, pointing out that good causes get five
times as much as Camelot out of the lottery.
Mr Branson has been vociferous in criticising Camelot's profit record since
June this year. For its first full six-month operation period, to the middle of
September, the company made #36m before tax from total takings of #2.5 billion,
just over half of which is paid out in prize money. The controversial Instants
scratch cards have yielded #871m. Camelot argues that the profit was made after
paying the Government more than #300m in lottery duty, while unexpectedly high
sales had yielded #679m for good causes at an increasing rate as sales grew.
Perhaps the largest central mystery of the entire affair is what exactly you
could offer the man who really does have everything he wants; except, of
course, a lottery licence.

S
THE Scottish Churches are calling on their members during this Christmas season
to support one of the most vulnerable groups in our country - those who have
come here looking for asylum from persecution in their home country.
Representatives of the British and Irish Churches, Protestant and Roman
Catholic, expressed their deep concern about this matter at their council
meeting last month. Since then the Government's attitude has become clear in
the Immigration and Asylum Bill now before Parliament.
From January 8, 1996, some 13,000 asylum-seekers will be excluded from Social
Security benefit. This means that the safety net of welfare will be removed
from those who, of all people in our country this Christmas, are least able to
manage without it.
It means that the basic necessities of life, food, shelter, and a place for
their families will be removed by statute from a group which by definition is
peculiarly vulnerable.
From any point of view the changes to be enacted in this Bill are draconian.
From a Christian point of view it militates against the whole thrust of
Biblical teaching. That teaching requires a particular responsibility for the
stranger, the person who comes among us bewildered and in despair, in need of
the very benefits now about to be denied.
On behalf of the Commission of the Scottish Churches, I am writing to encourage
Church members and other people of goodwill to write to their MP before
December 19, when the matter will be decided by Parliament, in the hope that
MPs throughout Scotland will vote against the withdrawal of benefits from
asylum-seekers.

General Secretary,
Action of Churches
Together in Scotland,

FORMER Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken was last night at the centre of new
allegations regarding his claimed involvement with arms sales to the Middle
East.
BBC News and Granada's World in Action programme both broadcast details of a
letter written by Mr Aitken offering the name of a ``trusted contact'' who
could help secure military contracts in Iraq.
They said the letter was sent by Mr Aitken, then a back bench MP, in March 1985
to Mr Gerald James, Chairman of Astra Holdings, an arms firm based in his
Thanet South constituency.
Mr Aitken later joined the board of one of Astra's subsidiaries, BMARC, and was
earlier this year questioned by Customs and Excise officials investigating
illicit arms sales by that firm to Iran.
At the time of the latest letter to come to light, arms sales to both Iraq and
Iran were banned under guidelines drawn up the previous December by the then
Foreign Secretary, Lord Howe.
However, the guidelines were not made public until October 1985, after the
letter was sent, and it is not clear whether Mr Aitken was aware of their
existence.
Mr James is due to give evidence tomorrow to the Commons select committee
investigating arms sales to Iran. Mr Aitken - who has consistently denied any
knowledge of BMARC's links with Iran - is expected to appear before the
committee early in the new year.
The former Treasury Chief Secretary, who is suing World in Action over
allegations in an earlier programme, could not be contacted last night for
comment.

IN what he called ``an extremely good deal'' for Scotland, Secretary of State
Michael Forsyth yesterday shrugged off Opposition criticism to highlight what
had been achieved in his dealings with the Treasury.
He said local government spending was up by more than #100m, council education
spending would increase by 2.7%, and revenue support was #15 more per week in
Scotland per taxpayer.
Within his overall #14.5 billion Scottish budget settlement - more than 35% per
head higher than in England and Wales - he said: ``With freedom for Scots, in
Scotland, to decide how that budget is spent, it is an extremely good deal.
``It does not fall into our lap. It depends on having a Government in
Westminster which is committed to the present funding arrangements and a
Secretary of State for Scotland in the Cabinet to ensure that Scotland's needs
are at the forefront of the Government's concerns. That is not something to be
lightly cast aside.''
This sideswipe at Home Rule, and what he argues is an implied loss of Whitehall
influence, was something Mr Forsyth began with, and repeatedly returned to, as
he pointed out that the block grant to Scotland was 35% higher than for England.
With a spending round below inflation over the next three years as a result of
the policy of reducing public spending to below 40% of domestic product, he
said: ``I have nevertheless been able to find the resources to improve
front-line services and take new initiatives, by reducing bureaucracy,
promoting a fresh drive for efficiency throughout the public sector, and taking
full advantage of the Private Finance Initiative.''
But Labour ridiculed Mr Forsyth's pretence to be a ``tartan Santa'' as
farcical, describing the package as amounting to cuts in real terms of #660m.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ``Taxes up, services cut, jobs
destroyed, training axed, public money wasted, and lies told over and over
again - that is the trademark of this Tory Government. No amount of
publicly-funded propaganda will erase it from the public memory.''
Claiming that Mr Forsyth's fight to save the Barnett funding formula had been a
bogus contest to ``prop up the image of the Stirling struggler'', Mr Robertson
added: ``Either his fight was purely fictional or else the return of the
prodigal Thatcherite to the Scottish Office has put Scotland's block grant at
risk.''
He also contrasted the planned 5% cut in NHS administration with the #89m in
red tape in the health service over the past three years and claimed the
intended extension of the Private Finance Initiative was a cover for
privatisation.
On housing, he added: ``To be cutting back yet again on housing expenditure
when the housing market is in crisis, homelessness is at record levels,
dampness in epidemic, the construction industry is in deep despair, and
thousands of building workers are idle, is economic and social madness.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond scorned the entire Scottish Office budget exercise,
claiming that it demonstrated that under Michael Forsyth St Andrew's House
civil servants were being turned into politicians against their will.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace congratulated Mr Forsyth on his
``effrontery'' in claiming a spending round victory.

<HEADLINE>HOUSING `Savage' housing cuts criticised</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HOUSING bodies described a cut in real terms of more than 20% as ``savage''.
They said Mr Forsyth had announced the worst reductions in 15 years, and
accused him of cheating the homeless and badly-housed.
The criticism centred on funding for Scottish Homes and for Scots councils.
The Labour Party said the housing cut amounted to 21.3%, or #64m, while Shelter
Scotland estimated that actual investment in council housing would fall from an
estimated #433m in the current year to an estimated #341m in 1996-97.
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations said the grant for Scottish
Homes was being reduced in real terms by 17.5%.
Cosla said the spending figures for councils coupled with new controls over the
use of capital receipts meant investment in council housing would be cut by
#300m over the next three years.
The Government was also accused of trying to disguise the size of the
reductions in its presentation of the figures.
Shelter said the Government seemed to be urging councils to transfer their
stock to other landlords. It seemed determined to drive councils into the arms
of new landlords by withholding vital repairs and improvements from them.
Mr Gavin Corbett, Shelter research officer, said: ``For people who are homeless
or on waiting lists the prospects are just as bleak. Housing associations which
have been trying to plug the gap left by councils in recent years will see
their funding squeezed as never before.''
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, whose members' public funding
is channelled through Scottish Homes, said the cut in the agency's budget was
economic madness.
SFHA director David Orr accused Ministers of a breach of faith. He said:
``Housing associations and co-operatives have been trail-blazers at mixing
public and private finance. We have met the Government's demands. The response
is this massive cut. People who are homeless and badly-housed have been
cheated.''
In a statement to the Scottish Grand Committee, Mr Forsyth acknowleged that
Scottish Homes's three-year spending boost of #72m had ended.
It would still have around #280m for its development programme next year and
more than #50m for new projects generating about 4200 new starts. He said the
agency aimed to increase still further its success rate in raising private
finance.
In a written statement, Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson said
substantial resources were being committed to Scottish housing by the Scottish
Office but more must be done draw in additional funding from the private
sector.
Councils should also seriously consider transferring their stock to other
landords.
Net provision for local authority investment in its own stock was being
maintained at planned levels, he said. Taking account of the new rules which
said councils must use 25% of capital receipts to pay off debt, total gross
spending on housing by councils over the period would be nearly #1 billion if
they achieved their receipts targets.

SCOTTISH Enterprise, Scotland's flagship economic development agency, said its
#439m budget for next year was ``reasonable'' and was confident it would be
able to maintain and improve services despite the #33m, or 7.5%, reduction.
The agency said the public should welcome the reduction of expenditure of
taxpayers' money in 1996-97 and stressed that SE should be judged on the
services it delivers and not how much money it spends.
SE chairman Professor Donald MacKay said in a statement: ``Nobody likes a
budget cut. However, we recognise the financial constraints across the public
sector and, in the light of this, consider our settlement to be reasonable.
``Given the substantial efficiencies already achieved by the Scottish
Enterprise Network and with additional measures we have put in hand, we are
confident of maintaining and improving our outputs and services even on a
reduced budget.''
Professor MacKay said the efficiencies would come through:
q Protecting essential programmes, particularly in providing business support.
q Better leverage of private sector funds in providing equity funding and in
delivery of improved infrastructure.
q Continued improvements in training programmes.
q Improved targeting of environmental expenditure in line with the network
strategy published last year.
A spokesman for SE, which employs 1200 staff spread across its network of Local
Enterprise Companies (Lecs), said he doubted whether there would be any
significant number of job losses as a result of the budget cut, adding that it
was too early to say how the money would be dispersed among the various blocks
of expenditure and between individual Lecs. SE is expected to establish its
formula for dispersal in January.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which has 10 Lecs, said it will work even
harder to make its resources go further next year after receiving a #74.77m
budget from the Scottish Office.
HIE chairman Fraser Morrison said he was disappointed at the agency's
allocation - which represents a 4% cut on current spending of #77.75m - but
recognised that, in the current public expenditure squeeze, HIE had succeeded
in retaining what he called a healthy budget.

MORE than 12,000 existing and potential jobs, many of them involving Scots,
will be lost as a result of a decision to scrap plans to build two nuclear
power stations.
British Energy - which will own Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear when the
industry is privatised next year (without the ageing Magnox stations which will
remain in the public sector) - has decided against proceeding with either
Sizewell C in Suffolk or Hinkley C in Somerset.
An application to build a new power station at Sizewell, alongside two existing
stations, at a cost of #3bn will be withdrawn and planning consent to build a
new station at Hinkley, again alongside two existing stations, at a cost of
#1.87bn, which was given following a long-running public inquiry will not be
used.
The decision delighted anti-nuclear campaigners who now predict the death of
nuclear power. But unions were dismayed at the lost job opportunities and
accused the company of ``throwing in the towel'' ahead of the industry's
privatisation next summer.
The Sizewell station would have taken seven years to build and created up to
6000 construction jobs in the area, as well as another 8000 throughout the
country. When complete the station would have employed 450 operating staff.
The new station at Hinkley would have created around 4500 construction jobs
over a six-year period. Planning permission was given in 1990.
British Energy's chief executive, Dr Robert Hawley, said yesterday that the new
company was drawing up its business strategy with the aim of creating a robust
private sector company with long-term viability.
``This will require the development of a balanced portfolio of assets. New
nuclear building will be a part of this strategy provided it offers an
appropriate return to shareholders.''
Dr Hawley said he was proud of the new Sizewell B power station which opened
earlier this year and which was now performing well but ``at present the future
of UK energy prices is insufficiently certain for British Energy to invest in
new nuclear or indeed in any other form of new generation in the short term.
``Our current priority throughout the group is the successful privatisation of
British Energy next summer.''
Nuclear Electric maintained there would be no direct job losses at the company
as a result of yesterday's decision.
However, the industry's trade unions warned of ``thousands'' of job losses,
mainly among construction workers but also among nuclear industry employees and
those of plant manufacturers including the likes of Babcock and Weir.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union's executive
member for Scotland, said the unions were not at all surprised by the decision
which fitted in with the company's obvious desire to join the ``dash for gas''.
It was another classic case of short-termism triumphing over the long term
strategic plans for Britain's energy needs, he added.
Environmental campaign group Greenpeace welcomed the decision and claimed it
signalled the end of the nuclear industry. Ms Bridget Woodman, the group's
nuclear campaigner, said: ``British Energy has finally accepted what everyone
else has realised for the past six or seven year. No-one in their right minds
would put money into building a new nuclear power station when they are so
risky financially and environmentally.''

q ONE of France's most militant farm unions has urged the French Government to
ban all imports of cattle and sheep from Britain to prevent an outbreak of
``mad cow'' disease.
Rural Co-ordination said the ban should apply to live animals and carcasses.
``Above all, do not have any scruples towards the English because if they were
in our place you can be sure they would have already shut their frontiers,''
the union said in an open letter to French Farm Minister Philippe Vasseur.

Ship shunned
WELLINGTON: A visit to New Zealand by a replica of Captain James Cook's sailing
ship the Endeavour has reopened racial wounds, 225 years after the vessel first
anchored there. Some Maori elders in Gisborne, on the east coast of the North
Island, said the replica would not be welcome in their region because of what
they called ``atrocities'' inflicted on Maoris by the British explorer and his
men.

WHEN an ancient gourmet of afternoon teas talked about German biscuits, it was
an aging moment to be the only one harkening to him who knew what he was on
about.
They were, they are, double biscuits which sandwich jam. They come layered with
icing. Essentially, a cherry tops them. German biscuits are as they always
were. During the Kaiser's war, however, they had a name change. They got redone
as empire biscuits. For a time they were called imperial. Changes of label can
affect lives as much as real changes. Although nothing has been altered,
generations get separated. For an example, take Lewis's.
It was, it is, a big store in Argyle Street, Glasgow. It stands where it always
did and looks the same from outside. Call it Lewis's, though, and you have a
social problem. For a start, you've got the name wrong. The shop sign says
something else. But a bigger problem is to be seen as out of touch and, dearie
me, out of date. Street-wise and young people look at you askance.
But it was ever thus on that part of the city's plainstones. Lewis's was not
timeless. Mature shoppers of a previous generation called the shop something
else. They looked at a sign above the door that said Lewis's but pronounced it
Poly.
Embraced by the nickname was much customer satisfaction that a genius of a
shopkeeper had engendered. How he minded his store was cheaply. At this time of
year when retailers are king some stray paragraphs fall due to the emperorship
of John Anderson.
He was a draper but not an ordinary one. His secret was to make shopping
exciting. In the business jargon of his time he went in for what was called
``universal trading''. It meant he started to sell more than just frocks.
At his shop on the Gorbals side of the Clyde he added toys, perfumes, patent
medicines. Profitable growth added branches, but literally. Instead of opening
other shops, he kept sprouting extra storeys, one after the other, to his South
Side emporium.
Distance was no object to John Anderson. When Paris in l848, as now, was in
turmoil, he nipped over to pick up French creations at cut prices. Bargains
were all to him.
On such foundations he created palatial new premises in Argyle Street for his
Royal Polytechnic. Hence, Poly. Long after the site had been rebuilt the
nickname persisted just as now some of us see Debenhams but still say Lewis's.
In l929 when Lewis's Investment Trust bought over the local ownership, much
Glasgow grumping followed about how shops were becoming all the same.
``Everything and everybody (was one elderly moan) are to be absorbed, merged,
amalgamated, trustified, consolidated, federated, combined, associated,
grouped, chained, and generally boiled together until a lump appears.''
It was not the last time such complaints were heard in the land. Some of us
still think it is worth going on about the sameness of main streets. Like by
the rings of a tree, people's ages can be told by the shop names that they miss
- Wylie and Lochhead, Watt and Milne; Robert Maule, Darling, Patrick Thomson;
Dalys and Dallas's; Cochran's; Fraser and Love.
Names of picture houses have suffered worse from the vandalism of business
fashion. Each generation of money-makers suffers an itch that will not allow
them to leave well alone. So are changed for customers the addresses of
favourite places. If you insist on saying Regal for the cinema on Sauchiehall
Street, it is felt you should not be allowed out to the pictures alone at night.
And if you are overheard to recall that there was a Paramount in Renfield
Street, there will be wags eager to inform you that there are movies now which
talk.
Compared with elsewhere, changes in the vocabulary of its geography could be
especially brisk in Glasgow. For instance, it is a city divided by its tube
trains. They began, in l897, as Glasgow District Subway Company. But say Subway
instead of Underground and you are seen as a steam-age creature.
It leads to the kind of heavily patient treatment a fogey receives in an
ice-cream shop when he asks for a macallum.
Even in Glasgow some names change readily. After some rough edginess, the rub
of history quickly enough smoothed the altered address of Nelson Mandela Place.
And, despite apparently profound business alterations, some things don't change
at all. To passengers of all ages the orange buses remain Corpie buses. There
is a small third category of words which change back. With agreeable frequency,
young people have taken to saying wireless rather than radio. They can be heard
describing miscellaneous sweeties as jujubes. In some bakers' shops fly
cemeteries, otherwise fruit slices, have gone back to being called fruit cakes.
Which with one bound brings the subject back to German biscuits where, if you
remember, this meander began. With every day that passes, German becomes
altogether apter than imperial.
Sometimes it happens that people whose turn of speech stays behind the times
find themselves right back in the van of fashion. It is a question of waiting
long enough.
Chances are, however, that before empire biscuits return to the name they were
born with, intense Euro debate will have to happen, along with much agonising
about loss of sovereignty. Some of us can't hang about that long.

WESTMINSTER journalists these days walk about the place with their heads in a
spin. No, it isn't spending too much time in the Palace bars. It's the spin
doctors.
The Sketch has been around long enough to remember the old days when some
politicians said or did something and we all rushed to our typewriters (Mummy
and Daddy can explain to younger readers what these were) and duly reported
them.
Now, it's not so simple. You come out of the Press Gallery or wherever and are
greeted by friendly persons from the political parties who say something like:
``Well you know what that was really all about, don't you?'' Then they tell you
and sometimes it isn't what you thought it meant at all. A rival spin doctor
spins his or her tale and that might indicate something quite different again.
The doctors' bosses sometimes arrange little treats for media they think might
be helpful to them. It was in the spirit that, recently, a stern warning by
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, to the judges that, be they ever so high,
Parliament was above them, was leaked to a newspaper whose loyalty to the Major
Government, if not to its own high Tory principles, has wavered of late.
The only trouble was that, on re-reading his draft, Lord Mackay decided that
the dinner at which he was to speak was an inappropriate venue for such
thunderings and told a few jokes instead. The result - considerable
embarrassment for Tory Central Office, which had leaked the contents, and for
Tory Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney.
Labour was in full cry yesterday after the details of this ``leak that never
was''. In particular, had the Lord Chancellor's draft, apparently passed round
Cabinet Ministers, been leaked without his knowledge? From the indignation of
Lord Mackay's subsequent declaration, this seemed likely.
Happily for them, no less an authority than the Deputy Prime Minister was up
for questioning. As Mr Heseltine and Dr Mawhinney meet almost daily to plan
Tory tactics and attempt to spot banana skins to avoid, he seemed the ideal
person to ask.
Why had no-one noticed the banana residue attached to the envelope of the draft
speech? Even if he had not delivered it, enquired Mr John Prescott, posing a
rare comprehensible question, had Lord Mackay intended to give the judges a
wigging?
The DPM, with the resources of a vast computer diary at his disposal and the
benefit of these regular meetings with Dr Mawhinney, said this matter had
already been fully explained. If Mr Prescott put questions down to the
appropriate Ministers, he ``will be told what he has been told before''.
This explained the exceptionally long barge pole that the DPM had been seen
bringing with him into the Chamber.
The Tory infantry mounted a diversion. Mr Michael Fabricant (Mid Staffordshire)
attacked Mr Peter Mandelson, ``that sinister spin doctor''. The MP for
Hartlepool and one of the founding fathers of New Labour, is the only
recognised top-class spinner who is also an MP.
Labour counter-attacked with allegations of ``an invasion of the spin doctors''
which sounded like one of those cheapy sci-fi movies of the sixties. The
Government had hired nine more according to Mr Bruce Grocott (The Wrekin) but
whether some came from outer space he did not specify.
Mr Heseltine hit back. If we were talking about politicising the Civil Service,
the only example of this he could remember came from, wait for it, Labour. He
conjured up a name from the past - Mr Joe Haines who had been dropped into the
pristine ranks of the Civil Service as press officer at No.10 by Harold Wilson
in the early seventies after years of propagandising with the rough trade of
the Daily Mirror. And now a certain Mr Alastair Campbell, from the same stable,
was ``travelling round the lobbies of this country'' cried Mr Heseltine,
indignation getting the better of sense, announcing that he was heading for the
same destination.
Hezza rested his case without answering the real question to which everyone
wanted the answer thus showing he has something in common with the spin doctors
- they rarely do either.

THE Scottish Sports Council welcomed the news that its grant was to be
maintained at last year's level.
It will receive #8.5m, as last year, and despite there being no allowance for
inflation, chief executive Allan Alstead could not disguise his relief.
``When you look at what happened in England, a cut of almost 5% from #49.824m
to #47.466m, you would have to say we have not suffered significantly,'' said
Mr Alstead. ``We welcome the efforts which Mr Robertson and Mr Forsyth have
made on our behalf.
``This will enable us to continue projects focusing on youth sport and
excellence. As for the inflation shortfall, we hope we can generate additional
funds from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and the Youth Sport Trust.
``We will make economies where we can, but there will be no redundancies.''

A NASTY showdown between rival gangs involving ugly city centre scenes
yesterday demonstrated the value of capturing such confrontations on
closed-circuit television.
The grisly images of appalling rowdyism, although only slightly less fun than
watching unwitting couples captured on camera having sex in lifts, may yet
feature on a pirate video on general release for Christmas. However, most of
those captured on camera yesterday should clearly never be allowed on general
release at all.
The violent footage shot in Edinburgh showed a much larger gang, about 24
strong and extremely hostile, surrounding a small group of five who were simply
going about their government business at the time.
Those rounded on included a pensioner from Dumfries, a couple of belligerants
from Ayr and Aberdeen, and a grey businessman who appeared to have wandered
into the wrong movie. Luckily, they were led by one extremely streetwise
fighter who repeatedly talked his way out of trouble in spite of taunts from
the baying crowd opposite.
Mickey ``F'', as this gangleader is known, repeatedly turned round the barbs
and insults of the rival ``New-L'' gang in a strange turf-war ritual knows as
the ``Scottish Grand Committee''. The argument was about something called the
Scottish Block Grant, otherwise known as a large paper bag containing #14
billion in used notes.
Also present at the confrontation were two smaller gangs who looked on. The
leader of one, aka ``Smiling Jim'', seemed far too good-natured for this mean
city scene, while the other, ``Cold Alex'', is believed to have connections
with some European heavies. Both hurled the odd insult but did not inflict any
actual injury.
Large crowds of heavy characters at the back of the New-L gang loomed
menacingly, occasionally leaping to their feat angrily, while among the
flashing blades at the front the New-L leader Big George and his moll, Helen,
who was previously involved with another gangleader who died in a yachting
accident, struggled to contain the slippery Mickey ``F''.
Meanwhile the two main factions fought over a series of conflicts, known by
mysterious acronyms recognised only within their peculiar gang culture - SE,
Lecs, HIE, SO, DAFS, RSG, GNP, and PSBR.
There was even something called CCTV, which Mickey ``F'' was calling out for.
This is apparently closed circuit television to monitor city-centre
disturbances, but why he was calling for this when the whole thing was already
being filmed was never made clear.

TONY BLAIR'S hysterical outpourings over the ``tartan tax'' surely illustrate
most vividly that Labour and their leader are firmly impaled on the horns of a
dilemma. Whenever a political party is reduced to name-calling and talk of lies
it is the case that it is in serious trouble.
Messrs Blair and Robertson accuse the Tories of scaremongering and claim that
the 3p on tax could go down as well as up.
Perhaps it would be possible in the wonderful new socialist Scotland, predicted
by the Constitutional Convention, for a reduction to take place, but it would
be as likely as a blue moon, when one considers the impact of the salaries and
expenses of the new parliamentarians, to say nothing of the cost of the Social
Chapter and the minimum wage, to both of which Mr Blair is unswervingly
committed.
Michael Forsyth is quite entitled to point to the impact of an increase in tax.
Indeed the Secretary of State has struck a tender spot in Labour's armoury.
Even if the public believe that Mr Blair may reduce tax in Scotland rather than
increase it, there is another problem. The moment Scottish tax is lowered,
Westminster is going to insist upon a re-examination of the Goschen-Barnett
formula, which allows Scotland a very favourable adjustment whenever an
increase in the block grant to the Scottish Office is calculated.
Mr Blair has totally failed to address this question. To lower tax in one part
of the UK would lead to the dissension and the eventual break-up of the United
Kingdom.

It's ticket-selling, but not as we know
it. Geraldine Abrahams examines the
newly-launched centre that has boldly
gone to develop new ways of working
TWENTY years ago the idea of a one-stop ticket centre in Glasgow might have
been seen as unnecessary; but since then the city has earned a reputation as
one of Britain's major entertainment centres - and today the need for
super-efficient and comprehensive box office/information and support service
has never been greater.
Now the Ticket Centre in Candleriggs has boldly taken up that challenge -
having just reopened after a major refurbishment which immediately impresses
the visitor with its magnificent state-of-the-art front office. Designed by
architects A McInness Gardiner, the space-age public counter area reflects the
sophistication of the surrounding Merchant City - and of the inner-office
operation.
Bob Palmer, director of Glasgow City Council's Department of Performing Arts
and Venues which manages the Ticket Centre, hails it as a ``a performance in
itself - an example of architecture as theatre, a building which would intrigue
and entertain the visitor as much as the event for which they were buying
tickets''.
The drum-shaped display area has a Starship Enterprise feel to it, a theme on
which manager Steven Miller happily builds - ``We are going where no man has
gone before'' - and indeed, beyond the facade is one of the most futuristic and
technically-advanced offices in the city.
The whole computer system and communications infrastructure has been upgraded.
David Balkind, head of commercial development and communications at the
Department of Performing Arts and Venues, explains: ``In this area we have
developed the telephone room which has been built to the highest standard for
call centres. We now have a 25-seat phone room, dealing with more than 40,000
calls a month - just under a half million in the calendar year.
``Typically, we deal with #10.5 million worth of ticket sales across a range of
venues and products - from classical music and theatre to sails down the Clyde.
We have a link with around a dozen sites around the city and over the year we
do about 1.75 million tickets through ourselves and the network. We are
contracted to be the phone resource for many venues and projects.''
This is all backed up with the latest in electronic technology linking the
centre with the various sites, storing three million pages of data (a further
4.5 million pages are stored elsewhere) and at the other end of a fibre-optic
channel is the centre's own information super-highway.
While the design and technology of the Ticket Centre is top class, none of that
would be of any value without highly-trained staff. Surprisingly, while there
is a small core staff, the majority of people working in this office have
``casual'' contracts.
``We try to maximise the core staffing but the nature of the job means a
reliance on some casual workers,'' says David Balkind. ``We need a flexible
staff because, while we have around 1,500 calls a day when quiet, this can rise
to 6,000 on a busy morning.
``But `casual' does not mean lower standard or less respected or less skilled.
As far as we can, we equip everyone with all that's needed to deal effectively
with customers.''
Almost two years ago, a customer care programme was launched for all Ticket
Centre staff and cascaded to some of the venues - a ``Ringing the Changes''
programme in conjunction with the Council's training department. ``We basically
set up four formal modules for all staff, built full training resource packs
and laid down objectives which included induction, operational environment,
venue and product knowledge, telephone sales skills,'' explains David Balkind.
``We are now into a team-leader training programme, floor-management programme
and management programme, with all operators going through the basic
training.'' Training is carried out in-house by manager Miller and his
supervisors, with the aim of standardising work practices. This is followed by
skills audits and feedback procedures. Some recent market research involved
focus groups of customers determining 18 service attributes which included
courtesy, speed, accuracy, promotion of events, selling, time taken to get
through, and the nature of counter-queueing systems.
In another research exercise, around 300 customers were surveyed and
satisfaction levels measured. This survey, which reflected well on the service
provided, also showed customers to be very keen on personal, friendly reception.
Vital to the training at the Ticket Centre are regular updates, when new venues
and products come on the system. There is a cascade briefing system and the
staff is organised in groups, with new information passed to them on a weekly
basis - ``We have help screens on the system and these take them through
new-product updates''.
There is also a newly-introduced ``help desk'' where people can refer calls.
This is better equipped with more information and may lead to the piloting of
an information-only line in the New Year.
With the future possibilities, the Ticket Centre is likely to take on new staff
over the next year or so, and it will be looking for the same attributes in the
new staff as is expected from existing employees.
``We would be looking for reasonable maturity and a good telephone manner,''
says David Balkind. ``Our needs are very flexible in age, gender and experience
and, while a certain level of numeracy and literacy would be expected, we feel
we can equip our staff with everything else.''
Such jobs tend to suit women returners and perhaps graduates who have not yet
moved on to their specific fields of study. There are also those people who are
interested in theatre and music and who see such employment as a way of finding
out about the performing arts. Recruiting tends to be carried out with a group
of between six and twelve peope at a time so that they can be trained
effectively.
The future of the Ticket Centre and the network looks very bright, according to
David Balkind. ``We are moving ahead into new areas and we hope to have our
first Edinburgh site in the early new year in conjunction with the Scottish
Claymores. The situation is constantly evolving. And as long as people want a
great night out, we'll sell the tickets.''

A FISHING boat sailed into Lerwick yesterday, and was immediately told to sail
back out again, and take a suspected depth charge with it.
The crew had hauled it up and kept it on deck for about a week. They thought it
was an old oil drum.
Bomb disposal experts are expected this morning on board the Kirkcaldy
registered trawler lying about a mile off Lerwick.
The alarm was sounded after the Integrity III sailed into Lerwick to load ice
at a pier less than 500 yards from two crowded shopping centres.
A shore-based worker realised that what the crew had thought to be a harmless
rusty oil drum, bore a close resemblance to a Second World War depth charge
packed with high explosives.
Harbour master Captain David Polson was alerted and he immediately ordered the
trawler to leave Lerwick for a safe anchorage just north of the port.
The skipper and three-man crew were reported as having refused to leave the
boat, wanting to stay on board until the bomb disposal crew arrived. But it was
disclosed they had later been taken off.
Coastguard and harbour authorities were prepared to monitor the boat throughout
the night. ``It seems they had it on board for several days since they trawled
it up off the island of Fetlar. It looks like a depth charge,'' Captain Polson
said.
``It is rusted through and you can see stuff inside it and the end hanging off.
As it dries out it could be dangerous.''
A spokesman for Shetland Coastguard said they had been told by experts that as
the ``drum and its contents begin to dry out the explosive material becomes
more volatile''.
Before they were taken off the crew were advised to keep the device wet by
hosing its casing. Their names were not being released last night.

FRENCH Prime Minister Alain Juppe said today that he was open to wider talks
with unions on employment issues in a new move to appease strikers who have
crippled France for 18 days.
Mr Juppe, speaking after a series of meetings with union leaders, said he had
asked Labour Minister Jacques Barrot to begin organising round-table talks with
unions next week. However, his core welfare reforms were not mentioned in a
list of topics he suggested could be included.
``I have asked Mr Barrot to prepare for next week an initial meeting with all
of the unions and professional organisations on the smajor issue which is at
the root of all of our concerns - that is to say jobs,'' Juppe told reporters.
He said the talks could cover youth employment, improving working conditions,
and reducing working hours. He made no mention, however, of including in the
talks the social security reform proposals on which he has staked his political
future and which he has said he plans to implement by decree.
Juppe spoke to reporters as striking unions prepared for a new round of mass
demonstrations across France tomorrow.
Perhaps sensing that Juppe was searching for a way out of the crisis, Force
Ouvriere leader Marc Blondel had, after meeting the premier, demanded ``global
negotiations'' on wages and unemployment as well as the withdrawal of Juppe's
social security plan.
However, the welfare reform looked set to be implemented by decree from this
week in Parliament, where the centre-right coalition has a four-fifths majority.
Today, public transport remained at a standstill with all trains and Paris
underground Metro and bus services halted by the strike, bringing huge
rush-hour traffic jams around the capital.
One-fifth of teachers, 4% of postal workers, and many electricity and telephone
workers remained on strike.
In a sign that the action may be slowing, however, the number of civil servants
who stayed away from work slipped to 13.5% from 19% on Friday, according to the
government.-Reuter.

THE normally cloistered halls of Glasgow University were reverberating
yesterday to the sound of two of Scotland's most eminent figures publicly
clashing over an unusual contest to become university chancellor.
Mr Ian Hamilton, leading QC and anti-establishment figure, has thrown down the
gauntlet by claiming the first election for the title to be held in almost a
quarter of a century is skewed in favour of his opponent, Sir William Fraser,
who retired this summer as the university's principal.
In a strongly-worded letter to the university registrar, Mr Hamilton says he is
challenging the arrangements made for the election on the grounds that they are
unfair. Speaking to The Herald yesterday, he called on Sir William to withdraw
his candidature.
``I entered this election as an ordinary graduate challenging a public figure
who, as a senior civil servant, principal and now candidate for chancellor, is
stretching out for a job too far. I seek only an equal chance to compete with
him,'' he said.
Mr Hamilton's unhappiness centres on a number of procedural issues. He claims
that, contrary to the university's rules, when voting papers were sent out to
members of the general council they were accompanied by a magazine containing
two and a half pages ``of publicity'' for Sir William and no mention of his
candidature.
He also criticised the voting procedure for not being in secret and said,
unlike his rival, his description did not appear on the ballot paper.
``This is probably the only election in the free world where there isn't a
secret ballot. It is medieval. They insist that everyone who votes must sign
the voting paper.''
Mr Hamilton said that Sir William was responsible earlier this year for signing
the new rules under which the election is being carried out. ``Sir William
should do the honourable thing,'' he added. ``He is an honourable man. He is
responsible for this mess. He signed the ordinance under which this election is
being run.''
The problems with the election were not the result of deliberate action, he
added. ``It is just an example of how any establishment would be. They don't
care for the little man coming from the outside to challenge their nominated
candidate.''
More than 70,000 general council members, made up of graduates and members of
staff, are entitled to vote in the postal ballot. The chancellor is the titular
head of the university and elected for life, with no remuneration.
Sir William yesterday appeared unruffled by the criticism, saying he would not
be withdrawing his candidature.
``The conduct of the election is a matter for the university,'' he said. ``The
simple fact is that the chancellor decided to retire in January. If Mr
Hamilton's view is that coincidence of my retirement as principal and the
chancellor's retirement disqualifies me from standing then I simply don't agree
with him.''
Sir William also said that the fact that the university magazine had been sent
out with the ballot papers was a coincidence.
``The magazine contains material which derives from my retirement as
principal,'' he said. ``Let's be clear about this. The chancellor decided to
retire from January next year. It was suggested to me that I should stand.
``The fact that there is material in the university magazine about my
retirement is associated with my retirement. That is a simple fact. If I had
not stood as chancellor that material would have appeared anyway.''
As for a secret ballot, he said: ``I don't know if it was ever considered. I
wouldn't be against it, of course, but again it is a matter for the
university.''
In a statement issued yesterday afternoon, a spokesman for Glasgow University
said the election was being carried out in accordance with the appropriate
rules which had been approved by the Privy Council.
He added: ``The candidates are described on the ballot paper and the list of
candidates, circulated to voters, in the terms they used to describe
themselves.''
The outcome of the ballot will be announced in January. The current contest has
been prompted by the decision of the chancellor, Sir Alex Cairncross, to stand
down - the first chancellor in the university's history to do so. The last
election was held in 1971. Eight candidates stood and around 20% of the general
council voted.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard's controversial package to clamp down on
``bogus'' asylum seekers and illegal immigrants was backed by the Commons last
night, despite fierce resistance from Opposition parties and human rights
campaigners.
Mr Howard identified India and Poland as among countries which generate large
numbers of claims for asylum in Britain ``but few if any genuine cases'' when
he moved the second reading of the Asylum and Immigration Bill.
He named them in the first ``white list'' of countries whose citizens are
deemed safe from political persecution. Asylum applications from nationals of
these countries are likely to be processed more quickly with a presumption that
it is unlikely that claimants will be in danger if returned home.
The other ``white list'' countries are Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ghana, Pakistan and
Romania. Countries could be taken off or added to the list if conditions in
them changed, he said.
MPs later voted 314 to 287, a Government majority of 27, rejecting a move to
send the Bill to a special standing committee which the Opposition proposed as
a way of removing the political heat from the issue.
Labour said such a body would ensure new procedures were fair and allow experts
on racial issues to give evidence on their likely effects.
During the debate, Mr Howard asked to Tory cheers: ``Why should genuine
refugees from Iran or Iraq have to wait longer for a decision because we give
equal time and weight to the thousands of bogus claims from countries like
Poland and India.''
Plaid Cymru leader Dafydd Wigley said there were fears that people could be
deported ``to their deaths''. However, Mr Howard said he did not foresee any
reduction in the number of genuine applicants who would be accepted.
For Labour, Mr Jack Straw said the party was voting against the Bill and
condemned the ``white list'' because it would place ``what may be almost an
impossible burden of proof'' on applicants from the countries on it.
He claimed the Conservative Party was ``ready to stir up racial tension in a
desperate effort to garner votes''.
Tory Jim Lester (Broxtowe) joined warning voices against the proposals, saying:
``We are creating a sub-culture of totally dispossessed people.''
Mr Lester, chairman of the Africa Committee of the British Refugee Council
said: ``My concern is that the rules will be used to the detriment of genuine
asylum seekers.''
However, Tory right-winger Tony Marlow (Northampton North) warned of ethnic
bloodshed, akin to Ulster and the former Yugoslavia, if immigration to the UK
was not curbed.''
Amnesty International said last night that there were serious concerns about
the human rights records of some of the countries on the list.
Mr Claude Moraes, the director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of
Immigrants, said that the list could be extended to cover countries where the
risks were even greater.
``He can list these countries today for propaganda value but tomorrow he could
designate a country like Nigeria, Sri Lanka or Algeria,'' he said.
Former Shadow Home Secretary Roy Hattersley (Sparkbrook) told the Commons:
``This is a deplorable Bill and it is even more squalid because it is
unnecessary.
``I have no doubt at all that the Government's intentions with this Bill are
political. It is supposed to improve morale in the Tory Party and in so doing
challenge the Labour Party and embarrass it.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr David Alton said: ``Justice should be the issue,
not numbers. All the evidence points not to bogus applications but to bogus
refusals and unjust determinations.''
Former Shadow Home Secretary Gerald Kaufman (Manchester Gorton) said: ``This
Bill has got racial prejudice built right into it.''
``I, as a Jew, find it utterly intolerable that anybody should introduce
legislation which doesn't affect me now, but would have affected my parents and
would have affected parents on the opposite side of the House too.''
Tory former Immigration Minister Charles Wardle (Bexhill and Battle), who quit
the Government over concern on European border controls policy, said: ``The
great majority of people in this country, regardless of ethnic origin,
recognise that illegal immigration is a serious and growing problem.''
For the Scottish National Party, Ms Roseanna Cunningham (Perth and Kinross)
said she found ``almost all the Bill objectionable''.
Condemning aspects of the measure which restrict asylum seekers' entitlement to
housing and child benefit, she protested: ``It seems to me the Government
appears to be trying to starve people out of the country.''

ANOTHER body has rejected the voucher scheme. The broad-based Forum on Scottish
Education concluded that it was deeply flawed and should be abandoned, (writes
Barclay McBain).
The Government wants councils, private nurseries, and the voluntary playgroup
sector to compete for the vouchers, which will be valued at #1100 and will be
available for parents to ``buy'' a place for their children in the year before
they start school.
The voucher will pay for a part-time place at a nursery or a full-time place at
a playgroup.
Only seven councils have expressed an interest in taking part in a pilot to
test the scheme. More than 80% of respondents to a Scottish Office consultation
programme rejected vouchers.
In its response the forum, which represents the churches, local authorities,
teachers' unions, and parents' groups, said the simplest and most effective way
to increase nursery education was to make extra funding available to education
authorities.
The Rev. John Taylor, chairman of the forum, yesterday described the initiative
as an assisted places scheme ``for tiny tots'' because some vouchers would be
given to parents who were already spending about #1500 on private nursery
provision.

ALASTAIR Mackenzie concluded his diatribe against Ruth Wishart with the
observation that ``the emotional fantasies propounded by Ruth Wishart and her
like, if they were ever implemented, would reduce the Scottish nation, in the
longer term, to a second-rate banana republic'' (December 7).
It is a sad truth that such a status would be a step up for the Scottish
nation. Currently, as a nation, we have no political status at all.

CONTROVERSIAL Norwegian football agent Rune Hauge was yesterday indefinitely
banned worldwide from involvement in any more transfer dealings.
FIFA also issued a warning to players, clubs, and national football
associations that they would face punishment if they had any future involvement
with the Scandinavian.
Hauge was suspended earlier this year after his involvement in the George
Graham ``bung'' affair was revealed.
It was Hauge who gave the former Arsenal manager #440,000 in cash following the
transfers to the north London club of Norwegian Pal Lydersen and Dane John
Jensen.
The revelations cost Graham - who subsequently repaid the cash to the Highbury
club - his job and also brought a 12-month ban from the FA.
Hauge's involvement brought his suspension from FIFA's list of licenced
players' agents and clubs were warned not to use him.
But Hauge has ignored the ban, using an intermediary to become involved in the
#840,000 transfer of Swedish international defender Pontus Kamark to Leicester
from Gothenburg.
Hauge also advised fellow Norwegian Lars Bohinen over his switch from
Nottingham Forest to Blackburn for a mere #750,000, a transfer negotiated
through Danish intermediary Frank Mathieson.
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said in Paris last night that the decision to
withdraw Hauge's licence had been taken by yesterday's meeting of the
organisation's executive committee.
``We have paid special attention to the situation regarding Rune Hauge,'' said
Cooper. ``His licence was suspended some months ago when it was discovered he
was implicated in the affair concerning George Graham.
``Since then he has been officially suspended from transfer activities but it
has become evident that during his suspension he has continued to operate, even
if through an intermediary, in the transfer of players despite his suspension.''
Cooper added that FIFA were determined that Hauge would not be allowed to flout
the ban, indicating that action would be taken against any player or club who
used his services.
``When we introduced the system of licenced agents on January 1 we knew it
would be difficult to impose but were determined to do so,'' he said. ``FIFA
hopes people will work with the system, rather than against it.
``We will not take any action against players or clubs who have used Hauge
during the period of his suspension but we are making it clear that in future
any individuals or clubs who avoid our decisions will face the consequences
themselves.''
Cooper refused to be drawn on what any potential punishment might be but he
made it clear that pressure would be put on the FA and other national
federations to ensure clubs and players under their jurisdiction took heed of
the decision.
``We call on all associations to support our policy and for them to call on
their clubs to adhere more strictly to our system and ensure transfers are
conducted only by recognised individual agents.''
q.SOUTH Korea, bidding to stage the 2002 World Cup finals, are confident they
can offer the finest and most lucrative tournament in the history of the event.
``We believe we can meet all FIFA's requirements and stage the most remarkable
of World Cup tournaments,'' bidding committee general secretary Song Young-shik
said in Paris.
Song said South Korea had estimated total revenue from ticket sales, television
rights, and merchandising at a record $627m.
The local organising committee planned to donate its share of the competition's
surplus to benefit the game, he added.
``This means that at least $78m could be used for the development of football
worldwide,'' Song said.
``Because of our proven ability to organise major events and our heritage as
Asia's most successful footballing nation, we feel we have the right to host
Asia's first World Cup finals,'' said Song.
South Korea, who hosted the Olympics in Seoul in 1988 and qualified for the
last three World Cup finals, are in competition with Japan, who also are
promoting their bid in the French capital.
Song said South Korea could provide superb facilities with 16 stadiums
including 11 new ones, a modern transportation infrastructure, many large
hotels, and high-tech communication equipment.
A FIFA inspection team went to South Korea last month and were pleased with
what they saw, Song said.
``We were very proud to hear the leader of the team say that he could not see
any weak point in our bid.''
FIFA will decide the venue next June.

THE World Cup draw will take place at the Louvre this afternoon and yesterday
the various delegations from the 173 competing countries were straggling into
Paris, beating the delays which surround the city.
More than 1200 people will attend the ceremony with 764 journalists from around
the world and it is there that Scotland will discover the problems they will
face on the hoped-for journey to the finals in France in 1998.
But, already, preparations are being made to ease their struggle.
The Scottish League will postpone matches because they realise the fixture
problems the country will face.
Even more important, they have been involved in talks with the Premiership in
England to ensure that any disruptions to teams will be minimal as regards the
selection of players.
This is a two-way deal, of course. England manager Terry Venables has
maintained that Paul Gascoigne will be a major part of his World Cup bid.
Therefore, if the national fixtures of both Scotland and England can be
dove-tailed, allowing Gascoigne the freedom to join Venables and other players
the freedom to join manager Craig Brown, then everything should work smoothly.
Brown will be looking at skipper Gary McAllister, Scot Gemmill, Billy McKinlay,
and Craig Burley, for example.
League secretary Peter Donald said: ``We have had preliminary talks with the
Premiership officials and have agreed that we should try to have Scotland and
England playing at the same time.
``It would be of benefit to both countries. Clearly, they are looking at
Gascoigne, and I'm sure Craig Brown has several players in mind down south.
``We are completely committed to helping the country's cause. We have done so
in the past and feel that by moving into talks with the Premiership this can be
even more important for this complicated World Cup qualification.''
Scotland, today, could find themselves facing either eight games or 10 games in
their qualifying group with the possibility of two more matches to be played to
determine whether or not they make the finals.
The matches must be played in an 18-month spell in a fixture list already
crowded with important club matches.
SFA chief executive Jim Farry pointed out: ``We have had tremendous
co-operation from the League in the past. I have no doubt that the postponement
of club games helped Scotland qualify for the World Cup finals in Italy, the
European Championships in Sweden, and next summer's European Championship
finals in England.
``There has been just one glitch, when we failed to get to the United States
two years ago. But it is of immense importance.''
Donald added: ``We will do anything to make sure that Craig Brown has the
players at his disposal when he requires them.
``If the SFA decide to play at weekends then we will go along with that. The
important thing is to strengthen our bid for qualification for these finals.''
Brown will arrive in Paris knowing the various permutations he must face. He
will know, for instance, that the most powerful countries are reigned against
the Scots with one or two exceptions.
He will know, too, that in the third strata of teams Scotland could face, that
there is a danger from Croatia who, somehow, have found themselves languishing
there while their record in the European Championships has been outstanding.
Said Brown: ``I would not mind too much facing the big guns, Germany or Italy,
for example because we can raise our game for that.
``The problem is when you move down into the other sections the public seem to
think that you can simply win the matches and march towards the finals.
``That is not the case. There are dangers when you must go to the newly
emerging countries, such as the Ukraine or Slovenia, as other nations found out
during the recent European Championship campaign.''
It is also important Scotland qualify, and take part in the finals.
Football has become big business. The television audience is so massive that
sponsors are ready to push in millions of pounds to be involved.
Estimates from FIFA suggest that something in the region of #200m will pour
into the game from television and sponsorship during the summer of 1998.
France is determined to make this the biggest, best, most lucrative World Cup
ever.
Their most famous former player, Michel Platini, has been made the front-man
for the organising committee. He remains a national hero in his own country,
and a respected figure throughout world football, and that charisma has already
helped attract even more support than normal from sponsors.
There is no doubt that the French will make this World Cup memorable.
Today, Scotland will find out what their chances are of reaching the finals and
enjoying the benefits of being there.

A THIN pretext of fear of legal reprisals has influenced the Scottish Athletic
Federation in a decision to take no action against two self-confessed doping
cheats.
The federation stated yesterday that they ``do not have the constitutional
power'' to delete the 4x100 metres record set in 1978 by Drew McMaster, David
Jenkins, Allan Wells, and Cameron Sharp because of a UK rule imposing a
six-year statute of limitations.
The first two members of the quartet admitted to using banned anabolic
steroids, prompting the sport's records committee to recommend the removal of
three records - the native and national relay marks, and Jenkins' individual
400m record.
The SAF rules commission have been asked to discuss with the British federation
the UK rule which they say prevents them expunging the records. The SAF do,
however, wish to introduce a rule allowing them to expunge any records
invalidated at a future date.
Peter Radford, the BAF chairman, believes the SAF have misinterpreted the UK
rule. I understand, however, that legal advice offered to SAF is that Wells and
Sharp could have grounds for action if the SAF deny them the record.
Ironically, this would not be the case. Wells and Sharp both featured in the
second fastest squads whose time would be ratified if the flawed mark were axed.
Scottish athletics' wavering stance is in contrast to the action taken by
Canada in the wake of the Ben Johnson affair.
The sprint relay records to which the 1988 Olympic cheat had contributed were
expunged. So, too, were the individual Canadian shot putt and sprint marks of
Bishop Dolegiewicz and Angella Issajenko, simply on the strength of their
admissions at a sport inquiry.
q THE two most successful coaches in Scotland believe the current competition,
club, and coach education systems need to be abolished if the decline in
standards is to be halted, writes Graeme Smith.
World-respected John Anderson and Tommy Boyle shared a platform at the weekend
as part of an initiative directed at raising the standard of Scottish women's
middle-distance running.
It is almost 25 years since Rosemary Stirling set the current Scottish women's
800m record, but Carol Sharp, still in Scotland's top 10 with 2-02.91 in 1982,
is spearheading efforts at improvement.
Her first success was to attract the two coaches to the conference, backed by
Puma and Glasgow District Council. The pair, outwith the establishment system,
and with conflicting philosophies, say athletes succeed in spite of the system.
Anderson calls for the current competition system to be scrapped, while Boyle
points out that it takes four years for a physical education teacher to
qualify, but just two weekends to become an athletics coach.

MAYBE in the great scheme of things, it doesn't matter a heap of beans, but it
seems to me there is something not right when the national television station
is becoming, through no fault of its own, a bit player in broadcasting sport.
The Beeb would take serious umbrage at such a suggestion, but we only need to
examine the effect satellite and commercial competition is having on the UK
network to see that what was once the platform for the great sporting occasions
of Great Britain is fast developing into a kind of Oliver in headphones -
begging at the table of the rich man for whatever crumbs may be left over.
The news that ITV is to take over the FA Cup final follows upon the Sky deal
which has already taken over the premiership in England, and the premier
division in Scotland from the BBC remit.
With the recent Endsleigh first division arrangement securing the next best
English league for Sky as well, the national station will be reduced shortly to
snippets, highlights, and blether. The real stuff will be done by others.
This is not meant as an attack on Sky which, in presenting sport - now on two
channels - has shown the terrestrial companies how the project should be
tackled.
The Beeb fares no better in other sports. Gone from their umbrella is
Cheltenham, where the Festival meeting in the spring was one of their finest
presentations.
Channel Four racing has snatched that from their grasp, as well as the biggest
and most prestigious horse race of the year, the Epsom Derby. BBC still have
the Grand National and Royal Ascot, but for how long?
In golf, the Ryder Cup, the best team event in sport, as well as the Scottish
Open and the Volvo European Tour, have been taken over by Sky.
The Open is what is left to the BBC, and that only because the R &amp; A wish to
remain faithful to the station that helped make the tournament the best in the
world.
Such sentimental attachments, however worthy, will not endure, and already
there has been talk that the jewel in the Beeb's crown, Wimbledon fortnight, is
being sought by the satellite channel.
Rugby Union, a sport nurtured and given an international gloss by the BBC, has
taken its World Cup to the highest bidder; cricket, once the preserve of the
old country's national station, has been snatched, at least to some extent, by
satellite; boxing is more or less lost to the other networks.
It is not amusing to a whole generation of viewers who were weaned on the great
television occasion as presented by the Beeb.
The point about all of this is that nobody seems to be terribly interested in
doing anything about it. Yet, in a sense, we own the BBC. It is our station,
paid for by our taxes and our licence money, under the jurisdiction of
governors who ultimately answer to the Government.
Why then, should we stand by and allow it to be relegated to the second
division in sports broadcasting?
There is no chance that, under the current free-for-all in the market place,
the BBC can outgun the commercial channels. Presumably, the licence fee would
have to be raised to nonsensical proportions to cope with the competition.
Therefore, is the Government merely allowing the national station, once the
envy of the world, to cut its own throat by failing to compete in the big-time?
Is the plan to let it get so weak and ineffective that the cry to allow
advertising will swamp the traditionalists and discard that long-treasured
independence?
There is a growing feeling that this would be the only way to put the Beeb into
the real marketplace but, for many people, in that scenario it would no longer
be the national station working with the people's interests, rather than those
of the shareholders, at heart.
It would be foolish to imagine that what is happening in sport is not also
applying to entertainment and the arts.
Perhaps there is no other way forward but commercialism, but is it not time
that our politicians, Government and opposition, made some sounds about what
they intend to do about the depressing erosion of the BBC as the voice of the
nation?

THE chances of Eric Cantona joining the Paul McStay party at Parkhead tonight
are receding fast.
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said yesterday that his star Frenchman
was no more than a 50-50 bet to take part in the testimonial match which was
sold out a week ago.
``Eric has a groin strain,'' said Ferguson, ``and I doubt if he will make it.
It is a pity, because he loves to play in these games and I know how good a
reception he would have received from the Celtic fans.''
The former Aberdeen manager was only a little bit surprised to hear of the
overnight queues for tickets for the occasion, having had experience of the
Celtic fans' support for events like this in the past.
``I can tell them they will see a good team,'' he said, tongue in cheek. ``We
have had a lot of problems with injuries this season, and we were without six
players at the weekend.
``The new lads have done well, however and, apart from Cantona, the team for
Parkhead will be much the same as drew with Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday. In
the Frenchman's absence, the star attraction is likely to be the #6m man, Andy
Cole.
The fact that Ferguson will field that side is a tribute to McStay, bearing in
mind Manchester United are due to meet Liverpool at Anfield this weekend.
Ferguson has long been an admirer of the Celtic player and promises to make the
testimonial a real game. ``It always has to be that when you play Celtic, and
especially if what I hear of the atmosphere created by the new stand is right.''
The manager has also decided to make Brian McClair captain for the night
-``seeing as he is back at his roots'' - and that should guarantee a big night
for McStay's former team-mate, too.
It could be a good time for a debut as well and that is likely with Celtic's
new man, Morten Wieghorst, ready to step up from the short stint as a
substitute he enjoyed in Celtic's 4-0 win over Hibs at Easter Road on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Celtic manager Tommy Burns recalled his testimonial, and told
McStay: ``You are in for an emotional night.''
Burns was awarded a money-spinning encounter in 1987 against Liverpool.
``I remember when it was my turn, and all I can suggest to Paul is that he
enjoys himself. A lot of things will go through his mind. He will recall all
the things that happened to him, from his early days at the club. It will be
another milestone in what has been a great career.
``It will be a full house and it will be good for the younger lads to test
themselves against Manchester United.''
McStay currently is enjoying an excellent run of form in a rejuvenated Celtic
team. And Burns believes his skipper would have reached even greater heights if
he had had better players around him in the past.
``But for a while Paul's play suffered because the team was not the same
quality as he was.
``However, in the last couple of months he has gone from strength to strength.
He is very modest guy who conducts himself well on and off the park.

EXCEPT for a 9-3 win over the English women last night, Scotland's teams
struggled in yesterday's play here in Grindelwald, Switzerland, at the European
championships.
In their first game, Kirsty Hay's women scrambled an extra-end 6-5 win over
Finland, but Hammy McMillan's team went down to Norway's three times world
champion Eigel Ramsjfell, conceding after the seventh end at 11-4.
The Scottish women were virtually untroubled against England, but in the
morning, Finland scored a two at the first end. The Scots levelled at 4-4, but
Finland went ahead again with a single at the eighth. Scotland had the
opportunity to win with Hay's last stone at the tenth, but her tap-up was too
strong, giving the Scots only a single. In tense play that followed, the last
Finnish stone was also too strong giving Scotland a steal.
In the men's game, the writing was on the wall from the first end when a
McMillan miss let Norway steal a single. Norway followed that with a 3 at the
third and another 3 at the fifth, for 7-2. At the halfway break, the Scots
changed stones. This worked until Norway rolled in a 4 at the seventh.
With round robin games against Germany today and Finland tomorrow McMillan is
still on course for a quarter-final slot. Details:
Women: Round two: Group A 1 - Austria 4, Sweden 14; Czech Republic 5, Denmark

Second assault on
a castle of dreams
DOUGLAS LOWE
BOB Low, the Belgian industrialist, is back in control at Brunston Castle Golf
Club at Dailly, Ayrshire, 21 months after his dream development went into
receivership.
He and his Antwerp partners have successfully negotiated purchase from
receivers Coopers &amp; Lybrand through the new operation which is called Brunston
Castle Golf Company Ltd.
Low, who had spent at his estimation more than #4m on his ill-fated first
attempt, had thought his return was virtually sealed in February this year.
However, the legal formalities have only just been completed - in time for the
club's annual prize-giving.
This time there will be no peripheral housing in the plan, the element which he
identified as his original downfall. It will be purely golf.
He paid tribute to the receivers, particularly Jim Kilcullen, who have been
looking after the course in the interim. Low said: ``They have done a great job
in keeping the place not just in top condition but even improving it. They have
also brought in new members.''
There are around 150 more members than in early last year. The total is now
almost 400 of which 85 are juniors with a few vacancies available at #300
joining fee plus annual subs also of #300.
``Staff have remained loyal and I am delighted that Derek McKenzie is still
here as professional and Gordon Heron as head greenkeeper,'' added Low, whose
first move since his return as director and company secretary has been to
appoint former Rangers goalkeeper Peter McCloy as general manager.
Work began last week on the upper floor of the clubhouse and Low intends to
complete the practice range and install a further nine holes in addition to the
Donald Steel-designed 6800-yard par 72 course already in place.

<HEADLINE>Staunton out of Ireland's Euro decider</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STEVE Staunton yesterday was ruled out of the Republic of Ireland's Euro '96
play-off with Holland at Anfield tomorrow night after having pulled a hamstring
in training.
Staunton, who deputised as Irish captain for Andy Townsend in the 3-0 defeat by
Portugal last month, has been plagued by hamstring problems since making a late
entry into the Premiership this season, following Achilles tendon surgery in
the summer.
Manager Jack Charlton said: ``He has been very unlucky this season and had a
very up-and-down time with injuries. Maybe this is for the best as far as we
are concerned, because we haven't seen the Steve Staunton of old in our recent
matches.
``At least I can formulate the shape of my team now that I know I am definitely
without Staunton and Roy Keane. I've got Andy Townsend back, which is a major
boost, and John Sheridan moved very well in training.''
Charlton's starting line-up, now that his options have been reduced, will mean
suspended striker Niall Quinn being replaced by Tony Cascarino.
Staunton's place on the left of midfield is likely to go to either Mark
Kennedy, the #2m Liverpool teenager, or Blackburn's Jeff Kenna - assuming
Charlton gambles on Sheridan in the anchor role. He has had just 14 minutes of
Premiership football with Sheffield Wednesday since a knee operation six weeks
ago.
Meanwhile, Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp arrived in Holland's training base just
outside Liverpool confident he will shake off a calf injury in time to play.
England's Les Ferdinand will be a man in a hurry against Portugal tonight,
desperate to seize what he fears could be his one and only chance under Terry
Venables.
The England coach will not name his Wembley line-up until lunch-time. But the
withdrawal of Tottenham striker Teddy Sheringham with a back injury allows him
to satisfy public demand and give the red-hot Newcastle striker the first start
of his two-year reign.
The 20-goal Geordie striker will line up alongside Alan Shearer for the first
time in the sort of orthodox spearhead that Venables has always spurned, but
which he feels is the answer to the loss of midfield anchormen David Platt,
Robert Lee, and Jamie Redknapp.
The manager will trim his wings, with perhaps a first start for Steve Stone and
the bench for Steve McManaman, and will rely on English attacking traditions.
Venables could have brought Nick Barmby or Peter Beardsley into the kind of
split-attack he prefers, but when Sheringham dropped out to complicate his
midfield woes, he opted to reshape the middle of the team instead.
The remainder of Venables' survivors are all in good shape, and he is likely to
ask the energetic Stone, excellent on two substitute appearances against Norway
and the Swiss, to provide the width on the right.
Dennis Wise could come back in as a ``minder'' for Paul Gascoigne, with either
Graeme Le Saux pushed into midfield or maybe a first cap for Gareth Southgate
in front of a back four which is likely to show just one change, with
Newcastle's Steve Howey returning for the injured Gary Pallister.

Everton 3, West Ham 0
THEY stood up and cheered, the great majority of the 31,778 gathered in the
chill of Goodison Park, as the prodigal returned. Even the orginal never had it
quite so good. Big D, free from the Bar L, was back threatening defences in the
best possible way.
Duncan Ferguson, who had not played for three months, since the second league
game of the season, made his triumphant come-back as a substitute 17 minutes
after the interval. To be fair, the triumph by then had been secured by his
team mates, who were two goals ahead and against a 10-man West Ham with a full
back acting as goalkeeper after their No.1 had been sent off just before the
interval.
Duncan was not likely to be tested severely in the circumstances, but he looked
sharp for a man who had not tackled this level of football for so long - lean
and wiry.
Ferguson has a long hard road to travel before he erases the memory of the last
few months when he was convicted and sentenced after head-butting John McStay
in April, 1994, but no man ever had a bigger army behind him in the
rehabilitation programme.
Not long after his appearance, he almost gave them the goal they sought when he
headed the ball against the bottom of a post.
Still, he was on the park as Everton recorded their biggest win of the season.
Everton manager Joe Royle was determined, it seemed, to say as little as
possible about Ferguson's return.
``He did fine,'' he said. ``The danger is that we turn everything into a Duncan
Ferguson sideshow. We've got to be very careful or we will be pilloried by the
press. So let's just say he did OK. He's back now.''
The pre-match news was good for Ferguson. His next court hearing, when the
validity of his SFA 12-match suspension will be thrashed out, has been set for
mid-March, meaning that the striker will have plenty of opportunities to play
himself into the big-time again, not forgetting Scotland's European
Championship finals squad.
He will be free for the next 13 Everton league games, as well as their opening
FA Cup tie with Stockport in January. Some day he may yet have to serve the
remaining seven matches of his ban, but for the time being, Big Dunc is back in
football business.
As they set out last night, these two teams were level on points in twelfth and
thirteenth places in the Premiership.
Overall, the play was anything but riveting. If anybody deserved a goal, it had
to be the home side whose wingers, Kanchelskis and Limpar, always threatened to
do something. Yet when they took the lead in 35 minutes, it was a Keystone Cops
effort.
Jackson had done well on the right before passing the ball along the touchline
to Amokachi, who wheeled and laid the ball into the path of Kanchelskis, but
hit it too hard. The ball bounced off the winger's legs and then Stuart mis-hit
it off a defender past bewildered keeper, Lidek Miklosko.
He was not bewildered a few minutes later, rather totally dejected, as he was
sent off. The keeper came out to block Kanchelskis, the ball spun in the air
towards Amocachi, and the keeper flattened the striker with an inadvertent, but
effective forearm smash, and after the ball was cleared off the line, the
referee sent the keeper off and awarded the penalty which David Unsworth
steered in cleverly.
Julian Dicks had taken over in goal to watch the penalty go into the net and he
came out for the second half certain to be put through the treatment, as the
Hammers didn't have another keeper on their bench.
the crowd had waited with anticipation as the teams came out but there was no
big moment, no Duncan to welcome. Not yet, anyway.
After 62 minutes, the place came alive as Ferguson was called into the action,
taking over from Limpar.
And he had only touched the ball a couple of times when his side went three
ahead after the deouty keeper could only parry a shot from Amokachi and Ebbrell
nipped in to touch it over the line.
Fergie then hit a post with a header, very nearly putting the ideal finishing
touch to a quiet debut. Just what he had hoped for, I am sure.
EVERTON - Southall, Unsworth, Watson, Stuart, Limpar, Amokachi, Ebbrell,
Jackson, Kanchelskis, Parkinson, Short. Substitutes - Ferguson, Kearton, Horne.
WEST HAM UNITED - Miklosko, Breacker, Dicks, Potts, Rieper, Slater, Bishop,
Williamson, Cottee, Dowies, Hughes. Substitutes: Rowland, Harkes, Boogers.

FOOTBALL, like diplomacy, has been seen as a form of war by peaceful means, but
fears over real conflicts will loom large over today's draw for the 1998 World
Cup.
While the break-up of the former Soviet Union has been relatively peaceful -
with 10 nations emerging from the one erstwhile superstate - the murderous
passions of the Balkans have played out their full horror on the television
screens of the world.
With peace having now been declared - although the Dayton Peace Accord has yet
to be ratified - FIFA have reacted with surprising speed.
The breakaway states of Croatia, Slovenia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia - so named to avoid offending Greek sensibilities - took part in the
Euro '96 qualifying tournament, and the Croats, with the talents of Zvonimir
Boban, Robert Prosinecki, and Davor Suker at their disposal, will be genuine
challengers next summer.
But with the warring factions still training their target sights on each other,
FIFA have given the go-ahead for both the rump Yugoslavia - effectively Serbia
and Montenegro - and Bosnia-Herzegovina to take part in France '98.
It is possible, given the seedings, that four of these nations could be drawn
in the same group at the Carrousel du Louvre, a scenario that must surely chill
the blood after the past few years.
Indeed, it could be claimed that football played its part in fanning the ethnic
embers which were to erupt with such dreadful passions.
A game between Croatian standard bearers Dynamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade -
their Serbia counterparts - saw violence on and off the pitch, with Boban
drop-kicking a Serbian soldier and earning Croatian hero status in the process.
Yugoslavia, who had qualified for the 1992 European Championships in Sweden,
found themselves international pariahs after the outbreak of war.
They were kicked out of the tournament, to be replaced by eventual winners
Denmark, and then omitted from the 1994 World Cup and Euro '96.
Officially, FIFA are unconcerned about possible problems, although secretary
general Sepp Blatter did reveal that Italy had offered to host Bosnia's home
games if the war was to drag on.
Blatter added: ``The sanctions imposed by the United Nations have been lifted.
Yugoslavia was banned but the federation is still registered with FIFA and now
they are allowed to play.''
FIFA president Joao Havelange made it clear that he was prepared to see all
five former Yugoslav republics back in the football fold, despite his evident
hesitations.
``We've no reason to be worried,'' he said. ``Before, there was a country
called Yugoslavia and until that country broke down it was always a strong
footballing nation, with players from the different communities.
``That is no longer the case - and from Yugoslavia we have four new countries,
all of whom have high quality players.
``It wasn't that way in the past and how I feel doesn't make any difference -
we have to go with how the world changes.''
Perhaps so, but the idea of Bosnia playing host to the Serbs is surely
unthinkable.
FIFA's fingers will be firmly crossed that such a contingency does not arise.

DREW Docherty, the British bantamweight champion, whose last ring appearance
ended tragically in Glasgow, had it confirmed last night that his comeback will
be a second chance at the world title.
Docherty will meet WBO champion Daniel Jiminez, of Puerto Rico on January 20,
with the bout almost certainly taking place in London. Last night the
30-year-old from Condorrat vowed to dedicate the fight to the late Jim Murray,
who was knocked out in the twelfth round of a British championship challenge
against Docherty in the Hospitality Inn on October 13 and died in hospital two
days later.
Many thought that the champion would never box again but, after discussions and
support from his family and manager Tommy Gilmour, plus encouragement and
comfort from the Murray family, he announced he would carry on.
Docherty was originally lined up to meet Chatham's Johnny Armour, the European
and commonwealth champion in a triple title fight, but when the chance came for
another crack at the world championship - he lost on a knockout to Alfred Cotey
of Ghana in Cumbernauld last February - Gilmour immediately pulled him out of
the Armour contest.
The manager said: ``I have done a deal with London promoter Frank Warren for
Drew to meet Jiminez on January 20 and it looks like going on in London.''
Docherty said: ``This is brilliant news and I don't mind in the least that I'll
have to miss out on the festive season. I'll be in training from now until the
big night.''

A LITTLE bit of rugby history will unfold at Gateshead tonight as Scotland play
England for the first time at under-21 level.
Scotland already have a win under their belts this season - a 25-16 victory
against New Zealand youth at Jedburgh - which built upon convincing
performances last term when the current crop beat Wales and Italy, lost
narrowly to Ireland, and less convincingly to France.
Yesterday, manager Derrick Grant reckoned England will ask the same old
questions. ``We watched the video of England losing to Ireland the other week
and they looked like a big powerful side. So nothing much has changed there,''
he said.
``Whenever we play England, at any level, they always seem to field huge packs
which have the ability to tie the game down.''
The Scots, captained by Graham Dall, have lost a couple of players through
injury. Right wing-threequarter Hugh Gilmour and fly-half Chris Richards are
out, Colin Macrobert and Michael Duncan coming in.
Scotland - C M Sangster (Stirling Co.); C Macrobert (Stirling Co.), C A Murray
(Hawick), G M O Smith (Orrell), S Reed (Nottingham); M Duncam (Edinburgh
Acad.), G Beveridge (Boroughmuir); D Massey (Currie), G C Bulloch (W of
Scotland), B D Stewart (Edinburgh Acad.), G C Perrett (W of Scotland), S Murray
(Edinburgh Acad.), D McLeish (West of Scotland), T McVie, G F Dall (both
Heriot's FP).
Replacements - C Aitken (Heriot's FP), J McKee (Cardiff), J Weston
(Watsonians), C Cotrill (Langholm), S Begley (Glasgow Acad.), D Jamieson (W of
Scotland), G Hodgson (Newcastle).
Referee - D McHugh (Ireland).

THE ROAD to paradise cleared for Celtic and their legion of supporters
yesterday as the club's managing director, Fergus McCann, announced work will
begin immediately on the second stage in the rebuilding of Parkhead stadium,
writes Ron McKenna.
Around #6m is to be spent building a 12,500-capacity stand at the east of the
park - the traditional Ranger's end - to be completed within nine months. The
two-tier development will close one of the two open ends at the Glasgow stadium
and bring the clubs' capacity up to 47,000.
The decision to push on with new stand was prompted by the need to get more
people through the turnstiles, said McCann. ``We're anxious to get this open
for next season because we need the capacity. We decided we wouldn't start
building until we knew the capacity was there, but most of our matches have
been sold out this year and even with the smaller clubs visiting we only have
about 4000 tickets to sell for a home game.''
The #17m north stand was opened in August after the club had spent a season in
exile at Hampden Park.
The contract for the new stand has been awarded to Ayr-based construction
company Barr Ltd, who have already built stadiums at Kilmarnock and Easter
Road. It will be financed by the club, said McCann, and no mortgage has been
taken on the club's assets nor would the development affect spending on the
team.

ANDREW Oldcorn has finally triumphed in his 12-year battle to become a Scot. He
is now poised to mount a 1996 challenge to native-born stars such as Colin
Montgomerie, Sam Torrance, and Andrew Coltart for Scottish international
honours.
The Bolton-born 35-year-old who has lived in Edinburgh since he was 10 is at
last qualified to ``pull on the Scottish jersey'' if he ever plays well enough
to force his way into a position to represent Scotland in events such as the
Alfred Dunhill Cup or the World Cup.
Like Shropshire-born Sandy Lyle before him, Oldcorn represented England at
every level as an amateur, won the English Amateur Championship in 1982, but
has regarded himself as a Scot since he was in primary school and in fact he
was the first-ever Scottish Youths' champion in 1979.
However, when he first attempted to become a Scot immediately after turning
professional in 1983 his application was rejected by the European Tour even
although there has never been any written rule precluding golfers from changing
nationality after playing for a particular country as an amateur.
A second attempt four years ago was also dismissed. That was after Oldcorn
regained a measure of fitness after the debilitating ME disease cost him three
years of his career and soon after he led the 1991 Open at the halfway stage.
``I had been a member of the Scottish Region of the PGA since I first turned
pro and wanted nothing better than to be announced on the tee as ``Andrew
Oldcorn, Scotland'', he said after learning the news of his new nationality
status while on holiday in Florida.
``I learned my golf in Scotland, I have always regarded it as my home and
desperately want to represent my country.
``Early this year I was so determined to try again that I even sought legal
advice,'' added MacAndy, who enjoyed his best-ever season on the European Tour
this year, winning the Jersey Open and finishing thirty-fifth in the order of
merit with more than #140,000 in official money.
``But even although I had the full backing of Tartan Tour secretary Neil
Simpson and his committee, I deliberately held off until the end of the season
in case people said I was only doing it for the money that comes with playing
in a Dunhill or World cup.
``The truth is money had nothing to do with it. I have always wanted to be
known as a Scot. It's as simple as that. In my mind Scotland is more than my
home - it is my country.
``After I won in Jersey I was playing so well that had I maintained my form I
might well have played himself into a position where I could have qualified for
England's Dunhill Cup team this year and then I would really have been in an
emotional quandary because I have an identity with Scotland which I do not have
for England.''
That potentially embarrassing position was eliminated by a neck injury which
put a mid-season brake on his progress.
It did not, however, deflect his determination to become an official Scot as he
felt he had just as strong a claim to play under the Lion Rampant banner as
some others who played all their amateur golf as Sassenachs then played
professionally for Scotland.
He did not name names but such as Brian Barnes, Gordon Brand Jr, and Lyle come
readily to mind.
There is little doubt that Oldcorn's third-time-lucky bid was partially
influenced by Finnish-born Jarmo Sandelin playing for Sweden and Czech
Alexander Cejka representing Germany in recent weeks, but he is deeply grateful
to the whole-hearted support of the Tartan Tour.
``And the bottom line is that I am now officially a Scot,'' said Hearts fan
Oldcorn. ``What a terrific Christmas present.''

A NEW penalty system, under which jockeys could receive longer or suspended
sentences but make fewer appearances before the Jockey Club's Disciplinary
Committee, was unveiled yesterday.
In a bid to reduce disciplinary committee hearings to those cases involving
persistent offenders and the most serious incidents, a new ``totting-up''
procedure is to be introduced.
From January 1, jockeys will be referred to Portman Square only when they
re-offend having reached suspensions totalling 12 or more days for interference
or misuse of the whip.
As a result, Committee chairman Anthony Mildmay-White forecasts a halving in
the number of referrals to Portman Square but ``long suspensions'' for those
who breach the rules regularly.

THE first move to halt declining athletics standards in Edinburgh was unveiled
yesterday when Norrie Williamson took up a new post as the city's development
officer, writes Doug Gillon.
The city's two main clubs, Edinburgh AC and Edinburgh Southern Harriers, have
slipped down the UK leagues, failing to produce their former high quota of UK
and Scottish team members. Amalgamation of the clubs is not part of the remit,
however.
Williamson, an ultra distance internationalist, has won many major races in
South Africa where he lived since 1981, and has competed for Scotland during
the past two seasons, finishing fourth at the 1994 Commonwealth 100k
championships. He has returned from Durban where he was head of sport at ML
Sultan Technikon, a large university for Indian and African students.
The new post is a partnership between the Scottish Sports Council, Scottish
Athletics Federation, and Edinburgh District Council. The SSC is picking up the
major share of his salary, but after three years, Edinburgh will do so.
Though exceptionally well qualified - he is an author, broadcaster, TV
commentator, and IAAF official - his appointment provoked some controversy.
Neither Tom McKean nor Brian Whittle, both of whom have done considerable
development work during their international careers, were even granted an
interview.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
ANDY Rhodes is set for a quick debut tonight for Airdrie against Clydebank at
Kilbowie. The keeper completed a #50,000 move yesterday from St Johnstone.
Airdrie will be without defender Sean Sweeney, who misses the chance of facing
his former club, and striker Steve Cooper, both suspended. But the winter
weather which knocked out the match on Saturday could have helped Clydebank as
Ken Eadie, Craig Flannigan and Dean Connolly, who would have missed out, could
be included.
q WINGER Paul Tosh will be hit by a club fine for his moment of red card
madness as Dundee flopped against Dunfermline at the weekend. The former
Arbroath player was sent off after David Bingham was injured in a lunging
tackle which also involved Dens new boy, Barry Smith.
q HIBS' defender Darren Dods, sent off against Celtic at Easter Road on
Saturday, has been hit by a four-match ban. His red card took him through the
disciplinary limit and means that, not only will he automatically miss this
Saturday's game against Raith, but further games Partick Thistle, Rangers, and
the Edinburgh derby against Hearts on New Year's Day.
q STENHOUSEMUIR manager Terry Christie last night declared he wanted a repeat
of last season's Scottish Cup run.
The Ochilview club surprised everyone by making the quarter-finals of the
competition claiming the scalps of Aberdeen and St Johnstone on the way, before
finally losing out to Hibs.
Arbroath tonight stand in the way of the Ochilview men's passage into the
second round.
But 'Muir are confident of going through having already won the Challenge Cup
earlier in the season, beating Dundee United on penalties.

THE high profile of the European Professional tour, with its huge prize funds,
pervasive media exposure, and the diversity of its personalities inevitably
overshadows the corresponding women's tour, not to mention that of the even
more modest PGA Scottish Region's calendar.
Be that as it may, the last-named programme, more familiarly known as the
Tartan Tour, is taking impressive shape for 1996 - so much so that the
secretary, Neil Simpson, expects total prize-money next season, to be not
unadjacent to #800,000 - a substantial increase in the #720,000 ultimately
disbursed this year.
The centrepiece will, as always, be the Scottish Professional championship, to
return to its established venue at Dalmahoy in the third week of May but, since
the formation of the brewing company, Scottish Courage, to have their Gillespie
brand as the title sponsor.
When Colin Gillies squeezed past the holder, Andrew Coltart, last Spring he
earned #11,000 from a total of #65,000 - a sum which Simpson, perhaps relying
on Louis XIV's theory that change is the best aphrodisiac of all, hopes the
sponsor will increase by a significant margin.
The championship will conflict with the Spanish Open, a calculated piece of
scheduling, however, since the week before Sam Torrance, five times winner of
the Scottish championship, will be defending his Italian title. Torrance would,
all things being equal, be free to return to the course where he had two of his
victories.
This event happens long before the first tournament to count towards the points
which bring an automatic place in the 1997 European Ryder Cup team. That allows
players the extra degree of flexibility which might persuade Torrance, as well
as Colin Montgomerie, to take part.
Whatever Montgomerie and Torrance, first and second in the 1995 European Order
of Merit, decide, a commitment to play has been given by Bernard Gallacher.
Having stood down as captain of a victorious Ryder Cup side after having
presided over two narrow defeats, the winner of the title, also on five
occasions, will happily renew old acquaintance.
The Scottish championship is the first of the five 72-hole tournaments which
again form the order of merit programme, along with the continuation of the
matchplay championship.
The Northern Open is two weeks later, at Cruden Bay, followed by the Sunderland
Masters, in the last week of June at the new location of Ayr Belleisle.
The other three events comprise the Granite City Open at Hazlehead, the
Inaugural Southern Opern at Southerness, and, lastly, the matchplay - possibly
at Peter Thomson's Duke's course, near St Andrews, much admired by those who
have seen or played the former Open champion's design.
Of course, apart from the tournaments specifically for assistants, the bulk of
the calendar again consists of pro-am events, probably approaching 85 by the
time the list has finally been worked out. It is worth noting that Gillies
augmented his income from his club job at Falkirk by more than #28,000 last
season.
Indeed, Alan Tait and Russell Weir also earned in excess of #20,000 and 16 more
players reached five figures. If money does not grow on trees to the same
extent as on the main tour the pickings closer to the ground are not to be
derided either.
In any other year the certainty would surely have been that Annika Sorenstam,
not the European Ryder Cup team, would have won the Association of Golf
Writers' Trophy. The still, small voice of conscience certainly gave this voter
pause, although in fact there had already been an even more striking example of
a team's performance gaining recognition over an individuals.
In 1985, when Sandy Lyle became the first British player since Tony Jacklin, 16
years before, to win the Open Championship the poll again favoured the Ryder
Cup team which that year beat the United States after an even longer interval,
28 years to be exact.
Sorenstam's achievement of being the leading money winner on both the European
and American tours may never again be matched. Equally remarkable was her feat,
never having won any professional tournament before 1995, in winning five
times, including the US Women's Open, no less, as the very first of her
victories.
Not the least intriguing association of next season - apart from the Solheim
Cup match - is of the McDonald's WPGA Championship with Gleneagles Hotel.
It is difficult somehow to reconcile the pungent aroma of hamburgers floating
through the balmy Perthshire air across that august five-star establishment -
always assuming that ``mad cow disease'' is no longer an issue.

with England yesterday.

Volleyball
CITY of Glasgow Ragazzi, the Scottish men's volleyball champions, have
indicated they will not play in Europe next season.
Ragazzi have taken the decision after forking out #18,000 to play in two rounds
of Europe this season.
Ragazzi finally went out when they lost their European Confederation Cup group
in Glasgow at the weekend in the company of the formidale UC Paris, Balkancar
Sofia (Bulgaria), and Metalac Osijec (Croatia).
``We don't feel we get the support from the public or the Scottish Volleyball
Association,'' said coach Tommy Dowens. ``There's too much of a demand on the
club in terms of people, time, and money and we'll not be entering next year.''
Scotland's other representatives, Kilmarnock, also bowed out - finishing bottom
of their four-team group in Portugal. Results:
European Confederation Cup (Group 6, Portugal) - 1, Castelo Da Maia (Portugal)
beat Kilmarnock 15-2, 15-6, 25-5; beat Studenit Tirana 15-8, 15-5, 15-4; beat

ENGLAND A's management asked umpires Iftikhar Malik and Feroz Butt to inspect
the match ball last night after Pakistan A had reduced their side to 62 for two
in the third Test at Peshawar. The officials later reported there were no
problems.
There were no direct accusations of ball-tampering from the English camp,
although a suspicion has to be seen as being implicit in their action.
Certainly Shahid Nazir, who removed Nick Knight in a dangerous spell, has swung
the ball far more than England's quick bowlers - yet that is probably because
he is a more natural swing bowler than either Dean Hedley or Ed Giddins.
There is, too, an air of jumpiness in the England A dressing room as pressure
mounts on Nasser Hussain's team for the first time in a series they still lead
1-0.
England A begin the final day of the three-match series 39 runs behind and with
a nervy session or two to see out before they can be sure of the draw that
would start series victory celebrations.
The delegation which visited the umpires' room after close of play captain
Hussain, cricket manager John Emburey and tour manager Mike Vockins - were also
seeking clarification on how the officials are policing the problem of shadows
across the pitch thrown by close fielders late in the day.
Yesterday, Asif Mujtaba, the Pakistan A captain, took his outstanding innings
to an unbeaten 147 as the home team batted on to 300 all out, a lead of 101.
After an England opening stand of 56, teenager Nazir followed up his first
innings' six for 64 by having Knight lbw for 15 - a dismissal which sent the
first waves of uncertainty flowing through the English camp.
When Salisbury fell, Shaun Udal was sent in as a second nightwatchman to join
the solid-looking Jason Gallian, unbeaten on 42.
q PAKISTAN beat New Zealand in a one-off test by 161 runs on the morning of the
final day in Christchurch, despite a defiant unbeaten half-century by Roger
Twose. Mushtaq's bowling figures of seven for 56 finally had the Kiwis all out
for 195 in their second innings. Scoreboard:
PAKISTAN - First Innings 208. Second Innings 434 (I Ahmed 103, Inzamam-ul-Haq
82)
NEW ZEALAND - First Innings 286.

q SRI Lanka have begun official attempts to restore their reputation after
being convicted of ball-tampering during their innings defeat by Australia in
the First Test.
Team manager Duleep Mendis said the tourists had submitted a two-page report
outlining their view of the controversial incident that has tarnished Sri
Lankan cricket. The issue overshadowed Australia's victory by an innings and 36
runs on the fourth day at the WACA Ground in Perth yesterday.
Australia amassed a massive 617 for five declared in their first innings,
bolstered by a double-century from man-of-the-match, Michael Slater.
Leg-spinner Shane Warne guided his side to victory by claiming three wickets,
taking his Test haul past the double century mark in only his forty-second
appearance for his country.
q THE hopes of England's women's team winning the series against India suffered
a setback with a second-day batting collapse in the final Test in Hyderabad
yesterday.
The tourists went into the match holding an unbeatable 1-0 lead and made a
bright start by bowling out India for 184 on Sunday. But they slumped to 98 all
out on a turning wicket yesterday.
Only four of the England team reached double figures against India's spinners,
with Sue Metcalfe top-scoring with 23. And it did not look good for the
tourists when India finished the day on 36 for one in their second innings - a
lead of 122 runs.
q ENGLAND are about to be hit by an all-pace attack at Kingsmead. South Africa
seem certain to drop spinner Clive Eksteen for Thursday's third Test after the
left-armer failed to take a wicket in the second innings in Johannesburg.
Devon Malcolm and Dominic Cork, are likely to share the new ball for England.
The tourists' toughest decision is likely to revolve around Richard
Illingworth, Peter Martin, and Mark Ilott in terms of who will make up the
remainder of the attack, especially with Darren Gough carrying a hamstring
injury.

IBROX has not been ruled out as a venue for Scotland's 1998 World Cup
qualifying campaign. As manager Craig Brown prepared for the draw in Paris, SFA
chief executive Jim Farry spoke of the possibility of home matches being
switched from Hampden.
The famous South Stand is due for demolition to clear the way for a completed
redevelopment which will take the all-seater capacity to 52,000.
But Farry said the new stand, which is part of an overall #45m project, will
not be ready until a couple of months before the 1998 finals in France.
So, Scotland must either play in front of a reduced 33,000 capacity at a
Hampden building site or consider moving games away from their traditional
home, as they did in the unsuccessful campaign for USA '94.
``The feeling is that the financial package for Hampden will be in place early
in January,'' said Farry.
``After that, work can begin which is not expected to be completed until March
1998.
``We will then be left with a decision of either playing at Hampden with a
capacity cut to 33,000 or moving elsewhere - and Ibrox is the only football
ground I can think of in Scotland with a greater all-seater capacity.''

PHILADELPHIA Eagles moved to within one game of first-placed Dallas in the NFC
East with a 20-17 win over the Cowboys at Veteran's Stadium. Running-back Ricky
Watters rushed for 112 yards and one touchdown before kicker Gary Anderson
booted a 42-yard field goal with seconds left to earn the Eagles, now 9-5,
victory.
Philadelphia were able to kick the field goal when they regained possession
deep in Cowboys' territory after Dallas head coach Barry Switzer gambled on
fourth-and-one, calling the same play twice, without success.
Despite the loss, the Cowboys still secured a play-off berth after Chicago
Bears (7-7) fell to the Cincinnati Bengals (6-8) 16-10 and Buffalo Bills (9-5)
hammered St Louis Rams (7-7) 45-27.
Indianapolis Colts (8-6) moved into second place behind the Bills in the AFC
East, downing Jacksonville Jaguars (3-11) 41-31, while in the NFC West San
Francisco 49ers (10-4) maintained their challenge to repeat their Superbowl
glory with a fifth-straight victory thumping Carolina Panthers (6-8) 31-10.
Results:
Saturday - Arizona 25, San Diego 28; Cleveland 11, Minnesota 27.
Sunday - Buffalo 45, St Louis 27; Chicago 10, Cincinnati 16; Dallas 17,
Philadelphia 20; Detroit 24, Houston 17; Green Bay 10, Tampa Bay 13;
