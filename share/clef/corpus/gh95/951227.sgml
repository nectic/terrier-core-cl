FACED with the prospect of eating alone in the formal surroundings of a hotel
dining room, the solo travelling business woman would not object if she was
joined by actor Robbie Coltrane.
That at least was the conclusion of one of Glasgow's city centre hotels, the
Copthorne, which questioned hundreds of female guests on how to improve its
services for the solitary traveller.
Among more serious questions on safety, the hotel threw in the question of the
ideal dinner partner. Coltrane, whose credibility as an object of desire was
greatly enhanced by his starring role in the ITV detective series Cracker, came
out as the favourite. Least favourite companion for dinner a deux was,
strangely, Margaret Thatcher.
The hotel's survey this Christmas comes after a number of similar studies by
women's business groups which have been concerned about the facilities offered
by hotels to the ever-growing number of female business travellers.
Yesterday the Copthorne's general manager, Ms Amanda Scott, said the majority
of solo female guests felt uncomfortable dining or drinking alone. They also
resented having to contend with the unwanted advances of male guests.
In response to the dining room nightmare she said hotels needed to provide
excellent room service. On the issue of safety she said women preferred to
sleep in rooms where doors were fitted with safety chains and spyholes.
The survey of 300 guests also revealed that women would like to have an iron
and ironing board in their rooms.

THE cold weather looked at first to have slowed down the traditional rush to
snap up bargains in the Boxing Day sales yesterday, with business starting
quietly across Scotland, but the temptations for shoppers finally proved too
strong.
Trade picked up in most areas later in the day, although shops in Aberdeen were
forced to close early to allow staff and customers plenty of time to get home
in the poor weather conditions.
Mr Nick Harvey, manager of Debenhams in the city's Trinity Shopping Centre,
said: ``Trading has been reasonably good considering the weather, but we
decided to close half an hour early.
``We had a lot of people from the city centre, but a lack of folk from out of
town. We have all been surprised by the number of people who have braved the
weather.''
Mr George Ritchie, manager of Glasgow's St Enoch Centre, said: ``We opened at
10am, and with the roads and the weather it was a slow start. But by lunchtime
they were coming out in their droves.
``Fashions are quite big at this time of year when people are given money as
their Christmas gift to spend in the sales. Sports and shoe shops were also
very busy.
``Boxing Day is a leisure day and people come out to enjoy themselves. We are
in the entertainment business today.''
Ms Tracy Walker, sales and operations manager at Debenhams in Argyle Street,
Glasgow, said: ``We opened at 9am and we had about 100 people waiting to come
in. We were selling a lot of outer-wear and our cook shop was doing well.''
Warm coats and jackets were also big sellers, along with TVs and audio
equipment, at the House of Fraser store in Buchanan Street, Glasgow. The
manager, Mrs Jan Stanners, said: ``We had queues before we opened, but the snow
didn't help.''
About 100 people had queued outside Debenhams in Princes Street, Edinburgh, by
the time doors opened at 9am. Store manager Paul Lines said the shop had been
busy all day with a diverse range of goods selling well, including winter
coats, evening and party wear, bed linen, and saucepan sets.
At the BHS store, shoppers were snapping up festive decorations, cards and
wrapping paper, in preparation for next Christmas. Store manager Allan Miller
said the surprising big seller was an elephant that hangs on the Christmas tree
and blows bubbles out of its trunk.
``People seem to be getting more and more organised but it's surprising to have
such a rush on reduced Christmas goods on Boxing Day,'' said Mr Miller. He
added that clothing, and especially lingerie, was selling well.
At the Fraser's store at the west end of Princes Street, 40 people were waiting
for the sale to start. Store manager Nancy McKenzie said: ``We expected the
cold weather would put people off. However, we have been busy.
``Men's wear has been flying out of the door and there has been a run on things
for the home, like glass ware. All in all it's been going brilliantly.''
At Olympus Sport, manageress Julie Myles said the shop had been busy all day.
Top brand name training shoes which had their #100 prices cut by #40 were the
biggest sellers.
Shops in the capital are expected to be even more busy today when the three
biggest shopping malls - St James Centre, Cameron Toll, and the Gyle - open
their doors.
The Wellgate Shopping Centre in Dundee was visited by around 28,000 people
yesterday. Manager John Morton said: ``It was quiet in the morning, but in the
afternoon it was like a Saturday. I think people must have kept money back for
the sales.'' He said fashion stores had appeared to attract most customers.
Meanwhile, many people could be waking up to a financial hangover when the
post-Christmas sales are over, according to research carried out by MORI.
One in five people are expected to be left in debt, and many could find
themselves paying off the festivities throughout next year and beyond. The
research, conducted on behalf of Beneficial Bank, also showed that credit would
be used most by young shoppers, those aged between 25 and 34, to pay for
Christmas and New Year celebrations. Almost 70% of this age group was also
planning to attend the January sales, with 11% saying this would put them more
in debt.

THE icy conditions that have gripped Scotland since Sunday are likely to
continue, causing further disruption in the Highlands and sending Glasgow
towards an all-time temperature low.
A spokesman from the Glasgow weather centre said temperatures remained below
zero throughout the country yesterday. And he forecast the current ``Arctic
blast'' would mean even lower temperatures ahead.
He added that snow would continue to fall in the Northern and Western Isles
over the next few days, moving into Caithness and even parts of the Borders on
the east coast.
But a drop in wind speeds from 115mph on Sunday to 25mph yesterday should see
an end to the severe blizzards that have crippled those parts of the country,
he said.
Temperatures in Glasgow reached -16C yesterday morning - making the city the
coldest place in Scotland along with the area around Aviemore - and were tipped
to verge on the lowest ever reading, -17.8C, overnight.
Temperatures in Edinburgh reached a recorded low of -6C.
The weather should remain cold in the central belt until New Year with some
snow showers. Conditions could deteriorate further towards the end of the week.
Snow is lying at a depth of at least seven inches in parts of Aberdeen. The
North-east can expect continuing showers and sub-zero temperatures over the
next few days.
The forecast prompted police and motoring organisations to issue warnings that
drivers should take extra care.
AA Roadwatch said last night that icy conditions were affecting roads in
Tayside and Strathclyde and Grampian, while many islanders were completely cut
off by huge drifts in Shetland and the Western Isles.
On Benbecula, Hughena Macmillan of Creagorry, gave birth to a baby girl, Jessie
Anne, on Christmas morning in Stornoway hospital, but father Alastair MacDonald
has been unable to see the baby because he has been stranded at home by the
severe weather.
An AA spokesman advised: ``Drivers should think about only travelling if it is
absolutely necessary, and if they do they should take extra care.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police warned that the freezing overnight
temperatures could cause problems as people returned to work.
There have been around 70 accidents, mostly minor, in the region from Christmas
Day to Boxing Day, he added.
Strathclyde's roads department has defended its performance in the wintry
conditions over the Christmas period.
Thousands of motorists had to struggle through snow and over icy patches across
the region from Christmas Eve.
However, a council spokesman said yesterday that everything possible had been
done to keep roads open and passable.
He blamed much of the difficulty on the heavy snow which fell after roads had
been salted and gritted.
The spokesman said that 700 regional council staff, on 350 vehicles, had worked
every day over the Christmas period, spreading 3000 tonnes of salt and grit.
Their priority, he said had been to keep primary routes open.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police confirmed that all main roads had been kept
free of major blockages, although some minor roads remained dangerous. There
were no serious accidents in the area.
Passengers on the Glasgow Underground were held up for 25 minutes yesterday
evening after ice on the track halted services.
The harsh weather has also caused disruption in England, particularly in parts
of Lincolnshire and Humberside. The South and East Anglia could soon suffer.
Race meetings due to be held at Edinburgh and Leicester today have been called
off. Prospects for Kempton, Wetherby and Chepstow, due to stage the Coral Welsh
National, are gloomy.

MR Archibald Gillespie - one of the best-known figures in Scottish local
government and Strathclyde region's director of finance - collapsed and died at
his home on Christmas Day.
It is understood that he had gone for a stroll after his Christmas lunch. On
his return in the late afternoon he complained of breathlessness then collapsed
and died in the hallway.
Mr Gillespie, who was 60, had only three months to go before his retirement
when Strathclyde winds up. He was one of Scotland's most dynamic and highly
respected finance officials, even winning respect from the Scottish Office with
which he was often in contention.
Strathclyde region's chairman of finance, Councillor John Mullin, said
yesterday: ``We have lost one of the giants of local government. He was someone
we all looked up to as a great professional adviser on financial matters. We
are shocked and stunned by his death.''
A man of humour and great generosity of spirit, Mr Gillespie was prominent
during the controversial years of poll-tax collection, pursuing non-payers with
rigour.
So rigorous was he that one Militant councillor nicknamed him ``Ghengis''
Gillespie at a council meeting. He responded with a quiet smile.
Paradoxically - and he was never heard to say it publicly - Mr Gillespie is
understood to have disapproved of the poll tax as a revenue-raising mechanism.
Nevertheless he pursued its collection in the interests of maintaining council
services.
He once told a meeting of the finance committee, whose members were wilting in
the glare of poll tax controversy, that payment of taxes was an individual's
highest duty to society. He was contemptuous of the ``can pay, won't pay''
brigade whom he dismissed as ``chancers''.
His talents were publicly acknowledged when he was named as Finance Director of
the Year for 1995 - an honour that normally goes to the private sector.
Mr Gillespie was director of finance for the past nine years, having served as
depute director since the inception of Strathclyde region in 1975.
Before that he was County Treasurer for the former Bute Council from 1967-75.
From 1964-67 he had been chief internal auditor for the former Greenock
Corporation.
He was a Greenock man through and through and gave Morton Football Club his
steadfast support.
He is survived by his wife, Alice, two sons and two daughters.

ONE of Scotland's finest pieces of industrial architecture could be saved, it
was revealed yesterday.
Plans exist for the imposing Argyll Works near Loch Lomond to become the
country's first ``seconds'' retail unit, and an automobile heritage centre.
The giant red sandstone factory was built in Main Street, Alexandria, 90 years
ago for the manufacture of the Argyll motor car.
Later it became a government munitions factory. The Royal Naval Torpedo
Factory, as it was then named, produced torpedoes and other arms until Polaris
missiles were introduced.
It was the setting in the 1970s for a workers' sit-in when the Ministry of
Defence shut down torpedo production.
The factory finally closed its gold-leaf painted gates for the last time 20
years ago.
Since then, and despite carrying a Category A Listing as ``a significant
industrial archeological remain'', it this magnificent landmark with imposing
copper-domed clocktower has been allowed to crumble.
Councillors and heritage groups have watched with dismay as years of neglect
have taken their toll and the factory has been scavenged by scrap metal thieves.
Marble staircases and valuable fireplaces have been plundered along with
magnificent wooden panelling from the boardrooms, management suites, and
drawing offices.
Until yesterday it seemed inevitable that the Argyll Works, now a giant,
neglected sandstone skeleton, would have to be demolished.
However, hope has now emerged that it may be saved, following the announcement
of a planning application due to be discussed next week by Dumbarton District
Council.
A Glasgow company, Acreground Ltd, has applied to create a factory retail
outlet of 20 shops selling ``seconds'' - slightly flawed goods rejected by High
Street stores such as Marks and Spencer and BHS.
The plans include also a motor heritage centre in the magnificent central
hallway.
Dumbarton planning director Philip Gaunt says the Argyll Works should be saved
and maintains this could be its last chance of survival.
Mr Gaunt said: ``This proposal would seem to represent an ideal and unique
opportunity to re-use the building and to restore it to its former glory. It is
probably the last chance for this to happen, the proposal should be fully
supported.''
A spokesman for Historic Scotland said: ``This is a satisfactory and fitting
proposal which has the potential to solve one of the West of Scotland's most
intractable industrial building re-use problems.''

FORENSIC experts today began studying the charred remains of 16 members of the
Order of the Solar Temple found last week in a remote French Alpine forest
clearing.
The post-mortem examination, at a hospital near Grenoble, could take several
days and will establish whether the bodies are those of eight French and eight
Swiss nationals missing for 10 days ago, whose passports were found in cars
abandoned near the scene.
French prosecutor Jean-Francois Lorans has called the deaths a mix of murder
and suicide, mirroring the macabre October 1994 Solar Temple ritual in which 53
people died in similar circumstances in Switzerland and Canada.
``This was an organised collective murder, perhaps followed by one, two or
three suicides,'' Lorans has said.
Investigators found medicines, toxic products and flammable liquids at the
site. But they found no flammables container.
They said that of four weapons found at the site, two pistols belonged to two
French policemen believed to be among the dead.
All the bodies, including those of three children aged two, four and six, had
bullet wounds. As in the 1994 deaths, some had plastic bags over their heads.
Autopsies could provide clues to some of the unanswered questions, such as when
the victims died, who died last, and whether all those who took part in the
macabre ritual died.-Reuter

AT times I think that our Parliamentary system is plain stupid. On December 19
the Government lost the fisheries debate by two votes - 299-297. According to
my arithmetic this means that 596 MPs voted.
I saw a minute or two of the actual debate while it was taking place. I doubt
if there more than 50 Members present in the Chamber. This means that over 500
of our honest, dedicated MPs voted without knowing what had been said during
the debate.
Obviously the MPs had made up their minds how they were going to vote, but is
it not possible that some of them might have been influenced to change their
views had they actually been present to listen to what was said?
If MPs know how they are going to vote before the debate takes place surely
this is a complete waste of Parliamentary time?

RESEARCH has confirmed the crucial role that parents and the home have in
children's education. Both are generally recognised as key influences, and many
initiatives at national, local, and school level strive to involve parents more
imaginatively in their children's learning. At national level, for example, the
curricular programme for five to 14-year-olds recognises, and seeks to build
upon, parental input. According to research published today by the European
Parents Association, parental involvement in official education policy is a
reality in all EU member states. This amounts with varying degrees of
commitment to parents taking part in consultative groupings and decision-making
bodies at school level. In practice, it means parents taking decisions on such
school matters as holidays, staff recruitment, or disciplinary procedures. It
does not mean playing a direct role in teaching or, generally, in children's
education. In Scotland, school boards - the Government's formal structure for
parental involvement - have decision-making powers in limited areas but cannot
intervene in the curriculum. Based on the latest election returns, however,
parents are becoming more apathetic about school boards. It seems that more are
asking if their involvement in, and commitment to, boards is worth the candle.
And their workload will increase when all schools have devolved management,
with heads taking responsibility for most school-based spending and consulting
their boards about their plans. According to the EPA, parents across Europe are
questioning the value of becoming involved on the basis of their governments'
models. With decentralisation comes more work, more expertise - which further
disenfranchises all but the middle classes according to the EPA - and a role
for parents which fails to take account of what they are actually doing.
The association is quite rightly suspicious of the motives of governments which
seek to involve parents when public funds are at a low ebb, public services are
being eroded, and the dictates of the market-place are gaining credence. In
England, it points out, schools are being made to compete on the basis of their
results and other ``outputs'' which point to their effectiveness. Yet the
dictates of the market-place do not - cannot - sit alongside traditional,
democratic educational values which espouse open and equitable access. Any
government which seeks to hitch parents to the anti-public service,
pro-market-place bandwagon must be resisted because it is indulging in
``passing fads and dangers'', says the EPA. The long-term aims of consumers -
generations of pupils and parents - must be paramount, it concludes. The
British Government's strategy is, of course, to encourage schools to opt out of
local authority control and run themselves, funded directly by the Government
and managed by parent-dominated boards. But even in England the strategy is, at
the very least, faltering. In Scotland it has never got off the ground. Parents
may be growing in apathy towards school boards, partly because of the limited
powers they have and the commitment required to carry them out. But that does
not mean they want to run their schools. If that were the case there would be
more than two in Scotland with self-governing status. School boards have been
useful in opening up the secrets of schooling and making local authorities more
accountable in terms of explaining their actions. But if we are serious about
parental involvement we have to involve those very parents who, the EPA shows,
are still on the outside. Here, several school-based initiatives - typically in
disadvantaged areas - are under way to involve those parents and guardians who
got nothing from their experience of schooling and whose children and charges
might well reach similar conclusions. That is where we must look if we want to
be truly equitable - and successful.

A NUMBER of developments have lately breathed a little more confidence into the
private housing market which has been severely depressed since the boom of the
late eighties proved to be unsustainable. The Halifax building society,
Britain's largest, has considered these and come to the conclusion that the
worst has indeed passed and that a significant recovery is at last under way.
Significant need not mean big numbers - the society believes that house prices
will rise by 2% next year and by over 5% each in 1997 and 1998, with the
possibility of what it calls a ``mini-boom'' in the latter year. So much for
the earlier fears that house prices would stand still, if not fall, for a
generation. In fact they have fallen enough from their peak levels to make them
attractive buys at the moment given the level of interest rates and the near
certainty of these falling further next year. When tax cuts, no matter how
modest, are added to the mix, it ought be enough to appeal to new buyers and
break the logjam which has left the housing market stagnant for five years.
Confidence remains the key, and the Christmas retail experience may provide the
evidence that it has re-emerged.
That is the case for optimism and, as is the way with all economic turning
points, is has little certainty. There remains a big backlog of unsold
properties (in repossession, for example) and a pent-up wedge of houses whose
owners are anxious to sell but remain deterred by the state of the market.
These facts would, of course, keep prices from soaring ahead, but that is all
to the good: a healthy housing market needs some price stability, and the
notion that house purchase is a one-way escalator to easy money has been shown
to be immensely damaging especially to those purchasers from whom the effort to
buy is too great a sacrifice even in good times. Not everyone can afford to buy
their own house and a prudent social policy will provide them also with the
opportunity to rent from varying sources, including local authorities, whose
housing programmes have been run down too much. The authorities have the
financial resources from the proceeds of their sales of earlier council stock,
and part of these should be released to pay for new developments and also to
ensure that their quality should be high. (No doubt occupants would have
purchase rights but these might be amended to allow the properties involved to
remain in council possession for some minimum period of years: there seems no
point in public money financing cheap new housing for randomly chosen
beneficiaries.)
On the mortgage front some new developments suggest themselves. Lenders should
be prevented from offering loans equal to the total value of the property
bought: the cushion afforded by a deposit must have saved many when values
fell. Legislation may be required here. The link between mortgages and
endowment insurance policies needs careful consideration: lenders should leave
borrowers free to choose rather than insisting on the two being tied together
(for no good reason other than the commission taken by the lender). Home
ownership will still represent an investment, but that will not be the primary
motive for its acquisition and its appreciation will be long term, though a
mobile society may still have people moving faster than might otherwise be
ideal. In that case the cost of buying and selling houses will become more
obvious and the attractions of rental further reinforced.

THE past year was a good one for film-makers in Scotland. Braveheart, Shallow
Grave, Rob Roy, and other films, like Small Faces and The Near Room, were
birthed, nurtured, or otherwise brought to being in the balmy seasons of 1995.
Happy events all. But as we enter the centenary year for film, a few toddlers
taking their first faltering steps do not yet amount to an army of film-makers
stepping forth from Scotland to do battle with Hollywood.
Nor can we hope for a grown-up film community unless and until further action
is taken. Film-making in Scotland is inextricably linked to the UK and European
context. And at present, British film-makers have to try to operate in a world
in which we are disadvantaged on two flanks.
On one side stand our European competitors who are intricately and often
heavily subsidised for a variety of cultural, linguistic, and economic reasons.
On the other side, the Americans whose second-largest export industry is film
and filmed entertainment.
This latter is worth emphasising because film-making is often viewed in this
country as a marginal activity, a group of artsy folk seeking to exploit their
own egos. The Americans have demonstrated that it is in fact a business worth
over $15 billion annually, an export business expected within two years to
overhaul the aircraft industry as the United States' largest single foreign
currency earner. Hollywood bestrides the world; every country and culture
clamours for their film and television product.
This huge success is derived from a fully integrated structure for film,
beginning with script development through production to intensive marketing.
Contrast this with a British example like Carla's Song, which the eminent
director Ken Loach is at present shooting in Glasgow and Central America.
Carla's Song was finally put together with a complex web of finance including
money from Channel 4, the Scottish Film Production Fund, an Italian investor,
and a German company. Loach's worldwide status as a film-maker was hardly
reflected in the release of his last film, Land and Freedom, which was poorly
distributed with a miserly total of 25 prints of the film being made.
Highlighting the difference is Rob Roy, also developed with help from SFPF,
which was then swept up in the slipstream of a US studio, given full funding
and even fuller marketing and had at least 1200 prints made.
The American film industry is enormous, well-financed, and vertically
integrated; even films which ``lose'' money in box-office receipts recoup in
time through TV sales, video, and the growing cable universe.
So how can we hope, against this fearsome competition, to raise the little
bairn of Scottish film? There is no doubt that, beyond the welcome support
recently promised by the Scottish Office, several meaningful measures must be
taken at UK level before Scotland's film industry can stand up and begin to
walk. The evidence that this might be forthcoming is depressingly slight.
The Department of National Heritage has no apparently coherent policy on film.
It has recently and unilaterally withdrawn Britain from participation in
Eurimages, a scheme under which we were poised to benefit greatly. The DNH has
once more reduced the annual grant to the British Film Institute. And most
damaging of all, the Chancellor, in his Budget statement last month, has yet
again ignored the film sector's request for equal taxation treatment with the
rest of manufacturing industry in the UK.
This latter is by far the most serious problem we face and one which, if it
remains unattended, will not only prevent our film industry from reviving but
will eventually cause the Government real embarrassment.
deriving from an anomaly in the 1990 Capital Allowances Act, the present
situation positively discriminates against investment in film by failing to
offer investors the same fiscal environment as is afforded to investment in
other manufactured products. And while Lottery funding - a single plank in a
ramshackle edifice - has been a welcome development, it only exists as
partnership funding, making the circumstances under which private finance can
be raised a vital issue.
The situation likely to arise is one in which Lottery money is offered to
productions which will then be unable to raise the balance of their financing
because of the present hostile tax regime. Eventually these products will end
up on the shelf, unmade except in the producer's dreams. And the Lottery funds,
apparently committed to them, will disappear back into the Lottery. Opportunity
lost, initiative crushed, Government embarrassed. And Scotland no closer to
seeing an ongoing revival in its film-making fortunes.
The most frustrating part of this scenario is that the intellectual and
technical arguments leading to a possible amendment of the Finance Act were,
according to reports, accepted by a recent Chancellor and appear still to be
supported by several senior Cabinet Ministers. Implementation of changes to the
Capital Allowances Act, Section 68, removing the unwarrantable discrimination
against film, would at a single stroke open up real possibilities for
film-makers in Britain.
And Scotland, with a more advanced infrastructure for film than any other part
of the country outside London, would be significant winners in the upsurge in
production which would not only work directly to the benefit of Scotland's
economy, but it would, as several studies have shown, lead eventually to a net
inflow to the Exchequer.
The purpose of partnership funding is to ensure that producers submit projects
to the disciplines of the international market-place. We do not look for, nor
would we benefit from, subsidy.
Fairer taxation treatment actually increases net revenue to the Exchequer
consequent upon increased activity and the revival of inward investment. There
are several studies, notably in Canada and in Eire, to demonstrate this. Even
the Treasury's own economic model demonstrates that the fiscal changes being
sought would at worst be tax-neutral.
The DNH has recently set up yet another committee to advise it on film
financing. But the Government does not need a committee to inform it of the
kind of fiscal reform now urgently needed. It merely needs a sense of fair play.
We in Scotland have the technical and artistic skills - as well as the language
- to support international film-makers and develop our own industry to exploit
the worldwide opportunities which now exist.
Helping to stimulate film activity in Scotland, the Scottish Film Council and
the Film Production Fund have, over the past few years, developed initiatives,
ranging from training seminars to direct investment. These bodies are supported
by funds from the Scottish Office and supplemented (in the case of SFPF
supplemented several times over) by a variety of other sources.
But while Government support is both necessary and welcome, it can be seen in
perspective by a simple fact: the Scottish Film Production Fund grant is given
at a rate of about #0.04 per capita whereas an equivalent body in Eire receives
almost #1.00 per capita. The effect of this discrepancy can be gauged from the
fact that the Irish have some 90 film projects in development whereas Scotland
has but 30. Without a reservoir of sufficient size - as Yorkshire Water
discovered - needs cannot be met.
Some years ago SFC helped to establish the first British screen commission with
Scottish Screen Locations. On a marginal budget of some #120,000 per annum, and
without the help of government funding, this organisation has brought over #23m
worth of production to Scotland in the year past. Can any other organisation in
Britain claim a ratio of cost : benefit on this scale?
With initiatives such as Movie Makars, First Reels, Tartan Shots, and a new
five-minute film series being developed in co-operation with Scottish TV, we
are able to see young film-makers move forward. Many of these are people who
may, if successful beyond our shores, bring film production back to Scotland in
years ahead. But if we fail them now, our skill will wither and our potential
will be quickly lost.
It has been said that ``the film industry is alive and well in Britain and is
called television''. While there is a fragment of truth in the statement, it is
unfortunately not reflected in the Scottish film-making scene. British
television's overall drama budget in the UK amounts to some #500m a year. If a
mere 10% of this were to be spent in Scotland it would wholly transform
matters. In terms of building a skill base for our film-makers there is no
doubt that film-for-television could be an important arena. Perhaps some form
of ring-fencing, to ensure a proportionate contribution by Scotland, could be
devised.
But in the longer term, and apart from what we believe are zero-cost fiscal
measures applied at the national level, the enhancement of film activity in
Scotland is best accomplished by some simple measures:
n Formal recognition by government agencies that film production is an
important contributor to the cultural and to the commercial life and welfare of
our country.
n A significant increase in the Scottish Office grant to assist in the process
of development, the seedcorn of all growth.
n Encouragement of the pro-active role of SFC.
n Sustaining and growing Lottery funding levels.
n High-level government commitment to and understanding of the industry's
needs, carrying forward the industry's case for fiscal reform as well as
assisting in responding to the requirements of film-makers who are considering
Scotland as a location or production base for their projects.
We have made some worthwhile beginnings. We have proven that we have the
talents and skills to compete in world markets. Yet although Scotland has in
the past managed one of the world's most successful exports, we are still a
depressingly long way from seeing Scottish film becoming - as I believe it
capable - a success story like whisky.
n Allan Shiach is chairman of the Scottish Film Council, the Scottish Film
Production Fund and a governor of the British Film Institute. He is also
chairman of the Macallan malt whisky company.
Against all the odds, Scotland's fledgling film industry is alive and kicking
but, as Allan Shiach reports, vital change is needed if it is to flourish

THE new body to investigate miscarriages of justice should immediately study
the ``unsafe'' convictions of four men for the 1978 killing of newsboy Carl
Bridgewater, a Labour MP urged yesterday.
The case represented ``the last stain'' on the previous system of dealing with
alleged wrongful convictions, said Mr Robin Corbett, a former front bench
spokesman on home affairs.
The measures to strengthen the Court of Appeal's powers to weed out and correct
miscarriages of justice come into force on Monday.
Mr David Maclean, Home Office Minister, said yesterday that the measures,
contained in the Criminal Appeal Act, would make a ``substantial contribution''
to the quality of justice.
Carl Bridgewater, 13, was shot when he interrupted a burglary at Yew Tree Farm,
near Wordsley in Staffordshire, in 1978.
James Robinson, now 61, of Weoley Castle, Birmingham, and Vincent Hickey, 41,
of Redditch, were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, with
a recommendation that they serve at least 25 years.
Michael Hickey, Vincent's cousin, who was 17 at the time of the murder, was
ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure.
A fourth man, Pat Molloy, who was convicted of manslaughter, died in 1981 aged
53.
Regular protestations of the innocence of the four men have so far failed to
convince a succession of Home Secretaries or the courts.
Mr Maclean said yesterday that the Act, which implements some of the key
recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, would increase the
powers of magistrates courts to reopen cases to correct mistakes.
The new independent Review Commission would investigate possible miscarriages
of justice, and refer them to the courts.
The commission is expected to be set up in the coming year.
The new measures also allow for appeals in cases where a person who has been
convicted of an offence has died.
They widen the powers of magistrates courts to vary or withdraw a sentence, or
to order a matter to be reheard.
The Court of Appeal will be able to allow an appeal against an unsafe
conviction.
This replaces the three-fold grounds for appeal which were that a conviction
was unsafe or unsatisfactory, that it was wrong in question of law, or there
had been a ``material irregularity''.

David Ross reports on the achievements of a group
of crofters who have been quietly building a future
for their families on their own land
Melness crofters are currently preparing to take control of the 11,000 acres
being presented to them by their Nottinghamshire-based landlord Michael
Foljambe; their neighbours in Borgie, Skerray, and Tongue are wondering whether
the Countess of Sutherland can be persuaded to do likewise in the new year; and
everybody else connected to crofting is eagerly awaiting the Secretary of
State's White Paper. Crofting is in the headlines again.
The 20 crofters in the Skye townships of Borve and Annishader, meanwhile, are
going about their business, running their 4500 acres as they have done for the
past two years since their landlord agreed to sell; trying to build a future
for their families on their own land.
The Skye crofters have lived in the shadow of those in Assynt whose purchase in
December 1992 of the 21,000-acre North Lochinver estate from a bankrupt Swedish
land company, was to become such an inspiration to rural communities, and a
powerful symbol to the rest of Scotland. Although largely ignored, Borve's
achievement has also been crucially important and provides a more likely
blueprint for other townships dealing with private landlords.
In fact it was their landlord, Major John Macdonald, who first suggested that
the crofters should consider buying part of his Skeabost Estate. This was after
he and the crofters had failed to reach an agreement over a proposal for a
project under the 1991 Crofter Forestry Act.
There had been a tradition of particularly generous landlords on the Skeabost
Estate, most notably Major Macdonald's grandfather, Lachlan Macdonald, who took
over the estate in 1874. Reputed to be the richest man in Skye of his time, he
behaved in a manner uncharacteristic of the landowning class in the
nineteenth-century Highlands. He cancelled all arrears of his tenants and
allowed them to fix their own rents. These have remained largely unchanged.
But the people of the two townships realised that they needed more, they had to
prepare their community for the twenty-first century. Alistair Nicolson is a
native of Borve, the secretary and a director of the Borve and Annishader
Townships Ltd. He lived and worked abroad but now he is an information
technology adviser to Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise. But his place is Borve;
next door to his uncle, who lives in his grandfather's house; down the road
from his father.
``It was all kick-started some years ago by some of us wanting to diversify
from being wholly dependent on sheep and we were very aware of the declining
number of cattle. So we were looking for other options. The Crofter Forestry
Bill was going through Parliament at the time so we said we started to
investigate the possibilities. We talked to various bodies and realised it
wouldn't cost us an arm and a leg so we wrote asking for permission to plant 20
hectares from our landlord as we were required to do, but the letter came back
unsigned.
``He wasn't opposed to the principle but wanted to talk about the future
management of the estate. Eventually he suggested we buy our townships or the
whole estate. We had never suggested it, although it might have been at the
back of our minds after the earlier offer made by the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries to hand their crofts over.''
They discussed it among themselves and decided to try to purchase their own
crofts and common grazing, 1500 hectares in all. ``There had been some who
disagreed with the forestry project but there were no dissenters to the
buy-out, everybody was behind it. The news from Assynt had given us impetus.''
Negotiations were long and drawn out and lasted the best part of a year. In the
end the crofters decided to put in an offer based on the 1976 Crofting Act
formula of 15 times a fair rent, but their rent had been unchanged throughout
the century. So they updated it by multiplying the average by five and again by
15, giving a total of about #14,000.
``That was turned down flat, but we started to talk in that region. We added
something for goodwill and something for the sporting and mineral rights and we
came to #20,000. This was agreed on the basis that the sporting rights were
leased back to him on a 99-year lease, but there isn't any sporting activity
here anyway.''
The crofters had raised most of the money themselves and had a top-up loan from
the Highland Fund, but agreement was struck in principle in December 1993 and
it was recorded on January 31, 1994.
``The first thing we did was to get our forestry project off the ground, 20
hectares planted mainly at the beginning of this year, mostly native
broadleaves, but with some Scots pine and hybrid larch. We were looking to
forestry to provide support in the same way as sheep did through subsidies. It
provides a planting premium and an annual management premium which should bring
in about #1200 a year over 20 years.
``That was stage one, now the application for phase two is in for approval.
This is about 50 hectares near the main Portree/Uig road which should bring in
about #3000 a year. So that would be over #4000 coming into the community every
year, which over the 20 years is quite a lot of money to reinvest. We are also
looking at coppiced alder as a possible timber product in this second phase.''
As in Assynt, the people of Borve and Annishader are producing imaginative
projects to help develop their interests. They are already helping the setting
up of a riding school on their land. ``We originally thought of it as primarily
a tourist attraction, but most of the trade has been from local kids. On a
Saturday there are about 20 going there.''
They are also looking very seriously at the potential of wind power, harnessing
the winds that funnel down Loch Snizort from the north-west to generate
electricity which could then be sold to the national grid.
``Of course we could always sell house sites, we could pay off the #20,000 that
way, but that's not something we really want to do, apart from giving the young
people, the families growing up, a chance to stay here.''
But it is not just the crofters who have a stake in what is happening in Borve
and Annishader. Automatic membership of the Townships Ltd was given to all the
crofters who had paid the money, and they in turn appointed five directors from
their midst. But membership is also open to anybody who is living in the area,
although the directors retain the powers to ensure that the crofting element is
never swamped by non-crofting interests.
That in itself is almost a statement, a first principle, that the people of
Borve and Annishader will not forget what they are about, what their place
means to them.

IT'S a typical New York City street scene: a reckless taxi driver, ignoring
traffic and pedestrians, swerves across four lanes to pick up a pedestrian
illegally standing in the street.
Now mayor Rudolph Giuliani wants to ease the chronic congestion on city streets
and make them a more genteel place.
He has proposed a daytime ban on hailing cabs in the heart of New York, with
people instead lining up politely at taxi stands and drivers queuing up neatly
for passengers.
``This law cannot work,'' taxi driver Asif Chaudray said today. ``Most people
want, `Right here! Right now!' If you go 5ft further, they get crazy. They get
mad.''
Eric Jones, 29, of New York, who was waiting patiently for a cab outside the
Port Authority bus terminal, said: ``If I want a cab, I'm just going to get
one. And most likely, he'll pick me up. That's just how it works. People in New
York don't wait in line.''
Under Giuliani's proposal - the latest in his ``quality of life'' campaign that
has cracked down on beggars and public drinkers - taxi stands would operate
weekdays between 10am and 4pm in midtown New York.
Passengers could be dumped up to 30 yards from their destinations. Rebellious
cabbies could be fined up to $55.
In New York, stepping into traffic to hail a cab is a tradition dating to the
turn of the century. It worked in the days of the horse and cart.
``New York wouldn't feel like New York if you couldn't hail a cab,'' said
Aliona Ru, 34, who moved to Manhattan four years ago. ``It's more than a New
York tradition. It's a symbol of Manhattan.''
``How does a driver tell a visitor to New York City, loaded with luggage, that
the nearest taxi stop is 100 feet away?'' asked Lawrence Goldberg, an official
with the Taxi Drivers and Allied Workers Union.-AP.

FIFE Council warned yesterday that an increase in the budget for the police
might have to be paid for at the expense of other local services.
The council was responding to the Scottish Office, which had said Fife should
have 56 additional police officers on the beat in the next year but there would
be almost no extra funding for the increase.
Councillor John Simpson, vice chairman of the council's policy committee, said
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was continuing to cap council spending, and
Fife had been told that any increase in budgeted expenditure for 1996-97 of
more than 0.8% would be seen as an excessive increase.
This would result, he said, in a shortfall of funds available for the increased
number of police officers required, and would mean the cost would have to be
met from other parts of the budget.
Councillor Andrew Keddie, chairman of the council's public protection and
regulation committee, said: ``It's a case of giving with one hand and taking
away with the other.
``We would welcome having the additional police officers on the beat, but
community policing will become extremely difficult if it has to be at the
expense of other council services.''
The council has written to the Scottish Office for clarification on the issue.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night that Mr Forsyth had made law and
order a priority issue and would give Fife's letter full attention when he
received it.
The spokesman said that one method of getting more police officers on the beat
was to release them from clerical functions.

EDUCATION must be placed at the heart of the Europe of the future, the main
teachers' union has urged.
Mr Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland,
endorsed the thrust of the draft European Union White Paper on education and
training, Towards the Knowledge-Based Society.
The paper is the first main education statement by the EU since the Maastricht
Treaty placed education in the mainstream of European policy.
Mr Smith said: ``I am pleased to note the emphasis in the paper on the need for
a broad-based education where schools can provide each individual with an
understanding of the society in which they live, as well as a sense of
belonging to that society.
``In this respect the precedent set by the comprehensive system in Scotland
will be a major contribution to debate on the issue.''
He also welcomed the commitment to lifelong learning, the recognition of the
importance of vocational education in tackling unemployment, and the emphasis
on equal opportunites.
These were all areas to which the EIS, which represents eight out of 10
teachers, was committed. Mr Smith also highlighted the paper's commitment to
the status of teachers and lecturers. It would strike a chord in Scotland at a
time of severe cuts in public expenditure, he said.
The White Paper calls for increased public spending on education, particularly
in socially disadvantaged areas.
Mr Smith continued: ``With the possibility of a Scottish parliament with
control over education drawing closer, the need to give a proper priority to
education acquires a new focus, especially as the parliament will have direct
links with the other countries of the EU.''

A PENSIONER has been arrested after driving for at least 14 miles the wrong way
along a motorway with only three wheels on his car.
He was stopped only after these three wheels were punctured by spikes thrown
across the M4. He then crashed into a police car.
The 65-year-old had ignored drivers flashing their lights and police patrol
cars as he sped along the motorway with sparks flying from the front wheel hub
of his Volkswagen Jetta.
The drama happened shortly before 3am yesterday as the man, from Neasden,
north-west London, drove west along the eastbound carriageway.
He was eventually stopped near Reading, Berkshire, when police threw a Stinger
bed of spikes across the motorway.
Police were first alerted when a terrified motorist used a roadside SOS
telephone to report the Volkswagen was travelling the wrong way in the fast
lane. It was not clear how the car had lost a wheel.
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: ``The car was travelling at about
50mph on three wheels, with the metal hub of the front offside wheel bouncing
up and down on the motorway, causing sparks to fly off.
``We had a string of calls from worried drivers who saw the Volkswagen bearing
down on them on the wrong side of the motorway.
``Other officers used the Stinger device to stop the car and the motorist
slewed to a halt with all three remaining tyres punctured. The Volkswagen
eventually crashed into the back of a police car.''
A motorway patrol had blocked the eastbound lanes of the M4 at Reading and held
back traffic as the car sped towards them.
Officers arrested the motorist on suspicion of being unfit to drive through
drink or drugs. He was taken to Maidenhead police station, where he was still
being held in cells.
A police spokesman said the G-registered Jetta appeared to belong to the
pensioner although it was not known why he was driving the wrong way down the
motorway or where he had joined it.
``So far he has not given a word of explanation to the police,'' the spokesman
added.
``Fortunately no-one was injured in the incident. The motorway was much quieter
than usual because it was the early hours of Boxing Day.''

I WAS astonished that in Hamish Paton's article (Time for a tartan tax-break,
December 7) he made no reference to the economic situation of the Isle of Man.
Quasi-independent, it has complete freedom over tax-rates and legislation,
powers that Labour's proposed Scottish assembly can only dream of.
This is all the more poignant given the recent announcement that Loganair
(``Scotland's Airline'') is moving its headquarters to the Isle of Man and
showing the hypocrisy of the United Kingdom Government. ``Stick with the
Union,'' we are told, ``or you'll lose jobs and investment.''
Oh really? Why have companies like Loganair moved? Could it be anything to do
with the lower business taxation in this Crown dependency? Why should the Isle
of Man be given full autonomy to make laws and set taxes, yet Scotland not?
Could it be because the Isle of Man is suitable as a haven for rich Labour and
Tory MPs to stash their cash? Or could it be because London fears that an
independent Scotland would become a low business tax environment, encouraging
investment and real competition within the UK market, free from the incentives
of ``London weighting''?

DESPITE what you see when you look out of the window, it has not been a white
Christmas.
That is the ruling by weather experts south of the Border who insist that it is
not an official white Christmas unless it happens in London.
But bets which specified a city will be honoured. Glasgow had no actual
snowfall so bets naming there will lose, but Edinburgh had a few flakes and
bets there will be paid.
One Edinburgh man celeafter picked up #1000 on a #140 bet. Across the rest of
the UK, punters took more than #25,000 in winnings. No snow in London saved the
bookies #100,000.
English-based meteorologist Robert Ashwell said: ``It snowed in Aberdeen,
Edinburgh, Norwich, Belfast, Manchester, Nottingham, Newcastle, and Leeds. But
this year will not go down as a white Christmas because it did not snow in
London.''
Long-range forecaster Piers Corbyn correctly predicted snow falling or lying in
10 cities. The ``alternative'' meteorologist and astrophysicist made his
predictions in September, based on changes in the sun's particle activity, and
put the money on last month. He stands to collect up to #3000.
He said: ``We also predicted a bitterly cold Christmas to New Year spell - with
temperatures as low as minus 11 degrees Celsius in places and blizzards around
New Year's Eve turning to sleet and rain in the first few days of January.''

A SCOTTISH organisation is to circulate information about euthanasia on the
Internet.
The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society yesterday announced details of its
access point for information and news on subjects such as voluntary euthanasia,
living wills, and refusal of medical treatment.
Euthanasia groups in America, Canada, Australia, and Spain are already on the
Internet.
Fifteen electronic pages prepared by the Scottish group are currently available
on the computer network.
The society also distributes a book called Departing Drugs which tells people
how they can kill themselves.
But executive secretary Chris Docker said none of this information would be
transmitted on the 'Net.
``The book is only available to people who can prove they have been members of
a euthanasia group for at least three months,'' he said.
``It is a rule we have to discourage emotionally upset teenagers. We will
certainly not be giving information on how to kill yourself on the Internet.
``We want to supply up-to-date information and informed comment. We are mainly
a research and liaison group and this is an important aspect of liaison.''

Plane hijack
bid foiled
DUBAI: An Ethiopian passenger tried to storm the cockpit of a Saudi Arabian
airliner on a flight from Asmara to Addis Ababa yesterday but was overpowered
by the crew, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said. One of the crew
members was injured as they overpowered the man who rushed towards the cockpit,
armed with a paper knife and a broken glass bottle, SPA said, quoting an
official of the state-owned Saudia airlines.
Bomb suspects
PESHAWAR: Pakistani police identified two Persian-speaking Afghans yesterday as
the bombers who killed 42 people in the northwestern city of Peshawar last
week. Both are on the run and may have fled the country. Peshawar has a large
population of Afghan refugees who fled their country during civil war since
1979.
Three beheaded
PARIS: Gunmen, thought to be Muslim rebels, have kidnapped and beheaded three
peasants and dumped their bodies by a roadside near Algiers, an Algerian
newspaper said yesterday. Quoting victims' families and witnesses, the paper
said the peasants were killed because they had spurned guerrilla demands for
money to support their violent campaign against the government and refused to
have their sons join the rebels.
Mafia arrest
CREMONA: The desire of an alleged Mafia chief to spend Christmas with his
family led to his arrest, Italian police said yesterday. Eugenio Barresi, 35,
was arrested at the home of a friend as he celebrated the holiday with his wife
and two children, police said. They said investigators tracked him down after
discovering his family had travelled from the Sicilian city of Messina to an
area outside the northern town of Cremona.
Beach clashes
SYDNEY: Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of Christmas revellers early
yesterday as crowds attacked a bus and cars at Sydney's famous Bondi beach,
police said. Two policemen were slightly hurt as police were struck by bottles,
stones and other objects thrown by revellers, many of them drunk, a spokesman
said. There were no arrests.
Trawler sinks
OSLO: One seaman was found dead and nine were reported missing after a Russian
trawler sank in a storm in Arctic waters off Norway yesterday, Norwegian
authorities said. 15 seamen were rescued by a companion Russian trawler and
were said to be in good condition. Officials had previously reported only 14
were rescued.
Feathers fly
NAIROBI: Kenya staged its first ostrich race yesterday with Flash Harry taking
track honours in a 200-metre sprint. Six riders and their birds battled it out
on the Ngong racecourse on the outskirts of Nairobi. Stewards looked on aghast
as several race birds scampered off to a premature start.
Yeltsin moves
MOSCOW: Russian President Boris Yeltsin left a sanatorium where he had been
recovering from a heart ailment and moved to a neighbouring country residence,
his press service said yesterday. It said Yeltsin, 64, would follow doctors'
instructions during his stay at the Barvikha residence, near Moscow. Itar-Tass
news agency said he would mark the New Year there with his family.

A SERIES of festive season fires left five people, including a two-year-old
girl, dead and one woman fighting for her life last night.
A man aged 94 died on Christmas Day after falling on to an electric heater in
his home.
A woman neighbour was alerted when she heard John Rae's smoke alarm going off.
She found him lying in agony across the heater with his trousers on fire, but
was unable to pull him clear of the blistering heat.
She ran back into the street and with the help of a male passer-by managed to
lift Mr Rae off the heater and put out the flames.
They comforted Mr Rae, a widower who lived alone at Wellfield Road, in Hawick,
until an ambulance arrived.
He was taken to Borders General Hospital where he later died as a result of
extensive burns.
The neighbour who went to Mr Rae's aid was treated in hospital for shock.
Meanwhile, a woman was fighting for her life in hospital last night after being
overcome by smoke in a blaze at her home in Brechin Road, Arbroath.
Mrs Alison Smith, who is in her thirties, was taken to Perth Royal Infirmary
after firefighters found her slumped in her living room on Monday night.
The alarm was raised by a brother who had gone to visit her.
The woman's husband was last night maintaining a bedside vigil and her
condition was said to be ``poorly''.
Police said that the minor fire, thought to have been started accidentally, was
swiftly extinguished.
In Wales, a mother and her two-year-old daughter died yesterday when fire swept
through the upper storey of their home in Llanybri, near Carmarthen.
The woman's husband escaped by leaping through a bedroom window before forcing
his way back through a rear door to rescue their two other daughters, aged four
and five.
He was detained in hospital for treatment to severe cuts sustained as he
smashed his way through the bedroom window to escape the flames.
The two rescued children were taken to hospital for observation but were not
injured.
It took firefighters 90 minutes to bring the blaze under control and a fire
service spokesman said: ``It appears to have started in one of the bedrooms and
spread through the ceiling.''
An inquiry into the cause was under way last night but police said they did not
suspect foul play.
Police were withholding the names of the family until next of kin had been
traced.
In Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, an 80-year-old woman, who has not been named,
was burned to death after slipping on to the fire in the living room of her
home.
A police spokesman said: ``It looks as if she may have fallen across the fire
and set herself alight.''
The cause of a blaze which killed 90-year-old William Benson in his home in
Grasmere, Cumbria, yesterday was still being investigated last night.

HAVE you heard the one about the Hogmanay haddock? This is not a reference to
one of the less successful turns at this year's TV Ne'erday shows but a
particular type of fish swimming in the waters round Scotland.
A couple of years back the whys and whereabouts of this festive fish dominated
the debate at European Standing Committee B in the House of Commons. The point
at issue was whether the haddock in question realised that the quota year ended
with the calendar and that in terms of regulation it was okay for fishermen to
catch them on Ne'erday but off limits for them to be caught on Hogmanay.
Did the haddock go into hiding at the start of the year as they realised the
nets were out looking for them once again or did they summon forth
reinforcements to cope with the restart of the quota allocations?
In reality haddock and all the other fish do get a few days respite at the turn
of the year since the pride of the Scottish fleet has been safely in port since
last Friday and will remain there until well into next week. The real question,
therefore, is will the hard-pressed Scottish fishing industry get some respite
over the coming 12 months or will it continue to drift from crisis to crisis.
Last week saw the curtain come down again on the annual pantomime of fisheries
negotiations. The plot is the same for every performance. The principal boy,
otherwise known as the English Fisheries Minister, goes into battle to deal
with a crisis situation, and comes out claiming the biggest victory over the
Spaniards since Drake drubbed the first Armada.
He then appeals to the fishing community to hail his success and is greeted by
a loud chorus of ``Oh no you haven't''.
The anger of fishing communities is understandable. Not only are they facing
regulation but they are under restrictions which make no sense either from the
economic or the conservation point of view.
Take the quota allocations for example. The constant refrain of Fisheries
Ministers is that tight quotas protect stocks for the future.
However, the fishermen know better. One of the consequences of tough quotas is
actually to increase the amount of fish being caught. First it increased the
number of discards - that is the good fish thrown back dead into the sea after
being caught in the nets.
This happens in two ways. First, the waters around Scotland are mixed fisheries
where the various species are caught together. This means that fish which are
out of quota are caught with ones which still have allocations to land. Thus
the regulations prescribe that the over-quota fish should be returned dead into
the sea.
Second, when only a small quota allocation is allowed it puts a premium on
landing decent-sized fish and thus the boats select the very best from their
catch with the smaller fish tipped over the side.
It should be stressed that these discards are quite legal as opposed to the
``black'' fish on non-market landings which are the other consequence of people
being faced with breaking the quotas or breaking up their boats. It is not easy
to feel comfortable about the operation of a conservation policy which says it
is acceptable to dump fish dead into the sea but unacceptable to land the same
fish at official markets.
However, that is exactly the policy framework which the pantomime players have
been defending over the past few years which is why Fisheries Minister Tony
Baldry would be hard pushed to beat Jack the Ripper in a straight electoral
contest in any fishing port.
While other fleets receive the policy priority and support from their
governments, fishing is treated in the United Kingdom as a poor relation.
That can be judged in a number of ways. Most dramatically in terms of
structural support where, thanks to the obduracy of John Selwyn Gummer as the
former Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the industry was frozen out of
European assistance available to every other fleet across the Continent.
Then, more recently, there was the mysterious deal by which Spain was allowed
to rewrite its own Treaty of Accession to the European Union in order to gain
entry into western waters some six years ahead of the agreed timetable.
Whatever was offered by Spain in exchange for this remarkable concession we can
be reasonably sure it had nothing to do with the fishing industry.
Spain now dictates Fisheries Policy from within the European Union while Norway
calls the shots in joint negotiations from outside the Common Fisheries Policy.
Little wonder under these circumstances why Scottish fishermen feel out in the
cold.
There is a glimmer of light at the end of this long tunnel. On his way out of
the fisheries talks last week with his mind concentrated by the Government
humiliation in the House of Commons, Mr Baldry remarked that perhaps in future
the annual quota policy could be modified to take account of technical
conservation - ie designing nets and fishing gear which would allow young fish
to escape alive rather than being discarded dead into the sea.
That exactly this approach had been pressed on successive Ministers by
exasperated fishermen over the past seven years is not beside the point. What
Scottish fishermen require is a Government which will see fishing as one of the
great natural resource industries of the nation. Not something to be traded
away for wider interests. When the industry achieves that degree of policy
support then more fish than just the Hogmanay haddock will be able to swim
happily in the sea.

AS we put 1995 behind us and, in particular, the commemoration services for VE
and VJ Days, there is a real danger that we will also put the Second World War
behind us.
In fact, as power in the world passes into the hands of people who grew up
after the war, the need for strengthening and sharpening the nation's memories
of the horrors (as well as the heroisms) of the 1939-45 war is greater than
ever.
I write this letter as a former 2nd (Hong Kong) Battalion Royal Scot. Hong
Kong, sacrificed by Churchill as an ``inevitable casualty of war'', with the
troops only to be given their day-to-day orders, and otherwise to be told
nothing, was a uniquely tragic disaster area.
In the two weeks leading up to Christmas 1941 when the colony capitulated to
the Japanese Imperial Army, the spirit of Christmas was totally transcended (if
that is the right word) by the cruel and sadistic spirit of Bushido; and the
following four years were disfigured by atrocities so shameful that it would be
an insult to the animal world to call them bestial.
My resolutions for 1996 will be: (1) to send greetings to the survivors of
these tragic and terrible times, including the gallant Rajputs and the brave
young Canadian soldiers who (insult being added to injury) were dispatched to
Hong Kong as a face-saving gesture, and dispatched, therefore, to certain
defeat and humiliation.
(2) To get the Japanese to stop apologising and start to provide us with hard
evidence that they have turned their backs on the despicable behaviour of their
armed forces in the Second World War. Until that is done, the names Mitsubishi,
Toyota, Suzuki, and Yamaha will continue to make my stomach turn.
(3) To get the British Government to ``swear on oath'' that they will never
again fail to live up to their responsibilities, as they did in respect of Hong
Kong 54 years ago.

PHILIP Greig's letter (December 19) is timely.
Whatever Ian Lang said about the Forestry Commission woodlands remaining in the
public sector, it is now (and for all I know, was in his day) policy that the
commission must divest itself of 10% of its landholding by the year 2000,
and/or achieve a figure of #7-10m a year via land sales. Obtaining information
on this subject is not easy, but if I am wrong no doubt some spokesperson will
correct my figures.
This income, obtained in effect by divesting itself of capital, goes into the
Forest Enterprise funds, just as the income from the sale of timber or
Christmas trees, both renewable resources, would do.
As I understand it, Forest Enterprise has to reach a certain income target each
year. If circumstances force a reduced income from timber sales (and as the
timber price is decreed by international markets, we can do little in Britain
to influence timber prices), the pressure to increase land sales to make up the
timber shortfall will be immense. The ``bottom line'', which is always
important, is now everything.
There are only two forest types which are not for sale (at present). First
where the local populace make significant use of the forest for social
purposes; walking, birdwatching, orienteering, etc. Secondly where the forest
timber production is required for ongoing legally binding long-term contracts
with sawmillers, etc.
This ties in well with Mr Greig's quotation from John Gummer: ``The key
benefits (of selling off the FC) are that it would raise money, and would get
the forest estate out of the public sector''.
Mr Greig comments on privatisation by the back door; how right he is.
A recent gambit is to pressure the FC into contracting out the replanting of
felled areas to private operators, with little experience, if any, of this work
- which is far more difficult than the original plough planting ever was. It
also requires much more intensive supervision if it is to be successful.
The Gummers and Forsyths of this world, alas, seem ignorant of forestry, and
they refuse to believe that those who serve or served in state forestry ever
actually earned their salaries. Far better was the man in a forestry company;
the fact that he was entirely dependent on a 98% tax handout of taxpayers'
money, insulating him from any semblance of the real world, is conveniently
forgotten.
If Mr Greig expects integrity, yes, and a pride in the long-term achievements
of the Forestry Commission from this present crop of political carpetbaggers,
he is being unrealistic.
The days of the Willie Whitelaws, Ian Macleods, and the Buchanan-Smiths are
long gone. The giants of the political integrity forest are gone; we are left
with the scrub.

FIVE crew members of a South Korean trawler seized by the North were handed
back today with the remains of three colleagues, and media reports said the
gesture may help Pyongyang win rice aid to relieve famine.
Bundled up in winter coats, the five sailors carrying identical grey suitcases
marched across the border crossing point at the village of Panmunjom after
turning to wave to their captors and shout ``thank you''.
Ashes of three others contained in boxes wrapped in white cloth were handed to
Red Cross representatives who handed them them to weeping relatives.
Survivors said one fisherman was shot and killed and another died in a fire
when their vessel, the Woosung 86, was captured in May. The third died of
illness.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted a diplomatic source as saying officials
from Seoul, Washington and Tokyo would hold a two-day summit starting on
January 24 in Hawaii to discuss resuming food aid to the North.
Washington would be represented by Winston Lord, the senior official for East
Asia and the Pacific, Tokyo by deputy foreign minister Shunji Yanai and Seoul
by deputy foreign minister Lee Jai-chun, Yonhap quoted the source in Seoul as
saying.
South Korean officials could not confirm the report.
Seoul shipped 150,000 tonnes of rice earlier this year but halted further
deliveries in October after after public opinion turned against President Kim
Young-sam for delivering aid without extracting the release of the boat and its
crew.
South Korea ignored a United Nations call to maintain the aid flow and asked
Japan and its allies to follow suit. Tokyo has sent 300,000 tonnes of a
promised consigment of 500,000 tonnes of rice.
Aid agencies say North Korea needs almost four million tonnes of rice to
prevent mass starvation after floods ruined the summer grain crop.
Before the five crew were repatriated, North Korea's state-run Korean Central
News Agency reported that the captain had apologised for ``intruding'' into
Northern waters.
Captain Pak Jae-ryol had ``expressed sincere and deep thanks to the authorities
of the North for showing leniency and compatriotic hospitality and sending them
back''.
After crossing the border, Pak told reporters: ``We were cared for very well''.
Crew member Kim Bu-gon echoed his comments, although he said the group had
survived on a diet of gruel at the inn in which they were held.
The five crew warmly shook hands with North Korean military officers and
civilian officials before walking across the border and being embraced by their
tearful relatives.
Tension is mounting on the Korean peninsula as Pyongyang masses war planes and
stages military maneouvres close to the heavily-fortified Demilitarised Zone
that has divided the two Koreas since the 1950-53 Korean War.
Japan warned yesterday that starving refugees may start flowing into China from
North Korea.
``We cannot turn a blind eye to this situation in a neighbouring country, and
together with South Korea and the United Nations, we must adopt appropriate
measures,'' said Koken Nosaka, Japan's top government spokesman.
In a sign that worsening food problems are prompting an ideological tightening
in the beleaguered North, the Pyongyang media yesterday extensively reported
comments by Kim Jong-il demanding respect for ``revolutionary elders''.
Today the Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim - who has yet to inherit
the title of president and secretary general of the ruling Korean Worker's
Party from his late father Kim Il-sung - made his first public appearance in
more than one month yesterday.-Reuter.

JOHN MacCalman's review of Strathclyde's Structure Plan (December 18) was weak
in its analysis of the problems associated with regenerating Glasgow's deprived
areas and derelict sites.
He gave the impression that if it had not been for some unwelcome political
pressure here and a derelict land grant there, substantially more would have
been achieved.
The fact is that structure plans alone cannot achieve sustainable regeneration.
An effective regeneration strategy requires a multi-agency approach involving
not only the local authorities, but also the local enterprise companies,
Scottish Homes, government departments, the private sector, the community, and
others.
Working partnerships are difficult to achieve. Even within Strathclyde Regional
Council itself the actions of some departments did not seem to be consistent
with its structure plan or its anti-poverty strategies.
The challenge for the new unitary councils is not just to sink their
differences in the Clyde Valley Joint Advisory Committee.
They must fight departmentalism within and seek meaningful partnerships with
other agences.

I AM happy to reply to Mr McLaughland's letter regarding the plans to reopen
the Forth &amp; Clyde and Union canals (December 19).
The Millennium Link is a project which has been driven by the aspirations of
ordinary people in communities right across Scotland.
Our partnership not only includes the recognised public agencies but involves
local communities which have a direct interest in their environment. It was
these people who demanded that the opportunity to resubmit a revised proposal
should not be missed.
The project aims to take a neglected but nevertheless magnificent piece of
Scottish engineering and transform it for a vibrant and viable new use. It has
something for everyone, and is easily accessible to 70% of Scotland's
population.
Over 100 schools are within 10 minutes' walk of the canals. Surely the lottery
is about giving something back to communities. We are confident that the
project matches the criteria set down by the Millennium Commission.
Lottery monies are only part of the story. Other competitive funds are also
needed to achieve succss. Again, the partnership is confident the project
stands scrutiny. Urban and rural regeneration will deliver 1500 jobs during
construction, over 4000 permanent new jobs, and an annual injection of over
#40m to the Scottish economy.
Massive public support and pressure from communities convinced the Millennium
Link partnership to resubmit. The original bid was for #50m of Millennium Fund
monies towards a total project cost of #100m, with all work to be complete in
the year 2000. The revised bid for #30m envisages a two-stage project with
ultimate completion by 2010, at a total cost of #95m.
Navigation is not the main objective of the Millennium Link. It is the vital
ingredient that provides a catalyst to release the benefits. Far more people
will benefit from land-based activity than will ever use the water, but
worldwide experience has shown that the water must be actively used to
stimulate other activity.
Local experience has shown that restoring discrete sections cannot provide the
impetus in the canal corridor that the whole project can. Providing a
cross-Scotland link and making the physical connection between communities is
crucial. It is the completeness of the Link idea that makes it millennial.
The plans have never seriously envisaged the re-creation of an unlimited
headroom ship canal or freight link between the Forth and the Clyde. I totally
agree with Mr McLaughland that opening bridges would cause unacceptable
congestion and this has never been viewed as a practical option.
Indeed, the bridges recently built as part of the Glasgow Canal Project, such
as at The Stables restaurant near Kirkintilloch, demonstrate that fixed bridges
are the favoured solution.
The Millennium Link is not about resurrecting a piece of nostalgia. It is about
providing an invaluable educational, environmental heritage, tourism, and
recreational resource which can significantly add to the quality of life in
central Scotland.

THE murdered Kilmarnock teenager, Mhairi Julyan, may have been arguing with a
youth on the night of her death, according to the police.
A witness has reported seeing a girl similar to Mhairi's description apparently
having a row with a young man outside the Broomhill Hotel in the town's London
Road, at 10.30pm on Saturday, December 16.
The incident was one of two possible sightings of Mhairi released yesterday by
police hunting the 16-year-old's killer.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder, who is heading the inquiry, also gave
details of a man seen running from the area where she disappeared.
He appealed for further information on the sightings, and urged anyone
described by the police to come forward and eliminate themselves.
Mr Lauder said: ``It is possible that two of these were sightings of Mhairi. If
so, she was with someone else who knows something. But we are not sure, and the
people who saw that person are unable to take the description any further.''
The first incident involves the young couple outside the hotel.
The teenage girl, who was sitting on the wall, had dark curly hair, possibly
shoulder length, and was wearing a black bomber jacket. The male, also a
teenager, had short hair, and was wearing a dark waist-length jacket and dark
trousers.
Shortly afterwards, three young people were seen at a telephone kiosk at the
corner of Melville Street and London Road. The female outside the booth was a
teenager about 5ft tall, with longish hair, wearing a dark Hoi Polloi bomber
jacket - similar to the one worn by Mhairi on the night of her death - and
either a long dark skirt or dark trousers.
The male with her was also a teenager, with dark hair, wearing possibly jeans
and a dark, silky blouson jacket, while the male in the kiosk was aged about
17/18, with short blond hair, and wearing a light top. Mr Lauder said the third
appeal related to a man seen running from Samson Avenue, across London Road,
and up a pathway between Alloway Avenue and Dunure Drive at 12.30am on the
Sunday. He was between 18 and 30, 6ft 2in tall, of slim to medium build,
possibly with fair hair, and wearing a fawn sweatshirt and jeans.
Mhairi's body was found near a bus station in the town the day after she
disappeared while returning home from attending a pantomime in Kilmarnock's
Palace Theatre.
Mr Lauder asked the public to continue giving his team the ``tremendous
assistance'' they had so far offered, and said he was convinced that someone
still held vital information. People noticing that relatives or friends were
experiencing unexplained mood swings or acting out of character should contact
the police in confidence.

<HEADLINE>Higher social class the main factor School lesson on myth of parent power</HEADLINE>

PARENT power is a myth, according to a Europe-wide survey of their involvement
in schooling.
There has also in Scotland been an increase in parental apathy, with fewer
applying for school boards.
The research, carried out by the European Parents Association, focuses on their
role in school management.
It concludes that parental involvement is almost exclusively in the hands of
middle and upper class representatives, partly because expertise is required
for the role, which favours graduates, civil servants, teachers, and high-level
technicians.
This has led to the emergence of a few ``super parents''. The way school
administrations and even local authorities designate parents ``makes any form
of democratic participation a dead letter, guaranteeing its failure,'' says the
association.
Parents who do become involved find that the reality of the job is far greater
than the role envisaged for them.
``The decentralisation of areas of responsibility from the central
administrative level to school level generally leads to an increase in
workload, in the expertise required, and in the decision-making procedures at
the individual school level,'' says the research, published today.
Across Europe, parents are invited to participate in the management of
education, which generally means joining consultative groups and
decision-making bodies at school level.
However, says the association, this form of participative management ``is
imposing on parents an increasing burden of responsibility in the schools, and
is giving rise to some resistance and disaffection on the part of . . . the
parents.''
The Scottish Parent Teacher Council, a member association of the EPA, said the
autumn round of school board elections confirmed a growing trend of parental
apathy in Scotland.
Only 60% of Strathclyde region's schools now have full boards, and of those
less than 9% had elections. The remainder secured the minimum number of parents
to fill arising vacancies and they were appointed without election.
The authority has half of Scotland's schools in its area. Mrs Judith Gillespie,
convener of the SPTC, said there was a mixed picture in the remainder of
Scotland, with Tayside region showing similar returns, but Lothian providing
better voting returns.
The SPTC said parents were too busy to take on what amounted to another
part-time job. It feared that parental reluctance to join boards would increase
because of devolved school management (DSM), under which heads are responsible
for the vast majority of school-based spending.
All schools will operate under DSM by April next year and parents will be able
to have a say in the appointment of all staff, if they wish. But the SPTC
feared that this new management would impose extra burdens on parents.
The EPA research also advises governments not to overestimate parent power.
``The school is the school . . . The problems and future mistakes of this
institution must not be placed on the shoulders of the parents,'' it says in a
clear warning of the dangers of taking short-term, politically motivated
decisions which do not act in the long-term interests of schools or their
pupils.
The SPTC will discuss the EPA report at a meeting with the Scottish Office
Minister for Education, Mr Raymond Robertson, in the new year.

Edendale, South Africa, Tuesday
AT least 119 people were killed and many more are missing in floods caused by
heavy rains in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
Police divers, rescue teams, residents and helicopters today were pulling
bodies from the Umsunduzi river and its tributary, the Slangspruit, which burst
their banks.
Police spokesman Henry Budrum said 119 bodies had been recovered so far. He
added: ``We expect to find more bodies as the water level drops. We are
searching tonight and we will continue searching tomorrow.''
The victims all lived in Imbali next to the Edendale black township outside
Pietermaritzburg.
Fresh rainstorms, with thunder and lightning, hit the area yesterday. ``It is
not as severe as on Monday. The problem is the ground is so saturated at the
moment that the water runs straight into the river,'' said Mr Gary Ronald,
traffic information officer for the province.
``There are cars stuck against trees and there is clothing all over the river
banks after houses were washed away. The sheer force of the water also washed
all the vegetation away,'' he added.
Distraught residents scoured the river banks searching for relatives while a
police helicopter lifted bodies. Men, women, and children waded through mud and
bushes, many crying in anguish after discovering the bodies of relatives.
Mortuary workers said the majority of those who died appeared to have been in
their late teens. ``People have been coming to look for up to 10 people per
family,'' one mortuary worker said.
Imbali resident Enock Nhlangulela said he had lost nine relatives in the
floods. ``So far we have recovered four bodies. But we are still missing five
relatives, including my three-week old sister.
``I was lucky because I went to visit friends when the heavy rains came. When I
returned I found everyone and everything inside the house had been washed
away,'' he said.
Mrs Pendukile Masikane, 50, said she had lost her husband and a daughter.
``The water came inside and washed everything away including my husband and my
child. I managed to make it to safety, but I have lost everything, even my
house was swept away,'' she said.
The people who lost their homes were being accommodated in community halls in
the local township. Provincial parliamentarian Sifiso Nkabinde said the
regional government had declared Imbali township a disaster area.
q At least 20 people died in flooding and mudslides caused by torrential rain
in southern Brazil, the civil defence force said today.
A force spokesman said the death toll could rise in the southern state of Santa
Catarina, where rain had been heaviest, and that at least 2000 people had been
made homeless in the state.
There were also heavy downpours in the neighbouring state of Rio Grande do Sul,
which had been dry since October. About 1300 people were evacuated from their
homes due to the rain.
q Floods and landslides caused by weeklong rains in northeastern provinces of
the Philippines have killed at least 18 people, authorities said today.
The rain caused rivers to spill over into low-lying towns, disrupting Christmas
festivities and sending thousands of families fleeing to higher ground in towns
in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela and Aurora, about 170 miles northeast of
Manila..-Reuter.

Septic shock girl
in critical state
A 16-YEAR-OLD Oban girl suffering from pneumonia and septic shock remained in a
critical condition last night in Glasgow's Royal Infirmary.
Lorraine Watt, from Dunbeg, fell ill on Christmas Eve and was flown to Glasgow
when her condition deteriorated further on Monday. She had developed septic
shock which affected her kidneys, lungs, and circulation.
Oil pique
THE Scottish National Party yesterday spoke out against forecasts that North
Sea oil revenues would reach a new peak of #3000m next financial year. Energy
spokeswoman Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland could not afford to lose the #3000m
to Westminster.
Victims named
TWO men who died in separate Christmas Day road accidents were yesterday named
by police. Mr George Lawrence, 71, of Seafield Road, Broughty Ferry, Dundee,
died of a suspected heart attack while driving in the city. Mr William Hunter,
60, of Strathclyde Road, Motherwell, died after collapsing at the wheel of his
car en route to Aberdeen.
Taxing times
THE average worker toils for 142 days a year to pay their tax bill, economists
have revealed. The Adam Smith Institute report calculates that we work from
January to the middle of May before our debt to the Exchequer is settled.
Archers denial
BBC insiders yesterday denied that Britain's longest-running radio soap, The
Archers, would feature an Aids storyline in the new year. A spokesman said:
``This is just groundless rumour.''
Mission post
THE Rev Dr Leslie Milton, of the Presbytery of Melrose and Peebles in the
Borders, is to take up a teaching appointment at the Ricalto United Seminary
near Maputo in Mozambique.
Pool resources
DIVERS with the Cumbernauld Sub-Aqua Club have raised about #400 for charity by
swimming a mile each under water. Eight divers equipped with scuba gear swam 64
pool lengths to raise funds for the Cash for Kids Christmas appeal.
Robbery charge
A 39-YEAR-OLD man appeared on a charge of assault and robbery at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court yesterday in connection with an alleged incident in a city shop
at the weekend. Daniel McGlynn, of Restalrig Crescent, Edinburgh, appeared
briefly before Sheriff Roger Craik. The case was continued.

A TIRED-LOOKING Pope John Paul gave his holiday greetings to the world today
after his Christmas Day celebrations were disrupted by a bout of influenza.
``Thank you for coming here today and yesterday, thank you so much,'' the Pope
said, speaking from the window of his private apartments overlooking St Peter's
Square.
``I wish you, in this Christmas season, a special blessing of the Lord,'' he
said.
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the 75-year-old pontiff was
feeling better although he still had a slight fever, and said the rest of his
holiday schedule would not be affected by the illness.
``Absolutely nothing has changed on his end of year programme,'' Navarro-Valls
told reporters, adding the Pope's doctor had ordered him to have a few day's
rest.
``The slight disturbance which the Holy Father suffered yesterday is improving
all the time both in terms of the slight fever and the stomach problems, which
are now almost gone,'' the spokesman said.
Pilgrims in St Peter's Square cheered and applauded as the Pope appeared at the
window today to deliver an Angelus prayer and blessing.
He looked tired and drawn as he read slowly from a written text. His voice
wavered at times and he stumbled over the words at one point.
At the end, he resumed his Christmas greetings which were cut short yesterday
when he abruptly stopped his ``Urbi et Orbi'' message to Rome and the world
after suddenly feeling sick.
The Pope said ``Happy Christmas'' in only Italian, French, English, Spanish,
Portugese, German and Polish - while he had been scheduled yesterday to give
the greeting in 54 languages.
The Pope also had missed Christmas Day Mass in St Peter's basilica after his
doctors ordered rest for fever and influenza. It was the first time since he
became Pope in 1978 that he had missed the Christmas Mass.
Navarro-Valls said the Pope held Mass in his private chapel today after getting
up at his usual time, 6.15am.
``He is in good spirits,'' the spokesman said, adding that the pontiff had
received clearance from his doctor to make today's appearance.
The Pope normally gives this Angelus at his residence in Castelgandolfo, south
of Rome, but doctors ordered him to stay at the Vatican to rest and recover
from his illness.
He now has no appearances scheduled until celebration of the traditional Te
Deum vespers on December 31 in Rome.-Reuter.

HYDRO-ELECTRIC managers face a grilling from an MP and community leaders after
coming in for stinging criticism over the blackouts.
Western Isles Labour MP Calum MacDonald highlighted job cuts by the privatised
company and will meet the company chiefs later this week. He is also to table
parliamentary questions on the subject.
Mr Macdonald said he feared the recent job cuts by Hydro-Electric were reducing
the service to islanders.
``I will be asking whether recent job losses at Stornoway power station, for
example, had anything to do with the continuing power cuts around the islands.''
Lewis councillor Roddy Murray said: ``The profit motive has affected the way
the company used to operate in the best interests of their customers.
``Pleas by the elderly and parents with young children have been met with at
best non-commitment and in some instances downright hostility. Clearly the
company no longer has the resources to cope with emergencies. Our people must
never have to go through this again.''
But a Hydro-Electric spokeswoman rejected claims that the skeleton staff on
standby over the holiday period had been too small to react quickly to the
blizzards.
She said: ``I can appreciate the frustration when people are without power for
so long at this time of year, but we are pulling out all the stops to restore
supplies - it is a major task.
``We would strongly refute any suggestion that our workforce was not strong
enough to cope - it was simply down to the horrendous weather conditions.''

ALL the ingredients of a modern thriller are in the campaign to stop the
building of an electricity link between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Politics, intrigue, big money, and international business have combined to
produce a heady mix during this almost classic environmental struggle.
The STOP (Stop the overhead powerlines) Campaign was founded three years ago at
the first sign of plans by ScottishPower and Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE)
to build a 250mw interconnector between Coylton in Ayrshire and Islandmagee in
East Antrim. A huge protest meeting in Maybole Town Hall, attended by many
hundreds of protesters and with speakers from Northern Ireland and Scotland,
forced the utility giants to alter the planned route for their #200m scheme.
However, new plans indicated that 203 giant steel pylons would march across
some of Scotland's most spectacular rural scenery, terminating in a massive
converter station south of Ballantrae. From there, 40 miles of undersea cable
would take power from Scotland to another gigantic converter station built in
the scenic splendour of Islandmagee, County Antrim. More pylons and wirescape
were planned for Northern Ireland.
Soon, NIAG (North Islandmagee Action Group) joined STOP in the battle to win
the right for public inquiries at which the protesters' case could be aired.
2000 letters were sent to the Prime Minister, to the then Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang, and to Prince Charles.
Before long, STOP and NIAG had prepared a 1500-name petition which was handed
to the President of the European Parliament, Klaus Haensch, on his first day in
office.
Meanwhile, a thick dossier of evidence was being compiled by the secretariat of
the President's Committee, with enthusiastic assistance and input from Northern
Ireland MEPs Ian Paisley and John Hume, and South of Scotland MEP Alex Smith.
The protesters' high-profile campaign bore fruit. Ian Lang agreed to call for a
full public inquiry. His announcement was quickly followed by a similar
declaration from the Northern Ireland authorities. When the Scottish inquiry
opened in Ayr, the campaigners, represented by PS Public Affairs Consultants
from Edinburgh, forced Commissioner Bruce Millan to release the highly
sensitive but crucial Ove Arup Report. This report, authorised by the European
Commission, had concluded that the interconnector was ``not the most economic
option in pure generation terms''.
NIE fought to prevent its publication, claiming that it contained commercially
sensitive information. Its release exploded like a hand grenade in the middle
of the Ayr inquiry and led to a two-week postponement of the entire inquiry and
a four-month postponement of the economic case.
In Northern Ireland, NIAG had been joined by Belfast City Council and
Newtownabbey and Larne Borough Councils, all of whom were determined to prove
that the interconnector would import high-cost electricity to the Province and
export jobs. The objectors scored an immediate hit when they uncovered a breach
of European law in the method employed by NIE to publicise their plans.
A six-month postponement of the public inquiry was granted to enable this
breach to be remedied.
ScottishPower and NIE were now smarting at the mammoth cost of these delays to
their multi-million pound project, now estimated to run to some #100m.
They fought back by claiming that the interconnection between Scotland and
Northern Ireland was stated Government policy and could not, therefore, be
challenged in a planning inquiry. The presiding commissioner at the inquiry in
Larne agreed and ruled that no economic evidence would be allowed.
The objectors immediately called for a judicial review, creating a further
precedent. This was to be the first time a public inquiry ruling had ever been
judicially reviewed in the Province. After five arduous days of argument and
debate in the High Court in Belfast, the judicial review found in favour of the
presiding commissioner and ruled all economic evidence as inadmissible.
The pendulum had swung back towards the utility companies. The objectors' case,
based on interviews with over 200 of the key industries, generators, economists
and politicians in Scotland and Northern Ireland, pointed to the fact that the
project was totally uneconomic and indeed would fail in its central objective
of delivering lower-cost electricity to the Province.
Large protest meetings were held in Northern Ireland and industry
representatives came together to draw up a dossier outlining their concern
about the interconnector and highlighting how the construction of a power plant
in the Province would be much more economically attractive, providing hundreds
of jobs.
By presenting this evidence to the Electricity Regulator in Northern Ireland,
the objectors forced him to launch a detailed investigation, the results of
which were published in June. He concluded that the Scottish interconnector was
``on average #100m more expensive than other options, after an EU grant has
been taken into account but before strategic benefits have been considered''.
In other words, the interconnector was #161m worse than other options for
locally generated power, if the #61m EU grant was discounted.
It was now clear that ScottishPower and NIE were hellbent on implementing a
project aimed at providing their shareholders with lucrative profits at the
expense of wrecking the environment in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland
and inflicting serious damage on the Ulster economy. The admission by the
Northern Ireland Regulator that he had shown a draft copy of his top-secret
report to NIE prior to its publication, but not to any of the other generators
who had also contributed to it, threw petrol on a smouldering fire of
resentment.
It was clear that the Regulator had been persuaded by NIE to alter some of his
conclusions and ignore other essential features such as the recent
re-establishment of an electricity interconnector linking Ulster and the
Republic and had come to accept their argument that the nebulous and uncosted
long-term ``strategic benefits'' of interconnection to Scotland could outweigh
the additional #100m (after grant) bill that the Ulster electricity consumers
would have to pay.
The Regulator's Gilbertian decision caused dismay, but prompted the objectors
to turn their attention to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who had been
persuaded to launch a full-scale inquiry into the interconnector and
electricity prices in the Province. Evidence was gathered over six weeks of
hearings in London and Belfast, in the early summer.
Their recently published report criticised the project and stated ``there are
many unanswered questions about whether the Scottish interconnector is the best
or cheapest option for providing Northern Ireland's future generating needs and
the extent to which advantage could be made of the link with the rest of the
UK''.
In parallel with their submissions to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee,
STOP and NIAG campaigners presented detailed reports to the European Commission
where senior officials and commissioners within the Regional Affairs,
Environment, Competition, and Energy Directorates received personal briefings.
The Commission responded by tabling a composite report supporting the
allocation of the #61m ERDF grant awarded to the interconnector and rejecting
the objectors' case at a meeting of the Petitions Committee in Brussels in
November. However, MEPs led by Alex Smith rejected the report and called for
rapporteurs to draw up detailed dossiers on the issue in the Budgetary Control,
Energy and Environment Committees. Reacting to this breakthrough, STOP
campaigners were in Brussels again just before Christmas, urging MEPs to demand
that the #61m grant be withdrawn.
STOP and NIAG campaigners have now called for a third public inquiry into the
undersea section of the project.They point to the fact that recent MoD
revelations over 1.7m tonnes of munitions and toxic chemicals were dumped in
the Beaufort's Dyke area of the North Channel since the end of the Second World
War, have given rise to huge public concern.
The objectors state that the two previous public inquiries were only able to
deal with planning matters affecting East Antrim and South Ayrshire and had no
legal jurisdiction over the undersea section. Letters have been written to
Michael Forsyth and to all affected maritime councils seeking their support for
this initiative.
It has been a long and demanding campaign, but despite confronting the combined
might of two of the wealthiest companies in Scotland and Ireland, the
objectors, with only a fraction of the resources at their disposal and fighting
to protect their environment and their jobs, have managed to outmanoeuvre the
utility giants again and again.
The outcome of the two public inquiries is not expected until the spring of
1996 although the final decision will ultimately rest with the Northern Ireland
Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew and his counterpart in Scotland, Michael Forsyth.
The thousands of people who have given their time, money, and expertise to help
STOP and NIAG are hoping for a victory of common sense over commercial greed.

THE first report from a five-month inquiry into a proposed electricity
interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland will be published today.
The document, running to hundreds of pages outlining the facts and evidence of
the inquiry at Ayr which finished in March, will be sent by the Scottish Office
to all interested parties for their consideration.
They will be given six weeks to send their responses to Mr James McCulloch, the
Reporter who conducted the inquiry.
The parties include ScottishPower and Northern Ireland Electricity, which want
to build the interconnector, and Stop the Overhead Powerlines (Stop) campaign,
which opposes it.
All recipients of the report have been asked not to discuss its contents
publicly. The Scottish Office has emphasised that this is only the factual part
of the report and that it contains ``no recommendations, suggestions or even
hints'' on the final outcome of the reporter's deliberations.
After the six-week consultation period, during which all sides are being asked
to concentrate purely on matters of fact or evidence, Mr McCulloch will again
consider the matter before concluding his report to Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth and recommending whether the project should proceed.
ScottishPower and NIE want to build the interconnector, expected to cost in
excess of #200m, on 203 pylons across 45 miles of Ayrshire countryside and
under the North Channel to the Antrim coast.
They argue that it will assist the economies of both areas as well as making
lots of money for their shareholders.
It is the undersea section on which objectors have been concentrating their
efforts recently, and both Stop co-ordinator Struan Stevenson and local MP
George Foulkes say that the inquiry has been overtaken by events surrounding
munitions dumping.
Mr Foulkes said: ``I will read the initial report with interest but I am
continuing my efforts to have the whole project put on ice until a proper
inquiry into the effects of the undersea cabling has been conducted.
``I am not talking about a piecemeal effort aimed at appeasing the local people
but an inquiry on the scale of the land-based inquiries in Scotland and
Northern Ireland into the electricity interconnector.
``What we have learned in recent weeks about munitions dumping in the North
Channel, and what we fear and suspect about the scale of dumping, makes it
imperative that a proper look is taken at the project before any work is
carried out.
``The possible effects not only of the excavation work but also of a
high-voltage cable running through this potentially volatile area are
terrifying.''
Mr Stevenson said: ``We have written to all the local authorities who face a
coastline threat asking for their support to have the interconnector work
postponed or better still cancelled because of the threat from munitions.
``As far as the report is concerned I cannot comment on it at this stage but
what I can say is that with the possible commissioning date by ScottishPower
now put back five years to 1999 we have already cost them around #100m which
they had not budgeted for.
``We remain optimistic that common sense will prevail and this ludicrous scheme
will be consigned to the dustbin of history.''
A spokesman for ScottishPower said that he was not in a position to comment
until the report was in the hands of the company.

IN his latest essay (December 23), Professor Steve Bruce returns to dance on
the grave of Christianity and delight in informing us that only 14% of Scottish
adults now attend Sunday services regularly.
It is only to be expected, I suppose, that a sociologist should lay emphasis on
statistics but what has that to do with objective truth? The two are
incommensurate. Truth remains truth despite numbers.
Apparently he advocates democratic truth only, a short step towards
totalitarianism. For as Stalin had it, ``It doesn't matter who votes for whom,
what matters is who counts the votes''.
To put the beliefs of Christians on the same footing as that in the ``tooth
fairy'' and ``Santa Claus'' is a crass misrepresentation of history and
indicative of a primary lack of proportion normally associated with fanatics,
not illuminati. And his reiteration of a swipe at Genesis in the passing
implies a fundamentalist interpretation that he is welcome to; but his attempt
to foist it on others is patronising.
While it is true that the Church has recently been in decline so too have its
critics, if Professor Bruce is anything to go by. Oh for the refreshing blast
from the pen of a Swinburne, Bradlaugh, or Nietzsche, real atheists to a man,
rather than what passes for an erudite essay on the subject today.
Appropriately enough we are informed throughout of the case for the defence of
Scrooge, for rarely have the words ``Bah! Humbug!'' so succinctly summed up an
article.
The Church need not fear the clarion call of such a herald for if he is in a
quandary as to what to tell his own children he is most unlikely to shake the
earth.

FOREIGN Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said yesterday that the Princess of Wales's
wish to become a roving ambassador would have to be considered.
However, he stressed that the Queen's wishes on the issue would be paramount.
He also appeared to underline the Foreign Office's concerns about the princess
being given any formal ambassadorial position.
On Radio 4's Today programme Mr Rifkind said: ``Ambassador has a technical
meaning and a more general meaning, sometimes used of someone who helps advance
the interests of the country they belong to.
``These are issues which will be considered quite properly, taking into account
the wishes of Her Majesty the Queen. That is the single most important
consideration.''
Mr Rifkind is the first member of the Government to speak publicly about a
possible new role for the princess since she revealed her wish, in her Panorama
interiew, to be a goodwill ambassador.
Mr Major is reported to have played a crucial role in behind the scenes
negotiations between the palace and the princess.
Mr Rifkind stressed the extreme sensitivity of the negotiations saying:``I
think we are at a very delicate moment with regard to the princess's future.''

JOHN R Holliday asks ``what happened to the legal right to roam'' when quoting
a Scottish local authority official who appeared to suggest that landowners
could compel walkers to leave their land (December 19).
Lord Sands provided the answer in 1928: ``When the presence of persons where
they have no legal right to be is expressly permitted, or permitted by
implication from tolerance, there is no trespass.''
In the same year Lord President Clyde observed: ``The word `trespasser' is apt,
in Scotland, to be a question-begging term . . . It means with us nothing more
than a person who intrudes on the land of another without that other's
permission, and it does not involve or imply the commission of any legal
offence. It is in short a popular term and not a legal one.''
From statements like these many legal experts, police officers, and
well-informed walkers have concluded that, while a landowner is perfectly
entitled to ask someone to leave their land, they cannot apply any force or
coercion if the person is simply crossing the land on a peaceful walk and
causing no damage to the landowner's interests. Otherwise the landowner is open
to a criminal charge of assault.
Nevertheless, there are many other statements, sometimes from official
organisations, or from those representing landowning interests, which suggest
that strong-arm tactics can be used to remove walkers from land. No wonder the
public is confused.
Every politician with a stake in democracy should recognise that the right to
roam is as important as the right to free speech. A commitment to legislate for
freedom to roam should be in the election manifestos of every political party
in Scotland.
Such legislation is essential if we are to continue to enjoy, with confidence,
our cultural and natural heritage whether it be on public or privately owned
land.

<TEXT>
THE Government has paid #40,000 in legal costs to the relatives of three IRA
members shot by the SAS in Gibraltar.
The money was paid to comply with a decision by the European Court of Human
Rights in September to award costs to the families of Mairead Farrell, Sean
Savage and Daniel McCann.
``All we are doing is complying with the court's condition that we pay legal
costs,'' a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said. ``There is no question
of compensation at all.''
The payment was reported to have been made on Christmas Eve, just days from the
expiry of a three-month deadline set by the court, which had ruled that the
so-called ``Death on the Rock'' killings breached Article 2 of the Convention
of Human Rights.
The Government, which had at the time expressed ``deep dissatisfaction'' with
the judgment which it said ``defied common sense'' was keen to deny there had
been any climbdown.
``It's a legal matter in which we had no control,'' a Foreign Office spokesman
said. ``The Government is not in the position of breaking the law.''
At the time, Mr Michael Heseltine said the Government would consider
withdrawing Britain's recognition of the Convention in protest.
He was not available for comment last night, but the Cabinet Office insisted he
had never suggested the costs should not be paid.

GLASGOW Development Agency looks set to create an ambitious ``one-stop shop''
to service Scotland's burgeoning film industry.
It has earmarked a three-storey building in the Broomielaw which it intends to
transform into an office block to house the Scottish Film Council, the Scottish
Film Production Fund, and Bafta Scotland.
The move is seen as crucial if Glasgow is to retain its position as the
administrative centre - and natural home - of the country's film and TV
industries. The city already has Scotland's two biggest television stations,
BBC Scotland and Scottish Television, and the majority of the country's
independent film companies.
However, for some years there has been concern about the state of the Scottish
Film Council's premises. Together with the SFPF and the Scottish Film Archive,
it is housed in the ageing former Notre Dame School in Victoria Crescent Road
in Glasgow's West End. The accommodation, essentially classrooms which have
been converted into offices, is cramped and unattractive.
With more and more film-makers coming to Glasgow, the GDA has been aware that
this image does not reflect the dynamic, forward-looking industrial sector it
is supposed to be. So it has been looking around for a suitable alternative.
Having earmarked the Broomielaw site, it has now started a tendering process
for the conversion work. However, the project has still to be given the final
go-ahead by the Scottish Office. Given the Scottish Secretary's interest in the
expansion of the movie business, this is not likely to be a problem.
Senior officials at the GDA stressed that the new building would be a purely
administrative centre. The project did not preclude possible future plans for a
bigger and better centre which could house production facilities and a museum
and archive.
The only key film organisation which will not be housed in the new Glasgow
building is Scottish Screen Locations which will continue to be based in
Edinburgh.

AS a former chairman of the Council of the John Buchan Society I must protest
against Jimmy Reid's association of John Buchan with anti-Semitism (December
23).
Far from being anti-Semitic, John Buchan was a friend of Chaim Weizmann and
``was regarded by British Zionists as one of their most useful allies'' (Janet
Adam Smith, John Buchan, p317).
Andrew Lownie's new book on Buchan quotes a letter to Walter Buchan condemning
Archibald Maule Ramsay's spreading of anti-Semitic propaganda in 1938: ``It is
abominable, at a time when the wretched Jews are suffering almost the cruellest
persecution in history, that Englishmen should give currency to these silly
libels, which are all invented in Germany'' (p271).
Some of Buchan's characters do express the suspicion of Jews that was current
in the first half of this century; some other characters are respected Jews;
and in The Thirty-Nine Steps Scudder's anti-Semitism is adversely commented on
by Sir Walter Bullivant thus: ``He had a lot of odd biases, too. Jews, for
example, made him see red. Jews and the high finance.''

INTERNATIONAL relief workers said today they were struggling to feed and
shelter tens of thousands of refugees on Bosnian Serb-held territory as winter
deepens.
Serb authorities in the western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic are
overwhelmed by 280,000 refugees, of which 180,000 were displaced this year. Aid
workers described the north-west region around Banja Luka as ``one big refugee
camp''.
Unlike earlier stages in the Bosnian conflict, the humanitarian crisis appears
to be worse on the Serb side because of the recent influx of refugees.
``It's the most precarious time in this part of Bosnia since the war started,''
an official with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said. ``It's similar to
the situation on the Government side in the winter of 1993.''
The International Committee of the Red Cross, responding to the deteriorating
situation, plans to set up some 20 soup kitchens serving one hot meal a day for
the most vulnerable people in the Banja Luka area.
The most pressing problem for refugees is lack of shelter amid snow and
freezing temperatures, relief workers said.
The Red Cross is handing out stoves, blankets, and mattresses to the refugees,
some of whom are sleeping in schools and army barracks.
Some of the refugees are moving into gutted houses once inhabited by Muslims
and Croats expelled earlier in the war.
Slobodan Ecimovic, Bosnian Serb deputy commissioner for refugees, said they
lacked the resources to construct housing for the displaced population.
``The conditions for refugees are difficult and could get worse,'' he said.
``There are plans to resettle them but the question is how?''
The number of refugees is expected to rise over the next months as some 17,000
Serbs in the Posavina corridor in northern Bosnia flee before the region is
handed over to the Muslim-Croat federation.
UN relief workers also fear an exodus of thousands of Serbs around Sarajevo
before their suburbs revert to Muslim-led government control.
The Serbs' international isolation has meant that far fewer international aid
agencies operate on Serb territory than on the Government side, relief workers
said.
Until October, only three major aid agencies - the UNHCR, ICRC, and the French
medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres - were working on Serb territory. More
than 100 aid groups are registered on Government-held ground.
One relief worker said: ``The Serbs have been treated as the `bad guys', and
aid agencies found it much easier to raise funds for projects on the Government
side.
``It is sometimes difficult to find support from donors for projects on
Serb-controlled territory.''
Relief workers hope a Nato-led force policing the peace accord will open up
routes through front lines next month, clearing the way for convoys coming from
UNHCR warehouses in neighbouring Croatia.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Shetland faces Arctic blizzards as snow storms and freezing temperatures tighten grip on North Island state of emergency</HEADLINE>

By DAVID ROSS, Highland Correspondent, and GRAEME SMITH
SHETLAND Islands Council last night declared a state of emergency as
helicopters were drafted in to airlift aid to people in remote areas of
Scotland. They are facing a fourth day without power as a result of the severe
snow storms which have gripped the North.
There are fears of worse to come. Two more ``polar low'' depressions are
expected to sweep down from the Arctic later in the week, bringing Shetland
renewed blizzards.
Temperatures throughout Scotland are also feared to fall even lower before the
week is out. In Glasgow yesterday they hit -16C, the coldest place in Scotland
along with Aviemore, with worse to come. Edinburgh suffered a recorded low of
-6C.
Scottish Office officials have been in touch with the Shetland council offering
help.
Last night a Scottish Office spokesman said: ``We have been told that the
council is coping with the situation with their own resources. But we are ready
to give any assistance the council may think is necessary and are monitoring
the situation.''
The chief executive of Shetland Islands Council, Mr Malcolm Green, said an
emergency committee was now in operation and supervising the delivery of
services to the islanders who were ``pulling together'' making sure that
everybody was safe.
The council has set up a telephone network to pass information to islanders via
their community councils. Local numbers for people to call were broadcast on
BBC Radio Shetland, which went back on the air last night with a special snow
emergency programme.
Mr Green appealed for volunteers with four-wheel drive vehicles and tractors to
register with the council. The plan is to use them to deliver emergency
supplies of food and bottled gas to houses still completely cut off, with
isolated old people the priority.
He said the council, police, and coastguards were co-operating closely. The
council's emergency team will meet this morning for the first time since the
Braer tanker wreck almost three years ago.
Hydro-Electric linesmen have been battling since Sunday to restore power to
homes cut off as snow, ice, and heavy winds have brought down electricity lines
but they have been unable to reach many of the most isolated victims.
By last night the company, whose linesmen have been working against the
elements throughout Christmas, had managed to restore supplies to almost 19,000
homes leaving only 1500 in Shetland, the Western Isles, and a handful on the
mainland without power.
Because they live in remote areas most are prepared for periods without power
but a Hydro-Electric spokeswoman said: ``Our concern is that the gas and
paraffin which many of them use as alternative fuel will be running out.
``We have taken three extra helicopters to Shetland and four to the Western
Isles and we have offered them to the local authorities to get supplies to
those who require them or to airlift to safety those who are most vulnerable.
``We have also flown in extra helicopter pilots to Shetland to ensure there are
enough to keep the helicopters in operation.''
She said they were ``very disappointed'' that they had not been able to make
more progress yesterday. The weather had delayed the arrival of some of the
helicopters and workmen until mid-afternoon, curtailing the amount they were
able to do.
A local contractor on the island had been persuaded to dig a route in for
Hydro-Electric workers to repair the Tumlin sub station which was brought back
into operation last night, restoring power to 1100 of the 1426 Shetland homes
blacked out.
A further 770 consumers were affected in the Western Isles and emergency
generators have been taken to Uig in case power cannot be restored today.
The main problem area on the mainland is around Strichen and New Deer in
Aberdeenshire. About 170 people in Strichen have had no power since Christmas
Eve. In total around 500 Hydro-Electric workers have been mobilised over
Christmas including 100 contractors' staff called in to help.
``We are dealing with 20ft snow drifts and it is impossible to say when
everyone will have their power restored. We are working flat out,'' said the
spokeswoman.
Power cables had to be placed above ground, leaving themContinued from Page 1
vulnerable, because it would cost 10 times as much to place them below ground
and if there were faults it would take days to find them.
``It just takes one of these lines to go out. I think those who live in remote
locations know that you have to accept the risk at this time of the year. It's
not like living in a city where you can switch electricity from four
directions,'' the spokeswoman said.
Main routes in Grampian were open yesteday but police were warning motorists
only to make ``absolutely essential'' journeys.
A police spokesman said: ``If you have to make a journey it is best to check
the conditions before departing and make sure your vehicle is in perfect
condition.''
He said that although the main roads were passable many side roads were blocked
by falling and drifting snow.
He praised the teams of Grampian roadworkers who had struggled round the clock
over the festive season to keep the arterial routes clear.
Meanwhile, Shetland council offices are to close down for the next three days
except for those staff dealing with the emergency.
Most inter-island ferry services have beeen cancelled because connecting roads
are closed to general traffic and crews have been having great difficulty
getting to their boats.
Sumburgh Airport remained closed all day and is unlikely to reopen before noon
today. British Airways told passengers some flights would be cancelled and
asked intending travellers to check before leaving for the airport, where
access roads are described as ``extremely difficult''.
All but essential staff at BP's Sullom Voe oil terminal were told to stay at
home. The oil port resumed shipments late on Christmas Day when the wind
dropped below gale force but managers reported ``significant difficulties''.
The Crofters Union secretary, Mr Drew Ratter, said farmers and crofters were
becoming concerned about sheep flocks stranded where they could not be fed.
Shetland Coastguard's rescue helicopter made two more air ambulance trips
yesterday to take seriously ill patients to hospital in Lerwick from remote
rural communities.
The fishing boat Antares sailed 14 miles from the island of Whalsay to Lerwick
with a pregnant woman late yesterday afternoon. An ambulance met the boat at
Victoria Pier, Lerwick, and took her to the maternity unit of the Gilbert Bain
Hospital.
The Laerling, which normally runs summer sightseeing cruises, made a 50 mile
round voyage from Lerwick to Sumburgh to collect more than 20 airline
passengers who had been stranded at Sumburgh Hotel since landing at Sumburgh
Airport late on Christmas Eve.
One family escaped from a snowbound house on the island of Bressay by boat,
heading for Tenerife. Frank and Caroline Miller and their Christmas family
party had spent two days without power. They crossed Bressay Sound to Lerwick
in a neighbour's workboat to make sure they were in time for tonight's P &amp; O
ferry to Aberdeen.
In Kinlochbervie and Durness in north-west Sutherland, local people reported
that half the houses had been cut off.
The snow has not turned out to be the delight for skiers which many hoped.
Those who were able to reach the ski slopes found that only a few runs were in
operation.
At Glencoe the lifts remained closed because severe winds had blown much of the
snow off the runs and at Aonach Mor there were limited facilities. The Lecht
and Glenshee Ski Centres both opened after being stormbound on Christmas Day.
Cairngorm has had five chairlifts and tows open since the Monday although the
number of Christmas Day skiers was kept down as the access road was blocked by
drifting snow until midday.
AA Roadwatch last night issued the following warning: SHETLAND: All roads
closed. GRAMPIAN: A96 shut at Keith; A947 south of Turriff; A93 Aboyne-Braemar
closed; A939 Tomintoul-Granton-on-Spey passable with extreme care; A90
Aberdeen-Dundee passable with care. TAYSIDE: A90 Aberdeen-Forfar passable with
care, but down to one lane northbound; A92 Montrose-Stonehaven very icy, police
advise using A90. CENTRAL: A821 Callander-Aberfoyle closed at Dukes Pass.
BORDERS: A1 and A697 treacherous. STRATHCLYDE: A83 icy at Rest-and-be-Thankful;
Shields Road, Motherwell, ice caused by burst pipe.

Patrick Brogan reports on how Congress moves to expose dirty secrets
THE sleaze that has been flowing through the House of Commons in an
ever-increasing flood has been yet richer and deeper in Washington. Now
Congress, like Parliament, is making a first effort to clean itself up.
Not too much, though. Lobbyists are to be brought out into the open, their
dirty little secrets are to be published to the world, but the greater
corruption, the payment of huge sums of money to members of both Houses of
Congress for their electoral purposes, will continue unchecked.
House and Senate have both amended the rules governing gifts to members. They
will no longer be able to charge their vacations to lobbyists, so-called
``charity'' golf and ski trips will now be out-of-bounds if someone else is
paying, and members will not be able to accept gifts costing more than $50, or
allow lobbyists to spend more than that on a meal or drinks for legislators.
The same limitations apply to congressional staffs, which will suddenly make
their jobs much less attractive. It should also make the legislative process
slightly less corrupt: while it may not often have been possible to buy a
Congressman's or a Senator's vote with a ski trip or a good lunch, lobbyists
certainly found it possible to influence the opinions of obscure and unknown
members of their staffs with a campaign of small favours.
A much more important change finally made it through the House of
Representatives on November 29. The House then passed a Bill that had already
passed the Senate, which will oblige all lobbyists to declare themselves and
their operations. President Clinton will sign it and from next January, a new
light should start to shine in the dark places of Washington.
Current law provides that lobbyists need declare only their approaches to
members of Congress. The new law covers everyone who seeks to influence
Congressional staff, policy-making officials of the executive branch, including
the President himself and members of the Cabinet and all the other agencies of
government.
Lobbyists would have to register themselves with Congress within 45 days of
being hired or making their first contact with an official.
Lobbyists will have to file reports to Congress every six months, and here's
the juicy bit. They have to disclose what legislation or matters of policy they
were trying to influence, and how much they spend on each subject.
They have to list which Houses of Congress and which agency of the government
they approached, but they do not have to list the names of the individuals.
The passage of the Bill was a victory for reform Democrats and Republicans, and
was possible solely because of the zeal of new Republican Congressmen who came
to Washington a year ago, promising to reform Congress. Their efforts were
opposed by Republican leaders in both houses, who were quite happy to accept
lobbyists' help.
Newt Gingrich, for instance, invited lobbyists into his office immediately
after he moved in as Speaker last January, to help draft Bills.
He objected to anything which might interfere with this cosy relationship,
sending his deputies out to vote for various killer amendments. All were
defeated, however, and in the end, faced with the stark choice of voting for
reform, or opposing it, the Bill passed unanimously.
In some ways, Washington is already cleaner than London: unlike Members of
Parliament, Members of Congress are forbidden to accept salaries from lobbying
organisations.
But the sleaze factor has not been eliminated. It is still possible to buy
Congressmen. Indeed, the influence of crude money is likely to be increased.
Lobbyists will now hesitate to spend huge amounts of time and effort presenting
their cases to Congressmen or their staffs, or to government agencies, for fear
that their opponents will give great publicity to their activities. Instead,
they will simply send money to the Political Action Committees (PACs) that
finance members' election campaigns.
The connection between money, elections and policy is far more direct and
corrupt here than in London. There are no limits on what members can spend on
their election campaigns, and the limits on how they can raise the money are
easily circumvented.
Indeed, the rule that no individual can give more than $1000 to a Congressional
candidate's campaign helps the PACs, which pour their money into different
coffers - which perform the same service. There is no restriction of ``soft
money'' contributions, by which a PAC may finance a series of TV commercials
supporting their favoured candidates.

SUPERMAN star Christopher Reeve, who was paralysed after a riding accident in
May, is to be the patron of a charity wheelchair push from Land's End to John
O'Groats.
Reeve, 42, is hoping to travel from the US for the Push 2000 event, which will
involve three men travelling 2000 miles in racing wheelchairs over two months.
His visit will mark the tenth anniversary of the Great British Push which
raised #400,000 over a similar route for the International Spinal Research
Trust.
Paraplegic Simon Barnes, 32, and two friends will set out from Land's End on
May 13, visiting spinal units at several hospitals on route.
Reeve, who is wheelchair-bound and depends on a ventilator to breathe, has
expressed an ambition to be on his feet again within 10 years.
He met Mr Bengie Walden, ISRT's director, and Mr Barnes at the Kessler
Institute in New Jersey, where he was a patient.
``We are hoping Push 2000 will raise #500,000 towards the #6m we need for our
research programme,'' said Mr Walden.
``Mr Reeve has an incredibly strong spirit,'' said Mr Barnes. ``If anyone is
going to help end the permanence of paralysis, Christopher Reeve is the man.''
The charity recently funded the work of a Swedish orthopaedic surgeon, Thomas
Carlstedt, who operated on a patient suffering from spinal-cord injury to give
him back the use of a paralysed arm.

ALL adult dependants of public-sector workers deserve pension entitlements,
regardless of their marital status, the Trades Union Congress said yesterday in
calling for changes to the existing law.
In a report entitled Pensions and Prejudice, the TUC says almost 220,000
families are disadvantaged by the present pension scheme.
Of the three million public-sector workers paying into pension schemes, nearly
220,000 are unmarried partners, many with children, who stand to face financial
hardship when their partner dies.
The TUC report also identifies discrimination against lesbians, homosexuals,
and people who live with parents or other relatives.
General secretary John Monks said yesterday: ``The social taboos of living
together no longer apply and the pension schemes are out of touch with social
realities. Unless the schemes change their ways people will not join them,
which is not good for our members or for the future of the schemes.''
Some schemes, including the Royal Devonport Dockyard Scheme, have already
adapted to take account of these developments. That scheme stipulates that in
the event of death ``a pension shall be paid to an adult dependant of the
member of one half of the amount of pension that would have been payable to the
member''.
The TUC wants all public-sector pension schemes - namely those covering local
government and NHS staff, civil servants, police, and firefighters - to follow
suit, but the Government refuses to act on moral, cost, and logistical grounds,
all of which the TUC rebuts.

TURKEY'S often fractious secularist politicians closed ranks today in a bid to
prevent the Islamist Welfare Party (RP) from coming to power after it narrowly
won general elections at the weekend.
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and rival conservative leader Mesut Yilmaz agreed
to work for a coalition supported by left-wing MPs to block the RP.
``I have said we would welcome a coalition with (the Motherland Party) Anap and
I repeat that,'' Ciller said. ``Our aim is to go towards a wide-based
government,'' she told a joint news conference after meeting Yilmaz, the Anap
leader.
Shares on Istanbul's stock exchange surged by an average 5.3% on the news that
Ciller and Yilmaz were meeting.
The anti-Western Islamists won just over 21% of Sunday's votes but do not have
enough seats to govern alone. Anap and Ciller's right-wing True Path Party
(DYP) were close behind with almost 40% of the vote between them.
Welfare's victory was the first at general polls by an Islamist party in 99%
Muslim but secular Turkey's 72 years as a modern republic.
The party has ridden a wave of discontent at Ciller's tough economic austerity
plan and bickering among the mainstream parties.
Turkey's business community and media have long called for a conservative
coalition to deal with economic ills like 80% annual inflation and a stumbling
privatisation plan.
Yilmaz said he hoped an alliance could be forged in the coming days.
Right-wing unity has failed in the past because of intense personal rivalry
between Ciller and Yilmaz. An attempt to ally their two parties in September
ended when Yilmaz stormed out of a meeting with the prime minister, accusing
her of disrespect.
Veteran Welfare leader Necmettin Erbakan, a fiery public speaker, toned down
his anti-establishment rhetoric today.
``We can form a coalition government with any of the other parties,'' he told a
news conference. ``Coalition means compromise.''
Ciller and Yilmaz have vowed not to go into government with Welfare. Erbakan
also said he had no desire to change Turkey's strict secularist constitution
and wanted to concentrate on solving inlfation, unemployment and the Kurdish
issue.
``Our nation is waiting for service. There is a need for co-operation and being
constructive,'' he said.
Erbakan said he hoped President Suleyman Demirel would give him the task of
forming a coalition, in line with Turkish political tradition under which the
biggest party in a split parliament gets the first bite at forming a governing
alliance.
The secularist bid to block Erbakan also has the support of the left-wing
Democratic Left Party (DSP) and Ciller's former social democrat coalition
partners.
But it was unclear if the left would join a coalition or support it against the
Islamists from the opposition benches.
The DSP's staunch secularist leader Bulent Ecevit said he would back a strong
government. ``We evaluated how such a government could be formed and how we
could contribute to it,'' he said after meeting Yilmaz.
Former prime minister Ecevit, a 1970s-style leftist, has frequently criticised
US-educated Ciller for her privatisation drive and free-marketeering.
Ciller called early elections after her coalition with the social democrats
collapsed in September and she lost a vote of confidence in the minority
government that replaced it.
She resigned as prime minister after her defeat on Sunday but Demirel asked her
to stay on in a caretaker role under a new government is set up.-Reuter.

FIFTEEN people were killed in two separate attacks in South Africa's volatile
KwaZulu-Natal province today, police said.
Police spokesman Henry Budrum told Reuters that 10 people were killed during a
tribal dispute between two Zulu clans in the rural areas of the province called
Ngoba before dawn.
He said five other people, three children and two adults, were shot and burnt
to death at Inkonka settlements.
``We are not certain if this attack was politically linked, but we are
investigating that possibility,'' he said.
Budrum said the pre-dawn clash between the Hlongwane and Khumalo clans was not
politically motivated.
``That area has a history of faction fighting and this recent clash is linked
to an old tribal dispute and not to politics,'' he said.
KwaZulu-Natal is a scene of bitter internecine fighting between President
Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress and Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party.
The province also has a history of faction fighting where rival clans fight for
anything from grazing space to boreholes.
There has been an upsurge in violence between ANC and IFP supporters this month
although political fighting between followers of Mandela and Buthelezi has
eased since all-race elections in April last year.
Thirty-six people have been killed in three separate attacks on IFP and ANC
supporters in KwaZulu-Natal this month, including 16 massacred on Christmas Day
in Shobashobane district outside Port Shepstone, 90 miles south of the port
city of Durban.
The ANC and Inkatha today blamed each other for the upsurge in bloodletting.
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki visited looted, deserted huts in Shobashobane
villages today.
Mbeki, along with Defence Minister Joe Modise and Safety and Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi, did not speak to reporters when they arrived to inspect the
charred belongings and looted houses of ANC supporters at Shobashobane.
ANC's KwaZulu-Natal provincial spokesman Dumisani Makhaye blamed Inkatha for
the latest massacre.
``This is part of the programme of the Inkatha to wipe out the ANC from the
province,'' Makhaye said.
But Inkatha spokesman Phillip Powell denied Makhaye's allegations, saying it
was in fact Inkatha members who had been ``subjected to a wave of killing in
the past three months''.
``Instead of engaging in rhetoric, there should be serious attempts to resolve
the problem in that area,'' Powell said.-Reuter.

A VANDAL head-butted a bakery window with such force his false teeth flew out
his mouth and landed in the shop.
Braes Bakery owner Scott Robertson was left gnashing his own teeth when he
turned up for work in Grangemouth yesterday morning to find his shop window
shattered.
However, he was left with a smile on his face and one in his hand when he
picked up the vandal's dentures he had found lying on the shop floor.
Mr Robertson, 35, does not think police will have too much of a problem
matching the false teeth with the suspect.
He said: ``When I saw the broken window I was furious because it will cost me a
fair amount of money to get it fixed.
``But when I realised whoever had smashed the window had left their teeth, I
just burst out laughing.
``I had heard the saying `An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth' but this
really takes the biscuit.
``If he comes back into the shop he won't be too hard to spot.
``Once he has paid for my window I will give him back the teeth.''

UP to six Zairean soldiers and an unknown number of civilians died in Christmas
Day violence in Zaire's refugee town of Goma after attackers killed a colonel,
triggering a rampage by troops, witnesses and aid workers said.
The identity of those behind yesterday's grenade attack, which sparked clashes
and looting away from the town centre, was not immediately clear and it was
unclear whether any of the hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees in the
area were involved.
Regional governor Moto Mpenda told Reuters by telephone today that calm had
return to the town.
Details of what happened were sketchy. Aid workers spoke of clashes among
soldiers with civilians caught up in the unrest.
A journalist of the Zaire Press Agency told Reuters by telephone yesterday that
the dead lieutenant colonel was second in command of operations in the area.
The attacker died in the blast from his own grenade and two men with him were
caught and killed by bystanders, he said.
Aid workers said soldiers had then gone on the rampage.
Goma was the focus of the exodus of over a million Rwandan Hutus after the
Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front exiles defeated the Hutu army and took
power after last year's massacre of up to one million Rwandans, most of them
Tutsis.
The Kinshasa government, under pressure from Zaire's President Mobutu Sese
Seko, has dropped plans to expel the refugees by the end of the year. It had
earlier suspended forced repatriations under pressure from the outside
world.-Reuter.

AN 83-year-old woman was last night unconscious and critically ill in hospital
after being found in the street after a vicious attack.
Mrs Evelyn Stanford, 83, was discovered lying on the pavement about a half a
mile from her home in Wrekin Drive, Wolverhampton, early yesterday.
Detective Inspector Philip Thompson said: ``We are very concerned for her.
``We don't know what she was doing out at that time of night.
``She was seen by a witness minutes before she was attacked. When he returned
she was lying on the ground being tended by a passer-by.''
The witness had noted she was carrying a bag but it had gone when she was found
lying on the pavement on Goldthorn Hill just after midnight.
Detective Inspector Thompson said: ``She had spent part of Christmas Day with
her family but we don't know if she then visited someone else.
``We need to know her movements before she was attacked.''
She has been unconscious at the Royal Hospital in Wolverhampton with serious
head injuries since the attack.

Three clowns were among more than 500 people who plunged into the North Sea at
Sunderland yesterday for the 20th Boxing Day charity swim, which raised

<TEXT>
FOREIGN Secretary Malcolm Rifkind yesterday attempted to allay the fears of
Tory Euro-sceptics on a single European currency, but played down the prospects
of a referendum.
He said Britain would have to be convinced there would be ``very substantial
benefits'' before signing up to a single currency.
Some MPs were alarmed by the pace of moves towards monetary union agreed by EU
heads of government at the Madrid summit earlier this month.
Mr Rifkind stressed that Britain was unconvinced by the political arguments.
``Joining a single currency would be a historic decision. It would be an
irreversible decision. It would involve the transfer of significant control
over economic decision making to the European level,'' he told BBC Radio 4's
Today. ``To justify that one would have to be satisfied there would be very
substantial benefits to the British economy.''
On the issue of a referendum being included in the Tory election manifesto, he
said: ``In theory it could but it doesn't have to. In the past when there have
been referenda over our membership of the EC or devolution those were issues
that were decided at the time.''

SENIOR Labour Party sources yesterday dismissed reports that Tony Blair was
planning a new commission to examine key aspects of devolution.
It has been claimed that the Labour leader wants a ``high-powered internal
review'' of the impact of devolution on English politics.
It was also that claimed the review commission would re-examine the so-called
West Lothian question, which centres on the right of Scottish MPs to vote on
issues affecting England and Wales after devolution.
Last night, however, the Labour hierarchy was adamant that there was no
substance to the newspaper reports.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said: ``There is nothing in
it as far as we are concerned. There is ongoing preparation for fulfilment of
our pledge, but there is no commission set up, or being set up.''
It was claimed that the alleged review might examine the consequences of
reducing the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster from the present 72 to
perhaps 58.
Some Scottish Labour MPs have privately acknowledged that there could be
pressure for this after the first term of a Labour government, when the
Scottish parliament would have been up and running for some years.
However, Mr Robertson made it clear that any such change would be well into the
future that the party's policy was the retention of all 72 MPs.
A senior spokesman for Mr Blair's office said the commitment to legislation in
the first year was ``absolute'' and he added: ``The idea that ongoing
discussions represent a new commission of inquiry is absurd. There are
discussions all the time, but there is no new commission.''
The Tories are preparing to make Labour's devolution plans a centrepiece of
their campaign in the next General Election.
The Prime Minister believes his stance on the issue was a vote-winner last time
and can be again.
A particular target will be the so-called ``tartan tax'' which, the Tories
claim, will cost the average Scot an extra 3p in the pound.
Mr Major has said devolution would mean that the future status and number of
Scotland's MPs at Westminster would inevitably be diminished.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth went on the attack during a recent session
of the Scottish Select Committee. He strongly defended the spending deal he
achieved for Scotland and told English Tory MPs on the committee: ``There are
people who advocate the tartan tax because it may not be raised, or taxation
might be reduced.
``But I find the idea that you would continue to vote through 35% more funds
and then watch a Scottish parliament hand out tax rebates incredible. Those who
advocate change should recognise what they are opening up.''
Meanwhile, Hartlepool Labour MP Peter Mandelson is about to open a can of worms
by setting out of his own ``manifesto'' in a book to be published in the new
year.
According to reports over Christmas, it includes a coalition with the Liberal
Democrats, abolition of child benefit, no-strike deals in the public sector
and, following devolution, a reduction in the number of Scottish and Welsh MPs
at Westminster.
One angered left winger is quoted as saying: ``If he wants to have some
coalition with the Lib-Dems, I suggest he does us all a favour and joins them.''

A SENIOR police officer, heavily involved in the Strathclyde force's anti-drugs
initiative Operation Eagle, has called on churches to play a leading role in
tackling drug abuse.
Mr James Richardson, Deputy Chief Constable of Strathclyde, also took a strong
stand against legalising so-called ``soft'' drugs such as cannabis.
He said that on a visit to Amsterdam he walked into the city-centre and saw the
results of a liberal regime in relation to immorality, drug abuse, and crime.
``Let me tell you that there was nothing there I would want to bring to
Strathclyde,'' said Mr Richardson, an elder at St Machan's Parish Church at
Larkhall.
He said the police would never cure the drug problem because it was not their
role and he called on other agencies including the churches to work at reducing
demand and diverting people away from using drugs.
When asked what he made of the Church of Scotland's board of social
responsibility which is currently examining the issue of decriminalising
certain ``soft drugs'' such as cannabis, Mr Richardson said: ``Christians
cannot possibly have an option to suggest that dangerous drugs should be
decriminalised.
``There is no such thing as a `soft' drug. All drugs by their very nature are
mind-altering or mood-altering.
``As such they are a form of escapism, quite apart from the physical and
psychological harm that they bring.
``There is no question here. Can we honestly answer to our maker for condoning
a society where drug abuse is legalised?''
Mr Richardson's comments were made in an interview in January's edition of the
Church of Scotland magazine, Life and Work.
Mr Richardson said: ``We have a responsibility to the generations yet to come
to set standards which promote a healthy society.
``The evidence is ample to show that people progress from soft drugs to hard
drugs.
``Dealers are deliberately engaged in supplying substances which they know are
harmful, but there are tremendous profits to be made here so they encourage
young people to experiment.''
Mr Richardson said that people who took dangerous drugs were trying to change
their psychological state, often because of a lack of confidence in themselves,
peer-group pressures, or hopelessness, but the churches could show these people
their own value.
``The church can help drug users by nurturing skills and developing potential.
It should use diversion techniques to give drug users alternative options, and
it should have an uncompromising teaching element which values the Gospel and
which values people.
``Parish churches could have a huge role, and there is an amazing mission
potential in this field, but we must have the faith to make it happen.''
Asked what level of success he realistically expected against drug dealers, Mr
Richardson said he was an optimist and said he thought ``if we have the faith,
the will, the resilience, and the determination, we can win the battle''.
Last night Mrs Ann Allen, vice convener of the board of social responsibility,
said she believed the majority of people in the church would agree with his
comments.
The Rev Fergus Buchanan, convener of the Kirk's 16-strong study group into
whether certain illegal substances should be decriminalised, will head a
meeting early in the new year with a view to reporting to the General Assembly
in 1997.
One of the main topics of discussion will be whether cannabis should be
legalised, either as a recreational or a therapeutic drug.

HAIRDRESSERS and barbers have the highest mortality rates in Britain, followed
by men who work on boats.
Footballers who drive black cars are also more accident prone than average,
according to a report by a men's magazine, Maxim.
Football accounts for 440,000 injuries a year, and rugby 97,000.
Based on figures covering accidents, crimes, and injuries, the magazine found
that the living-room was the most accident-prone place in the home with some
257,000 reported mishaps there each year.
Black cars were more likely to crash than any other colour of car, with 5pm the
worst time for road accidents.
Oddly enough five people are injured by goats each year, while in the office
4000 people a year are hurt by stationery including four a year by paper clips.
Two people a year suffer damage from putty, four from shoe polish, six from
lollipop sticks, eight from toothpaste, and 10 from underwear.
At home 54,000 people suffer poisoning and 25,000 from ``over-exertion''.
A Maxim spokesman said: ``What exactly they were doing, the statistics don't
say.''

THE Hogmanay celebrations will be helped along with a double blast from the
past this year as Scotland's rival TV stations vie for viewers.
Gary Glitter will strut his stuff for BBC Scotland's Hogmanay Live show being
beamed around the country from the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle.
In the Grampian corner - which is being screened on Scottish - Eric Falconer's
Bay City Rollers will help bring in the New Year with a rendition of Flower of
Scotland and a medley of traditional Andy Stewart numbers.
If viewers have difficulty choosing between these two treats, spare a thought
for those south of the Border.
BBC1 viewers outside Scotland will only join in the traditional festivities 10
minutes into 1996, having to make do until then with Angus Deayton and his End
of Year Show.
But sassenachs holidaying in the north can tune into the Have I Got News For
You presenter's droll tones on BBC2 Scotland from 11pm until it too merges with
the Edinburgh Hogmanay show at 12.10am.
Former lottery presenter Gordon Kennedy will co-present BBC1's Scottish show
with Lorraine Kennedy, and as well as Gary Glitter, their guest list includes
Eddie Reader and Big Country.
A spokesman for BBC Scotland said last night: ``It promises to be a great night
and the whole country will be coming into our Edinburgh show just after the
bells.''
The Grampian programme, from Aberdeenshire's Haddo House, will only link-up
with regional stations in England and Wales for four minutes before and four
minutes after the bells.
They will see Art Sutter and Janice Forsyth present the live party from the
great hall of Lady Aberdeen's ancestral home which is now run by the National
Trust.
A spokesman for Grampian said Big Country would be playing in the run-up to the
bells with live music from folk singer Carol Laula.
``Haddo House's own bell will bring in the New Year, followed by fireworks and
then everybody at the party will go crazy,'' said the spokesman.
``It will be a wild ceilidh atmosphere after midnight, with dancing and some
great music.''
Meanwhile, the BBC appears to have beaten ITV in the battle of the Christmas
Day ratings.
According to BBC insiders, early viewing figures show that grumpy Victor
Meldrew has again topped the ratings charts with around 16.8 million people
tuning in for the episode of One Foot In The Grave.
The concluding half of a two-part EastEnders special was close behind with 16.1
million viewers and suburban snob Hyacinth Bucket attracted 16 million fans in
Keeping Up Appearances.
Despite the pre-Christmas hype and rivalry, ITV managed to boast only one
programme in the top 10, it is claimed.
Christmas in Coronation Street is in sixth place with 11.8 million viewers,
although these preliminary figures do not take into account video recordings or
repeats.
The first part of EastEnders attracted 14.3 million, and the Christmas Day film
Hook pulled in 12.1 million.
Overall, the BBC had 54% of total viewing figures, with ITV attracting just 25%
of audiences, according to the source.
Four times as many people watched the Queen deliver her Christmas message to
the nation on BBC1 as on ITV, making a total of 13.7 million viewers.
A BBC insider said yesterday: ``Despite ITV's best efforts the BBC has once
again grabbed the lion's share of audience figures, showing we are the viewers'
ideal Christmas companion.''
An ITV spokeswoman said: ``Traditionally the BBC does beat us on Christmas Day,
but we scored a minor victory on Christmas Eve this year when ITV ended up with
a 37% share of the audience compared with the BBC on 30%.''
ITV network director Marcus Plantin welcomed the figures.
``The BBC always keeps its top programming for the Christmas period and last
year BBC1 claimed 53% of the audience on Christmas Eve.
``I'm delighted that we have more than just given them a run for their money
this year. So far the honours are shared. Over the first two days of Christmas
it's 1-1,'' he said.

A DERELICT 148-year-old jail is being transformed into an office block and
tourist attraction at a cost of #2.7m.
Stirling Old Town Jail is part of the town's relaunch as a visitor destination,
a key element of the #100m Stirling Initiative.
Three floors of prison cells have been converted to 4615sq ft of office space.
To guarantee elbow room, two cells are being converted into one office in each
case.
The ground floor is being retained as a visitor centre, complete with furnished
cells, model figures, and exhibitions, plus actors dressed as warders and
prisoners to tell the grim story of the nineteenth century jail.
It will open in March, but The Herald has had exclusive access to the project,
which includes spectacular views of the town from the prison's roof.
The prison opened in 1847, replacing the over-crowded and disease-ridden
Tolbooth Jail. It was taken over by the military authorities at Stirling Castle
from 1888 to 1935, then became a defence training centre, followed by a sweet
factory.
It closed in 1975, and was bought 10 years ago by Stirling District Council.
Funding for the refurbishment has come from the EU and Forth Valley Enterprise.
The Stirling Initiative is a partnership of seven public agencies which aims to
attract #100m of public and private investment into the town over 10 years.
It is almost half way there after two years, with #49.8m worth of investment
secured. To date, most of the money has come from the public purse, but a
spokesman for Forth Valley Enterprise predicted: ``Between now and the turn of
the century there will be a big increase in private sector investment.''
The forecast is based on increased confidence as developments gather speed.
Spending so far has been concentrated on three main areas - infrastructure,
environmental improvements, and the restoration of historic buildings.
Some road schemes have been the subject of criticism, as have plans for the
commercial development of the Forthside area.

THE Church of Scotland must rediscover its identity, clarify its beliefs, and
proclaim the message of salvation if it is to survive into the next century, a
retired minister has said, writes Christopher Reekie.
The Rev Ivor Gibson is the former minister of Abercorn and Dalmeny, South
Queensferry, and now lives in Markinch, Fife. In an article in the January
issue of Life and Work, the Church of Scotland magazine, Mr Gibson says the
Kirk must reaffirm its faith in relation to other Christian denominations.
``The Church of Scotland has lost its identity, its liturgy, its discipline,
its spirituality, its distinctive character, and is almost unrecognisable as a
Reformed church,'' Mr Gibson says.
``Many people today do not know what the church stands for, what it believes
and where it is going.
``There is an appalling ignorance of the Christian message thanks largely to
the failure of religious education in schools, the collapse of Sunday school,
and the lack of church-going.
``If the Kirk goes under, it will not re-emerge, phoenix-like, in the next
century as part of an existing new universal church, but will survive only as a
small sect along with other Christian sects.''
Unless the Kirk clarifies its theology, Mr Gibson says it will ``drift like a
rudderless raft on a sea of uncertainty and will fail to leaven society''.
Mr Gibson says the Kirk's problem today is that, having lost sight of its
Reformed character and its centre ground, it has split down the middle into two
opposing wings, the liberals and the fundamentalists.
The great need of the Church of Scotland today was to restate its faith in the
Trinitarian doctrines of Reformed and traditional Christianity and to reclaim
the centre ground of theology.
Regarding other Christian denominations, Mr Gibson says: ``Let us co-operate on
common issues but go our separate ways on matters of principle.''

<RECORDNO>974684222</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE father of a missing French teenager arrived in Britain yesterday and
appealed for information to find his daughter.
Celine Figard's father, Bernard, will attend a news conference with police
today as detectives launch a full-scale murder hunt based in Southampton for
the 19-year-old accountancy student, missing for a week.
A Home Office computerised inquiry system is being used to co-ordinate the
search across Hampshire, Wiltshire, and the Thames Valley.
Miss Figard was last seen accepting a lift from a lorry driver at a motorway
service station near Newbury, Berkshire, last Tuesday.
Detectives yesterday said they were working on the ``worst-case scenario'' that
she had been murdered. The number of officers involved in the inquiry has been
doubled to more than 100.
A French-speaking police officer has been drafted in to the incident room as an
interpreter.
The policeman leading the hunt, Detective Superintendent Des Thomas, said he
was gravely concerned for Miss Figard's safety.
He said: ``Celine's father has given us as much information as possible to
build up a full background.''
Mrs Figard was too ill to travel and has stayed at the family home in
Ferrieres-Les-Scey, near Chalons-sur-Marne, Franche Compte, in Central France,
while Mr Figard, a farmer, travelled to England with other relatives.
Miss Figard had planned to spend Christmas with a cousin, Jean-Marc Figard, 24,
at the Ashburn hotel in the New Forest, Hampshire, where she worked as a
waitress last summer.
She had been unable to travel by coach because of the public-sector strikes in
France and had been given lifts by French lorry drivers to Newbury.
An English lorry driver had offered her a ride to Salisbury, Wiltshire, and had
said that she could use his mobile phone in his cab.
But nothing has been seen or heard of the teenager since.
Later detectives said they could not rule out a possible link with the
disappearance of a 23-year-old hitch-hiker 30 miles away from the service area
where Miss Figard was last seen.
Finnish-born Eila Karjalainen's naked body was found off the A34 at Woodstock
12 years ago.
She was found on the Blenheim Estate four months after her disappearance in
August 1983. She had been strangled.
She had been on the final stage of a touring holiday across Europe.
Detectives said at the time that she had probably been abducted as she was
hitch-hiking to Wales. Her rucksack and passport was found at a lay-by on the
A40 in Oxfordshire.

A BUSINESSMAN has turned his restaurants into no-go areas for mobile phones.
Diners at the Piccolo Mondo Restaurant, Renfrew, and La Toscanella, Paisley,
are being asked to leave their mobile phones at reception.
If they do receive an urgent call a member of staff will alert them and ask
them to receive it outside the dining area.
Restaurateur Ian Bruce said: ``We fully accept that mobile phones are now a

``We pride ourselves on our food and on our atmosphere and some clients are
clearly disturbed by others conducting phone calls from the next table.''

Police caution
toll protesters
NINE drivers were cautioned for avoiding paying tolls yesterday during a
protest at the #25m Skye bridge. Pipers were in attendance and around 50
people, many carrying banners, took part in the demonstration held by the
pressure-group Skye and Kyle Against Tolls.
The group claims that the prices are the highest on any toll bridge in Europe.
Police issued cautions and a spokesman for the Skye Bridge Company said that
the demonstration passed off peacefully.
Snowball attack
A GANG of youths attacked a motorist who stopped to remonstrate with them for
throwing snowballs at his car at about 11pm on Christmas Day in Tulloch Road,
Perth. The group of nine teenagers, made up of boys and girls, then smashed his
car windscreen before running off. Tayside Police appealed for witnesses.
It can be done
SMOKERS have been told they really can give up the habit in an advertising
campaign launched yesterday. The #13.5m television campaign, produced by the
Health Education Authority, has been timed to coincide with New Year, the
traditional time to pledge to stop smoking. The advertisements, whose slogan is
Break Free, feature former smokers enjoying life and saying how they coped with
they problems of giving up.
Pets' choice fare
A SUPERSTORE is planning cordon bleu cookery for family pets. Asda has already
launched a turkey Christmas dinner for dogs. Now company chiefs are lining up a
new range of meals, including spaghetti bolognese for dogs and fish in white
sauce for cats.
Freezer deal
A COMPANY has signed a contract to ship freezers to freezing Moscow.
Birmingham-based Fridgeland landed the #45,000 deal to supply the ice-bound
Russian capital's first British-style superstore.
Vanishing act
WHILE a magician entertained police at their #25-a-head Christmas dinner dance,
thieves did a disappearing act with #4000 in takings. Officers discovered the
theft at the annual dance at Chigwell Police Club, Essex, and had to report the
crime to their own CID. Now ``Crisco'', the Isle of Wight-based conjurer, has
offered to do a benefit show to raise money for the officers.
Haldane hurt
PHOTOGRAPHER Roderick Haldane, 83, was recovering in hospital last night
following surgery on a fractured knee, damaged when he fell near his Edinburgh
home at the weekend. Haldane, famous for his award-winning photographs of the
Queen Mother, Sir Noel Coward, Charlie Chaplin and Marlene Dietrich, was on his
way to a lunch-time party when the accident happened in Great King Street. Last
night a member of his staff said: ``He is comfortable but rather bored and
upset to have missed all the Christmas parties.''

AS the Atlantic waters to the west of Shetland begin to disclose the secrets of
the oil wealth which lies below them, another mystery has emerged.
The development of the Foinaven field has revealed a vessel lying in 400 metres
of water which, four years after being spotted, has not yet been identified.
The shipwreck is believed to be a vessel which was bombed or torpedoed during
the Second World War. She lies just outside the anchor pattern for the field's
floating production, storage, and offloading vessel which is due on location in
the spring.
The 100 metre-long wreck was found during a sonar survey of the seabed.
As the Foinaven plan was developed further surveys were carried out to
determine whether the shipwreck might interfere with the routes of flowlines
which bring the oil to the surface.
A video survey of the ship was carried out three months ago and although it
showed the ship in detail it provided no clues to her identity.
It particularly interested Shetlander Les Thomson, who is Foinaven operations
manager and owns a painting of a similar vessel.
The wreck is likely to have been a coal burning merchant steamer of between
3000 and 4000 tonnes and with two cargo holds fore and aft.
Her funnel has vanished as has most of her timber deck.
However, despite being encrusted with marine growth, the sub-sea video clearly
shows a gun mounted at the rear of the vessel.
Small tracked vehicles are also visible on the remains of the forward deck but
experts say they are too small to be tanks.
A large hole in the side of the ship at the rear suggests a possible cause for
her sinking but extensive inquiries by BP have failed to shed any light on the
vessel's history.
The lack of a name of the vessel is not unusual because during the war vessels
painted out identification.
One theory which has been suggested to BP is that the vessel was on one of the
Murmansk convoys to Russia, many of which were routed round the North of
Scotland and fell victim to enemy fire.

AN AWARD of more than #2m has been made for 22 research and development
projects by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council as part of its
funding initiatives programme.
The announcement of the award will be made today by Heriot-Watt University,
Edinburgh, which is involved in the projects. A spokeswoman said the projects
would be run in conjunction with other Scottish universities and higher
education institutions.
A key project was a #900,000 three-year scheme to train academic staff
throughout Scotland in how to use the Metropolitan Area Network system to
improve their teaching and learning skills.
The ``Talisman'' project, which would be based at the learning technology
centre at Heriot-Watt's Riccarton campus in Edinburgh, would provide training
courses throughout Scotland.
Dr Roger Rist, the learning technology centre director, said: ``This funding
demonstrates the recognition of our position at the heart of teaching and
learning developments using network technology.
``Talisman will help academic staff throughout Scotland to make the best use of
the MAN network for teaching, learning, and research, and in turn their
students will benefit from new methods of learning and access to information
resources.''
Professor Robin Knops, special adviser to the Principal at Heriot-Watt, said:
``We are delighted that so many of our research and development proposals have
been approved against seemingly strong competition.''

THE RAC is the latest organisation to support a move to put Britain on European
time, arguing that an extra hour of daylight in the evenings would cut
rush-hour congestion and accidents.
The motoring group added its voice yesterday to a call for change which has
found few allies in Scotland. The RAC claimed that an extra hour of daylight in
the late afternoon would encourage more people to walk or use bicycles for
short journeys. It also claimed that lighter evenings would also mean more
children walking home from school rather than being given lifts.
The RAC is joining the British Tourist Authority, the CBI, and the Police
Federation south of the Border in supporting the controversial private Bill put
forward by the Tory MP for Bournemouth West, Mr John Butterfill.
He wants to see British clocks set to European time resulting in lighter
evenings but darker mornings during the winter, particularly in the North of
Scotland.
The MP has argued that more road accidents occur in the evening and that a
change to European time would mean 660 fewer accidents and an extra #1000m for
tourism.
A number of Scots MPs including Liberal Democrat MP for North-east Fife Menzies
Campbell, Labour's George Robertson, and the Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth, have already expressed their opposition to the Bill. But others,
including Labour's George Foulkes, say they will vote in favour of the Bill.
Last night the president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, Mr John
Ross, said the organisation had already expressed its opposition to Scottish
MPs. ``Our position has always been to resist this change because, especially
in the North of Scotland, it would mean that outside stock cannot be tended to
until very late.''
He said the creation of one time zone across Europe would mean the UK belonged
to the biggest time zone in the world and added that farmers were extremely
unhappy with the proposal.
But the RAC's head of campaigns, Mr Edmund King, said: ``There are clear road
safety benefits to be gained from longer winter afternoons and tackling the
crucial darkness danger zone at the end of the school day should be paramount
in the minds of MPs considering the Bill.''

LABOUR's Scottish home affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, yesterday called for
tighter legislation covering the possession of firearms.
His demand followed the release of Government figures which showed a steady
rise in the number of certificates issued for handguns and shotguns.
Mr McFall said the number of permits in Scotland now exceeded 100,000, and
claimed that the statistics suggested a reversal of the decline in demand for
guns which had followed the implementation of the Firearms (Amendment) Act in
1988.
The number of applications for a new firearm certificate rose last year to
2005, up from 1783 in 1993, while the correponding figure for shotguns was
3653, an increase of more than 700 on the previous year.
Mr McFall said: ``The laws governing the control of shotguns should be brought
into line with those governing other firearms. At present, a person possessing
a firearms certificate may purchase an additional firearm only with the
authority of a chief constable.
``However, someone who holds a shotgun certificate can acquire any number of
shotguns without further permission. This situation should be changed.''
Last year, Scottish police forces recorded 1778 offences in which a firearm was
used, with the number involving a pistol or revolver up by 47%.
``The use of guns in the pursuit of criminal activities is obviously much more
common now than it was 20 years ago, and the more guns that are in circulation,
the more likely it is that something will fall into the wrong hands,'' said Mr
McFall.

EDINBURGH and Glasgow have maintained their positions as Britain's top tourist
destinations outside London with overseas visitors.
A report by the British Tourist Authority and English Tourist Board shows
London topped the group this year with 11.46 million ``staying visits''.
Edinburgh had 970,000 while Glasgow, with 500,000, beat top English cities such
as Oxford, Bath, and York.
Inverness came tenth ahead of traditional holiday spots such as Brighton,
Canterbury, and Stratford-upon-Avon.
Mr Roger Carter, chief executive of Edinburgh Tourist Board, said: ``The large
increase in visitors to the city reflects its continuing investment in
improving tourism facilities and services.''
The board believes that confirmation by the United Nations of the capital's
World Heritage Status will attract even more visitors in future.
In Glasgow, tourist officials believe the city's Festival of Visual Arts 1996
will generate an additional 385,000 visitors and generate an additional #10m
for the economy.
Mr Jack Munro, chief executive of Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and Convention
Bureau, put the city's continued success down to sustained targeted marketing
coupled with a heavy programme of product development.
He said: ``A programme of major international events has been a key factor in
establishing Glasgow as a major European cultural destination.''
Mr Alistair Macpherson, tourism director for Inverness, Loch Ness, and Nairn
Tourist Board, said: ``As the capital of the Highlands, Inverness has always
been a major attraction for overseas visitors.
``The ever-improving road and rail connections and the forthcoming release of
the film Loch Ness should make us even more popular in 1996 and beyond.''
Scotland has enjoyed an average four per cent increase in overseas visitors
each year for the past 10 years.
The Scottish Tourist Board said it hoped to build on this growth with resources
made available by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth for an international
marketing drive.
The Scottish Tourist Board 1996 Overseas Guide is printed in six foreign
languages and distributed throughout the world as an information guide for
visitors interested in coming to Scotland.

THE Government is stalling for time on the final announcement of the
destination of the #5000m Trident nuclear submarine refit programme, in the
hope that a face-saving deal can be struck with potential buyers of Devonport
shipyard.
Workers at the Plymouth yard were promised two weeks ago that they would know
their fate before Christmas. However, Parliament rose last Wednesday for its
New Year recess without a mention of the issue or of privatisation plans for
the complex.
Earlier this month The Herald revealed exclusively that a number of options
were being considered, including the possibility of the four Vanguard-class
boats being refuelled at Rosyth and refurbished at Devonport to avoid a totally
embarrassing political U-turn.
The original deal favouring the lower tender put forward by Devonport
Management Ltd, the consortium operating the yard, is no longer relevant on
cost grounds. Estimates for upgrading the Plymouth complex to meet nuclear
safety requirements range from #500m to #700m above DML's bid.
The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the independent body responsible for
licensing atomic facilities in the UK, has already said that serious problems
exist at the site because of the instability of the limestone base on which it
is built.
To comply with nuclear safety rules, DML would have to prove that a 16,000-ton
Vanguard submarine could be held securely in drydock during the replacement of
its highly radioactive fuel rods in the event of an earthquake or large
explosion.
Critics have always said the contract was awarded to the English yard more
because of the threat to four marginal Conservative parliamentary seats in the
South-west than because of financial or practical considerations.
The Government's last real hope of a get-out is outright purchase of the
Devonport complex, coupled to grants which might help ease the improvement
burden for a potential buyer.

<HEADLINE>Union sees shortcomings as a warning Tunnel fire study critical of rail safety</HEADLINE>

A POTENTIALLY ``disastrous'' fire in the Moncrieffe tunnel last March has been
cited by the Rail, Maritime, and Transport union as an example of how
pre-privatisation fragmentation of the rail industry could make the system less
safe.
Commenting on a damning indictment of rail safety procedures contained in a
confidential internal investigation into a fire in the tunnel between Hilton
and Perth in the early hours of Sunday, March 26 this year, RMT general
secretary Jimmy Knapp said the safety plan was ``clearly wholly inadequate''.
The rail unions have been warning for some time that safety is likely to suffer
through more and more fragmentation of what in the past would have been the
sole responsibility of British Rail.
Neither Railtrack, which has overall reponsibility for rail safety, nor BR
Infrastructure Services, whose staff were involved, wanted to apportion blame
and both stressed that they had jointly investigated the incident and would
continue to work together to enhance safety procedures wherever possible.
There were no serious injuries during the fire which broke out during rerailing
operations, but the joint investigation shows that was largely fortuitous
because unknown to the fire brigade rescue team there were hazardous materials
and eight staff in the tunnel even after it was supposed to have been evacuated.
``On arrival at the scene the officer in charge from the brigade received
minimal information from our supervisor who told him that everyone was out of
the tunnel and that no hazardous materials were present'', says the report.
But both pieces of information proved incorrect ``and could have had disastrous
consequences,'' concludes the safety study completed earlier this month but not
published.
The report details how the 1210-yard tunnel includes three ventilation shafts,
all of which have been blocked off as an anti-vandalism measure, and has no in
situ lighting. Four days before the work was due to commence there were
consultations between the Tayside Fire Brigade station safety officer and
Railtrack's fire safety manager.
At 2.30am on March 26 all but two of the 27-strong maintenance team entered the
tunnel and were operating two rail laying machines some 900 yards from the
south end of the tunnel when at 5.05am one caught fire. The resulting fumes and
gas accumulation forced the staff to evacuate before any remedial action could
be taken.
Emergency services were alerted within five minutes and arrived eight minutes
later to be informed that all staff had been evacuated and all traffic halted.
Two firefighters with breathing apparatus were sent into the tunnel but were
withdrawn when the smoke thickened considerably and temporary lighting failed.
``At 05.32hrs despite assurances to Fire Brigade personnel that all staff had
evacuated the tunnel, several trackmen exited the tunnel to the Hilton end
suffering the effects of smoke inhalation. They received oxygen treatment from
fire crews and an ambulance was summoned.''
Around 5.55am the smoke dissipated sufficiently for fire crews to enter and
finally extinguish the fire at 6.07 and casualties were treated on site before
being transferred to Perth Royal Infirmary.
Conclusions include:
q There were no fire extinguishers on site to enable the fire to be tackled at
an early stage.
q There was no formal evacuation plan and the haphazard evacuation of the
tunnel resulted in eight men passing through the cloud of fumes and
experiencing smoke inhalation.
q No roll call was taken at a nominated rendezvous point which meant that the
eight were unaccounted for in a period of 25 minutes.
q Together with the unrevealed presence of acetylene and oxygen in the tunnel
this could have had ``disastrous consequences''.
Recommendations include the removal from service of all Bruff rail laying
machines until plastic fuel tanks have been replaced by steel ones and
electrical systems checked; suitable fire fighting equipment to be located on
site when similar work is being carried out in tunnels; and development of an
agreed method of evacuation in the event of emergencies to include fire
assembly points and roll calls.
Despite assurances to fire brigade personnel that all staff had evacuated the
tunnel, several trackmen exited the tunnel suffering the effects of smoke
inhalation

HEADMASTER Philip Lawrence was yesterday named Personality of the Year on BBC
Radio 4's Today programme.
Mr Lawrence, who was fatally stabbed outside his London school while helping a
pupil who was being attacked, polled 23,130 of the 77,570 votes cast by the
programme's listeners.
His widow, Frances, said she was deeply moved, although she believed her
husband, who was a modest man, would have been very embarrassed.
On the programme Mrs Lawrence said: ``One realises that dreadful events are in
the minority, that most people were appalled at what happened.
``That is very comforting because when faced with what we were faced with that
Friday night the world becomes an evil place. But now one can see it isn't all
evil - that it is mostly good.''
She said the Government had not gone far enough in its response to the tragedy,
on December 8, and called for a forum of politicians, churchmen, and ordinary
people to try to re-evaluate what is happening to society.
Mrs Lawrence said it should try to give guidance away from what her husband
called the ``obsessive drive for personal possession'' and back to spiritual
values.
She added:``It is not enough to get rid of knives. That won't get rid of
violence. We must attack it on a much more basic level.''
Cardinal Basil Hume, head of the Roman Catholic Church in England, said: ``I am
very moved at the award. Philip Lawrence was a good husband, a good father, and
a good man.''
Runner-up, for the second year running, was the Prime Minister, who got 18,260
votes.
Third was assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, followed by the
Princess of Wales, Labour leader Tony Blair, and the Queen Mother.

<HEADLINE>Sri Lankan urged to alter action</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE International Cricket Council (ICC) has urged Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah
Muralitharan to alter his suspect action to guarantee his future as a Test
player.
Cricket's world governing body issued a statement after Muralitharan's bowling
method was ruled illegal by Australian umpire Darrell Hair on the opening day
of the second Test against Australia in Melbourne yesterday.
``We sincerely trust that the BCCSL (Sri Lanka Cricket Board of Control) will
work with this player to take whatever corrective action is necessary so that
he can continue to represent his country,'' ICC chief executive David Richards
said in a statement released through the Australian Cricket Board.
``To that end, the ICC remains prepared to assist the achievement of this
objective in any way that we can.''
In detailing its past concerns over Muralitharan's bowling action - dating back
three years - the ICC defended Hair's ruling: ``It is every umpire's duty to
apply the laws of cricket fully and impartially and we stand in full support of
those umpires who execute this responsibility to the best of their ability. The
relevant law is clear and the game cannot accept any breach of this law,'' the
statement said.
Muralitharan, whose action has been questioned in the past, was no-balled seven
times in three overs before switching ends without further incident. He claimed
the wicket of Mark Waugh for 61.
Australia, leading the three-Test series 1-0, finished an eventful day on 234
for three.
Asked if Muralitharan's Test future was under threat because of the umpire's
decision, Sri Lanka team manager Duleep Mendis said after close of play:
``Naturally, it is. If it continues, obviously we have to do something about
it.''
He said that Muralitharan may try to make a slight alteration to his action.
The Sri Lankans were clearly stunned by events yesterday, just 24 hours after
they were exonerated by the ICC of ball-tampering during their defeat in the
first Test two weeks ago.
q.WEST Indies slumped to their fifth successive limited-overs defeat on tour in
Australia when they lost by four wickets to Queensland in Brisbane yesterday.
Replying to West Indies' 50-over 206 for eight, Queensland cruised to 207 for
six with 17 balls to spare.
After three defeats against Australia and Sri Lanka in the World Series
tournament and a humiliating loss to the youngsters of the Australian Cricket
Academy, West Indies' top order failed yet again.
They were in dire straits on 121 for six after 35 overs before off-spinner
Roger Harper rallied the innings with an unbeaten 46 from 51 balls.
Harper, who smashed the last ball of the innings for 6, shared a 77-run
partnership from 88 balls with Jimmy Adams to lift their side to a respectable
total. But it was to prove inadequate when Queensland captain Stuart Law got
into his stride.
Law, a member of Australia's limited overs side but overlooked for Test duty,
scored 70 from 84 balls.

JAMES Traynor's recollections of past England-Scotland confrontations revives
many memories. The Scottish media did their best to play down our humiliating
defeats, while heaping praise on our few successes.
I remember the headline Three Cheers For Scotland in an evening paper on April
15, 1961, which raised my hopes as I was unaware of the result - but
underneath, Nine For England soon informed me of the reality.
It is a pity that the war-time internationals between the two countries are not
included in the records. No less than 14 matches were played and, while
Scotland got done over in most of them, I remember seeing one of their few
successes, a 5-4 win at Hampden in April, 1942.
The highest attendance at a war-time international was 133,000 at Hampden on
April 22, 1944, when England won 3-2. England had legendary players in Swift,
Mercer, Matthews, Carter, and Lawton, who proved on most occasions - including
an 8-0 win at Manchester - too far ahead of the Scots in skill.
One unusual incident occurred in the match at Hampden on April 17, 1943
(England won 4-0). An off-the-ball incident saw England's Stan Cullis collapse
in agony. The Scots player involved never played for Scotland again.

Performances of the Year
q LOCK, stock and barrel of awards to the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra,
its chief conductor, the sensational Yuri Temirkanov, and the late Peter
Tchaikovsky. The legendary St Petersburg Phil took up a residency in Glasgow in
October during the week of the fifth anniversary celebrations of the city's
Royal Concert Hall. In two nights they gave three concerts. Over the three
shows they played all six of Tchaikovsky's symphonies.
The concerts included some of the most searing and emotional perfomances I have
ever heard, with Temirkanov in devastating form, and the unbelievably
rich-sounding band producing playing that was out of this world: stupendous
orchestral articulation in a sensational finale to the Fourth Symphony, a
completely heartbreaking Fifth that reduced even the hardest-nosed listeners to
tears, and a final Sixth Symphony that plumbed the depths of Tchaikovsky's
fatal depression, ending in utter blackness.
Record of the Year
q COMPLETELY partisan view here. James MacMillan, whose level of inspiration
appears to be unfaltering, last year produced a work unsurpassed in his output,
the intensely moving Seven Last Words from the Cross, for chorus and string
orchestra. This year, the CD recording was issued, confirming the work as a
masterpiece. Spellbinding and awe-inspiring, the music is powerful, majestic,
harrowing, and beautiful enough to move the most entrenched agnostic. One to
live with and cherish.
Music book of the Year
q MAYNARD Ferguson's astonishing study of Mozart - ``Mozart: A Life'',
published by Hutchison - brings the genius to life, characterising him as never
before. Every aspect of Mozart's life, from his composing facility, his
personal relationships, and - above all - his ambivalent relationship with his
father, the endlessly manipulative Leopold, who turned the infant prodigy into
an industry and made him psychologically dependent, leaps off the page.
Indispensible.
Scoop of the Year
q THE tiny Vale of Glamorgan Festival, run on a shoestring with a part-time
administration, and so brilliantly devised that it stands as an exemplar of
contemporary music festival, stunned the world and the musical establishment
when it won Britain's biggest arts prize of #100,000. The Vale festival,
beating off the giants and multinationals of the classical music business, had
earlier picked up the #25,000 prize in the music category - this had been
announced and awarded in Glasgow.
In the final, each category winner - from music, theatre, opera dance, visual
art and film - competed for a further #75,000. The results were announced in
the Olivier Theatre at London's South Bank Centre with the cream of the
establishment represented. As the announcement of the Vale of Glamorgan's
success was made, a spontaneous and bloodcurdling series of Pictish whoops of
triumph was heard to erupt among the dinner-suited mob.
It's long-enough ago now for me to admit that they came from this writer, who
had been on the judging panel for the music award, and who, with composer Steve
Martland, had fought to get the Vale of Glamorgan first prize. Well done, the
small fry.

TO perform Cosi fan tutte on an island in the Bay of Naples is no more a
guarantee of success than to perform Die Meistersinger in Nurnberg. Yet it was
in the shadow of Vesuvius that Mozart set his last Italian comedy, and there is
always the hope, however romantic, that the atmosphere of the place might
induce someone to stage it there.
It was for Ischia, therefore, that I recently embarked to test the truth of the
theory. Each year in the idyllic villa where Sir William Walton once lived, and
where his widow continues to commemorate him in various ways, a three-week
course entitled The Actor in Opera is held. With Martin Isepp, from
Glyndebourne, as musical director, Colin Graham as producer and Catherine
Wilson and Leonard Hancock (both formerly of Scottish Opera) as assistants, a
small team of gifted young British and Italian singers are taught how to
portray the roles they have already learnt to sing.
Graham, a half-Scot who, with Sir Alexander Gibson, once presented Peter Grimes
and Pelleas et Melisande for Scottish Opera, is a producer in the old-fashioned
mould, who presides serenely over stagings that grow out of the music and are
invariably true to the story line. Just before this year's sessions, however,
he had to undergo emergency heart surgery. A replacement was needed. And so,
into the calm of the Walton villa and its exquisite Italian gardens, stepped
Ian Judge like the proverbial bull in a china shop.
Judge, too, has worked for Scottish Opera, though rather more recently than
Graham. In Falstaff he obscured Verdi's music beneath layers of knockabout
comedy. In Bellini's Norma he so offended the company's women choristers that,
in his own words, he is unlikely to be invited back.
From the start he made plain that working on Ischia was a bit beneath his
dignity. The singers, he said, were ``slow.'' The Walton museum, where the
performances took place, was the wrong shape. It all seemed more trouble than
it was worth.
Yet gradually Cosi cast its spell. The room was rearranged so that the opera
could be presented in the round, with the singers so close to the audience that
everybody could share their unfolding emotions. And to liberate his cast from
what he considered to be their lethargy, Judge devised various tasks for them -
singing arias while improvising wholly incongruous action, learning how to move
at a wholly different pace from the music. As time ticked by, a meticulously
detailed scenario began to evolve.
Working in the round, it soon became apparent, is more challenging than singing
from behind a proscenium arch. The singers must learn to project their
personalities in constantly changing directions. Their entrances and exits,
because they take place through the audience, must form part of the drama. Not
until you see such a production in rehearsal do you realise quite what it
involves.
Because Judge was working with inexperienced performers, it seemed possible
that his staging might prove a misjudgment. He simply did not have time to get
the sort of results he desired, especially in the presence of an increasingly
exasperated musical director (and in fact, in the end, only Act One of the
opera was staged, with Act Two presented in a concert version).
Yet although his demands at times seemed brutal, they were pertinent to current
trends in opera. ``If you're going to enter while music is being played, you
must always enter faster than the music,'' he told one singer. ``Don't enter
slower, and don't enter at the same speed or you'll seem to be dancing.'' What
Mozart himself would have expected is hard to say, but seemed beside the point.
``Despina, release yourself from the music. What you're doing is starting to
fit your actions to the notes. Do everything in the wrong rhythm. Some very
famous singers are completely locked into the music. Don't let this happen to
you.''
But the rehearsals were not merely a matter of movement, even if a lot of time
was spent showing the unwilling Italian Dorabella how to fall down during an
aria. ``What you must do is fall and turn. Your knee mustn't hit the ground.''
(Judge thereupon fell expertly upon the Italian marble floor, but ended up in
casualty with a damaged knee).
The following day was spent going through the text in search of psychological
``clues''. The implications of Don Alfonso's cruel practical joke were
analysed. The cast were asked to decide for themselves what happens at the end
of the opera. ``I won't tell you,'' Judge told them. ``Mozart always leaves the
ends of his acts open.''
Though some would say that the ending of Cosi is perfectly explicit if Don
Alfonso's final lines are followed, modern producers are invariably blind to
what they don't want to see. As rehearsals progressed, Judge seemed displeased
to be told that the action of Cosi is meant to take place within a single day,
or that when, in the context of this opera, the clock strikes six it actually
means noon (Italy, in Mozart's time, used clocks that struck no higher than
six).
It was at this point - for me if not yet for the rehearsals - that time ran
out. The public performances, when finally given, won praise, and the
production, in an amended version, went to Wexford.
Ian Judge's version of La Belle Helene forEnglish National Opera has won
muchpraise. Conrad Wilson saw him at workin Italy earlier in the year,
alongsideother former Scottish Opera stalwarts

DOMINIC Cork was forced to settle for second place in the fourth Test yesterday
after St George's Park had staged its own version of Derby day in Port
Elizabeth.
Cork kept England's flag fluttering by picking up two wickets when they were
most needed, even though the early going looked anything but helpful for a
thoroughbred fast bowler.
However, he could not find a way past Daryll Cullinan, the batsman who was his
Derbyshire team-mate last season. but the pair do not act like best buddies and
both are coy when asked about their professional relationship.
Cullinan wore the bigger smile yesterday after having led South Africa out of
trouble and into the relatively calm waters of 230 for four by scoring an
undefeated 83.
``It's not particularly a rivalry,'' said Cullinan. ``But I think he enjoys
getting my wicket. He's a good competitor and that brings the best out of
batsmen.''
Cork failed to pick up anyone's wicket during South Africa's only innings at
Durban, where the third Test was wrecked by rain. In Port Elizabeth the
all-rounder found himself operating on a pitch that was slow enough and low
enough to break a bowler's heart.
A capacity crowd of 18,000 witnessed a rare event in recent South African
history - a full day's cricket without a single interruption for bad weather.
Mike Atherton's failure to guess correctly between heads and tails could yet
prove to be the most significant moment in this match.
The bounce is likely to become variable and if there is turn by the time of the
fourth innings of the match, South Africa have an 18-year-old wrist spinner -
Paul Adams - who will be only too keen to exploit it.
After the close of play bookmakers rated England 8-1 outsiders to win the Test,
with South Africa at 2-1, and the draw 4-9 favourite. For the moment, though,
England are by no means out of it, thanks mainly to Cork's ability to conjure
up a little magic.
His first trick came when South Africa, moving along slowly but surely, had
reached 57 for nought. Brought back just before lunch, the all-rounder moved
one away just enough to clip the outside edge of Andrew Hudson's bat.
That was the inspiration England badly needed. After the interval they picked
up two wickets in the space of three overs.
Hansie Cronje, determined not to repeat the reckless drive against spinner
Richard Illingworth that brought his downfall in Durban, overdid the caution by
taking 24 deliveries to get off the mark. Then, having pulled Peter Martin to
the fence, South Africa's captain fell two deliveries later.
Driving at Martin, Cronje failed to get to the pitch of the ball and was
superbly caught by Atherton, anticipating the stroke and diving to his right,
at short extra cover.
When left-handed opener Gary Kirsten, having just completed a half-century
including nine boundaries, snicked Mark Ilott low to first slip, South Africa
were wobbling on 89 for three.
Cullinan looks a far better batsman when attacking rather than defending, and
he refused to let a potentially tricky situation prevent him from going after
anything remotely loose.
There is a rumour that Cullinan did not particularly enjoy his time with
Derbyshire. If that is true, scoring runs against a former colleague would
inevitably give him particular satisfaction. But he refuses to give anything
away on that score.
In any event, South Africa's No.4 rose to the challenge which Cork and the rest
of England's attack were presenting during a picture-changing stand of 118 with
Jonty Rhodes.
Cullinan, who walked away undefeated and only 17 runs away from the second Test
century of his career, collected 13 boundaries - a good number of them driven
handsomely though the covers.
``We were wobbling a bit after lunch, but Daryll and Jonty both played
marvellous innings,'' said home coach Bob Woolmer.
Rhodes enjoyed one slice of luck on 20 when edging a forcing shot against Ilott
that Graeme Hick, leaping at second slip, touched but could not hold.
Soon afterwards he hooked Cork for the 6 that completed a century partnership
and it looked as though England would finish the day with only three wickets to
show for a spirited bowling performance.
Cork, however, had other ideas. Rhodes had made 49 when he pulled a short ball
from the paceman low to Robin Smith at square leg and the tourists could feel
reasonably satisfied, if not thrilled, with their efforts.

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
THE Dallas Cowboys earned the right to home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs by defeating Arizona Cardinals 37-13 at the venue for Super Bowl XXX
in Sun Devil Stadium, Tempe.
Running back Emmitt Smith tied up the league rushing title and in the process
broke one of the NFL's most prized records. With a three-yard run late in the
match he surpassed the record for most touchdowns in a season - the 24 set by
Washington Redskins' running back John Riggins in 1983.
Smith, who already had the league rushing title before the game, also tied a
team record with his eleventh consecutive game with at least one rushing
touchdown. It was his 100th career touchdown - tying him for ninth on the
all-time list behind the 156 of San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice.
The Cowboys (12-4) lost the home-field advantage to San Francisco last year,
and were beaten 38-28 by the 49ers in the NFC championship game. This time, the
right to play at home until the Super Bowl has gone to the Cowboys.

THE streets of Glasgow are not safe. Not safe at all. Guns and knives,
aggressive words, motor vehicles careering out of control, city-centre smog,
drug-induced acts of depravity - all are fears that most of us have grown
accustomed to. We know they're there, but still we go out, we swagger along, we
sing merry tunes in our heads. We're twentieth-century folk; both brave and
stupid.
But there is a growing fear on the streets today employing a different kind of
weapon, one cunningly disguised behind a waxed smile and a bleeding heart, one
that challenges our chirpy complexion.
The weapon - increasingly present in the city centre - is the dreaded,
much-feared question; unsolicited, brutally direct, delivered in a pucker
manner by a total stranger, and one that the chosen victim feels unable to
ignore. Questions like: ``Would you like to make a donation?'', ``Would you
like to buy a copy of . . ?'', ``Are you interested in . . ?'', and ``Can I
tempt you into . . ?'' Endless questions making endless demands on our
generosity and civility.
This escalating fear is brought to us by the street touts - and suddenly they
seem to be everywhere. No-one is safe. The perpetrators strike indiscriminately
and with little or no warning. They are after everyone of us, after our money,
after our time and attention, after our allegiance to a cause.
Basically we're all people with little missions. There are those who like to
take a ball of thought and wander the streets unravelling it at their leisure,
while some seek to defeat huge shopping lists in record-breaking time, others
seek to rein the sprawling energies of children as they keep one clear
destination in mind.
Missions unsuccessful. Now, interruptions knot the mind and impede our
ambitions: the sharpened rhetoric of Living Marxism sellers; the brandished
tins of good causes rattling like sabres; furtive, murky-eyed men selling
arcane pamphlets and felt-tipped pens; the dispossessed, ghostly faces of the
homeless with their apologetic and childlike stares, their bony hands
stretching out for spare change, and something ineffable that money can't buy.
Not to mention the vacant disposition of migrant Buddhists waving their
esoteric books like grenades made of strange-smelling paper.
Are these growing pieces of mobile ``street furniture'' something that pestered
shoppers will simply have to get used to?
At the moment no single body is in control of this expanding limb. Major
charities are licensed by the Secretary of State and are, therefore, allowed to
tout for donations at any time - in just one day in October Oxfam sent 175
volunteers on to the city centre streets. Only smaller charities must apply to
Glasgow City Council, and the licensing department reports that where a charity
had previously asked for one day in a year, now they can be requesting up to
five days.
``Buy a copy of the Big Issue'' is the clearest and most heard request on our
streets. But the magazine distributed by ``the homeless'' seems to be growing
out of the creator's control. The magazine claims to have no clear figures on
how many people are selling the magazine - all it can say is that roughly 3000
people are selling the magazine in Scotland. And with the magazine having been
classed as a ``street paper'' it is free of council control.
The reasons for the growth in numbers of people touting on our streets are
varied, but distil into one barrel: necessity. Charities, the homeless,
political organisations, religions, scam merchants, all are after money - they
need it, and touting seems a quick way to get it.
Blame is invariably placed at the Government's door. The homeless blame
stringent legislation that has turned the social safety net into a loosely
cordoned-off abyss. Charities blame the National Lottery for forcing them to
traipse the streets branding the captured/generous (delete as appropriate) with
an invariably unsightly sticker. Socialists are a little different - when not
blaming the Government for one misdemeanour or another, they turn to blaming
each other instead.
But Scots are generous people. Always have been. They give, then give again,
just for the sheer shiny hell of it. So maybe street touting is just the old
community spirit - said to be oh so dead today - returning in another form. A
bit like giving a bowl of sugar to a neighbour - it's just that the community
is somewhat bigger, and you're highly unlikely ever to see the bowl - or the
sugar for that matter - returned. Convinced? Thought not.
Generosity that is boundless is as rare as a five-headed baby. But it's
difficult to be bountiful with the feel-good factor still missing, presumed
dead. And each week there's the National Lottery inculcating the belief into a
nation that there is no need to give something in return for nothing.
Generosity, if not having five heads, at least now has two faces.
Get used to it. Stomach it. Is that what we're learning to do? Or are we
already learning to walk past it, head down, gaze averted? The rise in street
touting is indeed an exposed artery showing the current social state of the
country, but the growing reaction of people is equally telling.
Slowly people seem to be mustering the ability to decline requests - and thus
another barrier between people is steadily being erected for the sake of our
own needs, or wishes, or whatever we want to call them.
And so another fear stalks the shadows threatening to invade the daylight; the
death of generosity itself, its weapon cutting like a swallowed razor blade.
Perhaps it would be better, after all, just to get used to street touts, to
endure, rather than face such a frightening reality walking the streets;
unavoidable, right inside every one of us - even if it is one we can acquire
free of charge.

lunacy is the
friend of the
faux, as fake
furs become
unashamedly
ludicrous.
John Davidson
visits a fantasy
island of
foxy dreams
ONCE upon a time, it was a nasty evil thing. The fake fur coat, that is - so
unconvincing, in bands of over-coloured static bristle. It tried and tried to
look real: impersonating mink, trying to appear foxy. Yet, somehow it only ever
resembled a vulgar car-seat cover. And that was before kitsch seemed in any way
cute. No ice princess would have been caught frost-bitten in such a garment. At
all those great occasions in her snow-covered realm, nothing but the real thing
would ever have done.
But in these ever-so-nice nineties, we are increasingly obliged to be caring,
concerned, and kind to wee furry animals. Reality, in these times, most
certainly bites. So what is an ice princess to choose for the trappings of
contemporary glamour? There is a new breed of hairy beast on the loose: the
fantasy fur coat, developed from a surprisingly luxurious strain of acrylic
pile fabrics.
Just as attitudes to fur have changed, so has the way we fake it. Sometimes it
still apes those wilder reaches of reality - almost literally, of course, when
the fur being mimicked is monkey. But more often, today's high fashion faux
furs are as unashamedly ludicrous as they are gorgeous, glamorous and glorious.
For they revel in their obvious fakery; they represent an art of the
all-but-impossible by appearing about as unlikely a pelt as possible.
The ultimate coat? For this festive season, our own ice princess chose one,
long and white - as abominable as the mythical Yeti, yet silken to the touch.
Or another, short and rather sporty, raggedly curled like the fleece of a
Mongolian lamb on E. And like all good fairy tales, these are only
make-believe. Everyone (except perhaps those little acryls) can live happily
ever after.

DUBLIN Flyer can prove himself a chaser of the highest class with victory in
today's rearranged King George VI Tripleprint Chase at Kempton, writes White
and Gold.
The dashing front-runner was one of last season's top handicappers, successful
in thrilling style in the Gold Cup at Cheltenham and the John Hughes Trophy at
Aintree.
He looked worth a crack at the best opposition when defying 11st 8lb in the
Mackeson Gold Cup at Cheltenham on his reappearance last month, rallying
splendidly to beat Egypt Mill Prince by half a length. His jumping will stand
the test in a race which promises to be run at a searching gallop.
By contrast, neither Barton Bank nor One Man inspire total confidence at the
fences in a race which has lost some of its edge now that the original entry
has shrunk.
Atours can give David Elsworth a third successive win in the Bonusprint
Christmas Hurdle after Muse and Absalom's Lady. The seven-year-old developed
into a smart hurdler last term, going down by just a neck to his stable
companion in this event.
He scored in small fields here and at Wincanton before a close second to the
then Champion Hurdle favourite Large Action at Ascot over a two-and-a-half-mile
trip which is possibly too far for him. Atours will be well suited by this
return to two miles.
Easy Buck looks the best bet in the Tripleprint Handicap Chase. The gelding
showed useful form in winning twice last season and does not look to have
deteriorated, judged on his reappearance victory at Newbury last month.
The eight-year-old hit the front soon after halfway and would have scored by
further than his eventual length-and-a-half winning margin but for tiring in
the closing stages.

IN ENGLAND
DAVID Ginola prepared himself to come face to face with Eric Cantona for the
first time in England today, confident that Newcastle will show they have
earned the right to call themselves the best team in the country.
Ginola's public dispute with his fellow Gaul has been well documented, although
he did hold out an olive branch last week by expressing the hope that both men
would be named in the French squad for next summer's European Championship
finals.
But the friendly overtures will go on hold for 90 minutes as 28-year-old Ginola
and his St James' Park team-mates aim to extend the lead over Alex Ferguson's
Manchester United to a commanding 13 points.
Ginola, outstanding as Kevin Keegan's side clocked up their tenth successive
Premiership home victory over Nottingham Forest on Saturday, roared out a
message of defiance as he declared: ``I think we're better than United at the
moment.''
``We're mentally very good, very strong, and we have the right team spirit
within the squad - in fact, everything that helps you to play good football and
be happy on the pitch.
``I think it's an important game, but it's not the last game of the season, not
even the most important one of the season.
``We're 10 points ahead and even if we lose we'll still be seven points ahead,
so it won't be a major blow.
``But if we really want to be able to call ourselves the best team in England,
we have to be able to beat United tomorrow.''
Ginola exuded confidence when asked if he felt nervous about walking out in
King Eric's realm.
``It will be my first time at Old Trafford, but I've played against Real Madrid
in the Bernabeu, against Barcelona in the Nou Camp, and Milan at the San
Siro,'' he said. ``So I don't think playing at Old Trafford will be a problem,
although I expect I'll get a few boos from the United fans because I'm the
second Frenchman in England, after Eric Cantona.''
Keegan is likely to stick with the side on duty at the weekend - with Philippe
Albert consigning the unfortunate John Beresford to the bench - although after
toying with a 3-4-3 formation against Forest, the manager indicated he would
revert to a more orthodox 4-4-2.
By contrast, the 3-1 defeat at Leeds on Sunday meant Ferguson's outfit have now
gone five games without a win, and the manager's injury problems are mounting
up.
Steve Bruce's damaged hamstring means he will almost certainly join central
defensive partner Gary Pallister on the sidelines. After the disastrous attempt
to counter the thrust of Tony Yeboah - a player comparable to Les Ferdinand -
with Paul Parker at Elland Road, the manager faces a dilemma.
David May seems likely to return, but Ferguson is pondering his options with
French trialist William Prunier, Gary Neville - whose brother Philip could come
in at left-back with Dennis Irwin switching flanks - and Roy Keane all possible
choices.
Ferguson, who admits his side simply must win, also awaits news of Ryan Giggs'
foot injury. His biggest hope will surely be that Andy Cole's strike against
Leeds will be the perfect morale-booster before the #7m man's first game
against his former club.
``Andy looked as if he could score all game on Sunday,'' said Ferguson. ``Every
time the ball went near him there was a smell of goals off him, which was very
refreshing.
``He's had his bad spell, but he had five strikes at goal on Sunday, all on
target, with a firm, crisp strike to score the goal. Andy's all about scoring
goals and hopefully that will get him off on a run now.''
Just a dozen or so miles north of Old Trafford, Bolton will be looking to build
on their first away point of the season - at Tottenham - when they take on a
bullish Leeds side.
Bolton's White Hart Lane heroics could not prevent them losing yet more ground
at the bottom and Dutchman Richard Sneekes, an early substitute for Andy Todd,
could make his first start in nine games.
Leeds have midfielder Carlton Palmer suspended so South African
internationalist Lucas Radebe, on the bench against Manchester United, may step
in nine months after undergoing major knee surgery.

THE weather dealt racing a massive blow yesterday with all 10 meetings on the
British mainland abandoned, the first time for 33 years that a complete Boxing
Day programme had been wiped out by the elements.
Prospects for the rest of the week are grim with the Welsh National, feature
event at the Chepstow meeting, joining Wetherby, Leicester and Edinburgh on
today's casualty list.
Clerk of the course at the Welsh track, Rodger Farrant, said: ``The stewards
inspected the course this afternoon and had no alternative but to abandon the
meeting. Parts of the course are still frozen and the overnight weather
forecast held out no prospect of improvement.''
However, the Welsh National may not have been lost. Last season's race was
transferred to Newbury after the Chepstow meeting was abandoned and another
switch could be in the offing.
``We're not going to do anything today, but will begin to look at it
tomorrow,'' said Rob Hartnett, spokesman for Corals.
Kempton's King George VI Tripleprint meeting was the last of the Boxing Day
fixtures to fall, with clerk of the course Michael Webster abandoning the
meeting at 11.40 after three previous morning checks.
Hopes of staging the feature race at today's scheduled meeting looked bleak
when Webster said: ``The forecasters predict it will be a little colder tonight
with temperatures dropping even to minus eight degrees.''
An early inspection is scheduled this morning at the Sunbury track, and if the
meeting fails to go ahead, plans are in hand to run the King George at Sandown
Park on Saturday week.
Tomorrow's prospects in Britain look grim with Taunton the only track not to
call for an inspection, and although a course spokesman gave the going as good
to soft, he also described the track as ``frozen.''
Noon inspections have been arranged at Carlisle and Stratford, with Cliff
Griggs, Plumpton's clerk of the course, scheduling an early check.
The last time all Boxing Day fixtures in Britain fell to the weather was during
the big freeze of 1962/63, when the only meeting staged between December 22 and
March 7 was at Ayr on January 5.
q THE eagerly-anticipated jumping debut of River North has been postponed until
the New Year following the abandonment of Kempton yesterday. The Peter
Savill-owned five-year-old, due to contest the Bonuspost Novice Hurdle, is now
likely to be re-routed to the Tolworth Hurdle at Sandown on January 6.
A Group 1 winner on the flat, River North could be aimed at the Champion Hurdle
if he makes his mark over the minor obstacles.
q PROMISING novice hurdler See More Business is bang on target for the
#27,000-added Challow Hurdle at Newbury on Saturday. Bridget Nicholls, wife of
trainer Paul, confirmed the gelding a definite starter should the meeting beat
the forecast heavy frost.
``He is absolutely fine and has come out of his race at Sandown in great form.
He will definitely go for the race if the meeting gets the go-ahead, but that
seems pretty unlikely at the moment, doesn't it?'' Mrs Nicholls added.

CHARLIE Swan made a remarkable recovery to rescue favourite backers yesterday
afternoon as Limerick beat the frost that obliterated the rest of the Boxing
Day programme.
Riding for the first time since injuring his right arm at Clonmel on December
8, Swan was cheered to the echo when he somehow maintained his partnership with
Go Go Gallant after a desperate mistake two out in the Holmes O'Malley &amp; Sexton
Handicap Chase.
The well-backed 7-4 favourite had jumped to the front three out and appeared
all over a winner bar a fall when he slipped going into the second last, landed
on his nose, and slithered along the ground before recovering to score by seven
lengths.
``He met it all wrong after slipping taking off, but he kept his balance, and,
luckily, the mistake did not take too much out of him. I know now that my arm
is okay again,'' said Swan.
Swan and trainer Fergie Sutherland were expected to also collect in the
featured Murphys Irish Stout Chase, but this time another favourite, Lisselan
Prince, had no answer to the power of the Danny O'Connell-trained Love The Lord.
``She is improving all the time but deserves a little break before we bring her
back with some of the good novice races in mind,'' said O'Connell.
``We were thinking of bringing her to Uttoxeter in March for the final of the
Tattersalls Mares Series, but she might get too much weight now.''

BASKETBALL
THE ill-fated Scottish Cup second-round tie between City of Aberdeen Leopards
and Glasgow Brightsiders will now not take place at all.
Instead, Brightsiders have been placed in the quarter-finals as Leopards were
deemed to have defaulted by not playing by the due date.
The tie should have been played by the last weekend in November, but was
rearranged for the following Saturday. It was then postponed because the clubs
could not agree a tip-off time.
They rearranged again for December 16, but no referee was available, partly due
to the Boroughmuir Invitation Tournament in Edinburgh from which Glasgow
withdrew to play the cup match.
Now the SBA has awarded the tie to Glasgow, who will be at home to Boroughmuir
at Easterhouse Sports Centre on January 21.
Glasgow are due to play Edzell Enforcers at Edzell on January 6 in their first
match in the league play-offs.
Paisley will be at home to champions Livingston Bulls in the other match of the
championship section of five with Edinburgh Burger Kings having a bye.

IT comes round with the inevitability of the demand from the Inland Revenue,
the first call of the cuckoo, a player swearing to die for a jersey, or just
swearing, the Hearts and Hibs boards promising a brighter future, or even a
future, a new Albion Rovers manager, an England team pledging to play open
rugby, and a senior athletics official vowing to rid the sport of drugs.
Yes, it's the let's have a winter sporting break time, folks. Happy
hibernation, see you in the spring.
The calls to shut down the whole of outdoor sport in Britain are loud, yet
varied. There are those who would retire from the action as soon as the nights
draw in; it often becomes windy and wet in November which reduces the skill
factor so evident in all our games. Pause for thought.
But Christmas, indeed the whole festive season, brings the campaign to a
hysterical height. Give our lads a break over the holidays, Mr Scrooge, let
them go home and sit round the fireside - the television would be more accurate
- with Tiny Tim. Please don't send them out in the cold. Bah. Humbug!
I've seen two rugby matches in the past week and I bet the players would not
have missed either of them in exchange for a mound of mince pies.
Ask Master Peter Phillips, who made his debut for the Scottish Schools against
France on Friday, whether he would rather have been at Balmoral than
Murrayfield.
It wasn't a great game, but it was a grand family occasion - considerably more
fun than slumping in the armchair - in which mums, dads, sisters, brothers were
all encouraged to join in. But some poor boy might have broken an ankle or an
arm and spoiled his Christmas.
Yes, he might. And it could have happened just as easily ski-ing in the
Cairngorms, falling off a sledge in the local park or walking on frozen
pavements. We can't all join the Cotton Wool Club.
My second match was the Christmas Eve South v Glasgow district encounter, which
was switched from Selkirk to Murrayfield. This finished 23-5 in the Borderers'
favour and was probably the most entertaining game in the district championship
so far.
There were no complaints from Scotland wing Craig Joiner, who helped himself to
two tries, nor from Craig Chalmers, who looked a much more commanding figure
than of late. Glasgow scrum half Cammy Little did his prospects no harm either.
Indeed, the only moan I heard was from the Stirling County captain, Kevin
McKenzie. He was upset that the North and Midlands clash with Edinburgh on
Friday had had to be postponed.
The SRU are taking some stick for staging the district competition at this
time. I think that is unfair. Bad weather can appear at any time and there is
no evidence at all that the players hate turning out during the festive period.
Quite the reverse. I was due yesterday at the Edinburgh Academicals v Edinburgh
Borderers fixture at Raeburn Place which fell to frost like the rest. Now
Borderers are an invitation club, they only play 11 games a year, and the
reward for turning out, no matter who you are, is no more than a few beers and
a good nosh.
Yet, on Boxing Day they still managed to field a side sprinkled with caps.
Their secretary, Malcolm Murray, told me: ``We have some very loyal members and
lots of guys who just love taking part.
``The Boxing Day fixture is our biggest of the year and always attracts a good
crowd. One man even phoned from Gala to find out if the game was on.''
Exactly. What the moaning minnies do not realise is that games like this are
part of the festive season, that it brings people, families, out of the house
to see friends, enjoy a match and even a jar or two.
The footballers who were happiest yesterday were ones who got on the park. Just
ask the Celtic players if they enjoyed sitting it out.
There were hundreds of frustrated owners, trainers and jockeys throughout the
country as the Boxing Day card was decimated. And what a groan went up when the
big Kempton meeting, with the King George VI Chase, finally got the
thumbs-down. For this is another British sporting institution - who in the name
of Desert Orchid would want it run in April?
That is the other serious point. If there is to be a festive shut-down what is
to happen to the present fixtures?
Is rugby to begin in August? That will go down well with the wives. Is football
to become a summer sport? Would National Hunt racing not be much more
dangerous, for men and horses, on baked courses? Let us accept that this was
just a very cold year and continue to enjoy the sporting festivities.
What would you like to do, I inquired of my four-year-old grandson, on
Christmas morn? ``Get out on my bike and play football,'' he replied.
There's hope.

HOCKEY
IN THE present weather conditions, genuine winter sports like indoor hockey
come into their own but the Scottish Hockey Union is repeatedly accused of just
playing lip service to the game, even although it puts the more traditional
outdoor hockey in the shade when it comes to staging international events.
Insights Menzieshill, apart from maintaining a high quality of hockey, also
keep the sport in the limelight with their annual tournament, which begins this
afternoon at the Dick McTaggart Sports Centre in Dundee.
Maureen Golden and her band of workers have again put together a high-class
field, with the presence of English champions Old Loughtonians, the North
American select side Dita Travellers, and the Scottish Under-21s, as well as
Torbrex Wanderers, Touche Ross Gordonians, Bett Inns, and, of course, the
Scottish champions, Menzieshill.
Old Loughtonians will enhance the level of competition, while the participation
of Dita Travellers again emphasises the great commitment of their captain Peter
Jones to indoor hockey.
The former US captain is now prevented from competing in the Scottish league
because of the introduction of new rules which prevent the involvement of
foreigners. Not to be outdone, Jones has put together the Dita Travellers, from
players in Canada and the States, for a 10-day tour to Britain, starting with
the Menzieshill event.
There will, of course, be considerable interest in the Scottish Juniors. They
are using the tournament as part of their build-up to the finals of the
European Under-21 Championship in Zurich. With half of the 12-player squad
competing regularly for Indespension Western, they also will provide sterling
opposition.
Menzieshill will go into the three-day tournament on their own patch with a
full-strength squad, including a fit again John Christie, and so will be
expected to retain the trophy.
Scottish Under-21 squad: Derek Stark, Graham Joyce, Richard Forsyth, Stuart
McMorrow, Ewan Miller, Vishal Marwaha (all Indespension Western), Andrew
Balchin, James Burns (both Grange), Lawrence Docherty (MIM), Stefan Jachnick
(Touche Ross Gordonians), Alan Ralph (Ciba Kelburne), Mark McMahon (Pender
Uddingston).
Today's order of play: Insights Menzieshill v Bett Inns (4.15); Dita Travellers
v Torbrex Wanderers (5.10); Touche Ross Gordonians v Old Loytonians (6.05).

FA PREMIERSHIP
VINNIE Jones was sent off for the eleventh time in his career in Wimbledon's
win against his old club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge yesterday. The 2-1 victory
was Wimbledon's first in 15 Premiership starts but, with the league's top sides
out of action yesterday, Jones ensured he would again be hogging the headlines
for all the wrong reasons.
The transfer-listed Welsh inter-nationalist was given his marching orders after
55 minutes when he lunged into Dutch man Ruud Gullit from behind for his second
bookable offence. But the visitors were 2-1 up and held on to win - as they did
when Jones was banished in their last victory against Liverpool in early
September!
Chelsea took the lead after 11 minutes through Romanian Dan Petrescu, who was
also on the receiving end of a Jones clattering for his trouble. But two
headers in four minutes from Robbie Earle and Efan Ekoku put Wimbledon 2-1 in
front.
Dean Holdsworth had a chance to steady 10-man Wimbledon's nerves with a
spot-kick after Ekoku was brought down midway through the second half. But
Dmitri Kharine saved - and Holdsworth was pulled off within five minutes.
The Premiership's top two, Newcastle and Manchester United, had a day off
before today's showdown at Old Trafford, and third-placed Liverpool's game at
Aston Villa was called off hours before kick-off because of a frozen pitch at
Villa Park. The weather also ruled out Coventry's game at West Ham.
But Tottenham failed to take their chance to go second when they were held to a
goalless draw at Southampton.
There was little festive cheer for a crowd of 15,238 at The Dell as Spurs
keeper Ian Walker was not called upon to make a save, while opposite number
Dave Beasant was stretched into action only once, when Teddy Sheringham shot
straight at him in the last five minutes.
After 10 games, Gerry Francis's side have still not lost away - but a win
yesterday would have been priceless.
QPR's mini-revival ended at Highbury, where a 38,000-plus crowd saw Paul Merson
grab two second-half goals in a 3-0 victory for Arsenal.
Ian Wright had scored the first a minute before half-time to put the Gunners on
their way to their first victory in five Premiership matches - and their first
against their London rivals since April 1991.
It was a dream first league start for Adrian Clarke, who helped create both
Merson's goals. But QPR plunged back into relegation trouble after beating both
Bolton and Aston Villa before Christmas.
Middlesbrough, needing victory at Everton to move up to second, suffered a 4-0
mauling at Goodison Park.
Andrei Kanchelskis, who chose to join Everton in the close season rather than
link up with former Manchester United team-mate Bryan Robson at Middlesbrough,
was the inspiration behind the victory.
Kanchelskis scored one and set up one of Graham Stuart's two goals while Craig
Short also netted in Boro's heaviest defeat of the season.
Nottingham Forest ended Sheffield Wednesday's recent revival with a 1-0 victory
at the City Ground, Jason Lee grabbing the sixth minute winner.
Later last night, Alan Shearer kept up his amazing Ewood Park scoring record to
help Blackburn to a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Shearer had found the target in all of Rovers' previous nine home league games
this season and he needed just 11 minutes to maintain that record, slotting
home from 20 yards for his twenty-fourth goal of the season, his ninety-ninth
in the Premier League.
Blackburn's other goal, five minutes after the break, came from England
midfield player David Batty, who unleashed a right foot shot which screamed
into the top corner for his first goal for the club since signing from Leeds 26
months ago.

THE mid-life crisis is not going according to plan. The new year brings what
friends and alleged well-wishers persist in calling ``the Big Four Oh''
(whatever happened to the Big Three Nine?), but it's hard to summon up a decent
sense of impending doom.
This could well be mistaken for late-blooming maturity, the equanimity,
perhaps, of an individual who has learned at last that you are only as old as
you feel, that age brings its own rewards, that life is what you make it, and
other such consolatory tripe. Somehow I don't think so.
Forty I could live without, it is true. Left to my own devices I would shuffle,
without even passing ``Go'', directly to 41, if only to avoid any and all of
the appalling ``surprise'' parties soon-to-be-former friends may, entirely at
their own risk, be planning.
Policy statements on this subject have already been issued and fair warning
given: proceed at your peril.
But that doesn't mean the columnist has been pitched into a slough of despond
by the sound of ticking clocks, the thought of chances missed, days wasted, and
deadlines for dazzling achievement overlooked. Far from it.
If there is a real problem with this entirely trivial anniversary it is the
embarrassing absence of proper angst.
This seems hardly fair. I had taken it as read that half the point of being 40
was the chance it allowed to wallow in bleak depression, to fret over human
frailty, to worry about flab, money, responsibilities, politics, the planet,
and why no-one seems capable of writing a decent pop song any more. To grow up,
in other words.
Yet thus far there's no sign, not even a flicker, of honest despair.
In fact - and this may be the truly worrying part - the list of things about
which it seems impossible to care less grows by the day, exponentially, like a
vast trivia quiz in which every question is a trick one.
This makes life harder for the humble pundit than you can know.
Consider, if nothing else, the prose liable to ensue. The brief but peerless
response ``Who cares?'' is not, take it from me, quite what editors are looking
for when the condition of, say, the royal marriage is to be discussed.
Who cares? is a good question none the less, and one that ought to be
compulsory for all those mature, 40-something professionals who earn their
bread from being professionally upset, active, interested, caring, or worried.
The world may be in a bad way, but it always was. That is not, in itself, the
point.
There are things worth worrying about, of course, but only a few about which
anything useful can then be said. A sense of proportion - meaning a sense of
relative values and scale - is the only weapon we have.
So when did you last see it in action? Public concern over the Prince of Wales
is a case in point, in fact.
The tricky constitutional issue involved in an acceptable future designation
for Camilla Parker-Bowles aside (Trollop-in-Waiting? Floozy to the Royal
Bedchamber? Bit on the Side by Appointment?), I defy any sane person to explain
what interest is left to be squeezed from this pulped fiction.
Yet half the world could burn and space would still be found on the front pages
for a snap of Charles shooting something small and harmless.
Thousands could be homeless and millions unemployed (ah yes, so they are) and
our media would be striving for a balanced portrayal of each party's
deeply-felt views (as seen on the righteous BBC) on why it is all someone
else's fault. Britain might be most of the way down the tubes but you, citizen,
will be the last to hear.
It is no accident. There is a huge and growing gulf between the ``news''
allowed the public - all that stuff we mature adults are daily told to worry
about - and what actually happens and matters. They keep it all hid, kid, and
they do it on purpose.
The media's agenda - all those spurious rows, passing scares, forgettable
scandals, and irrelevant controversies - is the modern version of bread and
circuses, the perfection of distraction. The things we are invited to worry
about are rarely the things we should be worrying about, and the chief among
these, paradoxically, is how information itself is controlled.
And am I not, even as I write, a part of all this? Up to a point, Lord Copper,
only up to a point.

THE Herald report on the Dunfermline-Airdrie match (Dec. 18) by Douglas
Campbell has again shown a recurring media-led attack on Alex McDonald and his
team.
As an Airdrie fan I am sure some will take this as more partisan whining, but I
do consider my views to be objective, in particular in relation to this match
and absurd match report.
Airdrie played Campbell's beloved Pars out of the match for long periods with
Anthony Smith and Paul Harvey showing delightful football skills. Harvey
continued this into the second half before being kicked out of the game by
Dunfermline defenders and a referee whose decisions left both teams wondering
what was going on.
The only criticism that could be levelled at Airdrie was lack of penetration up
front.
As to Airdrie's cup record, over the past five years not only did they reach
two Scottish Cup finals but lifted the B&amp;Q Cup and made numerous other
semi-final appearances.
I am sick and tired of the ``well they don't let you play against them''
routine. Who does? The media ought to concentrate on the opposition's lack of
skill to break Airdrie down, as surely Airdrie are not responsible for other
teams shortcomings.
The majority of Airdrie fans back Alex McDonald's techniques and management
style.
Robert Hamilton,
20 Inverdale Avenue,
Airdrie.

FOR those who live their lives according to the Wildian maxim ``I can resist
everything except temptation'', this is a troublesome time. Temptation lurks
behind every pub, fridge, and bedroom door in the season of frolics, fun, and
fattening foods. A mischievous voice on our shoulder whispers ``moderation is a
virtue but it's bloody boring'', and your notion of pulling in the reins means
abiding by H.L Mencken's advice, ``I've made it a rule never to drink by
daylight and never to refuse a drink after dark''.
Now that Christmas is over and accounted for, we're girding our loins and our
livers for Hogmanay, traditionally the favoured feast of Scotland. But while we
are still bang in the middle of a period of excess and reckless behaviour - the
time when even the frostiest of maiden aunts tends to giggle, defrost, and have
one Advocaat and lemonade too many - it's becoming tinged with a slight
foreboding, with the knowledge that pleasures have to be paid for, that all
indulgences, be they epicurean or carnal, have to be squared with a day of
reckoning.
Because fast on the heels of the hedonism of Hogmanay comes the gravitas of New
Year's Day, a strange chilly day, whatever the temperature, when we have to
steel ourselves to all the terrifying promise of a fresh year. Are we up to the
challenge?
New Year's Day offers us the ultimate in clean slates, with desk diaries as yet
unblemished by all those irksome appointments which may or may not be
cancelled. The coming year presents an exhilarating vista of 365 days bursting
with unexplored potential. But no matter the strength of our determination to
make the most of this opportunity, in our heart of hearts we know it will be a
downhill slide. As usual, as the year advances we will careen, with
ever-increasing speed, away from our good intentions.
Mine are always the best intentions. I'm a sucker for new year resolutions
which is a bit pathetic considering I'm the sort of person who believes Resolve
is something you purchase at the chemist's the morning after the night before
to make the devils dancing on your eyelids disappear. Unfortunately, as diehard
addicts of Weightwatchers can testify, willpower ain't for sale. You can't buy
it in handipacks in Boots, more's the pity.
Six years ago, as Robbie Coltrane and Glasgow welcomed in the new year at
George Square, I headed off north with a friend to taste a traditional Scottish
Hogmanay in Ullapool. It didn't quite work out that way. We ended up dancing on
the breakfast bar of a Nigerian trawler with two cute Frenchmen, a middle-aged
Aussie couple, a strange Englishman, and a dozen worse-for-wear Nigerians,
failing to hear Big Ben's bells on a tiny, tinny radio belonging to one of the
fisherman. But that's another story and I don't know y'all well enough to share
it.
The next morning my mate and I stumbled through the fog of a hung-over blur to
embark on a refreshing new year's morning hike. We pulled on woollies and
boots, packed some hair of the dog, and rushed out into the dawn. Well, OK, it
was almost midday but so unusually early for us it felt like dawn. Two hours
later we sat in a sheltered cove a few miles outside Ullapool, gazed out at the
water, and gulped on freezing tins of lager and air so fresh it was almost
frisky. Then we made ambitious plans.
That New Year's Day sense of the world being your oyster is exacerbated when
you are in the middle of nowhere and everything is clean and glistening with
frost. As my lungs filled with the finest oxygen my heart filled with grandoise
ambitions. Fuelled with good Scottish air and good Scottish booze I made bold
declarations.
Nineteen ninety would be the year when I would untap my fountain of promise. I
would know no limits. My career would rocket into the media stratosphere. I
would write a book, nay, a play, nay, a Hollywood screenplay, oh, what the
heck, all three. I would learn how to drive. I would buy a car. Never mind the
fact that I couldn't afford even the lessons; that Hollywood cheque would take
care of all that. I would buy a sports car and a pair of Raybans.
My confidence would increase and my dress size would shrink - deploying my
euphemistic avoidance of the dreaded word, diet. My wardrobe would no longer be
all black but my bank balance would be. I'd do volunteer work at an old folks'
home and discreetly keep it a secret from everyone I knew. I'd be kind to
children and animals and be a stricter vegetarian - no more sneaking the fly
party-sized sausage roll at buffet functions.
I was convinced I'd achieve all this and more. In fact, I was so convinced I
wanted to head straight back to Glasgow to put it all in motion. The only thing
that stopped me was the next half a dozen cans of lager we consumed. And the
fact that I was stranded in Ullapool at the whim of my mate as I couldn't drive.
I was practically buzzing, I was so high on hope. I was completely deluded.
Thank God you can't sue yourself for breach of promise. Because, of course, I
didn't keep any of my new year resolutions. Not even the relatively
inconsequential ones - like always cleaning off my make-up before going to
sleep, or always washing out the coffee mugs before the onset of that green
mouldy stuff that floats in top.
The very memory of the resolutions dwindled away as the months rolled by. The
occasional reminders - those naughty sausage rolls, that irritatingly empty
file on the computer named ``creative'', mascara stains on pillow cases that no
amount of super-strength Persil could ever shift - caused slight twinges of
conscience, pangs of regret.
Ah well, never mind. There's one advantage in not keeping those 1990
resolutions. I don't have to dream up new ones for 1996. I'm already digging
out Hollywood agents' phone numbers and eyeing up sports cars. But not a black
one. Well, it simply wouldn't go with a new wardrobe.

INVERNESS-based economics consultant Tony Mackay will soon be swopping the cold
climate of Inverness for the tropics.
For Mr Mackay has been head-hunted by the Government of Papua New Guinea, where
he will be a key adviser to the Government during the next five years.
An authority on the oil industry, Mr Mackay does regular studies for BP and
Shell and will be sharing his expertise with leading Papua New Guinea
politicians and civil servants.
He will be helping them to get the maximum benefits from Papua New Guinea's own
promising, but little-tapped, oil and gas reserves, which are dwarfed by
multi-billion pound deals in neighbouring Indonesia and Australia .
It is the biggest contract that his firm, Mackay Consultants, has landed in its
ten-year history.
Mackay Consultants, which has economists working in its offices in Stirling and
Brussels, as well as its Inverness headquarters, will be hiring extra staff for
the contract.
The contract is being funded by the World Bank, and Mr Mackay will be spending
six months based at the capital Port Moresby each year for the next five years.
Mr Mackay, whose family comes from Wick, Caithness, said: ``It will be a most
exciting challenge. I will be giving them advice on on all aspects of their oil
and gas policies, including the terms to be drawn up for new licences to
attract the maxiumum interest from the world's oil companies, while protecting
local interests.''

SCOTTISH Television prides itself on its lean and efficient news machine with a
thrusting young staff at the cutting edge of information and technology. Some
people say it is also very cheap employing weans just out of school to do the
news.
But their rivals were impressed last week at the latest innovation by Scottish
TV. Rival news gatherers at last weekend's re-enactment of a murder in
Kilmarnock were somewhat stunned to see the Scottish TV camera person shoot an
interview with the detective in charge. The difference was that a spokesperson
from Strathclyde police information department was asking the questions on
behalf of Scottish TV.
Well, why not. Just cut out the reporter, that awkward journalist between the
PR department and the interviewee. We wonder what Gus MacDonald, a Glasgow boy
who made his name as a robust investigative reporter on World in Action, would
make of that. Perhaps he should ask Angus J MacDonald, chairman-elect and chief
executive of Scottish TV.
Every little helps
THE Scottish work ethic is alive and well. As evidence we produce Mr Archie
Norman, chief executive of Asda supermarkets. When he is not at his desk or
boardroom table, Mr Norman is to found in one of his many corner shops stacking
shelves.
``He's got us at it too,'' says his PR chief Jennie Cropper when the Diary
enquired about her boss's habit.
Could we have a comment from the boss? ``Don't know where he is. He drops in at
any store he fancies and starts piling up tins,'' said Ms Cropper.
This is an attitude which could usefully be adopted by other leaders of
industry. In fact I have decided to allow Liam Kane, chief executive of The
Herald, to write the Diary over the new year.
Planning ahead
WE are indebted to the horoscope column of the magazine Good Housekeeping for
the advance warning to those of a Virgo disposition that in 1996: ``Uranus will
bring unexpected changes in your working life, which could result in sudden
windfalls.'' See Uranus, see wind?
Now you know
THE Diary does its level best to avoid the super information highway. But more
than one person has been on-line to bring to our attention the bit on the
Internet called FTP. No, the Pope (whom God preserve) is not involved. FTP is
an acronym for file transfer protocol.
Stand by our Dan
LIKE the abattoirs who extract the last brain cell of the cow for use in Scotch
pies, the Diary lets nothing go to waste. Thus we offer the thoughts of one
Josh Billings who writes to us from Los Angeles on the subject of BSE: ``Was
Desperate Dan an original victim of mad cow pie disease? Of immense strength
but unco-ordinated and scared shitless of his mother, could he be the new hero
for the late 1990s? We could talk a deal with Disney: Desperate Dan - The
Movie.''
Get to the point
THERE is this chap called Ewan Cameron in the Glasgow office of Ryden the
property people who keeps sending the Diary sundry sweetmeats in a pathetic
attempt to promote an office block which he is trying to let. First he
delivered a plain loaf, claiming their building was ``the best thing since
sliced bread''.
He followed this up with a miniature of whisky and a lump of coal, inviting us
to be their first foot.
Now he has sent us a slice of toast of a dubious sell-by date and a jar of
Auchentoshan whisky-flavoured marmalade to toast the property. We must advise
Mr Cameron that while his ruses are entertaining, us chaps at the Diary have
much more serious issues to discuss, even at this time of year.
PS - When is the champagne opening?
Only joking
MORE sustenance through the post. Dundee, the city of Discovery, sends us a
dram and a wee slice of their eponymous cake. The downside (there is no such
thing as a free lunch) is that they also send the Dundee factpack.
This factpack includes a section entitled 12 things you didn't know about
Dundee - which doesn't quite match the efforts of this very Diary which once
compiled 800 interesting facts about Clootie City or whatever name is your
preference for the City by the Silvery Tay.
Fact No.1 is that ``Dundee is the sunniest city in Scotland with an average of
3.7 hours of sunshine every day''. This brings to mind the famous Dundee
expression, ``Ah doubt it''.
We are more prepared to believe fact No.4 that ``Dundee is investigating
providing school pupils with nut-free school meals'', but we fear it may be too
late. And fact No.5 that Dundee has more detached homes than the UK average.
After all, who would want to live right next door to someone from Dundee?
Fact No.10 - ``Dundee had the first ring road in Britain'' - is hardly
surprising given that the first prerequisite for a good night out in Clootie
City is finding the road out of town.
Another interesting fact. Dundee lies beneath its very own volcano, the Law
hill. It's extinct, unfortunately.
(Editor's note - only someone who is so fond of Dundee would be allowed to get
away with so many insults about the place.)

THE soundtrack of the movie biography of Carlo Broschi, the renowned eighteenth
century castrato singer known as Farinelli, posed a big problem for the sound
engineers.
The early castrati, who were the pop stars of their day, commanding big fees
and celebrity status, came to Italy from Spain in the middle of the sixteenth
century. Writings of the time describe their big muscular physiques, abundant
stamina and the extraordinary lung power which enabled them to perform
astonishing feats of vocal athleticism. The castrati sang the soprano parts in
the Sistine Chapel, where the Catholic Church forbade the presence of women.
Some found lucrative employment at the Medici Court in Florence and a few, like
the Neapolitan Farinelli two centuries later, became opera divas especially in
the Pontifical States and the kingdom of Naples where women were banned from
performing in theatres. The last castrato (and the only one who survives in a
scratchy old recording), Alessandro Moreschi `L'angelo di Roma', died in 1922
and the gory practice of castrating boy sopranos thankfully died with him. So
for film-maker Gerard Corbiau, there was no question of a quick snip.
Farinelli performed the works of his brother, Riccardo Broschi, and of his
mentor Nicola Porpora whose company rivalled Handel's in worldwide fame. All
three composers are featured on this award-winning film soundtrack in which the
powerful and hypnotic sound of Farinelli, spanning the castrati's normal range
of three-and-a-half octaves, actually belongs to two singers: the countertenor
Derek Lee Ragin and the soprano Ewa Malas-Godlewska, whose voices have been
electronically melded.
Ragin recorded his part in Amsterdam and Malas-Godlewska recorded the higher
notes beyond his reach from Switzerland, where she was working. Then the tapes
were sent to IRCAM, Pierre Boulez's sound laboratories at the Georges Pompidou
Centre in Paris, and a musical ``map'' was made of the harmonics before a final
``Farinelli'' voice was blended electronically. It sounds totally convincing,
full of warmth and colour, with hardly a hint of any ``synthesized'' process or
digital fusions, and if you can't catch the elegant film (the blood bath
doesn't last long) the soundtrack Farinelli Il Castrato gives a vivid enough
flavour of Baroque brilliance to be enjoyed independently.
The surprise hit of this year's London Film Festival, Angels &amp; Insects, is a
dark tale of Victorian repression based on the fascinating novella by Booker
prize-winning author, A S Byatt.
An impoverished Northern anthropologist is trapped by marriage in the decaying
ambience of the bizarre Alabaster family, in a world which is beginning to
recognise the impact of Darwin's revolutionary ideas.
In Angels &amp; Insects the Balanescu Quartet, occasionally augmented by guest
players to become the Luminitza Chamber Orchestra, not only plays the score: it
even makes a cameo appearance as musicians in a key dance sequence Waltz.
Balanescu had always intended that the commission should be more than a side
project and after the film recordings the musicians reconvened in the Abbey
Road Studios to develop the music to a point where it could work on its own as
a theme and variations. Even without Mark Rylance and Patsy Kensit as lovers in
a tangled web of mystery and deceit, Kristin Scott Thomas as the creator of the
artificial ant-paradise, and a strong cast that also includes Anna Massey, the
music plays out the story's intricate relationships between the human
characters, in the natural world, and between the angels and the insects.

Lex Gold, director general, Scottish Chamber of Commerce.
TAKING a break from the excitement of running a business is a great way of
recharging the batteries . . . but for some of us, the festive season can
become a little tedious as we feel that nagging itch to get back into harness.
Give yourself a break. Pick up a book and relax. But which book? Most of us
have our favourites, to be read and re-read and savoured.
Today the review elbows the Business Books to the edge of the shelf and invites
some of its regular contributors to share their thoughts on the lighter
literature that occupies them occasionally. Like all Christmas crackers, there
may be a few surprises in store:
Black Sea by Neal Ascherson, charts the rise and fall of ancient cities, proud
tribes and evil empries. Ascherson wanders through the debris of current
calamities, guided by a wonderful sense of history and journalistic skills that
border on the uncanny. Marabou Stork Nightmares by Irvine Welsh, led me back to
his earlier books Acid House and Trainspotting - and the conclusion that while
the drugs of choice may change, much remains constant in Scottish life.
I have just read Michael Montignac's Dine Out and Lose Weight for the second
time, to reconfirm and enjoy again the knowledge that the worst excess when
dining out is to eat the bread rolls and that a glass of white wine is less
fattening than potatoes or white rice. This book explodes many myths about the
food we eat.
John McClelland, world vice president, Digital Equipment Corporation.
I haven't seen the film . . . but I have read, and thoroughly enjoyed, The
Bridges of Madison County by Robert James Waller. I also re-read The Master of
Ballantrae by R L Stevenson, and can recommend Captain Corellis Mandolin by
Louis de Bernieres.
Nigel Clifford, chief executive, Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
Once you accept the key principle of animals talking to one another The Wolves
of Time by William Horwood proves to be an epic account (first in a trilogy) of
the last few wolves scattered across Europe making their slow and frequently
painful journey back to their ancestral homeland. Set against a background of
environmental pollution and human conflict, this book is much more apocalyptic
than the usual animal tale and has a powerful bite which others in the genre
frequently lack.
Bill Furness, BT national manager for Scotland.
I am cheating . . . the best book I expect to have read all year is one of my
Christmas presents! To Lie with Lions by Dorothy Dunnett is the sixth in her
medieval adventure Niciolo series. Give yourself another treat and read my
all-time favourite - the ``Crawford or Lymond'' series.
Aileen Beattie, director of auditing, Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland.
On a recent flight to the Far East, I thoroughly enjoyed John Fowles' Daniel
Martin. It was a well-constructed novel, and I was left with a pleasurable
feeling of regret on reaching the last page.
Authors who kiss and tell are not really my bag. However, when the story
tellers are Lady Thatcher in The Downing Street Years and John Cole in As It
Seemed to Me that is something else. In the course of describing some of the
most momentous events of recent decades, Cole's inscrutable TV mask of
impartiality falls away. With Lady Thatcher, as always, you get what you see.
The Thatcher version of events benefited from the author actually having been
present on the key occasions and as such, has the greater credibility. At
least, that is how it seemed to me!
I am an addictive reader of Napoleonic naval fiction (and history), having been
brought up on C S Forrester's Hornblower stories, which still repay a second
read. By far the best of his successors in Patrick O'Brian, whose stories of
Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin do so much than tell a sea story. His latest is
The Commodore but spend some time reading the whole sequence, from Master and
Commander.
If like me you are looking to escape over the holiday break from the world of
work, why not set yourself the task of reading the Isaac Asimov ``foundation''
series - seven books in all which deal with another time, another place in
which the only thing recognisable is human nature! If you are looking for
something less demanding and funny, how about Drop The Dead Donkey 2000, a very
clever adaptation of the Channel 4 comedy series which I guarantee will be more
than watching reruns of 1970s comedy shows on the TV over the festive period.
Philip H Miller, managing director, Miller Developments.
Julian Critchley's dry, self depreciating humour is infectious. A Bag Of Boiled
Sweets is sharp, pitchy, illuminating and packed with political insight. He has
occupied a unique place at Westminster for more than two decades, and appeals
to that basic human instinct to read gossip about the all-powerful. Who could
not like a man who disarmingly quotes Orwell on autobiography: ``A man who
gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life, when viewed
from the inside, is simply a series of defeats.''
Mike Shaw, commissioning producer, BBC Radio Scotland.

A FORMER Bank of England official today called for a complete overhaul of the
UK's financial services regulatory system.
Mr Michael Taylor, formerly of the Bank's supervision division, criticised by
politicians over the collapse of Barings and the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, said the present system had become unwieldy and ineffective.
Writing in a paper published by the Centre for the Study of Financial
Innovations, a non-profit think-tank, he proposed the establishment of two new
commissions to take over supervision of the industry from the Bank, the
Securities and Investment Board, the City of London's top watchdog, and other
regulatory bodies.
Under his twin peaks strategy, there would be a Financial Stability Commission
which would have responsibility for the soundness of the financial system in
all its aspects - banks, building societies, investment, insurance and
wholesale financial markets.
A Consumer Protection Commission would oversee conduct of business in the
retail markets.
The two commissions would be separate and independent but could co-operate
closely and share a number of commissioners.
If they came into conflict, disputes could be resolved by the Treasury, said Mr
Taylor.
The paper said the new structure would clarify the aims of financial regulation.
At present, it was not clear, for example, whether the Bank's main role was to
promote financial stability or protect investors, aims which often conflicted.
Mr Taylor now runs a degree course in financial regulation at London Guildhall
University.

A SURVEY conducted by an independent research company as visitors left this
year's Royal Highland Show has confirmed the event's standing as one of the
major agricultural trade shows in Europe, writes Robert Ross.
The profile of the farmer-visitors showed that half of them came from farms of
more than 250 hectares. A total of 63% of all farmers who visited the show said
that they had considered purchases - mainly of machinery.
About #7.3m was actually spent at the show and decisions were taken during the
show period to spend an estimated #80m. In addition more than #3m was spent on
general purchases at the show.
The report also dispels the perception that farmers attend almost exclusively
on the first two days of the four-day show.
On the Thursday 39% of the 31,000 visitors were farmers and even on the final
day - generally regarded as a ``family day'' - 20% of the 47,600 attending were
from the farming community.
The total number of farmers and land industry professionals attending the show
has increased since the last survey, conducted in 1992.
Mr Hywel Davies, chief executive of the Royal Highland and Agricultural
Society, said: ``This is an endorsement of the society's policy of making the
show a business event, and not one only for farmers but also for others with
responsibility for managing the countryside and rural resources.'' The exit
survey also established that 72% of visitors could be classified as ``affluent,
economically active decison makers'' - cited by the RHASS as evidence that
taking trade space at the show repreented a worthwhile investment.
Visitors were generally satisfied with the standard of services provided at the
show although criticisms were made of lack of seating and signposting around
the ground. The society has plans to spend up to #16,000 resolving these
particular criticisms for the 1996 show.
Mr Hywel Davies said: ``The importance of the Highland Show as an international
market place for Scottish agriculture is confirmed by this survey.
``We will continue to work for the future of Scotland's land based industries
by improving the facilities, the content of the show and the way in which we
inform the general public about agriculture.''

CONVENIENCE stores are benefiting from the snow storms which have brought
misery to thousands of Scots.
On a like-for-like basis, Dundee-based convenience stores chain Morning Noon &amp;
Night has enjoyed an 11.5% rise in festive sales.
When the sales of the rapidly-expanding chain's most recent acquisitions were
taken into account, turnover in the week to Christmas Eve was up 32% on last
year.
Chief executive Eddie Thompson yesterday attributed the increase in sales to
poor weather conditions and the change in Scotland's Sunday licensing laws.
Because Christmas Day fell on a Sunday last year, when shops were closed,
Morning Noon &amp; Night's 25 outlets reaped festive benefit from the licensing
change for the first time this year.
In the North-east and far North of Scotland, which both had heavy snow
throughout much of last week, Mr Thompson believes that people reverted to
their local stores for items forgotten during their supermarket shopping
expeditions.

Face the music: TIM DE LISLE lists 10 ways to write a great song
PEOPLE say that everybody has a novel in them, but it seems much more likely
that everybody has a song in them. Novels are long and complicated and
effortful. Songs are short and simple and - well, if not effortless, certainly
a lot easier than novels.
While writing a great book tends to be a lot harder than writing a lousy one,
writing a great song is much like writing any other song. And there are many
different ways of doing it . . .
n Dream it
THIS is the easiest way of the lot. The only conscious effort required is
keeping a tape-recorder by the bed. One morning in 1965, Paul McCartney woke up
at his girlfriend Jane Asher's parents' flat in Wimpole Street with a tune in
his head. He called it Scrambled Eggs and the next line was ``Oh my darling
you've got lovely legs.''
The tune was so complete, he thought it must be someone else's, and sang it to
people to see if they recognised it. ``Eventually it became like handing
something into the police,'' he said. ``If no-one claimed it after a few weeks,
I would have it.'' He changed its name to Yesterday and it is now probably the
most-recorded song in history, with 2000 versions.
This sounds like a total fluke. But a few months later, at a motel in
Clearwater, Florida, the same thing happened to Keith Richards. He woke up in
the middle of the night, picked up a guitar, switched on a tape-recorder and
played the most famous riff in rock: the first five notes of (I Can't Get No)
Satisfaction. Then he went back to sleep.
n Overhear it
THIS one isn't hard either. The words to A Whiter Shade of Pale, by Procol
Harum, were written by Keith Reid. He had gone to a party given by record
producer Guy Stevens and his wife Diane in Gloucester Avenue NW1. At one point
Stevens said to Diane: ``My God you've just turned a whiter shade of pale.''
(This was to be expected in 1967.) After that, all Reid had to do was add a few
lines about light fandangos and vestal virgins, and get Gary Brooker to come up
with a variation on Bach's Air on the G-String.
n Translate it
ONE of the great ballads of the pre-rock era is Autumn Leaves, recorded by
Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and all the usual suspects. They probably wouldn't have
touched it if it had remained Les Fuilles Mortes, by Jacques Prvert. Written
in 1945, it was translated a decade later by Johnny Mercer, a Tin Pan Alley
craftsman who went on to write Moon River.
n Make a list
LIST songs make the same point again and again, with different examples.
They're easy, and fun, to write, because of all the proper names you can use.
The master of this art was Cole Porter, whose lyric for You're the Top reads
like a travel brochure: ``You're the top!/You're the Coliseum /You're the
top!/You're the Louvre Museum.''
n Ask a lot of questions
BLOWIN' in the Wind, by the young Bob Dylan, is dead simple - a folk tune, with
no bridge or middle eight. Its distinction lies in a series of nine
metaphorical questions: ``How many roads must a man walk down/Before you call
him a man?'' The only statement in the song is the answer, which, my friend, is
blowin' in the wind.
n Compose an irritating ditty and leave the rest to fate
WHEN The Sound of Music opened on Broadway, in 1959, My Favourite Things was
probably rated great only by Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, and any
surviving governess. Greatness was thrust upon it, for reasons that remain
obscure, by John Coltrane, the jazz saxophonist. He kept on recording it, and
each time it strayed further from the nursery. In the end it was not
unrecognisable as My Favourite Things, it was barely recognisable as jazz.
n Keep it simple
MOST great songs are straightforward and none more so than You Send Me by Sam
Cooke. It has only one verse, of four lines, and the chorus can't have taken
too long either: ``You send me,'' it goes, ``you thrill me. Honest you do.''
Admittedly, it helps if you have a voice as grainily gorgeous as Cooke's.
n Strike a bet
SOME of the best pop lyrics have an odd thing in common: they included one
long, incongruous, unmusical word. It's as if someone had bet the authors that
they couldn't fit the word in.
In My Funny Valentine, the word is ``unphotographical'', which the lyricist
Lorenz Hart suavely uses as a whole line, just after ``Your looks are
laughable.''
n Steer clear of rhymes
THE Stevie Wonder song most often heard in hotel bars is You Are The Sunshine
Of My Life. You won't find many rhymes in it. ``You are the sunshine of my
life,'' it goes, ``That's why I'll always be around.''
Behind the lack of rhyme is no lack of reason. The obvious rhyme for ``life''
was ``wife''. The snag was that the song was (allegedly) addressed not to the
then Mrs Wonder, Syreeta Wright, but to a backing singer called Gloria Barley -
you can hear her on You Are The Sunshine Of My Life.
n Borrow a riff, and a slogan
ONE of the few unmistakable classics of the 1990s is Smells Like Teen Spirit by
Nirvana. It's crunching riff is strangely reminiscent of More Than A Feeling by
Boston, a band as unfashionable as Nirvana were cool. Once the late Kurt Cobain
had seen a TV commercial for a deodorant called Teen Spirit, the riff soon lost
the whiff of old fart.
n All the songs discussed here are featured in Lives of the Great Songs, edited
by Tim de Lisle (Penguin, #6.99).

SYMBOLS of luxury throughout the world, France's most distinguished distilled
drinks, cognac and armagnac, are in commercial peril. This winter's rail and
public transport strikes have made it unusually difficult to supply the spirits
to shops and taken the edge off many people's appetite for celebration. But the
underlying problem is one of falling consumption at home and abroad - four
consecutive years of declining sales, linked to economic recession worldwide.
Although sales in 1994 increased a little by comparison with 1993, the
producers are afraid that foreign buyers could lose the taste for brandy if the
slump lasts.
In the autumn, brandy producers in the normally conservative areas of Cognac,
in the west of France, and Armagnac, close to the Spanish border, lobbied the
Minister of Agriculture for financial support and even took to the streets of
the town of Cognac to protest about their plight.
Government help was refused, however, and Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur
angered both local distillers and vineyard owners who provide wine for brandy,
by advising them to diversify their production.
In 1994, 147 million bottles of cognac were produced. Almost 95% worth around
#1.4 billion were exported. The United States and Canada bought nearly 28
million bottles, while the European and Asian markets absorbed 67 and 50
million respectively.
North American and British consumption of brandy has dropped by almost half
over the past eight years. Sales in Japan, where almost as much cognac is drunk
every year as in the US and Canada, have increased by around 12% during the
same period, but slumped by a quarter in Germany, another major client.
The French themselves, meanwhile, just seem to be going off brandy. Producers
blame recent legislation aimed at curbing publicity for alcohol, competition
from the lower quality, lower-priced spirits in supermarkets as well as from
distilled drinks such as whisky, vodka and gin, which are becoming increasingly
popular.
As a result, some 338 million litres of cognac, several years' production, are
having to be stored in cellars in their oak casks or, in a case of fully
matured spirit, in glass containers kept away from daylight, for the day when
sales will pick up.
Sales of armagnac, meanwhile, have dropped by 35% over the past five years.
Producers who have been forced to stock more than 22 million litres are
complaining of a vicious circle of falling consumption and the expense of long
storage, which can only increase prices.
Distillers blame wine growers for contributing to the glut by producing too
much wine. Wine growers on the other hand complained that big distillers, many
of which have been taken over by multinational companies, are more interested
in promoting foreign spirits which they import, especially whisky, at the
expense of their home-grown tipple. Everybody complains about the effect on
home consumption of heavy taxes, which represent 45% of the price of a bottle
of brandy.

She's a goer, a trier, and a doer - and she's `about 75'.
Anvar Khan catches up with Betty Paton for whom life began again at 60
I WAS alerted to the achievements of Betty Paton of Faifley via a phone call
from one of her friends, a Mary Black from Clydebank. ``She does everything,''
said Mary of her best pal. ``She was the Scottish fencing champion, she goes
canoeing, she spent last Christmas on the sands of Oban.'' Doing what?
``Surfing. And she can do 13 Eskimo rolls in a oner.'' And how old is she?
``About 75.''
There are very few ordinary people who will be remembered by so many.
Immortality is the preserve of the famous, the propagation of a life, an
official duty of the chattering classes. It's important to look at death if you
want to talk about life, especially in Betty's case. Death gets things in
perspective. Some of us would like an extra 20 years for each good deed, others
are quite happy for them to be chalked up on the big blackboard in the sky.
Betty Paton is a woman, perhaps, who thinks it unbearable that the quality of a
life lived has no bearing on the date of the great departure.
Her transition into her most active years, as an OAP, began when her mum, dad,
and husband died within 18 months of each other. She had nursed her parents in
her own home. ``It went quiet,'' she says. ``I didn't know what to do.
``I had a brother; he died five years ago. I had a sister; she was 27 when she
died. My father had cancer and my mum died from missing my father. She was
supposed to have died of old age but she was only 69.''
Some say that death is the greatest equaliser, but they're wrong. Ministers and
Priests tell you it's this journey that influences the next. But people aren't
born equal, they don't get the same opportunities or talents, they won't
equally be remembered when they've gone, and they are not equally treated when
they live or when they die. Some get big graves some get cheap ones, and, if
you are a believer, some go to heaven while others go to hell. There's a
genuine unfairness about existence and existing, all the way.
Betty says: ``When I was young, girls learned to knit and sew, go to church. I
was a Sunday School teacher, but when I went outdoors during the weekends,
church had to stop.''
The world closes in on single, elderly women. The British OAP can lead a silent
life, a trip to the local shops can span a whole day. ``I don't know why I'm so
active'' Betty pauses. ``Sometimes I think, oh, I need a stretch'' and to
illustrate she jumps up from her chair and hangs like a orang-utang from the
threshold of the kitchenette door. Betty says she's not competitive, but she
performs when she has a point to prove.
``I started competitive fencing in 1977, and that was only to justify the work
the tutor was putting in for me.'' She was 57. ``The club became good enough to
enter competitions. In fencing there is a snob factor, and our coach was a cab
driver, while other coaches were university graduates, doctors, and lawyers. We
were poo-pooed because we were working class. We came through it, but the
prejudice gave me the edge.''
Her long-term pal and voluntary media adviser, Mary Black, also told me that
when Betty decided to take up canoeing she met with a bad attitude. Something
about a ``po-faced lot from Jordanhill'' looking down on this ``wee old woman
with specs and a hearing aid''.
But Betty is a goer, a trier, and a doer. She bestows support and leadership
upon a legion of local residents and friends, organising hill-walking
expeditions from Rowardennan, to Inverbeg and Crianlarich. She is at present
studying history ``between the wars'', but the class is going to fold, she
says, because people ``keep dropping off''. At the age of 75, colleagues
``dropping-off'' is a real hazard, and there are few peers left with whom Betty
can compete. Betty likes to beat those younger than her, people of 72 for
example. She recently broke a record held by the Clydebank Ladies Swimming
League, founded many years ago, in which she was a member. She shows me her
awards. ``These are all for being the best in an age group, mine is 75-79. I
like to earn them.'' What she means is that at her age they tend to give you a
gong just for managing to turn up.
It wasn't just the effort to fill her time which propelled Betty into sporting
activity at the age of 60. She tried to be an old person. She tried ``sitting
there, in classes at the local community education centre, doing the stuff that
old people do, making dough things, making paper mache things, then the woman
in charge said, `Let's make some Christmas tree decorations now.' I thought,
`My grandchildren are over 20, I don't want this!'''
She shows me an album which records favourite events; I can see her surfing in
Bute, in a wet suit in Oban, and hanging from a wire, walking her body from one
edge of the river Orchy to the other, a vision in rubber above the rapids.
``I'm sensible about sport, I don't do bungee-jumping,'' she says, quite
seriously. ``I couldn't do parachuting now, because of my arthritic knee. I
love canoeing, but I don't do white-water rafting, my reactions are slowing
down and you need a fast reaction on water.'' She adds, ``You get a nice high
after a swimming training session though.''
But Paton inspires her friends' love and respect. When she abseiled down the
black hole stairwell of Glasgow's Hospitality Inn last month she raised #400
for Help The Aged. ``Ooh, a fortnight later I did it twice,'' she shines.
``They invited me back.'' She plans another abseil for charity down the
stairwell of Glasgow's Central Hotel on St Valentine's Day. She has no fear.
Unlike even some younger women, she doesn't see herself as prey. ``I'm not
afraid of going out at night. I've attended self-defence classes and you must
walk assertively: if you're easy meat, that's when they'll attack.''
Fit people never entertain physical vulnerability. Betty Paton does not want to
be treated as a decrepit now, as a grandmother (she has one daughter), just as
she despised it then, when it was punishment for being a girl.
``I met my husband in 1943. I was 23 and in the WAF. He was a soldier and he
was called up to India. We had to make a decision and were married in three
days. I remember the minister went to the church door and addressed the
pavement - ``Would everybody stop please?'' - and he read the bands from
there.'' Any decision worth making, you spend seconds on it rather than days.
``I would have loved to have gone abroad then too, but only nurses were
allowed. But after I retired I did ballroom and Latin American dancing, and I
got up to gold, and then I went into teaching it. With the swimming I've been
to Australia in 1986, Denmark in 1988, Paris in 1993, where I got two gold
medals.''
By the way, Betty also knits, paints, and sings. ``It's taking advantage of
what's being offered to you,'' she says. ``A lot of people hee and haw and then
it's too late.'' Then again, maybe it never really is.

I HAVE just read Ken Gallacher's article on Mark McGhee and, as an exiled
Reading supporter, I am a little bit nonplussed by his blase attitude that
``club loyalty is only for the fans.''
Does he realise that McGhee is held in contempt and regarded as a pariah by all
and sundry at Elm Park?
Once he has ground-hopped to the next club after Wolverhampton Wanderers,
enticed by more money, he may one day look back and see that, although in each
club he has indeed left a ``strong squad,'' he has also left them dazed,
confused and very, very angry by his mercenary attitude to football.
But as long as the money keeps rolling in Mr McGhee, do not worry, you can just
put up a big wall around your house and forget all about us.

GOLF
THE inaugural Southern Open championship, to be played at Southerness next
season on dates still to be confirmed, will have the Edinburgh-based Carnegie
Sports Management as a major sponsor. Neil Simpson, the PGA Scottish region's
secretary, is involved in talks with local companies, trying to enlist their
support in establishing the tournament, the first over 72 holes to be taken to
the south-west.
Although the links on the Solway Firth, where the Scottish Amateur championship
was held last summer for the second time, is the best-regarded course in the
area, the likelihood is that the tournament, in which 144 players will start
after a qualifyng round and a pro-am competition, will be taken to other
venues, as has been done annually in the long-established Northern Open.
q.IN what may be a golfing first, two Nevada golfers recorded holes-in-one on
consecutive shots. John Legarza, 60, and Tom Gabelman, 59, delivered aces on
the 162-yard, par-3 sixteenth hole last week at the Dayton Valley Country Club
using a No.5 and No.4 iron respectively.

UNDERSOIL heating is the answer to the Scottish weather, absolutely no doubt
about it. Basically, all you have to do once the system has been installed is
flip a switch or two, sit back and watch the festive movies.
The snow can tumble all night, but the players from clubs with the underground
works don't need to care. They know when they arrive next day all will be well.
The game will go on . . . unless it is scheduled for Firhill.
Partick Thistle's people arrived at their ground yesterday morning ready for
action, but recoiled in disbelief when they saw, or rather couldn't see, the
pitch. It was somewhere under four to five inches of snow.
It turned out that while the heating system had been switched on it was not
left at the proper level - times are hard in football, but surely this was not
a cost-cutting exercise - and the snow was able to settle and pack. A referee
was called in and, although the ground was soft enough underneath, there was
too much of the white stuff lying on top and Hibernian were told not to bother
leaving the capital.
``We were all very disappointed,'' said Partick Thistle secretary Robert Reid.
``The matter will be looked into.''
Oh dear, sounds like officialese for ``somebody is about to get his backside
kicked.''
Hibs manager Alex Miller might want to come through to Maryhill and punish the
culprit himself, because if the match had gone ahead he would have had at least
one of his his suspended players available for Saturday's game against Rangers
at Ibrox. Michael O'Neill's ban would have ended yesterday, but now he will
complete the punishment by watching the Rangers game from the stand.
Celtic also might be starting to worry, because two of their players, Peter
Grant and John Hughes, would have completed their three-game bans had
yesterday's match against Raith Rovers beaten the weather. Now Tommy Burns must
hope his team's match at Tynecastle goes ahead on Saturday, otherwise Grant,
who has already missed one game against Rangers because of suspension, and
Hughes will sit out out the January 3 Old Firm game at Celtic Park. Both can be
influential players and Burns will want them available.
It isn't just managers who dislike postponements, however, because club
directors also get annoyed when their home games are called off. Most clubs
need the revenue and matters are made worse when the electricity bill runs up
overnight for no useful purpose.
Thistle's match was only one of 19 games postponed over the Christmas period
and most were rescheduled yesterday for the first available midweek - Tuesday,
January 9 and the following evening - although Thistle won't benefit. Hibs have
already been booked for the satellite television game against Aberdeen at
Pittodrie on Monday, January 8.
This means Falkirk, who were supposed to play Aberdeen yesterday, also will be
idle that midweek. Their premier division match against the Dons, and also the
one between Thistle and Hibs, have been rescheduled for the following midweek,
Tuesday, January 16.
Raith Rovers' game against Celtic will be played on Tuesday, January 9, and
Hearts and Motherwell will meet on Wedneday, January 10.
The Scottish League moved quickly yesterday to reschedule games - it truly is
amazing what these people can achieve when they go to work - and in the first
division the Clydebank v Airdrie fixture, which last Saturday was postponed for
the third time, hopefully will be played on January 9. Apart from the weather
the re-arranged matches in the lower divisions could also be affected by
replays in the Tennents Scottish Cup, which begins to get serious on Saturday,
January 6.
If any of the ties that day are drawn they will, as cup-ties usually do, take
precedence over league matches and be replayed the following midweek. Other
rescheduled matches are:
First division - Airdrie v St Mirren, Clydebank v Dundee, both January 16;
Dumbarton v Dunfermline, St Johnstone v Morton, January 9.
Second division - Ayr United v Clyde, Forfar v East Fife, both January 9; Queen
of the South v Stenhousemuir, Stranraer v Berwick Rangers, both January 10.
Third division - Albion Rovers v Caley (postponed from Saturday, December 23,)
Brechin City v Alloa, Cowdenbeath v East Stirling, all January 9; Livingston v
Queen's Park, Ross County v Arbroath, both January 10.

FOLLOWING the draw in Birmingham for the finals of Euro '96, I was disappointed
to discover that only 7000 of Wembley Stadium's 70,000-plus capacity had been
allocated to supporters of Scotland for the match against the Auld Enemy on
June 15 next year.
Glen Kirton, of Euro '96, stated that Scotland are only ``one of 16 teams''
competing in the championships and, as such, would be given no special
treatment.
It would be interesting to learn how many tickets have been allocated to fans
of England, the host nation (but still only one of 16 competing teams), for the
aforementioned match.

THE only mistake I made when driving the Citroen Xantia 1.8 16-valve was to
take it to the press launch of a new car of a different make. Although it had
the benefit of being much more recently off the drawing board, the other car
could not hold a candle to the Xantia in terms of ride quality. In fact, the
difference was almost embarrassing, when it came to chatting with the rival
manufacturer's representatives.
All cars date, some more quickly than others, and some companies have
particular features of their designs which keep in the top rank while the car
in general fades in appeal. As far as its mid and upper-range models are
concerned, Citroen has been going its own individual hydro-pneumatic suspension
way for more than 40 years, and by no means all of the opposition has caught up.
There are other cars in its class which handle more sportingly, and Citroen has
never quite managed to figure out how to stop the interlinked suspension
kicking the tail up over a hump-backed bridge. But the suspension system which
was tried out in a few of the ``Maigret'' Citroens, before really coming to the
fore in the DS19, can smooth out road surface bumps and ripples like nothing
else at the Xantia's size and price.
Another feather in the Xantia's cap is that it continues to look remarkably
fresh. On many cars in its class, the critical observer can see little gauche
elements of styling, or places where unnecessary ornamentation might be
removed, but Citroen has created a simple, attractive, uncluttered Xantia line.
The company's basic engine range is fairly old, and this is another area in
which you simply cannot hold back the tide of progress. All-new engine ranges
come along very rarely, and are phenomenally expensive. It is not unheard-of
for what is fundamentally the same engine to last in production for 30 years
and more. Regular up-datings help the situation, but eventually nothing can
stop an engine feeling past its sell-by date.
Citroen's major change in 1995 was introducing 16-valve heads to the 1.8 and
two-litre Xantia models. These have made a considerable difference to the
engines' performance, economy and throttle response. The 112bhp multi-valve 1.8
will sprint a manual transmission Xantia to 60mph in 10 seconds, waft it on to
a test track 120mph, and give far better mid-range performance than the older
eight-valve, thanks to meatier and better distributed torque.
It tends to irritate some of the anti-car lobby that a more powerful engine is
often a more economical one, but better engine efficiency improves things all
round. The 1.8 multi-valve manages about 47mpg at 56mph, 38 at 75 and 27 on the
urban cycle.
While these are not class-leading figures, they are above the 1800 norm.
Showroom prices for the 1.8-litre manual transmission Xantia are #13,080 for
the LX and #14,750 for the SX which comes with ABS as standard. One feature of
the Xantia is that it is roomier inside than a glance at its apparently low
build suggests, and it has a sensible luggage volume.
The current fascia is neatly laid out, although still with that rather annoying
passenger's grab handle which cuts into shelf space. Citroen goes to far
greater pains than previously to keep down interior noise levels, and a few 400
or 500-mile motorway days proved how effective its sound-deadening work has
been. While some other drivers feel the lack of back and thigh support, my own
eccentric driving posture, which a colleague has likened to driving from the
rear seat floor, suited the Xantia well enough.

SCOTTISH champion Senga Macfie and her sister and fellow internationalist,
Helen, are set to reverse the trend by moving from London to Scotland in a bid
to further their squash careers.
The London-born pair, who played for England as juniors, have family in
Edinburgh, and are making plans to establish a base there within the next
couple of months.
While all the Scottish men have headed to England on turning professional,
Senga is convinced that the reverse turn could be just the ticket to revitalise
her career.
Once ranked as high as No.12, she has slipped one place to No.22 in the latest
world rankings, and has already made her new year resolution: to get into a
training routine that will help her regain a place in the top 16.
``In London, I have no organised practice pattern,'' she explained. ``I feel I
am just drifting along at the moment, and I reckon the change could be just
what I need to get going again.
``I know I should be higher in the world rankings. It's a case of working
harder, and getting into a routine.''
Winning her first Scottish championship earlier this month was a huge boost for
the 27-year-old, and she is now hopeful that she can make her mark in the
British National championships in Birmingham next month, an event in which she
is seeded in the 5/8 bracket.
``I want to keep playing full-time for at least another few years,'' she
continued. ``I'm sure a move to Edinburgh would be good for me, and that I
would find plenty of practice partners.''
For 25-year-old Helen, who was also a member of Scotland's European
Championship bronze medals team last season, the latter half of this year has
been ruined by glandular fever.
However, she has now been passed fully fit, although the illness forced her to
pull out of the Scottish Championships.
She also wants to make her name as a full-time player, and could make a start
to her comeback at the next Scottish Grand Prix ranking event, the Edinburgh
Sports Club Open, which takes place from January 19 to 21.

IT may seem like whistling in the dark to claim that 1995 has been a good year
for conservatives, yet I think there are sound reasons for saying so. The main
one is that nobody, but nobody, neither at home nor abroad, neither in the East
nor in the West, in any ivory tower or think-tank or assembly of the great and
good, has come up with an agenda which can match in coherence or conviction the
one which conservatives have actually set for the world in the past quarter of
the twentieth century.
Of course, conservative parties in power do have their little local
difficulties and, heaven knows, as in Britain has enough of them, most of its
own making. The fact remains that in practically all the major countries
conservatives are indeed in power.
Even where that is not strictly true, conservatives make the running. The
United States has a Democratic President, but a Republican Congress which has
taken over the direction of domestic affairs, while he wanders around the world
bringing peace to everyone. This is a commendable separation of powers, even if
it leaves Bill Clinton with nothing to say on the big issues which actually
concern Americans. But since he has nothing to say anyway, it may be all to the
good.
Where conservatives are right out, or have never been in, the same thing holds.
Ruling parties of other complexions, from Mexico to Spain to Russia to India to
New Zealand, struggle to catch up with the conservative agenda, to absorb,
master, and apply it. They roll back the state, they tear down barriers to
trade, they liberalise, they privatise.
The same thing holds even where conservatives have been around a little too
long, now grow tired, carry the millstones of their mistakes round their necks,
and so face the threat of going out. Power is sweet, and to lose it is bitter.
Still, conservatives should never mind too much, because conservatism is not
absolutist but goes along with the ebb and flow of events.
The British Conservative Party, the prime example in this category, has, after
all, been around for three centuries. In the 95 years of this century it has
been in Government for all but 30. At the end of the century - as I am sure
will be true at the end of history, too - it is seen to have been right.
Britain's great experiment during the century has been with socialism or at
least collectivism. It was a legitimate experiment, which conservatives anyway
did not oppose in every jot and tittle, and in a few respects it produced some
useful results. But overall it did not work. For its own good a complex society
must avoid placing itself in the hands of mad scientists. They will always go
too far, and ours did.
In sending them packing, Britain performed a service not only for herself but
for the world. At the global level, too, the great experiment of the twentieth
century has been at least with collectivism, and more especially with socialism
in a precisely conceived sense - all power to the state, and to the mad
scientists who worked for it or in some cases actually ran it.
Even then, going along with the ebb and flow, conservatives often gave a
hearing to what they had to say, being in the end the most reasonable of men.
If anything they were too fair and, perhaps, for longer than they should have,
they did not care to fight socialism or collectivism hard enough.
But there were always sticking points. The outstanding contribution of Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, President Ronald Reagan, and of others in the conservative
roll of honour, was to say that they should no longer be just sticking points.
They should not be a mere minimum that no democracy should give up, but a
maximum, the measure of everything else.
What were those sticking points? One was the security of the state, rather
different from the state security beloved of the mad scientists. In its
methods, not its aims, it could demand policies almost as unpleasant, however.
For Britain it meant maintaining a nuclear deterrent, occasionally even
fighting wars. But it succeeded. The deterrent deterred, foes were faced down
or if necessary beaten and now, for the first time in centuries, Britain really
has no external enemy.
A second sticking point was the freedom of the individual. If collectivism had
produced some useful results it had also exacted a price, trying to do too
much, the state did too many things badly and so it self-generated social
tension and disorder.
Then it imposed high taxes and coercive laws in a vain effort to suppress them.
By 1979 the choice was clear, either more of the same, with no guarantee of a
better outcome, or less, letting individuals do what they want rather than
being ordered about by politicians and bureaucrats.
Are there any more conservative sticking points? Well, no. So long as the state
is secure and individuals are free, things can be left to run on much as they
will. Corrections and adjustments are required from time to time. Sometimes
they bring the security of the state and the freedom of the individual into
conflict. But, unlike in socialist systems, this conflict is not necessary. The
true art of conservative politics is to avoid it.
It can be done, and on the whole we living in the western countries under
conservative governments during the final quarter of the twentieth century do
it rather well.
The proof of that lies in the fact that anti-conservatives do not propose to do
it differently or, if they do, have no coherent plan to follow. Should Tony
Blair replace John Major before long, policy will in broad terms remain the
same. The conservative agenda is still there. Conservatives can be happy about
1995 and, whatever befalls, confident about 1996.

FARMERS and crofters in Shetland - where the islands council yesterday declared
a state of emergency - have been among the worst hit by severe winter
conditions over the Christmas holiday period.
Mr John Ross, president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, will decide
today if there is a need to call for special assistance from the Scottish
Office.
Union office bearers and staff on Shetland spent yesterday checking with
farmers on how severely stock has been affected by the exceptional weather
conditions. In the light of their reports Mr Ross will decide if the situation
merits calling for special help from the Scottish Office in getting fodder
supplies to remote areas.
The worst affected part of Shetland mainland was in the the north where there
were reports of drifts up to 11ft deep. Mr Ross said that he had one report
from the NFU Shetland area president, Mr Addie Doull, who farms at the north
end of the Shetland mainland. Yesterday was the first day since Saturday that
he had been able to venture out at all.
``It was just too dangerous to contemplate leaving the house,'' said Mr Ross.
``It is only now that Addie and others in a similar position will be able to
assess their situation.
``I have asked him to phone round his area and determine how serious the
problems are. In the light of these reports I will decide if there should be
concern for animal welfare with regard to sheep in particular and livestock
generally.''
Mr Ross said that the NFU area secretary on Shetland, Margaret Farquhar, had
been alerted to be on stand-by ready to co-ordinate any emergency measures. The
SSPCA in Shetland were also being kept informed.
Mr David Nicolson, NFUS crofting convener, who lives between Sumburgh and
Lerwick, said that for the south of the Shetland mainland yesterday was their
best day since the weekend.
His son had managed out for the first time to check sheep on the hill. ``We are
trying to get hay out as best we can,'' he said. The farming pattern on
Shetland meant that there were a lot of hill sheep and sheep kept on common
grazings and it was proving difficult to get out to them.
In the Grampian area, which was also badly affected by severe weather, the
police said that they had had no reports of stock in difficulties.
``I think animals are more sensible than humans - they tend to find a safe
place and stay put until conditions improve,'' said a spokesman and police
headquarters in Aberdeen.

Dundee United 1, Hamilton 1
BASEMENT outfit Hamilton almost produced a David against Goliath victory to
warm the chill on Tayside as Iain Munro's visitors upset the odds in
yesterday's first division meeting.
A crowd of 6109 braved the sub-zero temperatures, but only those sporting the
Accies colours warmed to matters at the close of play.
A sparkling strike from visiting defender Steve Renicks contributed to the warm
glow surrounding the visiting support, his sixty-fifth minute highlight from 30
yards entering the list of candidates for goal of the season.
Accies, however, failed to follow up on that success by allowing their hosts to
spring back into the contest inside three minutes.
Had the visitors managed to stick in and contain an increasingly frenzied and
annoyed United, then an even bigger form book shock may well have been on the
cards as Billy Kirkwood's side grew in frustration the longer the contest
progressed.
United were again thankful to the scoring talents of striker Craig Brewster who
latched on to a head flick from substitute Owen Coyle off a Jim Bett free kick
to fire home the equaliser.
Mind you, judging by the territorial advantage they held throughout the
proceedings, the leveller was no more than United deserved on an afternoon when
they huffed and puffed without ever threatening to blow down the strongly-build
Accies' house.
Renicks, later to become his side's goal hero, was a defender supreme during
the early stages dominated by the home side, the full back booting clear from
under his own crossbar after Brian Welsh's header appeared net-bound off Andy
McLaren's corner.
Then, minutes prior to the interval, was another goal-line clearance, this time
executed by Chris Hillcoat, who stopped Gary McSwegan's header, again off a
McLaren cross.
Renicks was at it again, six minutes from the end, when completing his second
goal-line clearance of the afternoon by nodding clear another effort from Welsh.
In between times it proved to be the all-round excellence of the visiting
rearguard which held the key to the affair, central defender Crawford Baptie
and co. handling everything that the hosts could throw at them in a display
ready made to convince manager Munro he is on the right lines in his plans.
The visitors' refused to give United time on the ball in the vital midfield
department, an area in which Jim Bett recently has been ruling with something
more than a bit of flourish.
Thus deprived, United resorted to firing balls forward from back to front, thus
eliminating what has in recent weeks been their major asset. In short, they
were out-thought in terms of tactics.
United did, however, have outstanding performers in Steve Pressley and Maurice
Malpas, and it is no coincidence on a day when they failed to contrive scoring
opportunities that both are defenders.
The outcome meant that the Tayside outfit reduced the points gap between
themselves and leaders Dunfermline to only two, while Accies, despite their
heroics, still failed to relinquish their bottom of the table spot - still a
point adrift of second bottom Dumbarton.
Three players were booked in the contest, home man Jim Bett and visitors Jim
Sherry and Jose Quitongo.
DUNDEE UNITED - Maxwell, Shannon, Malpas, Pressley, Welsh, Bett, Winters,
Johnson, McSwegan, Brewster, McLaren. Substitutes - Coyle, Dailly, Hannah.
HAMILTON - Ferguson, Hillcoat, Renicks, McStay, Baptie, Paterson, Sherry,
McEntegart, Geraghty, Lorimer, Quitongo. Substitutes - McCormick, Thomson,
Cormack.
Referee - T M McCurry (Glasgow).

<HEADLINE>Building society confident of recovery Halifax predicts housing upturn</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S biggest building society, the Halifax, is confident the housing
market is starting to emerge from a double-dip recession.
While no strong recovery is thought likely in 1996, the society raises the
possibility of a mini-boom in the following year.
Last week money suppply data and building society lending figures for November
signalled a possible improvement in the housing market to come.
There was a limited recovery in 1993 from the worst of the recession, but the
market unexpectedly subsided once more in 1994 and 1995.
There were geographic variations, however, and Scotland was not affected as
badly as other areas, particularly South-east England.
The Halifax said the blame for the second downturn rested on a number of
factors - reduction in Government help for home-owners, continued high real
interest rates and expectations that nominal rates would rise, low consumer
confidence linked to lower job security and, most important, sharp increases in
personal taxes in 1994 and 1995 which squeezed disposable income.
These would not have so much impact in 1996, the society said. Interest rates
are now expected to fall and tax cuts will boost incomes.
Consumer confidence should strengthen with income growth, but the absence of
Government measures in the Budget to help the housing market means no strong
recovery is likely next year.
However, it believes the prospects for 1997 onwards look more promising than at
any time since the eighties. Interest rates are at historically very low levels
making mortgage costs much less onerous. Moreover, most people now consider
they will remain at these levels or even fall further.
The Halifax said the tax cuts expected in April should boost real incomes and
would be a major factor in promoting the long-lost ``feel-good'' factor. House
purchases are expected to rise quite sharply in 1996, certainly reversing this
year's 10% fall.
This is not expected to feed through quickly to prices, although the trend,
particularly in the second half of the year, should be clearly moving upwards.
Overall, the Halifax is looking for around a 2% increase next year with the
upward trend in both house moves and prices becoming more pronounced in 1997
and 1998 with rises of more than 5% likely each year.
The society suggested that, as expectations of further house price rises became
more widespread, there could even be a mini-boom in 1997 with both transactions
and prices rising by up to 10%.
``We hope the Government would see no particular wider problems in this - a
one-off correction in the market following years of weakness.
``It is doubtful whether it would spill over into more general inflation
through rising consumer demand given the battering the consumer has taken in
recent years and the `equity release' would be very limited,'' the Halifax
argued.
The society said it would, in fact, be very helpful for the housing market
since it would restore confidence in home ownership. It would also bring back
more normal conditions of buying and selling and would help to eliminate
negative equity more quickly.

Michael Tumelty looks back at a time of upheaval and insecurity in Scottish
music
IT is possible that, if the Scottish music scene in 1995 will be remembered for
anything, it will be the fact that, perhaps imperceptibly at the time, it was
the year the tectonic plates in the structure of musical society began to shift.
Over the previous few years, there had been rumbles, some of them subterranean,
that all was not well. Yards of print - nay, kilometres - had been produced in
the form of a succession of reports which tended to back a theory that Scotland
was over-subscribed with musical resources; that there were too many
organisations chasing too few gigs, too few audiences, too little money.
Rationalisation, reorganisation, and restructuring were being bandied about as
the buzz words. Smack in the middle of the developing storm was the country's
biggest musical organisation, Scottish Opera, which - year on year - seemed to
roll from from one threatening financial crisis to another.
The immediate target for rationalisation, which had been identified some years
earlier, was the orchestra of Scottish Opera. The attempt to merge it with the
BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra had long since appeared to have run aground,
despite the recommendations made in a report written under the chairmanship of
Helen Liddell, who had become so fed up with the subject she went and got
herself a quiet job somewhere in London.
In fact, after running for ever in the press the subject finally seemed to have
dropped over the horizon. Until May this year, when, out of the blue, an
announcement was made which suggested that yet another attempt to ``solve'' the
problem of over-provision of orchestras in Scotland was to be made.
For this one, the key players were shuffled. Yet again, of course, Scottish
Opera was one. But out went the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, and its place
at the collaborative table was taken by both of the other professional
orchestras in Scotland - the Royal Scottish National and Scottish Chamber
orchestras.
Alarm bells rang all over the place at the appointment of company doctor Sir
Lewis Robertson as chairman of the latest committee. They rang even more
stridently at the fact the entire caboodle was parcelled up and launched by the
Scottish Arts Council, once again donning its ``honest broker'' cloak.
The meetings went on. Nothing came out. All parties involved continued to
insist (when they said anything at all) that they had all entered the process
with what they called a ``white sheet'' approach - no preconceptions, no
preconditions. The RSNO chief executive summed up the vagueness of the whole
situation when he said: ``We'll go in and see what comes out.''
In truth, everybody knew that there was no way any meaningful collaboration
could take place without a sacrifice - if there was a ready solution it would
have been found earlier, and without committees, investigations, and reports.
And, at the same time, everybody knew that, unless a solution could be found
which addressed what Scottish Opera executives said was the basic problem -
that its company was fundamentally underfunded to the tune of #750,000 per year
- the whole exercise was a waste of time.
Behind closed doors, the committee shuffled every conceivable permutation of
Scotland's orchestras, fetching the BBC SSO back into the equation. In early
October they announced their findings, and - surprise, surprise - it was
proposed the Orchestra of Scottish Opera should be disbanded, and its work
carved up among the other three Scottish bands.
And this is when the tectonic plates began to shift. Scottish Opera called a
press conference, fronted by its big boys - chairman Sandy Orr, general
director Richard Jarman, and music director Richard Armstrong - who did a volte
face on their views of some years earlier, and rejected the findings of the
committee.
The opera bosses declared that, rather than see Scottish Opera's orchestra
dumped, they had decided to preserve the integrity of the company's musical
resources and, instead, put the company onto a part-time basis (while admitting
this would very likely be the start of a process of erosion).
The music establishment went ballistic. The unions (bar one, the Musicians'
Union) accused the opera company of dangerous brinksmanship. The Scottish Arts
Council, which had been doing its best to remain invisible during the whole
process, sent out its own thinly-veiled condemnation of Scottish Opera's
rejection of Sir Lewis Robertson's recommendations, while at the same time
accepting the decision of the company to go part-time.
Cynics in the wings suggested immediately that the SAC was weeping crocodile
tears as there was an influential cadre within its ranks who wished that
Scottish Opera, with its high-profile recurring problems and its immense drain
on funds, would fold up tents and disappear. More of the SAC in a moment.
The seismic crunch became audible when the Royal Scottish National Orchestra
and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, on the afternoon of Scottish Opera's crisis
news briefing, decided to issue their own press releases. Privately, the
orchestra bosses confessed that they were ``completely pissed off'' with
Scottish Opera's management.
Publicly, each orchestra stated categorically that the underfunding problems,
which Scottish Opera brandished daily like a banner of despair, applied equally
to their own organisations, and they were extremely concerned that their own
predicaments would be swamped by the tidal wave of news and noise about the
opera company.
To this end, both orchestras spoke out. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra revealed
- with figures attached - a horrifying timetable predicting its own financial
crisis within two years. Paul Hughes, chief executive of the Royal SNO, said
that the whole question of the funding of all of the national companies had to
be addressed ``before we all have to go part-time or worse''.
The chairman of one of the orchestras went off his head at the Scottish Arts
Council (off the record, of course) saying that ``these people should be out
there putting their heads on the block for all of us, arguing with the
Government on our behalf''.
The SAC kept its inscrutable smile firmly in place and shrugged sympathetic
shoulders, coming out with interminable quotes full of bureacratese, which
amounted to nothing much at all. ``The arm's length policy,'' mused one
orchestral executive, ``is a useful tool, not so much for keeping the
Government away from us, as keeping the Arts Council away from accepting direct
responsibility for anything.''
Then Seona Reid, director of the SAC, appeared finally to get off the fence. In
a newspaper interview she was quoted as saying: ``Perhaps Scottish Opera,
insteas of scaling down from the large, grand production, could plan outwards
from their extremely successful mid to small-scale performance.''
This was electrifying. The quote was buried deep in the story, and thus had no
real public impact, but was - without question - the most important quote of
the whole saga. The SAC director appeared to be suggesting that Scottish Opera
dump altogether what it considered to be its primary function and operate as a
small-scale outfit, adding only anything else it could afford. Invert your
role, appeared to be the message.
The implications were profound. If applied, by choice or pressure, such a
decision would almost certainly mean the complete dismantling of Scottish
Opera, its orchestra, chorus, technical and administrative structure. Those who
read the piece and picked up on the resonances were astounded.
Ministers at the Scottish Office were reported to be ``incandescent'' at what
the SAC director had said. Not that they didn't necessarily sympathise with the
sentiments; but they couldn't be seen to be associated with such an expression.
And, whether Seona Reid's inflammatory statement was directly responsible or
not, it wasn't long before secretary of state Michael Forsyth was to enter the
fray himself.
Just before that, however, there was a momentary diversion of optimism as Lord
Younger of Prestwick, chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland - a long-time
sponsor of Scottish Opera - staged a public display of confidence in the
beleaguered management of the opera company, and presented them with a
no-conditions-attached cheque for #100,000 to allow them to keep trading.
Shortly after that, the Scottish Office took direct action by reshuffling the
pack, leaving out all of the symphony orchestras, and producing a new character
in the drama - Scottish Ballet. Michael Forsyth instructed Scottish Opera and
the ballet company to get round the table, with his own minister for arts, Lord
Lindsay, to see if the two theatre-based companies could operate together, save
money, and survive.
And we await the outcome, though there are already noises that any savings from
an opera-ballet marriage would be insufficient to meet the basic underfunding
problems of the opera company, and, in any event, would entail reductions in
performances of both art forms.
In a separate context altogether, Hugh MacDonald, head of music for BBC
Scotland, revealed that the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra was facing a 5%
reduction in its own budget for next year, and that the SSO was in just the
same predicament as the independent symphony orchestras.
So there we are. Scottish Opera, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. All the
major national music companies; all with uncertain futures. It may be hard to
argue the case for such national insitutions when commercial industries are
collapsing and there are people with no jobs and damp houses.
But if this was a more enlightened country - and let's not beat about the bush,
here; we are being governed by political philistines - the unique cultural
heritage Scotland has in these organisations would be resourced, not just
adequately, but to the extent that their flagship status would never be in
question. Some chance, eh?

RANGERS took advantage of the postponement of Celtic's match against Raith
Rovers at Stark's Park yesterday to increase their lead at the top of the
premier division. With their oldest, and, this season, most dangerous rivals
unable to play, the Ibrox men tightened their grip on their league title.
It was imperative that the champions should take advantage of the situation, as
they played the only premier division game to survive the day.
They knew they could not afford to slip up, as they had done in their last
game, against Motherwell, when they dropped two points and helped Celtic narrow
the gap to two points.
This clash, with Kilmarnock, had to produce three points for the Ibrox team -
and it did so. By half-time Rangers had delivered what manager Walter Smith had
demanded from them. They were two goals in front and the match, essentially,
was over.
Rangers had moved with purpose and assurance from the moment the game kicked
off. At times, however, there was a lack of the incisive passing which is
necessary to produce goals and it took them until the twenty-fourth minute
before they went ahead.
Before that goal, Gordan Petric had shot high over the bar, Charlie Miller had
headed off target, and Oleg Salenko had seen a shot stopped by Dragoje
Lekovic's legs. That try must have encouraged the Russian because five minutes
later the striker did score.
Paul Gascoigne, back after a two-game suspension, picked out Brian Laudrup on
the left wing with a marvellous pass. The Dane played the ball into goal and
Salenko moved in to stab it over the line.
Eight minutes later, Kilmarnock had their best chance and referee Bill Crombie
angered Rangers' players and supporters with his part in the penalty-box panic
which struck the champions.
Initially, the referee awarded a corner, despite the fact that his linesman,
who seemed to be better placed, had signalled for a goal kick.
When the ball came over he then penalised Alan McLaren for a challenge on Tom
Brown and awarded an indirect free kick 12 yards from goal. Rangers protested,
and although Crombie stood firm, Richard Gough cleared the danger.
Afterwards, Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten admitted: ``We should have done
better with that free kick. We should have taken something from it.
``Instead, Rangers cleared the ball, stayed in front, and then we lost a second
goal in injury time. That was a bad blow.''
It proved the killer blow and, once again, Ibrox's enfant terrible, Gascoigne,
was involved. Petric played in a cross, Gascoigne chested it down, then flicked
it goalwards, only for Kilmarnock defender Jim Lauchlan to stop it with a hand.
The referee awarded a penalty and Gordon Durie sidefooted the ball confidently
into the net.
To be fair to Kilmarnock, they did try to carry the game to Rangers after
half-time. In 60 minutes, Paul Wright sent a shot wide from long range and
minutes later tried again from the edge of the penalty box with a shot which
went dangerously close.
But Rangers remained in command, although, at times, there was still
over-elaboration from Gascoigne and Laudrup.
For instance, eight minutes from the end Laudrup delayed when he had the ball
in the penalty box and Lekovic had strayed from his goal-line.
Eventually, the Dane passed to Miller, but the youngster shot high over the bar.
Three minutes later, Lekovic saved from Gascoigne but, in injury time, he was
unable to stop the Geordie.
This time, Salenko made the chance and Gascoigne cheekily sent one defender the
wrong way and then poked the ball home from close range. It was a fitting
finale to one of Gascogine's better performances.
Manager Smith said: ``We were glad to get the win, and I was pleased with the
way we played. Gascoigne made a good return and scored a good goal.''
However, Smith refused to accept that the three points would give his side a
psychological advantage over Celtic. ``I doubt if it will make any difference
at this stage,'' he said. ``Still, it is good to have the game behind us and
have another three points in the bag.''
Smith, however, must realise that if Rangers can maintain this run - they have
gone 15 games unbeaten in the league - they could go into next week's game
against Celtic with a commanding lead.
If the weather does not relent, Celtic could find themselves idle once more at
the weekend while Rangers will be able to play their home game against Hibs. It
is not inconceivable that the champions could travel to Parkhead with an
eight-point lead.
They will, however, go into that match without Stuart McCall and Ally McCoist,
who were both missing through injury yesterday. Neither will be ready for the
weekend and both are doubtful for the Celtic game. Durie, who limped off in the
closing minutes yesterday to be replaced by Ian Durrant, is also a worry for
the weekend with a thigh knock.
There were four bookings in the match, Robert Connor, Neil Whitworth, and
Brown, of Kilmarnock, and Rangers' Miller.
RANGERS - Goram, Ferguson, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Petric, Miller,
Gascoigne, Salenko, Durie, Laudrup. Substitutes - Durrant, McInnes,
Mikhailichenko.
KILMARNOCK - Lekovic, McPherson, Reilly, Henry, Whitworth, Lauchlan, Mitchell,
Connor, Wright, Brown, Holt. Substitutes - Montgomerie, Maskrey, Meldrum.
Referee - W N M Crombie (Edinburgh).

ATHLETICS
NEW Year Sprint champion Doug Walker will switch his attention to the 200
metres if he fails to defend his title in this year's professional gala at
Meadowbank on Sunday.
Walker, joint back-marker with Elliot Bunney off half a metre for the big
sprint, is the scratch man for the 200m open handicap which has a start limit
of 20m. Off 20m is Mel Neef, who will make Walker work to earn the #400 first
prize.
Walker's coach Dave Gibson believes that his man is up to the challenge.
``Doug's flying - if anything he's running better than he was at this time last
year,'' he said.
Among the others Walker has to chase is Bedlington's John Hedley, training
partner of Britain's Sportsman of the Year Jonathon Edwards, who starts off 8m,
and two former New Year Sprint winners Neil Sneddon (Edinburgh Southern) and
Tommy Finkle (Jedburgh), who join Borders junior international Iain Horsburgh
on the 9m mark. Strongly tipped Borderer Lee Notman (Hawick) is off 12m.
Heriot-Watt University student Walker was reckoned to have given one of the
best displays on record by a back-marker in winning last year.

RUMOURS of a #1000m ``white knight'' role for Whitbread in Forte's battle with
hostile bidder Granada could be confirmed as early as today, some believe.
According to one newspaper, official confirmation of a #1000m offer by brewing
and leisure giant Whitbread for Forte's restaurant business is likely to come
before Stock Exchange trading resumes at 8.30am.
Hotel magnate Sir Rocco Forte and Peter Jarvis, chief executive of Whitbread,
are rumoured to have agreed terms on Friday, with advisers finalising details
over the Christmas holiday.
A deal for the sale of Forte's roadside restaurants and service stations in the
UK and France, and its Travelodge budget hotels, would greatly strengthen the
group's defensive hand.
It would allow Forte to repay a significant proportion of its debt and could
also facilitate a special dividend or share buy-back to release value to
stockholders.
Forte's shareholders would have to ratify the sale, which is thought likely to
materialise only if they first reject the #3300m bid by leisure giant Granada.
The purchase of Forte's restaurant division would mark another major milestone
in Whitbread's strategy of diversifying out of brewing. In August, Whitbread
paid #201m for tennis and fitness group David Lloyd Leisure, whose most
profitable leisure club is at Renfrew.
A month later it acquired the 41-strong Costa Coffee chain, which has outlets
at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports and Glasgow's Queen Street and Central
stations.
No-one at Forte or Granada was available for comment yesterday. Whitbread said
it never commented on market rumour.
