MELROSE may appeal against the eight-week ban imposed on their Kiwi
flanker Nick Broughton following his dismissal for stamping in the
Premiership clash with Hawick two weeks ago.
Club secretary Stuart Henderson described the sentence on Broughton --
a first offender -- as ''harsh.'' The young New Zealander appeared
before the same Murrayfield disciplinary panel as Scotland prop Peter
Wright on Tuesday night.
The SRU issued a statement concerning Wright's six-week ban because of
the exceptional circumstances surrounding his imminent selection for the
Test against Western Samoa. The Broughton case, as is customary, was
disposed of in secret. The precedent of secrecy having been broken, the
Union's position is now more untenable than ever.
* THE McEwan's rugby star of the month is Dalkeith RFC fixture
secretary Alisdair Niven. He was nominated by the club for what they
term his sterling service in a variety of posts -- treasurer, fixture
secretary and so on -- but it was his unusual devotion to the playing of
the game which caught the eye of the rugby writers' judging panel.
Niven, still playing at the age of 42 and preparing for a game against
Ross High, discovered that a favourite pair of shorts were still damp
from the wash. The Dalkeith nomination declares: ''Undaunted, he
demonstrated his improvisational abilities by throwing the shorts into
the microwave. He then went off for the rest of his gear.
''Ten minutes later he was startled by cries from his wife and, on
returning to the kitchen, found her extinguishing a shapeless,
smouldering and blackened mass in the sink. He went on to play in blue
shorts and was promptly fined by his teammates.''
The McEwan's Roadrunner award for clubs which have endured
''interesting'' trips to take on the opposition goes to Isle of Mull RFC
for the marathon involved in fulfilling their fixture with Arran.
Cancelled ferries, missing and commandeered buses, and a MacBrayne's
''rugby special'' ferry for the hop from Lochranza to Oban and another
onwards to Craignure meant a 12-hour round trip. Unfortunately they
lost.

MANU Samoa. Welcome to Scotland lads. Have fun. Enjoy yourselves and
here's hoping you're the second best International side in Scotland come
next Saturday.
I certainly don't need any reminding that these guys can play a bit.
Just a couple of years ago, I played in the Test match at Apia when, in
sweltering conditions, we lost the only game of our South Pacific tour.
We had beaten Fiji and Tonga and were ready to go for the Oceanic hat
trick when we came badly unstuck in the kind of conditions which made it
feel like you were playing in a sauna.
I didn't see their opening game against Edinburgh on Wednesday, but I
don't think anybody will be in the least bit surprised that the big
talking point afterwards was not how they had played, or that Edinburgh
had, by all accounts, given them a good game. It was about their
ferocious tackling.
They have always played like that. They played in exactly the same
manner during the World Cup this summer. Some of their tackling was --
in every sense -- way over the top. They will remember, though, that
when they played Scotland during the 1991 World Cup at Murrayfield, they
were given a taste of their own medicine with some aggressive, but
legal, tackling and were on the receiving end of some thunderous
close-quarter running from Gavin Hastings.
I don't think that anyone should get over excited by the fact that
Edinburgh were not blown off the park. It was the Samoans' first game of
the tour, and I would be amazed if they don't have the capacity to up it
by at least a couple of gears by the time they play us next week.
Before that, they meet Scotland A tomorrow at Hawick -- and a special
word of encouragement here to Gary Armstrong, who will captain the side,
great to see you back Gary -- and then North and Midlands on Tuesday
night.
Scotland have been caught on the hop by November touring sides for the
past couple of years -- remember the All Blacks and the Springboks? I
wish I couldn't -- and we've no intention of falling into that trap this
time.
* IT'S been a bad week for Peter Wright. Sidelined for six weeks, out
of the Samoan game and banned from taking any further part in
Boroughmuir's Premiership campaign. You can't help but feel sorry for
him. That's a pretty stiff punishment in anybody's book.
Personally, and no offence intended, I shall never speak to another
referee again, ever. In fact, I know quite a number of players who from
now on are going to have to tape up their mouths before they go on to
the field.
Three or four weeks ago, I wrote that we had scuppered our
championship chances at Stirling. That shows you how much I know! Well,
we're back in contention with a vengeance. It looks like us,
Boroughmuir, or Melrose but I'm making no predictions. We're not alone
in being front-runners in the championship race and at the same time
being only four points from relegation. Now that's what I call
cut-throat.
Speaking of which, I have just had the razor out on our fullback Craig
Sangster. We're a friendly club here at Stirling. Virtually all your
bodily needs are catered for. I said virtually. Craig is now sporting
what I think in the hairdressing trade is called a Number Three. Vidal
Sassoon, eat your heart out.

TANGO! The Dance, The Song, The Story.
Simon Collier, Artemis Cooper, Maria Susana Azzi and Richard Martin.
#24.95
THIS is a coffee-table book for Come Dancing enthusiasts and
professional choreographers. Collier, Cooper, Azzi, and Martin conclude
in a pretentious manner which does not befit the dance's delinquent
beginnings. They say the Tango is the ''ceaseless dance that we may
choose to call death, that we gauge as individual liberty''. The Tango
was not born out of politics, however, but out of their non-existence.
The Argentinians, a mixture of French, Portugese and Spanish, are
hugely sentimental. Before Buenos Aires was reborn as the Paris of South
America, the country was a neglected backwater overrun by gauchos.
Salted beef and wool were exported, tears dropped, men in striped
T-shirts, high-heeled boots and slouch hats slurped tequila and drew
knives. It was rough. Publicans stood behind wooden bars and served
through the slits.
However, by the 1920s, Argentina was one of the world's richest
nations. Immigrants streamed in, there was little unemployment and wages
were often better than in France or Britain.
So while the city bettered itself and was transformed into a tourist
destination, the outskirts, the arrabals, hid the casualties of any
capitalist economic boom. Settlers were united in poverty, and poverty
brings people physically closer. It isn't so hard for music, like
disease, to spread.
The first new European dance to reach Argentina in 1816 was the waltz,
then the polka, then, obviously bored, the Argentinian people, a host of
colour and cultures, began to make up their own. There were more free
blacks in the Spanish colonies than the British empire, and a tango was
a place where they assembled to dance. The African-Argentinian candombe
was an energetic fusion of semi-athletic gesticulation, improvisation
and wild rhythm. Couple that with the tense fervour of Latin American
folk dancing and some semblance of the Tango is born. For the Tango was
not always a constipated fan-dance, a 'Come Dancing' convention. The
original was much raunchier.
Europe feared the Tango because it was associated with sex. The writer
Leopoldo Lugones called the Tango the ''reptile from the brothel''. In
1914, Buenos Aires had 100,000 more men than women. Both licensed and
unlicensed prostitution was rife. Brothels -- clandestinos -- housed
women recruited from Europe, the white slave trade being masterminded by
French, Italian and Jewish organisations. Its economic evolution and sex
industry made Buenos Aires a stop for wealthy playboys, and they in
turn, the outwardly respectable, took the ''lascivious'' Tango from
seedy cafes to Europe and introduced it to their own social class.
The songs written to accompany the early Tango, understandably,
weren't too happy. Take this South American ditty written in 1933:
Underworld song, song of Buenos Aires, There's something inside you that
lives and is everlasting, Underworld song, lament of bitterness, Smile
of hope, sob of passion.
Tango songs were cheery numbers which focused on peasant shame and
social stigma.
What the purists did not like was the way the male dancing partner
dominated the female. It was his job to bend her backwards while
pressing his body against hers. They intertwined legs. He seemed to drag
her from one end of the room to the other, force her backwards to the
ground, stop, pelvis to pelvis, and then pull her back again. It was
woman as rag doll.
Fans of the Tango say it has a ''sensual and morbid glamour''. It has.
If it hadn't been invented already, Disney might have made it up for a
love scene between Morticia and Frankenstein. Outraged by the blatant
misuse of male power, the Italians were compelled to create the smooth
Tango, the forerunner of the ballroom version, by cutting out the
gymnastics.
WHEN the Tango hit Paris, it became a subculture; the young, hip, fast
and decadent took it on. The Tango even changed women's underwear, to
allow more freedom of movement, which suggests more sexual liberty. A
special Tango corset was introduced, shorter and more elastic. The fact
that the Tango had evolved from black culture and had been favoured by
prostitutes was too much for the racist, inhibited upper classes.
When the dance hit England, The Times printed a letter on the May 20,
1913, from ''A Peeress'' who wrote: ''My grandmother has often told me
of the shock she experienced on first beholding the polka, but I wonder
what she would have said, had she been asked to introduce a well-brought
up girl of eighteen, to the scandalous travesties of dancing which are
bringing more young men to parties than are needed.''
She went on: ''I need not describe the various horrors of American and
South American negroid origin. I would only ask hostesses to let one
know what houses to avoid by indicating in some way on their
invitation-card whether the 'Boston' (the beginner of the evil) and the
'Tango' will be permitted.''
The Tango is now conformist; proper, stiff-lipped and polite. It was
eventually received in the rosy parlours of the gentry, and that is its
creators' revenge.

Different Class, Pulp (Island)
* Nobody's admitting owt yet, but he must be Alan Bennett's
love-child, our Jarvis, mustn't he? There's the same droll mastery of
northern camp, the same bent for acute diaristic observation. How about
this spoken section from Jarvis's epic memoire I Spy: ''I used to
compose my own critical notes in my head: 'The crowd gasp at Cocker's
masterful control of the bicycle, skilfully avoiding the dog turd next
to the corner shop,' imagining a blue plaque above the place I first
touched a girl's chest.'' Or the bittersweet hymn to lost adolescence
that is Disco 2000. But stuff me and my lit-crit contextualising.
Frankly, everyone who's anyone is simply wild for Pulp's serio-comic
glam-rock. Thankfully, it's not just for thinking about; it's for
throwing the moodiest of moody shapes to.
Walk On, John Hiatt (Capitol)
* Like another wry and perceptive singer-songwriter from the
post-Dylan generation, Loudon Wainwright, John Hiatt gets better with
every album. His voice becomes more wise and pain-wracked and his lyrics
more resigned and pithily-poetic, while his tunes retain all their old
rockin' energy. And he can be profoundly insightful and seriously funny
at the same time. Why, who else but John Hiatt could spray illumination
on male emotional immaturity with a raised toilet-seat metaphor? Check
out his laconic lament for a long-lost love, Ethylene, and you'll see
what I mean. Check out this whole album and you're doing yourself a big
favour.
Psychological Enslavement, Silent Eclipse (Fourth and Broadway)
* Never mind the empty self-promotion which is gangsta rap, what we've
got here is undiluted anga rap, the enraged voice of a group of black
Britons seeking to rally their people to overthrow the system which
oppresses them. All manner of targets receive a verbal kicking --
Government, police, judiciary, religion, schools -- in black-separatist
tones which come uncomfortably close to white surpemacist ones. But hey,
put this album in the charts and you'll see that Silent Eclipse's
depiction of contemporary urban dread is sufficiently powerful to
provoke many a Tory back-bench coronary. Result!
Back To Funk, various (BGP)
* A pithy, juicy, jazztastic collection of early-seventies tunes from
Detroit's Eastbound and Westbound labels. The title track, by Robert
Lowe, is a stormer, along with Caesar Frazier's smouldering Hicky Burr,
composed by Bill Cosby and Quincy Jones. Frug perkily to the funk of
Alvin Cash on Stone Thing (Parts 1 and 2)! Boogaloo madly to Whip! Whop!
by Melvin Sparks! Get off on Bill Mason's Gettin' Off! Get up off your
booty and buy this album today!
DAVID BELCHER
Stellar Regions, John Coltrane (Impulse!)
* Recorded five months before his untimely death in 1967 and until
recently believed lost, these eleven tracks (with the exception of the
previously available Offering) represent the first complete session of
unheard Coltrane work to be issued in twenty years. His tenor playing by
this time could be free, verging on caustic, though concise, but the
more melodic items remind us that few musicians before (and even fewer
since) announced their presence with such luxuriant majesty.
Star Seeding, Bheki Mseleku (Verve)
* Mseleku's saxophone playing, usually heard in duet with his own
piano playing, has often seemed novelty-like but on this, his strongest
release to date, it expands a trio featuring the resolutely resonant
Charlie Haden (bass) and the nimbly swinging Billy Higgins into a
perfectly plausible quartet. Without losing their flavour entirely, the
music is moving away from Mseleku's African roots into more mainstream
jazz, and a previous tendency to ramble is giving way to a more cohesive
if still romantically meditative style.
ROB ADAMS
Rachmaninov Piano Concertos 1 and 3, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Cleveland
Orchestra, Ashkenazy (Decca)
* THIS French pianist is a man coming into his own. From always having
been a first class musician, in the last couple of years he has gained
enormous maturity of style. His presence at the St Magnus Festival this
year was unforgettable, and not just because of his rather dandified,
designer presentation, with a penchant for red socks and gold
accessories. Go immediately to your nearest stockist to collect these
new and sensational recordings of Rachmaninov's First and Third Piano
Concertos. They are played, often at hair-raising speeds, with the
combination of elan and sheer power that is Thibaudet's trademark. As to
the orchestral playing, suffice to say that the Cleveland Orchestra
accompanies. Flawlessly, of course, with another great pianist, Vladimir
Ashkenazy, weilding the white stick. Point of local interest: Thibaudet
will be in Scotland in a fortnight to play the First Concerto with the
RSNO and Alexander Lazarev. Not to be missed, concert and disc.
The American Album, Itzhak Perlman (EMI)
* PRIDE of place in this collection of violinistic Americana, which
also includes lesser known works by Leonard Bernstein and Lukas Foss,
goes to Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto, a thoroughgoing romantic
classic, shockingly neglected by violinists, and therefore virtually
unheard in concert. Wonderful, warm melodies -- and a slow movement that
will melt you -- characterise the work, sumptuously played by Perlman
with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Seiji Ozawa.

Some advances in technology are proving to be strangely attractive.
Joe Donnelly offers some direction in the magic world of magnets and
explores the boundaries of science, past, present and future
ST ANDREWS scientist Bob Cywinski has a lot of pull in his field, or a
lot of push, depending on the particular polarity of the moment. Since
his field happens to be a magnetic one, it's no great surprise.
Professor Cywinski has just won a major grant, worth nearly #135,000,
from the EPSRC for a study of the magnetic and transport properties of
intermetallic compounds -- and if that sounds a mouthful, it is in fact
a big bite of the future of technology.
His work has huge implications for transport and power industries
along with medical scanning and the next evolutionary levels of
microchip technology.
He is pictured above with a powerful little magnet suspended in the
air in an electromagnetic field. It's not an uncommon parlour trick
these days; some novelty companies are selling such devices as executive
toys and expensive stocking fillers for the folk who have everything.
These magnets are different, however. They're made from completely new
alloys of metals.
The professor's work at St Andrews University is aimed at developing
superconductors, the holy grail of the global power community.
Superconductors do exactly as one would imagine. They are super at
conducting electricity. Copper wires and high-tension cables carry
power, but they also have a drag factor known as resistance which wastes
enormous amounts of power as heat. Superconductors don't have that
problem. There's no resistance, so nothing is wasted. Whatever power is
generated, that's the amount which gets to whatever appliance needs it.
There are one or two added benefits, of which more later.
Professor Cywinski tells us: ''I'm principally interested in
fundamental properties. We make alloys from different elements and see
how their metallic, magnetic, and superconducting properties function.
We make the alloys in furnaces, but to get them to be superconducting,
they have to be cooled. The highest temperature superconductors are
mercury-based copper oxides which need to be cooled to 130 Kelvin, or
about minus 140 degrees, which is pretty cold indeed.
''We have looked at methods of producing alloys. If you are making an
alloy you can do it in a neutron beam and see what changes are made. We
have access to the Isis pulsed neutron source which gives us the power
we need. Our object is a fundamental understanding of materials.
''We are doing blue sky research because we believe we should be
looking for new science. Tomorrow's technology will be based on dramatic
new changes, not little steps forward.
''There have been dramatic improvements in this field. Twenty years
ago the highest temperature of superconductors was 23 Kelvin, which is
very close to absolute zero. It was very unstable and could only be
prepared as a thin film. The temperature could only be maintained by
very expensive liquid helium which costs about #9 a litre.
''It took almost fifteen years to find another alloy, copper oxide, to
superconduct at 12 degrees higher. Now we have our latest superconductor
which can be cooled much more cheaply by liquid nitrogen that can be
made out of air which is much cheaper. It's getting close to making
these things a serious commercial proposition.
''One of the other effects is that superconductors are very efficient
super magnets. I've seen a demonstration in Japan where alloy magnets
can actually levitate people in chairs.
''Medical scanning in magnetic resonance imaging chambers is done by
superconducting magnets, so the more efficient the magnets the better
the scanner. Superconductors can be used like semi-conductors in
electronics. In the foreseeable future we will have superconducting
computers which will be a thousand times faster than today's machines,
yet will not need heat dispersion to keep them cool.
''Strangely enough, while we are at the leading edge of intermetallic
compound research and are using some of the most advanced particle
physics technology in the world, we still don't know why these materials
conduct electricity with no loss.
''Our aim, however, is to eventually produce high temperature
superconductors which will also be supermagnets which will change the
face of transport and electronics.''
* INDIANS living in adobe houses in the Rio Grande valley in New
Mexico are using very high technologies to improve on the most ancient,
their traditional methods of food processing and preparation.
They are using solar power to dry crops quickly for processing and
packaging, and a solar oven to bake large quantities of food, including
traditional Indian breads. Sandia Labs have provided the pueblo both
equipment and technical expertise from its Solar Thermal Design
Assistance Centre.
''This is a convergence of tradition and technology,'' says Lynn
Brown, general manager of the San Juan Agricultural Co-operative. ''The
sun has always been important to the Indian culture; we're just adapting
new technology so we can compete in today's economy more effectively.''
The co-operative is growing, drying, and packaging a variety of fruits
and vegetables, including tomatoes, corn, chilli, pumpkin, beans and
melon. The pueblo is using the solar oven to supplement traditional
baking and cooking. For centuries, their bread has been baked in a clay
oven fired with wood. The new solar oven will bake about 54 one-pound
loaves per hour, or it can cook huge stews and chilli dishes.
The tests in the Indian village will have great implications for the
ecology in emerging countries where firewood is a premium, and
desertification of fertile lands is caused by the constant need to cut
trees and bushes for cooking fires. The oven's ultimate success,
however, will be how well it is accepted by tribal members all over the
world, since the traditional methods of cooking are often linked to
cultural cohesion.
Unfortunately, in non-tribal Scotland, we generally don't get enough
sun to bake an oatcake.
* LAST week we described how David Flint is developing a treatment
which could immunise people against being too fat. While the world waits
for that miracle treatment, fat in all its shapes is still a concern.
Meanwhile, a team of researchers at the Institute of Food Science in
Reading is targeting another kind of fat, cholesterol, by building a
molecular sieve which traps it.
The sieves are special polymers which are imprinted with pores exactly
the same size as the cholesterol molecules. The fatty deposits slip
inside the micro-pores and can't get out. The Reading team has so far
managed to strip the cholesterol out of fish oil, but the technique has
much further reaching potential.
Similar polymer traps can be built with pores exactly the same size as
specific bacteria. It's already worked with E.Coli, Listeria, and
Staphylococcus. The traps could be used to extract bacteria from water
or to test for contamination in food.
It might also be possible to design the traps to contain antibodies to
specific bacteria to target other types of bugs.
* THOSE of us who suffer from Winter Blues, or SAD syndrome, the
'seasonally affected disorder' caused by the lack of daylight in
wintertime, can blame it on calcium, the stuff that's abundant in milk,
seashells, and our bones. Using the odd combination of jellyfish and
tobacco, a study in Nashville has brought chronobiologists one step
closer to determining what makes our biological clocks tick.
Scientists have long known that calcium ions regulate many functions
like muscle contraction and chemical changes in the brain. The
biological, or circadian, clock rules an organism's internal rhythms.
''For the first time we might explain how the clock controls all
different kinds of observable rhythms that impact our lives,'' team
leader Carl Johnson says.
In the study, the researchers used a mutated plant in which a gene
from glow-in-the-dark jellyfish was transported into tobacco cells.
Since the chemical made from this gene emits light only when calcium is
present, they were able to monitor calcium levels in the tobacco by
measuring the light.
''Biological rhythms govern everything from alertness and sleep to
body temperature and hormone production,'' Johnson says. ''As
chronobiologists we try and help people better understand jet lag,
winter depression, adjusting to shift work, disrupted sleep patterns,
accidents due to drowsiness, and the optimal time of day to administer
drugs.''
Doctors have found the course of diseases can change in daily cycles.
Heart attacks, joint pain, and migraine headaches are more likely to
occur in the morning, for reasons that are not entirely clear. In
nature, the circadian system stimulates processes such as flowering,
animal reproduction, and migration, Johnson says. For example, plants
flower in the spring and make seeds in the winter. The circadian clock
is the timer they use to measure the day and night length that triggers
this rhythm.
''I'm hoping that ultimately these studies will reveal exactly how the
circadian clock works,'' says Johnson, adding it's likely that daily
clocks go on to drive seasonal clocks. Chronobiologist can then search
for molecular mechanisms that answer questions such as what makes deer
battle for females in the autumn, birds lay eggs in the spring, and
human immune systems beef up their defences in winter. They may find the
solution as to why, in springtime, a young man's fancy turns to the
finer things. Hopefully, they will also find out what makes some human
brains want to hibernate until April. Your Frontiersman is setting his
alarm for when the clocks change again.
* THE art of science and technology writing, and it is indeed an art,
as this Frontiersman continues to convince a discerning editor, has
changed beyond recognition in the past century. Science too has made
some advances, one has come to accept. In the old days, it was deadly
serious, as we discover from the first copy of Scientific American,
printed 150 years ago.
The anniversary reproduction of one of the world's more popular
sci-mags, boasts that at the time of the Irish famine, it was the
advocate of industry and enterprise, and journal of mechanical and other
improvements. It was also highly moral, to wit one report on almost a
hundred thousand barrels of liquor which was burned in a New York fire.
The Scientific American notes the loss, for which, they intone ''nobody
ought to mourn''.
The first issue carries a detailed article on the new method of making
knife-handles from horn and a ''useful discovery'' of the amazing
properties of zinc, propounded by one Professor Farraday. Today's corn
circles had different properties back then. The magazine reports a whole
field of haystacks rising into the air, right through the clouds, for no
apparent reason. Possibly not all that liquor was burned.
Among the patents applications of the day, most are for agricultural
implements. This Frontiersman, however, is baffled by their scientific
frontiersmen who were lining up in droves to lodge patents for something
called a 'smut machine'.
The wonders of the age reported in the first edition were Morse's
telegraph, forerunner of the World Wide Web; an invention by a Joseph
Hurd, which separated or clarified liquids by centrifugal force, a
process that daily saves lives in blood transfusions; and a
daguerreotype camera that could take pictures of 150 degrees, the first
wide-angle lens. Scientific American also suggests there is no end to
the many valuable ways of using India Runner, particularly in
''sheathing''. We know not of what they speak, and maybe we shouldn't go
into this too deeply.
Some things have not changed. A hundred and fifty years ago, the
praises of magnetism were being sung, as indeed we now delight in
reporting Professor Bob Cywinski's work above. The old Scientific
American went a step further and put their praises to rhyme, thus:
Attraction is a curious power, that none can understand:
It's influence is everywhere, in water, air and land.
It keeps the earth compact and tight, as though strong bolts were
through it;
And what is more mysterious yet, it binds us mortals to it.
Watch this space for iambic pentameter odes to Sonic the Hedgehog and
the Interactive World of the Web.

In his dispatch from the front, Michael Fry witnesses the imminent
fall of Carlisle to the Jacobites.
CARLISLE, November 11 -- THE surrender of this border fortress appears
imminent after the Jacobite army surrounded it today. Its fall would
give Prince Charles Edward Stuart his first taste of victory in England,
and a flying start to the invasion which he mounted when he crossed the
border only two days ago.
His tactics have again dazzled and disconcerted the maladroit moves by
the Government in London to block his advance. At the moment the only
opposing forces anywhere near him are 2000 men under General George Wade
at Newcastle. After being withdrawn from the war in Flanders, they made
a forced march from London to reach the garrison town on the Tyne two
weeks ago. But they have shown no sign of moving since.
When the prince left Edinburgh at the beginning of this month, he
first made as if to advance towards Wade with half his troops, while
sending a second detachment under his lieutenant-general, Lord George
Murray, down the western route towards the Border. But after Charles
reached Kelso, he suddenly turned aside up the valley of the River
Teviot to reunite all 5500 of his soldiers in front of Carlisle.
Despite its grimly impressive fortifications, the city is in fact
almost defenceless, and not prepared in any way for a siege. As news
came through of the Jacobites' approach, the Lord-Lieutenant of
Cumberland called out the militia of the county, most of them
farmworkers led by the local gentry. When the prince's army actually
appeared, it soon became clear that the militiamen who had gathered in
the city were not going to stay and defend it. Last night, while their
officers slept, many jumped over the ramparts and ran away home.
They left behind only the Governor of Carlisle Castle, Colonel Richard
Durand, and a few semi-retired military veterans, appropriately called
Invalids. From within the medieval walls, it is reported that the chief
citizens, the major and corporation, and the dean and chapter of the
cathedral, are alarmed at the prospect of any serious resistance being
put up, for fear of revenge by the Highlanders on the 4000 townspeople.
In any case, the governor can scarcely even defend his castle. Built by
the English Tudor monarchs, it has housed no regular garrison since the
Civil Wars of a century ago, and the fortifications are now in a state
of extreme disrepair.
Only the closed gates of the city are keeping out the clansmen, who
are reported to be in ''great health and spirits''. They have spent the
day digging entrenchments round the town, making scaling ladders in
woods nearby and mounting their cannon. They are unlikely to have to use
any of this equipment, and seem more intent on frightening the
townsfolk.
Confident of the capture of Carlisle, Prince Charles has not bothered
to make detailed plans for an attack. In fact he has left the immediate
environs of the city and stationed himself at Brampton, five miles to
the east, on the main road across the Pennine Hills.
Sources close to the prince say that this move reveals his real
purpose, which is to draw Wade's force towards him. His assessment of
the situation is that he needs as soon as possible another victory in
the field. It could match on English soil the effects of the Battle of
Prestonpans, which laid Scotland at his feet by showing that the
Government's soldiers would not stand up to him.
In choosing this ground on which to fight, Charles has followed the
advice of Lord George Murray. The general believes that the hilly
terrain of Cumberland suits the Highlanders' fighting style. In bad
weather, with snow falling in the Pennines, an advance by Wade would
face severe logistical problems, and his men would be fatigued by a
march of 80 miles over rough country.
If Wade stays where he is, the prince's calculations could pay off
anyway. The road southwards into England would still lie open. The
western side of the country is otherwise undefended. With the
Government's troops still being hastily recalled from Flanders, there
has not yet been time to organise a force capable of halting an advance
by the mobile Jacobites.
The north-western counties of England, with a large Roman Catholic
population in Lancashire, may also be favourable recruiting territory
for the prince. But so far there is no sign of the mass rising of
English Jacobites which he hoped for as soon as he crossed the Border.
This may be because he has not made much effort to get in touch with
them, so certain is he that the whole English people will rally to him
once they see a chance of restoring the legitimate Stuart dynasty.
His conviction is not, however, shared by many of the clan chieftains.
They have gone along with his plan of marching on Carlisle and seeking
battle in the neighbourhood. But they would be unhappy about venturing
much further into England, because their main aim remains the
restoration of James VIII in an independent Scotland.
They are also worried that Charles, by moving away from Edinburgh, has
lost contact with his ally, King Louis XV of France. The ultimate
success of the rebellion must depend on the scheme for a French invasion
of the South of England, which would meet the Jacobite army coming from
the North. Co-ordination of this is now impossible. According to reports
from Paris, the designated French commander, the Duc de Richelieu, is
still there, and shows no sign of leaving for one of the ports on the
Channel where immediate preparations to launch the expedition would have
to be made.
Another dispatch next week.

Healing Threads. Mary Beith. Edinburgh University Press, #9.99
AT Pennyghael on the island of Mull old people used to point to an
overgrown patch of ground which, they claimed, was the site of the
herbal garden of the Beatons, hereditary physicians to the Lords of the
Isles.
From that historic spot plants might have been pulled to stem a sword
wound after a battle, or to help a woman through a difficult labour.
The Mull patch is a potent reminder of what we have lost in the way of
knowledge, and Mary Beith's Healing Threads: Traditional Medicines of
the Highlands and Islands is an important attempt to recover this at a
time when more and more people, anxious about the chemicals they are
putting into their bodies, are turning to the natural cures of the past.
When did the use of the environment as a Gaelic pharmacy in the
Highlands and Islands begin? ''The simplest, though necessarily vague,
answer is when the first remedy effectively healed a wound, a disease or
even just a sense of physical discomfort,'' Beith argues. ''Whenever and
wherever it began it became, like medicine throughout the ancient world,
inextricably linked with religion and ritual.''
Scientists can diagnose conditions like arthritis and osteoporosis in
prehistoric skeletons, but as yet cannot tell if any treatment was
administered. However, there may be clues in the vicinity. Twenty years
ago, so many shrivelled outer skins of a type of puffball mushroom were
found at the 5000-year-old Neolithic village of Skara Brae in Orkney
that their application in herbal medicine was strongly suspected.
When Columba established his monastic settlement on Iona the monks
needed cures, not only for themselves, but for the many distressed
people who came in search of comfort. On the sacred isle there was
psychological as well as physical treatment, and sometimes a mixture.
The common moorland plant St John's Wort is known in Gaelic as
achlasan Chaluim Chille, after the saint's Gaelic name. Columba is said
to have placed the plant in a boy's oxter to treat a nervous condition
caused by tending cattle alone on a hillside in the darkness.
Columba was consulted about nosebleeds and fractures, and was
especially resorted to for cures for blindness. ''There is some
likelihood that the saint's reputation for ophthalmic 'miracles' may
have been due to the monks' competence in using surgical couching for
cataracts,'' Beith believes.
In the minds of these early healers there were often conflicts about
the place of medicine in Christian doctrine. Celtic monks who fled to
the Continent because of Norse raids wrote on the margins of Latin
manuscripts about pre-Christian cures and incantations, some of which
refer to the Gaelic pagan god of medicine, Dian Cecht.
Beith acknowledges her debt to John Bannerman for his seminal work,
The Beatons (1986). The Beaton physicians, originally MacBeths, are
believed to have come from Ireland towards the end of the 13th century
as part of the dowry of the Connacht bride of Angus Og, Lord of the
Isles.
''This kindred was to flourish in Highland medicine for some 400
years, with at least nineteen branches of the family practising
throughout the islands and the mainland as far south and east as
Angus,'' Beith writes.
In the first half of the 17th century several Mull Beatons assembled a
manuscript which is now held in the National Library of Scotland. Whisky
is the panacea which will ''heal wounds and it will brighten brass, and
it will help those suffering from fistula and round cancer, and if it be
given to epileptics in their drink it will help them, and it will cure
every gripe or colic caused by cold or paralysis, and it will sharpen
the wits, and it will make you remember the things you have forgotten,
and it will make the sad man into a happy man . . .''
To many people the traditional medical cures of the Highlands sound
like mumbo-jumbo, but as Beith cautions: ''Highland healing should be
set in the wider context of medieval European orthodox medicine so that
the local use of, say, skulls, spiders, woodlice, and snakes is seen as
no more strange, even considerably less so, than the prescribing of
powdered Egyptian mummy across seventeenth-century urban apothecaries'
counters.''
THERE are fascinating glossaries to browse through in Healing Threads.
Colic was treated by making the patient swallow a bullet, from the idea
that its weight would unravel the knotting of the bowels, believed to be
the cause of the disease. One way of stopping a nosebleed was a live
toad held before the face.
Mary Beith lists the healing properties of the kinds of plants that
would have grown in that lost Beaton garden on Mull. Twigs of ivy were
boiled in butter as a salve for sunburn, and blackthorn flowers made a
laxative.
Some of the cures in Beith's book are still in use, incorporated into
homeopathic remedies, but always seek expert advice in the use of any
traditional medical preparation.

Chop, chop! Time to root around in the recipe books, says Lady Claire
Macdonald
GINGER falls into the category of foods that people either love or
loathe; there isn't usually any halfway mark for feelings towards
ginger. And I feel so sorry for those who don't like ginger.
In any of the three ways we can incorporate ginger into our cooking,
either fresh in its natural root form, powdered, or preserved in heavy
syrup, ginger is widely useful in recipes both sweet and savoury.
Twenty-two years ago when we first ran our home, Kinloch, as a hotel, it
would have been ludicrous even to contemplate buying fresh ginger. Yet
these days I can buy fresh ginger in the Co-op in Broadford -- a true
sign of the vastly improving availability of foodstuffs in the more
rural areas of Scotland.
Fresh ginger is one of the great pleasures of eating and cooking. With
a small knife I pare off its skin, chop it, or slice it into slivers --
the ginger should be crisp, not bendable, which means the ginger within
is fibrous. The freshness is denoted by crispness. In its raw state,
ginger is ferociously fiery and if you inadvertently rub an eye with a
finger unwashed since chopping ginger the agony is exquisite! But don't
be put off from using given amounts of fresh ginger in recipes, because
as soon as it starts to cook the ginger decreases in heat.
The combination of ginger and garlic in a simple vegetable stir-fry
lifts the overall flavour and makes a sumptuous dish from the most
ordinary vegetables.
As we approach winter, I use ginger in pretty well all root vegetable
soups and purees. It enhances the flavour of carrots, parsnips,
beetroot, leeks, and onions however they are served. Ginger is
surprisingly delicious with fish. Scallops, crab, and prawns are all
good briefly stir-fried with fresh ginger -- I give the chopped ginger
about 30 seconds in the saute pan before I add the scallops or prawns.
Ginger and leeks stir-fried with chunks of a firm-fleshed white fish
such as hake, or monkfish, make a quick and delicious, and low in
calories, dish. Ginger is just as good with meat. Pork, lamb, and beef
are all enhanced, in casserole form, with some chopped fresh ginger
cooked in with the other ingredients.
Ginger has valuable medicinal properties, too. Ginger is a great
antidote to nausea and sickness, and I was told that headaches could be
cured by putting a slice of raw ginger under your tongue. I tried it,
and all I can say is that the fiery ginger in your mouth certainly takes
your focus off the pain in your head!
But ginger is probably best known as an ingredient in sweet dishes.
Gingerbread has many variations -- for me, I like a moist and sticky
gingerbread, full of plump raisins and chopped preserved ginger. I like
a lemon water icing on gingerbread, too.
Ginger is so utterly delicious with orange and lemon, and with
chocolate. One of my favourite puddings is a vanilla ice-cream full of
chopped ginger (of the preserved sort) served with a warm dark chocolate
truffle sauce. We put powdered ginger into a pavlova mixture and put
whipped cream and grated dark chocolate on top. When rhubarb is in
season brown sugar meringues flavoured with powdered ginger and served
with sieved puree of rhubarb and orange make a most delicious pudding.
Recently, while staying overnight at the quite wonderful Marcliffe
Hotel outside Aberdeen -- for a lunch the next day commemorating the
500th anniversary of Aberdeen University -- the dessert was a summer
pudding served with a ginger-flavoured creme anglaise -- it was so good,
and whereas I would have put vanilla, or lemon and vanilla in the creme
anglaise I wouldn't have thought of ginger in connection with an
accompaniment for a summer pudding. It worked beautifully.
Ginger is wonderful in hot puddings. The recipe today is for one of
the best warm puddings I know. This recipe is simple to make, and if you
prepare it in a foil container, it freezes well, too. I serve it with
vanilla creme anglaise, or with creme fraiche. I realise that it sounds
odd to use tinned pears, but when I tried making it with ripe, fresh
pears it just wasn't the same at all.
Isobel Taylor, who gave me the recipe in the first place and who is
quite one of the best cooks I know, maintained all along that tinned
pears were mandatory, and she was right! But I buy those pears tinned in
natural juice, not in heavy syrup.
UPSIDE DOWN PEAR AND WALNUT GINGERBREAD PUDDING
Serves 5-6
4 oz flour sieved with
[1/2] teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
pinch of ground cloves and a grating of nutmeg
1 large egg
4 oz soft light or dark brown sugar
3 oz treacle
4 fl oz milk
2 oz butter, melted
For the topping:
2 oz butter
4 oz soft brown sugar
1 drained tin of pears
a few walnuts
Make the topping first -- melt the butter and sugar together and stir
for 1-2 minutes over gentle heat. Pour into an ovenproof dish and
arrange pears and walnuts over it. In a bowl, sieve the flour and the
dry ingredients. Mix together the egg, sugar, treacle, milk, and melted
butter and mix well. Spoon and scrape the mixture over the pears and
walnuts, smooth even, and bake in a moderate oven, 350[0]f, gas mark 4,
180[0]c for 40-50 minutes. Serve warm. Serve with either creme anglaise
or with whipped cream mixed with natural yoghurt, or with creme fraiche,
or a good vanilla ice-cream.

William Russell is delighted to make the acquaintance of a namesake at
a very quiet film festival near Venice.
THE programme in the Cinema Verdi in Pordenone had begun by the time I
arrived and there was nothing for it but to creep into the darkened
auditorium and hope for the best. I had, in fact, missed only the short
supporting feature, but since it was my first day at the silent film
festival I had no idea what the feature film I was going to see would
be, except that it had been directed by Henry King.
Pordenone, a handsome country town north of Venice, has for the past
14 years held the world's only festival of silent films and King, their
chosen director this year, although little known today, made some
memorable films in his time. They include the original version of the
celebrated melodrama, Stella Dallas, several Lillian Gish vehicles like
The White Sister and Romola, and a number of films starring Richard
Barthelmess whose career lasted until 1947 and the centenary of whose
birth the Festival was celebrating.
The King film I saw first, it turned out, was A Sporting Chance, a
comedy drama set in New York, made in 1918. It began, the title came up
and then followed the unforgettable words -- ''Starring William
Russell''.
They say that all critics are people who cannot who write about people
who can, and certainly the idea of seeing myself up there on the screen,
instead of Cruise or Clint, has its charms, even if it is only a pipe
dream. A Paul Newman I ain't. But here was one of us William Russells
who had made it, but who was he?
The silent cinema and its stars are largely forgotten today except for
a few barnstorming big films made by the likes of W D Griffiths or Cecil
B DeMille, films like Birth of a Nation or The Ten Commandments, and
players like Mary Pickford or Rudolph Valentino. If silent films are
remembered at all it is for the silent comedies, the films of Chaplin, a
comedian of genius no longer funny, and of Lloyd and Keaton, whose magic
has remained. But of the melodramas, the comedies, the westerns and the
thrillers little is known, and the impression persists of silent cinema
consisting of foolish films full of funny walks and people mugging
horribly on camera.
The reality is that it was not like that at all. Pictures were
beautifully composed and the director was king, moulding his stars'
performances. They do not mime. They talk. You just don't hear what they
say, although as the film goes on it ceases to matter.
It is not suprising that my namesake is unremembered. He was never the
biggest star in the Hollywood firmament, but he had a successful career,
particularly as a cowboy star, making some 50 films between 1910 and
1928, several of which he produced himself.
Actually William was not born Russell, but Leach, the Russell being
his mother's maiden name which he took when he followed her into the
theatre. He was born in New York in April 1886, and as a boy suffered
from TB of the hip, which led to his spending nine months in bed and
four years on crutches. To compensate he became a keen gymnast, turning
himself into a striking figure of a man -- he was 6ft 2ins tall -- who
was able to make a number of boxing pictures.
He started his career on Broadway, appearing with the likes of Ethel
Barrymore and Blanch Bates, before Vaudeville and then Hollywood
beckoned. He joined D W Griffiths' Biograph company and then American,
where he was successful enough to have his own production unit, working
regularly with King, and sometimes directing himself. In 1923 he went
freelance, and made his last film, Girls Go West in 1928, released in
March of that year, a month after he had died from pneumonia.
But he was not the only revelation. King was a director of substance
who made some fine films, two of which, Tol'able David (1921) and The
Seventh Day (1922) starred the young Richard Barthlemess, a heart-throb
of a juvenile lead if ever there was who appeared in Broken Blossoms for
Griffith. In the first film he is a young boy living in a small rural
town in America who has to face up to becoming a man when disaster
strikes his family and some violent, dangerous men threaten them.
In the second, set in a fishing town in Maine, he is a young sailor
who falls in love with a pretty rich girl who has arrived in a friend's
yacht with a party of friends for the weekend. The contrast between the
giddy lives of the foolish rich and those of the young man and his
sister is beuatifully drawn and King here and in Tol'able David shows
his fondness for the unspoiled scenery of his country.
But it is Barthlemess, twice Oscar nominated, one remembers. Although
his career continued after talking pictures -- he was in Howard Hawk's
Dawn Patrol and Only Angels Have Wings -- he was never as fully in
command of the screen again, and it is as a young man that he was at his
peak.
He died of cancer in 1963, having made his last film, Desert Fury,
directed by Lewis Allen, in 1947 in which he appeared with Mary Astor,
John Hodiak and Burt Lancaster.
The festival, held in October, is very much for film historians,
archivists and critics, although there is a strong local audience. It
shows the films as they should be seen, because with the best will in
the world, television screenings do not do them justice. One needs the
right size of screen, the right live piano accompaniment.
Indeed in the latter respect Pordenone does them more than justice. In
the silent days the pit pianist often had a very dodgy view of the
screen. Today the film is shown on a television monitor on top of the
grand piano before the pianist's very eyes!
The silent cinema was truly international. Language did not exist so
there was no language barrier. All a distributor had to do was change
the captions, which is one reason why the archives of countries behind
the now vanished Iron Curtain have been yielding suprises. Pordenone had
one this year, the first showing of a newly rediscovered film made by
Ernst Lubitsch, the man famed for his ''touch'' in Hollywood as a
director, which revealed him to have been a comedian of natural charm
and inventiveness in his own right.
Maybe there is only room for one in the world, but with Cinema 100
coming up next year surely somebody -- the Edinburgh Film festival
perhaps, -- will remember to show some of the silent films, not just the
inevitable classics, and not just a one-off gala, but some of the
everyday films on which the foundations of the cinema rest.
To be fully appreciated several need to be seen in succession, because
there is an imaginative leap to make. Once made they register as
strongly today as they did when they were made more than 80 years ago.
There is also much to be gained from seeing someone like the young Gary
Cooper, a silent star at the outset of his career, in the full bloom of
youth.
The Film festival or GFT and Filmhouse should take up the challenge.
Cinema 100 has plenty of plans, but they do not exactly set the pulses
racing in anticipation. We shall, however, see what we shall see. But
let there be some silent films shown, preferably starring William
Russell, to mark the birth of an art form, and why not in Scotland?
Pordenone would no doubt be willing to advise.

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A SEAMAN.
Admiral Lord Cochrane.
Constable, #16.95.
HEROES and hero-worship are not much in vogue, to the regret of
certain true blues recently. Thomas Cochrane was a hero ''from boyhood
devoted to England and Fame'' as a popular song put it (though he was
born a Scot, heir to the impoverished ninth Earl of Dundonald). As a
young naval officer in the Nelson era he harried French ships and
coastal ports in escapades of dashing brilliance, and then, after
falling foul of the authorities -- ''I always had a habit of speaking my
mind'' -- earned honours as a victorious mercenary admiral in the
service of various South American navies.
His exploits found their way into the fiction of his former shipmate
and midshipman Captain Marryat and lent substance to the novels of C S
Forrester.
When he was 85, in 1860, soured by the memory of past brushes with his
seniors and the neglect he believed had resulted from their envy and bad
faith, he published a two-volume autobiography which settled old scores.
This is volume one, a reprinted facsimile with a short introduction by
the naval historian Tom Pocock which holds out more promise than
Cochrane's often dry account can deliver.
Cochrane first commanded the sloop Speedy, which hardly lived up to
her name (and was so small he had to stick his head out of the cabin
skylight in order to shave) in which he had many successes against
larger and more powerful enemy ships. He gives a racy summary of the
cruise but interest wanes as the focus shifts to political campaigning
ashore and a bald narrative of later adventures in the Mediterranean.
Sea terms are unexplained (off Majorca ''we captured a settee''),
events are not put in context, people and places occur without helpful
introduction. Passages in French are untranslated. There is no index.
There are no pictures apart from the original frontispiece showing
Cochrane in old age, long after the events he describes, and for some
reason the cover illustrates an engagement in which Cochrane took no
part involving ships in which he never served.
What may have satisfied the reader in 1860 won't do now. A good case
might have been made for an edited selection from all Cochrane's works
(volume two of the autobiography describes his efforts to convince the
Admiralty of the efficacy of his plans for a secret weapon, ''sulphur
ships'' -- in effect poison gas) including his narrative of services in
Chile, Peru and Brazil.
But this is makeshift. Little effort has been involved and no doubt
the publishers found it cheap to produce -- not that the price reflects
it.

A THOUSAND DAYS OF MAGIC.
Oleg Cassini. Rizzoli, #27
SHE was a woman who, early on in life, found a certain style which so
became her she stayed loyal to it for three decades; that look of
exquisite simplicity only afforded to the rich. But during Jacqueline
Kennedy's residency at the White House she received the unstinting
devotion of a man who was not her husband: Oleg Cassini, the architect
of her fashion distinction.
National sentiment and pride demanded she didn't squander the public
purse on foreign designers, but in Cassini Jackie had found an emigre
who could enhance her ''American wardrobe'' with a certain European
chic.
Born a Czarist count, raised in Italy, and matured in Hollywood as a
costume designer, Cassini was the nearest thing to a Yankee Givenchy.
The understated grace of his commissions for her at the start of the
sixties possessed the aura of Parsian couture, but the clothes still
achieved a New World casualness and lack of fuss.
Her social secretary informed Women's Wear Daily that Cassini's
outfits would indeed be ''made and designed in America'', adding that
Mrs Kennedy ''will buy what is necessary without extravagance''.
Cassini, now in his seventies, has published a memoir of that time
which brought adulation to the First Lady, and enabled him, from his New
York studio, to shape the style of women throughout the Western world.
He calls his book A Thousand Days of Magic, offering a touching
tribute to that ill-starred, privileged life, and fills his
recollections with many of the photographs and fashion drawings which
genuinely did bewitch a generation.
Far more subtle than the public uniforms of the Princess of Wales,
Cassini's designs did make Jackie Kennedy a similar icon, then fame
rendered them a cliche. Yet in death she still triumphs over the
obsessive raking through her Camelot years because inscrutability was
her surest asset.
For exactly 30 years the high-cheekboned handsomeness and wide,
unchanging smile endured the tresspassing zoom lens, never giving any
inner-self away. It is that mysterious, silent poise we remember, as
much as the clothes.

OLD SCORES. Frederic Raphael
Orion, #15.99.
RACHEL Stannard is the thread. She is Pansy's plain but clever sister,
never quite a wallflower, but ''a worthy disappointment'' which makes
her more dutiful. ''Pansy was lovely; I, it seemed was loving.''
Rachel became her sister's minder, buying their parents' birthday
presents and enduring a social life with men who wanted access to Pansy.
She became a trustworthy, reliable and indispensable flatmate.
Anxious to avoid the possibility of being discovered a virgin on her
wedding night, she loses herself with Roley, who isn't up to much; but
none of the men are any good. They are sexually useless, obsessed with
themselves, their money, and position.
Worst of all is Roger Raikes, whom Rachel marries to shock her
friends. Roger is an estate agent, who seems to have enjoyed the 1980s
boom but is finding it tough in times of recession. He loses Rachel's
money in a deal that was bad enough for him to do a moonlight flit to
France.
Rachel is now a successful journalist. Without thinking, she follows
her husband to the Dordogne. This is not entirely in keeping with her
character, but what we have seen has hardly matched her descriptions of
herself. Rather than a solitary and misguided active impetuosity, this
is perhaps an escape, abandoning a country and society to which she
never felt attached.
It is such an important, pivotal point, essential to understand in the
light of what follows, that a further explanation would have been
helpful. She could just as easily have stayed at home with the security
she had known. But her reasons for going are essential to the plot.
Frederic Raphael has written celebrated scripts for film and
television. Here he almost says something about a part of our society
which has long felt under siege, nearly approaches a metaphor for
present day Britain extended to a European context, where layers of the
past are lifted and the scabs exposed.
But he swings between first and third-person narratives, uses letters
and diaries to tell a story which changes direction with each new text.
It seems like two distinct and separate novels with Rachel holding both
in the balance.
Life in the Dordogne turns sour when Pansy arrives in flight from her
husband, closely followed by Rogers former finance director, her
accomplice-turned-victim, freed from prison and looking for his money,
complete with tattoos and a homosexual lover.
When all looks set for a comedy of manners with a dash of Joe Orton,
Raphael abandons plot and characters and begins a separate story,
leaving the empty beginning behind, sending Rachel in pursuit of love
and truth.
She has received a call from her editor, asking her to track down and
interview Lionel Cator, a Resistance hero whose wife has just died in
Paris. His story dominates the book and makes us wonder if the first
section is there because Raphael had written it. The real story is told
in a memoir Cator has conveniently written and in Rachel's letters,
which gives an odd perspective on wartime betrayal and romance,
especially when accompanied by the growing tale of Rachel's love for a
man old enough to be her grandfather.
Raphael has an irritating habit of introducing characters we do not
know and switching from direct to indirect speech, which adds to the
narrative's uneasy feel, increasing a growing sense of annoyance with a
story which is neither credible nor complete.

GAVIN Hastings, who has set the cat among the pigeons with the
revelations in his new autobiography, figured in another book yesterday
but it was one which he knew nothing about and which had about the same
effect as a Jonah Lomu tackle.
The former Scotland captain was confronted at Murrayfield by Michael
Aspel and his Big Red Book as the subject for a forthcoming edition of
the This is Your Life TV show.
Hastings, 33, who retired from international rugby after leading
Scotland to the World Cup in South Africa last summer, thought he was
going to Murrayfield for a meeting with SRU rector of rugby Jim Telfer
and to watch a squad session.
Thames Television spokeswoman Kate Croft confirmed Hastings had been
the show's latest ''victim.''

THE Bristol and Scotland prop Alan Sharp has turned his back on
Scotland because of a club versus country conflict and increasing family
and work commitments.
Sharp, 27, who qualifies for Scotland through an Arbroath grandparent,
has played six times for Scotland.
It was announced he had pulled out of the Scotland A side to play
Western Samoa tomorrow because of a groin strain. It emerged yesterday
the reason was more complex.
Sharp, who will play for Bristol against Wasps today, said: ''I just
can't give the time and commitment.''
* SCOTTISH international squad members will have contracts issued over
the weekend.

<HEADLINE>Farry moves to tackle Everton chairman's charge. Agreement should rule out a Ferguson review</HEADLINE>

EVERTON will be breaking an agreement signed by themselves, the FA,
Premiership, SFA, and Rangers if they go ahead with their intention to
take football's governing body in Scotland to court over the Duncan
Ferguson affair.
Reacting to the club chairman's declaration that he would be seeking a
judicial review in Edinburgh, SFA chief executive Jim Farry, for the
first time, last night revealed the existence of a document which was
signed by all parties to allow the Merseyside club to complete the
transfer of Ferguson from Rangers last December.
''The clearance document made it plain that the player had still to
appear before an appeals tribunal and that all parties would accept the
decision of that tribunal as binding, and would implement it,'' said
Farry.
In effect, the SFA only permitted the international striker to leave
Ibrox for Goodison Park on the understanding, accepted by all the
relevant parties, that the appeal decision would not be challenged.
''We have had no indication from the FA that one of their member clubs
is planning to take any action,'' said Farry, ''and it should be noted
that Everton are bound by the rules which FIFA have laid down and are
accepted by the FA.
''Football's view is that football should try to resolve these matters
itself, and ideally not involve the judiciary. However, I want to make
it clear that we have nothing to hide, and if required would be pleased
to place our papers in the possession of the parties in a judicial
review.''
Ferguson's appeal against his 12-match suspension was for head-butting
John McStay of Raith Rovers in April, 1994, was rejected by the
independent tribunal which met on Wednesday. The player, who is serving
a three-month sentence in Barlinnie as a result of a court case
following that incident, will not be available to play for his club
until January 20.
Everton chairman Peter Johnson, who was angry at the failure of the
tribunal to reduce or even remove the suspension in light of the
player's jail sentence, said that the club believes there is a case for
''double jeopardy.''
''We requested a judicial review as we do not believe people should be
punished twice,'' said Johnson. ''We feel the Scottish FA would have
been far better taking the original advice, which was to wait and see
what the courts handed down.
''As long as our request for a judicial review is granted, and we can
see no reason why it will not be, it will be heard in Edinburgh. Either
they'll have the review very quickly before he's out of jail, or they'll
ask the Scottish FA to suspend the ban until they can hear the judicial
review.''
However, Farry pointed out that the SFA had followed procedure to the
letter throughout the case, including postponing the appeal until the
court action was known. The agreement to accept the appeal findings is
lodged with all of the signatories.
The SFA also are convinced that, as they actually suspended the player
before any intervention by the courts, that they are not entitled to be
accused of adding their own punishment to the court decision.
It now remains to be seen if Everton will pursue their action and it
may be that pressure from the FA and the Premiership will be brought to
bear on the Liverpool club, especially after the revelation from Farry
that they signed an agreement to stand by the adjudication of the
appeals truibunal.
In any case, it might be in Ferguson's interest if the matter was let
drop and he was removed, at last temporarily, from the spotlight.

HE WAS the Player of the Year last season, a star turn who enthralled
many beyond the confines of Ibrox, but Brian Laudrup has been very much
a player in waiting this season, having made only six appearances in a
Rangers shirt.
The end of his exile because of injury is in sight, however, and it
looks as if his club could be planning to spring their Danish
internationalist into the Old Firm spotlight when the teams meet
tomorrow week at Ibrox.
Assistant manager Archie Knox, deputising for flu victim Walter Smith
(''he is doubtful for tomorrow''), revealed the surprising game plan
when he talked of the winger's progress since he was injured and missed
the second half of the Champions' League game against Borussia Dortmund
in Glasgow on September 27. ''Next Sunday is his target,'' said Knox.
''Hopefully we will get a few practice games into him next week.
''There is a reserve match but I don't think he will play in that but
he will get a fair bit of football with a view to th Old Firm game. He
is training again and looking good.''
The news will be welcomed by the Ibrox fans who have not been quite as
animated without the sight of their Danish star twisting and turning his
way into the heart of defences and, if he does return and comes through
well, it would mean he should be in good fettle to help the European
cause against Steaua Bucharest three days later.
The likelihood is that the striker will be accompanied by another key
figure in goalkeeper Andy Goram who is also much better after his more
recent injury against Juventus last month.
Stuart McCall comes back to support Paul Gascoigne, who has been
training with the England squad before returning to join the Ibrox gang
last night, in midfield for the game against Aberdeen at Ibrox this
afternoon.
Ally McCoist, who has scored a few times against the northern lights,
will make his 500th appearance in a Rangers jersey.
The club received news from UEFA yesterday that Alex Cleland, who was
sent off against Juventus in Italy, will be suspended for one further
game, the match with Steaua Bucharest at Ibrox. Cleland automatically
missed the return with Juventus.
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken agrees with Knox that the outcome will not
be conclusive in the championship sense either way but admits that
Rangers' start in their title defence has been most impressive.
''There has been criticism of their performances in Europe but no one
can criticise the way they have handled themselves on the domestic
front.
Aitken, making his first appearance at Ibrox as the Pittodrie manager,
is awaiting fitness tests on Scott Booth and Stephen Glass before naming
his team.
Celtic will be anxious to take advanatage of any slip-up by the
leaders at Ibrox when they travel to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle
who were denied a game when the Easter Road floodlights failed on
Wednesday. Manager Tommy Burns has added Malcolm Mackay to the squad
which will be missing two men on international duty, Pat Bonner and Rudi
Vata.
The chances are that Peter Grant, who missed out in the no-scoring
draw with Raith Rovers because of blistered heels, will be back.
Thistle, whose manager Murdo MacLeod has been trying hard to swing a
swop deal to freshen up his pool, will have Tommy Turner back after flu.
MacLeod is also considering a place for 19-year-old forward Charlie
Adams.
Hibs, lying handily behind the top two, have not won at Falkirk since
1992, but they are going well enough this year to be confident of ending
that lean spell. They will be unchanged.
Hearts' two foreigners, Pasquale Bruno and Hans Eskilsson, are set to
play the last of their trial period against Kilmarnock at Tynecastle and
afterwards will discuss signing for a longer stay with manager Jim
Jefferies. Dave McPherson is still out.
Killie, who were apparently unfortunate to go down to Rangers in
midweek, could prove formidable opponents for the Edinburgh side.
Motherwell will wait for checks on Andy Roddie and Eddie May before
their side to meet Raith Rovers at Stark's Park is decided.

Norman Dugdale, CB, civil servant and poet; born, Burnley, February 6,
1921, died, Belfast, October 27, 1995
NORMAN Dugdale was the kind of character these days less often found
in Whitehall than in Edinburgh or Belfast. He was a scholar and a
gentleman; a meticulous public servant who wrote lyric poetry in his
non-too-abundant spare time.
A native of Lancashire, he was educated at Burnley Grammar School, and
at Manchester University where his contemporaries were the novelist
Anthony Burgess and the scholar Frank Kermode.
Dugdale's public career was that of a senior civil servant in Northern
Ireland. He will be most notably remembered in that sphere because of
his work with the DHSS. He was involved particularly in engaging general
practitioners, hospitals, and social workers in a total administrative
framework. But all that time he was quietly writing and, as history
turns out, it is likely to be his words rather than his actions that
will be remembered.
One of his junior colleagues, an aspirant writer himself, introduced
Dugdale into a highly active writer's group functioning in Belfast and
loosely associated with Queen's University.
This was in the early 1960s. There he found himself among writers, 15
to 20 years younger than himself, household names now but in those days
just starting out on their reputations.
It must have taken courage to read out poems to the like of Seamus
Heaney, Michael Longley, and Bernard McLaverty. But Dugdale's innate
gentleness and courtesy saw him through.
His poems reflected the man. One poem he read at the group
particularly found favour. It was called The Disposition of the Weather
and began:
My landscape turns to winter everywhere.
The seaboard stony, mountainous, is worn
By wind and rain as men are worn by time,
Bones sticking through the skin. Gaunt cliffs there,
Eyeless, towering Lears, confront the west
While the sea's hounds yelp and snarl about their feet . . .
This was published as it stands, in his first book, A Prospect of the
West (1970). The poem is about stoicism in the face of age and
adversity. Certainly Dugdale had need of the quality he celebrated. His
health was fragile most of his life owing to chest trouble, and latterly
he suffered from diabetes. With all this, he published six volumes of
verse and rose to be Permanent Secretary of his department.
His efforts in that direction were recognised by the award of the CB
and his other life, as a poet, was honoured by a D Litt from the
University of Ulster. In his third collection, Running Repairs (1983),
he looks ironically at his woeful condition:
Here we go again: pulse, temperature,
Blood tests, blood-pressure, samples of urine,
X-ray, electrocardiogram . . .
But he had stoicism to form the base from which he mocked at the
television litterateurs of the day --
Crammed bum and belly into crotch-tight jeans,
By far the hairiest of the panel
of Show-biz tarts and talkative old queans.

THE transfer saga of Derek McInnes, which almost has turned into a
soap opera over the past three weeks, looks as though it will stage the
final episode within the next couple of days.
True to all such convoluted story lines, there's still a twist in the
tail. His club, Morton, and his life-long heroes, Rangers, finally
agreed a fee yesterday -- it is reckoned to be around the #450,000 mark,
less than the Greenock side wanted -- but since Ibrox manager Walter
Smith is sidelined with flu, personal negotiations may not go ahead
until Monday.
This means that 24-year-old midfielder McInnes will make yet another
swan-song, this time against promotion rivals Dundee at Dens Park today.
Morton manager Allan McGraw said yesterday: ''The clubs have agreed a
fee, although it has been decided no figure will be revealed. With
Walter being ill, personal negotiations may be held up until Monday.
Derek is still a Morton player, and unless he and Rangers sort things
out by tomorrow morning, he will play at Dundee.''
And McGraw added with feeling: ''I'm just glad, especially for the lad
who has given us nine years of excellent service, that the matter looks
as though it finally will be resolved.''
Meanwhile, Dens Park will be a water-shed in more ways than one. Apart
from the transfer wrangle over McInnes almost being over, the Greenock
side will have the chance to show further that their exciting style of
football can stand the test of a coast-to-coast day out.
And who knows, by 4.45pm, one of these exciting first-division sides
could be top of the league. It's that close, with only two points
separating the top four.
Dundee manager Jim Duffy has plenty on his mind -- not least an injury
worry over striker George Shaw -- with two important league games
against Morton and local rivals Dundee United, and then that Coca-Cola
Cup final at Hampden on November 26.
''It's good that we have two tough games before Hampden,'' he said.
''It gives the players plenty to think about before a cup final. It
should be an interesting couple of weeks.''
Leaders Dunfermline have winger Allan Moore out injured, which means a
full debut for Finnish internationalist defender Kari Rissannen against
Clydebank at Kilbowie. Another boost will be the return of midifielder
Craig Robertson.
Bankies have not played for 10 days, when their six-game, unbeaten run
was brought to a halt by second-placed Dundee United. Scott Murdoch and
Colin Sutherland will be back, but striker Ken Eadie is doubtful because
of flu.
Dundee United, in second place on goal difference, are determined to
put aside their Challenge Cup defeat on penalties, but their visit to
Love Street to face a St Mirren side growing in confidence will not be
easy.
Although manager Jimmy Bone as Jim Dick suspended, he will play Martin
Baker, back after a five-game suspension, and Barry Lavety from the
start.
St Johnstone are desperate to follow up their victory at Dumbarton
last week with another three points against bottom-club Hamilton.
Midfielder Gary Farquhar and John McQuillen are out injured, and as
assistant-manager John Blackley said: ''These are the games we must
win.''
Hamilton have Stephen McInulty available after suspension, but doubts
over Steven McCormick, Gary Clark, Craig Paterson, and Paul McKenzie.
Airdrie, with Paul Jack still out, have a home match against a
Dumbarton side who have Hugh Burns still suspended.

Brigadier ''Mike'' Wingate Gray, OBE, MC; born July 17, 1921, died
November 3, 1995
WITH the death of Mike Wingate Gray, the Black Watch has lost one of
its most gallant and illustrious members. He is equally mourned by the
SAS to which he gave such great service towards the end of his very full
career.
He was born into a military family, educated at Wellington College,
and joined the Black Watch in 1941. He went with the Highland Division
to the desert and took part in all its battles from Alamein, through
North Africa, Sicily, and North West Europe. During that time he won the
Military Cross twice, firstly in Gerbini, in Sicily, where he charged a
German machine-gun post standing up in a carrier firing a bren gun from
his shoulder.
The second was on in October, 1944, at Dunkirk where he negotiated a
ceasefire between the British, German, and French to enable some 20,000
civilians and German wounded to be evacuated.
Apart from his proven gallantry he was a master linguist and could
speak Russian, French, and Germany fluently.
His service after the war continued with the Black Watch in Germany
and British Guyana, interspersed with staff jobs, one of which was on
the staff of Bernard Fergusson during the Suez crisis of 1956.
In 1963 he took the massed band of the Black Watch to tour the US.
Shortly after it played on the White House lawn, President Kennedy was
assassinated. His widow asked for Black Watch pipers to play at his
funeral.
On return from America, he started his service with the SAS,
commanding the regiment from 1964 to 1967 with squadrons deployed in
Borneo, Aden, and Radfan. For this he was awarded the OBE. He concluded
his military career as military attache in Paris after a tour as the
deputy fortress commander of Gilbraltar.
He retired in 1973. Apart from being both physically and mentally
tough, Mike had enormous charm. He was never too serious and could
always see the light side of any crisis. The Jocks all adored him, they
knew his reputation and even the most awkward would respond to his
leadership.
He led with style, totally unpompously, and by example. He loved a
party and alcohol appeared to have no effect on him. His enormous
popularity won him many friends from all walks of life.
After retirement, he dabbled in boat-building and for a time worked
for a security firm providing protection for VIPs. But his real passion
was sailing. For many years he kept a boat in the Mediterranean and he
knew all the best watering-holes around its rim.
He was a great supporter of everything to do with the Black Watch and
could always be seen at reunions and dinners. He took part in the 50th
anniversary VJ Day parade in London, albeit in a wheelchair. By then his
health was failing despite major heart surgery some years ago.
To everyone in the Black Watch and the SAS he was a friend. He had no
enemies and I never heard anyone speak ill of him. The world seems a
poorer and duller place without him.
* Appreciation by Col Robert Gurdon, regimental secretary, the Black
Watch.

THE clubs in the bottom half of the league certainly have not been
dragging their feet when it comes to ground improvements. Stranraer, for
example, will hansel a #1m, 2800-seater stand today for the home game
against nearest neighbours Queen of the South.
Only four points off a promotion place and unbeaten at Stair Park,
Stranraer will hope to make progress up the table this afternoon, even
allowing for the local derby nature of this contest.
Manager Alex McAnespie has agreed to listen to offers for want-away
pair, striker Billy Ferguson and midfielder Tommy Callaghan, and
probably would welcome a swop deal in order to maintain his overall
playing strength. If, instead, money comes into the club, he will renew
interest in Clydebank defender Derek Crawford. It is not a case of a
totally happy house either for Queens, whose unsettled midfielder Andy
McFarlane has refused to sign any more month-to-month deals for Billy
McLaren.
Berwick are in second place but, if home manager Tom Hendrie is to be
believed, Clyde may be an excellent away bet when they visit Shielfield.
Hendrie has eight senior players on the injured list, including his
entire defence.
Meanwhile, leaders East Fife visit winless Montrose and are likely to
ensure that keeper Dave Larter's 350th appearance for the Angus team is
not at all comfortable.
Stirling will attempt to put Challenge Cup winners Stenhousemuir in
their place when they meet at Forthbank, while Ayr will attempt to
maintain their decent away record and move off second-bottom place by
winning at Forfar.
Third division leaders Livingston will at last play at their new home,
Almondvale Stadium, when they entertain East Stirlingshire, although the
official opening will remain next week's home match with Cowdenbeath.
The 'Shire may be bottom of the division but they are capable of being
party-poopers this afternoon.
Dingwall should stage the match of the day in the basement when Ross
County play host to Brechin City.

* KEITH'S Andy Lavelle is out to prove his cup final back luck is in
the past in today's Qualifying Cup decider against Fraserburgh.
Lavelle lines up against his old club looking for glory after having
ended up on the losing side on five previous Highland finals.
''I hope the manager doesn't take my record to heart,'' said Lavelle.
''Talk of a jinx is nonsense -- and I believe we will prove that against
Fraserburgh.''
Manager Jim Hamilton has worked hard to improve standards at Kynoch
Park, and a cup final triumph would be a big reward after last year's
penalties defeat against Huntly.
Keith will be out to avoid penalties this time around -- Fraserburgh
have won through the last two rounds on shoot-outs.
Keith's big match doubts are Scott Taylor (groin strain and flu) and
Ian Woolley (thigh knock). ''We will give the pair every chance and
leave a decision till the very last minute,'' said Hamilton.
''When our first-choice side has been disrupted this season, our form
has suffered.''
Fraserburgh have no such worries, but will be concerned about a lapse
in form which saw them scrape a draw with Forres last weekend.

THE REDRESS OF POETRY: OXFORD LECTURES.
Seamus Heaney Faber, #15.99
IN a collection called Station Island (1984) Seamus Heaney, brought up
as a Catholic in a Protestant town in Northern Ireland, looks back, but
not in anger: ''I have no mettle for the angry role . . . I come from
County Derry, born in earshot of a Hibernian hall . . . all that. And
always, always, Orange drums. And neighbours on the roads at night with
guns.''
Heaney knows how positive Irish pride is poisoned by negative Irish
prejudice. The art of Heaney is a balancing act.
From Mossbawn, County Derry, he subsequently moved to Dublin but
resisted the temptation to write narrowly sectarian verse. Towards the
end of The Redress of Poetry he eschews any sectarian cause and makes a
case for being in two minds: ''There is nothing extraordinary about the
challenge to be in two minds. If, for example, there was something
exacerbating, there was still nothing deleterious to my sense of
Irishness in the fact that I grew up in the minority in Northern Ireland
and was educated within the dominant British culture.''
His Irishness is no sense of dogmatic identity but a sense of
suffering along with folk conditioned to believe they are destined to
die for dogma. In ''Whatever You Say Say Nothing'' he said: ''Is there a
life before death? That's chalked up/In Ballymurphy. Competence with
pain,/Coherent miseries, a bite and sup,/We hug our little destiny
again.''
Being in two minds he has sympathy for both sides which is why some
think he won the 1995 Nobel Prize for Literature as part of the peace
process. Heaney's poetry is a plea for tolerance and a rejection of
propaganda.
Likewise his prose. Famous Seamus was Professor of Poetry at Oxford
between 1989 and 1994: this engaging book collects 10 of the 15 lectures
he delivered. Heaney engages with the power of poetry to redress the
wrongs of life as he reflects on political commitment and associated
issues.
He is constitutionally opposed to propaganda, lamenting the literary
tragedy of Oscar Wilde by accusing that tragic figure of abandoning his
aesthetic principles and becoming, in ''The Ballad of Reading Gaol'', a
''propagandist poet . . . embracing in the end a fervent rhetorical mode
of writing which was bound to be artistically deleterious. Rather unfair
that. Wilde was right to write propaganda about his life of hell in
prison.
In ''Poetry and Propaganda'', MacDiarmid concluded: ''In short, any
utterance that is not pure/Propaganda is impure propaganda for sure.''
Heaney argues that MacDiarmid was a poet of genius who once wrote
compassionate poems in Scots and English then disastrously turned on his
own talent by churning out ''increasingly propagandist'' poems in a
language he designed to exclude all who disagreed with a savagely
Scotocentric view of the world.
Heaney approaches MacDiarmid as a man who suffered from ''poetric
megalomania'' -- a self-styled God who ultimately failed by exchanging
poetic creativity for crude propaganda.
This interesting analysis makes the common mistake of supposing the
mature MacDiarmid had a mind closed to everything but his own ego. Not
so. He remained open to experience. He publicly said he hated the
English but welcomed English visitors, Colin Wilson and Arnold Wesker
and others, to his home.
He publicly said he had no time for religion but once claimed to be a
Catholic and, in conversation at the end of his life, liked to stress
the spiritual qualities of his work by approvingly quoting Dylan Thomas
who reckoned his own poems were written ''for the love of Man and in
praise of God, and I'd be a damn fool if they weren't''.
Discussing the poetry of Thomas, Heaney finds a simple soul he
associates with a ''longed-for, prelapsarian wholeness, a state of the
art where the autistic and the acoustic were extensive and coterminous,
where the song of the self was effortlessly choral and its scale was a
perfect measure and match for the world it sang in''.
Well said, though the concept of Thomas as a singing fool, whose work
suffered when he consciously thought about his craft rather than
innocently expressing his sullen art, is simplistic.
Heaney recalls being enchanted by the innocence of Thomas when, as a
young man daft about Dylan, he intoned: ''I see the boys of summer in
their ruin/Lay the gold tithings barren . . .'' First printed in 1934,
Thomas's lyric may be no naive emotional outburst but a crafty poem of
protest about unemployment in Wales. Thomas wrote several subtly
political poems in the 1930s -- witness the one beginning ''The hand
that signed the paper felled a city'' -- and Heaney should have conceded
that Thomas was a more complicated poet than the one he presents as a
poetic pet.
On Yeats, Heaney is excellent, amusingly observing how the other Irish
poet combined everyday affairs with an interest in the afterlife:
''Yeats was always passionately beating on the wall of the physical
world in order to provoke an answer from the other side.''
So Yeats was always in two minds and, undoubtedly, this accounts for
the terrible beauty of his poetry. Heaney contrasts Yeats with Larkin,
who professed to have no time for the spiritual patter of Yeats,
preferring to cast a cold eye on his own life which he regarded with
despair as he declined physically. However, reading between the lines of
Larkin's poems, there is profound spirituality as moving as anything in
Yeats. Yeats and Larkin were, creatively, two of a kind.
Many will read this book not as an expression of Heaney's interest in
other poets but as an important insight into his own work. The last
lecture in The Redress of Poetry develops Heaney's idea of himself as an
''Irish writer responsive to two cultural milieux''.
In 1981 a hunger striker died in the Maze Prison. Heaney was friendly
with the young man's family from County Derry but not willing to attend
the young man's wake: ''I would have been wary of the political
implications of attendance''. Only in Ireland could a poet be so
prominent as Famous Seamus.
Heaney praises poetry as a principle of integration in the Irish
context of division and contradiction: ''I wanted to affirm that within
our individual selves we can reconcile two orders of knowledge.'' He
concludes by quoting one of his own poems, a section from a sequence
from Seeing Things (1991); a little vision of a spiritual voyage.
Heaney's poems are full of such visions, his prose is occasionally
pompous, but then he is speaking as a Professor of Poetry and as a poet
who knows himself.
One example of pomposity: ''When I wrote about a Presbyterian farmer
standing in the yard at night, not going in to his Catholic neighbours'
house until he heard them finish their prayers part of my pleasure was
in thinking that the subject had not, as far as I knew, been treated in
a poem (honouring) Protestant and Catholic in harmony''.
Heaney has a high opinion of his work and no wonder. He is, at his
best, a wonderful poet with a great hunger to show Protestant and
Catholic in harmony. All who love his poems will like these lectures,
self-righteous as they often are.

AS Scottish sport unveiled ambitious plans for developing world-class
excellence yesterday, on the second day of a two-day conference at
Gleneagles, Craig Brown confirmed the Scottish Football Association's
willingness to participate in revolutionary joint co-operative ventures.
The Scottish Sports Council initiative, backed by International
Distillers, will lead to the launch of either one national centre of
excellence, or a series of sub-national centres.
Brown revealed that the latter could include a #15m network of five
3000-spectator capacity indoor sports halls, with full-size football
pitches, which the SFA would like to see used by a range of sports, on
the continental model.
''We spoke some time ago to the Norwegian FA and have been sent
architects' plans of the halls they use,'' said Brown.
''We have applied for Milleniumn funding of #3m to build one on the
same style. If successful, we'd like to see five of these across
Scotland.
''Norway has a similar network of about eight halls, with more in the
pipeline. We envisage sharing with sports such as hockey and athletics,
which clearly need similar indoor facilities.
''People criticise Scottish players for being deficient in skills. It
is hard to practise these in appalling weather wearing two tracksuits
and a wet suit.
''These centres would be a step towards addressing this problem.''

ENGLISH FA officials have withdrawn their #118.5m television offer to
the Football League after clubs failed to meet the deadline for a
decision.
The 72 Endsleigh League chairmen met in London yesterday to discuss
the five-year offer by the FA, and a rival bid from the Premier League.
The FA had already given them a two-week extension to reach a verdict,
but the Football League again failed to decide between the two options.
And the FA's director of public affairs, David Davies, confirming that
the deal had been scrapped, said: ''It's deeply disappointing that,
after almost six months of debate with the League's representatives, a
request for still more time should be made. Well, it isn't available.''
He added: ''The commercial implications of a unique and lucrative deal
that was offered to the League means that an extension is not desirable.
One extension has already come and gone. We have always made it clear we
are not prepared to enter into any form of auction that might follow a
succession of deadline extensions.
''It is for the League to decide whether they want to try to re-open
negotiations at some point. But they must know that there can be no
guarantees about any deal that might be available. For the moment the
matter is closed.''
The Football League Board went into session after today's meeting, at
which they recommended to clubs that a decision on the TV matter should
be put on hold.
The clubs unanimously accepted that advice and, in response the the
FA's action, League president Gordon McKeag said: ''The Football League
are disappointed but not entirely surprised by the FA's decision. But we
find it encouraging that the door remains open with the FA.
The FA's offer was worth #18.5m to the League for 1996-97 and #25m per
annum for the four years after that, but there were certain aspects that
concerned the Lytham St Annes hierarchy.
They include the signing over of all control of their commercial
properties -- a clause that has not been mentioned in terms of the
Premier League bid.

THE Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland is to consider the issue
of medals won by athletes who are involved in drug abuse.
This news, and hardening opinion expressed yesterday by the body
responsible for advising on records, will force the Scottish Athletic
Federation council to reconsider their decision, announced earlier this
week, to take no action on the Drew McMaster drugs issue.
Colin McEachran, QC, former shooting medallist who chairs the Games
council, said: ''It is for SAF to decide what to do regarding their
records, but I am surprised. The Scottish Games Council will discuss
this next month.''
He believes introducing a rule imposing forfeiture of medals on people
subsequently proved to have cheated is worth considering. But he thinks
that 17 years after the event it may be difficult to impose on McMaster
and David Jenkins, both self-confessed drug-users who helped Scotland's
1978 sprint relay team to gold. He was concerned to learn that proximity
to this time was a yardstick for current selection.
George Spence, chairman of the records sub-committee of SAF, confirmed
yesterday that he and his colleagues voted unanimously to annul the
Scottish 4 x 100m time of 39.24sec, which won gold at the Edmonton
Commonwealth Games, following McMaster's admissions in a Sunday
newspaper.
''I'm aware of the SAF council decision, but we will not be altering
our minute,'' said Spence. ''It is wrong that future Scottish athletes
should be asked to judge themselves against drug-assisted performances,
especially when trying to qualify for international team places.''
George Duncan, convenor of the 18-strong SAF track and field
commissision which will vote on the matter on December 6, said they had
always previously endorsed recommendations by the records sub committee.
''This will be thoroughly considered,'' said Duncan. ''It will not be
brushed under the carpet.''
If they reject the recommendation to wipe out the record, Spence does
not rule out resignations by the three-member group.
Brian Samson, director of operations for the The Scottish Sports
Council which funds SAF, said they would not interfere in the internal
affairs of a governing body, but added: ''Under no circumstances do we
condone the use of banned substances.''
If the flawed record is deleted, the official mark would be the 39.56
set by Elliot Bunney, Ian Mackie, Jamie Henderson, and Doug Walker when
finishing fifth at last year's Games in Victoria.

INTER-MILAN coach Roy Hodgson last night claimed that Paul Ince,
rumoured to be about to return to England after three troubled months in
Italy, was staying at the club.
''We have Paul Ince who is staying with us,'' he said, in response to
questions about failed attempts to sign Swedish internationalist Jonas
Thern from Roma. ''Having two players in that role would have been a
problem.''
Hodgson, seemingly closing the Ince saga, said that in recent weeks he
had ''never heard of any difficulty that might have made Ince wish to
return to England.''
It had been reported that Inter were after Thern, familiar to Hodgson
from his days as coach of Malmo, as a replacement for Ince. ''I put his
name forward . . . I believe he is a player we could use,'' said
Hodgson. ''He has a good brain, a great style, and a good physique.''
Arsenal have pulled out of a #6.5m bid for Ince a former Manchester
United captain. But it has been reported that Newcastle, Tottenham
Hotspur, Chelsea, and Middlesbrough were still interested.
Hodgson has stated that he did not want Ince to leave but would not be
surprised if the player made a quick return after havng failed to settle
in this season. Inter have won only twice in nine matches this season.

EDDIE Egan, the tough-talking New York City police officer whose
exploits inspired the Oscar-winning film The French Connection, has died
at the age of 65. He had retired to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1984,
and died there on October 28 of cancer.
''He was such a proud man, and tough,'' said Cheryl Kyle-Little, who
lived with Egan. ''The toughest cop in New York City.'' With his partner
Sonny Grosso, Egan managed a 112lb heroin ''bust'' in 1962, one of the
biggest in New York City's history.
Egan, nicknamed ''Popeye,'' was played in the 1971 Academy
Award-winning movie by Gene Hackman, while Egan played the role of his
own boss. The movie won three Oscars, including best actor for Hackman
as the brutish narcotics officer Jimmy ''Popeye'' Doyle.
''He was a bigger-than-life guy,'' Grosso said of his ex-partner.
''Hackman became Egan and got that way from hanging out with us for a
month. Eddie was the best damn cop I ever worked with.''
After The French Connection, Egan played character roles in many
television series, including Mike Hammer, which starred Stacy Keach.

A FLAT rear-left tyre may have caused the accident which led to Mika
Hakkinen suffering serious head injuries yesterday during qualifying for
tomorrow's Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide.
The 27-year-old Finn lost control of his McLaren and crashed into a
wall at the 108mph Malthouse Bend. He was taken to the Royal Adelaide
Hospital.
Hakkinen improved ''significantly'' overnight, medical officials said
today. ''He has been stable throughout the night and is slowly regaining
consciousness,'' a statement said. He could now move all his limbs and
understand what was being said to him, but the statement added he
remained under sedation and under ventilation.
McLaren team manager Ron Dennis was reported as saying that, after
studying computer data from the crash and inspecting the damaged car, he
believed a flat rear left-hand tyre caused Hakkinen to lose control.
Goodyear, which supplies all tyres used by teams in Formula One, said
that three rear-left tyres inspected by them had been found cut during
the session. The cars were Portuguese driver Pedro Lamy's Minardi,
Englishman Johnny Herbert's Benetton, and Hakkinen's. Goodyear officials
said the cuts may have been caused by debris, kerbs or manhole covers on
the 2.35-mile tricky, fast and slippery Adelaide street circuit.
Ferrari driver Gerhard Berger said: ''It looked as if Mika had a
problem with the left rear side of his car. The right front wheel seemed
to be off the ground at the start of the accident and he took off when
he hit the kerb. It looked as if something may have failed or there was
a puncture.''
Hakkinen's car slid backwards, hit a kerb then pirouetted through
nearly 360 degrees before slamming into the barriers.
Herbert also spun off, and Mark Blundell, in the second McLaren, came
off at the same place as Hakkinen.
The qualifying session was halted for 42 minutes. When it resumed,
Williams driver Damon Hill grabbed provisional pole position ahead of
team-mate David Coulthard, Berger, and Michael Schumacher.
Coulthard led for most of the session, but Hill eclipsed his best time
in the final two minutes. Provisional times:
1, D Hill (GB) Williams, 1min 15.505sec (112mph); 2, D Coulthard (GB)
Williams, 1-15.628; 3, M Schumacher (Germany) Benetton, 1-16-039; 4, R

Kentucky, 1905, died, Palm Springs, Florida, November 1995
JOHN Patrick, the playwright, who has committed suicide in Florida,
was one of the most prolific Hollywood screenwriters for more than 30
years. He won the Pulitzer prize for his play, Teahouse of the August
Moon, which was filmed in 1956 with Marlon Brando playing the wily
Japanese interpreter who helps the American GIs in Okinawa in 1944
succumb to things oriental. Several of his screenplays had Eastern
settings.
Another of his plays was The Hasty Heart, which was also filmed in
1949 with Ronald Reagan and Richard Todd playing the lachrymose Scot,
Lachie, who is dying.
John Patrick Gogan was born in Lousiville, Kentucky in 1905, and
studied at Harvard and Columbia Universities. His other film scripts
included the famous Roman romance, Three Coins in a Fountain, the
weepie, Love is a Many Splendoured Thing which starred Jennifer Jones
and William Holden, and Some Came Running starrring Frank Sinatra.
He won the Screen Writers' Guild award in 1957 for his screenplay for
Les Girls, starring Gene Kelly, the last Hollywood musical film composed
by Cole Porter.
He also wrote The World of Susie Wong, 1960, and The Shoes of the
Fisherman, 1968, which starred Anthony Quinn as a fictional pope. His
last script was the 1969 melodrama, The Main Attraction, which starred
Pat Boone and Mai Zetterling.
He was was found dead, a plastic bag over his head, at the retirement
home where he had lived for several years.

OLIVER Wendell Harrington, a black activist who was the first press
spokesman for the US National Association for the Advancement of
Coloured People (NAACP), died at the age of 84 on November 6.
The artist, cartoonist, and satirist died of a heart attack in his
home in Berlin, where he had lived since settling in the communist
eastern side of the city in 1961.
Born in 1912 in Valhalla, New York, of a black American father and a
Jewish mother from Poland, Harrington was part of the explosion of
American black culture known as the Harlem Renaissance, of which he was
one of the last survivors.
In 1935 he created for the New York Amsterdam News a cartoon character
called Bootsie, a petulant, stout, bald, and moustachioed black man who
soon became a fixture in the black press, functioning as a social and
racial critic.
Harrington's first full-time job was as director of the Rev. Clayton
Powell's People's Voice but it was the Pittsburgh Courier that sent him
as a war correspondent with the all-black 332nd Fighter Squadron that
served in North Africa and Italy during the Second World War. There he
would observe the level of discrimination practised in the American
armed forces and the complexities of racism on the international scene.
After the war, as spokesman for the NAACP, the oldest and biggest US
civil rights group, he travelled through the southern part of the US and
documented abuses of black people at the hands of the white hierarchy.
He left the United States in 1949 for the safety of Paris, home of a
burgeoning expatriate black community. His controversial writings
prompted him to move to Sweden for a year and half before an East German
publication, Aufbau, invited him to East Berlin.
Harrington's marriage to a German also encouraged him to put down
roots in Berlin. He is survived by his wife, Helga, and their son,
Oliver Wendell Harrington Jn.

Neil Blaney, Irish politician and nationalist; born October 29, 1922,
died November 8, 1995
FROM his thatched cottage on a small farm at Rosnakill in County
Donegal, Neil Blaney often boasted that from where he stood the Six
Counties, as he insisted on calling Northern Ireland, were in the south
of Ireland.
Another of his frequent boasts was that he did not abandon Fianna
Fail, the main Irish republican political party -- it was Fianna Fail
which left him.
Blaney, 73, who died from cancer in a Dublin hospital on Wednesday
after a short illness, hit the headlines in Britain and Northern Ireland
as well as the Irish Republic in May 1970 when he was dismissed from the
Irish cabinet for alleged gun-running to the beleaguered nationalist
community in Belfast.
In one of the most sensational political episodes in modern Irish
politics, known as the Arms Trial, Blaney, the Minister for Agriculture,
was sacked by Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Jack Lynch, along with two
other Government heavyweights, Charles Haughey and Kevin Boland.
After the acquittal in the courts, Haughey spent years crawling his
way back to prominence in Fianna Fail before winning the party
leadership and becoming Taoiseach when Lynch stepped down in 1979;
Boland founded a breakaway republican party which went nowhere; Blaney
stood alone as an Independent member of the Dail (the Irish Parliament).
As an independent Blaney not only retained his Donegal North seat with
massive majorities in successive elections over the next 25 years, but
also won two five-year spells in the European Parliament in the 1979 and
1989 elections. (His only defeat was to Ray MacSharry in 1984).
In Strasbourg, where he championed the cause of Bobby Sands and the
Republican Hunger strikers in Long Kesh as well as the Birmingham Six
and the Guildford Four, he clashed frequently with that other great
Ulster orator, the Rev Ian Paisley.
A superb machine politician in the Tammany Hall mould, Blaney had his
grassroots electioneering methods observed by a political scientist, P M
Stack. His book, The Donegal Mafia: An Irish Political Machine, became a
standard textbook on Irish politics.
He was what is called ''a clientilist'' politician, adept in
delivering grants and jobs to his constituents, most of them of
small-farming stock. He even succeeded in securing European regional
grants to tarmacadam the entries into farms and country houses.
His strongest characteristic was his uncompromising commitment to
Irish republicanism and his lifelong belief that he was the real
representative of Fianna Fail.
In fulfilment of a deathbed promise, Neil took over his father's
parliamentary seat in 1948. In 1957 De Valera appointed him Minister for
Post and Telegraphs. Nine months later he was promoted to Minister for
Local Government, which gave him enormous patronage.
Blaney was a key minister during the premiership of Sean Lemass, from
1959 to 1966, but he disapproved of Lemass's pragmatic rapprochement
with the Ulster Unionist Prime Minister, Terence O'Neil.
A contestant to succeed Lemass in 1966, Blaney stepped down when asked
by Lemass to back Jack Lynch, who defeated George Colley. It was the
nearest Blaney came to winning the leadership. Lynch proved to be too
pro-British for him.
His death, so soon after that of Brian Lenihan, is seen as the passing
of an era.

SRU Tennents Premiership division four pace-setters Kilmarnock are The
Herald/Tennents club of the month for October.
Kilmarnock can clinch promotion today with a single point against
Langholm, but the real crunch game is likely when they play arch-rivals
Glasgow Southern next Sunday.
Yesterday, club president Bob Wright declared:''It's a real honour for
us to be named club of the month and it's good that sides outwith the
top division get some recognition.
''We have enjoyed the season so far. The eight-team divisions have
meant that every Saturday there have been meaningful games. It's been
ultra-competitive but it's been good for rugby.''
Pictured with their awards are skipper Kevin Pattie and vice-president
Brian Rowlands, with Tennents representative Ian Murray on the right.

PETER Phillips, the Queen's grandson, may yet win his first Scottish
Schools cap, despite missing out on a place in the side for the match
next Friday against Scotland Under-18 at Meggetland.
The Gordonstoun flanker, one of five players from the Morayshire
school in the squad of 22, has been named as a replacement.
The two Gordonstoun representatives in the team are Fergie Gladstone,
and Tom Lightoller, both of whom had representative experience last
season.
The burly Gladstone switches to No.8 after appearing at blindside
flanker last season allowing the selectors to experiment with the former
Cults Academy player and Scottish Schools lock Jason White in the No.6
position.
Lightoller, who played stand-off for Scottish Schools B last season,
has been selected at inside centre. As expected Gordon Ross of Heriot's
retains his place and the Heriot's stand-off has also been given the
captaincy.
Scotland Under-18 have former Schools representative players Chris
Black and Scott Ruthven and the promising Melrose wing Ross Lothian in
their back line. Up front another Schools B cap, Graeme Hoyle, is at
tight head prop, and there is recognition for lock forward Russell Todd.
Scotland Under-18 -- R Chassels (Aberdeen University); R Lothian
(Melrose), G Kiddie (Edinburgh Academicals), J Philip (Edinburgh
Academicals), I McKerrow (Sedburgh School); S Ruthven (Melrose), C Black
(Watsonians), captain; A Milne (Kings School), G McLeod (Hawick
Wanderers), G Hoyle (Stewart's Melville FP), R Todd (Langholm), D Sumner
(Preston Lodge), J Henderson (Jed-Thistle), S Pearman (London Scottish),
D Wilson (Dumfries). Replacements -- C Murray (Hawick Wanderers), H Boyd
(Caithness), F Kennedy (Stirling County), J Officer (Montrose), G
Tindall (Langholm), A Jacobson (Preston Lodge), D Harley (Heriot's FP).
Scottish Schools -- S Connell (Strathallan); S Walker (Dollar
Academy), G Hood (George Heriot's School), T Lightoller (Gordonstoun), A
Raistrick (George Watson's Coll); G Ross (George Heriot's School),
captain, R Chrystie (Hawick High School); M Welch (Dunfermline High
School), S McKinnon (Queen Victoria School), E Mackay (Strathallan), A
Ness (Edinburgh Academy), T Boyd (Hutchesons' Grammar School), J White
(George Watson's Coll), F Gladstone (Gordonstoun), G Howieson
(Hutchesons' Grammar School). Replacements -- J Mackley (Merchiston), G
Mason (Dollar Academy), S Keatch (Dundee High School), P Phillips
(Gordonstoun), T Gordon-Duff (Gordonstoun), B Prescott (Gordonstoun), A
Lawson (Eastwood High School).

GALA, already doomed to relegation to the second division, are up in
arms over the postponement of their next two matches in the SRU Tennents
premiership. The club are angry that they stand to lose sponsorship
money because the games will not to be played on the listed dates.
Indeed, the Gala management committee have decided to ignore the
Scottish Rugby Union's edict that the premiership match against Heriot's
at Netherdale, originally arranged for today, should now be played on
Saturday, December 9. Instead, Gala have written to the SRU to say on
that Saturday, they will be playing the regional league match against
Jed-Forest as planned.
Gala's premiership game against Melrose, scheduled for a week
tomorrow, also has been called off. The new date decreed by the SRU
championship committee is Saturday, December 2.
Melrose asked for the postponement as they have four players in
Scotland's XV for the international against Western Samoa at Murrayfield
a week tomorrow.
Meanwhile, Sandy Carmichael, the former Scotland and Lions prop, now
coaching Hutchesons'/Aloysians, has been joined by his son, Trevor, at
Auldhouse.
The latter will make his first XV debut in the national league match
against Dalziel at Auldhouse today.
David McKee, West's Glasgow centre, resumes club rugby after a month's
absence because of an achilles tendon injury. West have listed him in
his accustomed place for the second-division premiership match against
Stewart's Melville at Inverleith.
Jon Petrie, the North and Midlands under-19 full back last season,
appears in a new guise for Dundee High School FP against Jed-Forest at
Mayfield. From the last line of defence he has switched into the heart
of the pack at lock.

WHEN Richard Chamberlain played the naughty priest in the Thorn Birds,
he was having his moment of real doubt about the thing he loved the most
in his life, and that was his god. And to think that he should have been
doubting his wisdom in lying down naked in those dusty barns with
what's-her-name instead. Wasn't she a honey, by the way.
There I was watching the Edinburgh game against Western Samoa at
Inverlieth in midweek, and I found myself doubting the thing I love
above most others, and that's a daft 15-man game called rugby.
I was bored, as I suspect were many of the people there. As an
advertisement for our code of rugby, it was a non-starter, and if the
law makers and rugby's PR men doubt what I'm saying, then they only had
to watch as a good few of the kids who had been brought along to
spectate -- Scotland forward coach Richie Dixon had supplied 700 of them
-- left the game early.
Look, it's easy to slag off football as was done last week in this
column, but the differences between football and rugby are subtle.
Football, for all of its faults, should be a game of movement, but in
this country it happens to be played by lazy professionals. Rugby is a
game going professional, played by some hard-working so-and-so's, but
the laws of the game are fundamentally flawed. Those laws are stifling
movement, and the players are so safety minded that they are scared of
getting involved in too much movement on the pitch.
We have read column inches about the players looking for payment.
There's talk of clubs tying their players into contracts. Even districts
might pay their players. But for what? For kicking the ball into touch?
For ruining possession at rucks, for collapsing mauls, for standing
offside at scrums, and for dropping passes? For giving us a stop start
piece of boredom lasting eighty minutes?
You must be joking. Payment demands a certain standard, and from what
I am seeing, much of it is sub standard.
Rugby is now in the entertainment business. It is not in the secret
society of lineout experts business. It is not in the hidden rules of
rucking business, and it is certainly not in the stop the game for a
lineout business. With all of my might I have been defending the
''product'' on display every Saturday here in Scotland when those at the
top have been giving it real pelters.
But, like many a lover, I have changed my mind. I have just been
talking with a friend who referees in the national leagues and he
watches with almost disbelief as teams kick the cover off the ball every
weekend in an effort to bore the punters senseless and snatch a
safety-first win at any cost. And do you know the cost that there might
be? The cost might be that rugby, as we know it, dies.
Which begs the question: whose fault would that be? Would it be the
law makers who have in place a game where people still clap when some
dunderheid of a stand off kicks the ball long and dead? Or would it be
the players who take advantage each Saturday of a game that was
originally designed to be played amongst friends by killing the thing
stone dead? I suspect both.
Allan Hosie's wonderful quote that ''killers of the ball are murderers
of the game'' is a cracker in that it sums up so much, but I doubt
whether he has really thought long and hard about whether someone could
indeed kill the game of rugby union.
Here we are in what I believe will be a desperate battle with rugby
league, and I don't think that we really understand the threat that it
poses. Just because rugby league has lost Jonathan Davies doesn't mean
our game is the better. It just means that Davies can enjoy some
adulation in his native Wales.
I do think our game can be better. I like rucks. I think we need to
keep lineouts, but we have to stop all of this kicking. Is anyone
listening?
We have to prevent people killing our game by kicking the ball off the
pitch. If rugby union remains a stop start game with massive forwards
ambling from lineout to lineout -- and it happens at all levels -- then
the game will die. I am, as you'll have guessed, having some moments of
doubt.

<HEADLINE>Peters' sights are still set on Murrayfield. 'Shadow squad' have a few points to prove</HEADLINE>

THE boys from the ''shadow squad'' are in action against the Western
Samoans at Hawick tomorrow, and although a victory remains the priority,
if for no other reason than to maintain Scotland A's recent record
against touring sides, there are more than a few of those on parade at
Mansfield Park who would dearly wish to come out of the shadows, and
either claim or reclaim a place in the senior side.
Those who wear the Scotland A shirt will have been reminded quite a
few times over the past couple of days than when last the side was on
show against touring opposition, at The Greenyards a year ago, they
logged that remarkable 17-15 victory over the Springboks.
Tomorrow's side, captained by Jed-Forest scrum-half Gary Armstrong,
were at Murrayfield for a training session on Thursday night before
travelling down to to their hotel base in St Boswells and on to another
session at The Greenyards yesterday. They will hold a public training
session at Mansfield Park this morning.
Scott Welsh, the Hawick stand-off who makes his representative debut,
has survived the injury scare which could have denied him a place in the
side. Welsh twisted ankle ligaments playing against Boroughmuir last
weekend, but Scotland A team manager Douglas Morgan confirmed yesterday
that Welsh had passed a fitness test on Thursday night.
Top of the list of those who come into the category of having
something definite to prove to the national selectors is Bath back-row
forward Eric Peters, who will play on the blindside flank tomorrow, a
role he has fulfilled at Bath.
But his favoured position is still at No.8, and over the past few
days, as first he was omitted from the full Scotland side to play the
Samoans a week today, and then found himself in the No.6 shirt for
Scotland A, he must have thought long and hard about Morgan's
observation as the team was announced that if he moved North, then at
least he would be guaranteed first XV rugby.
Places on the Scotland bench for the game at Murrayfield next weekend
are up for grabs tomorrow, and for Peters, it would be a step in the
right direction. Similarly, Gary Armstrong will aim to continue his
rehabilitation with a replacement's berth at Murrayfield as understudy
to Bryan Redpath.
Ian Jardine, Stewart Campbell and Derek Stark come into this category,
too.
Morgan was an interested observer on Wednesday as Edinburgh District
-- game but outgunned -- lost to the Samoans. The former Scotland coach
isn't reading too much into that opening match of the Islanders' tour.
''Whenever they needed to, they upped their game. They had the ability
to do that then and, I've no doubt, they'll do the same against us on
Sunday and as the tour progresses. The side on Wednesday seemed to
revolve around four key individuals -- Patu the full-back, Vaifale the
open-side flanker, the No.8 Pat Lam, and the centre T'o Vaega,'' said
Morgan.
The quartet are playing again tomorrow in a side which contains 10
capped players and 10 of the side that played against Edinburgh.
The Samoans' tackling technique will be under scrutiny again tomorrow.
Some of the tackles they put in against Edinburgh on Wednesday were
borderline and others were outrageously illegal. Patu's forearm smash on
Duncan Macrae, for instance, was one which Mick McManus would have given
his eye teeth for.
Morgan was downplaying the issue yesterday. ''They've always tackled
hard and, because they try to strip the ball away at the same time as
they tackle the man, the odd one goes in high. Dangerous tackling is, of
course, unacceptable but our lads know what to expect and they'll be
ready,'' he said.
Scotland A -- S D Lang; H R Gilmour (both Heriot's FP), S A Nichol
(Selkirk), I C Jardine (Stirling County), D A Stark (Boroughmuir); W S
Welsh (Hawick), G Armstrong (Jed-Forest); G D Wilson (Boroughmuir), D G

IN 1977, the infamous Gleneagles Agreement had far-reaching
implications. Directed against South Africa, it was the catalyst for
sporting boycotts worldwide, and victims included the Edinburgh
Commonwealth Games. But finally, gloriously, it helped bring about the
downfall of apartheid.
During the past two days, a new Gleneagles agreement has been reached,
one which could prove to have even more significant implications for
Scottish sport, which knows all about apartheid. Not the inhuman racist
policy, but the burden of being second-class citizens of the sporting
world.
Determined that this will cease, the great and the very good at their
events met for two days of brainstorming which ended at the Perthshire
hotel last night.
It says something for the Scottish Sports Council's efforts that for
the first time, Jim Telfer and Craig Brown, respectively national
directors of rugby and football, have worked together in the same forum,
backed by the distillers, Bells, as part of the Scottish Sport - World
Class team.
The aim is to ensure that future Scottish competitors have the support
systems to achieve world status. It is planned within six months to
establish a National Sports Academy, or a series of smaller academies,
with funding which the SSC is confident will be forthcoming, but which
they admit has yet to be identified.
The group is chaired by Alistair Gray, of Scottish Hockey, who moves
on today to present a management review of Scottish athletics at
Stirling University where his analysis of their problems is guaranteed a
stormy reaction.
But such critical analysis is what Scottish sport needs.
Part of the initiative aired at Gleneagles was Developing Excellence
in Scotland -- DEX -- a pilot partnership proposed by Edinburgh
University, and involving the establishment of elite groups from
athletics, canoeing, cycling, shooting, swimming, and triathlon.
Limited funds will mean perhaps only six or eight sports -- not
necessarily those above -- being adopted in the new academy. Sports
chosen will be those which promise the best return, and some unseemly
lobbying is a certainty.
But Brian Samson, director of operations for the SSC, insists
resources will not be cut off from sports which fail to get on board.
One objective of the programme is to enhance the quality and status of
Scotland's coaches who have some way to go to match their counterparts
elsewhere. Don Talbot, Australia's leading swim coach, recently accepted
the post of director of performance for Great Britain swimming, at a
reputed salary of #100,000 a year.
His acceptance was hailed as a great coup, and Talbot, before
returning to Australia to tie up loose ends, even agreed the press
release announcing his appointment. Back in Canberra he took a call:
''Please, Don, will you reconsider.''
Talbot did, reneged on the UK deal, and stayed put. The call came from
Paul Keating, Australia's Prime Minister.
That's coaching being accorded status.
Yvonne Murray, Commonwealth 10,000 metres champion, explained how her
arrival in athletics was completely accidental. Commonwealth discus
champion Meg Ritchie was physical education teacher at her school.
Another member of staff, Bill Gentleman, was a major athletics
enthusiast. Without their input, Murray would probably still be playing
hockey. Ending such haphazard talent-identification should be a
priority, she says.
''What is happening here is revolutionary. Usually it's all talk and
no action. But finally somebody is listening, and doing something.''
Set against such optimism, it was disconcerting to hear the concerns
of Danny McGowan, who retires as director of leisure and recreation for
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth on Friday, after 34 years in local government.
A swim coach of international repute, he warns that new unitary
authorities could throw sport to the wolves.
Local authorities have been the biggest financiers of leisure and
recreation, injecting far more than Government or regional councils. But
the 56 existing district and island councils, almost all of whom have
directors of L&amp;R, will be refined to just 32 bodies when unitary
government comes on line next April.
Fewer than half of these 32 will have a director of L&amp;R, and many
authorities will cater for sport in other departments, ranging from
education, community services, and even environmental health.
''Swallowing L&amp;R into other, larger departments, and lowering the
status of directors, is a bad sign,'' argues McGowan, pointing out that
almost all the surviving directors will be paid at a lesser rate than
those in other major services, such as housing. Many existing directors
have not been absorbed into the new organisations, or have been offered
posts at significantly lower salaries, prompting a flood of resignations
-- experience the recreation sector can ill afford to lose.
''A further fear is that if L&amp;R is been absorbed into, say, education,
and their departmental budget comes under pressure, then L&amp;R will bear
the brunt of the cuts, because educationists will protect their own
turf.''
McGowan also fears the loss of volunteers who are the backbone of
sport's club structure. Though Glasgow has perhaps Britain's best sport
development programme, they, and other cities, have brought large
numbers of coaches from down south who then poach the talent of 100-year
old clubs, alienating people whom sport can ill afford to lose.
The birth pangs of Scotland's brave new sporting world will be acute.

action. But finally somebody is listening, and doing something'

* TO saddle 270 winners would keep some jump trainers happy for life,
but yesterday, Gordon Richards reached that figure with his jumping
raiders at Ayr alone when completing a 19-1 double with The Grey Monk
and Better Times Ahead.
The Grey Monk made his debut over fences in the novices chase
qualifier, and more than lived up to expectations as he turned in an
exhibition round of jumping.
Better Times Ahead, having his first public outing for 706 days, had
12st in the three-mile stamina test.
The seven-year-old claimed the scalp of Hit The Canvas and prompted
Richards to comment: ''He got a bit of a leg when he last ran at
Wetherby over fences and I've only had him back in training for about
two months.
''He'll probably revert to steeplechasing next time he runs.''

IT is just two years since this trailblazing project was only an idea
on paper. Now Tweed Horizons, based in Newtown St Boswells, in the
Borders, is a pioneering centre for sustainable technology and, says
senior business executive Gordon Cox, as it approaches its official
opening on November 24, it is already a flourishing showcase for a
number of green enterprises.
It was the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 and the resulting interest in
ecologically sustainable economic development which provided the germ of
the idea. Then, thanks to John Major's stocktaking exercise in Scotland,
an extra #800,000 was given to Scottish Enterprise. It held a
competition among the LECs to find innovative new projects, and it was
Scottish Borders Enterprise, with its bid based on a new green approach
to business development, that won.
This prize, and further funding from Europe, provided the growing
medium in which Scottish Borders Enterprise was able to create the Tweed
Horizons Centre. Its aim is to be a business centre of international
significance for the practical demonstration of sustainable development.
A former monastery overlooking the Tweed near Newtown St Boswells was
bought and SBE, in turn, held a competition. It invited companies or
individuals from all over the UK to submit ideas for enterprises which
would both benefit from, and contribute to, the green philosophy
embraced by Tweed Horizons. There was huge interest and, from the 21
business plans sent in, around a dozen projects were selected.
Most of these have now been established for some 18 months in the
refurbished monastery. Meanwhile, another more recent competition is
bringing in half a dozen or so more. Tweed Horizons expects around 70 to
100 new jobs will eventually be created.
There is, however, no doubt this figure underestimates the true
significance of the work being done. The centre is not only providing
high amenity office space, access to advanced information technology and
telecommunications, and a package of financial incentives to encourage
these sustainable enterprises.
It is also establishing links with academic and research institutions
to create the conditions in which leading edge research can be developed
commercially. It is establishing an information resource and the
facilities for dissemination and debate on the best means of working
towards economic as well as environmental sustainability -- regionally,
nationally and internationally. Finally, it is setting up projects to
demonstrate the economic and practical benefits of a sustainable
approach.
One example of this is the installation of a combined heat and power
system. By using woodchips from forestry waste or from coppiced local
willow plantations, all the energy needs of the centre are met from
rewable resources. And because this plant is the first of its kind and
size (it powers a 50kw machine to produce 100kws of heat), it acts as a
prototype which leads the world in its pollution-free electricity
production.
The further research and development being undertaken by one of its
resident companies should eventually lead to the Scottish production of
these plants -- for which there is a potentially vast world market.
The range of enterprises participating in Tweed Horizons is wide. They
include a company which runs the Internet presence in the Borders and
produces software, one making revolutionary new building blocks from
vegetable-based polyurethane foam, one which is developing rural land
based projects, and another which is doing research into the
effectiveness of growing reed beds to clean and treat polluted water.
What they share is the desire to address the challenge of reconciling
the long-term conservation of the environment with successful economic
development. And as exponents of this, they, along with Tweed Horizons,
are blazing a pioneering trail, setting a UK precedent for the
integration of green goals with business goals, which, in the end, is
the only viable way forward.
The award and how to enter
The scheme is a joint initiative of The Herald and Ernst &amp; Young,

THERE was a PEP on offer to the thousands of delegates attending the
Junior Chamber World Congress in Glasgow this past week. But it had
nothing to do with tax efficient investment in UK equities.
This PEP -- the Personal Efficiency Programme -- is all about people
in business getting better organised, doing more work in less time and
reducing the stress they feel in the process. It was being provided, at
two congress seminars, by the American who devised it, Kerry Gleeson.
Gleeson's international consultancy, the Florida-based IBT (Institute
for Business Technology), now covers 15 countries and offers its core
programme in 11 languages. The network's turnover has topped $10m, and
for the past two years IBT has had its own permanent offshoot based here
in Scotland.
''Most people are not taught how to work or how to organise their
working environment,'' says Gleeson, citing evidence from the Wall
Street Journal that the average American professional spends six weeks
of every working year simply trying to find things.
Here in Britain, IBT's Scottish consultants Angus Ross and Sam
Anderson chip in, Industrial Society research has shown that only 16% of
executive time is actually spent on completing key tasks and that more
than 7% of the average company's salary bill is spent paying people to
look for things on paper-strewn desks.
We all, I suspect, recognise the issue. Some of us will even recognise
the paper-chase desks. The surprise is that, 12 years after he first
realised doing something about it could become a profitable mission in
life, Gleeson is still not aware of a lot of competition from rival
consultancies tackling the same problem. ''We're still rather unique,''
he claims. ''Training programmes don't typically address the problem in
this way.''
Gleeson's PEP, which numbers among its clients heavyweight
corporations such as Unilever, Volvo and Philips, aims to change sloppy
work practices, advocating what the man himself calls the ''do-it-now
approach to personal efficiency''. The programme is intensely practical,
designed to change people's working behaviour.
IBT consultants get right down to the nitty-gritty, reviewing, for
example, tray systems, desk use and file structures in the client's
offices. The emphasis is on changing the actual behaviour of each
employee. Gleeson quotes approvingly from William James, one of the
founding fathers of modern psychology. If you want to change people's
behaviour, you've got to get them to think, feel and act differently.
''It's not uncommon for our people to climb on someone's back and stay
there,'' he adds. ''After all, it's much easier to start a physical
exercise programme if someone drags you out of bed at six in the morning
and runs down the street with you. We're not in this business to be nice
to people.''
Gleeson's previous career had been in sales and marketing. In 1983
together with his Swedish wife and their children, he went to her
homeland to live for a year. He tried starting a marketing consultancy,
offering his services on a no-results-no-fee basis.
One contract came from a branch of the bank Svenska Handelsbanken.
''In most cases, staff already knew what they were trying to do for
customers. The trouble was that, where the rubber met the road, they
never had any time left to execute many of these things,'' he recalls.
''I was in danger of not getting paid. So I ended up working with
staff to try and find ways they could organise themselves to achieve
better results.
''What emerged wasn't rocket science, but we discovered that one
teller was out-performing the rest and she was doing that because she
always did things as they came up. Other tellers put things aside for
later. Even the manager had no time left to actually manage the branch.
''So I ended up doing the management and we developed a training
programme to organise the branch the way that lone teller worked. It had
very little to do with marketing, but that branch increased the amounts
it held in savings accounts so much that it went from 68th place to 8th
place in the bank in six months.''
IBT rolled out from there, with Gleeson literally taking a summer to
target a major new centre such as London, by knocking on doors. The
original UK base, in Redhill, opened for business in 1985. Glasgow
followed two years ago.
''What we do is build round the concept of visible management,'' he
says. The black holes in any inefficient office environment, he adds,
are the individual office drawers where unprocessed memos are stuffed.
But these are precisely the places line managers are reluctant to
explore. Gleeson is so big on systematising things that such black holes
are filled.
But won't the networked, computerised office of today and tomorrow
render such problems redundant, I wonder. Computers can help, he
concedes. But people who can't organise their paper-based lives are not
likely to do any better on them, he argues.
''It's not uncommon for senior executives in Americam companies to get
200 pieces of e-mail on a daily basis,'' he says. Even with computers,
there's still, at the individual level, a huge organisational challenge.

SWEDEN'S Liselotte Neumann battled windy conditions for the second day
to maintain a one-shot lead over American Jane Geddes in the Australian
Open over the Yarra Yarra course in Melbourne.
Neumann shot a 74 for an aggregate of 141, while Geddes also added a
74 to her opening round of 67.
Defending champion Annika Sorenstam is three strokes off the pace
after shooting a 74, tied for third place with Rachel Hetherington and
Robin Walton.
Geddes made a sloppy start, dropping four shots in as many holes.
''That got me mad,'' said Geddes later. ''I birdied eight, nine and 11,
which got my momentum going, then I birdied 17 and 18 and ended up
having a good day.''
Scotland's Dale Reid is seven strokes behind Neumann after shooting a
75. Leading aggregates:
141 -- L Neumann (Sweden) 67, 74.
142 -- J Geddes (USA) 68, 74.
145 -- A Sorenstam (Sweden) 70, 75; R Hetherington 74, 71; R Walton
(USA) 74, 71.
146 -- C Nilsmark (Sweden) 74, 72.
147 -- K Webb 73, 74; P Rizzo (USA) 75, 72.
148 -- D Reid (Scotland) 73, 75; C Hall (England) 69, 79; J Crafter

76, 72.

Big name signing for legal team
SPORTS broadcaster Jock Brown is also a solictor. I was going to say
in his spare time, but it might be better to call it his day job, as he
has just been signed up by a leading law firm as a sports law
consultant.
Harper Macleod has taken him on to work in the sports law unit it set
up three years ago. This represents football and rugby clubs, players
and agents, as well as individuals in golf, tennis, snooker and
yachting.
It is not surprising that Stephen Miller, head of Macleod's sports law
unit, used soccer parlance when describing Brown's arrival at the firm.
''We could not have made a bigger name signing. I am delighted Jock
Brown is joining our team.''
Brown's appointment may mean he will be approaching future match
commentaries from a slightly different angle. He could perhaps start
describing football crowds as so many thousand ''witnesses'', and a
heavy tackle could become ''grievous bodily harm''.
Marathon effort in Stornoway
SHARON McEwan, a director of McLaurin Marketing, was out of breath
when I chatted to her the other day. She explained she had just run
across from the newsagent to her office. Tut tut, I said, and commented
that a young lady should be fitter than that.
At this point in the conversation she demolished me by explaining that
she had recently completed the Dublin Marathon, and, unlike the
gentlemen who was caught cheating having run only the last three miles,
she covered the entire 26 -- and in a time of only four hours, 40
minutes.
She went on to say she was grateful she had been running in Dublin and
not in Stornoway.
She then recounted a tale about a friend who, when visiting the
latter, decided to go for a run only to be stopped by two locals, who
enquired why he was out running on the Sabbath and reminded him that it
was a day of rest.
Although taken aback, our runner managed to gather his wits about him
and point out that Jesus had walked round Jerusalem on a Sunday.
Not to be outdone, the trusty pair replied: ''Well now -- you might
get away with it in Jerusalem, but you'll not get away with it here!''
Heralding the media at dawn
THERE are some stories you just have to write, and this is one of
them. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce is holding an Early Bird Breakfast
meeting in the city's Central Hotel on Wednesday on the subject of the
media.
George McKechnie, editor of The Herald, will address the gathering and
answer questions along with Alex Dickson, head of programming at Radio
Clyde, and Scottish Television presenter Paddy Christie.
I am not normally an early riser but just this once I might make the
7am start.
On trail of visiting professor
PROFESSOR Tony Meehan departed from Glasgow yesterday on a gruelling
four-day trip which will see him cover 14,000 miles and make three
presentations.
The first took place yesterday in London to the top-150 management
group of Burton.
As you read this he is likely to be still in the air on a flight to
Malaysia, where he is attending the International Public Relations
Association's Conference in Kuala Lumpur.
He will present two papers to the conference, the first a case study
on the State Hospital, Carstairs, and the second on the question ''Does
Public Relations Add Value'', which looks at Richard Branson, General
Colin Powell and David Bishop, boss of Glasgow-based drinks and wine
wholesaler William Morton, among others.
On Wednesday, Meehan will be back in Glasgow to attend a meeting at
the city's Caledonian University, where he is visiting professor, to
discuss the programme for students.
Other foreign dates in his diary include trips to Budapest and the
Baltic States. Little wonder that he is called a visiting professor.
Edinburgh goes to Ayrshire
JOHN Haldane, chairman of the Ayrshire Award Scheme, part of the Duke
of Edinburgh Award Scheme, is seeking local businesses to sponsor its
publication Scottish News which comes out three times a year.
He also wants more companies to participate in the scheme as this will
help school leavers who may have a bronze or silver to achieve a gold
award.
The scheme's Charter for Business aims to encourage companies to use
the Duke of Edinburgh Awards as part of their training programme.
Haldane reckons he needs #2000 in sponsorship for his new publication,
but if any company in Ayrshire would like to join the scheme they should
contact him on 01294 832172.
Some discreet buy-out advice
I'M confident that Coopers &amp; Lybrand Corporate Finance will deliver
its latest publication in a plain brown envelope. I can imagine certain
business owners suffering from apoplexy if they discover their senior
employees reading the guide on how to organise a successful management
buy-out or buy-in.
If you would like a copy of the free 35-page guide, contact Linda
Eadie or Stuart McKee on 0141 248 2644 or fax them on 0141 221 8256.
Chamber takes poetic licence
OH dear me, someone at Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce has penned a poem
McGonagall would have been proud of. It is to mark the coming together
of the chamber and the Capital Enterprise Trust into a new body to be
known as the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise.
Entitled The Entity, the eight-verse poem appears on the front page of
the current edition of News Brief, and starts thus:
In 1758, a long gone age
A group of men with sight &amp; sage
Came together to be the voice
Promoting members' business, right of choice.
From here, I'm afraid, it is all down hill. A later verse sends your
pulse racing with excitement as it builds to a crescendo:
From Import 'n' Export and Documentation
Company Law, Licensing and even Arbitration,
VAT, Translations and all Training supplied
To be a select MEMBER, you just have to apply.
Stirring stuff, particularly when the ''poet'' gets carried away by
the importance of the moment and describes the merger of the two bodies
in the following verse:
CET &amp; The Chamber are to be as ONE
It's official now that the deed is done,
The staff moving together to a new place
A ''rebirth'' of the CHAMBER into the race.
What can Business Diary say but that the author should stick to his or
her day job.

THE fact that Davis Love III and Fred Couples are a pair of
good-natured gentlemen does not hide the truth that they are as ruthless
a golfing combination as it would be possible to find. They have become
the rulers of the World Cup, winning the trophy in 1992, '93, and '94,
and they look like maintaining their dominance this week at the Mission
Hills club in Shenzhen, China.
Another hot day saw Couples start with three birdies in a row and Love
matched him at the second and third as the all-American team threatened
to make snakemeat -- the local delicacy -- of the opposition.
Couples cooled enough to finish with a 69, three under par, while Love
lobbed in five birdies and an eagle on his way to a 67. That left them
on 269, 19 under par, four shots ahead of the Swedes, Jesper Parnevik
and Jarmo Sandelin, and 10 ahead of Mexico's Esteban Toledo and Rafael
Alarcon.
Scotland's Sam Torrance and Andrew Coltart are sharing sixth place,
alongside Australia and France on 282, after rounds of 70 and 74
respectively. ''I played well,'' said Torrance, ''but nothing much
happened. It was a hot, slow day.''
Coltart, unable to fathom the greens and making it increasingly clear
that he was not pleased with the way things were going, missed numerous
birdie chances.
Parnevik holed in one with a No.5-iron shot at the 205-yard fifteenth.
Not one of the world's great drinkers, he won himself 52 crates of beer,
but had not touched a drop when he dropped shots at the last two holes
for a 66. Leading aggregates:
269 -- United States (D Love III 65, 67; F Couples 68, 69).
273 -- Sweden (J Parnevik 67, 66; J Sandelin 69, 71).

* COLIN Montgomerie moved into contention in the Taiheiyo Masters near
Tokyo yesterday when he posted a 69, three under par, in the second
round to climb to joint ninth on 143.
''I putted a bit better and wasn't as jet-lagged as I was in the first
round,'' said the Scot, who trails leader Satoshi Higashi by seven shots
after the Japanese carded a second-round 66.
England's Barry Lane was two further strokers adrift after a 74 left
him on 145 alongside Greg Norman.
* ENGLAND'S Laura Davies was in joint second place after the first
round of the Itoen tournament in Japan. The defending champion shot a
one-under-par 71 to tie with Japan's Akiko Fukushima, one stroke behind
South Korean Ko Woo-soon.

'I believe the modern footballer has to begin to take a greater pride
in his work. The desire to improve skills must come from within'
WHEREVER his ambitions lead him, in business or football, Jim Oliver
is never likely to be nominated for the diplomatic corps.
The Partick Thistle chairman is not a man to couch his opinions in
euphemism, rather he reacts with language that usually states his case
unambiguously.
It is that propensity for telling it like he sees it which has managed
to incense people in the game as well outside it. His pronouncements
during the recent reported take-over bid of the club were prime examples
of the knee-jerk reactions which occasionally upset others.
Oliver will still tell you now that there has never been any approach,
let alone bid, to buy him out of Firhill, not by a group of Asian
businessmen or anyone else. It was his exasperation at what he saw, and
believes yet, was nothing more than a politically motivated piece of
hype, that caused a furore.
He was accused of outrageous racism when he said that he was not
prepared to walk away from a substantial investment, ''just to satisfy
the whim of some guy with a curry shop.'' He has no regrets about the
remark, nor did he believe it was racist. ''I don't accept that. I
wasn't the one who said that the group was Asian but every report, every
quote, said that. ''Being Asian, Caucasian or whatever didn't give them
a special discount here.
In a flippant moment, trying to demonstrate that I wasn't racist, I
said that we would talk to anyone, even one-eyed, black, lesbian
saxophone players. That has come back to haunt me.'' He was astonished
at the reaction, especially the press conference held by MP George
Galloway, who was reputedly the take-over team spokesman, when it was
said that Oliver knew little about political correctness.
''You see, no-one ever made an offer or even an approach. The first
thing people should do, and it might seem daft to say so, is talk to the
people who own it.
''It was simply an old tactic of lifting hype and generating fan
support by saying money would be used to strengthen the team. I just
wanted them to get real.
''I don't want to sell but the fans think that if I haven't got money
to spend on players, I should get someone in who will. Fine, but where
is he? All I can say is that if there is someone let's talk to him. I
mean, if there is a bigger mug out there than me I would like to meet
him.''
Oliver has spent #2m of his own money on Thistle and is six years
through the 10-year plan he devised when he moved into football, a sport
he had only taken a passing interest in previously.
He was not a Thistle fan, saw them and other teams only occasionally
but, whatever the feelings he generates on the outside, the development
of the old Maryhill ground is not a bad testament to his business
acumen.
He would confess that he has been told he does not suffer fools gladly
and also has been criticised for statements he has made which appear to
denigrate players. He is not repentant in that area, either.
''I believe the modern footballer has to begin to take a greater pride
in his work. The desire to improve his skills must come from within. He
must want to get better. Too many of them seem to operate on the basis
that they do the absolute minimum necessary.
''We get shown up when we watch foreign teams, their individual
control, ball skills penetration, all vastly superior to us.
''Unlike many other industries, footballers are reasonably well paid
for the hours they put in. You have to feed them, clothe them and give
them pocket money. It is a culture that has never grown up.
''It is the norm to train in the morning and have the afternoon off.
That is changing slowly but experienced players -- and I am not talking
just about Partick Thistle -- still feel that if they are called back in
the afternoon, it is some kind of punishment.''
His manager, Murdo MacLeod, whose experience with Borussia Dortmund
altered his ideas in every aspect of the game, is one of the new
generation of managers who are beginning the revolution, but in the
meantime he has enough work to try to keep his team in the premier
division.
Reports that Murdo was about to ask the chairman for #1m to spend on
players may not prove accurate, however. Oliver has not been approached
by the manager, nor does he expect it to happen. Even if he did, MacLeod
would be wasting his time.
''Murdo knew when he took the job what the financial position is,''
said Oliver. ''There is no money available for the transfer market. What
has to be done now is generate funding ourselves by something like a
good cup run. What is certain is that we have finished spending on the
ground, for the time being at any rate, and any cash we generate will go
towards strengthening the team.''
Oliver wants to see his club achieve something like Raith Rovers
managed last season or Airdrie every other season, go a long way in one
of the cup competitions and produce income that can raise the standard
of the team.
Getting into Europe would be a bonus, especially if they could draw a
jackpot a la Raith, by meeting a side like Bayern Munich.
When he takes stock with four years of his business plan to run,
Oliver would admit to being proud of some of the progress made, the new
#2.3m stand et al, but feels the playing side might have been improved
at a quicker rate.
For a man who spends 60% of his time dealing with football matters and
the rest in his business, Windex, it is only right that he has grown not
only to love but understand the old ball game.
''I can now appreciate the skills, formations, tactical patterns,
shapes, and all of that, but most clubs in our position suffer from the
same problems, that we always need more and better players.
''We have never had strength in depth, a luxury we would love to
experience.'' Oliver's smart, modern business offices are down at the
bottom end of Firhill, which may make life seem easier for combining
both jobs, but does not appear that way to him or those who share in his
day job.
''Actually, having my office here has meant me giving Partick Thistle
a huge hidden subsidy in my time, my surveyor's time (when we were
developing the new stand) and my accountant's time. In fact, we are
moving out of here on December 1 because we can't really afford to stay
and continue to leave offices we own in town empty.
''We pay a rent to the club for the use of these premises, but now
Partick Thistle will look elsewhere for tenants.'' Oliver does not paint
the usual domesday scenario if his team fails to stay up in the top
league.
''We want that very much of course,'' he said, ''but I don't go along
with the idea that it would be disastrous to go down. Winning games in
the first division might draw bigger crowds than losing in the premier
league, but we want to compete with the best and so do our fans.''
Oliver has not made any decision about his future when his 10-year
plan is completed. ''At that time, if the opportunity to pass it on to
better hands comes, then I would do so, but if there are none in view, I
wouldn't walk away from the club.''
To date, in his six years in charge, he has not had one approach and
maybe is not too surprised. There are not a whole host of entrepreneurs
out there willing to shovel money into football clubs. None of the
directors at Firhill is paid a salary and that does not look like
changing.
He has no time for the excesses, as he sees it, of the Taylor Report.
''It is lunacy. Because of a lofty ideal, it has been driven to a
ridiculous level where absurdity is placed upon absurdity. You can't
tell me that it is impossible for engineers to devise a terracing in
which it is safe for fans to stand and watch a football match.''
Oliver points out his window to terracing behind the goal and says:
''It must be possible to satisfy all safety considerations and let
people stand out there, whether it be 4800 or 800, to watch Partick
Thistle. As I say, it is lunacy. ''He does like to say what he thinks,
does the Firhill chairman.

* I would appreciate your advice on how we should invest our savings
to our best advantage. We are both retired but I am still on invalidity
pension of #92 a week plus my company pension of #89 per month. I have
#12,000 in the Abbey National High Interest cheque account and #405 in
the TSB cheque account in my name.
My wife receives #68 per month state retirement pension and #38
company pension. In her name we have #2000 in granny bonds, #12,000 in
the Abbey National Investment Account and #846 in Abbey National's
Instant Saver account. As we are both 67 with no dependant relatives,
long-term investments are not of particular interest.
We would appreciate your opinion on whether we should use the total
amount in a joint account (to receive the maximum interest) or whether
it is best placed as it is.
* Neither of you are taxpayers so products such as PEPs are of no
relevance. You cannot do better than putting all your capital into
National Savings' Pensioners' Income Bonds. The maximum holding is
#20,000 so between you all your capital can be placed there. They pay
7.5% with income paid gross, which is what you want. The rate is fixed
for five years but it is unlikely to be bettered in the foreseeable
future.
Should interest rates suddenly shoot up you can retrieve your money
with 60-days notice, during which no interest will be paid. Putting your
#27,000 in Pensioners' Bonds would produce an income of #168 a month.
* I read your personal finance page every week and would like you to
explain investment trusts. You seem to recommend them regularly yet, as
far I can ascertain, the dividends have tax deducted and they are liable
to capital gains tax when sold. I would appreciate your views on why
they are such a good investment.
* Tax-driven investments are not often the most productive. In any
event the first #6000 of capital gains, after allowing for indexation,
are tax exempt.
We recommend investment trusts on a regular basis because they are an
ideal vehicle for small investors to build up capital. Risk is reduced
by the spread of investments in trusts' portfolios and in many cases
there is exposure to overseas stock markets. For this reason dividend
returns are often below average, reducing the disadvantage of tax being
deducted. PEPs can often be used to mitigate even this.
Investment trusts have a good record of turning in a superior capital
performance. Consider the following and then make up your own mind. An
investment of #100 in the average trust with dividends reinvested in its
shares grew to #403 in the 10 years to the end of August, according to
figures published by the Association of Investment Trusts. Comparable
figures for the latest five and three years are #200 and #194
respectively.
Investment trusts easily outperform the average unit trust, not to
mention beating inflation and building society deposits by a wide
margin. They also out-perform the All-Share index, one of the best
measures of UK stock market performance.
* Having just received a booklet about the merger between my building
society, the National &amp; Provincial, and Abbey National, I learn that I
should be entitled to #500 worth of Abbey National shares if it goes
ahead, but if my address is outside the UK, I get nothing.
As I may be going overseas indefinitely early next year, I am upset.
It seems very unfair that I and others in my position would be deprived
of our just entitlement. Could you tell me if this is correct, and will
it apply to others such as the Halifax and Leeds when they go public?
* It certainly would be unfair if you were denied your free shares
just because you go overseas before the deal is completed. However, it
appears this is not of N&amp;P's doing.
A spokesman said it was keen that people in your situation were not
penalised, but some countries do not permit transmission of the
necessary documents nor the distribution of shares or cash involved in
takeovers of the sort planned. The society is investigating how it can
get round this.
If the worst does come to the worst, perhaps you will be able to think
of an unofficial way round the problem with the help of a friend or
relative. The Halifax will no doubt be watching with interest to see how
N&amp;P gets on.
* I have been self-employed for the past 10 years, and will be 65 in
two years. I have been contributing the maximum amount allowed into
various pension funds, and the present total value is #100,000. I own my
own house, valued at around #90,000. There is no mortgage. My wife, who
is 62, has a pension of #3900 a year.
We have #20,000 in an instant access building society account, #10,000
in National Savings Certificates, #20,000 in a Norwich Union investment
bond, #16,000 in TSB unit trusts, #20,000 in a Commercial Union
investment bond, #14,000 in Friends Provident's maxi bond, #11,000 in
various PEPs and #10,000 in various privatisation shares. On January 1
we will have #24,000 from our Tessas.
Would you advise putting further contributions into pension funds over
the next two years or not?
* Yes, you should make further contributions to your pension funds
which will qualify for full tax relief. Even so, your other assets are
likely to exceed those tied up in your pension arrangements. In all you
have #145,000 available. Of this #54,000 is in cash, a further #54,000
in investment bonds, and #37,000 in unit trusts, PEPs and shares. It
would have been better had the latter featured more prominently in your
investment planning.
We are not very happy about your dependence on just three investment
bonds. This is a type of investment which tends to under-perform
investment and unit trusts. You also have a substantial part of your
savings in cash where returns are currently low.
The total sum is substantial and deserves to be well invested for your
future, especially as you are likely to have a lump sum from your
pension funds to add to it. We would suggest you seek the advice of a
good stockbroker on the best use of your investments and savings. There
is more than enough there for a broadly-based portfolio of equities and
gilts which should serve you well in your retirement.
* During September 1988 I took out a Savers' Plan with the insurance
firm Manulife which has since been taken over by Canada Life. I pay #15
a month into the plan which matures in October 1998. I have received my
annual statement dated September which states the number of units I hold
to be 172.14 (Series 2 managed fund). I understand they are worth #1328
approximately, but I have now paid #1260 into the plan.
So over the years my investment has increased by only around #68! Do
you think I should make the plan paid-up or should I surrender it? If my
figures are correct I would have been better off putting my savings into
an ordinary post office account.
* Managed funds have not performed well for the past couple of years.
The Manulife fund has not been far off the average for its sector, but
clearly it did not do well enough to offset the charges. It is to remain
separate within Canada Life, but will be run along the same lines  as
the latter's managed fund which has been close to the average.
Your investment has now reached a decent size and there is a better
chance of an improved performance in future, particularly as the outlook
for stock markets is reasonable. If you no longer want to contribute
towards it, we would be inclined to make it paid up and hope for an
improvement. There is certainly a good chance the return will be higher
than if you left the money on deposit, in contrast to your experience so
far.
* I am a widow aged 68, and I live off my old age pension of #58 a
week plus interest on savings of #9000 in the TSB. My son wants to
invest in a National Savings income bond for me which will provide
approximately #50 a month extra income. Up to now I have not paid any
tax or even been asked to fill in a tax form. If I have this extra
income will I now have to pay tax?
* Based on the information you have provided your total annual income
including the National Savings interest will be in the region of #4300
which is well within the age allowance income limit of #14,600 and, as
you are over 65, you will be entitled to the single person's age
allowance. For the current tax year this is #4630 and you will,
therefore, not be liable to pay tax even with the extra income.
Your pension and interest on the income bond are paid without
deduction of income tax, but you do not say if you have registered with
the bank as a non-taxpayer. If you have not already done so you should
complete the registration form available from your branch.

THE essence of looking your best comes from the right treatments and
the right products for your skin -- and in such a specialised area, it's
essential to consult the professionals.
Beauty therapist Julie Ross has been chosen by Toni and Guy Scotland
to take over the beauty rooms in their new salon at 96 St Vincent
Street. Her experience and forward thinking made her the ideal person to
complement the salon's fresh approach to the whole subject of style and
how it suits the individual.
Born in Glasgow, Julie was raised in North London and Spain, where she
did her beauty training at a private college. There, with so much
sun-damaged skin to care for and repair, Julie became familiar with the
wide number of ways in which the elements can play havoc with skin.
Back in Scotland for 18 months now, Julie has drawn up an extensive
range of treatments to benefit the bodies of women and men -- from head
to toe.
''We specialise in facials,'' Julie said. ''With so many different
skin worries and problems we can offer 15 to 20 types, but we can tailor
those to exactly what a client needs. Anything they're worried about,
lines, ageing, pigmentation marks . . . we can put something together.''
The right skin products are also important. Julie uses dermalogica, an
American product created by the International Dermal Institute and La
Prairie, a range of Swiss products regarded as the Rolls-Royce of
skincare.
Julie will be joined by one full-time and one part-time member of
staff, when the salon opens on Tuesday, both qualified to provide the
more basic manicures, pedicures, eyebrow shaping and eyelash dyeing as
well as more specialised procedures such as removal of skin tags, thread
veins, aromatherapy, reflexology and electrolysis.
This is the perfect opportunity for men to get in on the act. In
perfect neutral surroundings, the physical problems that men may want to
rid themselves of can be gone, easily and comfortably. As well as
permanent hair removal, the staff can wax chests and backs for a smooth
finish. Tired bodies can be soothed by massage -- there are also
machines which work deep into aching muscles.
The work is the perfect accompaniment to a Toni and Guy cut -- to
provide the woman or man in your life with the ultimate treat. There are
also beauty vouchers on sale to keep them looking good throughout the
year.

INVESTORS always have to keep asking themselves questions. Markets are
constantly on the move so no matter how much trouble you may take in
choosing a home for your cash, you do need to keep on asking: is this
still the right place or is there somewhere better? Gilts and top
quality bonds are currently looking tempting, although there seems no
urgency to abandon shares.
Although the share markets in both the UK and the US are currently
high by historical standards, which causes some professionals to ask
themselves when the correction will come, most still see reasonable
rewards for investors who stay in them. For the time being anyway.
Broker Killik &amp; Co in a recent review, for instance, admitted to being
''a touch more cautious'', but still concluded ''this is a market to be
in''.
In the curious way these things work, there seems to have been a
little extra confidence injected into the UK market this week after the
latest statistics on manufacturing output showed a drop of 0.6%, the
largest fall for eight months. On the face of it, it was a signal of
economic slowdown. The stock market, however, responded with a rise of
eight points on the FTSE-100 index amid comments that the case for a
further cut in interest rates had been strengthened.
The logic is that lower interest rates would be justified to help
stimulate the apparently flagging economy. A further cut could then be
expected to be helpful to the prices of Government securities -- gilts
-- and other fixed-interest instruments. And history suggests that if
the gilts market is strong, or at least stable, that is also helpful to
the market for shares.
But is it as simple as that? How do the professionals see the
prospects? David Rough, Legal and General's investment director,
commented recently that things were pretty quiet in the personal equity
plan market because investors were feeling cautious about the economy.
He was announcing further cuts in PEP management charges, intensifying
the competition there and setting a target to win #250m worth of PEP
business over the next three years. That is a large figure, but he
admitted he felt a lot of it would have to come from people switching
from other managers rather than putting in new money.
He and other experts are currently favouring gilts and bonds ahead of
ordinary shares. But that does not mean he thinks shares will fall. His
company forecasts that the FTSE-100 will touch 3850 in the next 12
months. So there should be a total return from shares of 12% in the
coming year. That is based on a belief that dividends will grow by 8%
against 11% this year. Earnings are still expected to grow, but to do so
more slowly -- 10% against 14% this year.
For gilts the projection is for a total return of 15%. This assumes
investors' expectations of inflation will fall from a currently
predicted 4.7% to around 4% next year, which would mean gilts should
give a ''real'' yield of some 4%. This sort of inflation expectation,
however, should mean gilt prices rise to reduce the yield on a 10-year
bond from around 8% to 7.5%.
Bearing in mind the sort of interest rates available at banks and
building societies, the professionals see cash as likely to be the worst
performer compared with the returns expected from bonds and shares. The
exception might be if you happen to have your cash in the next building
society to get taken over or float on the share market.
The argument for a cut in interest rates is helped by forecasts that
UK economic growth, having already slowed down, is likely to remain
sluggish. It would be hard put to do otherwise as the global economy
weakens.
Paul Turnbull, UK economist at Merill Lynch, still forecasts that base
rates will fall from 6.75% to 6.25% by the end of next year. But he
adds: ''There is a fair chance rates will fall further than this. There
is a risk the present slowdown in the economy will intensify or drag on
well into 1996.''
And if inflationary pressures subside significantly in the first half
of next year, ''substantial reductions in nominal interest rates might
be necessary to prevent 'real' interest rates rising and having a
dampening effect on spending''.
Although the futures market has been discounting a rise in base rates
next year to perhaps 7.25%, he recalls that most forecasters got their
predictions for this year wrong and he would not completely rule out a
drop to 5% by the end of 1996.
The firm's strategy team sees UK 10-year bond yields dropping to 7.25%
by the end of next year. This would result from rising bond prices as
investors give up worrying about inflation. But it too does not see the
picture as depressing for share prices, commenting: ''In this kind of
environment the stock market is likely to carry on rising.''
Among the sectors it likes are financials, particularly HSBC, partly
because UK institutional portfolios are underweight in banks but also
because the broker is bullish on Hong Kong.
Merill Lynch expects the US economy to continue to slow down, leading
to rising unemployment, lower inflationary pressures and a drop in
interest rates with the consequent effect on bond prices. But, as for
the UK, it suggests falling interest rates should drive share prices
higher.
All in all, however, it would seem prudent to have at least some
bonds, ideally top quality ones in a PEP, rather than relying totally on
shares.

IT is going to be a while before the public trusts the life insurance
industry again. The mis-selling of personal pensions and the over
enthusiastic selling of endowment mortgages has led to a sharp reduction
in sales, bringing some life companies to the brink of extinction.
The industry has no-one to blame but itself. But it is also a pity
because life insurance companies have a lot to offer, and if they had
stuck to what they are good at -- selling cheap, no-frills term
insurance -- then none of this public relations nightmare would have
happened.
Term insurance is still the life insurance industry's best kept secret
and the good news is that there is a price war going on. As a result
costs are coming down by as much as 30%. Rates have been edging down for
the last couple of years ever since the industry realised it wasn't
about to be innundated with Aids claims.
The downward trend gathered momentum recently when Legal &amp; General cut
rates by a quarter. It says it is passing on the benefits of increased
efficiency and that Aids and longer life expectancy aren't factors
behind its rate cuts.
But there is no doubt that life insurance companies have lost their
fear of Aids. Rates increased dramatically at the end of the eighties.
Even Equitable Life which built ''a wait and see'' clause into its term
policies, allowing it to increase premiums if it experienced a flood of
Aids-related claims, has now gone back to the old system of quoting a
rate which applies throughout the term.
Term insurance, or its most useful variant family income benefit, is
what you need if people depend on your income. It is insurance pure and
simple. There is no savings element whatsoever. With term insurance you
pay your premium and if you die within the term of the policy, your
family gets the money.
For example, for the cost of three pints of beer a month, a
30-year-old man could take out #50,000 worth of term insurance to cover
his family over the next 20 years. If he dies within the 20 years, his
family gets #50,000. If he survives he gets nothing.
It is this last element which stops people investing in this type of
insurance, although the concept is no different from that underlying
motor and household policies. There is, however, the advantage that some
insurance companies now allow the terminally ill to take the money
before they die, and there are also a number of companies which will buy
term insurance policies from people who are dying.
Term insurance has all sorts of uses. If you have a mortgage which you
intend repaying at some date in the future out of savings, for example
with a PEP, you can take out term insurance in case you die before you
get the chance to repay it. If you have a repayment mortgage, there are
special reducing term insurance policies where the amount of cover goes
down as your outstanding mortgage reduces.
Family income benefit pays a yearly income rather than a lump sum. For
instance, if your family would need an income of #20,000 a year if you
weren't there to provide it, you could take out a policy which paid out
this amount every year until your children were old enough to fend for
themselves.
The best thing about term insurance is its clarity and the fact that
you can choose a policy simply on price. However, if you do want to get
more complicated, there are also a couple of variants which may be worth
considering if you are worried about your long-term health or you want
flexibility.
Renewable term insurance allows you to extend your policy at the end
of the term for a another five or 10 years without further medical
evidence, while convertible term insurance gives you the option to
convert it to an endowment or a whole of life policy at some point
during its life.
If you have a personal pension you can obtain tax relief on your term
insurance premiums by getting the insurance company to annex the policy
to your personal pension. The premium may be slightly higher than the
figures quoted below, because the insurance company may experience a
higher level of claims from policies taken out through personal
pensions, but the tax relief will compensate for this, especially for
higher rate taxpayers.

entitled The Protection Maze, which is available by phoning 0800 318327.

I WAS out for a few beers the other night with my pals, for the first
time in ages. I knew they were my pals, because we were rude to each
other all night. I've recently realised that the frequency with which
men use conversational pleasantries is in indirect proportion to how
well they know each other.
Good manners are reserved for people you've just met. When you first
meet someone, you might try to come across as a reasonable bloke, but
with family and, more especially, old friends courtesy seems just too
much effort. What's the point in getting to know someone if you can't
revert to acting like the bigotted ill-informed slob that those at home
have come to know only too well? If you've known someone well for half
your life, the last thing they've a right to expect is that you'll be
nice to them.
With my pals now scattered all over the country, rarity makes this
rudeness all the sweeter. Famous people say that their friends ''keep
their feet on the ground'', but this is just a euphemism for ''my mates
are like everyone else's -- a bunch of sarcy gits''.
Eamonn always gives, and gets, the worst abuse. ''Your column's
crap,'' he said, ''it reads as if you're old.'' Eamonn, there's a good
reason for this: I am old, or at least, I'm not young. No-one over 30
should act on their delusions of youth: that's the kind of nonsense that
makes Jim White present Late Edition.
I felt young when I woke up on Monday, though. I had a huge spot on
the side of my nose. This was a sign that it's not only parts of my
brain that think I'm 23, my skin is deluded too! At my age, spots are
good news. Past 30, you're young enough to get the occasional spot, yet
too old to have anyone tell you what to do with them.
When I was 15, it seemed that a mother's main duty was to nag
teenagers constantly, usually to stop them touching their spots. This
must be one of the gems you pick up at Mothers' School, after you've
learnt that wearing anything lighter than a snorkel jacket will leave
you at risk from ''a chill''. To hear mothers talk, it's a wonder anyone
survived north of the Mediterranean before the invention of the Aran
jersey. Why are Scots women so scared of the cold? My Gran -- no joking
-- wouldn't let us drink milk straight out of the fridge. She would
always add a wee bit of tea -- ''just to take the chill out of it''.
It's a good job she wasn't a barmaid. ''Here Archie, let me put some tea
in that lager -- that'll take the chill out of it.''
Before anyone starts getting over-sensitive about acne, (''Dear Sir,
Do you mind? My dog has acne!'') I feel it's important to say that,
despite what youngsters think, teenage acne is not a disaster. In
national terms, it saves us a fortune, given that it probably keeps
teenage pregnancy rates down. Never mind sex education, why don't we
dish out Mars bars every day to all girls aged between 13 and 18; it'd
be cheaper and safer than the pill too.
It is of course a ridiculous notion that anyone can possibly leave
their spots alone. Only people who've forgotten how much fun it is,
would even dream of telling others not to squeeze their spots. You might
as well tell teenagers not to . . .(You can't say this. What kind of
paper do you think this is? -- Ed). Surveys have shown that having
plooks is the most popular leisure pursuit among the 14-17 year olds
living in Cumbernauld.
By night-time my spot was clearing, and I was beginning to feel old
again. I turned the telly over, and found myself watching the worst
programme on the box, Scottish Women. Maybe it serves a sociological
purpose by letting a load of moaning old bags whinge on about all men
being bastards. Unfortunately, Kaye Adams has to spoil it all by showing
the programme on national telly. This week it was the turn of female
comedians to tell us what bastards men were.
The comedians sat there, each one less funny than the one before,
assuring us that the reason they never had their own Channel 4 series
was that men were ''frightened'' of funny women. I felt sorry for them,
in a way, but what these women needed was a night out with their pals. A
hearty dose of honesty would do them the world of good.
Before I go, I know that some teenage boys will be sitting at home
worrying about acne, most particulary: ''No-one will fancy me if I get
spots.'' Yes, spots will stop girls finding you attractive. Don't worry,
though, it won't be long before your spots disappear, and by then you'll
have a beer belly and Sky TV, and you won't need girls anyway.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Pride to shut Lochmaben milk plant</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Pride, one of the leading players in the Scottish milk
processing and cheese making sector, is to close its liquid milk
processing plant at Lochmaben, near Dumfries with the loss of 56 jobs.
It is hoped that some of the staff will be re-deployed at other plants
but it will be impossible to avoid a substantial number of redundancies.
Jim Hosea, the company's chief executive said the decision to close
the plant from March of next year had been extremely difficult but was
inevitable as part of the continuing rationalisation of the industry
following deregulation just a year ago.
Scottish Pride was formerly the manufacturing and retailing arm of the
old Scottish Milk Marketing Board.
Yesterday's statement comes on top of an earlier rationalisation
programme announced in March when the company outlined its plans for the
creation of a new depot at Carlisle and the consequent closure of small
depots at Annan, Dalbeattie, Dumfries, and Silloth.
Depots at Rutherglen, Irvine and Stranraer are absorbing work
previously done at Newton Stewart, Whithorn, Ayr, Troon, and Saltcoats.
By March of next year, 60 jobs will have been phased out in that
exercise. Mr Hosea said yesterday that the company's policy would be to
redeploy as many staff as possible and to do everything it could to
assist staff facing redundancy in finding alternative employment.
''Scottish Pride is not isolated from the pressures facing the
industry,'' he said.
''Nevertheless, we have taken a very positive stance over the last
year, investing #5m in more efficient production processes, redeveloping
and re-organising product areas such as UHT milk, cheese and butter.
This includes a #1.5m investment which will see a second high-speed
plastic bottling line come into operation at Govan later this month.''
Liquid milk production at Lochmaben will be transferred to the
company's plants at Govan and Rutherglen which will serve customers in
the Dumfries and Galloway area.
Mr Hosea also announced an agreement with Highlands and Islands
Enterprise for the company to buy the building which houses the Scottish
Pride cheese plant in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. The purchase
underlined the company's continuing commitment to its island creameries
which were all playing key roles in the imminent launch of three new
Scottish Pride cheeses, he said.
Meanwhile, The Cheese Company at Lockerbie, which is part of the
Irish-based Waterford Foods after a #128m take-over last month, has
announced a #2.5m investment programme which will see their milk intake
grow to 240 million litres next year.
New investment at the plant will cover the expansion of milk storage
facilities, processing and packing operations.
Jim Bell, general manager of the company's Scottish operations said
the planned investment would provide long-term security for employees
and suppliers and could mean additional work for local companies.
''The potential for growth at Lockerbie has always been recognised but
is only now made possible through the availability of milk in a freer
market,'' said Mr Bell. Much of the increased milk intake would be
sourced directly from farmers, he added.

<HEADLINE>NFUS revamp left to new president</HEADLINE>

THE task of overseeing changes in the area and branch structure of the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland is to be left to the incoming
president who will be elected next March, writes ROBERT ROSS.
Former vice-president Maitland Mackie complained at last week's NFUS
council meeting that insufficient work had been put into drawing up a
new vision for the future of the union in the form of a business plan.
In the wake of that debate the union's chief executive, Tom Brady, has
issued a detailed statement of progress so far.
He also sets out the view of the retiring president, John Ross, that
any review of structure, financing and membership of headquarters
committees would be better conducted under the new presidency.
''The president told me he thought this work would take some time and
would best be dealt with by his successor,'' said Mr Brady. ''He did not
want to leave a job half done when he demitted office.''
Mr Brady said the president's view was that the best way forward would
be on the basis of consensus following detailed discussion with areas
and branches.
In the meantime, the chief executive will re-write the business plan
to incorporate proposals for a public affairs division, funds for which
was agreed by the council meeting last week.
Mr Brady has also written to all members explaining the background to
the NFUS decision to withdraw from Rural Forum, another area of
criticism at last week's council meeting.
In response to a question from the floor, Mr Ross told the council
that the forum had made unauthorised use of the NFUS name in a report
submitted as evidence to the all-party Select Committee on Scottish
Affairs in its study of the future of Scottish agriculture.
In his letter to members, Mr Brady said the recommendations contained
in the report were seriously at odds with the views of the NFUS council,
which had not been given the opportunity to comment on it.
The forum paper suggested that a future support strategy for farming
should be developed where production subsidies were diminished.
The union has communicated its willingness to discuss with Rural Forum
the way they do business,'' said Mr Brady.
''Meantime, office bearers take the view that our constitution
prohibits the use of union resources, and its name, to campaign for
policies opposed by its membership.''
Deidre Hutton, chairman of Rural Forum, said yesterday that she hoped
the NFUS would resume membership of the forum because they had an
important contribution to make regarding rural interests.
A union representative on the forum had been present when the forum
council approved the submission to be put to the select committee, she
said.
''If there had been a serious problem we would not have gone ahead.
The whole thrust of the paper was that farming occupies a central role
in the rural economy and ways of protecting farming must be found.
''I do not want to continue a fall-out with the NFUS. I think they
should be part of Rural Forum. It is important that all rural interests
work together and speak together. I hope that in time the NFUS will be
back with us.''

Northern Ireland's fragile peace could have been blown to pieces by
the bomb discovered yesterday near the Irish border. Margaret Vaughan
examines how IRA hard-liners, opposed to the peace process, could be
joining the ranks of a little-known organisation committed to continuing
the armed struggle and which is being blamed for the failed bomb plot.
THE discovery of a huge bomb in a van close to the Northern Ireland
border yesterday is an acute illustration of the fragility of the peace
process. The 300lbs of home-made explosives might have shattered it had
the bomb plot not been foiled. As it is, it may hinder progress towards
a permanent peace.
Security sources say the bomb was destined to be used in a spectacular
strike in Armagh. It was being linked to the Irish National Republican
Army, the reputed military wing of Republican Sinn Fein.
Until recently it was a tiny faction, a splinter group that broke away
from the main Sinn Fein party eight years ago when, under the new
leadership of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness, it opted to take a more
overtly political line.
The group was made up of a rump of old hard-line republicans, former
IRA personnel, who vociferously oppose the ceasefire and continue to
support armed struggle.
Until recently, it had not been involved in any violent action.
However, it is emerging now that it has been linked to two other recent
bomb incidents. One went off in Newry, while another mission -- on the
August anniversary of the ceasefire -- was foiled when Irish police
tipped off the RUC that a group was heading their way with a bomb. The
group has been under surveillance for the past 14 months and it was this
which led to yesterday's operation and arrests.
The fear now is that the splinter group has become a rallying point
for the hard-line hawks, the disaffected within the IRA who opposed last
year's ceasefire and argued Adams was wrong to try for a political
settlement.
Members in South Armagh -- where yesterday's bomb was believed to be
destined -- and in East Tyrone are said to be the most opposed to the
ceasefire.
A former Sinn Fein president, Ruairi O Bradaigh, has headed Republican
Sinn Fein since its breakaway in 1986. He denies the existence of a
military wing and on Irish radio yesterday derided claims that the van
bomb was the responsibility of his movement, saying it was more like
something out of a comic opera. He did not, however, demur from the
suggestion that he and his group continued to support the use of armed
struggle.
O Bradaigh was a major figure in Sinn Fein, before the rise of Gerry
Adams. He and a former IRA chief of staff, Daithi O Conaill, walked out
of a Sinn Fein conference at the Mansion House in Dublin in 1986. They
had lost to Adams in a vote on the party's decision to end its policy of
abstention from the Irish Parliament. Effectively the two men were a
rump, a negligible grouping with no real political force.
And it was only after the ceasefire in August last year that they
began to re-emerge from relative obscurity when both men declared that
they did not accept it. The constitution of their breakaway group
Republican Sinn Fein includes a declared policy of armed struggle to rid
Ireland of the British. Consequently, they have become the focus for the
malcontents in IRA ranks.
This weekend Republican Sinn Fein have a conference planned in Dublin.
The van bomb might have been a propaganda coup for their violent
aspirations.
Of the two men captured yesterday morning, one is said by Irish police
to be regarded as ''notorious''. Both are said to have been involved in
previous terrorist activity.
The psychological impact of any threat of a resumption of violence
cannot be overstated.
Loyalist paramilitaries have said they would not strike first. Any
attack from a republican source might be enough to spark a
conflagration. It's not hard to guess what it would lead to in terms of
retaliatory action.
The volatile atmosphere within the ranks of paramilitaries on both
sides of the sectarian divide means any incident could be enough to
provoke a resumption of violence.
Politically, it might prove equally devastating. With the current
political impasse over decommissioning of weapons, it is becoming
increasingly difficult for Adams to hold the line with the military
hawks within the IRA. If they were to be upstaged by another republican
group, observers believe it might provoke a macho reaction. It would
allow the hardliners to argue that they had been right all along in
telling Adams he would get no real settlement from negotiating with the
British.
The discovery of the bomb was seized on by Unionists who used it to
accuse the Government of reducing security measures too soon. Loyalists
saw it as a reason for them not to decommission their weapons.
Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party, closely linked
to the Loyalist Ulster Defence Association, said the discovery of the
bomb made a nonsense of the argument for any form of physical
decommissioning while ''such threats remain against the Loyalist
people''.
Dr Joe Hendron, of the nationalist SDLP, said he did not think the
incident was ''ominous in terms of the ceasefire and the overall peace
process''. The group involved had not declared a ceasefire: ''It was the
IRA along with Loyalist paramilitaries who declared ceasefires. It is
important that people know it was not the IRA who were directly involved
in it.''
Earlier this week Gerry Adams warned of the risk of a splintering
within republicanism if the Government does not move the peace process
forward to all-party talks soon. It was a clear signal that he cannot
hold the line against the hawks indefinitely.
However, in London yesterday Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin
McGuiness sought to play down the significance of the incident: ''I
think we should not overreact to the find. There have been other finds
and incidents in the course of the past 15 months,'' he told a news
conference, adding:  ''I think all of this is manageable. What we need
to do is keep cool heads.''

PERSONAL pensions should play an important part in planning for the
future for everyone who isn't in a company pension scheme, whether they
are working for themselves or for an employer.
The trouble is that paying in enough over the years to generate a big
enough income in retirement is not easy, particularly if somewhere along
the way you are forced to give up work temporarily through illness.
That is a double hit strong enough to wreck even the best laid pension
plans. Not only do you have to contend with the loss of your normal
income, but the pension you thought you would have in retirement could
be badly affected because of the missed contributions.
Skipping a few months may not make too much difference to the end
result, but failing to pay premiums for several years could have
catastrophic consequences for your standard of living in retirement.
The good news for the five million or so people who are currently
contributing to personal pensions is that you can arrange for your
insurance company to pick up the tab while you're out of action.
If you take up what is known as a ''waiver of premium'' option this
means that, even if you're unable to work, your normal contributions
will continue to be paid into your pension fund as though you were
making them yourself out of earnings.
While this option is a useful way of coping with periods of sickness
or disability, you cannot yet get similar protection against
unemployment.
''Current Inland Revenue rules do not allow us to incorporate the
waiver of premium option to cover unemployment and to allow tax relief
on the extra premiums,'' says Gavin Stewart at Scottish Amicable.
''But there is general pressure on the Government to allow more
flexibility in pensions, so we may see a relaxation of the rules to
extend waiver of premium to spells of unemployment too.''
As part of what it calls its ''campaign for real pensions'', Scottish
Amicable encourages customers to arrange plans where the level of
premium rises automatically each year. This keeps contributions growing
in line with earnings and means the final pension fund stands a better
chance of providing a realistic income at retirement.
Someone who adds the waiver of premium option to this type of plan
would benefit by having an increased level of contributions going into
their pension fund while they were out of action.
''Waiver of premium is an extremely useful option that we always offer
to our clients,'' says Noel Valerio at the Glasgow independent adviser
Money Managers. ''The trouble is it does cost extra on top of pension
premiums and some people just don't want to pay in more.''
The cost -- and the level of cover on offer -- varies from company to
company, but a typical charge would be around 3% of your pension
contribution. Some companies, such as Scottish Equitable, charge a flat
fee of 2.5%, while others base the cost of the waiver option on your age
and state of health.
This option is generally taken up when a plan is first embarked upon,
but many companies allow you to add it on at a later date. You can
usually choose to pay an extra amount or have the cost taken out of your
regular contributions. Another way of paying is through a reduction in
the amountof the money you've accumulated in your pension fund when you
come to retirement.
While the waiver option is available to those paying regular
contributions into a pension plan, it is much more tricky to arrange if
you put in the odd single premium from time to time, although you may be
able to get cover based on the average of the single premiums you've
paid in the last three years, for example.
One potential problem is that you normally need to be fit and healthy
to take up this option. You'll have to answer a long list of medical
questions and, in some cases, have an examination too.
''All advisers should bring up the question of waiver of premium to
their clients -- one IFA who failed to was successfully sued by one of
his customers who didn't have that cover when he needed it,'' says Brian
McKenna of Glasgow-based independent financial adviser MGW.
''But it does slow up the sales process because an adviser has to
start asking questions about health and, if a medical reveals a problem,
the client may decide not to bother with a pension at all.''
A possible answer for those worried about their long-term health
prospects is to take advantage of an arrangement between building
society Bradford &amp; Bingley and insurer Commercial Union.
Bradford &amp; Bingley customers who take out a Commercial Union personal
pension automatically qualify for free waiver of premium on their plan
-- and there are no medical questions to answer. If you have a
particularly hazardous job or are involved in heavy manual work you may
not qualify though.
''The free waiver of contributions without medical evidence ensures
that the financial effects of ill health do not become a financial loss
in retirement,'' says John Bowman, director of pensions at CU.

A LONG hot summer was exactly what Unilever needed this year and
soaring sales of ice cream provided the topping for third-quarter
profits in Europe.
These rose almost 7% to #454m at the operating level helping push
group pre-tax profits for the three months to September 7% ahead to
#768m at constant exchange rates on turnover 6% greater at #8157m.
Nine-months profits rose by 6% to #1878m including #27m from
acquisitions on turnover a similar amount ahead at #23.3bn.
The City liked the generally optimistic statement and Unilever shares
rose 22p to 1212p.
The interim dividend has been boosted 8.3% to 7.0p for shareholders in
British-based Unilever plc but holders of the Dutch arm, Unilever NV,
receive only a maintained 1.48 guilders per share because of the
strength of the local currency against sterling.
Ice cream sales were buoyant in northern Europe helped by new
products. Walls was selling 20 million units a week in Britain and
altogether 140 million units of Solero were distributed throughout
Europe.
However, there were dull performances in both detergents and foods --
the latter again affected by the hot summer. Persil/OMO has still to
recover fully from the drubbing it received from arch rival Procter &amp;
Gamble and adverse consumer reports on Persil Power. However, New
Generation Persil is showing a slight recovery.
Detergents account for about 22% of group profits.
North America saw progress almost across the board with operating
profits ahead by 23% to #187m.

EVERYONE, it seems these days, wants to start a political party.
Arthur Scargill has been mulling it over, Sir James Goldsmith has gone
and done it, and even David Sullivan, the man known as Britain's Sultan
of Sleaze, is contemplating it.
Now it is a long time since we have had such fun, not since the Gang
of Four created the SDP followed by the fusion with the Liberals to
establish the Alliance. Remember the caricature of David Owen and David
Steel in The Muppet Show? The two Davids are in bed in their striped
pyjamas cuddling up to one another -- Owen is the large figure, Steele
the diminutive one.
''What will we call the leader of our party,'' squeaks Steel lovingly
staring upwards into the eyes of his partner.
''That's easy,'' booms Owen. ''We will give him your first name,
David, and my last one.''
Names, you see are important which is why Tony Blair's New Labour is
so unimaginative. On the Continent they do it so much better. They used
to derive the party name from where they met. In 1848 in the French
Constituent Assembly there were the Institut (Moderate Republicans), the
Rue de Poitiers (Catholic Monarchists), the Rue de Castiglione and the
Rue des Pyramides (both Left Wing).
In the Frankfurt Parliament there were the Cafe Milani (Extreme Right)
the Casino (Right Centre) the Hotel de Wurtemberg (Left Centre), from
which -- to the maitre d's disgust -- the Hotel d'Augsburg (Extreme
Left) broke away.
This offers considerable possibilities. Mr Scargill could ditch
Socialist Labour Party for something resonant like the Ilkley Moor
Baht'at Party. Sir James -- in keeping with his Francophile lifestyle --
could be the George Cinq Party. And Mr Sullivan? Why, what better than
the Playboy Party.
Unfortunately Arthur's party seems doomed which is a shame because he
could have achieved for socialism what he has for the NUM. It would have
been a wonderfully petulant party which would pout and posture even if
it were then to lie prostrate before the indifference of the electorate.
His problem would be in finding socialists. These are as rare as finding
a Nazi after the war.
Even in Scotland where socialism pre-dates the dinosaur -- and often
imitates it, every self-respecting Labour person has redesigned
themselves with a wardrobe of Slater suits and a drawer full of
Wash-and-Go red roses. They may at times look uncomfortable fingering
the inside of their shirt collars where their neck mufflers used to be
but they know it is worth it. You can see it in the eyes. They are
cow-like with a dream quality, mournful, soulful, similar to those
begging eyes we see from pitiful Rwandan children on our television
screens. ''Please help us,'' they silently plead. ''We have nothing. We
have sold our principles, our beliefs, our cannabis. Gie's a job in the
Assembly.''
As for Sir James, his party is a single issue one seeking a referendum
on Europe. Its problem is the quality of candidates. Sir Alan Walters,
Mrs Thatcher's economic guru, is to be one of them. Now Sir Alan is an
exceptionally bright man and he has been right on a whole number of
issues not least the insanity of the European exchange rate mechanism
and Nigel Lawson's puppy-like devotion to the Deutschmark. But
man-of-the-people he is not. When I met him at a party some time ago he
seemed to inhabit a world of his own. Even when a remarkably beautiful
waitress -- sleaze-bait for any Tory MP -- offered him a tray of canapes
he looked through her as if she didn't exist. It must be something to do
with these demand and supply curves.
Now self-made millionaire David Sullivan is a different proposition.
It is a pity he only wants to set up a party to challenge Labour in
Birmingham as a means to merging the local football team, which he owns,
and a rugby club.
For Mr Sullivan has the dash, verve and the brass neck to woo the
public on a national scale. A glance at the paper he launched, the
Sunday Sport, is an excellent example of the lateral thinking we need in
politics. Was it not his journalists who made the remarkable discovery
that a Second World War bomber had crashed on the moon? (They even got
pictures of it before the Apollo Spacecraft). And did those self-same
news hounds not uncover Elvis Presley alive, swinging and claiming
housing benefit in Coatbridge?
Think also of the candidates he could put forward. If he ran his
campaign as he did his newspaper everyone standing would be blonde,
42DD, with ''legs up to their armpits'' as one of his more serious
editorials once described a young lady.
Canvassing would be easy. He would allocate each of the candidates one
of his numerous 0891 telephone numbers and you could speak to her for as
long as you wished (49p per minute, 39p per minute in the evenings and
at weekends). Naughty Nina would breathlessly explain life as a working
mum. Sensual Suzie the merit of expanding the educational system,
including compulsory French lessons. Lucious Linda on the necessity for
a minimum wage or at least a minimum fee. And Sharon and Tracy -- this
could be a revolutionary joint candidature -- on sex equality and the
virtue of all-women lists.
Even minority groups could have no complaints. Those, for instance,
with a nostalgia for school life -- including the wearing of gymslips
into adulthood along with the re-imposition of corporal punishment --
would be catered for by Sadistic Sadie.
It would re-invigorate party political broadcasts. These would become
must-sees. Newsnight and Question Time would never be the same again.
And A Week in Westminster would have added significance.
Essex man, the icon of the eighties, would be back. Soon medallion
rings and white snakeskin shoes would be everywhere from the Champs
Elysees to Rome's Via con Dotti. And those maroon, purple and orange
jackets, straight from the Dougie Donnelly style book, and favoured by
Mr Sullivan, could also make their European debuts.
Would his ''policies'' be sustainable? David Hume in his ''Essay on
Parties'' in 1760 shrewdly observed that a party's programme was
essential only in the initial stage. Later on, organisation comes to the
fore, the ''platform'' becoming subordinate. We know that's true -- Tony
Blair has proved it.

The Scottish education system has often been a source of pride to the
nation but it is not without its failings. In this time of change for
schooling throughout Britain, Fred Forrester takes a comprehensive look
at the crises, challenges and opportunities for Scotland
THIS essay is inspired by the conjunction of three apparently
unconnected developments, namely the culmination of the Parents' Charter
legislation of 1981, the reform of local government with effect from
April 1996 and the Government's ''Higher Still'' proposals.
Comprehensive education has been the accepted structure of education
in Scotland for about 25 years. What has it delivered and what has it
failed to deliver?
Well it certainly brought about the end of the junior secondary
school, which latterly had very few defenders, albeit that some of these
were quite distinguished. Despite the good work done in a few junior
secondary schools, the sector deservedly had a bad reputation. Pupils
consigned to them were deemed incapable of taking external examinations
or of continuing full-time education beyond the statutory leaving age,
which was then 15. These schools were only consistent with a view of
society in which it was divided into potential manual workers and
potential white-collar workers/professionals.
Comprehensive schools have also delivered, over the course of a
quarter century, a large increase in the percentage of the cohort
obtaining Scottish Examination Board awards and a staggering increase in
the percentage going on to higher education.
The biggest area of failure in comprehensive education has been its
inability to deliver parity of esteem among comprehensive schools in
Scotland's urban areas. In all the populous areas of the central belt
there is a pecking order of schools, which is the reality in the minds
of parents whether or not it has any justification in educational terms.
It is most related to the socio-economic status of a school's catchment
area, though there are exceptional cases where a school is more or less
highly regarded than would be indicated by its catchment area.
The most highly rated schools are the ''Parents' Charter'' schools,
where some pupils come from the school's own, probably up-market,
catchment area but many more come from other parts of the conurbation
under the placing request legislation. These ''magnet'' schools have
something of the character of the pre-1970 ''Corporation fee-paying
schools'', though they do not charge fees. Such schools are often full
to capacity, offer a wide choice of Highers in S5 and S6 and have a
range of extra-curricular activities.
The other side of the coin is, of course, the ''non-magnet'' schools,
undersubscribed, offering only a limited number of Highers, containing
more than their fair share of pupils with behavioural problems and often
struggling to keep their heads above the water. There are both upward
spirals and downward spirals, with the only restriction on the upward
spiral being the physical capacity of the ''magnet schools''.
This is the great unspoken problem of Scottish comprehensive
education. Politicians and even teachers do not like to talk about it
openly. The implications of it are uncomfortable for councillors and
officials. There is no obvious solution to the problem, other than
closing down the ''non-magnet'' schools, a course of action which, as we
have seen in Glasgow, is likely to be vociferously resisted by many of
the parents concerned.
Since parental and pupil motivation is a significant factor in the
success of the educational process, it is a great pity that the drive
which underlies placing requests cannot be made use of within a
comprehensive system. The desire of parents to obtain the best possible
education for their own children ought to be harnessed for the benefit
of the system as a whole. To dismiss this desire as in some way
anti-social is unsound and completely at odds with the ''lad o' pairts''
tradition which is supposed to have been important in building the
Scottish educational system.
It is no use dismissing parental preference or even parental prejudice
as being irrelevant to the argument. The placing request legislation,
which is unlikely to be repealed by Blair or any other government, means
that the situation on the ground is driven by such preferences or
prejudices. Comprehensive education will only flourish if this factor
can be built into the system in a non-disruptive way.
If we take a sideways glance at this point at the likely situation in
England and Wales under a Labour government, we see that a diversity of
provision within the public sector school system will continue to exist.
There will still be county schools, voluntary-controlled schools and
voluntary-aided schools. However, the existing grant-maintained
(opted-out) schools will become ''foundation schools'', a new type of
direct grant school which will not be under the control of the local
education authority and whose governing body will be the employer of
teachers. Sixth-form colleges, where they already exist, will continue.
In other words, there will not be, under a Blair government, any changes
in the structure of the education system of England and Wales which
would bring it closer to the existing Scottish structure.
The reason for this digression is not to suggest that Scotland will be
unable to maintain its separate educational system. Labour spokespersons
have repeatedly emphasised that the Scottish Office will be able to
continue to make educational policy in Scotland, and the legislation for
a Scottish Parliament, which will be under consideration at Westminster
during a Labour government's first year of office, will underline this
political reality.
But we all know that a United Kingdom government of any hue creates a
political ethos which spills over into Scottish Office policy. It would
indeed be extraordinary if this were not the case. Scottish Office
Ministers under a Labour government will be under some pressure, as
their Conservative predecessors have been, to show that policies being
pursued in Scotland, while not necessarily identical with those being
pursued in England and Wales, are not incompatible with the general
philsophy of the government. This will be the case at least until a
Scottish Parliament is legislated for, elected and in control of the
Scottish Office, a process which will take rather longer than some
people reckon.
What I am saying, in essence, is that the political climate in the
United Kingdom after a General Election would not be unfavourable to,
and would certainly not prevent, the kind of changes in the pattern of
upper secondary education in Scotland which I am about to advocate.
These changes would be the result of Scottish imperatives, but they
would bring about an element of diversity in the Scottish scene which
would not be incompatible with developments south of the Border while
not mirroring them.
Let us now look at the likely situation when the new councils take
over on April 1, 1996. We already know that the areas most affected by
the Parents' Charter and by falling school rolls are likely to be
''losers'' under the funding arrangements for the new authorities. All
four cities are tipped as losers, with likely spending reductions of
12.21% in Dundee, 10.89% in Glasgow, 6.49% in Aberdeen, and 3.88% in
Edinburgh.
Since the Audit Unit at the Scottish Office has identified surplus
school places as being a major inefficiency in the Scottish education
system, and since all four cities have schools which are half full or
less, we can anticipate that there will be major pressures for school
closures in the cities (as well as in a number of other urban areas).
Yet the four cities also contain schools which are literally bulging at
the seams because of parental placing requests.
Let us bring on the final actor in this scenario, the Government's
''Higher Still'' proposals. Higher Still is a wide-ranging reform of
education at 16 to 18. It is designed to remove the outdated distinction
between ''academic'' and ''vocational'' education, to introduce a range
of courses and qualifications which may also be offered to those with
special educational needs. The main problem is that the Government is
not committed to providing the funds which, in the opinion of everyone
involved in Scottish education, are necessary if this most ambitious and
complex plan is to become a reality. It is envisaged that Higher Still
courses will replace existing Highers, Sixth Year Studies qualifications
and National Certificate modular courses from August 1998 onwards.
Higher Still courses will be offered in 28 ''subject'' areas,
including some unfamiliar in the secondary school, such as Care,
Hospitality, Travel and Tourism. There will be a total of 184
''courses'' plus 1500 ''additional units''. It is quite clear that no
comprehensive secondary school and no further education college will
offer the full Higher Still ''menu''. Selectivity (of a kind) and
prioritisation will be the order of the day.
The options for a typical secondary school will range from the
minimalist to the quite radical. A minimalist solution would result in a
particular school offering those parts of Higher Still which most
closely correspond to its existing provision and which fit in with its
existing staffing profile. A radical solution would involve the school
in providing a full general education to age 16 but then offering a
specialist ''menu'' in S5 and S6. For example, one school could
specialise in Hospitality, another in Information Technology, another in
Modern Languages, another in Physical Education (including sport) etc.
If this sounds too revolutionary, we should remember that specialist
music and dance units are already provided in education authority
schools in Strathclyde and Lothian and that youngsters with potential in
these fields are encouraged to enrol in the schools having these units,
with the full blessing of the education authority. I have never
understood why this kind of specialism is officially approved of but
other kinds of specialisation are anathema.
What underlies official attitudes, I believe, is the fear that
specialisation would be a slippery slope leading to academic selection.
I do not accept that this need be the case. On the contrary, carefully
planned specialisation, by boosting particular ''subject'' areas, would
tend to undermine the rationale of ''across the board'' academic
selectivity. We should remember that such academic selectivity is
already entrenched in the fee-paying schools in the four cities and
elsewhere. If a school were to become a ''centre of excellence'' in, for
example, sport, this would insert a new element into the jigsaw of
educational provision in an urban area and might induce some
middle-class parents to review their stereotyped views of the ''pecking
order'' of the schools in their area.
Of course there is a considerable number of provisos which would have
been made and many problems to be teased out before such a scheme could
be credibly launched. One important proviso would be that all schools
would provide a traditional broad Scottish education to age 16. Standard
Grade should be maintained as the culmination of this stage of
education. (It is worth noting, in passing, that many teachers believe
that Standard Grade is actively threatened by Higher Still. Its value as
the main assessment instrument at the end of the period of compulsory
education needs to be emphasised.) Any specialisation would be strictly
at post-16. Furthermore, even at S5 and S6, all schools would need to
maintain a curriculum broad enough to deliver all the Core Skills. There
could be no questions, for example, of a specialist school not providing
Higher Still courses in English and Mathematics.
It will be legitimately argued that the kind of scheme I have outlined
could not be delivered in rural areas. Perfectly true. On the other
hand, schools in small towns in rural areas are recognised as being good
at delivering the benefits of comprehensive education as they were
conceived 25 years ago. Certainly the communitarian spirit in such areas
is strong and, because of a mixture of principle and geographical
imperative, placing requests are few and far between. Such schools will
survive the holocaust of local government reform and Higher Still,
though they will not necessarily be unscathed.
Another question which would need to be addressed would be the
position of a youngster who had attended a secondary school for four
years and then discovered that the specialism which he or she desired
was not on offer in that school. There would have to be a facility for
transfer at the end of S4 to a school offering the required specialism.
Something like this occurs at present when a young person moves to
further education at the end of S4.
However, the benefits of such a scheme for a ''non-magnet'' school in
an urban area, threatened with closure after 1996, could be
considerable. By establishing a high profile in a specialist Higher
Still curricular area, it could bring about a vital inflow of committed
pupils and their committed parents. This could be the salvation of the
school.
The initiative would lie primarily with the school teaching staff, but
it would have to be supported by the existing parent body and by the new
education authority. In selecting a specialist area, the school would
draw on its particular strengths, but it would need to have regard to
what its neighbour schools were deciding.
Because I wished to be reassured that this proposal was not a wild
card, to be instantly killed by the conservative forces in Scottish
education, I ''bounced'' it during the last week on two audiences of
very different character. I was surprised that, in both cases, the idea
was deemed worthy of further serious consideration.

EARTHMOVING equipment to paper group J Bibby swung back into the black
in the full year, reversing a loss of #10.7m into a #32.9m pre-tax
surplus.
The previous year carried substantial provisions and so a fairer
comparison is at the operating level where there was an improvement from
#29.6m to #41.0m.
Turnover rose from #629m to #736m.There was a #10m swing into profits
of #9.2m in capital equipment because of the strength of demand in Spain
and Portugal.
Bibby power has experi-
enced a squeeze on margins but #10m is being invested in the Devon

SCOTTISHPOWER director Duncan Whyte and wife Marion yesterday made a
pre-tax profit of #227,682 on the exercise of share options.
Most of this gain was realised through the sale of the shares
acquired, although Mrs Whyte held on to shares worth #48,680.
Mr Whyte, at 48 the longest-serving executive director of the
Glasgow-based electricity company, exercised options to buy 101,321
shares at 227p and a further 72,016 at 243p.
He subsequently disposed of 10,000 of these shares at 365p and, for
tax planning reasons, gifted the remaining 163,337 shares to his wife.
She then sold 150,000 of these shares at 365p.

BRITISH Polythene Industries (BPI) has purchased the Excelsior group
of companies, which trade bulk polythene products and manufacture
polythene bags in the Midlands and North Wales, for #2m.
BPI company secretary Ray Brooksbank said the acquisition would
provide new outlets for BPI products throughout the UK.
''It gives us a much wider customer base for our products than we
enjoy . . . it gives us the opportunity to get in contact with a lot of
the smaller industrial user accounts,'' he said.
The privately-owned Exelsior Group employs 45 people at locations in
Stoke-on-Trent in the Midlands and Hollywell in Clwyd, North Wales.
It trades polythene products throughout the UK.
Greenock-based BPI paid #592,800 in cash for the three Excelsior group
firms -- Exelsior Packaging, Paramount Packaging and Excelsior
Polyfilms.

While the prospect of a black American President was tantalisingly
close, Neelam Bakshi says that in Britain we are still far from
achieving a fair proportion of black MPs, let alone a black Premier.
COLIN Powell has just announced that he will not be standing either
for the presidency or any elected office in 1996. In the UK, we are
nowhere near a debate about a black Prime Minister -- we have not yet
seen a black Minister.
''Black'' is a political description including those of
African-Caribbean descent, as well as people of Asian, including
Chinese, descent. It is not a description of skin colour.
In the Westminster Parliament there are currently six black MPs --
five Labour (Diane Abbot, Paul Boateng, Bernie Grant, Piara Khabra and
Keith Vax), and one Conservative (Nirj Deva). All the Labour MPs were
elected in areas with a high black population, high black party
membership, and for those first elected in 1987, significant political
pressure from Labour Party Black Sections which won the compromise Black
Socialist Society after 10 years of lobbying.
If our Parliament was representative of the numbers of black people
throughout the UK, we would have more than 30 black MPs, and half would
be women. On a purely numerical basis, Scotland would have one black MP
-- but then we're not talking about quotas.
The argument is not about a numbers game. Numbers are only one
indicator of a fair society. The issue is whether all our people have
fair and equal access to participation and representation in this
so-called ''democracy''.
There has been a clear recognition that women are under-represented in
government at local and national levels. The Labour Party has taken
steps to tackle this with rules about quotas for office-bearers in all
sections of the party as well as the more publicly known ''all-women
shortlists'' in certain parliamentary seats. The Scottish Constitutional
Convention, with representation from a wide range of institutions,
recommended a gender balance in the proposed Scottish Parliament.
Nowhere are we seeing similar recommendations for fair representation of
black people.
The major issue is whether black people are entitled to have a voice
in this country's decision-making process. If so, and I believe we do,
why are black people not being selected and elected in seats up and down
the country -- in all parties?
We cannot escape one conclusion, which is that all political parties,
reflecting society itself, have institutionalised racist practices. It
is usually not so obvious as the overt and obnoxious racist comments
made when John Taylor was selected as the Tory parliamentary candidate
in Cheltenham, or when Labour Party members in Scotland zealously
applied the rule of membership of a trade-union and kept out a number of
self-employed Asian men -- a matter which was sorted within days of
being brought to the attention of Jimmy Allison, former Scottish Labour
Party organiser.
There are other reasons, including the alienation of black people from
British party politics. Issues affecting them do not seem to form a
major part of the agenda, except in further repression.
Immigration remains a major concern as black people find again and
again that family members are prevented from coming as short-term
visitors to weddings, and families are disrupted by the over-zealous
application of racist immigration laws -- seen starkly in Glasgow in the
ongoing case of Moraya Scanlon, a woman deported with her British-born
child for not complying with the ''primary purpose rule'' (to show the
primary purpose was not immigration, cohabitation must last at least one
year). Her crime -- leaving an abusive husband within a year of
marriage. The Howard proposals demanding that employers act as surrogate
immigration officers are further evidence of oppression.
Black people, like their white counterparts, face problems of
unemployment, poverty, bad health, insufficient provision. They also
face racism -- overt and covert, and there is a mountain of research
showing this disadvantages them economically as well as educationally
and socially.
One or two more black MPs will not shift this burden. But it should be
made clear that the mere presence of black people does begin to shift
attitudes as white people watch their language, consider the equality
implications of their proposals, and in personal interactions discover
that black people are not aliens -- just people with different
backgrounds, experience and perspectives which are valuable in debates
which should reflect the views of the whole of society.
The argument for fair representation applies equally to black people
and women -- that the range of experiences, perspectives and priorities
are not being reflected in the white, men-only club ethos of
Westminster. The argument is not that women should exclusively represent
women and similarly a black MP should not be expected to represent only
black people.
Most white MPs would not expect to receive requests for assistance
from people several hundred miles away as a black MP will -- simply
because they will be known to black people up and down the country who
may not even know their own MP. This is borne out by the type of
correspondence I receive as a councillor, and by comments made at public
meetings in Scotland to black MPs in England -- ''But you are our MP --
who else do we have to turn to?'' despite the work done by many white
MPs in Scotland. Black MPs carry an unreasonable burden -- being
expected to represent all black communities and solve racist legislation
overnight.
The solution is not just to increase the number of Black MPs and share
the burden, but also to enable black people to participate fully in all
political parties so that attitudes, policies and practices reflect the
demands of a fair society, and society itself does not limit black
people's aspirations and achievements.
We have come so far in recognising this for women, with Labour and
Liberal Democrats agreeing gender balance for candidates to a Scottish
Parliament. But gender is not the only equality.

ELECTRICITY sales for August were up 3.6% on the previous year as
customers switched on cooling equipment to higher levels to cope with
the hot weather.
Figures published by the Electricity Association show that
manufacturing industries increased their demand for electricity by 6.4%
compared with the same period last year. The rise also reflected the
growth in manufacturing output during August.
Industrial electricity prices continued to fall due to increased
competition. In the second quarter of 1995, prices to small customers
were 9.9% lower compared with the same period last year.

FUND manager Warne Investment and Financial Services, one of four
financial subsidiaries which Glasgow-based tea trader James Finlay is
trying to sell, has been handed down the largest fine issued by Imro
this year.
London-based Warne was fined #80,000 -- more than its annual profits
-- for breaching a number of rules between November 1991 and May last
year.
Proceedings were brought against Warne for failing to ensure fair
treatment of customers, arising from conflicts of interest, and not
recording the intended allocation of investments to customers.
The main bone of contention was related to Warne's involvement, three
years ago, in underwriting a rights issue by engineering company
Burnfield.
It sold Burnfield shares to 20 customers without telling them it was
taking a profit on the transaction as well as underwriting commission.
While admitting Warne's compliance had not been up to scratch,
managing director Bill Stevens considered the fine ''extraordinarily
large''.
He added that there had been no complaints either to Imro or to his
company by Warne's clients regarding the matters which the fund manager
was disciplined over.
Mr Stevens said Warne had learned a lot of lessons and its compliance
procedures were much improved.
James Finlay finance director Pat Lockett admitted the parent
company's disappointment at the size of the fine.
He confirmed that previously-announced plans to sell James Finlay's
remaining financial subsidiaries were still on track.
Mr Lockett hopes agreements for the sale of Warne, James Finlay Bank,
James Finlay Asset Finance and James Finlay Investment Management will
have been successfully negotiated by the end of December.

They are untrained members of the public, often confused by
complicated fraud cases and sometimes subjected to the macabre details
of horrific murder trials but Bruce McKain believes the jury is a vital
part of the legal system
BY now there must be thousands of breakfast-time readers who are
quickly turning over the pages of their morning paper rather than have
to digest the latest diet of horror from the Rosemary West trial.
It is easy to understand that reaction when supposedly hard-bitten
journalists are being offered counselling to help them cope with the
ordeal of covering the case.
One has every sympathy with them, but at least the newspaper readers
have a choice of what to read and the journalists can always leave court
for 10 minutes if the gruesome details become too hard to bear.
It is also worth remembering that what is being placed before the
public in reports by newspapers, TV and radio is very much a sanitised
version of the actual evidence led in court.
Editors take the view that the reading, viewing, and listening public
should be spared the most unpalatable physiological and sexual details.
The people who are more in need of counselling and utterly deserving
of our sympathy, not just in cases of this kind, are the members of the
jury, 12 or 15 of them depending on which side of the Border they are
sitting.
Lord Devlin once said that our system of trial by jury makes no
logical sense at all. We take a group of ordinary people at random, give
them no training, put them into an alien environment where people talk
in a strange formal language and surround them with rules specifically
designed to keep parts of the truth from them.
We then expect them after days, weeks, and sometimes months of
confusing and contradictory evidence to come up with the right answer
time after time.
When, inevitably, they sometimes get it wrong, they are made the
scapegoats for the failures of lawyers and the legal system.
There was widespread amazement, for example, at the verdict in the O J
Simpson trial, but instead of lambasting the jury perhaps the finger of
guilt should have been pointed at the dubious practices of the Los
Angeles Police Department.
While the West case may be unique because of the sheer amount of
carnage involved, juries in Scotland are faced with this kind of
evidence on a smaller scale every day.
Jurors have been known to take ill when confronted with colour
pictures of a murder victim and in one recent case at the High Court in
Edinburgh a juror had to be excused after the evidence made him faint.
The prosecution involved a body being hacked into pieces and
distributed in various bin bags around a Scottish city and the juror
involved, a butcher to trade, knew only too well the grisly details of
what had been done to the body.
It does not take a great leap of the imagination to believe that
jurors in these circumstances will be traumatised for a long time to
come, perhaps for the rest of their lives.
Macabre murder trials apart, juries are given a hard time in
complicated fraud cases.
One fraud trial at Glasgow dragged on for seven months after a series
of mishaps, including a juror who contracted chickenpox and a sheriff
who suffered food poisoning. This added to delays caused by family
bereavements and holidays.
Jurors may have gleaned some consolation from the fact that the
accused was eventually jailed for two years, but the conviction was
wiped out a year later when the appeal court decided the presiding
sheriff had made a series of mistakes in his legal guidance to them.
That should be a salutary reminder for those who take the view that
juries should be entirely supplanted by professional lawyers because
they would make fewer mistakes. It isn't necessarily so.
Complicated fraud cases are the area in which the anti-jury case has
been made out most strongly, but, again there are strong grounds for
arguing that the blame lies elsewhere.
Norman McFadyen, at the time head of the Crown Office Fraud Unit, said
in an interview in 1922: ''A jury isn't a handicap. It's a challenge to
make a case understandable and that's no bad thing.
''If lay people can no longer understand what's going on then the
whole point of a public court falls down. Besides, examples of a jury
acquittal when there was a solid basis for not doing so are very few and
far between.''
Edinburgh University is hosting a debate on Thursday on the question:
''Are Juries Obsolete?''
The issue to be considered is whether it is time to admit that juries
are out of their depth, no longer representative of the community and
unable to act as guarantors of a fair verdict.
Among the speakers will be Joe Duffy, whose daughter was the victim of
a brutal murder in a case in which the jury returned a verdict of not
proven.
The answer to the question must surely be a resounding No, because,
despite its imperfections, the jury system actually works.
For centuries juries have played an honourable role in our system of
justice and to abolish them because a few cases have gone wrong does not
make sense.
Juries command widespread support because of the close involvement of
the ordinary citizen in a system which is there to serve them. To
replace that with a system run exlusively by lawyers would be
undemocratic and unhealthy.
If jurors need counselling in particularly unpleasant cases then that
should be provided. And if a lawyer cannot present a fraud case in a way
juries can understand, he should be looking for another job.
To return to Lord Devlin: ''What makes juries worthwhile is that they
see things differently from the judges. Trial by jury is the lamp that
shows that freedom lives.''

FACED with changing market demands and technological advance, Scotland
must put greater emphasis on vocational training, to flourish in today's
competitive world climate, leading UK industrialists said yesterday.
The Walpole Committee, a think-tank of 30 of Britain's leading
companies, reached this consensus at a seminar in Glasgow.
George Bennett, a vice-president of the US-based electronics firm
Motorola and general manager of its Scottish operations, said he
believed Scotland was missing significant opportunities because
employees lacked practical training.
He said educators and employers must return to apprenticeships.
''The key ingredient is skills,'' Mr Bennett said. ''If you think of
the electronic content of your home today, and think of the electronic
content of your parents' home, and then think of the electronic content
of your grandparents' home, it might give you some indication of why
this (market) is changing.
''What I would like to see is the institutionalisation of trade
training, without limiting it to just younger people. We need to retrain
mature workers,'' he said.
Scott Grier, managing director of the Scottish airline Loganair,
agreed that firms need to aim their training efforts at a ''practical
skill level''.
He noted that ''25% of firms in manufacturing today report skill
shortages''.
''It is clear that we have neglected our greatest national asset --
our people,'' said Mr Grier, stressing the need for new skills focused
on the service sector.
David Grant, a director of William Grant &amp; Sons, said even a
traditional industry like the whisky trade needed to revamp its outlook
on business.
''Last year's World Economics Forum report placed the UK 32 out of 42
for in-company training,'' Mr Grant said. ''How can anyone benefit from
innovation without training?
''Throughout our company, traditional skills and innovation walk hand
in hand. They are not incompatible.''
Alistair MacFarlane, chancellor of Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University,
said there was a growing gap between the most and least-skilled workers
in Scotland's labour force.

FINANCIAL markets around the world were disrupted yesterday by the
game of brinkmanship being played out in the US between the Republican
Congress and the Democrat President. The dollar was also hit by a fresh
bout of weakness in the Mexican peso.
In London sentiment was upset by the unexpected buoyancy of the CBI's
distributive trades survey, which depressed hopes of lower interest
rates, and a newspaper report forecasting #5000m of tax cuts in the
Budget and a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for next year revised
up to #22bn.
But the effect of all these pressures on markets was less than might
have been feared. The FTSE-100 share index lost 18.2 points to 3523.4
and sterling's trade weighted index fell 0.3 to 83.8. The pound dropped
0.38 cents to $1.5760 and 0.57 pfennigs to DM2.2245.
At one point the Footsie was showing a loss of nearly 29 points and
the sterling index fell to 83.7. Shares prices in Frankfurt and Paris
lost even more ground.
The main talking point was the prospect, however remote, of the US
Government defaulting on debt repayments next week for the first time in
history. Analysts on both sides of the Atlantic said that if the worst
came to the worst the Admninistration would raid civil service pension
funds rather than default.
The Federal debt ceiling of $4900bn could be breached on Wednesday
when a $25bn repayment becomes due if President Clinton and Congress
cannot agree on legislation to increase the limit. The problem is that
the Republicans are attaching conditions the President could hardly
accept.
In Wall Street it is feared that the budget crisis could drag on until
Christmas or even longer and make it difficult for Federal Open Market
Committee to pare interest rates when it meets on December 19.
US Treasuries have fallen sharply in the last two sessions as the bond
market reacted to the possibility of a default for the first time. The
dollar, already under pressure when the Mexican peso dived to new lows,
fell below 100 yen in Tokyo before coming off the bottom.
Wall Street, which closed at a record level on Thursday night, has
escaped the worst of the sell-off. The crisis makes equities more
attractive than bonds.
In London, one analyst said: ''We seem to be more worried about the US
debt crisis than the Americans are.''
Recalling previous tugs-of-war over the budget, Wall Street analysts
called the present situation unprecedented.
''This is the most serious showdown they've had. It's bigger than in
1989,'' said economist Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution,
referring to Republican President George Bush's battle with the
then-Democratic-led Congress.
For months most investors dismissed talk of default as nothing more
than political posturing. Indeed, they revelled in the prospect that
Congress' tough tactics would, in the end, yield the kind of aggressive
deficit-reduction that many on Wall Street feel will benefit the
economy.
Now the issue seems to dominate financial markets next week and
possibly longer.

* HAVE you ever wondered what year it is when Jean-Luc Picard reads
out a string of numbers into the ship's log? Now you can find out for
just under a pony -- that's #25 in one earth language -- by buying the
Star Trek Next Generation wall clock, complete with the Federation badge
motif recognised in countless star systems.
Apart from a ship-time analogue clock which gives o'clock and half
past, it has a futuristic stardate liquid crystal digital display. Even
that old red Clydesider, chief engineer Scott, would have no difficulty
recognising the federation chronology. It looks suspiciously like BST to
us out here on the Frontiers.
Whatever the date, it's a future festive present for those who would
like to follow the star, wherever it is, at warp speed. Available from
the Science Museum catalogue on 0990-222586.
* FORGET the little 25-inch black box in the corner. It's simply
passe. The shape of television to come is a full eighty inches across.
The ProScan home theatre is a rear-projection model which has just made
its debut in Chicago. Thomson Consumer Electronics have beaten the
problems of grainy and dull wide screens so that, even in a brightly lit
room, it produces bright rich colours.
The giant screen TV uses advanced nine-inch optics -- sharper and
clearer than the normal seven-inch optics of comparable sets -- which
boost light output by more than 50%. The video amplifier generates 68
watts of picture power. Thomson say the combined power of the huge
screen and the audio system in a room environment challenges the cinema
for overall impact.
Totally controlled by a singe remote zapper, the RCA custom home
theatre needs barely a yard of wall depth. It's got full colour, 280
watt Dolby ProLogic sound receiver/amplifier, a five speaker in-wall
sound system with sub-woofer, laserdisc player, HiFi, VCR, component
cabinets and an accessories kit.
All that for just $17,000 at the top end. A steal! For the hoity-toity
who want their system built-in, there's a range of furniture systems to
fit virtually any room decor. This boosts the price to $25,000. But
there's no point in being stingy, is there?
* SCIENTISTS and garden hut innovators could be in danger of losing
their rights if they send in details of their gizmos to the BBC's
Tomorrow's World page on the Web. The warning comes from the Patents
Office which says people who reveal all will lose their rights to file
for patents. Apparently, TV programmes, newspapers, and other
organisations have been running competitions which might tempt inventors
into the limelight, and possibly out of the money. The basic rule is
file the patent first. Once that's done, tell Frontiers about it, and
maybe we'll tell the world.
* ONE simple but effective invention has been developed by a team of
schoolchildren in Teddington. They were keen to find a way of protecting
elderly people who live alone from the serious consequences of a minor
but immobilising injury. Their solution was not to keep an eye on them,
but to listen. They designed a microphone which is clamped to the water
mains and detects the sound of water in the pipes as kettles and baths
are filled or toilets flushed. If no sound is recorded at least once a
day, it triggers an alarm.
* OLD news is good news for American designer Michael Culpepper --
he's designed a chair made from old newspapers. The editions are glued
together into blocks and then simply cut out to the required shape.
After a few trials, the edges soften out to become very comfortable as
it moulds itself to fit the owner. Is it Rolling Stone which boasts: All
the News That Fits?
* AN independent international group of scientists and engineers led
by the National Environment Research Council has been asked by Tim
Eggar, Minister for Industry and Energy, to examine the scientific
considerations raised by the disposal of the Brent Spar. It's intended
for the group to consult widely in the scientific community; now why
didn't we think of that?
* THE ROPA scheme, Realising Our Potential Awards, aimed at
encouraging collaboration between industry and academic establishments,
has been a success, according to a review of the encryption system. The
chip was developed as a method of protecting electronic communications
with strong codes. The drawback is that law enforcement agencies had the
keys to the codes and could read the messages at will. Folk are worried
about invasion of privacy. If the Government can read what's going down
the line, we should all be worried.
* INFOTEK Multimedia seems to be top of the Christmas list this year.
Flagtower is offering a new series of military CD-ROM titles including
Space Race, World Wars I and II, plus War in the Pacific. The CDs
combine an interactive documentary style with high-quality footage to
create exciting viewing. Flagtower says the works are based on rigorous
research and contributions from some of the world's leading historians.
As well as offering what's described as a stimulating way to learn, the
CDs are very cinematic and flexible.
* CRAY Systems have launched Scotland's first Microsoft Development
Centre at Murrayfield Stadium. The MDC is described as a centre of
excellence for Microsoft products and services.
* EDINBURGH University has appointed Professor Richard Coyne to the
new Chair of Architectural Computing, the first in the UK. The
department of architecture has a long-standing reputation in computer
aided design research reaching back to the early seventies.

JOHN DAVIDSON considers the hues and cries of those who would be seen
in the world of glitzkreig.
AN apple a day keeps fashion meltdown at bay. That was my premise last
week in the Big Apple as one designer's runway cavalcade of pastel
shantung silk morphed into the next. Fortunately, even though fashion
ideas were a little thin on the ground, generous sponsorship of New
York's fashion week permitted free apples all round.
Sponsorship also permitted (courtesy of Clairol) free boxes of hair
colourant all round. No fashion pro would risk a humiliating hair colour
crisis half way through New York fashion week, and some models ought to
know better.
Our own lovely Kirsty Hume still has those pale blonde locks, and
looks even better than ever. But Nadja Auermann? Convinced that the
peroxide white-blonde which catapulted her to fame had now to go, she
first tried a disgusting shade of wet-tealeaf brown. Then tealeaf
streaked with blonde. Then true-brown brown. Then chestnut. Each dawn, a
new colour. By the weekend she had reached honey-beige.
Linda Evangelista wised up to the horror of her half-blonde,
half-brunette compromise hairstyle and went thoroughly brunette. Which
seemed to annoy the similarly-coiffured but completely kooky Kristen
McMenamy, who was spotted backstage chopping huge tufts off her own
hair, sealing it in an envelope addressed to the colourist responsible
-- marked ''ex-friend''.
My surviving friend, Sophia persuaded everyone she could muster last
Wednesday evening to try Flamingo East. ''It's full of young people; it
has a great atmosphere; it's open late; the food is fabulous; it's not
too expensive . . .'' She knew more feature-benefit selling points than
a Tupperware saleslady.
Sophia is Greek. And, as we already have her marbles it seemed
churlish not to accept her restaurant recommendation too. And the food
was delicious. But was it worth driving 40 blocks downtown for paper
tablecloths, regular bistro furniture, black and white floor tiles, and
eighties-style wall lights?
''Look,'' Sophia exclaimed, ''there's Madonna's brother. I told you
this was the place to be. And here comes Shalom. Oh my God! Kate Moss is
with her. And that strange girl who is supposed to be Madonna's ex. Oooh
ahrr. They're all moving to the table next to us.''
Perhaps Kirsty was home helping Nadja apply her newest hair colourant.
But pneumatic Naomi Campbell sashayed through the crowded bar to join
her modelling chums for a little light supper.
The accompanying legion of young bucks wore a touch too much eyeliner.
And -- lest you are interested -- blue seems to be the colour for nails.
For boys' nails. Justine from Elastica promptly moved her band several
tables away -- presumably to avoid corruption.
Marc Jacobs, another fashion firefly drawn that same evening to
Flamingo East, chose the glitzkrieg of The Plaza for his runway show.
The Grand Ballroom was packed with fashion pros, hangers-on and random
celebrities. Then there was the big-haired creature -- Atlanta Implanta
-- positioned right next to me, who repeatedly asked her boyfriend to
check whether I'd stolen her handbag. Yet.
As the show ended (yet another cavalcade of shantung), I considered
the possibility of a quick getaway. Even without her handbag. But
between me and the designated exit there was a major editorial pile-up.
Any alternative way out?
What might lurk behind this shabby green velvet curtain? I stepped
through and traversed a labyrinth of service corridors until my progress
was halted by a door. Bravely, I pushed ahead. Could this be a window
display at Saks Fifth Avenue? A shimmering sea of pastel sequins. Roses
piled to the ceiling. Everything that glittered? Gold -- or better.
Was I in a window display at Saks Fifth Avenue? Not quite. I was the
surprise guest at a particularly splendid Bar Mitzvah. My embarrassment
was so much more lasting than any of Nadja's hair colours.

Lawrence Lettice recalls the impact of a Scotsman of grand design on
the early days of the City of Dreams
LET me pose a question for today's film buffs: Who was the first
Scots-born actor to collect a Hollywood Oscar? The most obvious name
that immediately springs to mind would be Sean Connery -- but no. Think
back a few years -- back to that bygone era fondly remembered as
Hollywood's Golden Age. Let me help with a few clues: Elizabeth Taylor
winning The Grand National; James Stewart riding from Laramie on a
revenge quest; everyone's favourite loveable canine eventually finding
his way home; or a young boy learning the harsh lessons of life while
growing up in a Welsh mining village.
That last synopsis should perhaps give the biggest clue, for the film
in question was John Ford's much loved How Green Was My Valley, with the
young boy played by Roddy McDowell and his father portrayed by one,
Donald Crisp. Though the name, and most certainly the face, of Donald
Crisp should be readily familiar to older film enthusiasts, present day
movie fans are perhaps unaware of his importance and significance around
the formative years of Hollywood.
This fact was skilfully highlighted on Radio Scotland's recent film
magazine programme Movies and Shakers, who made Crisp their sole
subject, focusing on his extraordinary life.
He was born in 1880 in the small Perthshire town of Aberfeldy, though
even to this day there is some confusion concerning his exact origins.
Following a distinguished spell as a soldier fighting in the Boer War,
the young Crisp embarked on a new life in the United States, with his
fine singing voice leading to a stint as an actor and stage manager,
mixing with the likes of the Barrymores and George M. Cohan, before the
lure of the new entertainment industry on the West Coast, called motion
pictures, drew him to Hollywood.
The money was favourable and it offered the young Scotsman the
opportunity to act and direct, eventually amassing an enormous list of
screen credits. However, it was his meeting and eventual collaboration
with the great D W Griffith -- the man generally regarded as the father
of American film -- that fascinates film historians.
Crisp served as assistant director to Griffith on his masterpiece The
Birth of a Nation, as well as impersonating General Grant. Thus it was
Crisp who was chiefly responsible for marshalling the huge army of
extras throughout the filming of this epic's memorable battle scenes.
That alone would place Donald Crisp among the most important figures of
early Hollywood, but he also found time to work alongside such
luminaries as Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks and Lillian Gish. It was
with Gish that he gave a powerful and frightening performance as her
father in Griffith's production of Broken Blossoms, a film that shocked
American audiences at the time, due to the ferocity of Crisp's
characterisation.
When the silent era gave way to the new development of talking
pictures, Crisp laid down his director's megaphone and channelled his
energies into acting alone. The list of his co-stars reads like a
Hollywood's Who's Who -- everyone from Gable, Tracy, Flynn, to Bette
Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Mickey Rooney, and not forgetting a dog called
Lassie.
His output features such durable classics as: Mutiny on the Bounty,
The Charge of the Light Brigade, Wuthering Heights, National Velvet,
Lassie Come Home, The Man From Laramie and Greyfriars Bobby. He received
his Academy Award in 1941 for his portrayal of the stern patriach in
John Ford's How Green Was My Valley, a director he worked for on five
separate occasions.
Away from the cameras and sound-stages, Crisp displayed another facet
of his personality by utilising his shrewd financial brain and becoming
an adviser on the board of the Bank of Italy. This later transformed
itself into the Bank of America, with Crisp at the very hub of major
financial dealings.
How a Perthshire lad from seemingly modest beginnings became
instrumental distributing huge loans to various Hollywood Studios -- the
very studios who hired him to perform as a mere actor -- remains
shrouded in mystery.
Crisp retired from the screen in 1963. The list of his credits as
actor and director totals more than 400, certainly an amazing output by
anyone's standard. He lived out his last years alone -- his wife,
screenwriter Jane Murfin had died years before with no children -- and
he passed away in 1974.
With the centenary of cinema upon us, Scotland can take pride in this
forgotten son, who played an integral part in early film history and,
with the strong possibility of a commemorative plaque being erected in
his honour in his home town of Aberfeldy, a reassessment to his talent,
versatility and longevity should rescue his memory from cinematic
obscurity.

IT'S my theory that Michael Dobbs still works for the Conservative
Party. After all, the point about The Final Cut (BBC1, Sunday), as
brought to the screen by the ubiquitous Andrew Davies, is not that it
provides any real insight into the foulness of politicians but that it
persuades us, with its richness of detail and its laconic cynicism, that
we are being given a peek.
This must be useful to someone.
Real political sleazeballs are nowhere near as artful as this, after
all; none really sparkle like maggots on a carcass; few are genuinely
eloquent in explaining their craft and their cunning. Most just make
things up as they go along, and are dull with it. Unlike Francis
Urquhart, they have no style at all. The Final Cut, the primus inter
pares of hokum, does not interrogate reality, it impersonates reality.
But what is the show without its claim to be an insider's account,
albeit heightened for comic effect? A distraction, mostly, feeding off
public cynicism while being careful to avoid too close an association
with the real thing.
Hence, one suspects, the spurious controversy initiated by Dobbs over
the opening Burial of the Bitch, as invented by Davies. That, it would
seem, was too true to be good as far as the author was concerned, and
too close to home.
Otherwise, however, this third series, like its predecessors, is
Whitehall farce played with a straight face. It doesn't seek to defend a
Tory government (Mr Dobbs isn't that much of an artist) but it shifts
politics into the realms of parody and farce, and moves real politicians
out of harm's way.
This thought supports my other pet theory: there is nothing at all
subversive about British television. For every Daily Mail columnist
wetting himself over the vices of Channel 4 (notice, if you will, how
the BBC under Birt has ceased to be a target) there are a dozen stout,
solid shows out there working to preserve the Institutions We Cherish.
Admittedly, this project is becoming more than a little risible, if
only because there are now so few institutions left that have not yet
been invaded by documentary crews. Short of the Royal Military Police
(Redcaps, BBC1, Thursday) which groups of raw recruits remained to be
filmed? The catering corps? Traffic wardens? Initiates to life within a
hand-picked, rapid-reaction brass band? There must now be handbooks
issued to the makers of this sort of thing.
First, find the one who'll crack and fail. Then look for some kid who
will struggle but pull through. Grab a few clashes of personality. Have
a reverential voice-over explaining how some piece of farcical cruelty
is essential to morale. Above all, resist irony or humour or the
temptation to ask serious questions.
But ask yourself: why are the forces so co-operative when these
projects are proposed? Not, one guesses, because they're bad for
business.
Not, one suggests, because they are anything less than very useful
indeed at a time of defence cuts. The brass know a handy cliche when
they see one.
Thus there was absolutely nothing new about Redcaps. In style it
resembled every other documentary on the forces you have ever seen,
right down to the oafish RSM bawling ''Shiny boots; shiny mind!'' to a
recruit who plainly hadn't the faintest clue what this bizarre slogan
was supposed to mean. Yet not once did it seek to ask the only
interesting question: just why does any soldier actually volunteer to be
a cop, the most despised breed in the army?
Questions unanswered might have been the theme of Omnibus: Foundation
Course in Art (BBC1, Thursday), in which the two members of the
so-called K Foundation spent 50 minutes trying and failing to explain
why they went to Jura and set light to #1m in new #50 notes.
It was art, they said. But why was it art? Well, it proved they would
''go all the way'' and they didn't care who knew it. But why would that
matter? They didn't really know the answer to that, either; indeed, we
saw them conducting a series of painfully silly debates in an effort to
discover why anyone should torch so much money. No-one seemed to know.
Worse, no-one seemed to really care.
At its end, aside from the nasty odour of a desperate public relations
gambit, this shoddy piece left the image of two grown men gradually
coming to terms with the sickening realisation that they might, just
might, have made the biggest mistake of their lives. Unless, of course,
you count the duff pop records that had left them with money to burn in
the first place.
Money and pop are both funny things, though not if you were a member
of the Small Faces. Without Walls (Channel Four, Tuesday) told a
too-familiar story of talented London boys ensnared in the wonderful
world of showbiz accountancy, but it did so with charm and real
affection.
Back then, these young Mods, a quartet of cheeky chaps with pixie
grins, thought they knew it all. Now, with singer Stevie Marriott dead,
bassist Ronnie Lane struggling against multiple sclerosis, and each of
the survivors grizzled by age and the usual self-abuses, they seemed
bewildered.
It wasn't just the money, gone like the hair of yesteryear, but the
thought that seemed to lurk behind each rueful face: they were never as
good again. The best years of their lives had passed, unnoticed, and
left them with nothing but law suits and regrets. Try making a chirpy
tune out of that.
Did J. Paul Getty, who had the best of everything, ever have a good
year? Measured in bank statements and bought women, the appalling old
creature had a rare old time; estimated according to the damage done to
those around him, it seems likely he never once drew a kindly breath.
Network First: The Gettys -- A Tragedy of Riches (ITV, Tuesday) told a
familiar story, but told it well. Getty's breathtaking meanness -- he
once even billed his son for lunch at home -- seemed like a symbol of an
indifference so deep, an ego so vast, that personal cruelty began to
seem almost incidental. Hollow, grasping and poisonous himself, Getty
remade all those around him in his own image.
Thus the deaths, the drugs, the Aids, the adulteries and the famous
kidnapping of his grandson that seemed, at best, an inconvenience to a
man who could have told the K Foundation all they need to know about the
real meaning of money. The only art, as this fine piece of work showed,
is in holding on to what you've got, no matter what.

ALLIED Leisure is buying Granada's ten-pin bowling business for a
maximum of #19.8m cash.
The acquisition is to be partly financed by a two-for-three rights
issue at 34p a share to raise #15.8m. The rights issue has been fully
underwritten by Panmure Gordon.
Allied Leisure has entered into a new banking facility with the Royal
Bank of Scotland and Midland Bank for a total of #14m.
The Granada business comprises 19 bowling units spread across the UK,
predominantly in South-east England, with a total of 493 bowling lanes.
Around 600 employees are expected to transfer to Allied Leisure. All
but two of the units are profitable. In the year to Sepember 30, 1994,
the business had turnover of #18.1m and made a profit of #2.4m. Fixed
assets at that date were #12.2m.
Allied Leisure's core bowling business increased its like-for-like
sales by 5.8% last year. The prolonged hot weather in the summer reduced
demand at the start of this financial year but cooler weather has since
seen a recovery in sales.

Gavin Bell talks to Orkney's great weaver of stories and finds him
lamenting the spoken heritage of his people
THE long, dark cloak of winter is descending on Orkney. Already the
gales have
come, and it is time to batten down the hatches, stoke up the fire,
and snuggle up with a good book.
It is an echo of an ancient tradition on the islands, of gathering
around the hearth for story-telling when the harvest is in and the
shadows are lengthening. The old ways have been eroded by television and
other modern intruders, but they die hard. The mobile library that tours
the scattered communities of Orkney throughout the year is never short
of customers.
With perfect timing, a new book entitled Winter Tales has appeared on
its shelves by courtesy of George Mackay Brown, the islands' native
story-teller and poet. Like most of his work, Brown's latest collection
is inspired by the rhythms of the land and sea around him, and by old
customs and beliefs; when he was a boy, there were still women in the
fishing villages who fed seagulls in the belief they were the spirits of
lost sailors.
He is a time-traveller, meandering through Orkney's rich history of
rural mystics and seafarers to cull his imaginative tales. Thus in
Winter Tales, Lieutenant William Bligh comes to the little port of
Hamnavoe, tinkers and crofters mingle with shipwrecked sailors, and we
follow Norse warriors to the Holy Land.
There is poetic imagery in the stories, but there is a note of sadness
in a brief foreword in which Brown laments that the tradition of
story-telling ''has withered before the basilisk stare of newsprint,
radio, television''. He observes that few modern stories hold children
from play, and old men from the chimney corner.
''Every community on earth is being deprived of an ancient necessary
nourishment,'' he writes. ''We cannot live fully without the treasury
our ancestors have left to us. Without the story -- in which everyone
living, unborn, and dead, participates -- men are no more than 'bits of
paper blown on the cold wind . . .' ''
It is a bleak prospect, but in the meantime Brown is happy to continue
spinning his lyrical yarns as long as he is able, in the hope that they
will survive in one form or another. ''I don't think literature will
remain as we've known it in the past,'' he says. ''I think there will
still be an audience for story-telling, but it might be there will be
less books and it will come on tapes and television.''
Inevitably, he suggests, some of the magic will be lost: ''Watching a
play or a story on television, you're not really stimulated
imaginatively or intellectually. When you read a book, you have to
co-operate with the writer. The whole thing is not rounded out until you
have created your own images and formed your own opinions. It is a far
richer experience.''
We are sitting in the living-room of Brown's council house in
Stromness, a harbour town overlooking the hills of Hoy that has changed
relatively little in more than 200 years. It was from this bay, on the
edge of the great natural harbour of Scapa Flow, that Orkneymen set sail
on the great whaling expeditions of the nineteenth century, and were
recruited to work for the Hudson's Bay Company in the icy wilderness of
northern Canada. It is an ideal place for Brown to write about them.
His house is in a square off the main street, a narrow thoroughfare
paved with flagstones that winds among a network of alleys behind the
waterfront. One window overlooks a museum, which has relics of old
civilisations vividly portrayed in Brown's books, and a small jetty
dotted with lobster creels. Nowhere in Orkney is far from the sea.
The author looks out of the window and says: ''Orkney used to be full
of sailors, but there's hardly any now. There's no shipping industry.
It's a very strange situation for a maritime nation not to be building
ships.''
Brown is mildly surprised to have survived longer than Britain's
shipyards -- he has just turned 74 -- thanks to drugs introduced in the
1950s that cured him of tuberculosis. ''When I first contracted TB they
didn't have a cure for it at all. You just lay in bed and hoped for the
best, and in nine cases out of 10 you died. But I was lucky, I managed
to hold on till the new drugs came along.''
Another source of wonder to this gentle and modest man is his
successful career. The youngest son of a Stromness postman, he wandered
through a rather aimless youth, collecting an honours degree in English
literature at Edinburgh University, with no inkling of the fame and
fortune that awaited him.
''I never thought I would ever be a writer,'' he recalls. ''When I was
a schoolboy I just liked writing composition, that was the only thing I
was good at. I sometimes wondered what it would be like to write a book,
but I never for one moment imagined that I ever would. It was just an
impossible dream, but it came to pass after a time.''
A lifetime and dozens of books of stories and poems later, Brown is
still happiest when he is writing, which he does in the way he always
has -- with pen and paper on his kitchen table after he has cleared the
breakfast dishes away. He never got the hang of the typewriter, and has
no intention of meddling with new-fangled devices like word processors.
He is bewildered by systems such as Internet, for which he has no use
anyway. A lady up the road does his typing for him.
One senses that perhaps his books, with their familiar themes and
traditions, provide an escape from the realities of a changing world
that make him uneasy. ''The older you get the more you dislike change,
and foresee a wee bit of gloom ahead,'' he says. ''But there's going to
be terrible problems in the next century for the whole of humanity. How
is it possible to disinvent the atomic bomb, for example? There's the
danger of little despots getting their hands on it. Maybe there's a way
out of it, but it'll stretch our ingenuity to the limit.''
Even through the medium of television, however, which Brown refers to
as ''that tyrant in the corner'' of his living-room, such global hazards
seem remote in Orkney. Of more immediate concern to him is an
impoverishment of the English language, and in particular of its
regional variations, in the era of mass communications. Words and
idiomatic expressions are the tools of what he regards as his trade, and
he fears that many are being lost among all the electronic wizardry.
''The language is not as rich as it was when I was a boy, especially
in the country districts. They had a beautiful way of speaking, full of
old words, rich, meaningful words, but that's all been eroded. I think
newspapers and radio and television have had a lot to do with it, and
maybe schools too. Much of the pungency and flavour has gone.''
Which brings him back to the demise of story-telling: ''Most of the
stories were told in winter-time. They were still at it when I was a
boy. There were so many ships and seamen in Stromness, bringing stories
from all over the world. But they don't do that any more, it's all dead
and gone.''
When Brown speaks of the days when the harbour was thronged with
ships, it is easy to imagine them. He has a way with words, economic yet
vivid, which conjures images of Picts and Vikings and eighteenth-century
pirates as if they were passing outside his window. After listening to
him, it would come as no great surprise to find a Norse longboat tied up
at the jetty.
Yet he insists he has never mastered the art of oral story-telling,
and that writing comes easier. ''I know people who are very good at it,
they can make stories vivid and marvellous, but I can't do it. I become
fluent as soon as I sit down with a Biro in my hand, and a few sheets of
paper before me.''
Brown's long hair is white now, and his frame has become lighter with
age and illness, but his creative power is undiminished. He is presently
working on a new collection of Christmas stories, and another volume of
poems, and enjoying every minute of it. ''I wouldn't do it if I didn't
like it. It's the best part of the day,'' he says. ''If I begin to feel
my powers waning, I'll call it a day then.'' An autobiography has been
completed, but it will not be published in his lifetime, in accordance
with his distaste for personal publicity.
Meanwhile he has been offering his fellow islanders a few suggestions
for winter reading in his weekly Orcadian newspaper column. A
Shakespeare play, perhaps, an Orwell novel, a bit of Dickens, and a dip
into Boswell's Life of Johnson and Edwin Muir's Collected Poems feature
in his eclectic selection.
He does not include any of his own works, but there is probably no
need to. When the nights grow long and the wind rattles the windowpanes,
Winter Tales will be read with pleasure around more than one Orkney
fireside.

BILL McFARLAN seems to be taking advantage of his own ''high-profile''
status in his numerous attacks on the police service for allegedly
leaking information to the press concerning the activities of so-called
celebrities (November 7).
I think he should direct his feelings of outrage towards his fellow
journalists and indeed newspaper editors. After all, the only way leaked
information can be brought to public notice is by having it published.

THE recent disclosure by a Labour MP that a civil servant handed him a
leaked document containing information from Peter Lilley to William
Waldegrave was passed off by the MP as just the cut and thrust of
Parliament, and indeed he could expect and accept similar leaks in a
future Labour government.
The propriety of the situation does not appear to be questioned and we
are left with the unanswered questions: was the civil servant
politically motivated and/or did he receive any monetary gain for his
disclosure?
Presumably this servant of the public is still busying himself with
his official duties and has given little thought to the Official Secrets
Act which he was required to sign on becoming a civil servant.

BILL McFARLAN seems to be taking advantage of his own ''high-profile''
status in his numerous attacks on the police service for allegedly
leaking information to the press concerning the activities of so-called
celebrities (November 7).
I think he should direct his feelings of outrage towards his fellow
journalists and indeed newspaper editors. After all, the only way leaked
information can be brought to public notice is by having it published.
Robert Johnstone,

I FEEL I must comment on Bill McFarlan's letter on police tactics
surrounding the photograph of Julia Somerville's daughter.
The police, in my view, were only carrying out their duty by
investigating an incident reported to them.
Mr McFarlan, I feel, seems to think that celebrities are above
committing offences and should be treated differently from the rest of
us.

I WAS astounded to read that Kwik-Fit Insurance Services received a
grant of #2.5m to help with the setting up of its business.
Mr Tom Farmer must be one of the richest men in Britain, Kwik-Fit is
the 16th largest company in Scotland, and the partner in the business,
insurance broker Alexander &amp; Alexander, is one of the largest, if not
the largest, insurance broker in the world.
No doubt it will be claimed that 200 jobs have been created in a
Lanarkshire black spot, but I understand that most of the jobs are
part-time, which will no doubt save the company on NI contributions.
In addition, since the company is not creating a new product, it will
merely take business from other insurance firms and cause redundancies
equating the new jobs.
Why should the taxpayer be subsidising the new business? It seems to
prove that money attracts money which is not available to small firms.

THE Scottish Law Agents' Society views with concern the decision of
the Scottish Office to revive the Scottish Conveyancing and Executry
Services Board which had been suspended in 1992 because of the poor
housing market, with the suspension being continued in 1994, as the
housing market had not significantly improved.
The housing market remains depressed and the supply of conveyancing
services in many areas already exceeds demand. In the West of Scotland
particularly, telephone requests for fee quotations have become a common
occurrence, causing keen competition among solicitors' firms for the
available work. The society is concerned that in many instances the fees
being charged do not appear to reflect either the responsibility
involved or modern office overheads.
If licensed conveyancers are introduced, then it is essential they
have professional indemnity insurance, a Guarantee Fund, a complaints
system, accounts rules, and accountant's certificate rules in line with
the requirements imposed upon solicitors. All of these requirements mean
overheads and the cost of rent and rates, staff salaries, etc, will be
no different for licensed conveyancers than they are for solicitors.
Given the competition which exists among solicitors for conveyancing
work, it is regrettable that the term ''monopoly'' continues to be used.
The legal profession has not been able to absorb all the law graduates
seeking traineeships and this has led to considerable disappointment and
frustration for the unplaced graduates. Will there be work for students
embarking on courses to become licensed conveyancers?

SHAREHOLDERS will be encouraged by a recent parliamentary written
reply by the Trade and Industry Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, in which he said
that the Government intends to look at the rules on how matters of
concern can be raised by shareholders at company meetings, and how
annual meetings can be made more democratic.
These are issues for which the United Kingdom Shareholders'
Association has campaigned for some time.
One of the biggest problems facing a shareholder who wishes to raise
an issue is obtaining the support of a sufficient number of like-minded
shareholders. This was one of the reasons UKSA was formed.
The next hurdle is overcoming the proxy votes which are often given to
a chairman by institutions that do not even attend the meeting to hear
the arguments.
The declining numbers of ordinary shareholders as against the
institutional and disenfranchised nominal account holders -- down from
66% 30 years ago to less than 20% today -- is a cause for concern.
Reform is very necessary to make the block votes of the institutions
more democratic and accountable. After all, institutions are made up of
ordinary folk through their pensions, unit trust holdings, or insurance
policies.
Mr Lang said the matter would be addressed next year and that it would
be a consultation process. It is to be hoped that the intention is
indeed early next year, and that the consultation leads to effective
action.

HANNAH STIRLING raises several issues which must be redressed in the
interests of accuracy (October 31).
At the request of the park authority we consulted the governing bodies
of sport involved in Loch Lomond and submitted their views in March,
1994. We received no response from the park authority. The Scottish
Sports Council considers consultation to mean a two-way dialogue. This
did not happen.
Once the district councils, on behalf of the park authority, submitted
the by-laws to the Secretary of State for confirmation the Scottish
Sports Council's only mechanism to improve or amend them was to lodge an
objection.
Since the council was not advised that the by-laws were to be
submitted, this was the only option available. The council's action
cannot therefore be considered as belated or last minute.
After submission of the by-laws to the Scottish Office the chairman of
the park authority accepted that amendments were required. Unfortunately
at this stage the by-laws had been submitted for confirmation, therefore
any such amendments could only be made by the Secretary of State.
The Scottish Sports Council lodged objections on behalf of all sport.
Five governing bodies of sport, in addition to the Scottish Sports
Council, have objected to the by-laws. The council strongly refutes
again any suggestion that we are exclusively interested in water ski-ing
on the loch, although it is fair to say that powered water sports would
be potentially the most affected under the proposals.
The Scottish Sports Council, like your correspondent, is concerned
about irresponsible boat handling and actually suggested that the
by-laws include a driving qualification requirement; something which is
currently beyond the scope of by-laws but which the council considered
worth raising with the Scottish Office.
It is irresponsible to apportion blame for the recent fatal accident
on the loch without being privy to all the facts. It is accepted that
the by-laws can never ensure experienced and responsible boat handling.
I sincerely hope that correctly drafted by-laws will be in force well
before next summer.

IT has been established by careful monitoring through controlled
trials that hypnotics such as Temazepam produce only a short-term change
in sleep pattern.
Many patients, especially the elderly, become habituated or dependent
(but not addicted) after the first, possibly quite short, course of this
type of medication. They sleep better for a few weeks and then revert to
their previous, less acceptable, sleep pattern. However, if the drug is
stopped they sleep very badly for a week or two, in effect a withdrawal
symptom.
Many GPs, however, have neither the time nor the inclination to take
their patients through that difficult period. It is a fact that 99% of
people get as much sleep as they need 99% of the time but often not as
much as they would like.
I have lost count of the number of people who have insisted that they
do not sleep a wink and to whom I have said, ''Well, I am on duty
tonight, all night, and I am inviting you to phone me every hour on the
hour.'' No-one ever has.

IT IS not a cheery thought, but of all that comes with life, only
death is certain. Its inevitability is a fact with which we all have to
come to terms -- but how many do? Jung declared that life was like a
parabola and that mental health in the latter half was dictated by how
we faced up to this great issue.
On a practical level we can do so by making a will. I would argue that
everyone should have a will. In addition to keeping the bureaucrats from
dancing on your grave, and making matters easier for your next of kin,
it is about the only way you can be sure your wishes will be clearly
known about what happens after your death to your money, your body, and
your possessions and even what happens at your funeral.
Since few of us have a fortune or a complicated estate to dispose of,
a simple will drawn up at little cost by a solicitor costs little and
saves much hassle. I would go further and suggest that we would all do
well to have a ''living will''. This could deal with two issues -- the
use of organs for transplant, and permission for doctors to pull the
plug should we end up in an irreversible coma or brain dead.
The first is less controversial but not always appealing. There used
to be a chap who went around demanding if people carried kidney donor
cards. I met him once at the Kirk's Assembly and gave him a body swerve.
His motives were no doubt of the highest, but his sales technique was
rotten.
Last week I witnessed a much more persuasive argument. A good friend
phoned me on Friday to say the ambulance was on its way for his
long-awaited kidney transplant. On Sunday morning my phone rang. It was
Donald, having his hospital breakfast complete with new kidney. On
Tuesday I shook his hand and saw his smiling face. That smile and that
face would launch a thousand kidneys if it were used on a poster.
Some of you may be reluctant to agree with my second recommendation
for a living will, but I am not talking about active euthanasia. Nor
would this apply to the grey area of senile dementia. However, it would
apply in situations in which there was no possibility that consciousness
or intelligent awareness could return. With a decent interval so that
relatives could come to terms with the inevitable, life would not be
artificially preserved. Personally I would not wish to become a corpse
which was artificially kept alive, and I believe that decision should be
mine, not left to a judge to whom doctors are being increasingly forced
to refer to make such decisions.
At the root of these issues is the modern attitude to death. During
the twentieth century the sea of faith has steadily ebbed in our
country, leaving people whose lack of religious belief makes them
uncertain, fearful of death, and who cling to life regardless of value.
Perhaps it is too great a swing of the pendulum from the nineteenth
century, with its higher neo-natal death rate and lower life expectancy,
in which death was commonplace in every household.
The Victorians developed it almost to an art form with their elaborate
tombstones. Keats romanticised it in his Ode to a Nightingale:
''Darkling I listen; and for many a time I have been half in love with
easeful death . . . now more than ever seems it rich to die.'' Keats was
a dying man and his ode captures the spirit that makes voluntary
euthanasia not a crazy modern delusion but a noble sentiment.
That spirit is still present among many today and is recognisable.
Less so is the triumphalism of the war memorials which celebrate the
dead with such phrases as ''Their name liveth for evermore''. People
seem less prepared to give the war dead their due.
That saddens me. Their poetry was as good as that of Keats and it was
not chauvinistic and uncritical. Their war poets had the best of the
human spirit and they openly talked of death.
We find that difficult today. We are uncomfortable in our religionless
society. Even two minutes is too much to ask. The supermarket tills
cannot cease. The traffic and the mobile phones must be ever on the
move. The computer and the television must remain on. So two minutes is
too much. Too much to ask of those for whom silence is awkward.
Much easier to turn remembrance into a demonstration, a stance. For
some it is a chance to parade militarism. For others it is an
opportunity to negate that with white poppies. Now there are even those
university students who want a ''gay remembrance'' (pink carnations).
Instead of the colour of the flowers we should perhaps think more
about the factor that is at the heart of the act of remembrance -- the
silence. It speaks louder than any words. It is not shaped or filled by
any message or organisation. It is ours to use as we will, especially to
reflect on destiny and death. It is a precious quality -- and it is free
and open to all to share.
As individuals we can create two minutes at any time of the day or
year, but this silence is special. Apart from the Hogmanay bells, it is
one of the few rites in which our whole population is able to share
regardless of creed, race or nationality. It is about war but it is also
about something far greater -- death.
As one who shares ''sure and certain hope'' that death is not the end,
I feel that two minutes is an opportunity to discover our national soul.
If you doubt that such a thing as a soul is possible, the best argument
I can offer is to visit those who are facing death with courage and
faith. Often you will see reflected in their eyes the scenery of that
far country into which we will all travel. When they have gone, the best
we can do is to keep the silence.

AS a charity which works at the very heart of society, at a time when
there is great concern about the status of marriage, I have to say that
we were disappointed in the recent allocation of lottery fund monies to
charities.
I realise, of course, that only three out of every 30 applications
were successful, so we are in good company.
We believe, however, that charities whose applications were
unsuccessful require some feedback about this. Without that many are
doomed to repeat what we are told were inadequate presentations.
Some organisations have no emotional appeal and are consistently
underfunded by public donation. While you will not be surprised that I
include my own organisation in this category, you may be surprised to
learn that the total funds available to us throughout Scotland each year
are less than #400,000.
The lottery people do need to take account of this when reaching
allocation decisions.
Lastly, we agree that the overall central allocation to charity is
insufficient to make any appreciable impact, in the short term, to the
aims and aspirations of many charities.

THE appalling tragedy at Addenbrookes NHS Trust Hospital, where an
unborn child was aborted by mistake, calls into question not only the
clerical procedures in genetic clinics but also the ethics of screening
for handicap.
Some in the medical profession seem to have a seek-and-destroy
mentality as regards the unborn disabled. It is not very often that one
hears the offer of help to bring up a disabled child, it is usually the
offer of termination of pregnancy, which I feel is a sad reflection on
our society.
The results of tests (amniocentesis) for handicaps such as Downs and
Spina Bifida only offer a risk factor in percentage terms as to the
possibility of the unborn being handicapped.
With such information the expectant parents have to make a decision as
to whether or not their child will be able to contribute to society and
be happy in doing so.
One could argue that the disabled have the same right to life as you
or I. If we take this course then it is only natural that society should
do all it can to assist the disabled and the parents of the disabled to
fulfill their full potential in life. The disabled do contribute to
society very positively.

EVERYONE knew Mr Major's position on the French nuclear testing in the
Pacific before the Commonwealth Heads of State meeting was convened. And
equally everyone knew he was bound to be excoriated. Quarrels between
friends are always as disturbing as nasty but on this occasion the Prime
Minister certainly made matters worse by the extreme way in which he
defended his position, unusual even within the European Union,
incidentally. The French, at least, ought to be grateful to him, but it
will not have done Britain's relations with other Commonwealth countries
any good that he displayed so little understanding of their concern. Yet
it is easy to understand, even if much scientific opinion tends to play
down the element of risk involved. Risk is always attendant on nuclear
activity. Those who would dismiss it sweepingly have to ask themselves
why the tests are not taking place in metropolitan France and what would
be the attitude of her neighbours, never mind domestic French opinion,
if they were taking place at home.
The French government almost certainly did not anticipate the extent
of the opposition to the tests, which has been strong not only in the
region directly affected but also in those states on its margin -- the
so-called Pacific Rim -- as well as in other countries in Europe and
even in France itself where worries about nuclear activities generally
have been remarkably muted, possibly because of the success of nuclear
power in providing nearly three-quarters of the country's energy. In
addition, French opinion has been strongly supportive of the Force de
Frappe -- the nuclear capacity and the ability to deliver it. None of
that should, however, affect British calculations and it must seem as if
Mr Major has been motivated by more narrow diplomatic considerations
affecting British and French relations within the EU, where the Prime
Minister's earlier strategy of courting the Germans turned out to be
ineffective. If abandoning the Commonwealth for a better position within
the EU turns out to explain the Prime Minister's reasons, it will hardly
be popular in this country where the French policy is widely rejected as
smacking of imperialism and insensitivity to the feelings of small
countries.
Mr Major has many good qualities but two of his political ploys are
unfortunate and tend to damage him. The first is to postpone problems as
if that will banish or solve them. This tendency produced the Scott and
Nolan committees which certainly deferred facing the difficulties but
whose possible longer-term consequences were not fully considered. Nolan
has certainly damaged Mr Major; and Scott, it is widely believed, will
have the same effect whenever its conclusions are in print. The second
is to meet challenges head on but in an intemperate rather than moderate
manner. This second approach was seen yesterday, and it can only have
done harm. He seems to have forgotten that the Commonwealth is an
association of friends who are willing to forgive each other a lot
because of their past history.
A wiser approach on this occasion would have had the Prime Minister
admitting Britain's unusual stance and suggesting that in future he
would seek to persuade France to do as we do ourselves and make use of
the American nuclear data, derived from tests in Nevada and
computer-simulated material, rather than multiplying experiments in
other people's backyards. Such an approach would hardly have satisfied
Commonwealth opinion but it would not have made matters worse, which is
what Mr Major's actual performance achieved. As with the Nolan and Scott
initiatives, the Prime Minister's Auckland stance amounts to an ''own
goal''. With a General Election looming, Mr Major will have to try
scoring for his own team, if it's not too late.

THE 1990 treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, an agreement signed
by 30 states, should come into operation later next week. Basically a
treaty providing for the reduction of Europe's vast armouries of
conventional military hardware, there seemed little objection to its
implementation; but the Russians have been asking for special treatment
to retain larger than agreed conventional forces in the north and south.
It is a request which worries and angers the Norwegians and the Turks,
co-signatories on the flanks involved in the Russian re-think. It is
easy to see why the Russians want to retain larger conventional forces
in the south. The war for Chechnya entailed a large conventional
build-up (involving many more tanks than previously agreed), as did the
Russian involvement, never openly admitted, in the fighting in Georgia
as well as possible future involvement in the quarrel between Armenia
and Azerbaijan. But it is hard to see why additional forces over and
above those identified five years ago should be required in the north,
though speculation might suggest a connection with the large number of
northern naval bases, with their concentration of nuclear-armed or
fuelled vessels all running into straightforward problems of
maintenance.
Just possibly, the traditional Russian suspicion of others' motives
could be a factor, but on the central front the treaty provision calling
for the destruction of 50,000 pieces of military equipment has been
honoured by the treaty's signatories, including the Russians who have
eliminated 10,000 pieces themselves. Belarus, the former White Russia,
and the Ukraine have been dragging their feet, however, and their
financial experience might help explain the reluctance of their former
partner -- even disarmament does not come cheap. It costs money to
immobilise and degrade military equipment, and the military budgets of
all three parts of the former Soviet Union have been reduced abruptly in
the past five years. In some cases there has not always been sufficient
cash to meet the wages of the troops, or even to pay for the public
utility costs of barracks and naval installations, a weakness which
occasioned much worry about the state of nuclear installations,
especially reactors, among units of the Northern Fleet.
Such mundane considerations, rather than anything of a more strategic
nature, are likely to explain the Russian stance, although plenty of
senior army officers in particular have been hostile to the very large
rundowns in their establishments the treaty enjoined. In fact much of
the material involved is obsolete -- certainly obsolescent -- as was
exposed by the differing performance of sophisticated military
equipment, American and Russian (as supplied to the Iraqi elite units,
like the Republican Guard) during the Gulf War.
In short the Russians have not really changed their minds about the
exercise except on the flanks, where Nato was certainly accommodating in
the case of the south. The old Soviet bureaucracy moved slowly, even in
the armed forces. Things speeded up during war, but that for Chechnya
was hardly an advertisement for flexibility and fast movement in the
army. For these reasons Nato planners will want to give the Russians the
benefit of the doubt, but they ought to keep up the pressure for meeting
the final targets even if the timetable's deadline has to be extended.
That doubt might disappear if the coming Russian presidential election
replaced Mr Yeltsin with a military leader, but there is no evidence yet
to suggest that calculations like that are in Russian minds.

Dame Barbara Cartland reveals all to Phil Penhold in a tangential
conversation of illuminating asides -- ranging from how she discovered
where babies come from to how she helps banish the royal blues.
THE cucumber sandwiches are cut to about the size of a square on your
average chessboard, and the tiny, garish iced fancies aren't that much
bigger. There's a decorated plate on the table especially for the
lapdogs, and Dame Barbara Cartland is methodically crumbling a piece of
cake for the pooch waiting expectantly at her side.
She is dressed -- as usual -- from head to toe in that shade of
shocking pink that she has made peculiarly her own. There is a
much-loved rose with the same tint; it is called Superstar. Which, if
you think about it, is precisely what this 94-year-old is.
Strands of maribou feathers waft around her neck. There is a
five-strand pearl necklace, with a diamond clasp; two huge diamond
cluster rings on her hands; a pair of giant brilliants on each earlobe;
and a brooch the size of a duck's egg surrounded by smaller diamonds.
The effect is rather like sitting down to tea with a pink fluffy
chandelier.
It would be easy to mock the woman who (as I write) has had 625 books
published (''and another hundred that I've written and which are
waiting'') and who has sold more than 650 million copies of her work
worldwide.
Some have. Another journalist once wrote that her facial make-up was a
bit like the damaging effect that two large crows would have, should
they fly head-first into the white cliffs of Dover. Dame Barbara, it
seems, has had her fill of ''very clever young women journalists from
London who come here, accept my hospitality and then go away and think
that they're very clever writing nasty things about me''. There is
something to this. It is an abuse of the lady's time and generosity.
She has spent the morning dictating to one of her secretaries. She
lies on the sofa in the drawing room, dog at her side and the secretary
to her right, seated slightly and deferentially behind the chaise. At
the end of the session she will ask: ''How many words?'' and the reply
will be something like ''Six thousand.'' Dame Barbara will say that that
is enough, and she will break for lunch.
Why does she always set her novels in the past? ''Because there were
virgins in those days,'' she says, perfectly seriously. ''And there
don't seem to be any around today.'' And then she launches tangentially,
into one of her many and frequent side-order trains of thought. ''Today,
it's sex, sex, sex. People talk vulgarly all the time. Horrible. In my
day as a young gel, we didn't even mention the lavatory . . .''
''Girl'' is actually pronounced ''gel'', rhyming with ''cell'' . . .
She has only ever collaborated on a novel once, and that was with the
late Lord Mountbatten. ''Dickie said that we ought to write a historical
romance with a naval theme,'' she says a little wistfully, ''but he was
assassinated by those dreadful people before we had finished three or
four chapters.''
Another tangent: ''If the royal family goes, all we'll have left is a
boring little island with an interesting flag,'' she says firmly. Only a
few days ago she sent the Princess of Wales ''two of my books because I
thought she needed cheering up. There have been so many photographs of
her recently looking so miserable. She sent me a charming little note to
say thank you. When she was 16 she used to read my books all the time .
. .''
Dame Barbara's daughter Raine was married to Diana's father, the Earl
Spencer, which made the dame a ''step-grandmother'', a title she hates.
But she's delighted that the princes are going to Eton, ''a very
sensible school. Not like that dreadful place that Charles went to --
Gordonstoun. Awful. It ruined him for life.
''They threw him into boiling baths, put his head down the lavatory
and flushed it, all sorts of wicked, wicked things. He went to the head
prefect and said: 'Look here, I AM the Prince of Wales', and they said:
'So what?' And did it all over again. Well, I mean, my dear, that's no
way to treat your future King, is it?''
Well, no.
The Cartland industry turns over many millions of pounds a year. With
23 books before each 12-month comes round, it shows no signs of
stopping.
She is mentally as alert as ever, and glides around the room serenely.
However, there is now a slight hesitation to her movements, because she
is very nearly blind in her right eye, and has limited vision only in
the other. The hearing is not what it should be but her skin is
unblemished and her hands are certainly not those of a woman heading
towards her century. They are remarkably hardly wrinkled at all.
''Look my dear,'' she says, rolling her sleeve up, ''not a line
anywhere. Perfectly wonderful thing, called Flame. I took some one day,
came home, looked at my body and everything had gone. Positively
everything. Even my appendix scar.'' She does not offer to show me where
once that was.
''Vitamins you see. Vitamins.'' But surely, I question, taking bucket
loads of A, B, C, whatever supplements each day is a bit like plugging
your television set into a 500 volts supply and expecting it to give a
better picture?
If she's even thought of this radical concept, Dame Barbara chooses to
ignore it, and tells me how she makes sure ''the boys'' have their daily
dose of particular potions.
''I never let people say 'no' to me, I always get my own way,'' she
says firmly. And believe me, you believe her. She has devised a method
of glider-powered mail delivery (for which she was given a top American
aviation award) and was for years a leading light of the St John
Ambulance Brigade.
She championed the rights of gipsies and education for their children,
and she persuaded the obdurate War Office to make wedding gowns
available to forces brides when rationing was at its height in the last
war.
So why did she never go into politics herself? ''I was once offered
three safe Conservative seats,'' she reveals, ''but I turned them all
down. Why?
''Because I had a home and children and a husband, and that is where
one's duty lay. That is the root of so many of the problems of today. It
is impossible for a gel to have a family and a career. She cannot bring
up the children properly if she has to go out to work, and that is why
there are so many poor young people on drugs, d'you see?''
Ah. Yes. But did not Dame Barbara have a career? Writing thousands of
words daily? Again, she chooses to ignore this point and swans blithely
on telling me that when a young man proposed to her (among the 56
suitors she claims to have had) she went to her mother and asked her how
babies were made.
''When she told me I was so shocked; I was amazed and horrified. Of
course, in my day, there weren't so many gels around who had babies
before marriage. And if they did, it was the river. Or nothing.''
She has seven dogs around the house at the moment, and some of them
sleep in her bedroom at night. ''Far better than any burglar alarm or
extra servants,'' she says.
She is on one side astonishingly liberal, telling me that one of her
close personal staff, ''is queer, but he's perfectly all right and I
know he has a boyfriend or whatever he calls him, around''.
And then she comes out with arch Tory lines that set the hairs back on
the nape of the neck. But you then realise that this is a woman whose
life has somehow stuck in a time-warp around 1937, and who has probably
never even seen an inner-city housing estate.
She is going to be buried, ''underneath the tree in my gardens which
Queen Elizabeth I is supposed to have planted''.
Dame Barbara is a firm believer in the afterlife. ''My late husband
didn't. And yet when he died there was the strongest smell of Malmaison
carnations around the bedroom door for months. With no flowers in the
house at all. They were my favourite blooms and he would always buy them
for me. I believe that it was his way of telling me that I was right and
that he had been wrong. I feel lonely at times now, but I have my sons,
who are very kind to me.''
Does she ever lose her temper? After all, she looks so placid and
unruffled. ''Only when I see cruelty to animals or children. That makes
me very cross.'' And the most romantic thing that the ''Queen of
Romance'' has ever done? ''Have my first son -- I nearly leapt out of
the bed with joy.''
When the taxi comes to take me to the station, she tells me that I
must come again: ''You're a very NICE young man.''
* Dame Barbara Cartland is profiled in The South Bank Show on Sunday
on STV at 11.45pm..

THIS week's Usual Suspects (Radio Scotland) took as its subject the
extraordinary life and times of Fanny Wright, a human rights activist
whose ideas were amazingly ahead of her time. She was born in 1795 in
Dundee and after the death of her parents when she was two years old,
she lived a while in London and Devon before returning to Scotland to
live with her great uncle, James Milne, who was professor of Moral
Philosophy at Glasgow University.
He was to shape her unconventional ideas being ''though a cleric also
a sceptic''. In Glasgow University's library this young woman steeped
herself in the works of Thomas Jefferson and reading that all men were
equal she assumed the inclusion of her own sex in this liberating
belief.
America seemed to the place where radical ideas could be lived and not
just debated and written about. As Dorothy MacMillan, who is currently
working on Wright for a book about Scottish women writers, pointed out,
her daring intellectual and geographical journeys were made possible
partly by her temperament and partly by the independence which came from
her wealth. As an orphan heiress she was able to take on America, mix
with any circle she wished, and became an instigator as much as a
thinker. She had the money for freedom as much as she had a fierce sense
of it.
In Britain the only option had seemed to be that of writing books and
hoping. In her new-found land she found the position of women and the
existence of slavery inconsistent with the rhetoric of liberty that had
so inspired her back home. She proceeded to set up a colony for freed
slaves out of her own money. The experiment was doomed and the idea of
educating then recolonising these slaves back to Haiti and elsewhere
does not strike one now as being straightforwardly radical at all.
But that is perhaps too easy a judgment in hindsight.
Andrea Dworkin talked of her own own fears in the sixties of going
down to the racist south, and rightly praised an extremely brave woman
who attempted to take on the pro-slavery landlords by herself. The
Nashoba colony was in a swamp near Memphis, the subject of sexual
scandal and shock. ''Fanny Wright's Free Love Colony'' it was called.
She tended to see all solutions as being political and educational,
and underestimated the economical. She was the first woman to run a
newspaper, the New Harmony Gazette, to lead a political party, The New
York Working Man's Party, and the first woman also to have a play
produced on Broadway. An iconoclastic brave visionary, indeed.
Extreme bravery was obviously required by the Irish immigrants who
sailed to Scotland to become the Tattie Howkers in the potato fields
over here. The emigration to Scotland is the subject of Jimmie
MacGregor's new series on Radio Scotland, MacGregor Across the Water.
These first-hand accounts are tragic and tragic-comic by turn. The
desperate poverty in Ireland made howking the only option as 15 year
olds who had never left their own villages found themselves on boats,
with the stinking cattle below them.
The first taste of Irn Bru and chips then an introduction to their new
accommodation -- a cattle shed with straw-filled bags for their beds.
Although it had been dire back home, at least the workers could stretch
and stand up if they wanted to -- in their grim new land they found
themselves on their knees for eight hours a day.
Of course immigrant workers were hard to unionise and by the time the
sanitary inspectors came round, the howkers had moved on. One man
described how little complaint was made, as if objecting to unutterable
harshness was somehow sissy. We felt it more than we talked about it, he
said, because of pride, that always allows you to be exploited.
Then one woman said if she had her life to live over again, she would
do the same thing. The wry self-mocking resilience was well captured in
an impressive programme.

Even before Scots-Canadian medic Major John McCrae wrote his poem at
Ypres on red petals rising between rows of crosses marking soldiers'
graves, the poppy had connotations with the sleep of the dead. Virgil
looked on poppy fields around his native Naples in 30 BC and saw only a
''harmful harvest'' of the opiate squeezed from the flower's unripe seed
capsules. In later centuries Shakespeare and Keats both referred to the
''drowsy syrups'' of the narcotic. The poppy meant oblivion.
Transforming it into a symbol of remembrance was McCrae's legacy. ''In
Flanders Fields'' was not a great poem, but its reverberating impact was
significant after it was published in Punch magazine on December 8,
1915. The da-dum-de-dum of the opening:
''In Flanders fields the poppies blow/ Between the crosses, row on
row'', lulls the reader into an ambush on conscience in the last lines:
''If ye break faith with us who die/ We shall not sleep, though poppies
grow/ In Flanders fields.''
McCrae died three years later in a field hospital for officers after
contracting pneumonia and meningitis, and was buried with full military
honours in Wimereux Cemetary, north of Boulogne, not far from the fields
of Flanders. He thus joined what would become six million dead, on both
sides, by the end of the First World War. The common wild poppy, with
its scarlet leaves, was now symbolic of spilled blood and of a kind of
defiant regeneration in the wasteland. No drug could induce the escape
of amnesia over this.
The idea of creating an emblem out of the poppy, a tribute of respect
to be worn on the lapel, is credited to an American woman, Moina
Michael. She was active in persuading U.S. ex-servicemen to adopt it,
although she was probably borrowing from a practice that began in France
and Belgium. Certainly, the first artificial poppies sold for Armistic
Day in the United States, and from November 11, 1921, in Britain, were
imported from France. They were hand-made by the women of the devastated
areas of the former European battlegrounds.
As a purely marketing concept the remembrance poppy was a stroke of
genius, well ahead of its time. The 1920s was the decade of flag days,
but a simple flag on a pin would never have maintained the instant
identification, the perfect symbolism in a three-dimensional logo, that
has kept the distinctive poppy in business for more than three-quarters
of a century. It was a stroke of genius.
The Scottish factory opened in 1926. Field Marshal Earl Haig,
commander-in-chief of the British forces in the war after 1915, and
therefore presiding over a death roll that reached one million of his
own troops by 1919, had been instrumental. The Lady Haig factory,
supported by her husband's appeal organisation, opened in the Canongate,
Edinburgh, employing 28 disabled ex-servicemen, bales of red paper and
plenty of scissors. In their first year they produced 488 wreaths, 157
poppy sprays, 6,200 large silk poppies, 379,800 crepe paper poppies,
180,250 lawn poppies, 1.224 million paper poppies and 7,810. Set against
such industry, recording such a loss, Haig's involvement might be seen
today as an expression of guilt. His position is still riddled with
ambiguities and paradoxes.
His first warning to Lloyd George over the need to make future
provision for the post-war employment of ex-servicemen came as early as
1917, and was ignored. It is not the image of the Haig who has been
periodically villified in biographies as the butcher of the Somme and
Paschendale, but not even the most antagonistic critic of Haig has ever
questioned, or fully explained, the loyalty he commanded from his
soldiers, many of whom actually revered and loved him despite the
attrocities they suffered. He in turn appears to have felt much more
genuine concern for their welfare than his strategy of dogged attrition
might have suggested. If there was blind loyalty from the troops, and
blind faith from Haig in his mission, a sense of guilt would neither
have been mis-placed nor incriminating. After the war he accepted
#900,000 and the presentation of Bemersyde House from a grateful nation,
and it might have been easier for him to retire to complacent seclusion.
In the post-war disaffection and widespread disillusionment Haig
risked considerable loss of face when he set to the attempt to unite the
fractured and politically-mobilised ex-servicemen's organisations. The
Royal British Legion (Scotland) still insists that it is senior to the
Royal British Legion. There was a matter of months between the creation
of each, but Haig was the driving force behind both in 1921. It had been
necessary to create one organisation to negotiate welfare issues with
Government, and the Poppy Appeal grew out of this strength of unity. If
that unity never transcended the north-south divide, as the latest rown
over the Royal British Legion launching poppy scratchcards in Scotland
has demonstrated last week, Haig still achieved a necessary cohesion of
objective.
That he never launched a single poppy is a matter of regret. That
first 1926 output of the Lady Haig Factory betrayed the truth of a class
system of poppies, from silk through crepe to humble paper, that cannot
ever have been compatible with the ideal of remembering sacrificed
lives, where it is obscene to imply any value system. As late as the
1950s, Scottish Poppy Appeal fundraiser Major Hamish McConkey recalls,
the choice offered to schoolchildren was between the one penny Flanders
poppy, the sixpenny prettier version and the one shilling biggest. The
democratisation of poppies, a single four-petal design offered for a
donation left to the discretion of the individual, is one of a series of
highly commendable decisions taken in recent decades by the committee of
the Earl haig Fund (Scotland).
Another concerns the leaf, an important matter of Scottish principle.
Anyone studying national newsreaders and English politicians would be
forgiven for imagining there is still a luxury poppy available in the
London metropolis. The difference is instantly recognized, and mildly
resented. Flourishing beyond a botanically dubious double-leaved
specimen is an ostentatious piece of greenery. It might be a leaf, but
anyone studying any of the hundreds of strains of poppy will remain
baffled. If this foppish leaf belongs to anything it should be an apple.
Poppies present themselves unfoliaged in every corner of the earth,
except upon an English lapel.
Major McConkey permits himself a sipe at ''items of costumery'' when
considering this important difference between products of the Richmond
and Edinburgh factories, representing the separate English and Scottish
appeals, but it is on the grounds of husbanding charitable resources
that the committee of the Earl Haig Fund (Scotland) has more than once
voted to dispense with leaves. ''The Scottish Poppy has no leaf,'' the
Fund's literature states firmly. ''The cost would be #24,000, which we
feel is money which could be better spent on benevolence.'' The Scottish
Appeal is the only charity in the world that is proud to announce it
raises over #1 million a year, and gives away a figure in excess.
Investments, bequests, legacies and donations add #300,000 to the
Scottish Appeal, and more than absorb the modest administrative costs of
the operation.
The effort is extraordinary, on a scale that only a military commander
could engage. The factory, since 1966 relocated in Edinburgh on the
banks of the Water of Leith downstream from Canonmills, produces five
million poppies and 7,000 wreaths (featuring the chancel poppy design --
the only permitted deviant), distributed to 10,000 volunteer collectors,
half recruited from the Royal British Legion (Scotland). The annual
issue of collection tins is 60,000. Such statistics might lend the
impression of an an industrial-scale plant and work-force at the
factory, but there are only 35 ex-servicemen employed.
''We have got a plain poppy,'' says Alan Blair, who operates the
veiner machine that shapes and crimps the flower into bloom from rolls
of slightly waxed Shantung Scarlet paper delivered from suppliers in
Paisley. ''It is as it is. A flower should be seen in its natural
state.'' The Princess Royal did not make the best impression on a visit
last year when she wore something only vaguely poppy-like that seemed to
have been created by her couturier. Alan demonstrates his good plain
machine press, with its good plain templates. Only four of them. At the
height of production it will supply 25 boxes, each containing 2000
flower heads. Pins, with the Earl Haig Fund embossed on plastic stamens,
are applied manually. They have a machine that can do everything, but it
ends up spitting pins or bleeding wax. It is in process of being
modified to cope as manfully as the team of workers.
The poppy they produce is a classic. It might wilt a little and show a
tendency to curl at the edges during the course of a week's service on
jacket, jumper or coat. It might seem humble when viewed alongside its
leafier relative in the south, though Scottish MPs are proud to wear it.
It might sometimes face a rival in the white poppy that surfaces from
time to time, the emblem of a minority who argue that the remembrance
poppy somehow condones or glorifies war. There might be periodic
arguments about the most effective length of pin to accompany it, not
too long to cause injury and not too short to jump out. It might be worn
by some who remain vague on its solemn purpose, and regard it as an
annual fashion accessory like hats at Ascot, Easter bonnets or red noses
for Comic Relief.
But squads of advertising campaign executive and design consultants
would exhaust a multi-million budget before they could come up with an
idea even half as effective, even a tenth as durable. Major John McCrae
never lived to see how his three-stanza poem transformed the image of
the poppy, and planted the seed of an idea that would preserve the
memory of the fallen not only at Flanders, but at Palestine, Malaya,
Korea, Aden, Suez, Brunei, Borneo, Cyprus, Falklands, Belize, in the
Gulf War, in Northern Ireland and in all the theatres of the World War
that followed his.

A PROPOSAL by staff and members of the Court of Strathclyde University
to attend a university bicentennial celebration dinner in Lagos,
Nigeria, next April is to be reviewed following the execution of a
former Strathclyde student alongside writer Ken Saro-Wiwa yesterday.
Lord Goold, chairman of the court, last night described the executions
as barbaric and confirmed that the proposed visit -- one of a number to
alumni associations across the world -- would be reviewed.
Lord Goold joined the university's chancellor, Lord Tombs of Brailes,
and its principal and vice-chancellor, Professor John Arbuthnott, in
sending a last-minute letter to General Sani Abacha yesterday appealing
for clemency for Dr Barinem Kiobel, who studied marketing and tourism at
the university, and was one of the nine so-called ''activists''
imprisoned by the Nigerian military authorities.
Last night, Lord Goold reacted to the news that Dr Kiobel had been
hanged with great sadness.
''Obviously we regret it tremendously. It is really barbaric that this
kind of thing is happening in this kind of day and age,'' he said.
He described Dr Kiobel as ''a very fine student of the university''.
Professor Stephen Young, head of the university's department of
marketing, who supervised Dr Kiobel's marketing dissertation for his
master's degree, said the Nigerian had arrived at Strathclyde in 1985/86
in his mid-20s.
''He was a lovely man, really charming. He concentrated on his work,
like so many of our overseas students do, and was very single-minded. He
was not politically motivated, not in the slightest.
''He came to see me when he finished his PhD. He had made very rapid
progress and he came to see me because he was very proud that he had
achieved his goal,'' said Professor Young.
Professor Michael Thomas, of Strathclyde's marketing department, said
that after studying at Strathclyde, Dr Kiobel had returned to his home
area of Port Harcourt to work in the tourism industry where he completed
his PhD at the Scottish Hotel School, part of the university.
Professor Thomas, who has visited Port Harcourt, said: ''This is an
area of the Niger River delta where oil is being taken out, principally
by Shell. People in the area were protesting against the environmental
harm being done by the companies taking the oil out.
''Amnesty International said the protests were a perfectly proper
process. These charges, which were brought to bear by a military
tribunal, were trumped-up charges.''
Professor Thomas added that the son of the elected president of
Nigeria, Chief Abiola, had also studied at Strathclyde. Since Chief
Abiola had been deposed and thrown into jail by the military rulers, the
university had heard nothing of his family.

MANY will be relieved that Kenny Ireland's production of Shakespeare's
tragedy imposes no extraneous interpretation. No Freudian trip into
familial sexuality, no weighted political message, and no exotic
cultural displacement. Which is far from saying it lacks style, insight
or invention, just that the director has worked hard to achieve a
faithful simplicity.
Technically it is a marvel. Robin Don's bare, steep-sloping
floorboards, backed by a bank of blank tenemented windows, topped by a
billowing sheet onto which the ghostly apparition of old Hamlet (Brian
Cox) is projected, is as clean and efficient as it is ingenious. Marked
out by Ace McCarron's appositely ace lighting, the production has a sure
sense of place, space and depth, Ireland precisely counterpointing
stillness against movement so we never lose the focus.
First-night nerves and an audience apparently on day-release from the
Royal Infirmary's bronchial ward probably accounts for repeated speed
infringements in the first 40 minutes, the verse being drummed out at
such velocity that there's no time for interpretation. Even as it
settles down, though, it seems more effort has gone into clarity of
delivery than depth of character.
Tom McGovern's Hamlet is driven by a fiery energy, maddened but not
malicious, reasonable as much as irrational. His ''get thee to a
nunnery'' to Louise Ironside's brittle and intriguingly unregal Ophelia
is more tender suggestion that fearsome instruction.
But Sean Baker's Claudius is a passionless and mechanical adversary, a
sly chancer more than a mercenary manipulator, which lessens the
justification behind McGovern's rage.
The result having hurtled us headlong through a dynamic, often very
funny drama, is a conclusion that seems sad and unnecessary rather than
tragic and inevitable. An admirable achievement all the same.

AS well as the distinctively energetic and fiery attack that they
bring to their performances, Aberdeen's first resident string quartet,
the Yggdrasil, have opened up new frontiers in programming with the
regular inclusion of works by Scandinavian composers past and present.
The contemporary Swedish composer Jan Carlstedt, born in 1926,
introduced the first UK performance of his Second String Quartet at a
pre-concert talk on Thursday. Describing himself in his early years as a
''partisan'' fighting against the disciples of the orthodoxy which ruled
the Swedish musical establishment for many years, Carlstedt stressed the
importance of melody in his music.
His Quartet No 2 sets a series of musical challenges in its highly
contrapuntal opening movement. These remained unresolved through
contrasting movements in which intense introspection alternated with
emotional agitation. Only the finale -- with harmonies soaring upwards
from cello pedal points to the heights on the violins -- brought
resolution.
Beethoven's Quartet in F, op 18 No 1 and Debussy's Quartet proved that
the Yggdrasil players have continued to expand their range since taking
up the Aberdeen residency.
Beethoven's Quartet was handled throughout with a supreme lightness of
touch, though the fiery intensity that has become a trademark of
Yggdrasil performances was still there, especially in the first violin
which dominates the opening movement, while Debussy's provided a
blossoming of tonal colour not heard before from these players. The
second movement was pizzicato pointillism at its finest and the rest of
the work was every bit as evocative of colour and light.

MACK and Mabel is at last in the West End. Jerry Herman and Michael
Stewart's musical is loosely based on this stormy relationship between
silent film director Mack Sennett and his favourite leading lady, the
ill-starred Mabel Normand. The show originally flopped on Broadway 21
years ago but it's been revised and newly staged by Leicester Haymarket
Theatre. It is that show that now reached the Piccadilly.
The first-class music is already well known and this production is
lavish with colourful costumes and settings. Only the book leaves
something to be desired. The show ends with a happy reunion of the
principals -- in reality Mabel died alone of tuberculosis.
A superb cast is led by American Howard McGillin as Mack Sennett. He
possesses vitality, attack, good looks and a splendid voice (I don't
believe Mack Sennett had any of these). McGillin has to overcome the
emotional drawback of his first song I Won't Send Roses in which Sennett
explains that he's an unromantic workaholic with no time to express his
love. Caroline O'Connor's finely and poignantly sung Mabel spends the
rest of the show proving him wrong.
Philip Herbert contributes an endearing portrait of Fatty (Arbuckle),
and, as so often, Kathryn Evans stops the show, leading the company in
two fine dance numbers choreographed by Michael Smuin. Paul Kerryson's
alert direction keeps to the old-fashioned style -- apposite indeed for
the good old-fashioned musical that is Mack and Mabel.

* THREE generations of artists in one family are currently being
celebrated at an exhibition running at Mainhill Gallery, Ancrum, near
Jedburgh.
They are Berwick-on-Tweed-born Frank Wood (1862-1953), the celebrated
marine painter, whose work was purchased and commissioned by such
elevated patrons as King Edward VII and George VI; his son Watson Wood
(1900-1987), who painted landscapes and historical subjects; and some
works by his grandson David Wood, who is still alive and painting in
oils and watercolours, particularly cafe and travel scenes.
The exhibition continues until November 19.

Music
IT has to be said that this performer likes to put on a bit of a show.
Right from the start the coloured lights, the curtain backdrop, and the
dimming of the house lights to near blackout set the scene for Janusz to
take centre stage, and he did just that all evening in this solo
recital.
Whoever the composer, whatever the piece, we were reminded that it was
being played by a pianist of enormous virtuosity who seemed to revel in
that talent even at the expense of communicating the music.
First up to get the treatment was Liszt. Indeed, with Janusz's slim,
slightly stooped frame and wispy white-blond hair he might well have
been an engraving of that composer come to life. All the pyrotechnics of
Liszt's Funerailles were built for maximum effect and then it was on to
Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Scarlatti, Rachmaninov, and Chopin. Emphasising all
the forte passages, each was made to sound incredibly similar, their
individual voices sublimated to the power and eccentricities of this
performer's playing style -- mannered fingering, florid gestures, and an
extraordinary habit of finishing a piece with a limp-wristed wave of the
hand over the keyboard as if wafting away an unpleasant odour.
In an epilogue to his performance the audience's applause was silenced
while Janusz made an emotive appeal on behalf of the world's
underprivileged children before returning to play an encore, followed by
a final act of theatre as he slowly closed the keyboard lid.

William Russell meets the actor recovering from his foray into frocks
PATRICK Swayze, the Hollywood star who made his name dancing dirty and
went on to score a massive hit as a ghost, has taken to wearing dresses
in his latest film, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar in
which he plays a New York drag queen called Vida who spreads happiness
wherever she goes.
The film's unusual title comes from the inscription on a photograph of
the fifties starlet which Vida, a transvestite, not a transexual, steals
from the wall of a show business restaurant.
Swayze, heterosexual and happily married, was not an obvious choice to
play a drag queen, but as an actor he welcomed the challenge. ''Lots of
actors go for a specific genre and stay there, whether as action stars,
sex symbols or leading men,'' he said. ''But too much of a good thing
can be very boring, as we all find out in life, and it has always been
very important for me, each time people think they have me categorised,
to prove them wrong. I am on a very specific quest to see if I can
accomplish things as an actor, and the only way to do that is to take
risks, to go out on a limb.''
His early training as a dancer had helped him play Vida from the point
of view of learning how to negotiate high heels and acquire feminine
mannerisms, but that was all. His upbringing in redneck America -- he
grew up in Texas -- had also helped him understand her situation having
had walked into high school with a violin case in one hand and his
ballet shoes in his back pocket thinking he was going to have an easy
time.
Although he had compensated by being good at gymnastics, swimming and
football, nothing seemed to get past the narrow mindedness of the world
he was brought up in and it was this realisation of what it was like to
be different he brought to Vida.
He had also learned a lesson, he said. Nobody was going to stop him
from going for what he believed in. His task had been to find Vida's
dignity, her elegance. ''I was attempting to play a woman, not just a
boy in a dress,'' he added.
Swayze rejected criticism that the film did not face up to the
sexuality of the characters, arguing that it was a fantasy. People who
wanted to see a film in which men made love to one another could go to a
porn film or a gay movie.
''People have said we did not address gay life or Aids, but the point
was to take the audience on a fantasy ride,'' he said. ''This was not a
movie about gays or straights, but about human dignity and it we had
tried to address sexual issues it would have had a very finite audience.
We had to walk a very fine line to keep a sense of fun, and had we
addressed those issues too much it would have failed and would not have
been number one for three weeks in the United States, the most anally
retentive country in the planet.''
He went to see Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, the Australian movie
released last year which deals with the adventures of three drag queens,
one of whom is a transexual, who also go travelling, but only after he
had the character of Vida fixed.
''I loved Priscilla, but I walked out feeling sad for these people
because of the lifestyle they had chosen,'' he said. ''It gave me a lot
more confidence in the film we were doing. We did not want it to be
something depressing. Because Priscilla was a great slice of life it was
always going to have a very limited audience.''
Being transformed into Vida during the 80 days spent filming proved
arduous. It had felt like he was in make-up for ever, he said. One day
it had taken five hours to get him made up, although mostly it was a
three to three-and-a-half hour job. Her walk had also caused problems.
If he got the hips, he lost the shoulders, and as a dancer having taught
women how to walk in high heels he had discovered how much more
difficult it was than he had thought.
Had he learned anything from being a woman? ''How hard it is,'' he
said resolutely. ''I don't know how women live, having to wake up every
day an emotional victim. It was the most emotionally devastating thing I
have ever done.''
Had he taken anything away from the set? No clothes, it seems. But on
his final day as Vida he had looked in the mirror and thought -- ''This
is the last time you get to be pretty.''

I FEEL I must comment on Bill McFarlan's letter on police tactics
surrounding the photograph of Julia Somerville's daughter.
The police, in my view, were only carrying out their duty by
investigating an incident reported to them.
Mr McFarlan, I feel, seems to think that celebrities are above
committing offences and should be treated differently from the rest of
us.

Tom Weir tells Ann Donald about his late-night reading
* ONE book that I've been enjoying very much is Adam Bede by George
Eliot. She didn't start writing until she was middle-aged, yet what a
body of work she produced! Unlike her most successful work of fiction,
Middlemarch which deals with the upper classes, Adam Bede deals with the
common folk. It gives this wonderful picture of mid-tenth century rural
England. Her writing is just so vivid that you can see the country
perfectly.  Another interesting book is by E M Nicholson called Birds
and Men. He was the founder of the Countryside Commission which got
really going after the war. I heard him speak recently and was in
opposition to something he has said, the result being that we met at
Drymen to discuss it. That meeting made me read the only book that he's
written and it is quite a marvellous book.
I usually keep more than one book on the go at the same time so Dr
James Hunter's On The Other Side of Sorrow is current reading. It's
about nature and people in the Scottish Highlands. Hunter is a great
believer that given the way people currently feel about towns and
cities, it would be possible to bring people back to living in the
Scottish Highlands. And in doing so you would create a new community
spirit.
It's not a long book but does take a big of digesting since he dwells
on literature, history and ecology to express his point, but it's a very
good book with some wonderful poetic quotes in both Gaelic and English.

I AM surprised that in your coverage of the decision by the Scottish
Office to lift the suspension of the Scottish Conveyancing and Executry
Services Board no mention was made of whether this move was in the
interests of the consumer.
The Scottish Consumer Council has long supported the abolition of
solicitors' conveyancing monopoly and is delighted that the board will
resume its activities next year to allow non-solicitors to provide
conveyancing services in Scotland.
The Law Society of Scotland argues that there is enough competition
already in conveyancing among solicitors in private practice. However,
we believe consumers will wish to be able to compare the services
offered by solicitors with that which may be offered by non-solicitor
conveyancers and decide which is the kind of service they require.
The broadening of choice in this area may also encourage solicitors to
look at new ways of providing the service and giving more information to
consumers about the specific benefits that a solicitor conveyancer can
offer.
It must be remembered that the decision to suspend the board in 1992
was a pragmatic one taken by the Scottish Office because no potential
service providers were coming forward.
The Government had not changed its mind on the policy of widening
competition, so we are pleased it can now proceed, and indeed we had
written to Lord James Douglas-Hamilton's predecessor earlier in the year
urging just the step which is now being taken.
It is time for the debate about the provision of conveyancing services
to move on from who provides it to the protections for the consumer of
such services. The Law Society will argue that consumers who employ
solicitors are well protected from the risks of mistakes being made or
from the results of fraud or dishonesty.
The challenge for the Scottish Office and the conveyancing and
executry services board is to ensure that those non-solicitors seeking
to do conveyancing are sufficiently well-qualified to provide a
competent service, and that the consumer protections, such as the
complaints and disciplinary procedures, indemnity cover, and guarantee
funds and so on are sufficient.
The Scottish Consumer Council certainly expects to play a key part in
such a debate.

Fame is the spur for High Road actress Natalie Robb and she recogises
that Cinderella in the Gaiety, Ayr, is but a small step on her route.
She tells Gavin Bell of her ambitions.
THE middle-aged man on the hospital bed is obviously worried. ''Do you
think it will be painful?'' he asks his wife. She tries to ease his
fears, assuring him his operation will be no worse than having a tooth
out. His daughter, who is sitting on the side of his bed, says: ''Aye
dad, lighten up. It'll be all over before you know it.''
There is a brief instant in which the three characters seem frozen,
then somebody in the room says: ''Cut''. Everybody relaxes, and the girl
on the bed starts giggling. ''You look daft in those jammies,'' she
informs her ''father'', who promptly takes a swipe at her. It is one
scene viewers will not see when this episode of High Road is broadcast
early next year.
The lines between fact and fiction, between reality and fantasy,
become blurred in the acting profession. On this occasion, on location
with a Scottish Television crew at Vale of Leven Hospital, it is
difficult to distinguish between nurses and actresses wearing the same
uniforms. It is a world of make-believe in which Natalie Robb, the girl
on the bed, is perfectly at home.
She is happy being herself, but she also enjoys being other people,
which is why she is an actress. She first stepped Through the Looking
Glass as a precocious eight-year-old, mimicking her friends and
teachers, and once she began taking acting lessons she never looked
back.
Her first professional role at the age of 10 was out of this world --
as a ghost haunting Tom Conti in a television drama about Charles Rennie
Mackintosh. Robb was in Wonderland, and she liked what she saw. ''I
loved it. The crew was really nice, and we had a good laugh. I knew then
that's what I wanted to do.''
For the past six years, millions of viewers throughout Britain have
watched her growing up in the role of Trish, a moody young woman with a
mind of her own in High Road. Robb does not believe she has much in
common with her screen character: ''Sometimes the story-lines coincide,
for example both of us have sung in nightclubs. But our characters are
very different. She's a bit of a know-all, while I know I've still got a
lot to learn.''
The learning process involves working with more experienced actors for
four months of the year on High Road, and wherever else her mother, who
is her agent, can find work for her. This winter she will be capturing
the heart of a handsome prince six nights a week in the unlikely setting
of the Clyde coast -- as Cinderella at the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr.
It may not be the big Hollywood film role she dreams of playing one
day, but she will be acting the panto part for all it's worth. ''Mum
always says you have to give your best performance every time, because
you never know who's watching. There's always the chance there's a
talent scout in the audience.''
In the meantime, she is grateful for her prominent role in the
long-running Scottish TV drama which regularly attracts five million
viewers throughout Britain. ''People slag soaps,'' she says. ''I don't
know why they do. It's given me a brilliant profile and opened a lot of
doors for me.'' One of the doors led to the set of Taggart and an even
bigger viewing public -- one episode in which she appeared was watched
by almost 10 million people.
The price of such exposure is loss of privacy. Wherever Robb goes
people recognise her, stare at her, and ask for her autograph. ''It can
be a wee bit annoying sometimes, but I don't really mind,'' she says.
''It's part of the job. It's your public.''
It can also be deeply gratifying, as on the day when an elderly couple
travelled from Fife to watch the cast of High Road on location at Luss.
The woman's remark that Robb was ''just as bonnie in real life'' left
her walking on air for a while.
The downside of the profession is its lack of security. At any given
time there are a great many more actors and actresses than there are
parts, but so far Robb has been lucky. ''It's one of the hardest careers
to get steady work, but I've been in work since I started. It has its
ups and downs like any job, but I can't imagine doing anything else.
Acting is for me.''
She strayed briefly from her thespian Wonderland into the more
ruthless world of pop music last year, by recording a song which was
released and then withdrawn. It was not a pleasant experience. ''The
music business is full of sharks,'' she says. ''It's a nightmare. The
people in it don't care about you, you're just a product to be packaged
and sold. At least in acting you're treated with respect as a person
with feelings.''
With commendable modesty, Robb still considers herself ''a tiny wee
fish in a big sea'', although hopefully a favourable current will take
her to California one day. ''A major film role is the ultimate, one good
one and your career is set. You have to be determined, you've got to aim
for something, it just depends how hungry you are. They don't know me
over there in Hollywood, but maybe one day . . . ''
No matter how hungry she gets, she is unlikely to be persuaded to bare
all to advance her career. A few months ago she declined an invitation
to audition for a film role, when she learned it involved nudity and sex
scenes. ''I think sex in movies is better left to the imagination. Every
adult knows what sex is, I don't think explicit scenes are needed. I
think I can get up the rungs of the ladder without taking my clothes
off.'' In this respect, she is happy to share the views of Clint
Eastwood: ''He doesn't like that kind of thing either.''
People tend not to argue with Eastwood, and they would be ill-advised
to mess with his pint-sized admirer from Bellshill. The erstwhile tomboy
who used to play football in the streets of Lanarkshire is now a very
fit young woman, by courtesy of a boyfriend who is a fitness consultant.
She is also a qualified instructor herself, which she finds a perfect
antidote to the stresses of her acting. Directors with a penchant for
casting couches are hereby warned.
Her other pal is a spider called Bertha -- a large, hairy, Mexican Red
Knee Tarantula to be precise. She (the spider) lives in a glass case
amid assorted rocks and plants on a shelf in Robb's bedroom. A
photograph on the wall commemorates their first meeting, on a publicity
shoot at Glasgow Zoo, when Bertha was pictured sitting on Robb's hand.
Perhaps sprawling would better describe its posture, as it is only
marginally smaller than her owner's fist.
''They make great pets,'' Robb says. ''You don't have to do
anything.'' Except maintain a safe distance, one supposes. Apparently
not. ''She's ready to moult, so she won't let me touch her just now,''
Robb says. One accepts her word that Bertha's bite is no worse than a
bad bee sting, and leaves the creature to moult in peace.
It is almost midday, and time for Robb to take the High Road to Vale
of Leven Hospital, where her fellow characters are filming in a surgical
ward. She goes via the Scottish TV headquarters in Glasgow, where she is
given a light, basic make-up to highlight her features. ''It's to give
her a natural, young look,'' the make-up consultant says. ''For Natalie
that's easy.''
In the staff canteen, producer John Temple says she is a very
professional young lady who has played her part in making the series by
far the most popular programme in central Scotland. Having sharpened the
narrative since moving from Coronation Street, Temple is pleased with
the way things are going. ''We're getting better performances from
everybody. There's a real buzz in the team, morale is high, they believe
in what they're doing.''
At least they are adept at make-believe, judging by their performances
in Ward D on the fourth floor of the hospital at Alexandria. While Robb
plays Trish for the benefit of millions of viewers, a great deal more is
going on behind the camera than in front of it.
About a dozen people are crammed into a small room with the actors,
carrying sound booms, clipboards, sheafs of papers, stopwatches, and
phials of fake blood. As a ''patient'' is wheeled into the ward, two
stage crew are lying on the floor to guide the bed to its designated
place; the floor manager is gesticulating silently to extras to walk
across the shot; somebody else is helping the sound recordist to keep
his balance in an awkward position; and the director, in the eye of the
storm, is watching everything on a monitor.
Unhappily, the ''patient'' does not appear when he should, and the
shot is wasted. Sue Butterworth, the director, is patient and polite.
''A tad late,'' she remarks to the floor manager. He answers ruefully:
''I know, the understatement of the year.'' People laugh, the scene is
repeated, and this time they get it right.
Steve Ross, the production manager, explains that the most important
relationship in the crew is between the director and the cameraman. ''It
all hinges on them because it's they who visualise the shots. If that
partnership breaks down, everything takes longer.'' No such problems are
apparent on the High Road set, where a sequence of scenes are shot with
few retakes. ''The main production unit has been the same for the past
three years,'' Ross says. ''We know each other well. We know how this
show runs, and we chip in and help each other.''
An auxiliary nurse observing the thespian proceedings from an adjacent
ward is not impressed. ''I used to watch it for years, but all the old
characters have gone. I don't know any of the people in it now.''
Somebody comments on how realistic the ''nurses'' on the film set
appear. A nursing sister says: ''See the weary ones, that's the real
nurses.'' The auxiliary adds: ''Aye, the ones without all the heavy
make-up on.''
But still the borders between reality and fantasy are indistinct. The
''patient'' with the bloody nose looks like the real thing, moaning
pitifully in pain, until he makes a dramatic recovery from surgery to
wander off in search of a cup of tea.
In the late afternoon, Butterworth pronounces herself pleased with the
day's shooting. The cameras stop rolling, the spotlights are switched
off, and the cavalcade of make-believe disperses into the night. Robb
discards the persona of Trish and says: ''I'm content. As long as I know
I've got work in, I'm happy. I'd hate to look back on my life and say I
hadn't done anything.''
Having found her vocation in Wonderland, she has no need to look back.

From the grim alleways of Hong Kong to the rolling moorlands of
Ayrshire, artist Yvonne Hawker has found inspiration. But Clare Henry
discovers that a more powerful force has been a bitter personal battle
RED may be this autumn's fashion statement, but painter Yvonne Hawker
was way ahead. ''Last year I was seeing red; there was so much anger
inside me I felt like a volcano.'' The colour red is of course symbolic
of passion, violence, sin, aggression -- and spilt blood.
''I live on top of beautiful, desolate Ayrshire moorlands where the
wind is wild, fresh, and clean, but recently I've been revisiting Hong
Kong. I spent six years there in my teens. It's an exciting, exotic
place. I was officially there to research painting the moonscape that is
their vast new airport and thought of focusing on grey textures, and the
geometrics of tyres and rusty machinery, as is my wont!
''But I also know its cruel, gruesome underbelly too: the way they
slaughter animals, and the raw meat, pig carcasses and joints, carved-up
conger eel and salmon, in the street markets. Artistically that's what I
went back to look at in Christmas 1994: the fish and meat markets with
their stalls heaped with sliced, raw, gutted creatures, and pyramids of
100-year-old black eggs.''
While researching her new subject, she stayed with her friend, the
Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten and his family. ''It was great fun.
Lovely parties. Ian Lang, Edward Heath, Jonathan Dimbleby, and other
interesting folk came to dinner.''
After Christmas she returned to her isolated studio in Ayrshire, all
ready to paint eggs, butchers, and fishmongers. ''I had never felt
better. I was full of energy; raring to go!''
On January 18, on a routine visit, her GP discovered a lump. Five days
later she was in London's top hospital Queen Charlotte's, undergoing
surgery for ovarian cancer. ''It's the sinister one. Many women die of
it.'' Even in hospital and during chemotherapy at Barts, she kept
painting, albeit stamp-size watercolours: ''a prayer square; the
Buddhist equivalent of the rosary. The tortuous process of chemotherapy
is a nightmare. It knocks you for six; makes you sick as a dog but saves
your life. I worked through it all, even just painting for 20 minutes at
a time.''
By June she was strong enough to be allowed home to Kilrenzie where
she let the healing properties of her beloved landscape coupled with a
glorious summer do their stuff. ''I had to be careful. But when I wake
and look at this beautiful valley, it's just good to be alive!''
By July she was back in her studio painting, working towards her major
London solo show at the Redfern Gallery in the West End's Cork Street.
''Originally the show was planned for April 1994. They even sent out
press notices. But it had to be cancelled as I was too ill; and called
off again in July. But I hung on to it. It was very important to have
something to plan and work for. Once I sat at my desk and looked down
the valley, I felt exhilarated. It was easy to work hard. I felt
grateful from the pit of my stomach just to be there.''
Eventually her show, ''Pigs and Fishes'', took place last month. It
was a well-deserved success, both critically and in sales.
''It's so strange to look back. Why was I drawn to eggs? Why was I
focusing on these painful sights? In the Far East they don't bother
about animals or make a fuss of pets. Their attitude is different. They
care more about people. Fish and animals are always alive till the last
minute so they taste better! There's an honesty about slaughterhouses
and cruelty there which we don't admit here. They are not two-faced.
''With hindsight the fishmongers' slabs under their cold lights look
just like operating tables and even the pipes which aerate the fish
tanks are like the catheters, tubes, and drips which my body endured.
How did I know? It shows how wonderfully this thread of body and psyche
are interwoven.
''I took photographs in Hong Kong. They leave baskets of meat scraps
at the roadside. I had to grit my teeth over the camera. I thought 'I
can't paint that!' But once I'd gone through the operations I had an
empathy. I did it gladly.''
Hawker's haunting style, once so cool, calm, elegant, dignified, and
monochromatic with its gentle greys and soft pale blue textures of
Ayrshire's inanimate barn walls, troughs, iron bars, and peeling paint,
now livid and fleshy, has obviously changed dramatically.
So too her home, from Black Clauchrie, a magnificent Victorian
shooting lodge seven miles up a narrow track above Pinwherry and the
Levern Water, where I first visited her in spring 1988, to a cosy
whitewashed stone shepherd's cottage standing high on the old drovers'
trail, inside its delicate stencilled, pale patinated walls awash with
hand-painted garlands and full of books, flowers, herbs, shells,
shrines, candles, and charm. An artist's touch is evident everywhere.
Her studio is different. It's part of the house but has a white
workmanlike air, cluttered with pots and palettes, tubes of oil paint,
bottles of turps, and jars full of pencils. Yet even here the baked-bean
tins which hold her brushes are decorated with oriental calligraphic
blue and gold and a springer spaniel sleeps before a roaring fire.
Here she painted her hanging pigs and sliced fishes, her baskets of
bones, working in the demanding realist tradition, their composition
still formally centralised and ''a hallmark of the way I look at
things'', what the Spectator critic called ''an intensity of seeing . .
. about the overcoming rather than the orchestrating of irrational human
fears''.
The eminent author and critic, Mel Gooding, also an admirer, told me:
''They are powerful, startling images with a great brilliance of
imitative iridescence of scales and eyes. The stark metaphorical aspect
of Hawker's recent oils impressed me. They have a new drama and violence
where the paint takes on a subjective urgency which conveys angry inner
feelings. Good things have come out of her experience of suffering.''
Recently given the all-clear of her cancer, there is just one blot on
the horizon -- a plan to build 204 pylons, each 83ft high, right across
the most beautiful part of Ayrshire from Coylton to Ballantrae. This
175m overhead electricity link with Ulster will devastate farms,
forests, and wildlife sites, including Hawker's own valley.
She gave evidence at the public inquiry and now awaits the Secretary
of State's decision. ''It's like a sword of Damocles hanging over our
heads and is with me daily as I walk these lovely, quiet valleys. I've
managed so far to fight my own illness. I hope I've done enough to fight
this pending blight of our Scottish landscape too.''

Ena MacPherson pines for those heart-stopping roses of old, but finds
that New English blooms have a few saving graces
The spring bulbs are hardly gone before the buds of the clear yellow
single flowers appear all along each stem
THE time has come to give up my search for the perfect rose. I feel
rather sad really -- it has been an enjoyable pastime for more than 20
years now. There is no point in telling me that if six people did the
same extensive research, they would come up with six different answers;
I realise that. My problem is that I can't come up with even one answer.
I have made endless lists of possibilities but there seems to be no rose
that answers my needs.
I discount Hybrid Teas. All the fussing with sprays that the dedicated
HT rose grower happily takes on is not for me. My roses have to fend for
themselves. What I lust after most of all are those heart-stopping old
roses, those great voluptuous bowls of fragrance with romantic names,
like Souvenir de Malmaison, Chapeau de Napoleon or Maiden's Blush.
My present garden, however, is small, so size is the first thing to be
noted. There is nothing sadder than a vigorous rose growing in a cramped
situation, as I know now my gloriously fragrant Albertine is swamping a
six-foot length of trellis and still vainly reaching out for support.
Next, I make notes about colour and perfume. A good strong perfume is
what everyone wants from a rose but I could accept just a slight scent
if in exchange I could have a really satisfying shape.
I cannot imagine anyone being unmoved by a rose like Koenigen von
Danemerck, rose-pink petals cupped and perfectly quartered, with a
button eye in the centre. Or the smaller, neater blooms of Madame Hardy
-- that little green eye in the centre of cups of pure white petals
gives it such an air of innocence. Sadly, this lady has never flowered
profusely for me but I cherish every single bloom.
In a small garden each shrub, ideally, should give pleasure for more
than one season, so repeat-flowering is a boon. Yet pleasure doesn't
come only in the shape of flowers. I would grow Rosa Xanthina Canary
Bird for its pretty fern-like foliage alone. The spring bulbs are hardly
gone before the buds of the clear yellow single flowers appear all along
each stem, and for weeks successive stems throw out streaks of blossom,
like some giant catherine wheel. But for months on end that blue-green
foliage gives such pleasure that I wouldn't be without it.
If you want to try Canary Bird, make sure you get one on its own root
stock, otherwise you may find it failing after a single season.
My final must-have is the ability to die gracefully. I once gardened
in a tiny courtyard with very high walls, one of which was always in
shade. Rosa Alba Maxima, a fully double white of ancient lineage, was
said to grow well in shade in cold northern gardens. And so it did,
magnificently. Soon the wall was covered with roses, but when the first
ones began to die the petals didn't obligingly drop, they hung on
irritatingly just out of reach and my dazzling display was marred by a
steadily increasing splatter of decaying brown blobs. I have never
planted Alba Maxima again.
For my present garden I have turned more and more to David Austin's
New English Roses. If you haven't come across them, do have a look at
his catalogue.
What David Austin has done is to combine the character and growth of
old roses with the advantages of the modern. Here I have found the
perfection of form, the perfume, the colours and the repeat-flowering I
have always looked for.
My first selection was of Heritage, so dainty, such a pretty blush
pink, it seemed ideal, as did a beautifully rich yellow called Graham
Thomas (fittingly named after the man who did so much to preserve all
the old roses). But as in life, the Rose Garden of Eden was not perfect.
Both Heritage and Graham Thomas were listed as bushes growing to four
feet. I wanted them to climb to six. Having got so close to perfection I
couldn't bear to abandon them. They were duly planted and after a couple
of seasons I bent the whippy young stems and tied them as near
horizontal as I could manage. In subsequent years, new shoots broke from
each pulled down stem and the highest blooms now flower well beyond my
reach, around seven feet.
Growing them like this does mean one has to grow something in front to
cover their bare legs, but that is no problem. Choisya Sundance and
Crocosmia do nicely for the yellow and Hosta sieboldiana and Ballotta
show off the pink.
For some time now my neighbour has been nursing a rather retarded
specimen of a Hybrid Perpetual called Ferdinand Pichard. This year,
however, with extra feeding and a summer of great warmth, it covered
itself in pink and carmine striped blooms of the old rose shape and
perfume. At the end of a prolific flowering its petals dropped tidily
and it flowered again in September. Could this, I wonder, be my perfect
rose? No, let's have an end to it. I have finally run out of garden
space.

''HE HAS a ridiculous way of treating women. To understand the reasons
for Juppe's tactlessness, you would need to talk to his wife and
daughter. I'm lucky, I'm neither one nor the other.''
After her sacking last week by Prime Minister Alain Juppe, the Foreign
Minister of Tourism, Francoise de Panafieu, now settling into her lowly
new job looking after the parks and gardens department of Paris City
Council, found these very feminine terms to express her disgust.
She was far from alone -- the government was stripped last week of 10
members, eight of them women. Almost all of them have refused to go
gracefully and have let their feelings be known.
Such sharp feminine comment, like the appointment of so many women six
months ago, in government, was something utterly new in the thoroughly
masculine world of French politics. So was the sort of feminine
solidarity which the sackings produced: several of the former women
ministers were contacted last week by sympathetic communist and
socialist women politicians, who are organising an across-the-board,
all-female dinner next week.
An attempt to stop the Premier's and President Chirac's popularity
from slumping even lower than its current, record-breaking depths, last
week's reshuffle had been expected to be a thoroughgoing affair. The
changes, however, were superficial and all the senior posts remained the
same.
The departure of almost all the women in government, however, made
their very presence in the first place look like a window-dressing
exercise. The government formed after President Chirac's election last
May had been hailed as breaking ground because of its record-breaking
number of women -- even if all of them, excepting the Minister of Health
Elisabeth Hubert and Mme de Panafieu, were in junior posts as
''secretaries of state'', which in the French system are below full
ministerial rank.
Elisabeth Hubert's sacking may have been a straightforward political
affair. A 39-year-old doctor, she had a particularly rough time in
government, caught between her former colleagues, President Chirac's
election promises to preserve a health system which is 30% more
expensive that Britain's, and the urgent need to tackle its #8000m
deficit. That last problem is now a major government priority, and
President Chirac doubtless felt he would be better off with the new
minister, and a man to boot, to tackle it.
The other women, however, have proved superfluous to requirements.
After qualifying her interview with Mr Juppe last Tuesday as ''cold'',
Elisabeth Hubert admitted she had never enjoyed an easy relationship
with him. Hurt that President Chirac, of whom she is a devout follower,
had not troubled to phone her after her dismissal, the former health
minister is unwilling to go back to general practice because of her
conflicts over recent months with fellow doctors. She will have to wait
for a suitable moment to stand in a by-election for the National
Assembly.
More fortunate, the former Secretary of State for External Trade,
Christine Chauvet, goes back to her job running an international company
and former Secretary of State for Research, Elisabeth Defourcq, returns
to her work in statistics.
Colette Condaccioni, formerly in charge of the strangely-named
Ministry for Solidarity between Generations, proved sharp-tongued on her
way out. She compared her meeting with Mr Juppe on Tuesday to a visit to
the dentist, and spoke afterwards of the ''brutality '' and
''incoherence'' of his attitude. Removed from her job as Secretary of
State for Teaching in Schools, Francoise Hostalier, also left the Prime
Minister with a flea in his ear.
''It was a like a slap in the face. I only saw Juppe for three
minutes. He said he was sorry, but my job had been suppressed. I just
found the time to tell him I'd rather me in my shoes than his,'' she
said.
Fortunately for the honour of the French male, the eight sacked women
found a champion in the person of Francois Leotard, president of the
small right-wing Republican Party.
He said he had felt ''genuine sadness'' on account of the ''off-hand
manner'' in which the Prime Minister had treated his women ministers.
But the real motivation of Mr Leotard, grieved that his own party had
been treated shabbily in last Tuesday's reshuffle, may, like that of Mr
Juppe in appointing the women in the first place, simply have been
political.

Elizabeth Buie investigates why badger killings are so prevalent in
Scotland and how a national scheme hopes to reverse persecution trends.
THE BADGER is not an endangered species -- but it is under threat from
man. All sorts of people have it in for badgers (or brocs as they are
called in Gaelic) -- the developers who have to change the route of a
motorway or housing scheme because at the last minute a badger sett is
discovered right in their path; the farmers who believe that badgers are
responsible for the spread of bovine tuberculosis to their cattle; and
the blood sports enthusiasts who like to kill them for fun.
Fortunately for the badger, there is a growing band of people who want
to protect the animal.
Today, for the first time in Scotland, a conference is being held,
organised by the Lanarkshire Badger Group and Scottish Natural Heritage,
to discuss various ways of ensuring the animal's future and increase
knowledge about it.
John Darbyshire, the co-ordinator of the Lanarkshire Badger Group and
a ranger with the Scottish Wildlife Trust, has a number of aims
including the setting up of a central database to record details of
badger setts throughout Scotland. Such a service would be of immense
benefit from both the planning point of view and also for protecting
badgers from persecution.
According to Darbyshire, about 9000 badgers are killed in Britain
every year (out of a UK population of 250,000). Scottish badger experts
accept that the problem of ''digging'' badger setts for badger-baiting
or other forms of killing, is a relatively low-level problem, localised
mainly in the Falkirk, Fife and Dumfries areas.
Sandy Kerr, head of SNH's International and Biodiversity Branch,
believes the problem has traditionally been associated with mining
areas, and that while the badger sporran was for long an accoutrement of
the Highlander, its persecution has become associated with urban growth.
John Ralston, SNH's licensing officer, is keen to encourage the growth
of local badger groups, but warns them not to be enthusiastic in trying
to apprehend the villains.
''Even the undercover SSPCA guys do not like to tangle with these guys
because they are a nasty piece of work. Sometimes they have loose links
to other crimes, whether drug-running or something else,'' he said.
Betting and gambling interests are often involved.
Darbyshire said: ''The people I have come across have been there with
pals -- what you would call yobs. Badger-digging goes up with
unemployment when people have time on their hands. They take a badger
from its sett and take it to a badger-dog fight. Then all walks of life
get involved.''
There appears to be a variety of methods employed for persecuting
badgers:
* Digging an animal out of the ground and then shooting it.
* Letting terriers, or other trained dogs, pursue and kill it.
* Holding a quick baiting session in the woods.
* Taking the badger away to a town and making it fight against dogs.
Once a badger group springs up, its members can act as a form of
neighbourhood watch. Some even build in alarms and steel wire
protections to the badger sett. Then badger-diggers usually move on to
another area.
But badger groups can also, by recording where setts have been found,
help planners and developers.
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 makes it an offence to
intentionally or recklessly damage a badger sett or disturb a badger
within its sett. Licences, through SNH, can be obtained to permit
certain activities. But the legislation has important implications for
developers, particularly when an environmental assessment has failed to
show the existence of a badger sett until the last moment.
Too often, the developer may be cast in the role of the uncaring
destroyer of wildlife, when better information at the outset might have
prevented the problem. People like John Ralston in SNH hope that better
training in recognising badger habitat and habits will help all sides
find solutions that allow developments go ahead without harming the
badger.
Darbyshire gives an example based in the North Lanark area where he
works as a ranger. A small badger sett has been found in a car park
extension which has planning permission. An electric fence has been
built around the sett with cat-flap style doors built into it.
Initially, the flaps are two-way, allowing the badgers in and out of the
sett. Then, when the badgers have learned how to operate the flaps, they
will be changed to one-way to exclude them. When he is certain there are
no animals left in the sett, Darbyshire will close the sett off
completely and carefully take it away.
Such a solution is only possible where, as in this case, the badgers
are known to use other setts in the same area. But it is not an option
when the animals have no alternative accommodation. They cannot simply
move into another group's territory, because so defensive are the
animals by nature that they will kill each other in defence of their
living space.
Sandy Kerr hopes that today's conference will lead to a greater
community involvement.
''If there is a healthy voluntary organisation out there prepared to
assist in these matters, that is greatly to our benefit. We are keen to
encourage badger groups to get their act together and become a source of
reliable information about the activities of badgers.
''A central database, assuming that the persecution side is not a
major problem for us, is going to make it so much easier for planners
and developers to avoid this very difficult situation where there has
been a lot of effort invested,'' he said.
In the meantime, however, badger-lovers will have to find a way of
combating the ''male macho'' thing that Darbyshire believes makes men
hunt animals like the badger.

Julia Langdon talks to some incredulous Tory wives who found
themselves stereotyped on television this week.
THE Tory MP's wife who lamented, somewhat wistfully, that she was sure
that it would be more fun being a Cabinet Minister's mistress was almost
certainly right. You don't get many breaks, or laughs, or luxury
weekends sitting back and painting your fingernails a delicate shade of
shell-pink if you are a political wife. What you are more likely to get
is divorced.
There was a great deal of laughter, however, around the back corridors
at Westminster this week -- the corridors where many wise wives work --
as the BBC2 programme Modern Times -- Tory Wives was discussed. The
hilarity was caused by the untypical lives of the wives who featured and
the universal question: Why did they do it? There was also some
speculation about a follow-up programme called Tory Mistresses which
might be less amusing, but more realistic. ''The only trouble is,'' said
one Tory secretary, ''you couldn't pack all the information into 50
minutes. It would have to be a mini-series.''
A number of wives approached to take part in the programme apparently
withdrew when they recognised the dangers. There was particular
disappointment about one wife, married to a known philanderer, who was
reputed to have given a robust interview detailing how she had managed
to keep her husband on the straight and narrow.
Those who agreed to participate probably did so either because they
were not bothered about being held up for potential ridicule or, more
likely, out of duty. It is duty which informs much of the ideal Tory
MP's marriage, as demonstrated by the ghastly series of fetes, fairs and
fearsome meetings shown in the film.
It is little wonder, though, that political marriages break up at a
rate somewhat greater than the national average. In the first place,
there is the nature of politicians themselves; people who decided to be
MPs are unusual by definition, barmy really, and make exceptional
demands upon themselves; the flip-side of that is the extraordinary
pressure the lifestyle imposes on their partners.
There are some trifling differences between the requirements made of
political spouses according to the different political parties, but they
have much more in common than divides them. All are expected to
subjugate their own work, careers and lives to the greater good of the
party.
One Tory wife with an independent career told me that she had never
been a member of a Conservative Association, had only ever voted Tory
when voting for her husband -- and she only did that when his seat
became marginal -- and were it not for her loyalty to him she would vote
Labour.
While there is a distinctive new generation of Tory MPs with highly
successful, big-earning wives who try to establish a distance between
their lives and their husband's politics it is not easy, and there are
still plenty of ''traditional'' Tory wives prepared to do anything.
And if that means making a fool of yourself on a television
documentary, yours is not to reason why.
''What were they thinking of?'' asked one Tory wife on the phone. The
shots included one wife singing lieder with her husband and children at
a grand piano, another conducting a Salvation Army band and declaiming
on our ''weak and flabby society'' and the ever-immaculate Biddy Cash,
wife of the prominent Euro-sceptic Bill Cash, tossing back her hair and
emerging in a number of lovely frocks to be gracious and efficient.
Another Tory wife told me she had received an early call from a
constituency activist. ''I do hope,'' said the party worker, from the
industrial north, ''that not too many people saw the programme. No sane
person would vote for us after that.'' It is an analysis which raises a
number of important questions: the perceived impact of television on
politics, the imagined gullibility of the viewer and the real nature of
political wives.
The reality is that while the television programme identified a
stereotypical image of a Conservative MP's wife, there are not many who
match that image. The programme was not inaccurate because the portraits
were all provided by the women interviewed, but they were not truly
typical.
One of them herself suggested that the Tory wife was ''a dying
breed''. That says it all, really.

<TEXT>
THE Old Bailey fraud trial was told yesterday by Mr Kevin Maxwell that
he still believed the Maxwell group should never have collapsed.
Throughout the months leading up to his father's death in November
1991, everything he did was coloured by the knowledge that although the
group had debts of perhaps #2bn, its asset worth was far in excess of
that figure at #3bn.
It was true there were tremendous pressures because of liquidity
problems and intense frustration at not being able to sit down and match
inflows from asset realisations with debt outflows, he admitted.
This was because of his father's insistence on spending millions of
pounds attempting to stop the decline in the value of shares of Maxwell
Communications Corporation.
''Looking back over the year, nothing has dimmed that frustration,''
he said. ''This was a group that didn't need to collapse.''
He told the jury on day 101 of the hearing that some of his
co-directors had told lies to the court and others had written
''rubbish'' memos soon after Robert Maxwell's death in an effort to save
their own skins.
He claimed one who had lied was Mr Peter Laister, who became deputy
chairman of MCC in November 1991.
Kevin said it was true that the two of them fell out over the conduct
of the business.
He added that Mr Laister had tried to get him fired in November 1991
and succeeded in doing so the following month.
Kevin, who was concluding his fourth week in the witness box, assured
the court: ''At no time did I mislead Mr Laister.''
While he was chairman of MCC, none of his fellow directors ever
suggested that his actions had made him guilty of wrongful trading in
the civil sense or guilty of fraudulent trading in the criminal sense,
he said.
Mr Maxwell, 36, his brother, Ian, 39, and former Maxwell aide Larry
Trachtenberg, 42, all deny conspiracy to defraud by misuse of pension
fund assets.
The trial continues.

* A FORTNIGHT ago when walking with my little daughter we found
beechmast on the pavement just up the road. The husk had opened and
hardened into a rough pixie-hat and the three-sided seeds lay in shiny
groups where the wind had curled them. It could be a good winter for
bramblings.
Bramblings are the northern chaffinch. Up near the Arctic Circle they
make scrappy little nests into which they are not averse to weaving
crepe paper and cotton, though, like chaffinches, they line them with
feathers.
Around now they will be passing through the northern isles and the
east coast, but only one thing will make them stay: beechmast. If the
crop is light they will wander down to England or across to Europe.
Where the crop is heavy you may see flocks of a thousand or more.
The best place to see them well is on country roads bordered by beech
shelter belts. Find a puddle and watch from your car. The white rumps
are utterly conspicuous, but look closer and admire the orange and black
winter plumage of the males, which crossed with the white wing bars
earns it one fanciful name: tartan back.
Away from beech trees bramblings and chaffinches mix like a single
species in winter, feeding on seedfields, sewage works, and birdtables
-- not necessarily in that order.
Already I am looking forward to finding parties of bramblings on the
coastal teasel patches on a misty autumn morning after they have flown
overnight from Norway.
If it is not a good year for beechmast, there may be only 50,000 in
Britain -- but if the evidence my daughter found at her feet the other
day is reliable, there could be two million bonny bramblings here. I
hope they are in your beechwoods. I hope they are in mine.

DESPITE protests that the premises would be run as brothels, Edinburgh
District Licensing Committee has granted public entertainment licences
to six saunas/massage parlours.
Four letters of objection were received by the committee today,
including one from Mr David Wright, a senior lecturer at the Department
of Ecclesiastical History at Edinburgh University, and one from a woman
in Dunfermline.
All the letters referred to media reports about saunas and massage
parlours in the city being used for prostitution.
The committee considered the letters in a closed session and, after
taking legal advice, decided the objections were invalid.
The applications were for Gentle Touch, in Argyle Place; After Eight,
Spittal Street; the Blair Street Sauna; Dundas Street Sauna; Raeburn
Sauna; and Mermaids in Ferry Road. In every instance, the Environmental
Health Department reported that the premises had been inspected and had
been found to be satisfactory.
Lothian and Borders Police had ''no adverse comment'' to make about
any of the applications.
Appearing for four of the applicants, solicitor John Loudon pointed
out: ''No single neighbour has complained. There has been no single
objector from any department.''
The saunas had all been operating for a number of years -- one for 27
years -- without complaint, he added.
In each case, Mr Loudon was asked by the licensing convener,
Councillor Dickie Alexander: ''In view of press and television reports
that these premises would be used for prostitution, have you any comment
to make?''
Mr Loudon's reply in each case was that the premises were to be used
for the purposes stated on the application.

ROUNDABOUT little body Diva Plaistow was famously keen on dress.
Indeed, in the 1920s, the ancient and enlightened town of Tilling fairly
seethed with sartorial plots and rivalries, altercations and
alterations. Quaint Irene dressed like a boy and Georgie Pillson was
fastidious in matters of fashion and toilette.
At this year's annual get-together of the Tilling Society in Rye,
Sussex, the six Mapp and Lucia novels are celebrated in their setting
and on the home ground of their author, E F Benson. Members are
encouraged to wear period costumes.
Certain hostilities among the ladies of Tilling were not so much cut
and thrust as snip and sew. To Rye, Val Seeley comes as Miss Mapp and
her daughter, Robin, as Diva. They have faithfully recreated the
Poppies-In-The-Corn and Purple-With-Chintz-Roses outfits to which Mapp
and Diva applied so many cut-out flowers, hours of labour, and poisonous
thoughts.
Tilling's nouveau riche Susan Wyse was so affected by the death of her
pet, she wore the late lamented budgie, stuffed, on her ample bosom. On
one occasion the less than secure feathered relic took a beak dive into
its owner's raspberry souffle. Bob Schmidt from Michigan turns up at Rye
Station with the dear departed on his lapel. It is Blue Birdie to the
life, or rather death, the crossed-eyes, those stiff little legs, in the
fallen off the perch position.
Other tributes to Benson and his era include the bookshelf patterned
tie of Clive Chancey from Minneapolis and striped blazers worn by
Charles Hoyle and G D Bateman. Bateman in his old school colours, is key
holder and senior assistant verger of St Mary's Rye, Mapp and Lucia's
church. From St Mary's Monmouth, Father David Smith in dog collar and
black brings the Welsh dimension to Tilling's fictitious padre who spoke
in a mixture of ''Scotch'', Irish, and medieval English.
Wendy Maillou and Wendy Treadwell from Bournemouth researched 1920s
fashion, adapted charity shop clothes, and became Mapp and Lucia. Louisa
Beyer as Isobel Poppit wears a twenties-look dress from Next. Tina Mead,
owner of Frock Follies in Falmouth, has an original beaded flapper
model. Mary Beyer and Jenny Moorby are other improvised Miss Mapps.
Patricia Fallace of Surbiton is in modern clothes of 1920s cut.
One hundred percent of the Norwegian membership arrives complete with
vintage accessories. Britt Ormaasen and Bjorn Vidar Johansen make a
convincing Miss Mapp and Georgie. She is in a terracotta suit with
Liberty/Morris trim. He wears blue oxford bags and Norfolk jacket.
As befits the doyenne of the Tilling Society, Cynthia Reavell wears an
original 1920s eau-de-nil cloche. It belonged to the aunt of a friend in
Bath and was destined for a charity shop. By means of a donation,
Cynthia secured the hat then devised the rest of her Lucia outfit.
Cynthia and Tony Reavell run the Tilling Society from their Martello
Bookshop, 26 High Street, Rye. Stock includes Benson books and Mapp and
Lucia audio tapes. Video tapes of the ITV series, Mapp and Lucia, were
not made. However, Angela Thorne and John Wells are currently touring in
Make Way For Lucia.

Clarice Cliff had designs on pottery which brought cheer and were
cherished. Liz Taylor looks forward to a sale which always attracts mass
appeal
FORGET fine furniture, forget the work of famous painters; the event
that draws the bigget crowds to Christie's salerooms in South
Kensington, London, is, surprisingly, the pottery of Clarice Cliff,
pottery that 60 years ago was sold on the counters of Woolworths stores
up and down the country.
Last November more than 1000 people registered to bid at Christie's
Clarice Cliff sale. A couple of hundred intending bidders is unusual
even at well-attended sales. Christie's is expecting this figure will be
exceeded on Friday when 700 lots of Clarice Cliff pieces come under the
hammer. So great is the appeal of these sales that some people even
collect the catalogues which can be bought from Christie's for #8 a
copy.
What is it exactly that gives the brightly coloured, naively painted
pottery such appeal? It is no longer cheapness because during the past
eight years prices have rocketed and continue to rise. Christie's
expects more than #4000 will be paid for at least two items -- a plate
and a jug -- in their forthcoming sale. Last year it achieved an
all-time Clarice Cliff record when #12,100 was paid for a charger which
was decorated with an abstract view of Mount Etna.
This year that record may well be equalled because Christie's is
offering a rare Clarice Cliff design called Monsoon painted on to a
plate 10 inches in diameter. The conservative estimate for this plate is
around #9000.
The reason for such exceptional prices is that these two designs were
produced in small quantities, not more than 300 of each, whereas the
more ordinary Crocus, Bizarre, and Applique designs were turned out on
thousands of pieces of pottery.
Even in her own lifetime Clarice Cliff was a phenomenon. She was born
in 1899 to a working-class family in Stoke-on-Trent and at 17 went to
work at Wilkinson's Royal Staffordshire Pottery as a painter.
She was an ambitious girl who quickly advanced into the design
department and in 1928 the first of her exclusive designs was launched.
She called it Bizarre Ware and it was introduced to the public in a
blaze of publicity. This was the age of the Depression and her designs
were exactly what people needed to cheer them up for her pottery was
bold, brightly coloured, cheerful, unpretentious and, above all, cheap.
There had nevr been anything like it before.
Women in particular loved Clarice Cliff's designs and her popularity
was so great that some women's magazines commissioned specially designed
ranges as offers for their readers.
The designs were very simple. The most frequently issued one was the
Crocus pattern which was really only three or four downward strokes for
the flower head with a couple of green strokes for the leaves.
In a short time, Clarice had 500 painters working for her and, so
great was the demand, these girls worked six days a week from 6am till
6pm.
She worked equally hard herself and because she knew that she had to
keep her public interested she produced a continual flow of new designs.
Some, like Monsoon and Etna, were painted on to short ranges of pieces
which makes them covetable today, but in all she had a staggering total
of more than 350 different designs. The buying public was never allowed
to become bored.
The major outlet for Clarice Cliff wares were lower price range stores
like Woolworths, but Harrods and Liberty's also sold her designs and, in
the 1930s, her Inspiration design was the one most favoured by Harrods'
customers.
Meanwhile, Cliff fell in love with her married boss, Colley Shorter.
When he was later widowed they were able to make their liaison official.
She died in 1972 but had given up designing long before that. Her fame,
however, was and is secure.
In this week's sale, collectors will be tempted by a selection of
colourful sugar sifters ranging in price from #100 to #1500 according to
the pattern. She did them in more than 150 patterns, and a Crocus sugar
sifter, for example, is expected to sell for between #200 and #300.
There is also a rare Applique plate which is unusual in that the
design covers the whole surface of the piece. It is priced at around
#4000. May Avenue is a fairly rare Clarice Cliff design and only about
10 pieces are known to be in existence. In the sale there is a May
Avenue vase which should fetch around #800.
Wedgwood now own the copyright for Clarice Cliff designs and produce
limited ranges of copies from time to time. These are sold in Harrods
and at the retail outlet attached to the Wedgwood factory at Barlaston.
A copy of a vase painted with trees, a bridge and the roof of a cottage
costs around #250.

Music
IT is eight years since the Human League last played live in Scotland,
their primitive synth sound then bolstered by a Jam and Lewis reworking
as they tried in vain to bring their musical limitations into the late
eighties.
At the time they topped the American charts, but their UK currency was
low: the odd hit single apart, their sound and following were stuck in
1981.
Time has changed nothing. This time around the venue is only slightly
less sparsely populated and their recorded output in the interim has
comprised two uneven and uninspiring studio albums, and two
greatest-hits compilations, both of which do a much better job of
highlighting their worth.
Like the 1987 show, Phil Oakey is the star, a monotoned but none the
less likeable frontman. Behind him three synth players and a
percussionist, to his side Joanne and Susan, the latter still sporting
one of the worst hairstyles in pop, the duo still adding untogether
backing vocals and performing the same dance routine first seen on their
Top of the Pops debut.
Despite the lack of concession in any way to fashion, musical trends
or vocal proficiency, the Human League are still an entertaining night
out. The set concentrates on a mixture of their oldest and most recent
material, and, sure enough, the former triumphs.
Quite plainly, Mirror Man, Love Action, Fascination, and Don't You
Want Me are still great pop songs, while the best of the rest -- Tell Me
Why -- does not compete. Fifteen years after their initial success they
are as outmoded as ever, but the Human League's pop knowhow means that
they are still an entertaining distraction, if no longer the real thing.

IT HAS become a cliche to talk about musicians and singers taking
songs and making them their own but that is what Stan Tracey does. His
observation that ''that used to be You Stepped Out of a Dream'' was not
so wide of the mark, however wryly put, as without ever actually
stepping out of the tune's harmonic framework he brought something
completely new out of each chorus.
Tracey's solo piano performances are something of a rarity these days,
especially in Scotland, and for this one he chose a selection of tried
and trusted favourites, including four from the Thelonious Monk book.
But as with Dream there was always a new angle to be found. In Walked
Bud was brisk, with typically staccato phrasing and sly, humorous
twists.
Tracey can seldom have been accused of playing prettily but there was
a softness on Round Midnight that at times bordered on romanticism.
Nutty, on the other hand, featured a terse stop-go policy punctuated by
casually impudent arpeggios at the top end, and Blue Monk, phrased
almost without emphasis, was a hauntingly lonely encore.
Following one of the genuinely idiosyncratic piano greats must have
been a daunting task for Dave Milligan but this fine young pianist and
his new quartet acquitted themselves well. All four musicians are
composers, as well as strong, characterful soloists, which brings a
variety to the repertoire ranging from saxophonist Phil Bancroft's
quirky Chick's Blues &amp; Greens to bassist Bran Shiels's shimmering Low
Flying, and the leader's fresh, melodic Ode to Felix.

* Jackie Stewart OBE retired from Formula One Motor Racing at the end
of 1973 after winning three World Championships and 27 Grand Prix during
a nine-year career. He now travels extensively on business, is a trustee
of the Scottish International Educational Trust, patron of the Prince's
Scottish Youth Business Trust, and runs the shooting school at
Gleneagles Hotel.
I DO like my food, although I'm not enjoying it as much today as I did
once. It seems to go in cycles. I can always get the same breakfast at
home or travelling: half a grapefruit (or really freshly-squeezed whole
grapefruit) and All-Bran with hot skimmed milk and liquid honey
sprinkled with sesame seed. I tend to stay at the same hotels around the
world and be a creature of habit.
While I'm travelling I wouldn't be eating any bread, but occasionally
at home I'll allow myself to relax a little bit. Helen my wife is a very
good cook and knows what I like. In order to keep a schedule I have to
be careful what I eat as I put weight on very easily. At home I eat
best; lunch there might be risotto or Scotch Broth. Lunch on the road
will be an absolute minimum, like tomato salad or in America a fruit
plate or chicken salad. But I enjoy nouvelle cuisine and good food of
all kinds.
For dinner I like fish, chicken, and the occasional red meat, but
especially pasta, either spaghetti or angel-hair with Napoletana sauce
of basil and tomato. I have to keep my cholesterol under control so I
seldom go for Bolognese.
I have a sweet tooth, that nice and very Scottish curse, but can't
handle desserts because, before you know it, you've had five hundred
calories. Otherwise, I do like Walker's shortbread or their ginger
snaps.
I've never drunk very much but do like the occasional glass of
champagne. If I have one, I can't take wine for dinner as I still drive
a lot for testing and development of new products so find myself being
conscientious in that area. I drink a lot of uncarbonated Highland
Spring Water which you can also get on planes (I do close to 400,000
miles per year by air).
I never cook. If I had to save my life it would be beans on toast. My
all-time favourites are home-cooked: probably mince and tatties with
baked beans, with a drop of Worcester sauce. Or macaroni and cheese.
Most of my life has been spent removing the downside risk, so when you
travel as much as I do you try to minimise that: a huge plate of seafood
that's lain there perhaps for a long time is something that disturbs me
and I avoid accordingly.

LIFE in a northern town, as depicted by the Bradford-based Cars in
Water, is a pretty noisy affair, with Pakistani and Irish families who
live on opposing sides of Enoch Priestly Street vying to see who can
shout the loudest. The respective fathers of the families, Kevin Francis
Kennedy and Mushtaq Nihar, let rip over even the most minor domestic
squabble. They certainly exercise their tonsils when Kevin's son, Ted,
accidentally rams his van into Mushtaq's wall. Their long-suffering
wives, Philomena and Saida, try to act as peace-makers, but Kevin and
Mushtaq are determined to get into a lather.
Meanwhile, a hilarious mini-soap develops as their children peddle
drugs, sell insurance, play in an unsuccessful heavy-metal band, and run
off to Blackpool to stare at the tower.
Writer Mick Martin develops the theme of inter-cultural relationships
which he previously explored in the excellent On A Stone Bridge, which
played at the Ramshorn Theatre and the Arches earlier this year. Like
that work, this production attempts to appeal to a young generation,
with slick, stylised sequences and the use of dance music, which here is
by Detrimental.
Martin has a great command of language, particularly when penning the
comedic sketches, but The Immigrant Song lacks the tight structure of On
A Stone Bridge. The opening act is a very laboured exposition, setting
out the background to the Kennedys' and the Nihars' immigration to the
UK. There are so many choppy scene changes that it's impossisble to get
involved with the characters, and the second act isn't much of an
improvement, with a rambling story line.
The performances are excellent and the spats very entertaining but the
play would benefit from some prudent pruning.

SEASON of mists and mellow fruitfulness . . . If the average gardener
was given the opportunity to change the next four words of Keats'
immortal lines, the most popular choice would probably be: ''And no more
weeds!''
Yet it may come as a surprise to those who have spent a lifetime
gouging out groundsel and decapitating dandelions that weeds, rightly
grouped under the banner of wild flowers, are useful plants in their own
right. Indeed, some of them are cultivated commercially.
There can be none more stubborn than the Equisetum arvense, or
marestail, which produces creeping rhyzomes that push up through
concrete and tarred paths, yet this is a commercially grown crop in
Eastern Europe for use in folk medicine. The stalks are dried and used
as a polish for fine pewter and woodwork. Its constituents also form the
basis of nail-strengthening preparations, and the plant was considered
so valuable during the Middle Ages that it became an article of trade.
In Ireland it is a polish for meerschaum pipes, used underwater during
the buffing process.
Today, the marestail's maximum height is around 80cms. For a real
nightmare scenario, have a look at the giant samples of fossilised
plants in our own Victoria Park fossil house.
Popular names vary from country to country. In America the marestail
is known as bottlebrush or shave brush because of its appearance; one
name they do share with us is Son-before-father, which is descriptive of
the coltsfoot's habit of throwing up the flowers before the leaves in
early spring. The botanical name of Tussilago is rooted in its medical
properties for treating coughs, laryngitis and bronchitis, and you may
see the term anti-tussive on the label of a cough mixture bottle. There
are areas in Scotland where it is known as tushilago and dishilago.
Other names also reflect the healing attributes of the plant, one of
which is groundsel, from an Old English word meaning, rather
revoltingly, pus-swallower. It has, in fact, been in long use as a
poultice for drawing out infections. Caged bird owners will often treat
their charges to a sprig of this plant, and may also offer chickweed
which, as the name implies, was used as a feed for poultry. The crushed
leaves were once rubbed on arthritic joints, and it is used in the
homeopathic treatment of rheumatism.
It's hard not to wince on hearing of a treatment for the relief of
painful joints -- flailing the affected parts with stinging nettles --
but this should come as no surprise when one learns of the versatility
of the plant. Apart from the acclaimed nettle soup and the less
well-known nettle wine and beer, it was used to stop nose bleeds,
promote hair growth, lower blood pressure slightly and also lower
blood-sugar level. It is a commercial source of chlorophyll, is used in
the manufacture of some papers and up until the first quarter of the
twentieth century in the making of cloth. Its use for this purpose can
be traced as far back as the Bronze Age, and the word nettle means to
twist or to make into fibre.
Its inevitable, and very welcome, companion the docken has no less
impressive a list of qualities. In addition to its soothing properties
for nettle stings, it has been widely used as a country remedy for
ringworm, scabies and urticaria, and the powdered root stock makes a
tooth powder which when watered treats gingivitis. The childhood game of
''playing houses'' outside was never complete without the acquisition of
''tea'' from the russet brown seeds, and I am told by my newsagent that
the name for this was carvie.
If coffee's more to your taste, look no further than the ubiquitous
dandelion, also known as Pissenlit, that word which was always
guaranteed to have the first-year French class burst into sniggers. This
name, of course, evolved from the diuretic properties, but the roots can
be chopped, dried and roasted to provide a rather bitter coffee
substitute.
Perhaps we should all reserve a little corner in our gardens for those
much-maligned plants, even if its only to disprove the dictionary
definition: ''Any useless plant of small growth; any plant growing where
it is not wanted by man.''

A High Court judge declared that Mr Howard had been wrong to lengthen
the court sentence handed down to a convicted double murderer.
Overturning that decision, Mr Justice Turner said the Home Secretary
had failed to measure up to the ''required standard of fairness''.
The ruling comes just a week after a court decided Mr Howard's ban on
Moonies cult leader Sun Moon entering Britain was unlawful and follows
probation officers being given permission to challenge the Home
Secretary's reforms.
Last month, Mr Howard was at the centre of an unprecedented row with
the judiciary after the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, publicly
criticised moves announced by the Home Secretary at the Tory party
conference to force courts to impose longer prison terms.
Yesterday's ruling, which centred on the case of John Pierson, who
shot his sleeping mother and father at their farmhouse near Oswestry,
Shropshire, in September 1984, will escalate the row further.
The trial judge, Mr Justice Michael Davies, who described the killings
as horrifying and apparently motiveless, and the then Lord Chief
Justice, Lord Lane, recommended that the ''tariff'' Pierson must serve
for retribution and deterrence should be set at 15 years.
However, Pierson, who protested his innocence at his trial at Chester
Crown Court in July 1985, had his minimum sentence set at 20 years in
1988 by the then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd. He was given this
information in August 1993.
Yesterday, Pierson successfully challenged Mr Howard's decision in May
of last year that the 20-year tariff should stand.
The judge said Mr Howard had erred in law in believing that he had an
absolute discretion to increase a lifer's minimum sentence if he thought
fit.
The Home Office said it would appeal against the ruling, which could
have an important impact on many other cases in which the Home Secretary
has increased minimum sentences for lifers.
Mr Paul Cavadino, chairman of the Penal Affairs Consortium, said the
judgment severely circumscribed the Home Secretary's future ability to
increase the ''tariff'' periods in the course of a life sentence.
He said: ''As long as we retain the flawed system whereby politicians
rather than judges make what are effectively sentencing decisions,
further conflicts with the courts are almost inevitable.
''The system whereby the Home Secretary sets tariffs at the outset of
a sentence with no right of appeal is fundamentally unjust.''

* IN A serious embarrassment for German diplomacy, Bonn today put off
an Islamic conference planned for next week after Parliament passed a
shock vote saying Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati should be
excluded.
Parliament voted to exclude Velayati because Tehran had welcomed the
assassination of Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin.
''The conference only makes sense in a situation which is not burdened
by consternation over Rabin's murder and outrage about the unacceptable
reaction from Tehran,'' said Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel after a
crisis meeting of top coalition officials including Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
The conference was supposed to foster greater understanding between
Muslim and Western countries.
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani had said Rabin's murder
was ''divine revenge'' for the killing of Islamic Jihad leader Fathi
Shqaqi in Malta last month, for which Tehran blamed Israel.

AN imaginative action plan to return to the Clyde an air of vibrancy
stretching from Glasgow's inner city to the Tail o' the Bank and beyond
was unveiled yesterday.
A package of regeneration initiatives costing tens of millions of
pounds was launched by the Clyde Estuary Forum which is supported by
more than 60 statutory and non-statutory bodies with a common interest
in the future of the waterfront.
Together with the public, they have been asked to comment by December
21 on a plan designed to improve the quality of the Clyde which is
expected to attract considerable European funding.
Councillor Sam McCartney, forum chairman, said: ''The area is renowned
internationally as a centre for industry and commerce and as an
environmental and recreational resource.
''However, the estuary has undergone an extensive and long-term
economic decline,'' he added. ''This is a trend we now want to reverse
as the full potential of a 40km-long stretch of the estuary is tapped.''
Mr McCartney said the forum fully appreciated there were many
competing uses for the area both on the waterfront and in the river
itself. Comments were welcomed.
The revitalisation plan covers three areas: the Mid-Clyde extending
from the city centre to Longhaugh; the inner estuary from Longhaugh to
the Tail o' the Bank; and the outer estuary or Firth from the Tail to a
line drawn between the Mull of Kintyre and Corsewall Point, north of
Portpatrick.

<HEADLINE>McGuinness warns talks process is near collapse, after 2000lb of explosives seized. Bomb 'designed to wreck peace'</HEADLINE>

THREE men, allegedly members of a republican paramilitary group, were
arrested in Ireland yesterday after police discovered almost 2000lb of
explosives allegedly destined for a van-bomb attack in Northern Ireland.
British politicians later played down any damage to the peace efforts
and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew stressed the need for
continuous vigilance.
However, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness will warn today that the peace
process is on the threshold of total collapse. At the same time Mr David
Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, will say the peace process
has not even reached first base.
The two men were interviewed for a special edition of BBC Radio 4's
The Week in Westminster. Mr McGuinness says: ''I fear that the entire
peace process is almost on the threshold of a complete collapse'', and
adds it is ''very, very worrying and very, very depressing indeed''.
The Sinn Fein chief negotiator says many within the nationalist
community in Northern Ireland have decided ''we actually don't have a
peace process at this time because of the refusal of other parties to
come to the table''.
Asked if he thought a return to violence was imminent, he replies:
''There is every danger of history repeating itself.''
The interview was recorded after the discovery of 1300lb of
explosives, along with three booster charges, in a van parked in a
lay-by near the border in County Monaghan. Another 400lb were discovered
in a nearby shed, packed in a copper cylinder.
Anti-terrorist police units from the Republic and Northern Ireland
co-operated in the dawn operation. The three men arrested were being
questioned last night under the terms of Irish anti-terrorism
legislation, which requires police to charge them within 48 hours or
release them.
Police suggested the van and its cargo of homemade explosive --
consisting of ammonium nitrate fertiliser and icing sugar -- was to be
used in an attack, possibly in Newry, County Down, aimed at disrupting
the peace process.
One police source said: ''The bomb was capable of causing massive
damage and appears to have been designed as a deliberate bid to wreck
the peace process.''
However the IRA, in a statement issued in Dublin, denied any
involvement in the bomb.
Sir Patrick said the police had intercepted a ''potentially deadly
device''.
While calling on all those involved in negotiations to condemn those
responsible, he rejected claims by Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian
Paisley that the Government was weakening its commitment to Northern
Ireland's security.
However Mr McGuinness in his radio interview warns of governments over
the centuries ''failing to resolve those issues which are at the heart
of the conflict.''
He adds: ''If we have reached a situation or a stage of this peace
process where people are saying quite clearly they don't wish to
negotiate except on their terms, then that I think clearly leaves open
the possibility that there will be a potential for further conflict.''
Mr Trimble, in the same broadcast later today is also cautious about
the progress of the peace talks. Commenting on the decommissioning of
IRA weapons he says: ''Here we are over a year into this process, in
fact nearly two years from the Downing Street Declaration, and still
they haven't reached first base.''
He adds it will be a ''very confident man'' who puts any timescale on
when inter-party negotiations are likely, because it requires Sinn Fein
and the IRA to make a move on weapons first.
Earlier Mr Trimble said he was not surprised by yesterday's events and
said the peace process was ''clearly under threat''. However, he urged
people not to give in under such circumstances.
With US President Bill Clinton due to arrive in Northern Ireland in
three weeks there are signs of renewed efforts to restart the peace
talks, which have stalled over the Government's requirement that the IRA
begin to decommission its arms before direct all-party talks with Sinn
Fein can begin.
Dr Joe Hendron, of the nationalist SDLP, in a BBC radio interview said
yesterday's bomb find was ''ominous in terms of the ceasefire and the
overall peace process.''
The white Hi-ace van was stolen in Dublin earlier this week. Five men
were intercepted by the police in the operation; two were arrested at
the scene, a third after a police search.
One of the men arrested was said by police to be a senior member of
the Irish National Republican Army, a little-known terrorist group. All
three were said by police to be involved in terrorist activities.
The INRA is described as the military wing of Republican Sinn Fein, a
small group that split from Sinn Fein eight years ago following
differences over political strategy. Police say it is made up of former
IRA members.

THE Foreign Office denied yesterday that it had singled out Florida as
an ultra-dangerous American state.
Florida officials are furious that theirs is the only US state
mentioned in a recent FO travel bulletin, which warns Britons on holiday
there not to wear flashy jewellery or walk in run-down areas.
Greg Farmer, US Undersecretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism and
Florida's former commerce secretary, has sent a complaint to the FO.
''To suggest, as the bulletin does, that Florida is the only
destination where a visitor should follow this advice is preposterous,''
Mr Farmer said.
He also said the state had taken measures to improve safety for
tourists after the murder of British tourist Gary Colley in 1993. His
was one of nine tourist deaths in a year.
An FO spokesman said: ''We certainly don't intend to be unfair in any
way to Florida.
''If there are problems in any area, we do out best to offer sensible
advice..''

Geneva
PRINCE Karim Aga Khan lost a legal battle today to stop his ex-wife
from selling her jewels when a Geneva court ruled she could put almost
all the #10m collection up for auction next week.
The court rejected the prince's last-minute appeal to block Monday's
sale, but ordered 23 of the 281 lots, worth around #133,000, to be
withdrawn so that the prince could buy them.
Princess Salimah, who was the British model Sarah Croker-Poole in the
1960s, attended the public hearing at the city's appeal court.
''It is a big relief. We have been authorised by the court,'' she
said, smiling.
The Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the Ismaili community and one of the
world's richest men, expressed his disappointment in a statement.
''The Aga Khan has learned with regret of the decision by the Geneva
Court of Justice not to uphold his key demand,'' it said.
However it added that he would still argue his case at a private
arbitration panel being set up to ''settle the various disputes''
between the couple, who divorced in March after 25 years' marriage and
have three adult children.
In the divorce, the Prince recognised her ownership of the jewels but
he contested her right to sell them as the settlement said she may only
sell ''some items'' in extreme circumstances. It also gave him the right
of first refusal to buy the gems.
The Prince, through his lawyers, had sought to buy the 23 items last
month.
Francois Curiel, head of Christie's jewellery department, told
reporters outside the court: ''I'm thrilled. Buyers will be free to
purchase the jewels and it's the end of a sad story.''--Reuter.

Madrid
TWO Spanish bankers charged with fraud tried to blackmail King Juan
Carlos in an attempt to have the charges against them dropped, it was
claimed today.
Both men threatened to use part of their vast fortunes to force the
King's abdication by exposing alleged scandals surrounding Don Juan
Carlos, according to extracts from a book by two investigative
journalists.
Mario Conde, 47, a leading Spanish businessman until his arrest last
December, is accused of widespread fraud as head of the private bank
Banesto.
He and Javier de la Rosa, 48, the former head of the Kuwait Investment
Organisation in Spain, are claimed by the journalists to have tried to
force the King to intercede on their behalf to have the investigations
into their affairs shelved.
Both bankers today denied the blackmail allegations.
Mr Conde, a keen yachtsman who has often sailed in the same races as
the King, used intermediaries to pass messages to the monarch, including
Adolfo Suarez, the man picked by King Juan Carlos to lead the country to
democracy as Prime Minister after the death of General Franco, claim the
authors of The Plundering of Spain.
In the extract, carried in a Madrid newspaper, journalists Jose Diaz
Herrera and Isabel Duran claim: ''The permanent harrassment of the Crown
followed a perfectly calculated and designed strategy. Mario Conde and
Javier de la Rosa tried nothing less than to get the King to violate the
constitution, the law, and the independence of the judiciary by
influencing the courts of justice and ordering the shelving of the
indictments against them for which they could be condemned to dozens of
years in prison.''
The journalists' allegations came a day after Mr de la Rosa implicated
one of the King's closest advisers in a statement submitted to the
Commercial Court in London, which had asked him to explain what happened
to $500m that disappeared from the company he headed.
The financier claimed that #60m of the missing money was transferred
to two accounts in a Swiss bank controlled by a top diplomat, Manuel
Prado y Colon de Carvajal, who acts as a roving ambassador for the King.
However the King's adviser on foreign affairs denied the allegations.
In a separate allegation, the Madrid daily El Pais claimed that Mr de
la Rosa used false letters embossed with the crest of the royal
household to try to justify the disappearance of KIO funds to the Kuwait
authorities.
The two bankers, now on bail, made their denials amid a political
storm.
The ruling Socialist Party accused the men of ''trying to bring the
country to its knees'' and dragging the Crown into political scandal.
The communist-controlled United Left, the third biggest party in
Spain, called for an investigation into the allegations of attempted
blackmail of the King, while the conservative Popular Party called for
total democratic support for the Crown.
0  The chief state prosecutor, Carlos Granados, ordered an
investigation into the ''very grave'' allegations.
In June Mr Conde's name was linked with documents taken from the HQ of
Spain's military intelligence agency CESID, which showed that the King
was among many leading members of society whose telephone calls had been
tapped.

<HEADLINE>American disapproval of favourite Lubbers forces Europe into humiliating climbdown. Nato divided over next leader</HEADLINE>

A PUBLIC row between the United States and its European allies forced
the Dutch Government today to withdraw the candidacy of former Prime
Minister Ruud Lubbers for the job of Nato secretary-general.
The embarrassing climbdown, and deep public humiliation for the
56-year-old Lubbers, was announced by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van
Mierlo after Washington adamantly declined to join a European bandwagon
in favour of the Dutchman.
''The United States has let it be known that it will not support
Lubbers' candidacy,'' van Mierlo told a news conference in The Hague at
which he announced the decision to pull Lubbers out of the race.
Lubbers later told reporters in Berlin that good relations between the
United States and Europe had always been a primary concern of his.
''I've always worked for Europe and now I feel that my candidacy is
being divisive and that's why I've withdrawn,'' he said.
Asked what went wrong, since he said earlier this week that his trip
to the US had gone well, Lubbers shrugged his shoulders and said: ''Ask
the United States.''
Nato member states immediately sought to limit the damage of the
affair, rooted in US anger at an apparent European lack of consultation
on the issue, by stressing the need for consensus.
''We must not let this degenerate into a crisis,'' said one Nato
diplomat after the Alliance's 16 ambassadors met again today but failed
to make any progress.
He said no other names had yet come forward but said intensive
consultations were under way between capitals.
Lubbers's main rival, former Danish foreign minister Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, has also failed to attract enough support.
''The hunting season is open again,'' said one Nato official.
In Washington, US officials said the administration would work with
its Nato allies to find a consensus candidate.
A senior White House official signalled that the United States did not
want to see a repeat of what happened with Lubbers.
Britain, France, and Germany made clear their support for him and this
was seen in Washington as presenting him to the US as a fait accompli.
Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he would meet Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Defence Minister Volker Ruehe as soon as possible to
consider an alternative to Lubbers.
A Kohl aide said the chancellor wanted wide-ranging consultations
within the Alliance in the next few days.
However, as the Nato face-saving exercise moved into first gear, there
was no hiding the bitterness which saw the Netherlands once again
failing to clinch a top international job.
''This is a bitter blow for our national prestige and a personal
tragedy for Mr Lubbers,'' said Fred van Staden of the influential
Clingendael Institute for International Relations.
Lubbers' previous bid to succeed Jacques Delors at the helm of the EU
Commission was torpedoed by Bonn because of his lukewarm support for
German reunification.
Privately, Nato sources said they were staggered by the US action,
which comes as the Alliance finalises details of a plan to send 60,000
troops to police a peace settlement in Bosnia.
''It is one thing to oppose him, it is another to completely undermine
the candidacy,'' said one source.
In an unprecedented move, the Clinton administration last month
summoned Lubbers and Ellemann-Jensen to Washington for what it said were
''job interviews''.
US officials then leaked that Lubbers was not considered ''up to
speed'' on a number of security issues, notably Bosnia. ''It is an
enormous public humiliation -- fancy saying a former Prime Minister is
not up to the job of running Nato,'' said one Alliance source.
The job fell vacant on October 20 when Belgium's Willy Claes resigned
over allegations of involvement in a murky Belgian corruption scandal.
Ellemann-Jensen, who desperately wants the job, is to fly to France on
Monday in an apparent bid to win France's support.
''I imagine he wishes to explain his position, as he did in
Washington,'' said Nicole Taillefer, First Secretary at the French
embassy in Copenhagen.
Taillefer said the withdrawal of Lubbers had created a new situation
and whether France would endorse Ellemann-Jensen or await a possible
third candidate was not yet clear. ''There is no veto, he is not
excluded,'' she said.--Reuter.

ISRAEL said investigations into the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin had uncovered a conspiracy by Jewish zealots to launch
terror attacks against Palestinians.
''We are talking about two levels of activity. The first was the
murder of the prime minister, and the second was the organising by
extremists to attack Palestinian targets after the implementation of
Israeli redeployment (in the West Bank),'' said Police Minister Moshe
Shahal.
Shahal, speaking on television hours after police announced the arrest
of a sixth suspect in connection with Rabin's assassination last
Saturday, did not identify the targets.
Those in custody include confessed killer Yigal Amir, 25.
Shahal said Amir had tried twice before to kill Rabin, but the prime
minister had not shown up at a scheduled appearance in January and had
been out of range during the opening of a road tunnel near Tel Aviv a
few months ago.
''But there were apparently additional attempts in which he and
others, or others alone tried to assassinate the prime minister,''
Shahal said.
Amir said in court earlier this week that he killed Rabin to stop him
handing over land to the PLO.
As the Jewish Sabbath began in Israel, the Religious Affairs Ministry
planned to distribute thousands of leaflets in synagogues from leading
rabbis calling for an end to the atmosphere of hate.
Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were expected to attend a memorial
rally on Sunday evening in the Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv where
Rabin was gunned down.
The city of Tel Aviv said his widow Leah would speak at the site, to
be renamed Yitzhak Rabin square.
Earlier, a Tel Aviv court ordered Michael Epstein, 23, a friend of
Amir, to be held in custody for five days on suspicion of ''conspiracy
to commit a felony''.
Police said Epstein, like the other suspects, knew of Amir's plans but
did nothing to stop him. Epstein was also accused of organising with
others to attack Arabs.
Holding open the possibility of more arrests, Shahal said a group
which he did not name had been plotting for the last two years since the
signing of the Israel-PLO peace deal for Palestinian self-rule.
Some of its members had been involved in planning attacks on Arabs and
Rabin while others had focused only on assassinating the prime minister,
he said, adding that the group had stockpiled weapons and explosives.
In New York, supporters of Amir have set up a telephone hotline to
raise money for his legal defence.
Organiser Moshe Gross said it was started by Orthodox Jews who
consider Amir a hero. It had raised more than $100,000 in two days, he
claimed.
The Israeli Government, meanwhile, welcomed PLO leader Yasser Arafat's
surprise visit to Rabin's widow, Leah, in Tel Aviv last night. It was
Arafat's first public visit to Israel.
''The meaning of peace is that instead of treating your neighbour as
an enemy, you treat him as just a human being,'' said government
spokesman Uri Dromi.
''When something terrible happens to him, you just go to his family
and pay condolences. This is exactly what Yasser Arafat did.''
Right-wing Likud opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, blamed by Leah
Rabin for helping create a climate of hate that led to her husband's
death, kept very low-key his reaction to the visit of a man his party
brands a terrorist.
''I think a bereavement meeting is understandable,'' he said. ''I
don't think it should be addressed politically.''--Reuter.

<TEXT>
A PLANNING application by Falkirk Football Club for a new stadium has
been referred to the Scottish Secretary and will now be the subject of a
public inquiry.
Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch has told Mr Dennis Canavan, MP
for Falkirk West, that the referral was necessary in view of its
implications for the Green Belt and that a public local inquiry would be
held ''at the earliest possible date''.
Mr Kynoch said: ''The Secretary of State is, of course, aware of the
need to determine the matter as quickly as possible in view of the need
for Falkirk FC to develop an all-seater stadium in line with the
recommendations of the Taylor Report.''
However, Mr Canavan said last night: ''I am very concerned about the
continuing delay and I am frankly astonished that it has taken Mr Kynoch
and his officials more than three months to decide to hold a public
inquiry.
''The application was first delivered to the Scottish Office on August
1, 1995, after being unanimously approved by the development services
committee of Falkirk District Council.
''Before approving the application, the council held a public hearing
when objectors as well as supporters had the opportunity of expressing
their views. Under the circumstances, I fail to understand why a public
inquiry is necessary or desirable.''
Mr Canavan said he understood a public inquiry could create a further
delay of nine months to a year, which would make it virtually impossible
for Falkirk to meet the Taylor Report's deadline.

Paul Young braves the weather to enjoy the finest kind of fly fishing
YET another short, sharp shower of hailstones pushed through the busy
late autumn sky, leaving in its wake a perfect double rainbow framing
Beinn Mhor, Ben Corodale, and Hecla. I found it difficult to keep my
feet in the strong, blustery wind as I fished the shore of Loch Roag on
South Uist during the last week of the season.
South Uist sits high in the game fisher's perception as a place where,
in May and June, the machair trout fishing is without parallel and, as
the year draws on through July, August, and September, there is the
additional luscious prospect of loch fishing for salmon and sea trout.
But perhaps not so many realise you can still get salmon and fresh-run
sea trout up to closing day on October 31.
Remote and beautiful South Uist might be, but that does not make it
inaccessible. I was in a queue of slow-moving traffic on the Kingston
Bridge at 10 o'clock; after the flight to Benbecula, I was casting a
line on the water by one o'clock. Talk about fly-fishing!
As with many angling places this year, South Uist had suffered from
lack of water, but when we ventured there with only a few days of the
season left, the legacy of much recent rain was that even more than
usual, the island looked like different bits of land. The lochs were
brimming and the normally tiny streams were in full spate, sending a
current far into the lochs. John Kennedy, the manager of fishings out
from Lochboisdale Hotel, told us those were the places to concentrate
upon and was confident we would get fish. Though, he said, we would have
to work for them. And work we did.
The first afternoon was a mixture of fierce showers, both rain and
hail, and brilliant moments of sunshine. It was impossible to take a
boat out, so we trekked across the fields to fish the shoreline. If
there had been any cobwebs lingering after the long hot summer, they
were well and truly blown away. When the wind was at its fiercest it was
exhilarating and spectacular. The tops were blown off the waves and a
foot-high roll of spume was driven across the water. When the rail or
hail came, it sounded magnificent, flattening the wave with a swooshing
sizzle.
It was almost impossible to cast, but I found that a lift and a flick
gave a roll cast that, with wind assistance, took the fly out fine. A
small fresh finnock and a pull from something else was the sum total of
my efforts, but I left the water elated. There is no such thing as bad
weather in Scotland, just inadequate clothing, and the chest-high
neoprenes and my Partridge Gore-Tex had kept me warm as toast.
Next day, the wind had ameliorated somewhat, so after rescuing the
boats which had been sunk by the previous day's meteorological fun, we
got afloat. I was with Ian Kennedy, John's son, and we fished all the
nooks and corners of Loch Fada with little success in excellent
conditions. . . apart perhaps from the height of the water. It was
dropping, though, and shortly before lunch, Ian hooked a fish which took
the fly just as he was lifting off the water. . . a difficult one to
hook, but he did exactly the right thing.
The fish jumped immediately, so we knew it was a good one and a
powerful fight ensued. I was now awash with nerves as I handled the net,
but all went well and Ian brought his season to a fine end with a
sparkling six pound cock sea trout.
The following morning the wind was again a little strong for boating
and I hooked a salmon in the first few minutes fishing from the bank. It
was on for a few seconds, came to the surface and splashed a couple of
times before very kindly returning my size eight Goat's Toe. Later,
wading out from the other shore, I took three finnock up to about a
pound and a half (sensibly, everything under that weight is returned on
South Uist) and that was my lot.
Perhaps not a great catch for a couple of days, but I loved every
minute of it.
There is something magical about the island, especially in late
autumn, and if you think there might be little to do at night, buy
Donald Gallacher, one of the legendary Lochboisdale gillies, a ginger
beer in the hotel bar. Then ask him what all that new fencing is doing
down by the lochside and where he thought that wee plane that went over
at lunchtime might have been headed. It is worth the trip just for the
answers!

The last decade has seen many changes for top hairdresser Rita Rusk.
Ann Donald meets her in her Ayrshire mansion and finds a collection of
treasures gathered from around the world
THE number of people who can boast of their home's inclusion in the
lush coffee-table book Mansions and Castles of Ayrshire would be a
rather exclusive circle, one imagines. From this elite group, the number
of hairdressers who can pride themselves on a write-up in said book must
be a rare species indeed, but that's exactly the category top Scottish
hairdresser Rita Rusk falls into.
After leaving school in the sixties, the ambitious Rusk launched
herself into the world of hairdressing, eventually setting up her own
successful partnership with first husband Irvine in their West Nile
Street salon in Glasgow. The last decade -- or ''my second life'' as the
stylish and genial businesswoman puts it -- has witnessed the
establishment of Rita Rusk International Hairdressing School, a new
partnership with her sister, a new husband, worldwide seminars and
exhibitions, and a change of address from deepest Lanarkshire to deepest
Ayrshire.
It is in the latter spot we find ourselves, trundling, albeit very
comfortably, in her sturdy Range Rover, up the half-mile-long muddy
driveway paved in autumn leaves to Chez Rusk. Surrounded by 17 acres of
awe-inspiring pastoral land and views that photographer Colin Baxter
would crawl on hands and knees to capture, is the eighteenth-century
mansion replete with Greek Doric columns framing the front door. This is
home sweet home to the extended Rusk family of stepsons, mother-in-law,
and a steady stream of house guests who inhabit the 14-room abode on a
regular basis.
With the gardener busy trimming and pruning outside and the
housekeeper bustling about in the kitchen, we head into the sitting room
to discover ''The Rusk Collection''. A self-confessed magpie and
lifelong collector who finds it impossible to throw anything out, Rusk's
home, and specifically this vast sitting room, has become an incredible
repository of objets d'art that testify to her inveterate yen for
travel. If they continue to accumulate at their present rate, the
Ayrshire mansion could well find itself on the cultural map as a
satellite branch of the Burrell Collection.
Framed against the dusky-pink painted walls and three large windows
and fettered by blinds or curtains are a fascinating collection of
paintings, sculptures, books, and objects that embrace every style from
art deco to avant-garde and originate it seems, from any country you
care to stick a pin into on Bartholomew's world map. Here is where a
collection of six little models of Barbados river police share the same
space as an original art-deco lamp from New York, a wooden warrior from
Kenya and an original Craig Mulholland chalk drawing.
Qualifying her eclectic taste, Rusk says: ''I've got a very strong
idea of what I like. What I was going for with this room is a mix of
both the modern and antique because I love both but would never have
solely one or the other.''
So, nursing a bad cold and in between sips of coffee and cough
mixture, our ''curator'' talks me through some of her favourite pieces.
Pointing to the open box of antique jade beside her on the velvet mini
chais-longue, Rusk explains how she managed to acquire such beautiful
pieces for a bargain price.
''I was in Taiwan with my agent Sam Chen and he took me to this jade
market which is like the Barras, only it's absolutely massive with
hundreds of stalls,'' she recalls. ''Anyway, some pieces Taiwanese
people don't like to sell to foreigners because they don't want the jade
to leave the country for some kind of spiritual reason and therefore
price it completely out of the usual league.''
As a canny shopper Rusk was told to disappear by her companion Chen
and he bargained on her behalf which finally resulted in the exquisite
carved sea and mythical creatures in delicately coloured hues of blue,
green and orange ending up in a secluded Ayrshire home.
The oriental theme continues with the ornate Chinese vases and bulging
Buddha figurines that adorn the original eighteenth century black marble
mantelpiece together with the rest of the eastern collection that is
housed in the glass art-deco display cabinet.
Here is where a valuable ancient Chinese tea-set replete with
miniature cups and saucers rests alongside another box of jade pieces
and luminous green soap stone models of Chinese dragons. As for the
''anachronistic cabinet'' the ultra style-conscious Rusk initially had
major reservations. ''I always thought that display cabinets were the
sort of thing you used to laugh at your granny for having,'' she
chuckles. ''But I was collecting more and more stuff so I needed
somewhere to put it. So I thought oh, to hell with it, and got this.''
In complete contrast to these graceful Chinese pieces and bounding on
a few centuries in the style stakes is Rusk's favourite avant-garde
piece of art. By London-based sculptor Nigel Reid-Foster, this
intriguing rusty mesh of steel overlaid with chains emerges from a cream
coloured board and stands about six feet tall. ''I love the whole
simplicity of line in his,'' enthuses Rusk, before highlighting the tiny
biblical passages that have been wrapped around each chain. ''I find it
an incredible piece of work,'' and she adds laughing, ''it just looks
like part of the wall.''
It is to the credit of Rusk's clear eye that she has succeeded in
blending in numerous disparate objects displayed in the sitting room
without visitors ever feeling they are in the midst of any pseudo
antiques roadshow raggle-taggle of clashing cultures and centuries.
Given her own line of work it is not surprising when she reveals a
sideline hobby in advising friends on their home interiors. ''I adore
anything arty'', she laughs. ''So I suppose it all comes out in your
home. I still love hairdressing but when I stop enjoying it I'll get out
and do something else.''
''Who knows?'' she adds with a philosophical shrug. ''It could be
interior design.''
Watch and wait for Rita Rusk International could well be adding
another artistic feather to its cap before the decade is out.

Adrian Gardiner comes face-to-face with the realities of post-Cold War
Cuba
Downtown the beach is busy with local youths selling tortoiseshell,
coral jewellery, and their sisters
HAVANA, 1928, and a young musician, Joseto Fernandez, is visiting a
city casino. He meets a guajira (farm worker) from Guantanamo, 600 miles
away at the other end of the island of Cuba. She is one of many snatched
from their homes and exploited as cheap labour in the clubs and brothels
of the capital. This story has a happy ending. Fernandez marries the
girl and devotes himself to exposing this trade. He writes a song which
will later become the best known trova (ballad or protest song) in the
world. Decades later American Pete Seeger retains the tune but sets the
words of a Cuban patriot, Jose Marti, to it: ''Don't leave me in the
dark to die like a traitor, I am a good man and deserve to die facing
the sun.'' The song is Guantanamera.
Havana, 1995. From Jose Marti international airport into the city
centre the road is lined with billboards depicting Marti. It is the
centenary of his death. In the 1890s he campaigned for Cuban
independence from the Spanish but, a better writer than fighter, he was
killed in an early battle. Posterity recognises him as a national hero.
Fidel Castro dragged Cuba into the twentieth century: education and
healthcare became free and widely available. Then in 1992 the Soviet
Union, Cuba's main export market and foreign aid benefactor, collapsed.
The country today is in economic chaos.
Posters of Marti jostle with posters proclaiming ''Socialism Is Dead''
or trite patriotic slogans. Ironically, Cuba is now a two-tier society.
The ''haves'' are the taxi drivers, hotel staff, anyone in contact with
tourist dollars. (And the politicians, but that goes for all countries.)
For example, you give the porter a dollar, probably the smallest unit of
currency you have. He exchanges it on the black market for 50 pesos. The
average monthly Cuban salary is 170 pesos, rising to 300-400 for doctors
and lawyers. After a year in a hotel, the porter or his friend the taxi
driver is well on the way to becoming a peso millionaire. With dollars
you can buy just about anything. For the ''have-nots'' the peso buys
very little and what it does buy is rationed anyway. A pound of pork --
if you can find it -- costs 50 pesos: more than a week's income.
Havana, city of Ernest Hemingway and Graham Greene, has much to offer.
Hemingway frequently propped up the bar of La Bodeguita del Medio (in
old Havana), downing legendary quantities of mojitos. The cellar-like
restaurant, usually packed and always with live music ad lib, has the
best Creole cooking in Havana.
The city has some splendid nightclubs. The world-famous Tropicana is
unmissable but expensive: up to $50 for a seat near the front. You can
stand at the bar at the back for $20. Less expensive is the salsa club
on the ground floor of the Riviera, a skyscraper hotel, where pink and
orange lycra is much in vogue.
The city is a jumble, a blend of Spanish Colonial architecture and
charmless high-rises. Much of the former is sadly dilapidated: there are
fine facades along the seafront, pastel-coloured houses of balconies and
pillars, badly in need of attention as salt water eats away at the
plaster.
We escape the city heat and head east for Vinales, passing fields of
bananas, sugar cane and tobacco. There are few vehicles on the
eight-lane highway: petrol is in short supply. We pass some trucks
crammed with Cubans. Public transport in many rural areas has virtually
disappeared and, though the law limits travellers to 30 per truck, we
routinely count 80 -- 80 pairs of eyes looking enviously at our new,
air-conditioned minibus, made in Japan.
Vinales is an area of verdant alleys, limestone mountains and caves. A
pair of vultures circles a cloudless sky as we sit by the hotel pool
drinking guayabita, a liquer made from guavas. Although it is high
season this hotel, like many others we visited nearby, is almost
deserted. One manager declared an 80% occupancy rate for last year.
An orchestra plays ''Blue Moon'' in the park in Pinar del Rio. The
ancient battered horns and home-made percussion sound great. I study the
faces in the audience. Cuba has embraced four civilisations, not
counting the indigenous Indians whose sole survivor it seems is Hatuey,
immortalised in the name of the best local beer. The French were here
briefly, followed by the Spanish whose imported slaves became the
Afro-Caribbean stock. (The slaves brought Voodoo to the Caribbean.)
Fourthly, the whites are descended from Americans who settled in Cuba in
the first half of this century.
Trinidad, five hours south-east of Havana by road, is a
perfectly-preserved Spanish Colonial town, now a World Heritage site. We
wander round admiring the architecture, taking photos, haggling over the
price of some (probably stolen) cigars.
Varadero, 100 miles east of Havana, is Cuba's premier beach resort.
The 15-mile sandy peninsula, covered with palm trees and ribboned with a
pale blue sea, is the archetypal tropical paradise. Downtown the beach
is busy with local youths selling tortoiseshell, coral jewellery (don't
buy: they are proscribed imports in conservation-conscious Europe), and
their sisters.
So we take a taxi to the quieter, upmarket end of town, to a luxury
hotel called Las Americas, all marble and fountains, and set up our base
camp between beach bar and pool, where we sit and drink a pina colada
toast to King Dollar.
Our little plane lurches and rolls. Passengers cross themselves.
Lightning streaks along the wings, as the tropical thunderstorm follows
us all the way to Santiago de Cuba in the south east. Diego Velazquez
founded Santiago when the sixteenth century was young; later it became
the haunt of pirates, including Henry Morgan; a convenient place for
surprising ships trading on the Europe-West Indies-South America routes.
Emilio Bacardi, mason and mayor, gave the city its museum and art
gallery. Sadly it's a Sunday and his rum factory is closed. So are the
African and Caribbean Houses (museums). We move on to the House of the
Trova, just round the corner from the cathedral, where for a dollar you
can sit all day listening to bands improvising on guitars, double bass,
congas and bongos, maracas and clave.
We drive out to the country to visit El Cobre, the Copper church.
Under this exquisite building, all marble and stained glass, are copper
mines. In the cool interior is a special shrine where grieving relatives
of the 'raft people' leave cards and letters, photographs and other
momentoes of those 'missing presumed dead'.
Major attractions of the Santiago area are the castle of Morro with
its pirate museum, Santa Ifigenia cemetery where Jose Marti is buried,
and the dolphin aquarium near Baconao. At the dinosaur park, also near
Baconao, larger-than-life pterodactyls, mammoths and cavemen frolic
through a convincingly Jurassic landscape.
We drive through the Sierra Maestra mountains, past coffee bushes,
grapefruit and mango trees to Baracoa. The village (80,000 inhabitants
but Cuban houses are so small that 'town' would be an overstatement) is
not yet on the tourist trail, though its first foreign visitor, Columbus
(1492) wrote: ''I have never seen a more beautiful place . . . countless
birds singing very sweetly.''
In the centre of what is now Baracoa, Columbus built a traditional
bohito, constructed of palm trees and thatched with palm leaves. On the
site today stands a church, Nuestra Signora de la Asuncion; inside is a
glass case containing the cross of Columbus, carved from the wood of the
grape tree and bound with silver and brass. Three feet high, it is
rather less than half its original size. Souvenir hunters have chipped
bits off over the centuries.
There is only time for a walk along the shore, leaving the town behind
us in the twilight. The farmers' houses -- bohitos -- blend harmoniously
into a backdrop of tropical vegetation. Black pigs root around in the
undergrowth. Somewhere far away is a world of aeroplanes, of fax
machines, of tower blocks. But for the moment it is 1492, not 1995.
We reach a river estuary where a woman is washing clothes. A guajira,
in fact, as we are in Guantanamo province. Listen to the sounds of night
falling. In the distance, is someone singing her song?

Anvar Khan meets a hairdresser who prides himself on making his
customers feel good
CHARLIE Miller is in his Stafford Street salon, watching a video of
one of his star employees honeymooning with her husband in New York. He
decides to switch it off because it is distracting him. His stylist's
new husband also works in the salon, and Miller has just seen what he
wears under his kilt.
Hairdressing is like football. Players need showmanship and technical
ability. Miller knows the value of a good footballer. When he opened his
first salon 30 years ago, he hired Scotland player John Greig to do the
honours. ''He'd just scored a goal for Scotland to keep us in the World
Cup,'' he offers by way of explanation. Gazza opened his latest venture,
a second Edinburgh salon in South Andrew Street.
''I'm not a bad PR guy,'' says Miller. ''The press all want photos of
Gazza. I spoke to the ad agency who came up with the Kwikfit campaign
and they said he was the man. I cut Gazza's hair last week. It's
autumnal at the moment, very short. He's a good-hearted person. He's
been very well-behaved with the press, I think he's learning. He can do
crazy things but he's a good bloke.''
Miller's salon has two finalists in the British Hairdressing of the
Year Awards, 1995, which Nicky Clarke topped last year. Terri Robertson,
30, has been voted Scottish Hairdresser of the Year and Rowan Clarke,
23, Newcomer of the Year.
''A hairdresser must have the ability to make someone look and feel
good. You've got to have the eye, you've got to be well-trained, and be
able to interpret that look into fashion for all ages. The biggest area
of information is magazines, we spend a fortune on them. We contribute
to the press, all hairdressers influence each other. It's not
plagiarism, it's essential we inform one another.''
Sometimes, hairdressers inform on one another too. Chatting to another
reputable crimper last week, I made an unusual discovery. Two-in-one
shampoo and conditioners are loathed by any respectable hairdresser. But
they are so popular, hairdressers have had to change the way they do
perming and colouring. The two-in-ones build-up silicones in the hair,
and block the penetration of lotions. But why talk to a pro about other
people's hair when you can procure tips for your own?
''People are really educated nowadays,'' says Miller. ''There were
days when they didn't believe in conditioners. We have, in Scotland, the
best hairdressers in the world, there are more expensive but not better.
People have the choice of a really high standard. Go to a professional
hairdresser every six weeks and use the products they recommmend. You
ultimately look after your hair yourself, so take professional advice.''
* Charlie Miller's Go With the Flow range is available exclusively
from Boots, each bottle #2.99. His new salon operates from 8 South
Andrew Street, Edinburgh. Call 0131 556 9898 for appointments. Cuts
start at #23.50.

THE skirl of the pipes marked the latest development in the air fares
price war, as the first commercial flight of a new airline offering #29
one-way seats from Luton to Scotland yesterday touched down in Glasgow.
Glasgow City Council's leader, Mr Pat Lally, and the managing director
of Glasgow Airport Ltd, Mr Donal Dowds, joined the pipers to welcome the
first Easyjet flight.
Mr Stelios Haji-Ioannou, chairman of Easyjet, said: ''Making flying so
affordable allows everybody to fly on impulse for the first time.''
He added the budget airline had sold more than 11,000 seats since its
launch on October 18.
Ryanair started the price war in September when it introduced a #59
return Prestwick-Stansted fare. As expected, Easyjet entered the market
within weeks, forcing two of the main carriers, British Midland and Air
UK, to offer similar deals.
Easyjet offers one-way flights free of restrictions. There will be
three daily services during the week and two at the weekend between
Luton and Glasgow.
Three daily services to Edinburgh will start on November 24. Seats are
also available at #39, #49 and #59. Other European destinations are
planned for next spring.

* DURING London Fashion Week models for designer Michiko Koshino wore
their watches on their ankles. The G-Shock watches by Casio Electronics
are shock resistant and have a 200m water resistance, obviously for
walking through puddles. The thing is, if you wear a watch on the ankle,
how are you supposed to read the time without looking as if you've
stepped in something?
* G-Shock sports watches are priced from around #40 to #130 from
leading department stores.

* MEN don't make passes at girls who wear glasses. So spoke Dorothy
Parker, in standard embittered mode, on the short-sightedness of any
Nigel who thinks a bespectacled dame is ugly. We had a laugh at a press
release sent in from Silhouette, though, on their Autumn/Winter
collection. It's for that ''majority of women'' who need eye correction
and reads: ''Most women of a certain age will be pleased to note that
grunge is out and glamour is back.'' Oh, will they? And who are these
fortysomethings who swapped their colourful M&amp;S smarts for weeping
willow hippy skirts, Dr Marten boots, and chewed, mis-shapen jumpers in
Gothic black anyway? Hello out there, in PR land, is there anyone
connected to planet earth?
* The Silhouette collection is available from leading opticians, with
prices ranging from #190 to #220.

AND so Mrs Winifred Ewing, MEP for the Highlands and Islands, tries to
make her way from Inverness to Brussels. Her attempt to get the first
flight from Inverness is thwarted by fog, so she instructs her taxi
driver to take her to Edinburgh.
They get as far as the A9 Drumochter Pass when his gearbox falls out
into the road. We now have the sight of Mrs Ewing thumbing a lift on the
A9. She is eventually given a lift by a kind gentleman -- a sculptor by
profession, we hear -- who takes her as far as Stirling, whence she
makes her way to Edinburgh by train.
Staff at the SNP headquarters in Scotland's capital were somewhat
surprised to see Madame Ecosse crashing through the door in the middle
of the day demanding that they organise her with a cab to Turnhouse and
onward flight bookings to Brussels.
Trial by quiz
WHILE we are on the subject of the SNP, party leader Alex Salmond says
he thoroughly enjoyed his recent appearance on the TV quiz programme
Have I Got News For You.
Apparently Paul Merton told him he was the only politician who had
ever appeared on the programme and not made a complete fool of himself,
and he even met Angus Deayton's mum, who is from Dundee.
The only bit cut out of the show was when Mr Salmond made a reference
to Mr Deayton applying to join the SNP, a joke of course, but otherwise
he had a thoroughly good time.
''I thought they were all very professional and I would have no
hesitation in going on the programme again,'' Salmond told the diary.
''I even quite liked Ian Hislop.''
No relation
AN extremely important debate took place in the House of Commons on
Monday night. No, not the one on Nolan but the last debate of the day,
which was about the takeover of Homepride by Campbell Soups of America.
The MP who secured the debate fairly laid into the subject in what he
said was a story of ''deception, intrigue, exploitation, and
injustice''.
He alleged that having purchased Homepride's operations in Maryport
under the procedure of a mock auction, Campbell Soups gave the workforce
assurances about their future employment, fooled the vendor as to the
plant's future, and effectively stole the brand name.
Within eight weeks, however, it announced the sacking of the workforce
with a ''spurious'' offer of transfer to other plants, creating
''mayhem, distress, anger, and a deep sense of seething injustice and
resentment among the local community''.
Who was the MP who secured the debate? Dale Campbell-Savours.
Boring Act
FOLLOWING last week's riveting information about the traffic lights
outside the House of Commons, we can now report that the Cabinet Office
is extremely proud of an announcement to amend the 1995 Companies Act.
Apparently it will enable companies to pass resolutions more quickly.
The news release goes on: ''At present, such companies need to give 21
days' notice before a meeting is held to vote on a resolution. The order
will encourage greater use of the written resolution procedure --
introduced to save companies the time and expense of having to hold
meetings by removing the requirement to consult auditors in advance.''
The Minister for Open Government and Deregulation, Mr Roger Freeman,
promises us more of this stuff, stating aggressively: ''We will maintain
the momentum of the deregulation initiative, not only by removing
outdated regulations but by streamlining and simplifying necessary
ones.'' Hold the front page.
'Sleaze' check
SOME advice comes to us from Wirral South Tory MP Barry Porter, one of
the most recent Members to be embroiled in ''sleaze'' allegations.
''Always check your bank statement,'' he said the other day. Before you
get the wrong idea, he discovered he was shelling out for THREE cars he
does not possess.

* I'M NOT sure whether it's the Zeitgeist or just something in the
water, but so-called ''essential organisers'' have won two major gift
awards this year. Boots Executive Set for two-year-olds includes a
wallet, a calculator, a train timetable, a mobile phone, a filofax and
an executive passport in clear plastic version of a briefcase. It was
highly commended in the Petit Filous 1995 Best Toy Awards. The Stuffed
Shirt was voted Gift of the Year 1995. It is an overnight bag which fits
into a briefcase, and is suitable for men whose job includes travelling
away from home. Beauty Box has been sent loads of gift ideas for men,
from personal data banks to alarm clocks, all connected to getting up in
the morning and going to work. Is it any wonder that men die earlier
than women, when a gift for her pampers, and a gift for him chides?
0* Boots Executive Set is #9.99. The Stuffed Shirt is #60 from major

* THE Beauty Box is in receipt of a product endorsed by Will Carling.
It is called King of Shaves, and is an emollient consisting of essential
oils to eliminate painful razor burn.could make many jokes about this
product; connect King, for example, to the close shave he had with a
certain member of royalty. He is also quoted on the packaging as saying:
''Try and convert, I did''. Perhaps he's alluding to turning to God to
get over the trauma of his personal life. But most intriguing is the
slogan ''Lasts and Lasts'' emblazoned across his hairline. His marriage
to Julia has broken down, and so has his friendship with Princess Di.
Why he should be chosen to represent durability, I don't know, unless
the manufacturers are referring to another skill he has yet to put on
the market.

HIGH-speed turbo trains could soon carry passengers on the busy
Glasgow to Edinburgh rail link.
The introduction of such trains on the shuttle between Scotland's two
biggest cities could double existing 30-minute services to every 15
minutes.
A ScotRail spokesman yesterday confirmed the rail company was involved
in top-level talks and was considering the introduction of the three-car
100mph trains through a leasing deal with Angel Trains.
However, he stressed no decision had yet been taken and the financial
implications of any deal would have to be assessed carefully.
Talks are thought to centre around an arrangement to lease 11
newly-built turbos within the next two or three years.
Such a deal would have a knock-on effect on the rolling stock used on
services around Scotland.
The 15 two-car Class 158s currently in service between Glasgow and
Edinburgh would be freed to run on services between Glasgow and
Stranraer and Newcastle, and from Edinburgh to Dunblane.
Stock freed by such a move could then be used to replace 18 diesel
multiple units, built in the 1950s and 1960s.

A SCOTS yachting family have survived the storm which is feared to
have claimed the lives of a young West Highland boat couple.
Coastguards have now given up hope for 34-year-old Mull pair Sarah
Heald and her boyfriend Dave Ostlere, who set out in their 28-foot yacht
for Madeira at the beginning of September. They are thought to have
perished in a storm about a week later in the Bay of Biscay.
Also caught in the same 100mph winds and giant waves, but in a bigger
boat, were Mr John Beetham, 43, wife Diane, 41, and sons James, 18, and
Andrew, 16, of Findochty in Banffshire.
They set out from Oban at the same time and for the same destination
as the pair from Fionnphort on Mull.
Mr Beetham's sister Mrs Lyn Baxter, from Buckie, yesterday said:
''Diane was on the phone to me last night from Gran Canaria and said it
was a horrendous experience. They had no control over their boat. They
just had to run before the storm and hope for the best.''
Mr Beetham was thrown across the deck as he tried to lower the boom
and cut his hand badly. He later collapsed below deck.
Said Diane: ''We were all terrified. The wind was so strong it was
flattening the tops of the waves.
''The cockpit was full of water as wave after wave came rolling
aboard. The waves sounded like express trains coming up from behind.''
As the storm eventually abated, the yacht limped into a port in
north-west Spain. Locals told them two boats had sunk and others were
damaged. The family then carried on to Gran Canaria.

<HEADLINE>Crofters move to set up land trust</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish Crofters Union yesterday took the first step towards
transforming the established pattern of Highland landownership shaped by
the 19th century clearances.
It voted to set up its own Land Trust to take over control of public
and private land in the Highlands until local communities feel confident
enough to carry on.
The move has been prompted by the recent offer by the Scottish
Secretary, Mr Michael Forsyth, to transfer the 1400 Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department owned crofts to community trusts.
A similar offer was made in 1989, by the then Highlands and Islands
minister Lord Sanderson of Bowden, which was to be piloted in Skye and
Raasay, but the islanders were reluctant.
After the private meeting at the SCU's agm in Newtonmore, SCU
President Alistair MacIver said the resolution to form the trust was not
just empty rhetoric.
''We were mindful of the situation in Skye and Raasay, where crofters
were unable or unwilling to take up the offer. We felt there was a
missed opportunity there, hence the idea of a wider land trust which
would take up that kind of opportunity, whether it came from a private
landlord, or as fortuitously was the case with the recent offer from
Michael Forsyth.''
According to Mr MacIver, talks will begin as soon as possible over
funding, as the Secretary of State wanted the issue of the estates
settled before the next election in less than 18 months.
''Undoubtedly we will need resources to set it up. There are other
agencies and public bodies who would be prepared to put some money into
getting such an organisation off the ground.''
SCU director Dr Fraser MacLeod said that they would also, in the long
run, be looking at estates which had no crofting land.
''It will cost money, but there are many sources of finance that can
be tapped. There is the Millennium Fund, ethical investment funds for
investors who want to ensure their investments do not damage the
environment. There are many sources we have yet to investigate. The most
important thing is to set up the trust, the money will follow.''

In America, a police officer is killed every 57 hours. Stephen McGinty
visits the marbled halls in which their names are kept alive
AMERICAN cops are just so cool. As a child I wanted to be one. As an
eight-year-old I could think of nothing better than walking a beat,
twirling a night-stick. I would be primed, ready to swivel and draw my
.38 service revolver the first time trouble raised its
soon-to-be-punctured head. My best friend and I played endless games
armed with toy guns. The upper-floor of his house became an urban
sprawl; the chest of drawers, a squad car, Penguin biscuits and Coke
were our coffee and donuts. Our imaginations conjured armed hoods from
hung dressing-gowns.
Entire episodes of Starsky and Hutch, Hill Street Blues, and Kojak
were re-enacted complete with American drawls. The obligatory rooftop
chase sequence ended with the focus of our most emotive scenes -- the
death of a partner. Leaping from the top-floor landing into the bathroom
10 steps below would result -- as our parents predicted -- in one of our
''deaths''.
While Dave swore a teary oath of revenge I lay deadly still. Later,
when he recited Dirty Harry's famous speech to a bureau in his parents'
empty bedroom, the sound was muffled by the bathmat. It was the loud
blam-blam-blam which was my vindication.
Memories such as these returned as I traced a finger along the
chiselled impressions made by the names of dead officers on the Memorial
-- a 400-tonne wall of Italian marble which sits at the centre of The
American Police Hall Of Fame And Police Museum. It's a bit of mouthful
-- beat cops have been known to choke on donuts rhyming it off.
You arrive at the old FBI building in downtown Miami along a causeway
where flags flutter in welcome to the International Association of
Chiefs of Police. Two weeks earlier top cops from around the world had
visited the Hall Of Fame and read of the recent exploits of Lieutenant
Lee Kellogg. A picture of Lee, moustache bristling with pride, is framed
in wood as 1995's recipient of the boys in blue's highest honour.
The lieutenant from Florida's Broward County Sheriff's Office saw an
Amtrak train crash into a gasoline tank which had become trapped on the
rail-crossing. He described the scene as if the ''gates of hell had
opened''. On angel's wings he saved dozens of lives, organised emergency
services, and fought through the flames to trapped passengers. His car
was consumed in flames. His burns were so bad he was off-duty for six
months. He was, in the view of the wooden plaque, ''A shining example of
a hero in blue''.
HE was lucky not to be a new name on the wall of stone. In America a
police officer is killed every 57 hours. To mark his or her fall the
Stars and Stripes which blows outside the museum in Miami's balmy winds
is lowered to half-mast. It takes a little longer, just more than a
week, for names to be chiselled upon the marble memorial walls. More
than 6000 names are marked behind the line, ''Good Men Must Die. But
Death Cannot Kill Their Names'', which stands bold above the entrance.
The officers' name, rank, city, and state are engraved in a lasting
tribute. As the museum makes no profit, birthday and Christmas presents
are sent to each surviving child. Older children receive scholarship and
educational grants. The other work of the APHF is suicide prevention --
300 American police officers killed themselves in 1994.
One of the most moving pictures in the programme produced for Police
Memorial Day Special is of Monsignor Ronald Hope trying to talk a
distressed Deputy Paul Broussard out of shooting himself. The priest's
arm is around the deputy whose head hangs over the pistol he holds to
his face. It was unsuccessful. He fired.
To walk through the marble arch, past the bronze statue of an officer
and a little boy and girl, decked in flowers is to be moved more than by
any movie.
Memories of childhood games, of cops and robbers, goodies and baddies
return to mind. It is a quiet place, and bullets ring all the more
clearly by their absence.
It was one which struck down young Jeff Hermon on June 2, 1989.
Flowers from his anniversary still lie at the foot of the memorial with
photographs of him, off-duty in a red baseball jacket, holding his young
son.
Further on at the base below the name of Deputy Joseph Coute, killed
on July 11, 1979, lies a plaque containing a photograph of officer Coute
above his killers' mug-shots. A constant reminder to a nation of just
what Gary Eaton, Dawn Sobel, and John Gombos did.
A little chapel marked as interdenominational sits next to the
Memorial, a quiet place for families to reflect. It sits empty, as
visitors peer through the windows into the present and future of police
vehicles. In the foyer sits a contemporary police car and the vehicle
used in the movie Bladerunner.
The signs say ''Don't Touch'' and you wonder what would happen if you
did. So I do, expecting to be beaten to the floor by burly security
guards. But nothing happens. I begin to ponder a possible metaphor for
contemporary society along the lines that so many crimes go unpunished,
even in this, a temple to the law. Then I notice a CHiPS bike and
instead think ''Cool!''.
There is no plaque to Eric Estravez on the next floor -- well, he was
a wife-beater, wasn't he? And so for that matter was Hutch, a la David
Soul. Paul Michael Glazier was almost perfect but still no collection of
Starsky's rain-sodden cardigans or Kojak's lollipops. Instead, the first
thing that greets you is a glass cabinet of badges. Obviously, this is
for Police trainspotters. I go in search of the guns.
The most famous one I discover is not an original but a copy. The
bullet, however, is original. In the JFK trophy case sits the limited
edition of an original bullet shot from ''The most famous gun in the
world. The Jack Ruby Colt Cobra .38 special''. The lie-detector scrawls
off the page. What about the rifle(s) that popped the president? Taste
weaves across the freeway, sirens blaring in the Police Museum, but even
that would crash and burn.
It wouldn't rest easy beside a personal letter from Lyndon Johnston to
the widow of Officer J D Tippit, gunned down by Ruby's victim, Lee
Harvey Oswald. The museum has dozens of grim jokes. The butts always
belongs to those they sling in jail. This isn't a liberals' convention
but a world as black and white as a squad car's markings. There are good
guys and bad guys and the baddest guys burn. In fact capital punishment
in the police museum is a scream, if you ignore that of the victim.
Here, if methods for killing criminals were baseball cards, the museum
would have a complete set. The jovial attitude practically encourages
school-yard swopping. Kids are told to check out the ''awesome''
guillotine, sit down in ''old sparky'', choke a little in the gas
chamber, the effects of which are detailed in a chilling script.
''Essentially you strangle to death. People who have witnessed the use
of the gas chamber state that the natural instinct of the body is to
resist the intake of the gas. Some people have taken 11 minutes to die.
The thrashing of the person in the chair can be so violent that they rip
open their arms and blood spurts over the area and into the window of
the observatory. The face turns purple, the tongue hangs out and the
eyes bulge from the face.''
A warm American accent then tells us now would be a good time to take
pictures. ''Sit in the gas chamber, take your time. Enjoy yourself,''
explains an anonymous actor. The electric chair gets the same
toasty-feel-good treatment. A voice-over explains how the first
recipient of its creature comforts suffered because of new technology.
William Kemmler resembled ''well-cooked beef'' by the time the
Westinghouse Corporation in New York in 1890 had finished experimenting
with alternating current, instead of direct current.
It was quiet the day I paid my pilgrimage and I wasn't weary enough to
take a breather on a dead man's seat. Besides I was worried about stains
on the back of my new ''Don't shoot, I'm not a tourist!'' T-shirt.
Miami's reputation as a shooting gallery is overrated. Today Detroit
is America's new murder city. The crooks don't fly south for winter.
There isn't room. The Mariel boat-lifts of the late seventies flushed a
generation of Cuban criminals into Miami, launching the drug wars.
A legacy of that time remains in a locked room at the heart of the
top-floor museum. Through a plate-glass window the public can peer into
the walk-in gun safe of the FBI. In July 1979 officers from the Miami
branch broke out pump-action shotguns and Smith and Wesson revolvers and
went off to the Dadeland Mall. Cocaine cowboys in an armoured war-wagon
invaded the mall at midday and sprayed it with sub-machine-gun fire. The
cowboys escaped. It was not Miami Vice.
In a later gun-battle five officers were wounded, two of whom later
died.
What was also not Miami Vice were the mannequins dressed in police
uniforms. Not one of them was wearing shades, an electric blue T-shirt,
baggy white trousers or a shiny suit, and all of them were wearing
socks. But whoever dressed the dummies had a sense of humour. Never had
the police seen a more camp display. One hundred years of police wear
turned into a disco of limp wrists and cocked legs.
I was still giggling when I wandered into the lecture room where it
moved on to a laugh. A video-screen was playing a burly detective's
lecture on unarmed combat to a dozen rows of empty metal chairs. Having
obviously missed the section of pro-active combat I arrived just in time
for the retreat. The officer was explaining how best to hide under a car
from a knife-wielding thug.
I didn't have time to wait till 2pm when The Rodney King Trial -- What
The Jury Saw was played. I tried to imagine what the jury did see; white
cops beating an unarmed black man with nightsticks. Maybe they saw the
director's cut in which Rodney whittled the baton they broke over his
back into a deadly stake. After the LA riots you could buy T-shirts in
the city which read: ''LAPD -- We'll Treat You Like A King''.
Yet despite the quiet heroism of tens of thousands of beat cops and
detectives, the most famous policeman in America remains a racist.
Lieutenant Mark Fuhrman was responsible for destroying the prosecution's
case against O J Simpson. It is just as well the museum lacks a Hall Of
Infamy. But such a notion goes against the grain of a cop's Brotherhood.
It's them against us. It is an idea explored in countless movies, the
master of which remains Sydney Lumet.
The director of Prince Of The City, Serpico, and Q&amp;A was asked about
his fascination with cops and he replied: ''In America we are told we
are free to do as we please. A cop is the first person to step forward
and say, 'No, you are not' ''. Author Elmore Leonard graduated from
writing westerns after a reporting assignment covering Detroit's
homicide detectives. His next novel was an urban crime tale.
Before I left I noted one cop's attempts to reverse the role and
become a writer.
What security or good morals could we possibly enjoy
If for some reason the peace officer we did not employ?
Which of his services could we hope to reap
Turning our back on crime and not being able to sleep.
Great guys, lousy poets.
A childhood obsession with American cops has since diluted to an
addiction to crime-fiction. A plastic toy-gun still sits in my top-desk
drawer, a shield right next to it. So as a veteran of 1001 murder
mysteries pulled from page and screen, I approached the staged crime
scene with a certain Columbo swagger. It was a re-created living-room
with a chalk-line silhouette of a body, and blood stained carpet.
A gun lay on the ground, two glasses sat on the coffee table next to a
bottle of bourbon. The ashtray contained butts stained by lipstick. A
voiceover explained the scenario: how a wealthy uncle was found dead by
his nephew who called the police, then his girlfriend, and the
caretaker. The caretaker wasn't woken by a phone-call but arrived later
in the hall and said he had heard four shots.
If we had beards we would have tugged them and if lightbulbs truly
signify inspiration three shining brightly would have appeared at once
over the heads of Silvia on holiday from Tucson, Mike from Memphis, and
myself. ''It was the boyfriend, aided by his lover,'' I said,
confidently strolling towards the entry desk to collect my ''detective''
certificate.
The spotted youth behind the keyring stand was not impressed.
''Nope.''
''What do you mean? I've seen every episode of Quincy.''
''The boyfriend didn't do it.''
''Well who did?''
''The caretaker.''
''What's this -- Pinter? How do you work that one out.''
''He knew four bullets had been fired. Only the police and autopsy doc
would know that.''
''Oh!''
Once more I am reminded the work of cops is never kids' stuff.

BUSINESS funding for the Conservative Party has dropped by more than a
third since 1990, according to new research.
The drop follows the announcement last month that a major corporate
supporter of the Scottish Conservatives, the plant hire group Hewden
Stuart, had withdrawn its financial backing.
Its decision was prompted by the company's ex-chairman, Sir Matthew
Goodwin, a former treasurer of both the Scottish Conservative Party and
the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association.
He was said to have been angered by a tax imposed on the plant-hire
industry despite representations to Treasury Ministers.
The new statistics, compiled by Labour Research, a trade-union
sponsored research group, show that the Conservative Party received
#1.3m less in the last financial year than it did five years ago.
The annual reports of 5000 companies published between March 1994 and
March 1995 showed that 172 firms gave a total of #2.46m to the Tories.
In 1993-94, 198 companies donated #2.8m, while in 1990, 300 companies
gave #3.8m.
The details emerged as senior Tory MP and former Commons leader John
Biffen said the Nolan Committee on standards in public life should
investigate party funding before the next election.
Mr Biffen, who is standing down at the next election warned of the
''dark shadows'' looming over democratic politics if it depended on
large-scale anonymous donations and wanted his party to ''publish and be
damned''.
He thought an investigation into party funding would happen
eventually, ''but I would sooner it happened now than it be left to
simmer and become part of the acrimony of the General Election''.
Labour has sought to keep the Government on the defensive in the wake
of the Commons' vote this week requiring MPs to disclose their outside
earnings by demanding the Tories publish names of donors.
During Commons questions on Tuesday, deputy Labour leader John
Prescott called on John Major to ask the Nolan Committee to investigate
the funding of political parties.
Among those household names which Labour Research has reported to have
stopped donating during 1994-5 were United Biscuits, brewers Whitbread,
and the leisure firm Rank. Since then, a number of other companies,
including Lucas Industries, announced they were stopping donations.
Businesses which started making donations over the past year include
Johnson Matthey, which gave #27,000, and the T&amp;I Group, which restarted
donations having stopped last year.
The Tory Party does not publish a list of those companies making
donations but does publish a figure for the total money it receives.
Labour Research alleges the figure was #1.8m higher than the sum it had
been able to find in the company accounts.

Cameron Simpson watches the monks of Athos load Bud and cigarettes
into their men-only retreat
DEEP in a dark vault in a government building in Athens a file lies
gathering dust. It is stamped Top Secret: Halkidiki. It is only now that
The Herald can reveal some of its secrets. Some, however, are likely to
remain shrouded in mystery for centuries to come -- like Mount Athos
where no woman has set foot for more than 900 years.
Halkidiki is not an island, a cheese or a moussaka but the distinctive
three-pronged peninsula which resembles a trident piercing the Aegean in
northern Greece. Its coasts are lined with 300 miles of Blue Flag
beaches, its hills and mountains tucked up like Scotland in a quilt of
thick pine forests.
Although it lies just one motorway hour from Greece's second city,
Thessaloniki, Halkidiki is largely unscathed by the developments that
have disfigured the face of so many Mediterranean resorts.
The Greeks call it a secret paradise. Just how heavenly it is is
reflected in the fact that most of them take their holidays there, hence
the natural reluctance to go shouting about it to the rest of the world.
But Halkidiki has remained a virtual recluse because of centuries old
rivalry between Thessaloniki and Athens which resembles the antipathy
between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The people of Halkidiki will tell you that because most of the
government is drawn from the south and the islands it is these areas
which have been promoted abroad at the expense of the north. It is best
summed up by the president of the Halkidiki Hotel Association, Doctor
Andreas Andreadis.
As a PhD student in London, studying the unlikely subject of soil
mechanics, he had gone to have a look at the Greek tourist office. ''The
map of my country stopped halfway up and did not show Halkidiki,'' he
told me.
But that is changing now, largely thanks to the efforts of the
association and a PR company in London, run by Doug Goodman, which is in
the vanguard of promoting paradise to Britain.
So what has Halkidiki to offer? The prong of Athos is the most
beautiful of all largely because civilisation has not touched the holy
mountain which lies beyond the fishing village of Ouranoupolis, called
the Heavenly City by the Greeks.
The peninsula with its virgin forests was proclaimed the exclusive
domain of monks in 885 by Byzantine Emperor Basil I. In 1063 it was
decreed that ''no smooth faced person'' be permitted to violate its
sanctity. This prohibition is still in force today and no woman is
allowed to set foot on Mount Athos. The decree is enforced by a monk
toting a Kalashnikov rifle and an equally lethal looking straggly beard
at the border and by boats that patrol the coast.
In its prime, Athos boasted 40 monasteries and about 40,000 monks.
That number has dwindled over the centuries to today when there are only
20 monasteries which are the spiritual home to 1700 monks.
Men wishing to visit Mount Athos must get a special permit while the
rest must end their journey at Ouranoupolis where you can take an #8
cruise on the waters around the peninsula.
You will, if you are lucky, catch sight of the monks as they come to
Ouranoupolis to stock up on provisions. The day we were there we watched
in amazement as they loaded cases of Bud and cartons of cigarettes into
a four-wheel drive jeep.
To make the most of Halkidiki it is best to hire a car and here we hit
a problem. Because the tourist industry is in its infancy -- only 3% of
Halkidiki has been developed -- car hire is expensive -- say #203 for
seven days in low season and #239 in high. It is, however, a problem
that Dr Andreadis recognises.
''The boss of Hertz in Greece is a good friend of mine who has his own
Lear jet,'' he told me, which tells everyone else what a killing Hertz
must be making. On the upside, it is reassuring to know that Dr
Andreadis does not have his own jet.
As a solution, the HHA is thinking of having its own rental fleet of
cars so that it can offer them at a more economic rate.
The middle finger of Halkidiki is called Sithonia. With its quiet
roads, pine forests and purple heather it is reminiscent of Scotland. It
is the weather which is the biggest giveaway.
During the day you see roads lined with gaily coloured treasure chests
whose gold is honey, one of the main products of the region, while at
night the roads are threaded with a necklace of small shrines whose
candles guide the way for the unsure holiday traveller.
For me, one of the most memorable places were Porto Kuofo, or deaf
port, so-called because the sea is so still it makes no sound. The port
is now famous for its seafood but between 1939 and 1945 it had a more
sinister claim. One of the deepest natural harbours in the world, it was
here that the Germans hid their U-boats.
From Porto Kuofo it is a short drive to Neos Marmaras with its
bustling harbours. However, the highlight lies five kilometres up as the
eagle flies to the eyrie of Paul Karapapas in his Taverna Parthenon.
From the taverna you look down on a sparkling ocean that looks like the
gods have spilled champagne.
Karapapas used to be the private chef for a Greek shipping
millionaire. He then did a stint on Long Island before coming back to
run the taverna with his wife.
They typified the warm welcome we were extended throughout the region.
''Here we put people first. We do not think what money you have brought
to spend. You are the important thing,'' he said.
He then produced small glasses of homemade fruit liqueur to toast our
return visit. ''Tell your friends too, they will be made most welcome.
Here we treat strangers as our friends.''
The third prong of the spear is Kassandra. Being the closest to
Thessaloniki -- the port city which will follow Glasgow's footsteps in
1997 by becoming European City of Culture -- it is the most popular and
populated of the three peninsulas.
It is here that Dr Andreadis is developing a resort to outshine any on
the Mediterranean. The Sani Beach Hotel Complex is set in 1000 acres
with five miles of sandy beaches and offers water sports, tennis,
entertainment, restaurants, beach bars and a night club.
One of the joys of the complex -- like the rest of Halkidiki -- is
eating out. A typical meal starts with mezedes such as tzatsiki
(cucumber and yoghurt dip), kolokothakia (fried courgette slices) or
tipiti (Feta cheese dip). The main course is normally fish or meat and
local specialities include souvlakia (marinated grilled meat cooked on a
skewer), giros (traditional pork meat cooked on the spit) and a good
choice of freshly caught seafood. Prices range from #6.50 to #12
including wine, water and coffee.
The day we dined with Dr Andreadis he was getting ready to take his
daughter to Bath where she will take a degree in business studies. He
had thought of sending her to Glasgow but had changed his mind when told
how sociable the people were. His daughter was going to study and
studying was not a time for enjoying yourself. That was the preserve of
the paradise of Halkidiki, he said.
Factfile: Portland, the UK's leading direct booking operator (call
0141 532 0532) and the tour operator Thomson, offer flights and hundreds
of different holidays from 10 UK airports including Glasgow. As a guide
to prices, 14 nights half-board at the Sani Beach costs #722 in July and
August. For the Hotel Aristoteles Beach it is #582 and for the Hotel
Gerakina Beach it is #512. There is also a wide range of excursions
including a full day trip to Thessaloniki for #20 and a similar price
for Meteora which was used as a setting in the Bond film For Your Eyes
Only. An evening at a bouzouki bar also comes highly reommended.
Entrance is free but drinks are pricey. And don't go mad with the
carnation throwing -- each tray costs about #16.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth's commitment to consultation was
called into question by local authorities yesterday when he announced
plans to transfer control of further education student bursary awards,
worth more than #40m a year, to colleges.
Mr Forsyth initially said that transfer of responsibility for
bursaries from education authorities to the 43 colleges would go ahead
from next April.
Later, he said he would listen to the views of councils after the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities called for consultation on the
plans.
Cosla president Rosemary McKenna said Mr Forsyth's ''cavalier''
announcement was out of keeping with his stated intention to work with
local government.
''This is precisely the sort of issue which we would have expected
local authorities to be consulted on and I think it is only right that
the Secretary of State agreed so readily to our request,'' she said.
Mr Forsyth, however, said he still aimed to transfer responsibility
from April next year. The new system would respond more effectively to
student needs, he said.
Ministers argue that it makes no sense for local authorities to retain
control of bursary awards when they no longer have responsibility for FE
colleges.
However, the National Union of Students in Scotland said Mr Forsyth's
''hasty'' decision was not in students' interests. Its president, Mr
Douglas Trainer, said: ''Since becoming self-governing, some colleges
have tended to become self-serving, interested only in running the
course they perceive as bringing in income.''
Among issues to be clarified by the Scottish Office under the new
system are eligibility, the way in which colleges will distribute
bursaries, and whether local authority bursary staff are also to be
transferred to institutions.

<HEADLINE>Devolution could lead to the begging bowl, Scots Secretary tells Institute of Directors. Forsyth fans business fears</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has questioned the way Scotland is
financed from Westminster, strongly hinting that London would give less
money to Scotland if it had its own parliament.
He claimed Scotland would be reduced to ''holding out the begging bowl
for the scraps that fall from Whitehall's table''.
This appears to represent a new tack by Mr Forsyth in the devolution
argument. Until now, he has centred his attacks by concentrating on the
so-called ''tartan tax'' in which a Scottish parliament could vary the
rate of income tax.
His latest comments came last night before 150 Scottish members of the
Institute of Directors, many of whom it is said are concerned about the
instability to the business environment that devolution might bring.
Mr Forsyth played on their fears by claiming that the Barnett formula,
on which is based the level of Government spending in Scotland, would be
at risk once English MPs saw a tax-raising assembly in Scotland.
It was for defending the Barnett formula in the recent round of public
expenditure cuts that Mr Forsyth received much praise. The Scottish
Secretary emerged as a strong defender of Scotland's spending plans,
although Opposition MPs have raised doubts as to whether this was a
genuine defence or merely a public relations exercise.
Nevertheless, Mr Forsyth, addressing the IoD's annual conference at
Gleneagles, asked who would defend the formula once there was a
parliament in Scotland.
''The Secretary of State?'' he queried. ''But there might well not be
any such office-holder. And if there was, how could he possibly justify
Cabinet rank?
''What would actually happen is an inevitable erosion of Scotland's
share of the public expenditure cake, with no-one properly to fight our
cause and Scotland reduced each year to holding out the begging bowl for
the scraps that fall from Whitehall's table.
''That isn't self-determination. That is pure folly,'' he stated.
He continued his attack on the proposed parliament's tax-raising
abilities. Labour says that income tax in Scotland would not necessarily
go up but could in fact go down with a Scottish parliament. Mr Forsyth
ridiculed such a suggestion and raised a laugh from the directors when
he stated: ''That's rather like claiming that the Titanic could go up as
well as down.''
He claimed that if an extra 3p in the pound was imposed in tax it
would take #6 a week out of Scottish pockets and this would make
employees force their employers to make good the difference -- leading
to job losses.
There is concern in the business community that a Scottish parliament
could be harmful to business simply because it would create a period of
instability. Opposition MPs, such as Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson, have been holding a series of meetings with business
leaders to reassure them that devolution could in fact present them with
opportunities.
Mr David Smith, chairman of the Scottish division of the IoD, said
last night that businesses did not wish to be distracted by having to
look over their shoulders at what was happening politically in Scotland.
''The attitude of many businesses is that they believe they have
enough problems with trying to discover the feel-good factor and they do
not wish to explore the possibility of changes in the way the country is
run, even though some people will argue that the change will be a benign
one.
''Others see it as a malevolent change but, either way, the
uncertainty it would induce is not something businesses would want.''
The Conservative Government has been unhappy that many business
leaders have been unwilling to speak out publicly against Labour's
devolution plans and it is likely that Mr Forsyth was telling them
privately last night that if they do not agree with it then they should
be more voluble in their opposition.

HOLLYWOOD stars may come to the Highlands for a glitzy premiere of the
#6m film Loch Ness.
Eden Court Theatre in Inverness seems certain to host the first
British showing of the film starring Ted Danson, of Cheers fame, Joely
Richardson, the leading lady in the BBC production Lady Chatterley's
Lover, and Ian Holm.
The production company responsible for making the film has confirmed
that Inverness will be the venue for the event, making it a noteable
hat-trick of premieres for Scotland after Rob Roy in Edinburgh and
Braveheart in Stirling.
Working Title, which also made Four Weddings and a Funeral, says it is
pointless to have ''yet another'' premiere in London and says Inverness
is the obvious choice.
Highland Regional Council officials met with the film makers in London
earlier this month to discuss the advantages of taking the premiere
north.
But the council is reluctant to confirm its success because it has not
received official confirmation from the film's financers, Polygram Films
and Entertainment UK.
Polygram representatives are known to have approached Danson and
Richardson's agents to ask them if they are available for the Inverness
premiere which would be staged in February.
The regional council has backing for the event from the Scottish
Screens Initiative and the British Film Commission.
Mr Duncan MacPherson, the council's convener, said: ''We will give the
film makers every assistance that we can to stage the premiere here. It
will be a major boost for the whole area and I am sure it will be good
for the film as well.''
In the film, some of which was shot on the shores of Loch Ness and in
the tiny west Highland village of Diabeg, Danson plays a scientist who
is sent on a mission to find Nessie. What he finds is love with Joely
Richardson, who plays a local hotelier.
The producers are refusing to be drawn on whether Nessie makes an
appearance.

THE family of a man who died from head injuries after being arrested
for being drunk and incapable said they were ''not happy'' that no
recommendations on police procedures were made following a fatal
accident inquiry at Kilmarnock yesterday.
Sheriff Thomas Croan returned a formal verdict after the inquiry into
the death of Mr John Scally, 42, of Aitken Street, Dalry, who died in a
police cell at Kilbirnie.
Police witnesses had said they saw no sign of injury on Mr Scally when
they apprehended him and a leading neurosurgeon told the inquiry that Mr
Scally's head injuries were such that even with early detection and
medical attention his chances of survival would have been 20% at best.
A solicitor representing the family had asked Sheriff Croan to make a
ruling on the procedures associated with dealing with people who were
drunk and incapable to take away the ''level of assumption'' involved
for police officers.
Sheriff Croan said he did not feel he could make any recommendation
about procedures that would be helpful. He added: ''It may be for senior
police officers who have heard the evidence today to consider that.
''Things might have been different, and I say no more than 'might have
been different', if witnesses who had seen Mr Scally fall had remained
on the scene to tell police officers what they had witnessed.''
Mrs Maureen Scally, the sister-in-law of the deceased, said outside
the court: ''The family has not had any satisfaction today and we are
not happy with what we heard. We did not come here to find out that John
died of head injuries. We knew that already. We came to find out why it
happened and what is being done to make sure it doesn't happen again.''
Mr Scally was found lying on the pavement near his home on July 9 and
was arrested by patrolling police officers for being drunk and
incapable.
He was taken to Kilbirnie police office and locked in a cell under
regular inspection. During one visit an officer saw signs of vomiting,
could not find a pulse, and made vain attempts with a colleague to
resuscitate him.
Constable Robert Smith, 34, told the inquiry that he had been on
mobile patrol with a colleague in New Street, Dalry, when they saw a man
lying on the pavement.
Mr Smith said there was a plastic bag containing a bottle of cider
beside the man and a broken alcohol bottle nearby in a pool of fresh
liquid. ''The man was smelling very strongly of alcohol and his speech
was slurred,'' he said.
Asked by procurator-fiscal depute Robert Bloomer if there were signs
of blood or injury on the man, the officer replied: ''None at all.''
Asked by Mr Jack Harris, representing Mr Scally's family, if he
thought it would have been advisable to have him examined by a doctor,
the officer replied: ''Of the three officers there, none of us felt any
concern. He said he was all right and there were no immediate signs of
injury.''
Mr Thomas Hyde, 60, a consultant neurosurgeon at the Southern General
Hospital, said that he had seen Mr Scally on a number of occasions
between 1988 and 1990 for treatment to a leakage from the brain. He said
this had been treated and cured and did not have any bearing on his
death.
Asked by Mr Bloomer if, having studied the post-mortem report, Mr Hyde
could give an opinion of Mr Scally's chances of survival even with
expert treatment, he replied: ''They would have been very low, somewhere
about 20%.''
Dr Nancy Cunningham, 54, a consultant pathologist at Crosshouse
Hospital, said that a post-mortem examination showed that Mr Scally had
died from a skull fracture with associated brain damage. She ruled out
the inhalation of vomit as a possible cause of death. Tests showed that
Mr Scally had 348mgs of alcohol per 100mls of blood, which the doctor
described as a ''very high'' level.

FABRIC treated to keep it wrinkle-free was under examination yesterday
as health experts tried to find the cause of a chemical scare at a
Lanarkshire clothing factory.
Staff from the Health and Safety Executive hope to know by tomorrow or
Monday what caused the outbreak of skin rashes and breathing problems at
the Daks-Simpson factory in Larkhall.
Staff who returned to work yesterday -- the day after 42 women workers
were taken to hospital for emergency treatment -- were sent home by the
company's director for Scotland, Mr Kevin Johnson.
The 1700-strong workforce have been told to come back again on Monday.
Dr Sayed Ahmed, a public health physician with Lanarkshire Health Board,
said medical staff would be on hand to monitor the situation.
Meantime, an HSE inspector, a hygienist, two scientists, and doctors,
including leading dermatologist Dr Angela Forsyth, are investigating. A
health and safety spokesman said: ''One of our major lines of inquiry
concerns the chemicals in the textiles supplied to the factory.''
Formaldehyde is among the chemicals used to make clothing materials
wrinkle-resistant. Dr Ian Dale, an occupational health specialist with
Greater Glasgow Health Board, confirmed formaldehyde had been linked to
skin irritation and respiratory problems in studies carried out in the
US and Poland.
Dr Ahmed said: ''To date we have found nothing pointing to an
infection, so now they are looking at any chemical processing that might
be involved. I have been told that they make jackets, rather than
trousers, at Larkhall and that formaldehyde is not normally used in
jacket fabric. But they get their material from various places in
England so there is always a chance that something out of the ordinary
has been sent up.''
Dr Ahmed said he and his colleagues would be ''treating seriously''
the claims reported yesterday that 20 women at the factory have suffered
miscarriages in the past four months -- higher than the expected
incidence of between three to 13 for the population.

CAMPAIGNERS yesterday called for police to be prosecuted after an
inquest jury ruled that an Irishman who died after being pinned down by
a group of officers had been killed unlawfully.
A new report on the death of father-of-seven Richard O'Brien, 37, will
now be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
The DPP had decided against charging any of the officers involved in
Mr O'Brien's arrest outside the English Martyrs Club in Walworth, south
London, on Easter Monday last year after studying a previous report by
Scotland Yard's internal Complaints Investigation Bureau.
Southwark coroner Sir Montague Levine said yesterday the case had
shown an ''appalling lack of instruction'' in the training of police
officers in restraint techniques.
He went on to recommend the regular retraining of officers and
improved education in methods of monitoring individuals who are involved
in restraint.
''There should be a well-defined protocol laid down for all police to
obtain immediate help in medical conditions and emergencies which can be
related to physical restraint,'' he said.
''Finally, there is a great need for a programme of research and
investigation into injuries -- fatal and otherwise -- related to
physical restraint.''
The inquest heard claims that Mr O'Brien, a market trader from
Underhill Road, Dulwich, was pushed and racially abused while being
arrested.
He fell to the ground with five police officers, who held him there
with his face to the pavement while one of them, Constable Richard
Ilett, knelt on his back.
His widow, Mrs Alison O'Brien, said after the verdict: ''I'm
delighted. The truth has finally got out now and after 18 months someone
actually believes our story. It won't bring my husband back but he might
rest in peace now.''
Ms Deborah Coles, of the pressure group Inquest, said she believed
there was a prima facie case of manslaughter to answer.
She said: ''We are going to campaign to make sure these officers are
brought to account for their conduct. This should never have gone to an
inquest but should have been a criminal trial from the start.''
Civil rights group Liberty said: ''Individual officers need to be
responsible for their actions. This is not an isolated incident and it
is a matter for the Government to uphold respect for the basic right to
life.''
In a statement, Scotland Yard said: ''The Metropolitan Police Service
deeply regrets the death of Mr O'Brien and the distress caused to his
family. In view of the finding of the jury, a further report will be
submitted to the DPP as to any fresh evidence which emerged during the
inquest.''
The jury heard that Mr O'Brien's 14-year-old son, Richard, was slapped
and arrested by another officer after pleading with them to check on his
father, who had shouted: ''Let me up, let me up. I can't breathe. You
win.'' A police officer is said to have replied: ''We always win.''
Pathologist Dr Vesna Djurovic said Mr O'Brien had 31 sites of injury
on his body, including cuts and bruising to his face, a dislodged tooth,
and fractured ribs.
Dr Djurovic gave the cause of death, saying: ''In my opinion, he died
as a result of postural asphyxia following a struggle against
restraint.''
After being held on the ground, Mr O'Brien was carried to a police van
by six officers, where he was half-pushed and half-dragged in.
His wife recalled an officer shouting: ''We can't get the big fat
Paddy in,'' before another grabbed him by the hair or head.
Constable Ilett insisted Mr O'Brien had been drunk and struggled
violently on arrest. He said he had not seen any of the 31 injuries Mr
O'Brien sustained and said he had shown nothing but concern for him.
Counsel representing the family, Mr Patrick O'Connor, held up a
photograph of Mr O'Brien showing his bloodstained and battered face and
asked the officer: ''Does this show your concern?''
The five police constables who restrained Mr O'Brien were: Richard
Ilett; Philip Palmer; James Barber; David Magnus; and Gary Lockwood.

THE best way to read a life is backwards, for the child is father to
the man, even the ''sixty-year-old smiling public man'' as Yeats called
himself ''among school children''. How much more true this is of a
thinker's ideas. In order to understand an old man's visions we must
eavesdrop on the young man's dreams. John Muir has left us a feast of
writing which can take us backwards from the one to the other.
The way that others have seen Muir after his death has predominantly
been as the hermit of Yosemite, John of the Mountains, the voice crying
on behalf of the wilderness. Yet he was a vigorous and well connected
organiser of political pressure groups. Reluctantly, but effectively,he
shaped arguments to influence an urban, politicised, east coast elite.
Behind this second mask was the scientific writer, whose theses were
soundly based on fieldwork and made unique by their lack of
specialisation, their ability to make connections between aspects of the
natural world, to describe what we now call ecology.
This was the work of his thirties and forties. It was built on another
level of mental activity, a driven intense absorption of self into
nature which is poetic and mystical but at the same time hard and real.
The glimpses of this world in Muir's writings are extraordinary. They
underlie the later levels of his thought and yet they are the most
immediate in their appeal and relevance to our own wanderings in the
half-wilderness of Scotland a hundred and thirty years later. They are
the young man's emotions empowering an older man's reason. They are
visionary dreams.
Words had always been Muir's most cherished talent, learned from his
lay preaching father and gaining a direct metamorphical richness as the
lowland Scots of his youth was given muscle by the hard farming in
Wisconsin. As a young man he had delighted strangers with his speech and
even dared to delight himself with a poem. When as an old man he wrote
his lyrical descriptions of Yosemite, of Mount Shasta, of the meadows of
California and the glaciers of Alaska, he was at the peak of his
decriptive powers, though he always thought the life of a writer, like
that of a glacier, was a slow grind.
Yet he was capable of excoriating political directness when engaged in
what his fellow activist and editor Robert Johnson called ''spiritual
lobbying''. Lawyers and lumbermen he called ''patriotic thieves''. Muir
wrote: '' 'All of our precious mountains . . .' they screamed, 'are
smothered up in mere pleasure grounds for wild beasts and a set of sick,
rich dawdling sentimentalists.'' Which in plain English means: 'Let us
steal and destroy in peace.' ''
When he found that to resist the economic exploitation of the
wilderness he had to invite urban Americans to enjoy it in person, his
voice retained its cadences: ''Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken,
over-civilised people are beginning to find out that going to the
mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity.'' Muir remaind
socially sensitive all his life: to his family, to his community, to
fellow travellers of all races and later, as he found his ideas moving
into the intellectual and political mainstream of the USA, to the power
structures of the nation and the needs of its people. This was not a
hermit.
Nor was he a waffling visionary. The issue which brought him to wide
public knowledge was the argument with the Californian State Geologist,
Whitney, over the forces which had snapped Yosemite valley. Muir's
arguments that they were glacial were not only based on detailed and
extensive observation; they were in the forefront of contemporary
theories and glaciation. When, inevitably, he came to wrestle with the
overwhelming arguments of Darwinism, he integrated them into his own
thought and came up with an original and still modern creed. ''No dogma
taught by the present civilisation seems to form so insuperable an
obstacle in the way of a right understanding of the relations which
culture sustains to wildness as that which regards the world as made
especially for the uses of man.'' Again: ''I have never yet happened
upon a trace of evidence that seemed to show that any one animal was
ever made for another as much as it was made for itself.'' Richard
Dawkins would agree.
What drove him to engage so deeply in scientific theory? He believed
that good science depended on spiritual passion. If you could ''become
all eye, sifted through and through with light and beauty . . . instead
of producing a dissipated condition, the mind is fertilised and
stimulated and developed like sun-fed plants.'' Botany, biology, geology
all depended on the aesthetic energy which enabled them to be seen as
one linked science of nature. But at the same time spiritual sustenance
from the wilderness depended on its appreciation with intellectual as
well as physical faculties. The wanderer in the wild is not a dreamer
but sharply, intellectually, scientifically awake.
To understand the emotional charge behind his scientific and political
arguments, you have to look at his informal writings. When he first set
off alone on his ''Thousand mile walk to the Gulf'', he had to face and
describe his own feelings of loneliness and vulnerability. Hidden in a
deserted graveyard outside Savannah, lacking money and food, he forced
himself to understand his own mortality and the rich, damp swamp
''obliterating all memory of the confusion of man''. Perhaps it was a
Calvinist asceticism which allowed him to move way from the biblical
belief in man's special relationship to creation and to accept and then
delight in the more difficult ecological argument of human
insignificance.
Certainly, by the time he reached the Sierra Nevada the following
spring he was able to immerse himself in the wonders and dangers of the
world without regret. In 1870, his mentor Jeanne Carr received an almost
incoherent letter from him as he sat in the autumn groves of Sequoia:
''What giant truths since coming to gigantea, what magnificent clusters
of Sequoia becauses. From here I cannot recite you one, for you are down
a thousand fathoms deep in dark political quagg . . . But I'm in the
woods woods woods and they are in me-ee-ee.'' He was 32. He was in touch
with the fire that would light his scientific and political future and
which warms us as we wander in our local wilderness today. He had
journeyed from the religion of his father and his fatherland, though
maybe not so far from his boyhood in Dunbar.

WHILE on the catwalks of Milan and Paris this autumn it was all about
colour and smart cut, among the fashion-conscious ladies of Edinburgh
four centuries ago the big worry was how much of your face could
reasonably be exposed en route to a love tryst or how much material you
could trail behind as you sashayed down the causeway.
For years Scottish authorities had frowned on the ladies who moved
about the city ''mussaled'' or with their faces partially covered.
Apparently this meant that it was impossible to tell a princess from a
prostitute -- a potential loss of napper situation in those days.
However, it seems the practice was so useful in love intrigues that,
despite the passing of an Act of Parliament specifically to outlaw the
habit and carrying a whole series of penalties, the veiled ladies of
Edinburgh were still a common sight in the early 1500s.
Sir David Lindsay, court poet to James IV, seems to have found the
whole affair something of a hoot and argued that it was reasonable for
the ladies to wear the veil when gadding about the town for a rendezvous
with their fancymen. But he drew a line when it came to turning up at
the kirk or market in the ''mussaled'' style. It's clear that the
Turkish-delight look had become a social as well as a fashion statement
in sixteenth-century Edinburgh.
Lindsay, a keen observer of the social scene, also had something to
say about the style of wearing long ''syde-tails'' by which the ladies
of high rank asserted their superiority and encouraged women of the
lower social orders to follow their example. The poet even penned a
Supplication to the King's Grace in Contemplation of Syde-tails, a neat
piece of satire which poked fun at the followers of fashion and
described how the trains often trailed two or three feet behind the
wearer and as a result the streets of Edinburgh were swept marvellously
clean.
In fact, most of the information that has reached us from the period
about fashion trends comes from the works of the poets.
Robert Henryson, who flourished in the late 1400s, in his poem Garment
of Good Ladies tells us that a complete dress of a lady consisted of a
gown ribboned and purfled (embroidered around its edges), a furred
kirtle (an outer petticoat) laced with eyelet holes, an outer cloak or
mantle, a tippet (a fur cape) and a shift of which the upper part was
visible to show the rich needlework.
At the time, amber necklaces were all the rage for those and such as
those and interestingly the farthingale or hooped petticoat had already
come into use in Scotland before it did south of the Border, a rare
first for Scotland in the fashion stakes and presumably resulting from
our continuing links with the Continent, particularly the trendy French
court.
ANOTHER poet, William Dunbar, confirms the impression that red or
scarlet, followed by black or gold, were the favoured colours among
middle-class womenfolk and in his Friars of Berwick he describes the
hostess of an inn who, when she receives her boyfriend, is dressed in a
kirtle of fine red silk, ornamented with silver. He also notes that she
wore two rings on every finger.
If the amount of jewellery seems extravagant you have to remember that
in medieval Scotland, without the benefit of banks, the master of the
house might invest his capital on jewellery and place it on his
gentlewoman's hand where it might be as safe, or so we're told, as in a
bank vault.

BRITISH Airways is to open new air routes in Scotland, its chairman
pledged to Scottish business leaders yesterday, writes KEN SMITH.
There had been fears that the recent rush of small airlines offering
cheap fares to London would have harmed the national carrier but BA
chairman Sir Colin Marshall, told a conference that BA welcomed new
low-fare competition as it helped expand the overall market.
So far, BA has announced that a new service would start between
Edinburgh and London Gatwick next April, taking to 41 the number of
daily flights it provides between Scotland and London.
The next expansion will probably be a new Inverness to the Midlands
service, Sir Colin told the annual conference of the Scottish division
of the Institute of Directors at Gleneagles.
BA is also working with Highlands and Islands Airports on ways to
expand the Loganair network which flies under the BA flag.
Sir Colin further revealed a #1m investment to modify the 757 jets
which fly from Glasgow to New York and Boston, and the opening next
month of a 70-seat executive club lounge at Glasgow Airport.
''We remain as keen to invest in and develop our markets in Scotland
as we do in, say Asia, North America or mainland Europe. It is why we
did not give up on the economic conundrum of direct transatlantic
services,'' said Sir Colin.
The conference was also reassured by BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance
that there was no ''sweetheart deal'' between BT and the Labour Party.
Labour leader Tony Blair achieved a publicity coup when he announced
at his annual conference that BT had agreed to link up schools and
hospitals to the so-called information superhighway in return for access
to broadcast entertainment services by an incoming Labour Government.
This proved embarrassing not only to the present Government but also
to BT, which had been one of the largest beneficiaries of the
Conservative privatisation programme.
Sir Iain yesterday said the media had presented a ''confused picture''
of what had actually been agreed.
There had been no deal as such with Labour, he said, merely that BT,
along with other telecommunications companies, had discussed the issues
at a Labour policy forum on the information superhighway.
The forum had accepted the conclusions of the all-party Trade and
Industry Committee that the restrictions on BT, introduced to allow
fledgling cable companies to get a toe-hold in the market, should
eventually be lifted and that, in return, public institutions should be
connected free of charge.
''BT does not take a party political line on this or any other
issue,'' he said. ''We would have given exactly the same response to the
Government if they had adopted the select committee's report and made us
the same offer.''
Sir Iain went on to speak of the possible damage to Scotland's cities
through the growth of telecommunications.
The apocalyptic scenario, he said, was that information-based services
would migrate to the Third World because of cheaper labour costs.
Cities such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen would begin to lose
their vibrancy and wither.
It would result in people leaving the cities looking for work and all
that would be left in the smaller towns would be low-tech, low-paid
employment.
However, he said there was an alternative vision whereby Scotland
could attract and develop the new services that the information
revolution would bring.
''Scotland will have seen the changes coming and will be prepared for
them. In this scenario, Scotland is successful because she is quick to
recognise that the new industries will require new talents and new
skills to ensure a smooth transition to the information age.
''She will have proved the truth of the proposition that those nations
best able to adapt to new techniques and skills are the best at creating
jobs,'' he said.
Technological change, he emphasised, was neutral. Which scenario would
apply to Scotland would depend on the country showing real determination
and self-confidence to take advantage of developments.

Orienteering can attract 15,000 competitors at major events in Sweden.
Aileen Little talks to a woman who wants to see the pastime she is
passionate about become as popular in this country
A NON-ORIENTEERS' sole contact with the sport is likely to be those
plastic flyers stuck on to car rear windows: Cunning Running, The
Thought Sport, Give Me A Map And I'm Magic. Sue Harvey is familiar with
them all. Midway through her presidency of the global International
Orienteering Federation, she reckons the one about about magic best
encapsulates her sports unique appeal. ''Most people use maps all the
time,'' she explains. ''Those big blue signs on motorways are just maps
of junctions; even a zed-bend sign is effectively a generalised map.
Orienteers map read competitively, that's all -- they see who can do it
fastest. Reading a street map is orienteering without the time limit. A
map can take you anywhere -- it is magic.''
Maps have certainly taken Harvey places -- at one point she was the
world's eleventh fastest female orienteer over 45. But her presidential
role has introduced a new travel dimension. Every six weeks, she sets
out from home in Doune, Perthshire, for Heathrow and a flight to
Stockholm, headquarters of the IOF's secretariat which is overseen by a
full-time secretary-general. The Federation's 45 member countries
encompass a range of scale from Sweden's half million orienteers (Sweden
held the world's first orienteering event in 1898) to smaller
federations in Brazil, Cuba, and Eastern Europe. Later this month,
Harvey will visit Japan to discuss ski orienteering, then she is due at
the annual General Assembly Of International Sports Federations, held
this year in Korea.
''One spends a hell of a lot of time in airports and you wonder what
country you are in,'' says Harvey, who describes herself as a major
benefactor of British bookshops -- especially the Virago Press stand at
Terminal One.
Despite the pressures of her role (during absences she leaves capable
staff in charge of her cartography business in Doune), the first female
IOF president says she is relishing the challenge. She had to compete
for the job. But having seen her notch up a long history of service on
IOF committees, a stint as secretary general, a spell as editor of the
IOF journal and a four-year term as one of three vice-presidents, few
were surprised when Harvey secured the post. It was one she wanted. ''I
felt I had a contribution to make and that I could handle it.''
Her contribution coincides with two key developments which look set to
introduce orienteering to a wider audience and to release it from
financial constraints. At present, orienteering receives scant media
coverage (despite two million orienteers worldwide and 120 UK clubs,
including 30 in Scotland). It is generally forest-based and therefore
problematic to televise. But this may be about to change. It is now
technically possible to track competitors in the forest -- Harvey ran a
demonstration race for the press at the biannual world championships in
Germany last month, and the system is to be used at the next world event
in Norway in 1997.
On their way round a course, orienteers have to give proof of finding
checkpoints by pinpunching a card at each spot. These cards are verified
at the end by an army of volunteers. Three thousand five hundred
competitors attend major events -- sometimes 15,000 in Sweden. But with
electronics, runners will wear a device on their finger which informs an
electronic brain of their position -- not only a huge saving in
manpower, but a means of pinpointing an individual on a television
screen, as is already done in sailing and in ski coverage.
Happily, technology like this can now be developed thanks to a #40,000
yearly sponsorship deal Harvey has helped to strike with Suunto, a
Finish firm which manufactures compasses and forestry surveying
equipment. ''It's timely for all of us. Suunto wants to expand into the
outdoor/leisure market and we want to raise our media profile,'' points
out Harvey. Sponsorship enabled the new president and other IOF
personnel to appear at last month's world championships in custom-made
clothing bearing the federation logo -- essential if grassroots
orienteers are to identify their sports policy makers.
Harvey is passionate about keeping in touch with what the ordinary
orienteer-in-the-forest wants. ''I'm accosted continuously at world
events by a wide range of people. I think it's marvellous. One wants to
be available to hear people's views.''
One question preoccupying grassroots orienteers is the sport's bid for
acceptance into the Olympic fold. Already ''recognised'' by the
International Olympic Committee, orienteering's best chance is to join
on the back of ski orienteering. The Winter Olympics actively seeks new
events, especially any involving women, and Salt Lake City (host nation
for 2002) is considering incorporating ski orienteering into the
programme. At local club level, some orienteers fret lest the
tranquility of their sport is hijacked by a media circus. Harvey urges
critics to consider the implications of an enormous injection of cash.
Another controversial development is OMB -- Orienteering on Mountain
Bikes. This, argues Harvey, offers all the colour, speed, and daring
necessary to attract young people and ecological problems are not an
issue: unlike conventional mountain bikers, the orienteering variety is
confined to tracks. Disabled people have access to orienteering to. Five
years ago, Sue Harvey sustained a serious back injury which at one point
reduced walking to 30 metres. Adversity turned into opportunity,
however, and Harvey helped with the British development of a new form of
orienteering for wheelchair-bound enthusiasts. Invented in Sweden, Trail
O still focuses on a map, but competitors remain in their wheelchairs
and use their eyes to locate targets. Intellectually, says Harvey from
personal experience, it is quite taxing.
Whatever your orienteering orientation, Scotland has the terrain for
it -- apparently the best in Western Europe after Scandinavia, though
Russia and the Baltic countries are ''fantastic''. Successful events
depend on mutual co-operation with landowners, and when the landowner
happens to be Forest Enterprise clubs pay a fee according to a national
agreement. Orienteers have built up an enviable reputation for
responsible behaviour, but then they tend to be pretty serious types
anyway.
Sue Harvey quotes research done in Australia and Sweden which reveals
orienteers to be well educated, with certain financial resources (a car
is almost essential to get to forests). ''We are relatively traditional
and conservative. We tend to be in the professions and good with
technology. That's not to say you need to be an engineer with an honours
degree -- kids can take to orienteering before they can read.'' Harvey
herself is a graduate of Russian and Arabic, with a working knowledge of
three other languages.
This mother of one who has had to put on hold her love of gardening
and guitar playing, would like her presidential term to be remembered as
the beginning of a new age -- a period when orienteering started to find
its feet as a real sport. ''We have the chance now, but it requires
co-ordination, leadership and management''. Few doubt that Harvey is the
one to do it.

PRIME Minister John Major came in for fierce criticism at home and
abroad yesterday after his support for French nuclear testing in the
South Pacific left him virtually isolated at the Commonwealth conference
in New Zealand.
At home both Labour and the Liberal Democrats condemned him for his
refusal to criticise the French.
In New Zealand Commonwealth countries issued a toughly-worded
statement calling for an immediate halt to underground explosions, but
Mr Major dismissed it and retorted angrily: ''What they have got in
their statement is factually inaccurate, intellectually inconsistent and
unbalanced, and I have not signed up to that.
''I hardly think I am sitting on the fence on nuclear testing. I have
made perfectly clear that I think the view expressed by Commonwealth
colleagues is just plain wrong. That has been my position right the way
through and it remains my position now.''
This attracted a bitter reaction from Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook who said: ''He has refused to speak for the overwhelming majority
of people of Britain who feel these tests are unnecessary.
''He has abandoned Britain's role as leader of the Commonwealth and we
now have a split in the Commonwealth in which Britain is isolated.''
The Liberal Democrats' Foreign Affairs spokesman, Fife North East MP
Menzies Campbell, said: ''There is no scientific or military case for
further nuclear testing and the political damage being caused by
Britain's failure to say so is unacceptable. Our position is made worse
by the use of petulant language redolent of Mrs Thatcher at her most
intransigent.''
Mr Major told the opening session of the conference that he understood
why feelings were running so high, but urged fellow leaders to look
forward to the greater prize of a nuclear-free South Pacific and a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, once France had completed the
tests in the first half of 1996.
He understood the burden of responsibility on President Chirac to keep
France's nuclear deterrent in working order and it would be hypocritical
of him to condemn the tests.
* Eight Greenpeace activists were being questioned last night after
being arrested close to a flotilla of French warships moored on the
Thames, police said.

THE plight of low-paid workers in Scotland, most of whom are women,
will form the central theme of the 1995 STUC women's conference in Perth
next week.
The conference will hear motions that will reinforce demands for a
national minimum wage, call for equal rights for part-time workers, and
condemn Government plans for a voucher scheme to fund nursery education.
Chairwoman Helen Stevens said: ''Women workers tend to feel the
problem of poverty pay first because they are in the sort of areas in
which employment is part-time or insecure, and companies take
advantage.''
The conference will also hear an emergency motion protesting the
Labour Party plan, unveiled on Thursday, to deny unemployment benefit to
under-25s who refuse to join training schemes.
The outcome of the Scottish Constitutional Convention will be
appraised and a call will be made for the 50/50 principle on male and
female representatives to be enshrined in a future Scottish parliament.

ROB ROY (rental, cert 15).
* SCOTTISH patriot and guerrilla freedom fighter? Inventor of the
protection racket? Or just the hero of that mystery-shrouded Glasgow
children's song The Man That Ate The Boiled Ham Raw?
For the purposes of filmed entertainment, who cares? If you're
actually deeply exercised by the true historical status of the only
Highland clan chief ever to have appeared on the label of a packet of
dried lentils, don't expect Michael Caton-Jones's rousing
semi-historical adventure romp to leave you any wiser. Just enjoy it,
along with the rest of us, for its carefully spaced and crunchily
directed action sequences; its creation of hissable baddies and a hero
you'd follow to hell; its brilliantly evocative photography, indoors as
well as out; and its gallery of scenery-chewing, no-holds barred
melodrama performances.
Liam Neeson finds an Irish accent no great handicap (who knows what
Rob Roy sounded like, anyway?) as he swashbuckles his way through a
stirring, and in its broad sweep not entirely inaccurate, plotline based
on the brutalities of eighteenth-century Scottish landlordism
(dispossession, evictions, sheep, firing of roofs, atrocity-prone
English soldiery). Proceedings are helped on no end by Brian Cox as a
wicked but pawkily humorous landlord's factor, Tim Roth as the scented
English fop ganging up with the factor and the laird in a conspiracy of
robbery and murder, and Jessica Lange (''Och, ye're sae fine tae me,
Robert MacGregor!'') as the flashing-eyed Mrs Rob Roy.
It may not be a film on the same epic scale as its summer rival
Braveheart, but it loses nothing to Mel Gibson's rabble-rouser in point
of thrills, romance, humour, or sheer tartan audacity. Rent this picture
or Couch MacPotato will come round by dead of night and steal your
livestock!
MURIEL'S WEDDING (rental, cert 15).
* ANOTHER Aussie heartwarmer in the same vein of camp, kitsch, and
cheerful vulgarity as Strictly Ballroom and Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert, writer-director P J Hogan's ugly-duckling comedy-drama is
something like Carrie except that the dowdy, put-upon, no-fun heroine
Muriel (Toni Collette) doesn't eventually find it necessary to murder
all her enemies and set the high-school prom on fire. After all, she's
already left school.
Instead, she meets up with a high-spirited old school chum called
Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) who rescues her from her monstrous family in
the backwater of Porpoise Spit and a life of tearfully playing Abba
records alone in her room, takes her to live in Sydney, and generally
shows her a good old girly time. So far, so jolly, but then the picture
detours into the realms of tragedy when party girl Rhonda, by a plot
device we won't signal in advance, suddenly becomes dependent on her
protege instead of the other way around, and the flavour turns slightly
sour.
Sympathetic performances (both stars are as likeable sheilas as ever
chucked another prawn on the barbie) and a cunning sleight of hand in
the storyline eventually get Muriel's Wedding back to Fun City, but it's
a pity the uncertainty of tone between boisterous and bittersweet takes
some of the sparkle off what is generally a good-natured and
kind-hearted Girls Just Wanna Have Fun romp.

BRITAIN'S largest manufacturing union, the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, looks set to have its first left-wing president since
Hugh (now Lord) Scanlon retired in 1978.
All the signs are that Tyneside district secretary Davey Hall, 44, has
triumphed in the run-off against fellow Geordie, North-east executive
member Jackie Crystal, and could be heading the union by Christmas.
Although the presidential ballot result is not due to be declared
until early next month, left-wingers are encouraged by a decisive
victory in a parallel election for a national organiser, also involving
two Geordies, which has resulted in a 2-1 victory for the left.
The presidency was left vacant when Mr Bill Jordan moved to Brussels
earlier this year as the first British general secetary of the
International Confederation of Free Trades Unions.
In the battle for the general secretaryship, former EETPU president
Lancastrian Ken Jackson, 58, looks set to defeat yet another Geordie,
electrical section executive member Barry Davies, to be installed in the
post he has in fact been filling since Mr Paul Gallagher retired on
health grounds a few months ago.
Mr Hall got his chance to run only because the union's leading
left-winger, Scottish executive councillor Jimmie Airlie, 59, stood
aside and campaigned for the younger man.

GORDON Graham -- evicted from a Glenrothes council house because of
anti-social behaviour -- is suffering from depression and paranoia, a
court was told yesterday.
Defence counsel Larry Flynn told Peterhead Sheriff Court that Graham,
40, has been receiving specialist psychiatric help and was taking pills
to treat the condition.
Graham, 40, appeared from custody, charged with several driving
offences. Mr Flynn added that his client had threatened suicide while on
remand.
''My client has made various remarks of a suicidal nature to me. Since
August, he has become a completely different character,'' said Mr Flynn.
He also suggested press attention had contributed to Graham's
distressed state.
''This interest from the press has not waned and my client is
suffering from a degree of paranoia and depression and is on medication.
''It's fair to say he is now at breaking point,'' said Mr Flynn.
He added that Graham had recently been seeing a specialist psychiatric
nurse, based at Aberdeen's Royal Cornhill Hospital, on a weekly basis.
After being evicted from Glenrothes, the Grahams had moved to a
two-bedroomed cottage in Rosehearty, near Fraserburgh, on the Moray
Firth.
However, within a few weeks, Graham -- who has a life ban for driving
while disqualified -- was arrested near his home on suspicion of drink
driving.
At a hearing last month, he admitted two charges of failing to provide
a breath test, driving without proper insurance, and driving while
banned but sentence was deferred and he was released on bail.
Four days later, the court heard, he re-appeared on similar charges
committed while on bail and was remanded in custody.
Mr Flynn admitted that Graham's criminal record stretched back 15
years with a ''substantial'' number of driving offences since 1988.
Sheriff Kieran McLernan agreed to defer sentence for two weeks for
up-to-date reports but refused bail.

THE chief executive of the Scottish Tourist Board and Scotland's
Tourism Minister yesterday stressed the need to extend the traditional
tourist season to attract more visitors north of the Border.
Speaking in Edinburgh at the seminar and annual meeting of the British
Holiday and Home Parks Association Scotland, STB chief Derek Reid said
the new Autumn Gold initiative, which aimed to bring visitors north
during October and November, appeared to be ''on the right lines''.
He stressed the need to draw visitors from other parts of the UK,
which make up 70% of the tourism total.
He said the autumn campaign, which aims to boost visitor numbers by
7%, generating an estimated #5m, is to be repeated next year. Similar
initiatives are also planned for the spring and winter of 1997.
Mr Reid revealed he hoped to see a major television marketing campaign
to attract home-grown tourists launched in Scotland next year.
However, he also stressed the need for quality in the industry and for
the training of workers.
''Improving marketing alone will not achieve the results we seek. We
need more investment in the infrastructure and more investment in
customer care and training if the marketing promises are to be
fulfilled,'' he said.
While the STB chief was confident 1995 would be the best year for
tourism in Scotland in recent years, Mr Reid said it was important to
highlight Scotland's resources.
''We are not a sun, sea, and sand destination, but we have significant
strengths. Our natural environment, our history, and our culture --
those are strengths which many countries envy but cannot aspire to,'' he
said.
Mr Reid said he would also like to see Scotland staking a claim in the
activity holiday market. ''We have the capability of being the activity
centre of Western Europe,'' he added.
Addressing delegates later, Tourism Minister George Kynoch also spoke
on the theme of all-year tourism.
''The shortness of our main tourist season has been a major weakness.
It is a weakness that is being addressed and must be tackled in the same
positive manner as the raising of quality standards,'' he said.

ECSTASY pills seized by undercover detectives in a drugs operation
were worth up to #100,000, the High Court in Glasgow heard yesterday.
The pills were alleged to have been found in a car outside the
Marriott Hotel in Glasgow.
The court has been told that one undercover detective passed himself
off as an ecstasy buyer while another posed as a ''chemist'' whose job
was to test the pills.
On trial are Mr Steven Coan, 24, Mr Brian Smith, 30, Mr James MacLean,
20, and Mr John McDonald, 26. They all deny being concerned in the
supply of ecstasy in Glasgow in July last year.
When the undercover detectives gave evidence on Wednesday they were
allowed to use false names and were shielded from public view by a
screen.
One of the undercover detectives, the court was told, claimed the
drugs had been passed to him in a car outside the hotel. Later, 5000
ecstasy pills were allegedly found in the car.
Detective Sergeant Lorraine McKay, 37, of the Strathclyde Police drug
squad told Mr Scott Brady, prosecuting, yesterday that the pills could
be bought for #4 and sold for anything between #14 and #20 each on the
streets.
The trial before Lord Weir continues.

A PUBLIC auction threatens Scotland's bid for a #100m electronics
plant which could create 1000 jobs.
Scottish Office Ministers are among those said to be furious that
delicate negotiations to bring the investment north of the border have
been leaked.
From being a front-runner, Scotland can now expect fierce competition
from elsewhere in Europe for the hi-tech plant. Until the leak, only
Spain and the North-east of England were seen as rivals.
However, the Irish Development Authority yesterday confirmed that it
would pursue Tyneside-based Interconnection Systems if it is still open
to approaches.
There are growing suspicions that the leak was aimed at ensuring the
firm would win the best possible deal in grant aid for expanding from
its South Shields base.
It is understood Interconnection has applied to the Scottish Office
for a #20m grant to site the plant in Scotland rather than in Spain --
where a grant, reputedly standing at #40m, is available.
The Scottish application for regional industrial assistance is now in
the hands of the Treasury, given its scale.
Interconnection, Britain's largest manufacturer of printed circuit
boards to the electronics industry, has also been in talks with
development bodies in the North-east where a site for the expansion has
been offered.
The firm is said to favour Spain for a plant which could become its
administrative and research headquarters.
Scottish Enterprise sources expressed surprise at such a scenario,
suggesting that Spain was not usually regarded as competitive to
Scotland if a skilled workforce was required.
Interconnection has visited a science park in Malaga, where grant aid
of at least #40m is said to be on offer via the city and its regional
government.
The firm did not comment yesterday and the Scottish Office remained
silent, arguing that it did not discuss matters involving potential
inward investments. Scottish Enterprise also refused to comment.

TWO senior Cabinet Ministers last night were involved in the strongest
attack so far by the Government on the BBC over alleged political bias.
The attack centres on the episode of the medical drama Casualty to be
screened tonight.
Both Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell and Tory chairman Brian
Mawhinney wrote to BBC Director General John Birt to register their
protest over what they claim is a misrepresentation of the effects of GP
fundholding.
The scene shows a registrar in the fictitious Holby casualty
department failing to revive a man who has suffered kidney failure in an
ambulance that has driven past two other hospitals during a 50-mile
journey.
Afterwards, the doctor learns the patient was taken to Holby because
the GP was a fund-holder in the hospital.
Mr Dorrell said in his letter to Mr Birt that he had not seen the
programmes concerned but was worried that they would misrepresent the
operation of the NHS and, in particular, the GP fundholding scheme.
He said: ''In an emergency, the status of a patient's GP is
irrelevant.
''Emergency cases are treated in all NHS hospitals without reference
either to a fundholding GP or the home health authority.
''The health authority or GP may be charged for the care given but
neither the health authority nor the GP is consulted by the hospital
before the emergency care is provided.
''Emergency care is available purely on the basis of clinical need in
every case. A patient suffering kidney failure would certainly be
treated as an emergency.''
Mr Dorrell said the BBC guidelines state ''when drama realistically
portrays living people or contemporary situations in a controversial
fashion, it has an obligation to be accurate''.
Dr Mawhinney said in his letter that he was concerned about reports
that there would be a storyline which included a ''totally misleading
and inaccurate depiction of the operation of GP fundholding''.
He said: ''I hope you will recognise the seriousness with which I view
the reported use of a very popular drama series as a vehicle for
inaccurate political propaganda.''

OVER the years I have been lucky enough to spend many memorable nights
in London's Dean Street Pizza Express listening to the best of
mainstream jazz. Nights when cornettist Ruby Braff and pianist Dick
Hyman played glorious duets; when another cornet player Warren Vache and
tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton made their British debuts back in the
late seventies; when The Blue Three of clarinettist Kenny Davern,
pianist Dick Wellstood, and drummer Jake Hanna did SRO business and when
such giants of the music as Bud Freeman, Wild Bill Davison, Ralph
Sutton, Yank Lawson, Dick Cary, Buddy Tate, Al Grey, and so many others
paraded their talents.
Now there is a Pizza Express in Glasgow's Queen Street, and after
several months of promoting local talent the management there are ready
to carry on the tradition of the London original.
On November 26, the pianist and singer Mose Allison will be the first
American star to play the Glasgow venue -- but if successful it is
likely he will be followed by others, especially as the Pizza Express
chain has plans to expand across Scotland with an Edinburgh site almost
ready to be opened.
A spokesman for the eatery says: ''We have a strong commitment to
local jazz musicians and we have been featuring pianist Sandy Taylor
with his trio on a regular basis and will be continuing to do so.
''This is the first international star for us but we intend to have
more. When musicians are playing the Dean Street restaurant then we have
the opportunity to present them in Glasgow and we will attempt to do so
on a once-a-month basis.
''The room is small but there is an intimacy which we feel suits
small-group jazz and will suit Mose Allison. We are delighted that he
will start this new venture because he is a major name in the music.''
Allison emerged in the late fifties, moving north from his Mississippi
birthplace to New York and being taken under the wing of the tenor
saxophonist Al Cohn who gave him his first gigs in the city.
However, it was when he formed his own trio and began to sing his
heavily southern songs that Allison made his real impression on the jazz
world. With Addison Farmer on bass and Paul Motian on drums he played
the Cafe Bohemia and won himself a recording contract with Prestige.
Songs like Parchman Farm guaranteed a major audience and he became an
influence on the burgeoning rock groups in both the US and here.
He has recalled: ''My songs were based on the share-cropping South
which has now disappeared. That has all gone now and they came out of
the blues and so some of the young rock musicians caught on to them. It
was good for me financially. I made more money from a recording of Young
Man Blues, which was done by The Who, than I ever made from any of my
own records. The composer royalties were amazing, especially when I
remembered that my first deal with a record company was for six albums
at 250 bucks each album.''
The tributes paid to him by Pete Townshend and others helped Allison
maintain a higher profile than most jazz musicians. He still works
regularly in New York, tours frequently, and this will be his second
visit to Britain in less than a year.
His piano playing was influenced originally by Nat ''King'' Cole just
as the work of so many of his contemporaries was. His singing is
original, obviously affected by the raw country blues of the rural south
where he grew up, but with a slow, almost talking delivery which is his
own.
Anyone who remembers the haunting Parchman Farm, his most famous song,
needn't expect to hear that from Allison at the Pizza. He stopped
performing that number 20 years ago and has resisted requests for it for
two decades.
He starts a good week for jazz in Glasgow on that Sunday evening at
the end of the month. Forty-eight hours later Warren Vache will be
appearing at the Moir Hall in concert. More on that next week . . .

John MacCalman examines how Monklandsgate accuser finds his authority
facing inquiry.
EARLIER this year, the 13 Monklands councillors who are also members
of the new North Lanarkshire Council were urged to resign from the new
authority if they had been guilty of abusing power.
The plea came from the Labour leader of North Lanarkshire, Councillor
Harry McGuigan, following the Labour Party's decision to suspend all
Monklands District Labour councillors in the light of the Black Report.
That report claimed to have uncovered a web of nepotism and spending
bias in the controversial Monklands District Council.
Mr McGuigan, who represents a Motherwell seat, applied further
pressure on his Monklands colleagues by asserting: ''Those individuals
know who they are: they should do the decent thing. They should
recognise they can no longer continue in office. They know where wrong
has been carried out.''
Now Mr McGuigan's own authority has come under intense pressure over
the ''jobs for the boys'' issue which forced the Local Government Staff
Commission to report North Lanarkshire's recruitment practices to
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who has ordered a full inquiry.
Opposition councillors have been astonished at the apparent jobs
''carve-up'', given the number of Motherwell District Council officials
who have landed top posts. They find it hard to believe there is such a
wealth of talent in Motherwell District and such a lack of it in the
remainder of the new council area: Monklands, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth,
and part of Strathkelvin.
Of the initial 10 top appointments, five went to officials of
Motherwell District Council.
At the end of September, when the full North Lanarkshire Council
debated the controversy, SNP veteran Gordon Murray cited the case of a
second-tier officer in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth's legal department who
was denied an interview by North Lanarkshire but who had subsequently
been appointed director of corporate services in Renfrewshire Council.
He admitted that often the person who got the post appeared to be the
best person on the day but his concern was about those who had not been
put before the selection panels.
Councillor Murray shared the widespread suspicion that short leets had
been stacked with no-hopers to make the preferred candidate look even
more outstanding.
The decision that astounded Scottish local government was the
appointment of 64-year-old David McKendrick, a #40,000-a-year district
manager in Strathclyde region's social work department, as the new
authority's #71,000-a-year director of social work.
The fact that Mr McKendrick is due to retire six months after the new
council assumes power next April was but one element of the controversy.
His main challenger for the job, Mr Ian Gilmour, depute director of
social work at Strathclyde region, won the backing of the public sector
union, Unison, for a complaint to the Staff Commission.
This was based on the revelation that three junior members of Mr
Gilmour's staff were members of the council appointments sub-committee.
That itself prompted the Staff Commission to issue revised guidelines
on selection panels.
Mr Gilmour has since been appointed depute social work director for
the new City of Glasgow Council.
Mr McGuigan has always insisted that the best candidate for the job
had been appointed on each occasion and has expressed confidence in the
fairness, integrity, and objectivity of the council's recruitment
procedures.
However, the fact is that a council that was so keen to make a good
start, and flush out all taint of a so-called Monklandsgate, is itself
so steeped in suspicion that the Scottish Office has felt it necessary
to institute a full inquiry.
That suspicion is shared by trade union representatives and
disgruntled council officials, not just in relation to North
Lanarkshire, but in respect of other councils in the central belt.
According to one union insider, while the existing regional and
district council had in place procedures which had safeguarded staff for
many years, these had often been set aside and not observed in the same
rigorous way by the new authorities because it suited particular
interests at that time.
However, an informed source from the ranks of officials, suggested:
''A lot of people think they should have got jobs and didn't. There's a
lot of bruised egos out there. One or two of the abuse cases are down to
bruised egos.''
Nevertheless, with the Labour Party inquiry into Monklandsgate under
way and a parallel Government inquiry about to commence, the advent of
yet another inquiry into the operations of a Labour-controlled council
must seriously erode Mr Tony Blair's efforts to push the old Labour
dinosaurs into extinction.

A MOTHER told a court yesterday a gunman had warned that a fire would
be started at her home, where she believed her young daughters were
sleeping.
Mrs Catherine Campbell, 32, told the High Court in Edinburgh that she
had telephoned her husband, Mr Joseph Campbell, 36, who had gone to get
more money during a robbery while the armed man was with her.
''I told him if he did not hurry up that the house was getting
fired,'' said Mrs Campbell
The mother-of-two was asked in court why she had told her husband
that. She replied: ''Because Brian Martin told me that was what was
going to happen.''
She was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Martin, 38, described as a
prisoner, who has denied assaulting Mrs Campbell and her bookmaker
husband, abducting them, and robbing them of #2000.
Mr Martin has also denied carrying out armed robberies at Glencraig,
in Fife, in September 1992 and at a building society in Oban in November
last year.
He has also pleaded not guilty to assaulting two police constables in
Ballingry, Fife, last October by menacing them with a sawn-off shotgun.
Mrs Campbell told the court she had been wakened early in the morning
of November 6 last year by banging at the door of her then home in
Lochleven Road, Lochore, Fife.
Her husband got up and when she went downstairs she found a man, who
she identified as Mr Martin. He was holding a gun at her husband. She
said that while they were in the house Mr Martin had struck her husband
in the face with the gun's barrels, causing him to bleed
Mrs Campbell said Mr Martin wanted money and she and her husband had
gone with him by car to get cash from a grocer's shop they ran at Martin
Crescent, in Ballingry. Their daughters, aged eight and 11, were left at
home and Mrs Campbell said she believed they were upstairs in bed.
Mrs Campbell told the court during the incident she was shaking and
crying. ''I remember saying what about the children and Brian Martin
says, 'Forget about the children'.''
She claimed Mr Martin was given money from the shop's safe but her
husband had then gone to his betting shop nearby, intending to bring
more money.
She said Mr Martin had warned her husband not to try anything and
pointed out to her husband that she was being kept in the shop.
Mrs Campbell alleged that before she made the telephone call from the
shop to her husband in the betting shop, Mr Martin had used the
telephone.
She told the court she did not know who he spoke to but claimed Mr
Martin had said that if he did not call back in five minutes ''you know
what you have got to do''.
At one stage, Mr Martin went to the back door of the shop and looked
through the shutters. He then told her to look through and she saw a
police van.
She said at this point he started to panic and shout and swear. He
went through to the front of the shop and smashed a glass panel and went
through it before running off.
Mrs Campbell said she then got out of the shop and saw police
officers. One of them grabbed her and took her to a police van where she
was joined by her husband shortly afterwards. The couple were later
reunited with their children at the police station.
Mrs Campbell said she later briefly returned to the family home and
collected some clothes and suitcases then left.
Advocate-depute James Campbell asked her if she had ever returned to
live at the house in Lochleven Road since the incident and she replied:
''No. I couldn't sleep in that house -- no way.''
The trial before Lord Gill continues.

ANGRY council leaders yesterday accused Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth of attempting to draw attention away from an important meeting
with them to discuss their financial worries, by choosing the same day
to announce the setting up of an inquiry into the actions of North
Lanarkshire Council over staff appointments.
They were convinced that the inquiry announcement had been timed to
catch the attention of the media and overshadow their forecasts of big
council tax rises and possible service cutbacks the new councils were
facing. Cosla president Rosemary McKenna said the convention did not in
any way question Mr Forsyth's right to set up such an inquiry but said
he was engaged in ''diversionary tactics''.

APPEAL court judges yesterday jailed a sex offender who originally
escaped with a deferred sentence after he attacked a woman in the
street.
The Court of Criminal Appeal agreed with the Crown that the original
sentence imposed by Sheriff Frank Lunny at Hamilton was unduly lenient.
Jailing Robert Fallan for nine months, Lord Hope, the Lord Justice
General, said deterrent sentences were necessary to protect women from
attacks of this kind.
Fallan, 31, of The Roundel, Cambusnethan, Wishaw, was found guilty of
indecently assaulting a woman in the town in September 1993. He threw
her to the ground, forced her legs apart, and handled her private parts.
When Fallan appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court in September this year,
Sheriff Lunny deferred sentence for six months with an eventual
possibility of community service.
Yesterday, Mr Iain Bonomy QC, argued that the sentence imposed was
unduly lenient, taking into account the gravity of the offence.
Mr Alan Muir, defence counsel, argued that the sentence was not unduly
lenient. It was out of character and Fallan, who was of low intellect,
had no previous convictions for violence.
Lord Hope, who heard the Crown appeal with Lords Allanbridge and
Cowie, said the victim had been unable to get a taxi after leaving a
public house and was walking home along a fairly busy street.
Fallan appeared from the opposite direction and appeared to be very
drunk as he walked past. The woman felt nervous and averted her eyes
before Fallan grabbed her from behind.
She screamed and Fallan ran off after a number of girls came to the
woman's rescue. She was extremely upset by the incident.
Lord Hope said that in the opinion of the appeal court the sentence
imposed by the sheriff could properly be described as unduly lenient.

A HIGHLAND nursing home was officially closed down yesterday after
criticism of its standards of nursing care.
The Highland Health Board formally cancelled the registration of the
15-place Carnoch Nursing Home in Fort Augustus, on the shores of Loch
Ness.
A health board manager said that the proprietors of the home -- which
had charged patients more than #300 a week -- failed to ensure a high
quality and level of professional nursing care.
Moira Paton, the board's contracts and service standards manager for
primary and community care, said the board's view was that ''this left
an unacceptable degree of risk to the residents''.
The board held a special meeting yesterday and found that the home had
failed to meet the standards laid down.
Residents were relocated in September by the board.
Yesterday the whereabouts of the proprietors, a couple, were unknown.
Recorded delivery letters have been returned and sheriff officers
failed to find them to deliver an official letter warning that
yesterday's hearing was taking place at the boards' Reay House
headquarters in Inverness.
Local district councillor Frank MacAllan, 72, said that the loss of
eight jobs at the home was ''unfortunate''.
The order cancelling the home's registration will come into effect in
14 days' time, if the proprietors do not appeal.
The health board, which says it has a duty to ensure the highest
standards of care in homes in its area, claims that its officials had
frequently discussed its concerns with the proprietors over a period of
time ''but they have not responded in a satisfactory way''.
A spokesman for the Scottish Home and Health Department said yesterday
that it was very rare for nursing homes in Scotland to be de-registered.
The Carnoch home was first registered in the late 1980s and has been
owned by the present proprietors since 1990.

THE woman known in Stirling as Big Mags Haney faces jail over an
unpaid fine.
A means inquiry court at Stirling yester-day heard that Mrs Haney, 52,
had not paid any of a #250 fine and a #100 compensation order imposed in
August.
Sheriff Robert Younger ordered her to clear the debt at #3 a week, and
told her that if she missed a single instalment, the alternative of 14
days in prison would automatically apply.
Asked whether #3 a week was realistic, Mrs Haney replied: ''Yes.''
Family solicitor Ian Angus said Mrs Haney, who appeared under her
married name of McMenamin, was in financial trouble. She receives
benefit totalling #74 a week and has a car under the Motability scheme.
He said the mother of eight ''did not keep perfect health'' and handed
in a letter from her doctor which he said indicated some of the medical
problems.
He claimed Mrs Haney had suffered from press publicity after another
Stirling sheriff -- Sheriff Norrie Stein -- criticised her family.
Sheriff Stein said the Haneys had brought misery on their community
over many years. Mrs Haney claimed Sheriff Stein had branded her
children a family from Hell.
Mr Angus told Sheriff Younger: ''Your Lordship will be aware from the
press that Mrs Haney's family has had a lot of publicity over the last
few months and Mrs Haney has had a number of financial difficulties from
which she has been unable to extricate herself. One of them is this
fine.''
The fine and compensation order were imposed after Mrs Haney was
convicted of assaulting a friend in a common close in Hope Street,
Raploch, in July 1994.
The court heard that Mrs Haney had rushed round to Hope Street from
her home in Glendevon Drive after hearing her husband James was to be
killed.
She found her friend Mary Rothwell blocking her way -- and threw
apunch which caught Mrs Rothwell on the head and injured her.

BORN in Hertford, John Martin Scripps was brought up in the East End
of London.
The son of an East End lorry driver and Fleet St barmaid, he has never
yet completed a prison sentence in a long career of burglary and heroin
trafficking.
His criminal career began when he was sentenced in 1982 to three
years' imprisonment on 40 counts of burglary. He absconded while on home
leave from prison in the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.
When sentenced in 1985 for similar offences, he again absconded while
on home leave. Two years later, in 1987, having graduated from burglary
to heroin trafficking, he was sentenced to seven years at Southwark
Crown Court, London.
In 1990, he had yet again absconded from Camphill Prison on the Isle
of Wight, returning six months later with another stash of heroin from
Bangkok.
Entering Britain under the name of Peter Bolah, one of his many
aliases, he managed to bluff his way out of a cell at Heathrow Airport
police station. However, he was arrested near his mother's house in
Sandown, on the Isle of Wight in November 1990.
In January 1992, he was sentenced to two six-year prison sentences for
heroin trafficking. However, he casually walked out of The Mount Prison,
Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, on October 30, 1994, free to kill and
apparently acting quite strangely.
Scripps' mother, Jean, said before going out to Singapore to attend
the trial: ''John's been in and out of jail all his life.
''Whoever he is now, he's the person the prison service trained him to
be.''
Mr Simon James Davis, 29, from Letchworth, Hertfordshire, whose birth
certificate Scripps appears to have used to obtain one of his false
passports, first met him in 1988.
''He kept himself to himself and when I knew him he didn't really get
into trouble.
''I can only think he was just desperate. He certainly wasn't looking
forward to his last sentence and he had a fair few years still to do.''
When Scripps ran, he is known to have renewed contacts in the drugs
trade, which stretch from Cali in Columbia, to Bangkok and Hong Kong.
Within one month, he had made his way to Mexico City, the home of his
ex-wife, Ms Maria Pilar Arellanos.
What happened in Mexico appeared to play a pivotal part in Scripps
worldwide killings. Scripps gave a clue after the Lowe killing when he
was drunk in Singapore's Raffles Hotel Long Bar.
He told a drinking companion: ''I have just spoken to my daughter on
the telephone. But she says her daddy is dead!'' Scripps has no
daughter, it was yet another lie.
The young girl to whom he was referring is Lara Beck Coid, nine, the
daughter of Police Constable Ken Coid, of the Royal Protection Squad.
Scripps eloped with Maria Pilar Arellanos when she was just 16.
While he was in jail, she divorced him and married Mr Coid, but she
went home to Mexico after just three years of marriage, fleeing with
their daughter, despite a court order preventing the child leaving the
country.
Both Maria Pilar Arellanos and John Martin Scripps are known to have
been in the resort of Cancun, on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, when
Briton Timothy MacDowall disappeared in February this year.
Scripps developed an obsessive hatred for the policeman who took his
wife and according to police colleagues tried to replace Mr Coid in her
affections.
Officers of Scotland Yard's extradition and international organised
crime squad, led by Detective Chief Inspector Geoffrey Hunt, have
interviewed Ms Pilar in Mexico City. She has been of little help in
finding out what had happened to Mr Timothy MacDowall.
Meanwhile, in Mexico City, her daughter, Lara Beck has been told
nothing of the fate of one of the two men she called daddy; one the face
of law and order, the other who became the face of terror.
Scripps now whiles away the time reading. He is rationed to just one
book a week. Among the list of 10 books he has requested are the
biographies of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

Singapore
AFTER all appeals are exhausted, tourist killer John Martin Scripps
will be sent to the gallows at Singapore's Changi Jail early next year.
He has 14 days in which to appeal against his conviction, although it
is believed he may not bother.
During his trial, he told the judge: ''If I have to die, then I have
to die.'' He even greeted today's decision nonchalantly and was earlier
seen chatting and joking with his guards.
If his defence lawyer does go ahead, the Court of Appeal will rule in
January. When that fails, Scripps's last chance is to petition the
president of Singapore for clemency to commute the death sentence to
life. When clemency is refused, prisoners are hanged within two weeks.
Executions in Singapore are carried out on Fridays and Scripps will be
given just three days' warning.
During that time, he will be allowed unlimited visits from family and
friends, as well as private visits from a Catholic priest.
After months of eating prison second-rate brown rice, he will also be
allowed to eat any food he wants.
On the Thursday night before his execution, Catholic priest Father
Eugene Vaz will stay with Scripps to take his confession and read the
last rights.
Father Eugene, who will be present at the hanging, declined to comment
when contacted in Singapore today.
Legal sources said that on the day of execution Scripps would be woken
at 5am. After showering and dressing he would be asked if he wishes to
donate his organs, while at the same time his family would arrange his
funeral.
At 6am, he will be stopped at a door leading to the death chamber.
Former prisoners say that the whole death row section of the jail echoes
to the chants of Buddhist monks and Christian priests.
The prison superintendant holds a file with a photograph to make sure
it matches the prisoner -- in the past, Chinese mafia gangs have been
known to swop prisoners at the last moment -- and a prison officer will
then place a hood over Scripps's head.
As he is pushed through the door, the noose is placed around his neck
and the platform drops almost immediately. A doctor stands ready to
pronounce death.

''Karma is karma. It's in God's hands now,'' Scripps said yesterday,
speaking through the plate-glass partition after being told that his
fate would be execution but before sentence was passed.
As Scripps is sentenced to hang Andrew Drummond looks at how he was
released from prison to murder
JOHN Martin Scripps walked through the gates of The Mount prison in
Hertfordshire in October 1994 with a permit for four days' home leave.
His mother, Jean, says she had begged the authorities not to allow him
out.
She said: ''I knew John was going to run away and I told the prison
governor. I saw him three days before he was due home leave. His hair
was long and unkempt.
''He had let himself go. I begged the prison authorities three times
not to let him out. He had sold his television and all his personal
belongings, he obviously wasn't planning to stay.''
The governor of The Mount, Ms Margaret Donnelly, says: ''He was no
longer considered a risk . . . He had no history of violence. He was
quiet and reserved.''
Scripps, 35, was about to embark on a globe-trotting trail littered
with dismembered bodies and plundered bank accounts that, a year later,
has put the fugitive model prisoner in the death cell of a Singaporean
jail.
The case has shocked detectives around the world because Scripps was
given a weekend of freedom from the The Mount prison, halfway through a
13-year sentence for drug smuggling, despite having absconded on home
leave before.
Three times between 1984 and 1994, Scripps became eligible for home
leave and on each occasion absconded on crime sprees, practising skills
he had acquired behind bars.
From dismemberment to bogus identities, from credit-card theft to the
secrets of concealing heroin about the person, 35-year-old Scripps says
he mastered all his sinister arts courtesy of HM Prison Service ''open
university''.
Scripps, who used his prison skills to bring butchery to the world's
international air routes, appeared resigned to his fate in Singapore's
Tanah Merah Prison.
''Karma is karma. It's in God's hands now,'' he said, speaking through
the plate- glass partition after being told that his fate would be
execution, but before sentence was actually passed.
The closest John Martin Scripps had ever got to remorse was a
statement from the dock in Singapore's High Court expressing sorrow for
Mrs Vanessa Lowe, the young widow of South African brewery chemical
engineer Gerard Lowe, whom he brutally beat to death in a Singapore
hotel room, the night they checked in together, and whose body he cut up
with surgical skill and disposed of in Singapore harbour.
No sorrow for Mrs Sheila Damude, 48, and her son Darin, 23, who were
butchered after checking into the same hotel -- Nilly's Marina Inn -- on
the Thai holiday island of Phuket, two weeks later.
Little to say about Mr Timothy MacDowall, 28, a Briton whose bank
account he milked of #20,000 and who went missing in Mexico in February
this year, except with a raised eyebrow: ''Who says he's dead?'' safe in
the knowledge that no body has been found.
''They've got nothing on me,'' is one sentence that rings out
throughout his life of crime, as time and time again he was sent down
for burglary and drugs sentences.
In prison though, he is said to weep frequently. Weeping for the
ex-wife whom he has begged to come and see him ''if the worst happens''.
He is kept in a bare cell, lying on a thin mattress on the floor. The
light is kept on all night and day, a closed-circuit television camera
captures his every move. He has turned to religion and is visited by
Father Eugene Vaz, a Catholic priest, who will call to give him last
rights, and witness his execution.
Father Eugene has witnessed many executions in Changi Prison,
Singapore. At the last minute, he has said, some of the most hardened
criminals crack and confess to all their crimes, seeking forgiveness.
Scripps, who is expected to be led to the gallows on a Friday in March
next year, has yet to show any signs of confessing.
He was every tourist's nightmare. A friendly passenger who struck up
harmless conversations on planes, asking advice on hotels at the point
of disembarking.
However, in his bag this particular tourist kept an arsenal of weapons
and a butcher's utensils, including an electric stun gun -- brand name Z
Force 3 -- with a 10,000 volt charge to stun his victims. There were
also hammers, used to crush his victim's skulls, and a set of knives.
Using butchery skills learned while in Albany Prison, Isle of Wight,
serving 13 years for heroin trafficking, Scripps was able to carve up
the bodies.
Scripps cut each body into 10 equal parts before disposing them in
black plastic rubbish bags.
Sitting in a glass cage in court in Singapore, he could not help
displaying some pride in his skills as a butcher, describing how his
knives were sufficient for the job in hand.
However, throughout his month-long trial, as evidence piled up against
him, the blood of the victims on his weapons, the victims belongings in
his suitcase, Scripps denied everything, except the killing of Mr Lowe,
because Mr Lowe had made a homosexual advance.
Judge T S Sinnathuray yesterday described his evidence as ''layers and
layers of lies''. A typical lie was how he explained a piece of paper
found on him on which he had clearly been practising how to copy the
signature of Mrs Sheila Damude, presumably to forge her credit card
slip.
''A friend made me do it,'' he said, ''I did it to show him that I was
no good at copying signatures. But actually I did it quite well didn't
I. I must have been drunk.''
As Singapore deals with a criminal no British prison could contain,
two questions are being asked about the tourist killer.
Why was Scripps released from prison, despite his mother's pleas to
keep him in? And did his unreturned love for the wife who ran off with
an officer of the Queen's Royal Protection Squad set off his killing
spree?

Brussels
LABOUR and the SNP were locked in dispute last night over the future
make-up of Scotland's European Parliamentary constituencies after Labour
made its own substantial proposals for boundary changes.
Mrs Winnie Ewing, SNP president and Euro-MP for Highlands and Islands,
accused Labour of an ''anti-democratic exercise of political
gerrymandering'' in suggesting that Argyll and Bute should be taken from
her constituency and put into a new West of Scotland seat.
Her SNP colleague in the Strasbourg assembly, Dr Allan Macartney, who
gained North East Scotland from Labour in last year's Euro-elections,
described Labour's proposals as ''outrageous'' because they involved
removing Banff and Buchan, held in Westminster by SNP leader Alex
Salmond, and putting it into a new North of Scotland seat which would
replace the abolished Highlands and Islands.
A Labour Party spokesman responded: ''This seems yet another
over-reaction by the SNP. We have offered a perfectly sensible set of
proposals to make slight amendments to the European boundaries so that
they better reflect the public's idea of the distribution of their home
areas.
''How on earth can Mrs Ewing see common sense in people in Argyll
being in the same constituency as people in Shetland?''
Other political parties have made only minor submissions affecting the
seats, which are made up of groups of Westminster constituencies and are
being redrawn to reflect demographic change.
The Boundaries Commission for Scotland announced yesterday its
proposed changes would be examined by a public inquiry to be held in two
stages in Glasgow and Aberdeen in December. It will be conducted by
Sheriff Principal R G Hay.
Changes to six of the eight seats are wanted by the Commission. Those
excepted are South of Scotland and Lothians, both held by Labour.
The Commission's proposals appear, on paper, to endanger Labour's hold
on Mid Scotland and Fife, where veteran left-winger Alex Falconer, a
former Rosyth shop steward, is vulnerable to a 7.5% swing to the SNP.
The nationalists are also eyeing the proposed new make-up of
Strathclyde West where, with no boundary change, they would need a swing
of only 6.4% to oust Labour's Hugh McMahon.

FORMER Minister Sir Nicholas Scott last night won a dramatic victory
for the nomination to fight the new Conservative seat of Kensington and
Chelsea, London.
He beat off a challenge from two other former Ministers, Mr Michael
Fallon and Mr John Maples, who lost their seats in the 1992 General
Election.
Sir Nicholas won the nomination in the third ballot involving almost
600 local Tories.
Sir Nicholas, 62, who still faces a drink-drive charge, emerged from
the selection meeting to applause from his supporters.
He said: ''I am delighted and greatly honoured by the confidence that
the association has put in me and I will be looking forward to the next
Parliament with great relish.''
Sir Nicholas, MP for Chelsea, was fighting for nomination of a new
constituency created by boundary changes, and said he believed his
victory would unite the two associations.
He said the issue of the criminal charges arising out of the car
accident in June had been raised but that he had ''explained the
situation''.
Sir Nicholas also dismissed rumours that the Conservative leadership
wanted him to stand down after the next election to make way for Hong
King governor Chris Patten as ''rubbish''.
Many members appeared pleased Sir Nicholas had won the nomination
despite rumours the drink-driving charge had finished his career.

At Glasgow's prime breeding ground for young boxers, John Linklater
finds out that the sport continues to be a magnet to boys who prefer to
fight in the ring than on the streets
BOXING gyms have a timeless quality. The stairs that 10-year-old
Stewart Little climbs, past posters for former bouts pasted on
unglamorous brown painted walls, lead up to double doors that open on to
a world that cannot have changed in generations. The heavy punchbag
looks like a veteran of the methodical attention of a thousand rigorous
training sessions. Beyond it is the sparring ring, the mats, the
speedball and the floor-to-ceiling ball, in a spread of apparatus that
testifies to the tradition of a familiar circuit. There is a curious
feeling of security here.
Stewart does not need the protection of his older brother Peter as he
arrives, though they enter together and prepare to start their separate
routines. In the mirror, as he shadow boxes, Stewart has the reassurance
of being able to check that Peter is close by, skipping rope, but he
looks too absorbed to permit more wandering of his attention. Which is
strange in a way, because the place is full of stars of the Scottish
boxing scene. Stewart has only been coming here for a few weeks, yet
already he seems to have grown accustomed to the idea that he is sharing
this gym with professionals among whom there are several title holders
and a reigning world champion.
At the door Paul Weir is discussing the day's training with co-trainer
Benny King and manager Tommy Gilmour. It has been an important stage in
the run-up to his November 18 date at the Kelvin Hall arena with South
Africa's Baby Jake Matela to defend his WBO light flyweight world title.
This has been his first sparring session towards that fight, his first
time in the ring since a successful title defence in July. Neither has
the gym's sparring ring been reserved exclusively for Paul Weir. Davie
McHale was in for a few rounds, rotating with two of the stable's other
boxers, and Willie ''The Mighty'' Quinn has got through some useful work
with new cruiserweight professional Colin Brown.
It is difficult to imagine any other sport in which complete novices
and juniors would be training alongside top professionals preparing for
big events that will have a crucial bearing on their future careers. In
the aftermath of tragedies that have rocked boxing, it is instructive to
witness the sport returning to its own bondings based on equality,
respect and caring that would perplex those who see in it only violence,
primal aggression and senseless brutality. Boxing is a close-knit
family.
The last time I visited the Glasgow Transport Amateur Boxing Club, off
London Road in the East End of Glasgow, it was Mr Archie Docherty who
was here watching his sons Drew and Wilson training for fights. This
time it is Mr Tommy Quinn who is the paternal presence, as his boys
Willie and young Tommy work out. His sympathy is with another father who
watched his son develop in the gyms to become the fighter James Murray,
a name not far from the continuing sympathies of a Scottish boxing world
that has only now emerged from its period of grieving.
''I was crying in the house after James Murray died, because I knew
exactly what the Murray family must be going through,'' says Mr Quinn.
''But they are better in here than shooting up their arms in the
streets. I thought the world of Mr Ken Murray for saying that. He showed
a lot of courage and dignity.
''Touch wood, but if one of Willie or Tommy got put out tomorrow, the
other would still be here. Because this is their life. It would knock
the stuffing out of me and their mother, but life would go on. The other
would carry on to make a success for the one who wouldn't be here.''
Those that remain scathing that it should always appear to be
presented as a choice between boxing or the streets are simply unwilling
to face social realities. The Quinn family come from Tranent in East
Lothian. The boxers' grandfather worked in the Chesterhall Mine in
Tranent until it closed in the mid-1960s, and in recent decades
crippling unemployment has dictated that previous famous sons of the
town are exclusively sportsmen, sprinters such as George McNeill and
Wilson Young, boxers such as Billy O'Shea and footballers such as Neil
Martin. As the Quinns leave every afternoon to drive across Central
Scotland to the Glasgow gym, they can see the youth of Tranent standing
aimlessly on the street corners.
''I wouldn't have my family brought up to that,'' says Mr Quinn.
''Boxing is a good discipline.'' Most boxers could have chosen another
area of professional sport. It would be rare for them to excel in only
one sphere, representing as they do a very high level of athletic
excellence. The risks might be a degree greater, even if the statistics
for other sports provide higher fatality rates. The pain thresholds of
boxing might be more intimidating for the majority, and its financial
rewards for the majority are far less secure than other areas of
professional team sports, but its appeal to the individualist is as
potent as it can be exacting. It is the ultimate loner's sport, which
might make a paradox of the visible camaraderie among its practitioners.
You see it in small gestures in the gym. At the end of a sparring
round Davie McHale retires to his corner and there he is met by Paul
Weir, spontaneously acting as a second to offer him water from a bottle.
Earlier in the day, at Tommy Gilmour's office for the St Andrew's
Sporting Club at the Trust Forte Hotel, McHale had arrived to pick up
Paul Weir and take him to Ross Hall Hospital for his routine brain scan
prior to the upcoming title fight. McHale arrived with his baby daughter
Dominique along with a plastic bag containing nappies and another bottle
ready to be administered. This time it was Dominique's milk.
It is not the image of professional boxers, a singular breed who
suffer more than most from shallow stereotyping. In the gym they
discover a great equaliser among professionals and amateurs, current
fighters and old pros, novices and juniors. Some are here just to keep
fit. Some are in training for other sports. Quite a few will never enter
a ring in their lives, and certainly will be under no pressure from
anyone to do so. There is no showiness or posing, no sniggering or envy.
The most threatening element in this environment is the Trance Dance
rave music blaring from Paul Weir's compact disc player.
As the sparring continues a dozen skipping ropes rotate in their
separate rhythms and all eyes are fixed on what is happening in the
ring. It conjures up a bizarre thought. What if the audience at some of
the boxing shows were invited to view the fighters in the same strenuous
way? Few would last a three-minute round, and the indignity of their
scuffles, trippings and wheezings might lend a new humility.
''I just feel as if I'm the head of the family,'' says Tommy Gilmour,
who inherited a management and promotion business run by his late father
from foundations laid by his grandfather. ''My wife Veronica works in
the office with me. She, in a lot of ways, controls me. She's there, but
when we're coming up for the shows for the St Andrews Sporting Club, and
we've got table plans and cards to do, my daughter Stephanie is in and
my son Chris is there on the night to control operations.''
He admits he found himself responding like a mother hen over the brood
when the Murray tragedy struck. Helping boxers to find their feet,
literally, is the first thing that happens when a new pro is brought to
the gym as a recruit to the Gilmour stable. They work on balance and
stance, the foundation that will allow a boxer to evade a punch. It can
be like ballroom dancing, an investigation into the posture that will
allow a boxer to swivel and tilt to safety. This, contrary to
assumption, is the absolute basis of boxing, rather than the ability to
throw and connect a heavy punch. It is the fundamental that is taught
through every level, and reinforced and reassessed at every stage of
even an advanced career.
For Tommy Gilmour the timing is unfortunate of the British Boxing
Board of Control's latest 12-point safety plan, from proposals made by
an independent panel of neurosurgeons, neurologists and
neuroradiologists. It might have looked opportune to announce within
weeks of the James Murray tragedy, but most of the recommendations had
already been received, welcomed and adopted by Gilmour and by the vast
majority of responsible managers within British boxing. ''It came at the
end of a tragedy,'' he says. ''That is bad. People don't realise that
we've been working on this for months. If the tragedy had not happened,
and we brought this out, people would have said at least boxing is
trying. Those who want to condemn the sport of boxing will now see this
as just an appeasement. And that's not what it is.''
The plan is just part of a continuing process of tightening safety
procedures for the sport. Training methods may have remained
substantially the same, the atmosphere of the gym cannot be altered, and
the three-minute clock on the wall counts rounds in an unbreakable
cycle. But the medical back-up for professional boxers has moved forward
at every stage. ''Going away back to my grandfather's time, I don't know
if there were any doctors at ringside,'' says Tommy Gilmour. ''There
might have been one doctor to say, 'Aye, you're breathing.' I don't
know. Even from my own early days, and I'm 43, holding a professional
licence since I was 18, I've seen how much they've moved.''
There is still no room for complacency. ''I'm not a brain surgeon or a
doctor,'' says Tommy Gilmour. ''If somebody can teach me a bit more,
then I want my boxers, the ones I'm looking after, to be as safe as
possible. If I can make them as safe as possible, others will follow
suit.''
Blondie McEwan, who is the president of the club, had his first
professional fight at Madison Square Garden in 1959 and went trough
another 16 in the United States without defeat before retiring with hand
injuries. His amateur career, as a boy from Blackhill, began in this
very same gym.
''In my time we didn't have much medical support,'' he recalls.
''You'd walk into that dressing room over there and a doctor would stand
over you with his stethoscope. He would check your chest, and that was
it. He would look at your eyes and hands and tell you to go ahead. We
were quite happy. We just wanted to fight.''
Any youngster coming in today will receive a much stricter
registration and medical examination before being allowed to lift so
much as a skipping rope. Peter Weir, secretary of the club and the
Western District ABA, reports that around 50 children from age 12-years
upwards were registering for the start of the season in the gym the
previous weekend. ''What do they want us to do with these boys?'' he
asks. ''Do they want us to chip them out on the street? You're talking
about hundreds of boys. I think they'd be a lot safer under our tuition
than out on the street these days. There's not enough boxing clubs as
far as I'm concerned.''
''We're a family,'' says Tommy Gilmour, and it is a point that is
emphasised by the presence of youngsters in the gym. ''It is not just me
and Veronica and the boys I've got, but all the other fighters. It's not
been a closing of ranks, but a case of people starting to comfort one
another. There's always someone there with a word of compassion or
wisdom. The terrible tragedy is that we've had deaths in boxing, but
there will be another one. Because accidents do happen. All we can do at
present is to make sure we have covered every possible avenue to make
life as safe and as bearable as possible.''
And when a 10-year-old boy such as Stewart Little comes into the gym,
introduced by his older brother, they ensure that he is registered,
medically checked and supervised. He is watched over by the old pros
like Blondie McEwan and the stalwarts of the amateur game like Peter
Weir. There will be other models there for him to emulate, but they are
of discipline and behaviour as much as of boxing prowess. The cordon of
trust and respect, which seems essential to the way this gym operates,
will not be allowed to exclude him.
Under his fringe two eyes shine when you ask if he is enjoying the
experience. He is six stone, two pounds, he tells you, a potential
middleweight. When he puts on the gloves it is to take a turn with
punching into the pads rather than into anyone's body or head.
''He knew I do boxing so I brought him up one week and he loves it,''
says brother Peter. ''He comes up every Wednesday, does his football on
a Monday and karate on a Friday. It's up to him. We'll see how it goes.
It's keeping him out of trouble, anyway.''

A LOW-FLYING RAF Tornado jet which crashed killing its two-man crew
may have been brought down by the pilot's startled reaction to a bird, a
report said yesterday.
Although the cause of the crash could not be established for certain,
avoiding a sudden hazard was the most plausible, investigators
concluded.
''The (accident inquiry) board could not discount the possibility that
a bird crossed the aircraft's flightpath, causing the pilot to take
sudden evasive action,'' said the military aircraft accident summary
report.
The ground-reconnaissance Tornado from RAF Marham in Norfolk was on a
routine low-level training sortie over Scotland when the tragedy
happened on September 1 last year.
Flying at 500ft and at a speed of 428 knots, the aircraft was making a
banked turn to the right, following the line of a valley at Glen Ogle,
Perthshire.
Three seconds before the impact, the pilot applied power, pulled the
control stick back and started a turn to the right -- all actions
consistent with an avoiding manoeuvre, said the report.
The plane flipped right over, then its left wingtip hit the ground.
Neither the pilot nor navigator made any attempt to eject and both
were killed on impact.
Although investigators studied its voice and accident data recorders,
they could not determine the exact cause.
Of the three possibilities -- a control problem, a medical problem, or
sudden hazard avoidance -- the third was the most likely, said the
report.

THE number of people who lost their lives in fires dropped to its
lowest level in Scotland for 30 years, it was disclosed yesterday.
Nevertheless, HMChief Inspector of Fire Services, Mr Neil Morrison,
said: ''One fire death is one too many.''
A total of 87 were killed in fires during the last year, 81 in house
fires. He said this underlined the need for smoke alarms.
Mr Morrison, speaking in Edinburgh yesterday at the launch of his
annual report, said in 72 cases where fatal fires occurred, 45 had been
fitted with the alarm, but pointed out they were working in only 17
cases.
He urged those with alarms, estimated to be fitted in 80% of homes, to
be regularly checked.
Scottish fire brigades responded to 113,074 emergency calls last year,
a reduction of 3.3% on the previous year, attending an average of 195
outbreaks each day.
Some 2128 people were also rescued from emergency situations.
Mr Morrison said he was encouraged by a 41% reduction in malicious
calls.
One disappointment was that despite advertising for vacancies in the
fire service as an equal opportunities employer, ethnic minorities and
women were not coming forward.

Clare Trodden discovers sanctuary in Baracoa after an arduous car
journey
THINGS were getting desperate -- food, drink, and time were running
out. We had to act now. I knew my part in the drama. Straight to the
departures desk at Stanstead. ''Fly me to Cuba,'' I demanded. They
complied, almost 13 hours later. Delays, though not usually so long, are
to be expected in Cuba. Something is sure to break down or fail to turn
up. It's not only the manana mentality -- it's more the fact that the
country is in crisis.
Last year the sugar cane harvest fell three million tonnes short of
the crucial eight-million tonne mark. This, coupled to the loss of their
lucrative links with the former Soviet Union, has hit the failing
economy hard. The USA blockade has added further insult and injury.
Everything is in short supply; food, clothes, and fuel are rationed.
Efforts are being made to exploit the island's many natural resources.
However, the pay-off from projects such as exploratory mining is likely
to be a long way off. The pay-off from visitors is more tangible, hence
the reason for Castro's own sustained tourism offensive.
The effort has been stepped up with changes in the structure of the
industry. Last year, the state tourism body was split into various
groups to allow for more diversity and competition within Cuba. Tourism
is recognised as the way forward by many Cubans -- particularly as
working in the industry is the best way to get direct access to dollars.
Frank Chaviano Diaz has forsaken his career in electrical engineering
to retrain in the tourist trade. He now runs the Costa Sur hotel complex
outside Trinidad. ''Developments in other areas are very limited.
Tourism is the way forward. I don't have any regrets.'' It's easy to see
why as you gaze from his window out over the green sea and shell beaches
deserted but for a few pleasure seekers.
These beaches are a world away from Havana. But then they're not like
anywhere else in Cuba. In fact, it seems that none of Cuba's regions
duplicates any other. This is great for travellers. Each of Cuba's
regions is an experience in itself.
Pinar del Rio boasts such incredible caves and rock formations that it
is the basis of national studies into the historical development of the
island. Spas offering sulphur baths, mineral-rich mud treatments, and
herbal remedies abound in this centre of eco-tourism.
In stark contrast, the resort of Varadero, in Matanzas province, is a
brash resort (albeit with a very up-market section at one end of its
20km beach). It heaves with disco bars and jineteras (prostitutes). This
is an in-your-face sort of place. It seems as if everyone here is on the
make, one way or another, and demands for dollars are greater than
almost anywhere else, apart from Havana.
It's easy to see why people want and need dollars, and it's easy
imagine that this is all Cubans are interested in. It's not. There are
as many different types of people here as in any country, and probably
even more.
Cuba is a melting pot of colours -- Haitian, French, Spanish, and
those from the other Carribbean islands have all left their marks on
music, skin colour, and culture.
''Almost everyone is mulatto in one way or another. If they're not
they're probably just missing out a generation,'' explained Gina, our
guide in Santiago. ''My grandmother is black. I'm mulatto. My son is
white. There are very few families which don't have a range of colours.
I don't think that there are many problems with it.''
Gina has worked as a guide in various parts of Cuba but now takes
everyone she can to her own favourite part. However, despite its many
charms, not too many tourists make it to Baracoa. I found out why.
THE road to Baracoa was paved with the best of intentions, ably
assisted by an engineering miracle which gave the town its first surface
link with the rest of Cuba via Guantanamo.
Until the early sixties, access to Baracoa was by sea; the newly
created La Farola offered more direct links to hospital, university, and
to trade and tourism. Mindful of such important facts, this tourist felt
just a tad ungrateful -- but lurching around La Farola's 200-odd bends
in a taxi is guaranteed to make you wish the damned road had never been
built.
The road is one of the ''four lies of Baracoa'' -- La Farola means
lighthouse, yet it is not lit. Thankfully, this journey is being
undertaken by daylight. By way of compensation, there are wonderful
views along the road, and Baracoa itself will make you forget the
hellish journey.
The town is clustered around a bay surrounded by mountains -- the
Sleeping Woman and the Anvil or Yunque (another two of those lies) --
which were what caught Christopher Columbus's eye when he landed in the
bay in 1492.
Initially, he thought he'd found China, but soon realised it was
paradise. He waxed lyrical about the fruits, flowers, and wildlife --
but seems to have overlooked the mosquitos which are monstrous.
Outside the church there is a reminder of the fate of those who
crossed the incoming Christians. A statue in the square (and the
eponymous Cuban beer) commemorate Hatauey, a rightly rebellious Indian
chief who was burnt at the stake by marauding Spaniards. A priest's
offer of baptism and eternal salvation was declined; if the Spanish
Christians were to populate haven, Hatauey wanted to take his chances
with eternal damnation.
There are less aggressive architectural and cultural Spanish and
French-Haitian influences dating from the eighteenth century. More
recent influences on this old colonial town have come from Russia in the
form of La Rusa, a relative of the czar who fled her home country to
escape the rise of socialism.
Only a few years after her arrival in Baracoa, she was to embrace not
only the Cuban brand of socialism but also its charismatic leader. Fidel
Castro was a frequent visitor, whom she often referred to as hijo, her
son.
She became a part of the revolutionary movement in Cuba and her legacy
of welfare and education are fondly remembered in the town of around
80,000 citizens.
Her house is now a hotel and can be seen from the vantage point of El
Castillo, the former fort above the town which is itself now a hotel.
The Castillo and the Sancto Spiritus hotel are both quiet. This unspoilt
town is still off the beaten track for most tourists and you get the
impression the staff can almost remember previous guests by name.
Sadly, it seems few people are able to sample the delights of forest
trails, canoeing, or picnicking on nearby coconuts and mangoes on one of
the most beautiful and deserted beaches. By the beach in the farmers'
homes that seem to have grown from the vegetation which surrounds them
are those who live off the land and the sea in ways they have done for
centuries.
Life is lived at a slow pace here and it's not surprising those
visitors who do make it here tend to want to stay. Some even refuse to
leave. ''I bring people here for one or two days, then they don't want
to leave when the time is up,'' explains Gina, our guide. ''Every time I
bring people here I know there will be problems. They want to stay but I
have to get them back on return flights. I understand though. This is my
favourite place in the whole of Cuba.''
Those who must leave can take solace in the legend that a dip in the
river (the fourth lie - the miele river is not honey) will ensure your
return.
I'd like to believe a return trip might be possible -- but the next
time it would have to be by air and not along the road from hell.

A SCHOOL community turned out yesterday to offer tribute to those
killed during the First World War, and to remember two teenage pupils
who died in recent weeks.
On a crisp, winter morning, 1000 pupils from Glasgow Academy stood
under the trees at the wall of their playground and lined Colebrooke
Street outside the school to observe the laying of wreaths at the
academy cenotaph.
Filing past the rows of navy blazers, each dotted with a red poppy,
rector David Comins and chief governor William Mann led a procession to
the memorial. Boys and girls from the school military volunteer corps
provided a guard of honour.
The ceremony was held as part of the school's 150th anniversary
celebrations and was followed by an academicals' dinner last night.
During the ceremony, thoughts turned to two pupils, Mark Scott, 16,
and Andrew Reid, 18, who died during the current term.
Mark died after he was stabbed in London Road, Glasgow, last month
while walking home after attending a Celtic game. Andrew, who left the
academy in the summer, died after suffering a diabetic attack less than
a month into his first term at university.
Mr Malcolm McNaught, an English teacher at the school, said: ''It was
a significant display from all the pupils. They are as much a living
memorial to those who died as the school buildings themselves.''
Head girl Rosaria Crolla, 17, said: ''Pupils lower down the school,
who aren't yet fully aware of what the war meant, will have remembered
the ones we lost recently.''

A TELEVISION documentary about the Beatles could generate receipts of
#300m, it was disclosed yesterday.
According to ITV, the ''rockumentary'' could rekindle sixties
Beatlemania -- and fuel sales of re-issued albums and a Christmas single
by the band.
A spokesman said: ''This will make at least #300m and will be huge.''
The three surviving Beatles -- Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George
Harrison -- will all take part in the documentary.
The fourth member, John Lennon, died in 1980 when he was shot outside
his New York apartment building by a ''fan'' who had just asked for an
autograph.
The first episode shows Decca Records chief Dick Rowe recalling how he
told Beatles manager Brian Epstein that the band would never make it.
''Guitar groups are on the way out,'' said Mr Rowe. The Fab Four then
went off to EMI to meet George Martin, who produced all their hits in
the most successful partnership the music business has yetseen.
The series will start later this month. It traces the lives of the
band members from their childhoods on Merseyside to the start of their
success in The Cavern Club and a spell in Hamburg in the early 1960s.

<HEADLINE>Borders to lose 56 jobs with creamery closure</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish Pride milk operations at Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire are
to close in March with the loss of 56 jobs. The creamery, which is the
headquarters for milk distribution in the South of Scotland, is one of
the main employers in the area.
It has also been revealed that Scottish Pride is to open a depot in
Carlisle early next year that will employ 31 people, although no site
has yet been announced.
Transport and General Workers Union organiser Hugh Wilson said the
Lochmaben workforce was shattered by the news when it was broken to them
yesterday morning.
The company said the closure had been brought about by the large-scale
rationalisation in the milk industry following deregulation a year ago.
Scottish Pride chief executive Jim Hosea said the decision to close
Lochmaben Creamery had been an extremely difficult one for the company
but was made inevitable.
He said the Lochmaben liquid milk production was being transferred to
plants in Govan and Rutherglen, from where it would directly serve
customers in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
Mr Wilson said his members were disappointed, angry, and emotive over
the decision to close Lochmaben.
He said a meeting was planned for Wednesday with the company and
added: ''If we can't get the decsion reversed we will be trying to get
the best terms for the workers. We will also be seeking redeployment for
as many workers as we can to the new depot to be opened at Carlisle and
also to other plants, including Kirkcudbright.
''I will also be seeking reassurances that the other plants are safe
for the future,'' he added.
Mr Hosea said they would take every step to redeploy as many of the
workforce as possible and that talks would be held with the unions and
staff to try to find alternative employment.
Scottish Pride says it has invested around #5m in more efficent
production processes, redeveloping and reorganising product areas such
as UHT milk, cheese, and butter and in plastic to meet the
ever-increasing demand for plastic bottles.
This included, said Mr Hosea, #1.5m for a second high-speed plastic
bottling line to come into operation at Govan later this month.
It has also purchased a Rothesay cheese plant from Highland and
Islands Enterprise, which it says is further evidence of its continuing
commitment to the island creameries which are playing key roles in the
imminent launch of the new range of Scottish Pride cheeses.
Mr Hosea added: ''We will deploy as many staff as possible and do
everything we can to assist staff facing redundancy in finding
alternative employment.''
In a letter to Scottish Pride shareholders, Lord Sanderson, the
chairman, said there had been large-scale rationalisation in the dairy
industry and it was continuing across the country.
Dumfries MP Sir Hector Monro said he was extremely disappointed by the
news, which he said had been caused by the change in shopping habits and
the advance of supermarkets.

Catherine Brown finds that the Italian staple is always primo
I HADN'T given much thought to the reason why some dried pasta costs
so much more than others. But are there specific distinctions in the
quality which makes one brand worth eight times the cost of another? And
what about the cachet attached to fresh pasta? Is the packaged and
chilled fresh pasta, to be found on supermarket shelves, worth its
premium price?
The pasta which set me wondering if we are getting the best deal had
been made by Riccardo Isolini, a Tuscan working in London as a chef. He
had been invited to Glasgow to cook a Tuscan feast at Fratelli Sarti's
new basement restaurant and bar for a tasting of Castello Banfi wines.
As we arrived, Isolini and his commis were bent over a tray of jumbled
strips of misshapen pasta fresca, tossing them about in flour. The dough
had been freshly-made earlier and roughly cut into a rustic pasta shape,
maltagliati: not properly cut. There was a big pot of tomato sauce
bubbling on the stove which he had made by frying onions and chopped
Italian smoked bacon in olive-oil, adding some dry white wine, rosemary,
tinned tomatoes, and salt and pepper. Enticing aromas.
As the tasters begin their antipasto, Isolini starts to cook the pasta
scraps. Then he coats them very lightly in the tomato sauce, enough to
flavour only, carefully tossing six portions at a time. The dominating
taste experience comes from the bounce and good flavour of fresh pasta.
The sauce is the condiment. The pasta is primo.
To display such pasta skills, the pasta expert is entitled to judge
others. So what does he think of the pre-pack chilled, costing a great
deal more than a packet of everyday dried? Is it worth it? ''Well, of
course it's faster to cook, and produces a softer texture, but otherwise
it's really no better than pasta secca (dried). I wouldn't buy it.''
This is industrial ''fresh'' pasta which has been pasteurised and
pressed through smooth tubes, making a very smooth surface. Unlike pasta
fresca, it lacks a rough porous surface to catch and hold the sauce.
Isolini also thinks some of the colours unnatural. Like frozen prawns,
plant bread, and phosphate-injected bacon, the price we pay also
includes added water.
Outside London there are very few delis who make and sell their own
fresh unpasteurised pasta, but in Edinburgh at Maurizio Meoni's Gourmet
Pasta shops (54 Morningside Road and 26 Raeburn Place) there is a wide
range of unfilled and filled speciality pasta (#2.04 per 500g basic
shapes, unfilled).
On to pasta secca then. What does the expert think about prices
ranging from a supermarket ''saver'' at 25p to a connoisseurs' pasta at
#2.15 for 500g? Which is the best? His choice is De Checco, a reasonable
70p for 500g. It's got a good flavour, holds the sauce well and won't
collapse into a heap of gummy rubber if it's kept waiting or overcooked
a little.
At Sarti's deli department upstairs they stock a range of pasta secca
made in Italy -- including the favourite De Checco -- and Sandro Sarti
fills a poly bag of several brands for me to take away for more
pasta-investigating.
There's a rustic brown paper bag of Rustichella d'Abruzzo which he
describes as the Rolls Royce of the pasta secca market (#1.60 per 550g).
It's been made in the Abruzzo mountains with spring water by Italian
artisan pasta makers who continue, for the sake of maintaining the
flavour and texture of pasta secca, with the old methods.
Some have been encouraged by farmers who are interested in growing a
better flavoured durum wheat (semola di grano duro) which produces a
firmer finished product than soft wheat flours. Some pasta-makers,
however, may use a mixture of durum with soft wheat flour -- the mix
used for the cheapo supermarket saver which tasted like gummy rubber.
After resisting EC legislation which permitted imports of such pasta
into Italy, the removal of trade barriers in 1992 has meant that Italy
can no longer say that all pasta sold in the country is made with the
correct flour.
But in addition to using the best durum flour, the artisan pasta
makers also continue to force the dough through trafile di bronzo, the
old-style brass drawplates, whose unlined slots give the pasta a rough
porous surface which absorbs sauces better than industrial types pressed
through smooth Teflon slots.
The final distinction, which makes this pasta different, is the way it
is dried. First the incartamento, when it's blown by warm, dry air for
about 10 minutes to firm it up.
Then it goes into ventilated shafts for up to 40-45 hours. A slow,
cool-air drying method which preserves the flavour and aroma. Fast, hot,
steamy, drying of industrial pasta secca may take anything from two to
four hours, producing a very brittle pasta which lacks flavour.

* PLENTY of pollen and nectar on this season's heather has given
beekeepers an above average supply of pure heather honey.
''We were lucky this year,'' says beekeeper Hamish Robertson, of
Struan Apiaries, ''to have the heat during the day, and a colder night.
It meant that enough moisture went into the plants to make nectar.''
This speciality honey from ling heather can be distinguished from
others by its jelly-like (thixotropic) set. It has also lost none of its
distinctive flavour, and nutritive value, by being heat-treated or
blended with other honeys.
Struan Apiaries provide a mail order and gift service, they also sell
direct (1lb jar: #3) from the honey shed at: Burnside Lane, Connon
Bridge, Ross-shire IV7 8EX (tel: 01349 861427).

''HERE lies the gentle, sweet man Nigeria loved to cheat. They denied
him even in death the normal six feet of earth.''
This is the epitaph Ken Saro-Wiwa left for himself in his last public
words before his hanging.
In an interview with the Guardian newspaper in Lagos, Mr Saro-Wiwa
said that he would like to die ''in bed, dreaming''.
He went on to pour scorn on the military tribunal that condemned him:
''After all your judgment, convicting me is a mere formality.
''In the course of the trial, I have been brutalised, my family almost
ruined. I am a man of ideas in and out of prison -- my ideas will
live.''
When asked what his regret in life was, he said: ''My only regret is
that I was ever born a minority in Nigeria.''

KEN Saro-Wiwa's tireless campaign for his people's rights won him a
Nobel peace prize nomination and cost him his life.
The Eton-educated author had a varied career as a teacher, trader,
property developer, and a Nigerian state government minister.
A prolific novelist and playwright, he also created the country's main
television soap opera, Basi and Company.
He will be remembered, though, as the man who took on Nigeria's
military government and Shell in a fight to secure for the impoverished
Ogoni minority people a share of the vast oil wealth earned on their
lands.
His status was reflected in the list of distinguished names who
campaigned against his execution.
Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka and South African author Nadine
Gordimer, both Nobel-prize winners, and a host of Commonwealth leaders,
added their voices to human rights groups.
Mr Saro-Wiwa was fiercely critical of Nigeria's federal system, which
ignores the rights of minorities like the Ogoni, who account for just
500,000 of the country's nearly 100 million inhabitants.
Ninety percent of the country's oil wealth lies below the Niger delta
where the Ogoni live but the small fishing and farming villages are
impoverished and their land and waterways have been despoiled by the oil
industry.
Mr Saro-Wiwa left his home in the heart of Surrey and returned to his
homeland in 1990 to help found the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni
People (Mosop).
It declared the region autonomous and demanded billions of dollars in
compensation from the government and Shell, which extracts about 40% of
Nigeria's oil.
Protests were met with savage repression and 200 Ogoni are said to
have been murdered by Nigerian security forces.
Shell pulled out of the area in 1993 after attacks on its
installations.
In a message to his people, smuggled out of jail at New Year, Mr
Saro-Wiwa said: ''Ogoni is a plain of agony, the disgrace of the
Nigerian military . . . a people, no matter how few, who are aware of
their rights and determined to reclaim them in a non-violent manner,
cannot be crushed by military might.
''Ogoni is on the map of the world . . .
''Dance your anger and your joys; dance the military guns to silence;
dance their dumb laws to the dump; dance oppression and injustice to
death; dance the end of Shell's ecological war of 30 years.
''As the power of our truth finds wing and spreads over Nigeria, the
oppressors shall flee . . . and a new, restructured Nigeria shall
emerge, wherein every ethnic group shall be allowed to develop at its
own pace, using its intellectual and material resources.
''Ogoni is the plain of hope.''
Mr Saro-Wiwa, 54, had been imprisoned since May last year for
allegedly inciting his followers to murder four moderate Ogoni leaders,
and had complained of being held in chains, starved, and subjected to
''dehumanising treatment and mental torture''.
In a letter written in his cell six months ago, he made it clear he
knew his campaign would end with imprisonment and death.
''This knowledge has given me strength, courage, and cheer -- and
psychological advantage over my tormentors,'' he wrote.
Those tormentors hold power over what was once the great hope in
post-colonial Africa. Now, though, Nigeria suffers one of the most
brutal and ruthless dictatorships in the world.
The failure of the country to convert its considerable natural wealth
into a healthy and stable democracy has had increasingly tragic human
consequences.
Ironically, oil development, which lies behind the Ogoni agitation and
which promised to provide the key to the nation's enrichment, has
dwindled faster than any other major producing area.

<HEADLINE>Expert rejects fears on computer damage. Virus alert is a global hoax</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>RON MACKENNA</BYLINE>

<RECORDNO>975438152</RECORDNO>

A DEADLY new strain of computer virus which for the first time can
actually physically damage computers has been sending companies and
individuals connected to the Internet scurrying for cover.
But the ''Good Times'' virus, which unlike its predecessors travels in
e-mail and can supposedly infect a computer when a message is read, is a
gigantic and very successful hoax on a global scale.
Businesses and computer users have been taken in by apocalyptic
warnings posted on the Internet which spell out in graphic detail the
risks posed by the virus. They state: ''If you receive an e-mail message
with the subject line Good Times, do not read it. Delete it immediately.
''What makes the virus so terrifying,'' the warnings continue, is that
it can travel inside the text of messages and does not, like other
viruses, need to be hidden inside a programme.
Once infected, the virus is supposed to destroy the computers' memory
store, the hard drive, and send the processor, the computer's brain, on
to ''a nth-complexity infinite binary loop'' -- which can severely
damage it.
However, the virus's supposed powers are still in the realms of
science fiction rather than science fact, say experts. ''It is
definitely a hoax,'' said Mr David Lloyd, systems manager at Strathclyde
University.
''The methods by which it is claimed to propagate are impossible,'' he
added. ''And the stuff about the loop damaging the processor is just
nonsense.''
Viruses, said Mr Lloyd, have not been known to damage the computer's
hardware, but only affect information stored electronically on hard
disks. Any virus can be cleaned out by wiping the disk although
information will be lost.
Mr Vic Lennard, editor of Macintosh computer magazine MacAction, said
the hoax had convinced a great number of people.
''I have been following it on the Internet and laughing about it. It
is a complete hoax, but I can understand that if people don't sit down
and think about it they can get taken in. It is a very good hoax because
it is frightening.''
Viruses are computer programmes, usually written maliciously, which
are designed to secretly load themselves into computers on the back of
other programmes.
Some have been designed to damage information held in the computer's
memory whereas others have been pranks and displayed messages calling
for, among other things, world peace.
One company which has taken the precaution of warning all its staff in
the UK is Nestle. A spokesman confirmed computer users were informed the
virus was a hoax yesterday, but was unable to say whether the company
had been taken in by it originally.
A spokeswoman for Compuserve, one of the largest on-line services in
the world with 170,000 customers in the UK and almost four million
worldwide, said there were fears that someone spurred on by the Good
Times hoax could try to write a real virus based on a variation of the
idea.
''It has been floating around as a rumour for about three months.
However, we believe this virus is a hoax and that it is impossible to
transmit a virus into a computer system via a text file.''

It is three miles long and bounded by shipyards, garages and
scrapyards. Joe Donnelly just had to eat his way down burger boulevard
IT TAKES a while to eat any distance along what is possibly Glasgow's
busiest restaurant avenue, but a stout heart and a hearty appetite helps
a bon vivant go the distance on South Street. Ah, South Street, I hear
you say. Of course, we'd quite forgotten the significance of. . . where?
South Street. Shades of the South Bank, Montmartre, Rive Gauche, 55th
Street. The apotheosis of gastronomy. No, not exactly, but a food street
to be reckoned with. This is Glasgow, west again of the West End, on the
north bank, in the shadow of the overpowering Clyde Port Authority's
grain store.
Real Glasgow, where the used-tyre dealers huddle cheek by jowl with
scrap traders, and car repairers next to furniture retailers, electrical
experts, and manufacturers of all sorts of mechanical parts. On a good
day, on South Street, they can have a choice of 13 restaurants, and
taking the off-streets into consideration, maybe half as much again.
We are talking alfresco. We are also talking to the chef, the
waitress, the owner, and they are talking back, because on South Street,
nearly three miles long and with only one dog-leg twist for directional
variety, food is what keeps the wheels of industry turning, what keeps
this street rolling.
''I get the top man from Forrest Furnishing,'' boasts one proprietor
as she gives a light flambe to my beef hache avec onion. Garnish? Sure
thing. This is real food.
''This is the berries,'' an unsolicited commendation from a shipwright
in far-off Yarrows at the wester end of the street, its bulk barely
visible in the distance. He has arrived here in a powerful, purring
Yamaha and he wants to eat, fast. So, apparently, do his colleagues who
are having a desultory game of football on a patch of spare ground.
''Come into the shade,'' invites the owner. Our shipyarder crowds out
of the sun where his leathers seem to be a skin-tight, fully-functioning
sauna switched to high. His brains must be seething under the lid.
''See'us a canny Irn Bru,'' he gasps first. The refreshment is opened,
guzzled. He makes a noise like an alarmed sheep, the sound elicited only
by a deep quaff of Barr's finest, and places his order. The owner, chef,
cook and everything-washer nods without taking a note. He's a regular.
Beside the hurried biker are two men in grease-stained overalls, having
difficulty making up their minds. They scan the menu. They give the
impression they might drool.
Biddy, for it is she, tells them to take their time. There's no rush.
The biker hands back the empty can while she flips over his saucisses
grilles, and adds slice-diced onions to jambon au moutarde. Meanwhile
the fromage is almost fondue, slumped like a Dali timepiece.
The smell of coffee, sizzling meat, sparking onions, is a heady
mixture. It envelops biker and the two men in overalls who, having
inhaled, are now hooked and have made up their minds.
''Two on sausage, hen, two cheeseburgers,'' one begs. ''A coffee,
potato scone and a slice of black pudding.''
Your reporter is on his second coffee, standing back out in the sun,
replete. This has been a mission, a traverse of South Street, left to
right, end to end, from Partick to Yoker in a bid to find out what makes
this busy industrial slice of the city get up and get going.
From eight in the morning until late in the afternoon at least,
winter, summer, hail and snow (and of late, some sun), it is Biddy and
her ilk, chefs rapid who get things moving.
Biddy, real name Bridget Coll, runs Biddy's Burger Bar, a tiny caravan
at the side of the road where many a passing, stamping workboot has worn
the pavement to a permanent dip. Her place is maybe eight feet by six,
if that -- and who was measuring after two whopping burgers that put
paid to any diet? Beside the tow-bar, a small generator is churning the
air. Biddy is building up a glow as she deftly juggles lorne sausage
with burgers. The griddle is on constantly, onions to one side, rich
black pudding to the other. A small cold box stores Irn-Bru, Coke, 7-up.
South Street's restaurants are no Malmaisons, no Chez-anybody's. South
Street is for working men and women who don't have time to sit and sip
the chardonnay and ponce around. Alfresco is under the swing-hatch out
of the weather, rain or shine. The wheels of this industrial and
commercial street are well oiled by the lard from the swiftly browning
sausages, or the corn oil that glazes the griddle.
Mock you may. It is the Biddys that keep this no mean city stoked. If
there is to be a recovery, the green shoots will be well-fed here.
On South Street, and on a hundred streets around this town, at least
you know the meat will start off red, not grey. It will end up brown,
not grey, and most of it, grown in Scotland, probably in fabled Lorne,
will be real meat and not ground up bits that hold other bits together.
Enough said. Pass the moutarde.
Biddy will not say ''Have a nice day''. She'll say ''Cheerio''.
Thelma, at the Golden Grill further along the road, will not wear a
paper hat and pour coke out of what seems to be a Dalek's extension.
Gail and Frances, waving to the big rigs as they pull away, offer real
chips, made from real potatoes, grown in Scotland. They are not called
fries.
They will also, like the rest of their fellow restaurateurs, tell you
to come in out of the rain, and give you pasteurised straight from the
carton, rather than long-life sachets that spurt up your sleeve.
Gail Milne, who operates Snacks, can boast the biggest quarter-pounder
burgers on the strip. They are huge.
''Garnish?'' she proffers, offering a sprinkle of lettuce and
cucumber. This is on a cheeseburger that might sink one of the boats the
shipyard biker has built. Frances is doing something dextrous as any
flambe chef with a mixture of comestibles, all a-sizzle. The food is big
and hot and above all it's cheap. Any editor who wants to save a bob
should send his food critics to more of these. No offence, boys and
girls, but this, for thousands of folk, is where it's at.
A quarter-pounder that weighs a ton with a side salad and real chips,
a cup of home-made soup, and a good-sized coffee. One pound and fifty
pence dead. You can see that on an expenses sheet: ''To meal with
important business contact: #3.00''.
One could be laughed out of office. One could also be smug and say the
food was fair, hot, quick, and darned good value for money. This writer
knows, because South Street is en route. This writer now needs to get
slimming.
Anyway, Gail and Frances in Snacks have been running their
street-restaurant for about five years. They get a lot of passing trade,
because on this street there's a lot of traders, workers, riggers,
sellers, and makers just a-passing.
''We like a blether and so do they. They want good food, quick and
easy and they want real value. That's what we offer, but we like to pass
the time of day. We're just normal folk like our customers -- even the
bosses who stop for a bite in their fancy cars .''
Biddy's tiny caravan offers possibly the cheapest food on the planet:
cheeseburger and real coffee for #1.05.
''I'm open from eight until after four in the afternoon,'' she says.
''And I've plenty of regulars. They all stop and say hello and have a
chat. Some grab what they want and just go. Others hang around and pass
the time. I've got bosses and workers, road sweepers and musicians
coming every day.''
She's a Knightswood girl; slim, blonde, with an easy smile and a line
in chat and a spatula that go non-stop when there's a crowd building.
''I always have real coffee because my customers like it. I know this
is just a wee place, but you want to give people the best.''
The best, is probably the Big Breakfast, and everybody on this street
does the Big Breakfast, a meal that would have knocked Paula Yates out
of that bed and flattened that ginger-haired chatterer.
The Big Breakfast is #1.50 anywhere on the street and almost
invariably includes sausage, bacon, black pudding, eggs, scone, beans,
fried bread, a roll and butter. Local variations on the 2.7 mile extent
can add or subtract an ingredient or two.
Billy Newton and his wife Thelma run two Golden Grill caravans,
identical outlets spaced by maybe 500 yards. They are the most
eyecatching, all brushed steel inside, and they are spotlessly clean.
The couple's street trader licence is prominently displayed. Billy
boasts there has been a caravan food stall on this site for 13 years.
''It's a not bad business,'' he says. ''But there are often too many
on the street; so nobody makes a fortune, but we get by.''
Getting by means paying attention to seasonal demands. ''This month
Irn-Bru is big, as are salads, light snacks and the like. Coffee always
does well in the morning, along with filled rolls.
''In the winter people stop for Bovril and soup, to keep the cold
away. We do our best to make sure the customer gets what he wants
whatever the day, whatever the weather, regular customer or not. People
have to rely on you. They all have work to go to and they need to eat
fast. They often don't have a lot of money to spend, so we want to give
them really good value. If people know they get their money's worth,
they come back. Folk who are doing a hard day's work need to get fed.''
Another coffee? Don't mind if I do. Up above, a passing cloud has
chosen this minute to shed weight.
''Come in out the rain,'' Thelma urges. Over in the corner, chips are
sizzling. A man in a flash BMW pulls up, orders two sausage rolls
complete with potato scone and a portion of chips and curry sauce. He
looks like an addict waiting for a fix. He gets it, gets in the car and
zooms off with a grin from ear to ear.
Further west, the Lite Bite is a fixed restaurant, set back from the
pavement, where you can sit in or take away, depending on your choice or
your hurry. Breakfast is all day, still #1.50 and offers an array of
common or garden, but honest, chuck with tea included. A salad roll,
with very fresh crisp lettuce, is a mere 60p. A bacon or egg roll is
50p, all cooked before your very eyes, sunnyside or turned, hot and
enticing.
At the east end, close to where the side-street holes-in-the-wall sell
used tyres, or bits of things, the Snack Bar's Sharon has hot pies or
bridies for 50p, soup for only 40p. You could die of overeating and get
change back from a fiver as you breathe your last here. Alan Dunsmuir,
11-year-old son of owner Karen, waves to all the lorry drivers who all
wave back. They know who's buttering their bread. Alan will tell you
he's a hero. Only the other week, a driver crashed into a lamppost. Alan
went for the police and the man's life was saved, he says.
Back at Gail's Snacks, a big trucker leans on the counter and makes
the whole restaurant shudder.
''Geeze four cans or thon Diet Coke, hen,'' he bellows, steaming like
a steeplechaser in the heat.
''Not the usual?'' Frances asks.
''Naw, hen. Geeze a break. I'm on a diet noo.''
He's a regular. He'll be back. So will this diner, to one, and
possibly all of the establishments in months to come, because, it's on
his way in, and on his way out of the city and sometimes it's just
difficult to pass one of these roadside bivouacs without catching that
essence of Glasgow, the working man's Glasgow, the real Merchant City.
This writer has tasted sweet and sour conch and barracuda in a
corrugated shack in the jungle. He has scoffed what might have been
grubs and might have been worse. He has been lucky enough to appease an
appetite in some of the more entertaining places. South Street, cheep,
cheerful, gallus, rough maybe, but always ready, he is proud to say, is
indeed one of them.

THERE is to be a full-scale inquiry into ''jobs for the boys''
allegations over senior staff appointments to the new North Lanarkshire
Council based in Motherwell.
The announcement of the inquiry came at the end of a stormy meeting
between Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and Cosla, at which Mr
Forsyth acknowledged they had ''a bit of a row'' over the new staffing
structures which the new councils were putting in place.
Others present described it as ''a slanging match '' as Scottish
Office Ministers repeated their claims of top-heavy bureaucracies and
too large committees designed to allow the widespread payment of special
responsibility allowances.
Council leaders countered by accusing Ministers of making claims that
were ill-founded, based on incomplete research or just plain wrong.
It is the second inquiry instigated by the Government this year into
the actions of a Labour-controlled Scottish local authority under
legislation which rules that councils must make appointments on merit.
An investigation into claims of bias in recruiting procedures used by
Monklands District Council begins on Monday.
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch said yesterday it was
very important for the credibility of the new council that the inquiry
took place, and he hoped it would be carried out ''speedily and
comprehensively'' and that the air could be cleared once and for all.
North Lanarkshire's Labour leader, Councillor Harry McGuigan, insisted
the council had nothing to fear from an inquiry and had every confidence
in the appointments it had made.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson welcomed the inquiry, but
said there should be a better and more flexible way to deal with such
issues. He had already called for the Local Government Staff Commission
to be given more powers to deal with all allegations about councils and
it was now time for the Scottish Secretary to respond.
The main complaint received by the Staff Commission over the filling
of jobs at the single-tier North Lanarkshire Council concerns the
appointment of 64-year-old Mr David McKendrick as the #71,000-a-year
social work director. Mr McKendrick will reach retirement age six months
after the council takes over next April.
There have also been claims of bias towards Motherwell District
Council officials when top appointments were made. Five of North
Lanarkshire's 10 chief officials come from that authority.
The inquiry will deal with appointments made at director level.
The Staff Commission passed a dossier detailing allegations about job
appointments at North Lanarkshire to the Scottish Office, insisting it
did not have the power to take further action but was not prepared to
give the council ''a clean bill of health''.
After the pre-Budget meeting in Edinburgh with the Cosla leaders, Mr
Forsyth refused to speculate about the legal implications if the inquiry
found any appointment had not been made on merit. He said the purpose of
the inquiry was to examine the facts. ''Once we have the facts then it
will be for the authority to draw the necessary conclusions.''
However, Mr Kynoch did agree that if appointments were found to have
been made by improper means they could be declared null and void. He
said the name of the person who would chair the inquiry would be
announced shortly.
The North Lanarkshire inquiry is being established under section 211
of the 1973 Local Government (Scotland) Act. These are the same powers
as the Monklands inquiry.
The Labour Party has been conducting its own investigation to
determine whether or not Monklands district councillors brought the
party into disrepute.
The whole Monklands Labour group is currently suspended from operating
on the district council and the 13 Monklands councillors who are also
members of the new North Lanarkshire Authority have been suspended from
membership of the Labour group on that council.

EXCLUSIVE
SCOTLAND'S water ''watchdog'' warned yesterday that it would not
sanction price rises by the new public water authorities when they begin
operating next April.
There have been fears that consumers would face increases of 15% to
25% in the West of Scotland.
The Scottish Water and Sewerage Consumers' Council was set up to
protect and represent the interests of water customers. Its first duty
is to approve charges and codes of practice.
Three new authorities operating in north, west, and east Scotland will
take full control of water and sewerage services from councils next
year.
The council has the power to review proposed price increases but
cannot prevent them. It can negotiate with the water authorities but if
a settlement cannot be reached the matter will be passed to the Scottish
Secretary, who has the power to impose a price level.
The customers' council held its first meeting open to members of the
public in Edinburgh yesterday, and chairman Dick Douglas said he awaited
details of any proposed new charges.
However, he warned: ''We would find it difficult to justify any price
hike. The water authorities have inherited an industry which is in good
condition.''
He declined to say what he considered would be a reasonable increase
but said such as 15% ''would be very difficult to justify''.
A spokesman for the east Scotland authority said that ''while a figure
of 15% to 20% has been talked about in the West of Scotland, we have
never said that this would happen in east Scotland''.
* Councillor Rhona Kemp of Grampian Regional Council was approved as
chairwoman of the northern authority; Professor Tom Anderson, formerly
director of sewerage of Strathclyde; will head the west area; and
Councillor John Connolly, of Central Regional Council, takes charge of
the east.

THE Scottish public is being asked along with the rest of Britain to
observe a two-minute silence today instead of Sunday as the traditional
honouring of the war dead and injured reverts back to Armistice Day.
The silence was first observed in 1920 and continued until it was
suspended on the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war,
Remembrance Day was moved, where appropriate, to the nearest Sunday to
November 11.
However, the Royal British Legion, bolstered by the huge public
support for the VE and VJ Day 50th anniversary commemorations, has
succeeded in having the two-minute silence re-introduced to the actual
day of the First World War truce.
A poll revealed there was almost universal backing for the legion's
campaign called ''11-11-11'' to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of
the 11th month.
The Prime Minister and the Duke of York are leading the appeals to the
nation to observe the two-minute silence. Former Prime Minister Lord
Callaghan, Labour leader Tony Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy
Ashdown have pledged their support.
Tills in 24,000 National Lottery outlets will stop ringing between
11.00 and 11.02am. Many supermarkets and shops are expected to follow
suit.
Banks, building societies, and Post Offices will also come to a halt
and many buses, taxis, lorries, and cars will stop where it is safe to
do so. The Automobile Association has urged drivers to be careful. The
AA's vehicles will observe the silence unless they are on an emergency
callout.
Legion spokesman Jeremy Lillies said support was continuing to pour in
right up to the last minute. ''We are not seeking to be dictatorial,''
he said. ''We simply want to create the opportunity for people to
remember.''

OLD and new, in wine parlance, are words which can denote maturity and
immaturity. They may equally signify musty and fresh. Certainly, there
is no doubt about the freshness of one of the latest additions to the
Oddbins list, a 1994 Pellegrino Grenaco at the inviting price of #3.69.
Oddbins, it is clear, deem it an interesting oddity. My local branch
has separated it from the rest of its Italian stock, and decorated it
with a hand-written tag stressing its unusualness (at least in Britain),
its richness, and its ''vivid refreshing acidity''. Connoisseurs of
winespeak know that this may merely mean abrasive, but in fact the words
can be taken at face value. As cheap Sicilian white wines go this is
well above average.
Although it comes from the vineyards around the old port of Marsala,
on the island's south-western edge, there is nothing to link its flavour
or colour with the brown fortified wine that is the sumptuous basis of
Zabaglione and of the famous sauce with which veal escalopes are
enhanced. Its taste is light and clean -- slightly nutty, slightly
lemony, with a touch of prickle -- and I would endorse the Oddbins
recommendation to drink it with seafood. Grilled swordfish steaks, or
the razor-thin slices of smoked swordfish that are a staple Sicilian
antipasto, would form ideal companions.
Carlo Pellegrino's vineyards date back more than a century, but those
of the Marchesi de' Frescobaldi in Tuscany are considerably older and
better established. Each of the Frescobaldi family's eight highly
productive estates in the region's best wine areas is a separate entity,
using grapes grown exclusively at different altitudes, with the white
wines coming from the highest slopes.
Although Tenuta di Pomino is the most renowned of these, the cheaper
1994 Albizzia at #4.99 is another Oddbins success, impressively
full-bodied and with plenty of vigour. Information on the label suggests
this particular wine has reached Britain by a circuitous route via
Chicago, which may explain the warning from the ''Surgeon General'' --
presumably American -- that women should not drink alcoholic beverages
during pregnancy, and that alcohol also impairs ability to drive a car
or operate machinery.
BUT if you are convinced that Italy's best wines come from the north
and that even Tuscany is too far south, then a Chardonnay di Triveneto
may seem an irresistible attraction at the low price Safeway is charging
for this product of the sizeable (and in my experience variable) wine
zone between Venice and the Austrian border. In Italy, as almost
everywhere else these days, Chardonnay has become a magic word, but this
one, alas, may have passed its sell-by date. The first bottle I bought
had that tired -- yes, musty -- taste denoting the onset of oxidisation.
The vintage, 1993, was concealed in tiny print at the bottom of the
bottle's rear label.
Now 1993, in white burgundy terms, does not imply decrepitude. But in
terms of all but the best Italian whites, and certainly in supermarket
terms, it is becoming risky. Prepared nevertheless to give it the
benefit of the doubt, I returned my unfinished bottle and asked for
another. Thus setting in motion Safeway's admirable fail-safe policy
whereby you not only receive a replacement bottle of the same wine, but
also get your money back.
The replacement bottle, as a sniff and a sip confirmed, was no better
than the first. But my rebate went towards buying a Pinot Grigio from
the same region which, at #3.99, was as fresh as a Grave di Friuli can
be. This time the vintage, 1994, was emblazoned on the front of the
bottle, and the vineyard, Ca Madunina, was proudly named. The label
information proclaimed the use of modern vinification techniques, but
what mattered was the concentration of flavour, making this wine a
captivating specimen of its kind.

Robin Philipson
W Gordon Smith
Atelier Books, #25
ROBIN PHILIPSON deserves a generous tribute of a book and in this
monograph by Gordon Smith he has got it. To my surprise, I must admit.
Having seen and read Smith's recent, blind, wrong-headed promotion of
Jack Vettriano (a slight painter if ever there was one), I feared what
he would do for Philipson. I had no need.
This tribute is a lovely, lively affair which combines anecdote with
serious comment. It made me laugh and cry, its eager enthusiasm a
fitting upbeat tribute, rather than a pompous worthy dedication.
For all his Scottish presence, Philipson was in fact English, a point
Roger Billcliffe makes well. ''His contribution to painting in Scotland
and art education here was vast. But Scottish art has its roots in
reality; the here and now. Few painters in Scotland choose to call upon
their own imagination to produce work which tests our preconception of
pictorial design, combined with the assured, yet often experimental,
technique that we encounter in Philipson.''
Philipson was born in a fine house in 1916 in Cumbria. His father was
a stationmaster who wanted to be a doctor but, whose education, as was
often the way then, was cut short by family circumstances. He too
sported a bow tie, and his son inherited his courtly manners.
One of a family of seven, with an inseperable twin sister, Philipson
remembered a gentle childhood with a creative mother who encouraged,
almost to the point of adulation, her son's gift for drawing.
His father promoted by the railways to Gretna, the 14-year-old twins
became boarders at Dumfries Academy, also school to J M Barrie. Happily,
the art teacher was also deputy principal and took art seriously.
''He made me see it had to be that way or nothing at all. At school
paints were frail things. We had crayons. I remember a pastel drawing of
a blue saucepan done by a boy in my class, and I saw the cream lining. I
thought it was the most beautiful thing I's seen in my life. It knocked
me over, so I took to doing pastels with him.
''Watercolour was beyond us, really. Poster colour was the great thing
in those days.''
By 1936 he was at Edinburgh College of Art, where he succeeded Gillies
as head of painting in 1960. That same year, aged 44, he had his first
solo show at Browse &amp; Delbanco, later Browse &amp; Darby in Cork Street,
where he also had his memorial show in 1993.
Married three times, at the age of 64 he adopted Jasper; four years
later Rebecca, and in 1897 his wife Diana and he had a son, Anthony.
This joy was overshadowed by a recurrence of cancer which he fought for
twenty years.
Smith's style, mixing friends' recollections with interviews taped
during the last three months of Philipson's life in 1992, works well,
and adds to other catalogues and books which look at Philipson in a more
analytic way.
The painter was prolific, with perhaps the best known series of
pictures being Women and Men Observed, Humankind, the Cockfights of the
1950s and 60s, and Rose Windows from the 1960s, the choir of colour in
his altarpieces and poppies, and laterly more complex canvases of images
seperate, yet connected by vertical and horizontal bars of rainbow hue.
Philipson was extraordinarily honest about his work, saying: ''I think
my cock fight series should be played down. The paintings aren't what
people say they are about. The psychological content is very modest. I
wanted them to be decorative, not tooth and claw. We've had poems
written about the subject and lithographs and drawings which are very
much better than the kind of things I did.''
A colourful hedonist but thoughtful man, his 1983 Festival show
addressed a more brutal monachrome, with the theme of wild black and
white dogs. Philipson liked women and his later paitings celebrated them
as odalisques, lounging in erotic dalliance.
I remember well his 1980s shows in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London,
culminating in 1989 with a massive Edinburgh Festival extravaganza which
packed Edinburgh College of Art with hundreds of his pictures spanning
all the years from the Kokoschka-inspired works of the 1940s.
Philipson's account of his first meeting of his mentor, Kokoschka, is
illuminating. ''I rang him from the Tate Gallery. It was four in the
afternoon and I said I'd just come from Edinburgh where he had a lovely
painting. I'd like to say hello but was leaving tonight. He said: 'In
that case you'd better come stright away.' So I went to a flower shop
and bought one lily. It cost #7 but I thought this is an adventure
unlikely to be repeated. He met me at the door and said to his wife:
'It's really just a boy who's come and a very extravagant boy indeed!'
Then he showed me this lovely series of pictures, so small, so intimate.
That evening stood out like a massive landmark, a launching pad.''
Among these wonderfully illuminating reminiscenes there are several
annoyances. Strangely, there are no dates for any of the pictures
illustrated. The quotations from other artists and dealers like Jack
Firth, Martin Baillie ex-art Herald critic, William Hardie et al are
scattered indiscriminately through the book with barely a change in
punctuation.
Meanwhile, the index lacks page numbers. This gives the book an
impossibly slapdash feel. However, layout and details aside, I think it
is valuable because it gives us Philipson's actual words and views on
art. He was the most articulate of men, generous to others, hard on
himself. I have enjoyed hearing his voice once more.

THE Moulin Inn is situated a half-mile north of Pitlochry on the way
to Braemar, at the foot of Ben-y-Vrackie. In an area beautified by
silver streams and the autumn hue, there is an additional bonus for
those who chance by the inn -- it has its own brewery.
Built in an old coach-house and stables three centuries old, the new
brewhouse completes the plan by owner Chris Tomlinson to create an
atmosphere of authenticity. His ambition to rejuvenate the inn has been
realised and fireplaces, boarded-up for years, have been opened and
floorboards left exposed for added effect.
As is the instance with so many contemporary brewers, Tomlinson had no
previous experience or background in the industry. But on August 12, his
glory came when he mashed-in his first brew. A traditional Scots brew,
dark, full-flavoured and with an ABV of 4.5%, it was given an eager nod
of approval.
After a competition among locals it was named Ale of Atholl, although
it is more regularly described as ''Your Ain''. Tomlinson currently
produces four barrels each week for consumption on his premises.
A special brew was made to celebrate the anniversary of the passing
through Pitlochry of Bonnie Prince Charlie 250 years ago. Called
Charlie's March, it is paler and weaker with an ABV of 4%; however, it
has since been renamed Braveheart, now that Charlie has gone awa', and
is likely to have a production of two barrels per week.
Four thousand miles away and four years earlier, Brian Baldasano and
Angela Ranson set up the first microbrewery in Florida, the Beach
Brewing Company. In an American market awash with tasteless beers there
was encouraging support from the growing numbers whose preference was
for ''hand-crafted'' ales. However, the couple's initial task was to
secure a good contract that would sustain their operation in its
formative years.
This was accomplished when Mill Bakery, a restaurant chain, agreed to
take their beers. Securing new accounts was a more difficult task and
many potential customers remained apprehensive about the products. While
Ranson concentrates on sales and marketing, Baldasano puts the kettle on
at the company's brewey which is attached to the Holiday Inn at
Universal Studios, Orlando. There is a Mill Bakery within the studio
premises. Imported white sand forms a beach effect outside the
restaurant and volleyball court and beer gardens all add to the
ambience.
The company makes three main ales. Honey Wheat, Magic Brew, and Red
Rock are beginning to attract the attention of a Floridian public weaned
on a high-fizz, low-flavour diet.
In name alone, Honey Wheat stirs the imagination and in taste it
provides an interesting flavour, the orange blossom honey delicately
coming through in this light drinkable ale of 3.5% ABV. A mild
over-sweet English ale, Magic Brew is dark nut-brown and porter-like in
body. Using roasted and caramel malts, it has a light hop flavour and
reveals a surprisingly low 3.4% ABV. The third, a light American amber
ale called Red Rock, has medium body with good hop aroma and a clean dry
finish, ABV 3.4%.
In addition to its own brands, Beach brews under contract for
Disneyworld where Lodge House Brew and Monorail Ale are sold at various
locations. The future for Beach Brewing looks good with the opening of
other microbreweries in the state and the rise in interest of ''craft''
beer. For the British visitor they certainly provide an appealing
alternative.
If opening your own microbrewery seems like the perfect way to pass
the time it is best to first examine the markets available.
Given that you have suitable premises, sympathetic neighbours, and
around #20,000, the biggest beer kit available can be yours with enough
ingredients to see you through the first three months. Happy brewing!

<TEXT>
BRITON John Martin Scripps yesterday became the first Westerner to be
sentenced to hang in Singapore after he was convicted of the gruesome
killing of a South African tourist.
His lawyer, Mr Edmond Pereira, said he would fight to escape the
gallows: ''He would like to see the case through appeal, through all the
channels.''
Scripps, 35, from Letchworth, Hertfordshire, who is suspected of the
murder of a Canadian mother and son and of involvement in the
disappearance of a Briton, was said to be laughing and joking with his
guards minutes before the verdict.
He faces Singapore's mandatory death sentence after a judge found him
guilty of murdering Mr Gerard Lowe in their shared hotel room on March
8.
Parts of Mr Lowe's body, including his torso and legs, were found
floating in Singapore harbour wrapped in black plastic bin bags. His
head and arms have never been found.
The court was told that Scripps had dismembered his victim using
butchery techniques he had learned in the kitchen of Albany Prison, Isle
of Wight.
Scripps had admitted killing Mr Lowe with a hammer, but said it was a
violent reaction to a homosexual pass and the death was an accident.
His lawyers had argued for a reduced conviction of manslaughter,
carrying a maximum 20-year sentence.
Under Singapore law, he has 14 days to appeal. The hearing would
probably be heard early next year, and if it failed he could make a
final petition for clemency to Singapore's President.
Scripps went on the run from the Mount Prison, Hertfordshire, during
weekend leave in October 1994, midway through a 13-year sentence for
heroin smuggling.
He was arrested in Singapore in March carrying an electric stun gun,
knives, handcuffs, and thumbscrews, and passports and credit cards
belonging to Mr Lowe and to Canadian tourists Mrs Sheila Damude, 49, and
her son, Darin, 23.
The Canadians' dismembered bodies were found dumped in undergrowth on
the Thai holiday island of Phuket.
Scripps, who also visited Mexico after going on the run, is the prime
suspect for police investigating the disappearance there of Timothy
McDowall, 28, a management consultant from London.
Prosecutor Jennifer Marie said the motive throughout Scripps' alleged
killings was money. He befriended tourists, killed them and pillaged
their wallets and credit cards.
Scripps' mother was reported to be under sedation following the
verdict. ''I cannot believe how my boy could have changed from a kind
human being into the monster he has been described in court,'' she was
quoted as saying in a London newspaper.
Mrs Jean Scripps, from Sandown, Isle of Wight, and her brother, Mr
Colin White, from nearby Alverstone, were not in court for the verdict
although they had attended the start of the trial.
Mr Pereira said his client appeared to be ''all right'' after hearing
the verdict. ''If you're found guilty of murder, there's only one
sentence -- death. He's not resigned, but he realises there's only one
punishment,'' he said.
They would not be able to assess the chances of a successful appeal
until they saw the judge's reasons for finding him guilty, he said.
Mr Colin Lane, consul at the British High Commission in Singapore, who
was in court for the verdict, said that Scripps did not speak and there
was no obvious emotion on his face as he was led away.
Mr Lane, who has visited Scripps on remand at Taneh Merah Prison, said
he had requested another visit and hoped to see him next week.
The Foreign Office said it had in the past made appeals on behalf of
Britons sentenced to death abroad, but that each case was examined on
its merits.
''Any appeal that we might make would not be made until all legal
avenues of appeal had been completed and had failed,'' a spokesman said.

THE Prime Minister has condemned the killing of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa
and eight colleagues as judicial murder. He said he did not see how
Nigeria could stay in the Commonwealth.
Nigeria now finds itself on the verge of international isolation after
the hardline military regime spurned worldwide pleas for mercy and
executed the nine human-rights activists.
Mr Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues were taken in chains to the gallows in
a prison at Port Harcourt despite intense pressure for the death
sentences to be overturned.
The nine men left their cells at 8.30pm to be taken to their
execution. This was just as 50 Commonwealth leaders, their spouses and
other guests, sat down to a banquet.
The Queen gave a keynote speech highlighting the value of civil
liberties and good government at 9.30pm. Two hours later, the executions
took place.
Mr Saro-Wiwa was reported as saying in an iterview he would like to
die ''in bed, dreaming.'' When asked what his regret in life was, he
said: ''My only regret is that I was ever born a minority in Nigeria.''
The executions provoked a wave of outrage and shock at the apparent
contempt with which the military leaders of Nigeria appeared prepared to
treat international opinion.
Few believed that the Nigerian authorities would risk inflaming world
opinion by staging the executions while the Commonwealth summit was in
progress in New Zealand.
The hangings came only hours after a Commonwealth appeal for clemency
and followed heavy pressure from individual nations for the sentences to
be revoked.
Mr Major, who was leaving Auckland for a weekend retreat with the
other leaders, said: ''It was an unjust sentence and it has been
followed by judicial murder. If the Harare principles mean anything, I
don't see how Nigeria can stay in the Commonwealth.''
He added that ''we set out the principles by which the Commonwealth
should operate in 1991 in Harare. This will be an acid test of whether
the Commonwealth intends to make those principles stick. I for one
believe that they should.''
The Foreign Office angrily condemned the ''callous act'' and Labour
demanded the immediate expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth.
Britain's High Commissioner in Nigeria, Mr Thorold Masefield, is to be
recalled to London for urgent consultations.
Mr Saro-Wiwa, a campaigner for the rights of the minority Ogoni
people, was convicted and condemned to death 10 days ago on charges of
inciting supporters to murder four tribal chiefs last year.
The nine men were said to have been blessed by a priest before being
executed in the death cell of the grim city jail.
The world, having urged Nigeria to stay its hand, yesterday expressed
its anger at the action.
President Bill Clinton recalled the US ambassador to Nigeria and
halted military sales to the country. He also directed the US ambassador
to the United Nations, Ms Madeleine Albright, to begin consultations on
appropriate UN measures.
South African president Nelson Mandela, who has been criticised for
failing to speak out on behalf of Mr Saro-Wiwa, said in a statement that
his country's delegation in New Zealand would recommend the expulsion of
Nigeria from the Commonwealth.
He added: ''The South African Government is recalling its High
Commission from Lagos for urgent consultations.''
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu said he was devastated to see
military ruler General Sani Abacha ignore the international appeals. He
called for the country to ''be kicked out'' of the Commonwealth and for
the world to apply sanctions.
He said the ''Commonwealth should call on the international community
to apply stringent economic, diplomatic, and sporting sanctions against
this regime. That is what brought apartheid down.''
Mrs Glenys Kinnock, the Labour Euro-MP who led a campaign in Europe to
save Mr Saro-Wiwa's life, denounced the Commonwealth conference as a
paper tiger for failing to act more firmly in preventing his execution.
She predicted more hangings in Nigeria and said: ''Our view was you
could never deal with these people and expect them to behave in a
civilised way. In the most tragic way, we have been vindicated.''
She said Mr Saro-Wiwa was a hero and warned that the people could take
to the streets. ''We could reach a stage of crisis and see more civil
disturbance, more deaths and more oppression.'' She called for
suspension of all trade and aid relations with Nigeria's government.
Shell, major producer of oil in Nigeria, defended itself from
criticism that it had ''blood on its hands'', an accusation from Mr
Michael Szabo of Greenpeace who said it should have used its economic
importance to Nigeria to put pressure on the government there.
A spokesman for Shell said the company felt the suggestion was ''a
false and grotesque accusation'', adding: ''We wrote to Greenpeace to
ask them to use their influence to restrain excessive protests, but we
didn't get a reply.'' He said Shell has been ''committed to an approach
of quiet diplomacy''.
Shell recognised that the community in the oil-producing areas, who
were mainly Ogonis like Mr Saro-Wiwa and the other hanged leaders,
''have perhaps not received a fair share of oil revenues'', he said. The
company had supported moves to raise that share, but so far with no
success.
Mr Lazarus Tamana, president of the Ogoni Community Association, said:
''Nigeria has proven itself to be the most callous and evil place in the
world today.''
Labour, meanwhile, has called for measures to deal with the regime but
aimed at protecting what it sees as an already oppressed population.
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ''These are not executions,
this is murder without fair trial of a political activist whose
campaigns embarrassed the military regime.''
He said Labour would press the Government and the international
community for action. He demanded a comprehensive arms embargo, a freeze
on the personal bank accounts in Europe of Nigerian ministers, and
suspension from the Commonwealth.
The call for action won backing in Britain from across the political
spectrum.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said: ''This is an act of
monstrous barbarism and injustice which marks Nigeria as an outlaw in
the community of civilised nations.''

HOW to get ahead in business? Bold ties, bright braces and loud suits
-- these once seemed a sartorial short cut to the boardroom. But now
they are more likely to short-circuit a businessman's career altogether.
Try looking the part -- not just acting it; suppress the Michael Douglas
within and restrict those bright red braces to fancy dress wear.
For just as it is hard for any businessman (except Richard Branson) to
be taken seriously dressed in beaten-up casual clothes, overbearing
yuppie attire now provokes unfettered suspicion. All the totems of
eighties Wall Street style have been discredited. These days a more
discreet, thoroughly refined taste provides a successful style for
businessmen.
Of course, city suits are a fairly standard uniform. The style
statement is made in the accessory selection. So what are the smart
choices right now? A desk bound tie should be unshowy, yet not
unconsidered. A small pattern or classic spot design is perfect. And the
shirt should echo the fine breeding of a traditional Jermyn Street
classic. Choose stripes, Oxford weaves or neat, understated checks . . .
all with well-formed collars and cuffs.
Steer clear of red (too assertive by far for these nicer nineties).
But as beige is bland and grey so grim, mid-blues and soft yellows seem
the surest colour options.
Cotton's the thing of course. Well, when was a businessman last taken
seriously in polyester? And, interesting as the extraordinary
technological developments towards iron-free cotton shirtings are,
nothing yet replicates the splendid impression made by any
well-laundered crisp poplin shirt. Sure, this is not achieved without a
little effort. But, hey? Is it really so hard to wave a can of spray
starch just ahead of a hot iron's crease-flattening impact? Please don't
imagine that this is a job best left to the little lady. Laundry ought
to be well within the executive skills of every nineties man. No
delegation permitted.
