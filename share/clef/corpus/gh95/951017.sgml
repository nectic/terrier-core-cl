CHRISTINE Kerr graduated this summer from Strathclyde University with
a BA Honours in Management Science, which she describes as ''a problem
solving subject with a mix of computing and statistics. It would be
better called operational research, as it is in England.''
Christine, who comes from a dairy farming family in Lanarkshire, felt
by the end of third year that she'd had enough of studying. She started
applying for jobs, getting numerous inverviews but no offers. She
returned to Strathclyde.
''I started applying for jobs last September -- with an eye on the
managerial arena -- mainly to banks and insurance companies because they
dominated the milk round.
''I'd a very high success rate for getting interviews, probably 70%. I
got several second interviews and a couple of companies intimated that
if the first person declined the job, I'd be offered it.''
After the milk round, she responded to advertisements and vacancies in
the university bulletin as well as The Herald. ''I wanted to stay in
Scotland and, if possible, stay at home and travel to work.'' By summer,
when she left Strathclyde, a job was still eluding her, so she sent
speculative applications to firms for which she wanted to work.
''I was quite keen to work for a company that was in some way
connected with agriculture and had people I could connect with,''
Christine says. Her strategy paid off. She now works for the
meteorically growing Robert Wiseman Dairies, based at their Whitburn
office.
''I began in their office in a distribution role: allocating loads,
reconciling purchases and orders daily, weekly, and monthly. I've been
lucky enough to get a move into the credit control department. It's an
excellent opportunity.
''I am dedicated to Tesco, one of our major customers. I deal with
supply, delivery, all sorts of queries, orders and accounts UK-wide.
It's quite a major challenge, and I'm certainly enjoying the job -- it's
given me an insight into the other side of the milk industry.''
Christine Kerr feels that a lively range of interests, foreign travel,
confidence and flexibility are all points employers look upon most
favourably.
''The degree, I think, is the key to open the door, you must have
other things to keep it open.''
She considers too, that she got good advice and backup from
Strathclyde's Careers Service. ''If I'd left my job search until after
I'd left university, it would have been a bit too late, because most of
the vacancies come out over the summer. It's also more difficult to
visit a careers service every day when you've left university.''
* DOUGLAS Webb describes his route to his new career with the Bank of
Scotland as a natural progression.
''I was always interested in getting a job in the finance sector. I
talked it over with Strathclyde University careers advisors, and they
suggested that my degree in technology and business studies (followed by
a one-year diploma in Russian because I wanted to do something a wee bit
different) might be best suited to a job in finance, and banking
obviously comes into that category.''
One of the main reasons which attracted him to the Bank of Scotland,
he says, ''Was because they offer a three-year training programme which
allows you to move around the different departments, giving a very
varied insight into what the Bank does.
''They encourage you to find a department which you like, and if
possible, you'll be given a career within that area. It's too early to
say what that might be in my case. Part of my contract is to do
professional banking examinations over three years, for membership of
the Institute of Bankers. You're always being encouraged to further
yourself, and get your professional qualifications.''
Douglas, who is 22, is currently based at the Bank's East Kilbride
branch, and says he is thoroughly enjoying working life. ''I've only
been here for six weeks, but already I'm moving around departments
getting a lot of customer contact, and I feel it's a challenge. I'm not
just being shoved into a back room, but thrown out into the front.''

Financial adviser
Eric Kennedy meets a man with a career in making money for people?
THERE is more to being an independent financial adviser than that, of
course, but helping people make the right decisions is what it comes
down to.
If the advice is of high quality, then everyone can be expected to
benefit. The investor sees his or her portfolio grow in value (or income
increase), and the adviser makes his money through commissions from
these investments. He does, however, have to know what he is doing.
One man who has been prominent on the Scottish financial advisory
scene for the past decade is Jeffrey Deans, who founded the Save &amp;
Invest operation in 1985 and has seen it spread from Glasgow to
Edinburgh.
These investment shops make it easy to come in off the street for some
informal advice on lump-sum investments, pension requirements, and tax
arrangements. Like all independent financial advisers, Deans and his
team have had to gain a series of certificates -- for Courses 1, 2 and 3
-- from the regulatory body, the Personal Investment Authority, as well
as an advanced certificate. This entitles them to trade as independent
advisers.
Those entering the trade would normally be put forward for these exams
by their employers. And a university education is an obvious advantage.
Deans himself went to Edinburgh University in 1975 after leaving
George Watson's College with five Highers -- including, of course,
economics. He emerged in 1978 with a BSc in Economics, forsaking the
final Honours year in favour of actually setting out in the real world
at a time of particularly high unemployment.
''I was itching to get on with it,'' he says. ''A lot of graduates at
that time felt the same way -- that getting a job as soon as possible
was important.''
He worked with a local authority for just over a year and then went to
Norwich Union for three years, learning about pensions, fund management
and administration. ''I realised it was a growth industry,'' he says,
''and it was one which fascinated me.
''So in 1983 I became the Scottish representative of a major
English-based independent firm of financial advisers, travelling the
length and breadth of the country, meeting people in their homes, and
working from an office built into my house. I still have that,
incidentally.''
The difference now is that he has since established Save &amp; Invest and
the routine is a bit different. He now juggles the roles of financial
adviser, managing director, and general helper to his team of advisers.
This entails seeing clients, writing reports, keeping up to date with
the latest market products, and generally investigating ways of
improving clients' portfolios by day, and attending to other paperwork
at home in the evening. He also sees clients who haven't been able to
see him in normal working hours.
Is it worthwhile job? ''For 98% of the time I would say yes,'' he
says. ''But every job has its frustrations, and any good financial
adviser would admit to a feeling of frustration at times -- a sense that
you could be doing even better by your client.
''In other words, it is a job which is constantly challenging.''

CENTRAL BANKS
Paris, Monday -- The Bank of France cut a key interest rate today
signalling an end to a currency crisis which blew up over worries about
the political and budgetary situation in the country.
But economists said that although the latest storm appeared to have
passed, markets would remain nervous until the government announced
convincing measures to cut public spending, particularly on welfare and
healthcare.
The fragility of the situation was underlined by a report in afternoon
daily Le Monde, which said justice officials had been told Finance
Minister Jean Arthuis long knew details of an allegedly illegal Swiss
bank account kept by his Social and Democratic Centre Party. It said
Arthuis denied all knowledge of such an account.
The Bank of France, which jacked up rates last Monday to defend the
franc, said it was lowering its 24-hour emergency lending rate to 7%
from 7.25%. It had raised the rate from 6.15% a week ago as the franc
tumbled against the German mark on worries that Prime Minister Alain
Juppe might have to resign over a corruption scandal.
The franc recovered towards the end of last week after a Paris
prosecutor ruled that while Mr Juppe had committed an offence in leasing
a low-rent city apartment, he would not open a formal investigation
provided Mr Juppe moved out by the end of the year.
Economists said they expected the central bank to continue to make
small and steady cuts in the 24-hour rate in order to return to
pre-crisis levels over the next few weeks. It appeared to have been
successful in convincing markets of its determination to defend the
franc by raising rates for the first time since President Jacques Chirac
won elections in May.
''They have answered a question about whether they would dare raise
rates under a Chirac presidency,'' Merrill Lynch economist Darren
Williams said.
And although in previous crises the bank had been attacked for raising
rates, this time it faced only a few critics -- notably parliamentary
speaker Philippe Seguin, who said yesterday that economic growth should
not be jeopardised by high interest rates.
But while monetary policy appeared to be riding high, the big worry
remained over fiscal policy. A parliamentary debate on the 1996 budget,
due to open on Tuesday, seemed set to focus minds on France's large
public deficit.

Take and double take is the order of the day at a young film workshop,
reports Dick Louden
IT is only six months since Glasgow Film and Video Workshop took up
residence at 34 Albion Street, in the Merchant City, but already there
is a constant buzz about the place. ''We have expanded so rapidly,''
said GFVW director Janice Campbell, ''that it has exceeded all our
expectations.
''We wanted to become a focal point for the television and film
industry and that is what is happening. Our membership has risen from
300 to well over 400.''
Every working space in the building was utilised last week as various
organisations took advantage of the superb new facilities. A BBC
television unit was filming for a new half-hour drama series called
Telling Tales, which is to be given a prime evening slot starting next
month. It features the work of well-known Scottish writers like Irvine
Welsh, A L Kennedy and Janice Galloway.
The unit was recording a script entitled The Pillow Boy of the Lady
Onogoro by Alison Fell, who comes from Kinloch Rannoch but now lives in
London. According to Sarah Barclay, the 29-year-old director who has
been with the BBC for four years, ''The story, set in Japan, offers an
interesting feminist perspective and for that reason Alison Fell, who
feels strongly about her Calvinist background, decided she couldn't set
it in Scotland. We are using a cast of four, all Japanese, an actor and
three students.''
Along the corridor, production teams were working on projects under
the Screenworks scheme organised by GFVW and supported by Glasgow
District Council and Strathclyde region. Ten short films are
commissioned and, when they are completed, a distribution package is
arranged so that they can be issued to various agencies and festivals
here and abroad. They will all be screened at the Glasgow Film Theatre
in December. David Mackenzie, who won the coveted Samuelson Prize three
years ago under Scottish Television's First Reels scheme for short
films, was shooting scenes for his half-hour production Wanting and
Getting both at GFVW and on location in the nearby Trongate.
Acting as an assistant director to David Mackenzie was 25-year-old
Shiona McCubbin, who took a degree in Fine Art at Glasgow University,
then did post-graduate study in electronic imaging at Duncan of
Jordanstone College in Dundee. She is also directing her own Screenworks
project, a 15-minute documentary on Glasgow Airport called Boxes in the
Sky. ''The facilities here at GFVW are wonderful and very spacious,''
she said. ''It's amazing how many young people in this area want to work
in the film industry.''
At a more advanced stage on his Screenworks film Sleepwalking was Mike
Kelly, who was busy in the post-production unit doing, to borrow the
industry jargon, the ''fine cut''. He described his film as ''a drama
about a young girl who discovers her father has just died. She invites
her female cousin over and they lock themselves in to wait for her
father to go to heaven.'' He is now at the stage of doing the
''sound-up'' -- the final mixing of the soundtrack involving seven
separate tracks (two for dialogue, three for sound effects, one for
voice and one for voice-over).
In an adjacent room Peter Patterson was conducting a one-day VHS video
editing course for beginners, in this case students from Glasgow College
of Art. He has been making video programmes for 11 years, mainly for
local authorities and large voluntary organisations like national
charities. ''I am also involved in GFVW's Community Projects Scheme,''
he said, ''under which we go out into areas like Barrowfield and
Drumchapel and organise groups who want to produce their own video
programmes. They are so keen that, with guidance, they can write their
own scripts and film and edit their own programmes. I also work with
bodies like ENABLE and enjoy collaborating in videomaking with both the
mentally and physically handicapped.''
Another training course, this time in computer animation, was being
taken by Kevin Laitak, who specialises both in this field and such
related areas as interactive multimedia and the Internet. He has
produced multimedia programmes for organisations like museums and, in
the area of drugs education, health boards. ''This is a four-day course
dealing with the techniques of animation,'' he explained. ''The course
members are from different backgrounds --from those who come out of
curiosity to a computer programmer who wants to expand his expertise.''
Two organisations have the use of office space in the GFVW premises.
New Visions runs a biennial international festival of film, video and
new media in Glasgow, and is also planning to organise two-monthly
screenings and events. According to its coordinator, Paula Larkin, its
objective is ''to widen knowledge of experimental work in visual arts
across Scotland''. It is contributing to Fotofeis, the second
international festival of photography in Scotland, which is running
until November 5 at over a hundred venues from Dumfries to Shetland.
Oak's Bark, founded by Inigo Garrido and Paul Marsden, was set up to
celebrate next year's centenary of the first film projection. It runs
community workshops to coach children of school age on how to make their
own movies. These tend to be around 10 minutes in duration, with the
youngsters acting and doing the filming themselves. At the Old Atheneum
Theatre on November 1, Oak's Bark is offering Silent Noise, combining
silent film with live music from a Latin jazz band. The company is also
planning a film projection event in the Arches, for which it will erect
100 columns with mirrors.
With the Glasgow Film and Video Workshop now bursting with activity,
its director is looking to the younger generation to sustain the
momentum. ''We welcome applications from those up to 16 for our Junior
Workshop,'' she said. ''We have excellent facilities and a range of
expertise to offer them.''
Glasgow Film and Video Workshop can be contacted on 0141 553 2620.

IN an average year, Anne Taylor, recruitment officer for Weir Pumps in
Glasgow, will take on 6-10 graduates, mainly mechanical and production
engineers, ideally with good honours degrees.
The milk round is Weir Pumps' traditional recruiting time, but with
several universities now having final examinations in January and
February, this may be reviewed. ''It's been a good way to determine a
short leet and for the students, it's on-the-spot,'' says Mrs Taylor.
Once recruited, graduate trainees are assigned to a core division,
usually technical or production, pursuing a general training programme
for one year, which is followed by a one year objective training
programme, concentrated on the core area.
In addition to the academic qualifications, Anne Taylor will be
looking for: ''Initiative, flexibility, willingness to take on
responsibility, enthusiasm for their chosen career, and a healthy
interest and awareness in commercial and financial aspects of
engineering, the implications and costs.''
She feels still that graduates need to work at commercial awareness,
an aspect covered better by some universities than others. Graduates,
she says, are aware of its importance ''but sometimes it's only when
they get a vocational placement that it all falls into place.''
Presentational skills? ''There's no doubt that graduates have much
more opportunity these days to present themselves well, they're given so
much help at university.
''We do look at the whole person. Their outside interests reflect
that; having held positions of responsibility in engineering societies
for example, is good, and the ability to work with and get on with other
people is very important, as it is in any job. Opportunities are there
provided candidates are willing to work hard and to earn responsibility
and advancement.''
* JIM Paterson is training schemes manager with the National Health
Service in Scotland's Management Development Group. This year he
recruited 24 graduates -- disciplines are varied, no particular degrees
are sought -- and next year's requirement will be the same.
Six of these will go into Business Management and Operations; six into
Human Resources and 12 into Finance. All go on to a foundation course
for new graduates and from there into the development programme.
''Depending on the discipline, the time taken for training varies,''
he explains. ''For finance, for example, it's three years, that's the
time taken to get their professional qualification -- CIPFA (Chartered
Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy). They'll go into
management accountant, financial controller-type courses for their first
line position. We reckon that in 10-12 years they should be reaching, or
verging on, director of finance posts -- although 15 years is about the
average.''
General management is divided between human resource management and
business and operations management. ''It's reckoned that people going
through the national training scheme will reach senior management
positions about four years before those who take the more conventional
route,'' says Jim.
''Although the greatest number of posts are available in finance, this
area sees the least number of applicants -- National Health finance is
probably not the most popular area to reveal you are in at a dinner
party. By contrast, business and operation management attracts the
greatest number of candidates, with Human Resources much sought after.''
Prospects are very good for graduates who go on to posts in the NHS
all over Scotland. A recent 15-year track of people trained within the
service, showed that over that period there was a retention rate of
between 50 and 60%.
* THE Royal Bank of Scotland recruited around 80 graduates this year,
and expects to take on a similar number next October. Muriel Ross, the
bank's graduate recruitment manager, explains: ''We recruit across the
spectrum of our business: the branch banking division; corporate and
institutional banking; Treasury and capital markets; technology; our
trainee accountant's scheme and our operations division.
''We like a business-related degree and generally see a
commercially-based degree as an advantage. Graduates all join a
specialised training programme within their own discipline in the bank,
usually for 12-24 months. We are increasingly looking for professionals
and specialists in each area. We also offer a whole range of
professional qualifications, depending on which is most appropriate.''
Both new and post graduates are sought by the Royal Bank, recruited
either from university or from the wider market place where some work
experience has already been gained.
''The bank is at the leading edge of change at the moment, we need
specialists of high capability,'' continues Muriel. ''While academic
qualifications are important, we also need graduates who are numerate,
have initiative, who can cope and have a positive attitude to change,
and can work as part of a team -- these are crucial.
''I take the view that the degree is the starting point; it's the
personal qualities and skills which they can bring to us which are
absolutely essential to having a successful future, because the career
is all about self-development and driving your own career.''

THE Solution Works was set up in Greenock by three young computing
science graduates just 16 months ago. Since then, it has won four
business awards, doubled its size in employee terms and more than proved
that The Solution Works, in every way.
Owned by partners Andrew McKelvie, 25, Russell Sneddon and John
Shiveral, both 24, the group have been friends through school and
Glasgow University. ''We've been together for quite a long time, we know
and trust one another very well -- you have to in a partnership. We
actually got our first jobs together too,'' says Andrew.
''We always thought it would be nice to be in business together but we
never thought it would happen. When we left university, we all ended up
working for a small business, a husband and wife team. We started at
their house, then it gradually moved into premises over two years. We
found out what could be done, we helped that growth; we knew we could do
it. This is the only time we were going to have the opportunity to go
out on our own when we're not married and have no mortgages.''
The company provides tailor-made business software solutions --
custom-designed programs -- as well as offering training in software
packages such as Word, Paradox and Access, and it sells shrink-wrapped
software too.
''We tend to go out to do training on these run-of-the-mill packages,
most of our courses are aimed towards developers. We've got worldwide
level experience in the packages we use.
''With our sales of shrink-wrapped software, if someone is looking for
a copy of Paradox or Microsoft Windows for example, we can supply it
quite cheaply. We try to provide an all-round service for clients,''
says Andrew.
Their clients are geographically spread from London through the
Scottish Central Belt and up towards Aberdeen.
''Amongst our major clients are Overseas Development Ministration,
Scottish Milk Limited, and Falkirk District Royal Infirmary.
''We do a lot of work for health boards,'' says Andrew. ''We can
provide them with nice easy-to-use software that doesn't cost nearly so
much money as the older systems that they've been using -- some of these
cost hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. It is mostly management
systems that we provide.''
Each of the partners develops programs. ''When we started off, because
there were only three of us, one person tended to lead the project,
perhaps borrowing others for working on parts of it. Now though, we are
so busy that usually you end up doing it yourself if it's a smallish
project, maybe talking over your designs and so on with the others.''
The company took on one employee last April. ''He is a metallurgy
graduate from Strathclyde University whom we knew before, we brought him
in as an extra resource for developing. We had two students over the
summer, and three weeks ago, we took on two more employees.''
Ask about their competition, and Andrew responds: ''That's not a
problem because of the areas we are in and our expertise. We use
Borland, an American company's products. We are one of their premier
partners -- of which there are only seven in the UK, two in Scotland.
Borland are the major players in this market.''
When the three were setting up in business, they looked at both
Clydebank and Greenock to see what help was available. ''Inverclyde
Enterprise was by far the best,'' says Andrew. ''They have been so
helpful. We wrote our business plan, but they helped us get premises and
grants from the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust and Inverclyde
District Council, through a small business assistance scheme.
''It took off right from the beginning. People always say it's really
hard in your first year, but we did a lot better than we imagined we'd
do that year. I think one factor was the publicity we've had from
Renfrewshire Enterprise, and Inverclyde Enterprise pushing us forward.
''We won this year's Livewire Award in Scotland, and were the UK
runners-up. We also won the Readers' Digest Award for the best new
business in Scotland, and we got the Carlton Highland Hotel Business
Award. It's a bit embarrassing. The publicity has been been amazing.''
For the future, the group is working towards achieving Tick IT quality
assurance BS5750, the computing industry's version of ISO 9000/BS5750,
which they aim to get by March.
''It's just been beyond our dreams,'' says Andrew frankly. ''We just
have to keep going the way we are, we are looking to take on another
unit in the building.''
He advises other graduates looking to self employment: ''Get some
experience first, perhaps in the business world. Gather as much
information and as many contacts as you can, before you dive in. When
you're going to start: plan, plan, plan.
''It must be much harder for individual people, with the three of us
there's always someone else to help out or take over if you're ill. I'd
advise anyone thinking of self employment to make as much use of
enterprise companies as you can -- and anyone else who can help --
before you start up.''

The Graduate Careers Fair on October 24 and 25 in the Central Hotel,
Glasgow, is a mine of information for students aiming for that ultimate
prize -- a permanent, full-time job. Wendy Jacktakes a look at what's on
offer
THE Central Hotel in Glasgow has seen many society weddings and
upper-crust bashes in its time, but it is only at the Graduate Careers
Fair on October 24 and 25 that it will reverberate to the sound of an
expected 4000 students and graduates knocking lumps out of the carpet
tread in search of career inspiration and information.
To find out what is on offer and how to get the most out of the event,
consult copies of the fair guide at all graduate careers services in
Scotland. This includes details of an extensive programme of seminars,
including advice on job-seeking, personal presentation and information
on breaking into particular careers like marketing and media. Careers
advisers will also run clinics over the two days to give help with
particular queries or constructive comments on your curriculum vitae.
Organised by Strathclyde University on behalf of all graduate careers
services in Scotland, the organisers are delighted to be able to report
an upturn of more than 25% in employers attending the fair this year. In
line with a recent report on the increasing numbers of Scottish
graduates finding work in Scotland, over 60 exhibitors are represented
at the fair. Not all are from north of the Border but all are keen to
deliver information on their organisations and recruit the best
graduates.
The fair will offer several sessions on self-presentation, at
interview and through CVs and speculative applications. Indications for
graduate recruitment figures are encouraging, although it is certainly
apparent that employers have become more selective. It is not enough
just to have obtained a good degree. Recruiters are also looking for
evidence of initiative and imagination. Consult a careers adviser to see
if your CV puts you across in a positive light.
Staff from Skill, the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities,
will be present at the Fair to give advice and information to students
with disabilities looking for work.
This will range from discussion of particular issues facing disabled
job seekers to information on organisations who are known to provide
work experience or employment environments suitable for graduates with
certain disabilities.
A representative from the Employment Service PACT (Planning,
Assessment and Counselling Team) will also be on the stand, to explain
the kind of help they can offer.
All the available information will be provided in formats to suit each
individual: tapes, braille and large print, and there will be a sign
language interpreter on the stand.
The sensitive subject of when and how to disclose a disability to
prospective employers will be the subject of a seminar led by Carol
Uszurat, development officer (Careers) at Skill. She knows exactly what
she's talking about, having been diagnosed as hard-of-hearing as a
mature student, and having had to plot a career path against a
background of increasing deafness.
''I thought my working life was over,'' she says. ''It took me a long
time to discover just what kind of help was available.''
There will also be seminars aimed at mature graduates and later
job-changers, so it is important you know in advance all that is going
on so that you can make the most of your time at the fair.
Strathclyde University is running two seminars entitled Prepare for
the Fair, one of them today from 1 to 2pm and the other on Thursday from
6 to 7pm at the Careers Service, Level 5, Livingstone Tower, Richmond
Street. These will cover advice on what seminars or clinics might be of
help to you, as well as advice on how to approach employers' stands.
It is important to know that the purpose of the fair is not to offer
on-the-spot jobs to all those attending, although it should certainly be
seen as a first step on the ladder to securing that job.
Typically, you will therefore notice every mode of dress from jeans
and boots to standard interview garb of high heels and ties, though not
usually on the same graduate. It is probably a good idea, however, to
pay attention to your appearance, as this will form a large part of the
first impressions made of you by the recruiting staff.
Already lined up is one of the best-attended fairs yet, with several
new employers taking space this year. Also an impressive list of seminar
speakers able to pass on inside information on job seeking success. Come
along and pick up a few new skills or ideas to help you on the path to a
fulfilling career.

More graduates of Scottish universities are finding jobs in Scotland,
which is generally taken to be an indication of an improvement in the
labour market
THE good news is that the jobs market in graduate recruitment appears
to be both easing up and broadening out to well beyond what have been
the traditional parameters.
''Compared with last year there are definite signs of an upturn,''
says Barbara Graham, director of Strathclyde University Careers Service
and convener of the Scottish Graduate Careers Programme (a consortium of
careers services in Scotland).
''Positive indicators are a 20% increase in bookings for the Fair over
last year, and I think all the careers services would report that
vacancy bulletins are much fuller than they were a year, or even six
months ago.
In addition, a recent report from the Scottish Graduate Careers
Programme: Graduate Employment in Scotland, concluded that more
graduates of Scottish universities are finding jobs in Scotland, which
is generally taken to be an indication of an improvement in the labour
market.''
But while this buoyancy is good news, a further problem has been
created alongside it, as the institutions have been taking in more
students, and therefore producing more graduates.
''This is why, in the future, it is never going to be possible for all
graduates to be employed by what have been the traditional recruiters,''
says Barbara. ''There are simply more of them.''
In the United States, for example, graduates have long been employed
in jobs that graduates in this country considered unsuitable.
''Obviously, if you increase your population from 10% graduates to
approaching 40%, their work role is going to have to be wider,'' she
says.
Enter then the smaller employer.
''All the careers services are trying to link with the LECs (Local
Enterprise Companies) in order to get our message across to smaller
companies, but much of our contact is direct. Quite interesting things
are happening because of the changing nature of many smaller businesses.
''They may on the one hand be trying to target global markets, so that
might call for people who have business knowledge about exporting and
marketing in a rather more sophisiticated manner. Equally, they may find
the business moving in an IT direction.''
Simplicity is the name of the game: all an employer need do is
advertise in one of the university vacancies bulletins stating his
requirements -- and wait for the replies.
Another way in which universities are trying to court the smaller
employer is through work experience for students. Vocation work, casual
employment, placements: the work may be degree-related or
non-degree-related. One civil engineering firm's graduate recruiter
recently quoted the best person he'd seen was a graduate from the
previous year who'd been working as a car salesman. He had developed a
sharp edge, and was much more comfortable in the interview situation in
comparison with students or brand new graduates.
The recognition of transferable skills is the message of many seminars
at the Fair. Recognising and maximising on these, confidence building
and presenting yourself at your best are essential tools for your job
search kitbag.
Careers services themselves have also had to learn new skills and
develop greater flexibility in a changing marketplace. ''In order to
offer a better service to employers and students, we have to be alert to
nuances such as completely new methods of recruitment in order to teach
students how to handle them,'' says Barbara.
''This summer, for example, several employers have told us that they
first do a screening telephone interview -- a different technique which
depends even more on the individual's personality and delivery. It's
going to be quite tough for students. It's prevalent in businesses where
people are using the telephone a lot such as the finance sector, call
centres, sales and marketing jobs.''
The Hidden Job Market is another interesting route to seeking
employment. ''We have to teach students how to go and search for
themselves. Since fewer than 20% of people now find their jobs through
the milkround, it's important to put out speculative applications, or to
consider finding a job through a temporary contract, or networking.
''Knowing what to find out, where to look, how to approach it all is
important: which sectors are more buoyant? what are employment trends?
Don't just look at the job ads in newspapers, look at the companies in
the news pages, the business pages. That is teaching a skill that people
will have for life; understanding how to look for indicators that a
company might be looking for someone,'' advises Graham.
And what about marketing yourself? In simplistic terms, don't think of
one single CV to push round everyone. These should be custom-designed
for different sectors. Graham suggests: ''You should actually think
yourself into your prospective employer's mind and deliver your
information accordingly. Speak the employer's language, not yours.''
And finally, she has this plea: ''Remember, you can see a careers
adviser all year round at your careers service, so don't queue for two
hours to see one at the Fair. The people you should be out speaking to
are the employers, they will be here for only two days -- make the most
of them.''

IF you have never crossed the door of your careers service, what can
you expect in terms of assistance?
Even with funding cuts and the general squeeze on costs in higher
education, careers services set themselves high standards. Facilities on
offer may include a structured programme of seminars on careers
education, with emphasis on entrepreneurship, in line with current
trends towards increasing self-employment.
Longer workshops may also be available where all the skills required
for job-seeking, for example, may be covered in a one-off day of
intensive training. These courses are usually free to graduates and can
be tremendously remotivating. Technology has its place too, with most
major careers services subscribing to computer-based systems of analysis
for assisting students in deciding career direction. Computer analysis
has also contributed to the growing numbers of employers using
personality or skill tests at interview, and it is essential that the
Graduate Careers Service is up to speed in advising students on
developments.
From your own point of view, it may be a good investment to go and
exploit this expertise and practise some of the newer techniques in the
''safe'' environment of your own service before you encounter them for
real, and your dream job depends on a one-off performance at an
employer's test centre.
Responding to the times, careers services have replaced dependence on
the traditional milk round of employer recruitment visits to campus with
a wider scope of contacts within the business community. Closer links
have been formed with smaller employers who may want to recruit only a
couple of graduates every few years.
Improved links with Local Enterprise Companies also help facilitate
the placing of graduates within small businesses; the graduate obtains
valuable commercial experience and the company wins access to particular
skills which it can utilise on a project basis, if nothing more
permanent is possible.

ARE all those who are complaining about the new voucher scheme for
nursery education not in danger of shooting themselves in the foot?
Possibly. That is the risk you always run when you challenge an
initiative in which new funding is being invested. On the other hand,
while Michael Forsyth could presumably walk away from the whole voucher
proposal and blame local authorities and others for stunting the growth
of pre-five education, that would not fit well with his new
self-projected image as a ''listening minister'' and would raise
enormous doubts about the Government's much-proclaimed commitment to the
under-fives.
It was inevitable that a voucher system would be perceived as
political dogma, since ministers have spoken on previous occasions of
their interest in introducing vouchers for post-16 school and college
education. The concept of a free market in providing education and care
for very young children was bound to meet with profound hostility in
many quarters. In fairness, the reaction has at times verged on the
hysterical, conjuring up emotive images of cowboys operating from
dung-infested stables, starving their charges and resetting most of the
fodder.
However, hysteria often cloaks a basic truth. The concerns about
private operators moving in for purely pecuniary reasons and being more
interested in quantity than quality are deeply felt. Likewise, premises
that local authorities would not consider acceptable could easily come
into use. It is also extremely galling that, on one of the few occasions
in recent times when the Scottish Office has genuinely found new money
for educational purposes, part of it will be devoted to bureaucratic
administration and not to the funding of new pre-five places.
My own reservations are twofold. Firstly, nothing that is proposed is
likely to enhance choice for parents living outside the main urban
areas. I have no doubt that the findings of a recent survey by the
Scottish Parent Teacher Council -- that the great majority of parents
want nursery school education for their children -- are a true
reflection of parental feeling, but that feeling is likely to remain
unsatisfied in less populated districts. Secondly, pre-five education is
an area where both experience and expertise reside with the local
authorities and it would seem eminently sensible to build on that very
strong foundation, rather than jeopardise the quality of the service by
exposing it to the vagaries of the marketplace.
On the positive side, the Scottish Office -- in its consultative paper
on the voucher system -- has produced an admirable framework for a
national pre-five curriculum which has met with almost universal
approval. That framework provides an excellent foundation for the
provision of universal education and care at the pre-school stage and
would lead on naturally to the 5-14 curriculum. It could be implemented
with or without vouchers and, whatever the outcome of the present
controversy, it deserves to be taken forward as a template for pre-five
education.
You previously criticised New Labour's apparent lack of distinctive
policies for education. What is your reaction to Tony Blair's statement
that grant-maintained schools will become so-called foundation schools
and will not be returned to local authority control?
Nothing about New Labour's opportunistic approach to education
surprises me any more. Foundation schools are not the last surreptitious
adoption of Tory policies we shall be hearing about in the next year or
two.
What is your reaction to the current argument that some university
degrees are no longer worth the paper they are written on?
It may be reassuring that the argument seems to be concentrated on
that vast area south of the Border. However, the background is worth
reviewing in case it throws up anything of relevance to Scotland.
The Higher Education Quality Council was so concerned that it set up a
Graduate Standards Programme to consider the feasibility of defining
minimum standards for the award of degrees. Between 1990 and 1994 the
number of higher education students rose by 65% and the number of
degree-awarding institutions doubled. With the frequency of first class
and upper second class honours degrees also increasing and more and more
HE courses being franchised by the universities to other establishments,
it was not surprising that doubts began to arise about the standards of
new graduates.
It can, of course, be argued that the higher incidence of top-class
degrees can be traced to improved quality in teaching at both school and
university level and it will be interesting to see how far the reports
of the Graduate Standards Programme go along with that. It would also be
surprising if such a fundamental review did not unearth evidence that,
in a sector where each institution treasures its own autonomy, like very
often cannot be compared with like. It must surely be the case that
comparability does not exist across all degree courses in any one
subject, let alone across all courses in all universities.
Is it true that some employers are ignoring the new universities when
they are on recruitment drives?
There is a tenuous link between this question and the last one. My
understanding is that there are employers who target specific
universities, no doubt based on traditional perceptions about the
quality of degrees, but that the majority do not. Understandably, the
increase in recent years in the number of HE institutions means that
certain employers, especially those who intend to recruit only a few new
staff, consider it more realistic to focus their effort.
This does not mean that they necessarily focus it on the old
universities. Many make it a conscious policy of crossing the divide,
especially because they appreciate the experience which graduates of the
new universities have of placement programmes.
In general, employers set out to identify graduates with the skills
they are looking for, irrespective of where the degree has been taken.
These are the flexible, transferable skills which business and industry
are crying out for nowadays and it is up to both the old and the new
universities to provide them.

WHEN I came to Scotland in 1973 from the Faculty of Teacher Education
of the City University of New York, a debate was raging here concerning
-- guess what? -- how to train teachers. Interestingly enough, the same
debate was current in the USA at that time. Now, as then, the present
controversy is particularly heated concerning the training of secondary
school teachers. Is academic performance at university a prerequisite of
a good teacher? How much teaching practice or school experience should
be required? Are professional courses in education and psychology
relevant and necessary for classroom teachers?
Since the early 1990s, it has been a requirement that in order to
teach in a secondary school in Scotland, a university degree is
necessary (apart from technical and practical subjects). This has been a
valuable factor in building a strong and well-qualified teaching force.
In the USA, where each state sets its own requirements for teaching, the
situation is quite similar. The major difference is that there are more
specific subject requirements for secondary teachers. In order to teach
history, a student must complete courses in American history, world
history, geography, politics, and economics. These are minimum
requirements and a student would also study a wide range of history
courses. Subject studies would be related to secondary school
curriculum. For example, a history graduate who had studied only ancient
or medieval history would not be accepted for training as a History
Teacher.
An article in The Herald recently reported that there would be
tightening of entry qualifications for teacher training. Upon close
examination of the proposed changes, they seem rather limited.
I visited Germany in 1993. Prior to my visit, I was aware of both the
status of German teachers as civil servants and the higher salaries they
receive, along with a shorter working day and less pastoral,
administrative, and clerical duties. But for me, the most oustanding
feature of the training of secondary teachers is the rigorous nature of
the programme.
Students are all graduates and, as in our system, they offer two
subjects. However they undertake a two-year postgraduate training
programme. They are assigned to a school during their first year and
teach eight hours per week, divided between the two subjects. An
additional four hours of observation is required to make a total school
commitment of 12 hours per week. They have no choice of schools during
the first year but may ask for a specific school during the second year.
In addition to the 12 hours per week in school, they also attend an
intensive four-hour class (Hauptseminar) which is similar to our
professional studies classes. It is a course which integrates education
and psychology and examines major issues relating to teaching, learning,
classroom management and organisation. Students also attend a three-hour
methods seminar for each teaching subject.
During each year German students are observed a total of four times in
each subject and receive a further four visits from the leader of the
Hauptseminar (a total of 12 visits per year). The last visit in their
second year in each subject is the most important and becomes part of a
four-part final evaluation. The observers include the seminar leader,
the subject tutor, the headteacher of the school and the class teacher.
It may also include a representative from the Ministry of Education of
the relevant federal state and representative from a teachers
organisation. Five of the six observers (not the representative of the
teachers group) vote and rank the student on a one (high) to five
(low/fail) score. The student sits in on the discussion and evaluation.
In the second part of the final evaluation, each student must plan and
develop a scheme of work for about 10 hours of teaching. They are
required to teach it in school while being observed by a specialist
subject tutor. After the teaching is completed, the student must analyse
and evaluate the unit and submit a report to two subject tutors, the
Hauptseminar leader and an official from the Ministry of Education. Each
of the trainees, class teachers and subject tutors write a report and
the Hauptseminar leader prepares an overall, composite report which
includes a mark.
In the final part of the evaluation, the student will prepare two
topics for each subject. Each topic presented must include a detailed
outline of methods and materials with supporting rationale. The student
will be questioned for 20 minutes by each subject tutor followed by 20
minutes with the Hauptseminar leader -- a total of 60 minutes and will
receive a grade for the overall presentation.
Each of the four parts of the final evaluation will be considered and
weighted. An overall rating and detailed report will be compiled which
indicates whether the student has passed or failed.
This is quite different from our one-year Postgraduate Certificate of
Education. The German model is longer and includes more exhaustive
examination of the candidate. A valid criticism of the German system
might be that there is too much emphasis placed upon examination and
submission of reports. However, after reflection, my own assessment of
the programme is that the length of the course and the more numerous
visits permit the German student to grow and develop by internalising
and synthesising experience, advice and theory over an extended period
of time.
If we are to endow our teachers with similar professional status to
that already enjoyed by, for example, the medical and legal professions,
then we must adopt parallel selection procedures in academic and
professional training. The German model may not offer a complete answer
for various political, cultural and social reasons but we can surely
incorporate some of the significant features I have outlined above if we
are to ensure any meaningful changes and improvement in our teacher
training system.

Joan McFadden reports on a major financial backer coming in from the
wings to encourage better education in the community
FINANCIAL sponsorship in education has recently had a major boost in
the shape of Barclays Bank's New Futures Awards. The initiative was
inspired by the results of a survey of bank employees, who felt more
should be done for the local communities, and resulted in the
biggest-ever sponsorship for education.
It totals #5m over the next five years in the form of cash awards to
schools along with the provision of liaison and support. Each project
will be funded for two years, and three different levels of award were
given in this first year, valued at #2500, #4000 and #8000. One of the
main criteria in awarding the highest amount involved schools working
with others, and with community bodies.
There is no set subject within the award, and applications were
invited from all schools, which then detailed the planned project in
terms of finance, preparation and development. Six schools in Scotland
were successful in receiving various levels of award, and they all
satisfied the judges' desire to see young people involved in learning
through positive practical support. There will be an official launch for
all the schools involved next month, which will give all the
participants the chance to compare notes on achieving success in the
scheme.
Bellshill Academy in Lanarkshire, which won an #8000 award, has
already had one celebration with pupils, staff and parents present
earlier this month to share in their success. Howard Smith, Operations
Manager of Barclays Bank, and Arthur Cummings, regional adviser for
Scotland, presented the award to the school for its continued
development of peer education.
The initiative came out of the supported-study scheme in the school.
Derek Goldman, partnership officer at the school, decided to revitalise
the scheme with a new perspective aimed at instilling study skills in
first-year pupils. He began with an eight-week pilot which focused on
different aspects of study skills, linked to homework. It was pro-active
from the start, with good preparation and communication with parents to
make them aware of the value of supported learning.
Pupils, teachers and senior pupils were involved in providing mutual
support to ensure the outcome was successful. Out of the teamwork there
emerged a club, Bellshill Academy First For Learning and Enjoyment --
better known as BAFFLE. There was an instant rapport with first-year
pupils, with more than 100 of the 143 year group enrolling in the club.
Every Wednesday night 80 to 90 people would be queueing up waiting for
the session to begin.
Initial funding came from Strathclyde region's supported study budget,
but the Barclays award will enable Bellshill to develop the club and
extend it to its four associated primary schools, Belvidere, Mossend,
Longmuir, and Noble. The 16 senior students who will be instrumental in
involving the primaries over the next two years had to apply for their
places, and face competitive interviews against other applicants. They
are to attend a residential training weekend during which they will also
concentrate on team building and give constructive criticism on good and
bad teaching methods, provided by some of their own teachers.
Financial benefits apart, the award has given recognition to the hard
work of all involved. It has also greatly benefited the scheme. Good
relationships have been developed between staff and pupils, and the
positive publicity which has been generated could open further funding
avenues when the Barclays award finishes.
Grangemouth High School is also a high category winner, and by
coincidence, is similarly involved in peer education. Although the
funding is directed towards an entirely new scheme the idea was born
through other community ventures. The school has a long history of good
community involvement and has previously won awards for the success of
campaigns on such issues as anti-smoking. It has also had considerable
involvement in supported study, with the financial assistance of BP and
the Prince's Trust.
Its most public success to date has come from its drama group, with
its major anti-drug message which became the focus for the region's
anti-drug campaign. In conjunction with Forth Valley Health Board and
with funding from Community Against Drugs in Central region, it took the
message to contemporaries through theatre and peer-led education
workshops.
This type of community involvement has helped with the planning and
development of the new project, and the ultimate aim is to break down
barriers and provide an early link with the three main associated
primaries, Bowhouse, Beancross, and Moray.
Seventeen sixth-year pupils have volunteered to provide initial
support and have already undertaken a team-building course. A second
wave of seniors, this time from the fifth-year, is anticipated early
next year, the aim being to provide continuity into sixth year. The plan
is to expand the project into three years, although funding is only
provided for two. Natural caution prevents any long-term predictions.
For the moment, the phased development will be influenced by the
response to the careful initial planning and implementation.
Bellshill Academy and Grangemouth High have one other thing in common
in the pupils they are attracting to their schemes. There is no room for
cliques or self-serving individuals, and this is reflected in their
''across the board'' response. Looking to the future, Arthur Cummings
would like to see some form of networking which would spread the message
and allow the expertise gained to include as many as possible.

In business, introducing an external influence can reap benefits,
reports Geraldine Abrahams
BRINGING someone new from outside into a family business can be
fraught with problems, not least because of the emotions involved. When
that person takes on the role of managing director, a reaction of
wariness and apprehension from the existing managing partners would be
understandable.
This being the case, the appointment of Gerry Eglington as managing
director of Hillington-based electronics firm EMA in January this year
might well have resulted in acrimony. Instead it has been welcomed with
open arms and the company, which was ticking over nicely, is now set for
substantial growth.
For Gerry, the past 15 years have been spent in senior positions
within materials management. He has always worked for big companies like
British Leyland at both Edinburgh and Bathgate, Unisys in Livingston,
and Rosyth Dockyard -- a career path which allowed him to build up vast
experience in business at this level, running departments of 50 or 60
people.
In contrast, EMA is a small to medium-sized company employing, in
total, around 90 people. It produces printed circuit boards for an
extensive range of electronic goods.
The company was started in 1974 by the father of the present
shareholders Dave, Norrie and Paul Stark, and each brother has worked in
specific areas -- Dave in sales and marketing, Norrie in production and
Paul on the technical side.
They decided to base the business at Hillington because of its
strategic position in relation to IBM, which at that time was the focus
for most electronics companies. Ironically, EMA's first contract was not
with IBM but with NESL, now known as RACAL GUARDALL, in Edinburgh.
The company operated in five-year cycles, each one featuring one main
customer and the continuity was based more on luck than strategy. In 20
years, there were only four major clients: Tokheim, Rodime, IBM and
Lucas Automotors, and each one stimulated expansion and growth within
EMA.
While the company was enthusiastic about moving onto a more
progressive level of business, the management team knew that it was
vital to have strong quality systems, and management and production
structures in place.
Implementing these systems and structures involved an expertise which
was outwith their existing capacities, and they found themselves
becoming increasingly reactive rather than pro-active.
Around this time, they found out about the STRIDE Programme through
Renfrewshire Enterprise. The initiative is reported to have created 120
jobs, safeguarded a further 230 and improved the profitability of 30
businesses.
''The STRIDE project is designed to address two issues,'' explained
Catherine Alexander, director of the Institute of Technological
Management (ITM) at Heriot Watt University, which runs STRIDE with
financial backing from Glasgow Development Agency, Lothian &amp; Edinburgh
Enterprise, Forth Valley Enterprise, Scottish Enterprise and the
European Commission.
''Firstly, it gives small and medium-sized Scottish design and
manufacturing companies the ability to tap into the wealth of experience
at a cost which, in the open market place, they could simply not afford.
Secondly, it makes sure that years of invaluable experience gained by
the executives from large multi-national organisations in the defence
and hi-tech sector are not lost to the Scottish economy.''
At the same time as the EMA directors were considering the value of
STRIDE, Gerry Eglington had also applied to join the programme. With the
closure of Rosyth, he found himself unemployed for the first time in his
life. With his background, he was an ideal candidate.
He began his first six-month placement on the programme at EMA and
neither he nor the company have looked back since.
''Within months of Gerry coming on board, it became apparent to
everyone that he was bringing a new dimension to the business and the
way we operated,'' said Dave Stark.
The first thing Gerry found was that the company had not worked out a
satisfactory business plan, so he set about building on the work started
by Dave Stark, and addressed the primary element in the business plan --
the implementation of a quality system.
''If you follow the spirit of it and lay down a formal organisational
structure, giving everyone job descriptions and responsibility for the
job they do, and lay down procedures and monitor them so that they are
not just written down and put in a cupboard to gather dust, then you
have a reasoned, logical atmosphere in which to work,'' explained Gerry
Eglington.
Today the whole company is better organised, there is documentation
for all the jobs on the shop floor, for the sales orders, all the
aspects of ISO 9002 are in place. All the departments are working to a
standard and, equally importantly, interacting.
All of that needed a driver, someone with persistence. In fact, Gerry
had managed in a very short time what Dave had been trying to do for
years while still concentrating on his own area of work.
''Change is a very difficult thing to introduce to a company,
especially in a family business where we are all too close to be able to
take instructions from each other,'' said Dave.
It became clear that the company needed a full-time managing director
and when Gerry's six-month placement was finished, he was asked to stay
on as managing director, something that neither he nor the Starks had
anticipated at the initial stages.
''The job of the managing director is to run the company and everyone
in the company in that sense, reports to me, but are responsible for
their own positions,'' Gerry explained. ''I am responsible to the
shareholders of the company, so the three brothers continue to control
their own company. It was important then and it is important now.''
In a forward looking, innovative and extremely competitive business
like electronics, consistent change and improvement is vital. Gerry
recognised EMA's potential for growth.
''We now have the opportunity to expand the order book, to create more
employment, more revenue and more profit and everybody wins. That is my
vision for the company'' he said.
''We are not going to become a challenge to the multi-billion dollar
companies but we have found ourselves in a niche in Scotland -- most
Scottish electronics companies are either very small or very large.''
The revenue for the past three years has risen from around #1.4m to
#3.1m to #5m for the year just ended. The number of people employed has
also risen from around 50 to 90.
Last week, the company secured a #2m contract which has the potential
to rise in 18 months to between #6m and #8m. Over the past year, EMA has
also been working with a Glasgow company about to ''set the heather on
fire''.
''We will be their single manufacturing base,'' announced Dave. ''We
are comfortable now that we have the structures in place to be able to
accommodate all of that. There is a potential for a #15m-a-year
turnover.
The platform for development is in place now and with revenue rising,
we are likely to employ greater numbers. We look forward to steady,
stable growth.''

A minute's silence is held for Murray's family.
CHRIS Eubank yesterday announced he is to quit boxing -- but he
insisted that his decision had nothing to do with the tragic death of
Scottish fighter James Murray.
The 29-year-old fighter called a news conference at his home in Hove
to reveal that he is retiring after having lost his WBO
super-middleweight title to Steve Collins, who also beat him in their
re-match last month.
Before the conference, Eubank called for a minute's silence for the
family of Murray, who died yesterday after a title fight in Glasgow, but
he said: ''It is just an unfortunate coincidence.''
Eubank, who has dismantled the training ring at his home, declared:
''I have invested wisely and I am financially secure for life.
''There is life outside the ring and I feel the pressure is now off
me. I've been boxing since I was 16 and it's a hard life. I won't be
coming back.''
Eubank singled out his victory over Nigel Benn in 1990 as the high
spot of his career but he insisted he had no interest in remaining in
the sport as a manager.
He said he would be prepared to offer advice to young fighters, but
said his interests now would be channelled into a company he has formed
with businessman Rory McCarthy called Show Offs, which will specialise
in sports and fashion.
He continued: ''While I would have liked to retire as world champion,
I hope I will be remembered as the boxer who helped to change the face
of boxing -- someone who created real interest in the sport and who also
set standards so many others today aspire to.''
Eubank made his professional debut with a points win in Atlantic City
in October 1985. He also held the WBO middleweight title before moving
up a division. Apart from the two defeats by Collins, the other blots on
his record were draws against Ray Close and Nigel Benn. Eubank was
involved in the tragic fight with Michael Watson at Tottenham four years
ago which almost cost Watson his life.
Long-serving trainer Ronnie Davies said: ''We've had some marvellous
times and I'm obviously sad. Chris would have made a brilliant
light-heavyweight.
''But if he wants to retire, I will back his decision all the way.''
Barry Hearn, Eubank's former manager, said: ''I'm not surprised. Chris
always took the view that he was in it for a short time.
''It's a good decision. Whether he stays out of the ropes forever,
we'll have to wait and see.''
Eubank's earnings from a career of 21 WBO title fights were quite
probably in excess of #10m.
Almost all of that wealth came under the promotion and initially the
management of Hearn, whose wife Susan was the one to label Eubank
''Simply the Best'' -- hence his trademark ring entrance to the Tina
Turner hit.
''It was always going to be an end of an era, it had to come, and
Eubank's always made it quite clear that he's a businessman who boxes,''
said Hearn yesterday.
''And he's taken a view on a business level that there's other things
he'd rather be doing. We all wish him the very best of luck. It's a
dangerous sport.
''Eubank's called boxing a mug's game for years and perhaps from a
timing point of view with the tragedy of James Murray as well, it's an
understandable decision.
''Whether his lifestyle can be maintained through his business
activities, as he obviously intends it to be, remains to be seen.
''At this moment in time, he's the highest-earning British fighter of
all time. He's brought with him his own brand of charismatic pugilism,
the like of which we haven't seen before.
''In many ways, all of the fighters today who earn substantial livings
from professional boxing owe Chris Eubank, because he set the trend.
Chris has always been his own man. We had a great run together.
''Have we really seen the last of Eubank as a fighting man? I wouldn't
want to bet on it,'' added Hearn.
1966: Born Dulwich, August 8.
1985: First professional fight on October 3, when he beat Tim Brown on
points in Atlantic City. His first five pro fights were in America
before he returned to England.
1990: Won WBO middleweight title on November 18, stopping Nigel Benn
in the ninth at the NEC, Birmingham.
1991: Beat Michael Watson at Earls Court on June 22 with controversial
points decision which set up ill-fated re-match at White Hart Lane on
September 21 when both men stepped up a weight to contest the vacant WBO
super-middleweight crown. Watson is still partially paralysed and
confined to a wheelchair after being stopped by Eubank.
1993: Tenth successful defence with a re-match against Benn in front
of a 42,000 crowd at Old Trafford.
1994: Embarked on a Sky TV deal worth a reported #10m for eight fights
in 12 months.
1995: Unbeaten run ended on March 18 in fight No.44 fight -- his
fifteenth title defence -- when lost on points to Steve Collins in
County Cork.
After two comeback wins, he again lost on points to Collins in Cork on
September 9 in fight No.47.

CHRIS Eubank never pulled any punches -- inside or outside the ring.
The former WBO super-middleweight champion once described boxing as ''a
barbaric sport'' and has insisted all along: ''I'm in this game for
fortune, not fame.''
Born in Dulwich in 1966, the son of immigrant Jamaicans, Eubank and
his family spent some time living in New York in the early 1980s. After
doing the rounds of residential homes and approved schools, he rose
above his humble background and became an articulate, well-dressed man
in a sport not renowned for producing athletes with a high IQ.
His elder twin brothers, Simon and Peter, were both boxers and Peter
first brought fame to the family by beating Barry McGuigan.
Weighing 12st and standing 5ft 10in tall, Chris Eubank fought 47
times, winning 43, drawing two, and losing two -- but his career was
clouded by controversy.
He won the WBO middleweight title after a brutal contest against Nigel
Benn, in November 1990. But he did not prove to be the most popular
champion. His outward arrogance made him the man fans loved to hate.
Eubank always did just enough to hold on to his title, with the result
that many contests were close and the points decisions disputed.
The re-match with Michael Watson for the vacant WBO super-middleweight
title at White Hart Lane in September 1991 was to change the lives of
both fighters.
Watson, stopped in the final round, collapsed in the ring and was
taken to hospital. The London boxer underwent emergency surgery to
remove a blood clot from his brain and was then returned to a
life-support machine.
While Watson began his slow recovery, Eubank considered his future in
boxing. But, after months of speculation, he decided to carry on.
But he was never the same force, and his punching power was never as
savage. He was to have 17 more fights and some of his lacklustre points
wins brought scorn from the critics.
There was controversy when drew with Belfast's Ray Close in May 1994.
A shared verdict was also handed out when he met Benn again before
42,000 at Old Trafford in October 1994.
But the end was in sight. Irishman Steve Collins psyched him out of
his treasured title in March this year, his points win ending Eubank's
unbeaten record.
Two first-round wins in non-title fights hinted that Eubank was back
at his sharpest, but when he stepped into the ring for his return with
Collins in September he was again outsmarted and outpointed.

GOLF:
NOT before time, many will surely agree, and, it is to be hoped, with
some effect the first reference to ''slow play'' rather than ''undue
delay'' is to be introduced into the Rules of Golf among the 35
amendments to etiquette, definitions, and rules to take effect from
January 1 next year.
This welcome innovation emphasises an attempt by the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club and the United States Golf Association, the ruling authorities
for the game throughout the world, ''to increase the overall pace at
which the game is played.'' As an encouragement, they have granted
additional powers to committees which run events.
They may, in the conditions of a competition, lay down pace-of-play
guidelines whereby the penalty for a first offence may, in strokeplay,
be modified to one stroke from the two currently applicable under Rule
6-7 which addresses undue delay.
The reluctance of golf's authorities to apply the existing rule has
served only to incubate the blight of slow play which has increasingly
plagued the game over the last 30 years.

TENNIS
BRITAIN received a boost on the eve of the Brighton International
tournament when Samantha Smith qualified for the event with a 3-6, 6-3,
7-6 (7-4) victory over Germany's Wiltrud Probst.
The 23-year-old from Essex, playing her first major tournament since
the 1992 Olympic Games, displayed impressive resilience in the face of
some fine defensive play from her opponent.
But it was her superb forehand and some excellent backhand passes that
earned her victory.
Since graduating from Exeter University, Smith has been reaping the
benefits of coaching by Alan Jones and former British No.1 Jo Durie.
Elsewhere, American Katrina Adams overcame Nancy Feber of Belgium 6-3,
6-7 (5-7), 7-5, while Mariaan De Swardt of South Africa defeated
America's Nicole Arendt 6-3, 6-4.
The two winners will meet today for the right to face joint world No.1
and six-times winner of the Brighton tournament Steffi Graf tomorrow.
The German yesterday shrugged off the loss of a #675,000-a-year
sponsorship deal with car firm Adam Opel in the wake of a probe into her
tax affairs, by meeting pupils at Hove's Blatchington Mill School, which
is providing ball-girls for the tournament.

THE Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
joined in a new Europe-wide campaign to ban veal crates.
It claims that the current legislation on minimum standards for
rearing calves, about to revised in an EU directive, falls short of what
is required on physical, dietary and behavioural needs.
With other animal welfare groups throughout Europe the SSPCA wants the
forthcoming revised directive to ensure freedom from hunger, thirst and
malnutrition; as well as freedom from discomfort, disease and injury and
distress and fear.
''We are calling on the European Parliament and the UK Agriculture
Minister to ensure that the amended legislation will ban veal crates
throughout the European Union,'' said campaigns officer Pauline Mullin.

FORMER Melrose and Scotland winger Keith Robertson last night
presented his view of the future of Scottish rugby to the Melrose squad,
after having circulated Scotland's top clubs last week with an outline
discussion paper.
The Herald has obtained a copy of Robertson's draft document --
''Scottish Rugby -- The best way forward? by Keith Robertson October
1995'' -- and he is to meet SRU Director of Rugby Jim Telfer at
Murrayfield this afternoon to discuss his findings.
''I do not want to release details of anything yet because I want to
talk to Jim Telfer first,'' said Robertson. ''I also want to give the
clubs my findings, and I hope to be in a position to give presentations
to as many clubs as want me to , and I would hope to be presenting to
the South clubs very soon.''
His discussion paper has eight main objectives, among them retaining
what is best in Scottish rugby, retaining the country's top players,
bringing exiles to play their club and provincial rugby in Scotland,
increasing the numbers playing at all levels, increasing the number of
top-class players who are able to play international rugby, and
providing a spectacle that will increase the number of spectators.
Robertson He told the Herald that he has analysed the domestic
structure in depth, and he is confident that his radical proposals will
benefit the game which, in his opinion, has a need for change.
He also has identified eight areas of concern, ranging from payment to
players in the new ''Open Game'', to sponsorship, and whether clubs or
districts should play in Europe.
''I haven't read all of the details as there are 14 pages,'' said
Sandy Service, one of the coaches at West of Scotland. ''I look forward
to speaking to Keith about it, and I will be faxing him down my own
ideas.'' Watch this space.
* WASPS captain Dean Ryan has accepted a job alongside current
club-mate Rob Andrew as assistant director of rugby at second-division
Newcastle.
Andrew joined Newcastle last month in a deal reportedly worth #750,000
over five years but can start playing only in January -- unless the
four-month qualification rule is abolished. Ryan, 29, will join as a
player in February.
A former soldier, Ryan has won three England caps. The powerful
back-five forward said: ''My contract is for three years and the terms
are attractive enough for me to move home, family, and job to the
North-east. But that is not the sole reason. I want to be actively
involved beyond my playing days.''

ICE HOCKEY
PAUL Hand may have talked himself into cold storage after demanding a
whopping wage rise from Fife Flyers.
The defender slapped in a request for an extra #150-a-week from the
Kirkcaldy-based club on the eve of last weekend's Benson &amp; Hedges Cup
quarter-final with Newcastle Warriors.
But Flyers turned down his demands and the squad battled through to
the semi-finals on an 11-10 aggregate without the former Scottish
internationalist.
It now looks certain that Hand faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines
unless he can be traded or sold to another club.
Manager John Brady said: ''He came into my office and demanded an
extra #150 a week, saying he was working twice as hard as the rest of
them. That's not true.''
Hand could not be contacted yesterday.
Meanwhile, Flyers will face British champions Sheffield Steelers in
the semi-final of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup with the home-and-away ties
being played on October 28 and 29. The other semi-final, drawn in
Sheffield yesterday, matches Humberside Hawks against holders Nottingham
Panthers and their double-header is scheduled for November 4 and 5.

RUGBY UNION:
THE burning issue of Scottish representation in Europe will not be
resolved until an SRU working party comprising club representatives has
had a chance to examine the implications of the club versus district
alternatives.
Director of rugby Jim Telfer still favours the option of Scotland
being represented in the new European championship by district sides but
ultimately the decision may well be the end product of the union's
democratic process.
Telfer said yesterday: ''We are no further forward on Europe and won't
be until we have had meetings with the clubs which will take place in
the near future. A working party is being set up to look at how the
season has gone so far and that will also include the effect that the
European championship will have on the domestic game.
''To be honest, the subject is so complicated and there are so many
people operating to their own agendas that it's not something that we
want to debate in the media.
''However, my personal position is still the same. I favour districts.
I watched the South African Currie Cup final on television at the
weekend and although it was a dreadful day, there was a great
atmosphere. That's district rugby.
0 ''The entire game is in such a turmoil that it is incredibly
difficult to give a definitive view on almost anything.
''I do, though, have strong views on the district set-up.
''On the club scene, I don't think there is a complete team in
Scotland. Some of them have eight or nine players who make the grade but
the other six or seven are just making up the numbers.''
* THE Scotland players' agent Ian McLauchlan, SRU representatives, and
members of an SRU working party made up of lawyers, accountants, and
personnel experts drawn from the Scottish rugby community, met at
Murrayfield last night in an effort to hammer out a draft contract for
international squad members in time for the first Test of the season,
against Western Samoa on November 18.
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said: ''This is still at a very early
stage but we hope to have something in place by the end of the month.''
International Board representative Fred McLeod has said that, with
time now of the essence, it might be possible only to place the players
on an interim contract before the Western Samoan game, with further
discussions later.
* LAURIE Mains is to retire as New Zealand coach after the All Blacks'
forthcoming tour of Italy and France, where he plans to voice his
opposition to French nuclear testing in the Pacific. Mains has coached
New Zealand in 31 Tests since 1992, achieving 21 victories, one draw,
and nine defeats.
* NEW Zealand have given Scotland a demanding travelling schedule in
the build-up to the two-match Test series next year. After an opening
match against third-division Wanganui the Scots have to travel the
length of the two islands for successive games against Northland,
Waikato, and Southland -- 900 miles from Whangerei to Invercargill.
Waikato, while coached by Kevin Greene, now with Glasgow Academicals,
trounced the 1993 Lions by 38-10 in Hamilton, though this year the
province could finish only sixth in New Zealand's first-division
championship.
Scotland's match against Wanganui will be the first they will have
played under floodlights in New Zealand. The Northland game in Whangerei
also will be a floodlight match.

ANGUS farmer Alistair Skene has beaten 15,000 Scottish wool producers
to win the regional Wool Producer of the Year award for the second year
running. He runs 1000 Blackface ewes at Blackcraigs in Glenesk, with his
son Fraser and says the success depends on getting the right quality ram
which influences the shape of the lamb and the type of wool. On the
farm, which rises to 2500 feet and is used primarily as a grouse moor,
only young ewes free from black fibres and kemp are kept for breeding
and older ewes are culled once wool quality deteriorates. Mr Skene

<HEADLINE>Growth in outdoor pig production may tail off</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>VIC ROBERTSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE rapid growth in outdoor pig production in recent years looks like
slowing down.
Industry economics, climate, the limited supply of the right kind of
ground and lack of management ability together with changing views on
animal welfare benefits are all playing a part.
PIC, probably the biggest supplier of outdoor type sows on the British
market, forecasts continued growth but has revised these forecasts
downwards.
In early 1994, the company was predicting that 28% of the national
herd would be kept outdoors by this year with a target of 40% by the
year 2000. It now thinks the current figure is between 22% and 25% with
a figure of between 25% and 40% in 2000.
Even the unilateral ban on stalls and tethers by 1999, which will have
a major impact on intensive indoor systems, is not expected to change
this scenario greatly.
''The growth of outdoor pig units is controlled by other issues such
as the availability of the right kind of land and climate and by the
supply of skilled stockmanship,'' says PIC marketing executive John
Griffiths. ''We would advise producers to undertake outdoor production
only when all the elements are there.''
However, the case against outdoor production on welfare grounds has
been growing steadily. A year ago, Dr Sandra Edwards and a team from SAC
Aberdeen published a paper highlighting increased piglet mortality in
outdoor breeding herds.
At last month's British Veterinary Association Congress, East Anglian
vet John MacKinnon, president of the Pig Veterinary Society, threw more
cold water on the system, not only for the pigs but for their keepers,
who he said were more like shepherds because they had to be outside in
all weathers.
Not only was productivity lower with outdoor systems but the sows were
subject to additional stress factors such as the extremes of weather
seen during the summer. There were also problems with water supply in
extreme conditions of drought and freezing, increased predation by
foxes, higher disease risk through vermin including seagulls which fed
on sewage, and panic caused by hot air balloons and low flying
helicopters. Low flying planes were not a problem.
He pointed out that sows needed about 20 gallons of water each a day
for drinking and wallowing. They were also prone to sunburn, stress and
hypothermia, he said.
This year's winner of the David Black Award for contributions towards
the improvement of pig farming, Dr Jane Guise of JMA Cambac Research,
has also raised some question marks, particularly over management.
''It is much easier to care for the pig in a shed than in the field,''
she said. ''The level of care in intensive units is very high.''
A Cambac survey of outdoor systems, involving 77 herds and more than
30,000 breeding sows, highlighted a number of problem areas particularly
fox predation, water supply, lameness, aggression and pre-weaning
mortality in piglets.
This has resulted in Ministry of Agriculture grants for two new
research projects which are about to get underway. These will look at
problems associated with lameness and with stocking density and its
effect on soil and water.

EDINBURGH Oil and Gas has acquired a shareholding in another two
onshore fields which are estimated to add 15% to its proven reserves.
The company, one of the UK's largest onshore acreage holders, has
taken a 25% holding in the Storrington field in West Sussex and a 17.5%
share in the Albury field in Surrey, from Brabant Petroleum at a cost of
#460,000.
The undeveloped recoverable reserves attributed to the new fields are
estimated to be 350,000 barrels of oil.
Alf Bissett, managing director of Edinburgh Oil and Gas, said: ''The
company is continuing its progress and the increased cashflow from
production is financing an active exploration and development

SCOTTISH Industry Minister George Kynoch last night urged the
country's engineering and electronics firms to double their efforts in
export markets. At the same time he called on small companies to broaden
their horizons and look for new markets abroad.
Addressing a dinner of the executive committee of Scottish
Engineering, a trade organisation representing 350 engineering
companies, at Glasgow's Copthorne Hotel, Mr Kynoch said: ''I am
absolutely convinced that in order for our economy to continue its
improving path, and for companies large and small to flourish, we must
seek improvements to our export activities.''
Earlier in the day at a lunch in Edinburgh Mr Kynoch addressed the
Scottish division of the Institute of Directors, when he spoke of
massive job losses in some industries and big improvements in others,
caused by economic dynamism.
He said the rundown in the steel, shipbuilding and textile sectors had
resulted in 150,000 job losses between 1950 and 1992, with an overall
reduction of 250,000 manufacturing jobs between 1979 and 1994.
Between 1950 and 1992 jobs in the electronics industry had increased
from 10,000 to more than 41,000 and the total ''was still rising''.
He pointed out that Scotland now produced:
* 11% of Europe's semi-conductors
* more than 35% of its personal computers
* over 50% of the Continent's automated banking machines
* nearly 60% of workstations.
He praised the financial and business sector, describing it as ''one
of international standing''.
He also pointed out that around 180,000 people, about 8% of the
Scottish workforce, were employed in tourism which attracted more than
nine million visitors a year and had enormous potential for attracting
more.
However, he stressed: ''Training is, of course, a key element. It is
vital that our present and future workforce is equipped with the skills
and specialist knowledge to enable Scotland to compete in international
markets.''
He also warned on the dangers of devolution and claimed it would be
bad for business, saying: ''Devolution and independence would put at
great risk what Scotland has gained from the UK's membership of the
European Union.''
At last night's dinner in Glasgow he called on companies to strive
towards opening up export markets and said: ''We must seek improvements
to our export activities.''
He told the gathering that in 1993 Scotland's electronics, engineering
and allied industries exported #6400m worth of goods, 55% of the
country's total manufactured exports.
But he urged: ''We can and must do better. I want export values to
nearly double in the next five years. We are on course to do that. But
to meet future challenges and seize the opportunities for Scottish
companies, we must work to improve export performance.''
He added: ''Our main aim must be to encourage more companies to
export. Exporting is not just for the big boys. Many of small and medium
sized companies are already competing on the world stage and discovering
markets that are highly profitable.''
But sounding a note of caution he said: ''I was surprised to learn
from a DTI survey on companies in the mechanical engineering industry
that between a third and a half do not carry out any form of marketing,
whether at home or abroad.''

THE brewers of award-winning Skullsplitter Beer have given themselves
a real headache. The beer has become so successful they have had to call
time on their island home and move 250 miles away on the Scottish
mainland.
Roger and Irene White are the victims of the runaway success of their
Orkney Brewery and its range of traditional beers Skullsplitter, Dark
Island, Raven Ale, Dragon's Head and Red MacGregor.
The couple are in the process of moving to Perthshire to be nearer
mainland markets.
But Britain's most northerly brewery will continue at Quoyloo,
Sandwick, on Orkney's mainland, where it gives work to eight people.
As they packed their bags yesterday Roger White, a former civil
engineer from Gloucester, said: ''When we started the brewery in l987 it
was only to keep me semi-employed. But it really took off and now we are
paying the price for our success.
''We are moving south to be nearer our markets. It is sad to be
leaving the isles, but we will always keep a base on Orkney.''
The Whites moved to Orkney 15 years ago for the quiet life, but the
brewery, which produces 3600 gallons a week, has put paid to that dream.
''But we are not complaining,'' Roger White said as he prepared to
move to their new home near Alyth, Perthshire.
The brewhouse's output is now sold widely throughout Britain, while
the couple are building up overseas markets for their bottled varieties.

<HEADLINE>Klinsmann knows all about the wee Rovers' cup feats. Attack the best form of defence</HEADLINE>

LIKE most of the major European star footballers, Jurgen Klinsmann not
only gets things right on the field but has a knack of saying what is
required off it.
The Bayern Munich striker became unofficial club spokesman at
Edinburgh airport yesterday as his team arrived for their meeting with
Raith Rovers at Easter Road tonight, partly because he is the biggest
name in the squad but also because he was the only one who willingly
allowed the massed media gang some of his time.
It was not difficult to see why this charismatic man has been such a
success wherever he has played, even if his former Tottenham chairman,
Alan Sugar, seems to take a different stance.
Klinsmann, in flawless English, made all the right sounds about the
wee Rovers, how they would be given due respect and how they must be
taken seriously at this stage in the UEFA Cup. He did surprise us,
however, by insisting that he had known about the team from Kirkcaldy
long before they came out of the hat for this second-round tie.
''When I was with Tottenham I kept up with Scottish football,'' he
said, ''and I can remember watching Raith Rovers beat Celtic in the
Coca-Cola Cup final. They may not be one of the best known teams
internationally, but any team that gets this far in Europe has to be
respected.''
His own experience of British football will no doubt prove valuable to
his team-mates tonight, but if things go as the Rovers manager, Jimmy
Nicholl, plans, he will see the old-style, sock-it-to-them version,
rather than the more studied fashion gaining popularity.
Nicholl believes he must ask his team to play like his old Northern
Ireland national side did on occasions, a method that will settle for
speed and directness rather than the slow build-up.
''We can't afford to play a thousand passes while they sit back and
let us get on with it,'' he said. ''There is no point trying to beat
them at their own game. We have to let them know they are in a tie, get
in about them and try to upset them.''
The man whose career as the Fife manager seems to continue on its
upward graph, however daunting the prospects, acknowledges that this is
the toughest yet and at heart just wants his side to finish the night
with self respect intact and a result that keeps their interest still
alive for the return in Munich.
He needed some persuasion by his assistant, Martin Harvey, before
agreeing to put Saturday's 4-2 defeat by Hearts down to the players'
preoccupation with this tie, but now he reluctantly accepts that it was
the case. For that reason, most of the side that let him down will be
back in their positions tonight.
''I suppose it is hard to blame them, because this is the biggest game
most of them have ever played in their lives,'' he said. ''I am sure you
will see a different team from Saturday. They will be made aware of the
job they have to do, and if their personality doesn't suit the job, then
they won't be in.
''The major factors for them will be fear of letting themselves, the
supporters and the club down. It will need every ounce of concentration
they have. They know they are taking on the Klinsmanns of this world and
they know how good they are.
''We won't be playing the cat and mouse game that Germans like. What
we want is make them think: this is going to be harder than we thought.
''The atmosphere will be great and the last thing we want is to lose
by three or four goals and make the second leg academic. If we get a 1-0
or even a no-scoring result we could travel with hope.''
His main hope is that Bayern will be vastly over-confident. However,
Klinsmann seems sure that this will not be the case. ''We are confident,
but we must wait and see how the game goes tomorrow before we work out
what to do in the next leg,'' he said.
The German, who is likely to be partnered by Frenchman Jean-Pierre
Papin -- and does that sound a formidable double act? -- said that
Bayern have done their homework about the Fifers and added: ''We will
talk about them over our next couple of team meetings.''
Even though Bayern have lost their last two games, by 3-1 to Borussia
Dortmund and 2-0 to Borussia Munchengladbach, the striker refused to
concede that the stories of unrest within the camp had caused problems
on the field.''We have the same problems that any team with maybe 14 or
15 top players has. When the manager leaves some out they are unhappy.
That is always the case. We have lost two games, but we are still top of
the Bundesliga.''
The feeling of general manager Uli Hoeness was that the two recent
defeats and the aggression inside the dressing room might result in a
hard time for Rovers, but when players like Ally Graham, who has made it
to this great day via places like Cliftonhill, are given this chance to
sample the big-time they are inclined to play beyond anything they have
managed to date.
It will need that if the most remarkable wee club in the country is to
produce its most astonishing show yet.
''Just think,'' said Nicholl, as much to himself as us, ''Raith Rovers
could be the talk of Europe by tomorrow night. What a thought that is.''
We will not put serious money on it, but we are all allowed to dream,
are we not?

MANAGER Roy Aitken yesterday admitted that Aberdeen are not serious
championship contenders this season. His frank assessment came after the
latest defeat at Motherwell which left his side languishing eight points
behind Rangers in the title race.
Aitken aid: ''We are not ready to say we will be champions yet.
Expectations must be realistic. It is a rebuilding job at the moment,
which will take time to achieve.
''We have had a setback, but at this stage I'm more concerned about
performances than results. I have spoken to the players and told them
they had fallen below what I expect. The bottom line is that they didn't
work hard enough and the desire was not there.''
Despite the slump Aitken, with more than a million pounds from the
Dons share issue, has ruled out a transfer swoop to cover injured
defender Colin Woodthorpe, who will be missing for six weeks with a
broken foot. ''I am constantly looking for new players to improve our
squad,'' said the manager, ''but in this case I have options to cover
the situation.''
Captain Stewart McKimmie, striker Scott Booth and midfielder Stephen
Glass are also injured, but are expected to recover for the match with
Partick Thistle on Saturday.
Aberdeen will tonight meet Ross County at Dingwall to open their new
stand.
* MORTON manager Allan McGraw confirmed yesterday that Dundee United's
offer of #300,000 for Derek McInnes has been rejected.
* ARBROATH tonight will offer cut-price football for their supporters.
The Gayfield club will charge adults #4 for the rescheduled third
division match against Queen's Park which was abandoned 14 minutes from
time on Saturday because of fog.
* CAMEROON keeper Andre Boe will make his first appearance tonight for

CELTIC were put on the alert last night after a series of reports from
Paris warned that tickets for their European Cup-winners' Cup game
against Paris St Germain on Thursday were being sold freely in the
French capital.
Club spokesman Peter McLean said: ''This is a matter of genuine
concern for the club. We have heard these reports and are trying to
ascertain just how tickets are being sold by Paris St Germain.''
Yesterday, a colleague in Paris told me: ''There is absolutely no
problem buying tickets for the game. I know a friend from Scotland who
went into a city store at the end of last week and bought six tickets
for people who are coming over for the game.
''Basically, the match is not going to be a sell-out and the various
outlets around the city are happy to get rid of the tickets without
asking questions about which team you support.''
The major worry for Celtic is that UEFA have already labelled the
match as high risk because of previous problems with PSG supporters at
the Parc des Princes.
There has been a record of violence from a group of the Paris club's
fans and this has been highlighted by the European soccer authorities.
When Arsenal played the French side in the same tournament two seasons
ago, there was trouble between rival fans. There was a similar problem
then with ticket distribution.
The recommendations from UEFA are that visiting clubs receive an
allocation according to their needs and all tickets are for one area of
the ground.
Celtic have received more than 3000 tickets and are distributing them
through a single travel agent who has demanded full personal details
from everyone buying one so that troublemakers can be identified.
If tickets are sold without these precautions then trouble could
follow.
Celtic have already pointed out the problem to the Paris club.
Security chief George Douglas held talks with PSG's ticket manager at
the weekend and stressed the dangers.
He was given assurances that all ticket sales would be monitored but
the giant FNAC record outlets are, apparently, selling tickets freely to
fans of either side.
Said McLean: ''We can only ask Celtic supporters not to buy tickets
from anyone other than our own approved agency and warn them that if
they have tickets for parts of the ground reserved for the home support
they may not get into the match.
''The police have said that there will be massive security around the
ground. Riot police will be on duty a fair distance from the Parc des
Princes and will examine every ticket.
''The last thing we want to see are Celtic supporters herded into a
pen by police, which is what happened to Arsenal fans when they were
involved in a match here.
''We cannot warn the supporters strongly enough. Celtic have a
marvellous reputation across the Continent for the behaviour of their
supporters and we do not want that to change in Paris.''
As PSG were held to a 0-0 draw against Lyon at the weekend, hundreds
of their fans were involved in fighting with rival fans and their own
club stewards. This was their third game without a win and the hooligan
element in their support could take no more. Riot police were called in
to quell the disturbances.
That is the kind of news Celtic did not welcome last night as word of
the ticket problem grew.
On the football front, manager Tommy Burns remains convinced that
skipper Paul McStay will return to the European stage and hopes that
Tosh McKinlay, a key player at this level, also will be ready.
Jackie McNamara, the club's most recent signing, will drop out because
he joined the club from Dunfermline after the signing deadline had
passed.

IT was not the blaze of glory Dario Franchitti had in mind when his
silver Mercedes erupted in flames at Hockenheim while leading Sunday's
final round of the German Touring Car Championship.
The packed ranks of spectators crowding the terraced banks of the
track near Heidelberg shared Franchitti's frustration. Not only because
a beloved Merc was kaput, but because a fair proportion of them root for
the young man whose name implies his home town should be Milan or Turin
rather than Whitburn, West Lothian.
Franchitti did not derive much, if any, consolation from his early
departure from the race except that it was another technical failure, or
circumstances beyond his control, which cost him a top-three
championship position.
It is testimony to his expectations that the 22-year-old Scot has been
a serious contender for victory in one of the highest profile
championships below the grand prix stratosphere.
A professional driver since early 1991, when he qualified for a full
driving licence only days before his debut race courtesy of a test
cancellation, Franchitti's rise to the front rank has been inexorable.
In the guiding hands of father-and-son tutors Davids Leslie, senior
and junior, Franchitti stormed to outright honours in the inaugural
Formula Vauxhall Junior championship, sealing the title with a hat trick
of wins.
Where David Coulthard was to lead Franchitti followed as a product of
the Leslie kindergarten, and then on to the Jackie Stewart college of
upward mobility. Up a grade in speed and technical sophistication to
Formula Vauxhall Lotus, 1992 witnessed a less vertical climb with no
wins and fourth in that championship.
He concedes that success perhaps came too early and quickly, but the
following year Franchitti dominated the Vauxhall Lotus proceedings with
six wins as he adapted to the different driving style involved with
treadless slick tyres and critical wing settings.
With Stewart's corporate sponsorship backing, including The Herald's
support, Franchitti moved onwards and upwards into the sink or swim
Formula Three arena last year. He was eclipsed by team-mate Jan
Magnussen, a mercurial and diminutive Dane, but objective onlookers
suggested that the Scot drew the short straw when it came to engines.
Stewart was willing and able to give his protege another tilt at the
F3 title this year, but Franchitti raised eyebrows by putting pen to
paper on a Mercedes touring car contract.
Magnussen also signed for the crack AMG-run team, but with the F3
trophy on his mantelpiece, he appeared to be in a stronger position.
With the same machinery the Scot has frequently outperformed the
Scandinavian, even if both Mercedes' junior drivers were beaten to the
DTM crown by former F1 veteran Bernd Schneider.
Schneider paid Franchitti the ultimate team-mate's accolade by rating
him as his most feared rival this season.
Last Friday Franchitti signed for a second term with the Germans for a
pounds sterling fee likely to involve at least five noughts.
Meanwhile, towards the end of this year he will cross paths with
countryman Coulthard as both men test the F1 McLaren-Mercedes in Spain.
For Coulthard it will be a chance to familiarise himself with his 1996
grand prix challenger. For Franchitti it will be an introduction to F1
power and perhaps future F1 glory.
''I enjoy touring car racing and I've always been lucky enough to race
for top-flight organisation, so unless F1 is possible with a leading
team I don't see me taking the risk,'' reasons the pragmatic Scot.
Nevertheless he has had several interesting conversations with F1
emissaries, including one Italian organisation whose cars are scarlet.
Franchitti and Ferrari has a ring to it.

Smith's players will have to reach new heights of achievement in Turin
if they are to negotiate safely their journey which begins from Glasgow
this morning.
WALTER Smith was due a break. He had returned from a flying visit to
Italy where he watched Juventus play against AC Milan and was in time to
explain to the SFA his conduct during a recent premier division match.
Then he had to look at his injured players -- Paul Gascoigne, Brian
Laudrup, Charlie Miller, and Ian Ferguson -- and wonder what the future
held.
The Rangers manager, who will have trouble presenting a potent threat
to the Italian champions in the Stadio Delle Alpi tomorrow night because
of injuries to these key players and the suspension of one other, Alan
McLaren, was beginning to think the fates had turned against him.
However, news from Turin last night may have convinced him that he has
not been forsaken completely. Gianluca Vialli's misfortune could be
Smith's lucky break.
The Juventus captain, who cost #12m when bought from Sampdoria almost
three-and-a-half-years ago, was taken off just after half-time in the
game against Milan on Sunday and his thigh injury will not clear up in
time for him to play against Rangers in the Champions' League match.
Also, Vialli's front line accomplice, Fabrizio Ravanelli, is racing
against time to be fit.
He hobbled off in the San Siro at the same time as Vialli, who will be
out for a week, also suffering from a muscle strain but he is determined
to play. In fact, he says he will take a pain-killing injection if
necessary.
''The Champions' League is our priority this season and with Rangers
missing a few of their better players this is an opportunity to make
sure we qualify for the final stages,'' Ravanelli said. ''I am prepared
to play even if I am not fully fit.''
His determination to take part is typical of the spirit which has been
rekindled within the Juventus squad as a consequence of the 2-1 defeat
in Milan where they had to endure the jeers and taunts of the San Siro's
regulars. Juventus played poorly in the first half and dropped two goals
behind after only 14 minutes.
They performed much better in the second half with Alessandro Del
Piero scoring late in the game, but the defeat pained them deeply as
their keeper, Angelo Peruzzi, attempted to explain. ''We have been given
back some of our humility.
''We were all beginning to think we were like gods because recently we
had received only praise for our wonderful play. Milan have reminded us
what can happen when you believe more than is true.''
Yet, ironically, several Rangers players may have to be convinced they
are better than they actually are because, even though Juventus have
lost one of the most complete players in European football, in Vialli
they remain formidable. Smith's players will have to reach new heights
of achievement in Turin if they are to negotiate safely their journey
which begins from Glasgow this morning.
Marcello Lippi, the Juventus coach, had some harsh words for his
players and his anger was still simmering yesterday. ''If we play like
we did in the first half in Milan we will lose to Rangers also,'' he
said.
''We lost our positive mentality. It was a terrible Juventus that
everyone saw.''
Lippi added that another Champions' League match so soon after defeat
should be enough to bring out the best in his side, which is likely to
discard the favoured 4-3-3 formation for 4-4-2 in the absence of Vialli.
Still, a twin strike-force of Ravanelli and Del Piero is a powerful
weapon. After all, it was the emergence of Del Piero, who will be 21
next month, which encouraged Juventus to sell Roberto Baggio to Milan at
the end of last season.
Antonio Conte, who went on when Vialli departed on Sunday, will remain
in the midfield line, probably along with Paolo Sosa, Angelo Di Livio,
and Didier Deschamps. It is in Rangers' favour, of course, that Lippi
has been unable to use Vladimir Jugovic and Attilio Lombardo because of
injury, yet Smith suspects it may still require a performance of
extraordinary courage to subdue Juventus. They have already beaten
Borussia Dortmund away and Steaua Bucharest at home but feel they must
regain pride which was lost on Sunday.
Andy Goram, Richard Gough, and Gordan Petric, who have been the
inspiration for Rangers so far, face their most significant test. It
will be up to them, and probably Craig Moore to deal with the threat of
Juventus because, as Smith says, the Italians must be beaten.
''We must be looking to take three points from them, three more from
Steaua at Ibrox, and then maybe a draw against Borussia in Germany,''
the manager said. ''I know how that sounds, but it can be done.
''I still say the margin for error in European competition is slight
even though people make sweeping judgments comparing our game to the
European. The smallest things can make the biggest differences.
''We could have come out of Bucharest with a draw and no-one could
have grudged us a win against Dortmund. Instead, we have only one
point.''
Like Lippi, the Ibrox manager has reached the stage of dismissing
injury problems preferring to dwell on the positive and he takes heart
from the fact that his team are difficult to beat. They can take a lot
of punishment and are liable to hit back as they did against Aberdeen
recently.
Smith had to play at least seven who are defenders and the same will
have to be done tomorrow. ''I think, though, that we have a bit more
resilience than some people think,'' Smith said.
''Defenders have been our most influential players so far and the
likes of Gough and Goram have given everyone else confidence.''

STRIKERS Oleg Salenko and Ally McCoist were given fitness clearance at
Ibrox yesterday and this morning both will be in the 18-strong group of
players who will fly out to Turin for the Champions' League showdown
with Juventus.
It remains to be seen which of these two players manager Walter Smith
will start the game with, but my money is on the Russian
internationalist with McCoist, who made the briefest of appearances at
Firhill as a substitute at the weekend, remaining on the bench.
Smith did not concern himself with pre-match excuses yesterday as he
was asked about the injuries which will leave him without Brian Laudrup,
Paul Gascoigne, Ian Ferguson, and Charlie Miller for the crucial Italian
job the Scottish champions face tomorrow night.
Instead, Smith looked at the positive aspects of his selection
problems and pointed out: ''I won't have to lose too much sleep this
time over the three foreigners' rule which has been a real dilemma in
the past. There are only four foreign payers listed in the pool and two
of them, Gordan Petric and Craig Moore, will both play.
''That leaves it as a straight choice between Oleg Salenko and Alexei
Mikhailichenko. There are no alternatives. I have to look at the way I
have had to do in other games this season. Losing Laudrup and Gascoigne
has been a blow, but it has meant fewer complications in my mind over
the team choice.
''For example, Moore goes in as a straight replacement for Alan
McLaren, which allows us to leave Stephen Wright in his usual position
and causes the minimum of adjustment to a defensive set-up which has
looked so solid for us so far.
''I don't have any worries about Moore going in alongside Petric and
Richard Gough because, after all, that is his original position. It was
as a centre-half that we signed the boy, but we have been forced to play
him out of position most of the time.''
Salenko will relish a return to the European stage and the European
style. The Russian has impressed more and more with each match in the
frantic atmosphere of the premier division.
In the more studied approach of the Continent he could blossom and his
reputation will precede him to Turin.
McCoist, in any case, has shown his value in stepping from the bench
this season for both Rangers and Scotland and that may linger in the
back of Smith's mind as he looks towards this game.
There has to be the hope in the Ibrox camp that they can snatch a goal
and maintain a challenge in their Champions' League group.
McCoist and Salenko carry that threat, as does Gordon Durie after his
Firhill hat trick.
Smith must marshal his forces well for this vital game and that is
what will be occupying his mind between now and the game.
Yesterday, the Ibrox manager was censured by the SFA for remarks made
to referee Kenny Clark after the 1-0 defeat the Ibrox side suffered at
home to Hibs.
The Edinburgh team's manager, Alex Miller, was given the same warning
for a similar offence.
But lower league managers, Tom Steven, of Cowdenbeath, and Billy
Kirkwood, of Dundee United, were dealt with more severely.
Both were fined #500 after a touchline bust-up when their respective
clubs met earlier in the season.
The Rangers players who will travel to Italy are:
Goram, Thomson, Scott, Petric, Gough, Moore, Wright, Robertson,
Cleland, McCall, Durrant, Murray, Bollan, Brown, Durie, McCoist,
Salenko, Mikhailichenko.

BRITISH driver Richard Burns starred on the third day of the Hong
Kong-Beijing Rally, setting three fastest times and one second-fastest
during the five stages run.
Burns could easily have set a fourth-fastest, only to overshoot a
junction on the last stage of the day which forced him to turn around,
but he still finished only nine seconds behind the stage winner.
''The car is going very well and I'm now driving as hard as I can,''
said Burns, who maintained fourth place in his Subaru Impreza 555, just
4min 4sec behind Swedish leader Kenneth Eriksson.
''I think I am back to the pace I was on three months ago. It's a long
rally and we are now putting pressure on the front-runners to try to
take advantage if they make an error.''
With more than half of the event still to run, New Zealander Possum
Bourne was also impressive with times close to those of Burns, despite
the fact that he was rallying on unfamiliar territory.
Four of yesterday's stages were new and the drivers had only one
chance to drive over them prior to the start. Leading positions:
1, K Eriksson (Sweden), Mitsubishi, 2hr 6min 29sec; 2, A Vatanen
(Finland), Mitsubishi, 2-07-41; 3, P Bourne (New Zealand), Subaru,
2-08-59; 4, R Burns (Britain), Subaru, 2-10-33; 5, Y Fujimoto (Japan),
Toyota, 2-15-34.

BRAZILIAN driver Marco Campos was declared clinically dead in a Paris
hospital yesterday after a crash in a Formula 3000 race.
The 19-year-old European Formula Opel Euroseries champion suffered
severe head injuries when his Lola Cosworth hit Italian Thomas Biagi's
Reynard on the final lap at the Magny Cours circuit on Sunday.
Luis Pinto of Campos's Draco team said the driver was being kept alive
with a respirator pending a decision by his family.

JOHN Parrott, who captured the Thailand Classic in Bangkok this month,
lost in the first round of the Skoda Grand Prix in Sunderland yesterday.
The Liverpudlian lost five frames in a row to crash 5-2 to Dave
Finbow. Worcester's world No.47 has won 11 of 13 matches this season and
meets Steve James for a place in the televised phase next week.
Parrott said: ''When Dave went 4-2 ahead, I pushed the button for some
fight but there was no petrol in the tank. Dave is a very capable
player, so in that respect it's not so big a shock as you might think.''
In another upset, No.13 seed Dave Harold was beaten 5-2 by Matthew
Stevens, a promising 17-year-old from Carmarthen.
Former world champion Joe Johnson reached the second round -- a month
after undergoing heart surgery. The 1986 winner at Sheffield recorded a
5-2 victory over his predecessor as world champion, Northern Ireland's
Dennis Taylor.
John Higgins began the defence of his title with a convincing 5-1
victory over Mark Davis. The 20-year-old Scot, who won last year's event
as a 125-1 outsider, fired in breaks of 53, 124, and a clinching 44
clearance.
First-round results:J Higgins (Sco) beat M Davis (Eng) 5-1; J Johnson
(Eng) beat D Taylor (N Ire) 5-2; S James (Eng) beat Q Hann (Aus) 5-4; J
Ferguson (Eng) beat S Reardon (Eng) 5-3; D Finbow (Eng) beat J Parrott

Scotland 34, Russia 9
SKIPPER Alan Tait and wing Ally Blee each grabbed two tries as
Scotland began their bid to win the Emerging Nations World Cup at
Featherstone.
Two tries came in the opening seven minutes. Centre Jim How broke two
tackles, Charlie McAllister added the goal points, then set up a try for
Tait with a dummy, and again converted.
The Scots were unsettled after a try was disallowed. A spilled
up-and-under gave centre Victor Machaev an easy chance and two minutes
later stand-off Andrey Schlegov dropped a goal.
Scotland replied with a McAllister penalty but before the break winger
Alexander Otradnov dived over.
Veteran Hugh Waddell went in under the posts for McAllister to
convert, then Blee sidestepped in for a try.
Another Scottish try was chalked off but man-of-the-match Blee and
Tait each breezed over, with sub Graham Thompson converting.
Scotland manager John Risman said: ''It all came right in the end, but
we made too many handling errors in the first half.''
Cook Islands ran in 11 tries as they crushed USA 64-6 in the same
qualifying group. Ireland beat Moldova 48-26 in the three-team Group B.

BANK of Scotland treasurer Peter Burt has been appointed to the
Treasury's City Promotion Panel, which is charged with ensuring the
long-term competitive strength of the UK's financial services industry
on the world stage.
The group, under the chairmanship of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, was
born out of the need to co-ordinate overseas marketing of the UK's
financial expertise through a single agency and thus avoid duplication
of effort among various institutions and businesses. It met for the
first time yesterday.
Mr Burt's appointment by the Chancellor is a recognition of the
strength of Scotland's financial community, which is by far the biggest
in the UK outside London.
Anxious not to do down the importance of the financial services
industry in Edinburgh and Glasgow, a Treasury official said: ''The
Chancellor is only using (the term) City because it is shorter than UK
financial institutions.''
More than 200,000 people are employed in the financial services
industry north of the Border -- more than one in 10 of Scotland's
working population.
In terms of funds under management, Scotland ranks third in the
European Union behind London and Paris.
Scottish Financial Enterprise executive director Grant Baird revealed
yesterday that his organisation, which promotes the Scottish financial
community, had told the Bank of England and the Treasury that it
believed an expert from north of the Border should sit on the panel.
He said: ''Our view was that we didn't want a ghetto-type Scottish
representative but a major practitioner in his own right who happened to
be based in Scotland -- that seems to sum up Peter pretty well.''
Mr Burt, who missed the panel's inaugural meeting as a result of a
prior engagement in Edinburgh, said he would, from a practitioner's
standpoint, highlight areas where improvements could be made and where
obstacles, particularly unintended obstacles such as red tape, could be
eliminated.''
Pointing out that Britain's financial services sector was the leader
in Europe, and in the top three worldwide, Mr Clarke said: ''I want to
ensure that we continue to head the field.''
The panel also includes Trade Minister Anthony Nelson, Bank of England
Governor Eddie George, the Lord Mayor of London, Grand Metropolitan
chairman Lord Sheppard, who represents the promotional body London
First, Prudential chief executive Peter Davis and Reuters chief
executive Peter Job.
Among the matters considered by yesterday's meeting was whether some
form of ''over-arching branding'', including a new symbol, was needed.

WAYWARD golfers beware. A study has shown that those who venture into
the rough are more liable to contract serious tick-borne infections than
those who don't.
This discovery is revealed in a recent edition of the New England
Medical Journal following research on golf-orientated retirement
communities in eastern Tennessee, where there has been a significant
number of cases.
The highest rate of disease was found in a community which had a
fenceless boundary with a wildlife park. Golfers were twice as likely
than non-golfers to develop the infection -- and the risk increased the
higher the scores of the players.
Those most at risk were 100-plus shooters, who routinely retrieved
balls from the woods and did not use insect repellent.
Most notably, four cases were reported in a single week in June, 1993.
The victims, all men, suffered severe headaches, vomiting and abdominal
pains. One went into a coma, but all survived.
The research team warn that their discoveries may be of more than
local concern. They report: ''This outbreak reflects a more global
phenomenon brought about when humans have disrupted a local habitat. It
is probable that the increased encroachment of susceptible humans into
wildlife environments has led to focal increases in the incidence of the
disease.''
Wildlife were also examined, namely 16 white-tailed deer, 12 raccoons,
four opossums, two red foxes, a skunk, and a groundhog. With a few
exceptions, each animal was found to be home to 100 or more ticks of a
kind that were found along the edges of the fairways. One exception was
the groundhog, which was tick-free.
Well, as Bill Murray well knows, every groundhog has its day.
* IN an exercise of military precision, Paisley defeated Cochrane
Castle 72-62 in a 100-a-side match involving both courses.
Those of an arithmetical bent will immediately notice a discrepancy.
The match was over-subscribed at 134 a side, but as it was to mark two
centenaries, with one player representing each year of each club, this
fact can be happily overlooked.
At Cochrane Castle, the host club won 39-29, but home advantage was
hammered home at Paisley with a 43-23 outcome.
Communications were kept open between the two clubs throughout the day
as the match progressed, and Paisley became undisputed winners with
several matches unconcluded. Simultaneous presentations took place in
the evening.
* CARDROSS member Jim Hanning has won the final of the club matchplay
foursomes 44 years after he first won it as a 19-year-old. Then he won
with Jim McManus, now living in Australia, and on this occasion his
partner was Sandy Donald.
* THE three-man team representing Chivas Brothers of Paisley finished
joint fifth in the national final of the Gardner Merchant Business Team
championship at San Lorenzo.
Alastair Blair (6), Allan Minton (7), and Alex Malcolm (8) -- the
lowest combined handicap of all finalists -- amassed a two-round team
aggregate of 171 Stableford points. Asda Stores, from Sheffield, won
with 189.
A total of 1450 teams entered the seventeenth annual championship.

JENNY Pitman's Grand National exploits have won her patronage from
racing's most powerful racing family, the Maktoums of Dubai.
As a direct result of Royal Athlete's Aintree triumph, she has become
the first jumps trainer to receive a horse from Sheikh Ahmed Al-Maktoum,
best known as the owner of Mtoto.
Sheikh Mohammed has enjoyed top-flight NH success with Champion Hurdle
winners Kribensis and Royal Gait, but until now younger brother Sheikh
Ahmed has concentrated on the Flat.
He has sent over Master Tribe from Dubai, a five-year-old who boasted
classic form when he raced in Ireland with Con Collins. The horse
finished fifth behind Barathea, himself owned by Sheikh Mohammed, in the
1993 Irish 2000 Guineas and was just a length behind the subsequently
demoted Alflora in the Sea World International Stakes.
''The Sheikh watched the Grand National on TV and said he wanted to
have a horse in training with me. When I heard about this it took my
breath away,'' explained Mrs Pitman.
''Mark has schooled him. He thinks about what he's doing, which is
what I like to see. The Sheikh has an awful lot of good horses and I
hope I can do this horse justice. He'll not be rushed.''
Master Tribe is one of 70 Mrs Pitman has in training this season, many
of them youngsters recruited to fill the shoes of stable veterans Royal
Athlete, Garrison Savannah and Willsford.
All three, now senior citizens of racing, will return to action for
another campaign provided they still retain their enthusiasm for
jumping.
In that event Royal Athlete, whose early target may be the Welsh
National at Chepstow in December, will attempt to become the first
13-year-old since 1923 to win at Aintree.
* THERE should be more emotional scenes in the winner's enclosure at
Chepstow today, a week after Declan Murphy's successful return from
injury.
Sir Joey can gain a fitting victory in the Richard Holder Stakes
Handicap, a race run in memory of the trainer who died last year after a
long illness.
He ran one of the best races of his career when fifth in the Stewards'
Cup at Goodwood in July and has not been at all disgraced in the face of
some stiff tasks since, doing well from an unfavoured draw in an
ultra-competitive race won by Coastal Bluff at Ascot last time.
The six-year-old is well treated at the weights, on a mark 3lb lower
than last year, when he finished third.

QUALIFYING members of National &amp; Provincial Building Society will
receive between #500 and #3250 under the terms of the #1350m offer for
the society from Abbey National, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Savers with membership of under two years will each receive Abbey
National shares worth #500. Borrower members will also receive a flat
#500 in shares.
Savers with accounts open for at least two years will get #750 plus an
extra payment related to the size of their investments at certain dates,
subject to a maximum qualifying balance of #50,000. The aggregate sum
will be in cash with an option of shares instead.
The extra payment will be calculated at the time when the deal goes
through in late summer next year. However, it is expected to equal at
least 5% of balances up to #50,000.
Members are savers with at least #100 on April 28 this year in share
accounts, which embrace all N&amp;P's popular saving accounts including
Tessas. The extra payment will be calculated on the lower of balances on
April 28 and on the vesting date next year.
Holders of deposit accounts such as Special Reserve and offshore
accounts, credit cards, unsecured loan holders and life assurance
customers do not qualify for membership.
Those with less than #100 in share accounts will still receive a
statutory minimum calculated according to the rules laid down in the
Building Societies Act. This is expected to be around #5. Mortgage
holders need to have just #100 outstanding to qualify as members, and if
they also have savings they will qualify on both counts.
N&amp;P has learned from the example of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building
Society over the position of widows in joint accounts. The handout
following the Lloyds Bank takeover originally excluded widows, which
caused much bad feeling.
Under the N&amp;P scheme those named second in joint accounts will receive
a full entitlement should the first-named die. Estates of sole mortgage
or share account holders will qualify to receive #500 worth of Abbey
National shares.
Two-year savers need not maintain their balance at April 28 levels.
They can shift cash into N&amp;P products such as PEPs and unit trusts, as
long as it remains under the N&amp;P umbrella.
Otherwise they should not remove cash from the accounts with the
intention of topping them up by vesting day, because N&amp;P is reserving
the right to bring in a further date on which balances are assessed
without notice.
The whole deal is subject to members' approval in a vote next April. A
simple majority of borrowers is needed. For saver members a 75% majority
of those voting is required and either 50% of members have to vote or
those who do vote must hold 90% of the account balances.
Lord Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National, said the combined branch
network after its takeover of N&amp;P would slim down from 1000 to 880, but
repeated the pledge that there would be no compulsory redundancies.
He pointed out that the enlarged Abbey National would have assets of
#117bn, outstripping the combined assets of Bank of Scotland and the
Royal Bank of Scotland.

PICCADILLY'S Trocadero entertainment centre and the adjacent London
Pavilion are to be floated on the Stock Exchange. Owner Burford
Holdings, which bought the Trocadero in September 1994 for around #96m,
is to demerge into two companies -- New Burford and Trocadero plc.
Burford shareholders will receive one New Burford share, admitted to
the official list, and one Trocadero share, admitted to trading on the
alternative investment market (AIM), for each Burford Holdings share
held prior to the demerger.
Burford yesterday said the existing Trocadero business has a base of
long-term secure income from current leases.
New Burford will comprise Burfold Holdings' existing core property
business and its strategy will remain the same. The demerger is expected
to benefit both firms by enabling New Burford and Trocadero, as
independent companies, to exploit more fully different opportunities in
their respective sectors.
Trocadero is to create a world-class indoor hi-tech entertainment
centre. This is to be achieved by a substantial upgrading of the
property, intensive hands-on management, international branding of The
Trocadero and capitalising on its unique location.
New Burford will benefit from from reduced gearing thereby giving it
greater scope to take advantage of acquisition opportunities and
allowing Trocadero to have a level of gearing more appropriate to its
business.
After the demerger, New Burford will receive approximately #70m in
cash and will have around 29.5% of the ordinary share capital of
Trocadero, #15m of Preference shares and #24.5m of the subordinated
loan.

<HEADLINE>Profits rise just 1% as pressure increases on home market but Black Bottle looks like a winner. Highland Distilleries holds steady</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE #12.2m purchase of Black Bottle from Allied Domecq looks like
being one of the shrewdest moves Highland Distilleries has made for some
time.
It will provide a slightly cheaper but genuine alternative to Famous
Grouse in an industry which is struggling to hold its own. This is
underlined by Highland's figures for the year to August, which show
global turnover was up just 3% to #181m while profits were a mere 1%
better at #42.9m.
Inevitably, the serious pain was seen in the home market. Here the
policy of maintaining Famous Grouse as a genuine premium product
resulted in volume dropping 7% at the retail level and 2% in the trade.
At one point there was a 275p price differential between Grouse and
Bell's, which led to some discomfort in the earlier part of the calendar
year and particularly in March. Since then, overall prices have tended
to firm across the board.
The net result was that the brand lost market share in both the UK
overall from 13.8% to 13% and in Scotland from 22.7% to 20.6%, with the
most severe damage to the on-trade.
However, Black Bottle has 9.8% of that sector so Highland will have a
commanding 39% of the pub and bar trade in Scotland, which chief
executive Brian Ivory said was an excellent base for growing the Black
Bottle brand throughout Britain.
Grouse profits fell #1m and accounted for 45% of the total -- Highland
is to be congratulated for giving such a detailed breakdown of its brand
contributions. Fortunately, export sales rose 5% by volume overall
despite a crying need for better pricing as in home markets.
Export sales now amount to one million 12-bottle cases compared with
domestic off-take of 1.25 millon cases -- a 25-fold increase since the
brand was bought a quarter of a century ago. Markets such as Sweden,
Thailand and Greece are particularly encouraging.
There are plans to set up a joint venture in India, although the
rewards will take a considerable time to show.
There was a rising contribution from the single malts led by Highland
Park and Bunnahabhain which provided #2m of profits.
Blending saw a better return from new and mature fillings for both
Grouse and Cutty Sark -- the blending is undertaken by the Robertson &amp;
Baxter associate -- but it contributed a marginally lower profit because
of higher promotional costs.
Highland is spending heavily on marketing rather than providing below
the line support -- the euphemism for price cutting -- with its budget
rising 30% in the current year. There is a Grouse TV advertisement ready
to be shown in the South of England at the right moment.
The net 17% owned Remy Cointreau now handles 55% of Highland's
exports, but it appears to have found the going tougher than it expected
in the Far East with China perhaps a little slower than hoped.
Chairman John Goodwin is pressing for a reduction in duty on Scotch,
pointing out that if the national drink were to be taxed at the same
level per unit of alcohol as wine, it would be 250p a bottle cheaper.
Total UK tax including VAT is #7.63 on a #12.50 bottle.
However, he accepts equalisation will take some time and should be
done over a period of years but, he hopes, not too many.
The current year will be one of tough pounding with profits possibly
moving ahead to about #46.5m. The shares of the most solid company in
the whisky sector came back 12p to 379p, where they trade at 16 times
likely earnings and yield 2.6% on the dividend total raised 9% to 7.9p
with a 6p final.

HEALTHCARE
THE operators of Dounreay are targeting a totally new market . . .
making hi-tech components for equipment which can help specialist
doctors to diagnose cancers.
The UK Atomic Energy Authority yesterday announced that it had won its
first-ever export contract for medical equipment. The deal is worth
#500,000.
The component units are going to Holland and Dounreay revealed that
talks about further orders from the same customer for similar products,
worth #2m, are ''at an advanced stage''.
The deal involves fabricating small, flat metal aluminium plates,
which contain highly-enriched uranium powder.
The plates are being sent to be ''fired'' (irradiated) in a non-power
reactor in Holland, where a special type of radioactive molybdenum metal
is produced.
This is the source of the world's most widely-used radioactive isotope
for medical diagnosis, which is dubbed Technecium 99 M.
Dounreay's customer for the products is the Dutch subsidiary of a big
US hospital-supply company, called Mallinckrodt Medical NV.
The company supplies hospitals and specialist clinics throughout
Europe with Technecium isotopes, which are in liquid form are an
injected into patients, where they starkly highlight the affected
body-cells during X-rays.
The units will be fabricated in Dounreay's hi-tech facility called D
12012, which had been used for the past 30 years to make fuel elements
for research reactors in a number of different countries.
The facility directly employs 14 people at Dounreay, with a further 18
employees providing them with essential back-up.
Dounreay's site director, John Baxter, said the new work would
maintain employment at its specialist fuel fabrication plant ''for the
foreseeable future''.
Dave Thom, leader of the Dounreay group which won the deal, said he
was optimistic that further work of this type could be won soon.

<TEXT>
SUPERSTORE group Asda put the cat among the retail pigeons with its
decision to take 20% off the price of 80 branded vitamins and dietary
supplements such as folic acid, cod liver oil and evening primrose oil.
A fixed-price pact on healthcare products has existed for 25 years in
the UK.
Shares in Boots, which runs Britain's biggest pharmacy chain, lost
15[1/2]p to 568p as a result; Lloyds Chemists, owner of the Holland &amp;
Barratt healthfood shops, dropped 17p to 228p, and Kingfisher, owner of
Superdrug, was 8p cheaper at 502p.
Boots, which makes and sells over-the-counter (OTC) medicines said it
had no intention of responding to Asda's price cuts by breaking the 1970
agreement on these products. However, rival superstore operators
Sainsbury and Tesco are unlikely to take such a relaxed view.
Asda said it may extend its discount policy to other products such as
OTC pain killers and cold remedies, adding that if manufacturers want to
enforce price-fixing agreements it is up to them to make a legal
challenge to any such move.
City analysts believe any decision to abolish price fixing on sales of
over-the-counter medicines such as aspirin is unlikely in the short
term. Drug company SmithKline Beecham, voicing its support for price
maintenance, said cheaper OTC drugs and price wars could lead customers
to buy more of a medicine than they needed due to price promotions.
The dietary supplement market has grown rapidly in recent years as
interest in healthy living has increased. Britain's health and beauty
market, worth an estimated #1000m a year, is one of the few retail
sectors that is growing strongly.
Superstores are becoming increasingly important to a range of
products. Their move into toiletries, stationery, books and clothes,
which has hit traditional High Street stores, is an attempt to boost
profitability at a time of intense price competition in food.
A report published by retail consultant Verdict Research said price
competition by supermarket operators was threatening to create a price
war in toiletry sales.

BRITISH Gas chief executive Cedric Brown confirmed yesterday that he
was not participating in the group's new share incentive scheme.
The move follows the uproar over Mr Brown's ''fat cat'' remuneration
earlier this year and he was clearly fearful that further criticism
would follow if he took up his #2m rights under the scheme.
''I believe too much attention has been paid to my remuneration over
the past 11 months and sincerely hope that we can now get on with the
many complex and difficult challenges that face the company,'' he said.
''I strongly believe it is in the best interests of the company if I
do not participate in the scheme.''
Mr Brown was fiercely criticised for his 75% pay rise to #475,000.
This came at a time when the workforce was being cut and consumer
complaints were soaring. There were calls for his resignation at the
stormy annual meeting in May.
Mr Brown received oblique support yesterday from a surprising quarter,
the Gas Consumers' Council, which said he should participate in the
incentive scheme.
''An incentive scheme which excludes the chief executive is
incomplete. It does nothing to signal the board's intention to get back
to standards of excellence that characterised performance in 1993 and a
high share price,'' it said.
Council director Ian Powe added: ''His long experience of consumers'
expectations make him the man to lead British Gas back on track through
restoration of customer care.''
It was also revealed yesterday that three directors of British Gas are
to step down. Russell Herbert, who heads its US arm, is to resign
immediately ''to pursue other interests''. He will be replaced by
Stephen Brown who was recently recruited from General Electric.
Howard Dalton and Norman Blacker are to retire at a date yet to be
fixed. Mr Dalton is responsible for the Middle East, North Africa and
for exploration and production. Mr Blacker runs the European operations
and the trading business in the UK.
Some 250 directors and senior managers will qualify for the new
incentive scheme whose provisions have been tightened up compared with
an earlier proposal. Allocations of shares will only occur if British
Gas is one of the top 50 performers in the FTSE 100 index. Previously it
had to be in the top 60. The proportion of shares available for
allocation will rise from 40% to 100% should the group be within the top
25, compared with the top 30 before.
British Gas chairman Richard Giordano said: ''These are challenging
goals and the scheme is one of the toughest of its kind in the market
today. It will be in everyone's interest if the goals are met.''

I was tipped to be the next Jean Rook of Fleet Street, but I'm far
too soft
TELEVISION journalist Fiona Armstrong spends so much time in transit
that she has, successfully, turned commuting into an integral part of
her working day. Since she settled in the Borders eight years ago, the
former ITN newsreader has devoted the five-hour London-Carlisle train
journey to developing the writing strand of her career.
Four years worth of commuting to ITN resulted in her first book -- F
is For Fly Fishing. She's currently flirting with the notion of a novel
(''maybe a sex'n'shopping story''); and her latest finished product is a
recipe book for people leading similarly hectic lifestyles -- Fiona
Armstrong's Commuter's Cookbook.
Armstrong really is the ideal person to advise on quick and easy
recipes. Since she married and had her daughter (Natasha is three years
old), cooking has become less of a recreation and more of a necessity.
The problem was that although she had time to prepare menus in her head
while she travelled home, she was just too tired to make them up when
she got into the kitchen.
The only way to cope was by being ''quick, organised and resourceful''
-- exactly what the Commuter's Handbook is. The recipes slot into
categories according to the amount of preparation required; starting
with a section of the ''easiest'' versions of a variety of dishes and
working up to more complicated (relatively speaking) meals.
Commuters aren't the only folk who could benefit from Armstrong's
ideas: anyone who is short on time or patience as far as cooking is
concerned, and who knows the contents of Marks &amp; Spencer's fridges
better than their own would be well advised to give the cookbook a go.
And pleading that you don't have the ingredients is not an acceptable
excuse. Armstrong kicks off by providing a list of the items that no
cupboard should be without.
The book took Armstrong six months to write. ''It was really quite
difficult to do; much more difficult than I'd imagined, because the
recipes were all in my head and I had to measure everything out for the
book.''
There are 138 recipes in all, so Armstrong enlisted the help of her
mother to convert all measurements into metric. Her husband Rod was also
recruited. ''He helped me eat it. He used to come home and ask what was
for supper, and I'd say: 'We're having mackerel pate followed by chicken
red pesto, then bananas a la creme'. He'd reply: 'Oh God, can't we have
beans and toast?' He got so fed up with all these elaborate meals. I
tested them all in about three weeks so we had a three-course meal every
day for three weeks.''
It's a far cry from the horrendous food situation Armstrong found
herself in as a child travelling across Africa with her mother and two
brothers. Her father worked in the Colonial Service, and had been posted
to the north of Nigeria. The rest of the family took the train to join
him, and had to endure not only 36 hours of heat and over-crowding, but
also tins of peas and lemonade for each and every meal.
The family returned to England when Armstrong was 10 years old. She
went to school in Preston, then studied at London University where she
got her first taste of journalism -- editing the London student
newspaper, Sennet, which had a weekly circulation of around 50,000.
''It's funny: I was tipped by one of the newspapers to be the next
Jean Rook of Fleet Street. That would never have happened -- I'm far too
soft.''
On graduating, she began a traineeship at a local radio station in
Reading -- despite her burning desire to be a newspaper journalist.
Stints at BBC Manchester and Borders Television followed before she
landed one of the jobs with which she's still associated: reading the
news for ITN. After almost seven years there, she left to take up her
(in)famous post as frontliner on the new breakfast show, GMTV, in 1992.
Armstrong describes her six months at GMTV as ''an experience -- for
me it was basically the wrong show''. The problem, initially, was that
Armstrong and her co-presenter, Mike Wilkinson, were serious news
journalists and were expecting to front an ''American-style rolling news
programme''. Instead, they found that their bosses wanted ''a cosy sofa
chat programme''.
Then, of course, there was the ''F-factor'' affair. What exactly was
all the fuss about? ''My boss held a press conference after the first
show had gone out, and she said something like: 'Oh, we only want our
presenters to have the F-factor. Isn't Fiona looking great? We've put
her in short skirts -- and hasn't she got great legs?'
''The thing is I was never told to wear a short skirt; if I wore one
it was because I wanted to. The whole thing got out of hand -- people
started saying: 'No, she hasn't got great legs. How dare she wear a
short skirt'. They thought I was trying to set myself up as a glamour
girl. It is very important to look good on TV, but as far as things like
legs go, I hadn't even thought about it.''
When the company insisted that the GMTV team go on a five-day week,
Armstrong decided to quit. These days, she is relishing her freedom as a
freelance -- although she's just as busy as ever, adding new strings to
her bow. She still works regularly as a newscaster (for the BBC's
International channel) and she also recently stood in for Gloria
Hunniford, spinning discs on Radio 2.
Her main job at the moment, however, is filming a series of
documentaries on the lifestyles of high-flying businessmen and captains
of industry for the NBC Super Channel -- a kind of Hello for TV.
That programme involves much jetting across Europe, so maybe the next
Armstrong publication (after the novel) will be a Continental Commuter's
Cookbook, written on plane journeys, of course.

Olongapo
A WITNESS at the trial of a Briton charged with promoting child
prostitution in the Philippines testified today that the accused told
him to bring ''fetish gear'' to the country.
Fellow Briton Martin Cottingham told the court at the start of Michael
Clarke's trial that the defendant promised him an introduction to an
under-age girl in the Philippines.
Mr Cottingham, 30 the first prosecution witness, is a senior press
officer of the charity Christian Aid and was investigating reports of
Western paedophiles in the Philippines.
Mr Clarke, a 48-year-old tour agent from Eastbourne, has denied the
charges, which carry a maximum penalty of 40 years' imprisonment.
Mr Cottingham identified Mr Clarke in court. The accused snorted,
shook his head, and smiled during Mr Cottingham's 90-minute testimony.
''He's lying. He's lying,'' Clarke told reporters after the first day
of hearing.
The trial coincides with a Philippine Government crackdown on foreign
paedophiles preying on Filipino minors. The drive has netted about 10
foreigners in recent weeks, including Americans, Britons, and a
Frenchman.
Prosecutors presented to the court notes and brochures which Mr Clarke
was alleged to have sent Mr Cottingham in London to convince him to come
to the Philippines.
''Things to bring: camera, videocamcorder, fetish gear,'' according to
one note, which Mr Cottingham read in court.
He said another brochure offered tourists ''some of the most
outrageous happenings you will ever encounter''.
Mr Cottingham said he had called a telephone number listed in a
Philippine sex tour advertisement in an issue of the Exchange and Mart
magazine in March.
Mr Clarke then sent him explicit brochures and offered to procure a
girl, he added.
Mr Cottingham said Independent Television News discreetly videotaped
his transaction with Mr Clarke in the Philippines. Mr Cottingham and ITN
reporter Adam Holloway met him in Manila.
On April 29, in Angeles City, Mr Clarke introduced them to a Filipino
woman whom they were supposed to contact when they needed a young girl
for sex.
The resulting film, which was shown on British network television, was
also shown in court and prosecutor Florentino Floresta pointed to
footage of Mr Clarke telling the men: ''If you want young girls, you can
get young girls, 12 years old.''
The Philippines has about 20,000 child prostitutes, according to
official studies.
The trial continues.--Reuter/AP.

FRENCHWOMAN Jeanne Calment, who was an adult when the first plane
flew, today becomes the oldest person known to have lived.
Calment, born on February 21, 1875, is 120 years and 238 days old
today.
The Guinness Book of Records lists Shigechiyo Izumi of Japan, who died
in 1986 aged 120 years and 237 days, as the oldest human whose age has
been authenticated.
Calment, who was celebrating the record at her old people's home in
Arles in Provence in southern France, is blind, almost deaf, and
confined to a wheelchair, but retains a reputation as a mischievous
joker.
''Always keep your smile. That's how I explain my long life. I think I
will die laughing,'' she once said.
The Guinness Book of Records says that Calment's birth on February 21,
1875, can be reliably proven, making her the oldest person of more than
five billion alive on the planet.
Aged 14, she met artist Vincent Van Gogh. ''I painted too, big
pictures of flowers,'' she said last year. ''Everything interests me . .
. I've had a fine life.''--Reuter.

WHEN it comes to crafting and implementing corporate strategy the
pressures on business leaders to ''get it right'' have never been
greater -- the stakes have never been higher. For the corporate winners
the prizes are enormous; for the losers, catastrophic!
Traditional approaches to strategy have been about taking ''the long
view''. However, is this still valid in an era of increasing uncertainty
and change when assumptions made today may be redundant tomorrow?
Indeed, do long-term plans simply create misplaced confidence and a
dangerous chimera of certainty from which a business cannot break free
as the pace of change accelerates?
Today's reviewer works in an industry which is going through enormous
change and restructuring as last week's announcement of a merger between
Lloyds Bank and TSB demonstrates. Fred Goodwin was appointed deputy
chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank earlier this year and casts his
eye over the strategy bestseller which is influencing boardrooms
worldwide.
TODAY'S senior managers have become more interested in cutting back
than in building. They have become experts in downsizing,
re-engineering, slash and burn, and have lost the capabilities which
made their businesses successful in the first instance.
The resultant corporate myopia will ensure the erosion of today's
market position, and the beginning of an inevitable (but not necessarily
slow) decline.
Whether you agree (I do) or disagree with this basic proposition
Competing for the Future* will quickly grasp the attention of all but
the terminally complacent.
Drawing primarily upon their experiences working as consultants with
major companies in the electronics/IT sector, the authors bring forward
a plethora of real life examples in support of the points which they
make, and these contain enough sufficiently stark messages to make for
compelling, if somewhat uncomfortable, reading.
By the time that you are about one-third of the way through this book
you will feel a strong urge to jot down action points to ensure that
your organisation doesn't fall into the traps which are graphically
illustrated.
Having identified the problem, the authors set out to find the
solution by addressing not what to do but how to think -- corporate
mindset must be reshaped.
In terms of competition, firms must ''invent new rules for their
industries''. Instead of asking how to better serve existing markets,
they should ask how to anticipate what customers will want in 10 years
time.
How can we become the ''authors of industry transformation?'' Firms
need to ''stake out new competitive space'' rather than ''playing
catch-up'' to a competitors products and process.
To do this, the authors argue the need to have a ''strategic intent''
which allows companies to escape the mindset of the particular blend of
values, structure, assets and skills that brought them success in the
past, but may prove useless in a changed set of conditions.
IBM's tardy entry into the PC market is used as a pertinent example.
Senior management, they argue, must be able to develop an industry
foresight which will lead to intellectual leadership by taking on the
views of less-experienced but more open-minded subordinates.
The authors argue that ''core competencies are the gateways to future
opportunities''. Hence the logic of Sharp and Toshiba's vast investments
in flat screen technologies, or Sony's in miniaturisation which have
provided each with broad ''opportunity arenas'' for products -- pocket
diaries, laptop computers, Walkmans are just a sample.
Moreover, by concentrating on core competencies companies can also
enter new markets where these can be applied to new industries. A
pertinent UK example might be Marks &amp; Spencer's limited incursion into
financial services where they relay on their brand management and
transaction processing skills built up in their retail operations.
Developing new competencies for new markets is another option which
need not be prohibitively expensive. Here they quote examples of
Japanese companies who have consistently achieved more successful new
product launches than their American counterparts, despite having a
fraction of the budgets to spend on R&amp;D.
Canon, for example, succeeded where IBM failed in overtaking Xerox as
the world's most prolific copier manufacturer, with only 10% of IBM's
resources. By undertaking ''expeditionary marketing'' the firm can learn
faster than rivals the precise dimensions of customer demand by a series
of ''low-cost, fast-paced market incursions. The rules are simple: Learn
faster, learn cheaper.''
The book has a strong slant towards major players in the global
electronics and IT markets, which makes it easy to conclude that
although an interesting read, the suggested approach has no application
in smaller, newer, or perhaps service-orientated companies. This would
certainly be a pity, and probably a mistake since much of what is said
clearly passes the common sense test.
On balance I would be happy to accept the authors' own summary.
''Competing for the Future has been about making a difference in the
lives of employees by creating high drama and deep meaning in the
pursuit of an ambitious aspiration, by providing the hope of a future
after restructuring, and by opening every possible avenue for personal
contribution. Finally it has been about making a difference as a manager
by inventing new competitive space, by generating new wealth, and by
building a legacy that will outlast one's career.''

Kiev
UKRAINIAN police today said contract killers were behind a bomb blast
at a football match which killed the president of one of the country's
top clubs and five other people today.
Police in the coal mining city of Donetsk said the bomb went off four
minutes into the match killing Alexander Bragin, president of the
Shakhtyor Donetsk club, as he entered the VIP stand.
Bragin was also chairman of Luxe, a commercial firm under
investigation by police for fraud. Four of the victims were bodyguards
protecting him.
Shakhtyor was involved in controversy in August when it refused to
agree to allow the transfer of former player Andrei Kanchelskis from
Manchester United to Everton unless it received a share of the fee.
Everton eventually paid half the demand.
''These were professional killers,'' Donetsk police chief Arkady
Boldovsky said in the city 550 miles east of the capital Kiev. ''The
explosive device was well targeted,'' he added.
The match against Tavria Simferopol was abandoned and the stadium was
evacuated of up to 8000 spectators.
''This is the first time anyone has ever died violently in a Ukrainian
stadium. It has nothing to do with soccer,'' Mykola Chernysh, general
secretary of the Ukrainian Soccer Federation, said. Bragin was a
controversial figure in Donetsk, a city of more than one million people
in the Donbass coalfield with one of the highest crime rates in the
former Soviet republic.
Police said three attempts had been made on his life in the past 18
months.
The killing was certain to tarnish further the image of soccer in
Ukraine, whose players formed the backbone of Soviet national teams for
several years.
Last month the country's most prestigious team, Dynamo Kiev, was
disqualified for three years from European competitions for trying to
bribe a referee.
Once heavily subsidised by the state, Ukrainian clubs have been forced
to seek alternative financing, often involving sponsorship from the new
and not always legitimate post-Soviet business world.--Reuter

AUSTRALIAN RETAILING
Melbourne, Monday -- Three of Australia's largest businesses,
including Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation media empire, became
embroiled in a public slanging match today as the fight for control of
retailer Coles Myer intensified.
The retailer's embattled chairman, Solomon Lew, responded to criticism
from Mr Murdoch by lashing out at the media magnate and taking aim at
Australia's largest financial institution, the Australian Mutual
Provident (AMP) Society.
But the war of words helped boost the Coles share price for the second
successive day as brokers said it increased the likelihood that Mr Lew
and other directors would be forced to resign.
Mr Murdoch, who counts Coles as a big advertising and print client of
his Australian newspapers, urged Mr Lew to quit, echoing the views
expressed last week by AMP and two of the retailer's other major
shareholders.
On Sunday, the News Corp chief executive accused Mr Lew and other
Coles board members of ''thuggery'' and improperly using their influence
as a client to try to censor the way his journalists reported on the
retailer's affairs.
''I stand by everything I said,'' Mr Murdoch said. ''In fact I could
have gone further,'' he added.
Coles Myer's chairman responded angrily to Mr Murdoch's latest
outburst and accused him of abusing his influence. He has denied any
impropriety. ''It's also an example of how Mr Murdoch abuses his
influence and his newspapers to further his own financial and political
interests,'' he said.
''He has always had the best interests of News Limited and himself --
not Australia -- at heart, and he repeatedly behaves in this way to
benefit News Limited regardless of the cost to this country.''
Mr Lew also said the media magnate should be embarrassed that Coles'
sacked finance director, Philip Bowman, who sought a $A2m pay-out, was
still a director of Mr Murdoch's British satellite broadcaster, BSkyB.
Mr Bowman was dismissed last month after inquiring into a previously
secret share transaction which cost Coles $A18m and benefited a company
linked with Mr Lew. The revelation of this loss prompted major
institutional shareholders to demand a boardroom purge, starting with Mr
Lew's resignation, to make the board more independent.
Mr Lew also attacked AMP, saying its investment managers should be
sacked, and adding that Coles would soon release charts comparing AMP's
''poor returns'' with the ''terrific returns'' enjoyed by his company's
shareholders in recent years.
''They (AMP) alone have had a negative effect on the Coles Myer share
price. They've initially been selling these shares to hurt the
company,'' said Mr Lew, who has a 13.5% stake.
He also said the Coles board's future would be decided at the annual
meeting on November 21 but he was confident of the crucial support of
small shareholders.
''I believe at the end of the day, not only will we have the support
of the shareholders, we definitely have the support of the staff and we
definitely have the support of greater Australia,'' he said.
The shares closed at $A4.51, up six cents from its previous close,
after surging 12 cents on Friday on heavy turnover amid talk of a
mystery buyer. -- Reuter.

Singapore
MORE pieces of the puzzle behind the collapse of British merchant bank
Barings should fall into place tomorrow when the report of a team of
Singapore inspectors is made public.
Singapore announced today that the report, submitted last month to
Finance Minister Richard Hu, would be released tomorrow with a press
statement from the Ministry of Finance.
Barings collapsed in February amid trading losses reported to amount
to as much as $1.4bn (#9333m) and allegedly run up by its Singapore
branch futures trader Nick Leeson.
British-born Leeson, 28, is currently in prison in Germany awaiting
possible extradition to Singapore on charges of forgery and fraud, which
could subject him to a maximum sentence of 14 years if found guilty.
The British Government has released its own report on the collapse of
Barings, which was ultimately rescued by Dutch financial group
Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV.
However, the British lacked access to some documents and information
the Singaporean team had.
The UK report blamed the Barings collapse on hidden and unauthorised
dealing by Leeson.
It also said a serious failure of controls and managerial confusion
within Barings let Leeson's activities go unnoticed until it was too
late. -- Reuter.

INSURANCE
THE Prudential, along with all the life companies, continues to suffer
from the highly competitive climate in life and related products such as
pensions, and this is reflected in the new business figures for the
first nine months of 1995.
A tougher regulatory regime and full disclosure of commission and
expenses have added to the difficulty of selling products, though given
the miss-selling by the industry in the past, it could be said it
created some of its own problems.
Sales of life and pensions products around the world continue to be
difficult, said Peter Davis, the Pru's group chief executive.
But he took some comfort from an improvement in the UK where, despite
a year-on-year decline, sales of both annual and single premiums in the
third quarter exceeded levels seen in the first two quarters of the
year.
However, this follows a drop of about 25% in UK sales of life,
pensions and investment products in the first half so some pick-up was
probably to be expected.
Moreover, what improvement there was at home in the third quarter is
due predominantly to stronger corporate pension sales.
Personal pensions still look to be in the doldrums.
On a worldwide basis, annual premium sales fell by 13% to #342m during
the nine-month period and single premiums by 14% to #3207m.
Sales of investment products also suffered, with regular payments
falling to #27m, a third of last year's figure, and single contributions
down from #231m in 1994 to #85m in 1995.
In the UK, sales of annual premium life and pension products were down
by 10% to #183m, but sales of regular premium products were hammered,
dropping 67% to #27m.
''We continue to work on refining our sales process to accommodate the
needs of disclosure and believe we are beginning to see the benefits of
these actions,'' said Mr Davis.
Single premium life and pensions sales fell by 18% to #1276m, with
single premium individual pensions (excluding DSS rebates) down 57% to
#92m.
However, excluding DSS rebates, single premium sales in the third
quarter showed the first quarter-on-quarter increase since the beginning
of 1994.
Investment product sales declined by 65% to #47m.
Prudential shares were little changed at 380p.
* ANDREW Winckler, 46, currently the Securities and Investments
Board's head of supervision, will succeed John Young after he retires as
chief executive at the end of 1995.
Mr Young will remain on the SIB board as a non-executive director.

Madrid
BASQUE Eta guerrillas had Spain's King Juan Carlos in their sights for
two weeks before police found their hideout and arrested them last
August, reports say.
Citing police sources, El Pais newspaper contradicted the official
line that the king was never in danger because the would-be assassins
had been watched at all times by sharpshooters with night-sights.
The eldest of the three men now under arrest was followed for days by
Spanish agents tipped off by their French colleagues. However his
accomplices' hideout, in a flat overlooking the harbour where the royal
yacht was moored, was only found six days before their arrest on August
9, El Pais said.
''The two young terrorists were out of control for two weeks, which
evidently endangered the royal family,'' it added.
The guerrillas from Eta (Basque Homeland and Freedom) are said to have
planned to kill King Juan Carlos on August 13 in Palma de Majorca, where
he spends his summer holidays.
Spanish police later denied the El Pais report, saying there had been
no risk to the king. They also denied that a fourth man in the plot
remained on the run.--Reuter.

DISTRIBUTION
LEADING parcel carrier Lynx has moved to a new 45,000 sq ft secure
warehouse at Bothwell and promised a jobs boost for Lanarkshire, writes
LACHIE KENNEDY.
The premises are the result of a #1.2m investment and will be the
flagship for the company's Scottish network. The expansion could also
lead to the creation of 100 new jobs in the area within the next two
years.
The company already employs 116 people who transferred from its
previous premises at Airdrie. Lynx hopes to increase the annual total of
120,000 parcel consignments expected to pass through the new complex,
which was officially opened yesterday.
Managing director Philip Rose said: ''The move to more modern and
better located premises is a significant step in our blueprint for the
future in Scotland. We have helped to maintain employment through this
initiative and I am confident that, subject to some of our current plans
taking shape, we can all look forward to new employment opportunities.
''We are already the number one carrier in Scotland in terms of secure
distribution in at least one specified industry. Our objective is to be
the number one quality carrier overall.''

BUY now, it will be dearer later is the message from Highland
Distilleries.
Chief executive Brian Ivory suggests that Scotch prices in the
supermarkets will be higher this Christmas than last year.
But the vital question is how soon the industry comes back to solid
pricing sanity.
At the lower end there does appear to be some strengthening at present
but the premium market is being distorted by some companies rightly
promoting their brand image, raising prices and then spoiling the effect
by demoting it through cheap offers that both strain traditional
loyalties and make some customers think that the distiller does not have
a high regard for its product.
However, the underlying stock position does appear to be tightening
and while blenders are cautious about their short-term requirements with
1995 orders down 30%, their forward position is such that some are
anxious to find a place in the queue for next year.
The success and economic health of the whisky industry in the long
term is dependent upon brand and quality with the secondary, own label,
and tertiary brands being pulled along by the three premium brand
leaders.
Failure could in time well result a severe drop in status for Scotch.
It came as little surprise yesterday to learn that Highland's export
sales are subsidising those of the home market.
That position seems unlikely to change in the short term given that
the overall domestic Scotch market will do well to recoup the volume
losses of the last two or three years by the end of the decade unless
there is a decided shift in the duty position in addition to that
possibly generated from the television advertising campaigns.
It seems ironic that young people in Continental Europe seem more
enthusiastic about the product than those in its native land although
that probably reflects the successful image of it being new, vibrant and
young in France, Italy, Spain or Greece.
In Britain, Scotch is something father drinks -- and not everyone
wants to be like him.

SUGGESTIONS that 60-year-old Cedric Brown might be contemplating early
retirement following his decision not to participate in British Gas's
new share incentive scheme look wide of the mark.
Had he taken part he would have been 65 by the time the shares would
be allocated under the scheme in five years time.
Therefore, his decision not to participate could indicate he was
intending to leave before 65.
But the group denied this interpretation and it would be surprising
if, having weathered the storm over his remuneration and surging
customer complaints, he threw in the towel before British Gas's
performance had improved.
Mr Brown's own explanation, that he did not want to bring up the
question of pay again, rings true.
The group is currently grappling with the problem of its
''take-or-pay'' contracts with gas suppliers under which it has to pay
for supplies at fixed rates whether or not it needs the volume.
Demand has been depressed by the warm summer and mild autumn, at a
time when gas supplies are plentiful, so prices on the open market have
tumbled.
In addition, there is concern over the pricing formula set by Ofgas
for the transportation business.
From the viewpoint of shareholders, and consumers too, Mr Brown's
decision is unfortunate because a reward for producing good results is a
powerful incentive for efficient management.
Such schemes are only wrong when they encourage greed. British Gas's
revised plan is hardly that.
Indeed, looking at the group today there must be a strong chance the
benefits will never be forthcoming.
It would be unfortunate if the distaste over how British Gas managed
its reumuneration policy discredited incentives in general, because they
make it more likely that companies will be managed by calculated
risk-takers rather than bureaucrats.

Drug war breaks out
ASDA'S decision to cut the price of some of its vitamins could herald
price cuts in non-prescription drugs, where a price fixing agreement is
currently under review by the Office of Fair Trading.
While consumers may benefit from price-cutting, it is good news for
the drug companies or pharmacies, particularly the smaller ones.
Large groups such as Boots and Lloyds Chemists are unlikely to be
immune from the price war but they are at least big enough to be able to
fight back.
Small independent pharmacies, a large number of which have already
disappeared in recent years, are more vulnerable.
Small chemist shops in town centres and neighbourhoods still account
for between 50% and 60% of the market. Their demise would be
particularly bad news for the elderly, many of whom do not have cars to
travel to out-of-town superstores.
Drug company profits are already under pressure from governments keen
to reduce their healthcare budgets.
Many of the leading firms such as Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham have invested heavily in developing their over-the counter (OTC)
businesses. This has had the benefit of extending the profitable life of
drugs which have gone off patent.
Asda's move comes just weeks after the Net Book Agreement (NBA)
collapsed. This has paved the way for discounts on bestsellers such as
cookery writer Delia Smith's Winter Collection.
This is now available in many booskhops for #10.99 compared with its
published price of #16.99.
Asda was also instrumental in the collapse of the NBA.

THERE comes a time in the pursuit of an interview when any reporter
will recognise that this one is just not going to work. It was when I
was talking to the woman standing in for the assistant to the publicity
agent who is handling Delia Smith's new book that I realised such a time
had arrived.
However hard I might try, I was not going to get much closer to the
subject, St Delia, goddess of goodness, patron saint of Sainsbury's,
cook to the masses, and she whose recipes probably feed 500,000 every
night, many of them on red peppers.
There was a simple reason for this: it may not happen to many, but
there comes a time in the life of a celebrated public figure when he or
she no longer grants interviews because, quite simply, they are not
needed. What, after all, would she gain from more individual publicity?
What advantage would it provide? For goodness sake what would be the
point?
Millions of people will tune in to her new series, eager for her
latest recipes, and 500,000 copies of the new book -- to feed the next
500,000 -- are expected to be sold in hardback before Christmas with the
12-part series still only halfway through.
That is possibly an underestimate of the new book's potential. The
Summer Collection, which has sold more than a million copies is, after
all, still in the best-selling lists two years after its first
appearance and that is in hardback. Who can guess what the worldwide
sales will be when it is published in paperback?
Delia Smith is some phenomenon: as a publisher's dream; as a cook; as
a television personality; as an arbiter of British taste; in a way as an
agent of the most successful possible commercialism. She really does
move mountains, albeit of red peppers in Sainsbury's.
Given all that, why then should she give interviews which are more
likely to prove negative? Bitchy detractors seeking to dent the saintly
image may provide a better read than anything which merely confirms that
her wholly niceness is genuine, but why should she give them the
opportunity? Why bother? Well, she isn't going to. A meeting between her
saintliness and the assorted agents, assistants, deputies, and ordinary
toilers in the vineyard decided last week that interviews were out.
''They've been inundated,'' gasped a publicity lady, exhausted by
turning down requests for interviews and thus finding herself in the odd
position of denying her very title. ''We all got together and had a
meeting last week and Delia said she didn't want to do any publicity --
except to help the various cities with the Sainsbury roadshow.''
At the beginning of next month, she will embark on a tour of 10 cities
to promote the book, the television series, the red peppers and, of
course, the Shop. It is very important not to forget the Shop. Delia
certainly never does.
In the cloying three-page press release, ''A Woman For All Seasons'',
despatched to disappointed would-be interviewers by BBC publicity
(sample: ''Delia Smith, the nation's favourite cook, laughs as she
reveals that she's not always sweetness and light in the kitchen. 'I
don't like this St Delia thing at all,' she smiles. 'It's just not
true!' . . .'') we are reminded that she is a consultant to the Shop.
Her husband, Michael Wynn Jones, edits the magazine produced by
Sainsbury's and, needless to say, this is one source which does not have
difficulty in securing Smith exclusives.
It is hard to forget the connection between the two.
It is also difficult to underestimate the impact that she has on what
is sold in the Shop and by its competitors. The merest mention of, say,
lemon grass, can be enough to drive the buyers at Tesco into early
retirement. One popular story concerns a shopper seeking something
obscure like liquid glucose for one of Delia's delights, which had
through some marketing oversight sold out in the supermarket. When the
item was eventually run to ground in the local chemist, the cook
scrabbled for the recipe and the precise quantity required. ''If you're
doing the Delia Smith, you need two ounces,'' said the grumpy
pharmacist.
Then we might ask what on earth would happen to the commercial lime
crop if Delia was to drop the lime as a staple requisite of her recipes?
This could affect the balance of payments of an entire nation. All the
large supermarkets -- because, of course, people who buy Delia's books
do not only shop at one despite all her efforts -- have to keep lime
stocks constantly primed solely because of the ubiquitous use of the
fruit in her summer cookbook.
This commercialism is of great advantage to the Shop which does not
hesitate to profit from the sale of the produce. I noticed recently in
my local branch that multi-coloured peppers were sold, ready-packaged
and marked ''Peppers for Stuffing'', clearly heading for the oven
quicker than you can say Smith.
I noticed because I was buying peppers myself and because I bought
them, loose and unpackaged but equally available for stuffing if such
was the requirement, at about half the price of those pre-prepared for
the obedient Delia devotee.
I am striving here, not entirely successfully, I know, to avoid a note
of disapproval. I enjoy cooking and admire Delia Smith. Her recipes have
style. The results look good, taste good and -- it is true -- they are
tested to the ultimate. The books are beautifully prepared and
photographed. You can see the recipes will work and, yes, unfailingly,
they do.
She who works this miracle is modest about her cookery -- unduly so,
but as befits her devout Christian beliefs -- asserting that she is not
a great cook and has never aspired to be one, and, yes, she is right
about that, too.
She is not a great cook, but she is a great practitioner of cookery
and the means by which she has communicated her practices -- the books,
the television, the newspaper series -- have made her a more important
cook even than the great ones (about whom we may all choose to differ,
anyway). It may be a dangerous superlative, but it is possible that she
is more profoundly influential than anyone in the history of cookery.
The downside to this is that she teaches people that they can cook if
they follow her recipes, yet somehow misses out an essential aspect of
the lesson. She does not have the skill of, for example, the blessed
Elizabeth David, in conveying to the reader how to cook, rather than
merely how to follow a recipe. But she instils in her fans an almost
Messianic fervour.
I met a woman once who informed me with immense pride that she had
cooked every single recipe in the Summer Collection and I couldn't help
but wonder why. It is also slightly depressing to encounter the same
recipe too often.
But I shall be one of the half a million who buy the new book and I
may give it to friends for Christmas and I shall probably be preparing
the comforting stews that it contains with interest and appreciation.
How much longer can all of this go on, however? I am a bit alarmed about
the slip in the press release referring to ''all seasons''. After this
can spring and autumn be far behind?
* Delia Smith Winter Collection is on Wednesday evenings on BBC2. A
book of the same name is published by BBC Books at #15.99.

IT was most interesting to read your report on the closure of
Tighnabruaich Church (October 16). The Rev Ian Barclay is quoted as
saying that he cannot comment as he an employee of the Church of
Scotland.
In the August issue of Life and Work, the official monthly magazine of
the Church of Scotland, there is a report of a minister having had his
spectacles broken and when he tried to make a claim for them the Church
of Scotland insurance company stated he could not claim as it is church
law that deems a minister to be self-employed.
Double laws or double standards?
It also seems unfortunate for anyone in the Argyll or Dunoon
Presbytery should they need a minister in an emergency none was
available.

WHATEVER credibility Mr Tony Blair and New Labour had acquired in the
last few months must surely have been blown to the winds by his asinine
suggestion that the legal profession provide its services free of
charge.
It may come as a shock to Mr Blair, and others, that not all lawyers
earn the high rates of a QC, like Mrs Cherie Blair.
I will be delighted to give my services free of charge provided Mr
Blair can stop my bills for tax, rent, wages, phone, postage, etc.
I can just imagine the reaction of teachers, nurses, and other public
service workers to the suggestion that they work for nothing.
Politicians like Mr Blair get well paid for what they do.

THE news that an extra #2.1m is to be provided by the Scottish Office
for an expansion in respite care is welcome if something of a damp squib
(October 14).
The extra money is a partial response to the report commissioned by
the Scottish Office and published under the title, The Patchwork Quilt.
This report identified the lack of a strategic approach to respite care
as well as a lack of resources.
We welcome the fact that the Scottish Office has made some response
but we still believe that there is a great deal more that could have
been done -- #2.1m (which, we believe, was pledged several months ago)
is not a great deal of money compared with the number of vulnerable
people, elderly people, children, and adults with disabilities, people
with dementia and mental health problems, whose welfare can be
enormously improved by the provision of respite care.
Over the next five years many more people will move out of long-stay
hospitals and the respite currently provided by the NHS will also
diminish.
The development of less institutional respite care schemes by a number
of organisations (including ourselves) over the past few years has been
a very positive step for vulnerable people and their carers.
It has demonstrated that the community still has considerable
resources which can be developed to enable disabled people and others to
live more fulfilled lives.
However, the Government's current initiatives are only a tentative
step along the way to the provision of adequate respite services
throughout Scotland.

straight.
As a matter of accuracy the ''bizarre omissions'' referred to in the
first article are in fact all included in the consultative document. For
the record and without wishing to appear pedantic, litter is under
Attractiveness on page 8; transport under Sustainability (p 9); and race
and community relations in the introduction (p 5) and under
Participation &amp; Access (p 8).
Your readers may also wish to know that the direct source of
consultation documents is Glasgow City Vision, c/o Room 65, City
Chambers, Glasgow G2 1DU (rather than libraries).
I hope that these points are of assistance to your readers.

WE are so lucky living in Scotland.
Our deep waters are suitable for dumping munitions of all kinds,
including nuclear waste -- all of this, plus the reprocessing of other
countries' nuclear material -- too dangerous to be carried out in the
country of origin.
Their people protested, and were heeded.
And then there is Trident -- this obscene weapon and potential
destroyer of lands and people far away from us.
I think that since England has been so generous in these benefits, we
should send them to England, and allow their people to enjoy them for

LORD McCluskey's warning about the adoption of American practices is
timely if not too late (October 14). We have already seen the widespread
publication in books, the press, and television of photographs of the
two Libyans indicted for the bombing of PanAm 103 at Lockerbie.
The obvious question is: on whose authority were these photographs
issued?
The only attribution I have found is in the book by Matthew Cox and
Tom Foster, entitled Their Darkest Day. This states, ''Courtesy of the
US Justice Department''.
The book was first published in New York but the photographs also
appear in the British edition. It seems that the authorities in Scotland
have been quite content to adopt this US practice.
If the case ever comes to trial in Scotland or under Scots law
elsewhere, what reliance will the court place on evidence of
identification?

IN 1968 my brother received a life sentence for murder. Not for him is
the possibility of a half sentence, nor is time off for good behaviour
likely, neither will he benefit from the enlightened softly-softly
approach to crime.
Why?
He is dead -- he was a victim. Just one of the forgotten many, no
longer a person merely a statistic.
Ruth Wishart has taken up 24 column inches with a diatribe of absolute
rubbish (October 16). Not once did she mention the victims of crime. Was
she around to see the pain of loss my mother took with her to her grave?
Was Ruth Wishart there officially to identify his rat-eaten body
discovered after five days while his murderers boasted about their
triumph? My brother's death devastated our family. Was she there to
help?
Of course not, people like her will be looking to understand the poor
souls who carried out these crimes and justify their acts by reason of
childhood deprivation, then let them loose on society if they behave in
prison when it is clear they cannot behave in public.
She articulates only personal attacks on Michael Howard for daring to
consider the victims of crime and deal with the perpetrators in a manner
acceptable to society.
If, as she suggests, eight out of 10 criminals re-offend and are sent
back to prison then, as Mr Howard advocates, they should be kept there.
Let us build more prisons with the money saved from the enormous cost of
not processing eight out of 10 crimes through the courts.
Crime will be reduced at a stroke and although the prison population
will increase rapidly it will stabilise when the persistent criminals
are locked up.
But wait, this may put eight or 10 judges and lawyers out of a job and
resistance has already been heard from predictable sides of the bench.
The most important issue is to let those who obey the law of the land
and respect others once again feel safe in their own homes, safe to walk
the streets, safe to collect their pensions, and let children play
without fear of abduction.
Ruth Wishart's self-righteous smile would soon be wiped off her face
if she were the victim of a serious crime.

THAT the Post Office should be prepared to sell off its building in
George Square in Glasgow regardless of the public interest will not
surprise any student of Thatcherite privatisation, but it is deeply
ironic that it is the Glasgow Development Agency which is now pleading
that it do otherwise (October 14).
We should not forget that the first -- and best -- home proposed for
the National Gallery of Scottish Art in Glasgow was the former Sheriff
Court.
But then, without any public discussion, the GDA decided to flog that
asset to a hotel company, leaving the trustees of the National Gallery
of Scotland to make do with the second-best option of the Post Office.
In fact, while the Sheriff Court was a first-rate building admirable
for conversion into a museum, the Post Office in George Square is
third-rate, if that.
Indeed, the building for which the GDA is now bidding is so
architecturally undistinguished I would rather we had a first-class new
building on the site.
So, if the Post Office is not acting in the public interest, neither
has our own Glasgow Development Agency.

IT was surprising to note from John Lowrie's letter that the TSB still
has a Scottish board (October 11). Control of mortgages appears to be
firmly in English hands.
The TSB Director of Property Services (Midlands) Ltd has written to
approximately 50% of chartered surveying firms in Scotland stating that
the bank will no longer accept their mortgage valuations, even in cases
where a private survey has been undertaken.
Customers are to lose their freedom of choice and they will be obliged
to use the larger and more expensive firms. If this approach is followed
by other lending institutions small personalised surveying firms will
soon cease to exist.
The fact that the Scottish house buying system differs from that of
England apparently escapes the TSB Midlands director. He is applying
English procedures which at a stroke restrict customer choice, increase
the fees, raise unnecessary impediments to house buyers, and make life
more difficult for solicitors, agents, and others involved in the
mortgage business.
The alienated surveyors will obviously advise their clients to avoid
the TSB. Conceivably this could cost the bank upwards of 100 mortgages
per year.
Is this good Scottish business sense or is it English interference in
something they do not understand? If a reputable surveyor has acted
privately for a client there is no reason why his report should not be
accepted by the bank.
The TSB was a Scottish institution established to assist small savers.
It has now adopted a policy which actively discriminates against small
businesses. Fortunately the Scottish clearing banks adopt a more
sensible approach and the TSB could learn from its competitors.
If there are any members of the Scottish board who remember the
original values of the TSB and who think that Scottish affairs should be
dealt with in Scotland, I for one would greatly welcome their
intervention.

SO who's ranting? I thought John Macleod stated his case logically
whereas Ruth Wishart introduced irrelevances in an immoderate manner
(October 11).
I remember an instance of what John Macleod was saying. In the EIS
council it was suggested that one of the candidates for an office be
appointed without a vote being taken as this would increase the number
of promoted women.
The candidate herself angrily rejected this, saying she was insulted
at the idea of being given office because of gender, not merit.
(Subsequently she was elected on merit.)
Presumably Ruth Wishart was taken on to The Herald because she is
(usually) a good journalist not just to fulfil a quota of women on the
staff. Is there a word ''misboreal'' that can be applied to her
anti-Macleod piece?
I thought she was worldly wise, but perhaps she is one of those
parochial city-based people who think that anything north of Bearsden is
the wilderness, and across The Minch is outer space.
If Ruth Wishart had a column in the Stornoway Gazette or the Northern
Times would she begin it with, ''Hello Planet Zog?''

YESTERDAY'S Washington march by black male Americans may not have
achieved its target of a million participants but it was an impressive
demonstration none the less. It was also a reminder of how, more than a
generation after the last comparable demonstration on the same site,
orchestrated by Martin Luther King, little would seem to have changed
for young black males. The dream which Luther King proclaimed with such
moving eloquence has not materialised for many American negroes, who
find themselves marginalised socially and economically, and consigned to
the bottom of the heap. Negroes, who are under 12% of the US population,
score much more highly in every index of deprivation from drug
dependency to unemployment. The so-called underclass of the country is
disproportionately a black phenomenon, concentrated in all the inner
cities of the Union.
That is not the whole picture. There is now a large black bourgeoisie
which has escaped the ghetto for the suburbs, and for improvement. Yet
even they have not enjoyed the racial equality hoped for by Luther King.
Significantly, yesterday's march was intended to emphasise the
solidarity, and inevitably the separateness, of black males -- whereas
Luther King's great vision was about integration and the acceptance of
the common humanity of all American citizens. President Lyndon Johnson
set a cracking pace to embody King's hopes in a number of legislative
programmes designed to ensure black betterment, but these were
progressively muted; by the time of the Reagan and Bush presidencies a
preoccupation with foreign affairs, as well as a Republican distaste for
collective initiatives, relegated concern for the amelioration of racial
suffering. Popular reactions to the O J Simpson trial and its verdict
graphically exposed the gap between two Americas, divided by colour and
colour consciousness.
In this context it must seem a pity that yesterday's events were
organised by Minister Louis Farrakahn and his Nation of Islam, for he
and it accept, and would deepen, racial divisions in American society.
The paradox is that while intending to give negroes a sense of
self-esteem and self-confidence, they argue that this can only be
achieved by going it alone without friends among the whites generally
and Jews in particular. This is in spite of the evidence that some
whites, and especially Jews, have been in the forefront of the struggle
for racial equality over the past century. The association with Islam
may be partially responsible for the anti-Semitic element in Minister
Farrakahn's thinking but (as was eventually recognised by Malcolm X)
black Americans have tended to misread Islam's role in race relations.
They think it is preferable to either Christianity or Judaism, when it
is in fact much the same -- preaching colour blindness while in reality
allowing acute social discrimination to persist.
American negro misunderstanding of Islam goes back to the ideas of
Elijah Mohammed in the 1930s. It is a theologically as well as a
socially blurred vision but that is less important than Farrakahn's
ideas of separation, whose logical conclusion is a new kind of
apartheid. Luther King's dream is the better alternative. It has already
worked for some negroes if for not nearly enough. It can only be
extended by racial collaboration and by the resources of central
government -- state as well as federal -- to help the disadvantaged. The
relative failure of this approach so far helps to explain yesterday's
march, but its impetus is not exhausted and not everyone who marched
yesterday shared Farrakahn's unfortunate prescription for change.
President Clinton certainly makes the right noises in this area -- as he
did once again yesterday -- but if black America is waiting for a
symbolic change it may yet find it in General Colin Powell, who can only
be elected President next autumn if enough whites ignore the
prescription of Minister Farrakahn, and vote black.

Baghdad
IRAQI leader Saddam Hussein won a near-total victory in a referendum
on his presidency, according to results announced today, demonstrating
he retains his grip on national politics despite crippling UN sanctions.
Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy in the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council, said the president -- the sole candidate -- won 99.96% of more
than eight million valid votes cast on a turn-out of 99.47%.
Foreign observers saw thousands of Iraqis voting ''Yes'' yesterday,
and at monitored polling stations tellers faithfully recorded the
trickle of ''No'' votes. It was a secret ballot but many Iraqis voted in
open view of election officers.
After the result security agents and Saddam's supporters fired
Kalashnikov rifles in the air. However the victory came as no surprise,
some Iraqis shrugged their shoulders, and the official celebrations were
muted.
In Kuwait, invaded by Iraq in 1990 and liberated by the United States
seven months later, parliamentary Speaker Ahmad al-Saadoun said the
one-candidate referendum was ridiculously undemocratic and did not show
how long Saddam could survive.
''It does show that at least his position had been shaken by the
defections. He has been under great pressure,'' he added.
Iraqi leaders say they had planned the referendum for years but they
announced it soon after Saddam's two sons-in-law and their wives fled to
Jordan in August.
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose country is under a milder UN
sanctions regime, sent Saddam a message saying the referendum result was
a blow to Iraq's foreign enemies.
Some Iraqis said it was astonishing the authorities acknowledged any
''No'' votes at all, given the long history of authoritarian government
since a military coup toppled the monarchy and dissolved an elected
parliament in 1958.
However they did not expect the Iraqi Government's opponents abroad
would take the referendum seriously. ''We know what the American
reaction will be,'' one official said.
Indeed, a US Government spokesman ridiculed the referendum.
''Needless to say, we did not wait up late last night for the returns
to come in from Basra, and if I were Saddam's pollster, I think I'd be a
little upset because he didn't get 100%, he got 99.9%,'' said Nicholas
Burns of the State Department.
''It is a sham. It is ridiculous to even call this an election,''
Burns said. ''This was a mockery of anything that anyone can call an
election.
''It was simply Saddam crowning himself president for several more
years, which is a great misfortune for the Iraqi people,'' he told
reporters.
''Do you really think that those people walking into the ballot places
throughout Iraq had free will? Did they have choice? No.''--Reuter.

THE shriller critics carp at subsidies received by the arts. In truth,
in spite of recent publicity over lottery handouts, relatively little
public money is spent supporting music, theatre, film, and art
galleries. Few arts organisations are demonstrably spendthrift and most
struggle hard to make ends meet -- often forlornly. One shining example
of good husbandry is Glasgow Citizens' Theatre. Like nearly every arts
enterprise in the land it cannot survive on box office alone. But unlike
some of its peers the Citz, as it's familiarly known, is no Oliver
Twist; it doesn't ask for more. Its proud boast is never to break its
budget, a point emphasised this week when Citizens' director Giles
Havergal pointed out that during the 25 years he has been in charge the
theatre has never gone into deficit. In spite of an increasing struggle
during the past few years, the artistic achievements of this company of
worldwide renown continue to remain high, as its appearance at last
year's Edinburgh Festival confirmed. All the more reason, therefore, to
regret Havergal's warning that the doors of his theatre may be closed
for four months next year, with the abandonment of the accustomed summer
season.
The impending crisis which led to this decision has a specific cause.
The summer season has been regularly subsidised by Strathclyde region,
and by this summer Strathclyde will be no more, having been dismantled
by local government reorganisation. There is no guarantee that the
smaller single-tier authorities which will emerge from the dust will
continue to honour commitments made under the old dispensation. Harsh
reality points the other way. The dilemma is not confined to the theatre
or to the heirs of Strathclyde, deceased. The problem is nationwide.
Earlier this month a public meeting was held in Stirling to discuss the
future funding and constitution of the Smith Art Gallery and Museum, at
which the director, Elspeth King, revealed that the demise of Central
region would almost inevitably mean the loss of a substantial part of
the Smith's grant. This would be a crippling blow. She forecast that
surrounding local authorities, inevitably strapped for cash, might
favour local enterprises at the expense of an institution outwith their
boundaries -- even though the Smith will continue to serve an area at
least as large as the present Central region. The scenario must be
familiar to the friends of many creative organisations throughout
Scotland, and the denouement is awaited with some trepidation. There is
not much sign of a happy ending.
Not much cheer, either, from the Scottish Arts Council, which has
nothing extra to contribute. There is the lottery, of course. Much
publicity has been given to the windfall received by the Royal Opera in
London. Another slice of luck went this week to Sadler's Wells, also in
London. Scottish Opera, once again lurching heavily into the red, might
view this lottery largesse with envy -- though in fact the strings
attached would disqualify it from benefiting. Lottery money for the arts
is destined for capital works and not for running costs, a policy which
automatically excludes other hard-pressed supplicants such as our
national orchestras. Might the rule be relaxed? It is tempting to argue
the case, except that a leg-up from the lottery could be used by
government as an excuse for trimming core funding. It was revealed only
last week that Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley had to slap
Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave on the wrist for daring to
suggest such a thing. The intention, of course, was hotly denied by the
naughty boy. Clap your hands if you believe in Treasury secretaries.

THE Scots Independent, organ of the SNP, carries a communication from
a Mr John J G McGill of Kilmarnock -- a letter which he claims
Scotland's national newspapers have declined to print.
It concerns the ''fainthearts'', the members of the Scots parliament
who were bribed to vote away our nation's independence in 1707. This
1707 dateline makes the story really quite recent by Diary standards so
we are happy to pass on the details.
Mr McGill lists the names of the parcel of rogues who sold out the
Scots nation and how much each received from the English paymaster, Lord
Godolphin.
We quote some of the names below in order that descendants of these
chaps might think black burning shame of their ancestors and perhaps
even consider handing back the cash into the public purse, with
appropriate compound interest.
Top of the list was Lord Queensberry who received #12,325. A sum
which, with interest, we calculate is worth #300m at today's prices.
(Actually we made up that figure of #300m but if anyone knows or cares
about the accurate amount they could let us know.)
Lord Fraser (not the chap who owned the House of Fraser) received the
second largest amount, the nice round sum of #4504 17s 5d. Lord Cessnock
was in receipt of the princely sum of #50 which, we presume, he invested
in the pub and underground station near Ibrox which have been the
subsequent source of the family wealth.
Bottom of the bunging order was one Lord Banff who sold his country up
the river for a mere #11 2s. But, as you know, 11 quid and two bob was a
lot of money in those days. You could renovate a small castle, pop down
to Edinburgh for a weekend's wassailing, have a haunch-of-venison
supper, buy a new doublet and hose out of Ralph Slater's, and still have
change out of a tenner.
Vital role
JOHN GREIG, the greatest Ranger of his time and now the club's public
relations person, was heard to say what a welcome and useful addition to
the playing staff is the Russian Oleg Salenko: ''He's come in very handy
as an interpreter -- telling us what Gazza is saying.''
Tarnished image
IT'S great to see the guid old Scots tongue kept alive. Or it would
be. Susie Taylor of Partick sends us a copy of a receipt from Henderson
the jewellers of Sauchiehall Street for a pewter quaich which she bought
as a present for a bairn of her acquaintance. On the receipt from the
firm which describes itself as ''Scotland's family jewellers'' the
traditional artefact purchased is described as a ''quake''.
Zut Delors!
A DIARY mole on a visit to the Euro Parliament in Strasbourg reports a
development on the single currency front. The coin of a United States of
Europe will not be called the ecu. Good news for the former President of
the European Commission is that it will be called the Delors. Bad news
for the current incumbent is that one Delors will be worth 100 Santers.
Sex on the buses?
WHEN one reads that the Ensemble Escotia is appearing at the Cottier
Theatre in the West End of Glasgow, one expects a cultured evening. But
we read on to find: ''Scotland's most vital new music group present a
concert about life, death, love, skyscrapers, and sex on public
transport.'' We might pop along to the concert a week tomorrow -- but
just to find out if it is the 59 or the 44 bus they are talking about.
Surely it can't be the Underground; the trains are too small.
Monumental case
SANDY Stoddart, the Paisley artist, has done much to bring classical
sculpture back on to the streets and squares of Scotland. He also talks
a very good game when it comes to convincing folk to put up the loot for
one of his bronze extravaganzas.
Now, we fear, Sandy has let his word processor run away with him. In a
document describing his new civic statue for Kilmarnock, a joint image
of Robert Burns and his publisher John Wilson, he begins his ''case for
monuments'' thus:
''The twentieth century has seen two distinct approaches taken to the
question of monumentalism throughout its terrific course. On one hand
the monumentalist gesture has been pushed to extremes of scale and
rhetoric, elevating the votive image into the realm of absolute social
necessity; there is no state or civil life without the statue.
''On the other hand, the idea of the monument has been systematically
attacked as an adjunct of philistinism and cruelty. The very word
monumentalism is recommended, by many, especially in arts authorities,
as a synonym for artistic vacuity. However, and very significantly, the
power of the monumental remains vigorous in this most arid of fields, in
that it is so often invoked in apologisms for the small-scale, exquisite
art-object.
''The appeal of the epic-scaled monument survives, against all odds of
fashion and intrigue, and all perversions of cultural instinct, to
supply the ultimate verification of quality in its perfect antithesis.''
He continues: ''Monuments are necessary as a means to a polity's
intelligence. They are troublesome to conceive and compose in full
propriety. They are not, in the degraded, behavioural use of the term,
democratic, for they absolutely must be designed by experts, in the same
way as city sewers absolutely must be designed by experts.
''They stand not to indulge folly, or inarticulation, or incunabulism,
but to force the pace of improvement, and confound ignorance.''
Well, he would go and work in Kilmarnock.
Fly-past
WHY do people pick on the poor wee Renfrewshire burgh of Barrhead?
Just this weekend we heard an after-dinner speaker (of Irvine origin, no
less) ask why seagulls fly upside down when they're passing Barrhead.
Because, he said, there's nothing worth shi . . . er . . . worthy of
their attention . . . down below.

Washington
A HUGE crowd of black men, two or three hundred thousand of them,
gathered in the centre of Washington today to hear exhortations to
atonement and reconciliation from a long series of speakers.
They filled the Mall from the foot of the Capitol in the east to the
Washington Monument a mile-and-a-half away. Huge television screens were
set up at intervals, with banks of mammoth loudspeakers to relay the
speeches.
President Bill Clinton, far away in Texas, led a wary US establishment
in lauding the inspirational goals of the rally while rejecting ''one
man's message of malice and division'' -- an unmistakable reference to
march organiser Louis Farrakhan, a fiery orator accused by critics of
race-baiting and anti-Semitism.
There were 60 or so speakers, including members of Congress, mayors,
and preachers. The Rev Jesse Jackson urged everyone to give hope a
chance, and Minister Farrakhan, who summoned the ''Million Man March'',
gave a long, rambling address in which he preached an eclectic synthesis
of Islam, Christianity, Egyptian religion, and numerology.
What was clear was his message that America remains two racially
divided societies ''separate and unequal'' and shrugged off President
Clinton's call for racial harmony.
He described a history of white supremacy he said had been perpetuated
by Presidents from slave-holding George Washington and Thomas Jefferson
through Abraham Lincoln, who freed the slaves in 1863.
He also claimed personal credit for inspiring the rally, waving aside
controversy over whether its message could be separated from a messenger
whom critics have accused of race-baiting and anti-Semitism.
However, he called for a conciliation dialogue with Jewish leaders,
such as the Anti-Defamation League which led Jewish criticism calling
Farrakhan a ''pied piper of hate.''
''I don't like this squabble with the Jewish community,'' he said.
''Maybe it is time to sit down and talk. Not with any preconditions. You
got pain. We got pain too. You hurt. We hurt too.''
He said that if the Jews can sit down with PLO leader Yasser Arafat
''where there are rivers of blood between you, why can't you sit down
with us and there's no blood between us.''
The crowd was conspicuously good-tempered, orderly, and middle-aged.
There appeared to be relatively few teenagers and, of course, hardly any
women or white people.
The organisers, starting with Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of
Islam, wanted black men to come to express their solidarity and their
determination to improve their own lives, starting with an admission
that there is a great deal wrong with the way many of them have lived in
the past.
Great numbers of people, of course, reject Farrakhan's exclusionary
tendencies. Black women assert that they have an equal role to play and
many resent their banishment.
It was a beautiful autumn day and Washington emptied itself for the
occasion. Black men took the day off to join the tens of thousands who
travelled from all over the country, but white people seem to have
stayed away. Some of them certainly feared violence and race hatred or
disdained to see the city taken over by black people.
This is part of the problem with race relations in America, that the
white majority should fear the black minority, to the extent of staying
away from work for fear of confrontation.
Meanwhile, President Clinton in Texas, was delivering a speech on race
relations setting a tone that, unfortunately, is seldom heard from
American politicians.
He acknowledged that ''white Americans and black Americans often see
the same world in drastically different ways . . . despite the
remarkable progress black Americans have made in the last generation''.
He compared today's rally with the march on Washington led by Martin
Luther King in 1963 in which the marchers ''were demanding that dignity
and opportunity they were due, in the face of terrible discrimination''.
Today's march, the president said, ''is also about pride and dignity
and respect . . . It's about saying ''no'' to crime and drugs and
violence. It's about standing up for atonement and reconciliation.''
As for Farrakhan, however, Clinton made his position clear, without
naming him: ''Some of those in the march have a history that is far from
its message of atonement and reconciliation.
''One million men are right to be standing up for personal
responsibility, but one million men do not make right one man's message
of malice and division. No good house was ever built on a bad
foundation. Nothing good ever came of hate.''

GOING down on crosswords happens so seldom that when a lawyer who was
doing a puzzle in public earned an official rebuke the other day in
Stirling, it was worth a couple of paragraphs in the paper.
Improving some waiting time in the sheriff court, the offender was
told to put his Herald away. ''You can't be doing that here,'' he was
rebuked, although not in those words but more or less.
And it was longer than days ago. Since precision is the thing with
crosswords, nearer a fortnight has passed since. But because of the
legal setting of the little incident, it seemed permissible to hasten
back to it slowly.
Crosswords have a long time between their court appearances. It takes
going back three-quarters of a century to find any heavy, learned fuss
being made about them, legal or otherwise.
Their height as a new craze came in the early 20s and in America.
Worthy people who worry about any sudden popular enthusiasm worried much
about crosswords. Loads of harm was seen to come from them. They menaced
family life, while they injured health. The social fabric was being
undermined by them.
So crosswords were had up. Two addicts in New York were blamed for
neglecting their children because of puzzles. They were sentenced to do
no more than two a day.
Doctors also expressed concern. Their lines were that daily
frustration would cause nervous complaints. Failure to find answers
would surely lead to sleepless nights.
Opticians advised there was a risk of becoming square-eyed. They
declared that the chequered pattern, together with the constant
switching of the eyes from clue to black-and-white grid, must surely
damage sight.
It much excited the concern of established guardians of other people's
welfare that the first puzzles appeared in a newspaper section labelled
FUN.
Their cradle was the New York World which turned word-crosses, as they
were then called, into a daily torture in 1913. Originally they had been
an occasional nursery game in Britain. Crosswords are another invention
which got away to be re-imported as a thrilling novelty.
Word puzzles, however, are of dateless antiquity. Ancient Romans toyed
with them on their long journeys to outposts of empire. Uncovered on a
wall in Gloucestershire was this perfect square of letters:
Rotas
Opera
Tenet
Arepo
Sator
Whatever it means -- something along the lines of how the sower Arepo
holds the wheels firmly -- is of less than millennial significance, but
its smart virtue and the neat trick of its arrangement is to read the
same way down and across.
Despite such classical antecedents, crosswords were admitted
hesitantly to the pages of the more august British papers. Only in 1925
did they become a regular feature here and there.
It did not take long for them then to appear in court, if only in a
hilarious piece of fiction.
A P Herbert in his Misleading Cases devised a suit that had for its
basis a crossword constructed from lewd and libidinous clues which for
their answers had the names of people, who sued.
First, the purpose and pattern of crosswords had to be explained to
the judge, one of the breed who have sometimes sought to remain innocent
strangers to everyday phenomena like bus stops or pop groups.
Learned counsel had to apprise his lordship about the conundrum before
him in a paragraph that is one of the most insultingly patient and
technically exact (and long) in literature.
''Milord, with the greatest respect, milord, a crossword puzzle (said
Sir Anthony Dewlap) is a form of puzzle, milord, in which a number of
numbered squares in a chequered arrangement of -- er -- squares, milord,
have to be filled with letters forming words, milord, which words are
read both horizontally and vertically, milord -- that is, both across
and down, if your lordship follows me -- and which words may be deduced
from certain descriptions or clues which are provided with the puzzle,
milord, these descriptions having numbers, milord, and these numbers
referring to the squares having the corresponding numbers, milord, which
are to be filled in with the correct letters and words according to the
descriptions which have the corresponding numbers, milord, whether
horizontally or vertically, as the case may be. Does your lordship
follow me?''
''No,'' said Mr Justice Snubb.
His curt response was only wise. He knew his judicial wig had been
pulled. His lordship may even have twigged that crosswords are hotbeds
of disrespect. Like other public squares, they are for gatherings of the
rebellious. Obvious truths are distrusted by them. Even formal regard
for the language is weak. For instance, crosswords remain safe zones for
puns.
And puzzlers are not great ones for conventional behaviour. They write
their own bits in the papers instead of just reading what they are given
to read. They indulge in quiet bits of private poetry and subversive
wit. They have capital FUN.
And crosswords have encouraged a new self-confidence among the lieges.
Not so long ago they worked in pencil, with an eraser always handy. If
only because they cannot now find a pencil, ink is preferred. It
suggests that a root of arrogance has been planted among the ordinary
citizenry, and that always makes authority feel uneasy. Besides, despite
much debate, nobody has yet proved that crosswords may be educational.
So, quite right, a proper place for them is not a lawyer's table in a
courtroom even in Stirling, or, perhaps, especially there.

The Traverse Theatre is at the cutting edge of drama but the pursuit
of unknown works is fraught with difficulty. Mark Fisher charts the
course of the latest performance
IAN Brown recalls an occasion in the run-up to the Barcelona Olympic
Games when he was approached by a man from the British Council who was
putting forward ideas for that city's associated arts festival. He
wanted to know if Brown, as artistic director of Edinburgh's Traverse
Theatre, had anything interesting lined up for the forthcoming year that
might transfer well to Spain.
Yes, said Brown, I'm going to be staging a play by a writer called Sue
Glover that's all about female farm labourers in the nineteenth-century
Borders.
''Oh,'' replied the programmer, ''that doesn't sound very interesting,
does it?'' The fact that the play turned out to be Bondagers, one of the
most successful productions in the company's history, playing sell-out
runs in Mayfest, the old Traverse, the new Traverse, the Edinburgh
Fringe and Canada, makes the story a prime example of Brown's dilemma.
His theatre's job, its whole reason for being, is to put on new plays;
plays that no-one has heard of, often by writers no-one has heard of,
and as often as not with no star names (Tom Courtenay, Una McLean, and
Ariel Dorfman notwithstanding) to sell them on.
In cinema this wouldn't represent a problem. People reject old movies
in favour of the new to satisfy a need for fresh perspectives,
up-to-the-minute ideas. Point that same audience in the direction of a
theatre and they grow cautious.
Suddenly they need the security of a well-known title, a familiar name
and the risk seems all the more great.
And in a way it is. Theatre is a living art, capable of hitting great
highs but also of scraping embarrassing lows. You get bad movies, of
course, but the production process generally saves you from the very
worst (no-one ever forgot their lines in a film), and you know that the
actors won't be put off if you laugh out loud.
Theatre's all about being there, cinema's all about someone having
been there before.
There's nothing new about this conundrum, and as a long-time
specialist in new writing, Brown is well familiar with it. But at a time
when fewer and fewer new Scottish plays are reaching the stage, it is an
irritation he is feeling ever more acutely. ''I don't think you could
accuse this of being a golden age of Scottish playwriting,'' he admits.
''I'm not sure why that is, but I think a lot of people have been put
off and are finding it hard to get back into writing. It's never easy to
find plays of the standard that you're looking for and you just have to
keep working until you find them. And there needs to be more places than
just the Traverse doing that. We need to come up with a different way of
viewing the playwright in Scotland,'' Brown says.
The Traverse is, of course, busying itself behind the scenes,
nurturing the next wave (''We have got a new generation of writers
coming through and that's really healthy,'' says Brown), preparing them
for the difficult task of writing rough, tough, and fighting-fit plays,
but the relative paucity of new work means that each play that does
reach the stage has to shoulder the burden of a tremendous weight of
expectation.
Brown is wary about too much special pleading -- and he is secure
enough in his own track record to cope with the occasional bad review --
but he does worry for the young playwrights who one month are hyped up
as the future of Scottish theatre, and the next are slapped down for
producing a less-than-perfect play.
All of which is my prelude to saying that the next two in-house
Traverse productions are not by Scottish playwrights at all, but British
premieres of North American work. In late-November, there'll be Road to
Nirvana, a savage Hollywood satire by the USA's Arthur Kopit. And this
weekend, Stones and Ashes, a play by Quebecois writer Daniel Danis, is
opening in a production directed by Brown himself.
''There is more of a tradition of new plays in Canada,'' says Brown
just back from getting an off-Broadway production of Moscow Stations
with Tom Courtenay up and running. ''They have worked very hard to
create a climate where new work is considered to be very important. In
this country new theatre is greeted with suspicion, whereas I feel that
one of the joys is discovering something that is new, that nobody has
ever heard of.
''Nobody has heard of Daniel Danis in this country and I think that's
incredibly exciting, because it's clearly an unusual and original
piece.''
It was playwright Tom McGrath who first came across Stones and Ashes
when flicking through an anthology in the original French. So taken was
he with it that he approached the Traverse offering to do a translation
which, like the celebrated Michel Tremblay translations of Martin Bowman
and Bill Findlay, he would set in a modern Scots idiom while maintaining
the Quebecois location.
Danis's script is big on language, being written in verse, and
balances the gruesomeness of murder and gangland violence with the
elemental search for deeper meaning in our lives.
It's about a man who escapes with his daughter from the sudden loss of
his wife by heading for a small town, where a cruel and reckless gang
come to dominate their lives.
''It's a world you just want to enter,'' says Brown. ''It has caught
us all up in it. It started with Tom McGrath and it's snowballed. It's
like nothing I've ever come across. It's a very simple story, but what
it means is very complicated.
''It's trying to tap into human beings and how they're attached to
nature; it's about the masculine and feminine. He weaves a spell through
the words which makes it peculiarly a theatre piece as opposed to a film
-- it requires you to enjoy the rich language.
''He's in touch with deep things about human beings, how they relate
to each other, and how they relate to disappointment, happiness and
death. But the events of the play are so extreme, so savage, that it
stops it becoming wishy-washy.''
As for the future, Brown is confident that his long-term developmental
policies, the presence of a dramaturge and a writer in residence and,
crucially, the availability of money to provide writers with actors and
directors to try ideas out, are already reaping rewards for Scottish
theatre.
''There certainly are a lot of plays coming through that will benefit
from that facility, which the Traverse never offered before,'' he says.
And as for his own plans, Brown is remaining tight-lipped. Having run
the old Traverse in the Grassmarket since 1988 before overseeing the
successful transition into the new building in Cambridge Street in 1992,
he has been in charge for longer than any director in the company's
30-year history. Rumours have been doing the rounds that he might be
ready to move on when his contract expires next autumn, but he's not
going to add to the speculation.
''I will be saying something about that, but not just at the moment,''
he says enigmatically. ''I'll probably make a statement after
Christmas.''
Watch his space and watch this space.

Opera
THE blood on the stage at the close of Gotterdammerung was
Siegfried's, but with the violence of the booing it could have been the
producer's. After a week in Blackpool, I sensed that the same instincts
which led these annoyed Wagnerians to jeer the foreign-ness of Richard
Jones's interpretation would have prompted them to cheer Michael
Portillo and his rant against Europe.
Thank goodness then for Bernard Haitink and his miraculous control of
the orchestra and the score. Here is a man unhurried, in full possession
of every motif and detail, untroubled by the interpretations of others.
Thank you also to a cast of superlative quality. Deborah Polaski
returned as a world-weary Brunnhilde; Siegfried Jerusalem as a naive
Siegfried; the astounding bass Kurt Rydl as Hagen; and the remarkable
Vivian Tierney as Gutrune in her Covent Garden debut.
Wagner allowed for the widest possible interpretation of the Ring --
''the very essence and meaning of the world in all its possible
phases'', he wrote -- so Wagner virgins like me will have lost no sleep
over some of the unfathomable touches that have marked this cycle since
its opening a year ago. So the Rhinemaidens started out obese, naked,
and pale and are now slim, naked, and tanned? So Hagen shoots up while
on guard duty? So the soldiers are in pyjamas? So Valhalla is a pile of
cardboard boxes? So what?
The look is darker and reduced but most of the strands of the earlier
episodes are still there. The impression is of a decayed
twentieth-century Europe, unsure of itself and lost in the face of
immutable evil. But Jones and director Nigel Lowery owe the excitement
of this cycle to their performers and conductor, rather than their own
vision.

BOBBY Wellins, Spike Robinson, and John Barnes had the last concert,
if not the last note which sounded somewhere in the wee hours, to round
off a Dunoon Jazz Festival with which the organisers must be chuffed to
bits.
As the courtesy minibuses busily ferried lunchtime festival-goers
round a selection of hard bop, mainstream, and trad, the word most often
heard was variety.
The furniture stock-challenging audience who gathered in the Queen's
Hall to hear pianist Julian Joseph turn on the scintillation with the
Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra favoured another word, whaaaat? Joseph
was undoubtedly the talk of the Cowal steamie but there were other,
less-public treats such as saxophonist/flautist Lee Goodall and
guitarist Dylan Fowler's session in surely the festival's most
comfortable venue, the Esplanade Hotel's lounge.
Playing everything from Charlie Parker blues to Bulgarian tunes in the
sort of time signatures which caused the invention of the abacus, this
duo gave an intimate and engrossing display which was all the more
impressive given Goodall's eleventh-hour replacing of the absent
guitarist Don Paterson.
And so to Tenor Madness. Wellins, Robinson, and Barnes are past the
stage of creating madness per se. This was, instead, a showcase for
mature, accomplished, and swinging musicianship, with Barnes favouring
his more familiar baritone sax much of the time.
With Robinson aboard there was little danger of them trotting out the
usual standards, and a second-half run of underexposed Al Cohn tunes was
a shrewd and welcome move, as was Robinson's feature A Time For Love, a
beautifully structured and calm candidate for highlight of the weekend.

THIS is another of those not-as-young-as-I-used-to-be plays that are
sustaining a sizable chunk of the commercial sector these days. Written
by Kay Mellor, author of TV's Band of Gold, it's a domestic comedy about
a woman-of-a-certain-age who realises, on the morning of her son's
wedding, that it is only her role as a mother that has allowed her to
tolerate a sham of a marriage and a life of compromise.
On the strength of this script I reckon Mellor lives several doors
down from Alan Bennett and Victoria Wood, her writing enjoying the
minutiae of ordinary northern English suburban life but not quite
possessing the same sharpness of observational skill. When she sends her
central character, Betty, off to Asda to buy some cottage cheese, you
feel sure that an Alan Bennett would have packed her off to Lipton's for
some French dressing, and somehow made it more poignant in the process.
Not that Mellor doesn't come up with several good laughs in among the
sitcom chuckles (the audience hooted throughout), and not that she
doesn't deal with some sensitivity in the touchy area of family bonds
and lost lives. And Ned Sherrin's production, starring a warm and
likable Gwen Taylor, with Nick Conway, Gary Webster and Stanley Lebor,
invests the play with more poignancy than it deserves, but it is bright
and unaffected.
Indeed, Mellor's play skips along confidently and competently enough
-- she gives the audience a jolly time -- but compared with the masters
of this kind of social/emotional fare, your Willy Russells and your Alan
Ayckbourns, it's just a little run of the mill.

BETH Henley's drama about three modern-day Southern Belles is a gently
cryptic tale of sibling rivalries and love, suffused with idiosyncratic
observations which anyone who has nurtured childhood grudges, withstood
overbearing relatives, or faced, with dismay, 30 candles on the cake,
will appreciate. Strathclyde Theatre Group, directed by Bonita Beach,
tease out the subtleties beneath the surface black comedy of the
melodrama occasioned when the youngest sister, Babe, shoots her abusive
husband.
The cast have great fun with the colourful characterisations but take
care not to smother the action in sentiment, paying close attention to
the irony at play throughout the three acts and making the most of the
mordant humour: the scene where the slightly loopy Lenny and the
endearingly scatty Babe break into hysterical giggles while attempting
to deliver some grave news about their grandfather's stroke is a gem.
Mairi Gillespie's performance as Lenny is perfectly pitched. For all
her seesawing emotions she is the axis of both the family group and the
production, although she is ably supported by Lynne Livingstone as Babe,
Mia Stevenson as the sultry songstress Meg, Shona McDougall as their
dreadful cousin ''Chick the Stick'', Barry Overstreet as the dry,
fatalistic Doc Porter, and Graham Vernall as the young, enthusiastic
lawyer, Barnette.
Played out over the course of two days and set in one kitchen --
designed by Andy McMillan and Beach and stuffed with fascinating
memorabilia -- it's a somewhat rambling tale which lacks visual and
verbal impetus but STG pack it so full of energy and winning charm that
it easily holds your concentration for its three-hour duration.

<TEXT>
A BUSINESSMAN tried to evade VAT of #20,526 in a bid to escape from
his violent marriage, a court was told yesterday.
John Clarke, 38, was a partner in Bradford-based firm Pathfinders
Associates when he made a false claim for the net payment of input tax,
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard.
Depute fiscal Pauline McNeil said the fraud involved a VAT repayment
claim which was normally dealt with by the Customs and Excise computer.
She said the system was largely based on trust but, when the claim for
more than #20,000 came in, the computer selected it for verification
because of the large sum involved.
Clarke told investigators he had to buy computer equipment because his
firm was setting up a scheme to help redundant mineworkers.
However, checks showed the Dundee computer firm he claimed he had
dealt with had never traded with him.
Clarke subsequently tried to withdraw the application claim to the VAT
man saying it was ''not 100%''.
His defence solicitor, Mr Mark Hutchison, told Sheriff Richard Scott
that Clarke was now separated from his wife and in the final year of an
archaeology degree at Bournemouth University.
The lawyer said: ''He had difficulties with his marriage. He suffered
periodic violence at the hands of his wife.''
Clarke, now of Poolhill, in Bournemouth, reached the conclusion that
his marriage was at an end. He was keen to sell up and leave but there
were complications which made this difficult.
Mr Hutchison said: ''He decided he needed the cash.''
Clarke admitted the offence. His not guilty pleas to other tax evasion
charges involving other firms, including one in Edinburgh, were accepted
by the Crown.
Sheriff Scott deferred sentence until next month for background
reports.

A 10-YEAR battle to rid north Edinburgh of the pungent ''Granton
pong'' may soon be over.
Edinburgh District Council yesterday revealed talks had been held with
Lothian Chemicals over possible action to remedy the sickening stench
which has dogged the coastline from Granton to Cramond for a decade.
The firm, which specialises in recycling, fishmeal processing, and the
production of formaldehyde, moved to the foreshore in 1980 and has long
been blamed for the smell.
The council is hopeful of reaching a final agreement next week, ending
a long-running row which has led to court action on both sides in a bid
to resolve the problem.
The authority initially took the chemical company to court to rescind
its lease of the council-owned site.
Lothian Chemicals responded with a counter claim to halt the action.
Both sides have now agreed to resolve the matter outside the capital's
courtrooms.
Councillor Ian Perry, chairman of Edinburgh District Council's
environmental health committee, yesterday confirmed both sides had
employed experts to come up with a scheme to combat the problem.
''The long legal battle is coming to an end. We are hoping within two
or three weeks to have a resolution to the problem,'' he said.
He stressed the council was happy with drainage improvements recently
carried out by the company.
The new deal -- which may cost the chemical company a six-figure sum
-- will see a clean-up of the area, in the interests of good neighbour
relations. The company had previously claimed the odour preceded its
arrival on site in 1980 and had blamed earlier contamination of the area
for the smell.
Local residents, who have campaigned for years for action over the
offending smell, remain sceptical about the latest moves.
A spokesman for the Pilton Environment Group said: ''It's good that
the problem is finally being dealt with, although many people in the
area still want them (Lothian Chemicals) closed down. We'll just have to
wait and see if they behave.''

IT'S a woman's dream, as some male chauvinist will no doubt put it.
Spending the day on the telephone -- and being paid for it. Even
Industry Minister George Kynoch was singing its praises yesterday.
''Call centres'' are what they are known as.
Offices full of staff, mainly women, answering calls on anything from
airline tickets to car insurance, buying stocks and shares to even
telling you why your computer is in the huff and won't talk to you.
And for a variety of reasons Glasgow is emerging as Britain's
call-centre city. There are now about 30 centres, employing somewhere
between 5000 and 10,000 people in Glasgow.
''Economic dynamism'' is how George Kynoch described it yesterday.
Between 1979 and 1994 Scotland lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs. Very
dynamic George. But the full picture, according to the Minister, is that
in the same 25-year period, the number of service sector jobs has grown
from 50% higher than manufacturing jobs to four times the level of
manufacturing jobs.
Obviously it is time for us manufacturing-jobs junkies to stop being
so sniffy about the service sector, he implies. And particularly
noteworthy among the new jobs, he says, are the call centres.
So why are they coming to Glasgow? Well the couthy reason you will
hear is that people throughout Britain just love the Scottish accent.
Nor is it just Britain. British Airways, for example, diverts calls from
New York to Glasgow when the States are busy. You've seen the film
Braveheart? Now get some brave lass to book your next plane flight.
Nothing wrong with the accent argument. Personally speaking, listening
to a south London whine gives the same sensation as a set of nails
scratching down a blackboard. If people are happy with a Scottish lilt
then let's exploit it.
But let's not get too carried away. Businesses have a far more
overwhelming interest than how clearly their staff pronounce their
diphthongs -- and that's money. Call centres in Glasgow are, quite
simply, cheaper. A person answering a phone in Glasgow can expect to
earn #7000 to #10,000 a year, compared with the going rate of double
that in the South-east of England. In Dublin it is about #12,000 to
#13,000 a year and in the Netherlands #12,000 to #16,000.
Some jobs, to be fair, earn more, such as technical sales support
staff who earn up to #17,000 a year in Glasgow, and team leaders who can
make up to #20,000 -- still cheaper than the South-east. So although the
job won't make you a millionaire, it sure beats the dole.
Incidentally, if you think these service job wages are way below
skilled manufacturing wages, ask a fitter what he earns these days, and
you'll be surprised at how small the gap now is.
Scots staff are also more amiable, friendly, flexible, and
hard-working. And they don't leave you when you've trained them. British
Airways loses only 4% of its staff a year in Glasgow compared with a 35%
turnover when the work was done at Heathrow.
Martin Hunter at British Telecom's call centre in Glasgow, says that
''Glaswegians have a great work ethic, and take a genuine pride in their
work''. Nothing like the horrendous unemployment levels of the past two
decades to give people a great work ethic, the cynics will no doubt say.
So call centres are great. What's the problem then? Well, there may be
two problems. One is, if Glasgow is cheaper than the rest of Britain,
what happens to Glasgow when somewhere else becomes even cheaper.
Owing to rapid technology changes, people in the Philippines, India,
and other Third World countries will soon be able to tout for the
business. That, though, is more likely to affect jobs in what's called
data entry, or back-office processing.
A company gathers a lot of information and sales documentation during
the day. Theoretically it could download it to India overnight and have
the files updated cheaply for first thing next morning. Actual sales,
though, via call centres would still need a degree of local knowledge,
so are unlikely to head east just yet.
The second worry is continuing technology changes. Many similar jobs
in America were lost, not to foreign competitors, but to tape recorders.
Phone most American companies and tape recorders pass you from one
machine to another as they instruct you to press this number or that
number.
The current thinking, though, according to Graham Cook of recruitment
company Melville Craig, is that this may prove too impersonal and
frustrating for Europeans just yet who would far prefer to talk to a
human than a machine.
So call centres appear safe for the moment, indeed will continue to
grow over the next few years. No-one is willing to guarantee, however,
that they will be there in say even 10 years' time as technology changes
do just that -- change the way we do things.
This is the point where journalists get gloomy and go into their
tales-of-woe mode, suggesting the future is all black. What they should
be saying instead is that even if the call centre jobs are only here for
10 years then so be it. By that time we will have harnessed the next
wave of jobs for Glasgow by keeping one step ahead of the competition.
Or at least, that's what Glasgow Development Agency hopes to do.
It's what George Kynoch means when he talks about dynamism. But don't
forget that one man's dynamism is another's scary ride from employment
to the dole to employment again in another industry.
Not comfortable, but something our children hopefully will adapt to
far better than our generation who grew up expecting a job for life.

ON the day that thousands of black men rallied in Washington over
issues of racial hatred you could be forgiven for abandoning any hope of
fulfilling such dreams as equal opportunity or political correctness. By
timely coincidence, however, last night's concert by the chamber group
recognised, by means of subtle positive discrimination, the important
and worthy contribution females have made to the artistic canon.
Entitled Singing Outside Heaven, the programme is accompanied by an
intelligent and informative text compiled by Janice Galloway and
narrated by Morag Hood. Though focusing on the lives of the four
featured female composers, the text incorporates philosophical,
political, and critical theory, placing all of the music in historical
context and demonstrating the changing attitudes to women and
creativity.
Janet Beat was the sole living representative in the programme,
cellist Robert Irvine delivering a captivating performance of her
virtuosic study Five Projects for Joan. Presenting the cello as an
animated story-teller, bold string techniques demonstrate the
versatility of instrument and performer alike. Violinist Ruth Crouch
seized her chance to shine in Lili Boulanger's delightful miniatures
Cortege and Nocturn, the latter's impressionistic dream sequence
dripping off the fingerboard with weighty passion.
In piano trios by Clara Schumann and Fanny Mendelssohn, pianist Graeme
McNaught's empathy with Romantic music lay at the heart of wonderfully
impassioned interpretations. Schumann's robust internal structure offers
an impressive scope of emotional language throughout the four movements,
the penultimate Andante accommodating a glorious sweep of romantic
lyricism.
In an entertaining and enlightening concert the chamber group have
mastered the art of themed programming. This, along with obvious
commitment to rehearsal time, achieves an utterly professional level of
chamber music-making.

SCOTTISH Local Government Minister George Kynoch intervened in another
''jobs for the boys'' dispute at the new City of Edinburgh Council
yesterday with a pledge that the Scottish Office would take action if
necessary to ensure fairness in the make-up of council committees.
Opposition Tories had appealed to Mr Kynoch over the decision by
Labour leaders to reduce the size of selection committees for appointing
senior officials from 12 to seven members, allowing one Tory member and
one Liberal Democrat.
They initially boycotted the committees, claiming their size was being
cut to ensure the ruling Labour group could control appointments and
marginalise not only the Opposition but also any Labour members who did
not toe the line.
Mr Kynoch, in a letter to the Tory group chairman, Mr Brian Meek, said
that on a proportional basis a committee of seven should have had two
Tories and one Liberal Democrat. ''I think it is a great pity the Labour
administration did not act accordingly.''
Mr Kynoch went on to say the issue of proportional representation on
committees was one on which Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth had
warned councils they must put their houses in order. ''Failing that he
will take action by regulation if necessary,'' he stressed.
Councillor Meek said the Tories were very pleased with the promise of
possible Ministerial action.
''The Labour Party must be taught to act responsibly. Since the size
of selection committees was cut back, there has been a steady stream of
complaints about bias towards regional officials.''
But the Labour leader of the City of Edinburgh Council, Mr Keith
Geddes, who also leads Lothian Regional Council, dismissed any claims of
bias and said all appointments had been made on merit.
He added that the new council would soon be setting up its full
framework of committees and he was sure they would contain a
proportionate balance between all the three political parties
represented on the council.

FUNNY how life turns out. Fifty odd years ago two teenagers called
Betty Boothroyd and Marcus Fox were locked together in the nifty
footwork of the foxtrot, dipping, swaying, twirling, and sliding across
the resined floorboards of Vivienne Meakin's ballroom dancing school in
Dewsbury.
Not far away in Hebden Bridge a lad named Bernard Ingham was more than
likely tearing back from the nearest pithead, with an angry tale of
mining injustice for the local newspaper. Of the three, our Bernard
would seem to have moved farthest from his political roots. Boothroyd,
although holding the neutral and historic post of Speaker of the House
of Commons, has never wavered in her Labour belief. Like most of the
inhabitants of Marriott Street, she was born into it, growing up in the
outrage of its public meetings and rallies where she saw her father's
spirit broken by the uncertain pay packets of a West Yorkshire woollen
town.
For Fox, life was a shade more bay-window than that, his father's
regular employment as a bus company manager making them upwardly mobile
Tories. And that is precisely what Sir Marcus Fox remains, having
wrested the chairmanship of the Conservative 1922 Committee from its
traditional Oxbridge grandees.
But what of big Bernard? Well, he is also a knight and, although never
an MP, a consummate politico. However, the old socialism that once
flamed inside him, fierce as his red hair, has long been chucked. A
stint in Labour's HQ at Transport House convinced Ingham he was going
nowhere except up a blind alley. By then he had shed journalism for the
Civil Service, and any vestige of Labour zeal was quenched when Margaret
Thatcher looked in his direction, beamed, and beckoned. As press
secretary at No 10 his conversion was complete.
Perhaps their social paths rarely converge these days, but Boothroyd,
Fox, and Ingham still have that special Yorkshire cussedness in common.
Paul Routledge, in his unauthorised biography, Madam Speaker, published
this week, attempts to capture this in his analysis of Boothroyd, but
the book lacks direct contact with its subject. The Speaker chose to say
nowt on the project, very probably out of canniness. Why give away her
reminiscences when, in time, she can make a handsome turn on her own?
AS A result, Routledge's work labours heavily under the weight of
press cuttings and carelessly edited chatter, some of it from nameless
sources or people who vaguely query Boothroyd's Tiller Girl credentials.
The Speaker's high kicks, around the age of 17, have been well
documented elsewhere, but by the atrocious winter of 1947 she had
abandoned the spangled chorus line of London's West End to return to
Dewsbury, homesick and tired of miserable digs.
Like Ingham and Fox, however, she enjoys the good life. When state
banquets require some flashy motley, she hires a tiara, insisting that
the diamonds be real. Routledge's book doesn't contain the following
tale, but it demonstrates that, for all the pomp of her role, Madam
Speaker hasn't lost the northern art of taking the pith out of strict
delineations between the common and the refined. Not long ago she
arrived at a small dinner party, bearing a gift for the hostess, a large
felt hat from her extensive collection, and this one featuring an
extravagant plume on the brim. ''The feather's flexible,'' she chortled.
''You can stick it anywhere you want.''
The unbudgeable quality which suffuses her Order! Order! is also found
in Fox, whose Shipley constituency embraces that rock of ages, Ilkley
Moor. Invariably at the end of a local meeting there will be a bout of
stroppiness from the floor, folk demanding: ''Na' then, Marcus, we want
a referendum.'' Like as not Fox will answer: ''You're bloody well not
getting one. You buggers will just vote No, and who's the bloke who'll
be blamed for that? Me, that's who. So, you're not on.''
As for the colossus of Thistlebottom, near Hebden Bridge, Ingham still
manages to harass the press by periodically reviewing its output on
Breakfast TV. In office Margaret Thatcher liked to masquerade as a
housewife who still knew the value of knocking together bacon and eggs
for supper, and no doubt she played out this tender pretence with
Ingham's blessing while he toiled to secure that most contradictory
thing, gruff Yorkshire worldliness.
Today she frets that home is nothing if it doesn't bear a power
address, and he returns to the thrusting chimneys of a redundant mill
town hanging on the great wide thighs of the Pennines. Funny how life
turns out.

WHAT is conservatism? Two things over the past week have drawn my mind
to the question. One, of course, was the Tory conference at Brighton --
which, contrary to expectation, went well for John Major.
Then there was the quiet death of Lord Home of the Hirsel. I met Home
once, lunched with him and his wife at their Borders home, interviewed
him for this paper. I had expected to find a giggly, vague Bertie
Wooster of a fellow. But I left struck by his grip on world events --
though he was then 87 -- and the acuity of his mind.
Anyway, Home deceased and the seaside Tories set me thinking. What is
conservatism? And why am I not one?
First things first. The conservative philosophy of government puts
prime emphasis on order. (I prefer ''order'' to ''society'' because the
meaning is tighter.) There is an instinctive distrust of excitement, of
radicalism, of the revolutionary. There is, indeed, a healthy distaste
for politics generally. As Chris Patten argued in 1983, politics is not
all of life. Life is about family, music, paintings, walks in the wood,
friendship, hard work, love, sorrow. The mind which thinks politics is
all that matters is a mind possessed.
There is also, I think, a realistic view of human nature. True
conservatism is founded on a belief in original sin. There is an
awareness of human weakness and human depravity. (Marxism failed because
it ignored man's natural selfishness and corruption.) Conservatism,
then, has a healthy shot of pessimism. It is suspicious of the utopian
vision. Statecraft should strive to minimise suffering, protect the weak
from the strong, uphold the law. It should not be deployed in a futile
quest for heaven on earth.
From this naturally flows a sceptical view of the state. The left sees
the state as the solution to all ills. They do what? Ban it. They need
what? Give it at once. He earns what? Far too much; tax him. There's
fighting in Bongo-Bongo? Mobilise our boys. The No 14 bus doesn't go
down Acacia Gardens? Well, it certainly should.
Conservatives, by contrast, see the state as part of the problem. It
goes off with lots of your money, money you'd be better spending
yourself. Accountability is poor: give the same job to private
enterprise, or to public employees, and the latter will always do it
more slowly, very expensively, and not very well. It grows, like Topsy:
ever drawing to itself power, might, and limbs. And, besides, we believe
in human depravity: has this century not shown what evils men and women,
given untrammeled power and modern technology, may wreak on the earth?
Conservatism is about ideas, not ideology. In a sense, it doesn't want
to be an ''ism'' at all. The true conservative, in government, is doing
an onerous job, not strapping on his sword in a holy crusade. He keeps
the state running. He is trying to prevent things growing worse. He
thinks of lots of little ways of making things go better. Each social
crisis, each controversy, the fighting in Bongo-Bongo, the No 14 bus --
to each there is some separate solution, and each must be judged on its
merits and in the context of cool pragmatism.
And he never forgets that some problems have no solution, and there
are many, many things in which the state is not obliged to have
involvement, express a view or wield a policy. The conservative state
upholds the law, interferes with its citizens as little as possible, and
spends public money as if it was drawing teeth.
I am, come to think of it, a natural, dyed-blue-in-the-wool
conservative. And yet, it is inconceivable -- for the present -- that I
would endorse our own Conservative Party, join its ranks or look for its
glory. Various personal considerations aside, why not?
First, because it seems to me that British Conservatism, at present,
is not conservative at all. In the heyday of Thatcher the party fled far
from its moorings, became something that would have been quite
unrecognisable to Disraeli, Baldwin, or Macleod. It became, in fact, the
reincarnation of laissez-faire Manchester Liberalism -- aggressive,
mean, intolerant. More recently the party has slid back to a soggy,
defensive posture, maintaining power its first concern, with no stomach
for radical surgery.
Yet, in the age of Major the Conservatives have shed other traditional
values. The National Lottery debases our country and mocks all rhetoric
of good housekeeping. The overall tax burden has increased; indeed, we
pay more tax in 1995, as a percentage of our incomes, than we did in
1979 under Labour. The One Nation vision writhes on its death bed. The
poor are marginalised; other losers in society -- single mothers,
criminals, those on public welfare -- are demonised, kicked for cheap
thrills on the conference platform. Increasingly the Conservatives are
the party of English nationalism. They retain little credibility in
Scotland, none at all in Wales, and have quite abandoned Northern
Ireland.
We don't have Conservatives today; we have Tories. Vulgar, well-off,
immoral folk who see politics not as a field for service (like Home), or
as an arena for sweeping reform (like Thatcher), but as a high plateau
to occupy to further the interests of themselves and their class. So
it's clobber all unions, subsidies, and restrictions (except in
agriculture); no help for those burned in the Stock Exchange (if it's
the Western Isles, not Barlow Clowes); revile those who make unplanned
babies (unless they're Cecil Parkinson); keep the defence industry in
Tory seats (unless it's live nuclear submarines, in which case they want
them as far from England as possible).
There remains, incredibly, a complete lack of imagination on the
constitution. It is plain to anyone -- at home or abroad -- that the
British body politic is sick to the core. We need a Bill of Rights,
expressly limiting the sovereignty of Parliament. We need real power --
and accountability -- restored to local government. We need a Freedom of
Information Act. The aspirations of Scotland must be addressed, not
insultingly dismissed. We need reform of our voting system.
Last week is a solemn reminder that none of us can write John Major
off. The possibility of his re-election -- so help us -- has surfaced
again in the public mind. But I want servants back in the Cabinet, not
Gauleiters. I want an open mind on constitutional reform. I think his
own party should be put in order -- stripped of jingoism, elitism,
snobberty, Anglomania. I think it should be democratised, and that its
conferences and assemblies should become places of genuine debate, not
massed gatherings of the fans.
None of this, of course, is going to happen. So I think the SNP will
have my vote for a wee while yet.

SCOTLAND's first professor in gender relations was yesterday appointed
at the University of Dundee, a chair which will put the university at
the forefront of international research in this field.
Professor Gerda Siann, a graduate of the University of Capetown, South
Africa, is currently professor of psychology at Caledonian University,
Glasgow, and will see her work funded by banking technology company A T
&amp; T.
Professor Siann said yesterday that she looked forward to the
challenge of her post because there was currently a great public
interest in gender issues in education and employment.
Her present work in Glasgow had been considering ways of increasing
the proportion of women and ethnic minorities in vocational areas where
they had been traditionally under-represented.

A #1M project to help safeguard some of Scotland's most endangered
wildlife from extinction by using genetic fingerprinting techniques is
to be launched in Aberdeen today.
The opening of the Ecological Molecular Genetics (EMG) Laboratory at
Aberdeen University will enable scientists to study otters and other
rare species, the fluctuating population of red grouse, and help the
survival of the water vole.
It will also allow them to investigate why winter moths are damaging
Scottish moors by eating spruce and heather.
Scientists from the university will work on the scheme with colleagues
from the Natural Environment Research Council's Institute of Terrestrial
Ecology (ITE) at Banchory.
Dr Phil Bacon, of the ITE, said the laboratory, with three new
full-time staff, should help ensure the long-term survival of endangered
species.
Super-sensitive methods requiring only traces of DNA from hairs,
feathers, or droppings will allow detailed studies to be carried out.
He said otters were a good example because they were extremely
difficult to catch, but modern techniques of DNA testing allow them to
identify individual otters.
Scotland is one of the last European countries to have a large, stable
otter population.
Until recently, DNA testing was only possible from larger animals such
as bears.
A six-month pilot project on the rapid decline of water voles and the
wide fluctuations in the red grouse population has already shown that
the new hi-tech approach allows a more accurate and cost effective study
of wildlife.
Dr Bacon said the conventional method of catching and ringing the
birds only covered around one third to one half of the population in a
study area.
''That is not good enough,'' he said. ''Using DNA over even a small
area we can have samples from up to 90% of the population giving a
better picture of the family structure.''
Water voles in the UK have declined considerably in recent years,
possibly due to escaped mink. The research hopes to explain why isolated
populations reappear.

<HEADLINE>Judge swayed by victim's letter. Mercy for man who stabbed wife six times</HEADLINE>

A JEALOUS husband who repeatedly stabbed his unfaithful wife was shown
mercy by a Judge yesterday.
Lord Osborne said he took into account a ''very remarkable'' letter
from the victim, informing the court that Gordon MacKenzie was a kind
and loving father whose actions were out of character.
The judge also took the view that MacKenzie, now divorced, had been
''highly provoked'' by his former wife and deferred sentence on him for
one year.
MacKenzie, 27, of Whitehill Drive, Blackburn, West Lothian, admitted
stabbing his wife Wendy to her severe injury in their home in Bruce
Road, Bathgate, on November 19 last year.
Advocate-depute Iain Bonomy, QC, told the High Court in Edinburgh that
the couple had been married for four-and-a-half years and had a
four-year-old son.
MacKenzie did not like his wife working part-time in a Bathgate
discotheque at weekends.
Unknown to her husband she began seeing another man and the couple
decided on a trial separation, although they were still living in the
same house.
On the night of the attack Mrs MacKenzie left the discotheque at
1.15am and, after going to a party, went to a man's house before
returning home at 6am.
By that time her husband was getting ready to go out to work and was
telephoning his mother to see if she could look after the couple's son.
When Mrs MacKenzie arrived, a row developed and McKenzie stabbed her
six times.
She needed an emergency blood transfusion and might have died had she
not received prompt medical attention.
MacKenzie, an electrician, later told police: ''I did it because she
was mucking about with three or four different guys. I am really sorry
for what I have done.''
Miss Joyce Powrie, defence counsel, said that MacKenzie, a first
offender, had been divorced from his wife in August this year.
Despite that, she had written a letter to the court saying that her
ex-husband was a kind and loving father whose actions were out of
character. MacKenzie's former in-laws had also written a letter
supporting him.
She explained that at the time of the assault MacKenzie was concerned
because his wife had been out so late and might not be in a fit state to
look after their son.
Lord Osborne told the accused that normally an offence of this kind
would attract a prison sentence of some length.
However, the circumstances were highly exceptional. MacKenzie had been
highly provoked and he was a first offender in a steady job providing
for his son.
Referring to the character references, the judge said he regarded them
as of considerable importance.
''What is very remarkable in my view is that among these there are
first a letter from your ex-wife setting out her view of your character,
which is entirely favourable and indicating that your action was totally
out of character.
''I think just as remarkable is the letter from your ex-parents-in-law
along similar lines.
''All these circumstances have persuaded me that the imposition of a
sentence of imprisonment would be destructive and unnecessary.''

THE mandarins within the Scottish Office could scarcely be more
bullish about the contentious Private Finance Initiative. They are
supremely confident that private sector involvement in the procurement
of capital projects within the public sector is here to stay.
There may have been teething problems, but the troubles and doubts are
diminishing by the day, according to senior sources. They are adamant
that PFI is becoming acceptable more and more as the means to deliver
services and infrastructure more quickly and efficiently.
However, the civil servants in charge of overseeing the policy were at
an utter loss for words to explain the collapse of private financing for
upgrading the West Coast main line. It is a cornerstone of Tory boasts
about introducing private capital into the railway network.
Privatisation of the line has been postponed indefinitely; it would
appear the private sector is not prepared to take all the risks
associated with a #1000m modernisation programme without guarantees of a
reasonable return.
Labour's Scottish Transport spokesman, Henry McLeish, believes that
potential investors have been scared off by the confusion and chaos
surrounding the relentless drive to privatise the line despite doubts
over who would meet the refurbishment costs.
However, although arguing that the PFI is at the core of the problem,
he has signalled a Labour Government would hope to reassess the
legislation in the hope that private-sector investment for major
infrastructure projects can be attracted.
Mr McLeish believes it is possible to create the right conditions in
which private capital for public works would be available.
Labour, he said, would seek a public-sector partnership for a West
Coast refurbishment. Risk control was crucial, and the MP hinted a
Labour Government would help share the risks by using public money
currently going on the privatisation process.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown has also acknowledged the principle
behind PFI. Despite dimissing the current system as a testimony for
failure, he concedes that infrastructure can be improved ''through the
partnership approach''.
On the other hand, colleague George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish
Secretary, believes that the Build, Own and Operate schemes proposed for
water and sewerage amount to semi-privatisation. Other critics argue
that BOO will be more costly in the long term, and is a means of
generating extra profits for private capital at public expense.
Robertson has pointed to a report by an American bank which estimated
costs of financing a single sewage treatment plant would rise from #201m
under conventional public sector financing to #337m if the private
sector was brought in.
But Scottish Office Industry Minister George Kynoch ridicules the
findings, commissioned by Strathclyde Regional Council as part of its
water referendum campaign. He shot down the arguments on grounds that
the report used financial structures ill-suited to the PFI and wrongly
assumed private company construction costs would not be cheaper.
Responsible for co-ordinating PFI since the return of Michael Forsyth
to the Scottish Office, Kynoch believes 20% of the #5000m needed to
upgrade Scotland's water and sewage systems could be provided through
BOO schemes.
He accepts funds could be provided by additional public expenditure,
but argues cuts in other services like health and education would be
inevitable if the ''value for money option'' of private finance was
ignored.
The Scottish Office view is that PFI is a successful means of going
ahead with infrastructure projects earlier than otherwise possible
because of a lack of public funds.
One theory is that its support is based mainly upon diluting Treasury
arguments that Scotland's current share of public money is far too high.
But senior sources only referred repeatedly to achieving the main
objectives of PFI, as spelled out by the Government -- transferring risk
and responsibility to the private sector, and providing value for money.
They see the initiative as providing more work, and profit, for the
private sector while delivering the required infrastructure and services
at less cost to the taxpayer.
The sources denied PFI has stalled, with potential private-sector
partners put off by the many layers of red tape which have to be
negotiated before action can take place.
They also denied that PFI was back-door privatisation; the public
sector would define what services would be provided. Only in rare cases
would public-sector finance not be required, as in the case of the Skye
Bridge where the money will be recouped via tolls lasting up to 17
years.
One official was adamant that what counts is the actual delivery of
projects, with #192m worth of schemes already completed, in progress
with contracts let, or under negotiation in just 36 months.
He insisted that the public sector's record in provision has often
been grim, including the building of facilities that turned out to be
either too large or too small or technologically inadequate.
A publicly-built hospital, for example, could cost 30% more than
estimated, and take years more to complete than originally planned.
Under PFI parnerships, costs could be better controlled -- not only
determined in advance, but fixed.
The private sector also had the incentive of generating savings down
the years by using its entrepreneurial and financial management skills
in particular.
According to the Scottish Office, both public-sector agencies and
private-sector contractors had approached PFI with caution. But both
were now ''beginning to change as a number of schemes get into the final
stages of approval''.
The sources said projects will increase as PFI fast becomes the
preferred route of procurement for capital projects. One senior official
denied that red tape was a problem, arguing the private sector had to
identify carefully what the risks and opportunities were before
concluding contracts.
PFI schemes required novel approaches by both public and private
sectors, and one official said: ''I am hopeful that perceptions will be
very different in a few months' time. PFI is here to stay, and the value
of projects is likely to increase in the near future.''
The Scottish Office accepted it has led the way in the UK, but added
it is only following the Chancellor's policy that the Treasury will not
provide capital spending until PFI options have been examined
thoroughly.

Iain Wilson investigates the new Government trend of private financial
initiatives which has been most warmly embraced by the Scottish Office
and includes the flagship #23.6m Skye bridge
SENIOR Scottish Office civil servants are predicting a dramatic change
in attitudes within the next few months towards the Government's
controversial Private Finance Initiative as more and more projects come
up for grabs.
They also stressed that not one area of services or infrastructure
which have been regarded traditionally as the exclusive domain of the
public sector is now sacrosanct from private-sector involvement in their
provision or financing.
Three years have passed since the then Chancellor, Norman Lamont,
launched the PFI as a means to cut Government borrowing but also to meet
soaring demands for capital spending on much-needed infrastructure,
including roads, hospitals, water, and sewerage.
The Scottish Office -- which embraced the ideology more than any other
Government department -- believes that its leading role was, and is,
fully justified.
So far, more than #2Om worth of capital projects have been completed
in the Scottish health sector. The flagship #23.6m Skye bridge, which
also has its critics, has also been completed. It is estimated that
another #21m worth of PFI initiatives are underway.
In addition, invitations to tender are out for projects valued at
#125m, including a new #60m Hairmyres and Stonehouse hospital, which
also has its detractors, and Build, Own and Operate (BOO) projects
valued at #45m for a Fort William sewage-treatment plant and main
drainage work in Inverness.
Six consortia, meanwhile, are bidding to complete the A74 upgrading to
motorway standard, which could be worth #100m under the BOO initiative.
The venture is the first of its kind in Scotland, and represents a
marked departure from traditional local authority procurement and
operation methods.
The winner will design, build, finance, and operate the road for
between 25 and 30 years in exchange for payments from the Government.
The construction industry in particular is relying upon PFI
opportunities to bridge the gap in demand caused by lingering effects of
the recession, mainly in the housing market.
Amey, one of the bidders for the A74 work, is optimistic that the
Government bid to move infrastructure projects out of the public sector
will result soon in much more work for the industry.
That view contrasts sharply with Taylor Woodrow, whose chairman, Colin
Parson, believes PFI is ''obviously constipated'' and not working.
Tarmac has described delays in granting PFI projects as irritating and
frustrating, but acknowledges the contracts need to be prepared
carefully. Alfred McAlpine's predicts construction volume will be lower
next year -- with little help in the short term from the PFI, which it
believes is blocking almost all public-sector contract awards because
they first must be considered for private financing.
Wimpey plans to concentrate on partnerships, provided the Treasury
offers enough financial support, but has warned the logjam in
progressing projects must be broken.
The Building Employers' Confederation says the Government's refusal to
approve capital projects until private-finance options are checked has
led to a ''serious hiatus in the placing of public-sector construction
orders''.
It also complains that the cost of preparing tenders, which are up to
#500,000 in some cases, is so prohibitively expensive that the
involvement of small and medium-sized firms is limited.
Such examples of conflicting views are many, but faith in the
contentious doctrine of PFI was underlined recently by the creation of
the Conmore Partnership, a consortium of leading construction and
corporate finance specialists.
Conmore, backed by Glasgow-based MPM Adams, the country's largest firm
of construction project managers, and by Noble and Company, the
Edinburgh-based corporate finance specialists, aims to take advantage of
opportunities by acting as both catalyst and nucleus in bringing
together the expertise for joint ventures.
Indeed, the Scottish Office has already drawn up a list of potential
schemes which are worth #2684m, with another half-dozen projects
expected to go out to tender before the end of the year.
The list includes a new #140m Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh; a new #90m
Law Hospital in Lanarkshire, possibly rising to #115m, and #60m to
redevelop Glasgow's Western Infirmary.
The Scottish Office has also identified 15 potential BOO schemes for
water and sewerage developments the length and breadth of Scotland,
valued at #1000m over the next 15 years.
Other proposals include a second road bridge across the Forth, costing
#350m; a #500m heating scheme for houses in Glasgow's peripheral
estates; a #30m light transit link between Edinburgh airport and the
city centre, and a #90m road scheme to link the M74 and M8 in Central
Scotland.
The total value for potential projects is rising all the time. The
latest Scottish Office estimate stands at #2750m, with additional
proposals including, among others, a further-education centre at
Stirling and a new hospital at Cumnock.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, a PFI stalwart, has already
announced it will be extended to the public education service: he wants
private developers to build a further-education college at a cost of
between #3m and #4m in his Stirling constituency.
According to further-education sources, the college will not be built
if dependent on public money because the Scottish Office is reluctant to
commit large amounts of capital to projects in single tranches.
The company awarded the contract will get its money back, and more,
from the rental from buildings which will offer places for up to 400
students in business, computing, secretarial, health, and social and
leisure studies courses.
It has also been confirmed that a new community hospital in Cumnock,
although operated by NHS people for NHS patients, will be financed under
the PFI.
The announcement by Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton of private-sector involvement in the contract, worth
#8.6m in the construction phase and #3.4m a year in annual running
costs, has provoked anger in Ayrshire.
Local Labour MP George Foulkes claims he was told the project would be
a public one, and added he was ''flabbergasted'' that private finance
was being sought.
The protests are even more intense over the Skye Bridge, opened
yesterday by Mr Forsyth. Skye and Lochalsh district councillors and
other locals are furious that tolls were fixed at #5.20 a car, just 20p
less than the ferry fare.
The opening was boycotted by MPs Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty, and
Skye) and Calum Macdonald (Western Isles), and the district council.
Mr Kennedy dismissed Mr Forsyth's comments at the recent Tory Party
conference that the bridge was an example of private finance being
successfully involved in a major project. He said the tolls were causing
huge resentment locally.
Despite all the politicking about increased competition arising from
private-finance initiatives, the bridge is set to have a monopoly on
travel to and from the island.
The Government-owned Caledonian-MacBrayne abandoned its Skye ferry
service on the very day the bridge opened. Before then, local
businessmen who wanted to run a small ferry in its place were told they
would not be granted rights.
The Office of Fair Trading has found that no such rights were needed,
but it has been alleged other hurdles have been placed in front of the
Skye Boat Company which is still searching for a suitable vessel to
compete with the road crossing.
It is clear that the PFI is becoming increasingly relevant as
Government departments throughout the UK face reductions in spending
budgets to make funds available for pre-election tax cuts.
The Tory push has not faltered an inch even after Sir Alastair Morton,
chairman of Eurotunnel, who headed up the private-finance panel, stepped
down to concentrate on his company's troubles -- and the Treasury
official who ran the unit took a job outwith the Civil Service.
It is also clear that the principle behind the new method of public
procurement will survive a Labour victory at the next General Election;
the party is slowly but surely embracing the partnership approach
towards improving infrastructure.
In England, a #300m Severn river crossing will be completed next year
by Laing's in a joint PFI venture with France's GTN Entrepose and backed
by BZW and Bank of America.
Other major contracts south of the Border involve #400m worth of
trains for London Underground's Northern Line, and at least #120m for a
new National Insurance computer system.
It is estimated some #4500m worth of projects has still to be awarded
in England. The sums are impressive, but the suspicion remains that some
schemes are being held back -- by an excessively cautious Government.
The Royal Bank of Scotland's chief economist, Jeremy Peat, says the
caution is based on fears that schemes could result in windfall gains
for private companies.
He also blames delays on unrealistic attempts to make efficiency
comparisons between public and private-sector funding, and on the
private sector's reluctance to reveal the full extent of efficiency
savings they would hope to make.

A new computer system offers customers the chance to take part in a
lucrative horse-racing venture. Stranger to the track Mike Stanger
checks the odds
BETTING syndicates are not illegal in this country. But a new
computer-based system being offered for sale in Britain offers an
intriguing approach which, if it works, bookmakers might be powerless to
expose.
But members of the horse-racing fraternity are unanimous that the
''Exit V Investment Programme'', ''proudly marketed'' by Comstrad Ltd,
is unlikely to live up to its claims.
Under the system, a maximum of 500 people at any one time, carefully
spread around Britain, are allowed to participate. Each individual parts
with #3300 (including VAT) to purchase the software. The computer disks
contain, in effect, a spreadsheet which calculates which horse should be
backed.
The user is instructed to key in certain statistical details about the
horses, gleaned from the pages of the Racing Post. Everyone inputs the
same information into his own personal computer. And the software does
the same calculations on the same information on up to 500 computers
around the country -- all coming up with the same answer, the horse to
back.
At this stage, each participant places his bet with a local bookie.
That bet is 5% of the participant's current ''working capital bank'' of
funds -- which in itself must never exceed #10,000 at the end of the
month. You can start with a bank of as little as #500, but once you've
built this up to five figures with your winnings, you must withdraw the
excess profits each month.
So, with 500 people placing bets of up to #800 on some occasions,
there could be anything up to #400,000 riding on the calculated horse in
each race.
And, if you believe the figures in the company's expensively produced
brochure, the system can typically yield more than #50,000 of profit per
participant every year -- that would be #25m in total.
I wondered what the racing establishment thought of this manipulative
scheme. The Jockey Club had no views: press officer John Maxie said
there were many types of betting syndicate, and it was a matter for the
bookmakers.
Norman Wilson, president of the Scottish Bookmaker's Protection
Association, said: ''Anyone who wants to back horses can do so. Over the
piece, there are plenty who have left their money behind.''
Bookmakers, it seems, have thrived whenever anyone has followed a
system or a syndicate. But Wilson was at great pains to explain how the
2[1/2]% betting tax had wiped out bookmakers' profits. I tried hard not
to weep.
Bookmakers have their own computer-based systems, I was told, which
would spot unusual betting patterns very early on. ''We would be able to
adjust the odds well before the start of the race,'' said Wilson.
So I turned to Tom Clarke, editor of the Sporting Life. When he heard
the details, he reacted with alarm. ''This is a con,'' he said bluntly.
''People are being ripped off. Horse racing is not a science. There is
no way statistics can predict a winner.'' He resolved to warn his
readers about the company and its scheme.
But, as a complete innocent in such matters, I was still intrigued.
The brochure which had dropped unsolicited through my letter-box was
disarmingly seductive.
The ''Exit V Investment Programme'' is, I was informed, a
''technological breakthrough enabling the average small investor access
to information formerly only available to wealthy operators . . . this
programme can provide a permanent income using almost any home
computer.''
If I wished to gamble, it said, this programme was not for me: ''There
is no adrenalin rush . . . simply a secure form of investment, utilising
the absolute leading edge in computer programming technology.''
And the brochure was not shy in claiming staggering profits. Its
centre-spread shows an impressive bar chart -- ''an accurate simulation
of all transactions'' -- the opening bank of #500 building up quickly to
#8000 in three months. ''If you sustain a loss over the first full three
months, the company will refund that full amount,'' says the brochure,
reassuringly.
In month four, the bank hits pay dirt, reaching #14,000. You must at
the end of each month go to your bookie and withdraw the excess over
#10,000 remember.
In month five, verisimilitude shows a small setback: the ''working
capital bank'' drops to #9500. But, from then on, it's dancing in the
streets every month -- obliging you to withdraw between #4000 and
#10,000 of ''profits'' each month.
When I rang the company an extremely friendly Antipodean voice greeted
me and explained the system in more detail.
First, it is important not to distort the betting marketplace. That's
why there are only 500 participants at any one time, why they are
carefully dotted around Britain, and why bets should be restricted to 5%
of the current bank. Otherwise the odds would shorten and profits
decline.
There are therefore only 50 participants in all of Scotland, I was
told, and just 15 in the whole of Glasgow.
Next, the only ''instruction'' which comes from the ''investment
company'' itself is that the programme should be applied only to the top
three races, the most valuable, at one particular meeting each Saturday.
I was told that each participant can work out for himself which three
races these are from the Racing Times.
And I was told that the races chosen are the ones which feature the
top horses, jockeys, and trainers -- those for which there is most
information about form and track record.
The company which came up with this idea seems anxious to put pressure
on its customers to conform. At the back of the brochure is a
''Statutory Declaration'' which the participant is invited to sign in
front of a solicitor. It's not clear which statute is being invoked.
I was also invited to declare that I would not copy the computer
program illegally, that I would not increase the monthly capital bank
applicable to the program beyond #10,000, and that the profits will not
be used to increase personal profit pro-rata to the disadvantage of
other holders of the program.
The company has so far presumably gathered in #1.5m from the sales of
its ''investment programme''. But it disclaims responsibilities. We are
not investment advisers, says the brochure, we do not make profit of any
kind from your investments.
''As with all investments, for someone to win, someone else has to
lose. This is all about placing you on the right side of the ledger.''
Some might believe this to be a fitting epitaph for our time.

A HENPECKED husband who snapped and bludgeoned his ''domineering''
wife to death with a hammer after 30 years of marriage was jailed for
three years for her manslaughter at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Brian Stedman, 54, was ''nagged from the time he came through the door
about the smallest thing'', said Mr Vivian Robinson, QC, defending. Mrs
Jean Stedman even blamed her husband when someone else ran into his
parked car.
The court was told the couple had not had sexual intercourse since
their son was born in 1972, but their relationship endured because
Stedman was a long-distance lorry driver and spent weeks on the road.
Then he lost his job. ''His life at home became utter misery,'' said
Mr Robinson.
Finally the ''normally placid and unaggressive'' Stedman lost control,
picked up a hammer, and hit her 13 times on the head with it. He went to
his daughter's house and told her: ''I have had enough. I have done her
in. I am going down the police station.''
Stedman, from Romford, east London, denied murdering his wife last
November, but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished
responsibility. His plea was accepted by the court.
Jailing him, the Recorder of London, Sir Lawrence Verney, said: ''It
is quite clear from what I have been told that your wife had nagged
incessantly and in very violent terms.
''What it was that caused the final break in your hitherto very
patient existence is not entirely clear, but there was a break and your
responsibility for what you did was substantially diminished. But there
does remain a responsibility for having taken her life,'' the judge
added.
Stedman was diagnosed as suffering from clinical depression at the
time of the killing.
He was ''normally passive, unemotional, and not given to aggression in
any extreme way''. ''He kept his feelings deep inside himself,'' said Mr
Nigel Sweeney, prosecuting.
Mrs Stedman had started suffering from the menopause but despite
advice had declined to seek treatment, said Mr Sweeney.
''This made the bad side of her character worse, nagging endlessly
about things. On one occasion her son-in-law had expelled her from the
house and she kicked the door with such force it broke the lock.''

As uncertainty surrounds the Free Church of Scotland's most
charismatic voice, Chris Holme describes the impact of events on the man
and his church
IT has been a desperately divisive issue for the Free Church of
Scotland and one which at times has threatened to rend it asunder. And
as the Crown Office ponder on whether or not to bring charges, Professor
Donald Macleod, probably the church's most charismatic and
intellectually gifted voice, waits and wonders about his future. For
almost a decade waves of allegations about his personal life have hit
the church, then receded, only to return again.
''The effect of the whole thing is that I am physically and mentally a
spent force. I cannot raise myself even to the level of seeking justice
for myself,'' he said.
Professor Macleod, who holds the chair of systematic theology at the
Free Church College in Edinburgh, was not present at the assembly in May
when, after two days of deliberation, his church found there was no
substance in allegations made against him. Although the church
authorities decided to take no action the matter was still investigated
by Lothians and Borders Police.
This investigation has been completed, and the Crown Office will
decide if criminal proceedings should be undertaken.
''It must be borne in mind that I believe what is on trial here is my
personality and my theology, not anything else. The object all along has
been to bring it out into the open and then a trial by media. Their
whole concern was to embarrass me,'' claimed Professor Macleod.
He said he and his opponents represented two different religions,
their campaign being fuelled beyond his understanding.
''From my point of view, my calling is to bring good news to the world
and to preach the love of God. I think those that are opposed to me come
from a more separatist and exclusivist tradition,'' he added.
The allegations, all of which he has vigorously denied, date back to
summer lectures he delivered during the mid-1980s in Melbourne and
Sydney.
A letter arrived from an Australian minister, referred to claims made
by a woman Professor Macleod had met, telling him ''Your sin is out''.
Five years later the woman retracted her claims.
In the interim, the first wave of letters began circulating among
ministers in the Free Church and other faiths in England. It came to the
attention of senior members of the church but they dismissed it as not
worthy of investigation.
Meanwhile in 1989, allegations surfaced from a second woman. She had
met Professor Macleod before moving to England. There she began
attending the Eden Baptist Church in Cambridge, whose congregation
numbered supporters of the influential doctor turned evangelical
preacher, Dr D Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
There were also links with the Banner of Truth Trust, Dr Lloyd-Jones's
publishers. Professor Macleod was also an assistant editor for a trust
but left after disagreements.
It was from Cambridge that allegations about the professor, distrusted
by some because of his relatively liberal view of theology, began to
assume a coherent form.
A third woman came forward and alleged an incident involving Professor
Macleod. She continued to attend Bible classes run by him.
Professor Macleod was asked to meet the church's training and ministry
committee in April 1993. It is responsible for all aspects of the
college including initial consideration of complaints against
professors.
In each case the committee decided to take no further action. There
was a measure of internal dissent, some decisions going through on the
narrowest of margins.
All churches have experienced great difficulty in dealing with
allegations of a sexual nature against priests or ministers in positions
of trust. They lack training in dealing with such problems and often act
in accordance with cumbersome procedures and rules drawn up in the last
century.
Such difficulties are compounded in a relatively small Christian
community like the Free Church where people know those involved
personally.
In 1994 a minority on the committee urged the General Assembly to
consult the church lawyers. They found there was insufficient evidence
to warrant further investigation.
The whole issue might have been settled then, but for a further series
of allegations by three women last October. These were investigated by
the police and formed part of the report which has since gone to the
fiscal.
At this year's assembly, the issue surfaced yet again amid a welter of
unwelcome media interest. Despite the assembly's vote not to proceed
with the libel, there remained a substantive rump of around one-third of
the membership who took the highly unusual step of recording their
dissent.
The deadlock is far from broken. Supporters of the professor say he
has been treated appallingly and his adversaries have simply exploited
the church administrative machinery merely to concoct new allegations.
His opponents argue that it is not a personal vendetta and has nothing
at all to do with his theology. They say that seeking a hearing of the
libel at the assembly was the best way for him to vindicate himself and
establish his innocence.
This argument, dismissed as nonsensical by Professor Macleod, was
propounded after the assembly by his brother-in-law, the Rev Angus
Smith, in a letter to the Stornoway Gazette. Some within the church feel
his revelations in the letter of voting patterns may lead to
disciplinary action for breach of confidentiality.
Either way, there remains an excruciating dilemma for the church. As
with most moral dilemmas, there is no easy resolution.

The team that Tony Blair could lead into the next General Election
will be revealed tomorrow and, as Benedict Brogan explains, several
Scottish members are favoured as main players
THE 270 MPs of the Parliamentary Labour Party will tomorrow vote to
elect the Shadow Cabinet. The annual beauty contest is being anxiously
watched this year by leader Tony Blair and his supporters: with a
General Election imminent, the victors will, in all likelihood, form the
first Blair Cabinet, and the leader is determined to have the people he
wants -- as opposed to the people others want -- by his side when he
walks into Downing Street.
Nominations, which require the signature of only one MP, closed last
night. There are 42 MPs standing, including Shadow Cabinet incumbents.
Blair and his deputy John Prescott are ex-officio members.
This year the Shadow Cabinet expands by one, to 19, after Blair's
decision to make the post of Chief Whip an appointment from the Shadow
Cabinet, rather than the subject of a separate election. MPs can vote
for up to 19 of the nominees, and must vote for at least four women. The
19 with the most votes are elected.
Betting on the outcome is a sure way to lose money. Although one or
two members of the Shadow Cabinet are voted off each year, and others
added, predicting who will fall and who will succeed is an
impossibility. This year two Scots lead the field of those tipped as
''most likely to get on''. Brian Wilson and Alistair Darling are admired
for their hard work, for the success they have made of their front-bench
responsibilities, and for their ease in front of the cameras.
But talent alone is not a guarantee of success. Supporters of both men
readily admit that the jealousies and suspicions which seethe beneath
the PLP's surface could play against their candidates.
Internal divisions over the direction in which the party is being led
by its modernising leader could persuade disgruntled back-benchers to
use these elections to remind Blair of their concerns. After a summer of
infighting, tomorrow's result will give a crucial indication of Blair's
support among back-benchers.
Brian Wilson, the 46-year-old Cunninghame North MP, is the
leadership's favourite. His support is reported to have grown in the
past week and he is considered to have the strongest chance of
dislodging one of the Shadow Cabinet's weaker members.
As transport spokesman last year he led Labour's highly-successful
attack on railway privatisation, and this year led the support for
Blair's scrapping of Clause 4. His closing speech at the special
conference to ratify the change last April helped to clinch victory for
the leadership.
But the world of the Shadow Cabinet elections is one where merit must
often take a back-seat to jealousy and ideology, and Wilson's success,
and close identification with the Blair wing of the party, may also
prove a liability.
One of his supporters said: ''Brian gets enormous marks for activity
and enthusiasm. If anything his problem is that he has too high a
profile. He gets up people's noses.''
Fans of Alistair Darling, 41, Labour's front-bench City spokesman,
bemoan his refusal to involve himself in the networking required to
attract PLP support. Instead, he is noted as a hard worker, who is
praised for the skill with which he has improved the party's image in
the worlds of business and industry.
He is standing for the third time, and on previous attempts has been
further behind the field than Wilson. But sources in Blair's office are
firm in their belief that even if he falls short this year, a place will
be found for him in a Blair Cabinet once Labour is in office.
One source in Blair's office said: ''There is a pivotal point that's
reached for people like Brian and Alistair. A lot of their colleagues
harbour ambitions that are as yet unfulfilled, or will never be
fulfilled. They often look with suspicion on those who come up fast and
who, they feel, should first work their passage. You can never tell when
the PLP will decide someone has worked their passage''.
The other Scots standing include transport spokesman Henry McLeish,
who has made a good summer out of the chaos of railway privatisation and
is considered a long-term Shadow Cabinet prospect; George Foulkes, the
Carrick MP and Overseas Aid spokesman; Paisley North MP Irene Adams; and
the former Shadow Scottish Secretary Tom Clarke, who was voted off last
year.
The current Shadow Cabinet contains a number of MPs whose presence is
attributable to the strong support of regional or left-wing factions
rather than their close support for Blair. His followers are understood
to be pressing the leader to consider scrapping the current system
altogether.
They want Labour to imitate the Tories and place the choice of the
Shadow Cabinet firmly in the hands of the party leader. Although Blair
has made clear he has no plans to change the rules, he would prefer not
to leave it to the whim of his back-benchers.
One suggestion is that next year, in anticipation of a Labour victory,
Blair should be given the right to appoint his Cabinet-in-waiting.
Elections would be reinstated once Labour returned to opposition. As for
tomorrow, a source said: ''Whatever the position of the Left, there is a
consensus that this time the vote matters. We are voting for what could
be the next Labour Government.''

THE Fiery Cross went out from the Mod yesterday when a leading
campaigner called on Gaels to become political.
Mr Donald John MacSween, of organisers An Comunn Gaidhealach, wants to
form a group of political lobbyists dedicated to promoting Gaelic.
An Comunn's chief executive yesterday told the 92nd Royal National Mod
in Golspie that a change in Government could jeopardise 15 years of
progress of the language.
The development of the language relied on the continuation of funding
from whichever party was next in Government, he said.
''I would like every Gaelic speaker and all those people with the
language in their hearts to join us,'' he said.
Predicting full legal status for the Gaelic language by the year 2000,
Mr MacSween put out a rallying call to Gaels to lobby their prospective
MPs.
He said he believed a small group of professional lobbyists dedicated
to the promotion of a Gaelic manifesto would be formed within the year.
''I believe that the new group will become a very vocal part of the
Scottish political scene over the next few years,'' he said.
Mr MacSween said Gaelic had prospered under the Conservatives with the
formation of the #10m-per-year Gaelic Television Fund, together with
better funding for Gaelic education and culture.
But Mr MacSween stressed he was not in support of any particular
political party and was only interested in the development of the Gaelic
language through continued funding.
Meanwhile, the results of the Mod went out worldwide on the computer
Internet.
The outcome of the Mod was available to the world's computer users,
except those in Golspie, where it was held. Mod organisers could not
track down a single computer in the Sutherland town linked to the
Internet.

Brussels
THE Irish Sea off the Scottish coast is more radioactive than French
Polynesia where nuclear tests are being carried out, it was disclosed
yesterday.
Startled Euro-MPs were told by a senior European Commission expert,
recently returned from the Mururoa Atoll area, that emissions from
Sellafield in Cumbria and other UK nuclear plants, including
Chapelcross, near Annan, had helped to give the northern hemisphere a
radioactivity level twice that of the southern hemisphere.
But, said Mr Augustin Janssens, the main culprit in the northern
hemisphere was Chernobyl. And he emphasised that in both hemispheres the
exposure limits of the public to radiation were well below danger
levels.
Mr Janssens was the first witness in a major inquiry mounted in
Brussels by the European Parliament into the effects of French president
Jacques Chirac's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South
Pacific.
The hearing, the biggest of its kind in the history of the parliament,
is being led by Mr Ken Collins, Strathclyde East Labour Euro-MP, in his
role as chairman of the assembly's influential environment committee.
Euro-MPs, who voted last month to condemn the tests, are awaiting a
third report on Tuesday from Mr Jacques Santer, European Commission
president, on whether the French are breaking international law. Mr
Santer will travel to the parliament's plenary in Strasbourg to give the
commission's findings.
He will announce whether the French will be sued in the European Court
of Justice and a halt called to their test programme. A decision to
allow the French to proceed unimpeded could provoke an internal EU
crisis.
In the meantime, a briefing document circulated to Euro-MPs reported
that radioactive contamination of food in Polynesia did not seem to be
significantly higher than elsewhere in the southern hemisphere. But, the
report noted, it was ''very much lower than current levels in Europe,
post-Chernobyl.''

Bonn
GERMAN tennis star Steffi Graf today lost a sponsorship deal worth
more than #660,0000 a year because of doubts about the management of her
finances, the first time a much-publicised tax scandal has hit her
pocket.
Car company Adam Opel, which has backed Graf for 10 years in one of
the biggest deals in German sport, announced it would not be renewing
its contract with the Wimbledon champion at the end of the year.
''We are not questioning Steffi's integrity. It's problems with her
management,'' said Opel official Klaus Mauer. ''We believe her present
associates and management do not provide the correct basis for a new
contract.''
Graf, whose father Peter was detained in August to stop him fleeing or
concealing evidence that might support allegations that he and his
daughter dodged millions of marks in taxes, earned around DM1.5m (just
over #666,700) a year from the Opel deal.
After raids on her home, the arrest of her father, and two grillings
by public prosecutors in recent months, Opel's decision hit the
26-year-old multi-millionaire's image just as hard as her bank balance.
With the German media running stories about the tax investigation
virtually every day in recent months, Opel, a subsidiary of US-based
General Motors, started to ask questions about the way Graf's management
did their business.
The company was clearly not happy with the response.
''From the very beginning we stood by Steffi in every way. At the same
time we advised her to rearrange her management structure,'' Opel
Supervisory Board member and GM Europe Vice President Hans Wilhelm Gaeb
told a news conference.
''The decision was very hard . . . Steffi has concentrated completely
on her sporting achievements and, as a result, she simply does not have
the information she needs about her business.''
Graf, who was flying to Britain to play at an indoor tournament in
Brighton, was questioned on Friday by public prosecutors in Mannheim for
the second time.
Graf first signed a contract with Opel for DM25,000 (#11,700) a year
in 1985 when she was a teenager. It turned into one of the longest and
most lucrative sponsorship deals for an individual sports star in
Germany.
As Germany's highest profile sports personality, Graf was used by Opel
as a world ambassador for the company. She carried out publicity work
and the firm's name appeared on a logo on her tennis kit.
The tennis idol insists she entrusted most of her financial affairs to
her father and advisers from an early stage of her career and is unaware
of all the details of her huge wealth, estimated at #46m by the German
media.
Despite the tax scandal and a back problem, Graf has had a great year
in competition, winning her 18th grand slam title with the three majors
-- the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open -- since the tax
authorities began investigating her affairs.
After the triumph, however, Graf broke down in tears when asked about
problems of visiting her father in jail.
She was due to start play on Wednesday in Brighton, her first
competitive tennis since beating Monica Seles in the US Open final five
weeks ago.
Gaeb said Opel had informed the tennis player personally about the
decision to axe the contract but he stressed that Opel might be ready to
do business again with her in the future.
''I believe Steffi has so many complex problems weighing her down that
these have greater importance than the ending of a contract,'' he said.
''The door for Steffi at Opel remains open . . . We believe in Steffi's
innocence in what must be, for her, an incredibly complex situation.''
Chief prosecutor Peter Wechsung refused to give any details of
Friday's questioning of Graf, saying only that it had lasted ''several
hours''. He added, however, that there were no plans to arrest the
Wimbledon champion.--Reuter/AP.

A LORRY driver involved in a horrific crash that killed five young
British medics working in deprived areas of southern Africa appeared in
court today charged with culpable homicide.
The driver, in his late 40s, from Durban, was remanded in custody by
Siteki magistrates in Swaziland to reappear in court on October 27. He
could face up to five years in prison if convicted.
A Swaziland police spokesman said investigations into the accident
were continuing and the driver could face further charges later.
The four young women and a man, all in their 20s, were killed
instantly when their car was hit head-on by an articulated lorry six
miles inside Swaziland near the Lavumisa border on Friday evening.
Doctors Jacqueline Ford, 26, and Catherine Hulme, 24, and medical
students Lucy Tringham, 23, Deborah Townsend, 22, and 23-year-old David
Whitaker, were killed while on a weekend break from their work at a
hospital in a rural area of Natal.
Drs Ford and Hulme had been living and working at the Bethesda
Hospital, a 230-bed former mission hospital in the small mountain town
of Ubombo, near Mkhuzw, KwaZulu Natal.
British Deputy High Commissioner Julian Chandler said the case could
take a long time to go through the courts.
He added: ''The deaths of these five young people have really shocked
everyone here so they want to make sure they get it right.''
He has been in touch with the families of the victims. A post-mortem
examination will take place tomorrow before the bodies are flown back to
Britain for burial.
Bethesda Hospital superintendent Dr Jonathan Pons paid tribute to the
dead Britons, saying: ''They were young, idealistic, and selfless, and
catered for the poorest rural community.''
Dr Hulme's father John, a vet from South Molton, Devon, said his
daughter, who had been in South Africa for six months, had hoped to
devote her medical career to helping the Third World.
''She went out to South Africa to gain experience and to see the
country, like young people do.
''She was due to be there for five months, doing all sorts of work.
Her intention eventually was to work in Third World countries.''
The father of Dr Ford, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said: ''We
are in a state of shock. We don't want to comment except to say that our
daughter was doing what she wanted to do.''
Bristol University, where Lucy Tringham and Deborah Townsend were due
to complete their final year of study, said they were promising students
on the brink of medical careers.
David Whitaker, a student at University College Hospital, London, was
also due to qualify as a doctor next year. He had just arrived in Africa
to complete his six-week attachment and had not even unpacked his bags.

New Delhi
TWO Indian human rights groups accused police in Punjab today of
secretly cremating at least 3000 people after torturing and killing
them.
They presented at a news conference members of three Sikh families who
had asked the Supreme Court to help investigate the alleged torture and
deaths of relatives between 1992 and 1994.
The court last week ordered Punjab police chief K P S Gill to reply to
the charges within four weeks, they said.
''This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' a spokesman for the Committee
for Information and Initiative on Punjab (CIIP) said about its findings
from three cremation grounds in the administrative district of Amritsar.
The Supreme Court has criticised the Punjab police in the past for
illegal killings.
Chief Justice M N Venkatachalliah slammed Gill last year for
inadequately investigating the 1991 killings of seven members of a
family in the northern state where security forces have been given wide
powers to crush a separatist insurgency.
He asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India's federal
police, to reopen the probe into the deaths.--Reuter.

A WOMAN was jailed for two years yesterday when she was found guilty
of stabbing her boyfriend in the stomach.
Mrs Theresa Allison, 38, of Vernon Drive, Linwood, had denied
assaulting Mr Joe Kerr during a row at his home in High Street,
Johnstone, last December.
Mr William Totten, prosecuting told the High Court in Glasgow that Mrs
Allison, a divorced mother of three, was angry with Mr Kerr and for a
brief moment wanted to hurt him.
Her defence was that the stabbing was an accident and Mr Kerr had
heaped the blame on her in the hope he would collect in excess of #5000
from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.
Mr Kerr, also a divorcee, told Mr Totten that the stabbing was
deliberate. He denied the compensation allegations but admitted both he
and Mrs Allison had been ''seeing each other romantically'' since the
incident.
Mrs Allison said the incident happened as she prepared a meal for Mr
Kerr in the kitchen with a knife in her hand.
She told her defence counsel, Mr Graham Robertson, that as Mr Kerr
walked towards her swearing she told him: ''F... off, Joe'', making a
gesture with the hand holding the knife at the same time.
Mrs Allison said: ''That was it actually. It happened so fast I wasn't
even thinking about the knife in my hand and I wasn't even aware of it
going into his tummy.
''Joe walked into the living room, turned round, and said he had been
stabbed.
''I thought he was kidding on until he slid down between a chair and
the radiator and I saw him being sick.''
When asked why she told police she had stabbed him, she replied: ''I
felt it was my fault. I was to blame because I had the knife in my
hand.''
Mrs Allison said that following the incident Mr Kerr spoke of getting
at least #5000 in Criminal Injuries Compensation.
The court heard that as he was being prepared for an operation in
Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital Mr Kerr's heart stopped and had to be
restarted with a transfusion of nine litres of blood.
Sentencing Mrs Allison, Lord Sutherland said the assault could have
had fatal consequences but he would take a more lenient view than
normal.

Singapore
AN escaped British convict linked to several grisly murders abroad
testified today that he killed a South African tourist, but claimed it
was a friend connected with drug-runners who chopped up the body.
John Martin Scripps, describing himself as traumatised by two
homosexual assaults in the past, said he accidentally killed Gerard Lowe
after Mr Lowe tried to seduce him in a Singapore hotel room.
Mr Lowe was married and his widow testified earlier in the trial that
he was not a homosexual.
Taking the witness stand for the first time in his murder trial, Mr
Scripps, however, refused to name the English friend, saying he or his
drug ring would kill his family.
Mr Scripps said he was ''not a violent person'', and that viewing
court photographs of dismembered body parts made him feel ill.
''I know it is my life or my family. If that is the case, it has to be
mine,'' said Mr Scripps, 35, who faces a mandatory death sentence if
convicted.
He said he met Mr Lowe at a Singapore airport hotel reservations desk
on March 8 and they decided to share a room to cut costs.
''I've shared hotel rooms many times before and never had any problems
or anything stolen from me.''
He said he fell asleep soon after he and Mr Lowe checked into their
room.
''The next thing I knew, I was woken up by someone touching my
backside,'' he said. ''I saw Mr Lowe smiling, and I just freaked out . .
. I believed the man was going to assault me.''
He said he swung out at Lowe with a 3lb hammer he used for camping.
Asked by defence lawyer Edmund Pereira if he intended to kill Mr Lowe
with the hammer, Mr Scripps said: ''No. I didn't want to cause him any
serious harm.''
After Mr Lowe collapsed with blood running from his left temple, Mr
Scripps said he dragged him into the bathroom and tried to revive him.
''I believe I killed him,'' he said. ''I never caused anyone any
serious injury, let alone killed anyone. I couldn't believe it.''
After the fight, he said, he sought the help of the friend, staying in
another Singapore hotel. Mr Scripps said the friend may have dismembered
Lowe's body and dumped it in a river, but he was not sure as he had
stayed away from his room for several hours after the killing.
He claimed the friend had demanded a $12,000 payment and he got this
from a local bank using Mr Lowe's credit cards.
The defence attempt to show lack of intent to kill is a bid to win a
manslaughter conviction, which carries a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment. The prosecution contends it was premeditated murder with
intent to rob.
Mr Scripps testified that at the age of 18 he had landed in an Israeli
prison for drunkenness and stealing, and some inmates had tried to rape
him. Another such incident occurred last year in a British prison while
he was serving a 13-year-sentence for drug offences, he said.
Mr Scripps, who has been in and out of British jails since he was 15,
absconded from England during weekend prison leave a year ago.
The prosecution contends that he used butchery skills learned while in
prison in Britain to cut up Mr Lowe's body and dump the parts in
Singapore harbour.
''I may have worked in a butchery, but cutting up a human body is
another thing,'' Mr Scripps said in a choking voice.
The trial continues tomorrow when Scripps faces cross-examination by
the prosecution. A verdict is expected by the end of this week.
Thai authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Scripps in
connection with the murders of two Canadian tourists in March, the same
month as Mr Lowe's death.
He has also been linked to the murder of a British tourist in Cancun,
Mexico, and the disappearance of two other people in Belize and San
Francisco.--AP.

<TEXT>
A FOOTBALLER was fined #250 yesterday for kicking a ball into a stand,
which led to a 12-year-old girl being hospitalised.
Falkirk striker Steve Kirk had denied culpably and recklessly kicking
the ball with grossly excessive and unnecessary force and without regard
for the safety of spectators.
However, after viewing video footage and hearing evidence during the
one-day trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, Sheriff Charles Stoddart found
him guilty.
Kirk, 32, whose address was given as c/o Falkirk Football Club, was
playing for his club during a match with Heart of Midlothian at
Tynecastle on April 1.
The court heard that one of his teammates had been injured during the
game and after the ball was passed to Kirk he kicked it off the pitch
and into the stand.
Schoolgirl Dawn Wilson, who was at the match with her father, Bryan,
36, was struck by the ball.
The girl, now 13, told the court: ''It just came up and hit off my dad
and hit me on the side of the face.''
She said it had been sore and she was left crying. She was taken to
hospital with a painful neck but later allowed to go home.
However, the following day she was feeling sick and went back to
hospital.
The Midlothian schoolgirl's father said he felt Kirk had ''really
blasted'' the ball when he kicked it into the stand.
Mr Wilson said: ''He just booted it into the crowd. The ball came
towards me and I sort of swung towards the side. The next thing I knew I
heard my daughter scream because it caught her full in the face.''
Kirk said that, after his teammate was injured, he had attempted to
get the ball off the park to ensure treatment for his colleague.
He said: ''I tried to put the ball on to the top deck of the stand. I
mistimed it and it came off at a lower trajectory than I anticipated.''
Kirk denied he had lost his temper after the referee had not stopped
play.

THE Royal Mail has agreed to hold talks with the Union of
Communication Workers over a proposal to shed 500 jobs among postal
workers in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
It said the union was shown the plan two years ago but conceded the
proposal should be discussed again at a meeting in Edinburgh on
Thursday.
Its concession came at a scheduled meeting in the city yesterday when
UCW representatives refused to discuss proposals to staff three offices
in Edinburgh and insisted on seeing details of the manpower plan.
Officers of the UCW said last week they were prepared to seek a ballot
on industrial action by members if the Royal Mail did not withdraw the
proposed reduction of 500 jobs.
The Royal Mail said yesterday it was disappointed at the unnecessary
delay by the union.A spokeswoman also said the union's claims of job
losses were inaccurate.
In a letter circulated to members yesterday, the CWU said the Royal
Mail had told senior managers of plans to remove 500 full-time duties by
the end of 1995 and 700 temporary posts by next March, while recruiting
500 part-time staff. It said these plans were unacceptable.

BRITAIN's biggest union yesterday threatened industrial action against
NHS trusts refusing to offer a 3% pay rise, after announcing a huge vote
in favour of a deal to end the long-running NHS dispute.
Members of Unison voted by 82% in favour of the proposals thrashed out
during marathon talks last month to negotiate local pay with guarantees
of a national minimum increase.
Under the framework deal endorsed yesterday, unions will negotiate
local pay deals with NHS trusts following the recommendations of the
independent pay review body. At the end of each negotiating year, staff
who received less than the median ''going rate'' will receive top-up
increases to bring them up to nationally agreed minimum rates.
The union revealed that 406 health trusts had offered a rise of 3% or
above, which is expected to be paid to staff in early December following
the ballot result.
But Unison has also drawn up a hit-list of 66 ''tight-fisted'' trusts,
three of them in Scotland , which have either offered less than 3% or
have attached conditions to a deal such as improvements in sickness
absence.
The three Scottish trusts targeted are the Glasgow Victoria, which
Unison maintains has made the lowest offer of 1%, the Queen Margaret in
Dunfermline, and the Borders General Trusts, where 3% is linked to
negotiations on other issues.
Unison's Scottish regional officer, Mr Jim Devine, yesterday raised
the issues of pay and job cuts at the Glasgow Victoria with Scottish
Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton who was told of the effect
on staff morale.
Mr Bob Abberley, Unison's head of health, said a six-week deadline had
been set for the 66 trusts to improve their offers, otherwise ballots
for industrial action would begin.
''We will give these trusts to the end of November to come up with an
acceptable offer. If they do not, we will authorise industrial action
ballots. We have every confidence that our local negotiators will be
able to achieve 3% as a minimum for all staff.''
Mr Abberley said some trusts agreed to improve their offer after being
told at the end of last week that they were being included on the list.
Another 49 trusts had yet to make an offer but they have not been
included on the list because Unison is confident they will settle for at
least 3%.
The eventual pay rises will be backdated to April as the dispute has
dragged on throughout the summer.
After the Glasgow Victoria, the poorest offer on the union list is for
2% made by Surrey Community Trust and Tower Hamlets Healthcare Trust in
London.

HEALTH Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton yesterday defended the
Government's record on presenting a clear vision of the aims and
priorities of the National Health Service, writes JAMES ROBERTSON.
He was speaking at a debate in Edinburgh on the state of the NHS in
Scotland, hosted by the Kirk's church and nation committee and attended
by politicians and NHS administrators, as well as church
representatives.
The discussion was based on a church and nation committee document
which emphasised the need for a clear vision of the purposes of the NHS
to provide guidance on disputed priorities and spending decisions.
''At present, the question is whether the vision has been allowed to
become clouded over -- some would say almost lost sight of,'' the
committee's report stated.
Lord James argued, however, that the report understated the efforts
that the Government had put into clarifying the vision of the NHS.
He referred to various measures and developments it had introduced and
claimed the Government had provided more resources every year.

YOUNG Scots are being offered rewards of up to #500 to inform on drug
dealers as part of a nationwide anti-drugs campaign launched yesterday.
The National Crimestoppers campaign will target those aged 13 to 25,
who are believed to be most at risk from the drugs culture.
Operation Snap -- Say No, And Phone -- will pull together every police
force in Britain for the first time, as well as community groups and
local drugs action teams.
Mr Ian Bruce, chairman of Scottish Crimestoppers, said the year-long
programme aims to tackle the fashionable ''street-cred'' image of drugs.
''We want to combat drugs use in youth culture and the big point of
the campaign is the anonymous freephone line,'' said Mr Bruce.
''By offering anonymity, it gets around the problem of people being
uncomfortable talking to the police or on reporting on incidents in the
workplace.
''And we are offering rewards of up to #500 in any situation where
someone is charged, which can be collected, again anonymously, from
banks.''
Assistant Chief Constable Peter Gibson, of Strathclyde Police, said
forces would be acting on information received no matter how minor.
The freephone number is 0800 555 111.

SCOTRAIL'S plans to operate a modified Fort William sleeper service
throughout the winter were criticised yesterday as deliberately flouting
the court ruling that saved the sleeper from closure.
Campaigners have claimed that demand for the London-to-Fort William
overnight train had doubled, yet from next month some midweek services
will have only one sleeper carriage.
A ScotRail spokesman said: ''We are closely monitoring the situation
through our computerised reservations booking system.
''From the end of October onwards, we will run the service ad hoc and
where there is justification, depending upon our bookings in advance,
more than one carriage will be run midweek, similar to the weekend
service.''
This, he said, adhered to the passenger service requirement (PSR)
operating within the rail industry.
However, campaigner Mr Christopher Monckton, who lives by Loch
Rannoch, said: ''We carry out our own monitoring system by talking to
people running the railway, and demand for the sleeper has doubled.
''However, potential customers are still finding it impossible to make
a sleeper booking at a time when our sums indicate demand of between 80%
and 90% capacity midweek.''
He added that the booking office at Fort William was very good at its
job.
Mr Monckton further claimed that ScotRail's actions amounted to a
halving of the sleeper.
''This is occurring despite the court ruling that the existing service
must be maintained. ScotRail is deliberately flouting this ruling.''
British Rail recently abandoned moves to axe the sleeper service by
not exercising its right to appeal the recent Court of Session interdict
to the House of Lords. Instead franchising director Mr Roger Salmon
included a modified service in ScotRail's seven-year PSR for the
network.
This involved the three north-bound sleeper trains, which in the past
have served Inverness, Aberdeen, and Fort William, becoming one large
train, which is then broken up at Edinburgh.
For its part, Highland Regional Council agreed not to return to the
courts to claim a breach in the interdict.
Under the deal, the number of sleeper carriages would be cut and
linked to other services out of Edinburgh. Subsidies could therefore be
cut from #2.3m to #500,000 a year under this modified service.
This has occurred against a political backdrop, where would-be
investors in a privatised rail system received a warning that a Labour
Government could not guarantee subsidy levels and might alter rail
franchise terms.

FIVE hundred banking jobs are under serious threat as the Trustee
Savings Bank prepares to say goodbye to Scotland, the Scottish National
Party claimed in Glasgow yesterday.
Significantly, the SNP expressed willingness also for cross-party
alliances in a bid to halt, through Parliament, the merger.
The TSB's Edinburgh-based head office and home loans business in
Glasgow would bear the brunt of any job losses, said party leader Mr
Alex Salmond. He claimed the merger of the TSB with Lloyds Bank was a
watershed for the Scottish financial sector.
And Mr Salmond, a former Royal Bank of Scotland economist, asked ''If
these plans go through, what is to stop predatory action against the
country's two highly-successful independent banks?''
The party's business spokesperson, Mr Fergus Ewing, said: ''Guarantees
given a decade ago, at the time of TSB flotation, should be reaffirmed
-- and without delay.''
If not, then consumer, workforce and public confidence would disappear
''as the TSB becomes the bank that will say goodbye to Scotland''.
Undertakings were detailed in a letter from the then TSB Group
chairman, Sir John Read, to the then Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, the SNP
said.
''This involved a commitment that the TSB would continue to have a
head office in Scotland with a Scottish board of directors; the AGM
would be staged here; and the registered office would be based here,''
Mr Ewing added.
However in the light of current proposals, the crucial undertaking for
Scotland is that worded in the letter of May 16, 1985:
''The directors at each banking company will be under a responsibility
to take into account not only the interests of its shareholders, but
also the interests of customers and staff, the bank's responsibilities
under the Banking Act 1979 and the interests of the country or territory
in which the bank is established.''
The undertakings crucial to the SNP argument, it claimed, were
outlined in Hansard on July 4 of that year ''enshrined at parliamentary
level by a Government pledge not to activate the provisions of the TSB
Bill -- which was necessary in order to give effect to the planned
re-organisation -- until they were satisfied that the TSB had 'taken the
appropriate steps to implement the undertakings'.''
Legislative action was therefore required before the proposed merger
could go through.

GP fund-holding discriminates against patients whose doctors choose
not to belong to the system, according to a report released yesterday.
The Consumers' Association report, Mixing Money with Medicine, calls
on the Government to commission detailed research into fund-holding,
instead of insisting that its policy is right.
However, participating doctors took a different line yesterday, saying
the Labour party's plan to abolish the scheme would damage patient care.
Fund-holding GPs have warned that they would leave the NHS for private
health schemes if a Labour Government abolished the system.
Fund-holding, one of the cornerstones of reforms introduced four years
ago, gives GPs control over their finances and allows them to buy
treatment from hospitals.
Health authorities buy all non-fundholders' care and expensive
treatment.
Labour would prefer to see GPs form co-operatives, called
commissioning groups.
Yesterday's report, by Consumers' Association senior researcher Ms
Amanda Hoey, argued that fund-holding was expensive and had created an
uneven playing field.
Ms Hoey said: ''The fact remains that not all patients are covered (or
will be if the scheme remains truly voluntary) by a fund-holder and, if
there are benefits to be had, some cannot get them. This seems at odds
with the principles on which the NHS is based.''
The National Association of Fund-holding Practices (NAFP) responded by
saying the scheme's abolition would result in longer waiting lists and
an increase in patients using private medicine.
Dr David Tod, chairman of the NAFP conference committee, reinforced a
warning from NAFP chairman Dr Rhidian Morris that scrapping fund-holding
would create a genuine two-tier system with well-off patients paying for
first-class primary care from private schemes.
But a Consumers' Association survey of fund-holding and non
fund-holding GPs earlier this year found two-thirds of doctors agreed a
two-tier system was already operating.
More than half the GPs said that patients of fund-holders received
speedier referrals to hospital than patients of non-fundholders.
Fund-holders were more likely to offer extra services such as
consultant clinics and counselling sessions, alternative medicine,
self-help groups and extra practitioners.
Shadow health spokeswoman Mrs Margaret Beckett, who has long
campaigned against GP fund-holding, said there would be no loss of
advantages under Labour's scheme. ''The unfortunate thing is that people
are trying to create the impression that fund-holding is a good thing
and there is no alternative,'' Mrs Beckett said. ''That is not the case.
''I do not intend to take anybody on, but I hope and believe we can
convince people who truly want to preserve the advantages they think
they have found in fund-holding, that no one is trying to take
advantages away from them.
''What we are trying to do is make sure they are available to every
doctor.''
Meanwhile, Britain's biggest private health insurer, Bupa, is
launching a scheme this week which guarantees policy holders phone
consultations and home visits for a fee.

A WITNESS in the Rosemary West murder trial yesterday admitted
suffering from hallucinations in which she was being followed around by
Frederick West.
Described in court only as ''Miss A'', she said she was brutally and
sadistically assaulted at the age of 15 in front of two naked young
girls at 25 Cromwell Street.
Miss A described how six weeks later she went with a can of petrol to
25 Cromwell Street intending to set fire to the building, but lost her
nerve.
She insisted she witnessed a similar sexual assault on one of the
young girls, whose age then she put at 13 or 14, before her own alleged
assault by both Frederick and Rosemary West.
The 13-year-old girl, a blonde, was clearly in pain and wept as she
was subjected to depraved sexual indignities, Miss A told the court.
When the Wests had finished with her, the witness said she was led to
the bed by Mrs West who bound her wrists and ankles in brown packing
tape.
Miss A told Winchester Crown Court she thought: ''God, I am next.''
She described how during the sexual attacks, Mrs West was a Jekyll and
Hyde figure. During the assault on the blonde girl, she spoke in an
aggressive voice. ''Next, it was as if she was being all motherly
again.''
Mrs West pleads not guilty to the murder of 10 young girls and women,
including that of her own daughter, Heather.
In cross-examination, Miss A admitted having a psychiatric background.
Over a number of years she had been treated for depression and had
received electro-convulsive therapy.
She denied the events she had described in court were a figment of her
imagination and that she had ever been diagnosed as schizophrenic.
Miss A did admit to having heard voices and having been followed
around by a man in black. She now knew that this was not real, but only
in her mind.
That man was Frederick West, found dead in a prison cell on New Year's
Day while on remand on 12 murder charges.
Miss A also admitted running away with Mrs West's younger brother, Mr
Graham Letts, when she was only 14 and having a full sexual relationship
with him one year before the alleged assault.
However, it was only last year she learned that Mr Letts and Mrs West
were brother and sister. As she began her evidence, Miss A, 33, wrote
her name on a piece of paper which was passed to the judge and jury. She
said she was taken into care at the age of 13 when her parents divorced.
She said a friend gave her an address as somewhere she could go if she
needed to. It was 25 Cromwell Street. She went there on eight or nine
occasions, the first just after her fourteenth birthday.
Asked how Mrs West appeared, Miss A replied: ''Very nice. She was like
a big sister-cum-young mum. She told me I could go there any time I
needed a shoulder to cry on. It felt as if someone really cared.''
She went to the address on Friday mornings between 11am and 1.15pm on
her way home to Tewkesbury for a weekend visit with her mother.
On the last occasion she went to 25 Cromwell Street, Mrs West answered
the door wearing a see-through blouse.
Miss A described being led into a front bedroom by Mrs West. There
were three other people in the room. Two of them were the two young
girls, both of whom were naked. Frederick West was dressed only in
shorts.
She said Mrs West started undressing her and saying things such as
''It is OK'', and ''We are all girls''. Mrs West undressed.
Miss A then described how the blonde girl's hands, wrists, and ankles
were taped. ''I could see from her face that she was hurting,'' said
Miss A. ''She was frightened.''
Mrs West committed sexual acts on the girl before Frederick West had
intercourse with her. Throughout Mrs West was asking: ''Are you enjoying
it, Fred? Is it turning you on?''
The witness said she was then led to the bed. ''God, I am next,'' she
said she thought. She wanted to scream, kick and cry but she did none of
that. She just felt numb.
All the time, Mrs West was telling her to relax and everything would
be OK. She said she was taped at the wrists and ankles, and then
described various sexual indignities she suffered, and of Mrs West
asking her husband if he was enjoying it.
She later hitched to Tewkesbury. She was crying, angry and upset. ''I
felt so ashamed. I just felt sick and felt stupid,'' she said. ''I felt
hate for Rosemary. I felt I trusted somebody and she had used me.''
She did not go to the police because she was in care and children in
care were regarded as being bad.
She described the visit to 25 Cromwell Street six weeks later when she
took with her a can of petrol and matches.
''I wanted revenge,'' the witness told the jury. ''I intended pouring
it through the letter box of their house and setting it on fire. But I
didn't. I stood there, just stood there. I wanted to do it so much.''
The witness said that she had never told anyone of her experiences
until the police came to her last year. Even then, she initially denied
she had ever been to Cromwell Street. It was only in August she finally
described what had happened to another officer.
Cross-examined by Mr Richard Ferguson QC, defending, Miss A agreed she
had signed a contract with a newspaper for #30,000 to be paid after the
trial for a story about how her life had been affected by the
experiences at Cromwell Street.
Mr Ferguson also said the witness had an unfortunate medical
background. She admitted she had been sexually abused by her father and
brother before being taken into care. On various occasions, she had
attended doctors saying she was pregnant, but tests proved negative.
Mr Ferguson insisted that she had fantasised over the events she
alleged had taken place at 25 Cromwell Street. ''It is a complete
figment of your imagination,'' he declared.
Miss A, who had wept throughout much of her evidence, declared: ''No
it isn't. I know what happened and so do they.'' The trial continues.

A WOMAN whose five-year-old son was shot in the head with an airgun
pellet hugged him yesterday and said: ''Thank God my boy's alive.''
Sandy Govan was shot on Sunday evening as he played with his
three-year-old brother outside his home in Letham Terrace, Letham, near
Falkirk.
He was rushed to Falkirk Royal Infirmary and underwent an hour-long
operation to remove the pellet.
Yesterday as Sandy, a pupil at Letham Primary School, recovered at his
home, his mother Tracy, 27, was thankful he had not been killed.
''We understand he was hit by a neighbour who had been shooting birds
from his living room window,'' Mrs Govan said.
''That is totally unacceptable. Our son could have lost an eye, or
even been killed.''
Police last night confirmed that a man had been questioned about an
incident involving an air rifle and that a report would be sent to the
procurator-fiscal.
Mrs Govan was alerted to the shooting by her sister-in-law, Helen
Bennie, who arrived at the door carrying Sandy in her arms.
''There was blood on his head and he was a very funny colour,'' Mrs
Govan said.
''Helen blurted out: 'Sandy's been shot'. I was horrified. I thought
he was dying.''

Blatch disclosed last night.
She said in a Lords written reply that the average working peer cost
the taxpayer #6700 that year.
MPs' and Ministers' salaries had totalled #22.93m -- an average of
#35,229 per MP. However, the total cost of their expenses and allowances
had been #43.6m or #66,972 per head.
Peers, who do not receive a parliamentary salary, claimed #6.27m in
expenses that year, averaging of #6700 for each of the 936 peers who had
attended the Lords during the session.

<TEXT>
DEFENCE Secretary Michael Portillo last night announced details of
Britain's new rapid reaction force which he said would be established
next August.
Mr Portillo, who outlined plans to last week's Tory conference, told
the Commons: ''It will greatly improve our ability to respond quickly
and effectively to a wide range of contingencies.
''Our goal is to create a force with the power to influence events.''
The force, expected to number about 5000, plus support, will combine
elements of all three armed services.
Mr Portillo, opening a two-day Defence Estimates debate, said an
implementation team would be set up under a Royal Marines brigadier to
establish the new force by August 1 next year.
The Defence Secretary earlier announced orders for American Tomahawk
land attack missiles.
He said Tomahwk's long range and high accuracy would ''give us a
highly effective means fo persuading a potential aggressor to desist
from unacceptable activity''.
Mr Portillo announced that, because of the current commitments of the
Army, the MoD would not this year meet its target of giving infantrymen
an average of 24 months between tours.
On the basis of current commitments, he said, the average interval for
1995-96 would be 20 months.
For Labour, Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark accused the
Government of being ''all words and no action'' in defence procurement.
Pressed by SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing on France's nuclear
testing in the South Pacific, Mr Portillo said it was important, if the
world was to benefit from the nuclear umbrella that it should know the
nuclear weapons were effective.''We in Britain do not feel a need to
test our weapons to have certainty about that. We make no judgment about
whether the French are in the same position or not.''

<HEADLINE>New call for Brent Spar disposal at sea</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975847696</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government last night renewed its call for the Brent Spar, the
disused Shell oil platform, to be disposed of at sea rather than on
land.
Trade and Industry Minister of State Lord Fraser of Carmyllie told
peers at question time: ''The Research Council's advice to us has been
that even if Shell miscalculated the extent of the contaminants by 10
times, the effect on the sea would have been negligible.
''What is clearly important, because of what happened over Brent Spar,
is that the option of deep sea disposal should not be rejected. All the
sound reasoning that led us to the conclusion that it was the right one
remain there.''
The Brent Spar, which Shell agreed to dismantle on land after pressure
from environmentalists Greenpeace, is currently moored in Norway's
Erfjord while Shell considers its future. It has Norway's permission to
remain there until next July. Greenpeace has since admitted that it had
overestimated the risk of pollution.
Lord Fraser, arguing strongly against a land-based disposal, warned:
''There would be risks to the workforce dismantling the structure.'' If
the mildly radioactive scale deposits on the inside of the tanks were to
dry up and become dust in the atmosphere, he added, ''the risk would be
not only to the workforce but to other people as well''.
Tory former Scottish Secretary Lord Campbell of Croy called for an
early decision on a deep Atlantic disposal before the structure started
cracking up.
Lord Fraser said that among the options submitted to Shell were
converting it into a floating casino or a North Sea reef to provide
cover for fish. ''Clearly something will have to be done,'' he added.

DEFENCE Secretary Michael Portillo last night stood by his
controversial Euro-sceptic comments at last week's Tory Party
conference.
His language was less colourful than when he delivered his speech last
Tuesday to a rapturous response from representatives in Blackpool -- and
an angry response from his critics.
However, the message, that Britain would never join a European army,
was the same.
Opening the annual debate on defence spending in the Commons, he
insisted: ''Decisions on the deployment of British armed forces must be
taken by the sovereign British Government.
''No decisions should be taken which would limit our freedom to act in
defence of British national interests.
''And there is no justification for separate 'European armies', which
would be wasteful and would undermine Nato.''
Meanwhile, German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe yesterday attacked the
Blackpool comments by Mr Portillo as jingoism that made him want to
fight more for European unity.
Without mentioning Mr Portillo by name, Mr Ruehe said the Defence
Secretary's vigorously anti-European Union speech was ''shrill and
nationalistic''.
''This was a failure to understand that European policy is first and
foremost a peace policy,'' Mr Ruehe told the annual congress of the
Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
''So we have to start again and step up the struggle for the core of
our European policy.''
In the Commons, last night Mr Portillo was careful to state that he
was citing the view of the Government, which he said was set out in its
statement on the defence estimates, which were the subject of last
night's debate.
He said the Government had clear aims for next year's EU
Inter-Governmental Conference: ''Our yardstick will always be what is in
the interests of Britain's and Europe's security.
''As the Government says in the statement on defence estimates, we
cannot accept from the IGC a merger of the Western European Union into
the EU.''
Earlier in the Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine had
defended the Defence Secretary.
Liberal Democrat Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) had suggested someone
should ''explain to Mr Portillo that this country has had treaty
obligations to go to war on behalf of other European countries and has
been part of an integrated command structure with other European
countries since before Mr Portillo was in his pram.''
Mr Heseltine retorted: ''Mr Portillo has never questioned the
obligations of this country under treaties.
''He was merely talking about the concept of a federalist defence
policy in Europe, which this Government rejects.''
During the debate, Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark launched a
fierce attack on Mr Portillo's conference speech, claiming it had caused
offence and outrage to many people.
He described the speech as ''one of the most disgracefully
nationalistic rants I have ever had the displeasure to hear''.
The armed forces were seething about the speech as well. ''To try to
hijack the courage and commitment of the SAS for your self-seeking
Rambo-style propaganda shows the depths to which you will sink,'' he
told the Defence Secretary.
Mr Menzies Campbell, for Liberal Democrats, said Mr Portillo's
conference speech had offended the armed services and been
''particularly inept''.
Mr Campbell protested: ''It was not worthy of his office.
''A speech which contained language of the effect 'don't mess with
Britain' is a speech which contains the language of the saloon bar.''

The tears flowed and the beers poured as the Skye bridge opened
yesterday. Stephen McGinty reports.
HOGMANAY was brought forward three months and squeezed into six
minutes yesterday afternoon as the Loch Dunvegan sailed for the last
time between Skye and the Scottish mainland.
It was an emotional farewell as CalMac wound up the ferry service
which for three years shy of a century had operated from Kyle of
Lochalsh.
The plan was to have both the Loch Dunvegan and Loch Fyne ferries
leave their respective sides at 3pm but so many locals had arrived to
bid the service farewell that the Loch Dunvegan was forced to make other
return journeys.
However, its official farewell voyage from Skye to the mainland was
heralded by the Isle of Skye Pipe Band and a party atmosphere usually
reserved for New Year's Eve in Princes Street.
Hundreds crammed on to the ferry to sing and dance, many carrying a
carry-out of bottled beers more as an accompaniment to a Scottish wake
than a launch celebration. Fond memories were toasted as Flower of
Scotland followed Scotland The Brave while the band marched and grinned.
Mrs Diana Graham, of Kyleakin, described herself as ''well over 60''
and ''so sad'' that the ferry which had transported her all her life was
finished. As a tear rolled down her cheek, she said: ''It really is the
end of an era.''
But it was an era sounded out by the rising tunes of the pipe band
whose leader, Mr John McLeod, had stirred his troops from their earlier
performance at the Ministerial opening by Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth of the Skye bridge.
During the morning at the bridge's tollgate, the number of invited
guests outweighed the spectating public. There the pipe band played more
depressive tunes in secret protest. In fact in front of the Ministerial
podium, kindly lent by Radio Tay, one older drummer resembled Angus
Lennie in The Great Escape -- after he had been shot.
But it was a day for metaphors, the opening of a bridge between Scots.
Even the green shoots of economic recovery were present in the form of a
blanket of grass seeds and fertiliser sprayed to brighten the muddy
grass verges at either side of the bridge.
The Saltire and Lion Rampant flying at the tollbooth looked as if they
had been starched then ironed. Looking regal in his green tweed suit, Mr
Forsyth attempted to lend the opening a magisterial air, but was sunk by
the signing of autographs.
His less-than-loyal subjects, protesters against the bridge's high
toll, were distinct by their absence. A lone figure lofted a placard
proclaiming ''Forsyth -- the Scottish quisling''. He was not local. He
was a house-husband from Fife, Mr Ian McKimmie. Later a lone, battered,
brown estate with ''no toll'' painted in smudged white on the back
windscreen was spotted driving away from the bridge.
Skye Bridge Limited decreed Tuesday toll-free -- a shrewd move
described by Mr Alistair McLean, a student of Gaelic TV at Sabhal Mor
Ostaig on Skye, as ''Machiavellian''.
So instead of angry protesters, Mr Forsyth had only eager children to
deal with. While his primary school colleagues played excitedly with the
toggles on their anoraks, 10-year-old Steven Campbell, of Loch Duich
Primary School, helped open the bridge. Nervous at first, his eyes
brightened like an NHS trust accountant when Mr Forsyth handed him the
scissors for the big cut. One snip and it was over.
Yet the pre-teen fun and games continued for the Secretary of State.
With the bridge officially opened, Mr Forsyth led a convoy of guests in
old MacBrayne's Highland buses and vintage Vauxhall cars up and over the
bridge, then back again.
Halfway across on the return leg, he met 12-year-old Heather Guthrie
from Helensburgh. Tired of posing in a bright red sports car for a
photocall, he played and posed with Heather's dog, Peaches, which leaped
up on him.
''At least somebody likes me,'' said Mr Forsyth before referring to
the W C Fields line about never working with animals and children.
Yet, despite the pomp and ceremony, it was not the birth of the bridge
to which the locals drank. Certainly, many flooded across at 2pm, making
use of a rare toll-free day. They now have little choice and almost all
prefer the bridge if not its tolls. Yet it was for the ferry that the
most emotion and beer was spilt.
As Mr John McLeod and his band of pipers and drummers spilt from the
ferry, we could have been in Hamlin, happy children cheering and
marching off forever.
Then we would not have noticed the band climbing back into their bus,
driving off into worsening weather across the Skye bridge and home.

A HUGE new effort to end the stalemate of the Ulster peace process was
launched yesterday with the arrival in London of Mr Anthony Lake,
National Security Adviser to President Clinton.
Last night, Mr Lake was having talks at the US Ambassador's residence
with the new Ulster Unionist leader, Mr David Trimble. Today, he is
scheduled for meetings with Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew.
Maximum pressure is being brought to bear on Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams to change his mind on the establishment of an independent
commission, chaired by an American to conduct talks with all the parties
involved about the decommissioning of IRA weapons.
President Clinton arrives in Britain next month prior to visits to
Belfast and Dublin, and the White House is keen for the President to
have an announcement to make about a new initiative for Northern
Ireland.
Last night, Downing Street still was cautious, insisting that there
can be no all-party talks unless and until Sinn Fein addresses the
question of the decommissioning of weapons.
Over the last two years, the British Government has been embarrassed
by the treatment accorded to Mr Adams in the United States by the White
House.
However, over the last few weeks, the White House has been taking a
different view of Mr Adams, and both London and Dublin believe that the
Sinn Fein leader will find it hard to resist pressure from the three
capitals.

SET on upstaging Mr Heseltine's despatch box debut as Deputy Prime
Minister yesterday, Labour had, working secretly and in haste over the
past month or so, developed a completely new weapon -- Mr Alan Howarth.
Sympathetic listeners and murmurers of what Mr John Prescott once
called warm words, had convinced the troubled MP of Stratford-upon-Avon
that the caring, compassionate One Nation principles on which he had
built his political career now reposed in the New Labour Party.
As the world knows, Mr Howarth has thrown in his lot with it and has
fitted happily into a party in which statements of high principle and
sharp political tactics do not merely co-exist but complement each
other.
Thus, his conversion was announced at the moment of maximum
embarrassment for his former party and his first sentence to the Commons
Chamber since seeing light on the road to Islington was engineered in
the same way.
As Mr Heseltine -- freed from the resounding responsibilities of
President of the Board of Trade and Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry but with the even higher titles of Deputy Prime Minister and
First Secretary of State to live up to -- rose to answer his first
question in this capacity or these capacities, the Chamber doors burst
open and in burst Mr Howarth flanked or guarded by two or three of his
new comrades.
Someone had clearly been peeking, as the eruption did not occur at the
start of questions to the DPM's department but at the very moment when
Mr Heseltine was about to open his mouth to answer a question.
The question was judged of sufficient moment to require the DPM's
personal attention, rather than that of Mr Roger Freeman who, even if
his job of being the Deputy's deputy seems to require a natural talent
for self-effacement, has been given a fine title of his own to
compensate. Mr Freeman is Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and can,
among other things, appoint magistrates for that splendid area.
He had just confessed that he was having trouble finding young
magistrates, rather as his party is having trouble finding youthful
members. However, as he sat down, all eyes turned to the DPM until, that
is, the doors burst open.
Both sides took Mr Howarth's arrival with restraint. Boos and hisses
were nobly stifled on the Tory benches as they saw the man representing
a constituency which almost symbolises England, taking Shakespeare, who
never showed much sympathy for plebs, to the plebeian side of the House.
The Labour benches showed restraint too. A few One Nation Labourites
raised a little cheer. Mr Dennis Skinner and Mr Jeremy Corbyn forbore to
seize Mr Howarth warmly by the throat. They may feel the party has been
too heavily infiltrated by Social Democrats already to bother. If you
have a Tory as a leader, what difference can another as a back bencher
make.
Mr Heseltine was able to point comfortingly to his junior Minister Mr
John Horam, who has made the politcial journey in the opposite direction
with a pause at the half-way house of the SDP. He, Mr Heseltine pointed
out, has been rewarded by serving his country as a Minister.
Given Labour's shortage of ministerial experience Mr Blair, may if the
electors are kind, be able to offer Mr Howarth, who has been a Minister,
the opportunity of matching the Horam achievement.
Mr Blair requires to have a deputy leader, although Mr Prescott may
not, one feels, make Deputy Premier. He pointed out that Mr Heseltine's
record on deregulation and competition of which he is in charge, is not
wonderful. This was more effective than his bid to brand Mr Heseltine
''the hop-a-long deputy'', a reference to his mobile conference speech.
The DPM did not bother to defend his policies and, in a reference to
Mr Howarth, said grandly that he hadn't much personal experience of
changing either his principles or his policies.
Showing there was no sacrifice he will not make in the name of party
unity, he then defended Mr Portillo's conference speech. The banner of
indignant Europeans was carried on this occasion by the habitually
sensible Liberal Democrat Mr Alan Beith who complained that Britain had
accepted treaty obligations to go to war on behalf of other European
countries while the infant Portillo was still in his pram.
Mr Heseltine pointed out that these were ''British'' treaty
obligations. Mr Portillo had suggested that our lads would not be happy
to fight for ''Brussels''. He was, said the DPM dismissively ''merely
talking about the concept of a federalist defence policy in Europe which
this Government rejects''.
This answer indicated that the irate Tory Europeans are not going to
get much joy, publicly anyway, when they complain to Messrs Major and
Rifkind about the Defence Secretary's outrageous claim that our troops
might feel happier fighting for their country than for an unelected
Commission.
Mr Heseltine, splendidly ignoring Mr David Winnick's attempt to saddle
him with being ''the Archie Rice of British politics,'' went on to make
an even bigger gesture for party unity.
After Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North) had had his say, Mr Heseltine
told him: ''As always, I found myself in complete accord with my
Honourable Friend.''
Not only did he really say ''as always,'' but, showing that command of
self that can carry a man to the dizzy heights of DPM and FSS, he did
not even blush.

THE House of Commons paused in its first day back from the summer
recess yesterday to hear tributes to former Prime Minister Lord Home of
the Hirsel, who died last week. Mr John Major described him as a man of
integrity, who cared deeply about Scotland and the Union.
The Prime Minister, who led the traditional appreciations from all
sides of the House, said Lord Home was a One Nation politician who had
forsaken the life of a Scottish laird to devote himself to public
service.
''Alec Home believed people with privileges had to accept obligations.
He felt an obligation and a duty to public service. And when fate called
on him to serve in the highest office, he disclaimed his historic
titles, a step no-one in his position could possibly take lightly,'' he
said.
Lord Home's modestly and charm earned him the affection of those he
met.
As Neville Chamberlain's Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1938, he
accompanied him to Munich. ''He was not personally responsible for the
agreement reached. But with characteristic loyalty, Alec Home would
never subsequently criticise Chamberlain's actions.''
Labour leader Tony Blair said two words characterised Lord Home:
affection and decency. Even when disparaged by his critics, his
transparent decency helped him rise above it.
On Munich, Mr Blair said history had judged very harshly those
involved. It was to Lord Home's credit that he had never run away from
his part in appeasement nor ceased to support Neville Chamberlain.
He noted that Lord Home had been prepared to offer devolved powers to
Scotland, ''which is of more than passing interest''.
''He was a person who did not need to work at all and yet all his life
worked hard in the service of others. He was above all a man of honour
who stayed a man of honour,'' he added.
For the Liberal Democrats, Sir David Steel, a friend and Borders
neighbour, said Lord Home's experience as Scottish Minister led him to
understand the shortcomings of Scottish legislation at Westminster, and
worked to promote a devolved Scottish assembly.
''Whatever its defects in detail, it could have been a step in the
right direction.''
Sir Edward Heath, who knew Lord Home and served with him in the
Foreign Office, said Lord Home had never been tarnished with the label
of appeasement.
''Above all, he loved his Scotland and it's true he wanted to see
constitutional development in Scotland,'' Sir Edward said.
He had nominated Lord Home to a committee preparing devolution and had
the Tories won the 1974 election his Government would have gone ahead
with the plan and seen off ''the dangers of a narrow nationalism in
Scotland''.
Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield, who by obtaining a Parliamentary
Act allowing the disclaiming of peerages had created the precedent that
allowed Lord Home to surrender his title and return to the Commons,
said: ''Only in this country could such a combination of ballot box and
blue blood be used to such an advantage.''

A MAN yesterday admitted sexually assaulting an 88-year-old blind
woman after pretending to be her doctor.
Itinerant gardener Richard MacNeill, 66, of Beauly, also admitted
sexually assaulting an 85-year-old woman.
Advocate-depute Colin Boyd, QC, said that on May 4 this year the
88-year-old became aware of someone in the hallway of her home who then
entered her sitting room and told her: ''I am your doctor.''
She had frequent visitors and at that stage was not suspicious because
there had been a number of different doctors at her local practice.
He said he wanted to examine her and she took off her cardigan and was
unbuttoning the cuff of her blouse when he said he need to examine her
lower down. She suggested they move to the dining room where there was
more privacy and a couch on which she could lie.
She lay on the couch and he helped her remove clothing and then
sexually assaulted her. She then felt his weight on top of her and was
aware of him climbing on to the couch.
''At this stage she was very frightened,'' said Mr Boyd. ''She managed
to find the strength to heave him off and the accused left without
saying or doing anything else.''
The woman managed to telephone her doctor who alerted the police and
MacNeill, who had been sighted in the area, was detained.
Four weeks later, an 85-year-old woman in Inverness answered a knock
at her door to find MacNeill who said he wanted to do her garden. She
said she did not want him to but he grabbed hold of her, kissed her, and
assaulted her before she was able to push him away and close the door.
Appearing for MacNeill, Ms Mhairi Richards said her client had worked
in the construction industry until the mid-1980s when work had dried up
and since then had worked on an itinerant basis in Dingwall, Beauly,
Muir of Ord, Inverness, and Tain.
He had been a heavy drinker since serving in the Army and this
affected every aspect of his life. His wife had asked him to leave eight
years ago.
She said he suffered from a number of serious illnesses, including
cardio-respiratory disease which might well mean his undergoing surgery
within a few weeks. Ms Richards said the Crown had obtained reports
which had indicated there was nothing psychiatrically wrong with
MacNeill but suggested it might be appropriate for full medical reports
to be obtained.
Lord Johnston, who described the offences as ''abominable'', said he
would defer sentence to the High Court in edinburgh on November 3 to
allow social inquiry reports to be prepared and the defence to obtain
medical reports.

THE Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland,
the Rev Murdo Alex Macleod, minister of Stornoway Free Church since
1984, has died. He was 60.
The Free Church, announcing his death yesterday, said the church had
been plunged into mourning. The Rev Neil MacDonald, Moderator-Designate
of the next Free Church General Assembly, said Mr Macleod's death was a
loss to the whole church.
The Moderator was in Aberdeen at the time of his death, en route to
the General Synod of the Christian Reformed Church in the Netherlands.
Mr Macleod was a powerful and persuasive preacher, whose gifts were
appreciated outside as well as within the Free Church. He was recognised
as a man of strong evangelical convictions.
He was ordained to the ministry and inducted to Drumchapel Free Church
in 1966, and spent six years there. He served at Dingwall from 1972-78
and Inverness Greyfriars from 1978-84 before accepting a call to
Stornoway.
He was born at Ness in Lewis, where his father, the late Rev Alexander
Macleod, was the Free Church minister.
He spent his formative years in Glasgow and at Back, Lewis. He
received his secondary education at the Nicolson Institute and then was
employed in Glasgow. He began training for the ministry in 1960 and
graduated with an MA in 1963 from Aberdeen University, after which he
entered the Free Church College in Edinburgh.
During his ministry, Mr Macleod served as a member of committees of
the Free Church's General Assembly. He was convener of the public
questions, religion, and morals committee, the training of the ministry
committee, and the quinquennial and curriculum development committee.
He was an honorary vice-president of the Lord's Day Observance
Society.
Outside the church, he served as a member of the Western Isles health
board, the Bethesda home and hospice management committee, the Highland
region education committee, and the Western Isles Council education
committee.
The General Assembly of the Free Church over which Mr Macleod presided
last May was an eventful one. He was in charge of the private debate on
unspecified allegations against Professor Donald Macleod and, after nine
hours' of deliberation over two days, faced waiting journalists to
announce the decision clearing the theologian.
Mr Macleod is survived by his wife, Annibel, and their five sons and
one daughter.

<HEADLINE>Duke presses case for maritime museum. Lottery cash rethink after funding rows</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975847713</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO rows broke out over National Lottery funding yesterday, forcing
the Arts Council to re-examine how the cash is awarded.
There was anger at most of the latest awards, more than #42m of #50m
being split between two London theatres. Even the council's chairman,
Lord Gowrie, was forced to admit: ''I would be aggrieved or cross in the
North about this.''
Meanwhile, a leaked letter showed that the Duke of Edinburgh had
intervened with the Prime Minister on behalf the National Maritime
Museum in Greenwich, south-east London, which had been turned down for
lottery funds.
The Duke was accused of having ''abused royal power'' by Mr Brian
Sedgemore, the Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, and a member
of the Commons Treasury Select Committee.
The Sadler's Wells theatre was granted #30m towards a #38m rebuilding
scheme to create an international dance ''mecca for everybody'' and
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre on the South Bank is to receive #12.4m to
complete construction.
These awards come just three months after #55m was given to the Royal
Opera House at Covent Garden.
Lord Gowrie pledged that more lottery money would be spread around the
rest of the country in the coming months at the expense of the capital.
He said large provincial applications were coming through now and were
likely to be successful, leaving London's share reduced to around 30%.
Mr Peter Gummer, chairman of the Arts Council's lottery committee,
said a squad of around 28 ''troubleshooters'' was being recruited to
oversee lottery money and make sure it was being used properly.
Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley is being urged by MPs to make
sure lottery money is more evenly distributed.
Mr Terry Dicks, Tory MP for Hayes and Harlington, said: ''Working
class people are subsidising toffs' entertainment. This money is going
to arty-farty types and it goes on corporate entertainment.
''Someone should ask Virginia Bottomley to reconsider where this money
is going, and if she does not, then she should not be in that job.''
Mr Sedgemore said: ''It's outrageously insensitive. A bunch of
establishment middle-class people are effectively giving money to their
friends. It's an enormous stitch-up.''
Mr Chris Smith, Shadow Heritage Secretary, said he would be urging
wider distribution of money in a Commons debate.
Mrs Bottomley replied: ''As far as London is concerned, there are
flagship institutions which affect tourism and affect our national
pride. There is a misunderstanding that it goes to ballet dancers and
bassoon players.
''It goes to brickies and electricians, because the construction
industry benefits from the money.''
Mr Ian Albery, Sadler's Wells chief executive, said: ''We are not
elitist. We are of the people, for the people.''
In the Commons, the Labour MP John Maxton (Glasgow Cathcart) protested
that leading arts organisations in Scotland, such as Scottish Opera and
Glasgow Citizens' Theatre, were facing huge financial crises and he
called for the rules to be changed so that they could benefit.
However, Mrs Bottomley strongly defended the way the lottery was run
and denied that the proceeds were favouring well-off parts of the
country at the expense of the poor.
Mrs Bottomley told Mr Maxton he must be aware that already in Scotland
the Scottish Arts Council had made 66 grants, totalling almost #6m.
There were 48 other grants awarded yesterday from the remaining #8.5m.
London, however, has dominated the lottery handouts since they began
in March, netting more than #124m against #5.7m for the North-west of
England and #5.14m for Yorkshire and Humberside.
The Duke of Edinburgh's appeal on behalf of the National Maritime
Museum occurred while Mr John Major was spending a private weekend at
Balmoral.
It emerged in a leaked letter, apparently written by the Prime
Minister's private secretary, Mr Alex Allan, to Mr Hayden Phillips,
permanent secretary at the Department of National Heritage.
A Downing Street spokesman said: ''You have no evidence whatsoever of
No 10 leaning on the National Heritage Department.
''It is not in the gift of the Prime Minister or any other Ministers
to make awards.''
Earlier, Mrs Bottomley told Radio Four's Today programme that she was
''fairly confident there will be a positive outcome'' to the museum's
request for lottery funds.
However, Mr Sedgemore said: ''I am appalled at the idea of the husband
of the Queen going to John Major, who is supposed to have no control
over the way National Lottery monies are expended.
''One suspects this is going on all the time, that people are lobbying
John Major and Mrs Bottomley -- and that's what I call political
corruption. It's an abuse of the Duke's power. It's an abuse of royal
power.''
Mr Allan's letter to Mr Phillips at the National Heritage Department,
dated September 11, said: ''During the Prime Minister's visit to
Balmoral over the weekend, the Duke of Edinburgh spoke to me about the
Neptune Hall project at the National Maritime Museum.''
Mr Allan enclosed a memorandum, detailing the museum's complaints,
which he said he received from Sir Robert Fellowes, the Queen's private
secretary, and which he said the Duke had seen.
A spokeswoman for the Duke of Edinburgh said: ''We are not commenting
on a leaked document. We wouldn't go into detail on what amounts to
private discussions.
''But we would point out that, as a trustee of the National Maritime
Museum, the Duke obviously takes a close and continuing interest in its
proceedings, including its lottery allocation.''

IT is not exactly what Thomas Hardy had in mind when he invented the
town of Christminster as the backdrop to his classic novel, Jude The
Obscure, but Edinburgh will suffice for film-maker Michael Winterbottom.
''Hardy based his fictional town on Oxford, but when we looked around
at lots of cities in Britain we decided that Edinburgh was the most
interesting,'' he declared yesterday, as his film crew prepared for
two-and-a-half weeks' work in the city.
Winterbottom's #4m feature film, Jude, starts filming in the capital
today. It features Christopher Eccleston (who starred in Shallow Grave)
and Kate Winset and will involve a cast of thousands.
Filming, which will take place in several areas of the city, will
involve the closure next weekend of the Royal Mile as the street plays
host to a university parade scene.
''We made it at the weekend in order to avoid as much disruption as
possible,'' explained the director. ''The locations in Edinburgh are
exactly what we were looking for. The authorities in Edinburgh and the
Scottish film bodies have been enormously co-operative.''
Jude, which is being financed by Polygram and the BBC, is the story of
a stonemason with intellectual aspirations who falls in love with his
cousin.

TWO elderly women were killed when a newly-qualified driver reached
down to pick up a bottle of juice that had fallen on the floor of his
car, Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Mrs Mary Moore, 64, was killed in the crash and Mrs Shirley Anderson,
69, died later in hospital. The teenager who caused the two-car crash,
Daniel Phillips, was yesterday fined #700, banned from driving for one
year, and ordered to resit his test.
One of his victims, Mrs Katrina Anderson, 36, who had been driving her
mother, Mrs Moore, and mother-in-law, Mrs Anderson, home, was in court
in a wheelchair to watch Phillips being sentenced.
Mrs Anderson had set off to drive her mother and parents-in-law,
Shirley and Robert Anderson, 76, back to their homes after a night-out
on December 18 last year when her car was hit head-on by the Ford Escort
driven by Phillips.
The court heard that Phillips, who had passed his test five weeks
before the crash, had leaned over to pick up a bottle that was leaking
juice on to the floor of his car.
His car crossed over the white centre lines in Edinburgh's Meadow
Place Road and collided with the vehicle driven by Mrs Anderson.
Depute fiscal Pamela Watson told the court that although it was dark
that evening road conditions were good.
Mrs Watson said: ''The accused had failed to keep his car on the
correct side of the road and allowed it to stray into the path of Mrs
Anderson's vehicle.''
Phillips, of Carrick Knowe Terrace, Edinburgh, admitted careless
driving.
He had been delivering takeaway food for a Chinese restaurant at the
time of the accident. A bottle had fallen into the passenger footwell of
his car and he leaned to pick it up, holding on to the steering wheel
with his other hand.
Mrs Anderson and her father-in-law were both seriously injured in the
crash .
Defence solicitor Mr Kenny MacAskill told the court that, in bending
over to pick up the bottle, Phillips thought he could quickly deal with
the problem.
''It was a matter he thought would be dealt with in seconds but
clearly it is a matter he is going to have to live with for the rest of
his life,'' he added.
''He was a young, inexperienced driver. It may be that what he did was
something others have done and got away with. It is a salutary lesson
that at all times the motorist must keep his eyes on the road.''
Sheriff Gordon Shiach told labourer Phillips that in dealing with the
careless driving offence he was not entitled to take into account the
tragic consequences which followed the incident in fixing a penalty.
But the sheriff said he regarded it as a very serious breach of the
Road Traffic Act. He told Phillips he had shown he had ''very little
grasp of the principles of road safety''.

CELEBRATIONS to mark Baroness Thatcher's 70th birthday culminated last
night with a glittering gala dinner attended by the Queen and the Duke
of Edinburgh.
The former Prime Minister greeted the Queen warmly at the celebration
at Claridge's in London's Mayfair, laying to rest past speculation that
the two women did not get on.
The two met every week for 11 years during Lady Thatcher's three terms
of office. The Queen's attendance at the dinner, along with more than
200 guests, was described by a Buckingham Palace source as unusual
rather than surprising.
Lady Thatcher, wearing a black brocade and velvet evening suit by
Tomasz Starewski with a pearl and diamante necklace, posed with her
husband, Sir Denis Thatcher, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh in the
marble foyer of the hotel for photographers before going in to dinner.
Dozens of people rose and applauded as the Queen, wearing a deep-green
evening dress with a shimmering top and pleated chiffon skirt, made her
way through to the ballroom for dinner.
Among the guests were Conservative Cabinet Ministers, both past and
present, supporters and friends of Lady Thatcher and Cynthia Crawford --
her right-hand woman and closest friend.
The politicians and their wives at the dinner included former
Chancellor Norman Lamont, Lord Parkinson, Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo, Lord Archer, Lord Tebbit, former Energy Secretary Lord
Wakeham, Mr John Redwood, Mr Jonathan Aitken, and Mr John Profumo.
From the world of films, the arts and television were actor Michael
Caine and his wife Shakira, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and his wife
Madeleine, Sir David Frost, BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey and
best-selling novelist Frederick Forsyth.
The guests enjoyed a starter of sole, chicken with truffle sauce as
the main course and bramble mousse for dessert.
Lady Thatcher's birthday celebrations will continue in Washington,
where it is believed 800 guests are set to gather to pay tribute to her.
Lady Thatcher was the longest-serving Prime Minister of the Queen's
reign, but the Queen's birthday gift remains a closely guarded secret.

DO-it-yourself pollution testing kits sold to the public by Friends of
the Earth have revealed alarming levels of nitrogen dioxide in Glasgow
and Aberdeen, according to the organisation.
Its head of research in Scotland, Dr Richard Dixon, said yesterday the
results from seven tests in June and July in Scotland found two were
above European guidelines and one deserved further investigation.
He said nitrogen dioxide was linked to asthma and other respiratory
problems.
One of the highests test results came from the playground of Shawlands
Primary School, Glasgow. The kit had been bought by Mrs Janice West,
whose 10-year-old son Graeme is a pupil.
Nitrogen dioxide at the site was 41 parts per billion: the European
guideline above which action should be taken stands at 31.8 parts per
billion.
The school in Pollokshaws is close to the A77 route from Ayr to
Glasgow. Mrs West, a Caledonian University lecturer, described the
results as distressing.
She said she was not an environmental activist, but Strathclyde
Regional Council needed to rethink its traffic policy. ''You can decide
what to eat and make rational decisions about your health but there's
nothing you can do about protecting your children from pollution.''
Dr Dixon said it was alarming to find such high levels in areas where
children were playing. ''We will be investigating these sites in
detail.''
He said the other high reading was taken in Aberdeen's Union Street.
A Strathclyde Regional Council spokesman said: ''The quality of air
along the A77 is obviously something which has concerned us for a long
time.'' He said the council was set to carry out a #60,000 pollution
study along the route, but predicted pollution levels would fall once
traffic was diverted along the M77 currently under construction.
He added that the Friends of the Earth test was a one-off and not
something from which conclusions could be drawn.
Friends of the Earth also published the results of a survey of single
drivers crossing the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow. The survey found that
between 7.30am and 8.30am yesterday 81% of cars had only a driver.
Dr Dixon said 25 buses could replace half the amount of cars using the
bridge during the early morning rush hour.
* A quarter of Glasgow taxis tested by the Department of Transport's
Vehicle Inspectorate outside the city's two main rail stations a
fortnight ago breached Government emissions guidelines. Yesterday it was
disclosed 24 black cabs out of a total of 95 were issued with
prohibition orders because of smokey emissions.

SENIOR administrative staff in the Ministry of Defence are ''gravely
concerned'' that a cost saving plan to privatise the missile testing
range on Benbecula will jeopardise its safety and effectiveness.
They insist a core of MoD experts must be retained to oversee
introduction of a computer system next year. The software is designed to
cope with tracking and telemetry of the range and its radar surveillance
of missile firings.
The 32-year-old Royal Artillery facility was reprieved earlier this
year after political pressure about the social impact of its proposed
closure. The range injects #10m annually into the local economy and
provides 40% of the available direct and indirect jobs in the adjacent
Hebridean islands of North and South Uist.
Although command of the base will be retained by the Army, the
majority of jobs held by military or civil service personnel will be
privatised.
An MoD source said yesterday: ''The range is further from the
Ministry's procurement office in London than the Pyrenees are in the
other direction. The antiquated computer system already in place there
is to be updated by a multi-million-pound replacement next year. It is a
museum piece and needs replacement.
''But by that time, the responsibility for testing and accepting that
system, which oversees security and safety, will be in the hands of a
private contractor. That is a matter of grave concern.
''It is essential that there are sufficient trained MoD personnel on
site to test and accept that system. There must also be concern about
the future of the range and its safety without that safeguard.''
An MoD spokesman said: ''We are not in the business of risking lives
or safety. The Royal Artillery will remain in charge of the facility
with civilian contractors responsible for the operation of the range.''

RANGERS goalkeeper Andy Goram was charged with drink-driving yesterday
and released on bail on the eve of the team's flight to Italy for the
European Champions' League match with Juventus.
The 31-year-old Scotland international is expected to appear at
Linlithgow Sheriff Court later this month.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police yesterday said: ''We can
confirm a 31-year-old man was charged with a road traffic matter earlier
today. A report has now gone to the procurator-fiscal at Linlithgow in
connection with this incident.''
If convicted, the player faces a minimum 12-month driving ban and a
fine.
A spokeswoman for Rangers said it was too early to say if Goram would
face disciplinary action but stressed the incident would not threaten
his place in the team for the Turin match.
The alleged offence happened in Blackness Road, Linlithgow.
The goalkeeper, who lives in Midlothian, was last month given the
go-ahead to sell his #242,000 home in Roslin after a judge lifed a legal
restriction blocking the sale of the house after the player agreed to
lodge #5900 with the court.
The restriction was in the form of an inhibition by Ian McDonald
Preservation, of Lasswade Road, Edinburgh, which is suing Goram at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court for #5875 for work on the house.
The footballer has lodged a counter-claim for more than #9000,
claiming the work was not done properly.
As security for its claim, IMP obtained an inhibition that blocked the
sale of the Roslin property and a second home Mr Goram owns in Penicuik.
In August, the player was at the centre of controversy when he pulled
out of the important World Cup qualifying match against Greece, claiming
that he was ''not 100% upstairs''.

A STIRLINGSHIRE company has attacked the Government over changes in
tendering regulations which it claims could put many small companies out
of business.
Mr Jim Hornall, managing director of Lightways (Contractors), claimed
the decison to suspend compulsory competitive tendering for two years on
contracts up to #500,000 was handing the initiative back to local
authority direct labour organisations.
He said: ''Small business look to the Tories to be their defenders. I
could almost burst into tears when I think of what's happening. They've
totally let us down. We're back to where we were 10 years ago.''
For the two years up to financial year 1997/98, compulsory competitive
tendering has been suspended for contracts up to #500,000 in order to
mitigate the upheaval among councils until the completion of local
government reform.
Mr Hornall yesterday outlined the effects of that decision. In April
this year, his Larbert-based company had around 100 employees -- 30
white collar and 72 tradesmen, labourers, and foremen.
At present the tally is 44 manual labour, and 22 white collar, with 11
of the office employees at present working their notice.
He said: ''This is because there are no tenders to price. This is a
direct result of this suspension of compulsory competitive tendering.
''We're constantly being told that tenders will come out to us because
local authority DLOs won't be able to handle all the work. But the DLOs
are grasping at everything quite greedily.''
Lightways, which carries out street lighting work and road surfacing,
has asked Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to review the situation
urgently.

TWO men who broke into a house were locked in a horse trailer by
passers-by and towed to the nearest police station.
Alan Severs, 31, was sentenced to 150 hours' community service and
Tommy Ferguson, 51, fined #500 at Alloa Sheriff Court yesterday.
Severs, of Nethergate, Alva, and Ferguson, of Hillview Terrace,
Tillicoultry, pled guilty to breaking into West Lodge cottage on the
Harviestoun estate, near Dollar, on March 25.
Both admitted stealing two pot plants from the conservatory, and
Severs admitted stealing a cordless telephone.
After the case, farm worker Mr Brian Wills, 26, of Home Farm Cottage,
Harviestoun Estate, told how he was driving past the lodge with his
estate manager, Mr Ian Anderson, 56, when Mr Anderson spotted the two
men at the back of the cottage.
''Ian said we'd better go round the back and see what's up,'' said Mr
Wills. ''We went round and found somebody had broken into the porch. The
window was all smashed.
''I turned round and looked at the garden, and there's these two guys,
crouched down behind the greenhouse.
''I rushed at them, and the two of them stood up. One of them ran away
but found he couldn't get over the fence.
''Ian ran and grabbed him and I grabbed the other guy. They were
stinking of drink. They were full of it.
''Then we realised we needed to take them to the police station, so we
opened the door of the horsebox Ian had been towing, put them in and
locked the door.
''They didn't want to go in, but it was a clean trailer. It wasn't
covered in muck. So that was our mobile jail.''
Mr Anderson towed the trailer to Tillicoultry police station, with Mr
Wills following in the farm lorry.
Mr Anderson said: ''They weren't too hard to catch. We just got them
by the scruff of the neck and chucked them in the trailer, with Brian at
one end and me at the other.
''It happened so quick. We caught them and had to think what we were
going to do with them.
''Once they were in the trailer they couldn't get out, because it
locks from the outside.''
A spokesman for Central Scotland Police said: ''This was good
citizenship in action. These men were obviously quite brave. We were
very pleased to have these men delivered to our door.''
In court, Ferguson's solicitor said his client had been very drunk.
''This was a botched attempt at a break-in,'' he said.
Severs' agent said his client wanted to put the affair behind him and
make a fresh start.

Son tells court of tycoon's autocratic business methods and how he
took on the Mafia.
ROBERT MAXWELL was a man driven by work and a desire for power, a
spectacular risk taker possessed of great personal charm but at the same
time a bully who frightened his own children, his son said yesterday.
The tycoon's fourth and youngest son, Kevin, outlined his father's
complex character and detailed his autocratic business methods,
including his willingness to take on the Mafia, to an Old Bailey jury.
It is the first time Kevin Maxwell -- on trial with his brother, Ian,
and former financial adviser Larry Trachtenberg -- has given a public
defence to allegations that he conspired to defraud pension funds by
misusing shares.
He went into the witness box and told the jury that at all times he
believed what his father had told him -- that the shares had been
transferred from the pension funds to the Robert Maxwell Group.
Even after his father's death at sea -- which the jury will hear
evidence about -- Mr Maxwell said he believed the banks would continue
to support him and the group, that there was an investor prepared to
inject #400m into the group and that it was ''saveable''.
Mr Maxwell painted a picture to the court of his father as a
dominating, frightening man, who could switch from great charm and
generosity to brutal verbal bullying of even his family and most senior
employees.
Arguing with Robert Maxwell was a ''gruelling, physically demanding''
task, said Mr Maxwell, who admitted that as a child he was ''very
frightened'' of his father.
He was a man possessed by work and driven by the desire for power
rather than money, who had no interests outside work.
He was a ''spectacular risk taker'', who had turned round companies on
the brink of bankruptcy and amassed a personal fortune of more than
#1000m by the late 1980s, said Mr Maxwell.
He recalled the founding and growth of his father's first company,
Pergamon Press: ''I believe his lasting business achievement . . . is
the creation and development of Pergamon Press.''
He continued: ''He was basically a man possessed by business. He had
no interests outside business. It consumed his life.
''He worked from very early -- sometimes 5am in the morning -- to 10
at night every day, including weekends.
''He had the management ability to take many decisions rapidly. He was
somebody who inspired great loyalty and he was a real leader in that
sense, a charismatic leader.
''He wasn't motivated by money, he was motivated by power, the ability
to influence events, the ability to make a difference, to change things,
not only in this country but abroad,'' he added.
''He was an exceedingly generous individual, not simply in terms of
donations to charity but individual acts of generosity for people who
worked for him or wrote to him or members of the public.
''He was somebody who dominated any business that he was involved in
and that domination was partly physical.
''He was a big man, he had enormous charisma and a commanding presence
in a room. Given his weight and bulk he could dominate and did dominate
every meeting that he attended.''
''He was capable of being extremely charming to people, he was capable
of winning but he was also capable of verbal brutality in meetings,
public dressing-downs not only of his children but also his senior
managers.
''He was capable of being a bully.'' Mr Maxwell described how his
father would hold daily meetings with senior managers at Mirror Group
Newspapers. If any of the managers reported something he didn't like,
Robert Maxwell would publicly humiliate him.
''It was possible to change his mind, but it would be very rare and
extremely physically gruelling to achieve.
''The arguments were frequent and he was as abusive to me as to
others. He disliked criticism and disliked advice that did not follow
what he wanted to do and it was the same for me as for the others.
''Loyalty was the single most important attribute that anyone who
worked with him could have. He demanded total loyalty.''
People were willing to work for Robert Maxwell despite his bullying
nature because of the other, charming side of his character and because
he worked in such exciting fields, Mr Maxwell said.
His father also made senior executives open the mail ''it was his way
of imposing his will on them and putting the fear of God into people''.
He described his earliest impressions of his father: ''I was in awe of
him as a child, I was very frightened.''
In the 1970s Robert Maxwell was branded unfit to run a public company
by Government inspectors. These reports had left him ''with a sense of
outrage about the whole injustice of the process. He rebutted every
allegation and fought to clear his name,'' Mr Maxwell said.
Answering questions from his counsel, Mr Alun Jones QC, Mr Maxwell
detailed the growth of his father's business empire from 1981 -- when he
took over the ailing British Printing Corporation and Hollis, the timber
company -- through 1984 when he bought the Mirror Group from Reed
International and to 1988 when he acquired the companies Macmillan and
OAG for more than $3500m.
He recalled that Mr Richard Baker, Mirror Group's deputy managing
director (finance), had objected to the price determined by Robert
Maxwell and that this had led to a furious argument ending only when Mr
Baker left the boardroom, leaving Robert Maxwell free to push through
his preferred price.
His business practices continued unchanged until his death, said Mr
Maxwell. ''I would say that all my life I can categorically say that he
put work first and it was the consuming passion of his life.
''He was a spectacular risk-taker. He would take the risk of taking
businesses that were essentially bust and investing substantial capital
and taking the risk that he could turn them round as he did with British
Printing Corporation and the Mirror.''
Questioned by Mr Jones about his father's attitudes to the law and
honesty Mr Maxwell said ''in terms of his own personal honesty and
integrity, I never doubted it during his life''.
His father ''loathed'' fraud in his own business and was ''absolutely
ferocious'' if he thought employees were stealing, personally
investigating the circumstances himself.
As for the law his father viewed it ''as a weapon to be used in
business like any other weapon. He would stretch the law as far as it
would go for his business ends''.
Mr Maxwell said he believed his father was ''contemptuous'' of certain
pieces of legislation ''but I would not describe him as someone who
thought he was above the law.''
But he gave examples of how his father stretched the law breaking its
spirit if not its letter. Because football regulations forbade one
person having more than one chairmanship he installed his sons at clubs
where he held substantial interests including Derby, Oxford, and
Reading.
Mr Maxwell said his father's attitude to shareholders was that they
had invested in him, his management and his control of the business. ''I
don't think he ever saw a divergence between his interests and those of
outside shareholders.''
Robert Maxwell regarded the pension funds as assets of the group
because of the obligations of the company to make good any deficit in
them and because of the company's contributions to the schemes.
''He certainly believed -- and said so in my presence and the presence
of professional advisers -- that any pension fund surplus belonged to
the company,'' Mr Maxwell told the court.
For the last year of his life Robert Maxwell was not as well as he had
been. But despite a persistent chest infection he continued to work
''incredibly long hours''.
When his mammoth negotiations for control of the strike-bound New York
Daily News succeeded, he even took on the Mafia who controlled
distribution of the newspaper and drained its profits lifeblood, Mr
Maxwell said.
At the same time he was involved in expanding the European newspaper
he had founded the year before. He was also active in the Israeli
company Scitex, sitting on the board and promoting its development.
It is #100m worth of shares in Scitex which the prosecution allege Mr
Maxwell and his late father misused by using them to settle private
Maxwell company debts when they belonged to the pension funds.
Kevin and Ian Maxwell, and Mr Trachtenberg face a similar charge in
relation to #22m worth of shares in another Israeli company Teva, which
they are alleged to have pledged as a security for a loan in a vain bid
to prop up the ailing Maxwell empire.
The trial continues.

THE public funding of a business and leisure centre, exclusively for
homosexuals, was yesterday criticised by community leaders.
The new complex in Glasgow's Georgian Old Customs House will contain
shops, four business units, a cafeteria, and meeting rooms.
But only gay and lesbian entrepreneurs or those producing artifacts
for the gay community will be allowed to lease shop outlets.
Last night, the organisers predicted it would become the biggest and
most exciting gay centre in Britain.
''It's a milestone, in Glasgow of all places,'' said Gay and Lesbian
Centre Project chairman John Wilkes.
Strathclyde Regional Council has agreed to contribute #47,000 towards
the project and Glasgow Development Agency will provide a further
#15,000. The Gay and Lesbian Centre Project will invest #23,000 in the
venture.
The issue has split Glasgow District Council and enraged local
politicians who see the centre as a misuse of public funds.
Glasgow Tory group leader Bill Aitken said: ''All we hear is whingeing
and moaning about cut-backs and yet money can be found for this sort of
project.
''Certainly, if this can help with their health problems, I'm
supportive, but why can this not be done in a project which is not
exclusively for gays?
''Many of us have problems explaining this sort of thing to our
constituents and it seems that we live in an era of positive
discrimination which is totally wrong and furthermore distasteful.''
The Gay and Lesbian Centre Project, a charity established four years
ago, has 180 members throughout the west of Scotland. A limited company
was formed in the charity's name on take-over of the building.
Its chairman, Mr Wilkes, said the development would be ''a busy and
relevant place for gay people''.
''Lesbian and gay people have the right to expect the same resources
and services as other minority groups,'' Mr Wilkes said.
''Society sanctions services to communities such as disabled groups
and ethnic minority groups. In my mind I see no difference.''
Special invitations for the official opening on November 4 were
delivered yesterday. It coincides with the end of the controversial
10-day Gayfest celebrations in Glasgow.
Mr Arthur Bell, chairman of the Scottish Tory Reform Group, said he
was astonished that public money should fund the project.
0 A spokesman for Glasgow Development Agency said the project met with
their criteria for renovating a previously derelict building, urban
regeneration, and creating jobs. Those behind the scheme say that
offices and shops within the centre will create up to 20 jobs.
Councillor John Gray, chair of Strathclyde's social strategy committee
which approved approved the grant, said it had been made in line with
council's equal opportunities policy. He declined to comment further on
details of the scheme.
Tayside North MP Bill Walker said last night: ''I am sure the people
of Strathclyde will think that their money could be used much more
usefully and sensibly in helping disadvantaged groups rather than for
particular lobbies.
''It is another example of how the Labour Party, whether in government
or at local level, misspend public funds,'' he said.

FUMING hotelier Barry Page-Dove -- in an act worthy of Basil Fawlty
himself -- found an elderly couple had been smoking in their room, so he
fined them #20.
The couple, on a 40-strong coach tour, were stunned and at first
refused to pay. But they finally coughed up to save their friends from
further embarrassment.
Mr Page-Dove, 54, boss of the Anchorage Hotel in Torquay, Devon --
which was used for the hit sitcom Fawlty Towers -- operates a strict
no-smoking policy in most parts of the hotel, including the bedrooms.
So when he discovered pensioners Jack and Margaret Beaumont, from
Huddersfield, had sneaked in for a smoke, he was furious. ''I went to
them and told them they knew smoking was banned. This was blatant
disregard for the comfort of other guests, to whom the ban had been
spelled out.''
He added: ''It's my way of recouping the money I've got to spend on
cleaning the room to get rid of the nasty smell.
''We are advertised as a non-smoking hotel, so the next guest who
arrived would have been offended. The #20 was to cover the cost of
cleaning the carpets and curtains.''
The fine was added to the Beaumonts' bill when they left the
54-bedroom hotel at the weekend.
Mr Beaumont said yesterday: ''It left a nasty taste in my mouth. We
knew nothing about any fine until we were leaving.''

CROWN prosecutors in the first Guinness trial five years ago were
accused in court yesterday of robbing Ernest Saunders and his
co-defendants of a fair hearing by subjecting them to an ''inquisition''
by company law inspectors before calling in the police.
The Court of Appeal heard from a letter referring to ''breaking
Saunders completely''.
The four accused were ''targeted for prosecution'' by the deliberate
use of Department of Trade and Industry inspectors to carry out initial
interviews on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the court
was told.
Unlike the police, the inspectors were not required to caution
suspects or to abide by Police and Criminal Evidence Act rules, said Mr
Jonathan Caplan, QC, for Saunders.
Mr Caplan quoted from a letter written by a DTI solicitor, which said:
''The inspectors are now much more optimistic about breaking Saunders
completely. He is beginning to come apart at the seams.
''This development confirms the wisdom of leaving the inspectors to
get on with it rather than putting in the police.''
Saunders, 59, the former Guinness chairman, and his co-accused, Heron
International tycoon Gerald Ronson, 56; stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 49;
and consultant Jack Lyons, 79, are appealing against their conviction by
a jury in 1990 after a 112-day trial.
The charges related to an alleged illegal share support operation to
boost the value of Guinness shares during the company's successful
#2700m takeover battle with Argyll for control of the Scottish drinks
group, Distillers, in 1986.
Saunders, Ronson, and Parnes served prison sentences. Lyons, suffering
from ill health, was fined #3m, and later stripped of his knighthood.
If they win their appeal, they are expected to claim compensation of
at least #10m.
Mr Caplan told Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, sitting with Mr
Justice Macpherson and Mr Justice Potter: ''This was not a case where
the inspectors came across criminal offences in the course of their work
and passed the material on for investigation by the police.
''This was a case where there was an agenda that inquisition was to be
followed by prosecution.''
He said the transcripts of the inspectors' interviews with the four
were used as part of the prosecution. If the trial judge, Mr Justice
Henry, had known the background, he might have stopped the trial as
being an abuse of process, or at the very least excluded the transcripts
from the evidence.
Also central to the appeal is a complaint that the Serious Fraud
Office wrongly failed to disclose the findings of a tribunal which
concluded that similar share support transactions in relation to other
companies were not contrary to accepted City practice.
The appeal hearing continues.

Argument blamed for decision.
PAROLED lifer George Beattie was on his way back to Saughton Prison in
Edinburgh last night as his MP, Mr Jimmy Hood, described the decision to
revoke his parole as ''truly outrageous''.
Friends of Beattie, who has constantly claimed his innocence since
being convicted of murdering typist Margaret McLaughlin at Carluke,
Lanarkshire, in 1973, said they feared for his life as he had said in
the past that he would rather kill himself than face further time behind
bars.
Yet the decision to send him back to prison was said to have been
taken simply because he had an argument with his parole officer over
finding the time to attend meetings which would fit in with his job as a
bus driver.
His lawyer, Mr Alistair Duff, said it could be months before Beattie
had the opportunity to go before the Parole Board and argue that it had
taken the wrong decision -- a decision which was ratified by Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Beattie was first paroled in 1986 but was recalled to prison six years
later after admitting a breach of the peace at the office of his then
social worker.
He was released in 1994 pending an appeal against his conviction but
it was refused and he went back to jail.
In March, he was released on parole amid intense media interest. To
escape the attention, Beattie moved to Slough where he took a job as a
bus driver.
Mr Peter Hill, a BBC producer who made the Rough Justice programmes
about possible miscarriages of justice, said there appeared to be no
justification for sending Beattie back to jail.
Beattie, it appears, had written to the chief probation officer at
Berkshire to suggest that the times for his weekly meeting with a parole
officer should be more flexible because of his work committments.
The chief probation officer wrote back only a fortnight ago saying
that he hoped suitable arrangements could be made.
Since then, it appears that Beattie, who has a low IQ, had a row with
his local parole officer. This was reported to the Parole Board in
Scotland which recommended to Mr Forsyth that the licence on which he
was released be revoked.
He agreed, and the local police force, according to Mr Hill, arrived
in the middle of night, battered down the door of Beattie's flat in
Slough, and took him into custody. He is now en route to Edinburgh to
continue his life sentence.
Clydesdale MP Jimmy Hood, is seeking a meeting with Scottish Minister
of State Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
''There is no question of him being in trouble with the police or
committing any crime. It has simply been a disagreement with his parole
officer. I'm flabbergasted that he's being sent back to jail.
''Because of George's problems, his family met with parole officers
earlier this year and said that if there were any problems, please get
in touch with them. This did not happen, and I will want to know why.
''I would also question the over-reaction of the police who treated
the whole affair as if it was an armed siege with three cars turning up
outside his house in the middle of the night. It is truly outrageous.''
Meanwhile Mr Hill, who has kept in touch with Beattie,fears there may
be sinister overtones to Beattie's return behind bars.
''We can only guess as to why the Thames Valley Police had to wait
until the middle of the night on Saturday morning to drag him from his
bed and take him into custody. I suspect that what may be going on is a
softening-up exercise designed to lead eventually to a full confession
from George to a crime in 1973 that he did not commit,'' he said.
A spokesman for the Parole Board in Scotland said it could not
commenton individual cases.

Derek Lewis moved from the world of television to take up the top post
in the Prison Service.
DEREK Lewis is a former chief executive of Granada TV. His appointment
to the top job at the Prison Service was a controversial one with his
critics, particularly in union circles, repeatedly questioning the
wisdom of bringing in an executive from the private sector with no
operational experience of the prison system.
He was chairman of the UK Gold satellite television station when in
1992 he was head hunted for the #125,000-a-year post, plus substantial
performance related bonus, although he is thought to have taken a
significant pay cut to move from the private sector.
In an interview with the Financial Times in January 1993 Mr Lewis, who
was appointed by the then Home Secretary, Kenneth Clarke, acknowledged
he had had doubts about whether the move was a good idea.
He said: ''My initial reaction was that I wasn't sure if it was the
right job at all. It sounded like the proverbial bed of nails. But I was
persuaded to go and have a talk to them.''
His principal concern was not so much the desirability or practicality
of bringing private sector disciplines to a high-profile public sector
service, as how to strike the fine balance between ensuring security and
maintaining humane conditions.
''What persuaded me was that there was an opportunity to effect real
change -- not to get everybody absolutely happy with what the prison
service is doing, but to persuade the majority of those constituencies
that it was much better than it had been a few years before,'' he said.
He came not with a brief to implement large-scale privatisation but to
achieve the quality improvements demanded by the Woolf inquiry into the
1990 Stangeways riot, and to deliver better value for money, he said.
The embarrassments at Whitemoor and Parkhurst may well have shifted
his focus from those objectives towards a greater concern with security.
Responding to criticisms in the annual report of the Prison Reform
Trust, Mr Lewis declared: ''Security is our primary duty. The escapes
from Whitemoor and Parkhurst were very serious matters and the service
is determined to do all that it can to protect the public.''

Private route to funding
Forsyth views Skye bridge as way ahead
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday said the Skye bridge,
built by private finance, was how major projects would be funded in
future.
After he performed the official opening ceremony, Mr Forsyth forecast
private money would be used in Scotland for infrastructure projects
which could include schools, hospitals, sewage works and roads.
The opening of the bridge brought to an end nearly a century of the
Kyle of Lochalsh ferry as Skye's main lifeline to the mainland, and also
brought a warning by protesters of a programme of civil disobedience
over the level of toll charges.
They said that, when tolls were levied at midnight, some opposed to
the car price of #5.20 in summer and #4.30 in winter would cross the
bridge but refuse to pay.
Mr Forsyth praised the extraordinary achievement of building the
bridge, which he said also highlighted the real potential of the
Government's Private Finance Initiative for the rest of Scotland.
''I think it points the way forward. The Skye bridge was first mooted
in 1938 and I think there were three attempts to deliver it. We
delivered the Skye bridge and we have delivered it by pursuing this
particular avenue of private finance.''
A significant swing in favour of the Government's controversial
Private Finance Initiative is forecast by senior Scottish Office civil
servants as more multi-million pound projects go out to tender before
the new year.
Bidders for at least six more initiatives, worth well over #400m --
including a new Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh and Law Hospital in
Lanarkshire -- are expected to be sought before the year's end.
It has been reported that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is planning to
announce a target of #5000m for PFI projects throughout the UK in next
month's Budget, double the total for this year.
However, MP Henry McLeish, Labour's Scottish transport spokesman,
blames the Tory drive for private finance for placing a west coast main
line upgrading in jeopardy, while Taylor Woodrow chairman Mr Colin
Parson has said PFI was ''obviously constipated'' and not working.
Mr Forsyth said he knew there was a view that a Skye bridge should
have been paid for out of the public purse. He disagreed. It would have
taken at least another generation before that could happen, he said.
''I know that they want a new school in Portree. I know there are
other priorities in health care elsewhere. If we can finance bridges in
this way, it leaves scarce resources for other important projects.''
He said there was now a whole string of projects that had been
requested -- hospitals, schools, roads, sewage works and drainage
systems.
Mr Forsyth said that, although the Government would look at individual
projects under the PFI, there were no general plans to extend the toll
principle. On the Skye bridge he was happy to give a categoric guarantee
that the tolls would come off in a maximum of 27 years but perhaps even
as soon as after 14 years.
He criticised ''totally irresponsible'' reports that the bridge was
cracking up, and said it was untrue that he had made panic phone calls
to the bridge's engineers.
He said he could not understand proposals by some local campaigners to
run a car ferry in direct competition to the bridge. ''It is a perverse,
foolish notion. Anyone who wants to run a ferry, which will mean keeping
the tolls for longer and justifies it on the basis they are against the
tolls, needs their heads examined.''
The opening ceremony was performed by Mr Forsyth and Steven Campbell,
10, from Ratagan, the winner of a schools competition.
Mr James Miller, chairman of the Miller Group which with German
partners Dywidag built the #25m bridge, said: ''I would like to pay
tribute to the site team who have produced this magnificent bridge.
''As an engineering achievement, the bridge is a world leader. It is
an outstanding example of modern engineering technology which has been
applied to produce a bridge of the highest quality.''
Sir Iain Noble, chairman of Skye Bridge Ltd, which will operate the
bridge and who originally opposed the idea, said: ''Now the bridge is
here, let's make the most of it. There has been too much controversy and
we don't want the world to think of Skye as an island of grumblers.''
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, secretary of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group,
however, said it was a sad day. ''We have been saying from the start
that, once the Government got the principle established in Skye, the
private sector would move into other public projects. Now Mr Forsyth has
confirmed it. As far as we are concerned, the fight against the tolls
will continue.''
Meanwhile, generations of Skye people, and others from all over the
Highlands, turned out in their hundreds to say farewell to the two
CalMac 36-car ferries, the Loch Fyne and Loch Dunvegan, dwarfing the
bridge opening. They had been due to make their last sailings to and
from Skye at 3pm, but extra sailings had to be put on, despite the
bridge being free until midnight.
CalMac managing director Mr Colin Paterson said: ''This is a great
tribute to the ferry, which we have been running for a very long time.''

<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY was launched at a Scottish hospital last night after a
woman revealed that she had to drive the dead body of her grandson more
than 60 miles home.
Mrs Evelyn Adam, 63, described the harrowing journey she made from
Edinburgh to her son's home in Arbroath after the death of her
four-month-old grandson, Christopher Holden, at the Royal Hospital for
Sick Children in Edinburgh.
She explained that the ordeal was made worse because, while
Christopher's father Mr Eddie Holden cradled his dead son in his arms,
his wife Helda and their three other children, including Christopher's
twin brother, Craig, travelled in the car beside them.
Mrs Adam, of Inverkeilor, Angus, told last night how the family's
traumatic experience unfolded in March this year. ''Christopher had been
in hospital for the whole four months of his life and went through three
major operations for heart trouble.
''I got the phone call to say he died and I went through to Edinburgh,
thinking I would be picking up the wee ones.
''I went into the room where Eddie and Helda were and the nurse said
she would just go and get the baby.
''She came through with Christopher fully dressed and wrapped in a
shawl.
''They then said they would have to take my registration mark to
notify the police that I was on the road.''
Then Mrs Adam, her son and daughter-in-law, with children Danielle,
Jay, Martin and Christopher's twin, Craig, got into the car for the
harrowing journey back to the family home in Arbroath.
Mrs Adam added: ''I thought this was just normal procedure, but I
couldn't console my son.
''I remember when we were going out of the hospital he said: 'This is
just what I have always wanted, to bring Christopher home, but not like
this.' I just had to blot out what was around me. It was the only way I
could get up the road.
''When we got up the road I phoned the undertaker and when he came
along he said he couldn't believe it.''
Mrs Adam said her son and his family have now moved to Dorset after
Christopher's death and added that they have been unable to speak about
the journey from hospital in the past six months.
Close to tears, she said the hospital were marvellous when Christopher
was alive. They couldn't do any more.
''But I'll never forget this. We've never spoken about this because
it's too upsetting I just don't know how this was allowed to happen.''
A spokesman for the hospital said: ''The hospital, on the information
available to it, is conducting a full inquiry.''
The hospital policy is that, if a child dies who lives outwith the
Lothian area, the body is given to an undertaker and transported at no
expense to a destination of the parent's choosing.
But parents can take away their child's body if they wish.

Minister rules out boxing ban
THE Sports Minister yesterday ruled out a total ban on boxing
following the death of Glasgow fighter James Murray at the weekend.
Mr Iain Sproat told the Commons that the British Boxing Board of
Control was conducting a full inquiry, the conclusions of which would be
looked at later in the year.
An independent working party was set up after the death in 1994 of
British super-featherweight Bradley Stone, and last night it appeared
that Ministers were putting the matter on hold until its full report is
published next month.
This is likely to take on board any lessons learned from what was
described by Mr Sproat yesterday as a ''dreadful tragedy''.
The issue was raised in the Commons by Labour MP Peter Hain (Neath).
He said: ''Surely after James Murray's death, the second boxer in
Britain in 18 months, on top of all the other serious injuries, the
Government should now insist that any public money is made conditional
on a root and branch reform of boxing.
''Perhaps this should include a ban on punching to the head, stopping
dangerous dehydration, and other reforms that are absolutely necessary
to put safety first. Otherwise boxing should be banned altogether.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Menzies Campbell called for an
independent public inquiry into the safety of boxing. He demanded: ''Why
not a Royal Commission for that purpose?''
Mr Sproat replied: ''There will be an inquiry by the British Boxing
Board of Control in the next couple of weeks. There is an independent
working group under the neurologist Peter Richards which will be
reporting in November, and I suggest the best thing we should do in the
meantime is see what both reports say.
''I am not in favour at this moment of a Royal Commission, but we will
certainly look at the matter again.''
During the exchanges, Mr Harry Greenway, Tory MP for Ealing North,
defended boxing as a positive recreation for young people. He asked Mr
Sproat not to divert public funds away from boxing in the wake of the
death.
Mr Sproat agreed it was a terrific sport and said it would be a great
shame if the death was to weigh too heavily.
He said: ''The fact of the matter is that, when deaths from sports
were last looked at in a comprehensive way between 1986 and 1992, there
were some 268 deaths from other sports, including 40 deaths from ball
games, as opposed to only three deaths from boxing. We should not let
ourselves be overwhelmed by one tragedy.''
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said licensing at
boxing would be examined as part of a wide-ranging review.
A Scottish Office spokesman said Lord James had also asked civil
servants to study all the relevant issues surrounding the weekend's
events.
Strathclyde police have promised a full investigation into the
violence which followed Murray's collapse, and officers were travelling
to London today to collect video footage from Sky TV.

TWO beleaguered Scottish NHS trusts have been given cash boosts
totalling #1.5m by the health boards that fund them, in a bid to help
them out of massive financial crises.
Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust, which recently announced an
operating deficit of at least #1.75m for the past year, has been offered
#1m from Grampian Health Board, while Highland Health Board has agreed
to make #500,000 available to the Highland Communities NHS Trust, which
is facing a #1.8m budget shortfall this year.
The Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, Mr Charles
Kennedy, last night welcomed the news of the Highland Health Board move,
which he said showed that public, political and parliamentary pressure
had paid off.
But he stressed that the cash injections had come from the health
boards' existing budgets and were not the result of ''Scottish Office
largesse''.
He added: ''In my House of Commons debate with Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton (Scottish Health Minister) tomorrow night I will now be
pressing him to find additional funds from his central budget to help
make good the #1.3m deficit which still remains at the Highland
Communities NHS Trust.''
Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, said he hoped
Grampian Health Board would be given an extra #1m by the Scottish Office
to cover the outlay.
The decision to provide the extra money was also welcomed by Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton, who said: ''This is very good news for the
people of Grampian and the Highlands and will ensure that patient care
is not affected while these two trusts work on their recovery plans.''
Scottish Office health bosses had ordered the one-time flagship
Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust -- the first in Scotland -- to
prepare a survival package urgently.
Fears were expressed that wards would close, operations would be
delayed, and nurses axed as the trust battled to cut #1m off its budget
at short notice.
The problems in Aberdeen came to light in the summer when a senior
consultant claimed the trust was ''technically bankrupt'' and described
its financial affairs as ''an absolute mess''.
Trust management initially denied they were facing a cash crisis but
were later forced to admit there had been an exchange of letters between
them and the Scottish Office to try to ease their financial plight.
The Highland Communities NHS Trust, which runs 17 hospitals in the
Highlands, got into deep financial water when a former finance director
''forgot'' to claim #1m it was due from the Highland Health Board.
A subsequent inquiry established that a further #800,000 was needed to
balance the books during the current financial year.

Howard in 'scapegoat' row.
Political row over prison sacking
THE sacked Director General of the Prison Service, Mr Derek Lewis,
yesterday turned on the man who dismissed him, Home Secretary Michael
Howard. Mr Lewis had refused to resign.
He said it was for ''others to judge'' whether he had been the victim
of a political decision.
Others were quick to do so.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw accused Mr Howard of ''scapegoating''
Prison Service chiefs to ensure that the buck stopped anywhere but with
himself.
Mr Lewis's union, the First Division Association, condemned the
sacking as ''unreasonable and disgraceful''.
However, the Prime Minister backed his Home Secretary again by
endorsing the decision to sack Mr Lewis from his #125,000-a-year post.
It is the second time in less than a week that Mr Major has stood by
Mr Howard's decisions. The Prime Minister defended Mr Howard at the Tory
conference after his proposals for prison reforms and sentencing were
attacked by Lord Chief Justice Lord Taylor.
The dismissal of Mr Lewis, following a series of disastrous prison
escapes south of the Border, was announced to the Commons after the Home
Secretary had gone to the Prime Minister at No 10 to state his reasons.
Mr Lewis, halfway through his five-year contract, believed he was
being made a scapegoat. He listened to the public announcement of his
dismissal, sitting in the Strangers' Gallery of the Commons.
Emerging from the Commons later, Mr Lewis said: ''I am very
disappointed. I committed myself to getting this Prison Service right.
The evidence is there for everyone to see outside that we were well on
the way to doing that.''
The Lewis sacking yesterday is designed to demonstrate to the nation
that there is a new smack of firm government emanating from the Cabinet.
Mr Howard told the Commons: ''I must be able to assure this House, and
through it the public, that the grave weaknesses in the service which
have been disclosed will be put right. I have come to the conclusion,
with some sadness, that this requires a change of leadership at the top
of the Prison Service.''
The announcement took the Commons by surprise. Opposition MPs
immediately called for the Home Secretary's resignation.
The decision was based on the inquiry into the breakdown of prison
security by Sir John Learmont, who recommended that there was no need
for a disciplinary inquiry into the conduct of prison staff:
responsibility fell on those at the very top on the Prison Board.
Sir John began his inquiry into security at the prisons of England and
Wales last December in the wake of the IRA breakout from Whitemoor
prison in Cambridgeshire, but the focus shifted to last January's escape
by three dangerous prisoners from Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight.
Mr Howard told the Commons he could not overlook the report's serious
criticisms.
In a letter to the Home Secretary, Mr Lewis complained he was given
only 45 minutes to discuss the findings of Sir John's report into the
Parkhurst escape with Mr Howard.
''I do not consider this adequate in order to reach a proper view on
such an important decision,'' he wrote.
Later Mr Lewis said demands from Ministers for operational details
about the service had been a ''distraction'' and that the line between
operational and policy matters had become confused.
''There is no question that that distinction has become muddied,'' he
told Channel 4 News.
Mr Howard, however, speaking on the same programme, insisted that the
division of responsibilities was clear. ''There is a clear distinction
between operational and policy responsibilities,'' he insisted.
Mr Howard said: ''If the criticisms in this report had been made of
me, I would have gone, but they are not.''
The Learmont report into the Parkhurst breakout, which provoked a
five-day manhunt across the Isle of Wight, contained a series of
ferocious criticisms of the service Mr Lewis headed, couched in
astonishingly blunt language.
The former Army Quartermaster General talked of ''a chapter of errors
at every level and a naivety that defies belief'' and said procedures at
Parkhurst were pervaded by ''disastrous indecision and apathy''.
He recommended the construction of a super-maximum security prison to
house 200 of the country's most dangerous prisoners and a long catalogue
of other security improvements which could eventually cost #290m or
more.
Mr Lewis will be replaced in the short term by Mr Richard Tilt,
currently the service's head of security.
In a particularly damning section of the report, Sir John said: ''The
escape from Parkhurst was not based on any new or ingenious plan but
simply on the ability of prisoners to follow a well-trodden path through
loose and ineffective security.
''The alarm bells should have been constantly ringing throughout the
Prison Service; some heard but did too little too late; others showed a
reprehensible complacency and a false sense of invulnerability.''
The hard-hitting report identified ''lax and unprofessional''
procedures which made it ''relatively easy for the escapees to achieve
their objective''.
Government sources said the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Judge Stephen
Tumim, had alerted both Mr Lewis and Mr Howard to potential problems at
Parkhurst during an inspection there before the breakout.
The Home Secretary tackled Mr Lewis about the judge's concerns and was
reassured the problems had been sorted out.
The fact that the breakout occurred shortly afterwards made Mr Lewis's
position untenable.
Sir John's report said Parkhurst, supposedly one of Britain's most
secure prisons, was ''totally unsuitable'' for housing some of the most
difficult prisoners in the system.
The report concludes that the prison should be downgraded ''as soon as
possible'' to take lower security prisoners, with higher risk prisoners
being moved to other establishments.
Expressions of sympathy for Mr Lewis came from several quarters.
Mr Stephen Shaw, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said he believed
Mr Lewis had been unlucky and that no change at the top would have any
effect if Mr Howard's ''obsessive interference'' with the work of the
prison service continued.
''Who would willingly apply for the post of Michael Howard's whipping
boy?'' he asked.
Mr Brendan O'Friel, chairman of the Prison Governors' Association,
said he had ''a lot of sympathy'' with Mr Lewis. He said his ''departure
will be a considerable shock to the service and with all the problems
and shocks we have had, it will add to the burden we have.
''We have a lot of sympathy with the fact that there is a problem with
running an allegedly semi-independent agency with political
supervision.''
The Lewis sacking, meanwhile, sends a clear warning to all others at
the top of the public service that Ministers in the run-up to a General
Election are not prepared to take the blame for failures in the public
services.

Forsyth views Skye bridge as way to go.
Protest blocks bridge
THE SKYE bridge was under siege this morning, facing its first protest
against the toll charges only hours after its official opening.
Members of the Isle of Skye pipe band, playing Scotland the Brave, led
a convoy of 25 cars onto the bridge at 1am, then refused to pay.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth had earlier opened the bridge,
built by private finance, and said this was how major projects would be
funded in future. He forecast private money would be used in Scotland
for infrastructure projects which could include schools, hospitals,
sewage works and roads.
It was a view the protesters obviously disagreed with. Mr Donald
MacDougall of Ferendonald House, Skye, became the first islander to
refuse to pay the #4.30 toll. Mr MacDougall, a retired forester, said:
''I think the toll is illegal . . . When they discussed tolls when the
bridge was planned, I imagined 40p not a fiver.''
Protest organiser, SNP Councillor Gavin Scott Moncrieff, said he was
delighted with the turnout at the protest.
He made a statement to toll booth staff saying: ''I am asserting my
private and civil right to proceed on a public roadway in the kingdom of
Scotland unhindered. I do not wish to cause an obstruction. Report me if
you must.''
He claimed that under the 1991 Roads and Streets Act people would not
have to pay if they had a good reason to refuse.
Among the protesters was nationalist activist Robbie the Pict, real
name Brian Robertson, who is currently taking the British Government to
the European Court of Human Rights over the Treaty of Union.
Some protesters had their faces daubed in Braveheart blue face paint.
Bridge manager, Mr Russell Thomson, said failure to pay the toll was
actually a criminal offence under the 1991 Act.
''I understand what their concerns are, they have made them quite
plain. But the bridge is here and the debate is now over. People should
look forward to the benefits of the bridge.
The opening of the bridge brought to an end nearly a century of the
Kyle of Lochalsh ferry as Skye's main lifeline to the mainland.
Mr Forsyth had praised the extraordinary achievement of building the
bridge, which he said also highlighted the real potential of the
Government's Private Finance Initiative for the rest of Scotland.
''I think it points the way forward. The Skye bridge was first mooted
in 1938 and I think there were three attempts to deliver it. We
delivered the Skye bridge and we have delivered it by pursuing this
particular avenue of private finance.''
A significant swing in favour of the Government's controversial
Private Finance Initiative is forecast by senior Scottish Office civil
servants as more multi-million pound projects go out to tender before
the new year.
Bidders for at least six more initiatives, worth well over #400m --
including a new Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh and Law Hospital in
Lanarkshire -- are expected to be sought before the year's end.
Mr Forsyth said he knew there was a view that a Skye bridge should
have been paid for out of the public purse. He disagreed. It would have
taken at least another generation before that could happen, he said.
''I know that they want a new school in Portree. I know there are
other priorities in health care elsewhere. If we can finance bridges in
this way, it leaves scarce resources for other important projects.''
Mr Forsyth said that, although the Government would look at individual
projects under the PFI, there were no general plans to extend the toll
principle. On the Skye bridge he was happy to give a categoric guarantee
that the tolls would come off in a maximum of 27 years but perhaps even
as soon as after 14 years.
He criticised ''totally irresponsible'' reports that the bridge was
cracking up, and said it was untrue that he had made panic phone calls
to the bridge's engineers.
The opening ceremony was performed by Mr Forsyth and Steven Campbell,
10, from Ratagan, the winner of a schools competition.
Mr James Miller, chairman of the Miller Group which with German
partners Dywidag built the #25m bridge, said: ''I would like to pay
tribute to the site team who have produced this magnificent bridge.''
Sir Iain Noble, chairman of Skye Bridge Ltd, which will operate the
bridge and who originally opposed the idea, said: ''Now the bridge is
here, let's make the most of it. There has been too much controversy and
we don't want the world to think of Skye as an island of grumblers.''
Meanwhile, generations of Skye people, and others from all over the
Highlands, turned out in their hundreds to say farewell to the two
CalMac 36-car ferries, the Loch Fyne and Loch Dunvegan, dwarfing the
bridge opening. They had been due to make their last sailings to and
from Skye at 3pm, but extra sailings had to be put on, despite the
bridge being free until midnight.
CalMac managing director Mr Colin Paterson said: ''This is a great
tribute to the ferry, which we have been running for a very long time.''
