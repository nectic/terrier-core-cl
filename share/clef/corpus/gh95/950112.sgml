THE Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer were thought likely to stay their hands on the next rise in
interest rates until March or even later after an unexpected fall in
industrial production in November suggested that the pace of activity
slowed down in the fourth quarter.
Minutes of the early morning meeting between the two men on December
7, published yesterday, showed that an upward revision to third quarter
gross domestic product from growth of 0.7% to 0.9% played a key part in
the decision to raise base rates by half a point to 6.25% that day.
In the event GDP growth was subsequently revised down to 0.8%, but
this was mainly because the figure for the second quarter was adjusted
upwards.
City economists were speculating last night that fourth quarter growth
could slow down to 0.6% when the Central Statistical Office makes its
first estimate a week on Monday.
Retail sales were flat in October and November. The figure for
December is due a week today amid mixed reports of the strength of
Christmas trading.
Growth of around 4% last year owed much to an upsurge in industrial
production, driven by the strength of exports.
But in November factory output came off the boil. Industrial
production dropped by a seasonally adjusted 1% and its manufacturing
component by 0.7% against City expectations of increases of 0.3%.
Mild weather hit demand in the electricity, gas, and water sector,
where output fell by 7.6% between October and November.
The manufacturing figures suffered from lower output in the food,
drink, and tobacco and engineering industries.
James Capel's Adam Cole pointed out that production had risen strongly
in the previous two months and that it was always dangerous to read too
much into one month's data.
Any slowdown in the fourth quarter growth rate was likely to be
weather-related in the main. The weakness in retail sales in October and
November was attributable to poor demand for clothing and footwear.
But the Treasury claimed that growth in output was slowing to a more
sustainable rate. Despite the fall in November the trend remained
buoyant.
In the three months to November factory output rose by 0.8% and was 5%
higher than in the same three months a year ago.
Industrial production was even stronger with comparable gains of 1.1%
and 5.4%. This largely reflected growth of 4.4% in oil and gas
extraction in the latest three months and 22.6% from the same three
months a year ago.
The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor, Eddie George, are
due to meet again on February 2, the week before the Bank of England
publishes its quarterly inflation report.
Signs that the economy is coming off the boil may persuade them to
wait before raising interest rates a third time to avert inflationary
pressures building up.
At the December 7 meeting, which was held the morning after the
Government was defeated on increasing the VAT rate on domestic power,
the Chancellor and the Governor debated the timing of the subsequent
rise in rates, but decided to go ahead immediately. Delay would would
have left the expectation of a rise hanging over the the economy and the
markets.
Mr George said: ''In the present climate that would add to the
uncertainty and could be dangerous.''
Mr Clarke wasted little time in agreeing to the Governor's
recommendation of an immediate increase to enable the authorities to act
in good time and to reduce market uncertainties.
But the detailed minutes suggested that the decision was not as clear
cut as had been thought at the time.
The Governor conceded that there was a dichotomy between ''the buoyant
manufacturing sector -- especially those businesses that were
particularly involved in exports -- and the more cautious personal
sector.''
He noted that the growth of domestic demand had fallen in each of the
previous three quarters and that consumer spending had moderated to an
annualised rate of 2%.

800 sets of innovative goalposts for youngsters' seven-a-side games
have been ordered by the SFA -- just one, reports David Steele, of a
number of successes for a small but versatile Ayrshire engineering
company
IF a broad and varied customer base is an indicator of success, then a
small Ayrshire engineering company has cause for celebration.
RBC Precision, based in Troon, provides parts for the Jetstream
Aircraft plant at nearby Prestwick, serves the computer industry, and is
involved in classified work for the Ministry of Defence.
Most recently the company persuaded the Scottish Football Association
to prise open the famous purse and buy more than 800 sets of innovative
goalposts designed for use by young footballers in outdoor seven-a-side
games.
The company was formed by Marilyn Cairns and husband Robert, managing
and technical director respectively, in 1981 and in its first year
turned over #24,000.
Turnover will exceed #1m this year and a business plan currently
nearing completion predicts a doubling of the present workforce of 34
within five years, growth of about 20%, and a move to bigger premises,
bringing the three current units under one roof.
These premises will be as near as possible to the present site as
Marilyn Cairns is committed to the local workforce and to the
opportunities presented by the recently formed Engineering Ayrshire
partnership which embraces more than 40 engineering and electronics
sub-contractors.
''Engineering Ayrshire is helping to break down barriers which
traditionally existed in our business,'' she says.
''I have never been one who stood in the way of a competitor. If we
cannot cope with something then it gets passed on to somone who can.
That attitude will eventually pay off and fortunately it is one which is
spreading.''
RBC concentrates on quality in its wide range of services, and holds
quality approvals ranging from BS 5750 through BACA to the rigorous
standards set by British Aerospace through its Jetstream subsidiary.
Two years ago the company added design and development to the
specialised range of manufacturing services and this has led to the
goalpost project and to a new range of angling nets which should be on
the market within weeks.
''We are not interested in becoming involved in the marketing and
selling of these products, but are happy to carry out a wide range of
services for large blue-chip companies and let them do the rest,'' adds
Mrs Cairns.
''I believe it has been our emphasis on quality, as well as the
flexibility of the operation and the workforce, which has made us
attractive to a wide range of customers.''
RBC now has a technical sales manager based in Leicester ready to deal
quickly with major customers in the Midlands, which is seen by many
involved in the Engineering Ayrshire innovation as being its single most
important marketplace.
In Scotland the range of customers continues to grow and includes ICI
at Ardeer, Compaq, IBM, and Fullarton Computer Industries. The MoD
remains an important customer but details of the work in which RBC is
involved remain sketchy for security reasons.
Says Mrs Cairns: ''We have made something of a name for ourselves for
expertise in materials which other people have found tricky. It is
finding that kind of niche which is so important in an increasingly
competitive environment.''
And those goalposts? ''We were delighted to become involved in a
project which has had such a high profile and which will bring such a
lot of pleasure to young people.
''There have been some awful accidents down the years involving
traditional goalposts, so we set out to make something safe.
''Four things were of paramount importance -- ease of assembly,
lightness of material, stability, and rigidity -- and we designed a
unique section of oval extruded aluminium which is light and
cost-effective.
''We are particularly proud because the corner castings came from
Johnstone Castings in Dalry, the packaging from Adcraft in Kilmarnock,
and the nets from a third Ayrshire firm. It is a real example of
Engineering Ayrshire in action.''
More than 800 sets of the goalposts have been ordered by the SFA for
distribution throughout Scotland, and the company is hopeful of further
orders.
Marilyn Cairns deals diplomatically with the subject of being a woman
in what is perceived by the uneducated as the man's world of
engineering. ''I have some fun with people who ask if they shouldn't be
dealing with the boss when they are put through to me,'' she says.
''I ask what they want to speak to the boss about, listen patiently,
and then tell them I don't really think the boss would be interested . .
.
''Seriously, once people get to know me and find they are dealing with
someone who knows the business, there is never a problem. Why should
there be?''

THE sixth year in which I have been managing a small portfolio of
investments for my friend Ludovic Ranfurly has just ended. Strictly
speaking it should have ended last week but because the valuations, made
by Tilney his stockbrokers, are quarterly they are for the year end
December 31 1994.
Tilney also do the various sums but are not responsible for the stock
selection, sales, or purchases, though they execute them.
Ludovic started with #17,000 from a maturing insurance policy. He now
has #40,667 in shares and a further #2774 in cash, a total of #43,441.
The last annual valuation gave him #44,049 in investments and cash of
#2516, a total of #46,565. The shares have therefore fallen by 11.28%
over the year which compares with a drop of 10.32% in the 100-share
Index (the Footsie) and 10.09% in the All-share Index.
Not too much significance should be read into these figures but Ludo's
experience suffered from the cost of the transactions at the very start
of the year when he sold slices of three of his holdings and bought two
new ones. As I have said before, the indices pay no transaction costs
(brokers' fees and stamp duty) -- a reason they are so hard to beat!
It has, therefore been a mildly disappointing year; certainly it was a
very volatile year in the markets. I should say right away that
investors need to cultivate patience and accept some downs as well as
ups, provided they are not gambling, as the longer-term trend is firmly
upwards.
He has broadened his portfolio and to that extent has reduced the
element of risk inherent in all investment activity (and not absent from
bonds, incidentally: it was a poor year for bondholders). When Ludo
started he had only five stocks and was building up the investment trust
at #100 a month. He now has holdings in eight different companies
(including the investment trust) and one Index Linked bond as well as a
cash holding.
The cash will enable him to consider buying shares in the English
power generators the Government is hoping to sell later this year. It
will also allow the start of another investment trust buying programme.
The shares he now holds are without exception in very large and well
regarded companies -- blue chips. I like to think that this portfolio
gives no sleepless nights but I did get a bit of a shock (sic!) from the
performance of ScottishPower, a reminder that the utlities are not
immune from the unexpected.
At one stage I almost switched to Hydro since it looked even more
undervalued (and such a move would have justified itself financially)
but then I felt that was incompatible with my minimal interventionist
approach. I still think ScottishPower looks sound and should be able to
increase its dividends regularly.
During the quarter Ludo paid out #864, the last instalment for the
shares in BT3, the Government's third offering of the telecommunications
giant it used to own completely. He took in #184 in dividends. His cash
balance is after these movements.
No credit is taken for the interest these balances would earn in their
account with the Abbey National, and no allowance is made for the way in
which they would enhance his portfolio's performance in such markets as
obtained last year. He does, therefore, a little better in reality than
my figures would suggest.
His income for the year came to #1206 (a small earlier error in the
amount paid by the Royal Bank of Scotland in February has been corrected
to his advantage). This is after paying the first tranche of income tax
which is deducted at source as a tax credit.
Being a higher-rate taxpayer, he then pays the same amount again but I
make no provision for that in these sums, and the same system would
obtain if all his investment income came from deposits. On income he is
already close to beating the net return he would have received from a
bank or building society deposit account and he has massively beaten it
on capital.
It is the capital account which matters at this stage. This portfolio
is being built up for Ludo's wife, Jilly, and income is not important
now; indeed it is all ploughed back, a fact which makes his performance
better than it would be if the income were being spent.
Of the stocks held there is not room to say much except that I feel
Royal Bank of Scotland has been oversold and BT still looked cheap at
the year-end. (There is a two-way pull between the competing bulls and
bears of this stock, and not everyone shares my optimism as to its
prospects.)
Bat has done some clever work in the American cigarette market, and
growth there should compensate for various pressures on the
profitability of its insurance operations on both sides of the Atlantic.
Zenaca is also justifying the decision to hold it after the division
of ICI, and Foreign and Colonial still retains its fundamental
attractions, despite looking dear: its management will have to work
wonders to keep its momentum up in spite of its bulk. So far it seems to
be managing.
BP is recovering its health quite fast and dividends are rising again.
Its ability to find oil remains unimpaired, and oil itself looks cheap:
BP is a direct beneficiary of any rise in the price which, even in the
medium term, seems inevitable.
The supermarket wars go on and have already claimed not a giant but an
aggressive small fish, Shoprite. Sainsbury, even so, was a poorly timed
purchase, though I felt its price had come down enough from its peak to
be a safe enough buy. It has been fighting well, and doing well abroad,
and should eventually justify itself. It represents a degree of
insurance against any return to inflation.
Insurance, too, applies to the Index Linked stock which is tied , both
in capital and interest payments, to the Retail Price Index movement on
top of its underlying 2.5% yield.

JUST over six years ago an old friend, Ludovic Ranfurly, told me over
dinner that an insurance policy taken out a quarter of a century earlier
as part of a mortgage deal was about to mature. It had required a very
modest premium and, having moved several times in the interim, he had
forgotten it. He wondered if I would manage the #17,000 involved for a
fee.
I suggested instead that I manage the money in public, reporting every
quarter. This way some general good might be done in showing fellow
Scots how they might derive profit and pleasure from managing their own
savings.
It needs courage to buy investments, but the rewards from prudence and
diversification are likely to be gratifying. The benefits of running a
small portfolio with little actual trading of securities are not to be
despised: saving on the expensive brokerage charges, not to mention
stamp duty, can be significant.
Comparison with indices is misleading for various reasons but if he
did noticeably worse than the indices it would be a sign that the
strategy and tactics alike were wrong. As it is he is doing acceptably,
if not spectacularly, well.
He ploughs back all the cash generated. The ultimate beneficiary is to
be his younger wife, Dervorguilla, whom he married late in life where
his style was previously characterised by spending rather than saving.
Were he to die prematurely, her pension would be actuarially adjusted
downwards. This little fund will make a contribution to compensating for
that.

PEDIGREE beef bull breeders were urged to pool resources with
scientists to develop customised animals for specific markets on the
opening day of the British Cattle Breeders Club annual conference at
Cambridge yesterday.
This sector was furthest from the end consumer, and suffered from
mixed market signals in meeting the specific needs of market segments
such as traditional butcher, supermarket, caterer, or exporter.
In a joint paper, Drs Peter Hamer and Geoff Simm of the Scottish
Agricultural College, Edinburgh, said this meant insufficient rewards
being fed back through the beef chain to encourage appropriate genetic
improvements in the calf breeding programmes.
This limit had been recognised in other countries such as North
America, New Zealand, and Australia, and counter measures applied. For
example, in North America, more suckler herd managers were contracting
their calves through feedlots, while retaining ownership. This ensured
more direct market signals and premiums for specific traits.
A more extreme example of this occurred where supermarket chains
applied vertical integration, and took control of the entire beef
production chain from calf to retail.
A more benign approach had been adopted in Australia, where a computer
software package had been developed to help breeders assess their own
customised breeding goals in relation to market demands. Similar
developments were underway in New Zealand.
Breeding aids such as best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), and
estimated breeding value (EBV), were useful tools in developing breeding
strategies. But they had to be used with caution, and with more
long-term aims in mind.
Further refinements of these systems were being developed, and these
should provide opportunities for innovative breeders to explore new
marketing options which provided better rewards for specific traits.
''Perhaps a future step for scientific involvement in the beef
breeding industry will be the development and implementation of a
service which assists individual breeders or breeder groups in
developing selection goals and criteria customised to specific needs,''
the authors concluded.

THE British livestock industry must stand united and be prepared to
put hard cash up front against the animal welfare lobby which seeks to
bring a halt to the live export trade, urged to John Forley,
secretary-general of the National Sheep Association.
Speaking yesterday at the North-west of England Sheep Fair in Penrith,
Mr Forley said: ''If we allow this ban to stick, don't imagine that will
be the end of the matter. The animal rights lobby will choose for its
next scrap markets and the abattoirs. Do not underestimate them.''
Mr Forley continued: ''We must draw a line in the sand and stand firm
behind it. Thus far, and no further. The present battle may largely
feature calves, but it's every bit as important for the sheep trade.
''Just think what will happen if the half million calves which are
exported have to stay in this country. We'll put them in yards and
produce second rate beef. People might buy it once, but then it will
push the price of real beef down which, in turn, will hit the sheep
trade. The whole business is bound up together, and I can honestly say
that this is the most worrying time for the livestock industry I can
ever remember.''
Asked what farmers could do to counter the current situation, Mr
Forley responded: ''There is a lamentable lack of understanding on the
part of the general public towards farming. We've really got to get the
message over, and I think there is a place for the MLC to use levy
money, and very possibly raise an extra levy for this specific purpose.
We have left it far too long in tackling the terrifying
misconceptions.''
David Croston, of MLC, supported that notion. ''We are looking at
this, and it's likely that our next move after our recipe for love meat
promotion campaign will be in that direction.''
Referring specifically to the disruption of exports at Shoreham, Mr
Forley rounded on ''the lunatic fringe'' saying: ''I don't think people
realise just how much damage has been done. Seven lorries were put out
of action -- and I'm not just talking about a few broken windscreens.
It's going to take up to #10,000 to put these trucks back on the road.''
In all probability according to MLC, there will in any event be a
massive reduction in live exports of sheep this year to the Continent.
It is suggested that last year's figure of 1.8 million head could fall
as far as 800,000. Meanwhile, it also emerged that sheep farmers all
over the UK have kept an extra 100,000 ewe hoggs so that they can claim
Sheep Annual Premium on them, provided they are on the farm until the
end of the retention period in March.
According to MLC, these sheep which are not intended for breeding will
then be dumped on the market, depressing prices. However, more
importantly is the fact that these extra sheep will dilute the overall
payment of SAP for genuine sheep farmers. Discussions are to take place
with the Ministry of Agriculture to see if this practice can be halted.

THE next big battle in Brussels for the farming industry could be over
any attempt to introduce a cut-off level beyond which individual farmers
would no longer qualify for financial support under the Common
Agricultural Policy, Mr Donald MacRae, senior manager of agricultural
services at the Trustee Savings Bank Scotland, forecast yesterday.
Mr MacRae took the view that it would be impossible to apply the CAP
in its present form to Eastern European countries like Poland, leaving
the Commission looking for ways of re-directing financial support to the
industry.
The future could lie in a two-tier system of farming, with smaller
farmers dependent on subsidies, and the larger players opting to make
their profits through economies of scale.
Another powerful squeeze on farming income was also in prospect, as
the major food retailers deployed their market power in the latest
rounds of the food price war, he said.
Despite the possibility of such problems ahead, Mr MacRae's message
for the coming year was: ''Enjoy the high level of support while it
lasts, and expand the farm business for long-term viability. Replace
machinery if required, chase productivity gains, and plan for a future
with lower levels of support than now.''
Politicians and policies might change, he said, but there would always
be opportunities for efficient farmers.
There would not be a New Zealand scenario in Scotland, with subsidies
being totally withdrawn -- but it could be that financial help would be
targeted differently, with payments made for environmental or social
reasons taken out of the agricultural equation. However, he felt
small-scale farming, and particularly hill farming, would continue to be
generously supported.
''Opportunities for Scottish farmers do exist,'' he said. ''Much
progress has been made along the lines of quality assurance. Nothing
else but full-hearted support for the proposed Scottish food quality
mark is essential for the future success of Scottish farming. The drive
to apply new methods and technology must be maintained.
''Welfare issues, while sometimes viewed as a threat, should be seen
as an opportunity to gain a competitive edge. We have to monitor public
attitudes on welfare,'' he suggested. ''Public perceptions are often
more important than scientific fact.''
On the financial front, Mr MacRae saw the Scottish farming industry as
profitable, only moderately borrowed, and asset rich. He warned,
however, that some of the asset strength was based on the quota system
of production controls.
Such controls solved short-term problems, but in the long term they
were fundamentally anti-competitive, and prevented the entry of younger
farmers into the industry. ''This may be an unpleasant truth for farming
politicians, but has to be faced for the good of the industry,'' he
said.

Cheap labour and low production costs make Asia a target for the car
giants -- but meanwhile traffic snarls and pollution saw Malaysia,
Singapore, and Indonesia spend last summer enveloped in thick smog
From SHARON SINGLETON
Hong Kong, Wednesday
ASIA'S booming economies are a carmakers' dream, but with traffic jams
and chronic air pollution that dream has collided head-on with an
environmental nightmare.
Asia's major cities are reaching crisis point as traffic congestion
becomes the number one priority for governments grappling with the
dilemma of rapidly developing economies outpacing infrastructure
development.
But for car manufacturers, whose domestic economies are only now
struggling out of recession, the new-found spending power in a region
with more than half the world's population is too good an opportunity to
miss.
General Motors, Mercedes Benz, Toyota, and Honda are some of the big
names looking to take advantage of cheap labour and low production costs
by setting up manufacturing bases in Asia.
While governments are eager for the investment, the legendary traffic
snarls and pollution -- so bad that Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia
spent much of last summer enveloped in thick smog -- have forced an
urgent rethink.
In Bangkok, where the traffic and pollution problems are the region's
worst, new car and motorbike sales are growing at 13% annually compared
with just 1% growth in new roads.
The sales are booming despite a 257% tax on imported vehicles with
engines bigger than 3000cc.
In a belated effort to tackle the problem, the government is
introducing 210 vehicle testing centres to eliminate defective vehicles,
but any strict enforcement of emission levels is thought to be unlikely.
Work has also begun on an elevated rail system for the Thai capital
after years of wrangling, and a new motorway to the airport is expected
to help the problem.
But most observers agree things are likely to continue to get worse
for the near future.
Indonesia, where traffic problems are rapidly approaching the scale of
Bangkok, is enjoying an unprecedented car sales boom and is actively
wooing investment in the sector.
Car sales are expected to have hit 300,000 in 1994 against 215,000 in
1993, with September sales hitting a two-year high.
Jakarta's traffic congestion was highlighted late last year when it
hosted the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec)
forum. Indonesians were given a two-day holiday to help clear the
capital's streets and allow the motorcades of world leaders to pass
unobstructed.
Nonetheless, General Motors of the United States has set up a joint
venture to assemble Opel cars. It hopes to sell 5500 in 1995.
Mercedes-Benz began making its first Asian-built small truck in Jakarta
last June.
The story is the same in India, where an economic reform programme has
opened up the closed car sector to foreign investment, triggering a rush
to capture a share of one of the world's biggest potential markets.
Carmakers such as General Motors, Suzuki, Peugeot, Rover, and Mercedes
Benz have recently signed joint venture agreements in India but will be
churning cars on to chaotic, hopelessly overcrowded roads.
India has 25 million vehicles, which will grow to 32 million in 1996
and 49 million in 2001. But this does not take into account the
bicycles, bullock carts, and other conveyances that clutter the streets.
The first concrete effort to reduce pollution will be the introduction
of unleaded petrol by April 1, 1996. A recent attempt to ensure all cars
had ''pollution under control'' stickers glued to their windshields fell
by the wayside after a few months because there was no-one to enforce
the rule.
The Hong Kong government is examining an electronic road-toll system
similar to one used in the Norwegian capital Oslo to combat a growing
traffic problem that has slowed cars heading for the harbour tunnels
linking Hong Kong island to Kowloon peninsula to just 6mph -- slower
than a bicycle.
The government has also proposed a stiff increase in the tax on new
cars to 70% of their total value, from a current 40-60%. Annual licence
fees would rise 40%.
Just 13% of households own a car in Hong Kong, but there is one
vehicle for each 12ft of road space. Private vehicles are growing at a
rate of 10% a year.
In the Philippines, where cars sales have grown an average 30% over
the past two years, Manila officials are planning to enforce travel
restrictions on main thoroughfares in peak hours.
The officials are also considering a pooling system that would ban
cars from the main highways unless they are carrying four passengers.
Only Singapore has managed to escape the Asian traffic nightmare,
introducing draconian measures to combat pollution and congestion.
To help traffic flow smoothly, the government has spent $1bn to build
and upgrade roads in the past five years and plans to spend a similar
amount over the next five years.
Singapore also has a car quota system that makes it one of the most
expensive and difficult places to buy a car.

A MAJOR industrial development on the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone is
to be carried out by Wilson (UK) Developments Ltd. Monklands District
Council selected the developer for the site at East Shawhead which will
comprise seven industrial units totalling 85,000 sq ft.
Each unit will include fitted office accommodation and dedicated car
parking and loading facilities. The units will range in size from 7500
sq ft to 20,000 sq ft.
Councillor Hugh Lucas, convener of planning and development at
Monklands District Council, said: ''Wilson (UK) Developments has
extensive experience of Enterprise Zone development projects throughout
the United Kingdom.
''In selecting a developer for East Shawhead the council was keen to
secure a high-quality development and one which was complementary to
other projects currently under way or planned for the Enterprise Zone.
''We are confident that the development will be of great assistance in
our aim of attracting new jobs to this area.''
Rod Brown, managing director of Wilson (UK) Developments Ltd, said:
''I am particularly pleased to have secured a development at East
Shawhead. It is ideally located, less than half a mile from a four-way
junction on the A8/M8, and I can envisage the units being of interest to
a wide range of industrial and warehouse occupiers, particularly given
that an occupier will pay no rates until 2003.''
As advisers to Monklands District Council, Bell Ingram will continue
its involvement during the letting process. Richard Ellis and Gallagher
MacLachlan will advise Wilson (UK) Developments Ltd throughout the
development and letting process.
Completion is scheduled for November 1995.

A FLURRY of letting activity at Falkirk's Callendar Business Park has
brought occupancy up to well over 90%. The new deals at the development
have achieved rental levels of #10.50 per sq ft.
Prudential Assurance Co Ltd has taken a lease of Unit 4 of M J Gleeson
Group's courtyard development. The unit consists of approximately 4500
sq ft and comes with 18 car spaces. The lease is for a period of 15
years on full repairing and insuring terms.
Co-operative Insurance Society has leased the first floor of Unit 10,
extending to 2400 sq ft and nine car spaces. The full repairing and
insuring lease was agreed for a period of 10 years at a starting rental
of #10.50 per sq ft.
Security expert Sensormatic Camera has relocated from Denny into the
mixed-use park, also on a 15-year lease.
Douglas Patrick, associate director of James Barr &amp; Son, said: ''This
new blood in the Park is encouraging for the local economy and marks the
shape of things to come in the following few months.
''Callendar Park is now well on the way to full occupancy as several
more leases are currently being negotiated, and there continues to be
active interest in the business park from companies looking for a
central location. We are hoping that early 1995 will see a full
complement of tenants taking up residence.''
When deals under offer are taken into account the park is now 96% let,
proving a strong demand for well-located business space outwith Glasgow
and Edinburgh. Joint agents are Ryden and James Barr &amp; Son.

Save.
W &amp; J Burness acted for Shoprite in Scotland, handling the sale of
more than 100 retail outlets and two distribution depots at Dunfermline
and Cambuslang. There are a further 15 retail outlets in England.
The total value of the sale was in the region of #45m, net of stock

David Reid, chairman of W &amp; J Burness, said: ''This has been among
Scotland's biggest commercial property disposals this year. Dealing with
so many properties at the one time has required organisational as well
as legal skills. It has been a delicate and complex transaction
involving a team from our Edinburgh and Glasgow offices.''

ONCE upon a time, female folk musicians were wispy creatures, all
pre-Raphaelite, Laura Ashley and dimpled smiles. It's a different story
nowadays, as evinced by the current Celtic Connections festival in
Glasgow which proves that most female folkies have dumped the romantic
image for raunchy attitude.
But in the further-flung outposts of this island, old habits die hard
and the Mary O'Hara legacy is alive and kicking in the Isle of Man, via
the stage persona of Emma Christian, a 22-year-old who plays clarsach,
or Celtic harp, and the treble recorder -- and is regarded as the
premier exponent of traditional Manx music.
While harp duo Phileas, part of all-women Scots collective The
Poozies, might shimmy on stage in short skirts and psychedelic tartan
sannies, Christian favours flowing tresses and flouncy dresses. It's a
deliberately-contrived image which has been further cultivated by her
inclination to play only castles, cathedrals and churches, a fact
stressed by her fax-happy manager Steve Coren who has been promoting his
young client with tremendous zeal.
''Emma usually performs in these venues around about dusk,'' he says.
''Her album is called Beneath the Twilight and her tours are always
called that too.'' Why? ''Well, it sort of symbolises the way
traditional Manx music has been in the twilight . . . only Emma is now
bringing it into the limelight.''
Limelight, but not spotlight. Another gimmick of the Christian image
is that she always performs amidst the soft-focus glow of candelight.
However, strict fire regulations have ruled this out for her Royal
Concert Hall appearances, where dimmed lighting will have to create the
usual dusky atmosphere. She'll still be surrounded by candles but
there'll be no flame in her fire.
* AS innocent as O J Simpson when it comes to puns and smutty
innuendo, the Arts Diary always failed to see what all the hilarity was
about when the office rang with peals of laughter over the title of an
April lecture for the Glasgow Astronomical Society, ''The Joy of the
Telescope.'' We simply had to shake our head sadly when a colleague
suggested a further sally considered suitable for a gathering of
opticians: The Joy of Specs.
* THE forthcoming departure of the formidable Elizabeth Esteve-Coll as
director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has prompted the
usual gossip-mongering about a likely successor.
Yet again, Julian Spalding's name has been murmured, but it is
unlikely that Spalding will make a bid for the post. Having previously
reached the final four for both the Barbican and the Tate directorships,
but scooping neither, Spalding apparently suspects he is not in favour
in arty denizons down south, which is an ironic fact as the opposite
perception holds sway in Scotland.
* THE Arts Diary regards itself as a cultural cat but was happy to
turn watchdog in response to phonecalls from concerned readers, who had
attended the Glasgow Philarmonic's Glasgow Greets Vienna concert at the
Royal Concert Hall on New Year's Day and were suspicious of the prize
draw organised by Glasgow's Trades House in aid of Action Research.
As with last year's Viennese concert, the prize was two tickets to
Vienna donated by Austrian Airlines going to whoever had bought a
winning programme -- which had a Trades House symbol in the middle
pages. Audience members thought they had smelt a rat when conductor Iain
Sutherland announced ''the lady'' who had won the tickets had not come
forward to claim her prize. How did he know the winner's gender in
advance, Herald readers demanded.
A spokesman for the freelance orchestra was quick to allay fears of a
fix, pointing out that the winner had made herself known to
front-of-house staff earlier when she had spotted the symbol on her
programme but had failed to make her way backstage for an onstage
presentation. Maybe she didn't want her identity revealed -- no doubt
for entirely innocent reasons?
George Wylie, chief executive of the Trades House and a national
committee member of Action Research, was stunned at the suspicions
voiced. ''The lady concerned had a case of stage fright,'' he insists.
''I think anyone who has complained is showing a very uncharitable lack
of understanding for someone who felt shy.''

A Huntly construction company is set to help South Africa meet its
housing challenge, as Maggie Totterdell reports.
Above, demonstrating that a prefabricated house -- hinged, quickly
erected, and easily transportable -- can be erected in minutes,
especially when a VIP (below) is there to watch.
WHAT connects a small town in North-east Scotland with Canary Wharf,
North Sea oil exploration, and black South African townships such as
Soweto? If Forbes Shand is successful in his endeavours the answer will
be: Huntly-based construction company R B Farquhar.
Shand, who is managing director of the company, has recently returned
from a trade mission to South Africa organised by the Scottish Council
for Development and Industry. The fact-finding mission turned up a few
surprises.
Last year he was approached by a South African engineering company
which had an idea for a prefabricated house -- hinged, quickly erected,
and easily transportable. It could, it thought, provide the answer to
its country's great housing shortage.
Lacking the expertise and experience to develop and build it, it was
soon referred to the Huntly firm.
Farquhar is well known for its prefabricated modular accommodation of
all types. It supplies fitted rooms to hotels and student residences,
and fully fitted wards to hospitals. In the past it has done work as
diverse as refurbishing accommodation modules for the Forties Field and
installing high-quality washrooms in Canary Wharf in London.
As was demonstrated to Prince Charles when he visited Huntly at the
end of last September, the quick-build houses can be erected in a matter
of minutes. To Mr Shand's surprise, however, the speed of the
construction was viewed as a disadvantage in South Africa.
Although there is a chronic housing shortage, the unemployment
situation is also a major headache for the new administration. It would
like to try to solve both of these problems in one, by building
traditional houses which would also provide fairly long-term employment.
The South African government can afford to allocate only 12,500 rand
(about #2500) per family per house. With a serviced site costing 7500
rand, this leaves a shortfall of about 5-7000 rand per house.
The quick-build houses are made of insulated steel panels. Although
they can be clad with brick at a later date, this would obviously push
the price up even further.
Despite this, the people are demanding brick houses. Election rhetoric
by the ANC gave a hostage to fortune. The newly-enfranchised black
voters were promised brick European-style houses -- just like the
whites'.
Despite the problems, Forbes Shand is confident he has a product which
is right for the market. It is, he says, a matter of maintaining his
contacts and biding his time. Later this month a two-man delegation from
Durban is coming to Huntly.
Attitudes in the state of Natal are somewhat different. Keen to
develop tourism in their spectacular scenery, the authorities there want
to get rid of their many squatter camps. The Durban company is confident
of being able to give Farquhar an order for the 1000 houses by the
summer.
Once production is up and running, the Huntly factory will be able to
produce 200 units a week. With an estimated 300,000 new houses needed in
the Transvaal alone, Mr Shand hopes the administration there will follow
Natal's lead and realise that it is better to have bread today than jam
tomorrow.
The quick-build houses are designed to be permanent. Once erected,
they could get their brick cladding in five, six, or 10 years' time,
thus giving the people their coveted European-style housing.
He found his week-long stay invaluable in giving him a real insight
into the particular problems of housing in South Africa. He was also
pleasantly surprised to find himself dealing with lots of first and
second-generation Scots, many of whom had emigrated during the 1960s.
''It might not guarantee an order,'' he says, ''but it certainly gives
you a talking point.''

Do we really need all those ernest mission statements? Has the image
industry gone over the top? Steve McGrailis underwhelmed.
THE Royal Bank of Scotland is Where People Matter; the South-East
Essex College of Arts and Technology (fortunately) is Taking Your Future
Seriously.
Meanwhile, Smith Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals are heroically
Challenging the Natural Limits; yet more ambitiously, Kwik Fit proclaims
its aim as 100% Customer Delight.
On the more earnest end of the spectrum, the Mines Advisory Group is
Returning Mined Lands to the Community, as the Leonard Cheshire
Foundation worthily lumbers its way through Offering Choice and
Opportunity to People with Disabilities.
We are in the realms of the Corporate Image Makers whose slogans and
logos, from the self-evident or just plain silly to the fatally
hubris-ridden now grace Welcome Facilities in NHS hospitals, recruitment
advertisements, and company literature glossy enough to damage retinas
at 50 paces.
Even the police, it seems, cannot hold a press conference without a
logo draped somewhere; not one saying anything interesting, you
understand, like Seeing Chummy Bang To Rights, just something along the
lines of Nottinghamshire Constabulary's Serving The Community.
Out there, if you would believe the Image Industry, are hordes of
organisations lovingly Caring For You and assiduously Helping To Make
Things Better, all desperate to Do Good.
It seems an embarass de richesses, albeit often belied by the seedy
reality of some of the actual products and services on offer. A
jaundiced Thoreau once warned that ''if you see a person coming towards
you with the express intention of doing you good, run for your life''.
That is sound advice, in this game.
The slogans are short versions of the equally omnipresent Mission
Statements (Our Pledge Is Not To Amputate The Wrong Limb, etc). Their
language is as cozening, portentous, folksy, and inspirational as their
content is vapid, tendentious, and pointless.
Why, for example, does the State Hospital have to inform us that it
represents Care In Safe Hands? Are we so stupid as to have entrusted the
dangerously disturbed to a feckless clique which will release them on a
whim, having first provided money and laid on transport?
There are assumptions at work here. One is clearly that the public is
pretty dim and needs constant reassurance. The second says more about
the organisations being described.
Take the common and apparently innocuous Working for the Community as
an instance. In reality, this can convey a certain reproach. The
implication is that before the outfit in question was dragged panting
and blinking into the cold light of reality (usually The Market), it was
self-serving, idle, and remote.
''See,'' hisses the slogan, ''we're working for you now -- although
that lot in the past were doing anything but''. The cheery little
communications, in other words, are sometimes tinged with hidden
complaint and menace.
The plethora of statements -- generally just comprising a present
participle and personal pronoun phrase -- are everywhere. This should
surprise nobody, given their recent origins. Slogans there have always
been, but their sudden flowering in the 1980s makes for suspicion.
They mirror the rise of spin doctors, Suits flourishing Action Plans,
media consultants, routine fat-cattery and services and institutions
being ''restructured'', frequently at the cost of 50% of the workforce.
If they were even half-honest about this they would declare something
like Being Down-Sized For You, or Working Like **** Minus Most Of The
Staff. The workers have always produced such variants for themselves.
Ringing declarations are invariably subverted; even the SAS soon
changed its Who Dares Wins motto to Who Cares Who Wins. But the point of
image-making is not to be honest: did not Harold Wilson, in rather more
innocent times, call Public Relations organised lying?)
If we must have corporate pronouncements at all, we should get back to
the traditional kind. In this, Scotland can surely show the way.
OUT should go all the Carings and Sharings and IN should come the more
robust sentiments of the old school.
Clan mottos make an excellent starting point. You know where you are
if you meet an edgy-looking Robertson with a badge on his bonnet
announcing Fierce When Roused.
Getting a MacNeill or a MacDougall to handle sensitive negotiations in
your group is obviously unwise, too, given their enthusiasm for Victory
or Death; and if your local Hospital Trust is run by a gang of
MacDonalds, you can forget about challenging any of its activities --
since the Clan's favoured motto is Gainsay Who Dare.
Failing that, we might decide to stop using logos and slogans anyway.
It would make a good New Year Resolution for 1995. At a stroke, 1000
Presentation Advisers could be cast into outer darkness, organisations
could get on with doing what they have always done more or less (but
minus expensive apologetics) -- and the poor little present participle
could be restored once more to its honourable and unspectacular place in
the English language.
We're Praying For A Change, OK?

IN an unusual survey commissioned by Greenleaf Editorial, a
Glasgow-based PR consultancy, the spotlight has been turned on
journalists with 30 of Scotland's top commissioning editors being
questioned about their views on the Scottish PR industry.
The results of the survey, which was conducted by Scotinform, will
please the independent PR agencies but may result in a few red faces at
in-house and public sector PR departments because the journalists rated
the independents top of the heap with the public sector bodies trailing
at the bottom of the league.
Journalists from all sectors of the media including press, TV, and
radio said the independent agencies were more effective at generating
news and dealing with press inquiries. In-house PR people were seen as
being too concerned with their companies' own interests but the public
sector bodies came in for some severe criticism with almost 50% of the
journalists rating the output and response from this sector as being of
poor quality.
Simon Berry of Greenleaf Editorial said : ''According to the
journalists, the independent PR companies can be reasonably pleased with
their performance but the public sector bodies need to smarten up their
act.''
The journalists interviewed said that while the general standard of
press releases had improved, many were still too woolly and badly
targetted. Despite this, the survey reveals that almost 30% of stories
and features in the Scottish press and broadcast media emanated from
press releases. Copies of the report priced #99, are available from
Greenleaf Editorial on 041 332 2995.

How do you run a service where the demands are unpredictable and you
are reliant on goodwill for supplies? Douglas Crawford investigates.
NOT only does the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service keep
going during holiday seasons but it is often busier than usual, trying
to get supplies from a population with its mind on other things.
SNBTS general manager David McIntosh and his Edinburgh headquarters
staff have to match supply with demand. How best can he run a
#27m-a-year lifesaving business when it is faced with totally
unpredictable and sometimes daunting requirements? One woman who
recently had her liver injured in a road accident needed 56 pints of
blood. And heart-transplant operations need the availability of about 10
pints.
The SNBTS is also faced with an equally totally unpredictable supply.
The input of no other business is so completely based upon altruism. In
every other business the laws of supply and demand are governed by
market forces. The input into the SNBTS, on the other hand, is grounded
in the good-heartedness of the donors.
And it is thanks to them that the target of a daily input of 1000
pints is achieved in Scotland.
The challenge here is to continue to deserve the support of blood
donors. ''They don't need us, but we most certainly need them,'' says
McIntosh. ''At the same time, one must not lose touch with the basic
humanitarianism of the job.''
Scotland is one of the few countries which have a sufficient number --
6% of the population -- of blood donors. The latest year for which
statistics are available reported more than 318,000 donor attendances
and 15,000 ''acute'' beds served.
At the same time, the country needs 50,000 new donors every year. A
donor can give blood two or three times a year after reaching the age of
17 but few donations are accepted from people over 65: hence the
constant need for new members of the public to come forward.
Why do people give blood? One reason is the ''there but for the grace
of God'' factor: another is that it is a community thing and this is why
the SNBTS's operations are split into five regions -- the North of
Scotland, Aberdeen and the North-east, the East of Scotland, Edinburgh
and South-east of Scotland, and Glasgow and West of Scotland.
All of these regions are virtually self-sufficient in terms of blood
availability and they service 70 peripheral blood banks. One of the
problems here is to achieve a regular flow of donations. Christmas, New
Year, and summer holiday periods are low as far as the number of
donations is concerned so the SNBTS constantly strives to ''iron out''
these wobbles in the supply.
Blood is a complex substance. It contains many life-saving ingredients
and one pint gives a lot of treatment to a lot of people.
The processing of plasma is carried out at the National Fractionation
Centre in Edinburgh. This work produces many more life-saving substances
such as clotting factors for the treatment of haemophilia and for use in
surgery; albumin (used in treatment of burns, for people who have
suffered major blood loss, and for patients with kidney problems);
antibody products; and normal immunoglobulins, used in the treatment of
immune disorders and for people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, for
the prevention of rhesus diseases (during childbirth), and for the
prevention of infection.
The SNBTS is a large concern, employing 1300 people throughout the
country. It is a body whose work, by its very nature, never stops.
It is also an organisation which has to beware of the army of
(predominantly US-based) commercial fractionators which would like to do
away with non-commercial bodies like the SNBTS. As Mr McIntosh observes,
''big companies could make billions of dollars out of the whole thing,
but this would warp the market and bring it into imbalance.''
He could have added that this was one area at least where crude market
forces must never be allowed to gain even a foothold. After all, most
people who go into a church hall to give blood would never regard this
as something for which they should be paid.

Whether you need a chair, desk or complete office, one firm may be
able to help, Roy Beers reports.
THE yuletide ''end of year spend'' is over, and the more prosaic
frenzy around March business budgets is about to begin . . . with
nationwide specialists Georgeson Office Interiors quietly confident of a
telling success.
In early December the firm launched a potent new customer-friendly
weapon in the form of its Public and Utilities Division, a natural
extension to a portfolio based on size and organisation.
The Georgeson style has been honed over around 20 years, but the
particular advantage consolidated by the PUD has been fine-tuned.
Pick up the telephone for a chat about how that all-important budget
may best be deployed, says sales manager Tony McKee, and enjoy
discovering the sort of fluidity and scope his rapid-delivery
organisation can provide. ''In simple terms, that means giving the
customer complete satisfaction on anything from a desk and a chair to a
complete lecture theatre, or the complete refurbishment of a hospital.''
Georgeson clients include health boards, local authorities, colleges,
and universities, but Mr McKee believes the formalisation of an approach
which already scored high points on speed of response, customisation,
quality and -- vitally -- cost effectiveness, will also be good news for
buyers in all sorts of other markets.
''Everyone has the same kind of problem at this time of year,'' he
says, ''whether they are new businesses starting up, hospital trusts, or
anybody forced to consider how to allocate the cash they have to spend
by spring.'' He adds: ''The extra edge our new set-up gives us is our
ability to make things as easy as they are rewarding at every single
stage of the process.''
Mr McKee suggests telephoning Susan Logan at Georgeson Public and
Utilities Division for an initial chat, and the unique advantages of
dealing with specialists in creating complete office interiors will
quickly become manifest.
One useful aid is an impressive selection of showrooms which give an
immediate broad picture of the range of possibilities available, as well
as the sort of quality involved.
Designs can also be just as readily adapted to cater for different
budgets. The aim in each case is a finished result which combines
colour, furnishings and office equipment to create an environment which
is both effective in working terms and visually attractive. The
furnishings, available in a pleasantly wide choice of styles, run the
gamut from desking to storage, office screens, and furniture for dining
rooms or canteens.
The quality of the service also entails useful advice, where needed,
on the prevention of the new wave office malaise of Repetitive Strain
Injury . . . a problem which if left unaddressed can be as potentially
expensive for an employer as it is unpleasant for the employee who falls
victim.
Designs comply with the EU directive on VDU, and trained staff will
supply all the necessary assistance, with demonstrations where required.
With the pitfalls of maladroitly applied modern technology
acknowledged, Georgeson then go on to show the plus side of the coin,
and with interest, by using their CAD design service to proper
advantage.
The sharp end of the operation is run with the same degree of care and
attention. Fitters are factory trained and fully qualified, and the
company employs its own installation teams, using the firm's own
vehicles.
Reliable materials from British manufacturers are an important aspect
of the firm's interior contracts work, and, as with furnishing
installation, tradesmen are fully qualified to complete their
specialised tasks to exacting standards. The service can easily range
from a wholesale refurbishment (including survey, application for
building warrant, electrics, etc) to provision of new or revamped
furnishings to gain a different look, or a better use of space.
Interior contracts' remit spans every feature of a project, from
CAD-integrated design to finished result. It is underpinned by a
commitment to achieve value for money, both overall and at every stage.
Stationery, the third arm of the Public and Utilities Division
service, is designed to mirror and complement every other area of the
business in its essential approach. Thanks to investment in a
first-class computer system the firm is able to promise customers that
around 97% of stock available for immediate despatch straight from the
catalogue.
The human and friendly face of the system -- its fully trained
telesales staff, administration and delivery teams -- are creatively
deployed to allow the hi-fi back-up to operate to its best effect.
Mr McKee and his team believe that the direct control which the
operation enjoys over virtually every aspect of origination, supply and
delivery is one of the biggest advantages of the service from the
customer's point of view.
The other is an undoubtedly strong base of existing clients. They, in
their diversity, have allowed Georgeson to steadily achieve a formidable
buying power, and with it the sort of quantity discount structure which
can hardly fail to appeal to the time-conscious but necessarily prudent
January spending planner.
It amounts to a well-presented case for making that initial call.
Georgeson is confident that potential new clients will feel their
January budget headaches begin to ease from that point on.
The firm promises customers that around 97% of stock is available for
immediate despatch.

BEFORE the American War of Independence most ships using the Clyde
were built in North America: it was after that war that shipbuilding was
introduced on the river.
By 1787 3400 tons of the 16,800 tons owned on the Clyde were built
locally. But the industry really came alive when steam propulsion and
iron were introduced on a wider scale in the 1840s, followed shortly
afterwards by steel. William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton built the
world's first ocean-going steamer, the Rotamahana, made of mild steel in
1879.
By 1889 326,136 tons of steel ships were being built on the Clyde, and
by 1913 750,000 tons a year were under construction on the river. In
1919, before the Depression, more than 43,000 men were working in Clyde
shipyards.
According to Lloyd's Register, during 1929 97 ships with a gross
tonnage of 342,585 were built on the Upper Clyde while 37 ships with a
gross tonnage of 189,794 were built on Lower Clyde.
Other shipbuilding areas in Scotland mentioned in the Register for
that year were Aberdeen, where 21 steamers with a gross tonnage of 7092
were built, Dundee whose output was five ships with a tonnage of 17,191,
and Leith with 14 ships weighing in at 31,674 tons.
The output from Scottish yards of 588,336 tons was more than a third
of the UK's total output of 1,522,623 tons.
However 1930 saw the arrival of the Depression and employment in
shipyards in the Clyde dropped to 29,310 by April of that year, while by
1935/36 output from Clyde shipyards had fallen to 60,000 tons.
The Second World War saw a revival of shipbuilding and by the end of
it 50,000 were employed in Scottish shipyards. There was, however, a
steady decline although even at the start of the 1960s the UK was still
the world's second-biggest shipbuilding nation. Even although the
industry was showing signs of crisis at the start of the seventies,
Clyde-built gross tonnage in 1972 was 235,000 and 20,000 men still
worked in the Clyde yards.
The crisis was highlighted by the UCS work-in which spanned the period
of July 1971 until September 1972, when UCS 8500 workers took over the
yards after the Government allowed them to go into liquidation.
The yards involved were John Brown Clydebank Division, Charles Connell
Scotstoun Division, Alex Stephen Linthouse Division, and Fairfield Govan
Division.
After the work-in came the formation of Govan Shipbuilders, comprising
the former UCS yards at Govan, Linthouse, and Scotstoun. It was from
this that Kvaerner eventually emerged. The fourth UCS yard, the former
John Brown's of Clydebank, was rescued by Marathon Manufacturing Co of
Texas and converted to a platform construction yard. It survives today
as UIE.
Yarrows, which had been a member of UCS, withdrew from the consortium
in 1970 and today continues as an independent naval yard.

How successful have Scotland's indigenous industries
been in adjusting to new situations? In the first of a
new series Harry Conroy examines Clyde shipbuilding.
''CLYDE-built'' no longer rings round the world with the same loud
clang it once commanded when more than 30 shipyards lined the river. The
sound of ships being built is now confined to the yards at Fergusons,
Kvaerner, and Yarrows.
Other proud names such as John Brown and Co of Clydebank, William
Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton, and Stephens of Linthouse have long
gone.
Some satisfaction can be taken that the industry has survived at all:
Shipbuilding has, after all, disappeared completely from rivers such as
the Tyne and Mersey.
Bill Scott, chief executive of Ferguson Shipbuilders, believes the
remaining Clyde yards can prosper but does not see the industry ever
returning to its heyday.
''I regret to say I don't see any new yards being created,'' says the
Clyde shipbuilder. ''The capital investment is too great.'' But he does
believe there is an ''opportunity to maximise the existing facilities''.
These include not only his own yard but also Kvaerner and Yarrows. He
also believes shipbuilding could return to Ailsa Shipbuilding at Troon
where, although other work is done at present, a ship has not been built
for eight years. But he does not think it practical to restore Scott
Lithgow as an active yard.
Bill Scott is in a good position to know about spotting opportunities.
Four years ago Ferguson Shipbuilders in Port Glasgow was on a care and
maintenance basis with a skeleton staff of 34 when he and two colleagues
bought it from the Government.
''Within two months it would have closed,'' he says. But the former
British Shipbuilders' executive saw a future for the mothballed yard.
''I believed there was potential and that the shipbuilding market
would improve in the 90s as the world's ageing fleet had to be
renewed.''
Fergusons builds ships up to 6000 tonnes deadweight and Scott points
out that 60% of Northern Europe's ships are below this tonnage.
''Our competitors are not the Koreans and Japanese but yards in
Western Europe, and our labour costs are below our competitors' in these
countries,'' he says.
His confidence in the yard proved correct and within four months
Ferguson Shipbuilders had gained its first order, for two CalMac ferries
worth #5.3m.
More work followed and the yard has now received orders for 11 ships,
seven of which have been delivered. The Port Glasgow yard now directly
employs 300, with a further 100 sub-contractors also working in the
yard.
Turnover for 1994 was #17m, and this year Ferguson will launch four
ships with, says Bill Scott, ''some interesting prospects for 1996.''
The yard still has growth potential. At present it is on single-shift
working but two and three-shift working could be introduced, allowing
more ships to be built. A further 150 could be added to the workforce,
with a corresponding increase in sub-contractors.
Bill Scott is delighted to have played a part in rejuvenating Ferguson
Shipbuilders. ''When I started in the industry in 1958 there were 20
merchant shipbuilders on the Clyde and 10 slow-speed engine builders,''
he says.
''I can remember Scott Lithgow having 400 apprentices only 15 years
ago. And although we have only 18, there is nothing left at all on the
Tyne and Wear where I worked during the eighties.''

INVERNESS-based Tulloch Construction Group, which changed its
financial year-end from March to September, has reported 18-month
pre-tax profits of #801,000.
The company, which reported a one-third increase in 12-month
''interim'' earnings, to #523,000, at the end of March, made profits of
#278,000 in the remaining six months of its transitional accounting
period.
Tulloch, which employs 450 people and is one of Scotland's biggest 250
companies, believes its switch from highly-competitive tendering
situations to self-generated business is a big factor in its success.
The group's property packaging and homes divisions now provide the
foundations for the activities of its construction division.
Tulloch's turnover during the 18-month period to September 30 totalled
nearly #54m, with Tulloch Homes achieving record sales on a record
number of sites.
Managing director David Sutherland said: ''Putting emphasis on
self-generated work has paid off handsomely in terms of increased
activity and it is interesting that other companies in our sector are
now adopting this strategy.''
He added that Tulloch ensured its property ventures had occupiers
lined up and thus avoided the risk of over-exposure which had hit others
in the past.
Tulloch's profits from joint ventures doubled during the period and
the company is looking to develop key links with individuals and
companies.
The group's accounting period was changed because it felt a September
year-end more accurately reflected the business's commercial cycle.

RECOVERY in the Scottish housing market could be stalled by interest
rate fears and other obstacles to potential housebuyers, the Halifax
Building Society's regional general manager warned yesterday.
His comments came as the latest Halifax House Price Index revealed a
2% fall in house prices in Scotland in the final quarter of 1994.
The malaise affecting the housing market in England could spread north
of the Border if concerns surrounding Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's
comments about less generous income support payments to unemployed
homeowners and fears of further interest rate rises begin to hit the
hard-won confidence of Scottish housebuyers. Base rates, currently
6.25%, were raised by 50 basis points in September and again in
December.
The introduction, on April 1 this year, of the cut to 15% in the rate
of mortgage interest tax relief will further dent the market.
While acknowledging that the 2% fall in Scottish house prices was
largely the result of seasonal factors, the Halifax's general manager
for Scotland, Mike Provan, was much more worried about a continuation of
the trend in the first quarter.
Referring to the possible impact of the interest rate, income support
and mortgage interest tax relief factors, Mr Provan added: ''If these
factors begin really to work, we might see a sustained fairly neutral
position in Scotland.''
However, on the positive side, he believed Scotland was in the
fortunate position of having quite a stable market, compared with the
''rollercoaster situation'' in the south of England.
The Scottish housing market outperformed the rest of the country in
the third quarter of last year, when the Halifax's index showed a 0.7%
quarter-on-quarter and a 3.4% year-on-year rise.
However, the latest figures released by the building society reveal
that Scottish house values were broadly unchanged in the 12 months to
December 31. The average price of properties in Glasgow and Dundee fell,
with little change in Edinburgh and a rise in property prices in
Aberdeen.
The average house price in Scotland, at just under #57,000, is now
about 92% of the UK equivalent.

GUINNESS is to split two of its global regions within its United
Distillers spirits arm to increase attention on high-growth markets.
The Asia Pacific region is now divided into the Asia region --
covering China, South-east Asia and Thailand -- and the Pacific region,
embracing Japan and Australasia.
The former International region is split into the Latin-America region
and a new international region covering Eastern Europe, Africa, the
Middle East and India. It means United Distillers will have six global
regions rather than four previously.
United will have directors solely dedicated to Asia and Latin America
-- the two fastest-growing regions in the world for Scotch whisky.
Guinness chairman Tony Greener said: ''I am delighted to announce a
revised organisation structure and executive team for United Distillers,
which will give new impetus to the business into 1995 and beyond.''

FRESH from expelling its Athena card and poster business from the
group, Pentos yesterday reported that sales in the second half of 1994
were ahead of the previous year with an encouraging final quarter for
booksellers Dillons.
Dillons' sales in comparable stores in the fourth quarter were 5.4%
ahead of the same period in the previous year. However, sales improved
markedly in the run-up to Christmas with Dillons up 8.6% helped by a
record Christmas week.
City analysts believe that Dillons could have made profits of #5m in
the second half compared with a trading loss of #13m in the first half.
In the third quarter, Dillons' sales were adversely affected by
earlier action to clear old and redundant stock. Pentos is pinning its
future growth prospects on the flagship Dillons chain, which could lead
to disposals of further businesses within the group. Bill McGrath, chief
executive of Pentos, believes that Dillons has the potential to be
''tremendously profitable''.
On Tuesday, Grant Thornton announced that the bulk of the Athena High
Street chain was to close after it failed to attract acceptable offers
for the business. It was put into administrative receivership on 28
December. However, all but one of the 30 franchised shops will continue
to trade including the four Scottish outlets.
In the fourth quarter, Athena sales, excluding sales by franchisees,
rose by 2.5%. Pentos said this result ''was below the level needed to
deliver a return to profit''.
Elsewhere in the group, the Ryman stationery chain recorded a sales
increase of 1% in the second half in a flat market where there was
significant competition. Underlying growth in stationery and service
sales was more than 5% in the fourth quarter and over 3% in the second
half.
The withdrawal from loss-making personal computer sales was offset by
stronger stationery sales. Second- half sales at Pentos Office Furniture
were 21% ahead of the previous year, after an 8% rise in the first half.
There was no mention yesterday of margins and likely profits at
Pentos. The company is currently in negotiations with its bankers about
refinancing the business.
Pentos has been attempting to restore its fortunes after the ousting
last year of founder Terry Maher. Last year, the group lost #70m and
this year City analysts expect it to lose about #45m after taking
account of the Athena closure costs.
Yesterday's trading statement saw Pentos shares dip a penny to
10[1/2]p.

THE most reassuring noises emerging from First National Finance
Corporation yesterday were the promise by chairman Martin Mays-Smith
that the consumer finance group was ''not going to get intoxicated by
going for growth at all costs''.
Such was the state of mind which in 1973 and 1974 helped precipitate
the secondary banking crisis and a Bank of England rescue.
Much more recently it reappeared in 1992 when losses amounted to #36m
when there was a severe liquidity squeeze and the threat of bank loan
default.
That may be defensive but more positively FNFC is now on an even keel
with the all-important consumer credit activities benefiting from a #10m
fall in bad-debt provisions to #36m which resulted in profits improving
by approximately that amount to #26.3m.
Overall, the group saw a swing from losses in the year to October from
#37.3m into a #1.3m surplus helped also by a #13m fall in bad debts in
commercial lending for a divisional loss reduced from #23m to #12m.
During the year, bank debt was cut by #180m to #730m or about half
that at the peak. This process has been helped by the securitisation of
mortgage loans which are then sold on to other banks which want exposure
to low-risk commercial lending.
The future level of debt will depend in part upon the rate at which
the consumer loan book is increased and also the success achieved in
selling the #190m of property assets now consider outwith the group's
core activities.
FNFC is also seeking to refinance its debt towards the end of this
year which could lead to a reduction in the shoals of banks from 103 at
the last count to a more manageable number and also allow the payment of
a more liberal dividend.
Cash payments to the parent company from the First National Bank
subsidiary are currently restricted.
The payment this year is being maintained at 1.5p with a 0.9p final.
Home improvement such as new kitchens remains the major stimulus to
new loans from around 2000 ''feeders'' in the form of the points of
sale.
The other significant sector is second mortgages where borrowers have
been turned down by unsympathetic banks. However, a startling figure is
that 15% of all FNFC loans are at least 40 days in arrears even if the
position is improving for most recent business.
Current year profits could exceed #10m which indicates earnings of
about 3p per share -- FNFC has substantial tax losses to complicate the
calculation. That points to the stock at 64p, up 7p, trading at over 20
times earnings which leaves it perhaps as a share for the specialist
investor.

SCOTTISH Nuclear has won a #1.9m contract to help upgrade a Russian
power station, prompting it to launch a specialist subsidiary to pitch
for overseas work.
The Smolensk nuclear plant is to be modernised with aid from the
European Commission, which signed the deal with Scottish Nuclear. As
favoured partner for the project, the East Kilbride-based company stands
to win a big slice of the #9m worth of linked contracts in the next few
years.
Much of the assistance will involve the installation of a computerised
safety and operations system already tested and used in Scottish
Nuclear's plants.
The Smolensk team will be led by John Dynan, a senior engineer
seconded from Scottish Nuclear's Torness power station.
In the past couple of years, the company has won consultancy work in a
string of East European countries which are keen to apply Western
technology to their Soviet-designed nuclear plants.
''The fall of the Iron Curtain has opened up new markets for Scottish
Nuclear, using its world-class safety record and engineering skills,''
Robin Jeffrey, chief executive of the state-run company, said yesterday.
''So setting up Scottish Nuclear International to capitalise on these
assets and opportunities was a logical step to take,'' he added.
Aside from Russia and its former satellite states, the Far East
probably holds out most potential for SNI to exploit the commercial
opportunities of the nuclear industry.

SHARES of United Biscuits, the UK's largest biscuits and snacks
manufacturer, have been going nowhere for some time and yesterday's
update on trading from the McVitie, KP and Ross Young's group, is
unlikely to provide any boost over the short term.
Indeed the price initially dipped 10p before recovering to close at
319p, down 2p on the day.
Any real advance in the price would look to depend on a revival of
earlier bid speculation since the stock market itself appears unwilling
to look beyond the admittedly unexciting growth for last year and the
prospect of the same in the current year.
In the meantime the present price level is supported by a yield of 6%.
UB is forecasting that pre-tax profits for 1994, due on March 16,
1995, will be close to the 1993 level of #181.8m ahead of exceptional
items and a pension adjustment of #2.5m. This is lower than most market
projections, though far from dramatically so. One analyst, for example,
had been looking for around #185m.
Action is being taken to cut its cost base in the highly-competitive
UK snacks market. KP (UK) is closing its crisp and snack manufacturing
plant at Grimsby in North Humberside to counter overcapacity in the
market which has caused unfavourable trading conditions. UB says that
the funds released from the closure wil allow increased investment in
building KP's successful core brands.
There is to be a phased transfer of production to its factories at
Teesside and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, with the process being completed by
September 1995. Some 980 jobs, of which 730 are part-time, will be lost
at Grimsby but a total of 460 new jobs will be created at the Teeside
and Ashby sites.
The cost of closure is estimated at #21m, #6m cash and the balance the
write-off of assets. This will be reflected as an exceptional charge in
the 1994 accounts. In addition, there will be extra capital expenditure
of approximately at the Teesside and Ashby factories. Annual operating
cost savings from the closure wil be around #6m, accruing in full in
1996.
In the first half of 1994, UB's profits rose 12% before tax and
exceptional gains, from #71.4m to #80.1m with better performances in the
US, Europe and Asia Pacific more than offsetting a downturn in the UK
market for biscuits and snacks which suffered from price deflation in
the fiercely competitive climate.
The company now reports that the abnormally mild autumn weather
conditions following the hot summer months in Europe resulted in
continuing softness in many markets though Christmas trading was
generally strong, if late.
Although trading conditions have remained challenging, and the
industry has faced increasing input cost inflation, most of the group's
businesses are said to have performed broadly in line with expectations.
The exception was KP's snack operation in Spain where the performance
was disappointing.
At home, McVitie's, the leading biscuit brand which has seen volume
growth without any value increase, market share progress was maintained.
Competition at KP in the snack market limited the recovery of cost
inflation. But KP also suffered an adverse sales mix as own-label crisp
volumes increased and branded savoury snack volumes were less buoyant.
Hence UB's decision to take the knife to this division. At Ross Young's
the recent strong trading performance has been maintained.
As in the first half, performance in Continental Europe was generally
encouraging with sales and profit progress in most businesses. In the
US, Keebler, the troubled US cookie and snack-maker, has seen a stronger
sales performance in the latter period and regained the biscuit market
share lost in the first half. Restructuring remains on track and the
recovery of this business is continuing.
There is nothing very much to inspire in the overall picture, at least
for the current year. And although some analysts regard UB as a good
recovery stock, the overall market view still seems to be one of
caution. Recurring bid speculation about possible big international
players, though, could enliven the scene.

YOUNG people aged from 15 to 25 in Fife are being asked how they
manage their finances, and how they fare as consumers of products and
financial services, writes ALAN HUNTER.
The result of an intitiative by the European Commission, the Fife
Young Consumers' project has been awarded a 50% grant from the
Commission to carry out a study of young consumers' needs according to
their income and responsibilities.
It will also study the quality of financial services they experience,
and the sources of information and guidance available to young consumers
in Fife.
Young people from all walks of life will be invited to take part in
the survey, which involves simply completing a short questionnaire.
Based on returns, a first-ever convention of young consumers will be
held in the near future.
It will allow participants the opportunity to consider and discuss the
findings, and make recommendations to the region's consumer protection
department and the European Commission.

John Ker, head of Owner-Managed Business Services at Ernst &amp; Young in
Glasgow, looks back at the last three monthly winners of the TrailBlazer
award scheme.
October: Edward Macbean &amp; Co Ltd.
BRITISH Telecom, the Post Office, the Automobile Association,
electricity boards and police forces are only a handful of big names
already benefiting from an association with the October winner, Edward
Macbean &amp; Co Ltd.
There is no shortage of ambition within the company, which
manufactures high-quality waterproof and protective clothing and, under
the guidance of chairman and managing director Jim Hunter, has its
sights on becoming the worldwide market leader in this specialised
field.
The innovation and creativity displayed in many aspects of the
company's operations and procedures indicate that the distinction of
being world number one may now lie just round the corner.
In the past year turnover has increased by 64%, to the current level
of over #7m, and staffing levels have also seen a dramatic rise. Both
are primarily the result of a policy decision, taken at the end of the
80s, to enter Europe.
To try to avoid certain problems that could present themselves in
terms of competing for contracts in a foreign business culture, Macbean
has developed partnerships with companies in Holland, Switzerland, and
Germany and, through continued expansion into Austria, Scandinavia,
Finland, and France, it now regards Europe as its domestic market. The
challenge ahead is to penetrate the Far East and the US.
None of the equipment and machinery at the Cumbernauld manufacturing
plant is more than four years old and the company was the first in
Scotland to install the state-of-the-art Lectra Computer Aided Design
and Manufacturing systems, which not only ensure that designs and
cutting are of the highest precision but also enable customers to choose
the design and style graphically, rather than having to go to sample
making.
November: DX Mobile Phone Centres.
THE November winner, described as one of Scotland's
''recession-beating success stories,'' is in the enviable position of
having seen turnover increase by 800% during the past year.
And every fifth phone sold in Scotland is now connected by DX Mobile
Phone Centres.
At the start of 1994, DX not only beat off competition from 120
dealers to claim the distinction of being Scotland's only mobile phone
specialist to be nominated for Cellnet's UK Dealer Of The Year award,
but also returned across the border having beaten the best of 1800
outfits in England to net the top award.
To say the company is gearing up for a very exciting market, most
noticeably in terms of growth potential, is something of an
understatement. In recent months, major investment has been made in the
infrastructure of the business, in key people, in computer systems, and
in a head office capable of supporting substantial growth.
DX's current turnover figure of #3.5m is forecast to rise to #9m over
the next 12 months and the number of retail outlets is also set to
double, from nine at present to 18 by the end of this year, the majority
of which will remain north of the border.
December: Smith Anderson &amp; Co Ltd.
ONE of the UK's biggest integrated paper, polythene and packaging
manufacturers, Fife-based Smith Anderson &amp; Co, was voted the December
winner, principally for its success in turning its attention towards
environmental friendliness while increasing its product quality and
profitability.
Thanks to a technology-driven initiative, most of the 48 million paper
bags and 25 million polythene bags produced each week are now
manufactured from 70% or higher post-consumer waste, with every step of
the process tightly managed for energy efficiency and pollution control.
Technology is the driving force behind the company's success and a
recent #10m investment, rebuilding machinery, has resulted in
higher-quality paper being produced from lower grades of raw material,
as well as an increase of 8000 tonnes per year in productivity for the
same energy consumption.
As well as stationery paper, Smith Anderson produces self-opening
satchel bags which serve the demanding environmental needs of fast-food
chains, supermarkets, wine merchants, and a host of high-street
retailers. It also produces pharmaceutical bags and about 20% of all
bakery bags used in the UK.
Acutely aware of the importance of continued investment, particularly
in new technology and environmental improvements, Smith Anderson is
planning more developments, although for the time being they are being
kept under wraps.

IT may all be appropriate in 1995 -- the centenary of the
Franco-Scottish Association and the 700th anniversary of the Auld
Alliance.
Alloa Pubs and Restaurants, part of Allied Domecq, has circulated its
Scottish staff offering someone the opportunity of managing a pub, an
English one at that, at the French end of the Channel Tunnel.
There is, however, a bit more to understanding the demand: ''Deux
bieres s'il vous plait''.
The Ind Coope retail division, which has set up a number of ''John
Bull'' pubs in Europe, is not only insisting on someone who can
communicate in French, but want a successful applicant who can cope with
a busy working environment where there may be less immediate support in
the event of problems.
Yet it will be good news for the brewing staff of 89 at Alloa, and
colleagues at Burton-on-Trent, who are supplying markets in Norway,
Hungary, and, of course, England with a new beer, John Bull Bitter,
aimed at continental palates.
Alloa is already producing the supplies for four new pubs recently
opened in Norway, sending a Scottish training manager to educate staff
in the British style of the trade.
The French pub is due to open in March in the Cite de L'Europe at
Calais. Interest among Scottish staff has been keen, said training
manager Michael Connaboy. Development manager John Howkins added that
the French venture would form part of a major thrust to increase
business in France and Italy.
Michael Connaboy is enthusiastic about the French move, following his
impressions of staff training courses he completed in Norway.
Appropriately, from his point of view, while working in English-style
pubs, female staff wear tartan.
''If the French venture takes off in the way it has in Norway, there
should be no problems for the new manager or manageress.
''In Norway, for example, our new staff speak perfect English, and I
discovered their sense of humour was very similar to that of the
Scots.''
In the first 10 days of the Trondheim operation, 10 kegs of beer were
sipped by thirsty Norwegians, the equivalent of 504 pints -- which,
according to Mr Connaboy, is good news for the Alloa brewery.

A YEAR ago last week Chris Green returned to ScotRail to lead the
network through the perils of privatisation into a bright future of
expansion.
Two scenarios existed then. He was either the White Knight relishing
the challenge of again making ScotRail a success -- or pushed into a job
he didn't want, running trains on a network over which he had no control
and no hope of making serious profit.
Whatever the position, Mr Green truly believed the Government at that
time wanted to develop rail services -- and recognised ScotRail,
preparing for privatisation, had to become ''a proper product'' through
investment.
Today, he is a very angry man. Since his move, any dreams of bringing
quality back to the railways have been shattered by Government economic
policy and by the industry's fragmentation.
Cutting public expenditure and rail privatisation don't mix. In
reality, they are in competition with one another.
ScotRail has no investment, down to modernising information systems; a
freeze exists on ordering new rolling stock, and cuts loom on a scale
never seen since Beeching.
Instead of expansion, annual costs will probably have to be cut by at
least 5% from April -- with more to follow.
It is now obvious Mr Green would have had second thoughts about taking
the ScotRail directorship if he had known his acknowledged skills in
developing markets were to be turned on their head because of the
financial constraints.
But he is fighting back, quietly within the corridors of power and now
in the most public of ways. The Government will ignore at its peril his
warning in today's Herald that he will be ''running ScotRail down'' if
more subsidy is not forthcoming.
Mr Green is hopeful a compromise over the scale of cuts will be
reached before the new financial year on April 1 because ''common sense
and logic will prevail . . . a better railway can be achieved only by
higher levels of subsidy''.
The former ScotRail general manager, who launched Network SouthEast
and is credited with many customer innovations, returned north when his
job as managing director of InterCity ceased to exist when the nation's
rail backbone was fragmented into six companies.
His support for rail privatisation has always been lukewarm, despite
heading one of seven shadow franchises already operating as if
independent companies.
One of the great ironies of the privatisation, he believes, is that
some two-thirds of the money required to keep ScotRail in business at
current levels will still have to come from taxpayers or ratepayers
after the sell-off.
In other words, unlike other privatisations, the railways -- a
loss-making industry -- will always be dependent upon political
decisions about levels of subsidy.
However, Mr Green's determination to renew national pride in the
network cannot be denied.
With recruitment and investment already frozen, he has forcibly told
Ministers his only options to achieve a 5% budget reduction -- without
cutting services -- is to:
* Reduce staff -- on trains, platforms, in maintenance depots;
anywhere he can.
* Reduce expenditure on materials, resources, and in depots; and . . .
* Increase income, by attracting more customers to investment-starved
services.
In an exclusive interview, Mr Green also admitted that the recent
memorandum to the all-party Transport Select Committee from Professor
Bill Bradshaw of Oxford University and consultant Richard Hope, former
editor of The Railway Gazette, may not be far off the mark.
He confirmed the likelihood that trains will be less frequent and more
crowded, and will be expected to operate regardless of age.
Mr Green stressed ScotRail -- due to lodge its formal tender in April,
and to be fully privatised in November -- has to achieve the budget cuts
despite having no ''assets'' other than its staff and a Scottish public
committed to preserving services.
Under the break-up, even his trains are leased from a rolling stock
company and run on lines owned by Railtrack, which makes access charges
to its 1,674 miles of track in Scotland.
The Government expects ScotRail to offset cuts in subsidy by
efficiency savings and revenue gains, but Mr Green predicts the
inevitable consequence will be ''to run fewer trains with fewer staff''.
Industry observers believe the latter could be political suicide for
the Tories, with voters well aware that the full franchise process need
not be implemented.
They suspect the Government could even be forced to reintegrate
control of track and trains in Scotland as it becomes increasingly
desperate to retain support before the next General Election.
It is also argued the Government is unlikely to give long-term
guarantees on subsidy levels to any of the 25 rail operating companies,
despite their franchises lasting seven years or more and the need to be
made more attractive to a suspicious City.
A radical trawl by ScotRail's shadow franchise management is underway
to find politically acceptable solutions, but Mr Green warned that that
may prove impossible: ''The time will come when we will run out of
tricks to meet the Government's demands.''
He insisted that virtually every train in ScotRail, which employs
4,100 and carries 49,000,000 passengers a year, will always need to be
subsidised.
Of current #320m running costs, about #100m comes from passenger
revenue; #110m from the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, overseeing
the privatisation process; and #110m via Strathclyde Regional Council.
Some #173m of income goes straight to Railtrack, responsible for all
infrastructure, including stations, signalling, and tunnels.
Until April, Strathclyde's annual subsidy to ScotRail for services
within the region, the largest commuter network outside London, stood at
#30m. That figure has more than tripled. The Government has guaranteed
to make up the difference, but only for the moment.
The hike can be explained by soaring access charges since the
Government allegedly raised the real cost of railway assets to get a
better return from Railtrack's sell-off.
Ministers want a 5.1% return from Railtrack, rising to 8% in two
years' time, and the infrastructure has been valued at replacement cost
which, overnight, pushed its notional worth up from about #3 billion to
#6.5 billion.
Mr Green denied his trains will become dirtier in the drive for
savings, because a key customer demand is cleanliness. Nor does he
intend to oversee line closures, regardless of the financial crisis.
He said, for example, that the Inverness-Thurso line -- regarded by
many as the most vulnerable in Britain -- is safe. He aims not only to
keep the line, but develop it as ''an integral part of the way of life
in an isolated part of the country''.
A promotional campaign is underway because its success depends on
increasing traffic, although the 160-mile route was now ''extremely
economical''. But it was admitted that one of its two depots, at Wick or
Thurso, will go under the cuts.
There will also be no reprieve for the loss-making Fort William to
London and Glasgow/Edinburgh to Plymouth sleeper services, and Motorail.
Although symbolic of a ''social railway'', they were excluded from the
minimum services demanded of ScotRail by rail franchising director
Robert Salmon.
Mr Green, taking over the remaining sleeper services between London
and Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Inverness, confirmed they will be
much smaller trains than at present. They will fall from 16 to eight
coaches, and have no ''sit up'' places, which means people travelling
overnight must book cabins.
''It will be the cheapest railway, not the best,'' observed Mr Green,
who warned that tourism revenue in particular could fall because of
lower levels of service provision.
Optimism remains because of ''tremendous enthusiasm and support'' for
ScotRail from the public and staff. There will be campaigns to boost
income, especially outwith the tourist season.
It is likely special two-for-one offers, which mobilised some 25,000
to take trains in winter months after the damaging signalworkers'
dispute, will be repeated.
However, summer discounts for tourists will be dropped because it is
believed they will pay premium rates. Similar fare increases for
commuters are ruled out because Scots, unlike their London counterparts,
can easily use other modes of transport to and from work.
Where possible, ScotRail's will reduce running costs by leasing
Sprinter trains, cheaper and less luxurious than locomotives.
Mr Green refused to be drawn on ScotRail's privatisation timetable,
which Opraf has insisted still stands, although the shadow franchise
still has to secure more than 1,000 contracts arising from the
fragmentation.
One other significant factor in uncertainty over future train services
remains -- the future of Strathclyde Regional Council, which contributes
millions in exchange for commuter services.
Its demise under local government reform has raised question marks
over continued subsidy. Mr Green said: ''It is a very cohesive,
politically united council that takes big strategic decisions on
transport policy. It is not known what will happen when the region, and
its boundaries, disappear.''
His message to Government is brutally simple: develop ScotRail in
1995, don't run it down.

THERE is a pantomime touch to the story of how Robin Smyth came to
form Impact Lighting with his partner Robert Young.
Robin was taking a year out in Australia when he spotted an unusual
lamp. No genie appeared when he touched it, but it did light up and its
effect led him to launch a successful business.
The lamp turned out to be worked by a sensor. The concept impressed
Robin and he returned to Scotland shortly afterwards with a single lamp
as part of his baggage.
He got together with Robert Young, a friend for 15 years, and launched
Impact Lighting in a small factory unit in Glasgow.
''The company Robert was with folded after he had been with it for 18
years, so we decided to get together,'' says Robin.
Since the company was formed in February last year demand for the
decorative sensor lamps has mushroomed.
''We now assemble this type of lamp over here and produce them in a
whole range of designs,'' says Robin.
The parts for the lamps are made in the Guangdong Province of China
after Robin visited the area in a trip organised by Strathclyde Business
Development. The sensor equipment is manufactured in the UK.
Since last October the company has produced 3000 lamps and the
components arrive every month in 40ft container lorries from China -- a
far cry from the day Robin brought a single lamp back in his holdall.
''I will be going to China twice a year to visit the factory which
produces the parts for us, to ensure that the quality we want is
maintained,'' he says.
Next year Impact Lighting plans to expand into new areas where it
believes there could be a demand for touch-style lighting.
''We are looking at producing lamps for hotel chains, and also for
offices where touch lighting for desk shades could be popular,'' says
Robert Young.

WOMEN's pension rights is hardly the stuff of front-page news, yet it
is one more area where women in this country face discrimination at an
appalling level. How often do we hear of women being patronised because
they are unaware of what the future holds for them financially? Yet any
woman who tries to find out about her state pension rights faces an
assault course.
Government makes the state scheme impossibly difficult to understand.
Is there, I wonder, a political motivation behind the refusal to spell
out, in clear and straightforward language, the financial consequences
of, for example, career breaks on women's state pension rights?
Insurance companies are usually no better. There is too much technical
jargon; although many of them purport to have facilities to stop and
restart pension arrangements to suit financial and family commitments,
they do not give information that shows the real impact if a woman takes
time off paid employment to have children.
Many so-called professional advisers marginalise women by allowing
them to assume that they will be adequately provided for by a husband's
financial arrangements. Yet husbands or partners often refuse to sit
down and discuss long-term financial plans, with the result that many
women do not know how disastrous it would be for them to rely on the
state pension scheme or that of their husband.
Did you know, for example, that by raising women's pension age to 65,
Government has saved itself #5bn a year? Imagine the outcry from male
bastions of power if these changes had hit men instead of women. And did
you realise that the state pension is not inflation-proofed, as most
people believe? Originally, the state scheme was intended to give a
pension of 25% of average earnings. Today, that equates to about 15% and
by the year 2030 the state pension will be worth only 7% of average
earnings.
As we all know, we make our (compulsory) investment into the state
pension through national insurance contributions, yet I can think of no
other investment that has less accountability and where we have so
little idea of what the end result is going to be. Only 15% of women are
entitled to a ''full'' pension based on their own earnings, but nearly
2,000,000 women who work part-time or are on low pay will be unfairly
penalised. Even political change may not help because, whichever party
is in power, it looks quite likely that the state pension scheme will be
allowed to wither away.
But the problems facing women do not stop with the state scheme. Many
employers provide staff pensions, but the fact is that only 35% of women
are in company pension schemes, compared with a figure of 60% for men.
And many company schemes have ''slipped in'' a retirement age of 65 for
women, so younger women will have to wait longer for their pensions or
suffer a penalty if they retire early.
On top of this, it is likely that women will have a career break so
they will have a lower penson entitlement than their male colleagues.
Even if a woman has managed to build up the same fund as a male
colleague, she will find that her income in retirement will be 10% lower
than his because annuity rates are less for women as insurance companies
argue that women live longer.
Despite these drawbacks, women who reach retirement with their own
pension are luckier than those who have to rely on a husband's pension
or an ex-husband's pension. Over the next 30 years, it is estimated that
there will be a fourfold increase in the number of women aged over 60
who are divorced. Many of them will descend into poverty as divorce
settlements can rarely make up the benefits a woman loses under her
husband's pension scheme.
Although Scottish courts take the value of a pension into account,
they have no power to attach pension rights or force trustees to split a
fund.
It is only in the past few years that women have started to accept
that they are entitled to share in an ex-husband's pension. It is a
joint asset. Even if a woman has not direcly contributed to the scheme,
she is still a legal beneficiary, but she will probably have a fight on
her hands to get what is rightfully hers.
Divorce aside, let's look at widowhood. By the age of 75, 40% of women
will have lost their husband and, because of the way most pension
schemes are designed, it is likely that a widow's income will be halved.
Many women believe they will be entitled to their husband's full
pension, but this is not the case. By a cruel twist of fate, if a woman
marries or remarries after her new husband has retired, she will
normally get nothing when he dies.
And, let's face it, the illness and death of a partner is hardly the
time when people are equipped to deal with financial complexities, and
that is when the problem comes full circle. Too often the woman is
unaware of joint arrangements, if they exist at all, and it is too late
to make alterations.
In my opinion, a number of changes should be made to the current
system:
* Courts should be given power to divide pension rights on divorce.
* State benefits should be equalised at a compromise age -- not 65.
* The state pension should be paid to everyone, whatever their NI
contributions.
* NI contributions should clearly define how much is going towards the
state pension.
* Everyone should have the right to continue to contribute to their
pension during a career break.
* Widows should be entitled to a more realistic pension income when a
husband dies.
The whole system needs to be simplified and streamlined. More informed
press coverage would go a long way to helping women understand their
rights and the problems they face and, finally, women themselves should
take more of an interest in and responsibility for their future
financial security.
Mark Morpurgo, a partner with Personal And Corporate Solutions, was
talking to Yvonne Wightman.

SCOTLAND'S newest boat-building company has achieved its first export
order -- although it will cost #300 to ''post'' it to the United States.
The order for two boats, with an option for two more, is destined for
Oklahoma which is, of course, land-bound. This does not present a
problem for boat-builder Barry Cowie as his vessels are mere 4ft models:
Sending them out from his East Kilbride workshop will not involve a
full-scale launch.
It is only 12 months since Cowie formed his company, Mast 'N' Crafts,
after leaving British Telecom where he had worked for 32 years.
''I had been a modelmaker all my life,'' he says. ''So when I left BT
I went along to Strathclyde's New Enterprise Workshop in Paisley. They
advised me on market research and let me use their equipment.''
Barry gives The Herald credit for helping to get his fledgling
business off the ground. ''At the time I was making only models of the
Waverley, and after the story appeared in the paper I received a number
of inquiries which led to orders.''
Mast 'N' Crafts now makes a whole range of model boats although the
Waverley continues to be the most popular.
''I have built models of 25 different boats which have appeared on the
Clyde Estuary and the Forth and Clyde Canal,'' says Barry. ''We are now
specialising in building boats which appeared on these waters, although
I have done a model of Nelson's Victory.''
His models range in price from #250 to #3000 and often find their way
to company boardrooms.

FOUR out of five stations in Scotland will cease to offer
through-ticketing under a proposal published yesterday by the Rail
Regulator, the man responsible for protecting the traveller's interests
under railway privatisation.
A consultation document produced by Mr John Swift QC suggests the sale
of tickets for journeys with more than one train could be handled by as
few as 36 Scottish stations, down from the current 186.
Yesterday Mr Swift was forced to postpone a holiday and defend himself
at a press conference in London, after the Government distanced itself
from the plan in the face of a political outcry.
Mr Swift insisted it was merely an option for consideration, and that
what mattered was producing ''value for money'' for travellers. He would
listen to the views of the industry.
He said: ''I have been appointed by Parliament to promote the public
interest in a new, restructured, to-be-privatised railway. One of the
public interest objectives is to promote the use of the network which
includes the promotion of through ticketing.''
But Labour described the plan, which would reduce the number of
stations in Britain capable of selling through tickets from more than
2500 to a core of 294, as a ''hammer blow'' to the Government.
At the weekend Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney was forced to
intervene when news of the proposal leaked out and attracted immediate
criticism. He said it was unacceptable and pledged to resist it, but is
limited by Swift's statutory independence.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour's transport spokesman, said: ''Labour intends
to step up its campaign as we see 150 through-ticketing stations in
Scotland simply axed. This is a stark reminder of the grim realities of
privatisation and of a Regulator who doesn't seem to appreciate that his
job is to protect passengers rather than to do the dirty work of a
Government in promoting privatisation.''
The document offers three options for consideration by the Franchise
Director, who will supervise the franchising process, and potential
franchise operators. They are:
* ''Core Stations and Services'', listing 294 major stations -- which
include remote stations such as Wick and Thurso, as well as ferry ports
such as Stranraer -- at which through-tickets must be sold.
* ''Incremental Change'' whereby an operator would be required to
maintain existing range of retail services until the Regulator was
satisfied that alternative arrangements were in place which would
justify a reduced service at stations.
* A ''two-tier approach'', which adds to the core stations a second
tier of stations with what is described as a ''less onerous retailing
obligation'', selling a less comprehensive range of tickets.
British Rail already has around 55 million journey and fare
combinations and Mr Swift said that selling through-tickets from all
stations in the restructured industry could significantly increase train
companies' costs.
In his conclusion, Mr Swift stresses: ''Network benefits such as
through-ticketing are one of rail's great attractions as a mode of
travel. Their widespread continuation will be one of the key tests of
the success of the restructuring of the industry.''
But he emphasises that privatisation will require an improvement in
services. ''The key is to strike the right balance which protects the
interests of users while giving operators flexibility to innovate and
improve their services.''
The reorganisation of the railways under privatisation, which involves
the fragmentation of the railways into dozens of separate, competing
companies, has raised a succession of difficulties for the Government
which Labour are trying to exploit.
Labour leader Tony Blair has pledged to focus on railways this year.
On Tuesday he called on the Prime Minister to ban any potential
franchise operator who failed to give sufficient guarantees that
through-ticketing will be protected.

COMPANIES in the fast-growing Caithness flagstone industry are putting
their wares in the ''shop-window' for the first time at Britain's
inaugural Fair for the ''dimension stone' industry, which opens at
Wembley Exhibition Centre next month.
The companies are putting their wares on display at the First Natural
Stone Show, which is being organised from February 28 to March 2 in the
Wembley Exhibition Centre by Buckingham-shire-based Resources
Exhibitions.
The show, which covers the range of natural stone products and
machinery needed for the industry, mirrors several other bigger annual
fairs in Europe and worldwide, notably that at Carrara in Tuscany, the
traditional centre of the Italian marble trade.
Exhibitions director Brian Haugh said: ''This is the first major
exhibition of its sort in the UK, and obviously we are meeting a need
because stand-space is effectively sold out. The dimension stone
industry is huge in international terms. Worldwide sales topped #10bn
last year.''
Firms showing are A &amp; D Sutherland, of Spittal, near Wick, which
recently supplied the major upgrading of Edinburgh's prestige Royal
Mile; Caithness Stone Industries also of Spittal, which is involved in
supplying a large re-development in Belfast and Caithness Flagstones,
which recently entered the industry with a new quarry and processing
facility near Thurso.
Also participating is the Orcadian Stone Company of Golspie,
Sutherland, which produces a range of attractive ''down-stream' products
from flagstone and the newly-former UK associate of German combine
Granit Union, based at Inverness and is actively promoting the product.
Also there is newly-formed Ledmore Marble International, a joint
venture between the owners of the Ledmore Quarry in Sutherland and a
Carrara, Italy, company which is processing and selling the products of
the Scots marble quarry internationally.

Ross County 2, Forfar Ath 1
* ROSS County opened up the Division 3 title race last night with a
superb performance to beat league leaders Forfar 3-1 at Dingwall.
But Forfar opened brightly on the hard Dingwall pitch when David
Bingham and Ian Heddle tested County keeper Steve Hutchison.
County hit back and Jamie MacPherson missed a glorious, close-range
chance after seven minutes.
The pace dropped for a long spell but the home side finished the half
in style. Skipper Gordon Connolly's 25-yard effort smacked the bar in 41
minutes.
However, he had better luck three minutes later when he opened
County's account with a delightful header from Chris Somerville's chip
into the area.
It was a nightmare second half for Forfar, who had defender Eric
Archibald sent off after 59 minutes professional foul on Brian Grant.
Then Jamie McPherson hit his tenth goal of the season, his effort
coming from 18 yards in 65 minutes to set County up for their fifth
consecutive league win.
Forfar pulled one back from a close range, Sandy Ross shot in 76
minutes.
ROSS COUNTY -- Hutchison, Somerville, Reid, Williamson, Bellshaw,
Furphy, Ferries, Grant, McPherson, Connolly, Herd. Substitutes --
MacKay, A. MacLeod, MacMillan.
FORFAR ATHLETIC -- Arthur, Glennie, McPhee, Irvine, Archibald,
McKillop, Morgan, Heddle, Ross, McCormick, Bingham. Substitutes --
Mearns, Hannigan, Stephen.
Referee A Roy (Aberdeen).
* THE SFA will investigate the crowd scenes at two showpiece matches
played at McDiarmid Park in Perth.
The disciplinary committee will discuss the incidents when Raith
Rovers beat Airdrie in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final and when Airdrie
beat Dundee in the final of the B&amp;Q Cup.

DUNDEE United's Gary Bollan will go before the Scottish League today
in an attempt to free himself from his Tannadice contract. He signed a
four-year contract with a four-year option as a teenager in 1990. He is
now in the first year of the option, but objects to the wording of the
extension clause.
And the 21-year-old, backed by the Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association, and United will have their cases heard by the League's
Appeals Committee in what is thought to be the first of its kind in
Scottish football.
Bollan's argument is that the wording in the extension clause is
meaningless and therefore the contract should be declared void. If the
league uphold the complaint, Bollan could become out of contract -- and
possibly open the way for other players at the club to be extricated
from their contracts.
However, United, who are likely to be represented by chairman Jim
McLean and vice chairman Doug Smith today, would have a right of appeal
to the SFA.
Ipswich's Stuart Slater also has a case coming up today. Slater is
claiming money from Celtic which he feels he was due under his contract
with the club.

YESTERDAY'S news that the jarring note of the car alarm is being
replaced in some models by the Greatest Hits of Des O'Connor caused
initial confusion yesterday at our Nerd House coffee-break debate. For a
start, we couldn't remember any of his greatest hits.
The Braces thought Mr O'Connor would have to record a special
repertoire appropriate to car theft. I've Got My Eyes On You by Cole
Porter was a possibility. If the car was beginning to show bodywork rust
and needed new tyres, then Thanks A Million by Arthur Johnston would do
nicely.
However, Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, said
we had completely misunderstood the principle behind this shrewd move.
''What's the big problem been with car alarms until now? It's this: when
they go off accidentally, which is always happening, the owners don't
rush out immediately to shut them off. But now . . .''
Of course, we said. Clever Angelica.
* TRADING standards officers in the north of England have completed a
survey of shops selling maggots to anglers and have condemned the
practice of adding extra sawdust to the product. Today we're privileged
to have on the programme Seth Golightly, who worked undercover for two
months to help expose the swindle. Good morning and welcome.
''Allo.''
Now Mr Golightly, could you give us a little background?
''Well, it started when a bunch of really angry anglers came round to
the office and emptied a tin of maggots on the desk at reception and
bellowed 'Look at this! What a liberty!' 'Orrible it were. The
receptionist had to take the rest of the day off.''
Hmm. And what was the nature of the complaint?
''The anglers said maggot salespersons had been adding so much sawdust
to the purchase that they were getting short weight. They wanted us to
weigh the maggots and the sawdust separately and record the result.''
Sounds simple enough.
''No it weren't. I had to pick up each maggot singly, remove the
sawdust with a toothbrush, and place the evidence in separate
containers. I were t'unlucky one. The others pretended they all had
colds and were liable to sneeze. Took me hours.''
And what did you discover?
''First, I discovered I don't like maggots. Second, I had to buy a new
toothbrush. And third, I found that this so-called pound of larvae
actually included five ounces of sawdust. That's when we decided to
launch 'Operation Wriggle' with me posing as an angler and going out to
buy the nasty things.''
How do you pose as an angler, Mr Golightly?
''Simple really. You don't shave or change your shirt and you go
clumping about in waders all the time. Anyway, the survey showed that
maggot misrepresentation was widespread. Now I'm writing a paper on it
called Ethical Maggotmongering: A Code of Good Sawdust Practice (1995).
Should take a year or two.''
Fascinating. What else is on the cards?
''My latest job is to go undercover and look at sales of farmyard
manure. When you buy 'a load of manure', what d'you actually get? My
problem is . . .''
Wait a minute, Mr Golightly. Something tells me you've started your
research already.
''Yeah, this morning. How can you tell?''
Well, thanks for coming on the programme . . . (Signature tune comes
up five minutes early.)

* GALA Fairydean last night sacked their manager, Gordon Rae, and his
assistant, Kennedy Davidson.
The 36-year-old former Hibs and Partick Thistle defender signed a
two-year contract with the Galashiels non-league club in May 1993.
However, it is believed that his failure to restore Gala Fairydean to
the top of the East of Scotland league was the main reason for his
dismissal.

<HEADLINE>Fall in industrial production rules out an early rise in interest rates</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>R E DUNDAS, CHIEF FINANCIAL EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<FLAG>SCOTLANDS BUSINESS</FLAG>

<TEXT>
THE Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer were thought likely to stay their hands on the next rise in
interest rates until March or even later after an unexpected fall in
industrial production in November suggested that the pace of activity
slowed down in the fourth quarter.
Minutes of the early morning meeting between the two men on December
7, published yesterday, showed that an upward revision to third quarter
gross domestic product from growth of 0.7% to 0.9% played a key part in
the decision to raise base rates by half a point to 6.25% that day.
In the event GDP growth was subsequently revised down to 0.8%, but
this was mainly because the figure for the second quarter was adjusted
upwards.
City economists were speculating last night that fourth quarter growth
could slow down to 0.6% when the Central Statistical Office makes its
first estimate a week on Monday.
Retail sales were flat in October and November. The figure for
December is due a week today amid mixed reports of the strength of
Christmas trading.
Growth of around 4% last year owed much to an upsurge in industrial
production, driven by the strength of exports.
But in November factory output came off the boil. Industrial
production dropped by a seasonally adjusted 1% and its manufacturing
component by 0.7% against City expectations of increases of 0.3%.
Mild weather hit demand in the electricity, gas, and water sector,
where output fell by 7.6% between October and November.
The manufacturing figures suffered from lower output in the food,
drink, and tobacco and engineering industries.
James Capel's Adam Cole pointed out that production had risen strongly
in the previous two months and that it was always dangerous to read too
much into one month's data.
Any slowdown in the fourth quarter growth rate was likely to be
weather-related in the main. The weakness in retail sales in October and
November was attributable to poor demand for clothing and footwear.
But the Treasury claimed that growth in output was slowing to a more
sustainable rate. Despite the fall in November the trend remained
buoyant.
In the three months to November factory output rose by 0.8% and was 5%
higher than in the same three months a year ago.
Industrial production was even stronger with comparable gains of 1.1%
and 5.4%. This largely reflected growth of 4.4% in oil and gas
extraction in the latest three months and 22.6% from the same three
months a year ago.
The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor, Eddie George, are
due to meet again on February 2, the week before the Bank of England
publishes its quarterly inflation report.
Signs that the economy is coming off the boil may persuade them to
wait before raising interest rates a third time to avert inflationary
pressures building up.
At the December 7 meeting, which was held the morning after the
Government was defeated on increasing the VAT rate on domestic power,
the Chancellor and the Governor debated the timing of the subsequent
rise in rates, but decided to go ahead immediately. Delay would would
have left the expectation of a rise hanging over the the economy and the
markets.
Mr George said: ''In the present climate that would add to the
uncertainty and could be dangerous.''
Mr Clarke wasted little time in agreeing to the Governor's
recommendation of an immediate increase to enable the authorities to act
in good time and to reduce market uncertainties.
But the detailed minutes suggested that the decision was not as clear
cut as had been thought at the time.
The Governor conceded that there was a dichotomy between ''the buoyant
manufacturing sector -- especially those businesses that were
particularly involved in exports -- and the more cautious personal
sector.''
He noted that the growth of domestic demand had fallen in each of the
previous three quarters and that consumer spending had moderated to an
annualised rate of 2%.

THE swish of the selectors' axe reverberated around Murrayfield
yesterday as the Scotland rugby team to play Canada a week on Saturday
at the national stadium was announced.
Nine of the side beaten by South Africa in November have been told
their services are not required this time, the pack has been practically
rebuilt, and there are two new caps.
After nine internationals without a win, it could be termed the
afternoon of the short staves. ''We require more collective
responsibility from some of our senior players,'' said team manager
Duncan Paterson.
Out go Tony Stanger, of Hawick, the man who scored the winning try in
the 1990 Grand Slam match. He wished to play in the centre, the
selectors did not want him there.
Centres Scott Hastings and Graham Shiel also are omitted -- the former
has been injured but was told that he was dropped in any case.
Scrum-half Derrick Patterson, a success against the Springboks, is
relegated to the bench.
In the pack, the exit signs have flashed for Paul Burnell at prop,
lock Shade Munro, flanker David McIver, and No.8 Doddie Weir. Bath lock
Andy Reed, who would have been picked, misses the match because of a
back injury.
Back into the side comes Melrose wing Craig Joiner, one of eight
promotions from the successful Scottish A team, Gala's Gregor Townsend,
centre Ian Jardine of championship-chasing Stirling County, and Bryan
Redpath, the Melrose scrum-half.
''We were pleased with Patterson against South Africa,'' insisted the
manager, ''but Redpath has forced his way in with a series of
outstanding displays in the last month.''
British Lion Peter Wright returns to the front row and, after a season
out of favour, another Lion, Damian Cronin, now with the French club,
Bourges, comes back in the second row.
''I was far too complacent,'' admitted Cronin. ''But it hurt to be out
and it feels as though I have been given my first cap again.''
His partner will be new cap Stewart Campbell, of Dundee High School
FP, 22, 6ft 6in, 16st 8lbs. He shone in the ''A'' wins over South Africa
and Italy, toured Argentina with Scotland, New Zealand with his club,
and spent last summer playing in Australia.
''He has worked hard for this promotion and is ready,'' said David
Leslie, the former Scotland captain who has been Stewart's coach at his
club. ''His physique is much improved as is his confidence.''
Originally from the West of Scotland, Campbell is now an architectural
student at Dundee University.
Rob Wainwright's recall to the back row was expected and he is joined
by the other new cap, Eric Peters of Bath, at No.8. His vitals stats are
25, 6ft 5in. and 16st 10lbs.
Peters was born in Glasgow of Dumbarton parents before the family
moved South, so let no-one challenge his credentials. A former Cambridge
University captain, now studying to be a chartered surveyor, he played
for the England Under-21 side and the English Students XV.
''But that was before I had been approached by the Scottish Exiles,''
he said. ''I have always thought of myself as a Scot and my parents are
thrilled.
''It is only a few weeks since I appeared in Scotland -- it is hard to
believe this is really happening.''
There is no Border representative in the pack for the first time since
1972 -- a comment perhaps on the state of our domestic rugby. Not a
single Exiles back, however, has broken through.
Duncan Paterson denied that the team coaches, Douglas Morgan and
Richie Dixon, are under any more than normal pressure to produce a
victory. They will be given back-room assistance from director of rugby
Jim Telfer and Roy Laidlaw.
One has to say, however, that another defeat would bring howls of
protest from supporters, particularly if Scotland are going to resort to
kick-and-chase tactics. The inclusion of a ''flair player'' like
Townsend may suggest a more expansive plan.
A G Hastings (Watsonians), captain; C A Joiner (Melrose), G P J
Townsend (Gala), I C Jardine, K M Logan (both Stirling County); C M
Chalmers, B W Redpath (both Melrose); A V Sharp (Bristol), K S Milne
(Heriot's FP), P H Wright (Boroughmuir), D F Cronin (Bourges), S J
Campbell (Dundee High School FP), R I Wainwright (West Hartlepool), E W
Peters (Bath), I R Morrison (London Scottish).
Replacements -- I C Glasgow (Heriot's FP), A G Shiel (Melrose), D W
Patterson (West Hartlepool), G W Weir (Melrose), A P Burnell (London
Scottish), K D McKenzie (Stirling County).

GREG DYKE'S appointment as chairman and chief executive of the Pearson
media and entertainment group can be interpreted as a further step in
preparation for the retirement of group chief executive Frank Barlow who
is 65 in March but has as yet given no indication as to when he will
depart.
Under Mr Barlow, Pearson has become a much more focused company,
shedding its industrial interests such as Royal Doulton china and the
Camco oil drilling services business in the US with only the Lazards
merchant bank remaining as a peripheral activity.
Mr Dyke, 47, made a #7m fortune when he was able to exercise his LWT
share options last February after Granada acquired the television
contractor in a #765m hostile bid. His dynamism will be required as
Pearson expands its global television ambitions, having been
unsuccessful in establishing a presence in Hong Kong last summer.
In November, Pearson teamed up with the BBC to launch two 24-hour
European satellite channels which begin transmission towards the end of
this month.
It has recently gained a foothold in India for a joint venture with
Hindustan Times and TVB of HongKong.
Pearson's existing television interests include Thames, which has both
a substantial library as well as a strong programme making capacity --
it was co-producer with the BBC of Cold Comfort Farm.
It also has 14% of BSkyB worth #580m, 15% of both UK Gold and UK
Living, as well as 14% of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. It is involved
in bidding for Channel 5 and so Mr Dyke's experience in preparing for
the LWT franchise should be of considerable value.

Celtic 1, Hearts 1
A SPECTACULAR goal from Pierre van Hooydonk on his debut should have
set Celtic up for a rare win, but guess what? Tommy Burns' side could
only draw.
Burns introduced his new #1.25m striker last night, but some things
about this Celtic side will not be easily changed, and Burns again had
to squirm as his players lost an advantage and had to settle for a share
of the spoils. This was their thirteenth premier division draw of the
season.
Van Hooydonk struck in 12 minutes, when he controlled a Mike Galloway
lob out of defence, flicked the ball over Neil Berry, and then held off
another challenge. Having drifted across the edge of the box it seemd
the Dutchman had been too elaborate in his execution -- ''I thought he
had lost his opportunity,'' Burns confessed afterwards -- but suddenly
he tried a shot.
The ball hurtled through the air and was trapped in the top left-hand
corner of Craig Nelson's net almost before the Hearts keeper could
react. Nothing to it. Just like that.
The goal was totally unexpected, but it is precisely that quality, the
element of surprise, which has been missing from Celtic's play and,
naturally, Burns was delighted to see someone deliver at last.
''You won't get too many big guys who will pull the ball down, beat
two men on the edge of the box and score,'' said Burns. ''He is more
than just a front player who will run on to balls thrown into the
middle, because he links well and has a good touch.''
However, the fact is van Hooydonk was then denied a decent supply of
quality passes and crosses, even though Burns rhymed off the names of
those Celtic players he felt had performed well. He named his midfield
players, Paul McStay, John Collins, and Phil O'Donnell, but it seemd to
me that while they enjoyed a great many touches, particularly in the
first half, they rarely played the killing pass.
Despite van Hooydonk's early breakthrough, which gave heart to
Celtic's supporters and all those who had been tempted by odds of 25-1
against the Dutchman scoring a hat trick on his first outing for the
club, the match degenerated into an evening of sweaty endeavour. It
never did match up to van Hooydonk's early flash of brilliance, and that
was a pity, because the newcomer's presence had a significant effect on
the gate.
It was bitterly cold and damp last night, but 26,491 turned up, and
that was almost 5000 up on Celtic's previous Hampden attendance. Having
offered so much at the beginning Celtic failed to follow through,
leaving their supporters still burdened with doubt.
Burns, though, was adamant his side would have won comfortably had it
not been for a decision by referee Hugh Dallas to award Gary Mackay, a
substitute for the injured Scott Leitch -- as a precation he had a badly
bruised leg encased in plaster last night, but there are no broken bones
-- a penalty after the midfield player had gone down heavily inside
Celtic's box after a challenge by Stuart Gray. ''I am very disappointed
about the goal we lost, but I can't say any more about it,'' said Burns.
Hearts' equaliser arrived in 55 minutes, and regardless of Burns'
interpretation, Gray's challenge was rash. In fact, it was the action of
an inexperienced player, because there was no need to tackle Mackay, who
was pursuing the ball away from Pat Bonner's goal.
Celtic's players registered protests, but when order had been
restored, Jim Bett ambled forward and placed the ball in Celtic's net.
The Tynecastle side moved the ball with slightly better efficiency in
the second half and their manager, Tommy McLean, felt his side could
have won. ''If anyone was going to win it was us,'' he said. ''We
dominated the second half, when there was more purpose to our passes.''
Apart from a Brian Hamilton shot, which hurtled a yard or so wide of
Bonner's left-hand post, Celtic's defence had no cause to be concerned
early on, while van Hooydonk's goal certainly alarmed Hearts' defence.
The striker demonstrated his aerial threat in 23 minutes when he rose
above Dave McPherson to meet Paul Byrne's cross from the left, but
unfortunately for van Hooydonk, he could not get enough purchase on his
header and Nelson heaved a sigh of relief.
At the opposite end, Kevin Thomas's solid header from a Stephen Frail
free kick flew narrowly wide of Bonner's top left-hand corner and served
as a warning that Hearts were not about to retreat into a defensive
shell.
McLean made his second subsitution only three minutes into the second
half when Thomas limped off after having hurt a foot. The diminutive
John Robertson was sent on, and less than a minute later he was
cautioned after having fouled the elf-like Brian McLaughlin, who
probably felt like telling the striker to pick on someone his own size.
Tommy Boyd fouled David Hagen a few minutes later and left the former
Rangers player writhing in agony as the referee allowed play to
continue, and Hearts should have taken advantage by equalising. Frail
ran the ball down the right-hand side of the pitch and placed a cross at
the feet of Robertson in front of Bonner's goal, but the striker
mis-kicked and a wonderful opportunity was lost.

Bucharest, Wednesday -- International financier George Soros said
today that he was more concerned about the crisis in Mexico than
currency turmoil, as he believed the Mexican problem was of global
importance.
''That I think can have very severe repercussions throughout the
world,'' Mr Soros told a news conference dealing mainly with his
philanthropic work in Romania.
Asked if he was worried about the volatility of the dollar and its
weakness against the Japanese yen in recent weeks, Mr Soros said the
real problem was the peso crisis.
He did not make it clear whether he was stating the position of his
international investment vehicle, the Quantum Fund. But he was
responding to a question about his general view of currency markets
having previously forecast a stronger dollar.
''I'm not so concerned about the currency movements, I'm more
concerned about the crash in Mexico and Latin America,'' he said.
Mr Soros said the crisis in Mexico was ''a very serious crash'' which
had implications for bond and stock markets around the world and for
investment patterns. He declined to elaborate.
The US-based financier gained international notoriety in September
1992 when funds he managed made $1000m speculating that the pound
sterling would fall out of the European currency grid.
It did, and Mr Soros was there to pick up the winnings as the British
currency fell sharply.
Earlier he shrugged off worries about the dollar falling below 100 yen
despite his view late last year that the dollar was headed for a
stronger position. ''I'm not worried,'' the Hungarian-born Soros told
Reuters before the news conference. -- Reuter

TECHNOLOGY moves so quickly that what is top of the pops in the High
Street can change markedly and rapidly. This was evident in last year's
slump in demand for computer hardware and games after a period of strong
growth. These items have been replaced by mobile phones and various
forms of multimedia technology. As Britain's largest electrical retailer
through its Dixons and Currys trading formats, Dixons Group has been
able to respond to this change in customer demands and has increased its
sales and market share.
The company said this had been achieved despite ''profligate and
uncommercial promotional activity by the regional electricity
companies''.
Although there continues to be talk of consumers' unwillingness to
part with their hard-earned cash, Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons,
said that people were willing to buy if the products and prices were
attractive. ''If the products are right consumers are spending,'' he
said.
In the 28 weeks ending November 12, the group's sales rose by 9% to
#698m enabling retail trading profits to increase by 30% to #25.2m. The
group's overall profit before tax was #26.6m, at the top end of City
expectations, compared with a pre-exceptional #17.3m in the comparable
period of 1993.
Multimedia personal computers and related software, mobile telephones,
audio products and white goods such as washing machines were the main
contributors to sales growth. In contrast, sales of camcorders and
computer games consoles and related software continued to decline.
The Dixons chain has converted 14 of its stores to a new format which
focuses on carry-home electronic products. Early results are said to
have been encouraging.
A Dixons store at London's Heathrow airport, which opened in July, is
said to be trading well. Further airport outlets are planned although no
decision has yet been taken on sites. Three new Dixons The Link shops,
which sell mainly communications service, opened at the end of the first
half and the group plans a total of eight, as part of a trial.
Within the established retail chain there were strong performances
from Currys Superstores and PC World with like-for-like sales up 9% and
and 7%, respectively. The move to larger out-of-town superstores
continues with 17 Currys and five PC World Superstores opened in the
period under review. At the same time 110 Currys' High Street stores
closed. Capital expenditure was #26.4m in the first half and is expected
to be around #60m for the year as a whole.
The management of Dixons' UK retail business is being reorganised with
the establishment of separate management teams for each of its retail
chains. The changes are aimed at enabling the group ''to develop its
retail brands faster and more successfully,'' said group chief executive
John Clare.
Each team will continue to be supported by integrated central
functions, such as finance, systems and personnel, maintaining the
advantages of shared central costs.
Mr Kalms is optimistic about the group's prospects for the full year
given the positive start to trading in the second half. There have been
further improvements in gross margin and sales over Christmas and the
January sale.
Dixons is one of several companies reviewing their advertising
accounts with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi following the resignation of Maurice
Saatchi and other top executives. ''We will be looking and reviewing our
accounts,'' said Mr Kalms who added that the shake-out at Saatchi was
one of the worst examples of corporate governance he had seen.
Commenting on the Office of Fair Trading report into the sale of
extended warranties published in December, Mr Kalms said that it had had
no impact on the sales of these products. He added that there was
nothing in the OFT's recommendations that Dixons was not doing already.
The OFT called for retailers to establish a code of practice on the sale
of warranties.
Despite the encouraging trading statement, Dixons' shares dipped a
penny to 200p in line with the stock market on profit-taking. However,
its upbeat statement added to those of Next and the John Lewis
Partnership will continue to provide underlying share support for the
retail sector.

TRAINERS and jockeys are likely to press for travelling expenses
following the abandonment of Kelso yesterday, although racing had been
given the go-ahead at a 7.30am inspection.
No-one blamed the Duke of Roxburghe, Kelso senior steward, or clerk of
the course Johnnie Fenwicke-Clennel who had the task of calling off the
meeting 40 minutes before the first race.
However, the British Horseracing Board will have to face up to the
issue of compensating trainers and riders for out-of-pocket expenses.
It cost conditional jockey Tom Jenks, who travelled from south of
Cheltenham for two booked rides for trainer Peter Monteith, almost #100
in train and taxi fares.
''Jenks was upset after coming such a long way to earn nothing,'' said
Monteith. He believes the BHB should look at the possibility of setting
aside some of the prize money from abandoned meetings to cover expenses.
Harvey Smith, the former showjumper whose wife trains in Yorkshire,
was in angry mood. ''When you are dragged all this way you should at
least get travel expenses'' he said ''This kind of situation happens too
often.''
Fenwicke-Clennel explained the meeting had been abandoned because of
deteriorating ground conditions and freezing winds, which halted an
anticipated rise in temperatures.
''The stewards decided the course was unsafe.'' he said, adding that
the go ahead had been given at 7.30 because ''warm sunny weather was
forecast and we expected the frost to come out of the ground.'' Instead
it had got colder.
Trainers were divided about whether racing should have taken place,
but jockeys were almost unanimous in agreeing the course was unraceable.

THE editor of a Scottish provincial paper is not to face charges over
the alleged naming of an under-age boy involved in a court case. The
procurator-fiscal at Stonehaven said he would not be taking action
against Mr Derek Tucker, editor of the Aberdeen-based Press and Journal.
Mr Tucker, Mr David Knight, the paper's news editor, and Mr Ian
Johnston, a Stonehaven reporter, were all charged by police last month.
The action followed the alleged identification in the paper of a
15-year-old boy who appeared at Stonehaven Sheriff Court in connection
with a motoring offence. Yesterday, however, fiscal Ernest Barber, who
ordered the initial police investigation, said he would not be
proceeding against the three.

MAURICE Saatchi is to establish a new advertising agency to rival
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, in partnership with other defectors from the company
he founded in 1970.
''Events have moved much more quickly than anyone could have imagined
and I have been called by many clients who are anxious to know my
plans,'' Mr Saatchi said.
Following his dramatic departure from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the media
world has been awash with speculation that Mr Saatchi would retaliate by
founding a new agency and taking staff and clients with him.
The stage is set for a bitter confrontation between Mr Saatchi and his
old employers as he seeks to persuade old clients to defect to his new
agency. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi said it would take legal action to safeguard
its interests and prevent the poaching of clients.
But it can't stop clients walking of their own accord and British
Airways announced it was ending its contract, thought to be worth at
least #12m, pending a formal review of its advertising. Mars, the
American confectionery group, is already conducting a review, and Dixons
revealed yesterday it intended to do likewise.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi also said it was investigating the temporary removal
of ''commercially valuable'' files from its London offices. A spokesman
explained that the contents of up to 15 filing cabinets had been removed
from its offices and taken to the modern art gallery owned by Charles
Saatchi in North London between December 12 and 15.
The company had asked for their return and when they did not appear,
consulted their lawyers. Yesterday afternoon 21 crates of files were
returned.
''We will be going through these files as a matter of urgency to
ensure that the company's valuable property has been returned to us in
full. These files included a considerable amount of detailed and
commercial valuable client information,'' the spokesman said.
Yesterday there was a further haemorrhage of senior staff from Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi as Moray MacLennan and Nick Hurrell, joint managing directors
of the London agency, and creative directors Simon Dicketts and James
Lowther quit. They indicated they could not work for a company in which
major shareholders intervened.
''We are disillusioned working for a company whereby whatever effort
is put in by our staff and whatever success is achieved for our clients,
all this could be overturned by external forces,'' they said in a joint
statement.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi chief executive and acting chairman Charlie Scott
claims that most clients are supportive of the teams they actually deal
with on a day-to-day basis and ''therefore of the group as a whole.''
Proctor &amp; Gamble is one large client which has come out openly in
support of the company.
The new Saatchi agency will take a few months to set up but is bound
to make client defections more likely. Major longstanding clients --
including the Conservative Party -- have tremendous loyalty to the
Saatchi brothers as a result of the success of their campaigns. However
the majority of clients had little or no direct contact with Maurice and
the defectors and there is no reason why they should go if they are
being given good service.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi insists that the senior executives who have left are
contractually bound not to offer their services elsewhere for over two
years in some cases. The executives who left yesterday have contracts of
only several months to run. But any attempt by the more senior people to
join the new agency prematurely is bound to result in litigation.
Meanwhile David Herro, the American fund manager who led the campaign
to oust Maurice from the chairmanship, accused him of putting his own
interests before those of the company.
He reportedly told an interviewer for the Evening Standard newspaper:
''We are shareholders who were appalled by the actions of a chairman who
blatantly ignored the accepted Cadbury principles for the running of a
public limited company. If it was a family farm he could do what he
wanted but when you're chairman of a public company you cannot work
against the company's best interests and make favourable decisions for
yourself.''
The protestors against the putsch also cited non-observance of Cadbury
principles of corporate governance so there is clearly confusion over
exactly what they stand for.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi shares lost a further 4[1/2]p to 107[1/2]p.

ANDY Cole's #7m move to Manchester United may well unleash a round of
transfer madness which could push some of the not so well off clubs into
running up huge debts in an effort to compete at the very top. As JAMES
TRAYNOR reveals, the ultimate price could be closure.
FOOTBALL managers like Alex Ferguson, who has just taken the transfer
market on to a new level by setting a British record with the signing of
Andy Cole in a #7m package, points to market forces.
Those of us on the outside are more inclined to circle index fingers
at the sides of our heads and blame this latest demonstration of
extravagance on a form of madness which, if allowed to go untreated,
could bring the game to its knees.
Manchester United literally can afford to shrug their shoulders and
ask: ''What can we do but pay the prices for the best players?''
And their supporters are entitled to rub their hands in glee at the
thought of seeing Cantona, Giggs, Ince, Kanchelskis and now Cole in the
same side, but there is a darker and potentially ruinous side to a
transfer business which continues to escalate.
Those with the finances and corporate power to compete at the sharpest
end of the market set off chain reactions which can rattle all the way
down to the lowest end, the so-called bargain basement, and a degree in
economics is not necessary to analyse the effects. It works like this:
Newcastle might look to Queen's Park Rangers' Les Ferdinand or Stan
Collymore, of Nottingham Forest, but the fact is Kevin Keegan should be
prepared to pay top dollar. Indeed, the fee for another striker has been
set already, because the football community knows how much he has in his
pocket, and every manager with a good striker on his books will go to
bed at night praying Keegan picks up the phone.
In turn, the manager who sells Keegan a new striker will have to seek
another of his own and he, too, can anticipate paying more than normal
as other managers seek to relieve him of his new-found wealth.
And so it will go on all the way down the line. At this stage it is
impossible to say how many managers will have a piece of Ferguson's
action, but there will be several, and football's own gluttony, its
inflation, continues to be fed, rather than denied, sustenance until a
healthier balance has been restored.
Having United's money sloshing around in the English game is, I
suppose, not a bad thing, but there is something seriously flawed about
gambling so much hard-earned wealth on flesh and bones. The risk
outweighs the potential benefits which can be generated by someone prone
to all manner of human failings.
Of course, the price of Cole was increased because he is English and
can ease the pressure on Ferguson when United play in Europe next
season. United's manager has experienced severe problems trying to
decide on his best three non-nationals, and, like Rangers' Walter Smith
before him, realised quickly that he would have to compete for the best
available players from his own league.
Unlike Smith, however, Ferguson can harvest from a ripe and lush
patch, which is probably why Keegan will not even consider spending some
of his money north of the Border, where the ground is hardly littered
with genuine talents. For this reason Smith, who will have at least #6m
to spend this close season, will try to offload at least two more of his
own non-nationals, perhaps Alexei Mikhailichenko and Trevor Steven, and
look abroad again.
He could be in a position to move in a big way for, say Denis
Bergkamp, but the chances are Keegan, or someone else, might beat him to
the Dutchman.
It is as a direct consequence of UEFA's three non-nationals' rule that
the rate of inflation in the domestic transfer market has increased
significantly, but sanity will have to be restored before football's
finances are so haywire that lasting damage becomes inevitable.
Manchester United could afford to take British spending on to a new
level, and Blackburn Rovers, with Jack Walker's wealth, are in a
position to compete. Surprisingly, Everton also seem flush enough to
play the big-money game, having staggered most people by paying more
than #4m for Duncan Ferguson and now, it seems, anxious to take Mark
Hughes off Manchester United's hands.
However, the problems begin in earnest when other clubs feel they have
to compete. They could be forced by the ambitions of their own managers
and chairmen or the demands of their supporters, but whatever the
reasons they are blinded to the realities of their individual economic
situations. They go into debt.
''When this happens it is generally bad for the game as a whole,''
said Ian Dewar, managing partner of Price Waterhouse, who has made
extensive studies on the finances of football. ''The higher some clubs
take the transfer prices the greater the risks, because other clubs are
tempted to compete when they really can't afford to do so.''
Dewar's fear is that too many clubs will try to compete because of the
pressures, then find themelves in trouble if the players they buy are
injured, suffer loss of form, or even fall out with their managers. He
is also concerned that the money circulating may be mopped up by foreign
clubs and that damage will be done before enough people realise the
folly of their ways.
''My feeling is that you should not spend what you don't have, but I
know the pressures clubs and managers come under to compete with those
who have access to greater resources,'' he added. ''The great danger is
that the ante keeps being upped and many clubs go into debt.
''It happened in Scotland when Graeme Souness started spending large
amounts, which were going into other markets and Scottish football
didn't really get the benefit.''
Dewar feels Rangers can continue to spend which, in turn, will make it
harder for Celtic or any other club to compete, and unless there is a
re-distribution of wealth in the British game the Ibrox side in the
premier division and Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, and a few
others in the south could put even more daylight between themselves and
the rest.
The man responsible for having taken British spending to a new and
outrageous level, Ferguson, does not predict an end. ''Every manager
wants the most he can get for a player, and if some can pay, then
transfers will continue to be high,'' he said.
''Listen, what do you do when a club is determined to have one of your
players? You take the money.
''Of course, the prices are already out of hand -- I received #2m for
a reserve player, Dion Dublin -- but there is not a lot any of us can do
about it, and putting a ceiling on transfer fees won't work, because the
smaller clubs wouldn't agree to that. They want our money.''
Italian football, where the game's genuine wealth is found, have known
extraordinary fees -- #13m (Gianluigi Lentini, from Torino to AC Milan),
#12.5m (Gianluca Viali, from Sampdoria to Juventus), and #10m
(Jean-Pierre Papin, from Marseille to Lazio) -- but there are dark signs
in that rarified environment. A few clubs are experiencing severe
financial problems because they tried to compete with the real powers
and the ultimate price could be closure for one or two of them.
There is no doubt Britain's transfer market has moved on to a new and
dangerous level, but the big spenders should look around and be aware --
and also wary -- of the dangers inherent in their behaviour.
Yes, Ferguson, Kenny Dalglish, Keegan, and Smith must satisfy their
own customers, who are demanding more every season, but everyone in the
game has a responsibility to foster and nurture that game.
Spiralling transfer fees is not the way to protect the game.

St Johnstone 2, Dundee 2
A GOAL in the last minute gave Dundee a share of the points and
extended their undefeated run to eight games at Perth last night.
St Johnstone had turned a one goal deficit at half-time into a 2-1
lead on the 78-minute mark and looked as if they were going to upset the
first division leaders.
Gerry Britton was a late substitute, and an error by home keeper Alan
Main allowed the ex-Partick man to get his head to a Dusan Vrto throw-in
to gain the equaliser.
It was a game marked by wild tackling and bad temper with eight
players booked.
Dundee took the lead in five minutes when Jim Hamilton squeezed home a
neat nod-down from Neil McCann.
Referee Martindale was constantly involved in dealing out yellow
cards, culminating in a brawl in 37 minutes.
Dundee keeper Michel Pageaud had just brought off a double save from
George O'Boyle and Kevin McGowne. The Frenchman went down on the turf
and was surrounded by a melee of players jostling, pushing, and
punching. When calm was restored, Dundee's Noel Blake and Saints' Kevin
Twaddle were booked.
John O'Neil equalised for Saints in 61 minutes and Harry Curran pushed
them into the lead, but Britton kept Dundee's title hopes on course.
Other bookings were: O'Neil and McGowne of Saints, and Teasdale,
Cargill, Duffy and McCann of Dundee.
ST JOHNSTONE -- Main, Cherry, Preston, Irons, Weir, McGowne, O'Neil,
Curran, Twaddle, O'Boyle, Deas. Substitutes -- English, Davenport,
Robertson.
DUNDEE -- Pageaud, Duffy, Teasdale, Cargill, Blake, Bain, Shaw, Vrto,
Ritchie, Hamilton, McCann. Substitutes -- Britton, McQuillan, Mathers.
Referee -- E Martindale (Newlands).

BOLTON added yet another Premiership scalp to their long list of
giant-killing feats last night by sending Norwich tumbling out of the
Coca-Cola Cup at Burnden Park.
Bruce Rioch's side, who have beaten Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, and
Aston Villa in the past two seasons, clinched their semi-final place
thanks to a fine goal from David Lee. His strike after 66 minutes was
enough to put Bolton into the last four for only the second time in
their history.
Swindon became the second Endsleigh League representatives in the
round of the last four with a 3-1 victory against Millwall at the County
Ground. Jan Fjortoft was the architect of the victory, setting up two
for Andy Mutch and scoring a memorable goal himself, with Dave Mitchell
pulling one back for Millwall.
Ian Rush sealed Liverpool's 1-0 victory over Arsenal at Anfield. The
goal, from a well-rehearsed free-kick conjured up by John Barnes and
Neil Ruddock, ended Arsenal's record of 25 away cup ties without defeat.
It also made amends for a glaring, first-half miss at the far post by
the Rush, when he allowed Lee Dixon to hook the ball off the line.
But after the match Arsenal manager George Graham had no excuses.
''They are the team in form and are capable of going all the way. They
play an excellent system, but even apart from the skill factor, they
have players who work very hard for each other.''
Manchester City's Steve Lomas swallowed his tongue during his side's
4-0 defeat by Crystal Palace in London. He fell heavily after a clash of
heads with Palace's Richard Shaw. But by this time Palace were on their
way towards the semi-finals. Darren Pitcher broke the deadlock. Then
John Salako, Chris Armstrong, and substitute Andy Preece completed the
rout.
But Palace's success was marred by trouble after the fourth goal. City
fans broke up advertising hoardings and threw them at stewards and
fighting broke out.

THROUGHOUT 1994, Scotland's retailers were predicting a rising trend
in sales, only to be confounded when they looked, later, at the actual
takings in their tills.
The Scottish Chambers' Business Survey (SCBS), the largest business
opinion survey conducted in Scotland on a regular basis, illustrates the
widening gulf between expectation and reality in Scotland's high streets
in graphic numerical detail.
A net balance of 14% of the sample were anticipating higher sales in
the first quarter of last year. In the event, only a balance of 8%
achieved them. For the second quarter, the balance of optimists had
grown to 17%. In the event a balance of 6% later reported that sales,
far from growing, had actually fallen.
By quarter three, the mood was more sober. A balance of 3% expected
sales to rise. Sales again fell, with a net balance of 6% again
reporting that disturbing downward trend.
By the last quarter, the optimists were again gambling on it being
their turn. A balance of 10% predicted rising sales. The latest figures,
published yesterday by the Fraser of Allander Institute, show a balance
of 15% actually reporting sales down yet again.
That 15% negative balance, as the chart shows, is the worst figure
recorded for retail sales since the survey was revamped in the third
quarter of 1990. Little wonder that the sample (216 retailers out of a
total of 1017 firms surveyed) is, on balance, now predicting no sales
growth at all in the first three months of this year.
That gloomy retail trend raises three important questions. How can it
be reconciled with anecdotal evidence and individual company claims of
booming sales activity immediately before and after Christmas? What is
stopping consumers spending more this far out of recession? And does it
matter anyway, if the end result is a more sustainable, manufacturing
and export-led recovery?
On the first point, the latest SCBS survey was conducted in the first
three weeks of December aand does not claim to monitor last-minute
Christmas spending. Firm data on that will emerge in due course. But
never underestimate the determination of some retailers to use the
evidence of a few days of booming sales volumes around Christmas
(achieved at much slimmer margins in the early January sales period) to
talk up consumption in the traditionally fallow period that then
follows.
That 15% negative balance on sales was more than matched by a 17%
negative balance on optimism. The last time confidence among retailers
was that low was the third quarter of 1992.
Although the gloom seems fairly evenly spread across the retail
sector, shops in Edinburgh and Glasgow (75 of the 216 firms surveyed)
were more bullish on sales, each recording positive balances of 8%. But
even there, retailers are still, on balance, less optimistic than they
were three months before.
So who or what is applying the brakes to consumer spending? Mr
Clarke's massive budget raids must have had their effect. And, as the
SCBS survey points out, there are still ''few signs of upward pressures
on pay rates'' to help repair the damage the Chancellor has done to
family budgets.
One key may lie in the changing pattern of employment. Overall, the
survey reports, trends in employment were poorer than anticipated. But
where people are being recruited it is overwhelmingly on short-term,
part-time or temporary contracts. The changing nature of employment and
the insecurity generated by a more casualised labour force must have a
knock-on effect on consumer behaviour.
Does that matter if the absence of a consumer boom brings the prize of
a sustainable, export-led recovery within our grasp? It does if
reluctant consumers turn into hostile voters, unwilling to re-elect the
party in power. A contrived consumer boom, however belated, may soon be
the only card Mr Major has left to play.

NAMES of National Lottery jackpot winners will be kept secret by the
lottery organisers unless they specifically ask for publicity, MPs were
assured yesterday.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of Camelot which runs the lottery, told the
National Heritage Select Committee: ''We shall not give any information
of any kind whatsoever unless the winner agrees.''
His pledge came in the run-up to this week's draw, which could see a
single roll-over jackpot win of #17 million.
MPs were critical of the way Camelot dealt with the winner of the
#17.8m jackpot who had requested no publicity but was named by some
newspapers.
Sir Ron admitted mistakes had been made in giving the media certain
details but said it would not happen again.
However, he insisted: ''The media did not get the name of the winner
from us.''
Labour MP James Callaghan (Heywood and Middleton) said that,under the
terms of the licence, assurances had been given that names of winners
would be kept secret.
''You failed at the first hurdle. Are you a fit and proper company to
run the National Lottery?''
Sir Ron said there was no guarantee that the names of winners would
not get out. ''People tell a lot of people they have won. In a great
majority of cases, a lot has got out.''
Camelot's communications director, Mr David Rigg, defended roll-over
prizes, saying it was the big prizes that created growth.

Dunfermline 0, Raith Rovers 1
THE excellent memory of penalty kick expert Scott Thomson boosted the
promotion hopes of Raith Rovers in this Fife derby at East End Park last
night.
The keeper, who saved the penalty which brought the Coca-Cola Cup to
Kirkcaldy, did it again when he stopped a spot kick nine minutes from
time from Dunfermline striker Hamish French, and helped Raith to their
fourth victory in a row, which puts them into the heart of the battle to
reach the premier division.
Thomson said: ''French scored from the spot against me when they won
here in August. Then he put the ball to my left so I went the same way
tonight, and it worked.''
The save was only one moment in a dramatic final 20 minutes during
which standside linesman Richard Marzee, of Edinburgh, hobbled off with
a calf injury, Ally Graham scored what turned out to be the winner, and
then the game was stopped again, this time for referee Stuart Dougal, of
Burnside, to receive treatment for cramp.
Add to that a typically fast, hard, and uncompromising derby in an
electric atmosphere, and it was hardly surprising that few of the 8500
fans -- the biggest first-division crowd of the season -- left early.
The injury to the linesman held up the game for six minutes while a
replacement was found, and it was almost a welcome relief for everyone
else after both sides had pounded one another.
Raith broke quickly in the first half, but were badly led down most of
the time with their final pass in front of goal. Dunfermline, on the
other hand, seemed to carry more menace, especially through Kenny Ward
down the right flank and Stuart Petrie through the middle.
Saves by both keepers, spiced by the odd goal-line clearance, kept the
interest high on a bitterly cold night.
Over the piece, Dunfermline probably had the best chances, but off
target shooting, plus a couple of excellent saves from Thomson denied
them. And Andy Tod will have nightmares about the one he missed after 58
minutes when he was given a free header at a Derek Fleming free kick by
a Raith defence, whose offside trap failed to work.
Graham's winner just before the penalty incident was simplicity
itself. Stephen McAnespie sent over a corner from the right and Graham
rose to power in his tenth goal of the season.
Three players were booked -- Shaun Dennis, Graham of Raith, and Norrie
McCathie of Dunfermline.
DUNFERMLINE -- Will, McNamara, Fleming, McCathie, Tod, Smith, Ward,
Robertson, French, Petrie, Millar. Substitutes -- Paterson, den Bieman,
Westwater.
RAITH ROVERS -- Thomson, McAnespie, Rowbotham, Narey, Dennis,
Sinclair, Nicholl, Dalziel, Graham, Cameron, Kirkwood. Substitutes --
Crawford, Wilson, Allan.
Referee -- S Dougal (Burnside).
* ROSS County opened up the Division 3 title race last night with a
superb performance to beat league leaders Forfar 2-1 at Dingwall.
Gordon Connolly opened the scoring in 44 minutes and Jamie McPherson
made it two in 65 minutes.Forfar pulled one back from a close-range,
Sandy Ross shot in 76 minutes.

Mr Tommy Campbell, a union spokesman, said while they did not agree
with the package on offer, they would not stand in the way of anyone
accepting it. Regional convener, Councillor Gordon McDonald, said: ''I
am very pleased the unions have decided not to seek a ballot for

TWO men were accused of conspiracy and fire raising when they appeared
at Perth Sheriff Court following a blaze at a local nightclub on Monday.
Mr Russell Collins, 33, of Dunsinane Drive, and Mr Steven Pirie, 18, of
York Place, both Perth, were charged with conspiring with each other to
set fire to the Electric Whispers club in the city centre. The charge
alleged that Mr Collins provided Mr Pirie with a ladder and cans of an
inflammable substance, which Mr Pirie ignited after pouring it into the
premises through two vents which he had forced open. Neither man made
any plea or declaration during the private hearing, application for bail
was refused, and Sheriff John Wheatley remanded both in custody for
further inquiries.

TAILENDERS Min Patel and Richard Johnson survived a tense trial by
spin in Madras yesterday to earn England A a fighting draw against a
Board President's XI.
Alan Wells' team, set 291 in five hours, held on at 168 for nine, with
last pair Patel and Mark Ilott seeing out the final 22 balls. Before
that, Patel and Johnson had batted with great character through 44
minutes in a match-saving ninth-wicket stand of 30.
Johnson faced 55 balls, scoring just one single and concentrating
solely on a massive forward defence and liberal use of the front pad
against the significant bounce and turn extracted from a wearing pitch
by the Indian side's three front-line spinners.
Patel, however, seized on anything remotely off line or length to
clobber five boundaries in his 25 not out.He faced 54 balls and both
Patel and Johnson survived for just under an hour in the sort of
pressure situation so typical in India.
The President's XI sent down 20 overs in a gripping last hour which
began with England A 138 for seven.
On a day of attritional cricket, England's fighting spirit just about
kept them afloat -- although as ever in India when men are crouched
around the bat, there were several contentious umpiring decisions, too.
Ian Salisbury, for example, given out in the second over of the last
hour, was nowhere near a ball which looped up to leg slip off his thigh
pad -- but he had to go, muttering darkly for the second time in the
match at the injustice of it all.
England A slumped initially to 15 for two, paceman Abey Kuruvilla
removing both Nick Knight and Jason Gallian before lunch with the new
ball after the President's team had declared their second innings at 204
for four in mid-morning.
Michael Vaughan fell in the early afternoon and the A team's fightback
from 48 for three was marshalled by captain Wells.
David Hemp (31) and Dominic Cork (24) took turns to support Wells, and
the Sussex skipper battled through 169 minutes and 130 balls for his 43.
But in the end it took the nerve of Patel and Johnson to make sure the
A team did not go to Bangalore, for the first Test against India A, on
the back of a morale-sapping defeat. Scores:
Board President's XI 333 for six, decl, and 204 for four, decl;
England A 247 and 168 for nine (A P Wells 43, D L Hemp 31; S K Singh
4-67).

PETE Sampras, the world No.1, was reminded of the physical challenges
which lie ahead at next week's Australian Tennis Open as he sweated
through his opening match of the Colonial Classic at Kooyong.
The American, top seed for the year's first Grand Slam tournament
which starts on Monday, had to cope with temperatures up to 36 degrees
celsius as he beat Australia's Wally Masur 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 to reach the
semi-final stage.
But Sampras acknowledged that the heat would force him to make
concessions when he begins his defence of the title at Flinders Park.
''When the sun is out it creates the hottest conditions of the year,''
he said, revealing that he would have to wear a hat in future. ''I play
a lot in Florida and there's no comparison.''
Sampras, as well as most of the population of Melbourne are interested
to see how newly-shaven, prematurely balding Andre Agassi will react. He
has never experienced Melbourne's often-extreme climate, and Sampras
commented: ''I suggest he wears a hat.''
Agassi aside, most of the world's top-10 male players have elected to
complete their preparations for the Australian event by playing at
Kooyong. Boris Becker, Michael Chang, and Stefan Edberg were not
required to toil too long as they completed the first-day victories
needed to have a chance of reaching the final under the event's unusual
format.
Becker beat Jason Stoltenberg 6-4, 6-2, Chang defeated Pat Cash 6-2,
6-4, and Edberg triumphed by a similar scoreline over Michael Stich to
relegate the German into the four-man ''consolation'' pool where the
minor placings will be settled.
Edberg flew into Australia only in the early hours of the morning and,
like Becker, was relieved to play in slightly cooler conditions later in
the day against Stich. ''He wasn't hitting the ball too well and wasn't
playing up to his standard,'' said Edberg.

THE Ashes wheel of fortune has turned back in Chris Lewis's direction.
Four years ago, he was the bright new hope of English cricket Down
Under. . . until a serious back injury cut short his first tour of
Australia. Now, another man's misfortune has given him a glimmer of hope
in what looked like being a wasted winter.
Lewis was in the right place (Melbourne) at the right time (Tuesday
night) when Darren Gough's exciting journey around Australia came to a
painful halt.
Less than 24 hours later, Gough began his sad and lonely journey home
-- his dreams temporarily shattered by a stress fracture of the left
foot. And, from expecting to begin a two-month stint with a Melbourne
club side, Lewis found himself back on England tour duty. The length of
his stay as Gough's replacement is currently uncertain. But, given a
chance, 26-year-old Lewis is determined to make the most of this
unexpected opportunity.
''Even if I'm only here on a temporary basis it's a great tonic for
me,'' he said. ''I'm dreadfully sorry about what's happened to Darren. I
know just how he is feeling right now. But it's up to me to make the
most of this chance.''
Lewis was pressed into service as a substitute fielder during Tuesday
night's World Series Cup victory over Australia after Neil Fairbrother
had joined Gough on the casualty list. ''I only arrived in Australia at
the weekend,'' he said. ''I came here to play some club cricket and lo
and behold I'm suddenly back in an England one-day squad.''
Lewis, having had a reasonably successful tour of the West Indies a
year ago, played in the first of last summer's Texaco Trophy
Internationals and impressed new chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth
with his three-wicket performance against New Zealand.
He seemed likely to appear in the first Test but then ran into more
injury problems, saw Phillip DeFreitas take his position, and never got
back into the frame.
''If I hadn't been injured during the early part of last season I
think I would probably have held my place,'' said Lewis. ''Instead,
other people came in and did well.
He remains one of the great unfulfilled talents of English cricket. On
occasions he has looked the best all-rounder since Ian Botham. . . but
for every good performance there have been two or three lacklustre
displays.
Now, with England undecided about how to replace Gough and uncertain
whether Fairbrother will recover quickly from a shoulder injury, he
could find himself a candidate for the final two Ashes Tests.

ITALIAN contractors' efforts to carry out the upgrading of a four-mile
section of the A74 Glasgow-Carlisle route have taken a long and winding
road.
The #23.4m contract to improve the stretch between Eaglesfield and
Kirkpatrick Fleming was supposed to last 20 months and should have been
finished at the end of November last year. It is now likely to be May at
the earliest before the work is completed.
With each month that passes since the official completion date, the
contractor faces a possible Scottish Office penalty of #250,000.
The project is one of the final stages in an overall #400m programme
to bring the A74 up to motorway status, involving several contractors on
a series of sections along the route.
In the case of the Eaglesfield-Kirkpatrick Fleming section, the
contract was awarded to Castelli Girola, the British subsidiary
management company of two Italian civil engineering firms. It is
understood to be the company's first major roads project in Scotland.
Progress was already well behind schedule in autumn last year, when
things virtually ground to a halt as sub-contractors demanded payments
for work done on the firm's behalf. The Scottish Office stepped in and
advanced #1.75m to Castelli Girola, against a bond from the company, to
allow work to continue.
The project has apparently been hit by further delays.
Now, Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council's planning committee has
rejected the company's application for an extension of permission to
extract road-building materials from a site at Bonshawside Farm at
Kirtlebridge.
Under the original planning permission, extraction at the quarry
should have finished by the end of July last year and the site been
reinstated to agricultural land.
The company applied for an extension until August this year but,
earlier this week, the council's convener, Mr Allan Baldwick,
successfully moved that this be refused and that the council take
enforcement action to ensure the terms of the original consent are met.
Officials will draw up the enforcement notice within the next week or
two. The contractor will then have a month in which to appeal.
The Herald yesterday made repeated attempts to contact Mr Claudio
Benvenuti, chief executive of Castelli Girola, but was told he was
involved in meetings. He did not return calls.
When he last spoke to The Herald, early last month, Mr Benvenuti
denied that some of the problems were due to using machinery more suited
to dry and hot Continental conditions but he did partly blame the delays
on bad weather.
At the time, he also said that the Scottish Office had removed penalty
clauses of #250,000 per month on the overshoot of the deadline -- an
assertion which the Scottish Office contradicted.
Yesterday, a Scottish Office spokesman again said: ''We have not
waived the penalties.''

CONTRACTORS upgrading a section of the A74 in Dumfriesshire could
overshoot the deadline by more than a year, it was claimed yesterday.
The prediction came from Councillor Allan Baldwick, convener of
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council, after a meeting with Scottish
Office officials at which he protested at continuing delays in the
project.
The contractor, Castelli Girola, is a British subsidiary of two
Italian civil engineering firms. It should have finished the #23.4m
upgrading to motorway of the four-mile section between Eaglesfield and
Kirkpatrick Fleming by the end of November last year.
The Scottish Office believes the work could be completed by May but
Councillor Baldwick fears it could take much longer. ''In my view, the
job will not be completed before 1996.''
He was speaking after a routine meeting of the A74 Working Group,
comprising Scottish Office officials and Dumfries and Galloway regional
councillors and officials.
Councillor Baldwick said: ''I asked the Scottish Office officials why
they did not remove the firm which, in my opinion, is a year behind
schedule. And I suggested that, failing this, another firm should be
brought in to assist with the work, which is nearly at a standstill.''
Earlier this week, the regional council's planning committee backed a
move by Councillor Baldwick to refuse to allow the company to continue
operating a temporary quarry where it has been extracting building
materials for the road.
Castelli Girola was originally granted permission to operate the
quarry until July last year, and wanted this extended to August this
year.
The convener said yesterday: ''The refusal was one way of putting
pressure on the Scottish Office. It must take responsibility.
''I don't think the firm can complete the job. It says it has drawn up
a new programme but I understand this was in November and there has been
little work done since then.''
He now intends to write to Scottish Roads Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton to try to resolve the problem.
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday: ''We believe the firm is
capable of completing the job. To replace it at this stage would cost
the taxpayers a great deal of money.''

A CLASH of dates with another major event means that some Scottish
swimmer's medal hopes will be curtailed when the British team head for
the World Student Games in Japan.
The European championships in Vienna also take place in August, and
although Graeme Smith and the US-based pair of Andrew Aitken and Paul
Latimer, would be near certainties for the students' side, they see the
European event as their priority.
Smith, the only Scot to compete in last year's world championships,
would have been odds-on to win gold in Japan. ''He would like to have
done both events,'' admitted his coach, Dave Caleja.
''It's a disappointment about the clash, but the Europeans come first.
He was ranked third in the 1500 metres freestyle in Europe at the end of
the year, and he's aiming for a medal of some colour in Vienna.''
Aitken, at the University of Kentucky, and Latimer, in his first year
at Texas, also have set their sights on a first European championship
appearance, and will be back home for the trials in Sheffield in April.
However, should they miss out on selection, they will have the World
Student Games as a second choice.
The home-based Scots aiming for a place in the students' side include
Edinburgh's Richard Hope and the Stirling pair of Kerry Martin and
Pauline McLean.
Hope and Martin, who have represented Britain at youth and senior
level respectively, already have made their mark at student level this
season, with record-breaking performances in the British university
short-course championships.

SUPPORTERS of Lochaber District Council's suspended chief executive Mr
David Blair are due to march through the centre of Fort William this
morning as councillors prepare to resume their disciplinary hearing
against Mr Blair.
The issue has bitterly divided the 15-member council. Mr Blair was
suspended in September. This followed reports from the council's
internal auditors covering various matters including a premature payment
on a grant to Fort William Golf Club.
Mr Blair appealed unsuccessfully to the Court of Session and an
investigation committee was set up which recommended disciplinary
action. The disciplinary committee met before Christmas and began to
hear evidence, adjourning until today.
Mr Blair is being defended by the GMB Scotland union.
Yesterday, the GMB's chief negotiator for Scottish local authorities,
Mr Robert Parker, said: ''Backed by the GMB, Mr Blair has strenuously
denied the charges against him and we are certain he has no case to
answer.
''When Mr Blair was suspended last September by the SNP-led majority
on the council, the GMB called for an independent inquiry into the whole
matter. Because he has absolutely nothing to hide, Mr Blair welcomed the
call but not one of the SNP-led majority of eight has done the same.
''Two of these councillors are now under police investigation.''
Yesterday, Mr Finlay MacLennan, Deputy Chief Constable of the Northern
Constabulary, said: ''In October of last year, two letters were received
by police which, after consultation with the regional procurator-fiscal,
in Aberdeen, led to an investigation into the allegations made.
Inquiries are continuing.''

FRENCH drivers occupied the first three places yesterday as Pierre
Lartigue, last year's winner, increased his lead over Bruno Saby with
just four days to go in the Paris-Dakar rally.
The Citroen driver yesterday gained almost half-an-hour on 1993
champion Saby, whose Mitsubishi was hampered by mechanical problems, to
give himself a comfortable cushion of 49min 27sec over his nearest
rival.
In third place was Jean-Pierre Fontenay, who leapfrogged Japan's
Kenjiro Shinozuka, a Mitsubishi team-mate.
The past few days have seen the non-French challenge disintegrate with
four-times winner Ari Vatanen, of Finland, forced out of contention
after breaking a radiator and his compatriot Timo Salonen dropping back
with mechanical problems.
But the motorcycle section promises an exciting finish. France's
Stephane Peterhansel on a Yamaha won the tenth leg over 504km from
Tidjikja to close the gap on leader Jordi Arcarons of Spain to just 4min
34sec. Peterhansel, who won the rally three times in succession from
1991, expects to put serious pressure on his Cagiva rival. Leading
standings:

FIFE Flyers have stepped up their campaign to have walk-out marksman
Tony Szabo banned. He left ice hockey's premier division club last week
only hours after having been given an assurance by Flyers' management
that they would honour his contract for the rest of this season.
The American is believed to be at home in West Virginia.
Flyers have asked the British Ice Hockey Association to suspend Szabo,
and Saunders revealed that they also have contacted the International
Hockey League and the East Coast Hockey League in the USA to explain the
situation.
Stewart Saunders, Flyers' team manager, said: ''Tony was assured by us
that we would honour his contract, and you don't dismiss a guy who is in
the top-10 scoring charts.
''He left us in the lurch. We've got Ryan Kummu out through injury,
our top scorer Mark Morrison was sidelined with injury last weekend, and
one of our leading young players, Derek King, suffered severe jarring of
the spine in an accident on Sunday.
''We needed Tony but he decided to go and we are determined to try and
make sure he doesn't play for anybody else. That's why we are letting as
many people know what he did to us.''
Flyers are almost certain once again to rely on their emerging
youngsters for this weekend's home double-header against Humberside on
Saturday, and Basingstoke the following day. Edinburgh Racers also have
a home double-header, against Bracknell and then Humberside.
* THE National Hockey League Players' Association last night accepted
the final offer from club owners to save the season -- subject to
ratification by the 700 union members.
* PAISLEY Pirates last night signed former Great Britain
internationalist Bobby Haig from first division rivals Dumfries Vikings.

SCOTLAND'S newly-formed American football team now have the services
of a top US college coach.
The Scottish Claymores, based at Murrayfield and who will play in the
six-club World League, have signed former Washington Redskins
quarterback Doug Williams as a wide-receivers' coach.
Williams turned down an offer to continue at the US Naval Academy,
where he was quarterback coach last year, to team up with Claymores'
American head coach, Lary Kuharich.
* THE Los Angeles Rams look set to move to St Louis. The switch, which
would require NFL approval, could also include the sale of 40% of the
club to Missouri businessman Stan Kroenke, who is expected to pay around
#50m.

ANDREI Medvedev was upset with tennis officials at the New South Wales
Open yesterday after having tumbled out in the second round to
little-known Australian Michael Tebbutt.
The No.2 seed, who lost 5-7, 6-1, 6-2, was on an outside court. ''I
thought I would be on centre court against an Australian,'' said the
Ukrainian. ''That court feels small. I felt I didn't have any room to
run and like he was serving from the middle of the court.''
Tebbutt, a wild-card entry, joined three other Australians -- Jamie
Morgan, Mark Woodforde, and Richard Fromberg -- in the last eight.
Morgan came through in an absorbing match with compatriot Todd
Woodbridge, winning 4-6, 6-4, 7-5.
Fromberg set up a quarter-final with Davis Cup team-mate Woodforde
thanks to a 6-3, 6-3 win over American Aaron Krickstein after Woodforde
had defeated No.8 seed Karel Novacek 6-3, 6-4.
In the women's singles, No.2 seed Gabriela Sabatini struggled with the
wind before overcoming Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu 6-2, 6-3 in their
second-round encounter, while Australia's Nicole Bradtke capped an
outstanding day for the host country by beating Dutch No.5 seed Brenda
Schultz 6-0, 7-6.
* BRITAIN'S Jeremy Bates crashed out in the second round of the New
Zealand Open in Auckland, beaten 6-2, 6-4 by second seed Alexander
Volkov.
* THE new-look Andre Agassi, with cropped hair revealing premature
balding, lasted just 52 minutes in his match with Patrick Rafter before
the Australian won 6-3, 6-2 in the International Challenge exhibition
event in Adelaide.
* JENNIFER Duncan was the only one of three Scots competing in the
Reebok British Tour event at Telford yesterday to survive the opening
round.
The 18-year-old defeated Oxfordshire's Imogen Wyatt 6-3, 6-1, earning
her a clash with No.4 seed Anne Simpkin.
Scotland's Nicola Burns was beaten 6-4, 6-1 by Libby Fletcher, while
Phil Cooper edged past Scottish No.3 Ken Wood 7-6, 7-6.

STEPHEN Hendry did not live up to his own expectations in the #300,000
Liverpool/Victoria Charity Challenge at Birmingham last night.
The world champion was far from happy with his performance, despite
reaching the quarter-finals by beating Belfast's Joe Swail 5-2. Hendry
said: ''It wasn't a good show from me. My concentration was poor and I
never really got going.''
A break of 71 got Hendry off to a flying start, but he had to rely on
an elementary mistake from Swail to add the second frame.
Leading 62-50, world No.12 Swail seemed certain to level at 1-1, but
he missed a straightforward pink off its spot. Taking advantage, Hendry
potted pink and black to steal the frame by a single point for 2-0 and
he quickly opened up a 4-0 lead at the interval.
Swail, who whitewashed Hendry 5-0 in a qualifying round of the 1992
Asian Open, avoided a taste of his own medicine by winning the following
two frames with runs of 62 and 110, but he could make no further impact.
Hendry stopped the Irishman's comeback dead in its tracks with a
decisive 53 break in frame seven and will now meet Ronnie O'Sullivan
tomorrow.
The Scot, winner of the UK championship and European Open before
Christmas, has now won 12 consecutive matches.
Alan McManus booked his quarter-final place -- and then set his sights
on the trophy.
The Scot, who beat Nigel Bond 5-3 in the tournament's opening match,
said: ''For some reason I've got a funny feeling about winning the title
this week.''
World No.6 McManus has had a lean time since he captured the Dubai
Classic in October, but he feels further success is just around the
corner.
''I've been working really hard on my game, because the next three
months are so important, and I feel very relaxed,'' said McManus, who
has now recorded seven straight victories over Bond. McManus meets John
Parrott tomorrow.
Whatever happens then, McManus is already guaranteed #12,500 for the
charity he is representing, the Abbey Field Development Trust.
A jet-lagged Parrott, who returned from a five-day trip to South
Africa only on Tuesday, admitted to being ''absolutely knackered'' after
beating Peter Ebdon 5-2.
''I was guessing how to hit most of the safety shots, because I
couldn't see the balls properly,'' said the 1991 World and UK champion
from Liverpool. ''I was dog-tired, but the biggest factor for me was
that I tried really hard.''
Parrott, in South Africa for the World Trick Shots championship,
added: ''I'm sure I'll be okay for my match against Alan. Since I
reached the final of the European Open last month I've been playing
great.''
Ronnie O'Sullivan joined the quarter-finals with a 5-4 victory over
David Roe.
O'Sullivan, last season's UK and British Open champion, looked
destined for an early exit when Roe grabbed a 4-3 lead with breaks of
73, 40, 65, and 48.
But Roe, who has a history of losing deciding-frame finishes against
snooker's big names, failed to win either of the closing two frames.

A JUDGE yesterday ordered the confiscation of nearly #42,000 from a
drugs trafficker involved in a scheme to ''farm'' cannabis on an
industrial estate unit.
Car dealer James Quinn, 35, formerly of Nevis Crescent, Alloa,
Clackmannanshire, is currently serving 10 years for drugs offences,
after being convicted at the High Court in Edinburgh in July last year.
The court was told that about #25,000 had been invested in the scheme
to grow cannabis on a large scale at a unit on the Bandeath Industrial
Estate at Throsk, Stirlingshire, at the beginning of 1993.
However, the operation ran into technical problems and by the time
police moved in, in February last year, the 25,000 ''seed'' capital was
largely exhausted. The crop, which fell into the hands of the police,
had an estimated value of #54,000.
Quinn was convicted of producing the cannabis and of being concerned
in the supply of amphetamine.
At the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday temporary judge Hazel Aronson
was due to hear evidence in an attempt by the Crown to confiscate assets
from Quinn.
However, Mr Scott Brady, Advocate-depute, informed the judge that a
figure of #41,865 had been agreed and she made a confiscation order for
that amount.

SHINTY'S leading sides will have an eye on more than the weather this
weekend with their names going into the hat for the fourth round of the
game's blue riband, the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup.
The minnows have mainly gone their own way, although the two
qualifying cup finals in the north and south have still to be resolved.
The clubs still involved -- Lovat and Caberfeidh in the north and
Glenorchy in the south, along with the winners of Saturday's semi-final
between Glasgow University and Strachur -- will join the elite in
tomorrow night's draw.
Kingussie, who were unceremoniously dumped out of last year's
competitions by Newtonmore, but who have lost just one league match this
season, will again start favourites in the cup, with Fort William and
Oban Camanachd in hot pursuit.
The big question is whether last year's surprise winners, Kyles --
victorious for the first time in 11 years -- can go anywhere near
repeating their remarkable feat.
Their league form to date suggests that they will not, but the cup has
always been the Kames side's forte and they are capable of raising their
game. If they get a favourable draw and steer clear of injuries, they
could well cause problems, particularly on their home patch.
Kyles play host to Oban Camanachd on Saturday in a Celtic Society Cup
tie and will be using their second field at Kilbride if it is playable.
If not, the game will be switched to Oban.
Glenorchy have also pressed their second pitch at Craig into operation
as the recent spell of bad weather takes its toll. They are due to meet
Glasgow Mid Argyll, who could be a good bet for a strong run in the
Celtic Society Cup.
In the north, it is very much a case of top meeting bottom in the
league with Kingussie probably having the easiest task of the day, at
home to Lochaber, whose form has completely deserted them.
Newtonmore go to Lovat and Skye go to Beauly. These two games are
crucial as Skye and Lovat fight it out for the crucial fourth place in
the north's first division, which carries with it qualification to the
new national league.
Fort William, meanwhile, go to Glenurquhart, where they tend to
struggle. However, they will be spurred on by the thought that maximum
points will keep the pressure on Kingussie as the title race reaches a
climax.
With the foul weather liable to affect matches across the country,
early pitch inspections are the order of the day and clubs have been
instructed to carry these out tomorrow night. However, most teams will
leave final deisions until Saturday morning and travellers are advised
to check their matches are on before setting off.

MARTIN and Roy Goodlad leave for Australia today to become the first
Scottish crew to compete in the world 18-foot skiff championships.
The event will be raced off Sydney Harbour, synonymous with the
high-performance, three-person dinghies, and between 30 and 40 boats are
expected.
While the class has its origins in Sydney, where there is a local
circuit of dozens of these highly sponsored boats, all supporting
massive rigs with 900 square foot asymmetric spinnakers, this year's
championships include six British boats as well as entries from Japan,
Sweden, and New Zealand.
At an all-inclusive cost for a competitive new boat of #17,500, the
spread of the 18-foot skiff has been slow in this country, although a
British Grand Prix circuit and a European circuit are now thriving with
privately and commercially funded boats.
The Goodlad brothers, both students, have pioneered the class in
Scotland for the past two-and-a-half years, and after having paid their
dues at the tail end of the skiff circuit races in the UK, and racing
last year on the European circuit in Switzerland, France, and Italy,
theyu now are ranked fourth in Britain.
Their second boat developed a split between hull and deck and their
insurers replaced it with a boat which will allow them to compete on
equal terms with the Australians.
While their competition, at the front end of the world championship
fleet, is supported by major sponsorship, their campaign to date has
been funded by student loans and occasional jobs.
A grant from ''Sail Scotland,'' the marketing amalgam of local
enterprise companies and tourist boards who aim to promote Scotland's
watersports, has allowed them new sails for this important regatta.
''At first the learning curve was steep,'' said Marton. ''The skiff is
a very demanding boat and we made lots of very wet mistakes, but now we
have done a lot of racing and through the summer, when we've not got
regattas to race at, we'll train four or five nights a week off
Prestwick.
''I feel we should be able to get into the top 10 at these
championships.''
The third member of the crew called off due to a lack of money, and,
although their boat was already en-route for Sydney, they could not find
a third crew member with the right experience But a last-minute
replacement was found in Graham Lloyd, an Australian with whom they
finished fourth in the 18 Skiff Autumn Series at Grafham Water, near
London, last season.

Legendary big-screen tough guy Clint Eastwood is the man with no shame
concerning his latest film which casts him completely against type as a
sensitive, caring individual in a slushy and sentimental love story, as
Douglas Thompson discovers
CLINT EASTWOOD got a little more attention after he had shot 28 people
in 98 minutes in a Fistful of Dollars. At the end of that film, made a
disquieting 30 years ago, he rode off into the sunset on a mule. He
should have been on a thoroughbred.
It was the foundation of a career which has been box office and, more
recently, Oscar heavy. It's a credible achievement if you recall it was
built on a razor-challenged character in a poncho munching cigarillos.
Also, he was not just The Man With No Name but the Man With No Dialogue.
In the Sergio Leone pasta panics it was all grunts and guns.
Now, Eastwood, action man, Dirty Harry, the chilly-eyed icon of the
Vietnam era, the iced-water peeing killer of his Oscar-bonanza
Unforgiven, an actor who has established himself as a major Hollywood
power-broker by spilling other people's blood and guts on screen, who
made his name and millions on the gunslinger genre, has gone mushy on
us.
If not The Railway Children, his latest movie is close. Eastwood is
the director and co-star with Meryl Streep of The Bridges of Madison
County. The story is so sentimental and romantic that the clever among
us should be buying Kleenex shares for it is more make-me-weep than
make-my-day.
The film based on Robert James Waller's cloying and manipulative novel
-- whatever your view it has become one of the biggest international
hardback sellers of all time -- was an instant Tinseltown tidbit. Steven
Spielberg won the auction for the rights.
And from the moment Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment announced
production plans, the guessing game began over who would play the
sensitive, understanding, rugged individualist National Geographic
photographer who has a brief, but passionate, affair with a lonely Iowa
farm woman in the 1960s.
The cinema audience is guaranteed. Even if the film barks, there are
millions world-wide who will pay to see it. In America alone there have
been 60 printings of The Bridges of Madison County, more than 10 million
copies of the 171-page love story have been sold, and, since publication
in 1992, it has been on the New York Times bestseller list.
This is over-the-rainbow gold dust material. Of course, everyone
wanted their fingers in this particular pot. Robert Redford, Michael
Douglas and Harrison Ford were the first names for the role of
photographer Robert Kincaid.
Choices for the woman who mists his lens, the Italian-born war bride
Francesca Johnson, ran riot: Anjelica Huston, Lena Olin, Sonia Braga,
Peralla August, Mary McDonnell, Annette Bening, Isabella Rossellini,
Cher, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mercedes Ruehl and Kate Capshaw
-- aka Mrs Steven Spielberg.
The casting took longer than the novel's four-days of loving which
results in 24 years of wondering and yearning. With hindsight Eastwood
and Streep seem a perfect match. But Clint as sensitive man?
''It's not a stretch,'' he says in that confident and comfortable
drawl. ''I can understand the emotions of the piece. After a time people
perceive you as a one-dimensional sort of character but we grow, we
change.'
He's changed. He is a grandfather and last year became a father again
when his partner, the actress Frances Fisher, gave birth to a daughter
who they named Francesca after the character from The Bridges of Madison
County. It seems a New Man sort of situation. But Eastwood will have
none of that nonsense. ''It's a nice name -- we had to call her
something!''
He has two grown-up children, Alison and Kyle, from his marriage to
his only wife Maggie. He had a 13-year relationship with the actress
Sondra Locke but that ended in acrimony and the Californian courts in
1989. She made severe allegations that Eastwood had forced her to have
abortions and be sterilised. The mess appeared to have been concluded
with a multi-million dollar settlement.
But, just as the romantic Bridges of Madison County concluded filming
in Madison County, Iowa -- Kincaid is sent there on assignment to
photograph the bridges of the region -- Ms Locke, 47 interrupted
Eastwood's life again.
She claims in a lawsuit filed this month in Los Angeles Superior Court
that Warner Brothers film studios, Eastwood's long-time ''home'', were
involved in fraud and breach of contract over the financial arrangements
agreed after she and the film star separated. Her lawsuit which works
out at #25m maintains that she was the victim of a ''sweetheart deal''.
Instead of receiving #16m, she says it was reduced to a token sum and
that her three-year acting and production contract with Warner came to
nothing. Every project she put forward was rejected.
The millions she was widely reported to have received in fact amounted
to a quarter of a million pounds and #70,000 in legal fees. The
''gravy'' was the Warner Studios contract which she now insists has
added up to nothing.
Eastwood will not now be drawn on the Sondra Locke issue. When she
first entangled him in that spaghetti of paperwork in Los Angeles
Superior Court, he did offer: ''I feel so disappointed -- and the
disappointment is with myself. How could I spend so many years with
Sondra? How could I have been such a bad judge of character?
''It's not at all classy. At some point a person has to make up their
mind whether they want to be a film director or an ex-girlfriend. I
gather the people who advised her thought I would be brought to my knees
by some public humiliation. Well, they didn't read me right. They
misread me by thinking that making false statements would flush me into
some giveaway programme.''
Eastwood has never given away anything. He's worked hard and long for
his success, but he's always been willing to take a risk. And, because
of his phenomenal success with action/adventure films, Warner Brothers
have been happy to indulge him in projects like 1988's Bird in which he
told the story of jazzman Charlie ''Yardbird'' Parker. Or with 1990's
White Hunter, Black Heart, which was a thinly-veiled look at John
Huston's making of The African Queen.
But Eastwood always paid his dues. For every Bird there was a Dirty
Harry picture, or Westerns like 1985's Pale Rider, or the
already-classic Unforgiven which collected seven Oscars two years ago.
More mellow, happy with a young baby, The Bridges of Madison County
appeared an attractive idea. The story is essentially a character piece
with the two main roles, the fortysomething woman and the handsome
fiftysomething stranger, providing a showcase for the talent involved.
Meryl Streep was not an easy catch. ''I didn't like the book but that
may just be me,'' she said. ''However, the script for the film was
wonderful. I wasn't shattered by the book as many people were. For me it
was not a religious experience, but the film is something else. And
Clint is going to surprise many people with what he has created. All the
emotion is there.''
She dyed her blonde hair brown with reddish highlights for the role of
Francesca. Eastwood just had to be himself. He may be 64, but as the
novel's 52-year-old Kincaid, he is easily acceptable, as was the
production in the rural town of Winterset, Iowa, (population 4209) where
many of the locals earned pocket money as extras. ''Everyone was helpful
and wanted to enjoy the idea of the film,'' said Eastwood, adding:
''When you get out of the Hollywood environment it's a pleasant surprise
just how co-operative people can be.
''I feel very comfortable with the movie. I don't find it any
different from other material I have worked with. There is love,
conflict, and fear.
''And they are basic emotions in real and movie life. This is a warm
movie for me -- and, yes, maybe it is the time and the circumstances
which want me to work with material like this.''
Eastwood has to wield a camera rather than a Magnum in the film and
was trained by veteran American photographer Ken Regan. He said: ''In
teaching Clint how to use a camera -- Nikon F, circa 1964 -- I was
surprised how quickly he adapted. He has a natural mechanical ability, a
defined visual sense, a sharp eye, and he notices things others might
miss. After editing his first photos, I gave him a B+.''

AFTER more than two years out of competitive athletics, the Moroccan
middle-distance world record breaker, Said Aouita, is attempting a
comeback. More magic or just a mirage?
THE Arabian Knight, Said Aouita, most prolific athletics world
record-breaker of the past decade, will emerge from retirement tomorrow
in Ontario for a race which will determine whether the sand has run out
on his competitive career.
The Moroccan is to contest the 3000 metres, a distance at which he
once was world indoor champion and held the world outdoor record, in the
Hamilton Spectator meeting, first major event on the international
indoor circuit this winter.
Aouita, arguably the world's greatest distance runner ever, has not
raced in two years, but approached meeting officials himself, agreeing
to appear for a fee well below the $30,000 which was his asking price
during his supreme era which embraced six world records.
With the modesty which typified him during that time, the 35-year-old
Aouita confesses to having done just six weeks' training, but asserts:
''I am in very good shape and want to run indoors. If it goes well, I
will race outdoors, too.''
Cynics will link Aouita's return to the loss of his job as national
director of coaching. The Moroccan federation president is a member of
King Hassan's bodyguard and knows nothing of the sport, but Aouita's
proteges defeated the Ethiopians and last year threatened Kenya's world
cross-country supremacy.
Or perhaps it is the need to pay the bills at his second home, in San
Diego, while maintaining the family's palatial establishment on the
outskirts of Casablanca. The furnishings of one opulent Moroccan salon
alone cost $140,000 from his mid-eighties winnings.
A devout Muslim, you could always spot Aouita in a bar. He was the man
putting ice on his legs, not in his drink. He nevertheless buried his
principles to pile up a fortune running in the colours of Larios, the
Spanish drinks conglomerate, while claiming not to be a wealthy man.
He insists his return -- nearly 21 laps of Hamilton's 143-metre
circuit -- is serious, though he is nervous about its tight bends.
Leading milers such as John Walker, Sydney Maree, Steve Scott, Mike
Hilardt, and Marcus O'Sullivan have all run there, but only O'Sullivan,
former three-time world indoor 1500m champion, has ever broken four
minutes.
The track record for 3000m is 8min 02sec, but Aouita has indicated he
will be happy only with a time inside eight minutes.
''He is also nervous about flying in here in a light aircraft,'' said
Paul Gaines, one of the meeting organisers. ''There are too many plane
crashes in North America. I'll only come if it is a jet,'' Aouita warned
Gaines, who has made the appropriate travel arrangements.
Hamilton, of course, is famous for comebacks. It is where the Seoul
Olympic 100m drug cheat, Ben Johnson, made his ill-fated return, a
stumbling performance by the mumbling Canadian.
But fluency off track is guaranteed by Aouita, who is comfortable in
five languages and determined to prove he can still run as good a race
as he talks. Though he has been sharpening up in California for just six
weeks, he says he had never stopped running.
After Canada, he will tackle the Millrose Games in New York then,
possibly, some European events. That might, he says, tempt him back for
the World outdoor championships, in Gothenburg this summer, perhaps at
1500m rather than 5000, which was his most consistent distance.
''Everything has changed so much,'' said the Casablanca Express. ''Ten
years ago there was 20 seconds between me and the rest of the world at
5000m. But now there are 20 men capable of doing 13-05. On the other
hand, in the 1500m, after Noureddine Morceli and Venuste Nyongabo, there
is a huge gap. Maybe I can still plug that.''
There was little to hint at Aouita's future prowess in 1978 when, for
4000m, he led the World Junior Cross Country Championships in the mud of
Glasgow's Bellahouston Park before fading to finish thirty-fourth.
''It was very cold, and I was very unhappy because I wanted to win,''
he recalled. ''I vowed I would never run so badly again.''
Injury, and operations on both legs, explain Aouita's failure to
fulfil the Olympic promise hinted at after 5000m gold in Los Angeles.
But gold at that distance in the 1987 World outdoor championships, and
the World indoor 3000m crown in 1989, confirm a championship status to
match his record breaking.
He set word bests at 1500m and 5000m in 1985; at two miles, and 2000m
and 5000m in '87; and at 3000m in '89. At his peak, Aouita held two of
the three best times at 1500m and the mile, five out of seven at 3000m,
and six out of 10 at 5000m.
He was unbeaten at 5000m from 1979-89, finally losing to Yobes
Ondieki. After his defeat by Steve Cram, when the Geordie broke the
1500m world best in Nice in 1985, Aouita won 44 consecutive races at all
distances, and remained unbeaten at 1500m and the mile until 1991.
What makes a man such as this, with nothing to prove, come back again?
Ask Ali, Sinatra or Foreman. But on the track there is no hiding place.
The clock cannot lie, nor conceal a croaking voice. Gaines has promised
a pacemaker to ensure a real race. The Moroccan ambassador has been
invited.
As a boy, Aouita always lost at running games, but became so good at
them that his king bestowed honours and titles, the keys to the city of
Casablanca, and the use of his private helicopter.
Volatile as a desert sandstorm, like any Arab he is fiecely conscious
of his dignity, almost obsessed. So his indoor return will be no sham.
But further titles or records would require the magic of a tale from
Scheherazade. They will surely remain a mirage.

MORE than 500 mourners heard yesterday of a man who was able to joke
with colleagues in the final days of his illness, cancer.
Lord Provost James Shields, 65, died on Friday after six months in
office. He had succeed Lord Provost Robert Innes, who also died in
office.
The Lord Provost was cremated after a civic funeral service in the
City Chambers at which he was described by the Very Rev William Morris,
Minister at Glasgow Cathedral, as ''a man of honesty, integrity, and
ability''.
During an emotional tribute, his close friend and colleague, Bailie
James Mutter, said James Shields was a man who had not changed despite
being elevated to the city's highest office.
He recalled one of his final visits with a colleague to the Lord
Provost, during which both of them received advice on healthy diet.
The Lord Provost had told them to eat porridge and have everything
grilled. Then, realising the irony of the situation, he had remarked:
''Some bloody good it did me.''
Among the mourners at the City Chambers and Linn Park Crematorium were
Lord Provost Norman Irons of Edinburgh and the provosts of seven
district councils, as well as church and business leaders.

* ANGELLA Issajenko, the 1986 Commonwealth Games sprint champion who
admitted to using drugs at the Canadian government inquiry in the wake
of Ben Johnson's doping offence in Seoul, runs her first major race in
six years at tomorrow's meeting.
''I'm a lot slimmer than when I was using Winstrol B,'' says
Issajenko, now 36 and mother of four children.

NORWEGIAN sprinter Aham Okeke has tested positive for doping for the
second time in five months, Norway's Athletics Association said
yesterday.
Okeke, ruled out of last year's European championships in Helsinki
after failing a dope test, was later cleared by the Norwegian Sports
Court. But the result of a random test taken on December 5 during
training at the Texas university where he studies showed Okeke had
tested positive again.

KENYAN runners are ready for a revolt which could have serious
repercussions for the country's international athletics championship
supremacy. The country's president, Daniel arap Moi, has warned he will
disband the Kenya Amateur Athletics Association if the row is not
resolved.
For years leading performers have been infuriated by corruption in the
KAAA. Former secretary Robert Ouko was discredited for withholding money
from competitors. He pocketed the proceeds of a double international
victory in Japan, and 1987 world 10,000 metres champion, Paul Kipkoech,
a former winner of the Great Scottish Run, blames him for the loss of
$66,000 of his money.
Now a group of the country's champions, backed by an Italian company,
is promoting a rebel series of races in defiance of the KAAA, who say
participants may be suspended.
Peter Rono (former Olympic 1500m champion), Moses Tanui (former world
10,000m champion), Nixon Kiprotich (Olympic 800m runner-up), and Sammy
Koskei (double African champion at 800m) are organising three events.
But KAAA chairman Isaiah Kiplagat said yesterday they will not
sanction a cross-country race in Eldoret on January 29, a marathon at
the foot of Mount Kenya on February 2, and a half marathon in Nairobi
three days later.
''Any athletes who participate in these events will be severely
disciplined,'' said Kiplagat. ''The motive is mainly to destabilise
KAAA, and we shall not allow anyone to do that. Punishment would include
a ban.''
The KAAA has ruthlesly omitted from World and Olympic teams champions
who reported just a day late for training, so the threat is not idle.
Ulf Saletti, of the UK management agency KIM, which looks after the
affairs of some 40 Kenyan runners world-wide, confirms that he witnessed
a meeting of the rebel runners at a restaurant in Eldoret just before
new year.
''They seem determined to go ahead,'' said Saletti, whose employers
enjoy good relations with the KAAA. But he conceded that even some of
their runners may defy the ban.
Another UK agent, John Bicourt, who is banned by the KAAA, acts for
some 20 Kenyans who have elected to ignore their governing body. Among
them is Tanui, who was not at his home in Eldoret yesterday, but Bicourt
confirmed that Tanui has had discussions with the country's president.
''Moi has threatened to disolve the KAAA if this dispute is not
settled,'' said Bicourt.
Moi, a fervent athletics fan, regularly awards the nation's highest
honour, the Order of the Burning Spear, to champion athletes, and he is
understood to be furious at the corruption and political in-fighting in
the national sport.
Yobes Ondieki, the world's former 10,000m record holder, said:
''Athletes like myself are fighting against the federation. We want it
to disband. The officials should all be thrown out. A lot of money is
coming into Kenya from sponsors, from athletes, from foreign countries,
but we don't see where it is going.''
He believes these funds, including $2m from a sports footwear firm,
should be spent in Kenya, encouraging Kenyans not to globetrot, and
killing the development of the sport in Britain where they dominate
every endurance event.

Your front-page report (January 4) did not state that on December 30,
1994, we did apply to Glasgow City Council for outline planning
permission in the name of ''Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 and others'' to
form ''a mixed development, tourist, leisure, business, and commercial,
with a permanent garden festival and maritime heritage theme as its
core, with science centre, civic street, and public park''.
We are pleased to report that the public is responding to the offer to
be included among ''the others''. So far East Kilbride, Pollokshields,
Dumbreck, Kilcreggan, Torrance, Govan, Jordanhill, Shawlands, Kinning
Park, and Maryhill are represented. A firm of lawyers has contributed
#10 -- for each of its 10 partners.
In notifying the owners of the land we wrote: ''There is a widespread
concern that Glasgow is not continuing the momentum of the garden
festival and the year of culture. Although the accolade of City of
Architecture and Design 1999 is another fillip, it has to be seen
whether by our actions we deserve that title.
''Glasgow's bid for the City of Architecture and Design 1999 states:
'Glasgow will . . . make opportunities for people of all ages to
participate in the architecture and design process.'
''So that these words have some meaning for this huge site, the
importance of which, to Glasgow and Scotland, cannot be exaggerated, we
have produced an alternative masterplan, so that there can be discussion
and choice for the people of Glasgow.
''Of course all the proposals have to make economic sense, not only in
making a commercial return on capital expended but in the resulting
economic benefit to the community. GDA and Scottish Enterprise have both
stated that they would love either to do a Tivoli if it can be achieved
financially or have nothing against one.
''Our business advisers are quietly confident. However, the advent of
the Millennium Fund makes our proposals more credible. We shall be
applying, probably in January 1995, to the Millennium Fund and have
already had helpful discussions with the Millennium Commission.
''We would hope that, after public exposure and endorsement of our
proposals, it would be possible for the city, the region, Glasgow
Development Agency, the Scottish Office, Scottish Enterprise, and of
course the owners of the site to co-operate to mark the beginning of the
new millennium in a way that will draw the community together and make a
grand gesture and a fitting climax to the city's year of architecture
and design.
''There is an urgency for such co-operation to commence.''
We believe the people of Glasgow and district who enjoyed the garden
festival of 1988 and have so often said it should have been continued
will demonstrate to the Millennium Commission that this is a project
that Glasgow wants, by becoming one of ''the other'' applicants.

I see Pat Lally and the GDA are opposed to the proposal to carry out a
Tivoli Gardens-style development on the old garden festival site,
preferring instead a business park (January 4).
As I make my living as a commercial property development solicitor out
of developments like business parks (although I have no business
interest in this site) I suppost I'm guilty of being a poacher turned
gamekeeper, but it does seem incredible to me that our city fathers and
the GDA prefer a business park to the Tivoli Gardens proposal.
Business parks, retail parks, and the like have their place -- but
surely not in such an important city-centre location, whatever the
financial implications.
When I first came to this city to live and work nearly 13 years ago I
was overwhelmingly impressed by the drive, vivacity, and imagination
which seemed to be displayed by all those involved in the development
process, both in private and public sectors, much of it inspired by the
local authorities and the then SDA.
Now, despite being the City of Architecture and Design as the 21st
century dawns, all we are supposed to look forward to on this site is
yet another business park.

Allan Laing's diatribe on the M77 may earn full marks from the public
relations people at Wimpey Construction but his arguments in favour of
the new road are ill-informed and misleading (January 7).
We are told that ''those who want the M77 extension greatly outnumber
those who don't''. Evidence, please? The only known poll on the subject
was conducted by the Evening Times in October, 1994, and its readers
voted more than two to one against the road.
The reality is that as more and more people have been exposed to the
facts about the impact of the M77, so opposition has grown in leaps and
bounds.
Allan Laing reminds us that the M77 is ''the result of a democratic
decision'' and ''has even been the subject of a public inquiry''. Well,
yes, but the inquiry was held back in 1988 and failed to incorporate a
proper environmental impact assessment of the road, as well as rejecting
any examination of the traffic-generating impact of the M77.
Without doubt a fresh round of public consultation and a new public
inquiry in 1995 would produce an entirely different result.
The suggestion that the M77 ''will increase the commercial and
industrial potential of south-west Scotland'' is a sweeping claim which
lacks factual substance. Authoritative studies have found no evidence of
a positive relationship between road accessibility and economic
performance.
In practice it is factors such as the availability of government
grants, skilled labour, and an attractive environment which are crucial
to economic development.
As for the accident-cutting potential of the M77, the claimed 20%
reduction takes no account of the new traffic which will be generated by
the road. A sustainable alternative to the M77 -- incorporating traffic
calming, modest road building, and upgraded rail services -- would yield
substantially bigger safety benefits. Major traffic-calming initiatives
elsewhere in the UK have cut accidents by up to 80%.
The case for the M77 is so flawed it is surely no surprise that
opponents now feel obliged to resort to direct action to halt this
discredited project.

I enjoyed Bob Crampsey's article on English cricket (December 30). I
take issue with him and your correspondent Tom McConnell (January 5)
that it is mandatory for the Scottish cricket enthusiast to regard
England as ''us''.
I concede that that has traditionally been the position and one's
boyhood heroes were those whom Mr McConnell lists. I suggest that that
arose predominantly through the Anglicisation process endemic in that
era and which continues to prevail, with reports in the Scottish press
of first-class cricket being from English agencies and syndicates.
Dining privately last month in Barbados with West Indies officials I
was interested to have their confirmation of an earlier suspicion that
the original bid by Scotland for associate membership of the
International Cricket Conference failed through a perception by a
majority of the members that Scotland was part of England, at least in
cricketing matters.
That the splendid efforts of Scottish Cricket Union president Everett
and his colleagues last year to correct that misperception (if such it
was) resulted in Scotland's admission to the ICC was warmly welcomed by
them, West Indies having proposed our admission.
The platform for membership, however, is damaged -- and the original
basis of opposition perhaps justified -- by Bob Crampsey's view that in
cricket ''we'' are England.
I do not deny my compatriots the freedom to support whom they will in
test and other international cricket or the ambition of the talented
Scot to join that band of mercenaries who play under the standard of St
George.
I draw to their attention, however, that, following Scotland's overdue
admission to the ICC, last season at the Lords test, for the first time
-- and very properly -- the ground authorities flew above the home
dressing room not the Union flag but the cross of St George, while at
the Headingley test that precedent was correctly repeated and one was
proud to see the Saltire among the comprehensive display of the flags of
all ICC member countries.
When at last Scotland meet England in the final of the World Cup, do
Bob Crampsey and Tom McConnell favour the prospect of a Scottish Robin
Smith or Graham Hick playing, as these, against his native land?
Scottish cricket enthusiasts now have a choice, and while many will
continue to support our southern neighbours, for my part I am
disinclined not to include cricket in the policy: ''I support two teams
in sport -- Scotland and whoever's playing England.''

James F Smith asks Bob Crampsey why Scots should be interested in
English cricket (January 7).
One reason is that any cricketer born in the British Isles is eligible
to play for England. Some Scots have thus had the opportunity and honour
to play this splendid game at the highest level.

COWBOY quick-draw champion Bob Dixon died after being hit by two of
five bullets fired at him by police marksmen, an inquest was told in
Huddersfield. Mr Dixon, 44, of Golcar, Huddersfield, four times champion
of a national quick-draw competition, was shot dead on his doorstep by
police marksmen on December 27, following reports that he had been
firing a gun in the street. The hearing at Huddersfield was told that Mr
Dixon had used an imitation revolver and fired two shots at the police,
producing a loud bang and a flash. Police responded, hitting him once in
the chest and again in the hip. The inquest was adjourned for four weeks
to allow the Police Complaints Authority to complete its investigation.

Flower of Scotland is a pleasant enough little ditty -- an attractive
tune, and fairly rousing in a specifically Scotland v England situation
like the Calcutta Cup -- but not worthy of being a national anthem
(January 4).
However, my main objection to it is a practical one. What makes the
tune interesting is the minor note required for the syllable ''think''
in ''to think again!''
This note cannot be produced on the bagpipes.
What would be the point of having a Scottish national anthem that
cannot be played on the bagpipes?

IT'S not what you do it's the way that you do it. Presentation is
everything, especially in modern music concerts. I'm always wittering on
about that; and I'm going to do it again.
Last night's recital for the Edinburgh Contemporary Arts Trust by
virtuoso violinist Madeleine Mitchell and pianist Andrew Ball was a
formal, rather cool affair that might have been transformed with a
different presentation. When it's a smallish audience, why isn't the
piano brought off the stage and the audience built around the
performers? Proximity and intimacy are everything on these occasions.
And Madeleine Mitchell didn't help the proceedings with a large
programme of short pieces that got larger with the addition of
unscheduled items, punctuated by entrances and exits, and long breaks
between numbers. Continuity? Very little.
She played very well, by and large, though some of the music was
middle to bottom-drawer stuff -- George Crumb's pantheistic twitterings
and Henze's arid, dated expressionism to name but two.
Best were James MacMillan's two pieces, After the Tryst (a bit
hectically and over-intensely played) and his new Kiss on Wood, a
sustained contemplation whose second-half is incredibly beautiful,
suspended in time. Also top drawer was Haflidi Hallgrimmson's Offerto, a
memorial piece to a friend and an ascetic work of great intellectual
integrity and a cool beauty.
These apart, a mixed bag of pieces, with a tiny little Gorecki gem,
written for the composer's son, as a throwaway beauty.

EVEN Capercaillie's most ardent fans must have been worried about
their 1994 activities: tours disrupted by illness, and an album of
re-workings that perhaps went too far in its attempts to satisfy record
company rather than artistic needs.
Last night, however, was one of reaffirmation, with all the band's
more admirable qualities very much to the fore.
Where in the past their shows have never quite found the balance
between the vocal and the instrumental, the jigs and the ballads, the
Gaelic and the English, the old and the new, last night delivered all of
the above in just about the correct measures.
Karen Matheson's voice, probably the finest of the entire Celtic
Connections festival, was given plenty of chances to star in a venue
well suited to its expansiveness. The inclusion of a high proportion of
Gaelic songs showed that this is a voice whose beauty transcends the
mere barriers of linguistics.
For a percussive seven-piece band, Matheson's musical backdrop is
remarkably uncluttered, and for traditional musicians the sound is
surprisingly adaptable to both funk grooves and world-music rhythms.
The songs remain more of an enigma. The recent single, Miracle of
Being, is a good example of their meandering harmonic ambience, its
tasteful restraint unlikely to trouble too many playlist meetings.
Elsewhere Crime of Passion and Hold Me Down are pacific rather than
invigorating, while Four Stone Walls manages to reflect their cultural
heritage in the form of an accessible tune.
Capercaillie's vibrance and performance did much to assure that their
continued relevance spreads well beyond Hogmanay Specials and specialist
Gaelic programming.

The rantings of James Anderson are typical of the Euro-sceptic
minority on the right of the Tory party (January 4). He criticises Brian
Meek for ridiculing this faction with ''cheap and snide remarks'', but
the simple truth is that to get your message through to this sort of
person you have to descend to their level.
Brian Meek calls Anderson, his ''friend'' Teddy Taylor, and others
like them ''English nationalists''. He is quite correct. They will go on
waving their Union Jacks and singing Rule Britannia until they drop,
which, for the sake of party unity, is hopefully in the not too distant
future.
Anderson's phrase, ''German, French, and Italian friends in his
beloved Europe'', positively reeks of the attitude which gave us two
world wars and which has split Europe for a long time. I would tend to
call it fascism.
We are trying to get rid of these attitudes and to forge a better,
more co-operative, more harmonious Europe. We could do without the
xenophobia of these people.

ON little magazines it's a dog's life. They come, they go. Some run
about madly in circles, chasing their tails, barking worse than they
bite. Others become pets. The Journalist's Handbook sits and stays.
For reaching its tenth birthday let us give it a bone.
If 10 years seem not a big bite out of the history of newsprint, in
little-magazine terms it is yonks. For doggy arithmetic applies. A small
mag's years have to be multiplied by seven for its true age in human
terms.
By that reckoning The Journalist's Handbook has -- improbably, against
the odds, and maybe magically -- reached three score years and 10, worth
a shout here.
Agreed that its impeccably printed pages are not for public
consumption. They are trade only. Agreed also that civilians would have
a hard job putting their hands on a copy if they felt a strange need to.
Yet innocent bystanders do have a weird fascination for the newspaper
game. It is much like the hobby of turning over stones to see what
crawls out from underneath.
From the anniversary issue it emerges that what journalists think
about themselves is not much different from what readers think.
One contributor unearths an ancient opinion poll that rated newspaper
people lower on the totem poll of general esteem than estate agents.
Another contributor reckons only politicians are more verminous. Oddly,
the chance is missed to add hospital managers to the bottom rung of
human endeavour.
So for innocent eyes the Handbook offers a peek at the pits. Suitably,
the magazine marks its tenth birthday card with 10 of the dumber ideas
of the decade (conspicuously, the newspaper obituaries for Robert
Maxwell) and 10 things said that were better unsaid.
Mort Zuckerman, owner of the New York Daily News, is made famous for
10 years for his quote: ''Women prefer tabloids because their arms are
shorter.''
Even in the scrolls of a venerable paper like The Herald 10 years are
a long time. For some they were even longer. During the Handbook's span
Punch magazine died. So did New Society. So did the Sheffield Morning
Telegraph. Television's Weekend World also went the way of all flesh.
The roll call of personal casualties enshrines John Arlott, Osbert
Lancaster, Leonard Parkin, Harold Hobson. Columnists were grimly reaped
-- George Gale, Jean Rook, Jill Tweedie, Noel Whitcomb. Other deaths
included Edward Hulton, founder of Picture Post magazine, if anybody
remembers. But the epochal departure was of Fleet Street. The one-time
street of adventure put up road-closed signs.
While the British trade lost its village headquarters, it retains its
village voice. The Handbook lives. Oddly (perhaps it is not odd at all)
it has Scottish roots, specifically in Ayrshire, or as the birthday book
self-deprecatingly puts it, in ''darkest'' Ayrshire.
From her editor's chair in Irvine new town Fiona MacDonald sees such
apartness as strength. ''In London,'' she explained, ''you might feel
constrained to be favourable towards people because you might meet them
after work in a wine bar.''
With a firm hand she rules gently. For each quarter's issue she spends
a week filleting the mailing list. Being on it has become a badge of
recognition. Fail to do the business and you are off.
In the beginning the Handbook was more a pocket booklet. Its slim
contents were mainly an events calendar. Now in paperback-book format,
its plump pages are adorned by some of the most hallowed names in the
trade who share their thoughts and sometimes their shame about what
depths their vocation has attained.
But sackcloth and ashes do not explain success. How the Handbook
thrives has had to do with how it defies conventional wisdom. Apart from
the geographical eccentricity of her base, Fiona MacDonald, the second
editor, has a cool innocence about the paper game. She was a sociology
graduate and former radio producer before becoming a touch judge of the
inky game.
Not only is her magazine delivered free, it has no visible means of
support, being without obvious advertising.
So classily classified are the ads, they do not look like ads at all.
They are called Sources of Information. Organisations (among them public
companies, tourist places, some charities, various pressure groups, and
other such gangs) buy space at the back of the magazine to tell who they
are and what they do.
Five good companions have stayed with The Journalist's Handbook in
every issue from the very first. Along with two building societies are
the British Heart Foundation, the National Association of Estate Agents
that the anniversary issue is so cheeky about, and BLESMA, the British
Limbless Ex-Service Men's Association, of Chadwell Heath, Essex.
''Bless BLESMA,'' they breathe at the Handbook's publishers, Carrick
Media.
Their most telling trick is gratis distribution. Their quarterly
review drops on executive desks as if heaven-sent. Editors and such
accept their Handbook while keeping their hands in their pockets.
''Journalists are not in the habit of paying for anything,'' Fiona
MacDonald said. She keeps to what every reader knows.

THEY came to dance. As they gather in front of the stage there are
wolf cries of anticipation, then growls as the stools appear. Then, as
the crew labour to get the stage ready, one or two wolfies even try to
start a slow hand-clap. Halfhearted, it peters out. Wolfies are too fond
of their heroes to cause an upset.
It works both ways -- and this may be why wolfies get so attached in
the first place -- because when their heroes talk to them, they talk
just like they would if they met in a pub. When singer/guitarist Ivan
Drever says he's been asked to tell them to sit down, it's a message
given and received very much in the ''one word from sir and the class
does what it likes'' school.
Wolfies trust their heroes. The news that first up is a set of
non-specified tunes is greeted with unbridled joy. If their heroes
weren't so nice, one of these days wolfies might find themselves
greeting the Crossroads theme.
But what of these tunes? The first set promised, as indeed did the
unplugged setting, more prominence for Drever and Duncan Chisholm's
lickety-split guitar and fiddle forays. It delivered, briefly, then it
was business as usual, except not quite so loud.
The trouble is, although there's a certain excitement value in the
''run for the home straight'', they don't take the tunes anywhere.
The songs, too, are poor, although the dancers at the front found
plenty to sway to, and Drever's voice (a quiet, attractive instrument
which the unplugged setting also should have brought to the fore)
struggled to compete with the rhythm section's energy level. But did the
wolfies love it? Do coyotes howl?

It's all in the mind as Anvar Khan and Stephen McGinty conjure up
visions of ideal partners.
A DREAM lover is a surrogate lover. There are two specimens; the
popular icon, the actor or musician, who feeds the emotional appetite of
the progesterone-crazed teenager, and the limited edition, a compilation
of physical and mental parts, for the adult who still believes, despite
personal disappointment, that one day soon, they will meet the right
person, the one who fits the image, the way Cinderella had to fit the
shoe.
A dream lover plays the lead in the various scenarios sketched out by
a playful imagination. You need the enthusiasm of a child to design and
conjure up your ideal mate, which is a shame, because as an adult you
need all your enthusiasm to work up the energy to find him. For real.
Desperation is a lonely, isolated affair with no-one in particular.
And it's boring. Sufferers need more than a Cup-a-Soup, chocolate and a
big cushion, mere comforters for needy women who've got past the point
of wishing for a man to be wild about and want a cuddle instead. Dream
loving is a great medicine because dream lovers never disappoint.
Look at Take That, for example. This band have millions of schoolie
fans, and they will keep every one of them. Fame prevents each member
from ever letting any one of their admirers down. Until an adoring pair
of eyes finds someone real to bat their lids at, they will stare, fixed
and true and faithful at the poster on the bedroom wall.
Take That are mega-famous which means that they are reasonably
unobtainable. Jason Orange will never betray his alleged ability to make
a girl feel special, or belie his expertise on the dance floor of a
14-year-old's fevered and lustful mind. This ensures his durability.
Dream lovers are the product of a naive perspective. An ideal
representative of an unrealistic expectation.
The focus of a frustrated idealism, of being without a soul mate, of
feeling left out in a culture obsessed with romantic love, of feeling
unwanted because all your classmates have a boyfriend, invariably
settles on an industry which provides a million two-dimensional
characters for human consumption.
Dream lovers are cartoons and can be found in all areas of
high-profile entertainment. Choose one and fantasise. It's your right as
a consumer. But it has to be said it seems tragic when the anonymous
grab at the over-publicised. In fact, some might say dream loving is all
a bit sad really. Even pretty pathetic.
This enthusiasm for taking celluloid characters to the heart without
the benefit of a face-to-face judgment, is the basis for the existence
of a multi-million pound enterprise. All it means is that you don't have
what you believe will make you happy.
Dream lovers should be distant, yes. But if he can be found on the
catwalks of Milan or sunning himself outside his beach palace in Malibu,
then you are not manufacturing your own, personal partner, you're just
being a groupie.
Dream lovers only come into their own when you're young enough not to
know any better. They are for teenies in the throes of an all-consuming
passionate interest in sexual power, whose own peer group is still
lukewarm and football mad.
The other type of dream lover is strictly for adults. The more
all-round life experience you have, the more clued-up you are about what
you really want and what you really need. In short, he's either in your
life or he's not.
It would be wrong, however, to make the mistake of suggesting that
while young women are content with sighing at alleged icons of
perfection, more mature ladies are not -- that adults would rather seek
out qualities such as good manners and kindness rather than raunch.
(Check out the audience at a Chippendales gig.)
Dream lovers can be as sweet and daffy as Norman Wisdom or as bland
and functional as a key player in soft porn. (The potential debate about
whether soft porn is entertainment for either a mature or infantile
mind, of any age or description, is being avoided like a road block
here. The point's the same. Dream lovers, in any capacity, exist for
kicks.)
Dream lovers represent sex or security, basically, whichever is in
short supply. Women, when it comes to imagining the best-ever lover, are
just as capable as men as avoiding complications of personality. If boys
can get off on bimbos, girls can get off on beefcakes too.
And just like men, dream lovers become better with age, your age,
because then you can build them up and out with all the things you know
that turn you on. Big hands. Footballer's legs. Drayman's shoulders. A
Tyson neck. The gravitas of Mr Blobby, the wit of Bobby Davro, or the
charisma of Jonathan Miller. At the end of the day, the construction
job, and the man, is yours.

As dreaded Black Friday approaches, Michael Tumelty tunes into a sound
evocation of the dark mood of the silent cinema classic Nosferatu,
starring Max Schreck
GRAB the garlic. Clutch a crucifix. Seize a stake. Hurl the holy
water. Friday the 13th, Black Friday, is almost upon us. Forget the
urbane, seductively-Brylcreemed allure of Christopher Lee.
Forget the gleaming, fissure-sealed fangs of Tom Cruise. There is only
one Dracula and he is Max Schreck, whose desolate, haunted, and
perpetually-haunting image permeates Nosferatu, FW Murnau's 1922 silent
screen classic and the first screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel.
Tomorrow night, Nosferatu, this masterpiece of German expressionism,
receives a screening with a difference at Glasgow's Tramway. It will be
accompanied by live music, a practice which -- perhaps coincidentally --
seems to be occurring with some frequency.
The Harmonie Band -- a six-piece outfit of winds, keyboards, cello,
percussion and synths -- will give the only Scottish presentation of the
score to Nosferatu, written by director of the group Paul Robinson.
Increasingly associated with the provision of live music for silent
films, the Harmonie Band (that's Harmonie, the German for woodwinds) was
formed in 1985. Over the last five years Robinson and the band have been
commissioned to provide scores for a range of films, including
Hitchcock's The Lodger (1926) Arthur Robinson's Warning Shadows (1923)
and Buster Keaton's classic comedy Sherlock Junior (1926).
Band director and composer Paul Robinson came up through the creative
ferment of York University music department and has increasingly worked
in mixed and multi-media formats. He holds the bizarre post of composer
in residence at Dean Clough -- an industrial park in Halifax -- and has
produced, with sculptor Chris Sacker, a collaborative work for
performance in an underground car park.
Robinson's score for Nosferatu, heard on an audio cassette and without
any visual imagery, gives little hint of the movie, except perhaps in
some of its dark, moody colours. But then, Carl Davis's opulent epic
pastiches only come to life when wedded to the films for which they were
intended.
Stylistically, Robinson's music is highly derivative. Its immediate
antecedent is the unmistakable minimalism of American Philip Glass.
Rolling, continuous bass lines, insidiously-repetitive and sustained
harmonic sequences, and the characteristic sound of deep saxes.
The overt beat that takes over occasionally -- and particularly the
throbbing Bo Diddley pulse which invades the score in one sequence --
seem incongruous. Don't get me wrong; it's all very professional, very
slick, and with occasional nice touches, such as a strangulated,
throat-bitten Dies Irae that is interrupted by high winds.
It's impossible, however, to judge the effectiveness of the score as
film music without the screen images -- though its function is more
likely to be generally atmospheric than descriptive.
Offsetting the Black Friday vampirism of the occasion (for which the
Tramway is probably an ideal host), the Harmonie Band will also perform
Robinson's score to Buster Keaton's Sherlock Junior (1926) for which --
in the same generally-minimalist style -- Robinson has composed madcap
music: high speed hi-jinks with a light touch, riffs tossed between
piano and sax, bounding arpeggios, and moments of pure galumph. Good
fun.
Devotees of the live music/silent screen genre should note some
upcoming events in Scotland: Flesh and the Devil with Carl Davis and the
Royal SNO (Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, Feb 14); Chaplin Operas with the
Paragon Ensemble (GFT Mar 19, Arts Centre, Aberdeen Mar 26, and
MacRobert Centre, Stirling April 9); Metropolis with pianist Neil Brand
(MacRobert Centre, March 12); and The Thief of Bagdad with Carl Davis
and the Royal SNO (Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, May 17).
* Nosferatu/Sherlock Junior, Tramway Friday 13, 8.30pm.

DREAM dates never come gift-wrapped, so don't despair if the dame from
the big Christmas movie never wound up under the mistletoe or tree.
Maybe Sharon Stone will appear next year.
For dreams do come true and as the movie says: It Could Happen To You.
A point proved by a Glasgow barmaid who picked up Brad Pitt when he
toured Scotland last year, a rumour now confirmed in the current cover
story of Rolling Stone magazine. Within hours Pitt had his feet under
the table at the family home as he supped chicken soup with his heart's
temporary co-star.
Women are more obviously attracted to film-star looks but inside every
guy lurks a hankering for a dream girl and possibly a pic tucked in a
wallet. The more honest ones will proudly display their cut-outs of
Sherilyn Fenn and Kim Wilde as if it's another family portrait. The coy
ones will talk vaguely of a promotion photograph of Joan Collins in The
Bitch, ripped as a kid from an old magazine then tucked under the bed.
Though the very premise of a dream girl hinges on fantasy certain
criteria must be observed before a babe becomes eligible for a key to
our daydreams. Beauty is a must combined with a figure as attractive as
a lottery win and the handbags of fame and fortune. But though such a
statement would win us a medal at being superficial, dream girls require
personalities. How else could we imagine entire conversations and dates?
And every guy does it. Staring into space manufacturing sexy
scenarios, the supermodel he rescues from drowning and the actress who
spys him across a room, all snatched moments in another world. But in my
opinion dates with dream girls are just nightmares waiting to descend.
In the soft-focus haze of an imagined encounter practical thoughts don't
occur.
Just imagine the practical realities of a relationship with any of the
following women: Cindy Crawford, Winona Ryder, Pamela Anderson, Sade,
Elizabeth Hurley or Madonna. After the confidence boost of pulling would
come the phone bill accrued from phoning your friends. But then where
would you go and who'd pay?
How would you introduce Madonna to your Catholic parents? You couldn't
hide her, not at breakfast with your dad peering at you over a tabloid
with a snatch pic of your face on her front under the screaming
headline: Office Worker Mad For Madonna.
Winona Ryder would be easier to handle but what if she expected you to
go to dinner with her old boyfriend Johnny Depp and his new fiancee Kate
Moss. It could get really embarrassing if you hated his movies, tried to
cut his fringe and kept telling Kate to eat up as she looked like a
skelf. It's not conducive to a lasting relationship.
Your dad might like Cindy Crawford but not if she brought k d Lang
round for Christmas and k d insisted on belting out Constant Craving at
the drop of a party hat. The neighbours would complain and a two-bedroom
semi is not the place to house mega-stars and their entourage. Where
would they park and could the bodyguards be armed?
Eventually your confidence would be shot through and hung out to dry
like net curtains. After all you were interested in her fame and
fortune, what if she only craved the fact that you lived in a Scottish
housing scheme.
''He's from Castlemilk,'' her chic friends would whisper in hushed
tones. ''That's Chateaux Au Lait in French.''
''My God! She's dating a Count!'' the dim one in the bright swimsuit
would say. ''Is there any more?''
Of course, there is millions.
And all the time you'd sweat your worth out on to the expensive shirts
she bought, as you thought: ''Self esteem, who needs it! Dignity,
phooey!''
Forget your friends. They don't want to know. Even your closest
confidant, the guy who listened to you whine about not asking Jean
Carruthers to dance in the games hall at the second-year afternoon
Christmas party, will not stand for you on the phone worrying that your
family doesn't like Pamela Anderson.
He'll tell you to dump her. But you won't. Instead you'll forget your
friends, ignore your family and think hard about what you can offer her
and the only honest answer will be complete and utter dependence.
Despite having discussed how a relationship would crack we'd all risk
the splinters for a few wild nights with a celluloid nymphet and the
chance to point her out on screen to our grandchildren.

IT'S not PC, and it is situated in a big hangar by the Clyde, not a
Big Top, but Paul Maloney was still won over by Bobby Roberts and his
circus
THE lights went down and from their position over the tatty,
silver-swagged entrance, the five-piece band struck up the opening
music. Coloured follow-spots wove figures of eight across the ring and
audience, each member of which had purchased a hand-written ticket from
two women in the box-office trailer.
The Bobby Roberts Super Circus is an enjoyable, if uneven, mix of all
the traditional elements. The aerial acts were exciting and thrillingly
close. The animals were the big hit with the kids. The clowns looked
terrific, but were desperately unfunny.
My own three-year-old son sat rapt in concentration, applauding
everything at the slightest provocation, and stayed the distance, only
slightly puzzled as to why anyone should want to spin round on a rope
high above his head.
The most spectacular act was strategically placed at the end of the
first half. From a cloud of green dry ice, to the throbbing strains of
cold Eastern music, rode the Aladdin Fantasy, a combination of Indian
elephants and Arabian horses, ridden by harem-costumed girls. After
that, there was no alternative to queueing for a souvenir ringside
photograph of boy with elephant.
Presiding over that and most other animal acts was the circus's
proprietor and star performer, Bobby Roberts Jr. This year's show
celebrates the golden jubilee of a family firm founded in Falkirk 50
years ago by his father, Bobby Snr, and his Uncle Tommy. Bobby Jr is
circus aristocracy, the tenth generation of a family which traces its
lineage back to legendary Victorian showman Sir Robert Fossett.
Like his father, who was a famous trainer of horses and wild animals,
Bobby Jr doesn't cut a glamorous figure in the ring. Stout and a little
dishevelled-looking in a succession of rhinestone-encrusted tuxedos, his
appearances with his various animal acts form the backbone of the
programme.
In person, he has the slightly rumpled, put-upon air of a
third-division football manager. He has been performing since he was
four (''I was walking over the lions' cage on the tightrope when I was
eight''), and has done everything from clowning, juggling, and tumbling
to a celebrated Wild West act which won first place at the circus world
championships.
His brother having decided to take his family to work on the
Continent, Bobby Jr now runs what was formerly the Roberts Brothers
Circus under his own name. As a leading figure in the circus community,
he takes great pride in his membership of showbusiness charity
organisations like the Water Rats and the Variety Club -- but the weekly
grind of keeping the show on the road doesn't leave much time for a
round of golf with Tarby.
The circus company of between 50 and 60 tours all year round and Bobby
never takes holidays. The overheads involved are as frightening as the
risks. He complains of a huge increase in local government bureaucracy
and of the time it now takes to deal with regulations covering health
and safety, environmental health and building control.
His wife Moira is the company's business manager and his daughter, son
and cousin are all in the show, but it is Bobby -- a mechanic,
electrician and qualified welder -- who oversees every aspect of
presentation. It is the training and care of the animals, however, which
is clearly his great love and the most demanding part of his
responsibilities.
Bobby says he has had little trouble from the animal rights lobby and
says anyone who objects to animals in the circus is welcome to inspect
the conditions in which his animals are kept.
Bobby Jr insists on a tidy encampment. ''We never allow washing
hanging out. My father always said that when you went to the theatre,
you don't see the manager's wife's washing hanging in the foyer -- and
this is also a place of entertainment.''
He's a staunch monarchist and has played before the Queen on five
occasions. The National Anthem is played at the end of every show.
''Somebody might get up in the middle of it, but I'll tell them to sit
down, and they do,'' he says.
Bobby Roberts knows that large-scale touring circuses like his are an
anachronism in commercial terms -- but doesn't see any point in debating
whether it is worth the effort or how long he'll be able to keep the
show on the road. It is simply what he does and was born to do. His
20-year-old son is undergoing the same apprenticeship as he did and is
serving his time as Bobo the clown.
It is only at the finale of the show that Bobby Jr pulls rank and
takes the microphone from the svelte young ringmaster. He hectors the
audience in his hoarse Pa Larkin voice: ''Well, did you like it? I can't
hear you. Did you like the show?''
He's an oldstyle fairground barker, crude and none too ingratiating.
The crowd roars its approval back at him. Bobby Roberts, like his
circus, is the real thing.
* Bobby Roberts Super Circus is at the SECC until Sunday.

<TEXT>
COUNCIL tax payers in the West of Scotland could find themselves
paying an additional #4m a year if the local authority catering company,
Catering Direct, was fragmented because of local government
reorganisation, it was claimed yesterday. Unions representing the 8200
people employed by Catering Direct, including the region's school dinner
ladies, are campaigning to keep it as a single company although
Strathclyde region itself is to disappear.
It was set up by the region in the late eighties to supply meals to
schools, social work homes, meals on wheels, and council offices. It
delivers about 18,000 meals a day, and has an annual turnover of #63m.
Director Avril Robertson said the size of the company meant it was able
to save council tax payers about #4m a year through economies of scale,
which would be lost if the new councils opt to run their own
organisations.

Steve Bruce finds evidence that society is the poorer, despite
increased wealth
POOLS winners, anorexic princesses, corrupt newspaper tycoons; it
doesn't take long to run up a list of rich and unhappy people. You don't
have to subscribe to The People's Friend to know that prosperity need
not bring contentment or happiness.
The Government has just produced a richly-detailed portrait of Britain
in statistics (Britain 1995: 50 Years of Change) and it makes
fascinating reading.
Did you know that the average family size has fallen from more than
four people in 1991 to 2.4 in 1992 -- or that women now make up almost
half the workforce?
But, at the heart of all the detail, is one big, dismal observation.
Since 1971, disposable income has increased by 80%. And that is allowing
for inflation. We are almost twice as well-off as our parents. And yet
we are not happy.
Some people are anxious and unhappy because they are relatively poorer
than they were in the 1970s; those at the bottom of the heap have been
receiving crumbs, while those at the top have been getting big slabs of
Battenburg, but it is still the case that most of us are far better off
than our parents and grandparents.
My granny got an indoor water supply in 1963. She didn't get
electricity or an inside toilet until she moved into sheltered housing
in 1970. We take water and toilets and electricity and telephones and
washing machines and televisions for granted. And yet we are not happy.
The standard explanation for a lack of ''feel-good factor'' is that we
fear it may not last. The Tories have caused two recessions in the last
15 years and we wonder when the next will arrive. That orthodox
explanation of our trepidation is, of course, correct but there is
something much more fundamental at work here. Ill ease is a basic
feature of the modern condition.
We can readily see why we are prone to anxiety and self-doubt if we
compare our biology to that of lesser animals. Most of what pigs and
sheep and ants do is a product of their instincts and their environment.
They hump because they react instinctively to hormonal cycles. They eat
when they are hungry and stop when they are full. They have little
choice but to take the world more or less as they find it.
The restless cow may jump the fence into a more attractive field, but
it cannot spread fertiliser to speed grass growth. We guzzle quarts of
diet Coke to wash down Triple Jumbo Super Burgers and get fatter and
fatter. We have very few instincts, and those that we have are weak and
do not specify how we should act them out. We talk of a ''will to
survive'' but people commit suicide.
A ''sex drive'' may be an innate part of our biology but we can chose
to be celibate, and for a single species we have a mind-boggling array
of ways of achieving sexual gratification. No matter how exotic your
fantasies, you are unlikely to dream up anything which is not
commonplace in some culture. And, as for environmental constraints, the
pig is limited to rooting around his immediate space, but we can suck
oil out of the wild seas west of Shetland.
Compared to other animals, confined in the straight-jacket of their
biology and their inflexible environments, humans are potentially in a
state of ''world-openness'' (it sounds better in the original German).
This has its up-side. It explains why we can read and write and
reconstruct the world while the pig is still snuffling in its trough.
But it also has a downside. It means that there are no built-in limits
on our desires or aspirations.
As a pedestrian, like Toad of Toad Hall with his sad ''poop-poop''
imitation of a car horn, I yearned for a motor car. I bought a Citroen
2CV. For a few months that was wonderful. Then I wanted a car with four
cylinders! My father -- he came from Buchan -- sold me his Vauxhall
Viva. Now I was content. For a few months. Until I realised that I was
always in the slow lane and couldn't hear the stereo over the noise from
the shoe-box aerodynamics.
Promotion meant a trade-up to cars with doors that clunked shut rather
than rattled: a Renault 21 and then a Cavalier. At every stage the warm,
contented glow of acquisition was soon replaced by dissatisfaction as I
got used to one level of performance and could see no legitimate reason
why I should not have a better car.
The turn-of-the century French sociologist Emile Durkheim realised the
problem when he discovered that suicide rates went up during economic
depressions, but also went up during periods of unprecedented
prosperity. Getting far more than they expected seemed to unsettle
people every bit as much as geting far less.
Durkheim concluded that people could only remain content if their
desires were constrained by a culture which taught them what to expect
from life and ensured that their expectations were roughly in line with
their actual circumstances. Agreed rules were not necessary to stop
people fighting with each other; they were also necessary for internal
well-being.
Confining our sexual desires to our spouses prevents the pain of
free-for-all sexual competition and so creates a degree of social
harmony but it does more than that. If we internalise the principle that
our lusts should be so confined, we will be content.
Or, at least, we stand a damned sight better chance of being content
than if we view all attractive members of the opposite sex as perpetual
fair game. So that we are not trapped in a constant and self-defeating
attempt to satisfy desires that simply become inflamed with
encouragement, we need to create artificial constraints and we do this
by constructing social orders and shared cultures. Social institutions
do for us what instincts do for other animals.
And here we get to the source of our anxiety. We no longer have shared
cultures. We stress the individual over the community. Our political
masters tell us that there is no such thing as society. Modern
capitalism requires us to want more than we can have. Adverts for Saab
cars are shown to anyone who can afford a TV, and not just to those rich
enough to afford them.
There are many reasons to applaud the collapse of social and cultural
constraints. Who would advocate going back to a time when everyone knew
their place -- the rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate --
and the ambitious young were crushed by their parents telling them not
to get ideas above their station? Who would wish a return to the closed
horizons of the fatalistic peasant homeward plodding his weary way?
Yet, as we come to the end of a century which has seen change like no
other, we are also beginning to sense the dark side of this freedom.
With few shared values to bind us, to tell us what our lives should be
like, and to reconcile our desires with our actual opportunities, we are
feeling the chill winds of modernity.

IT'S not exactly the same as winning the Lottery but we think the
Diary can point some of you in the direction of a nice little earner.
An organisation called the Murdoch Trust is trying in vain to give
away sums of money ranging from #400 to #1000. The trust was set up by
John Murdoch, a research scientist and bachelor of the parish of
Craiglockhart in Edinburgh. The cash has been available since he
shuffled off this mortal coil in 1901.
The Royal Bank of Scotland private trust and taxation department,
which manages the fund, tells us there has been a dearth of
beneficiaries in recent years. Well three actually.
The conditions are somewhat unusual. Applicants should be ''bachelors
or widowers suffering from financial hardship, of any religion, who had
shown a particular sympathy to any of the branches of the sciences
during their lifetimes, either as amateurs or professionals''.
Those ''who consider their lives to have been characterised by
sobriety, morality, and industry and who are over the age of 55'' can
apply for assistance.
This rules out most persons of the Diary's acquaintance. But who
knows, there may be a Diary reader out there who is moderately sober,
industrious, and knows one end of a Bunsen burner from the other. We
will not be charging commission.
* OBLIQUELY on the subject of the lottery, may we offer a Nae Luck
Award to reader Paul McSween of Tollcross who had three numbers up and
was richer to the tune of #10. Or he would have been if he hadn't
incurred a #20 parking ticket while he was in R S McColl's collecting
his winnings.
The Number Game
MR WILL WILSON, the Edinburgh-based spokesperson for the patriotically
named Scottish Claymores American football team, has the equally wha's
like us telephone number 220-1314.
Desert brats
WE hear from an old friend (name withheld) now working in an Arab
country (name also withheld in case this story gets back and gets our
man into soapy).
Our man, a life-long devotee of the Scout movement, has founded a
troop of young Arabian followers of the Baden-Powell philosophy. He
reports that there are a few local difficulties, not the least of which
is learning to camp on sand.
Even more problematical is the attitude of the young recruits. They
all come from vastly wealthy families with wall-to-wall domestic help.
And they have not yet come to grips with the concept that the
patrol-leaders and senior Scouts are not there to cook and clean-up
after them.
It should be interesting when they get to Bob-a-Job week.
Meg's last laugh
WE read in the Dundee Courier on the subject of the death of comedian
Larry Grayson that among those who paid tribute to the old queen was
actress Noele Gordon. Nice of her to take the trouble since she headed
off to the great soap opera in the sky some 10 years ago.
* A NAE LUCK award to Amber Dawson, a BBC researcher who assiduously
collected a mass of material for a programme on Scotland's fire
services. And who now has to start all over again because her research
was destroyed. When there was a fire in her office.
Better bred
FULL marks for effort to Mr Ewan Cameron of Ryden, the property
people, as he tries to promote a new office development in Glasgow.
First, he sent the Diary a loaf with the message that his building was
''the best thing since sliced bread''. We ate the loaf.
Now he sends a miniature of whisky and a lump of coal inviting folk to
be his first foot. We would tell you the address. But it takes more than
a slice of toast, a handful of Coalite, and a wee dram to bribe the
Herald Diary.
The Name Game
CHIEF EXECUTIVE of the Hykee Lock, which specialises in security
systems for cars, is one Don Crooks. The new spokesperson for the Army
in Scotland is one Nigel Sargeant. And why not. If the Americans can
have a Mahor Major, we can have a Sergeant Sargeant.
A signal failure
WE hear of a particularly unpleasant train trip from Glasgow to
Edinburgh experienced by a group of gastarbeiters who make the daily
pilgrimage to the West from the capital city. There was no heat and no
light in their carriage for the entire journey.
Letters of complaint were duly fired off to ScotRail. Letters of
apology came by return of post. As a gesture of goodwill, the letter
said, a #5 travel voucher was enclosed.
Except that in every case the #5 voucher was missing. A case of the
travel voucher due to arrive with this letter has been unavoidably
delayed.

The latest move to harmonise British time with that of the rest of
Europe looks set to meet fierce opposition on this side of the Border.
TIME and tide wait for no man, or so it is said. But time can be
changed, which is what the Bill brought before the House of Lords last
night for a second reading by Viscount Mountgarret, Baron of Kells,
would do. British time would be brought into harmony with European time
by bringing it forward an hour. The change has long been mooted, and
strenuously opposed, particularly in Scotland where, it is argued by
opponents of change, such a time shift would mean darkness lasting
longer into the morning in winter than it does at present.
Lord Mountgarret's Central European Time Bill proposes that England,
Wales and Northern Ireland should go forward an hour to bring them into
line with the rest of Europe, but lets Scotland decide whether to follow
suit. That would mean a time change at the Border. He left this option
in deliberately, he said last night.
''The consultation document of 1989 showed that 96% of the country
were in favour of change,'' he said. ''The Scots were not and that is
why I have left them out. No-one is forcing them to adopt one time or
another, but I do hope they will join us. They can always choose to opt
in. I can only speak for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.''
As to why he is seeking such a change, he said it would be ''very
beneficial''. He was not, however, clear as to why the people of
Northern Ireland felt any different from the people of Scotland.
Daylight saving was introduced in Britain in 1908 as an experiment and
since then we have had Double Summer Time during the war, when the extra
light allegedly helped the war effort by allowing people more time on
their allotments, Extended Summer Time, British Standard Time and
British Summer Time.
Between 1968 and 1971 there was an experiment with permanent summer
time (British Standard Time) which was abandoned after reports about
increased road accidents and claims that children, especially in
Scotland, had been killed or injured on the roads on the way to school.
In fact, the reverse appears to have been the case as far as road
accidents were concerned. Although there were more in the darker winter
mornings, there were fewer in the evenings when the majority of
accidents occur.
The arguments in favour of scrapping the annual switch back -- the
clock changes one hour forward on March 27, when Summer Time begins, and
goes back an hour on October 27 -- have been debated ever since daylight
saving was introduced. But it was after we joined the Common Market that
the debate gained real impetus. In Europe the time change back an hour
takes place at the end of September, but harmonisation has been resisted
in Britain on the grounds that we would loose the light evenings in one
of the nicest months of the year.
Is change a good thing or a bad thing? At present in winter time it is
possible to leave Paris by plane and arrive in London at the same time
as one left. This is of considerable value to travellers, although not
to businessmen because it means they are out to lunch at different
times.
Opinion in Scotland has always resisted changing winter time, and so
have most of those who must work in the early morning -- postmen,
milkmen, construction workers and the like.
The argument is that the longer period of darkness in the morning
would mean more accidents, force children to travel to school in the
dark, and pose difficulties for farmers.
The pros and cons have been fully debated time and again, most
recently in 1993 when the Policy Studies Institute looked at the
situation and concluded that putting clocks one hour ahead of their
current setting in summer and winter would mean fewer road deaths and
accidents, reduce crime, be of benefit to sport and tourism and cut
electricty bills by more than #250m.
The view in Europe is that since we are in the Common Market we should
keep in step, but all that we agreed to do was co-ordinate the summer
time change. Brussels has accepted that we are geographically further
west than the continent and a longer period of summer time suits our
needs.
The Government published a white paper in 1989 which would have
brought us into line, the proposal being that we should be one hour
ahead of Greenwich meantime in summer and winter. That led to a campaign
-- Keep Summer Time British, and summer time duly stayed British.
In October last year the get into step with the rest of Europe lobby
claimed, in a report published two days before the clocks went back,
that three out of four people wanted Britain to have the same time as
the rest of Europe.
Meanwhile, in September Mr Angus Crichton-Miller of the Daylight Extra
Now group said in Glasgow that its proposals would mean greater security
for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, would permit greater
enjoyment of sports throughout the year, and would, as a boost to the
Scottish tourist industry, provide increased employment.
''There has been wild talk about Scotland not getting daylight until
11am throughout the winter,'' he added. ''The facts are that even in
Aberdeen it will be getting light at 9.30am on the shortest day,
afternoon daylight in the week will be more useful for the majority and
that at weekends early morning daylight is of little benefit. For the
vast majority of Scots, darker mornings would only be noticeable for
some 12 weeks of the year. But lighter evenings would be noticeable all
year round.''
Campaign supporters include the Police Federation, the Confederation
of British Industry and the British Medical Association.
According to the RAC, the change would save 165 lives and avoid 628
serious injuries on the roads in Britain each year because there would
be more light in early evenings when most accidents happen. Mr Mike
McDonnell, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, told
the same news conference that in Scotland, the introduction of lighter
evenings would lead to a reduction of 60 deaths and serious injuries
every year.
Ministers dropped the idea of harmonising British time with Europe in
the immediate future last March when the Cabinet's legislation committee
decided that, in the face of all-party resistance from Scots MPs, any
Bill would cause unnecessary difficulties in the current Parliamentary
session.
In October the previous year a ten-minute rule Bill was introduced
into the Commons by Nigel Waterson, Conservative MP for Eastbourne, to
bring in double summer time. This was approved by 103 votes to 86
against, with 34 Scots MPs among the opponents. The Bill got nowhere,
but that is not uncommon. Its purpose was more as a testing of the
waters than as a serious piece of legislation, and the vote showed that
Scots MPs were not going to change their minds about the undesirability
of change.

MR CHRIS GREEN may be politicking in his comments on the crisis facing
ScotRail as it rattles sadly into the dark tunnel of privatisation, but
he is politicking to good purpose. His aim, and it should be supported
by everyone, whether they step on trains regularly or even have a stake
in the many aspects of Scottish social and economic life touched by rail
services, is to provide a rail system sufficient to serve the country.
This is not an unreasonable ambition. In most countries it would be
accepted without further comment. The difference is that most countries
of any pretension to be modern have integrated transport systems, again
a modest ambition, but on the evidence of the past two decades one
totally foreign to the thinking of British Government Ministers. The
dream of integration has been finally dashed by the wrong-headed
insistence on the privatisation of the railway system, for how can
integration be expected to exist in and alongside market-driven
competition? It would be like trying to run a railway engine on
non-parallel tracks.
The notion of subsidy is, of course, anathema to the privatisers, and
ScotRail is facing serious budget cuts this year with the prospect of
forced cuts in operating costs in future years. Mr Green warns that this
disinvestment, for that is what it amounts to, will result in the very
cheapest rail system where notions of quality and service after
privatisation will be utterly beyond ScotRail's purse. His message is
the very opposite of that expected from the head of what will be a
privatised rail system, and that is that subsidies must continue, and at
a higher level, if ScotRail is to provide any sort of decent service.
The proposals for the future of ScotRail suggest the opposite effect.
Some two-thirds of Mr Green's operating costs are subsidy in one form or
another. The money which comes from Strathclyde Regional Council is
likely to spiral down the sink-hole of local government reorganisation,
and the other substantial source of cash, the Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising, is demanding successive cuts in the money which it will
provide.
Simply put, the sums do not add up. The options take the form of
increased fares, fewer trains, fewer staff, and fewer coaches on trains.
Mr Green believes he can avoid the closure of lines, but this must
surely be a short-term ambition and one which could only be sustained in
the long term if an improbably magic wand were to be waved over the
entire system. Not believing in fairies, we must conclude that the fate
of ScotRail will be similar to Mr Green's direst predictions, with all
that means for the knock-on effects on business, tourism, and the
infrastructure of a land bedevilled by ever greater numbers of heavy
lorries. There are those who have hopes that political realities in the
form of voter/traveller discontent will bring about a reversal in the
plans for the rail system. It would be nice to believe in an exercise of
direct democracy of this sort, but there are precious few signs of it as
yet. Nevertheless, minds must be changed, and quickly, if we are to have
a future rail system worthy of the name.

Brussels
SIX Labour Euro-MPs yesterday formally reversed their support for
Clause 4 after a stinging attack by Tony Blair, who accused some of them
of ''infantile'' incompetence."
However, Mr Blair's furious confrontation in Brussels also showed how
deeply divided Labour is on the issue which seems set to afford relief
to the beleaguered Conservatives until April when Mr Blair wants the
question finally resolved with a conference vote.
Mr Blair launched a ferocious assault on those Euro-MPs who paid,
personally, #3700 to the Guardian for a front-page advertisement
supporting the retention of Clause 4 in Labour's constitution.
He accused them of sabotaging Labour's New Year assault on the Tories
on Tuesday night -- the same night that Mr Blair was courting big
business at a #500-a-plate dinner in the most expensive hotel in
Brussels. Mr Blair denounced their action as a ''gross discourtesy.''
The mood of the meeting at which Mr Blair received applause for his
stand but also some barracking from hardline supporters of Clause 4 was
exemplified by his response to left-winger Mr David Hallam.
When Mr Hallam asked if Mr Blair would renationalise all public
utilities sold off by the Tories, the Labour leader replied icily:
''Grow up.''
Mr Alex Falconer (Mid Scotland and Fife), a left-wing former Rosyth
shop steward, vowed to carrying on leading the fight to save Clause 4.
He emerged from the bruising meeting and appropriated the lines of
Hugh Gaitskell -- who failed to kill off Clause 4 -- by promising to
''fight, fight and fight again'' for what he said was a fundamental
socialist principle.
Some mystery still surrounds the timing of the advertisement. Mr
Falconer first told The Herald in October that he had secured signatures
from about half of the European Parliamentary Labour Party for
preserving Clause 4 and that he was planning a public campaign. In
November the signatories agreed at a meeting in Strasbourg to place a
series of advertisements in left-supporting newspapers including the
Guardian for which they wanted a front-page space sometime in early
January.
Mr Falconer paid the bill himself after negotiating a discount for
having his personal cheque cleared in advance. However, he refused to
say yesterday if he had deliberately chosen the day of Mr Blair's visit
as a provocative gesture. "We just wanted publicity" he said.
Mr Hugh McMahon (Strathclyde West) one of the 32 MEPs who signed the
advertisement, remarked after meeting Mr Blair:"I think I am on the side
of those who believe in the conspiracy theory."
Mr McMahon was among those who recanted and added their names to a
statement supporting the removal of Clause 4. More than half the
62-strong EPLP had signed the letter last night. It urged Labour not to
become ''museum curators of constitutions set in stone.''
However, there was no change of heart from Mr Alex Smith (South of
Scotland), the third Scottish signatory.
Mr Blair told the meeting that Labour was a government in waiting and
should behave like it. ''This means discipline," he said, "where there
is no room for gesture politics.''
Party members and supporters and others considering switching to
Labour would be ''dismayed'' at how Labour's New Year offensive against
the Tories had been spoiled, he complained.
After Mr Wayne David, a Welsh MEP, had accused Mr Falconer of
publishing the advertisement without warning all the signatories of the
provocative timing, Mr Blair accused the Clause 4 lobby of wrecking his
strategy. ''It was entirely overshadowed by what I regard as a gross
discourtesy,'' he said. ''There can be no excuse for the infantile
incompetence which blunted our New Year message.''
Mr Blair argued: ''We are not living in 1945 -- we are living in
1995.'' After the collapse of communism, he said, virtually every
socialist party in the world had recognised the need for change and
Labour was doing likewise.
He was backed by Mrs Glenys Kinnock, who said Labour could not change
as long as people hung on to "symbols" like Clause 4 which was written
in 1918 and had little relevance to people thinking about voting Labour
today. She said Mr Blair's attitude to those who signed the
advertisement was ''perfectly acceptable.'' She praised his performance
as ''brave.''
She added: "He was extremely angry because maximum embarrassment was
caused."
Mr Hallam remarked after his putdown by Mr Blair: ''It was an
interesting discussion. I fundamentally disagreed with what he said but
I was very impressed with the way he carried himself.''
Another Clause 4 defender, Mr Stan Newens, said he had not changed his
mind. "There was nothing infantile about what we did," he said.
Mr Falconer shrugged: ''I don't think it helps the debate when this
kind of language is used. We still have a lot of support and we will
continue to stand by our principles.''

A MAN who was sacked for wearing his hair in a ponytail has lost his
claim for unfair dismissal.
Supermarket worker Jim Aitken, 26, from Burnside, Glasgow, had also
claimed sex discrimination against supermarket giants Safeway as he said
female staff wouldn't have been dismissed if they wore their hair in an
identical style.
An industrial triunal in Glasgow heard that Safeway rules stated the
hair of male staff had to be no more than collar length and worn in a
conventional style.
Mr Aitken, whose hair is above collar length, and worn long on top and
cropped short at the sides, said he would probably have kept his job at
the store in Burnside if he hadn't worn it in a ponytail.
He told the tribunal: ''A female member of staff with the exact same
hairstyle, the same length, and wearing it the same way would not have
been penalised.
''My hair was neat and tidy at all times. I was well turned out. I
felt I had done nothing wrong to lose my job. I felt gutted.'' Mr Aitken
said he offered to wear a hairnet and hat to work to cover his ponytail.
Safeway management told the tribunal the no ponytail rule was in
response to shoppers' demands for staff to be clean cut with a
conventional haircut. However, personnel controller Marie Sinclair
accepted Mr Aitken's appearance was fine.
The tribunal issued an advance notice, dismissing Mr Aitken's
complaint. Full reasons for the decision will follow at a later date.

AS London cinemas yesterday reported record box office receipts for
the made-in-Scotland thriller Shallow Grave, the Glasgow Film Fund
announced details of an ambitious financial package which gives the
final go-ahead for its second project.
The Near Room, another contemporary black thriller, will start filming
in Glasgow next month, thanks to a deal which has been struck with a
major international distributor. The movie will be shot in the city and
should be ready for general release early next year.
The Glasgow Film Fund has already contributed #150,000 to the cost of
the project, and further cash has been promised by British Screen
Finance. The latest deal -- with the Australian-based Smart Egg company
-- means the producers now have enough international backing to proceed.
Details of the total cost have not been revealed but it is being
described as a ''modest-budget'' movie at slightly less than #1m. It
will be directed by Scottish actor-director David Hayman and star
Irishman Adrian Dunbar.
Location filming is expected to be completed by May and, for the first
time, the production team is hoping to carry out all of the
post-production work in Glasgow. The film will provide work for more
than 100 people.
The Near Room's producer, Mr Ben Crooks, said: ''Smart Egg really took
a shine to our script. The backing from the GFF really gave us the
leverage required to get international backing. Having a distribution
deal signed before The Near Room goes into production is a tremendous
vote of confidence in the creative team and it should also give heart to
other independents seeking the elusive deal.''
The Glasgow Film Fund is financed by Glasgow City Council, Glasgow
Development Agency, Strathclyde region, and the European Regional
Development Fund.
Smart Egg, which has its base in Australia but which also has offices
in America and the UK, has been involved in distribution and the
co-finance of movies like Nightmare on Elm Street, The Coca Cola Kid,
and Montenegro.
Meanwhile, Shallow Grave appears to be taking the first tentitive
steps towards Four Weddings and a Funeral status, with a wildly
successful first week in London and Scotland. In the 23 cinemas where it
is showing, the movie took #152,131 over three days.

AIR FRANCE has dropped its daily service from Glasgow to Paris as part
of a worldwide effort to improve its faltering finances.
The Glasgow run is one leg of the flight from Paris to Edinburgh but
flights will continue between the Scottish and French capitals.
Airline officials admit the Paris-Scotland route in general is
unprofitable and will continue to be assessed. ''That's not to say
Scotland is under greater threat than any other route,'' said an
official yesterday.
Air France spokesman Mr Bernard McCoy said Glasgow and Edinburgh
supply an equal number of the passengers but more French passengers use
the Edinburgh connection and they bring in a higher revenue than the
local traffic from Glasgow.
''What we are trying to do for these non-profitable routes is to
reduce our losses,'' said Mr McCoy.
The Glasgow route is the only European leg to be cut by the airline.
Other routes from Paris to Bahrain, Maputo in Mozambique, Windhoek in
Namibia, Doha in Qatar, Khartoum in Sudan, Bari in Italy, Quito in Lima,
and Recife in South America will also cease.

CHRISTIE'S, the fine art auctioneers, was yesterday ordered by a judge
to repay #557,500 to the buyer of a painting which turned out to be a
fake.
The High Court award, plus interest of #130,000 and legal costs
unofficially estimated at around #100,000, went to wealthy Swiss art
dealer Marie Zelinger de Balkany, who bought the painting at a Geneva
auction in June 1987.
Christie's is considering an appeal.
Youth Kneeling Before God The Father was described in a Christie's
catalogue as being by Austrian artist Egon Schiele (1890-1918), and as
signed by him.
Mrs de Balkany told Mr Justice Morison she fell ''head over heels in
love'' with the work and it was knocked down to her for #500,000. She
paid Christie's #57,500 commission.
Four years later, a book by Schiele expert Jane Kallir threw doubt on
its authenticity. Mrs de Balkany sued Christie's.
The auctioneers argued that the painting was sold ''as is'' and
pleaded ''caveat emptor'' -- let the buyer beware. It claimed the
painting was by Schiele, denied negligence, and said in any case it owed
no duty of care to the buyer.
The judge, after hearing evidence from experts including Ms Kallir,
ruled that the painting was a ''forgery'' within Christie's terms and
conditions of sale, and Mrs de Balkany was entitled to return the work
and get her money back.
He said the original painting was probably by Schiele but it had been
overpainted after his death so only about 6% of the original was now
visible.
The overpainter had put new initials ES on the painting, hoping to
induce people into believing the whole painting was by Schiele. But for
recent examination with an ultra violet lamp, he might have got away
with it.
The judge rejected Christie's argument that the overpainting was
simply a matter of the painting's condition and that the overpainter, by
adding Schiele's initials, was just strengthening the mark of
authorship.
The work bought by Mrs de Balkany was by someone who had ''dressed it
up to be a painting by Schiele'', he said.
Mrs de Balkany said later: ''I am only sorry Christie's felt it
necessary to oblige me to fight the action all the way to court.''

SCOTTISH Second World War veterans are to be denied the opportunity to
mount their own parade and march past in Edinburgh later this year to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of hostilities.
It has been decreed that such a celebration would be too divisive.
Instead, the veterans will have to travel to London to take part in the
national commemoration, they have been told. Despite the ruling, parades
of veterans are being arranged in Cardiff and Belfast.
The Prime Minister made it clear yesterday that no public money would
be made available for Scottish old soldiers to travel to England for the
national event.
General Sir Michael Gow, the former Commander-in-Chief of British
forces in Germany, a member of the steering committee planning the
nation's commemoration of the end of the war, had proposed that there
should have been a major Scottish event in August.
Holyrood Park would have been the ideal venue, where all the Scottish
veterans could have paraded, he concluded.
The general, a Scots Guard Normandy veteran, had argued that it would
be too expensive for Scottish old soldiers to travel to London. However,
he was out-voted by his fellow committee members, who want public
attention to focus on the events in London.
They did not want press and television diverted by events taking place
in Scotland.
The general lost a battle with the Government to provide funds for
Scots to travel south.
The steering committee resolved to get round the problem by inviting
companies to sponsor their travel.
Yesterday, as the plans for the commemorative events to mark the end
of the war in Europe and the Far East were released, General Gow
declared that, thus far, efforts to raise sponsorship funds were, to say
the least disappointing.
The Royal British Legion in Scotland had donated #25,000, as had the
Royal Bank of Scotland. Otherwise, thus far, the response had been
almost non-existent, he said.
''Down here, they think the country ends north of Potters Bar,'' he
said.
''Scotland is a huge nation and few will be able to afford the cost of
the travel to London. That is why I wanted the Government to cover their
expenses.
''When the parade marches and rolls down The Mall to take the salute
of the Queen, I wanted television commentators to take a breath and
declare: 'And now here come the Scots!' ''
According to General Gow tight-fisted companies were prepared to offer
all the goodwill in the world but not cash. ''Goodwill costs little,''
he said.
However, another member of the steering committee, Lord Sterling,
chairman of the P &amp; O shipping line insisted that Scots should not be
deflected by such defeatist talk.
All it would take, he said, would be a couple of telephone calls from
him to ensure that there would be sufficient sponsorship for a huge
attendance by the Scottish regiments in London.
Following the spam cooking competition debacle which followed his
press conference to release details of D-Day celebrations last year, the
Prime Minister once more took the chance of heading yesterday's news
conference.
He knew in advance that any involvement of the Japanese, or lack of
it, would have been hugely controversial.
Viscount Slim, president of the Burma Star Association, whose father
commanded the 14th Army in Burma, said there could have been ''no
question'' of inviting the Japanese.
Sitting alongside the Prime Minister as the VE Day and VJ Day
anniversary plans were unveiled, he said: ''We are happy to meet the
Japanese in different circumstances, for example when we travel.''
The refusal to ask the Japanese head of state to events in Britain
contrasts sharply with the decision to invite Germany, Italy, and all
the countries that took part in the European theatre.
Mr Major said Japan, which had been carefully consulted over the
plans, was ''perfectly content'' with the decision. The Japanese
ambassador would be invited along with all other ambassadors to attend
the VE Day celebrations in May but not the VJ Day -- end of the war --
events in August.
The focus of the celebrations between May 6 and 8 to mark the end of
the war in Europe will be peace, reconciliation, and youth, with a
three-day public show in London's Hyde Park the centrepiece.
In contrast, the VJ Day celebrations on August 19 and 20 will
concentrate on Britain and the Commonwealth, with a parade of military
and civilian veterans down the Mall and church services.
In Scotland, there will be a service at St Giles' in Edinburgh on May
8 and the Scottish Secretary will later host a reception. On August 20,
there will be another national church service at St Giles', followed by
a beating of retreat and sunset ceremony on the esplanade of Edinburgh
Castle and a firework display. About 9000 Scottish veterans will be able
to attend that event.
Down here, they think that the country ends north of Potters Bar

A LAWYER jailed for trying to rape a fellow solicitor was last night
looking forward to practising again after escaping being struck off.
Angus Diggle, a 38-year-old Scot who now lives in Bolton, Greater
Manchester, was suspended for one year by the solicitors' disciplinary
tribunal in London.
Its chairman, Mr Barrie Marsh, said that although the matter was very
serious, Diggle had been punished for the criminal offence and had
served his debt to society.
Diggle was convicted at the Old Bailey in August 1993 of trying to
rape the 25-year-old Glasgow woman. She worked as a lawyer in Edinburgh.
They danced together and drank champagne, whisky, and wine at a St
Andrew's Day ball at a hotel in Park Lane, central London.
They returned to a friend's flat in Earl's Court, where Diggle agreed
to sleep on the floor but made advances to the woman.
He was wearing only his spectacles, the frilly cuffs of his full
Highland dress, and a green condom.
He was later alleged to have told police: ''I have spent #200 on her.
Why can't I do what I did to her?''
He was sentenced to three years in jail, reduced on appeal to two
years, and was released from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire at
the end of September after serving a year.
Mr Marsh said Diggle had effectively not practised law for about two
years, so a one-year ban was the fair and right way to deal with the
situation.
''We feel that, in this particular case, a suspension is the
appropriate order,'' he said.
After the hearing, Diggle refused to speak but his counsel, Mr Michael
Borrelli, said: ''Mr Diggle hopes to have the opportunity from everybody
to put this matter behind him.
''He would also like to thank members of the press and a great many
members of the public who have offered him support.''
Afterwards, a family law practitioner, Mr Martin Mears, said: ''I am
surprised at this result because I would have thought either he would
have been struck off or not brought before the tribunal at all.
''The question is whether he was an intended rapist or not. If he was,
then he should be struck off. If he was not, then he shouldn't have been
sentenced in the first place and should never have appeared before a
tribunal.
''This suspension doesn't make sense. He is in a half-way house.''
Mr Richard Ferguson QC, who represented Diggle in the Court of Appeal
last year, said his former client had been punished enough.
''Punishment must be appropriate and not vindictive. If the Law
Society think it appropriate to give him this chance, then that is a
matter for them.
''He has served his debt to society,'' he said.

Del Boy would be proud of British Coal as it disposes of properties
ranging from a go-cart track to 16,000 acres of Scottish farmland.
IF THE privatisation of the coalfields was, as billed, the sale of the
century, then we are now in the era of the car boot sales. British Coal
announced yesterday that it is to sell 150,000 acres of land and 7000
properties, ranging from a go-cart track in Staffordshire to 160 farms
covering 16,000 Scottish acres.
Last year it was a #3bn business, this year it's Del Boy doing the biz
with an end-of-the-range assortment to complete the privatisation
package.
The sale of the agricultural land, housing and commercial properties
will begin in March and is to be completed by the spring of next year.
In Scotland, the farms are in Fife, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and the
Lothians. Much of the farmland was acquired when the industry was
nationalised and the old National Coal Board formed in 1947, some has
been bought since for operational reasons. Other swathes of land were
purchased for prospective open cast mining.
There are 800 houses for sale, only a handful in Scotland. The miners'
rows, or what remain of them, have long since disappeared here. Many
have been bought, either by local authorities, local trusts, or retired
colliers. Most, like the industry, have been demolished.
Fears that tenant farmers would have the land many had worked for
generations sold from under their soil rich feet receded yesterday. They
had been lobbying MPs, believing that British Coal intended to sell off
the farms in parcels.
Fife farmer Robert Nelson thinks they may have forced a change of mind
and policy by highlighting their concerns, but yesterday a BC spokesman
claimed it was always the intention to sell to sitting tenants who
wanted to buy. ''What we are saying is that tenants who have expressed a
serious interest will get the opportunity to buy. We want to do business
with them,'' he said.
Which was a relief for Mr Nelson who farms 250 acres at Blair Mains,
near Culross in Fife. He and his family have been tenant farmers of the
coal board since 1926. He was afraid an asset stripper would buy his
carefully turned acres as part of a job lot of agricultural land to sell
off in bits and bobs. He said: ''It's been a worrying time. If we are
being given the chance to buy our farms, that is a tremendous outcome.''
The remaining properties will form three categories, agricultural,
commercial and housing, which will be sold as packages on the open
market.
It is reckoned that the Scottish farmlands will raise around #10m for
the Treasury.
The commercial properties, ranging from old laboratories to disused
offices, will be sold as packages of around a dozen. They include old
collieries, such as Bilston Glen now converted to use for managed
workshops.
The British Coal spokesman appeared slightly cagey about the precise
location of any of the others: ''We are not sure exactly where they
are,'' he confided. He was, we think, joking.
He did know that there are 1900 acres of woodland in the sale, 500 of
which are in Scotland. Although he could not say where exactly.
''All these details will be made available when we pull the packages
together,'' he said.
He could though, without any difficulty at all, pinpoint one
remarkable item in the sale. It is a leisure centre, Trentham Gardens,
in North Staffordshire, complete with golf driving range, golf club,
go-cart track, conference centre, water sports, and all manner of
thrilling rides.
We liked the spokesman too much to ask why, exactly, the coal industry
felt it necessary to own a 700-acre leisure complex, but he told us
anyway: ''We bought it from the man who owned Alton Towers who had
gazumped us when we tried to buy it earlier.
''We had been mining nearby and started digging underneath and we
thought it might cost a fortune if we landed ourselves with massive
subsidence claims so instead we bought it.''
So far, the sale of the nation's coal assets has raised #950m for the
Treasury. Another half-dozen ancillary coal activities remain to be
disposed off, mainly producers of coal products, such as the country's
biggest manfacturer of smokeless fuel. The Centris Pension Centre at
Sheffield which handles pensions of 500,000 coal pensioners, thousands
of whom are in Scotland, will also be sold.
Apart from sales to tenants, which will attract discounts, there are
unlikely to be massive bargains to be had. British Coal has been told by
the Treasury to raise as much as it can, as fast as it can. Then, much
like Del Boy, it is expected to disappear, sharpish.

POLICE were last night searching for a 26-year-old prisoner who failed
to report back to Dungavel Open Prison, Strathaven, near Hamilton, after
a 48-hour home leave. Michael Robertson, from Edinburgh, was sentenced
to eight years' imprisonment for culpable homicide at the High Court in
Edinburgh in January, 1992. A Scottish Prisons Service spokesman said:
''The prisoner's recent conduct while in custody does not indicate he is
a danger to the public.''

TESCO is to fall into line with other leading supermarkets and stop
importing Dutch veal, as anger over live animal exports from Britain
mounted. It is to buy veal produced by a ''high welfare'' rearing system
in England. However, there was renewed anger among animal welfare groups
over plans to ship animals from a port in Essex and a protest at Swansea
after a plan to airlift veal calves to Europe was unveiled. Meanwhile
the National Farmers' Union of Scotland said high-quality veal could be
produced and processed in Scotland, but caterers appeared to prefer the
imported product.

A MAN who cut a little boy's penis was yesterday described by a
sheriff as a sadist.
James Tulloch was convicted of the attack, which has left the
youngster scarred for life, by a jury at Falkirk Sheriff Court after a
three-day trial.
Sheriff Albert Sheehan warned the truck driver he faced a jail
sentence.
The jury had heard how the base of three-year-old's penis had been cut
three-quarters of the way round its circumference by a knife.
Dr George Farmer, consultant paediatrician at Falkirk Royal Infirmary,
said he had never seen an injury like it in his 15-year career.
The jury convicted Tulloch, 38, of Ettrick Court, Hallglen, Falkirk,
of cutting the boy's penis at a house in Grangemouth.
Sheriff Sheehan told Tulloch: ''You have been convicted of what can
only be described as a cruel and sadistic attack on a three-year-old
child.
''I've got to give the most serious consideration to a custodial
disposal.''
The sheriff deferred sentence for a fortnight for reports and remanded
Tulloch in custody.
Tulloch also admitted a breach of bail conditions.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Allan Stewart last night received another
lukewarm reaction after announcing aid to meet the costs of last month's
flooding in Strathclyde.
He told the regional council that the Government would allow it to
borrow an additional #1.37m for repairs, mostly to the area's roads and
sewage system.
However, the council is still facing a shortfall of about #3m on its
flood bill, which is now almost #10m. The deficit will have to be met
from within the current year's budget, although no decisions have been
taken on where savings should be made.
Mr Stewart, the Scottish Local Government Minister, said the increase
in Strathclyde's capital borrowing consent followed a council request.
Regional convener Councillor Bill Perry said: ''This does represent a
positive response from the Scottish Office to a particular request.
''However, it does not represent new money and simply allows the
council to borrow to meet our costs.''

WHEN is a Conservative MP not a Conservative MP? It sounds a simple
enough question but by the time the Commons got through attempting to
answer it yesterday, working out the number of angels who could be
accommodated on the head of a pin seemed plain sailing.
This was, in fact, one of the most important debates we will see this
session because at stake was the Government's ability to keep a majority
of one on all the standing committees that go through Bills line by
line. The dangers to all Government legislation were sufficient to have
Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the House, declare with utter conviction that
if you are elected as a Tory and say you are a Tory then you are a Tory.
As the eight Tories who had the party whip removed for rebelling on
Europe in a vote of confidence and the one who later unwhipped himself
declare they are Tories too, all seemed to be well. But can you be a
rebel and still count as one of the Government's supporters at the same
time. Is it fair? Is it British? It was certainly the latter as the
debate made clear that in its reliance on unwritten conventions the
Conservative Party runs the British constitution a close second.
Will we be treated the same as other Tory MPs, Sir Teddy Taylor
enquired. Mr Newton said the party powers that be would not wish or seek
to exclude the rebels from being selected to serve on committees.
Another rebel, Mr Tony Marlow, prowled round this offer in the manner
of a bomb disposal officer examining a dodgy object. It just didn't seem
quite right, he mused. Mr Newton repeated the formula as one might hope
to get through to a foreigner whose language one does not speak, by
repeating it more loudly.
The mysteries of the Commons Committee of Selection were laid bare and
like many mysteries found singularly barren when exposed to the light of
day. The committee accept proposals for membership of standing
committees put forward by the two main parties without demur and only
need trouble itself to adjudicate if the amiable Archy Kirkwood, the
Liberal Democrat Chief Whip, cannot produce a single candidate from
applicants from all the other parties for whom he is responsible.
Mr Kirkwood produced a little explosion of his own by revealing that
he had acted for Mr Rupert Allason, the Torbay MP, when he lost the Tory
Whip. On that occasion, the Tories on the selection committee accepted
that Mr Allason was, temporarily, not ''one of us''.
Now, it seemed, things were different. They were. Without the rebel
nine, the Government has no overall majority. But how bad is it to lose
the whip? Is my punishment going to continue indefinitely, moaned Mr
Christopher Gill. Mr Nicholas Budgen, admittedly with his tongue in his
cheek, wondered how the rebels could ''crawl back by a display of abject
loyalty'' if they did not receive the whip notice telling them how
urgent or not each vote was.
Mrs Anne Taylor and Mr Jeff Rooker banged on about how superior Labour
was in having rules for every eventuality including rebellion, of which
Labour Governments have certainly had their fair share. It emerged that
Labour rebels are expected to carry on voting for and supporting the
party as before while they work their passage back which, Mr Newton
triumphantly exclaimed, was exactly the Government's position.
Indeed, Mr Newton assured the rebels of his goodwill towards them so
fervently that Mr Bryan Davies from Labour's back benches enquired:
''Where's the punishment?''
Mr Norman Lamont, hovering protectively over the rebels, suggested the
Government were denying the logic of their own position in withdrawing
the whip and then insisting that the malcontents be counted as Tories
anyway.
Sir Michael Neubert fell on his face when inviting Mrs Taylor to
produce a scrap of evidence that the eight who had the whip withdrawn
had disowned their basic Tory loyalty. Mrs Taylor smartly replied that
to vote against the Tory Prime Minister in a vote of confidence seemed a
rather strong piece of evidence.
Mr Major has pursued a rather bewildering stick-and-carrot approach
which has left the media as well, probably, as the rebels, in a spin.
Sometimes it has been sackcloth-and-ashes for an unspecified but longish
time before forgiveness could be considered. Then it becomes likely that
a great reunion is just over the horizon. Yesterday was carrot day.
After all, the Government's majority on every Commons committee was at
stake and everyone knows the answer to the question -- when is a
Government in really deep trouble?

LORD Nolan's inquiry into standards in public life begins next week,
but neither the Prime Minister nor Baroness Thatcher are to give
evidence.
Leader of the Commons Tony Newton and David Hunt, the Minister for
Open Government, will be the most senior politicians to appear during
the six-week inquiry.
The committee was set up by John Major under the chairmanship of Lord
Nolan, a senior judge, after a spate of ''sleaze'' allegations were
levelled against his Government and MPs.
Its first investigation will concentrate on MPs, ministers and civil
servants and quangos, including NHS trusts, and is due to report to the
Prime Minister by May.
Mr Major, Labour leader Tony Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy
Ashdown were not invited to give evidence because their views on
standards in public life were already on record, committee sources said.

LOW-flying RAF jets crossing the flight path of passenger aircraft
around Prestwick could cause ''another Lockerbie-type disaster,''
Ayrshire MP Mr George Foulkes claimed yesterday.
He said the danger was due to the ''completeley daft'' decision to
abolish the control zone around the airport on March 3 last year, about
which no public statement was made.
The zone limited flights within it in the interests of air safety.
Transport Minister Steven Norris told Mr Foulkes that the Civil
Aviation Authority abolished the zone on March 3, 1994, and added that
regular reviews of such zones were carried out ''to identify those
portions that are under utilised or no longer serve the purpose for
which they were established.''
He added: ''Such a review showed that the number of passenger public
transport aircraft using Prestwick airport had declined to the level
where provision of controlled airsapce was no longer necessary.''
Mr Foulkes said: ''This decision is based on false or outdated
information. Traffic at Prestwick is now growing rapidly, with regular
passenger flights to Dublin and large and growing numbers of holiday
flights to Europe and North America.
''As a result of the change, RAF jets are now able to, and are
regularly, flying down to 250ft in the former control zone, crossing the
flight of passenger aircraft and creating the possibility of another
Lockerbie type disaster.''
He called on PIK, the new owners of the airport and everyone concerned
about the safety of flyers, passengers and those below the flightpath to
join an urgent campaign to have the decision reversed.

Stephen McGregor reports on a plan which would put Scotland in a
different time zone from the rest of the UK
TORY peer Viscount Mountgarret found himself being described as a
''time bandit'' last night as he put forward a proposal to put England,
Wales and Northern Ireland into the sinister-sounding European-time
zone.
Scotland literally found itself left behind -- by an hour to be
precise -- by the Mountgarret plan, which would see clocks everywhere
else in the UK put forward an hour to line up most of Britain with most
of Europe.
Scots are horrified by the idea which, it is widely believed, is to
allow the south of England to enjoy an extra hour of cricket of an
evening.
The Bill was given a formal second reading in the Lords, but,
realistically, has no chance of becoming law.
If the idea were applied to Scotland, it would mean that if the sun
rose at 9am in London it would be at least 10am, or even 11am, in
Scotland before children could walk to school in daylight, farm workers
could take to the fields in daylight and construction workers could work
without the use of floodlights.
Lord Mountgarret has recognised the difficulties his Central European
Time Bill would cause north of the Border -- the farther north you go
the worse it gets -- and therefore has taken the view that Scotland
should be excluded from the Bill.
This, of course, would mean the somewhat farcical situation whereby,
for example, Dumfries would be in a different time zone from Carlisle --
but who ever said that politics was sensible?
Last night, Lord Mountgarret said he had excluded Scotland from the
Bill so that the Scots could reach their own view. He claimed, however,
that ''the Scottish tail was wagging the English dog.''
Responses to a Government consultation document showed 96% of England,
Wales and Northern Ireland wanted Central European Time. Only the Scots
wanted to keep the status quo, and it seemed wrong that this should
prevent any change.
During the debate, Lord Mountgarret said that Scots, for example, had
a different legal system and different laws on Sunday shopping, so
surely they could have a different time. ''Why not have a change of
time-zone at Hadrian's Wall?'' he asked. ''If they feel like it, they
can opt into this Bill rather than opt out.''
Liberal Democrat peer Lord Jenkins of Hillhead said he would not like
to see a ''time frontier'' between Scotland and England, and argued that
perhaps it was reasonable to offer Scots the option of making up their
own minds.
However, he was persuaded that, in general, the Moungtarret plans
would be of benefit to the majority of the population.
In contrast, party colleague Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP Charles
Kennedy earlier dismissed the move as ''silly season.'' He said: ''I
have never understood the fixation with trying to put the Heel of Italy
on the same time zone as the Butt of Lewis.
Kincardine and Deeside Tory MP George Kynoch said: ''It would be
ridiculous and totally counter to the whole philosophy of having a
United Kingdom. I am confident this Bill will get nowhere.''
The SNP took, as it were, a dim view of the whole matter. Its
spokesman, Angus East MP Andrew Welsh, coined the phrase ''time bandit''
and said that he saw absolutely no reason to interfere with the present
system. ''This is being brought in for the convenience of the southern
English and should never have been introduced in the first place,'' he
said.
''Women and children in Scotland would be walking to work and to
school in the pitch dark. If this Bill ever reaches the Statute Book,
Scotland should have nothing to do with it.''
Mr Welsh probably can rest easy. Scottish Secretary Ian Lang is known
to be strongly opposed to the Mountgarret proposals and, even though
they managed to get through the Lords last night, they are likely to be
shot down once they reach the Commons, if for no other reason than the
lack of parliamentary time.
The Home Office, which deals with these matters, took a relaxed view
of the whole affair. Government Whip Baroness Trumpington acknowledged
there would be difficulties both for the transport system between
Scotland and England and for London-based companies who would have to
bear the time difference in mind when phoning offices in Glasgow or
Edinburgh.
She told the House: ''We have not rejected the argument for change,
but neither are we so convinced by it that we wish to act on this matter
now.''

I'M GOING to let you into a little secret. For many years, I nourished
the ambition to change the name of the Scottish National Party. Before
SNP supporters choke on their All Bran, I should stress that, after
mature reflection, I have given up the idea.
I had long thought that the ''Scottish Independence Party'' or SIP
would be a much better formulation, offer a more up-to-date
encapsulation of what our party is all about and one which wouldn't
allow our political opponents to deliberately misinterpret where we
stand.
I eventually gave up on the notion and the wisdom of that decision was
confirmed for me last year during a dinner in Edinburgh to celebrate the
SNP sixtieth anniversary. There were a number of the party's founding
members in attendance and what was outstanding and evident about all of
those brave spirits was their pride in their party's achievements over
the years.
To change the name of the SNP would be to place at risk that loyalty
and commitment as well as embroiling the party in an agonised debate
which would be welcomed only by our unionist opponents. It would also
have been just plain wrong.
A political leader has a right, indeed a responsibility, to shape and
to change the party he leads. However, the leader has no arbitrary
authority over the party's history and should not attempt to buy the
future by mortgaging that past.
As Tony Blair was about to launch his campaign on Clause 4 last
October, he was preceded at the conference microphone by two Labour
stalwarts each receiving their long-service medals.
Perhaps the new leader should have listened to these old members
before launching his crusade against his own party's history.
Now he is in the troughs of an internal debate which he himself
provoked. Of course, when he started the argument he didn't think that
there would be much serious opposition to his plans -- just enough to
convince the leader writers in the Tory press that he had earned his
spurs by doing down what is left of the left.
Now things are starting to become unstuck and as he showed yesterday
Bambi clearly doesn't take kindly to being contradicted. According to
Blair, his Euro-MPs are now ''infantile'' and ''incompetent'' and stand
accused of presenting a political gift to the Tories.
Labour, of course, has been here before. Neil Kinnock recanted on a
lifetime of unilateralism just as the Cold War was ending and it was the
possession rather than the removal of Trident missiles which was
becoming incredible.
Not for the first time, therefore, the pursuit of approval in the Tory
press is leading Labour up another blind alley. The extent to which the
Blair adherents are willing to rubbish their own party and its history
speaks volumes for the internal damage this process risks for Labour.
Helen Liddell, one of the very few Scots MPs prepared to put her
weight behind the leadership line, complains that there are ''so many
conservatives in the Labour Party'' while the deputy leader derides
Clause 4 as the irrelevant product of middle-class intellectuals.
There was a time when Labour valued its intellectuals and how
shortsighted and foolish of the Webbs not to realise that political
expediency might prove attractive to the Labour leadership some 70 years
later!
No doubt, Blair will get his way in the end but the damage done to
Labour's self belief will be very severe. The road down which he is
leading Labour is not European social democracy, with its balance
between private- sector freedom and public sector responsibility.
The Labour leader is to all intents and purposes a British Tory -- a
smiling one certainly but still a Tory nonetheless.

THE Government last night won a crucial Commons vote to retain its
majority of one on all standing committees which consider Bills line by
line. Defeat could have meant disruption of its legislative programme.
It was assisted by five of the nine Euro-rebels whose loss of the Whip
placed the Government in difficulties. The other four abstained.
In the course of the debate, Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the Commons,
hinted that a reconcilation with the rebels might be near.
The Government's problem was caused when the number of Tory MPs taking
the Whip fell below half the membership of the Commons. Labour claimed
it should no longer have a majority on committees and Ministers decided
that the matter should be settled on the floor of the House.
Mr Newton gave assurances that the Government would not seek to block
the rebels from membership of committees on which they wished to serve.
One rebel, Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow) asked why the Government did
not simply restore the whip to them.
Mr Newton replied: ''It has been made very clear by the Prime Minister
and others that all of us wish to see this situation resolved as
speedily as possible.''
Labour spokeswoman Mrs Ann Taylor argued that the rebels could no
longer be counted as supporters of a Government they had failed to back
in a vote of confidence.
Mr Newton argued that the rebels were elected as Conservatives and
were still members of the party. Neither had they indicated they wanted
to start a party of their own, join another party or sit as
independents.
However, Mrs Taylor accused Ministers of ''trying to bave it both
ways'' while Liberal Democrat Chief Whip, Mr Archy Kirkwood, said ''They
are trying to have their cake and eat it.''
The Labour amendment which would have stripped the Government of its
committee majority was easily defeated by 327 votes to 285, a Government
majority of 42.
The Government motion stating that only if a Government lost its
Commons majority through by-election defeats and MPs joining other
parties should it lose its committee majority was carried by 325 votes
to 288, a majority of 37.
The five rebels who supported the Government motion were: Sir Richard
Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton
South-West), Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Sir Teddy Taylor
(Southend East) and Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip Northwood).
The four who abstained were: Mr Michael Carttiss (Great Yarmouth), Mr
Christopher Gill (Ludlow), Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay) and Mr Tony
Marlow (Northampton North).
Mr Norman Lamont , the former Chancellor, voted with the Government
despite arguing in an intervention that the Government was defying the
logic of its initial action in withdrawing the whip.
Mr John Biffen (Oswestry) a former Leader of the House, voted against
the Opposition amendment but abstained on the Government motion.
The United Ulster Unionists backed the Government.

<TEXT>
LABOUR is to seek to abolish the not proven verdict when the
Government's planned Scottish law reforms begin their committee stage in
the Lords today.
Lord Macaulay of Bragar, the party's front-bench Lords spokesman on
Scottish legal affairs, said Labour would also challenge Government
amendments, which appeared to erode the ''right to silence''.
Labour is also to press for courts to treat racial motivation as an
''aggravating factor'' in criminal court sentencing.
The amendments will be to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which
seeks to streamline court procedures and introduce tough new measures in
areas like offending on bail.
Lord Macaulay said that the not proven verdict had become
''increasingly outdated''. He said: ''As it stands, this verdict hampers
justice and leaves the accused in a sort of judicial limbo.''
On the right to silence, he said that any attempt to use an accused
person's absence from the witness box as evidence supporting the Crown
case should generally be resisted.
Meanwhile Labour MP John McFall claimed last night to have evidence
that Ministers plan to avoid detailed Commons scrutiny of changes in the
way crime victims are compensated after a hostile court ruling.
Mr McFall (Dumbarton) demanded a statement from Home Secretary Michael
Howard on a document he said came from a Cabinet committee.

STUDENT leaders will today demand a public inquiry into administrative
blunders at the Glasgow-based Student Loans Company which has caused
undergraduates great hardship.
The request will be made by student activists from 10 representative
British universities.
The president of Edinburgh University Students' Association, Mr
Stephen Magee, said an inquiry was essential because the system
introduced to speed up loan applications from existing borrowers had
broken down.
He said: ''Students relied on this system to provide money to live on.
There is no option.''
The company now accepts that there were ''totally unacceptable''
delays in processing loans for existing borrowers. It has given
assurances that the errors would not be repeated.
Mr Magee welcomed the fact the company, which is under an
investigation arising from allegations of fraud, had ''at last'' agreed
to meet student representatives.

A MAN cleared of a bank raid charge 10 months ago and who has also
served a jail sentence for armed robbery was shot dead in a Glasgow
street yesterday yards from his home.
Mr William Dearie, 32, a bricklayer, was waiting for a lift to work
from a colleague near his tenement home in Tollcross Road, near Parkhead
Cross, at about 7.25 yesterday morning when a gunman ran up and shot him
in the back.
The gunman then jumped into a waiting car which sped off the wrong way
down a one-way street towards West Muir Street.
Police have not yet established a motive for the killing, and have
refused to comment on suggestions that Mr Dearie was the victim of a
gangland feud.
However, one local man, who declined to be named, said Mr Dearie had
been subjected to a series of warnings in recent years.
The local man added: ''There have been several shootings in this area
recently. It was only a matter of time before someone bought it.''
Mr Dearie was jailed for four years at the High Court in Glasgow in
1990 for raiding a city supermarket with an imitation gun.
Last March, he was cleared at the same court of robbing the TSB
Anniesland branch in the city's Great Western Road at gunpoint after two
experts clashed over pictures taken by a hidden camera.
Neighbours, wakened by ''three or four loud bangs'', yesterday raised
the alarm after finding Mr Dearie slumped against a wall.
He was rushed to Glasgow Royal Infirmary by ambulance, accompanied by
his wife, Carole, 29, and three-week-old daughter, Jade, where he died
after a 90-minute battle to save him.
Relatives of Mr Dearie gathered at the home of his father, William, in
Cockenzie Street, Shettleston, where one family member said: ''We are
too upset to speak to anyone.''
A 400-yard stretch of Tollcross Road was closed to traffic for most of
yesterday as forensic experts and police searched the area. Detectives
also carried out door-to-door inquiries.
Mr Dearie's great aunt, Mrs Georgina Green, who lived in the next
close to him in Tollcross Road, burst into tears after returning from
church when she learned the identity of the dead man from journalists
gathered at the murder scene.
A near neighbour of Mr Dearie, Mrs Jeanette Simpson, 59, jumped from
her bed after hearing ''three loud bangs''.
She ran out into the street, where she was joined by two other
neighbours, and saw a man slumped in the pavement and lying against the
wall. ''He was screaming, moaning, and groaning,'' she said.
A man who lives nearby but who declined to be named described how he
heard ''three loud cracks'' and, seconds later, saw the gunman jumping
into a moving car.
The man said he looked out of the kitchen window and saw a man wearing
a balaclava and dark clothing rushing towards a small, dark-coloured car
which had been parked outside the Salvation Army hall.
He added: ''I have seen a lot in my time but you are always shocked
when something like this happens close to your own doorstep.''
Detective Superintendent John Campbell said: ''Two or three shots were
fired. But we are not prepared to say how many times he was hit.''
Police have appealed for more witnesses, particularly the driver of an
orange Ford Transit van which was travelling east along Tollcross Road
near Mr Dearie's home at the time of the shooting.
Detectives will question drivers who normally use the route from just
after 7.15 this morning to see if they have any information about the
attack.

DOCTORS at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness were yesterday still
investigating an infection which killed a twin baby from Nairn. It is
not, however, thought to be meningitis.
Sophie and Emma Cabrielli were admitted to the hospital on Monday with
a suspected viral infection but, despite the efforts of staff, Sophie,
thought to be just 10 months old, died that day. Parents Nina Cabrelli
and Allan Walker have asked that no condition report on Emma be given by
the hospital.
A hospital spokesman said: ''Naturally, the parents of the children
are very distressed by this tragic occurrence and the hospital has
extended its profound sympathy to them.
''Investigations into the cause of death are continuing. However,
there is absolutely no reason to suspect the presence of meningococcus
or any other notifiable disease and accordingly no formal notification
under public health legislation has been made to the health board.''

appointment which, he claimed, was a tribute to its staff and work.
Professor David Ingram, 53, has been elected by the Royal
Horticultural Society as an honorary Professor of Horticulture.
The three-year appointment, announced in London, is the first of its
kind in the RHS's 190-year history.
Last night, Professor Ingram, who once worked with Birmingham City
Parks Department, said he was accepting the RHS professorship on behalf

LABOUR and union leaders yesterday reacted angrily to news that more
than 2000 jobs could be axed in the food, finance, and manufacturing
sectors at a time when the Government continues to claim that Britain is
fast emerging from recession.
Almost 1000 of the jobs to go will be as a result of a decision by
leading snack food producer United Biscuits to close its KP Foods
factory in Grimsby, Humberside, and transfer the work to two other
plants.
Up to 460 jobs will be created by the transfer of crisp and snack food
production to Teesside and Ashby de la Zouch, Leicestershire, according
to the company.
Birmingham-based Wesleyan Assurance Society is to axe 350 jobs over
the coming months, partly due to increased competition.
Meanwhile, a top union leader called on the Government to intervene to
save the jobs of 750 workers at ABB's train building firm in York, which
is threatened with closure later this year because of a lack of orders.
Union officials are seeking urgent talks with the Swedish company
which three years ago took over the 150-year-old plant from British Rail
Engineering.
Fears for the York factory had been growing since the start of the
privatisation process which has led to the virtual collapse of orders
for new rolling stock by British Rail.
Labour employment spokesman Ian McCartney said the job losses were a
''bitter blow'' and added: ''It is a major dent in the Government's
assertion that the recession is over. It is another example of why there
is no feel-good factor -- when people set off for work, they fear it
could be their last day of employment.''

European Editor
in Brussels
EURO-MPs flexed their new Maastricht muscles again yesterday by
threatening to reject nominees for the incoming European Commission next
week.
After a series of congressional-style interrogations of the proposed
20-strong Commission, they reported formally yesterday that they had
significant difficulties with five of the nominees and misgivings about
the distribution of some portfolios.
Under Maastricht, the European Parliament has the power to veto the
entire Commission but not its individual members. A vote will be taken
on the issue next Wednesday at the assembly's monthly plenary in
Strasbourg.
Mr Klaus Hansch, President of the Parliament, said: ''It is perfectly
possible to imagine a situation where the European Parliament would not
confirm the Commission.''
However, Mr Hansch refused to say what changes, if any, the parliament
would demand between now and the vote.
In the next few days, Mr Jacques Santer, Commission
President-designate in succession to Mr Jacques Delors, must either
change the composition of his proposed executive or shuffle some
portfolios.
Otherwise he will have to go before a Parliament with an unchanged
proposal and call Euro-MPs' bluff.
If the assembly vetoed the incoming Commission it would paralyse the
European Union and inflame passions in various member states, causing a
Europe-wide constitutional crisis.
Both British nominees -- Sir Leon Brittan (trade with developed
countries) and Mr Neil Kinnock (transport) -- were endorsed by
committees, who said their performances were impressive.
Criticisms were made of five proposed Commissioners -- Mrs Anita
Gradin of Sweden (immigration and judicial affairs); Mr Erkki Liikanen
of Finland (budget); Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy of France (economic and
monetary affairs); Mrs Ritt Bjerregaard of Denmark (environment); and Mr
Padraig Flynn of Ireland (social affairs and equal opportunities).
Euro-MPs asked Mr Hansch to urge Mr Santer to give responsibility for
equal opportunities to another Commissioner.

THE Government yesterday announced plans to trace people who may have
been infected with the dangerous liver disease Hepatitis C after
undergoing blood transfusions.
It is widely believed that, in the UK, around 1000 blood donors suffer
from Hepatitis C, and some may have given blood regularly.
From this figure, health officials calculate about 3000 people across
the country could be infected.
The scheme, outlined by the Government, will apply only to people who
had transfusions before September 1991. Since then, all donated blood
has been routinely tested for antibodies to the virus.
Scottish health officials explained yesterday that, while more than
five million people underwent surgery in Scottish hospitals during the
past decade, only a small proportion of these will have had a
transfusion. They estimate that fewer than 300 in Scotland will have
been exposed to the Hepatitis C virus.
Dr Jeremy Metters, the Government's deputy chief medical officer,
said: ''We are afraid that doctors may be besieged and we have sent to
GPs details of the programme and questions they are likely to be
asked.''
Professor John Cash, national medical director of the Scottish
National Blood Transfusion Service, added: ''We shall be doing all we
can to work with patients' doctors to trace the very small number of
patients concerned.''

The nurse is said to have performed the surgery on a male patient at
the Treliske hospital in Truro, Cornwall.
The patient made a complete recovery but unions have demanded a public
inquiry into the incident.
Mr Trevor Parsons, regional officer of the health union Unison, said:
''She is alleged to have made an incision, taken the appendix out, and
sewed up the patient.
''I am led to believe the patient made a full recovery from the
operation but that is not the point.

management to investigate whether any situations like this have happened
in the past.''
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust said: ''We are carrying out a full

Sarajevo, Wednesday
UN officials held drawn-out ceasefire talks with Bosnian government
and Serb military leaders today as international envoys began a new
peace mission to former Yugoslavia.
The UN military commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir Michael
Rose, chaired a joint meeting of Serb, Croat and Muslim armies chiefs at
Sarajevo airport which lasted into the evening.
Rose is trying to reach agreement on more details of implementing the
four-month ceasefire following a dispute over a demilitarised zone near
the Bosnian capital.
The UN peacekeeping force sent yet another foot patrol to the Mount
Igman demilitarised zone to check if Muslim-led government troops had
vacated it as promised under the truce.
UN sources said a United Nations patrol caught 151 Bosnian troops
inside the zone on Monday night even though government leaders had
insisted the withdrawal had been completed.
Renewed fighting around the Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwest
Bosnia also threatened to derail the ceasefire but UN officers said they
did not judge truce violations around the area today to be significant.
UN spokesman Major Herve Gourmelon said UN observers recorded 200
artillery explosions and a similar number of small arms bursts around
Velika Kladusa in the north of the Bihac pocket in the last 24 hours.
But he said no infantry activity was reported and described the
shooting as insignificant in the overall context of the ceasefire.
The clashes appeared to pit Bihac's Bosnian government army defenders
against rebel Muslims loyal to maverick warlord Fikret Abdic but not the
Krajina Serbs from Croatia who had previously fought alongside Abdic's
men.
Neither the Krajina Serbs nor rebel Muslims have signed the December
31 agreement for a four-month cessation of hostilities.
''We have indications . . . that the Krajina Serbs have withdrawn
progressively from the area over the past few days,'' Gourmelon said. A
withdrawal of the Krajina Serbs from the enclave would be a major boost
to the ceasefire.
A firm truce would also help officials from the contact group nations
-- Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- on a tour
of former Yugoslavia to revive an overall peace settlement to end nearly
three years of war in Bosnia.
The officials had talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and
planned to head for Sarajevo to meet Bosnian government leaders before
going to the Bosnian Serb stronghold in nearby Pale.
The envoys will seek to persuade Bosnian Serb leaders to accept their
plan which apportions 51% of territory to a Muslim-Croat federation and
49% to Bosnia's Serbs, who currently control more than two-thirds of
Bosnia.
In Washington, the State Department denied yesterday that there were
differences with the Bosnian government over the peace plan. It insisted
that Bosnia's Serbs must accept the plan before fresh talks could begin
between the warring factions.
Developments elsewhere in Bosnia showed that the ceasefire agreement
was under strain. Increased Bosnian government troop movements were
noticed in southwestern Bosnia, in the Mostar region in particular.
Tensions rose around the UN-protected Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia when Bosnian Serbs started moving troops close to front
lines. ''This provoked small arms fire from the Bosnian government
side,'' Gourmelon said.
He also said Bosnian government troops were blockading the
UN-controlled Tuzla airfield in northern Bosnia in a protest over the
stationing of a Serb liaison officer there under terms of the truce
accord.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Wednesday
CALIFORNIA got some relief from torrential rains today, but
forecasters warned that new Pacific storms are on the way.
President Clinton declared a disaster and ordered federal aid for the
area.
In a message of support, he assured California flood victims today
that help was on the way and vowed: ''We'll be with you for the long
haul.''
Thousands of people have been driven from their homes and entire towns
are under water. Damage has been estimated at hundreds of millions of
pounds.
Forecasters predicted more rain in southern California later today and
two other Pacific storms were expected to hit the state by the weekend.
At least six people have been killed since the downpour began last
week, including several motorists whose cars were hit by falling trees.
The body of a 12-year-old boy who drowned in a swollen creek in Orange
County yesterday as he and other members of his family tried to cross it
was found early today by a rescue team.
A search also was underway at the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base in
southern California for an officer who was apparently swept away by a
torrent of water as he led his unit on routine exercises.
Clinton's declaration of a disaster area came almost a year after
parts of California were hit by a powerful earthquake that killed 61
people and devastated parts of Los Angeles.

Grozny, Wednesday
RUSSIAN forces launched new attacks on the presidential palace in the
battered Chechen capital Grozny today while warplanes screamed overhead,
sending residents scattering in panic.
Artillery shells slammed twice into the building, symbol of Chechen
resistance, sending tiles showering from ceilings.
Chechnya's separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, appearing for the first
time in three weeks, called for Russia to stop fighting and start
negotiating.
''A military solution has no chance,'' Dudayev, dressed in military
fatigues and cap, told a news conference in the darkened west of his
battered capital which has been under heavy Russian bombardment since
New Year.
''The only chance is for a peaceful settlement. This conflict can only
by solved by peace. Every day of physical confrontation brings crisis,
crisis in Chechnya and crisis in Russia.''
In Moscow, the Russian parliament met in emergency session but
deputies shied away from liberal moves to halt the army campaign
launched on December 11 by President Boris Yeltsin.
The head of the Federation Council upper house of parliament, Vladimir
Shumeiko, said Yeltsin and top officials had decided to start disarming
all illegal armed groups across Russia.
Interfax news agency also quoted Shumeiko as saying the Russian army's
general staff would be split away from the defence ministry and
subordinated directly to Yeltsin.
The new chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse
Helms, added his voice to growing foreign criticism by saying Yeltsin
risked losing US aid if the ''brutality'' continued in Chechnya.
In Grozny, Dudayev's appearance made a mockery of Russian claims that
he ''no longer existed''.
Dudayev laughed off these reports, saying he had been travelling
outside the rebel region to drum up support for his cause. He
unilaterally declared independence from Russia in 1991, but Russia only
responded with tanks last December.
A 48-hour ceasefire, declared by Russia but violated from the start by
both sides, was due formally to expire at 8am (0500 GMT) tomorrow with
little sign that the Chechens were prepared to lay down their arms.
Aliv Musayad, 38, wearing the Muslim green head-band of a hardcore
Chechen fighter, said: ''There is no ceasefire. We have a couple of
Russian units surrounded. As soon as they put down their weapons, they
can have a ceasefire.''
But the city was quieter than for many days except for the area north
of the Sunzha river around the presidential palace.
Many residents used the relative calm to flee before heavy fighting
resumed. Trucks loaded with refugees roared away for the relative safety
of hill towns to the south and west.
A Western cameraman said six adults died and five children attempting
to flee the fighting were injured when a Russian shell slammed into
their Grozny refuge late yesterday.
The order to disband armed groups was issued at a meeting between
Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and parliament chamber
heads. It extended throughout Russia the treatment of Chechen
separatists as ''illegal armed gangs''.
Shumeiko told Interfax news agency the move was targetted at private
armies, but many political experts fear the Chechen crisis could herald
tougher policies inside Russia.
Placing Yeltsin in control of the general staff extends his
considerable direct power over the ex-KGB counter-intelligence and
communications units, interior and defence ministries, his own guards
and several elite armed squads.
General staff chief Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov said he was
very surprised by the decision and warned that taking hasty measures
would cause a lot of harm, Interfax said.
Interfax also quoted the Federation Council's press service as saying
Chernomyrdin backed the idea of making an urgent visit to Chechnya to
discuss ways of rebuilding the region's economy. The report could not
immediately be confirmed.
* Russian jets bombed a border village in the northern Afghan province
of Badakhshan today, killing 15 people and wounding more than 30, the
official Kabul Radio said.
Badakhshan borders the Central Asian republic of Tajikistan where
Russia has deployed about 15,000 troops to help fight anti-government
Islamic guerrillas suspected of having bases in Afghanistan.--Reuter.

Salzburg, Wednesday
AN Austrian woman collected #114,000 in pension payments over 40 years
after claiming her Nazi concentration camp guard husband had died, a
court official said today.
The 71-year-old woman, named only as Marianna, was convicted of fraud
and given an 18-month suspended sentence by a Salzburg court.
She had told the authorities in 1952 that her husband, an officer in
Hitler's Waffen SS at the Theresienstadt concentration camp, had been
killed in Czechoslovakia during the war.
But the man, named as Johann, had merely changed his name. He died in
May 1994.--Reuter.

HUNDREDS of black students besieged a court in Harare yesterday where
the Scottish doctor found guilty of killing two of his patients was due
to be sentenced.
While the protesters denounced anaesthetist Dr Richard McGown as a
''racist messenger of death'' for causing two patients to die, the
judge, Paddington Garwe, delayed sentence for two weeks.
Dr McGown was found guilty on Tuesday of killing the patients through
excessive morphine doses and inadequate post-surgery care. He was
acquitted on three other counts of culpable homicide.
The students carried placards demanding a long jail term for the
58-year-old doctor, who was brought up in Scotland but now holds
Zimbabwean citizenship after emigrating to the southern African country
in 1968.
The students dispersed peacefully after McGown was whisked from the
courtroom through a rear exit.
Student leader Warlord Chakaredza said: ''He should have gone back
where he came from a long time ago. If medicine is going to injure and
wreck human life, especially black life, then it should not be practised
that way here at all.''
The case has generated immense public interest because of its racist
overtones.
The charges against McGown were first made in 1992 after a
parliamentary committee said he had killed some patients between 1986
and 1992 while testing the side-effects of spine-injected higher
morphine doses on black women and children.
The prosecution said it had no evidence the doctor was experimenting
when the five patients -- three blacks and two Zimbabweans of Greek and
Asian origin --died. But it said it could prove McGown used doses that
were larger than recommended and was generally negligent.
Attorney-General Patrick Chinamasa, leading the state case, urged the
court to imprison and fine McGown.
''His is an obsession, not a one-off case. He needs a custodial
sentence to serve as a shock therapy, to goad him into a full
realisation of his oath to save life,'' he said.
Chinamasa said McGown, who pleaded not guilty, was a skilled
anaesthetist who ''some demon has turned into a quack doctor, a
messenger of death stalking our hospitals''.
Defence laywer Chris Andersen said a jail sentence would be excessive
because his client made ''regrettable mistakes'' in pursuit of the noble
cause of relieving pain.
He said McGown, who denies being racist or experimenting on blacks,
had suffered through ''sensational reports'' which he claimed portrayed
him as Nazi-like.
Andersen deplored earlier threats by students to mutilate white
Zimbabweans if McGown was not punished to their satisfaction.
McGown, who is free on bail, faces a fine or jail sentence of up to
seven years on each count. He is expected to appeal.

From LAMINE GHANMI
Tunis, Wednesday
SUSPECTED Muslim guerrillas, in a fresh escalation of violence, shot
dead 11 people on a bus in the east Algerian town of Batna, the official
Algerian news agency APS said today.
Six passengers were also wounded in yesterday's attack at Batna, a
mountain town some 210 miles east of Algiers, said the agency, quoting a
security force statement.
The statement said the bus was carrying workers but did not say with
whom they were employed, whether they were Algerian nationals or
foreigners, or give other details.
The area is known as an Islamist fiefdom and was the scene of some of
the worst riots which erupted in the months after Algerian president
Chadli Benjedid resigned and the army-backed authorities cancelled a
general election which fundamentalists were poised to win.
Chadli resigned three years ago today.
More than 40 people were killed in and around Batna when the
authoriies arrested a mosque preacher in a clampdown on prayer leaders
stirring anti-government fervour among supporters of the now-outlawed
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).
If those killed yesterday were Algerian nationals, the attack would be
the first publicly reported mass killing on a bus not involving
foreigners, and could signal a switch of tactics in the conflict in
which Algeria acknowledges 11,000 people have been killed.
Foreign and independent sources put the toll at upto 30,000.
Two other publicly-acknowledged attacks on buses, in a country where
news on security issues is tightly controlled, occurred in May and July
last year.
But in both cases, the victims were foreigners -- seen as specific
targets in a campaign by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) to deprive
Algeria of foreign help, particularly in its oil and gas industry on
which the battered economy depends.
In the May attack, three Russian workers and 11 Algerian soldiers
guarding them, were killed when their bus was ambushed as it travelled
towards the capital from the eastern coastal town of Jijel.
Four Russians and one Romanian were killed in the July ambush, mounted
by men disguised as police manning a road check. The gunmen separated
the foreigners from their Algerian colleagues, ordered them out of the
bus and machinegunned them.
On Monday, in another apparent change of tactics, gunmen shot dead
four worshippers as they left a mosque in Barika, located in the same
mountainous Batna province.
In a separate incident, security troops yesterday shot dead six armed
militants, including a gang leader, in the southern M'sila region, a
later security statement said today.--Reuter.

A WOMAN who is virtually housebound because of a crippling skin
condition has been allowed to continue a #250,000 legal action although
it was raised too late.
Temporary judge Mr Gordon Coutts, QC, ruled yesterday that, despite an
apparent blunder by her original solicitors, Miss Susan Johnston should
be able to pursue her case against the motorist who knocked her down.
The judge was told that the delay involved in starting a fresh action
against the lawyers would make 28-year-old Miss Johnston's condition
worse and could threaten her life.
She is already in an emaciated state and too frail to attend a court
hearing.
On January 16, 1989, Miss Johnston, of Sheuchan Street, Stranraer, was
knocked from her bicycle in the town's Market Street. The car driver,
Mrs Alexandra Duff, of Hillside Crescent, Stranraer, was later convicted
of careless driving.
Three days after the accident, Miss Johnston's mother consulted
solicitors but a damages action against Mrs Duff was not raised until
May 1992, five months outside the three-year legal time limit.
Following the collision, Miss Johnston was detained in hospital
overnight for observation and had stitches inserted in a head wound.
However, she says she remained upset and disturbed over the accident,
developed post-traumatic stress disorder and began to suffer outbreaks
of the skin complaint, psoriasis.
Mr Coutts was told that stress can act as a trigger for the condition,
from which Miss Johnston had not suffered before her accident. She
alleges that her condition was caused by the stress which the accident
caused.
The solicitors now acting for Miss Johnston asked Mr Coutts, in the
interests of justice, to use his discretion to allow the case against
Mrs Duff to proceed even although it is time-barred.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, the judge said that, according
to medical reports, Miss Johnston's psoriasis was extensive, active, and
crippling.
She was said to be in a state of permanent stress and her degree of
emaciation might become life-threatening if the present rate of
deterioration in her condition continued.
She was now almost helpless and totally dependent on her parents.
Mrs Duff's insurers argued that Miss Johnston would have a good claim
against her original solicitors because of their ''manifest negligence''
in failing to raise an action within the three-year time limit.
They admitted that Mrs Duff was to blame for the accident but dispute
that the accident led to Miss Johnston's present condition.
Mr Coutts said: ''The significant feature of this action, which in my
view makes it clearly equitable that Miss Johnston should be allowed to
proceed with her action, is the potential effect upon her of what will
be the inevitable delay in pursuing any other action.
''It is a clear inference from the medical material that her condition
is deteriorating and, since it is a matter of admission that substantial
delay in the resolution of the claim will, of itself, be likely to be
detrimental to her health, I have no hesitation in concluding that she
should be allowed to proceed with her action.''

parents.
She went to Oxford University and gained a degree in English
literature. Later she worked as a researcher for Newsweek, as a reporter
for the London Weekly, The Observer, and then The Sunday Times.
Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1966 and in 1967 she married
Tynan.
Mrs Tynan is survived by a daughter and a son by her marriage to

A POLICEMAN who married a policewoman but claims he hardly saw his
wife because their shift patterns were changed, intends to bring a case
alleging discrimination against his employers.
Constable Sandy Dunnett, a former detective in Aviemore, claims he was
discriminated against when Northern Constabulary moved him on to a
different shift after he married his wife Audrey, an officer with the
same force.
It is believed his claim of discrimination on the grounds of marital
status would be the first case of its kind to be heard in Scotland.
Constable Dunnett, 42, who is now based in Portree on Skye, has lodged
an application with the Industrial Tribunals Office in Glasgow and a
date has yet to be fixed for a hearing.
It is understood that efforts are continuing in a bid to resolve the
matter before it goes to a tribunal.
The Dunnetts worked together when they were engaged but Mr Dunnett was
transferred to a different shift after they were married last August and
they hardly saw each other.
Contacted yesterday, he said: ''I would not like to say anything about
this at this stage.''
Mrs Dunnett is believed now to be pregnant and is expected to be
placed on office duties with a regular day-time shift, which will
largely coincide with her husband's working pattern.
Mr John Finnie, Northern Constabulary's full-time Scottish Police
Federation secretary, said: ''I can confirm that, following an approach
from a married male officer, papers were forwarded to the federation's
solicitors in Glasgow.
''As a result of advice received, the officer has lodged an
application to the tribunals secretary.''

A POLICE cadet who sued the Scottish Secretary for #100,000 damages

his lifelong ambition to be a police officer.
However, during an eight-week course of basic training at Tulliallan
in August 1990, he injured his knee during a sprint in the college
gymnasium.
The knee was in plaster for five weeks and he later underwent a number
of operations. He was retired from the police force after doctors said
he was medically unfit. He said he had achieved excellent results in the
police examinations and was earning #15,000 as a probationary police
officer.
Today, the judge, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, was informed that both
parties agreed to an out of court settlement, said to be
''substantial''.
Mr Kermode, of St Giles Terrace, Dundee, had told the court in
evidence that his injury forced him to give up most of his sporting
interests.
He said he had been an expert ice skater and had played ice hockey for
10 years with Dundee Rockets, who were then Scottish and British
Champions. At one time, he was assessed as 30% disabled.
He maintained that his injury was caused by the failure of the
instructors at the college to give proper instructions during the
circuit-training session on August 10, 1990.

<HEADLINE>Allison Street killer's book success offends policeman's family. Wilson must stay in jail for life, says brother of victim</HEADLINE>

THE brother of one of the police officers murdered in the Allison
Street shooting in Glasgow 25 years ago has demanded that the killer,
Howard Wilson, be kept in jail for the rest of his life.
Mr John MacKenzie, a crofter from Sutherland, has asked his MP, Mr
Robert Maclennan, to intervene on his family's behalf with the Scottish
Office to ensure that Wilson is never freed.
Mr Maclennan, president of the Liberal Democrats, told The Herald
yesterday that he agrees with the request and has urged Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang to keep Wilson in jail for the rest of his natural
life.
Mr MacKenzie is deeply unhappy at what he sees as a move among tabloid
journalists to turn Wilson, whose 25-year minimum sentence before parole
consideration is now up, into a media celebrity like Jimmy Boyle.
The trauma of the loss of Angus MacKenzie left an indelible mark on
his family and the recent publicity surrounding the publication of a
crime novel by Wilson, a prisoner at Saughton Jail, Edinburgh, has
opened old wounds, he said.
''We are in a situation where Wilson has had 25 years loss of freedom
but also 25 years of loss of all responsibility for living. He has never
had to think where next week's wages are coming from.
''He has been given unlimited opportunity to hone his writing skills
and, at the taxpayer's expense, he has invested these skills for the
future with the expectation that there will be a pot of gold awaiting
his release. I take the gravest exception to that,'' Mr MacKenzie said.
Every newspaper reference to Wilson was simply ''adding another stone
to the cairn of publicity''.
Mr MacKenzie's only brother, Angus, was one of two officers shot by
Wilson as they went to search a flat in Allison Street in the wake of a
bank robbery in which Wilson, an ex-Glasgow policeman, had taken part. A
third officer, Andrew Hyslop, was wounded by Wilson and would have been
shot had the gun not jammed.
As he was dragged away, Mr Mackenzie says, Wilson had the audacity to
ask the arresting officers to tell his brother's wife, June, that he was
sorry. She was a former police officer whom Wilson knew, he says.
The killings left two young women widowed, two small children
fatherless, and Wilson had shown by his actions he had been willing to
kill three more officers in his attempt to escape with a few thousand
pounds, Mr MacKenzie said. He also left Andrew Hyslop crippled for life
and Mr MacKenzie's own father had died a broken man.
Mr MacKenzie said yesterday: ''These events had a dramatic impact on
this family. My father was in the prison service at Perth at the time.
My mother had predeceased my brother by some years so did not have to
live through it. We knew Glasgow well because my father had spent part
of his service at Barlinnie.''
''I have come to the conclusion that the taking of human life is
something that cannot be regarded in the same light as other crimes, and
I am convinced of the death penalty's appropriateness,'' he said.
It should be reserved for cases where there was no doubt about guilt
and no chance of a miscarriage of justice and, said Mr MacKenzie, the
Howard Wilson killing was such a case.
While accepting that the legislature had voted against capital
punishment, he said that life should now mean life -- with the proviso
that a body should be constituted to review alleged miscarriages of
justice.
That, he said, would recognise that there have been cases where police
officers, possibly from an excess of zeal, had ''taken a course of
action that could not be countenanced by society''.
Mr MacKenzie alleged that Wilson's associates have already admitted in
public that they hope to make money out of his ability as an author.
This he found deeply offensive.
Mr Maclennan rejected capital punishment as an option, partly because
of the possibility of miscarriage of justice, and partly because of the
inexactitude of categorising different kinds of murders on the basis of
degrees of moral turpitude involved.
He said he had no difficulty with the concept of a life sentence
meaning life but, he said, the decision should be made by the judiciary
and not by politicians or civil servants as at present in both Scotland
and England.
''The law should provide the penalties and the judiciary should
determine what the proper penalty is.
''The question of whether in a particular case life should mean life
should never be made by a Minister, no matter how eminent. It must be
made by a judge and I have conveyed these feelings to the Scottish
Secretary.
''I have no difficulty in saying as a member of the public that I
would not like to see this man Wilson liberated,'' he said.
He has been given unlimited opportunity to hone his writing skills
and, at the taxpayer's expense, he has invested these skills for the
future

A SAILOR who tried to fiddle #193 in expenses was fined a record
#17,000 by the Royal Navy yesterday.
Petty Officer Mark Bostock, 33, who is about to leave the navy after
15 years' unblemished service, never got the false travel expenses he
tried to claim.
However, he was still fined the huge sum -- believed to be the highest
handed out -- by a court martial at HMS Nelson, Portsmouth.
After an impassioned plea by his lawyer David Lancaster, senior
officers decided not to dismiss him -- which means he will get his
redundancy package worth more than #54,000.
Bostock, from Eastney, Portsmouth, who is based at HMS Nelson, stood
to net #48.49 from each of the four false expenses claims he filed in
October last year. He was found out before any money was paid out.
He admitted four charges of forging a signature on travel claim forms
and four allegations of entering an address which did not exist as the
stated destination on them.
Mr Lancaster, in mitigation, urged the court martial to ensure that
the ''punishment fitted the crime'' and not to dismiss Bostock because
of the huge amount he stood to lose.
Mr Lancaster said Bostock had opted for redundancy so he could seek a
new career and buy a house for himself, his wife, and their two-year-old
child.
Bostock, who is waiting for redundancy paperwork to be completed
before leaving, said afterwards: ''I know the fine is large but I
expected to be dismissed from the service and that would have been a
nightmare.
''I would have lost the whole of my redundancy money, not just
#17,000. I have enjoyed my time in the Navy and did what I did in a
moment of madness.
''If it was a magistrates' court, I would only have been fined about
#150.

SIR Gavin Laird has told his fellow Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical union leaders he is to stand down next year -- leaving
Britain's largest manufacturing union without a Scottish top national
official for the first time in more than 20 years.
The union's general secretary has agreed to go once the new AEEU rule
book has been finalised to cement the amalgamation of the former
Amalgamated Engineering union and the old EETPU electricians, which he
more than anyone brought to fruition.
With the move to Brussels of AEEU president Mr Bill Jordan, who has
been appointed the first British general secretary of the 120 million
member International Confederation of Free Trades Unions, Sir Gavin
suggested that the AEEU presidency and general secretaryship both be put
out to a ballot of the full combined membership.
However, the electrical section rejected this suggestion and opted to
continue the temporary arrangement whereby the engineering members elect
the president and the electricians vote for the general secretary
pending the introduction of the new rule book.
This tactic is designed to improve Mr Paul Gallagher's chances of
being re-elected next year as he will not face a challenger from the
larger engineering section.
Once the new rules are agreed, however, there will need to be a full
election for general secretary and Sir Gavin would like to see Mrs
Maureen Rooney, the union's national women's and former Hoover,
Cambuslang machine operator, throw her bonnet into the ring.

SCOTLAND'S retail industry was in the doldrums in the run-up to
Christmas, according to the latest Scottish Chambers' business survey.
Overall, the balance of retailers reporting falling sales in the
October-December quarter was the bleakest figure in four years. The only
bright spots were Glasgow and Edinburgh, where a balance reported a
rising trend.
However, even in the two main cities, retailers were on balance less
optimistic than they had been three months before.
The gloomiest report on sales came from Aberdeen, with Dundee also
hard hit.
The data was collected in the first three weeks of December so does
not reflect any last-minute pre-Christmas activity or the post-Christmas
sales rush.
Whether reports from some big retailing groups of heavy trading since
Christmas confound expectations -- that there will be no growth in
demand in the first quarter of 1995 -- remains to be seen.
This gloomy picture marred an otherwise upbeat chambers' survey, with
confidence rising again in manufacturing, construction, tourism and,
modestly, in wholesaling.
The balance of manufacturers reporting rising export sales is the best
figure in four years.
''The retail performance is not good. The sector is considerably
depressed,'' said Professor Brain Ashcroft of the Fraser of Allander
Institute, which conducts the quarterly survey for six of the largest
Scottish chambers of commerce.
Both he and Scottish Chambers of Commerce director Andrew Moore
highlighted the upside of a recovery based on manufacturing and exports.
''This is obviously more likely to lead to a sustained recovery than
one based on consumer spending with the almost inevitable increase in
demand for goods which would be met by foreign imports with harmful
consequences to the balance of payments,'' said Mr Moore.
However, the chambers are worried about the considerable use of
part-time, temporary, and short-term contracts.
The resultant insecurity may be one factor behind the reluctance of
consumers to spend.

THE firemaster of Scotland's biggest brigade and the chairman of the
firefighters' union yesterday warned it was inevitable that Scottish
Office budget cuts would lead to slower response times and an avoidable
rise in the number of deaths caused by fire.
Mr John Jameson, Strathclyde Fire Brigade's Firemaster, predicted a
troubled future for the fire service at a conference ironically called
to announce the third annual drop in the number of people killed by fire
in the region.
In 1994, 47 people died in fires, five fewer than in the previous
year. Mr Jameson described the reduction as gratifying and applauded
Strathclyde region's shielding of his service from previous Scottish
Office funding cuts.
Mr Jameson told the conference: ''Over the last five years, we have
mounted a major campaign, together with Strathclyde Regional Council, to
bring the level of deaths down to their lowest level since World War
Two, despite the fact our workload has increased by 50% over the last 10
years.''
''All that hard work will be wasted by these cuts, and the inevitable
result will be that next year we won't be able to hold this sort of
press conference, because more people will have died.''
Strathclyde's most senior firefighter decided to speak out to protest
at the proposed 5% reduction in the revenue allocated to the brigade
through Strathclyde region's general services budget.
Strathclyde region officials estimate the across-the-board cut,
designed to save #107m, will be necessary to remain within the Scottish
Office's spending limits for 1995.
Mr Jameson bitterly complained that this reduction would exacerbate
the effects of a five-year programme, previously revealed in The Herald,
of cuts in the brigade's capital allocations programme, currently in its
second year.
This programme meant the brigade has already lost #900,000 --
equivalent to 26% -- of funds available to pay for building and
refurbishing brigade facilities.
The results of these cuts, claimed Mr Jameson, was that the brigade
was having to use ageing equipment fast approaching obsolescence.
He did not rule out the possibility of job losses from the brigade's
staff of 3000 full and part-time firefighters.
Mr John McDonald, Strathclyde chairman of the Fire Brigades Union,
yesterday wrote to regional councillors warning that the union feared
job losses and the closure of stations in Lanark, Ayr, Greenock, Stepps,
and Troon as a result of any budget cut.
Of the 45 people killed in house fires, 21 had no smoke detectors and
a further nine had either taken the battery out of their alarm or had
failed to notice it was broken.

PRIMARY school children are being lured into alcohol abuse by a new
range of designer drinks with attractive fruit flavours and a high
alcohol content, a BBC TV documentary alleges tonight.
The drinks, with names like TNT, Flavours for Ravers, and Test Tubes,
are spreading from off-sales to supermarkets, the producer of Frontline
Scotland said yesterday.
Mr Murdoch Rodgers said those selling the drinks ''would no doubt
argue they are supplying an over-18 market of young people but they are
being drunk in swing parks as well as wine bars''.
He said youngsters would get their big brothers or someone big enough
to pass for over 18 to buy them.
The programme, Blitzed, features children as young as nine discussing
the merits of drinks with alcohol contents of up to 21% by volume. The
speed at which they achieve a ''buzz'' comes across as a major
attraction.
Mr Jim Smith, an outreach worker with the Greater Easterhouse Alcohol
Abuse Project, said: ''These drinks are obviously targeted at young
people. They are at a nice easy price, particularly for some of the kids
I know who make money from their paper round; they are easily
accessible; and they are colourful.
''That's what kids are attracted to and they are sweet -- they don't
have the rough edge of the traditional fortified wines.''
One of the strongest -- Cisco Black Cherry, described as a fortified
citrus and grape wine -- has an alcohol content of 21% and sells at #2
for a 375ml bottle.
TNT Dynamite, in a can with a ring-pull top, is cider at 8.4%, costing
#1 to #1.50, and MD 20/20, known popularly as Mad Dog, comes in a range
of fruit flavours, and is 13.1%.
Test Tube Cocktails, also in a range of fruit flavours, are 15% in a
50ml tube.
Mr Peter Bowlt, whose Tubular Drinks Company makes them in Gateshead,
claims in the programme to have turned over #3m last year. ''This is
what young people are crying out for, these sort of products, so you
have to make them available.''
The Scottish Health Minister, Lord Fraser, tells the programme he has
no evidence to indicate an increase in under-age drinking recently but
Mr Rodgers said: ''The last research was done in 1990, before these
drinks started to saturate the market.''

IT may never be known who was responsible for the electrical fault
which resulted in the deaths of a nurse and her three dogs, according to
a sheriff's findings yesterday.
Ms Janice Clelland, 35, died a year ago yesterday as she walked along
a busy street in Partick, Glasgow, with her dogs on a metal leash.
The dogs brushed against a scaffolding pole which was live and Ms
Clelland, of Thornwood Avenue, Partick, and her pets were electrocuted
and lay dying outside a shop in Dumbarton Road.
A cable running from a control box in a close at Exeter Drive to a
ledge above the roof of the shop had never been earthed. It had been out
of use for 12 years, had never been inspected, was live, and should have
been stripped out.
During the fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court in
November, Sheriff Gerald Gordon, QC, was told how two people had brushes
with death before the tragedy.
Almost a year earlier, a window cleaner received a shock from a firt
floor living room window in Exeter Drive.
The incident was reported and Glasgow District Council sent an
electrician to the scene to investigate but there are no records to show
what action he took to rectify the problem.
The night before Ms Clelland died, another young woman had a narrow
escape when her dog collided with the scaffolding and let out a scream.
Yesterday, in his written determination, the sheriff said Ms
Clelland's death could have been avoided if: ''The cable had been
properly earthed in the first place, and removed or disconnected when it
was no longer used.''
Criticising its system, the sheriff said that if the responsible
authority had kept proper records, the problem might have been revealed.

EXCLUSIVE
THE DIRECTOR of ScotRail has warned it will be run down if Government
demands for budget cuts are to be met.
Mr Chris Green also predicted ScotRail's fate leading up to
privatisation will be to provide the cheapest railway possible, rather
than the best.
He warned of dearer fares and staff cuts.
His bleak assessment stands in stark contrast to earlier forecasts
that the network's future was one of expansion and quality services.
Mr Green said it was inevitable he would be ''running ScotRail down''
if asked to continue this year's level of cuts.
He has been told to reduce annual train operating costs by at least 5%
from April, with similar savings expected in following years because
Government subsidy is being slashed.
A rearguard action is now under way to change Minister's minds over
the cost-cutting targets, especially with full privatisation due in
November.
It is clear ScotRail's management team believes U-turns are possible
because of a growing recognition that options to meet the targets would
be political suicide for the Tories.
In an exclusive interview, Mr Green said he is expected to get through
1995 with ''a near impossible budget target''.
He said the Government would get ''the cheapest railway, not the
best'' if the financial crisis were not relieved -- and if ScotRail has
to run services ''at minimum cost and without investment''.
Mr Green confirmed he would argue, in negotiations right up to March
31, that budget cuts of #3m -- let alone the #6m-#10m figures being
bandied about -- will mean fewer services, staff cuts, and that
passengers will suffer.
However, his message to the Government on behalf of ScotRail, the
preferred bidder for the train operating franchise, goes much further.
It is that there is no escaping the harsh reality that ''a better
railway can be achieved only by higher levels of subsidy''.
He said: ''We have to make more savage cuts than anticipated. We are
willing and able to fund productivity, but not in a position to do so.
That cannot possibly sit with the policy of developing and expanding the
railway.
''So you end up with the nation having to choose what it can in terms
of subsidy -- or an expanding railway which gets cars and lorries off
the roads and brings more tourists to Scotland.
Last night, Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish praised Mr Green
for his ''courage and conviction'' in speaking out to save Scotland's
railways.
Mr Green had stressed it was unlikely there would be line closures,
but declared ScotRail, to meet targets, will have to:
* Increase fares, especially on tourist routes at peak holiday
periods;
* Run fewer trains, which will be more crowded -- and older, because
of a freeze on investment in new rolling stock;
* Cut staff, reputedly by up to 600, some 15% of the workforce.
The director also confirmed sleeper services will be much smaller
after transfer from InterCity West Coast to ScotRail because the Office
of Passenger Rail Franchising has said Government subsidy would be given
to run only two trains each way nightly.
The number of coaches available will drop from 16 to eight because the
two trains will have to be divided to serve four destinations within
Scotland -- Aberdeen-Glasgow, and Inverness-Edinburgh.
Even ''sit-in'' facilities are likely to be abandoned. In effect, the
opportunity to travel south overnight will be available only to people
who book cabins because the trains will no longer haul seat-only
coaches.
Mr Green warned of even more ''radical measures'' to achieve savings
if subsidy cuts are not lifted in future years.
He fears tourism revenue in particular will fall because of reduced
services, in turn damaging the Scottish economy, and declared: ''If we
were to continue the level of cuts we are being asked to make in 1995,
it would be fair to say that ScotRail is being run down.''
Mr McLeish said the interview with Mr Green ''provided a frank
assessment of the nightmare of privatisation and how it could destroy
Scotland's rail network''.
He added: ''Chris Green, who has an excellent track record, is to be
congratulated for his courage and conviction in wanting to win through
for passengers.
''I hope Ministers will listen. They have no idea what is happening to
our railways. ScotRail's director is saying what the way forward should
be.''

THREE former drugs squad officers will appear in court in Aberdeen
today after an internal corruption inquiry carried out by Grampian
Police.
Sergeant Hamish Moir, 35, Constable Neil Cooper, 35, and Constable
James Grimmer, 34, are in custody and will appear on charges in
connection with alleged corruption and attempting to defeat the ends of
justice.
Some of the charges date back three years and some relate to drugs.
The officers, along with a fourth who was released after interview,
were detained at their homes early yesterday by officers from
Strathclyde Police. They had carried out a three-week investigation
after being called in by Grampian's deputy chief constable, Mr David
Garbutt.
This followed an investigation over several months by Grampian
officers.
Mr Garbutt said yesterday he doubted if any other officers would face
charges but could not rule that out completely.
He said the inquiry might have implications for other criminal
proceedings which had yet to come to court.
The three officers had been serving in the Aberdeen area. They were
suspended from duty yesterday.
Investigations into the activities of the officers were instigated by
Grampian CID. ''In light of the information they supplied to me, I
requested that it be inquired into independently by police officers from
outwith Grampian,'' Mr Garbutt said. He said it was entirely wrong to
suggest the inquiry had been initiated by the Scottish Crime Squad. It
had been initiated entirely as a result of internal matters.
He went on: ''As a number of other officers may be involved as
witnesses in any subsequent court or disciplinary hearing, it would be
inappropriate for them to comment publicly until after any such
proceedings are concluded.''
Before Christmas, he asked Strathclyde's chief constable, Mr Leslie
Sharp, to second investigating officers to Grampian, and, led by
Detective Superintendent Phil McDonald, they had carried out the inquiry
on Mr Garbutt's behalf. Their initial findings were reported to the
procurator-fiscal in Aberdeen.
''This independent inquiry has not yet been completed and as criminal
proceedings have now been initiated, Grampian Police are unable to
comment further.''
Mr Garbutt said that he deeply regretted the fact that some Grampian
Police officers now faced judicial proceedings.
However, he added: ''The force command is confident that the people of
Grampian are served by dedicated and efficient police officers who
strive to maintain the highest standards of public service.
''We are determined that these high standards are maintained at all
levels and that any circumstance where performance falls below that
which is expected will be investigated thoroughly and dealt with
appropriately.''
Complaints and matters of discipline were his initial responsibility
under the Police (Discipline)(Scotland) Regulations 1967. It was his
responsibility to appoint an investigating officer, senior to the
officers involved, who would, after an inquiry, report to him his
observations, findings, and recommendations.
''If the complaint is particularly serious or involves a number of
officers, I have the option to choose to appoint an investigating
officer from an outside force to ensure that the investigation is
carried out in a clearly independent manner.''
* In a separate investigation in Stornoway, an officer has been
suspended from duty by Northern Constabulary. Sergeant Maureen Smith has
been stationed at the Western Isles divisional headquarters for the past
two years. It is understood that she was suspended for an alleged
failure to process a drink-driving offence. There is no indication of
when the disciplinary hearing will be held.
Mr Finlay Maclennan, the force's deputy chief constable, said in
Inverness: ''It is not force policy to comment on matters affecting
disciplinary issues arising withing the force.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair told his Shadow Cabinet last night that they
must be extra careful in everything they say, in the run-up to the next
General Election.
A series of blunders have irritated Mr Blair and last night he took
the unusual step of leaking what he had said to his Shadow Cabinet
concerning policy discipline.
''We must all now act with extra care because we are no longer being
regarded as opposition but as a government in waiting. The Tories will
try every means to expose divisions within the party. We must all
observe certain rules.''
No Labour front-bench spokesman can go public on any policy issue
without checking first with Mr Blair or Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown.
Mr Blair read the riot act to his Shadow Cabinet and Euro-MPs
yesterday. In a letter to today's Guardian, 36 mep's express their
support for the clause 4 review.

A BOY of ten has died after a cut leg led to the so-called
flesh-eating disease, necrotising fasciitis.
He died in Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children on Sunday, three
days after an operation to remove the affected tissue from his leg.
His death was announced a few hours after it was disclosed that the
sister of former Beirut hostage, Mr Tom Sutherland, had fallen victim to
the disease.
Miss Elizabeth Sutherland, 72, was said to be serious but stable
yesterday after an operation at Falkirk Royal Infirmary early on Monday
morning.
The boy, who lived in the Glasgow area and had Down's Syndrome, was
admitted to Yorkhill last Wednesday with bacterial infection to a leg
wound. A hospital spokesman said blood tests were taken, and the nature
of the illness was recognised overnight.
He was taken into theatre the following day and underwent three hours
of surgery to remove the affected tissue to try to combat the bacterium.
''An orthopaedic surgeon and a plastic surgeon took part in the
operation,'' said the spokesman. ''Everything that could reasonably be
done was done; he was returned to the intensive care unit but he
remained critically ill and died on Sunday.''
Miss Sutherland was admitted to hospital on Sunday night after another
brother, Peter, found her ill at home near Falkirk with a throat
infection.
Medical staff noticed the swelling and skin discoloration associated
with necrotising fasciitis, a gangrene-like condition which received
widespread publicity last year after a cluster of cases in England.
An area of skin and flesh extending from her lower jaw to her chest
was removed in surgery.
The hospital medical director, Mr Douglas Harper, said she was still
''serious'' from the effects of the infection on her system, and was
being supported by antibiotics. Her throat functions have escaped
damage. However, when she is stronger, she will require skin grafting.
Miss Sutherland's niece, Mrs Marjorie Lally, a 38-year-old chemistry
teacher, said: ''My aunt can't speak but sometimes she responds to
voices. She is very seriously ill but she is a very fit lady ''
Mr Tom Sutherland, a retired academic living in Denver, Colorado, has
been told about his sister's illness and is standing by to fly to
Scotland when she comes out of sedation.
His sister was among the family members who celebrated with Mr
Sutherland, a former Rangers player, when he returned to Scotland two
years ago after being released from six years in captivity in Beirut
with Terry Waite, Brian Keenan and John McCarthy.
Miss Sutherland is the second case of necrotising fasciitis at Falkirk
Royal in the past four months. A young mother contracted it after giving
birth by Caesarian operation, and is still in hospital but ''continuing
to make good progress''. Mr Harper, who operated to excise the affected
tissue on that occasion, said the two cases were unconnected.
