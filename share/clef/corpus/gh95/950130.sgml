I SPOKE to Allan Hosie after the last International Board meeting, and
he said then that one of the biggest debating issues had been
professionalism.
He recognised then that there would be change. Yesterday's news
confirms that.
Freddie McLeod, it may not be public knowledge, had to do a report to
the IB investigating the ways of money in the game in Britain, Canada,
and America, and found that all nine laws regarding amateurism were
being broken. He realises that there will have to be change.
The SRU's problem in all of this is the clubs, who have informed the
SRU that they are to vote for the maintenance of amateurism. Status quo.
And yet there will be change.
I, for my sins, am absolutely convinced that amateurism has to end,
and that should not be restricted to international players.
All of the major sports in the world, whether they be soccer, golf,
tennis, or even waterskiing, have the vast majority of their
participatants doing it for the love of the game and no more.
There are hundreds of pub football teams, my local tennis club takes
part in competition just for the joy of it, and you can spot many a
youngster howking the odd golf ball around Knightswood golf course on
most days of the year.
But that does not stop Ally McCoist, Boris Becker, and Greg Norman
from taking home a fair old pay packet. Top players deserve it.
Let's look at rugby. Rugby, as a credible game, suffers because people
still look upon it as a one-class sport, played by people of a
privileged background who can afford to take time off to train and play
it at the highest level. Just look at Murrayfield yesterday. All of
Scotland's best rugby players were there, in their own time, preparing
for the game against Ireland next Saturday.
Only in an amateur game would that be possible. And, by consequence,
the game is a no-go area for those that see family life, career, and
money as important. And we all see those as important.
Take a youngster living in one of Glasgow's housing schemes. What he
sees on telly is the likes of McCoist earning a packet playing the
''people's game'' and so he is prepared to stick in at his football, not
just because of the fact that he likes it, but because if he progresses
in the game then he will also benefit financially.
My views on soccer are private. All right, I think it's a real
woofter's game and a shame on many of its participants, but it has
always, as a sport, acknowledged that those good enough to draw the
crowds are also good enough to earn a penny or two because of it. And
they can spend those pennies on, for example, new hair styles if they
are footballers.
Rugby, to its eternal shame also, has never really believed that
players deserved to be paid.
I think that the most radical outcome of rugby becoming professional,
and we will all be surprised at the leading role that we in Scotland
could play, is that it will provide the catalyst for the game to become
multi-class in Britain. It is working class in France and Wales,
becoming that way in England, but up here the majority are not working
class, and that has depressed me more than anything over the years.
The dangers are there for all to see. Money brings certain hazards.
Money encourages cheating. Time and time again in football we see pros
getting their fellow pros into trouble by feigning dives in the penalty
box, toppling over tackles, and falling to the ground writhing with pain
after perfectly innocuous collisions.
Money, and the dreaded win bonus, soon persuades you that winning is
everything, and rugby, with its many situations where real physical
confrontation is allowed and encouraged, offers incredible scope for
physical violence. ''Get their best player off the pitch'' is a cry we
would all fear, no doubt.
As Hosie said to me on the phone yesterday, and he's a former
international referee as well: ''I doubt whether the game could go pro
with the current rucking laws!''
And then there are the clubs. ''We could never afford it!'' they will
cry. Well, if rugby ups its profile, changes its ways, and generates the
spectators it deserves by becoming multi-class, then they will.
But I have one nagging doubt, and that is whether the game's laws can
stay the same, with so many stoppages and time-wasting at lineouts and
kicks to touch.
I believe rugby is far more entertaining than the woofter's game, but
not everyone does. Professionalism might just change their addled minds.

Edinburgh Academicals 30,
Stewart's Melville FP 0
THE faces of the faithful few who travelled from Inverleith were as
long as Corstorphine Road after this miserable performance.
They had witnessed the worst 80 minutes of rugby from a Stewart's
Melville side for many a season, and post-match comments ranged from
''dreadful'' to ''they have started practising for the second division
already.''
Yet let us not be negative altogether, because for all Colleges were
poor, a great deal of their discomfort was down to another good,
all-round performance from Edinburgh Academicals.
It seems that the power of positive thinking, advocated by president
Charlie Jackson, has reached every member of this team, and they believe
their place is in the top flight.
Colleges, on the other hand, were, by all accounts, fired up for this
but failed even to get the basics right and now must take the drop. With
young talent aplenty, though, and direction from such as Finlay Calder
and Douglas Wyllie, they will be back.
Accies, too, are building an impressive reservoir of young talent but
have the team to do the business while the next lot are nurtured. Luxury
indeed, and testament to the reputation of a club that they are willing
to wait their turn.
The visitors exerted so much early pressure that it was only a matter
of time before the points came. After a series of scrums near the line,
the ball was spun out to Brian Hay-Smith, who crossed for a try.
Hay-Smith, not in the best of form with the boot, managed two penalty
goals following a Simon Burns drop goal for a comfortable 14-0 half-time
lead.
Frustration boiled over into scrapping a few times in the second half,
and while never condoning foul play, it is hard not to sympathise with
players seeing opponents on their side preventing release and not being
penalised. The guilty men know who they are.
Hay-Smith added a further brace of penalty goals before the Accies
machine, having braved a fine Colleges fightback, grabbed two late tries
from Paddy Haslett and Dave McIvor.
As expected, the Accies caps, Jeremy Richardson and McIvor, shone in
all departments, but add to them all six other forwards for plaudits and
do not forget newcomer Craig Murray, fitting well into an established
back line.
Cold comfort for Colleges, perhaps, but Peter Flockhart is growing in
stature and the pace of Nick Penny and Danny Bull is impressive. Just
the small matter of getting the ball to them.
Edinburgh Academicals -- S A D Burns; J F Swanson, C T Simmers, C
Murray, C H Newton; B Hay-Smith, P M S Simpson; R A Moffit, W P Haslett,
B D Stewart, A R Adamson, J F Richardson, D J McIvor, M Waite, R Hoole.
Stewart's Melville FP -- P W B Flockhart; N Penny, C N Gallagher, F
Pollock, D J Bull; P Hodgson, G G Burns; R B McNulty, A Cadzow, A J
Kittle, W Faulds, B Gordon, M Paton, A Reeves, D G Clark.

CANADIAN-BORN Mary Pierce overcame world No.1 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
in straight sets at the Australian Open to secure her firstGrand Slam
title.
The 20-year-old won 6-3, 6-2 to deprive the Spaniard of the top
ranking.
The fourth-seeded Pierce, who had not dropped a set on her way to the
final, battled her way through a scrappy first set to beat
Sanchez-Vicario with a stunning display of power tennis.
The aggressive Pierce broke Sanchez Vicario to lead 3-2 with a searing
cross-court forehand, and then produced a string of eight successive
points to go into an unassailable 5-2 lead.
She won the match and a pay cheque of #232,000, on her own serve with
an equally authoritative backhand.

ANDRE Agassi's Australian Open triumph may not have had the shock
impact of his 1992 Wimbledon success -- or the showbiz glamour of his US
Open victory last September but many, including beaten World No 1 Pete
Sampras, believe it may prove more significant in the long-term.
Agassi's appearances have always attracted attention, but he has never
yet shown the consistency which separates great champions from merely
good ones.
But now the 24-year-old Las Vegas man is holder of two of the world's
four major championships -- and has the chance at the French Open in May
of becoming only the second modern-day player, after Rod Laver, to win
each of the quartet.
This time last year Sampras, 16 months younger, had the tennis world
at his feet, but has now been joined by his fellow American, offering
the men's game the prospect of its most exciting rivalry since Borg and
McEnroe.
Sampras said: ''I think it must lift the game because tennis has been
missing rivalry for the last few years,'' after relinquishing his
Australian title.
''Mine and Andre's games are different, and we are very different
people -- Andre puts tennis at the forefront of the sports pages and I
think tennis needs that.
''Andre is moving a lot better now -- he's got great ground strokes
and is serving better. If he stays fit he's a threat for every major
title of the year.''
Such praise from a man who knows what it takes to reach the top and
stay there summed up the sporting nature of their contest and reinforced
the view that Agassi's game has developed hugely since Brad Gilbert
became his coach last March.
''Ironically, the major tournament I have not won yet is the one I
should have won first,'' said Agassi.
''Winning the French Open would be very important to me. I want it as
bad as any title.''
Sampras has never won in Paris either but Agassi's baseline game is
significantly better suited to clay. For the moment he is perfectly
content to bide his time.
''Pete did not look the best player in the world today, but the
reality is he's clearly ahead of everybody,'' claimed Agassi. ''Just
because you win one match does not mean you are the No 1 player in the
world.''
Agassi, playing in Melbourne for the first time, recovered from a set
down to beat Sampras 4-6, 6-1, 7-6, 6-4 and confessed that as soon as he
clinched victory with an ace, his thoughts turned to his opponent.
Sampras has been under considerable strain during the tournament since
his coach Tim Gullikson was flown home after a health scare.

BOROUGHMUIR winger Derek Stark has every right to be pleased with his
sparkling performance against Watsonians in the Myreside glaur, writes
Derek Douglas. With two tries, and a bit more besides, his confidence is
on a high as he sets about putting his name back in the selectorial
frame with an appearance for Scotland A against the Irish on Friday.
Stark, who was capped four times in 1993 but has been the invisible
man on the international scene since, said: ''Yes, it went well. I was
disappointed not to figure when the South Africans were here, and maybe
now I can prove to the guys who doubt me that I still have a bit to
offer. Maybe it will make them sit up and take notice.
''I've been criticised for coming in and out of games but I feel now
I'm getting more involved, and Boroughmuir are good for me in that they
always aim to get me involved early on,'' he said.
'Muir coach Henry Edwards also was singing the praises of his pacy
winger.
''Stark played well. He's scoring a lot of good tries. He scored five
against GHK last weekend and it wasn't just a question of getting the
ball in space and running them in, he had a bit of work to do.''
Edwards maintained that Saturday's win -- which puts Boroughmuir in
second place behind Stirling County -- now gives the Meggetland side a
real target to aim at.
''We've just got to keep playing away. The important thing today was
to win. That gives us a purpose for the rest of the season,'' he said.
Watsonians' coach Peter Gallagher was philosophical in defeat. ''You
can't win if you get virtually no lineout ball and today any 50-50 ball
was always in Boroughmuir's favour.''
He confirmed that Watsonians had been keen to have the game postponed
but said that the doubt had not been a factor in his side's defeat.
''I don't want to make excuses. We certainly didn't expect to play
and, therefore, if you like, we had de-psyched ourselves in a sense
before the kick-off. But once we knew the game was on, players of that
calibre have the ability to get back on the rails again.
''Boroughmuir were hungrier than we were and it showed in their
play,'' he said.

THIS weekend's district qualifying tournaments for the Macallan
Scottish Curling Championships threw up surprises, including the
elimination of defending champion Colin Hamilton of Livingston at
Glasgow's Summit Centre, beaten 3-8 by Hamilton's John Muir, and the
1991 world champion rink of David Smith (Perth), writes Mike Haggerty.
Hammy McMillan's Stranraer team lost twice at Perth -- 5-6 to Robin
Gray of Forest Hills and 2-7 to John Joe Kenny of Kinross -- and now
depend on next weekend's repechage, also at Perth, to qualify. Both
teams that beat McMillan now qualify for the finals.
The Aberdeen qualifiers were Callum Weir of Aviemore and Drew Tasker
of Letham Grange, while at Ayr Keith Prentice from Lockerbie and Philip
Wilson of Greenacres quailified. The line-up also includes Warwick Smith
of Perth and Graeme Adam of East Kilbride.
In the ladies championships, both Kirsty Hay's and Jackie Lockhart's
team qualified from Forfar, while the Hamilton qualifiers were the teams
of Marion Miller, Claire Milne, Margaret Morton and Rhona Martin.

JAMES TRAYNOR argues that rugby authorities have it easy in Scotland
compared to football
THE rugby mob, lawyers, accountants, bankers, teachers, all that sort,
will be milling around in Edinburgh's streets again on Saturday when
Scotland enter another Five Nations' campaign with little genuine hope
of winning more often than they lose. The supporters, peculiar people
themselves in that most of them lie low during the season emerging only
a few times to sing Flower of Scotland at Murrayfield, will have a good
day out.
Certainly, Scotland's fans have to go armed with a healthy sense of
humour these days otherwise there would be a lot of crying into a lot of
beer glasses. Yet, if they had been a bit more put out by defeat perhaps
Scottish rugby would not be in such a miserable state.
Even viewed from a distance it isn't difficult to see the problem. The
Scottish game has been allowed to drag its heels while other countries
made solid progress.
As a consequence, Scotland's international rugby stock is not at all
high, and neither is the credibility of those who control the sport.
Hmm, does this not sound familiar? Seems to me there is a strong, but
worrying parallel to be drawn between football and rugby, two sports in
which we used to be quite handy.
Just what is going on in this country when it is apparently impossible
to produce a side in either code to bring a sense of pride and inflate
the nation's self-esteem? Fans can't feel confident about supporting
either the rugby or football teams, but so far as the latter is
concerned the decline has been and is being debated furiously. The same
can't be said for rugby where the old boys appear untouchable.
How Jim Farry, the SFA's chief executive, and his fellows would love
to be in a similar position to the SRU, who are rarely criticised, but
when they are the words are muted. It is doubtful if the gentlemen at
rugby HQ even hear them.
The SFA do not enjoy that misguided respect. They are forever
defending themselves, and sometimes even acting upon demand. Indeed, the
SFA and Scottish League have been vilified often and many clubs,
players, and managers also have been criticised heavily. Yet rugby's
hierarchy is given an easy ride.
Rarely are the SRU taken to task. They enjoy some kind of exalted
status and pity the man who dares speak out against any of the chaps.
It is as though a criticism of say, secretary Bill Hogg, would be like
blasphemy. Call me irresponsible, but hey, I'm in the mood to blaspheme.
Baffled I was the other week to read Dougie Morgan, the Scotland
coach, say he can handle the criticism, but that it isn't so easy for
the families. Excuse me? What criticism?
Morgan, team manager Duncan Paterson, and captain Gavin Hastings were
allowed to proceed through nine games without a win -- until they
finally secured a victory by beating the mighty Canucks last week -- and
hardly a bad word was uttered in their direction. Oh all right, there
might have been a few questions asked, but my God, if they think they
have been taken to task they are not living in the real world.
Could you imagine if any of these sensitive souls had been brought up
in the other football faith? Long ago they would have sought refuge in
the cupboard under the stairs.
Just ask yourselves one question and answer truthfully. Do you believe
Craig Brown would have held on to his job as manager of the Scottish
national football team if he had presided over nine matches without a
win?
He would have had to flee the country and he would have most of his
players with him for company on some remote island somewhere. His
employers, the SFA, would not have been given an alternative because the
fans would have found such a run of failure totally unacceptable.
Yet, the Scottish rugby team's wretched record caused some mutterings
and a barely detectable ripple of discontent, but surely someone has to
be accountable. The men responsible should have been shown the door
because that's the way it works in the sporting world.
However, rugby's administration and management were allowed to
continue relatively unaccosted despite their failure. Paterson and
Morgan have indicated they will stand down after the World Cup in South
Africa, but that is a luxury of choice they are extremely fortunate to
have.
Rugby continues to have a problem with its image in that there is
still a snobbery attached because it is a sport played largely by the
middle class, but it belongs to everyone who wishes to pay to watch a
match and these customers ought to been demanding better.
Frankly, the SRU don't deserve to be held in such high esteem because
the current state of Scottish rugby suggests someone somewhere is
getting it all wrong. Why then is no-one saying so?
Makes you wonder, it really does. Perhaps rugby's supporters have
exactly the set-up they deserve.
The silence and lack of outrage might suggest rugby's fans and the
sport's media seem happy enough with their lot. Their failure to call
the SRU, whose only triumph would seem to be Murrayfield itself, to
account is almost as depressing as the standard of play.
An appalling, almost sickening deference is shown to the SRU, and look
where it has got us all. It has to stop, and maybe then we'll start
winning.

THE Irish selectors have responded to the 20-8 defeat by England by
drafting in six fresh faces and making one positional change for the
side to face Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday, writes Derek Douglas.
Meanwhile, the Scottish squad to meet Ireland trained at Murrayfield
yesterday, when skipper Gavin Hastings, who is due to win a Scottish
record fifty-third cap, withdrew after the warm-up when he felt his back
stiffen up.
However, the team management said that Hastings' decision not to
complete the session had been taken as a precautionary measure and there
were no doubts over his fitness for Saturday.
The only new cap in the Irish team is 26-year-old Ben Cronin, the
Garryowen No.8. He was selected to play against the USA last November,
but forced to call off because of a fractured cheekbone.
The three changes in the back line bring the return of Jim Staples at
full back in place of Conor O'Shea, Jonathan Bell replacing Niall Woods
on the left wing, and captain Michael Bradley, back at scrum half
following a family bereavement, instead of Niall Hogan.
In the pack, Paddy Johns switches from No.8 to the second row, Mick
Galwey drops down to the replacements panel, and Gabriel Fulcher, who
replaced the injured Neil Francis against England, has been retained in
the second row.
Ireland -- J Staples (Harlequins); S Geoghegan (Bath), B Mullin
(Blackrock College), P Danaher (Garryowen), J Bell (Ballymena); P Burke,
M Bradley, captain (both Cork Constitution); N Popplewell (Wasps), K
Woods (Garryowen), P Clohessy (Young Munster), P Johns (Dungannon), G
Fulcher (Cork Constitution), A Foley (Shannon), D McBride (Malone), B
Cronin (Garryowen).
* BRISTOL loose-head prop Alan Sharp has withdrawn from the Scotland A
side to meet Ireland A at Myreside on Friday, Dundee HS FP's John Manson
returning in his place. Sharp has apparently suffered a recurrence of
the back problem which sidelined him for the Scotland game against
Canada and he was unable to take part in Bristol's game against
Leicester on Saturday.

Watsonians 9,
Boroughmuir 26
BOROUGHMUIR had won the mind games, even before a ball had been played
in earnest and -- courtesy of a streetwise performance by their pack and
a sparkling display by the backs -- marshalled by Sean Lineen, allied to
the lightning pace of Derek Stark, there was only ever going to be one
winner.
The Myreside turf had suffered badly fromthe snow and frost which
enveloped Edinburgh overnight on Friday. The call went out for an army
of helpers armed with garden forks.
By late Saturday morning, the game had still no more than a 50-50
chance of going ahead. Watsonians were in favour of a postponement.
Boroughmuir were keen to let play commence, and after consultation with
the captains, referee David Leslie gave the green light. Round one to
Boroughmuir.
From then on, the visitors held the upper hand. The gluepot surface
was not the perfect setting for Boroughmuir's Derek Stark to remind
those who have to be reminded that he remains one of the most potent
finishers in the Scottish game.
His all-round performance on Saturday -- with two tries to add to the
25 scored this season already, some skilful defensive work, and neat
little touches here and there -- will, perhaps, have impressed the
spectating national coach Dougie Morgan.
Boroughmuir cleaned up on the touchline, where Darren Burns and Paul
Jennings were assisted by a more worldly-wise 'Muir pack to lavish
helpings of lineout ball. But their dominance was not confined to the
forwards. Sean Lineen once again exhibited that brand of rugby vision
which quite simply cannot be coached.
He was at the heart of the visitors' threequarter play and did his
erstwhile Scotland partner Scott Hastings no favours in comparison as
the younger Hastings strives to resuscitate his international career.
'Muir signalled their intentions loud and clear right from the
kick-off. Their forwards drove Watsonians back 20 metres after the very
first engagement, but the home side drew first blood with a Gavin
Hastings penalty after Easson had been wayward with a couple of penalty
shots of his own.
However, Easson equalised with a penalty after 11 minutes, and the
opening try came just two minutes later.
A real gem it was. Lineen and Mardon carved out the opening before
Stark threw out a huge looping ball to Tukalo. Scotland's 1990 Grand
Slam winger focused on the corner flag and the covering Hastings Sr had
no chance of preventing the touchdown.
Easson dropped a goal shortly thereafter. Hastings kept his side in
the hunt with his second penalty goal but, despite sustained Watsonians'
pressure, Boroughmuir forged further ahead through Stark's first try of
the afternoon.
Again Lineen saw the gap and Stark was put in the clear with 60 metres
to run for the line. It was no contest, hard though Scott Hastings tried
to nail him.
With little more than half an hour gone, Boroughmuir lost Tukalo after
a freak incident involving Hastings the younger. Scott had chanced a
''sneak'' 22 drop-out, but the ball flew straight to the waiting Tukalo.
He was held in an all-embracing tackle by the Watsonians centre,
sustaining a badly-gashed right hand in the process.
Half-time was reached with Boroughmuir in control and enjoying a 16-6
lead. Easson kicked a penalty goal to increase the advantage but, when
the referee harshly adjudged Stark to have been offside as he went for
an interception, Hastings goaled his third penalty award from three
attempts.
Easson, his Boroughmuir goal-kicking counterpart, had a much less
successful strike-rate, and pushed yet another penalty attempt wide. The
visitors suffered a further blow when Mike Hall was stretchered off with
a neck injury in 68 minutes.
Lineen and Stark combined for a fine finale, the centre's inside pass
to Stark allowing the winger to stride in for an excellent try which
Easson converted.
Watsonians -- A G Hastings; G Jessop, S Hastings, A R Garry, J A Kerr;
D W Hodge, E J W Weston; M Stanaway, D S Henderson, R MacLeod, D Gray, M
B Rudkin, C Mather, J G Mathieson, J D MacDonald. Replacement -- D

THE Sisters Rosenweig live! Just when Wendy Wasserstein's New York
Jewish comedy was about to slip its moorings from the Old Vic, up pops
another, slightly weightier, but no less wisecracking version in Carole
Braverman's Yiddish Trojan Women.
Only vaguely related to Euripides's original, Braverman's story is a
moving attempt to redeem lives overshadowed by traumas of long ago,
resonating into the present. To that extent, Braverman's Polish emigre
grandmother, Devorah, and her three grand-daughters, Brenda, Tess and
Abby, are filtered versions of Hecuba, Andromache, and Cassandra though
with twice the humour if not quite as much agony.
Maria Charles's spirited Devorah (now on to her fifth husband) is an
eccentric foil to Debora Weston's wonderful portrayal of Brenda -- the
loud, brassy cabaret singer. By comparison, Suzan Sylvester's
good-natured Tess is a contemporary young woman painfully searching for
a middle way between the unbridled self-interest of Brenda and the
Cassandra-like Abby, the political activist of the family.
Braverman's heady picture of these desperate generations of New York
Jewish women struggling to control their lives juggles issues of sex,
memory, exile, and morality with ambitious chutzpah, if not entirely
successfully.
Hettie Macdonald's atmospheric yet unenergised production allows the
play to ramble into sentimental reminiscing and a cop-out ending.

SCOTLAND lock Andy Reed insists that the back injury which cost him a
place in the side which defeated Canada, and which ended the run of nine
games without a win, is not threatening to bring a premature halt to his
rugby career.
Reed, who won the most recent of his 10 caps in the 34-10 defeat by
South Africa last November, was sidelined after having led the Scottish
Exiles to district championship success against Edinburgh the following
month.
The problem has been diagnosed as a ''bulging'' spinal disc, and rest
has been prescribed as the most effective immediate cure.
The Bath lock, who was a 1993 British Lion in New Zealand, is making
arrangements to be seen by the SRU's medical adviser, Donald Macleod,
but is angry at reports emanating from down south that the condition is
career-threatening.
''So far as it being a threat to my career is concerned, I've spoken
to a few people in the press and I've categorically stated otherwise.
Yet, despite that, reports have appeared saying that my career is in the
balance. It's hassle that I can do without and it's totally
unjustified,'' he said.
''The back is coming along fine. It's definitely getting better but
it's one of those things that you can't put a time on. It wasn't the
result of a particular incident. It just flared up.
''It was sore before we played Edinburgh but it was OK during the
game. It flared up the following day and got progressively worse over
Christmas and New Year.''
Due to the immense stresses and strains imposed during scrummaging,
back problems are particularly prevalent among locks and prop forwards,
and surgery is often seen as the final solution. Ireland's Neil Francis
and England's Jason Leonard are two forwards who have been under the
surgeon's knife. Reed is obviously hoping that his period of rest will
render a surgical solution unnecessary.
The injury has kept Reed out of the Scotland side to play Ireland at
Murrayfield on Saturday but he has returned to light training and has
not totally ruled himself out of contention for a role in the Five
Nations' campaign.
''They've given me no real indication of when I can get back but I've
started light training and I'm being careful not to aggravate the
injury. I don't have a target. I'd rather wait until I get further
advice from the doctor,'' he said.
''However, I hope to be back in contention as soon as possible.
Hopefully, that would include some Five Nations' rugby but I've got to
get back to match fitness first.
''There's being physically fit, injury-free, and then there's match
fitness and that's where I'm maybe lagging. I've not done anything much
for the last month or so.
''I don't like missing internationals. If you're out because you're
not playing well enough then that is one thing, but to lose out on
international appearances because you're injured, well that's quite hard
to take,'' he declared.
Reed said that he had seen Damian Cronin's try in the Canada game only
on television. ''I'm told that Damian and Stewart Campbell played very
well and that's good for Scotland.
''People have rubbished Canada, but they were no mugs. After England
trounced them they went to France where everybody expected them to get
whipped, but they weren't. France are supposed to be the form team in
the world at the moment so that was no mean performance over there. That
puts Scotland's win in perspective,'' he said.

THE Bank of England is revising the calculation of the trade-weighted
sterling index which gives an indication of how the pound is faring
against a basket of other currencies.
The index will be rebased to 100 as at 1990 and the relative
importance attached to individual currencies is being recalculated on
the basis of trade flows in the the period 1989-1991. These weights are
designed to measure the relative importance of other countries as a
competitor to the manufacturing sector.
The Bank said that as an example the weight of the US dollar takes
account of US competition in the UK market, UK competition in the US
market and competition between the two countries in other markets.
The number of countries has been widened from 17 to 21, though some
important new countries, such as those in the Asia-Pacific region are
still excluded because their economic statistics are not considered
reliable enough.
The new calculation has resulted in the weight attaching to the US
falling from 20.4% to 16.5% and Japan from 8.8% to 7.0%. The European
Union combined has risen from 55.6% to 70.0%.

GRAHAM Gooch produced the kind of innings he has come to hate just a
few hours after having announced his intention to retire from
international cricket.
England's record Test run-maker will leave a stage he has graced for
nearly 20 years when the final match of this winter's Ashes series ends
on Tuesday week.
If there were any lingering doubts about the wisdom of that decision,
they were surely settled by yesterday's performance at Adelaide Oval.
''Getting 20s, 30s, and 40s is not what it's about,'' said Gooch after
having fallen to Craig McDermott for 34. ''I was playing well and
everything felt right . . . but I got out.''
That has been the story since he scored the last of his 20 Test
hundreds -- a double century, in fact -- against New Zealand at Trent
Bridge last June.
His 17 innings since then have brought 356 runs at an average of
20.94, even though he has looked in command more often than not.
A fitness fanatic, England's former captain has also been finding it
increasingly difficult at 41 years of age to maintain the peak physical
condition he believes is necessary to succeed at the highest level.
It was widely reported that Gooch, a reluctant tourist even in his
younger days, thought long and hard before agreeing to make a last Ashes
trip.
For him personally, with just one half-century from eight innings, as
well as Australia retaining the Ashes, it has not gone the way he hoped.

New York, Sunday -- Many of America's oldest brokerage houses are
cutting jobs again after a difficult year in the financial markets,
especially the bond business and the once-hot area of emerging markets
overseas.
From Merrill Lynch, the largest US brokerage, to others including
Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and now J P Morgan, cutbacks have become
the rule rather than the exception on Wall Street.
One reason for the cuts is that uncertainty in the financial markets
has meant losses or sharply lower profits for the firms that buy and
sell stocks, bonds and other securities on behalf of average investors
and corporate America.
In the latest quarter ended in December, profits at the largest and
most important securities firms fell as much as 75% from a year earlier.
As a result the brokerage firms have turned to staff cuts to trim
costs. The firms typically hire during the boom years and cut back when
times get lean.
Until the latest round of layoffs, employment was near the highs
reached before the 1987 stock market crash, industry officials claim.
Jeffrey Schaefer, senior vice-president and director of research at
the Securities Industry Association, said employment at New York Stock
Exchange-member firms was about 254,000 at the end of the third quarter.
Before the 1987 crash the same firms had about 262,000 employees. But
that fell to about 210,000 following post-crash layoffs before
employment began rising slowly again in 1991.
Mr Schaefer said 1994 brought Wall Street a ''bond market crash''
every bit as painful as the 1987 stock market crash. But the steep drop
in the bond market as interest rates rose last year got only passing
mention in the mainstream media, as opposed to the big headlines after
the 1987 crash, he noted.
In addition to the difficulties in the bond market, last month Mexico
devalued its peso, which has proven a sharp blow to the emerging markets
sector. But word of the latest round of layoffs on Wall Street actually
began trickling in last summer, long before the problems surfaced in
Mexico.
Mr Schaefer and others said the layoffs have been aimed at particular
areas, such as bonds or emerging markets, rather than the widespread
cuts made in the past.
''Management has been more cautious in hiring and we are seeing at the
moment smaller layoffs in total numbers than in past slowdowns,'' said
Perrin Long, an independent analyst who tracks the securities industry.
Still, layoffs have hit certain departments hard.
The cutbacks at J P Morgan and Goldman Sachs affected up to 10% of the
employees at each firm, and apparently were the biggest cuts on Wall
Street, industry officials said.
Morgan employed about 17,000 people while Goldman's workforce numbered
9500 before the latest cuts.
''We want to bring our expenses in line with our revenue outlook.
There isn't a firm on the street that isn't looking at the same
difficult market conditions and not coming to the same conclusions,''
said J P Morgan spokesman Richard Mahony, who declined to cite specific
figures on layoffs.
Officials at Goldman have also declined to discuss layoffs.
Other firms note they are doing some hiring while also firing. Morgan
Stanley Group is one of the few firms to have said that it is not
cutting staff.
Nicholas Crispi, president of Crispi Wagner, a recruitment firm, said
there is currently demand for people in institutional sales and
research, among other areas. But many people being let go will have
difficulty finding other employment in the industry, he said. -- Reuter.

* ALASTAIR Douglas, national youth champion in 1978 and junior
champion in 1981, won his first cross-country race in six years when he
took the Dunbartonshire title at Posties Park.
Steven Wylie (Cambuslang), who arrived too late to defend his Tom
Scott 10-mile title last year, cut it fine at the Lanarkshire
championships. He jumped out of his car at Drumpellier Park with the
field already lined up, and the start was delayed as he laced up spikes.
But Law's Alaister Russell relished the snow, winning by 10 seconds.
Wylie's club, however, swept all the team titles.

HIGHLAND-LEAGUE heroes Huntly yesterday began gearing up for the
biggest cup tie in their existence.
They will clash with holders Dundee United -- if the Tannadice team
manage to beat Clyde at Broadwood, on Tuesday, February 7, in their
third-round replay.
And Christie Park will be packed to its 4500 capacity after Huntly ran
riot with a 7-0 demolition of luckless Burntisland Shipyard.
Martin Stewart grabbed a hat-trick but -- even though he's a Dundee
United fan -- he doesn't want to face his favourite team in the fourth
round.
He said: ''Actually, I'd rather play Clyde, because I think we'd have
a better chance of winning.
''But it's going to be a big game either way, and everyone's looking
forward to it already.''
Stewart's hat trick will have scouts sitting up to take notice again,
but the 21-year-old -- who has just returned from a three-month injury
lay-off -- says he is happpy to stay with his home-town club.
Huntly boss Steve Paterson and assistant Willie Lawson yesterday began
making plans to watch the Clyde v Dundee United replay.
Lawson said: ''It's a great draw as far as the fans are concerned. I
think there was a big roar in the boardroom when we heard we could be
playing the holders.''
* SNOW and frost meant that only one Highland League fixture survived.
Buckie Thistle thrashed near-neighbours Rothes 5-0. David Galbraith,
Gordon Robertson, Jason Begg, Alan McPherson and Steve Bruce were on
target for the Victoria Park side.

THE statuesque Kate Staples is used to performing before a packed
Birmingham arena as Zodiac of Gladiators, writes Doug Gillon. But even
with the 8000-capacity stadium more than half empty, she still rose to
the occasion for Britain on Saturday.
The Essex woman set her twenty-third British record, also a
Commonwealth best, at 3.75 metres, winning the first women's pole vault
in an athletics international. The discipline may yet be added to the
Olympic programme next year, but Staples' winning height was .35m below
the world record set over the weekend by reinstated Chinese drug cheat
Sun Caiyun.
But the Russian women overcame that surprise defeat, and their 2am
arrival on the morning of the contest, to win the match, though with
fewer victories than a year ago.
Ann Griffiths logged the world's best 1500m time, 4min 14.74secs, to
beat Yetkaterina Podkopayeva, the 42-year-old World and European indoor
champion. And the Commonwealth record fell to Ashia Hansen and Jackie
Agyepong in the triple jump and hurdles respectively.
City of Glasgow's Mel Neef clocked 53.14 on the opening 400m leg of
the women's relay -- her first attempt at the distance this year, and
almost as fast as her best last season. She looks certain to achieve her
ambition of a world place.
Aileen McGillivray clocked a disappointing 7.53 as a guest in the
women's 60m.
Professor Peter Radford, executive chairman of British athletics,
confirmed that he is to protest to ITV over Scottish Television's
failure to take live coverage of the meeting. All other commercial
channels showed it live, save Scottish which screened a World War II
romantic drama instead, and athletics at 1.15am.

HOLDERS Manchester United will face Eric Cantona's old club, Leeds
United, in the fifth round of the FA Cup.
The Old Trafford tie will bring home to the banned Frenchman more than
any other game exactly what he threw away when he launched his attack on
a Selhurst Park fan last week.
A competition that has so far shown little magic is set to burst into
life in three weeks' time, with Newcastle seeking revenge over
Manchester City, the team that put them out of the Coca-Cola Cup this
season.
Wimbledon's reward for Sunday's win at Tranmere could be trip through
the Mersey Tunnel for a rerun of their famous 1989 final triumph over
Liverpool -- if the Anfield side can beat Burnley.
Luton will be fired up to win their replay against Southampton and
give manager David Pleat a return to Tottenham, the club that sacked him
in 1987.

AIDED by some muted bugle calls, the Gay Hussars was launched on an
unsuspecting public at last year's English Royal Show. The response to
yet another farming pressure group was underwhelming.
But, perhaps proving yet again it isn't what you know but who, the
group --now called the Agricultural Reform Group -- will have access to
the notable ears of the Prince of Wales and Farm Minister William
Waldegrave for several hours this Wednesday, at the behest of the
former.
The Royal seal of approval may or may not have something to do with
the fact that the ARG membership includes Patrick Holden, director of
the Soil Association, an organic farming group; arch green Jonathan
Porritt; and Sir Simon Gourlay, a former president of the English
National Farmers' Union and now a leading light in conservation farming.
The Prince is very keen on all things green.
Surprisingly, another key figure in the group is Oliver Walston, who
unashamedly admits to sloshing large amounts of chemicals on to the 2000
acres of arable crops he grows at Thriplow, Cambridgeshire, and who
earlier this year delivered a fairly testy lecture on the limited future
for organic production at the annual Cirencester Organic Farming
Conference.
''You would have thought we would have been very far apart. But, in
practice, we are rather close in our thinking,'' he said at the weekend.
''The main points of agreement are that the money that is coming into
farming today in the form of acreage payments and production subsidies
should gradually be phased out and, instead, the money should be given
for environmental purposes.
''In other words, Mr Average Farmer will get the same amount of money
that he gets today, but instead of simply getting that money for
planting an acre of wheat or peas, he will receive it for maintaining
the countryside; for keeping up a dyke; or planting a tree -- or
whatever.
''Which means two things. Number one, the countryside and the
environment is preserved. And number two, the public is happier. They
will say we don't mind the farmer getting this money, provided we are
getting something in return.''
This may sound odd from the farmer who is on record as boasting that
his three biggest sources of income are, in declining order, wheat,
sugar beet, and subsidies, and admits to receiving around #150,000 a
year of taxpayers' cash in set-aside and area aid payments. But he is
adamant the repeated references to these payments is intended to
highlight the ludicrous nature of the Common Agricultural Policy. ''It
is a crazy system,'' he says.
He is equally adamant that the ARG is not a formal pressure group. It
is an occasional getting together of like minded people to discuss ways
in which things can be improved. It has no intention of trying to usurp
the power of traditional farmers' or landowners' organisations.
The original name of the Gay Hussars came from the name of the London
restaurant where they held their first meeting.
Nor has Mr Walston any intention of entering conventional politics
himself, even though it was a very early ambition. Again by his own
admission, he was born ''with a silver spoon in every orifice.''
Went to Eton, Cambridge, and Princeton University in America, studying
history and politics, and his first job was as speechwriter to George
Brown MP. ''Today, 35 years later, I can think of no job I would like
less than to be a politician. I think they are all -- well, the word
rhymes with merchant bankers. I don't belong to a political party, and I
don't know who I will vote for at the next General Election. This is not
a cop out. I will vote.
''The trouble is, if you become a politician, you spend so much time
pressing the flesh. I like what I do. I like being able to write and
broadcast, and being able to say what I think. But the moment you
represent a constituency in Parliament, or a farm organisation, you then
have to compromise.''
Does that mean he has little real ambition left? ''I have the most
wonderful lifestyle and life of anybody I have ever met. If I won the
National Lottery I would live in the same house, drive the same car, and
do the same job. The only difference is that I might fly first class on
aeroplanes. As it is, I have a unique luxury that even the richest man
in Britain doesn't have -- freedom.''
This freedom allows, not only outspoken and sometimes outrageous
comments, but enables him to indulge a favourite pastime of travel.
This has taken him to many countries and, in particular, to maintain
strong connections with the United States, from which his grandparents
came at the beginning of the century. More recently, he has developed an
affinity for the Arctic, and has written a book about this vast white
mass. Why?
''It's because nobody goes there, and few people live there, and it's
clean, and it's quiet, and its cold. When I go to a hot country I get
very uncomfortable unless I am in an air conditioned hotel. I love the
Arctic, the animals, and the people. That's my great passion in life. I
absolutely adore it.''
His American wife Anne was brought up in West Africa, which might help
to explain his connection with this continent, and his quest in
organising ''Send a Tonne to Africa,'' which in 1984 raised #2.2m, and
shipped 12,000 tonnes of British wheat to Ethiopia and the Sudan.
Food remains one of his other passions -- alongside irritating other
farmers, which he does supremely well -- and although he enjoys cooking,
he admits to leaving most of this to his wife, whom he describes as
being a ''superb cook.''
There is a serious message behind his farmer-baiting tactics -- to
widen their horizons. Farmers are far too narrow minded, he says. They
can't be born on the farm, brought up there, educated in farming,
socialise with other farmers, and think of little else. ''Farming is an
occupational disease that induces tunnel vision,'' he says. For all
that, he loves his farm and the good life it provides, and admits he'll
be a ''little disappointed'' if one of his three children -- two
daughters and a son -- do not want to carry it on.

PAT McGinlay's view that this could be the season when Hibernian end a
93-year wait to win the Scottish Cup is not difficult to agree with.
Although there were a series of scares to suffer at Links Park, the
Edinburgh side continued their patient quest for goals and eventually
overcame the part-time challenge from Montrose.
The former Celtic midfield player pointed out that if Hearts beat
Rangers in the fourth round, one tough opponent will disappear, while
Hibs have the opportunity to despatch another when they face Falkirk or
Motherwell in the next stage.
But the most important feature of Saturday's draw was that the next
Hibs task is due to be undertaken at Easter Road, for there is still
alarm about their form away from home.
In the league, second-placed Hibs have scored only four times away
from their own ground this season.
Only Exeter in the Endsleigh League division three have taken a poorer
return from their away business.
At the Angus ground, where Montrose have a fine tradition in both
domestic cups, a few of the green and white clad players looked
distinctly uncomfortable, even early in Saturday's match.
Stephen Tweed lost concentration to allow Colin McGlashan into the
box, round Jim Leighton and clear in on goal.
But his error was countered when Willie Miller scuttled back to the
goal line to boot away a certain goal.
Even after McGinlay's drive in the forty-eighth minute struck a post,
then hit the prone David Larter on the shoulder and rolled agonisingly
over the line, Alex Miller's side weren't convincing.
McGinlay found Darren Jackson in 63 minutes, and his delightful chip
over Larter was the game's most skilful moment but again, although
Montrose were groggy, they were still in the fight.
David Farrell was sent off for an over-zealous challenge on Mark
Garden with 18 nervy minutes left and Tweed atoned for his earlier
slackness by clearing another McGlashan shot, as it rolled along the
goal line off a post.
It's an astonishing phenomenon, for such a gifted side, to struggle so
significantly away from Easter Road, where they are still undefeated in
the league this season.
However, Montrose, tactically well prepared by John Holt, must take
much of the credit for this latest discomfort and he was entitled to his
opinion that, goals apart, little separated the teams.
Stewart Beedie was his anchor man in midfield, and the ability that
has competed in the premier division with St Johnstone, Dundee United,
and Hibs kept the part-time challenge in shape.
As the relieved Edinburgh party headed back down the east coast, it
was clear that McGinlay's Scottish Cup dream could come true if Hibs
continue to be pulled out of the hat first.
Home sweet home, indeed.

WITH bodies skittling around in his wake, Tom McKean battled to his
fifth consecutive 800 metres victory of the year, helping Britain beat
Russia in the men's athletics international in Birmingham on Saturday.
But a clash which left team-mate Craig Winrow sprawled on the infield
and a Russian disqualified may lead to guests being banned from such
races in future.
''I feel they should not be allowed,'' said Verona Elder, UK team
manager at the McDonald's International. ''The person in there has
earned their British vest and should not have to worry about guests.''
McKean had dominated a modestly-paced race, waiting for the challenge.
But when European champion Andrey Loginov charged in pursuit in the
final 70 metres, he clashed with English guest Martin Steele. Their arms
windmilled, Steele barged Winrow, and the man ranked UK No.1 outdoors
last season crashed to the ground.
Loginov got to within a foot of McKean, who won in 1min 50.04sec, then
castigated both Winrow and Steele. ''Craig was unfortunate, but should
have got up,'' said McKean. ''I finished when I went down against the
USA last year in Glasgow. We could have lost the match by one point.''
McKean agreed that guests are a distraction: ''The priority is to win
for Britain, but if challenged, even by a guest, the instinct is still
to respond.''
Brian Whittle was a victim in another physical race, finishing third
in the 400m, his left ankle punctured with spike wounds and his shoe
soaked in blood. Second, on the shoulder of the leader and poised to
attack with 170m to go, he was barged from behind by Dmitriy Golovastov
who was lucky to escape disqualification. Whittle, who did well to stay
on his feet, lost all momentum, but clocked the world qualifying time of
47.50.
Ultimately, he enjoyed revenge over Golovastov, who finished fourth in
the European championships in Helksinki last year. The pair were left in
a head-to-head on the anchor stage of the 4 x 400m relay. Despite
starting six metres down, Whittle caught him, then won by .05, punching
the air in delight.
Colin Jackson delivered an outstanding double. The European indoor 60m
champion logged the world's second fastest time of the winter season,
6.58sec, then won the hurdles in 7.43, world's best for the year.
John Regis also recorded the world's top time of the year, taking the
200m in 20.65.
Dundee's Ian Campbell, passed over for the 1500m, despite being five
seconds faster than those chosen, took little comfort from a UK win by
Ian Grime in a time almost seven seconds slower than the Scot has run
this year. But a good showing at the AAA Championships next weekend
should confirm Campbell for the match aganist France in Glasgow a week
on Saturday.

Dundee 2, Partick Thistle 1,
THISTLE'S Scottish Cup jinx struck again yesterday when Dundee bundled
the Glasgow club out of this year's tournament at Dens Park.
Jim Hamilton, the youngest player on the field, stole the limelight by
heading the winner five minutes from the end of a pulsating tie to edge
out Thistle for the sixth consecutive year in the third round.
But John Lambie's outfit had only themselves to blame, because they
dominated for much of the time against a first division team who rarely
sparkled.
''There was only one team in it after the first 20 minutes,'' said
Lambie. ''But to be fair, if you have all the pressure but do not score,
then you have only yourselves to blame.''
However, the manager was loath to go into detail about the tie's most
controversial moment, an incident after 34 minutes in which Thistle
looked to have equalised George Shaw's second-minute opener.
The far-side linesman found little wrong with Wayne Foster's strike,
but referee Jim McGilvray disallowed the goal because of offside.
But as Lambie confirmed, his side failed to take advantage of several
of the tie's best scoring chances, and paid the penalty when 18-year-old
Hamilton netted the winner at a stage when Thistle looked set for
victory.
With the Firhill club's plans having been upset by the late illness of
Ian Cameron, it was not surprising that Dundee sprang from the traps
with a greater enthusiasm.
Cameron was taken to hospital with suspected appendicitis, prompting
Lambie into late team switches. But it is doubtful if the regular
formation would have been sufficiently on cue to prevent Dundee's early
blasts.
Only a save by Nicky Walker at Neil Duffy's feet prevented an opener
inside the 60 seconds, and when Shaw nipped in to net a minute later,
there was nothing the Jags could do about it.
Neil McCann sprinted past Alan Dinnie before curling in the perfect
cross for Shaw to meet with a diving header.
But on the hour mark Thistle equalised with a fine ''old boys''
finish. Steve Pittman and Craig, former Dens Park players, teamed up and
Craig rounded off the move with a good first-time angled volley from 10
yards.
But Thistle were stunned by Hamilton's last-gasp contribution.
DUNDEE -- Pageau, McQuillan, N Duffy, Wieghorst, J Duffy, Bain, Shaw,
Vrto, Hamilton, Britton, McCann. Substitutes -- Ritchie, Tosh, Mathers.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, Dinnie, Pittman, Watson, Welsh, Turner,
McDonald, Craig, Foster, McWilliams, Taylor. Substitutes -- Gibson,
Milne, Cairns.
Referee -- J McGilvray (Edinburgh).

IT is the strangest thing, but the wood pigeons are back feeding on
the rape. They haven't bothered us for the last two years. We thought
they had so much set-aside to feed on, that they weren't bothering.
And yet they are back feeding in their thousands. I only had to go
away to the South-west for two days, and they had cleaned all the
foliage off two of my six fields.
That has been something of a talking point among the boys at the
Salmon Inn. The Irishman had had three acres cleaned-up. He presumed
they were lost, and wanted to know how to avoid losing his remaining
hundred acres.
We were quick to put his mind at ease. ''It won't do it the slightest
harm. As long as it is well rooted, the rape will come on strong in the
Spring. It might be a few days later at the harvest, but it won't affect
the yield. In fact, it may help your disease control.
''If there are no leaves in the winter, there is no need to spray with
fungicides. In fact, the only disadvantage with the doos is if they only
eat one bit -- so that it ripens unevenly, and you can't get it all cut
at once.''
''The Irishman's will all be ready at the same time. I know, because
I'm cutting it,'' says Mossie.
''But should I not be getting a banger going to scare the brutes
off?'' says the Irishman. We put a stop to that idea. The bangers are
completely effective for an area of about 10 square yards round the gun,
so all you need is about 500 guns to the acre.
Mossie topped that too. He remembers the time he found a bird's nest
in one of his gas guns. In fact, almost nobody bothers with them
nowadays. They are the worst possible publicity for the industry and,
unless you have plenty of them, and keep them moving, they don't work.
All this was explained to the Irishman. What we didn't explain was
that the pigeons can't be in two places at once. As long as they were
eating his crops, they can't be eating ours.
Anyway, the Irishman was fly enough not to take the advice kindly
given, and he has managed to keep most of the doos flying. That, I
supposed, was the reason they had all landed at Little Ardo.
But Mossie had another theory.
As you know, he has been giving me his second-best advice over the
last couple of years as to what and when I should spray my crops. The
banker (if we still had such a thing, rather than just a
hole-in-the-wall connected by red tape to a bank of computers) could
testify to the fact that this advice has been a considerable improvement
on what went before it.
By way of a sweetener, it was agreed that Mossie would accept a day's
shooting at the joint expense of myself and Her Majesty.
And so it was that we landed, along with Nicol from Keith, the Red
Rooster, The Family Man (so called because his family commitments make
it impossible to come to the Discussion Group) and Bain the Butcher, at
Auchmacoy near Ellon. It is only the second time I've been to a shoot
when the laird was at home.
I brought the soup, the sandwiches, the Stilton, and the port, and was
determined to do right by my guest. But if I ever get cornered into such
an expense again, I'll just do the paying and let him do the shooting.
I am a good hunter. If I decide I want a pheasant for the pot, or a
hare to make soup for the gods, I can go out with my gun and be back
very quickly with my mission accomplished. But there's something about
standing freezing in line, and looking like one of the Virgin soldiers,
that doesn't suit me.
I did shoot a partridge on the first drive, and a pheasant on the
second. I might have had a third kill, had Mossie not hit that one again
before it reached the ground.
After that, I suffered humiliation upon humiliation. When I go hunting
in my own wood, no one sees my misses. But out there in the open, no
error goes unaccounted.
My greatest disaster was at a patch of game crop. I had the prime spot
at the end of the field, and the whole effort was designed to funnel the
game down to me. Beaters and dogs in front of me, and eager guns to the
left and right, I waited.
The strategy was a great success -- except that all the birds decided
to fly at once. One broke and came low. ''Game over,'' shouted the Red
Rooster. ''Too low,'' screamed Mossie, as I swung my gun at it. I let it
through, and missed with one shot.
I would reload. But that was the signal for about 20 pheasants to fly
straight out at me. There was no time to reload. I would fire off my
remaining cartridge. I took too long aiming, and then -- nothing. I
hadn't put the safety catch off. By the time I had fired and reloaded, I
couldn't have hit a barn door with a shovel.
And that gave Mossie his theory about why 10,000 pigeons are so keen
to graze on Little Ardo this year. ''They ken they're safe. They saw you
sheetin' at Auchmacoy.''
I am sorry that so many in the West had trouble finding Farmer's Diary
Vol 3 in time for Christmas. They can be had in hardback, and by return
of post, from me at Methlick, Aberdeenshire, AB41 OHR. Tel 0651 806 218.

IF they can overcome Clydebank at Kilbowie Park tomorrow night in the
tie postponed on Saturday, Hearts will almost certainly get the chance
to make amends for the quarter-final defeat in the Tennents Scottish Cup
last season by Rangers.
On the presumption, dangerous though it may be, that Walter Smith's
men will beat Hamilton on the same night, the two premier division sides
would be drawn together at Tynecastle in the fourth round.
If that turns out to be the case there could be an interesting tussle
between Sky and BBC TV, both of whom have rights to choose a tie for
live coverage.
Hearts were beaten 2-0 by Rangers in the quarter-finals at Ibrox last
season but would be more formidable opponents on recent form at their
own stadium but, either way, the tie could be immensely important
financially to Tommy McLean's side, which is certainly the way
Meadowbank Thistle and Berwick Rangers will be looking at the incentive
they now have when they meet in their postponed tie on Wednesday.
The winners will meet Celtic, thus being able to say that they went
all the way to Hampden in the cup. The financial boost for one of these
second division sides is clearly an exciting prospect.
The tie which will rival any other in the next round will be at Easter
Road, where Hibs await the winners of the all-premier postponed game
between Falkirk and Motherwell. That has been rescheduled for tomorrow
after the teams' hopes to play yesterday were dashed because of policing
problems. Draw:
Hibernian v Falkirk or Motherwell; Clydebank or Hearts v Hamilton or
Rangers; Huntly v Dundee United or Clyde; Stirling Albion or Airdrie v
Dunfermline; St Johnstone or Stenhousemuir v Aberdeen; Celtic v
Meadowbank Thistle or Berwick Rangers; Dundee v Raith Rovers; Kilmarnock
or Greenock Morton v East Fife or Ross County. (Ties to be played on
February 18).

QUEEN'S Park president Malcolm MacKay has called a special meeting
tonight in response to criticism about the way in which the Hampden club
is being run.
The 10-man board are facing growing pressure from angry fans
determined to force change.
One rebel said: ''There is a group of us who have met several times to
discuss the way the club is going, and we are unanimous that, on and off
the park, things are a shambles.''
Queen's Park are currently struggling in third-bottom spot in the
third division.
Long-serving manager Eddie Hunter was sacked before Christmas, and his
post advertised.
But the board have still to appoint a successor.
The spokesman for the fans added: 'We will be asking Mr MacKay about
this and other matters of concern.
''As far as we are concerned, the club needs a change of direction.
''The difficulty is forcing change. The club's voting structure means
the committee are virtually running a closed shop.''
* FORFAR extended their lead in the third division over Ross County to
five points by securing a 1-1 draw at Arbroath.
A deflected Shanks shot gave the home side the lead, but David
Bingham's equaliser deprived Arbroath of what would have been a first
win at Gayfield this season.

IT does not need a crystal ball to predict that by the end of the
century the cost of Britain's wood and wood products imports will be at
least #1m an hour, for every hour, in every day of the year.
Last financial year, with the country in recession, wood imports were
costing #719,000 every hour, or -- if you like big figures --
#6.3billion a year. Since then, timber prices have been spiralling
upwards. Canada, for example, the largest timber producing nation in the
world, has its eyes firmly fixed on the lucrative Japanese market.
''Japan is our bright star,'' says Phil Gilbert, director of trade and
planning at the British Columbian Council of Forest Industries. ''We are
now shipping more to Japan than to the entire European market. For a
variety of reasons, trade with Europe, and the UK in particular, is only
about a quarter of what it was 10 years ago.
The Japanese market will continue to grow, and we have started trading
again with China, where the potential is enormous.''
To what extent other traditional British suppliers will be attracted
to the Pacific Rim is uncertain, but some Scandinavians are already
doing business with the Far East, which is not good news for Britain's
balance of trade position.
When the Government set up its forestry review group, the terms of
reference required due regard to be taken ''of the Government's other
economic objectives.''
The review, which cost #833,000, remains secret, which is unfortunate,
because we do not know what recommendations went to Government Ministers
to reduce Britain's 90% dependence on wood imports.
Ministers would have been told that almost 80% of these imports are
conifers, most of which could be grown in Britain. And further, that UK
demand for wood over the next 50 years is likely to double in volume
terms.
While Ministers must have considered this information, they have also
chosen to ignore it -- or, what is perhaps more likely, the Treasury
went berserk at the thought of having to engage in such long-term
planning.
So, what is the Government's response to its review? For the financial
year 1994-95, the budget for new plantings, private and State, is #25m
-- which equals the present cost of imports for about a day and a half!
Of that #25m, it will be surprising if #7m goes to the planting of
commercial conifers.
Secretary of State Ian Lang is confident that the outcome of the
review has set the framework for the future success of forestry in
Britain. Speaking in Edinburgh Castle at the main celebration of the
Forestry Commission's 75th anniversary, he said: ''The recent review has
recognised and responded to much of the advice received from private
growers, industry representatives, and countryside and environmental
organisations.''
These same private growers and industry representatives are not at all
in agreement with these sentiments. In a letter to the Secretary of
State, signed by 18 leading forestry and land-use organisations, they
have expressed deep concern about the long-term effects of the review.
They maintain that the sweeping 1988 changes to the tax treatment of
commercial forestry resulted, as they had predicted, in a serious
decline in new planting, and stagnation within the industry. The
incentives review leaves them deeply disappointed. ''The changes
proposed will not, in our view, stimulate investment in new planting, or
revive the forestry sector as a whole,'' they said.
When the conclusions of the forestry review were announced last
summer, the Government invited views from the industry. Scottish Office
Agriculture Minister Sir Hector Monro said that there would be adequate
time for consultation.
A Government announcement is expected on the shape this consultation
will take.

WILLIE Miller yesterday admitted having damaged Aberdeen's
dressing-room door as he vented his anger over his team's poor finishing
in their 1-0 win over lowly Stranraer in the Scottish Cup.
Later, he offered to pay for the damage and said: ''As far as I am
concerned a mountain is being made out of a molehill. A door was damaged
as I went in, but I do not feel I have to justify my behaviour in this
matter.
''Sometimes a manager becomes frustrated in certain situations.
Perhaps I did open it a bit too violently.
''If that is a problem, surely it is a minor one. I did not mean it to
happen, but the door swung back against the wall.
''No-one else was involved. There was no confrontation, and it is not
as if anyone was injured. I was a just a bit frustrated and upset over
the number of scoring opportunities we had missed.
''But I am only human after all. If the chairman wants me to pay for a
new door, I will.''
He joked: ''It was an old door anyway and needed replacing. Maybe I
don't know my own strength.''
His team were drawn away to St Johnstone or Stenhousemuir in the
fourth round and Miller added: ''I am delighted to get through to the
next round, although we would have preferred another home tie. On the
positive side, it is not a bad one for our fans in terms of the
travelling they will have to do.''
Club chairman Ian Donald yesterday ruled out any chance of Miller
being billed for the damage. Equally jocularly, he added: ''If the door
needs repairing we have a perfectly good joiner on the board in Stewart
Milne.''
* HAMILTON face a busy week. Tomorrow they meet Rangers in their
postponed cup-tie at Firhill -- tickets will still be on sale today for
the match -- and they also move out of Douglas Park this week.
The floodlights are being taken down and bulldozers are moving in as
the first stage in building a new stadium adjoining the old ground.

STEVE Davis proved in Newport last night that youth is no substitute
for experience as he retained his Regal Welsh Open title by beating
19-year-old John Higgins 9-3.
Giving away 18 years to his Scottish opponent, Davis made it 70
tournament wins out of 93 finals.
The six-times world champion couldn't contain his delight at one of
his most pleasing wins. ''To be honest at the age of 37 I should be past
it,'' he claimed. ''But I'm not. I am giving these players at least 10
years' start in every tournament so each win now is a bonus.
''To be honest, at the start of the season I wondered if something
like this victory was going to happen again. It does mean a lot to be to
win tournaments like this, especially in today's game.''
He started as favourite against Higgins, who had beaten him in the
Dubai Classic earlier this season.
Despite slipping 2-1 behind, Davis finished the first session 4-3
ahead and totally dominated the evening session. Higgins did not win
another frame, though he came close in the ninth, which he lost on the
pink.
Higgins admitted later: ''That was a turning point. Had I won that, I
might have been able to put a big more pressure on Steve.
''I've no complaints, though. Steve's safety game is bullet-proof. I'm
glad I didn't face Steve at his peak.''
The Wishaw youngster's consolation was #18,000 and a place in the
provisional top 16.
* STEPHEN Maguire's hopes of clinching his fourth Scottish Junior
championship came unstuck on Saturday at the Masters Club, Glasgow.
He already has secured a hat trick of titles this season, but lost 3-2
to Alex Lambie, from Larkhall.
In the final on February 27 Lambie will meet Erskine's Scott McKenzie,
a 3-0 winner over Edinburgh's Justin Wade in the other semi-final.

THE death of umpire Ron Luciano last week sent shock waves through the
baseball world. Luciano reportedly asphyxiated himself by carbon
monoxide poisoning at his home in New York.
His end is made especially perplexing by the fact that his career was
characterised by frivolity and good spirits.
Luciano's outlook on the sport was just one way in which he kept many
around him from taking themselves too seriously. On one occasion, for
example, he was asked to offer a general impression of how baseball had
changed.
The answer came: ''When I started, baseball was played by nine
competitors on grass. By the time I finished, there were 10 men on a
side, the game was played indoors on plastic, and I spent half my time
watching for a man dressed in a chicken suit who kept trying to kiss
me.''
Luciano also had some thoughts on umpiring. ''It is,'' he said, ''best
described as the profession of standing between two seven-year-olds with
one ice-cream cone.''
* DON MacLean, of the Washington Bullets basketball team, is not
having a good year. In fact, so bad has his season been that he has
become renowned as one of the worst defensive players in the NBA.
That is not to say that MacLean is without courage. On the contrary,
he was first into the fray during a recent altercation which began when
a female friend of his was insulted.
None the less, sports anchor-man Craig Kilborn was far from impressed.
''That's the first person he's defended this year,'' he observed.
* PLAYERS in the National Hockey League have decided that it is time
to begin their season after contract disputes caused the cancellation of
468 games.
That may not have been all bad, however. Sports Illustrated offered
several reasons why the delayed start to the season may have been good.
For one thing, the season will no longer have to be referred to as the
1994/95 season. And the delay has allowed NHL chiefs to figure out what
to do with what has become known as the worst mid-season All Star game
in the USA: cancel it.
Team media guides, difficult to find in the early season, are
available for the opening game for the first time. Play-off games
scheduled for New York's Madison Square Garden now can be conducted
without the smell of circus elephants who have usually just departed
before the ice rink is laid out in late April.
But best of all, union chief Bob Goodenow and NHL commissioner Gary
Bettman will be too exhausted to show their faces for several months.
* YESTERDAY the San Diego Chargers clashed with the San Francisco
49ers in the 1995 Super Bowl, the only event on the American sporting
calendar that brings the country to a standstill.
Miami played host to the festivities, with more than 2000 highly
informed media representatives making the trip.
Of course, some among the media were not as informed as they might
have been. Such was illustrated at a Chargers' press conference during
the week.
Tight end Alfred Pupunu was asked what language he and team-mate
Junior Seau were speaking following the AFC Conference victory that put
them through to the Super Bowl. Mystified, Pupunu replied: ''English.''
Pupunu is from Tonga, while Seau is from Samoa.
* THE Dallas Cowboys did not make it to the Super Bowl, but their
coach, Jimmy Johnson, did. He recently opened a restaurant in 15,000ft
of prime Miami Beach real estate.
The establishment is called ''The Three Rings Bar and Grille,'' so
named for the two Super Bowl rings and one collegiate ring Johnson has
won in his coaching career.
Patrons have been entertained by, among other things, a woman in a
mermaid suit swimming in the adjacent hotel's swimming pool which is
visible through a tropical fish tank behind the restaurant's bar.
Such visions have already prompted diners to nickname the premises
''The Three Ring Circus Bar and Grille.''
* BEING in the media glare at the Super Bowl can be trying, especially
if the interviews are dragging on and you've got some serious weight
training to do.
That was the case for 49ers' Harry Boatswain, who was keen to get back
to business even while reporters hounded him and his team-mates.
Boatswain became impatient and decided to do his weight training
anyway. He started with bench presses, but with no weights to hand he
had to find a substitute -- a female journalist.

ALL sport starts with the masses. It starts with children playing.
They are the ones who think up silly things to do with their bodies and
minds.
A combination of excess energy and a lack of mental concentration
dreams up games. And all the sports start with that and add another
strand: societal organisation, which is really sociologese for some boys
and girls imposing a hierarchy on their little chums. Thus you have
rules in games. Thus, too, rules in human behaviour.
Take a look at any primary school playground. The boys will be
learning games like football, slowly and somewhat chaotically, but
learning how to accept that, without respect for an opponent, the game
would not merely be impossible to operate, it would not exist.
Girls will play with ropes. When one of the girls trips she goes back
to the end of the line, waits her turn, and then skips again until she
trips once more . . . and goes back to the end of the line. These are
rules without which the game cannot proceed.
Girls are better at recognising this than boys, which is why you will
not get an Erica Cantona jumping two-footed into a football crowd.
For if sport starts with games, it ends up in wars, where rules are
scarcely existent. Ideal for men. But as in wars there is a top
structure and so there is in sport. And snobbery is the oil which
greases the wheels of hierarchy. And particularly in the world of sport.
For children's games turn into sport, and organised at that, with lots
and lots of money. The spondulicks pour into sport and the more they do,
the less sporting it is. But the snobbier it gets, the more the
hierarchy imposes itself.
When the children decide who plays and who is acceptable, the children
grow up and -- out of their own, rather immature sets of organisation --
create the organisations which control sport.
This is a simplistic way of telling you how sport became rigid in what
it administrates. Almost every sport in Ireland is All-Ireland. Soccer
is not, though rugby football is, because the Irish -- north and south
-- soccer associations are determined to have the officials and their
wives and other hangers-on enjoying the benefits of being toffs. An
All-Ireland soccer group would halve the number of officials.
But then take a look at the social snobbery of Irish rugby as against
Irish soccer. Irish rugby is for the better-off, just as in the rest of
the British Isles.
Today, if you play sport you are either middle-class or Labour
aristocracy.
But let us look at sports where not just money is needed, but social
distinction. Try horse-riding, or dressage, or any place where clothes
for the dressing-up, let alone dressage, is expensive. Or lacrosse, a
splendid game which only the girls (and a few boys) from the well-off
schools and backgrounds can play, not because it is especially
expensive, for it is not, but because the ordinary schools and the
poorer girls don't get a chance to play.
And every Wimbledon the nation watches. Then ordinary kids go out on
the streets playing with cheap bats, wanting to play tennis. Every year
posh people pay their subs for their tennis club and pay for their
rather wealthy kids to play, too.
Snobbery in golf clubs? I don't want to hear another golfer telling me
about how Scottish golf clubs are democratic. Once, when I confronted
our European editor and golf zealot, Murray Ritchie, he was forced to
admit it. Scottish golf cabals are cheap enough for only a common old
working chap to join, but he never gets to be captain or secretary, or
treasurer.
And over the years in which I have been covering sports where money
talks and social class rules, I have to tell you that these sports often
try their best to get everybody involved, to the extent of subsidising
what they can, and who they can.
But the people's game? Association football contains some of the most
unpleasant individuals in any sphere of life in any country. The
snobbery of middle-class games is being attacked even by those in the
inside.
The snobbery of footy knows no bounds. Tell me about the welcome you
will get if you turn up at a sport through a friend, some sport
associated with class distinction, like polo or yachting or motor
racing. I have found more decency there than at any senior football
ground, where the snobbery knows no bounds and where you are kept out.
Sometimes it is inverted, sometimes not, depending on which sport you
find yourself attending. But it is there, endemic to the notion of games
and your place in the world.
Go back to the children, though. They play it, thank God, for the
pleasure. And not the money or the ribboned coat. And snobbery is the
ribboned coat and not playing the game at all, at all.
' Snobbery is the oil which greases the wheels of hierarchy. And
particularly in the world of sport '

THE shameful scenes at the Marassi Stadium yesterday before the Serie
A game between Genoa and AC Milan in which one fan was stabbed to death
and 10 others were taken to hospital when rioting broke out brought to
an end a black week for football, not only in Italy but throughout
Europe.
Days earlier, two self-confessed Mafia killers revealed to a court
that they had been hired by the vice-president of Napoli to gain control
of the club.
The Camorra (Naples Mafia) members said that they had been approached
by Gianni Punzo and agreed to force president Corrado Ferlaino to sell
him his shares.
This they attempted to do through a campaign of intimidation and
violence. A plane was flown over Napoli's stadium with a banner telling
Ferlaino to quit, then both his house and business were bombed, they
alleged.
The plot failed because public sympathy swung in favour of Ferlaino,
who has since left because of Napoli's debts. Punzo, though, still
remains.
Coming on top of revelations of widespread drug abuse by Napoli
players aboard a luxury yacht and that they threw a championship to AC
Milan because of Mafia demands exerts more pressure on the legislators
to clean up the image of the game.
* THE repercussions of Eric Cantona's attack on a Crystal Palace
supporter were felt within 48 hours in Holland, where it had received
extensive coverage on television.
FC Twente Enschede were forced to impose a life ban of one of their
10-year-old players, one Harun Sauri, after he emulated the Manchester
United star and injured a team-mate in training.
His parents, who plan an appeal to the Dutch FA, protested that Sauri
had never had any disciplinary problems or criminal record.
But an Enschede spokesman said yesterday: ''The assault was a direct
result of a sad example by one of the world's leading players.
Nevertheless, we cannot allow this sort of behaviour within our club and
the boy will never play here again.''
* BAYERN Munich coach Giovanni Trapattoni will quit at the end of the
season to return to Internazionale or replace Arrigo Saachi at Italy's
national team.
Trapattoni, who had constant problems because he could not speak
German, admitted: ''This was a new challenge in my career and if I had
been a little younger I would have stayed on. But I must now do what is
best where I know best, but I am proud of what I have achieved in such a
short time in Munich.''
The Swede Sven Goran Eriksson, now with Sampdoria, is his likely
replacement.
* COACH Arsenio Inglesias will part company with Deportivo La Coruna
after criticism from his players that his tactics and training methods
were outdated.
Brazilian striker Claudio and the Spaniard, Fran, were most vocal in
attacking Inglesias.
Their conduct displeased their leading player, Bebeto, who has said he
will leave along with his coach to return to Vasco da Gama or Flamengo.
* BORUSSIA Dortmund have imposed a #10,000 fine on their Brazilian
defender, Julio Cesar, for reporting three weeks late for training after
the mid-season break in Germany.
Downward trend
BELGIUM convened a meeting of all the presidents of their professional
clubs at the weekend to avert the mounting crisis. The collective debt
now stands at #40m and attendances dropped by one-fifth last season.
The depressing trend has continued this term with 8% losses registered
at the halfway mark.
A commission has been established to find ways of making their
football more attractive, but a move to cut their first division from 18
to 16 clubs was defeated.
However, in future all representatives in the Champions' League will
donate revenue from television of their European ties to a common good
fund to help lesser clubs.

Sunderland 1, Tottenham 4
TOTTENHAM Hotspur, only re-instated to the FA Cup because of their
chairman Alan Sugar's determination in challenging the Football
Association's ban on them, yesterday reached the fifth round in
unexpected comfort.
The critical moment was a handling offence by their longest-serving
player, Gary Bennett. His flying goal-line ''save'' in the fiftieth
minute from Popescu's goal-bound shot, meant a red card as well as the
penalty that Jurgen Klinsmann converted immaculately.
Six minutes later, Teddy Sheringham collected a throw in on the right,
moved along the bye-line and, finding no support, drove in the second
goal himself. A corner, falling for Gary Mabbutt, brought a third in the
space of 13 minutes, the substantial deflection past the home goalkeeper
summing up how comprehensively fortune had deserted Sunderland.
Phil Gray, once of Tottenham, turned in Scott's cross to cheer up the
locals a little without convincing them that a sensation was still
possible.
Klinsmann took advantage of the depleted defence to head his second
just before the end.
Gray was also guilty of missing a chance after 20 minutes.
Goalkeeper Ian Walker got away with leaving a larger gap to his right
than he might have imagined as Gray bore down on him, only to pull the
shot beyond the far post.
''A wee bit unlucky not to be in front,'' was the interval verdict of
Ally McCoist, who had also watched his former club win at Carlisle in
the previous round.
''It was a tough battle, especially in the first half, just what we
expected,'' Sheringham said generously.
Yesterday's two other fourth-round FA Cup ties confirmed the
Premiership's domination of this season's competition. Bristol City
could make nothing of their lengthy spells of possession at home to
Everton and lost 1-0 to Matt Jackson's goal. Tranmere went down 2-0 at
home to Wimbledon, whose scorers were Oyvind Leonhardsen and Robbie
Earle.
The fifth-round FA Cup draw is:
Newcastle v Manchester City, Manchester United v Leeds, Sheffield
Wednesday or Wolverhampton v Leicester, Queen's Park Rangers v Millwall
or Chelsea, Burnley or Liverpool v Wimbledon, Watford v Crystal Palace,
Tottenham v Luton or Southampton, Everton v Coventry or Norwich.
Matches to be played February 18 or 19.

A HOME of your own, as the advertising slogan used to phrase it, is
one thing -- but a golf course? Addicts of the game have regularly
fantasised over designing a layout which would accommodate their
strengths and camouflage their weaknesses. But actually to own one?
Envious thoughts occurred as Greg Norman described his little
self-indulgence -- The Medalist Club near his home in Florida which he
helped design with the noted architect, Pete Dye, but does not own
outright, holding a one third interest in the development which opened
this month.
It has been said of Norman that he epitomises all that is wrong with
aspects of modern sport. The perception of him obscures the reality,
that two Open Championships in fact represented a notable
under-achievement by one whose income is annually calculated in millions
of dollars.
Be that as it may, there he is, installed on Jupiter Island in some
magnificence with his family, owner of a Ferrari or two, a jet aircraft
and a sea-going boat of some substance. And now a share in a
members-only club restricted to 250, each of whom pay $75,000 to join
and a $6000 a year subscription.
Henry Longhurst once wrote of the head-long expansion of courses in
Palm Springs, California, that the prescribed method of construction was
to ''bulldoze the flat desert floor into the desired contours, sow the
grass seed, turn on the water -- and jump back.'' Completion of Norman's
project conformed to that sort of time scale.
Work started last February and the course was completed by September.
The opening was delayed until recently and the result is a course which,
from the tiger tees, measures 7400 yards, has an hallucinatory rating of
76.8 and over which 68 is so far Norman's personal best score.
Norman's under-stated description of the course as ''a tough test''
would be unlikely to be otherwise, given the identity of his
collaborator. Dye gave the world the appalling island green and he has
recently published his autobiography which carries the entirely apt
title: ''Bury me in a pot bunker.''
Dye would appear to have graduated from the design school whose motto
is ''Golfer's Love Punishment'' -- and as if to confirm the American
political writer James Reston's theory that the Scots having bestowed
the guilt of whisky on mankind felt obliged to invent golf as a
redemptive act.
The type of course golfers would play once just to be able to say they
had is definitely not user-friendly, even tournament players have
baulked at the extremes of some of Dye's challenges, Sawgrass in Florida
and PGA West in California being two in that category that spring to
mind.
Still, the golf course as a rich man's plaything does have an appeal
to the ego. Henry Cotton has recalled that the 1937 American Ryder Cup
team's first port of call to get rid of their sea legs was Sir Philip
Sassoon's private nine-hole course at his Trent Park estate.
Now Jaime Patino autocratically rules over the fortunes of Valderrama
and plans for the 1997 Ryder Cup match. King Hassan of Morocco has a
personal course at Agadir and a Hong Kong entrepreneur will take
possession of collect another, this one at Birchgrove, the former Sussex
home of Harold Macmillan -- an expensive method of guaranteeing the
starting time you want.

IAN and Richard Kerr, of John Kerr and Sons, Kirklands, Dunsyre,
Lanarkshire, have won first prize in the Scottish regional silage
competition, organised by the British Grassland Society.
They will now go forward to the society's national competition.
Results will be announced in London on March 15. Joint runners up in the
Scottish competition were Messrs A and W A McWilliam of Colfin,
Stranraer, and the Moray Estates Development Company at Wellheads,
Forres.
* THE Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)
arrangements, through which farmers receive CAP subsidies from the EU,
will be similar to those for last year. The deadline for submitting IACS
forms will again be May 15, and blank forms will be sent to farmers in
March.
Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, paid tribute
to the businesslike approach farmers had adopted to the forms in the
past two years. ''I urge farmers again to complete them with great
care,'' he said.
Schemes covered by IACS include Arable Area Payments, Beef Special
Premium, Suckler Cow Premium, Sheep Annual Premium, and Hill Livestock
Compensatory Allowances.
* MAXIMUM compensation payable during February for an animal
slaughtered because it is affected with brucellosis or tuberculosis --
or is a reactor when tested for either disease -- will be #597, the
Scottish Office Agriculture Department has announced.

Fourth Test in Adelaide
GRAHAM Thorpe and John Crawley chose the perfect day to show England
that youth must now be given its head.
Within hours of Graham Gooch's announcement that he will retire from
international cricket at the end of the tour, the pair kept their
country's flag flying at the Adelaide Oval.
In English terms, Thorpe, 25, and Crawley, 23, are babies. But they
and more like them must quickly develop into reliable Test performers.
Gooch will not be around against the West Indies next summer and it is
still more likely than not that Mike Gatting -- who today followed his
first-innings century with a duck -- will also disappear from the scene.
''I think it's in the best interests of English cricket for me to
retire,'' said Gooch. ''Others now have to take on the mantle of senior
players.''
Thorpe and Crawley tried to take on the mantle of senior players on
the penultimate day of the fourth Test, and succeeded well enough to
keep the game alive.
Like new Australian hero Greg Blewett, Thorpe had scored a century on
his debut by making 114 against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1993.
Since then the Surrey left-hander has passed 50 nine other times but
has been unable to convert any of those innings into three figures.
Yesterday, unfortunately, was no exception. Having stormed to 83 off
117 balls, Thorpe overdosed on pure adrenalin, driving Craig McDermott
straight to point soon after having hooked the fast bowler for his tenth
boundary. But without Thorpe's aggression England might have been
already down -- and all out by the close.
Mike Atherton, Gatting, and Gooch had fallen by the wayside and, at 83
for three, England were only 17 runs ahead. Thorpe's stand of 71 with
Crawley launched a fighting recovery which the latter continued after
three more wickets went in quick succession.
Crawley most certainly was not at his best. But he slugged it out for
almost three hours and finished with an undefeated 49 as England reached
220 for six by close -- a lead of 154, which rose to 262 today when
England were all out for 328 with 28 minutes to play before lunch.
By that time Crawley had departed for 71 and DeFreitas had amassed a
spectacular 88 off 95 balls. With the match in the balance, Australia
had a minimum of 67 overs to reach their target.
* IAN Salisbury will be fighting for his immediate international
future when England A resume their see-saw second Test battle with India
A in Calcutta today.
Leg-spinner Salisbury was given just four overs by his captain, Alan
Wells, as India A, facing a deficit of 100, hit back by reaching 204 for
two in their second innings by close of the third day.

TERRY HANDS'S first production at the National turns out to be a
warm-hearted, pleasantly amusing, if traditional, affair that would not
go amiss on the stages of the Barbican or at Stratford. Three-quarters
of the cast are drawn from the RSC's ranks, including a host of
indispensable character actors in the small supporting roles without
whom no Shakespeare production can hope to have any degree of life.
Thanks to them this production certainly has that. Terry Hands,
though, also admirably evokes the busy reality of Elizabethan Windsor in
the midst of Hallowe'en celebrations. Framed within Timothy O'Brien's
gorgeous russet and gold tree-lined set, all of village life is
here.Somehow it makes you realise just how much we have lost of local
traditions and customs and also gives the production a marvellous sweep.
I can't remember when the Olivier Theatre's wide expanses were better
used.
For all that, Hands's Merry Wives is slow into its stride. A play of
pranks and practical jokes, it's a comedy of class and social
aspirations -- especially the burgeoning middle class -- with old Sir
John Falstaff's amorous adventures with Mistresses Page and Ford at the
heart of it.
Unfortunately, Dennis Quilley never quite fills the dimensions of this
rumbustious, larger-than-life rogue and the real meat of the evening has
to come from Richard McCabe's puritanical, fanatically jealous Ford and
two hysterically comic cameos from Tim Wylton as Dr Caius, a French
quack, and Alan David as Sir Hugh Evans, the loquacious Welsh
parson/schoolmaster.

IT'S a predictably dark Barrowland that awaits Siouxsie and the
Banshees: dimly lit, an audience dressed almost exclusively in black,
with various movie sound tracks playing quietly in the background.
The bleakness of the scene is only added to by a closer inspection of
the audience, where a few sad punks (yes, there are at least 20 in the
audience) mix with the more prevalent trappings of eighties' gothdom --
lace, hair laquer, and snakebites. If ever a band were shackled by their
own history it is Siouxsie and the Banshees.
Musically this is unfair. Over the years there has been much evidence
of a band trying to stretch itself, even if they look the same as you
remember them from these occasional forays on to Top of the Pops --
Steve Severin the intense counter to Siouxsie's manic, arm-flailing
movements.
All their trademark sounds are to the fore: chopping guitars and
driving bass lines, Siouxsie's sometimes grating, sometimes soaring
voice, and innumerable lyrical references to sickness, falling, and
shadows.
However, there is also much to set them apart from the movements by
which they have been embraced. Siouxsie is able to write classic pop
songs like Peek a Boo, Killing Jar, and the Batman theme, Face to Face.
There is also the invention which sees the introduction of cello and
accordion, giving a refined Brechtian feel to some of the songs, with
the singer as a sort of post-punk Mariane Faithful.
While O Baby is one of their finest singles for some time, there is
little evidence that its accompanying album, Rapture, is, like this
show, anything more than a reaffirmation for their loyal, hardcore fans,
by a band unlikely to achieve either the recognition they deserve or the
popular approval that their encore version of Dear Prudence gave them
some 10 years ago.

AMONG the wonders in James MacMillan's recent orchestral output, I
find his piano concerto, subtitled The Berserking, the toughest to take.
The relentless, blinding fury of its first movement is numbing. Pianist
and orchestra trade blows like a couple of heavyweights, though this is
the exact musical metaphor for the image the composer has in mind.
I have real problems with the slow movement, which seems long and
rhapsodic for a composer whose strength lies in a combination of direct
utterance and well-organised structure. The finale, with its hectic
toccata and bravado march, works better, while the close, with the
piano, harp, and celeste -- all energy spent -- lost in a gentle, misty,
Celtic fantasy, is sheer beauty.
Peter Donohoe, the concerto's champion since day one, and a powerful
exponent, together with the Royal SNO giving it laldy under conductor
Markus Stenz, gave a committed performance as gentle in appropriate
moments as it was violent in others. Maybe I just haven't twigged the
piece yet: I'll soon have the opportunity; they recorded it yesterday.
Markus Stenz, while a specialist in contemporary music, seemed less at
ease in the mainstream. Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel went by without
panache or character. As for Brahms's Second Symphony; while the
performance was enthusiastically received by the audience, I'm almost
inclined to suggest it was a waste of space. It was bland, completely
lacking weight, richness, and gravitas. It was often untidy, needing
tighter control. And it wholly lacked direction and dramatic
accumulation. In short, a skite.

Lesley Stevenson finds drama in Scotland's contribution to the Royal
Academy's Poussin exhibition
NICOLAS POUSSIN has often been described as the father of French
painting, although he worked for most of his adult life in Rome, except
for a short and unhappy trip to France to work for Louis XIII.
In Rome his work was produced for a small circle of collectors who
found in Poussin's paintings the perfect embodiment of the classical
ideal. The Rome of the Counter-Reformation largely passed him by, except
for the important public commission, The Martyrdom of Saint Erasmus,
painted in 1628-9 for an altar in St Peter's.
The gruesome subject-matter of the early Christian saint who had his
intestines ripped out was meant to remind the faithful of the trials of
the early Church. Isolated in a room to itself -- and quite different
from his other, smaller paintings -- it is the first painting in a major
exhibition, brought to the Royal Academy from Paris, which celebrates
the 400th anniversary of the artist's birth in 1594.
Poussin's appeal is often difficult to identify today. He has none of
the easy accessibility of later French painters and many of the subjects
are difficult fully to appreciate without a classical and religious
education. Take The Judgment of Solomon, the work Poussin himself
regarded as his greatest. It depicts the moment when King Solomon was
called upon to adjudicate in the fight between two mothers, who each
claimed that a living child belonged to her, and a dead child to her
rival.
Poussin has represented the moment when Solomon has just decreed that
the wriggling infant be cut in half and divided between the two women
and a soldier holds his sword aloft, causing the real mother to
relinquish all claims to her child rather than have it killed. What
passes itself off as a single moment in time is in fact a highly complex
narrative frozen into a static whole.
Perhaps it is the melodrama that does not endear it to a modern
audience, with characters sharply differentiated with exaggerated
gestures and expressions. Or perhaps it is the theatricality of the
scene, with the characters lined up in rigidly symmetrical lines. But
then that notion of balance is what the story is about, and the
schematic characterisation helps to underline the moral message of the
work.
Other paintings are easier to grasp and enjoy and some of the
landscapes are breathtaking. Works like The Triumph of Neptune reveal
such a rich sense of colour and design that an ability to identify all
the characters becomes less important.
Poussin himself recognised that his works had to be read rather than
simply looked at and that involved demands on the viewer. The series of
Seven Sacraments painted between 1644-48, from the National Gallery of
Scotland, on loan from the Duke of Sutherland, were displayed by their
original owner with curtains hanging in front of them.
The idea was that each work could be contemplated in turn and this
method has been sympathetically recreated at the Royal Academy by having
a single room devoted to this set of sacraments, with plenty of space
between them.
The Edinburgh sacraments are reunited with an earlier set from the
1630s and perfectly reflect the antiquarian interests of Poussin's
patrons. Rather than treating the sacraments as devotional images,
Poussin has treated them as stories set within an antique setting, with
great attention given to historical accuracy in the characters'
clothing, the interior settings, and even the rituals enacted.
Penance, for example, is represented by the biblical story of Christ
at the feast in the house of Simon, faithfully recreated as an ancient
Roman scene, with dinner guests reclining on couches. The other dining
scene, Eucharist, depicts the Last Supper with Christ and the disciples
starkly illuminated against an imagined antique interior, and the
dramatically lit Judas disappearing off to the left.
In a work like this the theatricality of the work, and the lighting,
heighten the meaning of the story. By attempting this kind of historical
accuracy, Poussin's work was simultaneously different and more modern
than that of his contemporaries, but it was also more universal and
relevant in its appeal.
* The Nicolas Poussin exhibition runs at the Royal Academy of Arts,
London, to April 9.

COVE Rangers' Scottish Cup dream may be over for another season, but
when it comes to Highland hospitality, they take a bit of beating.
''It is unbelievable,'' said Dunfermline manager Bert Paton, whose
side made their generous hosts suffer a 4-0 defeat. That generosity had
extended on to the park, as the Fifers were allowed to knock in three of
those goals in the first 23 minutes.
But Cove knew Dunfermline were coming, so they baked a cake. And as
Paton said yesterday: ''It is a cake to commemorate our visit and it's
so nice, it is still at East End Park untouched. The boys want their
picture taken next to it. Then, I've no doubt, it will be enjoyed to the
full.''
Paton added: ''As for food, we were snowed under. The amount of
sandwiches, sausage rolls and so on they gave us for the return journey
was immense.''
Here endeth the happy note for two strikers -- Stewart Petrie, of
Dunfermline, and Cove's Mike Megginson.
You would think that scoring twice, taking his tally to the season to
21, and equalling his record with his previous club, Forfar, would
satisfy the management, as well as Petrie himself.
Wrong. Paton has the Fife habit of saying what he thinks -- and he
thinks that Petrie should have scored four or five. He said: ''Strikers
should be selfish. Once you have scored a couple, no-one should get the
ball off you. I was annoyed that, with us 4-0 up at half-time, Stewart
did not get any more. Only he knows why.''
Back to Cove and the unfortunate Megginson, who was carried off late
in the first half with a broken left ankle. There had been no-one near
him as he tried to prevent the ball going for a throw-in. As manager
Kenny Taylor said: ''He went over the ankle as he skidded off the pitch
and then hit a hoarding.''
The 31-year-old Megginson, at Cove for around six years, had an
operation to have a plate inserted in the ankle, which had one break
plus a dislocation,and will be out for the season.
For the record, the other scorers were Paul Smith and Andy Hawkins.
Ray Charles, in the Cove goal, gave a magnificent display to keep the
score down, especially in the second half.
An away draw against either Airdrie or Stirling Albion in the next
round also has its share of interest for the Fifers. Airdrie beat
Dunfermline after a replay in the third round last season, and in the
league, Albion took full points off the Fifers at Forthbank, not even
conceding a goal in the process.

ST Mirren's Jimmy Bone has not had his troubles to seek this season,
and Saturday's Scottish Cup defeat by Celtic at Hampden means his
youngsters haven't won since beating Stranraer on Boxing Day.
But the Love Street manager insists there is no turning back.
''St Mirren are not a patch on what they were in the past,'' he said.
''But we have good young players here and there is another layer below
the ones who played against Celtic.
''If you start a youth policy and start signing players who are
14-years-old, it takes seven years until they are playing regularly in
the first team.
''When I came here we were fortunate in that we had one or two in
place who were 17 and 18, so I set a five-year plan, and we are only
halfway through that.
''A lot of money has been poured down the drain since they made their
last cup appearance at Hampden and the club doesn't have the cash it had
in past years.
''There is no point in us changing in midstream and going back to the
start, because we can't afford that. But I have no doubt we will turn
things around, because we have a fair bit of quality here.
''I know the supporters want a winning team and I know they are
frustrated, but if they want a good side they must be patient.
''We could be doing a bit better in the league and there are different
reasons for it, but we'll climb the table before the end of the
season.''
Saints were boosted by the return of experienced keeper Campbell
Money, who had not played since facing Rangers Reserves on December 13,
and defender Robert Dawson. Both were outstanding.
''I thoroughly enjoyed playing on the big stage again,'' said Money.
''But the bottom line is we were beaten and are out of the cup.''
Saints were unfortunate they lost young Ricky Gillies after 38 minutes
with a suspected broken ankle. Along with Barry Lavety, he had been
giving the Celtic defence a few minor problems. After having been taken
to hospital it was discovered he had ligament damage and will be out for
at least three weeks.

J ROTHSCHILD Assurance achieved strong growth last year despite being
fined #100,000 by the industry watchdog Lautro for inadequate compliance
procedures. Total new business in the year rose by 17% to #70.6m helped
in particular by strong growth (88%) in unit trust sales. Total group
funds under management jumped by 45% to just over #1000m.
Mike Wilson, group chief executive of J Rothschild Assurance, said
that the results were an endorsement of the group's policy of being
represented only by experienced financial advisers and demonstrated the
benefits of using three independent fund managers.
In April, the company plans to launch an integrated life assurance,
banking and investment programme. This will bring together the company's
range of life assurance, pension and investment plans and a full 24-hour
telephone banking service from Citibank.

NEWS that Tiny Rowland is interested in buying back The Observer less
than two years after selling it to the Guardian Media Group (GMG) is
surprising given the continued losses which the paper is continuing to
make both financially and in readership.
However, having been ousted last November from the board of Lonrho
after a 33-year reign, it is perhaps not so surprising that Mr Rowland
is missing not being in the limelight.
GMG's board is expected to consider the #30m bid for The Observer at a
board meeting within the next fortnight, although it has not put the
paper up for sale. Lonrho sold The Observer to the owners of The
Guardian newspaper for almost #27m in May 1993 after it had accumulated
losses of #37m in three years. Mr Rowland has since expressed his regret
that the paper was sold.
However, he would face a difficult battle in reviving the fortunes of
The Observer. It is currently trailing well behind its major rivals in
the quality Sunday newspaper market with circulation thought to be below
the 500,000 at the time of The Guardian's takeover. The Guardian itself
approached the ailing Independent on Sunday last year with a view to
merging it with The Observer.
The quality Sunday market has for three decades been dominated by the
Sunday Times. There has been a widening gap between the Sunday Times and
its competitors since the mid-1980s. It outsells its nearest rival, The
Sunday Telegraph, by two to one. Almost two-thirds of Sunday Times
readers are under the age of 35.
The cover price war which has raged in the daily newspaper market,
initiated by Rupert Murdoch's News International Corporation which owns
the market-leading Sunday Times and The Sun, has not spilled over into
the Sunday newspaper market. News International has over one-third of
both the daily and Sunday markets.
It is just as well that the cover prices of Sunday appears have not
been cut because the Sunday market has been losing circulation even more
rapidly than the dailies since the 1980s. Between 1978 and 1993, the
circulation of Sunday papers declined by 16% compared with a 7% drop in
daily sales.
However, within the circulation figures there are differing
performances depending on whether the paper is mid or up-market.
Up-market Sundays have seen a marginal decline since 1978, and are 20%
down on the 1980 peak despite the launch of the Independent On Sunday.
While overt cover price wars have not yet become a feature of the
Sunday market, promotions such as the ability to buy The Times and The
Sunday Times for #1 do show that there is pricing pressure even in this
sector of the market. Against this competitive trading background
further restructuring of the Sunday newspaper market with the loss of
one title cannot be ruled out.
All newspapers, whether daily or Sunday, have to fight hard to retain
readers at a time of increasing competition from electronic media,
particularly cable and satellite television, and other forms of leisure
activity such as shopping. The challenges facing the newspaper industry
in the future include economic, technological and regulatory aspects.
The newspaper industry has been written off in the past as television
has grown in its dominance but it is still a large industry with gross
turnover of #5400m in 1993. City analysts believe that newspapers can
compete in the communications industry during the next decade by
promoting their information and opinion role and by exploiting their
databases.
Given the demographic trend towards an ageing population and the
predicted decline in the rate of household growth, it is thought that
newspapers will have a better chance to increase household penetration
in the 1990s than at any time since 1970.

THERE is a cheeriness about Parkhead people these days. The team is
not exactly inducing ecstasy, there is a long way to go before a trophy
can be won, and the best league position they can aspire towards this
year is second-top, many lengths behind Rangers. But deep inside the
Celtic psyche can be detected a genuine optimism.
That is one fascinating new development which the share issue's
success has spawned, and it gives the management a base from which they
have a real chance of going places.
They didn't get too excited about the 2-0 win over St Mirren at
Hampden but at least it keeps their Tennents Scottish Cup hopes alive
and, with due respect to either Meadowbank Thistle or Berwick Rangers,
they look set for the quarter-finals. When he buys another player, maybe
even in time for the next round, Tommy Burns knows that this, too, will
keep the new wave of hope rolling along but there are also one or two
signs that the men in place at the moment are beginning to thrive under
the canopy of stability that is being constructed.
Brian O'Neil, for instance, was quite outstanding against Saints, just
as he has been for most of the season. The young defender was close to
leaving the club when the manager bought Phil O'Donnell, thus almost
erasing his chances of a place in the team. Nor was O'Neil very excited
about playing in the heart of defence.
Yet, he has now played 17 times this season, almost all of them in
defence, and is beginning to look unmovable. O'Neil's natural ball
skills and heading ability combine to make him a formidable opponent in
the centre of the defence, where he could well be set for a long and
profitable career.
At 22, O'Neil has found his niche in a side that is already sporting
one or two men younger than him. Brian McLaughlin and Stuart Gray, in
particular, have established regular places and, although they have a
lot to prove, they have shown themselves capable of living in the top
division.
Gray, like O'Neil, got his chance in a position he would have
considered alien. Another midfield man, he has found his role at left
back has lasted longer than even he might have imagined but he looks
more and more comfortable with it as the weeks go by.
McLaughlin has the toughest task of the up-and-coming brigade in that
he will constantly have to demonstrate enough skill to offset his
stature. Wee men always have had to cope with that perceived
disadvantage but in the modern game there are even more physical demands
than in the past. However, McLaughlin is coping well enough with that
aspect of his task, showing no indication that the big guys intimidate
him.
He admits that his problem is more straightforward and was identified
by the manager as a weakness with his final pass. McLaughlin can wriggle
past opponents with ease, can run intelligently into space, and can
clear room for his cross. But the last bit is not always right --
crosses and passes sometimes go too near the keeper or are not struck
with authority.
McLaughlin, none the less, was effective, especially in the second
half, when he took it upon himself to go looking for the ball. He can be
a real problem for defences when he probes through the centre of the
park seeking openings, and less well-drilled sides than Saints will find
his meanderings very disconcerting.
Jimmy Bone's Saints were a credit to the manager after the drubbing
they had suffered against St Johnstone the previous week. It was
essential for morale at Paisley that they did not get walloped again and
they never looked in serious danger of that. Campbell Money, who
returned to goal, had some splendid saves, two especially from
McLaughlin and Tommy Boyd, but was assisted by a sound defence, with
Norrie McWhirter outstanding.
He and his colleagues gave Pierre van Hooydonk little chance to shine,
although the Dutchman made some impact in the second half. The big
striker's presence undoubtedly has helped Willie Falconer, who once
again did well as his partner. Falconer scored the first goal with a
header from a Boyd cross and later, when his scrambled header from a
John Collins free kick was deflected across goal, the Dutchman was there
to knock the ball over the line.
Hooydonk will score more spectacular goals -- he already has -- but
Burns made the valid point that one of Celtic's failings had been
finding someone to pounce on deflections and suchlike in front of goal.
The shareholders have done theirs, too. The 28,449 was Celtic's
biggest home crowd since October, when they met Rangers in the league.

SCOTTISH trainers were in the money at Ayr on Saturday, winning the
three richest races and demonstrating that small stables can hold their
own with the big boys from south of the Border.
On a day when all the favourites floundered in the mud,
Scottish-trained horses confounded the pundits by winning the first five
races and finishing second in the two others.
With BBC television cameras at the course for the first time in 17
years, Scottish racing was in the national spotlight, and
locally-trained horses coped best on the rain-soaked ground.
The richest prize of the day, the #12,000 Mason Organisation Novices'
Chase, went to Len Lungo's Sheelin Lad, a 15-2 chance, who should have
run in a maiden race at Wednesday's abandoned Sedgefield meeting.
Brave Buccaneer and Uron V from Mary Reveley's in-form yard were
strongly fancied, but jumping is the name of the game and they blundered
away their chances early on.
Apart from a heart-stopping moment when he almost unseated jockey Tim
Reed at the last, Sheelin Lad jumped well, running on to beat Ninfa, the
2-1 favourite, by a length-and-a-half. Only four of the 11 runners who
started the race finished.
Donald Whillans, the Hawick-based permit-holder, in only his second
season, won his biggest prize to date when Barney Rubble (5-1)
tenaciously outstayed his rivals in the #10,000 Harcross Handicap Chase.
A winner twice already, the home-bred 10-year-old led throughout and
had six lengths to spare at the finish.
Peter Monteith maintained his lead in The Herald Scottish Trainers'
Championship race when Aragon Ayr (8-1) held on by a neck to win the
Stanley Leisure Hurdle.
Leased by a group of 35 Kelso members, Aragon Ayr won this race a year
ago. Monteith regards him highly and plans to run the gelding in the
Morebattle Hurdle at Kelso on Friday.
If he performs well, Aragon Ayr could go to Cheltenham for the County
Hurdle at the Festival meeting, which Monteith won last year with the
ill-fated Dizzy.
Despite carrying top weight, Lungo's Forbidden Time was well backed to
win the opening novices hurdle, but in the heavy going he failed to give
10lb to Colin Parker's Sparky Gayle (100-30), who beat him by 20
lengths.
Tom Dyer's Explore Mondial started favourite for the selling hurdle,
but it was Jim Goldie's Nicholas Plant (7-1) who triumphed, with
Monteith's Nawtinookey (25-1) a length away.
* CHAMPION hurdler Flakey Dove was reported ''as good as ever''
yesterday by trainer Richard Price, who put her modest display on
Saturday down to being in season.
The mare was beaten around 19 lengths behind Mudahim in the Cleeve
Hurdle at Cheltenham, for which she started second favourite.
''I was disappointed with her performance,'' said the trainer, ''but
when I watched it on video I couldn't believe how well she was going two
out. But when asked for an effort, she found nothing. I do not blame the
ground and after the race we found that she was in season.''

Manila,
FRED Couples' second European Tour victory in a fortnight in the
Johnnie Walker Classic at the Orchard Club yesterday made his reputation
for being a couch potato look slightly ridiculous.
The former US Master's champion's ''have clubs, will travel''
philosophy is in refreshing contrast to that of most of his compatriots
and he has deservedly gathered in his rewards.
A two-stroke victory from Colin Montgomerie in the Desert Classic in
Dubai earned him #75,000 and he won again in the Philippines after a
closing 71 left him 11 under par on 277, this time by two from Open
champion Nick Price, who tied third in the Gulf, to pick up another
#100,000 and leave him high and dry at the top of the European money
list.
For Couples, the money, while not to be sniffed at, is of relatively
small importance, for he pocketed around #1m in November and December in
unofficial events.
World No.1 Price says of him: ''It would be easy for him to stay at
home and put his feet up but he wants to be an international player and
he's proved a great traveller. If he's a couch potato I'd like to become
one myself.''
Couples, now high and dry at the top of the European money list, heads
home for a well earned rest before launching his bid to retain his Ryder
Cup place at Oakhill New York in September and make amends for a
disappointing 1994, when he won only $600,000 on his home tour.
Price birdied the last for a 70, 279, and a #66,660 prize that leaves
him in second place in the money list ahead of Colin Montgomerie
(#68,000).
Young Australian Open champion Robert Allenby's 71 for 280 squeezed
him into third place ahead of Scotland's Andrew Coltart, who took 6 at
the last for 70, defending champion Greg Norman (69), and New Zealand's
Michael Campbell.
Coltart, who missed the cut in Dubai, was left to rue the way he
finished three of his four rounds in Manila. Yesterday's 6 at the last
was a repeat of his first round and he bogeyed the last three holes in
round two. But the way, in partnership with Price, he unleashed four
birdies in the first seven holes, including two 2s to be out in 32, was
hugely impressive. The Open champion remarked: ''He's strong and solid
and never backed off.''
Coltart, who chipped in at the sixteenth for a third 2, sadly took 4
at the short twelfth, where he over-compensated for the new sand in a
bunker and splashed out over the green, and 5 at the fifteenth, after
his ball bounced through the green, before taking four to reach the
putting surface after tangling with the rough at the last.
He won #25,466 to help him on his way to a Ryder Cup baptism in
September.
Montgomerie, after two front nine birdies edged him eight under par
and within two strokes of the lead, took 39 home with a 6 at the last
for 74 and seventh place.
South African David Frost, twelfth in the world rankings, shot 69 to
finish two under par, but South African Ernie Els (sixth) ended with a
71 at seven-over-par 295 and Severiano Ballesteros (thirteenth) endured
a disappointing first week back on tour to close with a 76 for 296.

Arizona,
VIJAY Singh, 31, the lean, bespectacled Fijian who won the
Scandinavian Masters and the Lancome Trophy last year, claimed the
Phoenix Open title and $234,000 prize by beating American Billy Mayfair,
28, at the first extra hole after both had tied with final rounds of 66
for 72-hole totals of 15-under-par 269.
They marched off to the 438-yard eighteenth and Singh won with a solid
par 4 after Mayfair had taken three putts. It was Singh's second US Tour
victory. He won the 1993 Buick Classic and has now passed the $1m mark
in American earnings.
He and Mayfair duelled from the turn which both had reached in 32 and
there was little prospect of anyone catching them.
Mayfair edged ahead, but Singh caught him with a birdie at the
seventeenth. Mayfair hit a bunker shot dead at the last to force the
play-off.
Earlier, Nick Faldo, who had driven and putted poorly for a 76 on
Saturday, a card which startled some of the record 120,000 crowd,
started to put things together in a 67, but David Feherty could manage
only an even par 71. Leading scores (American unless stated):
269 -- V Singh (Fiji) 70, 67, 66, 66; B Mayfair 69, 67, 67, 66 (Singh
won at first extra hole).
271 -- B Crenshaw 68, 64, 70, 69.
272 -- B Lietzke 72, 65, 69, 66: P Stewart 71, 68, 67, 66; S Jones 68,
69, 68, 67.
273 -- H Irwin 66, 66, 72, 69; M Calcaveccia 72, 67, 66, 68; J Ozaki
(Japan) 68. 71; 67, 67.
274 -- T Watson 67, 67, 71, 69; D Hammond 70, 68, 68, 68; S Stricker
70, 68, 67, 69; T Purtzer 69, 68, 69, 68; J Carter 70, 64, 73, 67.
Other scores included: 276 -- P Azinger 72, 68, 69, 67. 278 -- P
Mickelson 70, 66, 70, 72. 279 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 73, 66, 69, 71.

THE bid fever that was swirling around the City last week may carry on
with shares in Manweb, the North-west England regional electricity
company (REC), expected to open higher this morning. Speculation centres
on a possible bid for the company by the acquisitive privatised utility
Welsh Water.
Just under a quarter of Welsh Water's sales comes from non-core
activities. Up until now it has chosen to focus on developing its
engineering and environmental services activities, although it has also
invested in hotels.
Last month, Manweb reported a 40% increase in its interim dividend
despite a sharp decline in its profits and turnover. The result was
struck after exceptional costs including a #21.3m restructuring
provision.
The electricity sector was thrown into the spotlight following the
launch last month of Trafalgar House's hostile bid for Northern
Electric. While the logic of the Trafalgar bid has been questioned there
are undoubtedly synergies between rival privatised utilities.
Industry mergers would lead to savings of tens of millions of pounds
from subsequent rationalisation in areas such as billing and head office
staff.

IT MIGHT have been scripted that Clyde's new home at Broadwood Stadium
should next week welcome holders Dundee United as its first Scottish Cup
visitors.
What is less likely to have been planned is the distinct possibility
that the present custodians of the silverware just may lose their grip
on the trophy.
True, Ivan Golac's United ought to have been booking their coach north
for a fourth-round meeting with Highland League side Huntly instead of
planning for a replay following Saturday's Tannadice stalemate.
The fact is that while opportunities were created by the hatful,
United failed to take even one of them, and have therefore left
themselves open for punishment at the hands of a Bully Wee outfit simply
bursting to provide themselves with a major cup boost.
While Golac was left pondering an array of lost opportunities, his
counterpart, Alex Smith, was revelling in the kind of display from his
rank outsiders that ought to gladden Clyde hearts for the future.
Such was the promise of Clyde's youngsters on a premier division stage
that United found themselves struggling to contain their enthusiastic
visitors' hit-on-the-break format, in which winger John Dickson was a
revelation.
The 25-year-old's cut and thrust wide on either flank created problems
thoughout for a home rearguard which, if truth be told, ought to have
been spending their time in criticism of those at the sharp end of
United's line-up.
Golac said it all on the subject of his side's finishing department.
''We could have played for a week and still not managed to put the ball
into the back of the net. What amazes me is that it is just a week ago
that we netted six goals against Motherwell.''
The looks of disbelief on the faces of some of the home finishers
mirrored feelings which spread like wildfire through the home support,
and the fans were not slow to react to what was at times a series of
embarrassments.
But while several of the hosts wasted gilt-edged scoring chances in
the tie, it would be remiss to ignore the outstanding contributions made
to Saturday's stalemate by visiting keeper Les Fridge and his defensive
mates.
The former St Mirren man's handling was of the highest order as he
time and again broke the hearts of his hosts with save after save of
quality.
One would think that his five-star display would more than make up for
the nightmare he suffered at the same Tannadice venue almost four years
ago to the day. Fridge was rushed to hospital following a clash with the
then United player Darren Jackson, and spent a week -- and four
operations -- prior to recovering over a four-month period.
* PARIS St Germain, the French champions, virtually lost any chance of
getting back into this season's title race when they were beaten 2-1 in
Monaco yesterday.
A late goal from striker Michael Madar sent the men from the capital
spinning to their sixth league defeat of the season and left them 10
points adrift of leaders Nantes.
But the Parisians, who had Daniel Bravo sent off 10 minutes after the
interval, earned the chance to grab a late equaliser when they were
awarded a penalty four minutes from the end.
However, Brazilian defender Ricardo hit the spot-kick too close to
keeper Fabien Piveteau, and Monaco took the points.

FORTUNE and Fame lived up to his billing as odds-on favourite for the
Europe Champion Hurdle at Fairyhouse yesterday with a fine performance
in the hands of Mark Dwyer.
The jockey always looked confident, producing the favourite between
Clifton Fog and Aries Girl at the last flight for what proved a
comfortable success.
Aries Girl, hitherto unbeaten over hurdles and now a 4-1 chance for
the Sun Alliance Hurdle at Cheltenham, was outjumped by Fortune and Fame
at the last but galloped on well to finish second.
Trainer Dermot Weld was satisfied with the winner, who was tightened
up by the ante-post layers for the Smurfit Champion Hurdle at the
Festival in March.
''This was the kind of victory we had hoped for,'' said Weld. ''He
will obviously be better for the run and I will be entering him for the
Kingwell Hurdle at Wincanton on February 23 if I feel he needs another
run before the Festival.''

MIXED signals on inflation in the UK economy continue to be sent.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will no doubt take comfort
from the fact that less than 16% of UK businesses are likely to give
their workers above-inflation pay rises this year.
These findings are published today in a new survey of expected wage
increases and employment prospects by Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, the business
information group.
However, the picture differs across the country. Scotland has one of
the highest proportions of businesses (16%) which expect to give their
employees pay rises above the rate of inflation.
According to the survey more than a quarter of employees (27%) should
expect pay rises of between 1% and 2% and nearly half (48%) should
expect pay rises of between 2% and 4%. No firms in Scotland expect to
pay wage increases of over 6%.
However, on the downside, employment prospects do not look good with
14% of firms in Scotland expecting to lay off staff. This is higher than
the national average of 10% and may reflect the fact that the recession
was later in arriving in Scotland relative to many other parts of the
UK.
On a national basis, the survey found that small firms are much more
likely to expand their workforces. Small businesses with up to 50
employees were also found to be much more likely than larger businesses
-- with 250 or more staff -- to award pay increases of 4% or more.
About a fifth of employees in the wholesale and service sectors can
expect wage increases of over 4% compared with about a tenth of those
engaged in manufacturing, retailing and construction.
Although wages do not appear to be putting upward pressure on
inflation other factors are. The Goldman Sachs' leading indicators of
inflation devised by economist David Walton have been rising for some
time. Six of the 11 components in the longer leading indicator -- M0,
commodity prices, vacancies, retail sales, shortages of skilled labour
and shortages of physical capacity -- are boosting the index with the
remaining indicators pointing in the opposite direction.
Mr Walton believes that until the longer leading indicator turns down
decisively, the trend in base rates is likely to remain upwards.

WILLIE Miller's patience with his strikers finally ran out on
Saturday, and he made it clear that it was time they started scoring
goals, a job for which they are handsomely paid.
After a frustrating performance he said he was fed up making excuses,
and their jobs were on the line. He took things out on the dressing-room
door, which had to be carried off, injured.
Stranraer made the journey of 226 miles -- and from the bottom of the
first division -- to Pittodrie to try to pull off a giant-killing
performance and reach the fourth round of the Scottish Cup.
This was their second cup-tie in Aberdeen this season and before the
match the talk was of how Stranraer keeper Steve Ross had played
outstandingly in August to keep the score to just 1-0 as they went out
of the Coca-Cola Cup.
There were 9183 fans in the ground on Saturday and, with the exception
of the small party of Stranraer supporters, they were expecting Aberdeen
to score a barrowload of goals. To their frustration, the score again
was 1-0 but keeper Ross, although he did pull off several good saves,
had far less work to do.
The Dons worked hard but there was no flair on display, and aimless
balls into the Stranraer box were to little effect.
As half-time approached, with the welcome prospect of a break from the
tedium, Eoin Jess brightened things up by playing a fine one-two with
Duncan Shearer, leaving marker Paul McLean on the deck and crashing the
ball home from 10 yards.
That should have boosted the Dons' confidence and forced Stranraer to
press forward into attack to try for at least a draw.
It did neither. Aberdeen continued to dominate with no further reward
and Stranraer waited until the last 10 minutes before they stepped up
the pressure.
The players left the pitch with the all-too-common boos of the crowd
following them to the dressing-room, where the Aberdeen lads heard even
more unpleasant noises from their manager.
''My patience is wearing thin with those who should be scoring
goals,'' he told the post-match press conference. ''I am fed up
constantly having to come in here to make excuses for them, saying we
should have scored two or three. We should have had 10 today and there
is no excuse for them to miss that number of chances.
Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie felt his team played with credit and
might even have stolen a draw in the latter stages, but he had some
advice for Aberdeen's supporters.
''If you want to compete with the Old Firm then you will have to
behave like the Old Firm's fans.'' He said that when Rangers or Celtic
were struggling, the fans helped them and that it was sad to hear the
Aberdeen support coming down on them.
''I treat our supporters as part of the team and would like to think
if we were going through a patch like Aberdeen, they would back us.
''But anyone who writes Aberdeen off would be silly.''

STAND by for the new Alternative Investment Market to be launched on
the Stock Exchange.
This will be the new market specially designed for smaller companies
whose shares have no quotation at present to raise money and for
investors to risk losing, while hoping to sharply increase theirs.
It has gone through most of the preparation and consultation necessary
and at the moment looks likely to open up for business in June or July,
round about the starting date envisaged when formal consultation began
back in September.
In many ways the new market -- already being referred to as AIM --
could be seen as ''Son of USM''. It will do much the same job as the
Unlisted Securities Market although on a smaller, even riskier scale.
The USM allowed more than 780 companies to come to the Stock Exchange
on conditions less rigorous than for entry into the full Official List,
significantly a shorter track record and the ability to allow the
shareholders to keep a larger slice of their cake than in a full
listing.
The paperwork was less onerous which naturally made it cheaper. Some
of the companies went bust but others prospered, made investors and
founding families richer and progressed on to a full listing or got
taken over.
The USM is now scheduled to close at the end of next year. Relaxations
in listing rules following changes in European Union Directives meant
entry to the full list was easier and the USM became regarded as
irrelevant. It has already stopped taking new companies on board.
The market is lasting longer than at one time thought likely but by
the time it goes into the history books most of the companies it brought
to investors would have joined the full list or dropped into the ''Rule
4.2 category,'' where they are already no doubt considering joining AIM.
Even with the easier entry requirements dictated by Brussels the full
list, while it can fulfil very efficiently the traditional role of
enabling expanding companies to raise additional capital, it still
requires the owners to allow significant outside shareholdings and that
means accepting the detailed reporting and other requirements which go
with that level of public involvement.
And the paperwork for a full listing is detailed and costly --
probably a minimum of #350,000 and more likely something of the order of
#500,000 for a company with a relatively modest capitalisation such as
#20m or so.
The new market is expected to have no formal lower limit on the size
of company to be admitted. There will, however, be certain practical
limits which means your single corner shop will not be featuring.
The crucial practical limitation is, inevitably for a market which
will have some regulation, even though it is deliberately going to be
light regulation, the initial paperwork.
Companies are expected to have to produce some sort of prospectus --
in contrast to those seeking dealings under Rule 4.2 -- the rule which
allows dealing in unquoted companies -- where Exchange approval is
likely to be given if the company can produce an audited set of accounts
and an annual report.
So what with one thing and another it seems likely that the costs
involved will be in the range of #50,000 to #100,000 which would seem to
point towards a minimum practical size of some #2m or so.
Companies are already being lined up for admission to AIM and some
fund managers are considering launching collective investment vehicles
allowing investors who want to ''have a go'' to spread the risk. Others,
however, are, for the moment at least, taking the view that the risks
will be too great.
One worry, in addition to the normal problem of analysts having enough
time to profitably keep tabs on a company where there is not likely to
be a great deal of share-dealing activity, is the amount and quality of
information. To get their quotation companies will have to provide a
prospectus which meets European requirements and agrees a supply audited
accounts complying with company law.
The directors will be told it is their responsibility to ensure that
the documents are accurate and they will have to agree to publish
promptly information regarded as price sensitive. But as part of the
conditions to keep costs down the Stock Exchange is not expected to take
on the job of vetting the documents. And although firms will need to
have some association with a stockbroker formal sponsorship by a broker
is not expected to be required.
Quoted small companies did well last year as they recovered from the
recession. But AIM will be made up of even smaller ones. ''Worrying
about the risk because these companies will be very small is just
stating the obvious,'' says Justin Urquhuart Stewart of Barclays
Stockbrokers. ''Small companies are risky but people will still want to
invest in them.''

GORDON Dalziel, who helped Raith Rovers to win the Coca-Cola Cup
literally by a nose -- his ''headed'' equaliser against Celtic at Ibrox
-- really put his foot in it this time as the Kirkcaldy side began their
campaign for a cup double.
A combination of stubborn Ayr United resistance and poor finishing by
Raith had restricted them to a Steven Crawford strike after 21 minutes.
Step in the Kirkcaldy king. The 32-year-old all-time top scorer at
Stark's Park -- he has 184 to his name in seven years -- sprinted
upfield after 80 minutes as Crawford broke down the right.
The cross was perfect, keeper Cammy Duncan was committed and beaten by
it. A simple tap into an open goal from eight yards was the right
recipe.
But the ball took on the appearance of a balloon -- which is how
Dalziel felt as well -- as it soared over the top of the bar and into
the night sky.
And how this extrovert will suffer for that one this week, especially
as Ayr United almost snatched a replay near the end, keeper Scott
Thomson blocking Brian Bilsland's close-in shot.
Let's listen to the man himself: ''That must be the miss of my career.
Even the YTS lads will be at me all week about that one. I think I need
four days off to recover.''
Manager Jimmy Nicholl: ''Four days off? Four days of practice more
likely. Normally, Gordon is one of the first out of the dressing room
after a game. He was still sitting there in his kit 15 minutes after the
final whistle. He knows he should have done better and scored at least a
couple.''
Raith showed all their old home failings: playing well at the start,
going ahead, and then failing to kill off the opposition. But Nicholl
was prepared to look on the positive side as well, especially since that
was Raith's seventh victory in a row.
''Don't forget our defence, who have shown they can do their job when
things are not going right up front. Also, this talk of us being cup
specialists is wrong.
''The only special thing about today is that we are still in the
competition and have an away tie against Dundee. Although it would have
been nice to be playing at Stark's Park, we're not worried about
travelling. We had to do it in the Coca-Cola Cup.''
Ayr manager Simon Stainrod, as well as being disappointed over his
side's lack of scoring in recent weeks, was unhappy with central
defenders John Sharples and Colin McFarlane. ''There was a distinct lack
of communication between them,'' he said.
The fact that both sides meet on league business at the same venue
next week has given the managers plenty to think about. For opposite
reasons, each club is desperate for the points -- Raith trying to get
even closer to Dundee at the top, and Ayr fighting to climb from the
bottom.

Clare Henry looks at the work of a departing artist in residence who
has helped townsfolk feel more at home
THE unsought link between public art and advanced driving: in
Stewartfield, East Kilbride, there were two cars doing spiral dressage
manoeuvres around each roundabout they came to. Fiona Dean was showing
me her work -- six sculptures on six roundabouts.
''Fiona has been a brilliant artist in residence,'' said Paul Eames,
the area's arts development officer. ''Over her two-year stay she took
the project far beyond the studio. She's a good advocate for the arts!''
To conclude her residency Dean presents an exhibition of her work from
1993/94 in the upstairs gallery which forms part of East Kilbride's new
#1.5m arts centre. Originally a private house, later council offices,
Bosfield House has been converted and extended to make a
state-of-the-art home for studios, recording studio, cafe, and small
theatre equipped for video and film.
''About 600 folk pass through a week. We are a down-to-earth operation
covering both local and top-range stuff. The centre provides 35 courses
and classes, employs about 20 artists and performers on a freelance
basis, and you can hire the darkroom or screenprinting studio for #6 for
a three-hour session,'' Eames told me.
Just before she began her residency, Dean visited Mexico. ''Travel has
been a big influence, but I didn't want to lift and insert some other
culture's icons or motifs into my work. Rather I wanted to develop my
own mythology.''
Some pictures have inscriptions like ''Have house . . . Will travel''
and ''My home . . . My castle.'' At the core of the show is the idea of
a journey -- but also the acknowledgement of a need to locate yourself;
the need of a symbolic hearth. We all take our homes for granted. Only
when away from them do we realise their importance.
Dean is primarily a sculptor and she began painting with tiny
narrative watercolours -- gentle, unforced, intimate sketches with
quirky detail and romantic hearts, keys, arrows, beacons, fires, and
samovars.
The acrylic paintings are louder, more colourful but less evocative. A
stay at a Russian print workshop in Tver (East Kilbride has USSR
business links) brought her into contact with Russian icons, and their
rich hues infiltrate her dramatic scenarios where everyday objects
change scale, becoming huge and architectural or, as in The Hidden Home,
tiny and precarious.
This also happens in her sculptures, where she plays with the triple
concepts of altar, home, and hill to make a solid, unassailable fortress
where a tiny house is tucked safely into a niche halfway up the slope,
or perched atop ramparts.
Dean's 1993 series are created from subtly shaded cement fondu. In
contrast her 1994 sculpture is brilliant sparkling white cement, made
from Scotland's only white sand from Loch Aline in Morven.
These ghostly sculptures are reminiscent of household furniture: a
bed, chair, chimney indented with nooks and crannies and topped with
plumes of fire. ''I see them as part domestic objects, part memorial.
The fire is there because it's central to any home but also as a
spiritual transitional presence.''
There is an element of doll's house in all this, though Dean manages
to avoid the twee or sentimental. For her piece de resistance she cuts
out massive sheets of steel, as though paper or card, to make the
all-time flat fold-out toy home, complete with chimney and cast bronze
heart.
Over the two years Dean also instigated and co-ordinated a major
public art project with the development corporation's landscape
architects. Dean's first roundabout steel piece, Mi Casa, was installed
in 1993, followed this year by five other pieces by Tobia, Parry, Pyke,
Donnelly, and McLoy.
However, as the East Kilbride Development Corporation is currently
winding down, there is no current artist in residence. ''It's a great
loss,'' said Eames. ''The benefits of an artist in residence far
outweigh the minimal cost. They are vital to our educational progamme
and I hope they will be reinstated fast.''

MORTON will be the happier outfit after Saturday's goalless draw at
Kilmarnock, and may well fancy their chances of reaching the fourth
round of the Tennents Scottish Cup when the teams meet again in tomorrow
night's replay.
Manager Allan McGraw would have regarded it as a winnable tie had they
been drawn at home to the premier division team first time round, and
ground advantage certainly gives the Greenock side some compensation for
the fact that Killie do have players of higher quality. But the question
is whether they can expect to find the Ayrshire team off form for a
second time.
Morton created some good scoring chances but survived the closest
shaves, particularly in the closing 10 minutes or so when they began to
tire. Despite the threat of Colin McKee operating on the left -- such as
when he crossed in 11 minutes and Mark Reilly hurriedly hit the ball
over the bar -- Kilmarnock had little to show for their efforts.
It changed in the closing stages, with the home side exerting
sustained pressure. Steve McCahill hooked a clearance over his own bar
and Tom Brown blazed over after a scramble precipitated by a David Wylie
fumble.
But it would have been harsh had Morton succumbed. Although their
Finns, Marko Rajamaki and Janne Lindberg, were slightly disappointing,
the strong running of man-of-the-match Derek Lilley and the industry of
veteran Rowan Alexander unsettled the Killie defenders.
The pair combined to harass the home defence midway in the first half
after a through ball had slowed up short of goalkeeper Dragoje Lekovic.
Another error let Lilley have a free shot from 15 yards, which he hit
wide, and he was presented with the ball again near the interval but his
cross was weakly struck wide by Alexander.
McCahill headed over from a Derek McInnes corner just before the hour
mark and, about 10 minutes later, a good Morton move ended with the ball
being cleared off the toe of Rajamaki. From then on, however, only
Killie looked capable of scoring.
Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten admitted that his side did not deserve
to win Saturday's first encounter.
''All credit to Morton. Allan McGraw has them playing good football.
We worked hard enough but it just didn't happen for us. However, we're
still in the cup.''
McGraw pointed out: ''We had the two best chances of the game --
Alexander and McCahill should have done better. But our attitude was
great. I'm delighted with my players and I'm sure they'll lift
themselves again for Tuesday.''
However, Paul Blair took a knock and is unlikely to be fit for the
replay. Killie will have defender Neil Whitworth available again but
McKee, who had to go off towards the end after having seemed to strain
himself, later went for an X-ray and must be doubtful for tomorrow.

John Linklater interviews actress Anne Lambton whose CV includes a
spell as pop artist Andy Warhol's bodyguard
THIS is how not to audition. The director phones. He leaves a message
on the machine. He has received recommendations about you. Would you
contact him? Chances are you would. But you are Anne Lambton. There were
too many distractions in your youth. You were a late starter. Informal
training involved busking on the street as a mime artist. Voice-training
was using English haughtiness to say ''No'' to guys pestering Andy
Warhol in New York. More effective than any heavy.
You listen to the voice of this director on the machine and you
decide, ''That's not the Philip Prowse of the Citizens' Theatre in
Glasgow. This is some creep I must have met at a party.'' You don't ring
back.
But this voice is on your machine again. A few days later your friend
Rupert Everett asks: Why won't you ring Philip back? You grovel. You
meet Prowse for lunch. He asks you to audition.
Your previous experience with auditions is so appalling that anything
you do or say now can't possibly make things worse.
Lambton: If I audition I'll never work at the Citizens'. Because I'm
very bad at auditioning. Wouldn't you just take me for a little part?
Prowse: Yes, okay.
Lambton: But, really I just can't audition. Couldn't you just give me
a little part -- and that'll be the audition?
Prowse: Yes. Okay.
Lambton: No, really I can't audition. I'm really bad at it.''
Prowse: Okay.
Lambton: Because, you see, I can't . . .
Prowse: OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
That was the way Anne Lambton started her first two seasons at the
Citizens'. Eight straight shows: A Woman Of No Importance, French
Knickers, She Stoops To Conquer, Judith, Blithe Spirit, The Spanish
Bawd, Friends And Lovers, and An Ideal Husband. When she did her
''audition'' with Philip Prowse she had only previously appeared in one
show as an Equity member. The only other theatre company for which she
has worked more than once is the Royal Shakespeare Company. Her return
to the Citz is for Prowse's production of Women Beware Women, opening
this week.
She had wanted to act from childhood, but her schooling proved a
progressive disaster. A member of the large family of Lord Lambton, with
homes in Northumberland and County Durham, she had been at a girls'
school in Sunderland before being unaccountably deposited in the French
Lycee in London. ''Not speaking any French I just sat there like a
goop,'' she says. The main product of this experience was stomach ulcers
and she was sent to another school in Switzerland. Finishing school? ''I
don't know, but it finished me. I ran away.''
She was 15. She had to break back in because she had forgotten her
passport. When they eventually caught up with her she returned to the
school to discovered that her only friend there had hung herself.
The third escape was the final one. When she got back home to England
her father was secretly proud. He would introduce her to people: ''This
is my daughter. She's run all the way from Switzerland, you know.''
There were a number of diversions over the next few years. Her job
description with Andy Warhol was bodyguard, but she thinks that ''court
jester'' would have been more accurate. Later she booked bands into
gigs. There was a cowboy in Oklahoma -- she still wears his horseshoe
ring -- but she decided she had either to leave him or become one of
these people bitter with frustrated ambition. She enrolled in drama
school in 1980.
It was hard to get started afterwards. At RSC auditions they turned
her down: ''They said I was too strong, but I think it was the voice.''
The voice is deep. Always has been. At the age of four she was lined
up with her four sisters and her grandfather asked what they wanted to
drink. An orange squash. A Ribena. A Coke. A bottle of Bass, please. The
basso profundo announcing this request became a family legend. ''I'd
never had a bottle of Bass before,'' says Anne. She continues to get
''Hello, Sir'' on the phone, and her nephews and nieces (there are 12)
all call her Uncle Anne. ''My voice does have a range,'' she confirms.
''It's just a range that ends where normal people's begins.''
Di Trevis was one of those who recommended Anne Lambton to Philip
Prowse. It was with Trevis that Anne had her first breakthrough in Miss
Julie at Westcliff Theatre. After the long sequence of work at the
Citizens' there was film and television work -- The Witches with Nick
Roeg and several episodes of The House Of Eliott for BBC.
She remains grateful to the Citz for what she perceives as a
continuing policy of casting ''strong women''. That must give the
''Beware'' of Thomas Middleton's title an additional resonance. The cast
also has Andrea Hart, Anne Myatt, and Victoria Scarborough.
Anne Lambton is playing Livia, the meatiest part she feels she has
confronted in a while: ''She's quite amoral. For the times she behaves
more like a man. It was a bit like being in purdah to be a woman then.
This amorality spreads around the whole play, and only two characters
survive.''
She thinks about this for a moment, and gives as a coy afterthought:
''I'm a bit to blame for most of it.''

AS a schoolboy, my musical cousin was asked by the careers officer
what he would like to do for a living. ''I want to be a conductor,'' was
his prompt reply. To this the careers officer issued the following
advice: ''You'd better write a letter to Strathclyde Transport then.''
Last night in an incredibly exciting performance of Gheorghe
Costinescu's The Musical Seminar, conductor Ewan Anderson began as a bus
conductor but quickly changed his uniform for a tail coat and injected
fabulous energy into this brilliant piece of music theatre.
Costinescu, an American-based Romanian composer, likes to think of his
masterpiece as an exploration of the musical phenomenon. This journey is
carried out by five musicians and four actors who play, sing, shout,
mime, and dance.
Director Paul Stebbings made the bold decision to include a part for
the composer on whose music the piece is based. Aided by three actors
playing the musical notes, the pyjama-clad composer enacts his nightmare
of trying to create an original score.
Having explored human phonetics (each musician has a speech impediment
appropriate to their instrument), they then embark on a whistle-stop
tour through the history of Western music in hilarious pastiches on
Brahms, Stockhausen, Mozart, Bartok, and Joplin, to name but a few.
This is another triumph for the Paragon Ensemble, who were on knockout
form throughout. The Musical Seminar tours to Edinburgh's St Brides
Centre on Thursday and Aberdeen's Lemon Tree on Sunday. See it.

THERE is a sad sight on the streets of London these days, and very
probably on the streets of every other town and city in the land because
such suffering is not something confined to those who live in London.
Huddled against the winter wind these urban outcasts cower in doorways,
seeking what shelter they can, frequently clad in the thinnest of
clothing, shoulders hunched, faces pale, pinched and desperate. You see
them, and then minutes later they have gone. But in no time at all
someone else has taken their place.
They are the new lepers -- smokers. What is so striking is that on
average they are young people. If they were elderly one would dismiss
them as wrinkly nicotine addicts who had failed to come to terms with
the brave new smokeless world in which we all must live. But they are
not.
Should any members of society be dispatched to haunt the streets like
this? The Health Education Authority says smoking is the greatest
preventable cause of death in the country and can lead to lung cancer,
respiratory disease and heart disease. Note the can, because the fact,
which everyone skates around, is that life leads to death, although
there are different ways of dying and death from lung cancer is not
among the more pleasant. This is an argument beset by ''can'' and
''likely to'' and ''estimated that'' into which an injection of ''will''
would do a lot of good.
Smoking, however, is on a decline. In 1992, the last year for which
figures are available, 29% of men and 28% of women smoked. In 1972 the
figures were 52% of men and 41% of women.
Anne Moody, Scottish representative of Forest, the campaign for the
right to enjoy smoking, and not, she insisted, a pro-smoking body, but a
freedom pressure group, said there was no scientific evidence to prove
there was a link between passive smoking and lung cancer. The British
Medical Association disagrees.
She added: ''We want defined areas in offices and the work place where
people can smoke. Many nurses smoke, people with stressful jobs do. Yet
hospitals not only do not allow smoking on the premises, but sometimes
in the hospital grounds. That can cause problems for a nurse coming off
her shift late at night. The situation has become hysterical. ''
She has a point. I passed one local authority old folk's home in
Brighton, which proudly boasted it was a no go area for smokers, to see
a carer standing on the street outside the perimeter wall, in the dark,
puffing away. She was a standing invitation to assault.
Irene Hamilton, the BMA's Scottish spokeswoman, said they believed the
risks of active smoking outweighed those due to passive smoking, but the
risks from passive smoking were greater than those posed by any other
indoor man-made pollutant.
Melinda Letts, chief executive of the National Asthma Campaign, urged
all firms to introduce workplace smoking bans. She said that passive
smoking at work was already a major problem for people with asthma.
Forest's answer to that is, that while asthma may be on the increase,
smoking is on the decline and you cannot blame that increase on
something on the decline. They want places set aside for smokers in the
workplace so that asthma sufferers should have no problem.
There are, of course, other airborne irritants, like diesel fumes and
unleaded petrol fumes, which can affect people who suffer from
respiratory problems. One report said research in Holland had shown
keeping budgerigars increased the risk of lung cancer by nearly seven
times, which would make the budgie in his corner cage over 30 times more
lethal than the passive smoker in the fireside chair. Believe it if you
will.
The point, of course, is that smoking may be bad for you, but so are
lots of other things. It is up to you to decide whether you wish to do
something that is bad for you. Whether what you are doing is bad for
somebody else is another matter. If it is, then you should not be
allowed to do it in their presence, to inflict it upon them.
Maternal smoking during pregnancy may cause asthma. It may not. What
the studies have shown, as Martyn Partridge of the NAC said in his
letter to the paper on Friday, is that it increased the risk. Forest
would argue that mothers who smoke should do so in the knowledge of the
possible effect of their actions, and that parents who breathe cigarette
fumes over their children are bad parents, a problem the Government
recognised last month when it launched a #13.5m anti-smoking campaign
aimed at parents whose habit puts their children at risk.
One result of the successful campaigning of the anti-smoking pressure
groups has been the ban on smoking in most public transport. On
ScotRail, as well as in the South-east of England and other suburban
rail services throughout England, there is no smoking allowed.
The decisions were taken in response to the campaign against smoking
on the grounds that the bulk of journeys were short, particularly on
suburban services, so it was no hardship to smoker travellers to wait
until they were off their train.
In the West of Scotland the ban, imposed in 1989 on 350 coaches, was
extended last month to the remaining 250. ScotRail director, Chris
Green, said it introduced a consistent policy across ScotRail and met
''the growing customer demand for no smoking on grounds of health and
hygiene.'' A recent poll had shown that a clear majority of passengers
supported the policy.
On Inter-City services, however, smoking carriages are still provided.
As for the future, if smokers are a commercially viable group of
travellers there is every chance, in the harsh new privatised world of
rail transport where bottoms on seats are what count, these policies
will be rethought.
While it is true that the air in a non-smoking carriage is cleaner to
breath, and for the non smoker a more pleasant place to be, that isn't
to say that the smoker should be dispatched to oblivion. What ScotRail
did not make clear was whether those polled had no objection to smoking
compartments, provided they were not forced to use them.
I don't smoke. I never have smoked, although I grew up at a time when
it was socially acceptable and the pressures to do so were considerable.
I am not upset by someone smoking in my presence. I am not taking sides.
But the sight of those people consigned to lurk on the sidewalk because
of a ban imposed by their employer and that employer's failure to then
provide somewhere suitable for them to indulge their habit is worrying.

WANTED: For serious crimes against the community, for pollution, for
causing accidents, for daring to avoid useless and unreliable public
transport, for using the roads he or she has paid to build . . . the
Motorist. If spotted, this dangerous criminal should, 1. have their
vehicle ticketed, 2. be fined on the spot, 3. have the car towed away,
4. be breathalysed at all times of the day and night.
REWARD: Anyone who can think of even more punishments for motorists
should write to the Labour Party, Lothian Regional Council, Parliament
Square, Edinburgh. A free picture poster of Tony Blair with every
suggestion accepted.
I jest not. Being a motorist in the city of Edinburgh is about as
enjoyable as sticking your wet finger into an electric socket or trading
banter with Eric Cantona.
The zealots on the regional highways committee, led on frenziedly by
one Councillor David Begg, an amiable enough fellow until you put your
key in the ignition, are out to make life hell for everyone on four
wheels. In the process they are strangling the commercial life out of
Scotland's capital but who cares about that?
It is politically incorrect to own a motor vehicle and utterly wicked
to use one. The New Labour Party, just like the old one, knows what is
best for you and driving it is not.
Thus great swathes of the city's road network has been transformed
into crooked country lanes. Part of the High Street is cobbled at
enormous expense; George 1V Bridge is narrowed.
In mighty Princes Street cars are banned from four of the six lanes;
soon they will be banished altogether. Pavements are so wide a jumbo jet
could land on them; sleeping policemen test your suspension, awake ones
film you at speed.
Some roads are just closed, full stop.
Edinburgh is the traffic light capital of the world. A little man from
the Highways Dept goes out at night with a bag of magic traffic light
seeds and every morning new ones sprout to life.
Parking is something your parents will tell you about some day. An
operater who dared to offer city centre spaces at a reasonable cost was
told to put his prices up pdq.
And all the time the traffic snarls to a tortoise pace and to go from
one side of the city to the other is a morning lost.
Councillor Begg has more wheezes in store. He announced last week that
he would like to see higher charges for residents' permits, fewer
evening spaces for public parking, charges for the first time for
Saturday afternoon meter spaces and more traffic wardens on patrol.
You might think that poorer people, the sort that may even vote for
Councillor Begg's party, would be most disadvantaged by increased
charges to park outside their own home. Hard chuck. Let them become
traffic wardens.
One might conclude that charging for meter parking on Saturday
afternoons is just vindictive, that the next step will be to include
Sundays as well, now that so many shops open on the Sabbath. Just put
the lock on the garage door.
Dandy David has solved his own problem. He has bought a ''little
place'' in the city centre and walks to work. The director of
transportation righteously takes the bus. That will be of great
consolation to the young mother in Sighthill with two young children, a
buggy and the shopping to transport.
Not all the comrades follow Councillor Begg's self-sacrificing
example. Only the other evening as I left a party and climbed into a
fast black -- I think taxis are politically correct although their
drivers rarely are -- I spotted the maroon gas-guzzler of the regional
convener, purring petrol into the night as it waited to convey
Councillor Eric Milligan to his next pressing engagement.
Don't think we will share a seat with him on the 23 to Canonmills.
At regular intervals Councillor Begg promises underground car parks,
trams and trains. Unlike the higher charges, none of these pipedreams
ever materialises.
So who defends the motorists, who speaks for the persecuted majority?
Not the motoring organisations. With the possible exception of the Press
Complaints Commission, the AA and the RAC are the most toothless bodies
since Jocky Wilson, more intent on inveigling folk into prize draws than
doing the job they are paid for.
The Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, belatedly, has realised that this
policy will affect the large retailers in the city centre. It is not
exactly an accident that Princes Street has lost so many quality shops.
In mitigation, Councillor Begg will tell you -- he is probably
composing a letter as you read this -- that he is only implementing
Government policy. But then the Westminster gang, of whatever hue, have
always been happy to soak the motorists as well.
Of course I accept that there must be restrictions on the use of the
motor car. We do not want all-day parkers in the city centre and those
who park dangerously should be heavily penalised.
But Edinburgh is a capital city, a commercial giant, a world financial
centre, and it should be possible to drive through it, or park for a
period of time, at a reasonable cost.
I am not car crazy. Indeed, if I never drove again it would not
trouble me. But I hate to see decent people suffer at the whims of
bigots.
Maybe I should form the Edinburgh Motorists' Defence Society.
That man of the people John Prescott, he who had his Jaguar nicked,
would make an excellent president, don't you think?

HOW times change. Once he was the angry young man asking the age-old
question Is She Really Going Out with Him?
Now, through a series of metamorphoses including bebop, movie
sound-tracking, and a Fleetwood Mac covering Keatonesque clown, Joe
Jackson has re-emerged with a criminally neglected new album -- the
hauntingly beautiful Night Music -- and the obligatory and long-awaited
tour to promote it.
Back in the dim and distant past, when Jackson was lumped together
with the punk explosion, it was obvious that he was a far more talented
and durable musician than most of the safety-pin brigade and potentially
as memorable a lyricist as the Costellos and the Coles.
Last night he was in playful mood with a somewhat paltry crowd
dissecting Danny Boy for a satanic pact from the new album and kyboshing
a hand-clapping accompaniment with some keyboard shenanigans before a
medley of Different for Girls and Is She Really . . . ?
Musically it was all very sedate and sublime. At one stage,
introducing a quintet of songs from the new material might have
suggested a wavering of the faithful. But a segue into a bunch of old
favourites was greeted with something of a collective sigh of relief.
An enthusiastic, if flawed, electric guitar assault on I'm the Man
threatened to disturb the senses, but a haunting Steppin' Out salvaged
the wonderful ambience of the evening.

AKIND of madness afflicts Tory and Labour. It is called fighting for
the soul of the party. It is developing in Mr Blair's campaign to
rewrite the Labour constitution. It rages within the Tory Party too,
between right and left.
I doubt if Mr Blair realised that it would come to this when he
launched his ''new'' Labour offensive on the nationalisation Clause 4. I
wonder if Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Cabinet Minister in charge of
Heritage, appreciates the full impact of his ''new'' thinking about
property-owning.
He told Leeds businessmen in a speech last Saturday that home owners
should no longer look on their houses as investments. ''Houses are for
living in; investment advice is for stockbrokers.'' He acknowledged that
''this challenges everything we have been taught about housing''.
It marks a watershed in Tory policy as profound as the ''new'' Labour
change in Clause 4. It indicates that Government strategy is actually to
discourage a recovery in property prices at a time when a million
families are living in houses worth less than their mortgages, not to
mention the 300,000 whose homes have been repossessed.
For a negative equity problem Mr Dorrell has a negative solution. The
Tory middle class abuses the Government. Mr Dorrell delivers them a
Cantona.
Mr Major strives to convince us, as a matter of political survival,
that the ''feel-good'' factor will return. Mr Dorrell effectively
cautions home owners that house prices could tumble again with another
increase in interest rates. As far as he is concerned ''stable'' house
prices are crucial to the battle of inflation. Such battles, as we have
already seen, cause heavy political casualties.
From Harold Macmillan onwards to Margaret Thatcher's property-owning
democracy, people have been encouraged to borrow up to the hilt for that
upwardly-mobile step of escaping the landlord and hedging against
inflation. Established Tory belief has been that people who invest in
their own bricks and mortar are less likely to go to political extremes.
Forget it, says Mr Dorrell, a former Treasury Minister. Get a
stockbroker instead.
It was an astonishing insight into Government policy from a Cabinet
Minister who knows Treasury thinking on this ''feel-bad'' factor in the
electorate. It was not just a one-off, spontaneous observation. Mr
Dorrell has been preparing himself for last Saturday's public utterance.
He had better ready himself for a backlash.
Mr Dorrell was never much of a Thatcherite. He was known as ''dripping
wet'' Dorrell, or ''the wettest of the wet''. No-one should be surprised
that he should want to distance the Government as far as possible from
Thatcherism. But what he has said goes further than that.
He undoubtedly believes that he is courageously stating a reality
about the housing market. First you encourage a boom (Lawson), then you
reduce mortgage tax relief (Clarke), then you tell people that a home is
just something you live in. Does this not attack the Tory soul with an
egalitarianism verging on ''old'' Labour socialism?
If so, for Tory MPs, Thatcherites or not, the Dorrell doctrine is even
more alarming. They may well come to see it as the Dorrell death-wish if
the Prime Minister allows it to take root as established policy,
overturning more than 30 years' of Tory evangelism.
Supposing the public rejects the ''new'' Tory Dorrell theory that
stable prices should encourage them to buy their own homes -- as I
suppose some Treasury model has divined. Supposing voters insist that
they not only want to buy their own homes, but sell them at a good
profit so that they can buy better ones?
Supposing they point out to Mr Dorrell that you can borrow money to
buy a house, but very few can borrow money to invest in shares? Fat
chance of Tory MPs holding their seats, you might think. After the
breaking of election promises on taxation, they are being asked, it
seems, to renege on the ''old'' ideal of home ownership.
If the Dorrell policy takes hold, and I don't believe that his message
last Saturday has quite sunk in, the language of the ''old'' Tory right
may become as virulent as that of the ''old'' Labour left.
To them Clause 4 is not just a vague aspiration about nationalisation.
It is a profound symbol of the soul of their party and of what
differentiates socialism from Conservatism or Liberalism.
Before Mr Blair has defined what he and ''new'' Labour stands for, he
wants to ditch what it used to stand for as a founding clause of the
Labour Party. Socialists are increasingly irritated by this vacuum.
We might expect Labour Briefing, the organ of the hard left, to brand
Mr Blair as ''class traitor of the month''. But it comes as a shock when
Austin Mitchell, the MP for Great Grimsby, uses Tribune to savage Mr
Blair and his ''new'' Labour. Mr Mitchell has been described as a centre
radical and the last remaining Gaitskellite.
He leaves us in no doubt that the soul of socialism is at stake. He
claims that the ''new'' Labour addresses only the media in carefully
polished sound bites. New Labour is an advertising ploy, countering
falling sales with a new, mystery ingredient. ''But why change when more
people want to vote old Labour than ever before?''
He declares that ''new'' Labour is about power, but not taking it back
into public ownership. It looks good on telly, but a minute later you
have forgotten what it said.
''New Labour does not stand for anything although it stands for a lot
from its leaders. A party without a past, a policy, or a commitment, it
travels light and hopefully in a direction it neither knows nor
understands and cannot influence.''
He clearly believes (and he is not alone in this) that Mr Blair and
Labour are indulging in madness and betrayal. Tories think the same of
Mr Major and his colleagues. The difference is that Mr Blair has a
better chance of bribing his party to acquiesce.
The Tories, according to Mr Dorrell, are no longer even bothered about
bribes.

SO now the Tory Euro-sceptics have latched onto the crisis in the
fishing grounds as a means of furthering their cause. Their opportunism
is not surprising, but their cynicism speaks volumes.
To try to persuade troubled fishermen that all their problems will be
solved by the simple act of tearing up the EU's Common Fisheries Policy
(CFP) -- even before it comes into effect in its latest revised form --
is to peddle a hoax. The last thing our fishermen need now is a bunch of
Europhobic political misfits using them as live bait for the ultimate
catch, which is withdrawal from Europe itself.
Only a flintheart could find no sympathy for our fishermen as they
view the prospect of Spanish skippers -- with their disgraceful record
of rule-breaking -- arriving to take away their livelihoods next year.
British fishing families, after generations at sea, will be encouraged
to go out of business while they watch the Spanish chasing ''their''
fish.
You can understand their fury and appreciate why there is a growing
clamour for the Government to pull Britain out of the CFP. Ditching the
CFP is a neat idea, of course; if only it were that simple.
Our fishermen hanker after the days when Britain had its own 200-mile
limit and foreigners like the Spanish fished our waters on our terms or
not at all. More than 20 years on, stocks have reached near extinction
in some areas (and in much of the rest of the world) and most of our
waters are open to all and sundry because the EU insists idealistically
there must be no discrimination against the fleet of any member state.
Everyone sympathises with our fishermen, but no-one can find an answer
to their difficulties. In Scotland the miseries of the fishing fleet are
felt acutely because Scottish boats take more than 70% of the United
Kingdom total catch, although those who stand to lose most from the new
CFP will be in the South of England.
To back their campaign for withdrawal from the CFP, the fishermen are
pressing Tory MPs in marginal seats and have promised to mount a serious
of ''spectacular'' but legal demonstrations at sea.
More worryingly, some have predicted violent clashes at sea in the
style of the exchanges which took place last year in the Bay of Biscay
between the Spanish, French, and English. Scottish boats could become
embroiled, too, because areas of the southern coast are fished by some
of our Clyde fleet.
Looked at from the Government's viewpoint, this is all a bit
melodramatic. Our negotiators, led by the accident-prone Mr William
Waldegrave, were defeated before the talks began. Once the principle of
admitting Spain to the CFP had been taken, there was never a chance of
stopping their fishermen and our Ministers knew it. The best they could
attempt was damage limitation.
Mr Waldegrave put on a brave show by claiming he had at least blocked
the Spanish from the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel. He claimed that
limiting the Spanish to 40 boats, from a total fleet of 1700, in the
so-called Irish Box conservation area was also a victory.
These adjustments are little more than fiddling with the CFP. The
bigger picture shows the true tragedy of fishing. Under EU rules our
abundant fish stocks have all but vanished as new technology has given
fishermen the ability to hunt and haul more effectively.
Of course, the EU is blameworthy but it is merely the custodian of
policies decided by national governments. Politicians, including British
ones, make the rules, not bureaucrats in Brussels.
If there are fewer fish, the fleet must shrink. Fishermen, however
brave and hard working, have no divine right to a living and are now
suffering like the steel workers, railwaymen, shipbuilders, and all the
rest before them.
So what can be done?
Well, let us start with what should not be done. We should not allow
the Euro-sceptics, with their own agenda and their sudden fascination
for this esoteric subject, to exploit our fishermen. Politicians know
too well that fishing is just a small industry in most EU countries but
one which produces emotions powerful enough to threaten the future of
the Community just as much as the more elevated debates about political
and monetary union.
Norway remained outside the EU largely because of fishing. Spain
threatened to wreck the enlargement of the union over the same issue.
Those who value the EU ignore fishing's destructive capability at their
peril.
We must, therefore, stick with the CFP, for all its imperfections, for
the time being. Britain is a signatory and we cannot simply declare
unilaterally that our word no longer applies. There would be claims,
legal actions, a whole procedural and constitutional mess, and political
poison in the air. Other member states would retaliate by banning
British boats from their waters and destroying imported catches.
But what if we took all that on the chin and pulled out tonight?
Reimposing a 200-mile limit would undoubtedly have some advantages but
some of them are mythical. For example, the English Channel ports would
gain exclusive rights to fish somewhere in the north of France! To the
east, all scientific evidence suggests the North Sea is mostly fished
out, or about to be. Gains from off the west coast would be lost when
other EU states closed markets in retaliation (particularly bad for the
Scots).
Even the ultimate weapon, British withdrawal from the EU itself, would
not prevent EU countries taking sanctions against British fishing
exports.
Most people who spend more than two minutes looking at the fishing
problem will tell you the CFP is only the start of the difficulties.
Scrapping it tonight would still leave the UK with the European single
market.
Under single market law the Spanish can openly and legally buy British
fishing boats, register them in the UK, and fish as UK vessels. They can
also buy processing plants and the means of exporting catches to Spain.
They are doing it in Scotland now. The single market would entitle them
to continue doing so.
The best we can hope for now is a renegotiation of the CFP at the
earliest possible moment and, in the meantime, a toughening of controls
on all fishermen of all nationalities with tighter reviews of quotas and
catches. There can be no fishing industry without fish. Stocks must be
allowed to recover.
In hindsight, we can see how a little more judicious negotiation by
our Government all those years ago might have avoided today's mess.
Perhaps fish should have been treated as a national and
geographically-controllable resource like oil and gas.
In our rush towards Europe the billions promised by offshore oil
simply overwhelmed the comparatively tiny fish industry and blinded
political judgment. I trust our Government is working right now on plans
to repair the damage.

W S Brownlie promotes the idea that the dropping of atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki was necessary as the situation had reached an
''impasse'' (January 19).
This is a myth. US authorities, having deciphered the enemy codes,
were entirely aware that Japan was on the verge of collapse and ready to
surrender. American experts revealed in the US strategic bombing survey
(a detailed investigation into the state of the Japanese war effort and
exhaustive interviews with top Japanese officials) that the Japanese
would have surrendered ''certainly prior to December 31, 1945, and in
all probability prior to November 1, 1945 . . . even if the atomic bombs
had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even
if no invasion had been planned or contemplated''.
The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a calculated,
politically-motivated massacre staged less to end the war than to mark
the start of a postwar world order run from Washington. More than
200,000 people were annihilated because the US wanted to show the world
that henceforth it would be the world's policeman.
It is ironic that W S Brownlie accuses Penny Lewis of naivety when he
himself shows such blind faith in politicians. Personally I refuse to
trust any government whose president declared that the destruction in
Hiroshima ''was the greatest thing in history''.

Frank McCormick, chairman of Glasgow Solicitors Property Centre,
should know better than to claim that ''no-one else can offer such an
all-embracing service, certainly not an estate agent'' (January 11).
This attitude is unfortunately all too common among solicitors. Of
course any competent estate agent knows what alterations require
planning consent and/or building warrants.
Solicitors are experts in the law and deal with conveyancing well.
Estate agents are generally happy to avoid this work, despite the
growing breed of licensed conveyancers.
Let estate agents sell houses and solicitors do the paperwork -- and
let everyone live happily ever after.

ONE elderly woman's stand against social workers closing down the old
folk's home where she had lived for five years embarrassed Scottish
officialdom recently. While the Right and Left wrangled for media
advantage in the private/public health war, she stood up and said: ''I
am nobody's pawn. What you are really doing is chucking me out of my
home.''
Her battle cry seems to have been too simple for politicians to grasp.
Private residential and nursing homes have never posed a threat to the
National Health Service -- in fact, without them the Health Service
would be strained to the point of collapse.
Let's look at the human reality of a nursing home I left this morning.
Two nurses lifted Jessie further up the bed, smoothed it out and placed
the buzzer in her hand. ''Just call us if you need anything else,'' said
one of the young nurses.
As Jessie sat back in her comfortable bed she realised she was happier
than she had been for years. Now that she had chosen to come into a
nursing home she was well fed and cared for and had made many friends;
the painful memories of her cold, damp tenement flat with its empty
larder seemed distant.
Not an extract from some fictional woman's magazine story but a
scenario repeated in hundreds of residential and nursing homes
throughout Scotland every day.
Political activists know this. Much of the hype against private care
has been engineered by a group I term the ''anti-private sector lobby''.
This is a group of local authority employees, politicians, trade union
officials, members of supposedly ''caring'' organisations and others who
are gravely concerned at the growth of private care in Britain -- in
Scotland private residential and nursing homes look after more than
20,000 residents and employ 25,000 people.
This lobby is not really concerned with the welfare of elderly people.
What concerns it is that people have made a profit from providing care,
and it has spoon-fed the media with juicy stories about bad private
care, some of which have been wildly exaggerated and some fabricated.
This onslaught against private care has served to divert attention
from the crisis facing both the local authorities and private care home
owners as a result of the Community Care Act which was implemented in
April 1993.
The essence of community care, as defined by Sir Roy Griffiths in his
1988 report Community Care -- Agenda for Action, was that everyone in
need of care should be assessed by social workers and given an
appropriate package of care. This might mean home care services such as
the district nurse, home help or meals on wheels. Other more dependent
clients might require admission to a residential and nursing home. Sir
Roy believed the emphasis should be on keeping people in their own homes
for as long as possible.
All this sounds very sensible but the reality of community care has
been somewhat different, as the Government saw it as a way of saving
money. Between 1983 and 1993 many of those entering private residential
and nursing homes were funded by the DSS. This resulted in a mushrooming
of the number of homes and a huge increase in the annual DSS Income
Support bill, from #10m in 1979 to #900m in 1988.
By transferring funding from the DSS to the local authorities, giving
them a fixed budget and instructing them to keep people at home as long
as possible, the Government hoped the spiralling cost of care could be
controlled.
In fact, home care has proved to be more expensive than anyone
thought, with some packages costing up to #60,000 per person per annum,
almost six times the cost of a place in a private residential home.
But it would be wrong to put all the blame for the ills of community
care on the Government, as many private care home owners believe that
some Scottish local authorities have hidden agendas which involve making
life difficult for the private sector.
There is no overt bias against the private sector. Instead there is a
covert bias which manifests itself in various ways, like the requirement
that every resident in a residential or nursing home has a single room
without the offer of a 50% increase in fee levels which would make this
practical.
The impression is always given in news reports that residential and
nursing homes are very loosely regulated. In fact such homes are now the
most over-regulated businesses in Europe and hardly a week goes by
without some new ''rule'' appearing.
Private-care home owners have also pointed to Scottish Office
statistics on admissions to residential care homes which show that most
clients are being directed into local authority residential care homes
rather than cheaper private sector homes.
Figures show there have been four admissions to local authority homes
for every one to private homes since April 1993. The discrepancy in
short-stay (respite) admissions is even greater at 40:1 in favour of the
local authority. The obvious suspicion is that some social workers are
keeping people away from private homes for ideological reasons.
Sir Roy Griffiths's original plan envisaged the local authorities
giving up their so-called provider role and becoming purchasers of care.
This would involve them selling off or closing their own homes and
buying in services from the private and voluntary sectors. This has not
happened in Scotland to any great extent Government figures show that
local authority residential care homes cost up to #440 per resident per
week, about twice the price of an equivalent private bed. Critics of
private care have pointed out that local authority homes cost more
because their staff are better paid. Local authority staff are better
paid, but there are fewer of them -- staffing levels of one member of
staff to 15 residents are still common. By comparison, private
residential homes must provide a staffing level of one to eight, with a
one-to-six ratio in establishments catering for residents with dementia.
A crisis in care is looming due to lack of Government cash and
political dogma, but this can only be averted if present attitudes to
private care of the elderly are altered. There should be no argument
about whether the State or the private sector can care for people
better. In truth they need each other.

Owners (SACHO).

Contrary to Jack Wright's view, the experience of the A737 Johnstone
by-pass actually provides further evidence that the M77 will create more
problems than it solves (January 18).
The new road has demonstrably not solved traffic congestion in
Johnstone. Traffic has a nasty habit of expanding to fill the available
road space, and the extra town-centre capacity freed up by the by-pass
appears to have encouraged further growth of local car traffic.
Tailbacks of vehicles near the Johnstone exit of the A737 are a common
rush-hour sight.
The sheer width and long sightlines of the by-pass have produced
dangerous high-speed driving, and already there have been a number of
fatal accidents, including at least one child attempting a shortcut
across the road.
The A737 has created a new barrier between Linwood and Johnstone where
once there was open countryside. The road has also severed the line of
the former Kilmacolm railway, which was closed so shortsightedly in
1983, so the prospects of ever reopening this link are now very slim.
Clearly the A737 has enabled many long-distance commuters to cut a
couple of minutes off their journey times, but the downside is that the
availability of the new road has encouraged yet more traffic growth to
clog up the M8 and the streets of Paisley and Glasgow.
Following the opening of the by-pass, passenger numbers dropped on the
competing Largs-Glasgow rail service, so one can only presume that
Strathclyde Regional Council is now having to fund an increased subsidy
to keep the trains running.
Jack Wright is not only wrong about the A737 in general, he also makes
the arrogant assumption that everyone has a car. I don't own a car, and
the local bus service doesn't use the by-pass, so the new road is little
use to me. Just like the M77 will be very little use to the 65% of
Glasgow households that do not have a car.

am inclined to agree with what he writes in his Monday column, but I
must admit to mourning with him the passing of that old-fashioned word
''trust'' (January 23).
However, I do hope that he does not overlook the fact that the valet's
master undertook solemn vows of loyalty and trust when he married Diana
which he broke without -- so far as we know -- ''a can of beans'' being
involved.

''Private Clegg looks the epitome of a good soldier and he has my
wholehearted support for what he did,'' writes David Henderson (January
26).
I find it disconcerting that dealing out violent death should be
excused on the grounds of appearance, but it fits well with the
portrayal of Private Clegg as an unblemished innocent that his
supporters seem to prefer to the examination of his and his fellow
paratroopers' actions.
After firing 19 bullets into the car containing Karen Reilly and Kevin
Peake, Private Clegg's patrol immediately started falsifying evidence to
make it look as though the car had hit one of their number -- a
statement contradicted by investigating RUC officers.
Private Clegg's proponents seldom mention the variance between the
statements made by paratroopers at the trial and the forensic evidence
presented by the Crown.
That the object of the patrol, as your editorial points out, was
specifically to deal with joyriders rather than an anti-terrorist
operation has also been overlooked, as has the important detail that the
act of crashing a roadblock is behaviour indicative of joyriders rather
than paramilitaries.
My sympathy in this affair lies with the family of Karen Reilly.
Mourning a daughter who paid the ultimate penalty for an act of teenage
foolishness, they are forced to watch their daughter's killer being
given hero status.
Their own anguish is deemed unworthy of consideration by a campaign
whose object is not the securing of justice but of forestalling any
criticism of British troops no matter how callous their actions.
The real lesson to be learned from this tragic affair is not to do
with criminal charges or sentencing. Rather it is that compared to the
good name of the British Amry many people believe that the life of a
young woman is worth nothing at all.

James Cuthbertson's letter about the BT phone disc is misleading
(January 13). The BT phone disc covers the whole of the UK in exactly
the same way as the unlicensed product available in the US to which he
refers.
It is available in a number of formats with corresponding prices, eg
for use by a stand-alone PC or as a networkable product, and can be
updated quarterly or annually.
The cost of the annually updated, UK-wide disc has recently been
reduced from #950 to #299 (excluding VAT), far from ''unaffordable'' as
Mr Cuthbertson suggests.

I enjoyed Anvar Khan's well-composed article on Scott and the
Antarctic, but I cannot accept it is more than a narrow and unjust point
of view (January 21).
Scott's and Amundsen's race to the South Pole in 1912 is a story of
such Homeric proportions and historical example that the difference
between success and failure is hardly relevant.
It has to be remembered that the expedition included scientific
exploration, and one has but to turn to the account of one of its
intrepid young scientists, Apsley Cherry Gerrard in his The Worst
Journey in the World, to learn of its magnificent fulfilment.
Allied to this was the product of the official photographer, Herbert
Ponting, who along with Dr Edward Wilson and his watercolours brought
back a superb and graphic record of Antarctica and of those early
explorers of a continent in those days as forlorn as the moon.
All these events occurred in an age of empire glory, when the rallying
words of Tennyson, the late Victorian poet laureate, were still ringing
in the ears of the Edwardians: ''To strive, to seek, to find, and not to
yield'' -- so fittingly quoted on the tomb of Scott and his companions
in those frozen wastes.
That the Discovery, which, of course, relates to Scott's first
expedition of 1902 and not to the second, has found a safe haven at
Dundee may, I trust, help to stimulate and inspire a healthy spirit of
adventure and endurance in the youth of today as an antidote to the
prevalence of unemployment and the social dangers of our times.

I found Anvar Khan's article on Discovery Point, Dundee, of
considerable interest (Weekender, January 21).
Her introduction states: ''The Antarctic sits at the top of the world,
like icing on a Christmas pud.'' Would ''upside-down cake'' not have
provided a more geographically correct illustration?

FEW things put a spring into one's step like the forecast of good
fortune. It explains the popularity of newspaper horoscopes, which
rarely predict scraping into a lamppost or losing one's credit card.
''An unexpected improvement in your finances enables you to look again
at an original, creative idea which has had to be shelved,'' they say.
This shows remarkable perception. The astrologer cannot have known how
many original and creative ideas we have had, and that only money was
preventing their implementation. We do not read horoscopes regularly, of
course, but with good eyesight they can sometimes be seen over other
people's shoulders in trains and buses. Also, such journals are often
left in hairdressers and doctors' waiting rooms. It would be foolish,
knowing that we are a Sagittarius, or a Gemini, to reject outside
guidance entirely. If leading politicians use astrologers, at least we
are not alone.
Such was the situation until a dramatic claim by the Royal
Astronomical Society last week that there are 13 signs of the zodiac,
not 12, and that most people have a different star sign from the one
they think they have. People born between November 30 and December 17,
say astronomers, actually come under the sign of Ophiuchus, the God of
Healing, whose sign is an Aesculapian snake curled round a stick. In any
case, adds Dr Jacqueline Mitton, astrological predictions are wildly
inaccurate, and the whole industry is moonshine, being based on the
skies of ancient Greece.
The announcement has caused fury among horoscopists, who accuse
astronomers themselves of being unscientific. Far from there being 13
constellations, said one astrologer, there were actually 88, many of
them overlapping. For ignorant lay folk the situation seems quite
promising. When the new zodiac is published they will have two star
signs to choose from, and twice as many compatible spouses. The only
people with a grievance are the new Ophiuchians, who have been allocated
only a fortnight's worth of sky. No sooner does their star sign gain
ascendance than it sinks back over the horizon.

IN A recent Heart of Midlothian Football Club programme Lothian
region's convener, Eric Milligan, attempted to put into words his
passionate, lifelong attachment to the Edinburgh club.
''I did not become a Hearts supporter. I was born one. It is in my
blood,'' wrote the man born in 1951 in a working-class tenement in
Gorgie.
''What perhaps is a little bit unusual is the intensity of my feelings
towards the Hearts, why my unflagging devotion has endured for almost 40
years during which time heartaches have far outnumbered Hearts'
achievements.''
He was reared, he says, in the unshakeable belief that in a perfectly
ordered world Heart of Midlothian Football Club would win every honour,
every year.
Talk about football with the convener and it's clear his team's past
defeats still hurt. He will recall wistfully that only between about
1954 and 1960 were Hearts regularly winning honours.
''That is a very small time span when you remember the club was formed
in 1874. They should have won a damn sight more than they have.''
Eric Milligan's life has been dominated by football and by Labour
Party politics.
This is the man, after all, who postponed his honeymoon with Janis,
now a legal accountant, so he could cast his vote at a selection
conference choosing a Labour parliamentary candidate.
It is the man who still feels anguished that the first time he was
eligible to vote he had to mark his cross for a Liberal candidate
because no Labourite was standing.
It was common in those days for many councillors in the old
corporation to be returned unopposed but so upset was the young Eric on
that occasion that he immediately urged the Edinburgh Labour Party to
pursue a policy of putting up a candidate for every seat. And so it has
been ever since.
I once heard a senior Labour MP rather unkindly call Eric Milligan ''a
bit of a plodder''. Some of his political opponents are kinder, claiming
he is a fair chairman and an excellent host.
By general consensus not a great orator though. He has an odd habit of
always calling people ''persons''.
Nevertheless, his steady, dependable advance has brought him a very
distinguished career in local government.
While hope springs eternal in his breast that Hearts will one day win
the Scottish Cup again he himself looks well set to win a unique
political triple crown.
A former president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities,
his second term as Lothian region convener will be cut short by the
demise of the region under council reorganisation in April 1996.
But by that time another glittering prize could be within his reach --
the first lord provostship of Edinburgh in the new single-tier city
administration.
If that happens, and Labour are hotly tipped to gain control of the
new unitary authority at the elections on April 6, he will be anxious to
salvage what he can from the Government-created ruins of his beloved
Lothian region.
He believes firmly that Edinburgh should not have been hacked away
from the surrounding areas of West, Mid and East Lothian which will now
form unitary authorities of their own.
A Lord Provost Milligan would try to promote region-wide co-operation
between the new authorities wherever possible, to try to preserve
previously successful mechanisms of inward investment, strategic
planning and cultural patronage.
He was imbued with politics as well as football from birth. ''I think
by the time I had learned to walk I had almost started to realise I
would grow up as someone who was a Labour supporter and a Hearts
supporter. The Tories were the bogeymen.''
The son of a full-time trade union official, Eric Milligan became a
district councillor when he was 23. He moved on to the regional council
in 1978 and was quickly catapulted to national prominence as finance
chairman when Lothian region and the Scottish Office clashed mightily
over council spending levels.
In 1979-1980 after the-then Scottish Secretary George Younger got a
Bill through Parliament penalising the council to the tune of #47m, the
Scottish Office agreed to settle for a budget reduction of #30m.
The Lothian Labour group split, with Eric at this stage urging realism
and a damage-limitation exercise as opposed to continued defiance.
''I have never been part of the hey presto, instant socialism brigade.
I've no time for revolutionary rhetoric. It is my belief that the Labour
Party's role is to protect the services and the interests of people to
the best of its ability.''
It is still his strong view, however, that councillors, not Government
Ministers, should determine the level of local taxation and should be
prepard to argue for it on the doorsteps.
You could say, rather unkindly, that as a result of all this local
politicking he hasn't had a proper job for 15 years since giving up work
as a printer at Waddies in Edinburgh.
And despite his high local profile, unlike such ex-Edinburgh Labour
councillors as Alistair Darling, George Foulkes and Nigel Griffiths, he
has not managed to make the transition, despite two attempts, to the
bigger political pond of Westminster.
None the less, he has wielded power locally while backbench Labour MPs
have fretted impotently at Westminster under Tory rule since 1979.
Some from Eric Milligan's own party, perhaps with a hint of jealousy,
have suggested that the man who once railed so tellingly against the
Government's attempts to cut back council spending has settled with a
little too much enthusiasm for a comfortable public life of cosseting by
personal assistants and chauffeurs with trips abroad and plenty of
social entertaining.
He does obviously enjoy being convener and likes to extend the
region's hospitality to make people from all walks of life feel at ease
within its walls.
The man himself, however, never believed in wearing a hair shirt for
his socialist beliefs. Nowadays he is usually garbed in smart Marks and
Spencer suits and never subscribed to the view that the New Jerusalem
was best advanced wearing sweat shirts or dungarees.
Socialists, he says, should not apologise for wanting to do things
with a bit of style.
But politically he is a Labour traditionalist who, he admits, is
unhappy with new leader Tony Blair's decision to send his son to an
opted-out school and thinks all the fuss stirred up over changes to
Clause Four would have been better avoided.
Devolution doesn't exactly set his pulses racing either. Never has.
But I would not bet against the likely Lord Provost bidding for a seat
in any new Scottish Parliament.
Despite all the talk of a New Labour Party, Convener Milligan's deeply
held core beliefs remain the same. ''We want the richest people in
society to be poorer and the poorest people in society to be richer. We
believe our city and our country would be a better place if it was not
so imbalanced in the way in which wealth was distributed.
''I am in politics to do my wee bit to redistribute wealth so that the
opportunities a few people are able to enjoy are opened up so that the
overwhelming majority of people can enjoy the same opportunities.''
Sometimes, he says, that basic message gets lost along the way because
it is not considered popular.
Eric Milligan is as keen on any occasion to talk about sport as about
politics and much as he loves soccer, contrasts the changes in the
fortunes of football and rugby in his lifetime.
''Football has fallen behind for a variety of reasons. It has lost a
great deal of support because of the hooliganism problem and the way in
which the police have reacted to it has introduced all sorts of controls
which make ordinary decent people going to a match feel they are being
viewed as potential thugs or hooligans.
''I think also the social changes and the decline of what is called
the manual working class has had a big impact on football. The other
thing is the hegemony of the Glasgow clubs and the religion that
underpins them.
''Let nobody pretend other than that it is religion that underpins
football in Scotland, with Rangers and Celtic, and to a slightly lesser
extent in Edinburgh and in Dundee as well. People are just increasingly
turned off by all that.''
The fact that Edinburgh-based Scottish Brewers sponsors Rangers
irritates him enormously. ''I tease them about it all the time but it is
all about selling McEwans Lager in Glasgow.''

YESTERDAY former Allied prisoners of war of the Japanese joined former
Japanese soldiers in laying memorial wreaths at Japan's tomb of the
unknown soldier. Such gestures of reconciliation are important. They do
not change the past, but they do wash away some of the bitterness felt
by survivors on both sides, and especially in this case by many Western
prisoners of the Japanese. Former prisoners are pressing the Japanese
Government for financial compensation for their suffering, as well as
some public and formal statement of regret. The money does not seem
important, in itself, to many of the survivors but the admission of
unjustifiable cruelty and the Japanese responsibility for it is another
matter. Many would appreciate that, particularly because the Japanese
Government remains reluctant to accept Western views of the Second World
War in Asia and equally reluctant to admit Japan's role in its
beginnings.
In fact some steps were taken a long time ago to provide nominal
compensation for former British POWs (at the 1951 Treaty of San
Francisco) but the sum was extremely modest. Even the $22,000 being
asked for in a case whose hearing begins today in the Tokyo District
Court is hardly generous, though it is based upon the amount awarded
seven years ago to some Japanese-Americans by the US Government as
compensation for their internment in their own country in the years
immediately after Pearl Harbor, a shameful episode, now recognised as
such by today's Americans.
The Japanese Government has had two reasons for appearing difficult on
this issue. The first is pride; the second is straightforward financial
prudence. Pride is here used as a broad term which re-emphasises the
cultural gap which exists between Western and Eastern notions of war and
honour. The Japanese still find it hard to accept the way in which the
West perceives the war and its outcome, which of course involved Japan's
comprehensive defeat. Similar divergent perceptions explain how Japanese
conduct was incomprehensible to POWs: under the then prevalent Japanese
military code the defeated had no rights and were entitled to harsh
treatment and poor rations. The reality of Asian life also pointed in
these directions for it was far harsher than anything to which
Westerners were accustomed.
More malign treatment was dished out to many others, in this case
Asians themselves, in what was the short-lived Japanese empire in China
and Southeast Asia. It might seem that such sufferers should have known
what to expect, but that is definitely not an acceptable argument, and
it anyhow ignores the fact that notions of what is right in such areas
of human conduct have themselves undergone a profound change in Asia in
the past half-century. If the Japanese Government, by giving way to the
Europeans, faces similar but more numerous claims from Asians, it need
hardly be too downcast. It has the financial resources to meet them, and
will be buying goodwill by doing so.

Patricia Fenn follows a ragged course in Brittany
IT'S hard to believe that one region could encompass such variety:
stark rock/soft dunes, pink granite/emerald sea, fierce rollers/calm
estuaries, dizzy heights/flat marshland, bleak moor/fertile farms,
fishing villages/jazzy resorts. Because of this ever-changing scenery
Brittany is ideal touring country. You can drive from rocky north to
sandy south in a couple of hours, taking in a medieval village, a forest
full of Arthurian legend, and a canal network on the way.
There is no doubt that the most powerful Breton influence, bounding
three sides of the region, is the sea. Two-thirds of France's entire
coastline is here. A drive along the coast, anti-clockwise from Mont St
Michel to La Baule, would be a magnificent introduction to this rich,
rewarding region.
Avoid the Mont on holidays. Sharing it with hordes of other pilgrims
just doesn't do it justice. You need to see it swimming in the early
morning mists like a mirage, or climb its narrow winding streets when
the tourists have gone home in order to appreciate why it is called ''Le
Merveille''.
Take the flat coast road past the oyster beds to the sunny little
fishing port of Cancale, then on to St Malo, No1 choice for a break
off-season, when most of the coastal resorts die. Walk round the
ramparts for the best view of sands, islands, rocks, harbour, galloping
tide and, across the estuary, the Edwardians' favourite resort, Dinard.
A boat trip up the River Rance culminates in the exceptionally charming
(even for Brittany) Dinan, where narrow cobbled streets, bordered with
medieval houses, lead down to the picturebook port.
The Emerald Coast is lined with little family holiday spots, with good
beaches and views, then small fishing harbours. The Ile de Brehat, just
off the fishing port of Paimpol, is a short boat ride away.
From then on it all starts getting really interesting. The Pink
Granite Coast is a favourite stretch, with the strange rock formations,
like Spitting Image puppets, pointed out to excursion boat passengers on
their way to the bird sanctuaries on the Sept Iles. Old smugglers' paths
follow the cliff edge above pine-fringed bays. Perros Guirec is the
biggest resort, in a superb natural setting.
Immense sandy bays follow one another up to the old and interesting
river port of Morlaix, with the time-warped Ile de Batz lying offshore,
along with more islands and beaches around the ferry port of Roscoff.
This extreme western region of Brittany is as far removed from the
rest of France in character as in geography. The coast and ocean become
increasingly wild; inland the Regional Park of Armorique covers a vast
barren mountainous area, where in remote villages the Breton language is
still spoken.
No visitor should fail to see the parish closes, where churches have
competed over the centuries to produce the most impresive triumphal
arches, calvaries, ossuaries and interiors, all contrived from the
recalcitrant local granite. The carvings may appear crude to the point
of caricature but the stories they tell are fascinating. The most famous
is the calvary at Guimiliau, where 200 figures depict the Passion.
South of Brest the fishing industry dominates in ports like
Douarnenez, until the cote de Cournouaille beaches begin to take over
from rocks and the atmosphere grows softer. Concarneau combines a beach
resort with the interest of a fishing port and an ancient ''ville
close''. This Bigouden area is where you will see the starched coiffes
and family heirloom costumes in the colourful local religious
processions, the Pardons.
Sheer delight from now on, with the deep estuaries of green-banked
rivers, Odet, Aven, Belon, Laita, slicing into Mediterranean-style
foliage. Pont Aven draws the crowds thanks to its Gauguin connection,
but retains its charm. Everyone finds the Quiberon peninsula
fascinating, with Carnac's contrasting modern resort and mystifying
megaliths. La Trinite attracts yachts and yotties from all over the
world.
An island for every day of the year nestles in the (almost) inland sea
of Morbihan. You can take a boat from picturesque Vannes and stop off on
one for a picnic. The mighty river Vilaine is good to explore by water
too; a canal boat from La Roche Bernard would do nicely.
And to cram in as many contrasts as possible, the landscape changes
abruptly into the strange world of marsh canals -- La Grande Briere;
granite islands support whitewashed cottages whose peasant owners cut
reeds to thatch their roofs and journey by flat-bottomed punts. Don't
miss ramparted Guerande, rising from the salt pans like an oasis. Then,
as if some divine organiser had thought ''What have we left out in this
catalogue of Breton attributes?'' comes the surprise of an elegant,
sophisticated resort, La Baule.
Getting there: Brittany Ferries run to St Malo from Poole and
Portsmouth, tel: 01705 827701 and to Roscoff from Plymouth tel: 01752
221321.
Staying there: accommodation ranges from chambres d'hotes (bed and
breakfast) from #20 for two people to luxury chateaux hotels from #70
for two. Information from the French Government Tourist Office, 178
Piccadilly, London W1V 9DB.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie has binoculars trained on the loch
TO get a feel for the town, I started off that bright autumn morning
with a walk along the banks of the River Ness, which divides Inverness
on its short journey from Loch Ness to the Moray Firth. The riverbank
gardens were peaceful and above them, the castle, a Victorian building,
is the successor to many earlier castles which had seen much strife.
When Mary Queen of Scots came to Inverness in 1562, she found the
castle of the time closed to her. Furious, she recaptured it the next
day and hanged the governor from the ramparts. His ghost, they say,
still haunts the vaults.
The setting is lovely between the mountains and the sea, and only six
miles down the road, the possibility of finding the famous monster on
Loch Ness. Not long back from Sweden, where Frosjon, a beautiful lake
much further north than Loch Ness also claims a monster, I was convinced
that this time I really would see it.
For any Scot, the Culloden battlefield, three miles east from the
centre, is a magnet. It was a beautiful day, yet somehow this quiet
green place, with its great grass mounds, always has an air of sadness
hanging over it and, they say, no heather will ever grow on the graves.
By using the B-roads, we had been able to go into Cawdor Castle,
Macbeth's Cawdor. This is where it is said King Duncan died, and the
whole tragedy set off on its inexorable course. Outside, it has three
beautiful gardens, with nature trails, but it is the battlements and the
dungeon that brings back Shakespeare and Macbeth.
Though the population is only around 40,000, Inverness is very much
the ''capital'', of the Highlands, with a sort of proper pride in itself
that makes me feel I ought to call it a city. People from a wide area
come into Inverness, to work, to shop, and for leisure and, at the
height of the season, it is packed with visitors.
The town is also a good place for eating, and a lot of traditional
dishes: cullen skink (fish soup), seafood, venison and, something I
always forget how much I love -- crannachan, made with local berries --
brambles at this time of year -- oatmeal soaked in malt whisky, crowdie,
honey and cream.
We finished one afternoon with a tour of the factory and a visit to
the old shop where it all started. For whisky buffs there are several
distilleries. Glen Ord on this north-western side, not far from Muir of
Ord, Tomatin, heading south on the A9. Evening entertainment is easy,
with the Eden Court Theatre, a year-round programme from theatre to
music and special events, and authentic Scottish music in pubs and
hotels.
Also good is the sheer variety of things to see and do in the
Inverness area. Another day, we turned west along the road that skirts
the Beauly Firth for the little town of Beauly, at the inner end of the
Beauly Firth, said to have gained its name when Mary Queen of Scots
exclaimed on first sight of it: ''Quel beau lieu!'' -- ''What a
beautiful place!'' -- and so it is.
On the way along the Firth, Moniack Castle is now well known for its
Highland wineries, which use natural sources for wines from the dry
Silver Birch to Moniack Mead and Sloe Liquor. The castle has been a
Fraser seat since 1580, the chatelaine Phillipa Fraser started the
winery in 1980. Today the castle winery is very popular for tours and
tastings, and also has a restaurant and bar for lunch or dinner.
Close by Beauly we stopped for a look round the ruins of the
thirteenth century Beauly Priory, which still has beautiful windows and
window-arcades.
But I had kept the best to the last, and headed south down Loch Ness,
eyes swerving to the water whenever a ripple appeared, just in case it
was a mighty fin. Down at the Drumnadrochit Centre, some 15 miles to the
south, monster spotting seemed to have turned into scientific study
rather than a tantalising quest. The exhibition gives details of recent
scientific hunts, photographs, and a craft used. But the more romantic
theories survive, with a few blurred pictures that enthusiasts have
claimed really were the monster.
Alas, I was no more successful than I had been in Sweden. The only
monster we saw that day was the rather hideous replica of Nessie in the
small lochan by the centre. Never mind, monster hunting was a marvellous
excuse for a long picnic by the loch and an afternoon just lazing, the
binoculars scouring the water.

THE Government continues to flounder over the European Union in spite
of the Prime Minister's attempts to keep everybody happy. The impression
is growing that Mr Major is moving towards Euro-scepticism, part of the
process necessary to bring the nine rebels back into the fold. As he
does so, however, he upsets supporters on the other wing who have been
quickly articulating their hostility to the change. That really means
that he is merely switching the location of his problem, not settling
it; but it may also mean that the centre of gravity within his party is
itself shifting, with opinion growing progressively hostile to the
notion of ''ever closer political union''. National hostility to the
Union was underlined by the popular response to a BBC radio discussion
two weeks ago. Listeners to a debate were asked to record their opinion,
and the outcome was a very substantial majority opposed to further
integration and a single currency. This seems to have reinforced the
conviction that the issue may offer the Tories a route to electoral
salvation come the next election.
It is still possible that demand for a faster pace to integration and
a single currency, firmly endorsed by Mr Santer, will not be sustained
by European opinion generally. Very few member states could actually
cope with the strains which might be imposed by a single currency. The
core states could, but even there the result of the French referendum
should not be ignored, for it delivered only the thinnest endorsement of
the Union, and nothing since will have made French opinion shift. Even
the likely successor to President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Balladur,
is a relative sceptic and his main rival, Mr Chirac, is even more of
one. The French bureaucratic elite is another matter, however -- and its
Euro-optimism is shared by its counterparts in other member countries. A
slower integrative pace would suit the British Government, and the
Inter-Governmental Conference, now less than two years away, will come
at a politically convenient time for it but it could just as easily
support Mr Santer's strategy. Whatever its outcome, it hardly affords
much hope of reconciling the discordant voices in the Tory choir.
If two weeks is a long time in politics, what about two years? It is
beginning to appear that the Europhiles among the Cabinet heavyweights
are now restricted to the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor, and
there is evident pressure on the former to resign. Were Mr Hurd to do
so, and be replaced by Mr Portillo, the Employment Secretary, the signs
would be unmistakable. Meanwhile Labour seems united on Europe, and in
favour. Yet the most compelling speech in the BBC debate, noted above,
was from a distinguished Labour sceptic, Peter Shore. Europe remains a
divisive issue for both parties; but what is a Labour crack is a Tory
chasm.

THE giant steel diamonds of the Forth rail bridge never did gleam but
many say they have long lost their lustre. Stretching out across the
dark waters of the River Forth hangs 50 thousand tons of steel twisted,
over a century ago, by an awesome feat of engineering into a practical
national monument.
Two hundred trains a day still hammer across its structure but today
it gives some cause for concern, which critics say is more than just
cosmetic.
On Saturday Storm (Stop this Railway Madness), the anti-rail
privatisation action group, declared a giant public paintathon to save
the bridge's looks, while today Tam Dalyell, MP, will raise the subject
of the bridge's condition in the House Of Commons. Railtrack, the body
who maintain the bridge say all is well, but would one extend such
concerns for the producers of the bridge's famous paint?
The bridge owes its red hue to the chemical wizards at Craig and Rose.
How, may we ask, are they?
Just fine, is the answer from the Edinburgh-based firm who were formed
more than 160 years ago by the bright young Scots businessmen James
Craig and Hugh Rose who originally began in the oil trade with exports
from Leith before they both started painting. It was in 1890, however,
that their bright paint beat off four other firms for the Forth Bridge
contract.
At the time it was built the bridge was the biggest man-made structure
in Europe. Designed by Sir Benjamin Baker, it cost #3.5m, 57 lives were
lost, and it used 6.5 million rivets, the last of which was laid by the
Prince of Wales on March 4. This year the bridge celebrates its 105th
birthday.
The paint Craig and Rose created as the final coating to protect it
from the salt sea air had a secret formula. Now that it has been
superseded it can be revealed as red oxide of iron and linseed oil. The
linseed oil has now been replaced by more modern resources. The idea at
the time was to develop a paint which would not flake or crack. Today in
some sections samples can be analysed to reveal over 30 different
layers.
Myths abound about the painting of the bridge. It is not painted from
one end to the other which would take a dozen years and involve 145
acres of paint, but is painted in sections. Five coats cover each
section, a yellow primer, two undercoats of light green and dark green,
a top layer of dark grey and a layer of Craig and Rose's special,
solidly spread. Some sections were painted every five years but now a
paint has been developed which will last 25 years. Others require more
regular treatment.
So striking is the reddish paint that souvenir paint pots of Forth
Bridge iron oxide paint is produced by Craig and Rose and retail at
#6.75 for 250mm, a good deal more than Railtrack pay. Sales of the paint
have declined, however the firm's managing director Colin Mitchell Rose
insists that it is pride more than profit that maintains one of the
longest service contracts in Scottish history.
''Our contract with the Forth Bridge has got to be one of our most
important, in terms of our turnover it is very small but it's one we
take a great deal of pride in. It has made us recognised throughout the
world, as we produce that paint only for the bridge.''
Mr Rose is the sixth generation of Rose to run what is now a public
company but admits to being only a novice with a mere 22 years under his
belt. However, the business is a veteran with contracts all over the
world. Its office in Leith Walk employs more than 100 people and its
scientists are currently developing water-based paints which will be
more environmentally friendly.
The company also has an exclusive contract with the BBC who use Craig
and Rose paint to protect transmitter masts and towers while also
selling the more mundane essentials such as wallpaper. ''We really go
from the sublime to the ridiculous with our range of products,'' said Mr
Rose. Wallpaper really becomes ridiculous when you imagine the Forth
Bridge covered in it.
The sublime product of Craig and Rose will be around for a long time
to come if Railtrack follow the wisdom of Sir Benjamin Baker. Talking of
the Forth Bridge he said: ''As long as men painted it . . . so it would
stand.'' Everyone seems to agree.

Julia Langdon charts the life and turbulent times of TV executive and
author Lis Howell.
THIS is a classic case of art mirroring life: Lis Howell, a woman
television executive, has written a thriller with a central character
who is a woman in television. That much is already clear when I set out
to go to talk to her about it, but to my surprise I find that I have
myself stepped inside the mirror.
For here I am, at the television studios, watching the woman who runs
the station being interviewed on a live programme on her station about
her book about a woman in television and discussing how much progress
women executives have made in television.
She is very impressive: as a performer, although naturally it is not
something she does very often; as an executive, having one of the most
successful careers in senior posts in television; and as a person,
exuding humanity and humour but also showing that she is punchy and can
hit hard on issues she cares about -- like women getting a fair deal at
work.
And there is another angle here, a triple mirror, another way of
looking at Lis Howell and her book. The fictional story concerns a woman
who had been a top TV producer, in management for 10 years when she was
made redundant by her former lover, nicknamed ''The Snake''. Now she is
recovering her self-confidence in the cosy editorial office of safe,
friendly, Northern TV.
The elegant woman's hand on the cover is attached to a microphone with
a golden handcuff and printed beneath this image are the words: ''TV --
It's Glamorous But Deadly''.
Lis Howell, 44 next month and after a full and varied career, knows
all about this glamorous, deadly business. She is currently director of
programmes for UK Living, the satellite and cable channel, but was
previously the first director of programmes for GMTV and the woman who
invented the F-for-Fanciability Factor and who shoe-horned reluctant
presenter Fiona Armstrong into shorter skirts and threatened to put wire
coathangers in her mouth to make her smile more.
There she oversaw the launch of the new station two years ago only to
be sacked when the station had been on air for just six weeks and was
proving itself very uncertain about how to find its feet. There always
has to be a scapegoat in circumstances like this and she was it. (''I
was there for 15 months and if I'd been that bad, you'd have thought
they'd have got rid of me sooner, wouldn't you?'') And here it is
necessary for me to point out that her book is a work of fiction, that
all the characters are imaginary and any resemblance to any real person,
living or dead, is entirely coincidental. Right, got that? There is
quite a lot of Lis in it, though.
Fired by fury, she started to write almost within the week of being
sacked, when she wasn't cleaning the oven, that is (as Kate, her
heroine, does for two days on page 11), and bearing in mind that she was
offered a job on ''Anne and Nick'' within four days -- ''so I couldn't
have been that demoralised and useless could I?''
She abandoned the cleaning quite quickly. It had been something to do
with territory, she decided, an area she could control whatever was
going on in the outside world.
She is in touch with the real world herself. She talks a lot about
''working mums'', with whose problems she is intimately familiar. She is
not one of these television executives who waft by limo from hectic
newsroom to fashionable party. She calls herself a little dumpy Northern
housewife and then pleads, only half seriously ''Oh, don't say that!''
as she sees it being written down.
She was born in Liverpool, worked as a radio and television reporter
in the North of England, then had a baby and chucked it all up to run a
rural Post Office and an adjacent restaurant in Cumbria. After that it
was back to Border Television, as the first woman head of news, and when
her team acquitted itself with commendable professionalism in the
ghastly circumstances of the Lockerbie disaster, she was offered the job
of managing editor of Sky News.
We are talking now in the Green Room of the Teddington TV studios,
before and after her appearance. There is the slightly chaotic
atmosphere of any live television programme, with guests wandering in
and out -- Paul Daniels and a willowy lady wearing too much make-up who
does horoscopes -- but there is a comfortable feel to the place.
This is the channel, initially launched as the ''women's channel'',
and although Lis Howell has moved away from that description -- not
least because 38% of the million viewers it attracts in a week are men
-- a cheerful easiness abounds which must have something to do with the
preponderance of women.
As it happens, in the gallery behind the glass screens during the live
show on which Lis Howell has appeared, the team of five on duty that day
are all women. There is a male sound engineer, ''the token man'' he
calls himself, laughing, when we are introduced, but the editor, Liz
Neeson, hastens to assure him that this is not the case. She also goes
out of her way, however, to tell me how supportive Lis Howell was of the
staff and how much easier it made her own bit of this glamorous, deadly
world.
Lis Howell was offered this job five weeks after joining Anne and
Nick. She started with UK Living in April 1993 and the channel was
launched that September. It broadcasts seven days a week, 18 hours a day
-- including two hours of a live magazine programme -- and the director
of programmes is responsible for buying in the programmes broadcast, as
well as for the live content.
And she got this off the ground and she wrote the book, too. And she
has a family to manage, her partner of 15 years and their 10-year-old
daughter, Alex. And she has started on the second book (about Cumbria).
And, not surprisingly, people always ask how on earth she does it.
''If you're mad enough, you'll find the time. I was angry, hurt,
annoyed, and it was the irritation that started me off.'' The
consequence was that the book started out bitter, twisted, and
resentful, she had to rewrite what she calls ''the bit of garbage'' she
initially produced, but it did show her that she could do it.
She had tried writing a romance before. ''It was rejected by Mills and
Boon for not being deep enough, but that was because I'm not interested
in romance. I wanted to write a crime novel about television.'' Even
though she changed the book fundamentally, however, she has not lost her
anger. The best advice she received from a friend when she was sacked
was ''Feed your rage'' and that is what she has tried to do.
''Pretending that it's all right and you can forgive and forget is a
mistake -- that makes me sound vitriolic and I'm not at all -- but so
many women get so beaten up in this life. We're all trained to believe
the 'nice girl' reaction is 'It doesn't matter. I did deserve it.' Well,
it does matter and I didn't deserve it.''
She is cheerfully unapologetic about this. She quite enjoys feeling
mad. ''The pain has never gone away and I'm making sure it doesn't
because I think it's quite productive really. What happened to me was
both horrible -- although not as horrible as real tragedy, of course --
and it was very humiliating and very cheap and I think it was also
extremely mean, but it is partly the anger about those things that
stimulate you to go on and beat it.''
Another thing she learned from the experience was how many other
people, particularly women, had suffered similarly and she found that a
huge tonic in itself. It has clearly been of some professional
assistance too. It has helped inform her approach to a television
channel which targets women, which some assume is necessarily going to
be either rather domestic, or possibly rather feminist.
Lis Howell's intention is, on the contrary, that it should be neither,
but should, rather, try to be all things to all women. Her principle
objective is that the channel must never humiliate, demean, or exploit
women -- ''that means you can put on some sexy films, but you can't put
on some issues of Question Time.'' She likes this analogy. She is
forceful in her opinions and expresses them well. She has a good natural
touch. She is, in fact, exactly the sort of person who ought to appear
more often on programmes like Question Time.

BRITAIN is to launch a new effort to save the troubled #35,000m
Eurofighter combat jet which is under renewed threat from German budget
delays.
Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman will attend a tough-talking
meeting of national armaments directors of the four partner nations --
Britain, Germany, Italy, and Spain -- next weekend.
Germany will come under intense pressure to ensure the Bundestag
Finance Committee releases sufficient funds to meet its share of
development costs.
''Freeman intends to bang some heads together because this is the most
crucial year for the entire project,'' said a senior defence source.
The committee's refusal to approve the release of enough cash has led
to disputes with German arms manufacturer DASA, part of the Daimler-Benz
group, which has seen funds dry up.
If the disputes continue, the programme will be put back and the
inaugural flight of the first Eurofighter fitted with advanced EJ200 jet
engines delayed.
''It is vitally important that we have no delays at this stage because
the four partners have to decide on production investment later this
year,'' said an industry source.
''This is the big decision -- the countries have to decide on how much
investment to make for production.''
The partners agreed in 1992 to delay the programme and cut costs after
Germany threatened to withdraw in the wake of the end of the Cold War.
However, concerns about security have risen in Germany over the past
two years because of developments in Russia -- the threat of the old
Soviet military seizing control and the possibility of the Chechnya
crisis spreading.
''The atmosphere has changed quite substantially in Germany and
attacks on military projects do not gain the support they used to,''
said the defence source.
Britain, which has a 33% stake in the programme, still plans to order
250 aircraft to replace RAF Jaguar and Tornado F3 jets.

ONE of the golden rules of golf is to ''keep your eye on the ball''.
But for about 600 greenkeepers at golf courses throughout Britain that
rule has changed.
For them it has become a case of keeping an eye on the hole! Doing
just that has paid off for Royal Dornoch course manager, Mr Robert
Paterson.
He has just become the first winner in Britain of a set of Regal golf
clubs presented by Golf Media, the company behind a unique form of
targeted advertising inside golf holes.
Golf Media, based in Westerham, Kent, has signed up nearly 600 golf
clubs to sell advertising inside their holes -- 25% of all golf clubs in
Britain. Each club gets 20% of the resulting advertising revenue.
The format is simple but effective: Golf Media supplies the club with
plastic insets. At the bottom of each inset is the advertising so
whenever golfers bend down to retrieve a ball they are brought face to
face with an advert.
And advertisers like it too. So far clients include Dunlop,
Glenmorangie, Volvo Cars, Mercedes dealers, Ford dealers, Vauxhall
dealers, British Gas and Lloyds Bank.
The success of this form of advertising ''staring you in the face''
can be seen from independent market research carried out by System 3
Scotland on Glenmorangie.
On a brand awareness test first mention of Glenmorangie soared from 9%
to 62% after playing Golf Media courses.
This resulted in the whisky firm launching a national campaign during
the second half of last year.
So where do the greenkeepers come in? Their task is to ensure the
plastic cups and advertising discs are installed according to the
schedules provided -- and kept clean.
As an incentive, the greenkeepers' verification cards go into a
monthly draw.
Robert, 31, is the first winner and at the weekend Golf Media
director, James Horlick, of Newhall, Ross-shire, travelled to the famous
Sutherland course to hand over the clubs and bag worth #500.
Royal Dornoch club manager, Mr John Duncan, said: ''There has been a
slight rumbling from some of the older members who think the ball
doesn't make the same sound when it drops into the hole. But overall the
new idea is working well for everyone.''

<TEXT>
A PAINTING depicting Robert Burns as a six-year-old has been bought by
Dumfries Museums and will be hung in the house in the town where the
poet died.
The oil painting is the work of Newcastle artist George Washington
Brownlow. He painted it in 1859, the 100th anniversary of Burns's birth
and it was exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy that year.
It eventually ended up in the Museum of Childhood at Menai Bridge,
Angelsey, which closed recently. It went on sale at a Southeby's auction
in London and was sold for #2200. Half the cost is being met by the
national fund for museum acquisitions.
The painting depicts a scene in John Murdoch's little school in
Alloway with Burns standing in front of the class. He
is wearing a long tartan shirt
and has the same distinctive
hairstyle he sported years
later in the famous Alexander
Nasmyth portrait.
Mr David Lockwood,of Dumfries Museums, said: ''The artist obviously
used his imagination. He painted Burns with a rather large head because
he would know about the cast of Burns's skull that was made in 1834 for
phrenology study. Its measurements were above average.''

<TEXT>
TAXI drivers in Inverness will be sent home if they turn up wearing
T-shirts, track suit bottoms or running shoes.
Local cabbies have backed a plan to introduce a dress code following
complaints by hotel owners.
It is expected to be implemented when the licensing sub-committee of
Inverness District Council meets on Friday.
Last night, Ian MacDonald, chairman of the town's Taxi Owners and
Drivers Association, said: ''We are definitely in favour of a decent
standard of dress.
''A few drivers have angered the proprietors of up-market hotels by
wearing all kinds of casual clobber when they arrive to pick up
visitors.
''But it's fair to say that complaints have also been received from
2-star and 3-star establishments.''
Basically, the dress code -- similar to one introduced recently in
Aberdeen -- means that male drivers should wear a collar and tie to stay
out of trouble.
It will be the responsibility of the council's Enforcement Officer to
see they smarten up.
''If anyone breaks the code, they run the risk of being sent home to
change clothes,'' said Mr MacDonald.
Shell suit trousers and jackets and collarless shirts and blouses will
in future be banned.
Garments containing logos which might be construed as offensive are
also out.
Tracksuit bottoms will not be tolerated unless they are of a
predominantly basic colour, such as black, grey or navy.
And any cabbie who sports a pair of shorts on a hot summer's day has
no chance of passing a snap inspection.
But the Taxi Owners Association is strongly opposed to any attempt to
increase the number of cabs in the Highland capital.
There are currently 100 operators, 47 second drivers and more than 70
private hire cars vying for fares.
Mr MacDonald said: ''Per head of the population, that's more than
enough. It is becoming increasingly difficult to make a living.
''Instead of working eight hours, many cars are now running for 16
hours to stay in business.''

<HEADLINE>Plants scheme to take stink out of sewage</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980107464</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPERS are planning to build a sewage treatment works which will
use a revolutionary process and also double as a wildlife sanctuary.
Instead of traditional and often smelly mechanical methods, the new
system employs the natural action of reeds and wetland plants.
The two-acre site is proposed at the village of Rothienorman,
Aberdeenshire, where developers need it to service a future housing
scheme.
It is so environmentally friendly that local planners believe the
scenic sewage works will become a haven for birds and small animals.
''It would be an area where wildlife could flourish,'' said planning
officer for Banff and Buchan Mr Gordon Mackie. ''We would expect the
area to be colonised pretty quickly.
''For safety reasons, and to prevent damage to the plants, it would
have to be fenced off, but that would have the advantage for wildlife of
keeping out predators.''
The pilot scheme at Rothienorman is based on succesful wetland
processes used in Sweden, Germany and North America.
It would be the largest of its type in Scotland, producing effluent to
such a high standard that it could be discharged straight into the
river.
Structural engineer Alan Ross said the scheme would consist of a
series of terraced ponds filled with gravel and planted.
''There is a list of more than 30 different plants which are needed
for the process. They all have their part to play,'' he said.
''The sewage is fed into the beds and filters through, being broken
down by the plants and insects until it comes out at the other end
complying with river board requirements.''
Mr Ross, of Cameron and Ross, of Aberdeen, said a wetland sewage
process would be cheaper to build and cheaper to run than a normal
sewage works.
''One of the main advantages of this scheme is that it does not
produce conventional sludge which can smell and has to be carted away,''
he added.
''The only mechanical process here is first screening the sewage for
things like plastic bottles which get down drains.''
Cormack Developments are hoping to get the approval of the region's
water services department and the district planning committee so that
the scheme can be commissioned by March.
If permission is given, the scheme will service new housing
developments and eventually take over the function of the existing
village sewage works, which is already stretched to maximum capacity.
It is anticipated that the present village population of 410 could
double in the next few years.

SCOTS MP Brian Wilson has become one of the first senior spokesmen in
the Labour Party to take the plunge and write his own version of Clause
4, in an attempt to heal the party's rift over its aims and objectives.
His intervention may be too late to stop the party's Scottish
conference voting for the retention of the present Clause 4, when it
meets in March, but his wording may become the basis of a new Clause 4
when it is debated nationally later in the year.
Mr Wilson, the MP for Cunninghame North, and a party spokesman on
trade and industry, said yesterday that his version had been seen by a
wide range of people and had gained a fairly high degree of acceptance.
It has been seen by senior officials within party leader Tony Blair's
office, who did not take issue with it.
Of course 20 further versions of a new Clause 4 could be produced over
the rest of this week, leaving Mr Wilson's contribution behind. He said
yesterday that he would not be unhappy about that, as his intention was
to stimulate debate. Equally, if enough people felt his version was what
the party was looking for, then he would be happy if it was adopted as
it stands.
Realistically, in a party like Labour, where many people like to make
a contribution, Mr Wilson's version is likely to undergo numerous
metamorphoses before appearing on the back of future membership cards.
He has taken as his starting point the fact that the present Clause 4
(4) which all the fuss is about, runs to 55 words, and has imposed on
himself a 55-word limit.
Mr Wilson's version is less contentious than the current Clause 4,
which calls for the common ownership of the means of production,
distribution, and exchange -- mass nationalisation in other words.
He wants an equitable distribution of wealth, poverty cast out,
enterprise nurtured, and the promotion of common ownership. He ends with
a plea to bequeath a better world to the next generation, which is
unlikely to find many opponents.
The wording embraces enterprise, which satisfies the Tony Blair-style
modernisers, who believe they should be better than the Tories at
getting right behind enterprise and wealth creation to create employment
and better wages.
It does not deny common ownership either, with Mr Wilson arguing that
there are some enterprises that would be best run by the state, by local
authorities, or by some form of partnership with the private sector.
Optimists in the party will hope that this may be enough to appease
many Labour members who are worried about too many party beliefs being
jettisoned.
However Mr Wilson conceded that it would not be acceptable to the
''irreconcilables'' as he put it -- the Labour members who do not want
Clause 4 altered at all.
Others will see it as simply watering down the party's current
commitments.
One leading campaigner in favour of the present Clause 4 said
yesterday that Mr Wilson's version was not strong enough -- quite apart
from being badly written.
There are 26 resolutions for the Scottish Labour Party conference in
March which are in favour of keeping Clause 4 as it is, although some
are willing to have additions to it to reflect current aspirations not
previously mentioned in the clause. Mr Wilson's version could be put up
as an amendment.
Mr Wilson's own version was penned in a brief burst of activity on a
sleeper journey to Scotland from London.
The Brian Wilson version of Clause 4:
To enhance the birthright of every citizen to fulfil his or her
potential, consistent with social justice and the equitable distribution
of wealth; to cast out poverty, nurture enterprise and promote common
ownership; cherish and advance democracy; all in order to bequeath to
the next generation a better world than the one which we inherited.

WOMEN workers could lose out in the transfer to fresh jobs when
Scotland's new local councils come into being, leading to an increase in
claims for sex discrimination, the Equal Opportunities Commission has
warned.
The commission in Scotland says that such discrimination is often
unintended, and has more to do with poor or thoughtless transfer
procedures.
Nevertheless, it could lead to a growth in industrial tribunals, where
claims for sex discrimination have no financial limit. In a recent case,
a female apprentice mechanic was awarded #24,000 because an employer
refused to recruit her because of her sex.
The commission says that the cost of defending sex discrimination
cases for local government could be substantial in terms of staff time,
legal costs, and possible compensation awards.
It claims that women, particularly black and ethnic minority women,
could find themselves marginalised during the changeover.
The commission is to hold a conference in June to discuss the way
forward for equal opportunities in the new local authorities. It also
wants the Staff Commission, overseeing the transfer, to issue guidelines
to the new authorities ensuring that their practices avoid potential
discrimination.
A recent report produced by the commission in Scotland on local
government reform, states that there is potential for unlawful sex
discrimination when there is such a large transfer of staff being
undertaken.
Most of it is unintended, and arises from a lack of awareness of the
impact of policies or practices.
With such a large transfer of jobs to the new councils, which take
over next year, the commission says there will be a temptation to cut
corners and suit people to various vacancies, which will inevitably lead
to discrimination.

AYRSHIRE Labour MP Brian Donohoe is questioning the amount of money
that new town development corporations are spending on local housing
associations bidding to take control of development corporation housing
once the new towns are wound up.
Labour is campaigning to have the corporation houses transferred to
local authority ownership when the corporations cease to exist, but the
Government would prefer local housing associations to take them over.
Mr Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, says the five new town
corporations in Scotland -- Glenrothes, Irvine, Cumbernauld, East
Kilbride and Livingston -- have spent more than #460,000 on housing
associations in their areas.
He said: ''Given that it is these housing associations which will be
competing with elected councils for the tenancies of development
corporation properties when the new towns are wound up, I think serious
questions must be asked about the role of the corporations in operating
these housing associations.''

Johannesburg, Sunday
TEN miners were killed and more than 60 wounded in clashes between
rival gangs at one of South Africa's most productive gold mines.
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa said six miners died in
fighting between hostel residents at Vaal Reefs No 8 shaft this morning.
Spokesman James Duncan described the situation at the Orange Free
State mine as calm.
Mr Duncan, who said about 400 miners had been caught up in the
battles, said mining at the shaft had so far not been affected.
Anglo American said mine security officers fired rubber bullets to
separate the rival gangs, but police had not been called in.
Mr Duncan said 21 miners, many suffering from wounds caused by clubs,
were admitted to hospital, two in critical condition.
Officials from the National Union of Mineworkers held talks with the
opposing groups after the clashes and no fresh trouble had been reported
since then.--Reuter.

Freetown, Sunday
SIERRA LEONE has told foreigners not to panic after several Western
governments advised their nationals to consider leaving following a
spate of rebel kidnappings.
However, with raids reported closer to the capital, planes out of the
west African country were fully booked as foreigners sent out their
families or left themselves.
''Everyone is rushing to get out of Sierra Leone,'' said a
spokeswomanfor one travel firm in Freetown.
Britain, the Netherlands, and Italy have advised their nationals to
leave.
At least 16 foreigners are being held by rebels, including VSO workers
Calum Murray, 25, from Lewis, and Robert D'Cruz, 30, from London. The
rebels have said the two, held since November, could be freed soon.
The army played down reports of rebel activity, saying that its troops
were in control.
''We are in control of the security situation in the country,'' said
army spokesman Major Dominic Sowa, rejecting suggestions the rebels
controlled 80% of the country.
Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF) launched its revolt in
1991 but diplomats say it has since splintered into various groups, some
with bandits and army deserters.
Sierra Leone's head of state, Captain Valentine Strasser, 28, took
power in an April 1992 coup promising to end the war.
Aid workers in neighbouring Guinea said up to 30,000 refugees had fled
there from around the northern town of Kambia, where rebels seized seven
foreign nuns on Wednesday.
There has been no word of seven other foreigners kidnapped in the two
rebel attacks on mines in the south-east in the past two weeks.--Reuter

Nairobi, Sunday
AT LEAST 67 people, including a number of children, have been killed
by armed men in a new outbreak of ethnic killing in Burundi, according
to the US Ambassador.
Robert Kruger said today that he saw the corpses on a tour of rural
areas north of the capital Bujumbura, last week, and the total number
killed was probably much higher.
The victims appeared to be members of the Hutu majority, and local
sources blamed the Burundi army, which is still dominated by the Tutsi
ethnic minority, for some of the killings -- apparently in revenge for
attacks on Tutsis.
Burundi has an ethnic pattern similar to that of neighbouring Rwanda,
where conflict between the Tutsi, the former feudal rulers of both
countries, and the Hutu majority has resulted in up to a million deaths.
Last week the Burundi Government announced plans to tighten security
after renewed killings in several areas. Moves were promised to disarm
Tutsi militias who have been blamed for many deaths.
Early last week about 50 gunmen, described by local residents as
Hutus, attacked the military hospital in Bujumbura. This led to armed
Tutsi youths launching revenge attacks and burning houses in the area.
At least 50,000 people died in Burundi in 1993 during violence after
the election of a Hutu president in the country's first free elections.

Jerusalem, Sunday
ISRAEL today extended its closure of the West Bank and Gaza for
another week and urged the PLO to use an ''iron fist'' against Islamic
guerrillas in exchange for a long-delayed pull-out of Israeli troops
from occupied land.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Ministers at the weekly Cabinet
meeting that the peace process with the PLO was at a crossroads and
terrorism had become a strategic danger.
A Cabinet communique said he empowered the treasury and police
Ministers to examine ''ways and means to achieve a separation'' between
Israelis and Palestinians.
Agriculture Minister Yaakov Tsur said the separation plan could
ultimately lead to the PLO's dream of an independent Palestinian state.
''In the long term, it will mean setting borders, removing
settlements, and indeed, the formation of an independent Palestinian
entity.''
Asked if he meant a Palestinian state, Tsur said: ''Personally, I
don't see this as the most dangerous thing.''
As the Cabinet met, police announced a first step towards an envisaged
separation -- the deployment this week of guard dogs along the frontier
with the West Bank.
Israel, still burying its dead from an Islamic suicide bombing that
killed 21 Israelis a week ago, has been reluctant to endorse the use of
police dogs, wary of comparisons with the Nazis' use of dogs to guard
Jews in concentration camps.
The communique said the closure that has kept tens of thousands of
Palestinian workers away from their jobs in Israel would continue for
another week.
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, who negotiates peace with the PLO,
told reporters after the Cabinet session that Rabin was determined to
make progress in the talks on expanding Palestinian self-rule.

Tokyo, Sunday
FORMER Allied prisoners of war joined their enemies of half a century
ago today to lay wreaths at Japan's tomb of the unknown soldier.
''It's a solemn business and something I never thought I'd do,'' said
Briton Arthur Titherington, who was a prisoner of the the Japanese army
for more than three years, mostly in a work camp in Taiwan.
''It was very traumatic. I regret to say I cried,'' he said.
Two Britons, an Australian, and an American, all interned in Japanese
prison camps during the Second World War, carried poppy wreaths with
Japanese war veterans to the Tokyo memorial -- a hexagonal roofed shrine
overlooking the imperial palace and decorated with yellow, mauve, and
white chrysanthemums.
The former PoWs seemed to have good relations with the Japanese
veterans, and said they had been frank about the brutality meted out to
Allied prisoners during war.
''We've met the enemy and there's been no trouble,'' said Sid
Tavender, who was forced to work on the Burma-Siam ''death'' railway.
''They've admitted the crimes were committed. This is what we want.''
Their fight now is with the Japanese Government, which has been
reluctant to recognise the darker events of its war. Mr Titherington
represents an organisation of former PoWs pressing Tokyo for
compensation for the malnutrition, forced labour, beatings, and minor
forms of torture they suffered.
Tokyo says the issue of compensation was dealt with finally under the
1951 San Francisco Treaty, when British PoWs were awarded #76 each.
However, on the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War,
and as Japan tries to become accepted in a bigger role in the world,
there is increasing pressure on it to come to terms with its past
atrocities.
Tomorrow the group plans to bring a case to the Tokyo District Court
claiming around #15,000 each, an amount based on the sum the US
Government awarded Japanese-Americans in 1988 as compensation for their
internment in camps.
Apart from issues of principle, Japan is worried that yielding to the
demands of some groups could lead to an endless string of claims from
victims of brutality, mostly Asians.
''I don't know the size of their budget,'' said Mr Titherington.
''What's important is the size of their heart. There has to be a token
of contrition. The government was responsible for handing down edicts
and orders that caused me great pain.''
Harry Rynenburg from Brisbane, Australia, said: ''You don't need the
money. It's just a matter of principle.''
It was not until 1993 that a Japanese Prime Minister went on record
and called the war an aggressive, colonial one. However even then
additional compensation was ruled out.
''The apologies have been very nebulous,'' said Gilbert Hair, of
Miami, Florida, executive director of the Centre For Civilian Internee
Rights. ''We want the Japanese Government to issue an official apology
to say: 'We apologise to Allied PoWs'.''
He said the meeting with Japanese veterans would help their case
against the government.
''They've admitted and apologised for the brutality they used. It was
very encouraging because it lends support for what we're trying to
achieve in Tokyo. They support our efforts against the Japanese
Government.''
Fifty years after the end of the war, many of those interned in
Japanese camps are still bitter. However, an increasing number see the
anniversary as chance for a degree of reconciliation, which today's
wreath-laying helped promote.--Reuter.

THE Pope today issued one of his strongest condemnations of
anti-Semitism and said the world should make sure it never had to cry
over ''other, modern-day Auschwitzes''.
Calling Auschwitz ''a triumph of evil'', he declared: ''Never again
anti-Semitism. Never again the arrogance of nationalisms. Never again
genocide.''
In his first public comment on the 50th anniversary of the death
camp's liberation, the Pope said Auschwitz, in his native Poland, marked
''one of the darkest and most tragic hours of our history''.
He told thousands of pilgrims and tourists in St Peter's Square for
his weekly Vatican blessing and address: ''Unfortunately however, our
times continue to be marked by so much violence. God does not want that
tomorrow we must cry over other, modern-day Auschwitzes. Let us pray

Moscow, Sunday
MOSCOW today described as ''incomprehensible'' a threat by separatist
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev to spread the Chechen war to Russian cities, and
said he had lost touch with reality.
In Chechnya, Russian forces bombarded the centre of the capital Grozny
even though a European fact-finding team was in the area to monitor
conditions seven weeks into Moscow's campaign to bring the rebel region
to heel.
Dozens of civilians clutching their meagre belongings stood on the
main road leading out of the city hoping for a lift. But most cars were
already packed and some people escaped by horse and cart.
Dudayev threatened on Saturday to take the war to Russian cities if
the Russian leadership did not halt the assault and start peace talks
within a month.
''It is no problem to burn towns,'' he told the Interfax news agency.
''For this, there is no need for tanks or aircraft.''
Moscow's reaction mixed sarcasm with biting criticism of the ex-Soviet
Air Force general who declared unilateral independence for his country
of one million people three years ago.
''His position is, to put it mildly, incomprehensible,'' a Government
statement said.
Moscow added: ''One has the impression that Dudayev has fully lost
touch with reality.

Union (AMU), which it is due to assume later this year, because of the
Lockerbie affair. Tripoli said it had refused the post because the other
members of the five-nation group were implementing UN sanctions imposed
over the 1988 bombing which killed 270 people.

MIAMI: The adoptive father of the actor Richard Burton has died in the
United States, 11 years after his son. Writer and teacher Philip Burton,
90, recounted his close and sometimes tumultuous relationship with the
star he adopted as a teenager in 1943 in his last book, Richard and
Philip: The Burtons. Philip refused to speak to Richard after he left
his first wife, Sybil, for Elizabeth Taylor. The actress, however,
encouraged a reconciliation between them and Philip said recently that
they had remained good friends since his son died in 1984.

be the extremists' first bank heist to finance their campaign against
the Egyptian Government. The robbery came a day after 18 people, 12 of
them suspected militants, were killed in southern Egypt in the bloodiest
day of the three-year confrontation with the government.

Paris, Sunday
HEAVY rain lashed much of northern Europe today, forcing thousands of
people to abandon their homes to escape rising flood waters and swollen
rivers.
At least six people were reported missing and two were dead in a third
consecutive winter of flooding in France. At least three Germans and six
Belgians have also died.
The flooding, which caused millions of pounds in damage, also hit the
Netherlands and Germany, notably Cologne's Old City for a second
consecutive year.
Another storm, one of a chain that rolled in from the Atlantic in
recent days, brought some showers today and many rivers were reported to
be levelling off. However more rough weather was predicted for
Wednesday.
In north-east France, the Meuse river reached record levels at the
weekend, triggering the evacuation of 500 people in
Charleville-Mezieres, near the Belgian border.
The rising Oise river prompted authorities to evacuate all 172 people
from a hospital in Laon, 65 miles north-east of Paris, and 70 residents
fled their homes in the town of Origny-Sainte-Benoite.
A few miles south, the Aisne river neared record levels today,
threatening about 1800 homes.
In Paris, the Seine reached 13ft above normal today, having forced the
closure of riverside expressways and causing traffic jams since last
week. River traffic, including tour boats, were shut down.
In the north-west, the Maine and other swollen rivers have kept more
than 1000 people from their homes in Angers, Redon, and the Normandy
coastal town Ouistreham.
A Ouistreham man was found dead in his garage today after drowning in
floodwater while trying to save his belongings.
In Germany the Rhine was rising today in Bonn, where the low-lying
left bank was threatened. Duisburg, the biggest inland port in Europe,
was threatened with closure owing to flooding.
Cologne's Old Town remained under about 6ft of water, though the Main
and Mosel rivers appeared to be stabilising.
A three-year-old boy drowned when he was swept by the swollen waters
of a stream near Hoexter, in western Germany.
In Holland, large-scale evacuations were under way.
''The forecast is very bad,'' said Gerard van der Zanden at the
regional emergency headquarters in Maastricht. ''As much as an inch of
rain is expected in the next day -- a week's worth for a normal
January.''--Reuter/AP.

Genoa, Sunday
AN ITALIAN football supporter was stabbed to death and 16 injured in
clashes between rival fans.
The league match between European champions AC Milan and Genoa was
abandoned at half-time with the score 0-0 after 24-year-old Genoa fan
Vincenzo Spagnolo died from a stab wound outside Genoa's Marassi stadium
before the match.
Genoa captain Vincenzo Torrente said the two sides had taken to the
field to start the second half when screaming Genoa fans urged him to
abandon the match because a fan had been killed.
''It was terrible. They yelled at me 'a kid has been killed' so (AC
Milan captain Franco) Baresi, club officials, and I met and decided not
to play because we no longer felt up to it,'' Torrente told Italian
television.
Genoa general manager Maurizio Casasco said it was impossible to
continue the match, adding ''soccer cannot carry on in this way''.
Italian soccer has been marred by violence this season. Last November,
two police officers were seriously injured in clashes with Roma fans in
the northern city of Brescia.
A police spokesman said Spagnolo died after being taken to Genoa's San
Martino hospital where at least 16 fans had been treated for minor
injuries.
''Spagnolo was attacked by a group of Milan fans and stabbed in the
chest. He died shortly after arriving at hospital,'' the spokesman said.
Spagnolo's father, Cosimo, told reporters with tears in his eyes:
''This is so absurd. A 24-year-old boy cannot die because of a soccer
game.''
Rival fans clashed outside Genoa's Marassi stadium, running away when
police arrived and leaving Spagnolo in a pool of blood. They said Genoa
fans hurled coins and other objects at Milan players during the first
half and later set fire to rubbish bins outside the stadium.
Five hours after the game was abandoned, police used tear gas and
clubs to prevent an army of Genoa fans from breaking into the stadium to
exact revenge on hundreds of Milan fans being held inside.
Police, who have detained several people but have so far made no
arrests, said they finally succeeded in dispersing the 200 or so Genoa
fans eight hours after the match began.
They said the Milan fans, many of whom were photographed and
interrogated while police held them inside the stadium to prevent
further violence outside, had been put on special buses bound for Milan
under police escort.
Milan managing director Adriano Galliani said police had assured him
the clashes did not take part between organised fan groups. ''They were
simply criminals,'' he said.
Several popular soccer television programmes were cancelled and some
commentators called for drastic measures to combat the rise in violence,
including cancelling next week's Serie A matches.
However federation president Antonio Matarrese, who has called an
emergency meeting with sports officials tomorrow to decide what measures
to take, said closing the stadiums for one week would not solve the
problem.
''Even with tears in our eyes, we are duty bound not to panic. I
understand the parents of this boy will not accept my words, but we
cannot accept that delinquents and murderers kill the game of soccer,''
Matarrese said.--Reuter.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980107496</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE beleaguered prison service was in the spotlight again yesterday,
after two private documents found their way into public hands.
The first, a memo leaked to Channel 4 written by the
service's finance director, Mr
Brian Landers, condemned management as ''totally inadequate''.
He blamed area managers for the recent jailbreaks from Whitemoor,
Cambridgeshire -- when five IRA men and an armed robber fled the special
security unit -- and from Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight.
The second apparent lapse was the discovery of the new security manual
for Parkhurst. It was discovered on Monday in an envelope discarded in
the public bar of Mildenhall greyhound stadium, Suffolk, according to a
Sunday newspaper.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats immediately seized upon the
revelations to continue their attacks on the Government's running of the
prison service.
In the memo, Mr Landers says: ''It would appear that Whitemoor and
Parkhurst have shown prison service line management to be totally
inadequate.''
Mr Jack Straw, Shadow Home Secretary, pointing to the memo as evidence
of the widening gap between pay levels causing dissatisfaction, said it
demonstrated the depth of discontent within the service and the Home
Office. Everything was now driven by performance targets and bonuses.
He added: ''Many seasoned observers say they have never known it in
such turmoil. There has got to be a re-establishment of leadership by
example. The politics of greed has been introduced and it has set
entirely the wrong tone.''
Prison Service director-general, Mr Derek Lewis, who took the job in
December 1992 at an annual salary of #125,000, plus a
performance-related bonus of #35,000 in 1994, earns twice as much as the
Prime Minister, he said.
He added that it was inappropriate to run a public service along
private sector lines and that should be ended. The security manual find
showed ''the continuing poor management and leadership is having a
knock-on effect on basic efficiency''.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alan Beith, their home affairs
spokesman, said last night: ''Michael Howard cannot persist in denying
responsibility for the effective management of the prison service.
''He is all too ready to make short-term policy changes which make
management impossible, but he seems willing to stand back while
demoralised management sinks into chaos.''
Mr David Roddan, general secretary of the Prison Governors'
Association, said it was ''extremely unfortunate'' the memo had come to
light in this way, although he had not read it.
''The comments appear to be unfortunate, naive, and taken out of
context,'' he added.
The newspaper article claimed the 25-page booklet, complete with
graphics to illustrate security techniques, was lost after being sent to
Kingston Prison, Portsmouth, for printing by inmates in a workshop.
It gives explicit instructions on methods for searching cells, when
and how roll calls are to be carried out, and the importance of denying
dangerous prisoners access to tools and ladders.
While it was at the printers, three highly-dangerous Parkhurst
prisoners escaped for several days in a high-profile breakout.
The newspaper quoted a senior prison service official as saying the
loss of the manual, containing details of the private code used by
prison staff when talking on their portable radios, was a ''disaster''
and a ''gift'' to would-be escapers.
A prison service spokesman said: ''We cannot confirm the story at the
moment, but from what we've been told this document would appear to be a
draft of a manual which outlines basic procedures at Parkhurst.

EMPLOYERS in Scotland are among the friendliest in Britain, according
to a new report.
In Scotland and the north of England, employers are more open with
their workers and more likely to delegate decision making to the lower
ranks.
Managers in London are least likely to talk to their staff about
important decisions.
Authoritarian employers, who simply announce decisions, are being
replaced with more communicative managers, says the Industrial Society
survey.
Some 42% of employers are consulting staff more than they did three
years ago and just 6% of the 580 quizzed said they are consulting less.
Banks and finance companies are the worst employers when it comes to
consulting staff, with just 26% reporting greater communication.
Public sector managers are the best, with over 50% talking more to
their workers.
An Industrial Society spokeswoman said: ''Employers are finding that
they have to consult staff about more decisions these days.
''More managers are delegating decision making in order to get the
best from their workforce.''
The Industrial Society says employee-consultation is an area employers
can no longer ignore, with EU regulations forcing some employers to set
up workers groups for the first time.
Other European rules mean firms must consult representatives prior to
redundancies and take overs.
A total of 54% of employers in Scotland report increased consultation
with staff, while in Wales it is 52%, the north of England 39%,
south-west 36%, south and south-east 34% and Greater London 32%.

CRITICS of rail privatisation have attacked the current ''barmy''
track access charging system which has made it cheaper to transport two
of ScotRail's electric trains to Derby by road, rather than by rail.
A spokesman for ScotRail yesterday confirmed that road hauliers had
massively undercut the price asked by Railtrack, the Government's
track-operating company, to move the units by rail.
The two trains cannot run under their own power and require extensive
repair work after being submerged under 10ft of water while parked at
Glasgow Central Station's lower level during the floods that struck the
West of Scotland shortly before Christmas.
The repairs contract, put out by ScotRail, was won by ABB, a
Derby-based train-building company. Under the Government's new rail
system, Railtrack has to charge train-operating companies to use its
routes.
Labour's industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said yesterday: ''This
is a clear example of the uneven playing field in which there are no
direct charges for road access, but there are for rail access. The
railways have become like the NHS on wheels, with everyone buying and
selling to each other.''
The divisional organiser of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union in
Scotland, Mr Phil McGarry, said: ''This would not have happened prior to
the Railways Act 1993. The whole concept is obviously barmy.''
Mr McGarry added: ''Before, it would just have been a case of everyone
employed under the umbrella of British Rail getting on with the job,
getting the lines cleared, and getting these vehicles there for repair
as soon as possible within the confines of the railway structure.
''Now, ScotRail, because of the economic situation, has to give the
contract to the people we are in competition with on the road haulage
side,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for Railtrack said that the Regulator set all charges
for track access, and that Railtrack had no discretion in this matter.
She added that as the two trains could not run on their own power, and
had lost the use of their braking systems, they would have had to be
towed by at least one other locomotive.
ScotRail might well have incurred three different sets of charges for
transporting the trains by rail -- the hire of locomotives from a
rolling stock company (or Rosco, as they are known) if it had none of
its own available; train crew costs; plus track access charges -- said
the Railtrack spokeswoman.
Meanwhile, Labour Party sources claimed yesterday that the Transport
Secretary, Dr Brian Mawhinney, has intervened to stop the sale of the
Red Star parcels service.
The parcels-carrying business, which uses passenger trains, was
allegedly due to be sold to a private buyer this week as the first part
of rail privatisation.
Claims in a Sunday newspaper, that Dr Mawhinney had halted the sale of
Red Star because of a row over European competition policy, were last
night backed by Labour sources, but denied by the Department of
Transport and the British Railways Board.

THE Department of Transport yesterday ordered an emergency
investigation into claims that the Channel Tunnel is open to a
Lockerbie-style terrorist attack.
European Passenger Services and Eurotunnel, the companies responsible
for passenger safety, have been told to produce an ''immediate report'',
said a department spokesman.
He said Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney had called as a matter of
urgency for a report from each of the two companies, who have
responsibility for the security of tunnel operations.
The move comes after an investigation by The Observer newspaper, which
claimed there was lax security on passenger trains and car shuttles,
leaving travellers vulnerable to bombs.
Labour's transport spokesman Mr Michael Meacher called for an
emergency Commons statement when MPs return to Westminster today.
The Observer's investigation allegedly exposed serious security
failures, despite previous assurances by ministers that the tunnel is as
safe as an international airport.
Undercover reporters made 10 trips and found their bags were not
checked or X-ray scanned at London's Waterloo station, where passengers
join the train, said the Observer.
The paper also alleged they were able to dump a large bag on the
luggage rack and leave the train before it left. The bag was not spotted
during the three-hour journey from London to Paris, it added.
Only low security locks were fitted to panels on the car shuttles and
passenger trains, The Observer claimed, and reporters opened them with a
standard valve key bought at a plumbing suppliers.
A spokeswoman for Eurotunnel dismissed the report and said: ''If we
had told The Observer what our security procedures were, they would have
realised that their article is flawed and amateur, and it would have
compromised our security.''
She declined to answer further questions.

ROY ROGERS reports as a city takes stock of the likely loss of a
traditional industry.
THE historic city of York is almost synonymous with railways -- its
workshops having provided rolling stock from the advent of steam-driven
locomotives 150 years ago.
Situated almost equidistant from where the world's first
steam-passenger railway -- the Stockton and Darlington opened in 1825,
and the Doncaster workshops which produced scores of famous locos,
including the world steam record holder Mallard -- the York Carriage
Works was set up by the North Eastern Railway Company.
Today, the magnificent Victorian station, with its steel and glass
arches stretching along 800 feet of platform welcomes travellers, just
as it did when opened in 1877.
Nearby, the National Railway Museum houses what must be the finest
collection of steam locos and other rolling stock in the world --
including the Mallard whose 126mph record stands to this day.
It is hardly surprising, then, that the good people of York are up in
arms at the prospect of losing their rail works, especially as it is the
Government's controversial privatisation programme that is to blame for
delaying orders for much-needed new rolling stock
There is little doubt that the run-down and recent privatisation of
British Coal will leave these islands heavily dependent on imported fuel
for power generation. It is just a matter of when finite gas, oil and
accessible coal reserves begin to run out in say 20 or 30 years time.
But, for railway rolling stock manufacturers the time scale is much,
much shorter and ''state-of-the art'' train-building capacity could be
lost within weeks, unless the Government acts swiftly to persuade
British Rail to confirm a much needed, and long-anticipated, order for
Networker trains for Kent Coastal services.
ABB Rail Vehicles has warned that it will have to close its York
plant, ending that city's great rail tradition, unless British Rail
reverses its shock decision of January 10 that it would not, after all,
be ordering 43 four-car Networker sets.
ABB has been steadily replacing Network South East's ancient rolling
stock for the past three to four years and a total replacement of well
over 1000 trains was proposed. But the recession hit BR hard and, last
year, it ran out of funding for new rolling stock.
The Government came up with a #150-million leasing arrangement which
ABB and Kent Coast Services ''won'' from under the noses of GEC-Alsthom
and West Coal Main Line, who wanted the money to finance new Inter-City
225s. The outline order was placed towards the end of 1993 and finally
signed early in 1994.
It is that leasing arrangement which has now come blighted by the
uncertainties of impending rail privatisation and further cuts in
Government funding. Instead of being replaced the 37 year-old Kent
rolling stock is going to have its life extended by up to a further five
years.
In a shock statement to AAB, British Rail said that there was no
commercial case for new trains at this time and that they could not be
justified until the present rolling stock was ''life expired in four to
five years time''.
ABB marketing director Mr Brian Smeeton says that the Kent order needs
to be firmed up by March for the 750 strong York workforce to remain
intact otherwise it would have to be gradually run down as the existing
workload dries up before finally grinding to a halt in October.
Another possible order in the offing comes from Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Executive which is now back in the market for 21 two-car
diesel multiple units. AAB was originally out-bid by Leeds-based Hunslet
TPL but that troubled company has now had to withdraw.
ABB intends to bid again, but even if the Strathclyde order is won,
this time it would be too little and too late to save the York factory
from closure. Only the Kent Networker order, which would provide up to a
year's work starting from March, could do that.
ABB carriage works at York and Derby and repair and refurbishment
plants works at Crewe and again at Derby plus four smaller BR repair
sites at Eastleigh (Hants.), Wolverton (Bucks.), Doncaster and Glasgow
currently being privatised are all that is left of what became British
Rail Engineering Ltd .
BREL inherited the loco and carriage works set up by the individual
railway companies which, it should be remembered were nationalised in
1948 because they were struggling.
Some 36,000 were employed in the workshops in 1980, but by the time
reprivatisation was announced in November, 1987, that figure had been
cut back to just 7500 by way of plant closures and, as with Glasgow's
Springburn works, significantly-reduced activities.
The four main sites were sold off as BREL to a consortium of Trafalgar
House ,Swedish-Swiss owned ABB and BREL employees in 1989 and last year
ABB bought out the others to become sole owners.
ABB's workforce has been reducing steadily, some 300 went from York
just before Christmas and a similar number were shed from Derby this
month, taking total UK employment to below 4,000.
However, Mr Smeeton remains adamant that ABB would stay in business,
even at a reduced ''core'' level centred on its Derby Carriage works, in
the belief that a tremendous market for replacement rolling stock will
open up within two to three years time.
If new rolling stock is being delayed, then there will be greater call
for maintenance ,repair and refurbishment of existing stock which should
see an improved workload for ABB maintenance and refurbishment works at
Derby and Crewe. Indeed ABB is looking to expand in this area and is one
of the bidders for the former BR maintenance shops including Glasgow
,Springburn.
ABB and its main UK rival GEC-Alsthom (which has the cushion of a
substantial order for London Underground traons) are eagerly
anticipating the privatisation later this year of the three rolling
stock companies (ROSCOs) in the hope that this might break the log jam
on new orders and pave the way for a structered renewal programme for
ageing rolling stock.
Unless the Kent coast order is ressurrected in the next few weeks,
York may be left with just its station,museum and memories of its major
role in the history of rail.

Chris Holme warns that sleeper users must wake up to a new reality.
PRIVATISATION could see the loss of all Anglo-Scottish trains which
give Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee and Kirkcaldy their direct links with
London.
In essence, the network would be left with a number of diesels,
probably run by ScotRail, or its successor, feeding into the fast
electric InterCity 225s from Edinburgh, or Glasgow Central, to King's
Cross.
This would be the worst-case scenario once Roger Salmon, director of
the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) announces his decision,
expected before the summer, on the minimum passenger service requirement
for the east coast main line. The franchise operator will be selected by
the end of this year.
In the present environment, noone, including the constituent parts of
the British Rail, seems to have a clue what will happen.
Existing InterCity day services are by the older 125 diesels: one each
way to Inverness and three to and from Aberdeen. In addition, Aberdeen
also has one train from Leeds and a direct link to the West of England
and Plymouth.
Those who discount the worst-case scenario point to the economic case
for the status quo. British Rail has always insisted the north routes
are commercially viable and should be maintained. The complexity of
railway economics with high fixed costs can mean it is more expensive to
terminate a service at Edinburgh than to continue it north. The
Inverness and Aberdeen routes are largely used by leisure travellers
laden with luggage. Forcing everyone to change at Edinburgh would mean a
loss of revenue for the railway.
Similarly, Opraf has insisted the passenger service requirement would
be broadly based on the existing timetable, although the new operators
would later be able to ask for changes, subject to his veto.
There is, however, a wider political dimension which will become more
apparent in the next two years. Railway links are the historic physical
embodiment of the Union.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to make a great play of
defending the Union if the various Anglo-Scottish rail services are
whittled away.
That process has already started. Opraf will not be giving subsidies
to sleeper services to Carlisle and Fort William and from Scotland to
Plymouth and the Motorail network which is effectively a death sentence
for all of them.
Opraf maintains that the money on these services, poorly used and
largely by well-off travellers, is better spent to benefit ordinary rail
users elsewhere.
The Aberdeen and Inverness lines have also suffered from two decades
of neglect compared to road spending for upgrading the A9 and dualling
the A92. In 1982, a trip from Edinburgh to Aberdeen took three hours by
car, 40 minutes behind the fastest train. Now the car journey is
routinely quicker, and the reversal in fortunes has been even more
apparent on the A9.
At that time Inverness had two direct day trains to London. Aberdeen
had five, with three overnight trains. Services to both cities have
effectively been halved. In addition, they have faced increasing
competition from airlines taking away the business market.
It is hardly a background which inspires confidence in Government rail
policy.
Former BR area manager for the North-east of Scotland, Archie Brown,
is not optimistic: ''I certainly feel that within the 12 months from
now, if not less, we will see the disappearance of the InterCity through
services.
''We will be left with a localised Sprinter express service, linking
with the electrified trains out of Edinburgh.''
Mr Brown says this is an entirely logical consequence of running the
railways for profit. The 125 diesels are twice as expensive to run as
their 225 electric counterparts and are significantly more costly on
track maintenance than Sprinter expresses used by ScotRail.
Withdrawal of InterCity trains would, paradoxically, probably mean an
increased frequency of service, since it would take four four-coach
Sprinters to maintain capacity of each 125.
What is abundantly clear is the need for a strategic view of the
network in Scotland and links south.
Within a decade, the 125 fleet will be at the end of its working life.
There are no plans for replacement which will effectively kill off
direct London links. They might also die through default, if the rolling
stock companies are offered better returns by operators of other routes.
Electrification is the solution put forward by the campaign group
Create, first between Edinburgh and Glasgow, then the Fife circle and
gradually northwards to include Aberdeen.
This has been impossible on the 8% return demanded by the Government,
although other European countries insist on 4% or less.
The alternative is a trophy all the way down the line. Every city,
town and community depends on good rail links, which must include direct
services to London, to promote basic economic development and tourism,
most of which emanates from England. This is irrespective of their
social importance.
In that context, branch-line status for Inverness, the capital of
Highlands, Europe's oil capital and Dundee now asserting itself as one
of the UK's key scientific centres, is simply not acceptable.

Nicola Reeves provides a public announcement on an uncertain
timetable.
REGULAR users of the rail network will not be surprised to learn that
the privatisation of British Rail may be subject to delay. It was always
likely to be one of the more difficult of the public-sector asset sales,
but the chances of British Rail proceeding smoothly and far down the
privatisation track will not have been helped by comments from John
Prescott, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party -- reiterating a commitment
to a publicly-owned, publicly-accountable railway.
Aside from the political dimension, there are many other sources of
uncertainty surrounding both the timing and likely scale of British Rail
privatisation. These risks include regulation and capital expenditure
issues. But, above all, the threat of franchised services being taken
back under public control will deter many potential investors this side
of a General Election.
Even if it were possible to forget about politics, one of the biggest
issues is the feasability of a loss-making, state-owned railway network
being transformed into various quoted companies in which private
shareholders are willing to invest.
However, many of the concerns surrounding the privatisation of British
Rail could equally have been applied to the bus industry. It too was in
the doldrums up to the late 1980s, but in its newly-privatised form it
has become a dynamic sector teeming with management buy-outs, takeovers,
battles over local routes, soaring profits and share prices.
Despite a fall of around one thousand million in passenger journeys
during the past 10 years, bus companies such as Perth-based Stagecoach
have made a fortune. This has been achieved by acquiring less-efficient
operators, often burdened with legacies from the public sector, and
imposing private sector disciplines in areas such as productivity and
customer service.
The same could be true for the railway industry, but the size and
scale of the British Rail privatisation is much larger than that of the
buses and there is a greater public service element to it. This makes it
more akin to the 1980s privatisations of the major utilities -- gas,
water, electricity and telecoms.
Different investors will be interested in different parts of British
Rail. The rolling stock companies who require large amounts of capital
will appeal to large internationl banks and leasing companies keen to
provide equipment finance at very keen rates. The relatively-fixed
nature of the income stream of rolling stock companies makes it less
attractive to other investors.
Venture capital companies, who traditionally provide long-term support
to small and medium-sized businesses with good management, could be
interested in investing a few million pounds. These investors will look
for discrete businesses within British Rail, such as the heavy
maintenance depots or dedicated lines, where management are able to have
a significant influence on the success of the business. The validity of
this approach was visibly demonstrated a few years ago with the
venture-capital supported management buy-out of Travellers Fare, the
catering arm of British Rail.
Given the large number of public companies with transport interests,
there could be a high level of interest, both at home and overseas, in
possible opportunities thrown up by rail privatisation.
Indeed, companies such as National Express, the UK's largest
inter-city coach company, is according to Alastair Dick, the company's
director of group planning, ''watching with close interest what
develops'' -- not least because of the potential impact it could have on
existing business. It does not currently have any specific direct
interest in any of the 25 train-operating company franchises.
However, Mr Dick says that, in principle, providing a ''sensible
financial proposition'' is put on the table, then it is ''theoretically
possible to have a rail service within our portfolio''. Mr Dick said the
company was a strong believer in the ''advantages of integrated
inter-modal transport''. It has already successfully diversified out of
coaches with the #27.1m-purchase in July 1993 of East Midlands
International Airport.
It will not be commercially viable to run mainstream services on their
present scale without an element of subsidy. The government currently
provides an annual subsidy of about #1000m to the train operating
companies. It is not yet clear that such a level of subsidy will be
forthcoming in the future, but the ability of companies to increase
revenues and reduce costs to compensate for any loss in the subsidy is
limited by regulation.
The manner in which the individual franchises have been structured
makes them less attractive to potential investors because of the lack of
total day-to-day control in running the business. Potential investors
would like the freedom to control areas such as timetables, ticket sales
and what happens at stations.
Privatised companies are no different in their fundamental business
objective from other private companies. It is their purpose to maximise
the rate of return on their shareholders' investment. In the case of the
privatised companies, as in the rest of the UK stockmarket, the majority
of shares are held by financial institutions managing the pension funds
and insurance policy investments on behalf of all of us.
As shareholders, their interests lie principally in the return they
make on their investment, through the increased value of the shares
making up their portfolio and the dividend payments they attract.
Traditionally, privatised company shares have been viewed as ''blue
chip'', subject to less risk than other investments and as such a vital
component of any UK general equity investment.
However, there are obvious risks from an investor's point of view in
the fact that the complete transfer of all British Rail's assets into
the private sector is not on the cards. There is less attraction in
investing in a business where income is contractual, such as in the 13
British Rail Infrastructure Services companies, or reliant on the
rulings of the industry regulator and therefore new management has less
control over the destiny of their own business.
In the case of Railtrack, for instance, because it is a monopoly, it
is likely to attract fairly tough regulation at least for the forseeable
future. This has already become apparent in the recent decision by John
Swift, head of the Office of the Rail Regulator (ORR), to cut access
charges by 8% in 1995-96 from current levels. This will reduce the fees
train-operating companies have to pay Railtrack to use its track by
#1500m over six years. In the five years after 1996-97, these access
fees will fall 2% in real terms.
Regulation designed to promote competitors' interests, or diminish
profitability, is likely to curtail share values and dividends in the
medium and longer term, making it less attractive to performance-driven
institutional investors.
Whilst making it less of a financial strain for new companies to bid
for franchises, the new charges will also reduce the proceeds for the
governement's coffers. Railtrack itself will hope to augment the revenue
from track fees with unregulated income. This could come from a variety
of sources such as freight company access fees and rentals and
development of its extensive property portfolio, which includes the 13
major mainline stations, including Glasgow Central, Edinburgh Waverley
and eight in London.
Its profitability will also undoutedly be boosted by increased
efficiency resulting from the significant staff cuts that have
traditionally followed a company's move from the public to the private
sector. The scope for these became apparant during the signalworkers
dispute last year when a better-than-expected service was able to be run
on a shoestring staff.
The flotation of Railtrack will be one of the more distant stops on
the privatisation journey and is not expected to take place before
Spring 1997. At some point in the dim and distant future, a Railtrack
Prospectus will be published detailing key figures such as revenues and
levels of debt, a figure which has yet to be finalised by the Government
but which is currently thought to be around #2000m.
Some of this debt may be written-off by the government. Until this
information is available, it is difficult to put a price tag on
Railtrack although it is likely to be closer to #2000m than the #4000m
originally mooted.
Merchant bankers S G Warburg have been appointed to handle the
Railtrack flotation. Fortunately for them, they will get paid whatever
the outcome of the privatisation which, as we approach the General
Election, looks increasingly likely to be derailed.

CLASSIC EastEnders episodes featuring Queen Vic favourites Dirty Den
and Angie are being shown as part of the series' tenth anniversary
celebrations, the BBC announced today.
The line-up includes the most-watched show in its ten year history, in
which Den slapped divorce papers on his wife Angie as an unseasonal
Christmas surprise.
The feuding couple, played by Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson,
catapaulted EastEnders to the top of the ratings with a record audience
of just under 30 million at Christmas 1986.
Other vintage episodes being re-run for the first time include the
October 1985 teaser which revealed the identity of gymslip mum
Michelle's seducer -- Dirty Den again.
The broadcasts are part of a birthday package, 10 Years in Albert
Square, to mark EastEnders hitting its first decade on February 19.
The package gives viewers not just the chance to see favourite early
episodes but also special programmes surrounding the anniversary.
The short season of classic shows has a Friday night slot beginning on
February 17.
The following Monday EastEnders -- The Early Days, kicks off with the
opening 1985 episode and continues with the subsequent 24 programmes
each weekday morning.
Almost 13 million viewers tuned in as the BBC1 soap began broadcasting
with the storyline about Den and friends kicking down the door of a
dying layabout's home.
''In ten short years, EastEnders has become a firm favourite in
Britain's TV schedules,'' said BBC1 Controller Alan Yentob.
''It has pioneered a bold and realistic approach to the continuing
serial form distinguished by superb writing, acting and production
values.''
Other highlights are a special documentary on February 21 reviewing
the fortunes of the families who have lived in Walford for the past
decade and a That's EastEnders quiz, in which viewers can test their
Albert Square knowledge against celebrity teams, on February 18.
BBC1's Biteback on February 12 will allow viewers to pose key
questions to people closely involved in the soap's production and Pebble
Mill on February 13 takes a behind-the-scenes look at special episodes
being shown in the anniversary week (February 13, 14 and 16).
Only six of the original cast are left in the show but this will be
whittled down to three by the end of the year with the departure of
Arthur (Bill Treacher), Michelle (Susan Tully) and Sharon (Letitia
Dean). That leaves just Kathy (Gillian Taylforth), her son Ian (Adam
Woodyat) and her ex-sister-in-law Pauline (Wendy Richard).

<HEADLINE>Hanley says Government has no role in pay deals</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LABOUR turned up the heat yesterday in the row over big pay increases
to chiefs of privatised utilities after Tory chairman Jeremy Hanley
insisted the Government did not have a role in such settlements.
Mr Hanley defended Mr Cedric Brown, the #475,000-a-year chief
executive of British Gas, saying: ''He did start with a pick and shovel
and worked his way up. What we don't believe as a party of government is
that it is our job to be selective about those wages we hold down.''
Questioned about the Government's attitude as major shareholders to
pay increases to the chiefs of the two electricity generating companies,
PowerGen and National Power, Mr Hanley said: ''Shareholders ought to
look at overall aspects of the company.
''Is the company providing a better service? I think you'll find that
in all of those organisations, they are providing a better service to
consumers. On gas, electricity, the prices to the customer are lower.
That's all part of the feel-good factor. People see privatisation has
worked,'' he told ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby programme.
However, deputy Labour leader John Prescott said: ''The fact is the
Government keeps saying that such pay rises are a matter for
shareholders but when it comes to the Government having the chance to
act they sit on their hands.''
He accused Mr Hanley of refusing to explain why the Government refused
to use its 40% shareholding in PowerGen and National Power to take
action against ''obscene pay rises''.
Mr Prescott said: ''The Government has got to answer the question why
they won't act. We will not let them get away with continually ducking
it.''
He spoke out after a survey by the Sunday Times revealed the earnings
of the highest-paid directors of Britain's leading companies have
increased by more than nine times the rate of inflation over the past
decade.
The study of the biggest 100 stock market companies listed in the
FT-SE 100 index shows the top earners now each receive an average of
#822,860 a year compared with #126,480 in 1985.

<HEADLINE>Woman's 'raped again' anguish over kidnapper's libel threat</HEADLINE>

THE woman kidnapped by killer Michael Sams, now threatened with a law
suit by him, says she feels she is being ''raped all over again''.
Sams is seeking to start libel proceedings against Stephanie Slater,
whom he kidnapped and imprisoned in a wooden box for eight days.
Miss Slater, 28, said: ''It is like being raped all over again. It is
killing me. He's tormenting me.''
Miss Slater has written a book alleging that Sams, 51, raped her
during her ordeal three years ago.
The allegations were investigated by the police and referred to the
Director of Public Prosecutions, but it was decided it would not be in
the public interest to take the claims further.
Miss Slater told a newspaper yesterday: ''Sams loves to play with
people and this is just a continuation of what happened when he
kidnapped me.
''He is sick. He has this image of himself as a master criminal
controlling people, even from his prison cell.
''I was totally in his power from the moment he kidnapped me. I was
blindfolded, handcuffed and naked when he attacked me. The memory of
that still makes me physically sick.''
Sams issued a statement yesterday from Wakefield prison, where he is
serving four life sentences for blackmailing and kidnapping Miss Slater
and for the kidnap and murder of Julie Dart, 18, a Leeds prostitute.
The handwritten note, issued via his solicitor, said: ''I deny
Stephanie Slater's allegation that I raped her.
''She did not make this allegation before or during my trial. Indeed,
she gave evidence on oath at my trial and said there was no sexual
relationship.
''I cannot allow this allegation to go unchallenged, and accordingly I
will commence libel proceedings against her in order to establish my
innocence in court.''
Miss Slater's book -- Beyond Fear: My Will To Survive -- is due to be
published on February 20 and the Mail on Sunday began serialising it
yesterday.
She was bound and blindfolded in a wooden box at Sams's tool repair
workshop in Newark, Nottinghamshire, after he kidnapped her in
Birmingham. Sams collected a ransome from police before she was
released.
At his trial in the summer of 1993 Miss Slater, who now lives on the
Isle of Wight, denied he raped her. In the book she says her silence was
motivated by shame and concern for her family.
Editor of the Mail on Sunday, Mr Jonathan Holborow, said the paper
''fully believes'' her story.
He added that the paper would also help Miss Slater's defence in court
if Sams managed to bring the case.

<HEADLINE>Historic home sale forced on de Savary</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980107506</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE historic Wiltshire home of Mr Peter de Savary is to be put on the
market by receivers.
Littlecote House, the entrepreneur's main residence near Hungerford,
is expected to have a #6m price tag.
The Tudor mansion and land at Southampton airport are two of a number
of assests of Mr de Savary put into receivership by the Standard
Chartered Bank last year.
Mr de Savary has agreed to move from the house, which he has used as a
family home as well as opening it to the public as a ''land that time
forgot'' theme park. But he maintains he owns a 94-year lease worth
about #2m.
He bought the manor house, dating from 1450, from Sir Seton Wills, a
member of the tobacco family, in 1985, and converted much of its 83
acres of parkland into a theme park.
However, at the end of last season he announced the house would no
longer be open to the public because of falling attendances.
The sale forms part of the bank's drive to recover some of the
estimated #50m plus of outstanding debts of Mr de Savary's former
company Placeton.
Last week, Mr de Savary insisted he could still buy back Littlecote if
the price was right. Although he lost a fortune in the property
recession, he insists he is still worth far more than he lost.''I came
out less rich, but I didn't come out broke,'' he said.
At Skibo Castle in Sutherland, he is developing a luxury golf and
country club set in 7500 acres, which is due to open in April. He also
owns a marina and housing complex in Falmouth, Cornwall.

DETECTIVES last night confirmed they were investigating the theft of
National Lottery ticket machines in East Kilbride.
A Sunday newspaper yesterday claimed that several machines had been
stolen before being delivered and that some were now operating in bogus
lottery outlets.
It said it bought an officially-made ticket dispenser, still in its
original wrapping, for #100 in a pub car park in the south of Glasgow.
Last night, Strathclyde Police confirmed that the computer which the
newspaper had handed over to them at the weekend was a genuine National
Lottery ticket dispenser, one of four stolen in the East Kilbride area
between December 11 and January 5.
However, police said that all four machines had been en route for
repairs and were not in working order.
Two of the dispensers had since been recovered, damaged beyond repair,
in the Pollok area of Glasgow. The third had been handed to police by
the newspaper. One machine is still missing.
According to the newspaper report, shopkeepers buying stolen machines
could make large sums by selling fake tickets to unsuspecting customers.
As the machines were not connected to the main lottery computer, the
tickets could never win.
A spokesman for lottery organisers Camelot said its security team was
conducting an inquiry and liaising with police. He knew of no other
reports of stolen machines.
Given that those machines had been awaiting repair, it seemed unlikely
that they would have been capable of printing tickets.
The spokesman added: ''Any scam such as the one alleged in the
newspaper report today, and there is no proof of it, would be very
short-lived because people would have to go back to claim prizes. Any
retailer doing this would be rumbled very quickly.''
Meanwhile, four lucky players have won more than #2m each in the
latest lottery draw.
Camelot said each would receive #2,293,628 from a jackpot estimated at
#9,174,512.
The winning numbers were 4, 16, 25, 26, 31, and 43. The bonus number
was 21.
All four jackpot winners are from south of the Border. Sixteen people
shared the five-plus-bonus prize and scooped about #176,432 each, while
1304 had five matching numbers which gave them #1353.
A total of 58,223 won #66 with four balls and 993,762 guessed three
balls right and got #10 out a total pot of #27,542,074.

THE courage and spirit shown by Guides and their leaders in Drumchapel
since last year's fatal bus crash tragedy was praised yesterday.
While the scars from the accident which claimed the lives of five
people still remained, the healing process was now slowly beginning
within the community of Drumchapel.
The victims of last September's crash, which happened when a Clydeside
2000 bus smashed into the West Street railway bridge while returning
from a Girl Guide trip to Butlin's Wonderwest World, were remembered
yesterday at a special service.
More than 300 people attended Wellington Church in Glasgow in memory
of Laura Cullen, 14, Catherine McKnight, 10, Margaret-Ann Riddick, 11,
Mary McGreskin, 39, and Rena Dougall, 47.
The families and relatives of those who died were joined by Guide
Association representatives from throughout Britain as well as members
of the various emergency services who assisted at the crash.
Mr Donald Dewar, the Labour MP for Glasgow Garscadden, was also in
attendance along with an official from the Scottish Office, Lady
Rosebery, president of the Guide Association, and Mrs Gillian Robertson,
Scottish Chief Commissioner.
The hour-long service was led by Rev Eileen Manson, former County
Commissioner for Renfrewshire Guides, who spoke of the tragic events on
Sunday,September 18.
In her address, she explained that many had felt ''confusion, anger
and despair'' after losing loved ones and friends.
The minister praised the role of the passer-by who stopped at the
accident scene to comfort the injured until the emergency services
arrived. The role and kindness demonstrated by the police, fire services
and ambulance crews were also remembered.
She highlighted also the ''immense courage'' displayed by Guides and
leaders in the Drumchapel area following the tragedy.
''The courage of the girls and leaders shown since the accident and
the support they have given each other provides a wonderful example of
the true spirt of guiding,'' said the minister.
The minister also told of the special bravery demonstrated by Andrena
Dougall, whose mother was killed in the crash. Knowing that her mother
could not be helped, she said that Andrena, who had been on the bus,
displayed immense courage by assisting many of the injured girls.
Her commitment to helping others, Ms Manson added, had been recognised
by the Guide movement, who have now awarded Andrena with its highest
honour, the silver cross for gallantry.

<HEADLINE>Adams looks for political lifeline to bolster ceasefire</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
THE surprising praise for Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams from the former
Ulster Secretary of State, Mr Peter Brooke, comes as the peace process
enters a crucial phase.
The IRA ceasefire was 150 days old at the weekend, and all the signs
are that Mr Adams has a political battle on his hands to persuade the
terrorists to maintain it.
Suggestions that some elements of the Republican movement are becoming
increasingly restless have gained ground, with many observers in Belfast
concluding that Easter is the next deadline to be passed.
In Londonderry yesterday, at a rally to mark the Bloody Sunday
killings in the city 23 years ago, Mr Adams continued his critical
analysis of the British response to the ceasefire. His speech and other
comments in the past week indicate that he, too, is worried, and
desperately needs a new political lifeline in the way of more
concessions to Sinn Fein.
Bringing Mr Adams and his party in from the cold has been a slow and
at times deeply embarrassing exercise for British officials in Belfast.
Only last week a Northern Ireland Office minister, Mr Malcolm Moss,
found himself facing the outstretched hand of Mr Adams and had to shirk
from accepting it in public, in line with ongoing Government policy.
It does seem, however, only a matter of time before the Sinn Fein
president is accorded some form of official contact with a Government
minister, just as he has already been accepted publicly and warmly by
former Irish leader Albert Reynolds and more lately, his successor John
Bruton.
But Christmas has come and gone, and the peace process appears to be
bogged down in the complexities of long meetings between British
officials and the Sinn Fein delegation.
Mr Adams is growing impatient, but probably not as much as some of his
party faithful in the border counties of Tyrone, Armagh and Fermanagh,
where IRA roots run deep and talk of compromise with British ministers
finds little or no favour.
It is former Ulster Secretary Mr Brooke who is credited with a speech
during his term of office which may have sewn a seed or two in the peace
process. In 1990, Mr Brooke said Britain had no strategic or selfish
interest in remaining in Northern Ireland. He convinced some leading
nationalists, including the SDLP leader John Hume, that London was
moving to a ''neutral'' role in Ulster.
Subsequently, Mr Hume began a series of secret talks with Mr Adams in
which he tried to persuade him that if Britain was moving towards a
policy of neutrality, the IRA should in turn review its campaign of
violence. The current Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has echoed
Mr Brooke's approach in various speeches, but Sinn Fein feels that does
not go far enough.
Mr Adams argues that the British Government must ''create the level
playing pitch essential to meanful negotiations''. In other words, he is
impatient and annoyed at the way in which the Unionists obtained
assurances from Prime Minister Mr John Major on Northern Ireland's
constitutional position within the UK. Mr Adams wants the British to
become ''persuaders'', prompting and pushing the Unionists into reaching
a new political settlement involving all-Ireland institutions.
While Unionist leaders are hardly likely to recognise Mr Adams in the
way that Mr Brooke does in tonight's Panorama programme, many of them
privately accept the risks he is taking.
No one underestimates the ruthless power of the IRA leadership and the
history of Ireland is dotted with examples of Republicans turning on
those within their ranks. At best if the current peace process does not
work out, Mr Adams's future as Sinn Fein president would be under
serious threat; at worst he could lose his life.
That said, he remains very much in control, his well groomed, laid
back image giving himself and Sinn Fein/IRA a new respectability in the
corridors of power from Washington to Dublin.
The month of February promises important developments, which could
make or break the new peace in Ulster. Somehow the Government must
strike a fine political balance between the impatience of Mr Adams and
the nationalists, and the real fears of Ulster Unionists that events are
again unfolding against them.
Last week, Mr Major had to give private reassurance to the Ulster
Unionist leader James Molyneaux, who has been warning that British and
Irish civil servants are drawing up plans to provide for all-Ireland
bodies with executive powers. Mr Major says that is not the case, yet
the bottom line for many nationalists, never mind Mr Adams or the IRA,
is that a new settlement giving Dublin an influential role is desirable.
After 150 days of peace, Ulster now faces a period of intense
political debate in which once again the age-old divided forces of
unionisn and nationalism will be brought to bear, while the IRA and
loyalist extremists watch from the wings, their guns and explosives
intact.

SOME 4000 Clydesdale Bank staff and their colleagues at the
Leeds-based Yorkshire Bank are to be balloted this week on one-day
strikes over pay.
However, following the intervention of Mr Leif Mills, the Banking,
Insurance, and Finance Union general secretary, there are to be
last-ditch talks between the union and Clydesdale management one week
today before the ballot results are declared.
Both banks are subsidiares of the National Australia Group and Bifu
blames influence from Australia for the industrial relations crisis and
has accused the group of milking the British banks for the benefit of
shareholders.
Clydesdale staff have been offered a 2.5% increase and longer hours in
spite of record profits of #110m. Yorkshire Bank's 6000 staff have been
offered 4.4% after profits of #137m to complete th group's move to
performance-related pay which Bifu maintains damages team working and
morale.
Mr Keith Brookes, Bifu assistant secretary, claimed more than #190m of
the combined #247m profit had gone to Australian shareholders and that
UK staff, who had worked hard to generate the money, deserved a better
deal.

<HEADLINE>Survey reveals what turns mild-mannered motorists into anti-social bullies 'Road rage' hits 90% of drivers</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

MOST motorists lose their temper and experience ''road rage'',
according to a survey today.
Almost 90% of the 526 motorists quizzed suffered ''road rage'' in the
past year, said the survey by the Automobile Association.
The most common reason, given by 62%, was aggressive tailgating --
another motorist driving close behind your vehicle.
Headlight flashing (59%), obscene gestures (48%), deliberately
obstructing other vehicles (21%), and verbal abuse (16%) were other
examples of bad road manners which angered drivers.
A ''worrying'' 1% of drivers reported having been physically assaulted
by other motorists, the AA said.
''Stress and fatigue turns some drivers into anti-social bullies,''
said Mr Matthew Joint, AA psychologist. ''Roadworks, congestion, and the
stress of everyday living turns otherwise mild-mannered motorists into
boorish road-hogs.''
Although 62% of drivers said they were victims of aggressive
tailgaters, only 6% confessed to having been guilty of tailgating. Women
are almost as likely as men to lose their tempers -- 54% of women
admitted to aggressive driving, compared with 64% of men.
Most motorists (62%) said the behaviour of drivers had worsened in
recent years -- a feeling shared by 73% of people aged between 35 and
54.
Almost half (45%) of motorists admitted to flashing their lights at
another motorist when annoyed with them. However, 96% of drivers said
these incidents did not affect their confidence when at the wheel.
Meanwhile, a report showed today that sexist remarks from a man to a
female motorist whose car breaks down in a television commercial for the
AA led to almost 100 complaints from viewers.
People objected to ''the use of fear'' to promote membership of the
breakdown service, said the Independent Television Commission's
complaints bulletin.
They were also concerned about ''the verbal aggression and sexist
remarks'' in the advertisement, which is still running.
''Many viewers saw the commercial as implicitly reinforcing a
patronising view of women as less capable of dealing with motoring
mishaps than men,'' said the ITC.
It shows a woman breaking down on the exit ramp of a car park and
being heckled by the attendant. The problem is solved when her female
passenger offers to phone the AA.
The ITV did not uphold the complaints in its December report but said
the advertisement came close to breaking its code, which warns against
playing on people's fears.
However, the AA is standing by its commercial. ''It was meant to
illustrate the problems that a lot of women drivers face from impatient
and aggressive men,'' a spokesman said. ''We feel it was a real
situation. We weren't condoning the aggressiveness but these things can
happen.''

A MAJOR conference on risk assessment, which is playing an increasing
role in the effort to reduce industrial accidents, is to be held in
Aberdeen this week.
One of the highlights of the conference, organised by the Robert
Gordon University Offshore Management Centre, will be the presentation
of the results of a research project into the risk perception of British
offshore workers.
The relationship between employee risk perception, attitudes to
safety, and involvement in accidents and near misses is of increasing
interest among industrial psychologists. Professor Rhona Flin and Dr
Kathryn Mearns, of the centre, will report on their survey of risk
perception in a sample of 622 offshore employees.
They measured feelings of safety with regard to major hazards,
occupational accident, and work tasks along with a number of other
variables, including attitudes to safety. They found workers had a
realistic attitude towards the risks of their job.
Dr Mearns said that in industry in general many of the dangers because
of risk from equipment had been engineered out.
''Now, in an effort to even further reduce accident rates they are
trying to look at the human factor, at the guy actually operating the
systems which they have made safe, to try to see what kind of mistakes
they make.
''When you start to get down to individuals and how they behave and
react to things, it becomes very complicated because no two people
behave in the same way in the same situation all the time.''
Dr Mearns said several eminent speakers would be at Thursday's
conference.
The research which she and Dr Flin had conducted was on how people's
perception of risk might affect whether they become involved in
accidents.
They tried to discover whether, if people underestimated risks, they
might be more likely to be involved in accidents. Or, by over estimating
the risk they might be taking more elaborate than necessary measures and
increase the chances of an accident.

MILLIONS of passengers are at risk from potentially-fatal flaws in the
seat design of hatchback and estate cars, a television programme will
claim tonight.
The rear seats of most hatchbacks and estates can be lowered to give
more luggage space.
But accidents have shown that, in head-on collisions, the catches
which hold the seats upright are not strong enough to stop luggage being
thrown forward, pushing the seats into passengers sitting in the back,
according to ITV's World in Action.
In some crashes, passengers have been left crippled or even killed,
according to the programme.

BRITISH mercenaries are propping up the oil-rich former British
possession of Bahrain, Labour MP George Galloway claimed yesterday.
Mr Galloway, MP for Glasgow Hillhead, alleges that the emirate is
currently using its security forces, staffed and trained by British
ex-military personnel, to violently suppress calls for democracy by
opponents of the ruling royal family.
The MP has called on the Prime Minister to investigate the activities
of British citizens working with the Emir's security forces, and has
tabled a parliamentary question asking for the background of some of
these men to be disclosed.
Nine people have been killed, with dozens illegally deported and more
than 1500 people detained without charge, in the Emir's latest crackdown
on pro-democracy opponents.
''When you look at the state's population and realise it's the same
size as Glasgow, you realise this is repression on an extremely severe
scale,'' Mr Galloway said last night.
Bahrain, linked to Saudi Arabia by a causeway, was given its
independence from Britain in 1973, when a parliament was set up. This
parliament was closed on the orders of the ruling royal family in 1975,
Mr Galloway claimed last night.
Sporadic uprisings agitating for the return of this parliament, with
the latest beginning in December last year, have met with savage
treatment, he added.
He will table motions in Parliament this week drawing attention to the
events in Bahrain.
Meanwhile, a site west of Hebrides was one of four where deadly
chemical weapons and their contents were dumped after the Second World
War, Armed Forces minister Nicholas Soames has revealed.
Dr David Clark, the Shadow Defence Secretary yesterday demanded an
immediate scientific tests at four sea sites.
In a Parliamentary answer to Dr Clark, Mr Soames said that the UK
disposed of about 120,000 tons of UK chemical weapon munitions, bombs,
and shells, mainly filled with mustard and phosgene gas, by deep sea
dumping from 1945-49.
Dump sites were located:
* Between 50 and 100 miles west of the Hebrides.
* 80 miles north-west of Northern Ireland.
* 250 miles south-west of Land's End in the Western Approaches.
* In Beaufort's Dyke in the North Channel.
An additional 25,000 tons of residual UK munition stock and ex-German
Second World War aerial bombs, containing the nerve agent Tabun, were
sea dumped in the Atlantic from 1955-57.
Mr Soames, Minister with responsibility for arms control and
disarmament, insisted: ''Current scientific evidence indicates that such
CW dump sites present no significant risk to human health or to the
marine environment.
''Sea dumping was considered to be the safest and most practical
disposal method at the time. The majority of munitions were sealed
within redundant cargo vessels, which were then scuttled.
Dr Clark, MP for South Shields, said: ''Clearly we now have the
scientific knowledge to know better than to have disposed of these
chemical weapons at sea.
''They are the real 'nasties' of chemicals and it is imperative that
we monitor any after effects. After this period of time, the chemicals
may be escaping from their containers and we need to know.''

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S smallest police force is setting up a mobile response unit
in a bid to crack down on late night street disorders.
The unit will cover Annandale and Eskdale where there has been a
growing number of incidents in recent months.
Inspector Joe Menzies of Lockerbie, who is in charge of the
six-officer unit, says it will patrol the streets and maintain a high
profile.
''If the need arises they will move swiftly across the division to
attend incidents, but they will work mainly on foot and will not just be
driving around the towns and villages,'' he said.
He added that tackling street disorders was one of the main
priorities, and he appreciated the concerns from the public in relation
to problems of this kind.
In recent months there have been incidents in towns such as Moffat and
Annan, and the new unit will be able to move swiftly to aid normal
police patrols.
''The response unit, mostly six officers or more, will concentrate
their attention mainly on foot in populated High Street areas through
Annandale and Eskdale and will, hopefully, provide an effective police
presence and serve as a deterrent against public disorder and violence.
''I don't want to alarm local residents by this measure or consider it
to be a heavy handed one, as it is not.
''It is one of our police area objectives for this year, which has
been taken to reassure the public that we will continually be doing all
we can to reduce the level of street disorder,'' said Inspector Menzies.
The unit will operate for a trial period through the winter and
spring.

<HEADLINE>Report reveals role of smoking in fire deaths</HEADLINE>

MORE than a third of deaths in house fires in the UK are caused by
smoking, claims a report published today -- with Fife rated seventh
worst.
Latest Home Office and insurance industry statistics reveal an
increase in 1993, the most recent year for which figures are available,
said insurance broker CGA Direct, pointing out that the overall number
of domestic fires caused by smokers' materials had shown a
''disturbing'' rise.
The worst area was South Yorkshire, where the percentage of
smoking-related fires was more than three times the rate in Somerset,
which had the lowest rate.
But Fife was rated in the top ten. The survey claimed that from 613
fires, 81 were attributable to smoking.
Later, however, a Herald check of the 1993 report by Fife Firemaster
Robert White, showed that according to his figures, 70 fires were
smoking-related, caused either by discarded cigarettes or pipes.
The biggest single cause that year was chip pan fires, totalling 141,
while wilful fire raising accounted for 255 call-outs.
Yesterday, a senior officer at Fife Fire HQ in Thornton said he was
dismayed by the report, because the firemaster is on record stating that
the home environment could be extremely hazardous, particularly when
careless practices were common.
The department has an ongoing campaign reminding householders about
the precaution of installing smoke alarms -- and will this week commend
a 79-year-old Dunfermline woman, Mrs Ina Renny, who saved a 90-year-old
neighbour, Mrs Mary Gray, when fire broke out in her home at Castleblair
Park last week.
Mrs Renny will receive a commendation, and a smoke alarm. Ironically,
she did not have one, but as a key holder for her neighbour was alerted
when her neighbour's community alarm was triggered into the region's
social work department emergency system.
Fife Fire and Rescue Services divisional officer Duncan Collingwood
said: ''The possibility of household fires being related to smoking is
one of the first things we look to during investigations.
''Smoking-related incidents are a continual concern, which is the
reason for our ongoing campaign about vigilance in the home, and the
benefit of fitting smoke alarms.''
Mr Richard Hill, chief executive of CGA Direct, said he was concerned
by the trend.
He said: ''The true number of smoking-related fires is actually much
higher than the figures suggest, as official statistics only record
fires attended by the fire brigade.
''As brigades are only called to between 8% and 12% of household
fires, it is quite likely that there are around another 60,000 less
serious fires caused by smoking.''
Figures show that in 1993, smoking caused 6165 fires, killing 172
people, and injuring more than 2000.
The annual cost to the insurance industry is said to be about #20m,
but CGA Direct said they could offer no explanation for the variation in
regional figures, or the general rise in smoking-related blazes.
* Percentage figures for Scotland put Fife at 13.2 for smoking-related
household fires, while Strathclyde showed 9.6%, Lothian and Borders
12.5%, Grampian 12.2%, and Tayside, 12.3%.

THE principal of Aberdeen University has expressed deep concern at the
extent of student hardship.
Professor Maxwell Irvine, in an address to the institution's general
council at the weekend, said that up to 30% of the university's students
were suffering severe poverty. Mature students and those from low income
families were particularly vulnerable.
''This clearly works against the policy of encouraging wider access to
higher education and making the opportunity available to all social
sectors in the community,'' he said.
Professor Irvine highlighted the ''worrying trend'' of students who
needed to take on term-time jobs, with more than half of Aberdeen's
undergraduates in part-time employment.
Many felt they had to work for more than six hours every week, the
point beyond which the job had a detrimental effect on their studies.
''Late night working in bars and restaurants is not compatible with good
academic performance the morning after.''
Meanwhile, the Principal of Glasgow University has questioned the
wisdom of continuing to expand the number of students in higher
education.
Sir William Fraser told a weekend meeting of the university's general
council that a close examination should be made of Britain's entire
post-school educational structure.
''The truth is this. The Government can decree that the country's
universities will provide mass education, or it can decree that there
shall be no fall in the quality of higher education.
''What it cannot have is both quality and mass higher education
without a greater flow of funds -- not necessarily from the taxpayer --
into the universities,'' he said.

FOUR Weddings and a Funeral scooped a trio of top film awards last
night, making it a leading contender for the Oscars.
Its star Hugh Grant took the Peter Sellers award for comedy in the
Evening Standard British Film Awards just days after picking up a Golden
Globe in the US for the same role.
His co-star Kristin Scott-Thomas won the best actress award for her
role in the film, which was also named best screenplay.
The movie was one of the outstanding hits of last year and has taken
more than #160m worldwide.
Mr Grant received his prize from American actress and writer Rita
Rudner in Los Angeles, where he is making a new film.
Ben Kingsley, who won an Oscar for Gandhi, was named best actor for
his performance as the Jewish accountant in Steven Spielberg's
multi-award winner Schindler's List.
The awards were announced at a celebrity dinner at London's Savoy
Hotel. There was a special award for film veteran Sir Alec Guinness, 80,
which was presented by the Duchess of Kent.
The star of British films, including Kind Hearts and Coronets and The
Lavender Hill Mob, was described by Dame Diana Rigg as ''the highest
exemplar of his art''.
The best film award went to Jim Sheridan's In The Name Of The Father,
which starred Daniel Day-Lewis as one of the acquitted Guildford Four,
Gerry Conlon.
It beat other contenders, including Lord Attenborough's Shadowlands,
Ken Loach's Ladybird, Ladybird, Brian Gilbert's Tom and Viv and Iain
Softley's Backbeat, the story of the early days of the Beatles.
However, Backbeat gained Ian Hart the most promising newcomer award
for his performance as John Lennon. He shared the award with Gurinder
Chadha, director and co-writer of Bhaji on the Beach.
The best technical achievement award went to producer Richard
Hutchison and director Dave Borthwick for their film The Secret
Adventures of Tom Thumb.
* CULT film-maker Quentin Tarantino, who has made his name with
violent films, has turned to comedy for his latest movie venture.
But the Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs director has not ruled out
further gory films.
British Actor Tim Roth, who has featured in both Tarantino's films,
stars in Four Rooms, as an inexperienced bell boy left in charge of a
hotel on New Year's Eve. The director revealed.
Oscar-tipped Tarantino, regarded as Hollywood's hottest newcomer, is
collaborating with three other young film-makers on the project, he told
an sell-out audience at London's National Film Theatre, where he
delivered the Guardian lecture.
''It's a comedy which follows Tim Roth into four different hotel rooms
-- each room he goes into is directed by someone different,'' said
Tarantino.
He said people had been asking him to leave violence out of his next
film to avoid being pigeon-holed.
''Maybe I will have violence in, maybe I won't,'' shrugged Tarantino.
''Say I come up with another film and it's a violent crime thriller,
am I not going to do it because I have done two crime films before?
''I'm not going to put that pressure on myself.''
However, Reservoir Dogs has been refused a British video certificate
and Pulp Fiction, starring John Travolta as a ganster hitman, could
suffer a similar fate because of stomach-churning scenes.

A WIDOW was found murdered in her bed at the weekend.
Mrs Luigia Fiori had been strangled and suffered severe injuries after
being beaten about the head. Detective Superintendent Keith Ford told a
news conference it was one of the worst murders he could recall in 27
years on the force.
The body of the 68-year-old Italian born widow was discovered at her
#250,000 bungalow in the Wembley area of north west London by her son,
Antonio, after he rose at 6.30am on Saturday to watch Test cricket from
Australia on TV. He later realised his mother had not stirred.
He had returned on Friday night to the detached mock-Tudor bungalow in
Barn Rise, Wembley, he shared with his mother, after going out with his
girlfriend.
''His mother was awake at the time, they had a conversation, and Mrs
Fiori retired to bed about 1am,'' Mr Ford said.
When his mother had not wakened by 9.30am, he became concerned. ''He
went into her bedroom, some way from his, and found her dead,'' said the
officer.
He added: ''There are signs that a window has been forced in the
exterior of the premises, and this may or may not be the point of
entry.''
He said there was no sign of anything having been stolen.
The Fiori family was believed to have connections with the restaurant
business.
Neighbours said there had been burglaries in the area, a suburb not
far from Wembley stadium.
One neighbour said Mrs Fiori had lights at the front and rear of the
house and an alarm system.
Another neighbour said a whole pane of glass had been removed, rather
than broken.
''The pane had come out and was resting against the bay window,'' he
said.

THE Liberal Democrats have accused the Tories of putting nearly 10p a
litre on petrol in extra taxes over the past three years.
Petrol duty has risen from 27.79p a litre in 1992, to 36.14p (up 30%),
and when VAT was added, it left motorists paying almost 10p more in fuel
tax, the party claimed.
In the Budget, enshrined in legislation under the Finance Bill, the
Chancellor announced car vehicle excise duty would go up #5 to #135, and
petrol duties would also rise.
Today, in a bid to amend the Bill, which enters its committee stage in
the Commons, the Lib Dems will put forward an alternative scheme
favouring those running more fuel-efficient, environment-friendly cars.

SIR Alec Cairncross, the Chancellor of Glasgow University since 1972,
is to retire from the post early next year.
The distinguished economist, a Glasgow graduate, and former professor
who is now 83, announced his decision at a meeting of the university's
general council on Saturday.
Sir Alec said yesterday from his Oxford home that he had delayed his
retirement by a year to facilitate the installation of the university's
new Principal, Professor Graeme Davies, who will replace Sir William
Fraser in October.
The election of the new Chancellor, by all graduates and staff, will

THOUSANDS of skiers flocked to the slopes yesterday to take advantage
of heavy weekend snowfalls which brought fresh cover to all of
Scotland's winter-sports centres.
The biggest turnout was at Glenshee where a capacity crowd of 6000
made full use of the 19 lifts operating.
Mr David Stewart, of Glenshee Chairlift Company, said: ''This is by
far the busiest we have been this season. It is quite windy, with gusts
up to 40mph, but that is not stopping skiers enjoying themselves''. The
centre attracted 3500 skiers on Saturday.
All lifts and tows were operating yesterday at Nevis Range on Aonach
Mor, near Fort William, for 1500 skiers. All the runs have a good cover
of fresh snow but freezing fog cut visibility on the higher slopes and
temperatures stayed below 0C all day.
There was a crowd of 3500 on Cairngorm, near Aviemore, where
temperatures did not rise above -2C, with plenty of fresh snow on the
slopes. Most lifts were operating but 20mph to 30mph winds restricted
access to some upper pistes.
BBC chef Gary Rhodes also braved the chill to film part of his new
televison series, Rhodes Around Britain, on the hill. Swapping chef's
whites for a kilt, he served up whisky and honey ice-cream for surprised
skiers.
All runs were complete at the White Corries Centre in Glencoe where
the slopes were very busy although freezing fog cut visibility at higher
levels.
There were heavy snow showers thoughout the day at the Lecht Ski
Centre, where all runs were open in light winds. However, only a few
hundred people were on the slopes because deep snowdrifts had blocked
the A944 access road from Strathdon.
Skiers can expect a bright, sunny start at all ski centres today,
following a hard overnight frost, which could see temperatures dip as
low as -10C. Later in the afternoon, southerly gales will blow in
blizzards and the snow will turn to rain at lower levels.
The outlook for the rest of the week is unsettled but there is
unlikely to be much of a thaw on upper slopes.
Meanwhile, flooding hit Wales and England yesterday after torrential
rain. Hundreds of acres of farmland around Welshpool and thousands of
acres around Shrewsbury were under water after the Severn burst its
banks.

THE Government has been accused of ''ideological madness'' in
undermining the work of a key National Health Service division in
Scotland.
According to union officials this is leading to job losses, the
potential loss of millions of pounds in savings, and could possibly put
lives at risk.
The public service union Unison is fighting changes being introduced
at the supplies division of the Common Services Agency, which until now
has been responsible for supplying new hospitals and extensions with the
#200m worth of equipment every year.
From April, health boards and hospital trusts will be responsible for
their own ordering, and will not necessarily have to go through the
supplies division.
If they do so, they will have to pay a fee for its work, at present
the expertise is supplied at no additional cost.
In anticipation of a drop in work, the division has announced that 37
of the current 106 staff are to be sacked, with many of the job losses
to fall on the Glasgow office. This follows on from a loss of 30 jobs
last year.
Managers at the supplies division concede that the changes could cost
the taxpayer money. At present #26m a year in savings are made, mainly
through the division being able to negotiate substantial savings because
of its large buying power.
Individual hospital trusts are unlikely to achieve anything like the
same discount.
In addition, the division's science and technology branch investigates
defects and hazards in equipment and then immediately informs hospitals,
health boards, doctors, and dentists. Any diminution of this work, could
endanger patients' lives, says the workers' union.
Unison's senior regional officer in health care in Scotland, Mr Jim
Devine, described the changes as ideological vandalism with the
potential to put patients' lives at risk.

THE parents of a Scots Guardsman who stood trial for murder following
a shooting in Belfast called on the Prime Minister to intervene in their
son's case last night.
And they added their voice to the campaign to free Private Lee Clegg,
the paratrooper jailed for the murder of a joyrider in Belfast.
Guardsman Mark Wright, 21, has been held in Army custody in Windsor
for more than two years since the incident during a foot patrol in
September 1992.
Father-of-two Peter McBride, 18, was shot twice in the back after he
ran away from an Army patrol that had been questioning him.
Wright, of Arbroath, and co-accused Guardsman James Fisher, 26, from
Central Scotland, are still waiting on a verdict after last year's
murder trial in Belfast.
The soldiers said they opened fire because they believed their lives
were in danger and Wright said that he believed McBride might have been
holding a coffee jar bomb.
Yesterday Guardsman Wright's father Douglas, 46, said: ''We're not
giving up hope. We want something done about this. We want the Prime
Minister to take it up.''
''We think it's ridiculous that we hardly ever see our son. It's a
long way to travel.''
Mother Isobel said: ''Waiting for the verdict is the worst possible
torture. It has been a two-year living hell. We can only pray it ends
soon.''
And Mr Wright added: ''I feel he has had to stand trial accused of
murder simply because he did his job. Mark would not have shot at anyone
unless he genuinely felt his life was in danger.''
His family is furious that the young guardsman was refused ''open
bail'' to come home for Christmas, and had to have four guards with him
when he attended his grandmother's funeral last year.
Mrs Wright, who also has two teenage daughters, explained that the
publicity surrounding Private Clegg would help to put the dilemma of her
son into the spotlight.
''We wholeheartedly back the campaign to free Lee Clegg. I signed his
petition last week.''

BRITISH Gas chiefs were at the centre of a new row last night after
scrapping a scheme enabling its employees to give small sums to
charities directly out of their pay packets.
An MP attacked the move by the company -- which has come under fire
for awarding its chief executive Cedric Brown a #205,000 annual pay rise
-- as ''disgraceful'' and ''penny-pinching''.
But the company hit back, saying only small sums were affected, and
they could no longer be deducted because of high administrative costs.
The protests came when BG, with a workforce of 42,000, wrote to scores
of charities telling them the job of deducting small sums from pay
packets was ''too costly and impractical''.
Barnsley Labour MP Eric Illsley said: ''It is a disgraceful decision.
''Just a year after the Government was telling me it wanted to extend
the system, we now have one of the biggest companies, which has caused
one of the biggest controversies in politics, saying they are ending the
system.''
The letter, sent out by R F Kenyon, director of personnel and supplies
at British Gas Support Services, said: ''The decision has been taken by
the company that it is too costly and impractical to continue the range
of deductions which are currently administered by existing payroll
systems and all but essential deductions will be ceased.''
But British Gas later claimed the letter was ''misleading''.
A spokesman said: ''New payroll systems are being installed. Because
of the high administrative costs, we are rationalising deductions but
retaining facilities for the Give as you Earn scheme which attracts tax
benefits for charitable donations.''

WILLIAM Dennis stared through the smashed front window and braced
himself for another night of misery and danger.
His wife and their five children share his fear of darkness as it
inevitably signals the beginning of yet another long night in the reign
of terror directed at them.
In the last year, the family has been regularly subjected to an
onslaught of attacks on their council home in Drumlochy Road, Ruchazie,
Glasgow.
Their ordeal has included windows being frequently smashed with
bricks, resulting on one occasion in three-year-old Lesley receiving
cuts after being showered in glass, wine bottles being thrown at the
front of the house, the front and rear doors being kicked in, and also
excrement being pushed through the letterbox.
Mr Dennis, 29, a part-time worker, and his wife Anne-Marie, who is
expecting another child in July, remain totally bewildered as to why
they are being subjected to such vicious attacks.
''We don't have a clue as to why they are doing it -- and why us,'' Mr
Dennis said yesterday. ''We haven't done anything wrong and get on with
virtually everyone in the neighbourhood.
''The attacks started more than a year ago and haven't let up. Since
Christmas our front window has been smashed five times and the glass
panels on the front door have been kicked in several times.
''My wife and I are absolutely terrified and live in fear for our
lives. The kids are also scared to go to their beds for fear that
something else will happen. We have tried repeatedly to find out why
they are doing this to us, but nobody seems to know.
''So far, it would appear that we are only ones who have been singled
out for this abuse. It is frightening and we just want it to stop.''
Mr Dennis, who has lived in the Ruchazie area for eight years, said
the late-night attacks are being carried out by groups of men, possibly
in their early 20s.
''We believe that they live locally but, up until now, the police have
been unable to catch them. We just hope to God that it will all stop
soon and let us get on with our lives,'' he said.
Despite the problems, the family does not want to leave the area.
''We are settled here and don't want to go anywhere else,'' Mr Dennis
said.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman confirmed yesterday it was aware of the
reign of terror being directed at the Dennis family. He said: ''There
have been a number of incidents at this address and we are currently
looking into them.''

AN American serviceman was killed in a shooting accident in Angus at
the weekend, the second such incident in two days.
The serviceman, part of a US military force based at the
communications centre at RAF Edzell, is understood to have been on a
''rough shoot'' for crows, rabbits, and other wildlife.
His young son and an American colleague from the base were walking
with him in Inglismaldie Wood, Edzell, when the accident happened about
noon on Saturday. Both men were said to be experienced shots.
Security officers from the base were first at the scene and Grampian
detectives were called in.
Unconfirmed reports say the victim's friend fell and his shotgun was
accidentally discharged.
But police are also understood to have investigated reports that the
fatal shot was a pellet which ricocheted off a tree.
A police spokesman said last night: ''It appears to have been a tragic
accident. It has been established that there were no suspicious
circumstances.''
He said a report would be sent to the procurator-fiscal and referred
all further inquiries to the military base.
A US military official said no information on the dead man, who was
married with two children, would be released until today. His widow and
children were being comforted by friends.
His death came the day after a farmer was killed in a shooting
accident as he was about to help cull deer on on the Dalnawillan Estate,
owned by Viscount Thurso, the Lord Lieutenant of Caithness. A rifle
accidentally went off as the farmer and a keeper were loading guns
before stalking at Ben Alisky.
Mr Henry Sinclair, 44, a married man, from Mountpleasant Farm,
Halkirk, near Thurso, was taken to Caithness General Hospital, Wick, by
a helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth, but was found to be dead on arrival.

<TEXT>
AGRICULTURE parliamentary secretary Angela Browning yesterday
successfully completed the first round of her European round-robin trip
to gain backing for an EU-wide ban on veal crates.
Mrs Browning described her meeting with Germany's official state
agriculture secretary Dr Franz-Joseph Feiter as ''very constructive''.
Her comments came as animal activists disrupted shipments of cattle to
and from Ireland at the Welsh port of Holyhead.
She went to Cologne to win support from Germany in Britain's bid to
prevent veal crates and control live animal exports.
The subject has leapt to the top of the political agenda in Britain,
with mostly-peaceful demonstrations around the country aimed at
preventing animal exports.
Over the next few weeks Mrs Browning will also visit Italy, Spain,
Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands and Portugal before a council of
ministers meeting on February 20.
Senior officials will lobby other EC countries, except for France,
whose minister is visiting Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave next
week.
Germany, which implemented its own veal crate ban at the beginning of
the year, is seen as understanding the British stance. However, other
countries, particularly those in southern Europe, are known to be far
less sympathetic.
Mrs Browning said: ''The Germans are very good allies to have on
board. We don't want to be seen as an isolated country in all this.
''Almost certainly the countries in the southern Mediterranean have a
culture that goes back centuries and they look at animals in a different
way.
''But I feel we are gaining some ground in that people are beginning
to understand why we take the view we do,'' she said.
She was particularly keen to win over Spain and Italy, which takes on
the EU presidency after the current holder, France.
* At Holyhead, Anglesey, protesters blocked two incoming cattle wagons
but later allowed them to pass ''to avoid further distress'' to the
animals.
One lorry bound for Ireland had still not boarded the B &amp; I Ferries
ship last night after being blockaded by the protesters.
A North Wales police spokesman said there were ''20 to 30'' protesters
at the harbour. There were no reports of violence.
He said the demonstrators were assured by police that the cattle were
destined for breeding purposes.

<HEADLINE>Plea for independent inquiry is turned down.  New Lockerbie evidence fails to sway Major</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister has turned down a plea from the father of one of
the Lockerbie victims to hold an independent inquiry and to find a
neutral venue for the trial of two Libyans who have been accused.
The decision was made after he received a letter detailing new
evidence pointing to Palestinian involvement in the bombing.
In a confidential letter to Mr Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd last month, Dr Jim Swire claimed that a number of Syrian-backed
terrorists had been arrested by German authorities near Frankfurt and
then released without their bomb-making equipment being confiscated, two
months before the Lockerbie disaster in 1988.
Dr Swire, spokesman for UK Families Flight 103, which represents
relatives of the Lockerbie victims, yesterday released his letter to The
Herald and expressed his disappointment that Mr Major had not agreed to
his request.
He said there was now further evidence that Iranian-financed and
Syrian-backed terrorists had been in Frankfurt two months before
Lockerbie.
Dr Swire's letter, written on the sixth anniversary of the Lockerbie
disaster, corroborates claims made yesterday in the Sunday Telegraph
about a group of 14 people, a number of them known terrorists, who were
arrested before the Lockerbie bombing. Dr Swire questions the German
authorities role in providing support to the police from Scotland
investigating the disaster.
Mr Major's private secretary replied to Dr Swire saying: ''I can
assure you that the Government remains committed to obtaining justice
for all the victims of this terrible crime. But it remains the Prime
Minister's firm view that given all the investigations and inquiries so
far held, and because of the crucial need to avoid the danger of
prejudicing a criminal trial of the two accused, a further inquiry
should not be held.''
Reports published yesterday suggested that among the terrorists
released by the Germans was Marwan Khreesat, a Jordanian bomb-maker
believed to be the best in the world at that time, who had a primed bomb
similar to the one used to blow up PanAm 103 in his car at the time of
his arrest.
The German authorities found an explosive devise with a pressure
switch, suitable only for detonating on board an aircraft, but only
charged two out of the 14 they arrested -- known terorists Abdel
Ghadanfar and Hafez Dalkamoni -- with trying to blow up an American
troop train, said Dr Swire.
The other 12 were released, together with the bomb-making equipment,
because a federal judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to press
charges. Among those released was Khreesat who had been staying with
Dalkamoni at Ghadanfar's flat in Germany at the time of their arrest.
According to reports yesterday, Ghadanfar confessed that he had set up
a terrorist ring to bomb key targets in Europe and that Khreesat was the
group's specialist bomb-maker.
Dr Swire said yesterday: ''The Germans did not discover the rest of
their cache of bombs till the middle of 1989 and they arrested six guys.
This was the most efficient known terrorist group based in Syria and
they set them free, mostly without charge. Two months later, along came
the Scottish CID, asking 'Can you help us?'
''The Germans showed them documents saying that the device started its
journey in Malta, but there is good evidence to suggest that the
positioning of the bomb from Malta to Frankfurt is flawed evidence. A
document from the FBI says that the FBI could not find that the device
came on Air Malta.''
He said: ''I am beginning to wonder whether there is a Libyan
connection at all. It is incredible that the Government position can be
correct -- that junior Libyans working for the airline are responsible.
The evidence seems to be disintegrating by the week.
''Someone would have had to put them up to it. When the Germans
released these men, they set free the most expert terrorist group in the
world without confiscating their weapons.
''What was the quality of the evidence that the German authorities
gave to the criminal investigation by the Scots? Did they mislead them?
Did they do it deliberately?'' he asked.
Dr Swire, in his letter written on December 22 to Mr Major and Mr Hurd
on the sixth anniversary of the murder of his daughter Flora, wrote:
''You will already have access to details of the extraordinary behaviour
of the Germans towards a group of Syrian terrorists arrested near
Frankfurt in October 1988.
''Their failure to charge those men with attempting to blow up an
aircraft, and even more amazing their release of them without even the
confiscation of their explosive devices first, might at least give pause
for thought about the key supportive role that they are said to have
played in the criminal investigation into Lockerbie''
Dr Swire pleaded in his letter with the Prime Minister and his Foreign
Secretary to allow the truth about Lockerbie to come out.
''I hope therefore that you will consider the words of the attached
challenge very carefully. To seek a genuinely fair 'neutral country'
trial now would be one way of extricating oneself. To order an impartial
inquiry into the role of UK intelligence would be another. You have the
power to ask the Lord Advocate to search out an alternative to the
stalemate which currently exists over a trial.''
Dr Swire and other members of the UK Lockerbie Families group have
since launched a petition to the European Parliament asking it to
request a statement from the European Commission over the Lockerbie
bombing.
Yesterday he asked individuals to write to him on a postcard at
Caspidge House, Pikes Pool Lane, Bromsgrove, saying: ''I support the
Lockerbie petition to the European Parliament'', giving their names,
addresses and nationality by the end of February.
Along with other members of the group, Dr Swire will watch an
adjournment debate on Wednesday when the Labour MP Tam Dalyell will call
upon the Foreign Secretary to set up a commission of inquiry with powers
to investigate all aspects of the disaster.

RUGBY Union faces the greatest upset in the history of the game. The
New Zealand Rugby Union looks likely to press for repeal of the amateur
regulations which have been the cardinal rule of the sport since the
International Board was set up in 1886.
The amateur laws of the game have been under severe threat during the
past decade with widespread allegations that players, particularly in
the southern hemisphere, are being paid.
Mr Freddie McLeod, one of two Scottish representatives on the IB, said
yesterday that if the New Zealand proposal were successful and players
at all levels of the game became eligible for payment, the club
structure in Scotland would be severely affected.
''If this goes ahead then I would worry for our club game. The club
structure here would be decimated,'' he said.
''I could see our top players going to clubs that would be able to pay
players over and above the incentives that they already give in the form
of jobs, cars and all the rest of it. So I can see our top players
drifting away to clubs in England or Wales.''
He said that it might well be the case that there would have to be
changes after this year's World Cup in South Africa.
At the weekend the NZRFU unanimously accepted a recommendation from
its amateurism sub-committee to urge the International Board to repeal
the game's amateur regulations.
According to reports from New Zealand, NZRFU chairman Eddie Tonks and
deputy chairman Rob Fisher will vote for the change at the board's
annual meeting in Bristol in March.
Mr Tonks said he favoured professionalism along similar lines to New
Zealand cricket, where players are on performance-based contracts with a
sliding scale of retainers based on their Test experience and status.
He said there was a tremendous amount of work to be done, ''but the
principle is that we believe the situation at the moment is quite
farcical''.
Since the 1987 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, the impetus for
relaxation in the amateur regulations has been gathering pace, largely
as a result of mounting player-power and Rugby League's increasing
recruitment from the amateur game.
Members of the All Black world cup squad are already under contract to
the NZRFU and are widely believed to be in receipt of financial reward.
Southern hemisphere players regularly spend their close season with
clubs in Italy and France, leading to widespread speculation that they
are being paid for doing so.
The regulations have already been relaxed to the extent that players
are permitted to earn from off-field activities. In Scotland, the former
Scottish captain Ian McLauchlan acts as players' agent for these.
Within the game, there is a general feeling that professionalism in
some form or other is inevitable. Scottish captain Gavin Hastings is
already on record as believing top players will be fully professional by
the end of the century.
Mr McLeod said: ''The current policy of the Scottish Rugby Union is
quite clear. We support the amateur principles of the game but some of
the points apparently made by Eddie Tonks are certainly statements of
fact. There is a lot of 'shamateurism' around in the world of rugby.

A MAN is feared to have drowned in the Clyde after a stag night bet
with a friend went wrong.
Mr Adrian Caskie and Mr Thomas Spence, both from Castlemilk, Glasgow,
had been returning with family and friends from Mr Caskie's brother's
stag night in the early hours of Sunday morning when the pair are
understood to have arranged a bet over swimming the Clyde.
Police were alerted by a passing taxi-driver, who saw both men in the
water. They were on the scene with Glasgow Humane Society's river warden
Mr George Parsonage within minutes.
Mr Thomas Spence, 24, made it across the river and climbed out near
the Renfrew Ferry in Clyde Place, but Mr Caskie, 27, could not be found.
He lived with Ms Jenny Regan in Dougrie Street. The couple have two
young boys, Martin, three, and baby Sean.
Ms Regan was last night being comforted by Mr Caskie's mother Bridget.
Mrs Caskie lives just streets away from the flat her son had shared with
Ms Regan for more than six years.
Both women were last night too upset to comment.
Mr Spence was taken to Glasgow's Royal Infirmary where he was treated
for the effects of cold and discharged yesterday afternoon. He refused
to comment about the incident.
A number of Mr Caskie's relatives and friends joined the search of the
banks of the river yesterday. It was called off after more than 12 hours
at about 5pm.
Police frogmen will carry out further searches at first light today.
It was believed unlikely that Mr Caskie could have survived, but
police last night said the case was still being treated as a missing
person inquiry.
Mr Parsonage believed the Castlemilk man had fallen victim to
treacherous undercurrents in the river, which are masked by the
apparently calm surface.
He said he found it incredible that Mr Spence had managed to negotiate
the crossing.

FORMER Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke has praised Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams as a ''brave man'' to whom the world should be
''grateful''.
His outspoken comments provoked a stinging response from the
Democratic Unionist Party. Its deputy leader, Mr Peter Robinson, said
the relatives of the victims of the IRA considered Mr Adams to be a
''coward''.
Mr Brooke said of the Sinn Fein president: ''In my view, he was a
brave man -- and I hope he will be justified. That step (the IRA
ceasefire) was a crucial step. I describe it myself as a Rubicon.
''He led them across that Rubicon. It was like many acts of
leadership. In my view, that was a courageous step. He had a leadership
role. He performed it.
''And I think the whole of Ireland and the whole of these islands, and
I think arguably the whole of the world, is grateful to him for having
done it.
''Irish history is littered with occasions when people have in fact
been attacked from behind. Therefore understandably, anybody who does
take so forward a step is, in my view, taking a courageous one.''
His comments are made in an interview with BBC 1's Panorama for a
programme to be screened tonight. They were immediately condemned by Mr
Robinson.
Mr Robinson said: ''Mr Brooke may consider Adams to be a man of
courage but the families of those who were the victims of the IRA's
deadliest period of killings know who was in leadership in Belfast at
that time and consider Adams to be the coward who encouraged the bombers
and gunmen.''
He added: ''As for the world having much for which they might thank Mr
Adams, I believe the world might have greater cause to curse the day he
was ever born.''
Panorama also focuses on Mr Adams's past. Mr Adams, who yesterday
attended a rally in Londonderry marking the 23rd anniversary of Bloody
Sunday, has always denied he was a member of the IRA.
However, John Kelly, a founder member of the Provisional IRA, tells
Panorama that Mr Adams was ''OC of Ballymurphy'' -- the Officer
Commanding of an IRA company in Belfast.
The intelligence services believe he later ran the IRA's second
battalion for ten months in 1971/2 during which time 52 policemen,
soldiers and civilians were killed, Panorama says.
The programme also reports that the 1985 UK-Irish Treaty was the
turning point in Mr Adams's attitude to violence and that, while denying
it in public, he saw the treaty as an opportunity to adopt an
alternative way to achieve a united Ireland.
General Sir James Glover, chief of Defence Intelligence 1981-3, tells
the programme: ''I must salute the way in which he has so successfully
made the transformation from hard terrorist to astute politician.''
He says that during his three years in the Maze in the 1970s, he drew
up a blueprint for a restructured IRA based on the classic communist
cell terrorist movement.
Four man cells, active service units, replaced battalions. Their
independence made them harder to penetrate by informers.
Sir James said Adams played a key role in the new northern command. He
forged closer links between the IRA and Sinn Fein, but had ''become
reinvolved militarily and the reports indicated that no substantial
terrorist operation in Belfast could be mounted without Adams's personal
sanction.''
The programme also reports that the Prime Minister did not believe
former Irish premier Albert Reynolds when he told Mr Major there would
be an IRA ceasefire.
Meanwhile, Mr Adams called for the release of paratrooper Lee Clegg,
but only when ''all of those imprisoned because of the conflict, are
released''. Clegg was jailed for life after his conviction for the
murder of Belfast joyrider Karen Reilly.
It was believed last night that the Irish Government is about to
release up to six IRA prisoners in response to the ceasefire. The
initial release plan was delayed after an armed raid on a Newry Post
Office, when a mail worker was shot dead.
Mr Adams rejected newspaper claims that the US Government had agreed
to allow Sinn Fein to fund raise in the US on condition that the IRA
would decommission its weaponry.
''In discussions with US Government officials it was never raised by
them,'' he said.

THE self-styled Scottish National Liberation Army yesterday claimed to
have phoned a death threat to the Scottish Secretary Ian Lang at his
home in Scotland.
A call from Dublin, purportedly on behalf of the SNLA, to the Press
Association in London, claimed it had ''gained access'' to sensitive BT
customer files providing a ''vast share of confidential material''.
The caller gave Mr Lang's home number and said this had been used to
deliver a death threat to him. The claim is under investigation by
Strathclyde Police.
The prepared statement gave no other numbers, but said the material
included ''hundreds'' of ex-directory, unlisted, and secret numbers of
other Cabinet Ministers, senior police, and military officers.
The Press Association passed details of the call to police and BT. A
BT spokesman said yesterday: ''We have been made aware of this call, and
we are offering all assistance to the police or any other authorities
who may need it. But we cannot comment beyond that.''
The Scottish Office said: ''We are making no comment. This is a matter
for police.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said: ''We can confirm that we are
aware of the information that has been passed to the Press Association
and that we are looking into the matter.''
Even at its height in the early years of the 1980s, the self-styled
SNLA probably never numbered more than four or five people.
Hoax bomb and letter campaigns throughout Scotland and parts of
England have been attributed to the organisation.
The most notable conviction of one of its members was that of Andrew
McIntosh who began a 12-year prison sentence in December 1993 after
being found guilty of conspiracy and bomb charges.
Adam Busby, the self-styled leader of the SNLA fled to Ireland after a
series of letter bombs and explosions in the seventies.

THE Government's opposition to a federal Europe will be spearheaded
today by Defence Secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind. In a speech in Brussels,
he will warn federally inclined EU members the nation state must be
''the basic building block'' of the Union in future.
Mr Rifkind will stress that developments within the EU must not put a
strain on relations with the United States and insist the responsibility
for ordering troops into action must remain with national governments
and cannot be taken on by supra-national European institutions.
The Prime Minister will join the attack later this week by making
clear he is prepared to use Britain's veto on constitutional changes in
the EU in next year's inter-governmental summit when he addresses the
Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward Group.
He will reaffirm his cautious stance on possible British membership of
a single European currency, although he will not go as far as many group
members would like by ruling it out entirely.
The stance found an unlikely ally in Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook, who said entering a single currency would depend on a judgment
whether British industry was ready to face the competition this would
involve without having the option of devaluation.
Mr Cook said there were economic advantages to a single currency such
as no exchange costs and stability for industry. ''Our problem will be
when we come to power that an analysis of British industry shows it has
become weaker rather than stronger over the last 16 Tory years of
government.''
Asked if that implied that he ruled out adoption of a single currency
by 1997, the date set by new Commission President, Mr Jacques Santer, Mr
Cook replied: ''I am not at all sure it is a date that is going to suit
anyone. But by the turn of the century some countries in Europe will
want to proceed to a single currency and the question will be whether
the conditions then are right for us.''
Tory infighting on Europe sharpened with former Prime Minister Sir
Edward Heath rebuking Mr Major for ''making a great mistake'' in
detailing too many commitments too early in his negotiating stance for
the next European summit.
On BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost Sir Edward said: ''If you don't get
what you are committed to you open yourself to attack from those who
hate you and want to get rid of you.'' He said the Prime Minister should
realise that pro-Europeans would back him and that he should leave his
Euro sceptic critics ''on one side''.
Other pro-EU Tory MPs voiced concern that Mr Major was being forced
into a position which was too Euro-sceptical by minorities within the
Cabinet and party.
Mr Rifkind's more sceptical line is seen as recognition by a Minister
known to be keen to succeed Mr Douglas Hurd as Foreign Secretary of the
way the wind is blowing in the party.
Mr Michael Portillo, Employment Secretary, has drawn no Prime
Ministerial rebuke for his suggestion that the Government should use its
veto power extensively to block further moves towards political
integration and a more federal system in the EU.
This has already brought warnings of a major row with Britain's
partners. Both the Dutch and Belgians warned Britain against use of the
veto.
Former Foreign Secretary Lord Howe, writing in the Financial Times,
warned that Mr Major had become a hostage to the Euro-sceptics, taking a
tougher stance on closer ties with Europe purely to entice the nine
rebel MPs back into the parliamentary party.
Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, also expressed concern at
the successes of the Tory Euro-sceptics and the possible consequence. He
said: ''Somebody has to stand up for Europe. We are starting to see this
great idea unstitch.''
