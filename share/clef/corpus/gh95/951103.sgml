It's been a while coming, but David Belcher finds the new album from
Trashcan Sinatras a satisfying earful.
SELF-deprecating Scottish popsters: they're their own worst enemies.
But now, following in Edwyn Collins's wake, things are going to change,
mark my words. Take Kilmarnock's Trashcan Sinatras -- and you should,
hotly, to your bosom, embrace them now.
Like Edwyn, the Trashcans are witty fellows who have consistently
refused to take themselves seriously. Throughout their six-year,
two-album lifespan, they have always taken their music seriously, of
course -- but folk persist in looking at their jocular band-name and
favouring them with wry smiles rather than the awe which is routinely
accorded lesser groups prone to loudly proclaiming their own worth.
Sadly, the same seems to apply to Scotland's other great commercial
under-achievers, Teenage Fanclub. Oh aye, the reasoning runs. Teenage
Fanclub -- a history of shambolic live shows; amusing covers; interviews
in which the band aren't filled with arrogant self-reverence.
And yet when the world simply listened to Edwyn Collins's Never Met A
Girl Like You Before, the world loved it. Surely the same thing will
happen when the world simply re-listens to Teenage Fanclub's Grand Prix
album, ignoring the Carry-On comicality implicit in its title.
And for your own good, you should forget your preconceptions and pop
along pronto to a Trashcans' live show, as they undertake what they've
labelled the A-Z Tour. As an alphabetical concept, it's naturally a bit
of a hoot. But that shouldn't blind you to the serious goodness of the
Trashcans on stage.
The tour began earlier this week in Aberdeen, moving on to Belfast,
Cork and Dublin. Next week it reaches Edinburgh, Dundee, and Glasgow,
before heading off the week after that to Hamilton, Inverness, Joanna's
in Elgin, and Kilmarnock. Languid front man Frank Read rolls his eyes,
as he is wont to do. ''We're only doing A-K just now,'' he sighs.
''We'll get round to the L-Z in the next six months, ending in Zurich,
we hope.
''We keep coming up with these daft ideas, and then we have to go out
and make them work.''
Work, work, work. Pondering the forthcoming fruits of the band's
labours, we sit in the cafeteria of a Safeway superstore in Kilmarnock.
Perhaps this locale is emblematic of the Trashcans' current approach to
music-making. Practicality. No flummery. Trashcan Sinatras: a
bargain-priced weekly shopping staple. Or maybe we're here simply
because it's adjacent to the Trashcans' Shabby Road Studio premises.
But I digress. Unlike me, the Trashcans have been busily focused.
Their long-overdue third album, A Happy Pocket (to be issued on the Go!
Discs label early next year), was finished last March. The delay in its
release has been beneficial in terms of honing and polishing, the band
reckon.
At the same time, Frank frets about ''the people who follow our
career, if you can call it that, thinking we've been in a state of
inertness for the past three years. Thinking that we've just been lazy.
We want to be more spontaneous, too, so I'm glad we're playing live. And
we're going to do a lot more playing live.''
Hang on, though. What is a happy pocket?
''A full pocket is a happy pocket,'' Frank says, quoting a dictum
which is apparently big in Fife. The band's pockets are presently less
than overflowing, it transpires. Indeed, three of the band are currently
dossing in sleeping bags in cubbyholes at their studio, having been
turfed out of rented flats.
The album's 13 songs are a happy pocket of tunefulness. The only
problem is that most Trashcan songs contain seven times more melodic
variety and invention than you'll find in lesser bands' entire careers.
You are much too good, oh Trashcans.
The Trashcan Sinatras: they've grown into something gravely glorious,
and no-one else is quite like them.
''Should we change the band's name?'' they enquire before I leave,
aware of its handicapping effect.
Maybe, I reply, but to what?
''Bum Gravy,'' Frank ventures in a deadpan tone. He cannot be serious.
In love with the Trashcans, you seriously should be.
* The Trashcan Sinatras appear next Wednesday at La Belle Angele,
Edinburgh; on Thursday at Fat Sam's, in Dundee, and on Friday in Glasgow
at the Cathouse in its last night in its present location. They will
also be supporting labelmates the Beautiful South at Glasgow's SECC on
November 29.

Washington
THE question of Serb war crimes in Bosnia has dominated the opening
exchanges of the peace talks at Dayton, Ohio. US Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said after the official opening that he could not see
how Nato peacekeepers could deal with the Bosnian Serb leaders, Radovan
Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, and President Alija Izetbegovic of
Bosnia said that the two must be handed over to the war crimes tribunal
in The Hague.
The talks are meant to be secret, but the Bosnians, at least, know the
utility of the calculated leak. They have emerged to meet reporters
camped on the periphery of the air base where the talks are held, no
doubt to the annoyance of the Americans who want to control the flow of
information.
The Bosnian source said Mr Izetbegovic was demanding that the Serbian
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, commit himself to stopping further war
crimes, meaning massacres of Muslim prisoners and ethnic cleansing.
Furthermore, he must agree that those indicted by the Hague tribunal
must be delivered to it. The two most prominent are Mr Karadzic, the
civilian Serb leader in Bosnia, and General Mladic, who is accused of
ordering the massacre of several thousand Muslims after the capture of
Srebrenica in July.
Mr Christopher's comments were made on television last night. He said
it was unthinkable that US and Nato troops should be sent to Bosnia to
keep the peace while Karadzic and Mladic still exercised any authority
there.
He also said there were still vast differences between the sides, but
expressed hope that progress might yet be achieved. The Croatians and
Serbians may have agreed on the return of eastern Slavonia, the province
of Croatia captured by Serbs in 1991, but the supposed agreement has not
been confirmed.
The other essential questions are the division of territory in Bosnia
between the Serbs, Croatians, and Muslims, the constitution of Bosnia,
and the method of electing its president and his future powers.
These are ''proximity talks'', meaning that each of the three
delegations will remain in separate quarters while the American and
European mediators shuttle among them, seeking common ground. The
Americans have prepared draft agreements on all the contentious issues
and are trying to sell them to the parties.
Their main leverage against the Serbs are the sanctions that have
crippled Serbia and that will not be lifted until a peace treaty has
come into effect, and the threat of unleashing the Croatian and Bosnian
armies against remaining Serb positions in Bosnia.
The leverage with the Croatians is that the country will not be
admitted to the EU and other organisations unless it conforms to
European principles.
The Bosnians are the victims, but the Americans are prepared to use
the stick and carrot with them, too: if they will accept the terms
proposed, which are far less than they want, they will be assured of
economic and military assistance in the future. Otherwise, they will be
on their own.

Deir al-Balah, Gaza
TWO suicide bombers targeted Israeli buses today, killing themselves
and injuring 11 Israelis in what Palestinian officials said was revenge
for the assassination of an Islamic militant leader.
The first bomb went off near an army-escorted bus carrying nursery
teachers and baby sitters from Israel to Jewish settlements inside
Palestinian-ruled Gaza.
Three soldiers, the driver, and seven other people were wounded.
''God loves me,'' said 24-year-old Moshe Danino, driver of the bus,
after emerging with only scorched hair. ''It was a miracle.''
A babysitter on the first bus targeted said: ''I was talking to my
friend and suddenly I saw pieces of glass, chaos, screams. . . They took
us off the bus, and then we heard another explosion.''
The second blast went off half-a-mile away at a spot where an Israeli
bus and other vehicles were waiting for an army escort through PLO-ruled
areas to Israel. The suicide attacker was the only casualty.
The fresh violence raised questions about whether Israel would stick
to its timetable for pulling out of West Bank towns and villages by the
end of the year.
Israel has said it would freeze the withdrawal if PLO chief Yasser
Arafat could not rein in Muslim militants.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the attacks were planned and
carried out in the Gaza Strip, under the noses of Arafat's security
forces.
''We expect from them more effective activity in the areas under their
control,'' he said.
Arafat commented curtly: ''You know we are against it.''
Other Palestinian officials suggested Israel was to blame because they
alleged that Mossad was responsible for killing Islamic Jihad leader
Fathi Shaqaqi a week ago in Malta.
The Palestinian Authority's intelligence chief, Mousa Arafat, said:
''We are against suicide bombings, but when Israel does the provocation,
it has to accept the consequences.''
Mousa, a cousin of the PLO leader, said the assassination destroyed
what he called a ''gentleman's agreement'' between the militants and the
Palestinian government to halt anti-Israeli attacks. More revenge
bombings could now be expected, he said.
And he added that Islamic Jihad was clearly responsible for the
bombings.
Jihad, an Iran-backed group that opposes the Israel-PLO peace deal as
well as Israel's existence, has carried out a series of suicide bombings
and shooting attacks over the past two years.
In a January bombing near Netanya in central Israel, 21 people were
killed. An April blast near a Jewish settlement in Gaza killed seven
Israeli soldiers and an American student.--AP/Reuter.

CATHEDRAL House at 28-32 Cathedral Square has to be Glasgow's ultimate
rus in urbe experience on the eating out scene. This important part of
entrepreneur Billy McAneney's catering empire, which also comprises the
Baby Grand, Cafe Royal and Cottier's, was once the Settlement House for
discharged prisoners from the notorious Duke Street jail nearby, and is
now a stylish hotel, restaurant and lounge bar.
The cosy dining room is skilfully divided into two by Art Nouveau
wrought iron and stained glass stanchions. There is a feature mahogany
bar with carved pillars and a raised area with a table for six which is
very popular with regular patrons. Candles and fresh flowers adourn the
crisp white napery and a whirling ceiling fan plus Vienna Secession
style comfortable chairs combine to produce a pleasing continental
atmosphere.
The new menu from November 6 embraces both traditional and
contemporary cuisines from king prawns in coconut sauce and grilled
polenta with asparagus, olive oil and Parmesan among the starters;
saddle of lamb with tortilla, lasagne and tomato chilli sauce and breast
of chicken with passion fruit butter are among the main courses, and
bread and butter pudding and creme brulee among the sweets. The
Icelandic hot rock specials are still on offer by customer demand.
The Christmas lunch and dinner menus at #18.50 and #21.50 respectively
are available from December 4 to January 7. The three courses and either
tea or coffee with cranberry ginger or mincemeat tart, table d'hote, are
especially designed for end-of-year revellers.
Cockaleekie soup, smoked trout pate and spinach ricotta terrine are
the starters. Fish fanciers can have grilled salmon in dill and whisky,
vegetarians are well served with filo pastry baskets with stir-fried
vegetables and a Dolcelatte sauce, while carnivores can plump for roast
turkey with all the trimmings in a cranberry and Cumberland sauce.
Orange chocolate icecream, Christmas pudding in creamed brandy sauce and
bread and butter pudding are the sweets.

DURING 1994 Standard Life decided to become more customer-oriented in
response to changes in the financial services market, writes JOAN GRADY.
It realised that customers no longer wanted to be passed up and down
the line of company hierarchy when calling, and began the process of
empowering staff to deal with customers individually.
''We changed the way we managed our business by installing a Total
Customer Satisfaction programme,'' said corporate training manager McKay
Brown. ''We realised that becoming customer-driven was essential to
achieving sustainable competitive advantage.''
The change involved more than simply encouraging staff to take the
initiative. To make the company more focused on customer needs, every
employee had to undertake training to understand better how to deal with
customers and with each other.
''Every member of staff attended two days of training to build the
skills they would require to provide consistently excellent experiences
for all our customers,'' said Brown. ''Managers attended four days of
training to equip them with the skills to lead the change.''
Being aware of the preparation and training needed for such a step,
Standard Life made the initial transition fairly easily. The company has
found it operates better now it is allowing staff to think for
themselves.
The introduction of a team-based approach means each individual is
more focused on working for the benefit of the company as a whole, as
opposed to themselves. Understanding the company's needs means having to
understand customer needs, and each member of staff is working to make
sure those needs are met.
Standard Life is committed to allowing staff to develop. ''An area of
strength for us is the depth and variety of talent in our staff,'' said
Brown. ''Our new management process aims to tap those talents, involving
everyone in creating a customer-driven company.''

Stewart Fraser tests a six-berth keelboat
THE Westerly Konsort 29 is a good example of the mid-range family
cruiser.
You've done some sailing. Decided to move up from the initial smaller
craft. And gone for a six-berth keelboat, with the emphasis on cruising
rather than, say, racing pure and simple.
Konsorts suit West Coast characteristics. They are the kind of boat
that has stood the test of time, and can offer owners a worthwhile
return on their investment.
The one on test typifies the Laurent Giles style. A 20hp Bukh diesel
took us out from the shelter of the marina. If the two batteries had
been out of use for any reason, we could have hand-started using
decompressors, not always available nowadays.
Roller reefing on the 140% headsail saved a trip to the pulpit, in a
moderate swell. Halyards led to the cockpit made for a simple main
hoist. The three reefing lines were also lead aft, via jammers.
Indeed, the only reminder of older usage was the main sheet going to
its track at the stern. It certainly keeps the cockpit clear, and makes
for safe entry at the main hatch.
That's what it's for. It's just that the trend today is for more
control, with the sheet inboard from the end of the boom.
Not that it kept us from making a steady six knots, in a variable
Force 4. Reefing in the headsail kept us more upright, with little
effect on our speed. Letting it out, on a downwind run, brought the
usual benefit a cruising family appreciates -- calm progress, under full
control.
The feel-good factor is well to the fore in a yacht like this. It has
a Lloyds hull construction certificate and is on the Small Ships
Register. The rudder is transom-hung, part-balanced and is easily
manoeuvred. The cockpit is deep and self-draining, with comfortable
coamings.
The masthead rig has a single spreader, and standing rigging is in
stainless steel. Running rigging is pre-stretched Terylene. Cap shrouds
go to chain plates bolted through the main bulkhead. Lowers go to
stainless steel tie bars on heavy webs glassed to the hull.
Grabrails are in teak. Cabin sole is teak and holly, with lots of
well-kept woodwork on show, including a face-forward navigation table
with inside stowage.
Going below, the port berth is a convertible double, with seatbacks
that double as safe lee boards -- again, not a universal facility these
days. To starboard is a single, with a quarter berth behind the
nav-table. Forward are the usual singles, or a converted double berth.
At the pulpit, there is a CQR anchor with ample chain in the locker.
There is a new sprayhood and a well-kept mainsail cover.
It is perhaps the smaller details that indicate it is an enthusiast's
boat. There is an outboard bracket, just in case it's needed. The mast
has a radar reflector. A 240V shore power link has been installed. And
there is an extension VHF speaker in the cockpit.
All in all, a pleasant family cruiser, ideal for the West Coast with
its 5ft 4in draught. Ready for next season, and raring to go. Good value
in today's terms at around #36,000.
The yachting and boating column is going into dry dock over the
winter, but will be back in the spring.

A SCOTTISH company is set to manufacture the next generation of
American-designed compact artificial hearts following Britain's first
successful electric heart transplant.
AorTech, based near Bellshill, in Lanarkshire, has been involved in
discussions with US heart pioneer Dr Robert Jarvik over manufacturing
his thumb-sized pump, complete with rechargeable batteries. If the deal
goes ahead, the company would distribute the lifesaving device around
the world to a huge potential market.
In Britain alone, thousands of people are on heart transplant waiting
lists but, according to the British Heart Foundation, fewer than 154
people received donor hearts in the first six months of this year.
The development comes a week after retired film producer Abel Goodman,
64, from London, became the first person to receive a permanent electric
heart. Mr Goodman had been suffering from heart failure and had been
given only months to live. He was nine years too old to be given a
transplant on the NHS.
The operation was carried out at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford
by cardiac surgeon Dr Steve Westaby with the help of experts from the
Texas Heart Institute. The titanium heart, costing #65,000, was stitched
into the left ventricle of his own heart, pumping blood around the body.
Mr Goodman was sitting up in bed within 24 hours of his operation.
Yesterday AorTech's managing director, Mr Eddie McDaid, said Dr Jarvik
and surgeon Mr Westaby had recently visited the firm and been impressed
with the quality of work on heart valves manufactured by the company.
He said Dr Jarvick had come to seek Scottish expertise because of
tough Federal Drug Administration regulations, which could delay the
manufacture of the artificial heart by several years in the States.
Unlike the plate-sized pump which was inserted into Mr Goodman's
abdomen, the Jarvik 2000 model works on a minature turbine and can be
recharged by attaching an external battery coil to the skin which
transmits energy to the implanted batteries.
Mr McDaid said the doctors planned to visit the 26-staff company again
after Christmas to discuss the device's manufacture.
''Our aim is to ensure that the next generation of these devices is
manufactured here at the Euromed Business Park,'' he said. ''This could
be the biggest innovation in cardiac surgery in 30 years and we are
determined that Scotland should be at the forefront of developing this
new healthcare technology.''
Lanarkshire Development Agency said the electric heart developments
enhanced the Euromed Park's reputation as a world centre of medical
excellence. The company is hoping that if it is awarded the manufacture
contract it can secure some assistance from organisations like Scottish
Enterprise.

Why shouldn't staff be trusted with more responsibility? Joan Grady
reports
FEW company changes are likely to alter the role managers more -- and
frighten many of them -- than the idea of empowering employees. Yet it
is one of the fastest-spreading management concepts in Britain today.
Two weeks ago delegates from major Scottish employers attended the
''Empowering Scotland'' conference at Glasgow's Hilton, hosted by The
Industrial Society.
Empowerment is essentially a business tool. It transfers authority,
responsibility and resources to those who actually use them in their
work.
What it means is that the employee could find him- or herself with
more scope, more power and more responsibility than ever before. What it
needs is a ''no-blame culture'' within which supportive teams of people
can operate.
''Culture is a mix of an organisation's dominant beliefs, values and
assumptions,'' said The Industrial Society's Frank Burns. ''These
determine the way its members see acceptable behaviour, understand the
role of the organisation, filter information from inside and outside,
and react to events, problems and opportunities.
''The traditional culture of many organisations is to create rigid and
narrow job descriptions and to provide constant and close supervision
and control. This is underpinned by beliefs that people are lazy and not
able to direct themselves in pursuit of their goals.
''This culture is manifested in a lack of enthusiasm, lack of
teamwork, absenteeism, resistance to change, and a 'that's not my job'
attitude.''
These attitudes can be dispelled by empowering staff. The term does
not mean giving staff additional power, it means unlocking the power
they already have. Through a supportive environment, proper training and
increased communication employees feel better able to contribute and to
take control of their own roles within the organisation.
Mistakes are no longer treated as dismal failures but as learning
opportunities. The empowered employee is more able to try new ideas and
suggest different approaches when there is nobody waiting to blame them
if it all goes wrong.
There is no easy way to introduce empowerment. It will usually take a
range of initiatives over a sustained period of time. Typically, it
involves the clarification of the company's values and reduced layers of
management -- creating a horizontal structure where employees are better
able to concentrate on customers, rather than the usual company
hierarchy.
Retraining is absolutely essential so every employee understands his
or her new role and how to use the new freedoms that come with it.
Employers are gradually coming round to the idea that they do not need
people to sit down, shut up and do as they're told. They need people who
can think for themselves, work effectively as part of a team, take
responsibility for their own actions and support company policies.
An Industrial Society survey indicates that more than 50% of managers
are expecting to empower their companies within the next three years.
They believe this will make better use of employees' skills, improve
customer service, speed up reactions to change within the company -- and
save money.
It also contributes to a clearer definition of the company's vision
and values -- 64% of organisations surveyed said this was the main
effect of empowering staff. ''It is essential to get the balance right
between your systems and your people,'' said Andrew Forrest, conference
chairman and director of human resources at The Industrial Society.
''There's no sense in having the latest customer care programmes if
your people at different levels are not empowered to make them work. The
only resource with no known limit to its potential is people.
''An environment is needed where the people who do the work make
decisions on how it is done -- where change is normal, risk-taking is
encouraged, and there is a presumption of trust.''
Empowerment spells huge changes to job descriptions, particularly for
middle management. The Industrial Society's survey showed that middle
managers will spend more time supporting staff rather than controlling
them and that they will use more time for training and development.
Perhaps it is for this reason that middle managers have the most
negative response to empowerment -- 32% showed a negative reaction to
its introduction. The best reaction came from senior managers, with
almost half showing a positive interest in the idea.
Most companies surveyed said they would be adopting a team approach,
empowering teams of people as well as individuals so all staff get the
freedom to express ideas.
Implementing all the changes will take time and would normally be done
over a prearranged period to allow staff the chance to adjust to the
shift in the balance of power and their new responsibilities.
Speakers at the conference included representatives from Standard
Life, Yarrow Shipbuilders and the Benefits Agency, each of which has
introduced empowerment. ''Yarrow Shipbuilders recognises that its most
valuable asset is its people,'' said Ian Jackson, divisional personnel
manager.
''Extensive time, resources and money have been invested over recent
years to develop all employees. The company's mission statement
specifically focuses on continuous improvement through the development
of all employees.''
'Employers are coming round to the idea that they do not need people
to sit down, shut up and do as they're told. They need people who can
think for themselves, work effectively as part of a team, and take
responsibility for their own actions'

LINN DICKSON was in the forefront when EAPS Scotland was formed. Newly
relocated from Aberdeen to Edinburgh, she was worried about leaving all
her old contacts behind her and having to develop an entirely new set.
''I had a great network of contacts in Aberdeen and knew nobody in
Edinburgh, but then I saw an advertisement for EAPS in a magazine and
called the number,'' she recalls. ''I was told that a member of the
London branch -- Anne Stoddart -- was in Edinburgh, so I contacted her
and discovered she was trying to launch EAPS Scotland.
''I got in there at the beginning. I was appointed treasurer in the
first year because of my financial background, and I am now in my final
year as treasurer and my first as PR officer.''
EAPS Scotland is now the fastest-growing and almost the largest UK
region. Working as PR officer is not easy, especially when you're also
national marketing manager in a major accountancy firm and PA to its
managing partner.
Dickson fits in her EAPS commitment around her job. ''My boss and his
clients are always priority number one,'' she says. ''I fit in EAPS as
appropriate. I can write reports at home for example and, if I ask
nicely enough, someone will type them up for me.''
She is a perfect example of the kind of organisational skill needed to
be a top PA. Yesterday's seminar came close to disaster last week when,
with only eight days to go, the original venue informed her it had
double booked. Within half an hour Dickson had booked another venue and
informed the relevant media of the change.
''It all adds to the experience,'' she says. ''All in a day's work for
a secretary who's in control!''

HOW many times have you heard ''only a secretary''? It's a career
choice which is widely viewed (by those not in it) as menial, dull, a
life of opening letters, answering telephones and making coffee. A
secretary is thought of as following the high-flyers, carrying the
luggage. But in fact, the top secretary can be a high-flyer in her own
right, writes JOAN GRADY.
A few secretaries are men, but the vast majority of top secretaries in
this country are women. And there is a lot more to the job than
answering the phone.
Linn Dickson is PA to Colin Rutherford, managing partner at Rutherford
Manson Dowds, Scotland's largest independent firm of accountants. She is
also national marketing manager, which does not leave a lot of time for
typing.
''It gets hectic at times,'' she says, ''but I enjoy the mix. My
skills are suited to both jobs. I'm an organiser and a people person.
When Colin is not in the office I hold the fort -- clients know they
have only to speak to me and they'll get the response they need in
plenty of time.
''Many people still say 'just a secretary' and that we're 'right
behind the boss'. We should not be behind the boss, we should be right
up there beside him. My boss describes me as his right hand, and it's
important that bosses recognise what their PAs are doing for them.''
While school, college or secretarial schools will teach the basic
qualifications needed, many PAs and secretaries feel there is less
guidance for them once they have reached higher levels of
responsibility.
For that reason, more than 50 of them convened in Edinburgh yesterday
to attend the second skills seminar of the European Association of
Professional Secretaries (EAPS) Scotland.
''The purpose of the seminar is that we have identified a need in PAs
for more business and management skills,'' says Dickson, who is also
public relations officer for EAPS Scotland. ''Our members find they are
increasingly having to run with projects outside the scope of a normal
PA which they are not necessarily trained to handle.
''At the last seminar we identified eight subjects which members were
not comfortable with and brought in guest speakers to talk about them.
With the feedback we received from that we picked out the three main
topics our members want to hear more about and addressed them at this
year's seminar.''
With the seminar priced at only #60 a head, about 90% of bosses were
willing to pay for their PAs to attend. About the same number of bosses
pay the EAPS membership fee of just over #40. It is seen as an
investment as it's helping staff improve their skills.
EAPS Scotland (and other regional groups) meet once a month. Guest
speakers address the meeting on subjects the members want to learn more
about. ''Seminars and meetings are standardised across the UK,'' says
Dickson. ''We're very conscious of our regions doing similar things.
EAPS' regional secretaries meet regularly to discuss what each is doing
so all members get the same benefits.
''Some of our monthly meetings are purely training. Regional skills
seminars are open to the whole of the UK, but most of the members will
be from that region. Usually only a handful of other members turn up.''
Strong communications and networking ensures that no one region is
left behind. And in England, EAPS is working to standardise the training
for people just starting their secretarial careers, by working with
national training authorities developing secretarial NVQs.
The remarkable thing is that these executive secretaries and PAs are
training themselves: they are developing their own methods, their own
subjects, and improving their own skills and abilities.
''The main benefit is introduction to a strong, influential network of
people, to enhance employability and personal career development,'' says
Dickson. ''This is the responsibility of the girls themselves. Personal
development is strong in the minds of PAs.''
EAPS members pick up skills from each other, as well as from their
guest speakers. In an area where confidentiality is a priority, it can
be difficult to find guidance if there is a problem. EAPS runs
confidential forums where members can get together and discuss problems
and exchange ideas.
''These are organised informally after meetings or seminars,'' says
Dickson. ''If someone has a problem we get together to sort it out and
ask each other: 'how do you cope in this situation?'
''We all know the value of confidentiality so it gives us the chance
to tackle difficult issues with others in the same position.''
To qualify for full membership of EAPS, PAs must have worked at board
level for three years. To give others the chance to learn more about the
job, however, associate membership is available to those working at top
levels who have not been there as long. Associate members have all the
same benefits as full members except that they cannot vote at
Association AGMs.
''Having associate members brings some of the younger people into the
organisation and helps them learn about the job,'' says Dickson. ''We
realise we need a good mix of older and younger people for the
organisation to work.''
Achieving a good mix is essentially what EAPS is all about. Membership
automatically links secretaries and PAs all over Europe, giving overseas
contacts in 18 countries. This gives a strong support network which is
constantly looking to improve the standards both of secretaries and for
secretaries.
One member was able to negotiate herself a pay rise when backed by
another. ''She was able to approach her boss very professionally and
explain she felt she was being underpaid in comparison to her
colleague,'' says Dickson. ''Her boss gave her the rise.
''We're not an 'alternative mafia' but we can help women by
introducing them to the network,'' concludes Dickson. ''Women make good
networkers if they have the confidence to do it. Many women still don't
have, and that's what we're trying to change.''

IN different parts of the country, motorists come upon stretches of
road which mysteriously provoke far louder tyre noise than whatever went
just before, writes ROSS FINLAY. It is usually worst in dry weather. It
often varies according to the tyre size and tread pattern on the car
involved. But it is never less than aggravating.
In the south, prime examples are part of the Huntingdon bypass and a
stretch of the M27 near Southampton. Perhaps the most excruciating road
noise in Scotland comes from the M74 at Lesmahagow. Here, the concrete
surface looks like a washboard, and it is a great relief to encounter
the much-quieter ''black top'' at the bridges -- only to come back
almost immediately to the grating, whining racket of the concrete.
Road noise is a complex subject, dependent on features not many of us
take into account. It involves frequency, pitch, the number of
corrugations in the surface, the size of each grain of the surfacing
material used, and so on.
Regional councils have noise specialists in their roads departments,
but their job is concerned more with predictions of future noise levels,
than with noise measurement once a road is open.
The point here is that when a road is built, or substantially altered,
councils have a duty under the land compensation legislation to come up
with a prediction of what noise levels might be reached -- 15 years into
the future!
If the actual noise levels turn out to be too high, affected
householders must be compensated. That's why some roadside houses
suddenly blossom out with double glazing and other noise suppression
measures, which make the house interiors quieter, though they do nothing
to the noise levels outside.
As Glasgow-based noise and vibration consultant Andy Watson points
out, road-builders try to satisfy what are often irreconcilable
requirements: ''The surfaces they specify should be durable, quiet,
easily drained, and of a texture which gives vehicle tyres good adhesion
and low wear rates, as well as allowing the vehicles to stop safely.''
To achieve all of that at the same time is a tall order. Here and
there, you will see special surfaces, perhaps just before traffic lights
to give good braking performance, or in other areas to cut down tyre
noise. One recently-laid stretch of the M40, approaching the Chilterns,
is remarkably quiet.
But while fine-grained surfaces are good for keeping down noise, the
coarser types provide better tyre adhesion and surface drainage. Which
to choose? It may depend on a particular area's typical weather
conditions. And road engineers have the same budgetary problems as
everybody else.
The most modern sound measuring equipment prints out real-time traces
of noise levels every ten milliseconds. The change from a quiet to a
noisy surface can be very abrupt, which is what gives drivers unfamiliar
with a particular road such a shock when the racket starts. However,
knowing to what degree any individual stretch of road is quiet or noisy
is hardly the same thing as getting roads quieter at the building stage.
That is something which European legislators are beginning to take
seriously. Of course, they have to define exactly what they mean by
noise before putting forward their proposals about road construction
methods and preferred surfaces. A draft discussion document is
circulating at the moment, and comments are required by December.
While a rorty exhaust note is enjoyed by many sports car owners -- to
the extent that the manufacturer of one top-selling two-seater tried 500
different exhaust systems before settling on one reckoned to provide
just the right boy-racer noise -- no motorist in the world likes to hear
too much tyre roar.
The problem here is that there is no way a ton and a half of moving
vehicle, pressing four tyres down on any road surface, is going to
travel along silently at 70mph. And there is a limit to how quiet any
moving vehicle can ever be overall. If you reduce noise in one area, you
may reveal noise from some other area which was previously masked.
Andy Watson instances the immense efforts which car manufacturers have
made in the last few years to cut down engine and other mechanical noise
levels. Now, even in high-cost luxury cars, we are beginning to hear
wind whistle and tyre noise which we hardly noticed before.
Some car manufacturers apply themselves very seriously to reducing
overall noise levels. Jaguar has led the luxury class in noise
suppression for many years. Ford's recent programme of examining every
bracket and metal joint, and even airflow over the sump, has made the
latest Escort and Fiesta remarkably quiet.
And the M74 at Lesmahagow? Andy Watson's comment about irreconcilable
requirements is shrewdly put. That stretch of road may be very noisy,
but how often have you seen it ''up''?

GREAT Britain yesterday completed their whitewash of Russia by winning
the third and final Test 4-1 at Bisham Abbey to add to their 5-0 and 4-0
successes of previous days.
This, however, was not such a good game from a Scottish point of view
as far as goal scoring was concerned, although Susan MacDonald brought
Scotland's input to eight goals with her strike after 27 minutes.
Britain's other scorers were Anna Bennet (2) and Jane Sixsmith.
On the domestic front, the highlight of a diluted programme will be
the meeting of Heriot Watt University and Hyndland at Cramond. The
latter have been going well this season with Linda McKay emerging as the
country's top goal-scorer with 15 goals in her last five outings and her
efficiency should result in the Glasgow girls' maintaining their push
for the first division title.
The students programme has been somewhat punctuated in terms of games
through the late start to their campaign and through unforeseen
circumstances like the abandoned match with Royal High Gymnasts because
of an injury to Sarah Taylor.
Subsequently, the students have not been able to put together any real
form but in Susan Gilmour, Katie Goldsack, and Gillian Soutar they have
the players who could test Hyndland.

AS well as his normal consultancy work, Andy Watson is heavily
involved in all aspects of noise control in British motorsport. With
experience as a rally driver, he is also chairman of the Environmental
Advisory Group of the RAC Motor Sports Association, the sport's UK
governing body.
A technical working group -- with representatives of the RAC MSA, the
circuit owners, the Institute of Acoustics and local Institutes of
Environmental Health -- will be reporting soon on its examination of all
14 racing circuits in the UK and Ireland. Each has different
characteristics in topography, location of nearby villages and
individual houses, and natural sound screening.
People who live near a circuit generally accept that the noise of
competition cars is only to be expected on race meeting days, less so at
other times. What causes annoyance is often the noise of the public
address system.
That was pointed up by the reaction of some officials from a local
authority in whose area another circuit was being planned. They went to
a race meeting on an existing circuit with a rather hilly layout. When
the cars in any race went behind the hill, the visitors said they hardly
heard them. But the commentator, and the loud music he sometimes played,
could not be missed.
All national classes of racing cars in the UK are already subject to
the sport's own noise restrictions. In fact, this country is among the
leaders in the field.
The only type of racing outside any national restrictions is Formula
I. But there is only one grand prix here every year, and grand prix
racing, as everyone knows, is a law unto itself.

ONE of the most enjoyable motoring books of the Fifties was Rallies
and Races, a biography of the famous Dutch driver Maurice Gatsonides.
The mysterious author ''William Leonard'' was actually a Dutch friend of
Gatso's called Willem Leonard, given an English-sounding pseudonym so as
not to put off British readers. Now the book has been republished, by
Amsterdam's Greyhound Press.
The astonishing thing about Maurice Gatsonides is not just his
award-winning drives from the Monte Carlo Rally to the 24-hour race at
Le Mans. Having started his competition career in 1931, he is still
taking part in historic rallies 64 years later!
It is refreshing to read about simpler motorsport times. The cars
might have been less powerful, but the roads were rougher, and time
schedules of rallies in the Alps or the wilds of the Balkans were just
as difficult to maintain then as now.
The book also demolishes the theory that pre-war drivers were casual
amateurs. It recalls how the Romanian Cristea, who won the 1936 Monte
Carlo Rally, practised the final manoeuvring test 400 times on a
duplicate layout in Bucharest.
That was Maurice Gatsonides's first Monte, which ended within
strolling distance of the finish as, misled by a policeman's signal, he
crashed his Hillman Minx into a Monegasque taxi.
There are plenty of stories against himself here, but tales of some
stirring drives as well. His record climbs of the formidable Stelvio
Pass in Italy made sporting headlines, and he was a stalwart performer
in the toughest rally of them all, the exhausting Liege-Rome-Liege.
There are racing chapters too, such as the one describing Gatso's
adventures with a tiny Czech-built Aero Minor at Le Mans. And accounts
of Dutch races with self-designed cars like ''Flatty'', which features
on the cover and with which he was unexpectedly reunited in the 1980s.
The original book finished in 1950, but this edition adds details of
Gatso's Monte Carlo Rally victory of 1953.
One great attraction of the book, in addition to the archive
photographs and the lively Jan Apetz cartoons, is the humorous,
self-deprecating way the story is told. More British perhaps than Dutch,
it seems boyish and a little naive, until you read behind the offhand
style and appreciate just what tough and dedicated sportsmen are
involved.
Rallies and Races will soon be available in this country through Mill
House Books of Eastville, Boston, Lincolnshire, PE22 8LS.

They're not yet on the market but viewable at next week's Scottish
Motor Show. Ross Finlay offers
a pre-preview of some the stylists' exotic products
THERE has never been an autumn like this one for the introduction of
new cars which do not go on sale until next year. Many can be seen in
advance at the Scottish Motor Show, from November 10 to 19 at the SECC
in Glasgow.
Two of the most spectacular are the Alfa Romeo GTV coupe and open-top
Spider. Some enthusiasts believe this is exactly the kind of sporting
car with dazzling appearance which Alfa Romeo ought to be building,
instead of messing around with the 145 and 146.
Given the acceptance of the Chrysler Jeep Cherokee, despite complaints
about passenger space, the larger Austrian-built Grand Cherokee can
hardly fail. I am not so sure about the Chrysler Neon, since saloons
designed, built and badged in the US have rarely been a howling success
here.
There may be doubts too about the Voyager. The snag is that it will
come into a UK market possibly saturated with other MPVs.
The Mitsubishi Carisma and similar Volvo S4 come from the Dutch
factory which originally produced the DAF. Hyundai's next generation
Lantra from Korea will have to go like a bomb to justify the company's
ambitions about making the industry top ten by the year 2000, although
the Accent-type styling may not appeal universally.
Peugeot begins selling the 406 on New Year's Day, when it is unlikely
to be overwhelmed by Scottish showroom traffic. However, this impressive
mid-range saloon showed up well on the left-hand drive press launch in
France.
These events are by no means the cosy, forelock-tugging affairs some
outsiders suspect. There were several complaints about the plan to lower
the overall gearing of the 1.8-litre for the UK market, and it will be
interesting to see how Peugeot has reacted.
Of the home manufacturers, Rover is stealing the motor show thunder
with the new 200 and the 400 saloon. Vauxhall has released information
about the new Vectra in estate form, but puts it on sale next autumn.
Suzuki is introducing the little X-90 recreational 4x4. If the company
stays true to its 1995 form there is not much hope of Scottish
publications being able to report on it.
Renault with the Megane, Fiat with the Bravo and Brava, and Honda with
quite a variety are all introducing new cars next year. And there is the
intriguing prospect of supplies of the Subaru Legacy being brought in
from Indiana.
Oddly enough, the Indiana assembly plant already makes a right-hand
drive Legacy. It is supplied to the US postal service, presumably
because American mailmen do not want to get squidged by other traffic
when getting out to deliver.

<HEADLINE>Arts council seeks lottery change</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish Arts Council is looking to a relaxation in the rules
governing the uses of money raised by the National Lottery to improve
the lot of arts organisations struggling with standstill revenue funding
from Government.
Introducing the council's annual report in Edinburgh yesterday -- and
on the eve of the announcement of the largest single award to a Scottish
arts organisation, to be made in Glasgow this morning -- chairman Mr
William Brown conceded that the lottery had become ''a hot subject for
criticism in recent months, some of it justified, some of it not''.
He said: ''I suppose any subject which produces opportunities for the
use of 'scandal', 'outrage', 'elitist', and, here in Scotland,
'favouritism for England' could not help but make the headlines.''
Mr Brown sought to distance the Scottish Arts Council from the
criticism by pointing out that administration of arts grants was
devolved to a separate committee of the council, unlike the nationwide
remits for the heritage, charities, and millenium funds, around which
much of the controversy has arisen.
The lottery committee currently has some #29m to distribute, and as of
yesterday, had awarded only #6.3m. Mr Brown rejected any suggestion that
the money was not being disbursed quickly enough, pointing out that
applications had to meet certain criteria -- including the availability
of partnership funding and broad public access.
However, he said that, because it was limited to capital projects, the
lottery was currently not the answer to the problems of the arts
council, which found itself forced to cut revenue funding from some
organisations in order to encourage new work. Citing the controversial
removal of the grant to Musselburgh's Brunton Theatre, he said:
''Something has got to give in a period of standstill or modestly
increasing funding.
''In time a relaxation of the rules to allow revenue funding must
come. But if the capital restriction is lifted, the lottery funds should
be used to support additional and not existing activity.
''That would not only avoid the danger of subsistitution, but would
demonstrate to those who buy lottery tickets and have an interest in
where the proceeds go that their money is creating new and additional
services, not shoring up inadequate state funding,'' said Mr Brown.
As Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley begins a consultation
exercise on the future use of lottery funds, the Scottish Arts Council
will be arguing that its remit should include improving access to the
arts, and funding education and participative work.
SAC director Ms Seona Reid said that the council's new education
officer, Ms Sylvia Dow, was working with the University of Stirling on a
proposed study into the long-term impacts of the arts in education.
Ms Reid expressed concerns about the effect of local government
reorganisation on arts funding and praised Glasgow's initiative in
creating a fund to tide voluntary organsiations over the transition
period, which the Scottish Office appears unwilling to do.
She quantified the council's own inability to meet the demands on its
resources by pointing out that, over the period of the report, the SAC
recieved 2122 project applications for a total of #11m, but were able to
offer only 1284 grants worth #4m.
''In other words, only 60% of applications were successful, providing
only 36% of what was applied for. There is so much talent and so many
imaginative ideas which we are unable to support for the want of a mere
#7m,'' she said.

MINI TOUR
WHILE the Three Lochs tour -- featuring Loch Lomond, Loch Long and the
Gare Loch -- has been popular for generations, changes have been made
recently to its road network and amenities.
This version starts in Helensburgh, where Charles Rennie Mackintosh's
Hill House is an architectural landmark worth seeking out. Behind it is
the Helensburgh Upland Way, rougher and wetter than the Highlandman's
Way which it joins farther west.
Leave Helensburgh on the A814 for Rhu and Shandon on the Gare Loch.
Drum, the largest yacht in Clyde waters, is often moored off Rhu marina.
After the Faslane Peace Camp, the road is flanked by the forbidding
fences of the Clyde Submarine Base.
Turn right as for Arrochar then right to Loch Lomond. A view indicator
near highest point refers you to the beautifully wooded islands in Loch
Lomond, as well as Goat Fell on Arran and the faraway Ochil Hills.
Turn left onto the A82, then right for Luss, and park as indicated at
the far end of the village. The Loch Lomond Park Centre here is open at
most weekends till Christmas. It includes informative displays on the
loch's history, geology and wildlife .
Paths lead to a picnic area, the loch shore, and into Luss itself, the
picturesque village in a spectacular setting which features in Take the
High Road as Glendarroch. There is a pleasant water's-edge stroll, and a
little cruise boat sails.
Turn right to rejoin the A82. Dramatic views appear of Ben Lomond and
the press of mountains around the head of the loch.
Tiny Inverbeg accommodates a coaching inn, a tucked-away jetty, an art
gallery and a walk above the rapids of the Douglas Water.
The car park and picnic area at Firkin Point has the same opening
arrangements as the centre at Luss. Facing the majestic forested slopes
of Ben Lomond's Ptarmigan Ridge, the old road is now an easy,
all-weather walk.
Continue on the A82 to Tarbet. Cruises to the north end of the loch
begin here. Take the A83 as for Campbeltown.
On the right, the Black Sheep restaurant and craft shop provides
informal parking for two quite strenuous forest walks. A map is
displayed above the nearby railway station.
Continue into Arrochar at the head of Loch Long. A short, steep walk
to the Cobbler viewpoint starts opposite the post office. Leave the
village on the hump-backed A814 as for Helensburgh, pass an MoD jetty,
then the deep-water oil terminal at Finn art.
At a roundabout, turn right as for RNAD Coulport. Left at a
crossroads, right at a T-junction, then left into Cove Conservation
Park.
It concentrates on rare and common domestic fowl and livestock, and on
conservation features like wind turbines, solar panels and low-energy
lighting. The tearoom offers an elevated view over Loch Long,
Ardentinny, Gairletter Point and Blairmore.
Leaving the park, turn right. Left at a T-junction into Garelochhead,
then right on the A814, and return to Helensburgh after about 56 miles.

Feyenoord 1, Everton 0
Agg: 1-0
EVERTON won the European Cup-winners' Cup in the Kuip Stadium,
Rotterdam, 10 years ago, but it was not a case of a happy return for the
English cup winners last night when they were eliminated from this
year's tournament by Feyenoord.
The sides drew 0-0 at Goodison recently, but the Dutch side broke the
deadlock in the second leg when Regi Blinker scored for Feyenoord after
40 minutes.
Larsson's pass appeared to have found Iwan stranded in an offside
position, but no flag came and the cross was met by Obiku who nudged the
ball against a post.
John Ebbrell picked up the rebound and the danger seemed over until
his pass was intercepted by Blinker. The #2m Blackburn target cracked
the ball back past Neville Southall.
Everton faced a wall of sound from 40,000 home supporters, but they
kept to their task well and threatened Feyenoord at every opportunity.
Joe Royle's side's best chance in the second half came after 58
minutes when Paul Rideout sent a powerful drive flashing just wide.
Everton drove forward in a bid to rescue their 12-match unbeaten
European record, but as tempers frayed Craig Short was sent off for
retaliating to a Ronald Koeman challenge.

Celtic 0, Paris SG 3
Agg: 0-4
CELTIC crashed out of Europe last night. They had believed that they
could overturn the one-goal lead Paris St Germain had brought with them
from the first leg of this European Cup-winners' Cup tie.
But six first-half minutes destroyed their hopes.
Patrice Loko scored two goals, the first in 36 minutes, and the next
just three minutes from half-time, and Celtic's dream had died.
In the second half, the French side's substitute Pascal Nouma, who had
replaced the Loko, struck himself. His goal after 67 minutes made the
score 3-0 and at that, many of the 34,822 crowd left the stadium.
It was another sad night for Celtic, and indeed, for Scottish
football.
Celtic moved into the match knowing that victory would mean they could
survive in Europe.
But, they knew, too, that they would be walking a tightrope for much
of the game against the French side.
One goal lost would demand that Celtic would have to score three to
take them into the quarter-finals of the tournament. Two goals lost
would mean they would need four goals to take them through. And before
half-time, sadly, that was the prospect which faced the Scottish Cup
holders.
The Paris team, leading 1-0 from the first-leg, had said that they
would attempt to kill off the challenge from the Glasgow side.
Their manager, Luis Fernandez, said that he wanted an early goal --
and while he may have wanted one sooner, that goal arrived in 36
minutes.
Then, to add to Celtic's woes, another arrived three minutes before
half-time.
These six minutes of disaster left the Parkhead men looking for a
miracle -- and not even their most fervent fans in the 34,822 capacity
crowd believed that miracle might be possible.
The first blow to their hopes came when Gordon Marshall parried a shot
from Laurent Fournier. The ball rebounded from the keeper and there was
Patrice Loko lurking on his own and able to steer the ball past the
Gordon Marshall and into the net.
And now Celtic had to face the probability of defeat.
Six minutes later the second goal arrived. This time it was Vincent
Guerin who swept in a cross from the right, and it was Loko once more at
the near post who met the ball and sent it beyond Marshall and into the
net, as the Paris fans celebrated in the stands and the players, on the
field, realised that any doubts they may have had were now gone.
Celtic, naturally, had made openings themselves. But, just as
naturally for the Parkhead men at the moment, these were missed.
In the first minute, John Collins sent Pierre van Hooydonk through and
into the penalty box, and the Dutchman sent his shot off target.
There were signs that the French were ready to mix it, and Paul McStay
was left lying prostrate on the turf after a wild, waist-high challenge
from Daniel Bravo.
It was 22 minutes before the Glasgow side were able to have a try on
target.
Stephane Mahe hacked down van Hooydonk. The Frenchman was injured
himself in making the challenge, and as he limped off, McStay sent the
free kick quickly to Rudi Vata. The Albanian moved down the right wing,
fired in a cross which Andy Walker reached. The striker's header was
pushed away for a corner by Bernard Lama.
The Panamanian, Dely Valdes, replaced Mahe and settled in comfortably
and Celtic began to find themselves being caught by the counter-attacks
of the French side.
There were warnings before the goals arrived, particularly when
Marshall was forced to save from Loko.
Then, the player who spent so many months in mental hospitals, struck
with these two goals before half-time.
Celtic would not admit it, nor would their loyal fans, but with these
goals the game was over.
Simon Donnelly replaced Rudi Vata at the start of the second half,
with Celtic realising that only all-out attack could rescue them from
the disastrous situation they had found themselves in.
Before the match, defender John Hughes raced over to the new stand
urging the support to back the team in their bid for survival.
But by now it was surely a lost cause.
In 55 minutes Celtic had their best scoring opportunity of the game. A
corner from Tosh McKinlay on the left reached Van Hooydonk. He shot, but
his effort was stopped on the line by Vincent Guerin.
Soon afterwards, the tormentor-in-chief, Loko, limped off to be
replaced by Pascal Nouma, and then in 62 minutes, Brian McLaughlin took
over from Van Hooydonk.
Then Celtic came close to scoring in an amazing scramble around the
goal, McLaughlin and Walker had tries blocked, and then Andreas Thom has
a shot stopped by the acrobatic, but eccentric, Lama.
Just as Rangers had been punished 24 hours earlier when they allowed
goal chances to elude them, Celtic dropped into the same trap.
In 64 minutes they lost a third goal. Youri Djorkaeff, who had scored
the goal in the Parc des Princes two weeks earlier, burst down the
right. He fended off the challenge from John Hughes, and as the Celtic
central defender slid hopelessly to the ground, drew the ball back and
crossed low for Pascal Nouma who was able to take his time before
guiding the ball into goal.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, Hughes, Grant, Thom, McStay,
van Hooydonk, Walker, Collins. Substitutes -- Donnelly, Kerr,
McLaughlin, Falconer, McQuilken.
PARIS ST GERMAIN -- Lama, Cobos, Colleter, Mahe, Le Guen, Djorkaeff,
Bravo, Guerin, Fournier, Rai, Loko. Substitutes -- Dely Valdes, Dieng,
Llacer, Nouma, Dutruez.
Referee -- K Rothlisberger (Switzerland).

BETWEEN races, David Coulthard took time off to visit the Transport
Research Laboratory in Berkshire and help launch a new Scottish product
called Tyresafe. Developed by Xantak Chemicals of Glasgow, it is a
treatment for sealing the kind of punctures caused by nails and other
spiky bits.
Such products, usually silicone based, have been marketed in the past
but, with some, users found that a lumpy deposit could build up on the
inside of the tyre. Tyresafe is a water-based glycol solution which
should not provoke the same effect. It costs #19.95 for a litre bottle,
enough to treat five tyres (including the spare). Application is a DIY
affair, via the tyre valve. Xantak reckons that one treatment should
last a tyre's lifetime.
David Coulthard showed the efficiency of the system by driving over a
bed of nails, much the same kind of trick as the one by which Erik
Carlsson used to show off the stability of a front-wheel drive Saab --
though in that case the tyre stayed punctured.

GARY Armstrong's rehabilitation continued yesterday when he was named
as captain of the Scotland A side to play Western Samoa at Hawick on
Sunday week.
Details of the imaginative selection -- some of it, in truth, dictated
by injuries to players higher up the ladder -- were given in Edinburgh
yesterday just as the Samoans arrived in the capital after a 51-hour
trip which included 36 hours in the air.
The Scottish side has a handy balance of players with a proven track
record, a sprinkling of fringe players who get their chance because of
the knock-on injury effect, and three or four whose soaring Premiership
form has catapulted them into the international limelight.
Very definitely in the final category is Hawick fly-half Scott Welsh
who will partner Armstrong at half-back and assume the mantle of
goal-kicker. Similarly, Gala flanker John Amos, Hawick's Ian Elliot, and
Brian Renwick are three forwards of different vintage but each of whom
have been there or thereabouts and who have caught the eye during a
cut-throat domestic season. There is, too, Stuart Lang, a full back with
Lomu-esque proportions -- 6ft 5in., 16st. -- who has burst on to the
national stage spectacularly quickly after his shift from Kelso to
Goldenacre.
Yesterday, Armstrong, whose fortune appears at last to have turned,
was in Inverness on a signing mission with his new autobiography. The
Jed-Forest player, who last played international rugby against Ireland
in 1994 and who earlier this week was referred to by Newcastle's Rob
Andrew as the best scrum half in the world, declared: ''I'm delighted to
be back. It's just good to be involved again. I was aiming to get into
the A team but to be made captain is a real bonus.''
Armstrong recalled that when last he captained a team at Mansfield
Park -- Combined Scottish Districts against Auckland -- he had been on
the winning side. ''Maybe it's an omen that my luck has turned at
last,'' he said.
The other main talking point is the selection of Bath's Eric Peters at
blindside wing-forward. It has been a funny old week for Peters. First
he was omitted from the full international side and now he has been
switched from No.8 to No.6 in the shadow side.
Manager Douglas Morgan said yesterday: ''Obviously, Eric is going to
be very disappointed about missing out on the national side. He is in an
unfortunate situation at Bath where he cannot always get first XV rugby
week in and week out.
''However, the games he has had have been at No.6 and when we looked
at Peters and Renwick as back-row players we reckoned the best
combination was Eric at wing-forward and Brian at No.8.''
Interestingly, Morgan added that it would undoubtedly be of benefit to
the amiable Peters -- who only a few days ago was being spoken about as
a future Scotland captain -- if he were to be guaranteed first XV rugby
and yes, of course, that would probably be the case in Scotland.
The added incentive for those performing in the A game is to win a
place on the bench for the big game at Murrayfield six days later.
Coach Graham Hogg said the side -- which would provide interesting
competition for the Big Team announced on Tuesday -- had been chosen
with the virtue of attack very much in mind.
''There's a lot of pace there, especially within the back three.
Against the Samoans it will, of course, have to defend strongly as well
but we certainly want to play attacking rugby.''
The Samoans, who it should be recalled were World Cup
quarter-finalists, just like Scotland, and who defeated a Scotland XV
28-11 in Apia two years ago, have four games on the Scottish leg of
their Anglo-Scottish trip -- against Edinburgh on Wednesday, Scotland A
on the Sunday, North and Midlands on November 14, and the Murrayfield
Test four days later.
The 30-strong party -- 17 of whom play in New Zealand -- has
undoubtedly been weakened to some extent by defections to rugby league.
Coach Bryan Williams said yesterday that the six players who had gone
had been influenced by the decision by South Africa, Australia, and New
Zealand to exclude the Pacific Islanders from the new, professional
International Provincial competition that replaces the Super 10 series.
However, the former All Black winger revealed that a new tournament
involving Canada, USA, Argentina, Japan, Hong Kong, Fiji, Tonga, and
Western Samoa was now on the drawing board.
''It was a big set-back to be excluded from the Super 10 and that was
when half a dozen of our better players left for rugby league. But we
can't wait around for people to come to our rescue and so we've taken
the initiative with this Pan Pacific tournament. Subject to satisfacory
financial arrangements being made, we hope that it will go ahead next
year.''
''I won't put extra pressure on them by naming them but we've got a
few young boys who could make a name for themselves over here. We've
also got a Tuigamala in the party,'' said Williams.
Kaisa Tuigamala, a 22-year-old centre, is no relation to Vaiga of that
ilk, who predated Jonah Lomu in the big-hitting superstar league and was
across here with the All Blacks at the 1991 World Cup before moving on
to rugby league. Back in 1991, mere mention of the name put the fear of
death into opposing wingers. Yesterday, the name-dropping Williams
smiled as he said it.

JONATHAN Davies will make his much-heralded rugby union return for
Cardiff on Sunday.
Just two days after completing his transfer from rugby league club
Warrington, Cardiff confirmed that he will be in their side for the
rearranged Heineken League Division One match with Aberavon at the Arms
Park.
The return of Davies is expected to attract a bumper 14,000 crowd and
the former Wales captain admits that he is ''nervous'' about the match.
Having quit union seven years ago to make his name in rugby league
with Widnes and Warrington, Davies is now expected to make an immediate
impact.
''The expectations are great and the pressures are back on my
shoulders,'' said the 33-year-old Davies at a press conference in
Cardiff yesterday.
''I have handled those sort of pressures before, though I know I will
be nervous when I meet the players at training.
''My first aim is to justify my place in the Cardiff team.
''Things won't happen overnight, the laws have changed and it is a
quicker game.''
Davies, who has yet to discover what position he will play, added: ''I
will play wherever Cardiff feel I can strengthen the side.
''After seven years it is all going to be a bit new to me. I might not
be quite the same player as when I left Wales but I have learnt a lot of
other things along the way. Hopefully, I can show people how much I
enjoy the game.''
* HIGHLY-rated full-back Tim Stimpson has been appointed captain of
struggling Courage League division one club West Hartlepool, new
Scottish captain Rob Wainwright's club.
Stimpson has been in brilliant form despite West's slump to the bottom
of the division one table following a run of eight successive defeats --
and his displays prompted England manager Jack Rowell to name him in the
original 35-man squad for this month's Twickenham Test against World Cup
winners South Africa.
He takes over from Phil Lancaster, who has been unable to find the
winning habit despite a number of encouraging displays by the team, and
is determined to reverse the slide towards division two.
''Everyone is aware that we haven't produced the results that were
expected so far this season,'' admitted Stimpson as he issued a rallying
call to the players who backed his appointment.
''We should have won as many as four games already. A side that was
within a whisker of beating both Bath and Leicester this season does not
become a bad team overnight,'' he added.
West will attempt to chalk up their first league win of the season at
Wasps on Saturday.
''Talk of a club crisis is rubbish,'' maintained Stimpson. ''There
remains tremendous ambition at the club and we intend to ensure a future
at the very top of the English game and a place in Europe for the coming
years.''
* FORMER Welsh and British Lions No.8 Alun Pask was killed on
Wednesday night when fire swept through his home at Blackwood, Gwent.
Pask, 58, won 26 caps for Wales between 1961 and 1967, winning a
reputation as the best No.8 in Europe.
He played eight times for the British Lions, touring South Africa in
1962 and visiting Australia and New Zealand in 1966.

AMANDA Janes, the 17-year-old daughter of Christine Truman, led the
charge of the younger generation but Jo Durie and Jeremy Bates gave
notice that there is still life in the older players at the Guardian
Direct British National championships at Telford yesterday.
Janes pulled off the shock of the day by beating third seed Karen
Crossr 6-3, 7-5 to reach the semi-finals of the women's singles with a
net-rushing display.
But Durie, seven-times women's singles champion and playing this week
''only for fun'', also made the last four when she defeated Essex
teenager Mandy Wainwright 6-2 6-3.
Bates, the six-times men's singles champion, had a more difficult task
before going through to the last eight with a 6-3, 7-6 victory over
Bristol's Nick Gould.
Miles Maclagan and Andrew Richardson followed up their 6-2, 6-1
first-round win over Simon Booth and Richard Santy with a 6-3, 6-4
victory over David Ireland and Mark Schofield and will take on Paul Hand
and Gary Henderson for a place in tomorrow's final.
Ross Matheson and Luke Milligan beat James Fox and Dan Sanders 7-5,
4-6, 6-3 before going down 6-4, 6-4 to Bates and Tim Henman, while
Michele Mair and Abigail Tordoff upset second seeds Lizzie Jelfs and
Karen Cross 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 before bowing out 6-2, 6-4 to Lucie Ahl and Jo
Ward.

IAN MacNair gave up playing both shinty and rugby some years ago. A
Perth dentist, he points out that it would have been difficult to ply
his profession with knuckles or thumbs which had been put through the
sports field's mangle.
But his absence from competition has allowed him to get his teeth into
Herald Selector Rugby, and he has been extracted from some 5000 entrants
as the competitor with the best team for the month of October, winning
#500 and a case of champagne for his pains.
MacNair played centre or back row for Dalziel High School FP, Glasgow
University, and Perthshire. Just two games of shinty, and five
subsequent days off work with a hand blasted by caman shot, alerted him
to the career dangers, and he quit rugby aged 27, though he is still a
member of the Perthshire club.
His winning team, comprised of a premiership top league back division
which cost him so many points that he opted for a division two pack, is:
Gavin Hastings (Watsonians); Gary Parker (Melrose), Davie Stoddart
(Heriot's), Matt McGrandles, Kenny Logan (both Stirling County); Bryan
Easson (Boroughmuir), Bryan Redpath (Melrose); Neil McIlroy, Kevin
Barrie (both Jed-Forest), Sandy Crerar (West of Scotland), Stewart
Campbell (Dundee HS FP), Shade Munro, Murray Wallace (both GHK), Adam
Roxburgh, Stewart Bennett (both Kelso).
The leading 10 contenders for the month of October were:
1, I MacNair (Perth) 232; 2, R Cranston (Hawick) 228; 3, L Farquhar
(Kilmarnock) 219; 4, D Pearson (Edinburgh) 215; 5, D Hamilton (East
Kilbride) 213; 6, R Palmer (Edinburgh) 212; 7 (equal), J Macpherson
(Troon), G Neilson (Portobello) 209; 9, J McCusker (Dunblane) 208; 10
(equal), C Campbell (Bridge of Allan), M Wallace (Edinburgh) 207.
Despite scaling the heights for the month, MacNair does not feature
among the leading 50 chasing the overall prize, which is a trip for two
to see Scotland play the All Blacks in New Zealand. This includes
flights from Scotland and #1000 spending money.
Favourites for that prize must be the Greer family, from Kelvinside,
Glasgow, who have five teams in the top dozen, and 10 in the leading 40.
Husband Mark, a former Glasgow District scrum half, is the cumulative
leader to date with 476 points. His son, Luke, knows a remarkable amount
about the game for a lad of just nine months. Luke's entries are fourth
and fifth.
Luke's mum, Victoria, puts this down to a trip to the World Cup, in
South Africa -- the prize she won in the competition run by Scottish
Rugby magazine last season!
Victoria's best entry this time is joint eleventh, but she has another
two teams within 50 points of her husband's leading outfit, while her
brother-in-law, Simon, also has a XV in the top 10.
The leading 20 teams and ties, overall, at the end of October, were:
1, M Greer (Glasgow) 476 points; 2, A Barnett (Glasgow) 475; 3, A
Donaldson (Balerno) 464; 4, L Greer (Glasgow) 463; 5, L Greer (Glasgow)
461; 6 (equal), I McAslan (Glasgow), N Anderson (Edinburgh) 458; 8, S
Greer (Bishopbriggs) 447; 9, M Greer (Glasgow) 444; 10, J Morrow
(Saltcoats) 443; 11 (equal), V Cassidy (Glasgow), A Donaldson (Balerno)
441; 13, Hodge and Jennings (Edinburgh) 440; 14, C Ritchie (Bridge of
Allan) 439; 15 (equal), G Sutherland (Hawick), D Beckwith (Troon) 437;
17, E Donaldson (Balerno) 436; 18, D Andrew (Glasgow) 434; 19, D Baird
(Alloway) 433; 20 (equal), D Robertson (Hillhead), R MacDonald
(Neilston) 430.
We note Ally Donaldson, of Balerno, the highest individual points
scorer in the competition with a team of his own up there in third
place. We will be watching closely, Ally, at the number of scoring
passes you deliver as the competition goes down to the wire.
* SCOTTISH Rugby has identified some minor discrepancies in a few
players' ratings, but none of these has influenced the winning of
prizes. The appropriate amendments have been included in the cumulative
ratings (below) to the end of October. No calls, please, to Scottish
Rugby or The Herald.

<HEADLINE>More tests to find why duke died</HEADLINE>

A CORONER ordered more tests yesterday after a post mortem examination
failed to show what killed the Duke of Northumberland.
West London coroner Dr John Burton told an inquest at Fulham Crown
Court that the duke had a complex medical history.
''A number of doctors had been providing treatment over many years but
none suspected a sudden death,'' said Dr Burton.
''So in a majority of cases where this happens the coroner asks for an
examination that gives the cause of death but sometimes if there is no
obvious cause we may need further tests.''
The 42-year-old bachelor duke -- the Queen's godson whose family seat
is Alnwick Castle in Northumberland -- died on Tuesday at his other
home, Syon House in Brentford, west London. He left a fortune estimated
at #115m.
The 11th duke was identified under his full name of Henry Alan Walter
Richard Percy.
Coroner's officer Michael Walsh said the duke was diagnosed in April
this year as suffering from ME -- but had the condition well before
this. The duke had also suffered from depression, had difficulty
sleeping and had to take sleeping tablets.
Mr Walsh said Dr Richard Shepherd of London's Guy's Hospital, who
carried out a post-mortem examination, had not been able to find any
natural causes and further tests on blood samples were being carried
out.
The inquest was adjourned for a month and Dr Burton signed an order
releasing the body to allow the funeral to take place.
The funeral was provisionally set to take place at St Michael's
Church, near Alnwick Castle, on Saturday.
The title now passes to the duke's brother, Lord Ralph Percy. He is
the third Duke of Northumberland in successive generations to inherit
the title due to the untimely death of an elder brother.
Meanwhile, former James Bond actress Barbara Carrera said she had been
fearing the early death of her close friend, the duke.
News of his death came as she was taking part in a film shoot in
Mexico.
Nicaragua-born Miss Carrera said: ''I half suspected something like
this would happen.
''He was a very sick man but he wasn't the sort of person who went on
about his illness all the time. I don't think even his doctors could pin
down exactly what it was.''

IT has been a drab Flat season for owner Robert Aird, who has five
horses with Jack Berry, but, at Edinburgh yesterday, he recouped some of
his losses when Best of All (33-1) trotted up in the Ladbroke On-Course
Handicap.
Best of All won as a two-year-old but has been out of form this
season. Its best performance was at Ascot in July when it finished
seventh in a six-furlong sprint.
Aird, who has business interests in Ayrshire, said: ''This is the
worst season I've had as an owner. In 1994 we had nine winners, all with
Jack Berry, but this is my first success this season and it's come in
the last Flat race in Scotland for 1995.''
0 It was Berry's first winner for more than a month.
Champion jockey Frankie Dettori, who rode in five of the six races,
had to wait until the second-last before tasting success. When it came
it was an impressive performance by the Sheikh Mohammed two-year-old
colt Santillana.
The 2-5 favourite hardly broke sweat in winning the EBF Tennents Lager
Maiden Stakes from Classic Ballet (25-1).
When Dettori asked him to quicken approaching the final furlong
Santillana cruised into the lead to win cosily.
Richard Quinn seldom visits Edinburgh but the Scot showed he still
knows his way around the Musselburgh track when he won the #6000 feature
race, the Tennents November Handicap on 5-1 joint favourite Merit.
Quinn, scoring his 111th win of the season, was so far ahead in the
final furlong that he eased his mount considerably but still came home
five lengths ahead of the runner-up, Tremendisto (14-1).
Merit, trained at Newmarket by Paul Cole and owned by Prince Fahd
Salman, was Quinn's only ride of the meeting. The three-year-old took up
the running three furlongs out and was never troubled.
Gary Bardwell took the Leonard Thomson Bites The Dust fillies'
handicap on LA Brief (14-1) after the 4-1 favourite, Slimatt, had become
stuck in the stalls. LA Brief won from Tethys, while the favourite
finished well down the field.
Bardwell completed a 104-1 double when Prospector's Cove (6-1) took
the Peterborough Software Maiden Auction Stakes on his first time out.

THE Sarazen World Open has been reduced to three rounds because of
rain. Only three hours' play was possible in yesterday's first round
before a torrential downpour forced officials to call a halt at the
Chateau Elan course outside Atlanta.
Some 45 players teed off before the suspension, but no-one completed
the round. Swedes Anders Forsbrand (12 holes) and Per-Ulrik Johansson
(10 holes), Americans Craig Stadler (eight holes), Fuzzy Zoeller (eight
holes) and South African-based Englishman Chris Williams (seven holes)
share the lead at three under par.
Sam Torrance's threesome, which included defending champion Ernie Els
and Open champion John Daly, did not tee off.
* IAN Woosnam opened his bid for victory in the Alfred Dunhill Masters
in Jakarta with a five-under-par 67, one stroke behind two Australians,
Craig Parry and Paul Gow, and Sweden's Mathias Gronberg. Leading
first-round scores (Australian unless otherwise stated):
66 -- M Gronberg (Sweden), P Gow, C Parry.
67 -- I Woosnma (Wales), D Podlich.
68 -- E Droop, D Zarate (Philippines), G Chalmers, Scott Laycock.
69 -- D Bransdon, S Appleby, S Owen (New Zealand), C Gray, F Casas
(Philippines), D Cole, M Allen, M Campbell (New Zealand), G Ghei
(India), G Joyner, G Kenny.
* SCOTLAND'S Myra McKinlay, a member of the winning 1994 Curtis Cup
side, will make her second appearance at the American Express Tour
qualfying school later this month.
McKinlay, who failed to earn an exempt place last March, will return
to La Manga in Spain at the end of the month in pursuit of one of the 40
player's cards.
Karin Ross, Tracey Craik, Lindsey Irvine and Morag Wright are the
other Scottish players in the field, which also includes England
international Sandy Lambert.

GARY Armstrong and Doddie Weir will know within a fortnight whether or
not they are to join Newcastle. They have been made offers which do not
quite come up to scratch and rugby director Rob Andrew has said he will
get back to them within a few days.
Both players were mightily impressed with the facilities at the club
which millionaire Sir John Hall intends turning into the best side in
Europe. They were, though, more than a little taken aback by the media
presence which greeted their arrival on Wednesday.
They signed preliminary registration forms last week and had assumed
that the only topic on the agenda on Wednesday was lunch with Sir John.
There remains, still, some tough talking to be done but, all else being
equal, both players will move south.
Sources on Tyneside have indicated that the players have been offered
a six-figure, three-year deal with bonus, car, and job packages thrown
in. Other players who have signed already for Newcastle are on around
#50,000 a year, plus all the fringe benefits.
The money which Sir John Hall is able to generate for the club game in
England is on a different plane to that being talked about in Scotland.
For instance, The Herald understands that the Scottish Rugby Union is
offering contracts worth about #20,000 to its international squad.
The contracts are understood to offer an across-the-board payment of
some #5000 for squad membership plus match fees of around #2000 for the
21 players involved on match days.
There is also provision for bonuses but the document, which is
essentially a contract of employment, also proposes restrictions on what
players may or may not do, such as speaking to the media.
Armstrong, whose post-injury rehabilitation continued yesterday with
selection as captain of Scotland A to play Western Samoa, said: ''We
were both taken aback at the reception we got at Newcastle but we had a
good meeting with Sir John and Rob and the negotiations are
continuing.''
Weir added: ''You can't be expected to make a decision like this in
five days. I'm speaking to my current employers, who have been very good
to me, my family, and my club.
''Before I make a final decision, I also want to talk it over with the
SRU's director of rugby, Jim Telfer.
''So far as an exodus of players from Scotland is concerned, I think
the time is fast approaching when clubs are going to have to look really
hard at what is happening elsewhere.''

AT least the Celtic fans emerged with credit last night from the
latest Euro disaster to strike Scottish soccer, writes Ken Gallacher.
After their team had crashed out of the European Cup-winners' Cup to
Paris St Germain manager Tommy Burns praised the backing they had given
to him and to his players.
''It meant a lot to me to hear them singing my name even when we were
three goals down,'' he said. ''They deserve to have the best team we can
give them and I wish I had a magic wand I could wave and do that for
them. But we will get there.
It took Celtic a long, long time to fall by the wayside and we need
time to get the club back. But we will not be deflected from that.''
French coach Luis Fernandez joined Burns in his praise. He commented:
''The atmosphere was magnificent. I have to thank the Celtic support for
making it such a memorable night for us.
''We played particularly well tonight in a game which we believed
would be very difficult for us.
''I think it is harder for British teams in Europe than it is for us.
We play fewer league games in a season and our national association
helps us as much as possible when we are preparing for a game in one of
the major European tournaments. That does not happen here.''

ALWAYS bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more
important than any other one thing.
Scottish football is determined to succeed. The Scottish Football
Association (SFA) is proud of its development activities and those who
direct, administer and participate in such a vital programme. The SFA
council promote a wide range of people-based educational initiatives
encompassing areas such as development plans for various age levels.
Additionally, leaders' courses, coach education programmes, and law of
the game courses form an intrinsic part of the overall awareness
schemes.
These activities are vigorously led by a team of highly skilled and
motivated managers, assisted by enthusiastic football lovers throughout
Scotland. The spirit in which this important work is conducted is best
summarised by our motto -- Football Is Fun.
If you find that these words and the image conveyed render you a
little uneasy, if not querulous, please pause momentarily . . . steel
yourself for what is now to follow.
The SFA schemes, including the successful community coach and
development officer network (26 around Scotland), spread the soccer
sevens philosophy aided by the SFA's mini-goalposts promotion and
back-up material in the form of teaching videos and publications. These
activities are providing stepping stones to progress. Last year, 34,367
boys and girls were involved in SFA community coach school visits.
It is important to stress that, contrary to the expectation levels in
some quarters, no magical formula exists to immediately improve the
skills and structure of our game. Whatever lies ahead will involve hard
work, resource, dedication of the football teachers at all levels, and
probably a major strategy rethink by certain of our members.
The network of football ambassadors in our technical programme creates
a base to expand our community-based programmes and nurture the growing
interest in our sport.
A significant part of the role of the SFA, to foster and develop
football, is in the form of coach education and it may be of interest to
reflect upon the statistics involved. The top coaching award in Scotland
is the 'A' licence and, currently, 284 leaders have achieved this level.
The ladder then moves to the 'B' licence, where we find that 500 men
and women possess this football teaching qualification. For minor club
coaches and youth leaders, teachers and others involved in sport and
leisure we have a succession of three levels -- the 'C' certificate,
held by 2556 people, and the highly attractive and non time consuming
'D' and 'E' certificates currently held by 4096 and 2068 men and women
respectively. This is targeted at the children's level of football
tuition.
This satisfies, I think, those who enquire if there is an appetite for
football education. But if any further evidence is required, reference
can easily be made to the SFA courses in 1995, which have attracted
37,116 young people in total to our soccer centres and development
courses, the exciting football festivals and fund days, and the well
attended goalgetters' courses. The growth of small-sided games and mini
soccer leagues is further proof the way ahead is already charted.
What is our game without the referee? He is the sole arbiter and a
major influence on our game. We require to attract, train and retain
interested men and women to the world of refereeing. At present, we have
over 2000 registered referees, and we have 33 fully qualified referee
instructors throughout Scotland.
Our refereeing branches are led by 24 referee supervisors and it is
worthy of note that in season 1994/95 these supervisors produced
assessments on referees and linesmen on 1369 occasions. This scrutiny
aids development.
The opening words of this article doubles as the SFA's mission
statement -- we care about football and we care about people.
The SFA readily acknowledges the tremendous support received from many
sectors of Scottish life, and to serve our community and to attempt to
match its aspirations we need more friends, additional links with
central and local government, and support from those responsible for the
disbursement of grant aid and lottery monies.
As we move confidently towards the year 2000 it would be extremely
fitting if that milestone welcomed a completed National Stadium at
Hampden -- Scotland's 'Field of Dreams' would then complement the
striking array of modern stadia in our country and put it on the
European and world list for the prestigious events which bring
substantial economic benefit to our wider community.
The only limits are, as always, those of vision.
Please consider playing a part in building football's future.

<TEXT>
ENGLAND'S battle plan is in danger of being redrawn before the winter
Test series against South Africa even starts.
Robin Smith's third failure in as many innings and Graham Thorpe's
return home on compassionate grounds has left two question marks hanging
over the tourists' top order.
Thorpe should be back in South Africa next week after comforting his
wife, who has lost the baby the couple were expecting, but it means
that, at best, the left-hander will play only one first-class match
ahead of the opening Test in Pretoria.
Of even more concern, however, is Smith. He insists he feels good in
the nets, but scores of four and nought at Soweto last week and now a
third-ball duck against Border cannot fill manager Ray Illingworth with
confidence.
Smith desperately wants to do well, but the same can be said of John
Crawley and Mark Ramprakash -- and they are producing the goods.
Crawley added an undefeated 87 to the 85 he made in Soweto last week.
Neither innings could be described as pretty, but both were effective.
Ramprakash made 70 off only 97 deliveries, nine 4s and a 6 underlining
his natural sense of timing on a pitch where fluent strokeplay was not
easy.
Alec Stewart (11) fell to 18-year-old fast bowler Makhaya Ntini,
clipping a catch to mid-wicket, but he has two big innings in Soweto at
the back of him.A second-wicket stand of 120 was ended when Ramprakash
drove medium-pacer Brenden Fourie off the back foot to cover. Smith
safely negotiated the next two deliveries but then went half-forward to
Fourie, missed and was adjudged lbw.
England finished the day on 218 for four, despite losing the morning
session to a saturated outfield and, late on, Graeme Hick (18) to a
catch behind off the bowling of Frans Cronje.

ABERDEEN'S Ray McKinnon and Paul Kane were last night locked in
transfer talks to take them to Tayside.
Dundee United have offered #200,000 to bring midfield player McKinnon
back to Tannadice while St Johnstone are confident of landing Kane in a
cut-price #100,000 deal.
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said: ''I have agreed fees with both clubs
and now the situation lies in the hands of the players.
Dons defender Colin Woodthorpe yesterday had the plaster removed from
his broken foot and was immediately set a Coca-Cola Cup final target.
Aitken added: ''We will assess Woodthorpe in training but if his
comeback goes smoothly then he should be aiming for a place against
Dundee. Brian Irvine and Michael Watt come into the same category. I
want all three available for Hampden.''
* STENHOUSEMUIR'S Norwegian fan club are flying in for the biggest day
in the club's history. And one fan is even breaking off a business trip
to New York for Sunday's Challenge Cup final against Dundee United.
The second division club are in their first final and will have around
2000 supporters backing them at McDiarmid Park.
Secretary David Reid said: ''We know we will be outnumbered but our
fans intend to enjoy themselves. Our Norwegian fans would not miss this.
They wait every Saturday for our result and for details of the game, and
11 are flying in from Norway while another, who is in business in New
York, is coming from there. They all say that they want to be part of a
major day for the club.''
* RAITH Rovers and Morton have both been fined #100 by the SFA for
fielding players without receiving the necessary international
clearance.
The Fifers included Bosnian Dino Valentic in a reserve match in
August. They are still having difficulty getting a work permit for him.
Morton included their Cameroon keeper Andre Boe, also in a reserve
match in August. But since then they have received the necessary
clearance for him.
* NORWICH striker Robert Fleck has been fined #1000 and warned about
his future conduct after being found guilty of misconduct by the
Football Association.
Fleck was punished following an incident during a League game with
Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on September 9 when he abused an
official after being substituted.
In addition to the fine and the warning, the Scot was ordered to pay
the costs of the hearing.
* EUROPE'S top brass will today unveil their reaction to the threat
posed to the game by the Jean-Marc Bosman case which has had the
transfer system ruled illegal.

<TEXT>
RONALD Koeman last night was accused of foul play in a tackle with
Craig Short during Everton's European Cup-winners' Cup exit against
Feyenoord in Rotterdam.
Short, and Everton manager Joe Royle, pointed an accusing finger at
the former Dutch internationalist. Towards the end of a tense tie,
Koeman clumsily challenged Short who retaliated by flicking out an arm
and was sent off.
''Craig has six inches of bruising and scarring down his shin,'' said
Royle. ''You can't argue about retaliation but I don't think the
perpetrator was even booked for the original challenge.
''It was one of the worst tackles I have seen this season. We needed a
break but the nearest we came to it was when Craig nearly got his leg
broken.''
Regi Blinker was the hero of the hour for the Dutch side, his
first-half goal being enough to send Everton tumbling out of the
competition.
Royle now faces the stiff task lifting his dejected players for the
weekend meeting with Premiership champions Blackburn, from which Everton
need some reward to avoid dropping into the relegation zone.
Meanwhile, Parma were in sparkling form, overcoming a three-goal
deficit against Sweden's Halmstadt to reach the quarter-final stage.
Parma, beaten 3-0 two weeks ago in Gothenburg, last night won 4-0,
with goals from Filippo Inzaghi, Dino Baggio, Hristo Stoichkov, and an
own-goal by Tony Andersson.
A surprised Parma coach, Nevio Scala, said after the game: ''I can
only thank my players, they were truly stupendous.''
Rapid Vienna recovered from a two-goal deficit to beat Sporting
Lisbon, winners of the trophy in 1964, 4-2, after Trifon Ivanov had
forced extra time with the Austrian side's second goal on the stroke of
normal time.
Holders Real Zaragoza survived constant attacks from Brugge and scored
on the break in the final minute through striker Dani Garcia to win the
second leg 1-0 away and beat the Belgians 3-1 on aggregate.
Borussia Moenchengladbach also won 1-0 away with a goal by Stefan
Effenberg for a 5-1 aggregate victory over AEK Athens, while Dynamo
Moscow lost 1-0 away to Hradec Kralove, of the Czech Republic, and, with
the aggregate score locked at 1-1, went through 3-1 on penalties.
In the UEFA Cup, Roberto Baggio, back in action following a knee
injury, scored both of AC Milan's goals in the first half in their 2-1
victory against Strasbourg.
Milan reached the third round on a 3-1 aggregate following their 1-0
first-leg win in France.
Midfield player Franck Sauzee scored for the French club, his powerful
free kick hitting the bar before bouncing into the Italian net.

* Sunday:  Glenrothes Motor Sport Club runs the Crail Stages Rally, a
round of the rather mysterious Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship whose
progress through the season is not widely publicised.
Unlike forest rallies, the events which count towards this
championship are usually single-venue affairs, at places like Knockhill,
Ingliston and -- in the case of the GMSC event -- the former Royal Naval
Air Station off the road between Crail and Fife Ness.
Surfaces at Crail are generally smooth.  The site will accommodate six
separate stages with a total distance of around 34 miles, making this a
good spectator event, since there is a fair amount of action visible in
a confined area.
Starting time is 09.00.  The entry list includes Gordon Stephen's
Darrian T9 and Bruce Edwards's Darrian T90, both with a fine
power-to-weight ratio, although the powerhouse of the day may turn out
to be Tom Morris's Metro 6R4.
* Sunday: The West of Scotland Kart Club runs a club meeting at the
Summerlee Raceway, Larkhall.  Practice is from 10.00, competition starts
an hour later, and there will be more than 20 separate races, heats and
finals, in up to six classes.

It might look small and vulnerable but Dave
Stewart's 1935 Austin Seven is tough and
surprisingly roomy, writes Ross Finlay
A PAWNBROKING lady from Brum sounds like the opening line of a
limerick, but Gertrude Fall of Birmingham was the original owner of a
beautiful little Austin Seven Ruby saloon, which has recorded only
67,000 miles in the 60 years since she bought it, and is well known in
Scottish classic car circles.
Miss Fall registered the Ruby in 1935. It was still in fine fettle in
October 1965 when she was driving it in Dumfries, and a con rod let go.
She arranged with a local garage to buy the remains.
A rather ladylike exchange of letters, now in present owner Dave
Stewart's collection, shows that she forwarded the car's paperwork, and
''I expect your cheque is in the post''.
Over the next 25 years, the car was never put back into running order.
Dave Stewart bought it in 1990, resprayed it in modern damask red, the
equivalent of Austin's original burgundy colour, and soon had it back on
the road.
The bodywork is in excellent condition. Indeed, the only places
needing attention in 1990 were where the sidelights are mounted on the
front wings, and at the foot of the door pillars.
The Stewarts take part in a couple of events each month during the
summer, and have driven the car as far away as Bristol and the Orkneys.
It has the familiar 747cc engine fitted to all Austin Sevens from their
launch as open two-seaters in 1922.
As the bodies became heavier, the engine was tuned to suit, and Dave
Stewart's disposes of a heady 23bhp. This lets it potter along normal
main roads at 30 to 35mph, although it will ''scoot along quite nicely''
at 45mph on motorways.
The Ruby saloon is unexpectedly roomy, and there is no buffeting when
the sunshine roof -- a #5 extra in 1935 -- is opened, because the flat
windscreen throws the airflow well overhead.
Dave Stewart is editor of the Scottish Austin Seven Club's magazine,
and points out that the worldwide Association of Austin Seven Clubs
provides not only replacements for ''wear-out'' parts, but also a
register of members willing to turn out to help other owners at a
breakdown.
However, Austin Sevens are sturdy little machines. The original design
had international ramifications. Sevens built under licence were
produced by Rosengart in France and Bantam in the US.  They were also
the first cars put on sale by BMW and the Japanese company which
eventually became Nissan.

CONTROVERSIAL land-owner, Mr Keith Schellenberg, was yesterday given a
cautious welcome to his new property in Argyll.
Local councillor Mr Robert Currie said he hoped the new owner of
Killean House and Estate would create jobs and bring tourism revenue to
mid Kintyre.
It is understood that Mr Schellenberg, the outspoken former owner of
Eigg, paid around #1.8m for the estate, which lies halfway between
Tarbert and Campbeltown and looks out on the island of Gigha.
The sale included 3000 acres of land -- which will be used mainly for
sheep-farming -- a number of holiday cottages and chalets, and the house
itself.
1 Mr Currie said the previous owner, an English solicitor, was
effectively an absentee landlord who ''didn't have a real interest in
the estate''.
Asked if he was daunted by the new owner's reputation, Mr Currie said:
''I have never met the man. I only know what I have read in the papers
-- and I don't believe everything I read.''

I SUPPOSE that you will be satisfied that with Jill Crawshaw's
articles you paid someone to produce a hatchet job on Scottish tourism
and she delivered.
Many of the criticisms of the tourism trade in Scotland may be valid
but I feel that her attack on Scottish Tourist Board staff and tourist
information staff was totally unjustified and added little to the
credibility of her case.
These hard-working staff do not set the strategy of tourism in
Scotland and cannot be held culpable for the system under which they
presently operate.
There is no complacency in Scottish tourism. STB and the area tourist
boards are committed to improving standards for the customer and
providing appropriate training for TIC staff and the trade. The trade
must play their part in committing themselves to working with STB
towards a fully professional tourism industry that will correct the
faults highlighted by Ms Crawshaw.

THE sand of the desert was blinding hot. The vultures circled above.
They were surrounded, hugely outnumbered and outgunned. They knew the
fate that awaited them at the hands of the devilish opponents who had
ruthlessly worn them down. They would be, one has to record it, even in
a family newspaper, emasculated.
Yesterday may go down in the annals of Westminster as the last stand
of the awkward squad, the men and women who are temperamentally disposed
to make life difficult for the Government even if it's their own
Government.
So tormented have Ministers, both Labour and Tory, been by these
people, prepared to talk incessantly, initiate embarrassing debates,
force unexpected procedural votes, that undermining them, stealing their
weapons in the night has been a long-standing ambition.
The Labour leadership, convinced that for once they are going to win
an election quite soon, are having to start to think like the Ministers
they hope they will soon replace.
So, as the Commons, or about 20 of the 651 of them, discussed
important procedural changes, all was sweetness and light between the
two Front Benches. The changes, until now operating as experiments, get
MPs back to their constituencies earlier, give back benchers more time
to sponsor debates, keep them up late to vote less often.
A questionnairre of MPs revealed that the vast majority of them
thought the changes were a jolly good idea and wanted them made
permanent.
However, the old sweats like D Skinner (Bolsover) and T Dalyell
(Linlithgow and forever West Lothian) thought different. Over the years,
they argued, all the real opportunities to muck up Governments, even
occasionally stop them doing things, had been eroded by such changes.
From now on, they would almost vanish.
Tam poured scorn on limiting MPs to 10-minute speeches. Michael Foot
and others never would have been able to put Harold Wilson off the idea
of sending British troops to Vietnam if they had only been allowed
snippety speeches like that.
He fondly recalled how he and others by talking for a long time forced
the first Thatcher U-turn -- on Iranian sanctions. Ah yes, agreed
Dennis. In the old days, you could talk for ever on the Consolidated
Fund Bill and force the Government to bring in all its troops to crush
you. Now it ended demurely at an early hour with no vote. Could a back
bencher now slam down a highly critical notion and have it voted on? No.
Unusually, the Liberals were on the side of the big battalions. The
way the Commons conducted business was ''archaic, outmoded, out of
date'' said their Chief Whip Archy Kirkwood, adding that a lot more
reform was needed to make it fit to operate in the twenty-first century.
So, standing in the way of a really modern conveyor belt-method of
passing legislation and scrutinising the executive were now only a
bolshie few, it appeared.
In the first recorded instance of Mr Skinner showing compassion for
Conservatives, he pointed out to the two non-official Tories present
that, when Labour came to power, pretty soon they would find all the
good old ways of obstruction had gone. They would be unable to emulate
their predecessors who, he recalled with a certain grim satisfaction,
''gave the Callaghan Government hell.''
The rebels sought to resist progress, though they knew it was useless.
They were rolled over in one battle after another: -- 113-26, 143-19,
137-14, 165-17, 116-19, 120-12.
As the dust cleared and a new smooth-line model House of Commons of
the twenty-first century appeared in a mirage, a few survivors limped
away. Dennis and Tam will be back just as ready in the next Parliament
to call a Labour Government to account. Christopher Gill (Ludlow --
Con.) and Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East -- Con.) probably will be too.
This Sketch has faith that, despite Dennis's stirring eulogy to the
golden age of opposition, these men, and women like Teresa Gorman
(Billericay -- Con.), will find other ways of being awkward and will
recruit some new squaddies too. For the awkward squad we trust and hope
will always be with us, old soldiers who refuse to fade away.

ANTI-NUCLEAR activists in the Highlands yesterday launched an appeal
to fund a referendum in Caithness on Dounreay's plan to import thousands
of rods of spent nuclear fuel for reprocessing.
AEA Technology in Harwell also confirmed that 88-tonnes of irradiated
sodium -- believed to be from France -- was bound for treatment at the
plant in the New Year.
The organisers of the referendum appeal say it will cost #7500 for the
independent Electoral Reform Ballot Services to poll the county's 20,630
electorate probably before December to avoid the Christmas post.
Friends of the Earth has said it will make a contribution.
Launching the appeal Mr Stephen Pottinger, of the Caithness Against
Nuclear Dumping (Cand) group, said: ''We are supposed to live in a
democratic society and yet our Government is intent on railroading this
through without any thought to the interests of Caithness, the
Highlands, Scotland or her people. We want to give local people their
say.''
Mr Pottinger, who farms in Caithness, said that the local people had
supported Dounreay over many years. But after Chernobyl the industry
came under question. This had gained momentum in the late 1980s when
Nirex considered Dounreay as a possible site for Britain's first
national nuclear waste repository.
A referendum held in Caithness in 1990 on that issue had a 58% turnout
and recorded 74% against Nirex coming to Dounreay. Mr Pottinger said he
was convinced that if the foreign reprocessing proceeded Dounreay would
become a nuclear dump and Nirex would not be far behind.
Meanwhile, Dounreay trade unions thanked Labour front-bench spokesmen
Mr Brian Wilson and Mr John McAllion for their support in the recent
parliamentary debate when the SNP had called for a ban on any further
applications for discharge authorisations, which would be necessary if
the foreign reprocessing work was to go ahead.
An SNP spokesman said yesterday the party had no intention of changing
its campaign and indeed intended to announce plans to lobby the US
Consulate in Edinburgh over an American proposal to send fuel to
Dounreay. There were many thousands of jobs dependent on a clean
Highland environment he added.

HAVING just read about Jill Crawshaw's Tour of Scotland, I am not at
all surprised by her comments and observations on the way our country
appears to our tourists.
As an ex-employee of the renamed Edinburgh Tourist Board (then called
Edinburgh Marketing -- what?) we were instructed that on no account were
we allowed to make personal recommendations from our own experience
about places to stay, to visit and to eat in Edinburgh and the rest of
Scotland.
How are we to offer our visitors the best of our own country without
our information assistants using their own experiences and guiding the
visitors to make their own decisions about where they want to visit,
eat, and stay?

THE one good thing that Jill Crawshaw did on her American-style,
hatchet-job, tour of the Scottish Highlands was catch the plane in
Glasgow on the Monday morning -- Bon Voyage!
I have no intention of defending indefensible, low-standard hotels but
did Ms Crawshaw really expect the quality hotels on the Road to the Isle
to display a No Vacancy sign at the start of the A830, since she had no
intention of sampling quality intimate B&amp;Bs?
Back in Fort William the West Highland Museum observing the Sabbath
can hardly be described as ''most places closed''. Out of the 90-plus
attractions on the info sheet I know of only four that are closed on a
Sunday, at the end of September. Largely the Highland custom of closing
on a Sunday has been given over to tourism.
The fact that the tourist office has no allocation of hotel bed spaces
does not mean that the hotels are full -- witness the vacancy signs.
Was Ms Crawshaw looking for performing monkeys along the High Street?
-- ''not clad in tartan or from Taiwan''? This dear lady is unable to
use her own imagination for attractions and certainly did not enter into
the holiday spirit. What about the ''Great Outdoors'' that most people
come to the Highlands for? It doesn't close!
Unfortunately this lady seems consumed with cheapness -- equating it
to quality -- as well as a chip on her shoulder about our Scottish
history. Perhaps The Herald will up her fee next time to enable her to
sample some of our quality local fayre.
Hopefully this article will only be read by our fellow Scots, north of
the Border, who look for and find, in most cases, real and warm Highland
Hospitality.

WELL! All I can say is hats off to you for having had the ''courage''
to let her loose. The Herald has done much over the years to support our
industry (Tourism Oscars, etc) and I fervently hope that this resume of
Jill Crawshaw's will be equally beneficial for Scotland's tourist
industry.
One could spend endless time making excuses and finding other
countries that may be better or worse than Scotland, but the harsh truth
is that you have merely exposed in daily print what many of us have been
aware of for years! Put more baldly: ''What's new''!
Steps must be taken to set an example and give guidance from the top
and that can be in no other place than the Secretary of State for
Scotland. The buck does stop there and if you need any greater proof of
this, consider the Republic of Ireland. There the influence of
Government, and its cash, filter into their national tourist board and
in turn, their enthusiasm and influence filter down to the providers on
the ground.
Of course, it is not to say that greater Government commitment to one
of Scotland's most important industries would instantly transpose Jill
Crawshaw's worst nightmares into more pleasant circumstances, but it
would make a huge difference.
For a start, there might well be much less muddle -- why should the
Scottish Tourist Board not also be responsible for overseeing
development (as they used to be)? Why on earth give this responsibility
to cash and publicity-happy Local Enterprise Companies anxious to
encourage heritage centres on their patches?
Significant Government commitment should help to ensure that local
authorities pay more than just lip service to tourism -- places like
Fort William and Inverness, famed for their tourism over countless
decades, certainly do not sport the amenities that might otherwise be
provided were the local councils to be given greater means to provide
for the visiting public. As Jill Crawshaw discovered, the Tourism
Capital of the Highlands has a splendid castle and what else?!
More practically the Government body charged with this total tourism
industry task, should be free to impose the most stringent of conditions
before establishments and other providers of services to the tourist
industry are allowed to participate in any matters carrying the name of
the Scottish Tourist Board. This would radically weed out the worst and
had it been in force, might have ensured that Jill Crawshaw faced fewer
traumas.
Of course, the argument will be put forward that the existing
classification and grading scheme does this and that development
proposals are vetted to ensure that standards and types of facilities
are adequate and not duplicated (build me another heritage centre
please!). The truth of the matter is that the present ''policing'' is
woefully inadequate.
Others will contend that the various training schemes provided by the
Local Enterprise Companies and encouraged by the Scottish Tourist Board
are all in place and quite adequate. Well, the truth is, they are not.
So where does this leave those of us trying to make a living from
tourists coming to Scotland and at the same time trying to give them
''value for money'' and an enjoyable experience. The answer is, like in
any other hard-nosed business operation of the 21st century -- looking
for leadership and support from the top: the very top.
The industry should be taken by the scruff of the neck and shaken:
violently.

IT was with some considerable concern and surprise that I read your
recent comments on the Scottish Tourist industry and in particular the
Scottish Tourist Board's information service.
As a seasoned traveller I have recently been making plans to travel to
Scotland and have been using the STB's services in Cockspur Street. I
have found the service offered both efficient and friendly. This is a
very busy office in the heart of London and the overriding impression
that I have taken away is that the staff really care about their work,
their clients and wish to make Scotland as welcoming as possible.
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff when I was making my
inquiries and this was often at the end of a busy day and the office was
about to close.
This is obviously a well managed office with happy, well trained staff
who know their jobs. If only this could be said for all tourist
information centres in London.

WHEN the Scottish Enterprise reforms were being debated in the late
1980s, one great strength of the initiative was the fresh opportunity it
created to bring economic development and skills training together under
one roof.
Nearly five years on from the launch of the network, eloquent lip
service is still paid regularly to the need to foster human skills as an
integral part of the wider drive to ensure our economy grows and
prospers.
Pick up any local enterprise company annual report. ''XXXX's people
are the lifeblood of its economy. Without their skills, our businesses
cannot function,'' waxes one. ''The competitiveness of YYYY and its
businesses depends on the skills and ingenuity of its people,'' coos
another.
Identities aren't necessary. My point is a general one. It is that,
despite laudable efforts to improve the quality and effectiveness of the
various government schemes designed to get young people into their first
jobs and unemployed adults back to work, the arrival of Scottish
Enterprise has so far singularly failed to narrow the skills gap between
Scotland and many of our main competitors.
Despite 196,100 Scots still out of work and claiming benefit, business
survey after business survey still reports employers experiencing skill
shortages and recruitment difficulties. No-one, least of all the
enterprise network, has the power and resources necessary to champion a
comprehensive skills training strategy for this country which will begin
to bridge that gap. There is plenty of talk, loads of analysis, but far
too little action.
Labour's Shadow Chancellor, Gordon Brown, got big coverage this week
for a league table borrowed from the OECD showing Britain had slipped
from 13th to 18th place in the world prosperity (per capita GDP) league
in the past 16 years. He could have used another OECD league table which
shows us down to a lowly 20th place in overall skill attainment.
Last year CBI Scotland -- which was well ahead of Mr Brown in
publicising the fact that football isn't the only area of human
endeavour where we lag behind much of the rest of Europe -- devoted a
large section of its Manufacturing Matters report to itemising the scale
of the skills problem.
Over 60% of British employees have no vocational qualifications of any
kind. Over 70% of employers with less than 50 employees report ''no
plans'' to use formal vocational qualifications. Half didn't even know
such things as SVQs existed.
Scottish Enterprise appears to share the CBI's concern. In its latest
annual report, published in July, it claimed ''Scottish businesses have
been slower than some of their foreign competitors to make the link
between skills and performance and to commit to investment in training
and development.''
Recently I attended a working dinner at which executives and board
members from one particular LEC were in healthy discussion with
representatives of firms from a key sector of the local economy. After
the food, one industrialist stood up and asked if a recent skills audit
carried out by the LEC had identified how many apprentices were
currently training in the area. ''Afraid not,'' came the rather sheepish
reply. ''And can you tell us how much money you are putting into
apprenticeship training?'' he persisted. Again, there was an uneasy
shrugging of shoulders.
The questioner was convinced that, without a substantial national
investment in craft apprentice training, industry after industry would
be facing a skills crisis within 10 years. But the sub-text to his
inquisition wasn't too difficult to read either.
Wearing its inward investment hat, Scottish Enterprise can and does
assemble very significant cash inducements for incoming firms to recruit
and train local staff. But there is no equivalent carrot for indigenous
employers wishing to train existing staff in new skills. Regional
selective assistance is explicitly tied to projects which create
additional jobs.
The Government made it clear, from the outset of the Scottish
Enterprise reforms, that skills training is primarily the responsibility
of employers themselves. But, for many employers, particularly the
smaller ones, the Catch-22 is that training your people all too often
ends up with the sight of them walking out the door, poached by a rival
prepared to pay a few quid more a week to lure their skills away.
Robert Reich, President Clinton's Labor Secretary, once wrote: ''In
the future there will be no national products or technologies, no
national corporations, no national industries . . . All that will remain
rooted within national borders are the people who comprise a nation.
Each nation's primary assets will be its citizens' skills and
insights.'' But, as every employer knows, investment in your people's
skills is the one investment you can't screw to the factory or office
floor.
Up till now the enterprise network has devoted most of its training
effort to delivering Youth Training (now Skillseekers) to those leaving
school, and Training for Work to the adult long-term unemployed.
Together these programmes accounted for more than one-third (#169m) of
Scottish Enterprise's total expenditure (#467m) last year.
The original political motivation for such schemes was to take
thousands of people off the dole. Slowly but surely the pendulum has
swung towards using such schemes to train the unemployed in skills which
will actually lead to jobs. Skillseekers has explicitly tried to give
trainees greater choice in who trains them and what skills they seek.
Welding the Government's Modern Apprenticeships initiative into
Skillseekers is a bid to ensure that more of that training leads to
higher level SVQs.
So all the emphasis to date has been on reskilling the unemployed. To
do that effectively requires a detailed knowledge of the skills industry
and business feel are in short supply. That, as I understand it, is the
primary motivation for Scottish Enterprise's latest innovation, the
Skills Forum. Though why it took so long to set it up remains a mystery
to me.
But if it is now acceptable to invest significant sums of public money
in trying to give the unemployed the kind of skills industry needs, why
is it not politically acceptable to invest more, as a nation, in the
skills of those already in work?
The answer, sadly, is because government has been seeking to spend
less and less on the problem in recent years. In part these reductions
have been down to demographics. But it is also a deliberate act of
policy. And, when Mr Clarke stands up later this month to deliver his
Budget, few will be surprised if the training budget emerges yet again
as a significant loser. That skills gap could be with us for a long time
yet.

NO APOLOGIES for joining in the feeding frenzy at Ravelston Terrace.
My recently formed policy with the Scottish Tourist Board is to have as
little to do with them as possible; not only can they tell me nothing
about Scotland which I can't find out for myself, more speedily and with
less frustration, but my working relationship with their press office
has been dismal.
Three times in the past few years I've told them I write travel
features on Scotland for the UK, European, and American press. Three
times I've suggested helpfully that it might be an idea to put me on
their mailing list. They still don't know where I live. They wouldn't
last five minutes in PR's private sector, whose sharp professionals
punch you into their databases before you can say the word ''contact''.
Please don't bother now, guys, if you're reading this on your leafy
Edinburgh hilltop. (What makes me think they ever read any newspaper?)
The last straw was the briefing invitation which never arrived because
there were two mistakes in the address, and which I learned about by
phone when it was too late to accept. At least they seem to have my
phone number now.
For all that, or perhaps because of all that, I fantasise occasionally
about offering myself as a consultant to the STB. My approach to the
marketing of Scotland would be very different from that which has
produced the expensive and derivative images of their current ''Autumn
Gold'' campaign. Like British Rail's timetables, Autumn Gold may come a
cropper on fallen leaves. No matter how glorious the foliage, what's the
point of inviting people to Scotland when the season has put up its
shutters? If the weather is bad the birks o' Aberfeldy will not perform;
they will merely drip water down the necks of visitors.
The very concept is a striking example of what the STB do best, which
is dream up costly marketing ideas which can't deliver what they
promise. No-one treasures Scotland off-season more than I do, no-one
believes more firmly that it should be enjoyed all year round, but not
without preparing people for its realities. As Jill Crawshaw discovered,
even September can be hard going in the Highlands; and as the natives
already know, rural Scotland is the leisure industry's version of
Russian roulette in any month.
My marketing strategy would make a virtue of the stiff challenge of
holidaying in Scotland. I wouldn't seek to disguise the imperfections of
its climate or its skeletal wet-weather infrastructure, but actively
promote these as opportunities for self-discovery. I've even got a
slogan for the advertising campaign: Are You Up to Scotland?
Its thrust would emphasise the rewards for adventurers. The message
for potential tourists would be: do not ask what you can do in Scotland,
ask what Scotland can do for you. This is a country for people whose
inner resources are rich; who are willing and able to get out of their
cars and coaches and square up to it; who will always turn their backs
on the junk culture of fast-food history and stride into the elemental
murk to discover Scotland for themselves and themselves in Scotland.
I would appeal to their traveller's vanity. Sunset over the Summer
Isles? A commonplace beauty. You can see that kind of thing in the
Aegean, but you ain't seen nothing until you've seen Ardnamurchan Point
in the fog, or the barometric glaur closing down Loch Maree, or
Kinlochleven in a fine drizzle. Why are there no photographs along these
lines in STB literature? It took an Englishman, Colin Baxter, to notice
that Scotland has weather and turn it into a postcard industry.
As for Scotland's tourist services . . . I would make another virtue
of their mediocrity. You want efficiency? Stay in Switzerland. You want
grovel? Go to Greece. Only Scotland offers direct confrontation with the
mutually exploitative relationship between host country and guests. Only
Scotland, whose forbearing Gaels remain the most courteous members of a
curmudgeonly nation, offers an authentic experience of the repressed
resentments of the tourist industry.
Only Scotland does no such thing, of course. There are rude and
lacklustre performers in tourism throughout the world, but it's also
true that some nations serve their tourists more comfortably than
others, for reasons which, I guess, include cultural and temperamental
factors underpinned by experience and motivation.
The Swiss are exemplary, the Americans do well, and in countries like
France and Italy, which have honed the traditions of a domestic cafe and
restaurant culture, the visitor tends to benefit. But this doesn't mean
their other services are above reproach. Tourist information in Italy is
poor, and the only thing to do on a wet day in the Dolomites is abandon
yourself to comfort eating and oblivion drinking.
It's tempting to make connections between the psychological health of
nations and their service manners. Bouncy Bostonian waitresses treat new
customers like long-lost family; Bihari chambermaids in Taj hotels never
look guests in the eye; Balinese gardeners lift their heads from their
work and -- with that transcendental Balinese grace which even package
tourism has failed to diminish -- make the morning sweeter with the ease
and warmth of their greetings.
In hierarchical India, where colonial imperatives compounded the
inequities of caste, the visitor is made uneasy by obsequiousness or
humility. In spiritual Bali, which put up prolonged resistance to Dutch
imperialism and where there is no untouchable caste in the Balinese form
of Hinduism, the visitor is received with confident courtesy. But this
equation breaks down elsewhere.
Here, for example. In its self-analysis Scotland sees itself as a
proud but politically impotent nation whose damaged self-esteem makes it
grudge its role in the world's leading service industry. But where does
that leave England, whose reputation for unenthusiastic manners and
indifferent service is every bit as poor?

SUNDAYS were bastards. Sorry, it just came out. Well they were. I
couldn't believe what Julie Davidson came out with last week about how
much she would have looked forward to a Sunday in Lewis with all that
peace and quiet. Twenty years back Julie didn't like peace and quiet at
all. Two decades ago Julie was, like me, miffed something rotten because
an Edinburgh Sunday -- both of us then lived in Auld Reekie -- spelt a
rainy Sunday, and it always rained in Edinburgh on a Sunday. Raining in
your heart, because an Edinburgh Sunday was a busy day for the
Samaritans, which, incidentally, was founded in Edinburgh. Doubtless on
a Sunday.
A Sunday in Lewis? They chain the bloody children's swings up in Lewis
on a Sunday, and a walk on that other side of the moon is only
countenanced by the lieges if you do it in your bare feet over horribly
sharp stones and only because you are trying to get to your dying
mother's house. Anything else would be an amusement. In Harris they get
round that burst of entertainment. One, they don't have children's
swings. Two, they chain up the children instead. Tell me about Sunday
Bloody Sunday.
And did I not read the other day, one of our other columnists writing
of her sunburst of a Sunday when she wrote of the television production
of Pride and Prejudice. Fair made her Sunday it did. Fair maids were not
there. A collection of fat lassies in Empire dresses speaking RADA, and
boys with insouciant upper lips with impudent curled hair and no more
idea of the nineteenth century than all these damned female novelists of
the time had. (I count out Mary Evans, but certainly the horribly virgin
Brontes and the clearly lesbian fantasist, the awful Austen, should have
been damned early and continue to be so.) If there ever was a more
tedious life than that described by Ms Austen it can only have been that
of Diogenes had he been in residence in Cumbernauld at the time. All
that swanning about dreary country lanes mooning after Mr Darcy. Back in
those days, every day was Sunday. Heaven's, I remember Sundays well.
So should Julie, a vibrant girl with Titian hair once. Perhaps the
hair is not so Titian these days? One thing I can guarantee my columnar
colleague. She has a wee girl of 12. Julie: ask Katherine how enervating
she would find a Sunday in Lewis and she will tell you, and indeed in
enervating terms. Ask how many people prefer to work on a Sunday -- and
I am one of those who do -- how much they prefer the hurly-burly of work
on the Sabbath to the funereal near-obsequies of a day of rest and they
will repeat what your wee girl has said.
In fact, ask anybody who needs Sunday to do their shopping or to earn
a living and believe me they will not come out with splendid sentiments
on how wonderful Sundays are with the old peace and quiet. None of the
foregoing is a self-employed journalist with a nice house in Edinburgh.
I never thought, after all these years of knowing you, Julie, that I'd
get the better of you in an argument: I suspect I have now.
But there are a lot of people who fondly remember Sundays through the
haze of time. Think again. I came from a background which had no quiet
buzz of bees over the roses and daisied lawns, Austin Cambridges being
soaped and waxed by small boys, little girls in ringlets back from
church choir practice, and the scent of baked scones and Daddy in a
cardigan. I rather doubt Julie did either because she hails from
somewhere perfectly vile in industrial Lanarkshire. What Julie, and a
lot of other people, want for the Sabbath is a peace that doesn't exist
for most of us.
What I want, and citizens like me want, for the Sabbath is the Barras
and punters and pubs open and horse-racing and children swinging in
swing parks and teenagers winching and anything but quiet. I want Coney
Island with the chance of your nookie: youse can have a Sabbatarianism
worthy of a Wee Free professor and I shall not baulk at it. But I never
forced the Wee Frees, or Julie either, if it comes to that, into the
raucous and spellbinding atmosphere of a Sunday jaunt. Just don't stop
me.
A few weeks back we had the nonsense of a Western Isles meenister
telling us all that the Sabbath should not be adusted in any way. He
hardly considered that other religions have other days for the Sabbath,
and indeed my own religion requires, on that day, copious amounts of
whisky at the altar of a bar-counter and the hymns we sing are culled
from cheery ones originally sung by Elvis and Hank, with a bit of Percy
French thrown in. He certainly didn't consider that The Herald he reads
on the Monday was written, a wee bit by me, on his precious Sunday. I
won't even make him read me. I don't want him to.

FIFE Flyers last night received a massive boost on the eve of
Saturday's Benson and Hedges Cup semi-final, second-leg with favourites
Sheffield Steelers.
Defenceman Doug Marsden has been reclassified as a dual national,
which means that Flyers can bring in another import to bolster the squad
which defends a two-goal lead at Sheffield Arena.
Premier division Flyers are talking to Finnish defenceman Marku Makki,
currently with first division side Blackburn Hawks.
If the paperwork goes through on time, Makki could be drafted in on
loan while Flyers' player-coach Mark Morrison searches for a permanent
replacement, which could take up to five weeks.
And Flyers chiefs admitted last night that they have been talking to
Sheffield for the last three days about signing Kirkcaldy-born forward
Les Millie.
A Flyers' spokesman said: ''We won't get him before Saturday's game
but we're hopeful that everything will be concluded by the start of next
week.
''Millie signed a three-year contract with Steelers in the summer so
there is a problem over possible compensation.''
Meanwhile, around 250 Fife fans will make the trip to the 9000-seat
Sheffield Arena on Saturday for the second-leg into which Flyers carry a
5-3 lead from last Saturday's first leg at Kirkcaldy.

A BUSINESS services company, the Capita group, is to administer the
pilot schemes for pre-school education vouchers, the Government
announced yesterday.
The firm, which already provides billing and revenue services for
local authorities, will be responsible for issuing and redeeming the
#1100 vouchers which parents will use to ''buy'' pre-schooling for their
four-year-olds.
The one-year pilot will begin in England in April, four months ahead
of its Scottish counterpart.
The Government wants to create a marketplace, with the public,
private, and voluntary sectors competing for the vouchers, but the
initiative has been widely criticised on both sides of the Border.
In England and Wales, only four local authorities, three of them
Tory-controlled, have come forward for the pilot phase.
Application forms will be sent out by the Benefits Agency to the
parents of about 15,600 four-year-olds in the pilot councils.
The English pilot has the potential to create 4500 new places, less
than a third of the total the Government had hoped would be available in
the first phase, which will cost #22m.
Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson, who has already
announced that the pilot north of the Border will begin in August,
criticised councils which have boycotted the initiative, but has said
that the eight which have expressed an interest are more than enough to
operate the phase.
These are: Argyll and Bute, Clackmannan, East Renfrewshire, North
Ayrshire, Borders, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, and Western Isles.
But Mrs Helen Liddell, who speaks for Labour on Scottish Education,
said their good will had been ''cynically abused'' by Scottish Office
Ministers, who had not consulted them about who should run the scheme.
Capita Managed Services already has offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
There will be a voucher helpline in Edinburgh.
A full voucher scheme will cost about #70m a year in Scotland, but no
value has been put on administrative costs.

A DOCTOR has admitted stealing several hundred injections of
controlled drugs while he was working in a Dalbeattie practice.
Colin Malone had his case continued for three weeks for reports, at
Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court.
Dr Malone stole 380 injections of the drugs, which included
diamorphine and Cyclimorph, over a four-month period while working in
the Dalbeattie practice.
Dr Malone, 32, of Rounall Avenue, Dalbeattie, pled guilty to having
pretended to four pharmacists that he required quantities of the
controlled drugs diamorphine, Cyclimorph and pethidine for use in
connection with the treatment of patients in the course of his business
in a doctor's practice at Millisle Clinic, Dalbeattie.
He induced the pharmacists at Blackwood's Pharmacy, High Street,
Dalbeattie -- Alan Blackwood, Judith Alcorn, Susan Hutton and John
Wilson -- to supply him with the controlled drugs and thereafter
appropriated them to his own use and stole them.
The offence took place between January 1 and April 29 this year when
Dr Malone was supplied with 130 injections of diamorphine, ranging from
from 5mg to 30mg on 23 occasions between January 4 and April 29; 130
injections of Cyclimorph on 26 occasions between the same dates and of
receiving 120 injections of pethidine on 11 occasions ranging between 50
and 100mg.
Sheriff James Smith deferred sentence until November 23 and called for
social inquiry, community service and phsychiatric reports.

Case of Scottish hospital trio highlights dilemma over publishing
clinical reports.
THREE psychiatrists found guilty of identifying a patient left a
General Medical Council hearing yesterday free to carry on their
careers.
The council's professional conduct committee decided that the actions
of Doctors John Eagles, Jon Parkin and Alastair Palin did not justify a
finding of serious professional misconduct.
However, the three-day hearing has been a warning as to how far
doctors can go in publishing clinical reports -- which may be of wide
public interest -- in terms which describe individual patients on whom
they are based.
Dr Eagles, of Binghill Park, Milltimber, Aberdeen, and Dr Parkin,
whose address was given as the Royal Cornhill Hospital, Aberdeen, had
been accused of disclosing information in a paper in the British Journal
of Psychiatry about the condition of a patient, identified to the
hearing as Ms C, in such a way as to enable her to be identified.
Dr Palin, now of Islington, London, who had been Ms C's psychiatrist
in the Royal Cornhill, was accused of providing information for the
paper without obtaining Ms C's informed consent and in such a way as to
enable her to be identified. Dr Eagles was found guilty, and Dr Parkin
cleared, of failing to obtain Ms C's consent before publication.
Mr Adrian Whitfield, QC, representing Dr Eagles and Dr Parkin, had
told the hearing that doctors doing research, especially in the field of
psychiatry, faced inevitable dilemmas about how much detail of
individual cases to give.
But the need for patient confidentiality to remain paramount was
reinforced after the case by the British Medical Association, which
said: ''It is unfortunate that in this case patients have been
identified even though no names were used. Doctors in future will have
to be extra vigilant in writing clinical papers.''
Grampian Healthcare Trust, which operates the Royal Cornhill Hospital,
made it clear that the matter was now closed. Medical director Dr
Richard Scorgie said: ''Both Dr Eagles and Dr Palin have worked for many
years at Royal Cornhill, where they have established an excellent
professional reputation as fine psychiatrists. They continue to enjoy
our full support and confidence.''
The three psychiatrists said later, in a statement from their
solicitor: ''We are naturally relieved that the GMC has found on the
evidence none of us were guilty of misconduct, and our duty of
confidentiality remains. All we wish to say is that we regret any
distress which has been caused to the complainant in this case.''
Fortunately for the imparting of medical knowledge and the career
paths of doctors, it is a problem not likely to crop up frequently.
Hundreds of case reports are published every week in medical journals.
But this one was different. Three women, either doctors or medical
students, used their training to drain off quantities of their own blood
in a bizarre manifestation of bulimia, the eating disorder now
associated publicly with the Princess of Wales.
In seeking to alert their professional colleagues to this hazard, Drs
Eagles, Parkin and Palin might have thought they were on safe ground
with the British Journal of Psychiatry, a specialist publication and
official organ of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, but an account of
their report appeared in The Herald, and this was followed up by the
Aberdeen Press and Journal, thereby working its way back to reach the
wider public in the relatively limited community in which the affair
occurred.
Patient C, who had a complex and unusual clinical history, was shown
the Press and Journal report by a colleague who had recognised her.
Earlier this year, the Royal College of Psychiatrists revised its
policy for acceptance of reports to the journal. Patients will have to
give consent and be shown the article before publication; personal
details kept to minimum, changed if necessary to conceal identification,
with a note to this effect appended to the article.
Even if this policy had been in force at the time, however, there
would have been difficulties in producing a mutually acceptable report
on the Cornhill trio.
If Ms C and her fellow patients had consented to the paper at all, one
can assume they would have wanted some doctoring of the details to
ensure confidentiality. Their gender, condition, age and profession were
all relevant to the case -- the obvious answer would have been to write
that they came from elsewhere.
The problem is that doctors submit research reports, not just to
disseminate information, but to add the publications and citations they
can list on their CV, so they like to have their name and address at the
end of the report. That in itself is bound to be a giveaway.

UNTIL last night there was hope. Now there is virtually nothing to
prevent another cold and dark winter settling over British football.
Of the 10 clubs who stepped into the European arena this season only
Nottingham Forest's ambitions linger in the UEFA Cup. Rangers and
Blackburn Rovers have commitments to fulfill in the Champions' League,
but their business is all but done, Celtic and Everton have been
jettisoned from the European Cup-winners' Cup, and Motherwell, Raith
Rovers, Manchester United, Liverpool, and Leeds United are out of the
UEFA Cup.
This mass failure is all the more unpalatable given that seven --
Celtic, Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Rangers, Leeds, and
Everton -- of the clubs involved have known success in the three
European competitions. There was a time when British sides were feared,
but these days they are dismissed all too easily by opponents who have
progressed dramatically.
After last night's match at Celtic Park the coach of Paris St Germain,
Luis Fernandez, tried to explain why British clubs tend to struggle
against foreign opposition, but he could not quite put his finger on any
one thing.
The truth is, however, that our teams have forgotten how to play
possession football. They have forgotten also how to manoeuvre
themselves at varying speeds, and they have stopped thinking about the
game.
Of course, there will be excuses for another miserable and
embarrassing week, but let the aggregate results speak for themselves --
Rangers beaten 4-1 and 4-0 by Juventus, Leeds 8-3 losers to PSV
Eindhoven, Celtic 4-0 and out to PSG.
Rangers chairman David Murray asks that his team be judged at the end
of the season, when they will probably be awarded with their eighth
successive premier division championship. Undoubtedly, that would be a
remarkable achievement and powerful testimony to the Ibrox club's
dominance in Scottish football.
The champions and their supporters would rejoice and close in on
Celtic's nine championships in a row, a record which Rangers hope to
beat, and as things stand at the moment, the chances are they will reach
that goal also.
However, no matter how much time and effort is put into these domestic
rivalries, out there in the great beyond they mean little. A Scottish
title, or an English one for that matter, is no longer strong currency
abroad.
Passing the ball should be easy for anyone who calls himself a
professional footballer, yet the trouble British teams experience with
this part of the game is astounding.
Teams like Rangers and Celtic have to decide what exactly it is they
want. If they are content with a Scottish title which guarantees them
the opportunity to try to qualify for the Champions' League that is
fine, but they should say so and make it clear they are interested only
in the riches available through qualification.
However, if they believe they should be more than bit-part players at
the top level then they have to admit they are way behind schedule. They
must rethink their strategy, because the current one is not working,
even though Rangers' Murray insisted yesterday: ''There will be no
change in our policies.''
He added that more money would be made available, even though the
manager, Walter Smith, has been given #33m in his four and a half year
reign. If so, Smith will have to spend it on players capable of
producing ther best on foreign fields as well as domestic pitches.
Smith, who again will come under pressure following another
particularly inept performance by his players, has to demand more. There
are too many designer footballers at Ibrox, people who have no idea
about what is the required return for the pay packets and the privilege
of wearing the club's gear.
Attitudes will have to change, ambitions and beliefs widened, and even
more money will have to be spent on those parts of the business which
rarely are in the public eye. and there must be an investment in
training facilites and youth development must be refined to ensure
rather than hope young players emerge. Manchester United appear to be
winning in this respect and they are a club with whom Rangers and the
others would like to identify.
Of course, the Ibrox club have had serious injury problems, and the
stupidity of those players suspended has not helped the cause either.
Indeed, Smith has had to use 25 players in 20 games so far, which is
hardly ideal preparation for an assault on Europe.
However, while some of those journeymen pressed into action have been
found wanting there have been too many others who failed to produce on
the big occasions when their best was required. The other night Rangers
again conceded four goals to Juventus, and where were Gordan Petric,
Paul Gascoigne, and Oleg Salenko? Also, on the odd occasion Brian
Laudrup has played in Europe for Rangers he, too, has shown little of
the skill which Smith thought he was buying.
Stuart McCall did not look fit in midweek, and neither did Charlie
Miller, although this particular youngster was given an opportunity to
see Italy's emerging star, Alessandro Del Piero. If Miller's talents
mature into something close to the level of the Juventus player, who
will become even better, then Rangers will have themselves a prized
possession.
Miller and Del Peiro, in fact, illustrate the difference between us
and them in that the former is a player over whose skills we sometimes
drool while the latter looks to us -- but not his own people, it must be
stressed -- like the finished article.
Rangers are entitled to protest they were hampered severely by
injuries but they cannot hide from the fact they are short of technique
and guile. As we have witnessed this week, however, they are not alone
in these failings.
On the opposite side of this page SFA chief executve Jim Farry offers
an insight into the work being done to improve the game but the clubs
should be doing more because they are all responsible for the decline.
Also, it is time we heard from Ernie Walker's think tank. What have
they come up with so far and how do they suggest we go about lifting
ourselves of the floor?
Their ideas had better be good because this game of ours needs help
sooner rather than later and the more Walker's people consider the wider
will become the gap between us and the Continentals. Give us a sign.
Give us some hope.

top level then they have to admit they are way behind schedule'

MEN'S HOCKEY
THE Scottish Hockey Union, which has been dragging its feet in recent
years over the need for restructuring of the men's national league, has
finally grasped the nettle. However, it could now be on a collision
course with the clubs.
The committee thrashed out a new formula for a league of the first
division of eight clubs, second division of 10, topping a base of three
divisions of equal strength and stature incorporating club's development
sides on Wednesday night in Perth.
The board of the SHU will be in receipt of the document within the
next few days and if it gets the seal of approval then the clubs could
be voting on it before Christmas.
There has, however, been such an apathy by clubs for restructuring,
particularly in the west, its approval is not a foregone conclusion. At
the west's discussion meeting on restructuring, only six clubs from
Scotland's biggest district made an appearance.
.
Restructuring will be far from the thoughts of the front-runners,
Grange and Western, in this weekend's league programme.
They clash at Fettes tomorrow and, with the halfway stage in the
championship now in sight, the result could have a significant bearing
on the destination of the title.
Grange go into the confrontation with a two-point advantage over
Western.

PAUL Cole can make another winning visit to Doncaster today to take
the five-furlong Normandy Beaches Nursery Handicap with Amber Fort,
writes White and Gold.
The Whatcombe trainer has many happy memories of previous trips to the
South Yorkshire track, none more so than when he landed his first
British Classic victory with Snurge in the St Leger in 1990.
Amber Fort failed to make the frame in three outings in useful maiden
company over seven furlongs and a mile in the summer. But he showed
promise each time and he confirmed he has plenty of ability when dropped
to six furlongs last time, running a fine second to King of Peru in a
competitive Newmarket nursery.
The colt looked a likely winner at the furlong-pole that day only to
be run out of it late on and will almost certainly be seen to better
advantage at the minimum trip.
Amber Fort remains well enough treated at the weights to gain the
first success of his career.
Chief Bee is difficult to get away from in the Royal British Legion
Conditions Stakes.

TWO Formula One
drivers who feared they had provided positive dope tests after having
taken cold medicines have been given the all-clear.
Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, of Jordan Peugeot, and Italian Max
Papis, who drives for Footwork Hart, were tested at the European Grand
Prix in Germany at the end of September.
Barrichello revealed at the time he had taken an over-the-counter
medicine called Afrin, containing the banned substance, ephedrine, while
Papis said he used a flu medication called Triaminic which contained
pheniphedrine.
The two men informed the testers they had taken medication containing
proscribed substances. The samples were sent to the International
Olympic Committee laboratory in Cologne for analysis.
Motorsport's governing body FIA stated that samples from the six
drivers tested at the Nurburgring -- the others were David Coulthard,
Damon Hill, Michael Schumacher, and Olivier Panis -- were all negative.
''The medicines which some of the above drivers had taken to treat
colds did not affect the results,'' said FIA in a statement.

EAMONN Loughran's postponed World Boxing Organisation welterweight
title defence against Mexico's Jorge Luis Lopez is now unlikley to take
place until the new year.
The Irishman yesterday pulled out of the November 25 bout after having
revealed that he has been suffering from flu and a damaged right hand
since making his last defence early last month.
The showdown was then provisionally re-arranged for December 16, but
Loughran's manager, Barry Hearn, has indicated that the pressure of
meeting television schedules has made that option impractical.
''There is no place in ITV's schedule on December 16 -- or any other
date before Christmas,'' said Hearn, ''and at the moment it looks like
the fight won't happen until February.''
Lopez is the Mexican champion and boasts a record of 33 wins and three
defeats.
On announcing his decision to pull out of the November date, Loughran
admitted: ''I wasn't going to be 100% mentally and physically fit for
Lopez, who is going to be a tough challenger because he's the No 1.''

Only the formalities have to be completed at the general assembly of
the Games Federation in Bermuda.
For Manchester is the sole candidate after Adelaide and Johannesburg
dropped out of the running last year.

THE biggest prize fund in the history of the event will be on offer
tomorrow in Shettleston's Allan Scally relay at Baillieston (2.0pm).
The club has #600 in the war chest for the 4 x 4.85-mile race, plus a
#50 bonus if the leading individual time is faster than 22 minutes,
benchmark of class in what is a premier meeting on the winter calendar.
Its role as many clubs' final trial for the Barr's Edinburgh-Glasgow
relay a fortnight on Sunday invariably adds further significance -- not
a matter of life and death, perhaps, but it was not always so.
The fixture is named in memory of Shettleston's former coach, who
never appeared in the club's blue-and-gold colours because he had raced
as a professional. But the former Powderhall 10-mile champion,
nevertheless, was feted in his local area because he contributed from
his winnings to fund soup kitchens during the depression.
More enlightened views prevail now. Each member of the winning team
this weekend collects #40, with #40 for the fastest individual, plus the
aforementioned #50 for anyone inside 22min. -- ironically sums far in
excess of those with which Allan Scally was branded a professional end
excommunicated beyond the pale.
It is a commentary on the declining standards of endurance racing in
Scotland that, though 22 minutes has been broken 17 times in the race's
27-year history -- the route remains unchanged -- this has happened only
once in the '90s (Englishman John Sherban) and seven times in the '70s.
Seven of these efforts were by Shettleston's Nat Muir, whose record of
21-26 dates to 1985. Sadly, though he has faded from the scene, his
nearest two challengers will be in action tomorrow, for Edinburgh's
Leslie Deans Racing Club.
Allister Hutton, the former London marathon winner, recorded 21-38,
and 1978 Comonwealth 1500m medalist John Robson 21-48. But neither,
despite their durability, enjoys an absolute guarantee of a team place
these days.
The hosts last year ended Racing's three-year monopoly of the trophy,
as well as taking the women's crown, but Racing demonstrated last week
by their national cross-country relay success that little wil stand
before them this winter.
* A NEW development policy by the cross-country commission of the
Scottish Athletic Federation will see a team of four men and four women
fly to an international 10,000 metres cross-country race next weekend at
Margate.
This will be the Scots' only chance of staking a claim to Britain's
team for the European cross-country championships at Alnwick Castle.
Spango Valley's Tom Murray and Chris Robison, who made a significant
impact on the UK all-terrain marathon last year, head the men's squad,
along with Ian Brown (Leslie Deans Racing Club) and Robert Quinn
(Kilbarchan).
Pitreavie's Trudi Thomson, who last weekend won the Dublin Marathon in
her fastest time (2-38), is in a strong women's team which includes
Commonwealth team captain Vikki McPherson, Sue Ridley, and Hailey
Haining.

SOCCER star Paul Gascoigne's fiancee of just five weeks has dumped him
after he chatted to a blonde model in a restaurant.
Ms Sheryl Kyle, who is expecting Gascoigne's baby, was claimed to be
''adamant'' her turbulent relationship with the #4.5m Rangers midfield
player was over for good.
But Gascoigne was reported as saying he and 25-year-old model Sarah
Heaney were just friends.
The incident came after the 28-year-old England international chatted
to Ms Heaney at Sir Terence Conran's Quaglino's restaurant, where he and
Ms Kyle, 31, were dining.
A report in the Sun newspaper said the mother-of-two had accused
Gascoigne of having an affair and then stormed out.
A friend told the newspaper: ''She's adamant she won't take Paul
back.''
But the Newcastle-born football star was claimed to have said: ''I'd
only ever seen this girl before for two minutes in my life.
''Sheryl means more to me than anything in the world and I just pray
we are going to be able to work this out.''
The relationship between Gascoigne and Ms Kyle has been dogged by
splits and public rows.

SURPRISING Scotland is the sole purveyor of Scottish tourism in the
important Middle East market. (The official representation is by the
British Tourist Authority who, on our last visit, did not even have
Scottish Tourist Board literature.)
The response of our Arab clients has been terrific, and we claim
credit for the way in which the Scottish product has been sold to them.
The demands of this clientele are not so different from Jill Crawshaw's
reasonable expectations of quality and value in food and accommodation,
but nobody sold her the product most suitable to her requirements.
It is not the fault of the hotelier who has sold services cheaply to
the ''Wally Arnold'' buyer. This is the marketing strategy by which that
establishment feels survival can best be achieved.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that the unwary individual traveller
should arrive both alone and outwith the programmed check-in time for
the usual coachloads of punters. The response of the staff/owners, as
detailed frequently in Jill Crawshaw's account, was a sad reflection on
what packaged tourism has imposed on the ''adventurer''.
We sell Scotland on the basis that it has all the scenic splendour
with which Jill Crawshaw (thank goodness for small mercies), fell in
love, that our inspected and selected range of hotels, chalets, and
other accommodation offer good value to a family-oriented clientele.
The Scottish Tourist Board has a problem. We are conditioned into
thinking that the plethora of such umbrella organisations are
necessarily good for the constituencies they exist to serve.
Surprising Scotland exists in a ''sub-tertiary'' area of the board's
marketing strategy, yet we promote Scotland, effectively and alone, in
an area which provides the universally acknowledged highest spending
tourists.
Jill Crawshaw highlights the problem by her failure to find anyone to
sell Scotland in areas served by the board. We have to sell Scotland in
the areas the board will not touch.
We will be pleased to give Jill Crawshaw some telephone numbers of
travel agencies who will happily sit down with her over copious
quantities of coffee, for as long as it takes to come up with a high
quality and good value visit to Scotland. Unfortunately they are in
Kuwait, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, etc.

<HEADLINE>Growers urged to join quality initiative. Plan to protect malt barley sales</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DAN BUGLASS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975569115</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND in 1995 produced close on two million tonnes of the best
malting barley in the world with farmers being rewarded with record
prices averaging almost #150 per tonne.
However, to safeguard that increasingly valuable market, growers are
being urged to join the Scottish Quality Cereals Locate initiative. The
trade is demanding that the grain they produce is grown, stored and
handled according to specified conditions.
Speaking yesterday in Arbroath at the first of a series of meetings
aimed at persuading more farmers to join the scheme the SQC manager
Peter Brown said: ''We launched this concept last July and so far we
have around 180 members which is slightly above our target but still
less than 10% of Scottish cereal growers. We hope to sign up another 200
at least before next July.''
Quality assurance is not new to the Scottish farming world with 80% of
the country's finished pigs coming from approved herds along with 25% of
the beef and 20% of the lamb.
However, while the livestock sector is rapidly being forced down that
avenue in response to conditions imposed by the major supermarkets, Mr
Brown explained that with cereals the situation was slightly different.
He said: ''SQC is trade driven with the maltsters and distillers being
concerned at future consumer trends. Some of the malt from this year's
harvest will not be consumed as whisky for perhaps 10 years but by then
the world will want to know how it was produced. There is a little
breathing space yet with the trade having seen the need before the end
user.''
So far the awards for the farmer who joined SQC have amounted to no
more than #1 per tonne on malting barley and milling oats and with the
cost of membership averaging #200 per farm the incentive has been
minimal.
However, discussions are proceeding with the trade, including millers
and compounders, with a view to securing funding from the sources to
reduce membership costs and to provide extra premia.
Lorne Watson, the purchasing manager for Moray Firth Maltings who are
Scotland's largest buyers of malting barley taking around 20% of the
crop has no doubts that sooner rather than later farmers should join
SQC.
He said: ''Quality assurance is paramount in our business. We are the
middlemen and we are being forced to meet tighter specifications all the
time.
''It's not just moisture screenings and nitrogen but now heavy metals
and pesticide residues which are being tested. We have to give
guarantees but the buck stops with the producer because there has to be
traceability throughout the entire chain.''
An indication of what might be involved for a farmer under the terms
of the Food Safety Act was highlighted by Mr Watson when he revealed
that a supermarket chain had been forced to remove a line of breakfast
cereals from its shelves.
Contaminating material was traced right back to one particular farm.
That farmer, who has no product liability insurance, now faces a claim
for damages of #700,000.
A leading Perth grain merchant who was accompanied by 10 of his farmer
customers at yesterday's meeting commented: ''I know that this year the
demand for malting barley has been so high that virtually no one has
been asking about quality assurance. But I think the scheme will work
well in a more normal year, especially if we can get a premium on wheat
sold for distilling.''
The final word went to Mr Watson who remarked ''I would like to think
that we as a company will within the next two years only be buying from
farmers who are members of SQC.''
* Entries for the Scottish National Winter Fair at Perth on November
22 are 74 up on last year, reaching a total of 1108. The biggest
increase is in the premier meat exhibition, sponsored by Marks &amp; Spencer
where cattle entries, at 212, are 63 up on last year.
Animals in that category are initially judged live but the final
decision is made on the hook, two days later at Scotbeef, Bridge of
Allan.
Much of the interest was due to the fact that entrants knew their
animals would secure a premium price,'' said Ian Galloway of Scotbeef.
The prices to be paid are set two weeks before the competition so that
producers can enter without the gamble of getting a poor price for their
stock.

DOES Jill Crawshaw want to turn Scotland into a Disney Park? She
bleated like a child that ''there was nothing to do'' in most places she
visited, ending by saying that her night at the pictures was the height
of her pleasure!
She also defeats her own arguments by telling us that most places were
fully booked at the end of September and that bus tourists abounded.
Does this not indicate that Scotland is a popular place to visit?
I am a regular visitor to Arisaig and Morar where, thank goodness,
there is nothing to do other than sit on the white beaches with a good
book and walk in the beautiful surrounding hills. She also complains
about not getting instant service but one has to ask if that is really
necessary. In the West Highlands nothing needs to happen instantly --
indeed the slower pace of life is very refreshing.
Let Jill Crawshaw holiday in London, New York, or Paris if she wishes
the pretentious service one gets there.

AS a regular visitor to the West Highlands, I read Jill Crawshaw's

IT is difficult to know where to begin with Jill Crawshaw's account of
her travels in Scotland, published this week. Hers is a litany of bad
accommodation, bad service, bad food, and bad manners. In short, a
disastrous performance.
Let me say quite clearly that it is no part of my job to defend the
indefensible. Scotland has a long way to go before it achieves the
standards of service and hospitality encountered in some parts of the
world. But surely some of the 170,000 people working in our industry are
doing something right?
To read The Herald's series it is difficult to imagine a more
depressing and unappealing holiday destination than Scotland. If this is
the case, why did the number of overseas visitors to Scotland increase
by 6% in 1994 (according to the British Tourist Authority's Annual
Report, published today); and the number of domestic trips to Scotland
increase by 9% in the first six months of 1995? And why are four out of
five visitors to Scotland on a repeat visit?
In 1995 considerable consumer research was conducted in the overseas
and domestic markets together with wide-ranging discussions within the
industry. This resulted in more focused marketing. And the early results
for 1995, plus our year-end projections, indicate that we can expect one
of the best tourism performances in recent years.
Scotland is a country that inspires residents and visitors alike. Our
heritage, our scenery, our environment, and our activities are truly
world class. Our industry's challenge is to match these assets with
world-class hospitality and service. But please, give us credit for
doing something and don't knock us for doing nothing.
In the past two years, the Scottish tourist industry has launched
major initiatives in the areas of training, marketing, investment, and
extending the season. It is axiomatic that these initiatives will
require time, investment and commitment to have the desired effect
throughout the country. But make no mistake, this industry has faced up
to its problems and is tackling them with honesty and integrity as
evidenced by events such as the Scottish Hospitality Industry Congress
earlier this week.
As to Jill Crawshaw's experience of the Scottish Tourist Board's
customer-assurance scheme and our own staff, she is clearly unimpressed.
Can I point out that the scheme has been devised to reassure customers
about the quality of accommodation they are booking and that our
research indicates it does just that? It is untrue to suggest that our
crowns and gradings do not contain any subjective, or quality,
assessment, because they do.
Indeed, it is this quality assessment that is at the heart of our
scheme and makes it the most popular of its type in the industry. And
can I point out that there are staff in the Scottish Tourist Board and
in Tourist Information Centres throughout Scotland who deal with
thousands of telephone calls and inquiries on a daily basis and whose
professionalism, diligence, and competence are an example to tourist
industries elsewhere. We are not complacent, but neither are we the
inefficient and unprofessional lot you imagine us to be.
Once more, I would point out that regular surveys we conduct on the
performance of TIC and STB staff to visitor inquiries indicate levels of
satisfaction at 90% and over, a very high score indeed for this type of
service.
The industry's performance in the past two years indicate that Jill
Crawshaw's experience is, thank goodness, the exception rather than the
rule. Finally, your newspaper should be supporting our aspiration to
become a world-class tourism destination instead of serving up knocking
copy without any constructive foundation.

SNP LEADER Alex Salmond yesterday renewed his attack on Labour and the
Conservatives over their comments on the Quebec referendum.
He criticised both Scottish Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst and Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson over remarks they made after the
people of Quebec narrowly rejected independence from Canada.
Sir Michael had referred to ''a further exodus of jobs and
investment'' from Quebec, and Mr Robertson had said: ''The key warning
of Quebec to the Scottish people is the economic damage done by the
uncertainty involved in trying to wrench apart a long-integrated
economy.''
Quebec's Agent-General in London, Mr Richard Guay, said he deeply
resented the issue of Quebec being used as a political football by
politicians in Scotland to justify their respective positions on the
constitution.
Mr Salmond has been in touch with the Quebec authorities and has
obtained information which, he claims, shows that it could stand alone.
He claims it has a higher GNP than Portugal, Denmark, Greece or
Norway, it accounts for 22.3% of Canada's total GDP, and in terms of per
capita income it ranks 13th among OECD countries -- ahead of the UK and
New Zealand.
The SNP leader says Quebec is a magnet for forward investment, and
that in 1994 manufacturing investment in Quebec was the highest in
Canada.
Mr Salmond's argument is that Labour and the Conservatives are
''scaremongering''about the impact independence would have on Scotland,
drawing on the strength of the Quebec economy to back up his claims.
He said: ''Michael Hirst and George Robertson are making idiots of
themselves and they appear to know even less about the Quebec economy
than they do about the Scottish economy.
''The Quebec economy has been vibrant and has not been subject to the
sort of damage Michael Hirst and George Robertson claim.
''If constitutional debate leads to uncertainty, the only way to end
that is independence.''

LIKE many of your readers, it was with a sense of sympathetic
embarrassment that I read Jill Crawshaw's ''Brave Heart Tour of
Scotland'' series. Sympathetic because I can relate to most of her
experiences, having suffered them myself at some point or other.
Embarrassment because her report and, I am sure, future references to
Scotland, will present a poor image of our tourist industry. There is
certainly no excuse for the treatment she received from some of her
''hosts''.
However, I suspect that her articles, and your editorial today, miss
the point entirely. The fundamental question must be ''Why do tourists
wish to visit Scotland?''. I think that the answer is more deep-rooted
than simply because they regard it as a tourist resort.
My organisation has spent the past five years travelling the world
promoting Glasgow and Scotland as the venue for the 50th World Congress
of Junior Chamber International, which commences on Sunday. Four
thousand ''tourists'' from more than 67 different countries have all
been persuaded to come.
It would be the most romantic patriot who could honestly regard
Scotland in November as an ideal place to spend a week of your
hard-earned holiday allocation. But without exception, on all of our
trips and presentations, we were all well received and had little
difficulty in ''selling'' a week's holiday in Scotland.
The influence and regard in which Scotland and the Scots are held
around the world should not be underestimated. The power of the
much-derided ''Tartan and Bagpipe'' brand image should not be
underestimated. We used it unashamedly and, as we have proved, to great
effect.
We asked the system to help and it worked wonders. By the system, I
mean the British Tourist Authority, the Scottish Tourist Board, the
Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and Convention Bureau, the Glasgow
Development Agency, Strathclyde Regional Council, and last, but
certainly by no means least, Glasgow City Council. As a team they have
been outstanding in their support for our efforts and, in turn, for the
Scottish tourist industry.
Jill Crawshaw makes much of there being nothing to do in Fort William
on a blustery autumn Sunday afternoon. I venture to suggest that if
there were, it would have been artificially introduced, it would not be
inherently Scottish and it would be unexpected. People come to Scotland
because it is different from the other resorts they have visited. It was
wrong that she suffered discourteous service. It was wrong of her to
have expected Scotland to be something that it is not.

SCOTTISH Liberal Democrats' leader Jim Wallace yesterday challenged
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth on what role the national police
squad announced by the Prime Minister at the Tory conference would have
north of the Border.
Mr Wallace wrote to Mr Forsyth after a written answer from the Prime
Minister to Liberal Democrat MP Alan Beith which did not rule out the
possibility of the squad operating in Scotland, but indicated that
responsibility for consulting on the proposal was in the hands of the
Home Secretary.
Mr Wallace told a Westminster news conference: ''Few people would
object to an onslaught on organised crime, but increasingly it appears
that the Prime Minister's conference proposal was a half-baked offering
to the party faithful to try to reasure them that the problem of crime
was being taken seriously.
''If the squad is to operate in Scotland, it seems that the Scottish
Secretary is being sidlelined.''
However, Mr Wallace's comments were dismissed by Government sources.
Downing Street admitted the details still were being worked out, but the
Scottish Office said: ''We are and always have been fully involved in
consultation over the use of the security services in this manner.''

COMPETITION is hotting up in the unit trust and PEP markets, with
major players coming out with products backed by very low charges, which
is good news for consumers.
Despite firm stock markets sales of PEPs are running at low levels as
investors remain wary about the economic climate. But PEP sales have
always been seasonal, with the peak selling period coming as the end of
the tax year approaches. Next year also sees the first Tessas maturing,
with several billions needing to find a home within the space of a few
months. So we can expect more marketing initiatives in coming months.
Legal &amp; General (L&amp;G) made waves this week with the launch of a new
PEP based on tracking the all-share index. It will carry no initial or
withdrawal fees and the only charges will be a flat #25 per annum plus
0.5%, with VAT on top of the total. No investment will carry charges
exceeding 1% a year.
L&amp;G has also removed the initial fee on its whole PEP range, including
a new Corporate Bond PEP. However, it will carry withdrawal fees until
five years are up. The annual management charge is 1.25%, taken from
income. Net of this, the running yield is 8.2%.
This launch was followed almost immediately by news from HSBC Asset
Management that it was abolishing initial charges on its range of
index-tracking funds. They already carry no-exit penalties. Annual
charges vary, with 0.5% on the All-share index fund and 1% on the
FTSE-100 fund. The latter carries no extra charge for being within a
PEP.
Index-tracking sounds boring for an investment in equities but the
figures indicate that it is a sound way of investing for the long-term.
The average general or even growth unit trust has not matched the index
performance in recent years.

TOMORROW in Edinburgh the ICO, the International Committee of Public
Relations Consultants' Associations from 15 countries, installs a new
president.
Peter Hehir, chairman of Countrywide Communications, based in
Oxfordshire with offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as London,
Brussels and Leeds, chose Scotland for his inaugural board meeting
because he was educated at Paisley Grammar School and began his career
on the Renfrewshire Gazette.
His firm has been described by trade journals as ''the most successful
PR consultancy of the decade'' and now has a number of European clients,
most prestigiously the European Commission itself, in which he has
already instituted a questioning approach to how they present themselves
to the constituent parts of the organisation and member countries of the
EU.
He describes the art of public relations as the management of
reputation, while acknowledging that the business itself still has ''an
unsavoury reputation in certain quarters''.
The cub reporter from the Barrhead News headed for the bright lights
of London and the press office of the Milk Marketing Board in defiance
of advice from his editor that he was too shy and not sufficiently tough
for PR.
After being press officer on the Milk Race, he opted out of the rat
race 22 years ago to set up his own consultancy in Banbury in
Oxfordshire.
It was a demonstration of his belief that business should not have to
be London-centred, although with hindsight he said: ''If I had known
then what I know now, I wouldn't have done it.''
Nevertheless, he went on to make a virtue of his extra-metropolitan
location, spreading literally countrywide through the 80s and now
boasting a staff of 250 consultants and an income of #20m as well as
some of the bluest-chips among accounts: Rolls-Royce, ICI and Walkers
shortbread, for starters.
A delegate from the UK Public Relations Consultants' Association to
the ICO for the past four years, he says there are international issues
about how major companies and multinationals use PR consultants.
There is an important difference between marketing communicators
(although that may be a part of some PRs' work) and corporate
communication. Information and research, with a very clear idea of their
objectives is all-important, he says.

EDINBURGH-based J Smart (Contractors) more than doubled pre-tax
profits in the year to end-July, although one-off gains on the sale of
land, property and other assets accounted for the bulk of the increase.
Boosted by exceptional gains of #1.37m, pre-tax profits leapt from
#1.65m to #3.44m. With no one-off items in the 12 months to July last
year, the increase in underlying profits was only 25%.
Turnover advanced by about 3% to #17.6m.
With a final payout of 6.6p, the total dividend is up 5.9% at 9.0p.
As is customary in the family-dominated company, shareholders owning
nearly 50% of the shares waived their rights to the entire dividend,
thereby boosting retained profits by #451,773.
Smart, which managed to reverse the recession-fuelled rot of recent
times in the 12 months to end-July, has been using disposal proceeds to
purchase more building land.
The company, which operates throughout the Central Belt and employs
about 400 people, is engaged in building contracting, private
housebuilding and property development.
Chairman John Smart declined to comment on the much-publicised
problems of the construction industry or his own company's current
trading, as always reserving his views for the annual report.
Shares in Smart yesterday edged up 1p to 219p.

A GOVERNMENT statement on Downing Street security was demanded in the
Commons yesterday after an embarrassing and potentially dangerous lapse.
Police launched an urgent inquiry into claims that a newspaper
reporter and another man were able to spend more than 40 minutes
unchallenged in No. 10 and the neighbouring Cabinet Office and Treasury.
A Downing Street spokesman refused to discuss the incident in detail
but said all alleged breaches of security would be investigated.
''Whenever we get evidence we carry out an immediate and thorough
review and take any action necessary arising from such inquiries,'' the
spokesman said.
''We are completely satisfied with the Prime Minister's personal
security.''
Raising the issue with Commons Leader Tony Newton yesterday and
demanding a statement, Labour MP Simpson (Nottingham South) asked:
''Could you explain how people without passes are going to be restricted
from wandering round 10 Downing Street and would you like to comment on
the rumour going around that the reason why people weren't noticed is
the place was full of people who didn't know why they were there
anyway?''
Replying during questions on forthcoming Commons business, Leader of
the House Tony Newton said: ''I appreciate your questions since, on the
accounts that I've seen, the intruders must actually have passed by the
side of my office on their way.
''But all I can say is that the incident to which you refer is being
investigated and I am sure it will be thoroughly investigated.''

Tokyo, Thursday -- Nissan Motor Company today reported its first
operating profit in four years, saying cost-cutting and a recovery in
domestic sales had offset damage to its export earnings from
appreciation of the yen.
Japan's second biggest carmaker, which has a plant at Sunderland, Tyne
and Wear, made a parent operating profit of 5120m yen in the six months
to the end of September, compared to an 82.61bn yen loss in the same
period a year earlier.
Operating profits are from core business. Nissan's current earnings,
which include gains and losses made on investments in securities and
other activities, also improved sharply as the company reported an 8800m
yen loss compared to a loss of 57.89bn yen in the year-earlier period.
''Business was tough in the past as the strong yen hurt our
cost-cutting efforts. But we have left the worst phase . . . Our
rationalisation programme is making progress as planned,'' said managing
director Koichi Takagi.
Despite the difficult times, Nissan opened a new axle plant in
September to serve the British and Continental European markets.
Nissan was optimistic about the rest of the business year, predicting
an operating profit of 40 billion yen for the full year and a current
profit of 25bn yen, compared to a current loss of 61.07bn yen a year
earlier.
''In order to keep the company on course to sustain profits from the
the fiscal year ending March 1997 as well, we will continue to carry out
the company's restructuring programmes,'' Mr Takagi said.
Nissan has been remodelling popular up-scale cars such as the Cedric
and Gloria to regain market share. Domestic sales surged 19.7% from a
year earlier to 538,096 vehicles in the first half, while exports rose
only 0.3% to 312,708.
At the same time, the company is conducting an aggressive streamlining
programme. It aims to reduce staff to 48,000 people by March 1996 from
53,000 three years earlier.
The company said cost-cutting efforts would save it 130bn yen this
business year, while higher sales would boost operating profit by 35bn
yen and the impact of the strong yen would cost it 50bn yen.
Nissan posted an extraordinary loss of 24.46bn yen in its half-year,
including 18.57bn for its early retirement programme. It lowered the
eligible age for the retirement scheme to 30 years old from 50.
Mr Takagi said Nissan might sell securities holdings in the second
half of this year to help pay for the programme.
He said he expected an average exchange rate of 92 to 93 yen to the
dollar this year, compared to 102 last year.
Industry analysts said Nissan's forecasts seemed too conservative
given the extent of the car maker's recovery. Noriyuki Matsushima at
Nikko Research Center predicted a current profit of 30bn yen this year
and an operating profit of 50bn yen.
Hiroshi Suemasa at Kankaku Research Institute forecast a current
profit of 40bn yen to 50bn yen, and an operating profit of 80bn yen.
However, he said Nissan's troubled overseas operations, including a
loss-making unit in Mexico, meant its group earnings would probably not
be as rosy. -- Reuter

<HEADLINE>Textile group hit by falling demand. Baird takes #9.8m charge</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAN MCCONNELL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

TEXTILES group William Baird, which has been hit by the overall
weakness of retail demand, will take a #9.8m reorganisation charge in
this year's accounts.
About 600 of Baird's 16,000-strong UK workforce face the axe but no
jobs will be lost north of the Border.
The City reacted badly to yesterday's announcement and Baird shares
were cut 12p to 193p.
However, the entire sector has been weak, with broker downgrades for
textiles groups as a result of the mild weather.
Although there was a feeling that Baird could have done something
sooner, there was some relief in the City that the company had finally
grasped the cost-cutting nettle.
Glasgow-registered Baird, which has its head office in London, said
retail sales volumes in September and October had been affected by the
continued weakness of overall consumer spending. Its problems had been
exacerbated by the unusually mild autumn weather.
Baird's reorganisation will involve the closure of its colour woven
fabrics plant in Lancashire, which employs about 130 people.
The cuts will also affect Baird's children's wear and menswear
manufacturing operations in the UK, and its central cutting and
warehousing activities.
It is proving difficult for clothing firms to make money by
manufacturing children's wear in the UK and Baird plans to source a lot
of it overseas. More men's suits will be imported from Eastern Europe.
Marketing, garment processing and distribution will also be
rationalised, and the book values of property, plant and fixtures which
become surplus to requirements as a result of the reorganisation will be
written down.
Baird chief executive Jock Green-Armytage said the company's
operations at Polmadie and Springburn in Glasgow, Grangemouth, and East
Kilbride would be unaffected by the reorganisation.
He claimed the general cost-cutting and restructuring was not a
reaction to difficult trading or any ''disaster''.
He added: ''This is a strategic move to really get us in balance for
the future. If I had to characterise it in terms of today's climate, I
would say the climate may have accelerated what we have done rather than
have caused it.
''I have been planning some reorganisation for some time. It is not an
easy sector at this point.''
Of the #9.8m charge, #6.9m relates to redundancy and other costs, with
#2.9m provided for asset write-downs.
It includes a previously-signalled, #1.1m charge relating to the
integration of the Morris Cohen lingerie business, acquired by Baird in
December.
Baird estimated that the changes, to be implemented over the next 14
months, would result in cost savings of at least #3m next year. It
anticipates that the #9.8m programme will have more than paid for itself
by the end of 1997.
Mr Green-Armytage said the cost reduction and restructuring programme
would contribute to ''progressive margin improvement'' in 1996 and into
1997.
Baird said it was too early to forecast the likely outcome for the
year to end-December, as much depended on the level of retail demand in
the run-up to Christmas.
Mr Green-Armytage believes the number of job losses may not ultimately
be as high as 600, if Baird can successfully continue its policy of
trying to transfer factories to other companies, instead of closing
them, and ensuring the new owner retains the workforce.
After the exceptional charge, Joan D'Olier at NatWest Securities is
forecasting pre-tax profits of #15m, representing a slight drop in
underlying profits. Last year, Baird made profits of #25.1m.

Hong Kong, Thursday -- Hong Kong Telecommunications today announced a
net profit at the higher end of analysts' expectations, up 14.8% to
$HK4810m in the six months to September 30.
The result includes Hong Kong Telecom's first quarter of business
since it lost its exclusive 70-year monopoly on domestic fixed telephone
lines in Hong Kong on June 30.
''The result was in line with expectations for an 11% to 15% rise, and
was unexciting to the market,'' said broker Michael Ng at Sassoon
Securities.
Earnings per share rose to 43.2 cents from 37.6 cents in the year
earlier period and dividend rose to 30.9 cents from 26.9 cents.
Three new competitors have announced operations in Hong Kong, although
it will take time for them to steal any substantial market share from
Hong Kong Telecom, analysts said. They said competition would not bite
into earnings for some time.
Hong Kong Telecom retains the lucrative monopoly on international
phone traffic until 2006.
Hong Kong Telecom is 57.5%-owned by Cable &amp; Wireless of Britain.
The three new competitors are owned by New World Development Wharf
(Holdings) and Hutchison Whampoa.
One analyst said that from a first glance it appeared Hong Kong
Telecom had been able to raise operating margins despite the advent of
competition in the local market.
But he was keen to hear at a company briefing to analysts about the
growth in China traffic, one of the biggest money-spinners for the
company, as well as future prospects.
''There is competition, we know that, and it's been more intense,''
said one analyst.

SCOTTISH businesses will have nothing to fear from a European
licensing system to ensure compliance with environmental regulation, if
they are genuinely as compliant as they claim to be, the Strathclyde
East Euro-MP Ken Collins told members of CBI Scotland yesterday.
Mr Collins, who is chairman of the European Parliament Committee on
the Environment, Public Health, and Consumer Protection, told
businessmen and women that a licensing system operating across the
European Union was necessary to ensure a level playing field for all
member states.
''There is no way at the moment that leaving compliance entirely in
the hands of member states is going to achieve this level playing field.
''British industry tends to say that it is very good at compliance and
all those others are not. If you genuinely believe that the UK is that
good, then there is nothing to fear from an inspection system,'' Mr
Collins told a conference on the role of business in the environment in
Glasgow.
He added that he could not envisage a European inspection system being
set up whereby inspectors went around businesses with ''measuring
jars''. Instead, he favoured a form of auditing system authorised by the
EU, but put in place by the member state itself, along the lines of
Euratom, fisheries licensing, and meat inspection.
Alasdair Paton, chief executive of the new Scottish Environmental
Protection Agency (Sepa) told the conference that prosecution for
infringement of environmental regulations would be a last resort. Sepa
would seek to work in co-operation with businesses, industry and the
public as far as possible, he said.
Mr Paton added that he hoped the new agency would be a one-stop agency
and that members of staff would become multi-disciplined so that they
could deal with water, air and waste regulation.
Sepa will come into effect in April 1996 and will incorporate the
current powers of local authorities, Her Majesty's Industrial Pollution
Inspectorate, and the River Purification Boards. It will be divided into
three regions and have its headquarters in Stirling.
The head of the CBI's environment and tourism group, Dr Claire Craig,
told the conference that British businesses had seen regulations
increase by 600% between 1980 and 1990 compared to 100% in France. She
said that compliance with environmental regulations had not led to
industries being shut down or massive job losses, but nor had
environmental protection regulations led to massive job creation.

THE Bank of France yesterday said it was cutting its 24-hour emergency
lending rate to 6.6% from 7.0%. It last cut the rate, from 7.25%, on
October 16.
The cut in the rate came after the franc recovered against the mark,
helped by a commitment by President Jacques Chirac last week to make a
reduction in France's big public deficits his top priority. The franc
was trading around 3.4590 per mark immediately after the move, compared
with a low of 3.5395 at the beginning of last week.

THE Diary was, we confess, a subscriber to the Great Clydesdale Pie in
the Sky scam, in which, you may remember, the House of Clydesdale
promised to give you your money back in five years if you purchased a TV
or VTR from them. They of course went spectacularly bust a couple of
years back.
We were reminded of this by a letter from Granada Insurance Ltd
telling us that they had taken over the administration of the insurance
scheme, warning us of the imminent lapsing of the extended warranty and
offering to renew it for a total of #165.96.
We were unaware that we were still insured and, on telephoning the
company to ask why we hadn't been informed, were told by a Ms Yvonne
Greenaway that ''the company is not in the business of inviting
claims''. In effect, the insurance company backing the warranty has had
a holiday from claims, as until now no-one has informed the hapless
punters of the changeover.
Granada claim that Clydesdale or the receivers should have done it.
Jason Chandler of Granada said: ''It would have cost the company a
fortune to do that.'' Former Clydesdale customers might want to contact
the Association of British Insurers in London for a list of alternative
insurers.
Light fantastic
OVERHEARD at Reset, a recent conference on reusable energy in Glasgow
which was hosted by Brian Kane, head of engineering at the city's
department of architecture, was the question: ''How many Scottish Office
apparatchiks does it take to change a light bulb?'' The answer is of
course that Scottish Office apparatchiks don't change things per se but
that they would take advice, form a committee, and after three years
issue a 64-page pamphlet entitled The Positive Aspects of Darkness.
Snow joke
JIMMIE Macgregor, broadcaster and backpacker, has recently been to the
Arctic Circle, as well as down to the shops lots of times. He is making
a programme titled Macgregor's Arctic Crossing. On his return he was
talking to some cronies in his local and trying to convey some
impression of the immensity of it all. ''There's Greenland,'' he
explains ''the biggest island in the world but with only half the
population of Paisley.'' One of the chums present said: ''Is that right?
Any chance of it taking the other half?''
Cut to the quick
IT'S not so barry, Norman.
The above title, a play on the Edinburgh patois word for excellent,
whose Glasgow equivalent would be pure brilliant or gallus, heads a
press release issued by the Edinburgh Film Festival, which has taken a
smidgeon of genteel umbrage at Mr Norman's suggestion on TV this week
that ''the London (Film) festival is the only important showcase for
international cinema in Britain''.
Their suggestion is that he come to Edinburgh, which in its 50th year
is the longest running film festival in the world and during which this
year 30,000 people saw 130 feature films. The question the Scottish
public has to ask itself is ''Do we really need a Bazza as well as a
Gazza?''
Oui et non
A FRENCH question unconnected to the blatant immorality and cynicism
of their nuclear testing, from Gordon S Kinloch of Glasgow. He wants to
know whether the French put their clocks backwards and forwards as we
do, and if they do whether they call the night of this adjustment a
''Nocturne''? Our informant at the French Embassy tells us that yes they
do and no they don't.
Ure nicked
CAIRRY-oot purchasers in Castlemilk this evening had better hold on
tight because as part of the Castlemilk Folk Festival, Midge Ure shares
a bill there tonight with Julie Felix. In the excellent book about the
Apollo, You Don't Have To Be in Harlem by Russell Leadbetter (available
from all good book stores and a few naff ones. End of plug.) the bold
Midge confesses that when his band Salvation were supporting Sweet at
the Apollo, while Sweet were on stage he provided his mates and himself
with some instant salvation by adroitly relocating Sweet's booze supply
from their spacious dressing room to Salvation's sweaty cupboard.
Perfect hosts
IF all of the footballers suggested by the Diary's correspondents open
all of the restaurants suggested, the rest of Scotland's caterers would
go broke, as we have been inundated with ideas, many of them libellous.
Here are some of the printable ones from Colin Irons of Kelvindale. He
proposes that Mutton Dressed as Lambie needs no introduction and that
Graeme Souness would be mine host at The Wild Foul Inn, while Andy
Goram's One For the Road would be licensed, but for how long?
He further suggests that nutmeg would feature high on the menu at the
pad of Ray Clemence and that Jim Baxter would have Fresh Liver, no doubt
while studying the Whine List at Jim McLean's establishment.

Diary). Conspicuous by his non-presence alongside Yeltsin, Clinton,
Mandela et al, is John Major. The mundane explanation is that his plane
was late (is there only one plane a week to New York from London?) but
we prefer the version that he actually took the photograph, except that
it is very colourful and sharply focused, quite unlike our dear PM.
Tangerine dream
FINALLY, and back once more to football, a Diary correspondent
suggests that this week's Nae Luck Award should go to a certain mobile
phone company which presumably paid unfeasibly large amounts of money to
advertise during the half-time break in the Rangers v Juventus gubbing,
oops, game. The commercial ended with the words ''The future's bright,
the future's Orange''.

STORE-fitting group Havelock Europa, which is based in Fife, yesterday
expanded its board with the appointment of Peter Aslet as corporate
planning and strategy director.
Mr Aslet, 43, who has worked for petroleum giant BP and chemicals
company ICI on both sides of the Atlantic, was most recently general
manager (finance) at Glasgow-based Clydesdale Bank.
He will be responsible for Havelock's acquisitions, information
technology development, and relations with its marketing partners, which
include AT&amp;T.

IN APRIL, 1995, the new Envi-
ronment Agency will assume responsibility for environmental matters in
England and Wales. Among its statutory duties will be one to take an
interest in flooding.
On the same date the new Scottish Environment Protection Agency will
assume responsibility for Scottish environmental matters. Unlike its
English and Welsh counterpart, SEPA will have no statutory duty to take
an interest in flooding.
After major flooding in both the east and west of Scotland in recent
years, could the Scottish MPs explain, not least to people recently
flooded, why this should be? The debates on the two Bills are now over,
so why does Scotland still have no authority which is going to concern
itself as a duty about flooding?
Why will Scotland still have no authority with responsibility, for
example, to check watercourses and ensure that such potential flood
causes as culverts are kept clear?
How will flood alleviation schemes such as that proposed for the White
Cart be undertaken when three different unitary authorities assume
responsibility for the required legislation?
Will it require people to be drowned during a flood before the
buck-passing ceases and one authority assumes overall responsibility for
flood matters in Scotland?

KWIK Save yesterday re-inforced J Sainsbury's downbeat message on
Wednesday that pricing pressure has intensified in the last eight weeks.
The biggest surpermarket discounter said like for like volume sales
had fallen by 2.5% as it lost market share to several rivals -- although
some of the damage was also due to its major shop renovation programme.
As a result, Kwik Save shares slumped 68p to 612p, wiping #112m off
the market capitalisation to #952m. Sainsbury dropped another 12p after
the preceding day's 21p fall with smaller setbacks among the other major
supermarkets.
Pre-tax profits fell 7.4% to #125m on turnover up 6% to #3230m in a
year when it was integrating the #54m acquisition of Shoprite as well as
taking 98 low-performing stores out of action for two weeks to upgrade
them.
That is a continuing programme until all 350 are re-vitalised out of a
current group total of 979. The number of stores being renovated will
grow by perhaps as many as 40 more this year.
The stores that have been brightened up have seen a 6% sales decline
reversed to a 7% gain and the programme will have lost almost #100m in
turnover and cost about #2m in profit and overhead costs.
The profits setback was the first since the company came to the market
in 1970 although the dividend total has been raised 3.9% to 20p with a
14.05p final dividend.
Profits were distorted by a #15m credit from bringing forward supplier
discounts from December to the Kwik Save year-end in August -- that will
have no impact in the current year results.
But that was offset by substantial distribution depot reorganisation
concentrating for the long-term on Wellingborough and Pitreavie although
there is currently some double running at the three being shut down.
There was also a #6m loss of profit on aquiring Shoprite which has about
100 outlets in Scotland.
Kwik Save managing director Graeme Bowler said its food price
inflation index was currently 2.8% compared with the 4[1/2]% of
Sainsbury. One minor relief is that the number of different Continental
discounters doing business in Britain is dropping although those
remaining seem to have been bidding expensively for new sites.
Mr Bowler has yet to decide whether to emulate the competition in
issuing a loyalty card -- the Tesco one has swept the field leaving
Sainsbury and Safeway struggling miles behind. But the problem is that
with current operating margins of only 3.3%, giving away 1% to customers
would mean slicing almost a third of profits in the short term and he is
not in that game.
But he is selling detergent and bleach at 7p a litre -- he would not
say how much he is losing on these -- to attract customers.
Fortunately, there are no balance sheet strains with gearing at just
7% and more than able to finance this year's #150m capital programme
following upon last time's #200m which included the Shoprite deal and
#12m conversion programme.
This is a sector where only Tesco and Asda seem to be showing real
vitality and they too seem to be facing a pretty torrid Christmas on the
pricing front.
It would take a lot of courage to buy now and Kwik Save's 4.1% yield
provides little support -- but at least it does not have the management
uncertainty at Sainsbury.

THE broader market was held back yesterday by disappointing results
from deep-discounter Kwik Save, which sparked a sell-off in the food
retailing sector.
In spite of overnight gains for overseas markets and a strong advance
on Wall Street in the afternoon, the FTSE-100 index of leading shares
added only 4.3 points to 3523.0. Advancers outnumbered decliners by
about five to three, in volume of about 700 million shares.
One senior trader said: ''The food retailers and the stores in a broad
sense were the problem today -- if it wasn't for them we'd have gone
higher.''
In spite of this, underlying sentiment remained positive, having been
boosted by the independent French central bank's delivery of a
larger-than-expected cut in its emergency 24-hour lending rate.
Another dealer said: ''The background to UK shares looks better with
this rate cut from France and we feel equities and gilts will respond
quite well in the last couple of months of the year.''
Second-line stocks were little changed overall. The FTSE Mid-250 edged
down 1.7 to 3886.8 points.
December gilt futures closed just below 107[1/2], up more than
one-quarter of a point. Gilts took heart from firm US Treasuries and the
recovery of sterling and the dollar.
Kwik Save slumped 68p to 610p, after announcing falls in sales volume
and pre-tax profits and reigniting fears of price wars.
Elsewhere in the food retailing sector, Sainsbury lost 12p to 391p,
Argyll was cut 11p to 301p, and Tesco was off 7p on 286p.
Meanwhile, oil giant Shell said the outlook was dimmer in terms of the
crude oil price and its chemicals division. It was cut 17p to 729p, in
spite of a surge in net income for the first nine months of the year.
Cluff Resources, the oil exploration group, bounded ahead 14[1/2]p to
75p after it said it had received an approach which might lead to a
takeover offer.
Boots dropped 11p to 540p, with lack of news about a hoped-for share
buy-back disappointing investors.
ICI was a good performer in top stocks with a 6p rise to 787p, after
it announced a couple of new ventures in China.
Cable &amp; Wireless added 11p to 423p, after its 57.5%-owned Hong Kong
Telecom reported a near-15% increase in first-half profits.

I SYMPATHISE completely with Charles Gibson's letter, An easily
preventable flood (October 30).
Our house, along with many other homes and business premises in the
Hayston and Eastside areas of Kirkintilloch, was swamped by the
floodwater in December last year. We also watched helplessly last week
as the waters once more rose relentlessly, fortunately reaching their
peak inches before breaching the retaining bank of the Park Burn, which
flows into the River Kelvin.
I am sure that the politicians and officials who mouthed reassurance
after the December flood just do not understand the stress caused by
flooding. It is not only the shock of losing possessions and having to
live in temporary accommodation for up to six months; it is the fear
that it will happen again if nothing is done. Nothing has been done.
Thankfully the River Kelvin stayed within its banks this time,
although only just. It was so high, however, that it ''backed up'' the
Park Burn which has only one way to go in such a case and that is over
the eastern bank into the Hayston area where people stay.
The western bank is much higher since the landowners raised it a few
years ago to protect fields where sheep graze occasionally.
At the public meeting following the December disaster and at several
meetings with our local councillor, I proposed that the eastern bank be
widened and raised to match the other bank. This would cost money but it
would give reassurance and some protection to the people of Hayston.
The farmer, after all, can move his sheep to higher ground: we can't
move our homes.
Tackling the problem of the Kelvin flood plains is a long-term must
but, as in Kilmarnock, relatively modest upgrading of vulnerable banks
should be undertaken without delay. The winter has hardly begun!

A JOURNALISTIC variation of Murphy's Law is that errors, unless
swiftly corrected, become received wisdom and are recycled for ever. A
classic illustration is The Herald staff's acceptance that Prestwick
Airport is ''35 miles from Glasgow''.
Since British Midland's legal eagle managed to move the airport five
miles this particular piece of duff gen has been repeated in short order
by Roy Rogers, Margaret Vaughan, and -- within quotes -- in an otherwise
pro-Prestwick letter (October 26).
Katie Wood tried a variation on October 21 with a mystifying joke
about Ryanair's ''Irish geography''. ''Prestwick isn't Glasgow,'' she
observed.
Quite so, but she and The Herald's angels accept Stansted and Gatwick
as London airports, although 35 and 28 miles out of town, respectively.
Actually, Ryanair's grasp of Scottish geography is rather better than
Katie Wood's since Prestwick Airport is 30 miles by road from central
Glasgow -- not exactly out in the sticks. Maybe English miles are
shorter than Scottish miles.
Prestwick would not be ''remote'' even if it was 35 miles out of town
but it is closer than that so I hope you can ensure that Herald
reporters, feature writers, and travel ''experts'' will now stop taking
a miffed English airline's word for it and get it right in future.
In designating their Scottish destination as ''Glasgow Prestwick''
Ryanair followed in the landing wheels of BOAC, Pan-Am, SAS, and KLM in
the years they flew into Prestwick and ticketed passengers to
''Glasgow''.
BOAC operated its own coaches to St Enoch Square and yours truly
provided similar facilities for KLM and SAS as occasion demanded.
Possibly Katie Wood was still at school at the time.
The rail route to the city is less direct but the quickest time by
stopping service is 43 minutes. ''Dedicated'' trains would easily match
anything Stansted can offer.
I can well imagine that BAA -- thinly disguised as Scottish Airports
-- are mad as hell at the surface transport advantage Prestwick gained
with the skywalk and terminal station, but I am baffled at the editorial
mindset which in two letters on October 26 distinguished between
''Glasgow'' and ''Prestwick'' on the one hand and ''London Heathrow'',
''London Gatwick'', ''London Stansted'' and ''London Luton'' on the
other.
Glasgow must be the only two-airport city in the world with a press
corps that wants to deny that prestige-enhancing fact.
Maybe the geographical revisionists would be satisfied if Ryanair
promoted its new service as ''Prestwick-Bishop's Stortford'' but where
might that all end: ''Paisley-Mississauga'' instead of
''Glasgow-Toronto''?
Less absurd, perhaps, than it sounds. The former Malton Airport, now
Lester Pearson, lies just outside Metro Toronto in the City of
Mississauga (population 385,000).
There are 90,000 Paisley Buddies who could put in a claim for the
airport on their doorstep. Even Prestwick began life as ''Monkton
Aerodrome'' and was so named until well into the war.

UNDERVALUED Assets Trust is surfing away nicely on the wave of
takeover speculation sweeping the London stock market.
The #90m trust has concentrated its portfolio on economic sectors
where strategic considerations are encouraging mergers and during the
six months to September 30 it continued to outperform the FTSE All-Share
Index.
Net asset value rose 17.4% to 116.8p, outstripping a 14.7% gain in the
All- Share Index.
The trust benefited particularly from cash bids for fund manager
Jupiter Tyndall, stockbroker Smith New Court and pharmaceuticals group
Fisons.
The trust, which was launched by Scottish Value Management in April
1994, is currently heavily invested in the finance sector,
pharmaceuticals, transport, defence and small oil companies.
''This gives us confidence that we are well placed to take advantage
of future corporate activity in the UK which should release further
value in the portfolio,'' said chairman John Kay.
The trust, which raised an additional #26m through a placing and open
offer in July, aims to outperform the All Share index by investing in
undervalued UK stocks.
But it places less emphasis on dividend growth. The dividend policy
aims to achieve 50% to 75% of the All Share yield.
There was no interim payout, but a single final dividend is promised.
Scottish Value Management managing director Colin MacLean said the
trust had missed out to some extent on takeover speculation in the
utilities sector.
But he said it had deliberately steered clear of electricity and water
companies because they were seen as vulnerable to political and
regulatory interference.
''We like companies which we feel are more in control of their own
destiny,'' he said.
Undervalued Assets Trust's top 15 holdings include Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Mr MacLean said the true worth of the bank had been underestimated
until the Lloyds/TSB merger sparked a wave of takeover fever in the
financial sector.
He said Royal Bank had proved wise to invest in the United States, it
had prevented any erosion of its margins and offered considerable
potential in the mortgage sector.
''It is a good business which has been very much out of favour until
the recent takeover speculation,'' he said.

<RECORDNO>975569142</RECORDNO>

IT is not often that large companies put the interests of society in
general ahead of their own commercial interests but Boots would like us
to believe that is is one of them.
It is firmly in favour of the retention of the 25-year-old Retail
Price Maintenance (RPM) on over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Boots
believes that it is vital to retain community pharmacies which provide a
vital social role in providing healthcare.
Any abolition of RPM would inevitably lead to a price war in
over-the-counter medicines. Smaller independent pharmacies could not
hope to compete with stores like Asda and Sainsbury. There are currently
more than 12,000 pharmacies in the UK of which Boots operates by far the
largest chain with 1194 outlets.
As an employer of thousands of pharmacists in its chemists shops it is
well placed to know the extent of the value-added service which these
specially trained people provide.
Whatever happens in the OTC market, Boots has little cause to worry.
It already is the market leader in terms of number of chemist shops. Its
own brands have leading shares in several areas and its prices are
already competitive.
So far, the price war has centred on vitamin and mineral supplements
but the real battle is likely to be in toiletries and healthcare. This
remains one of the few growth markets in retailing which continues to
enjoy high margins.
Boots itself is investing heavily in developing new and innovative
toiletry products. It will be hoping to replicate the success of its
cruelty-free Natural Collection of toiletries and cosmetics, No 7
cosmetics brand and Soltan suncare range.
In taking on Boots, and the pharmaceutical industry in general, the
superstores face a much tougher battle than they encountered when trying
(and recently succeeding) to crack the Net Book Agreement which set the
retail prices of books. This is reflected in City analysts' forecasts
that at most #10m of Boots' profitability is at stake if RPM is
abolished.
Healthy look
BACK in May just after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, rejected a call for a rise in interest rates by the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, sterling hit an all-time low against
the German mark.
Its trade weighted index also hit a low of 82.7, at which point
sterling had lost 6.5% of its international value since the start of the
year.
Although political considerations occasionally undermined the pound's
standing, the main reason for its fall from grace was the weakness of
the US dollar.
Because of the close economic and financial ties between Britain and
the US the pound often finds itself in a pig in the middle situation
between the dollar and the Deutschmark.
Currency weakness is a sure-fire way of importing inflation, and
sterling's plight was a major factor in Bank of England pressure for
higher rates.
Events proved that the Chancellor was right in his judgment that a
slowdown in economic activity made dearer money unnecessary.
Over the summer the pound perked up, largely because the dollar staged
a good rally, especially against the Japanese yen. In September, the
evidence of a slowdown in activity became so strong that the Governor
dropped his call for an increase in rates.
But worries about a shortfall in Exchequer revenues, caused by the
slowdown, upset the gilt-edged market. Sterling again weakened as the
dollar ran into trouble over the Quebec referendum, a fresh bout of
weakness in the Mexican peso, and concerns over the US Budget and trade
deficit.
By last night, both the pound and the dollar had a healthier look
about them. The pound's loss of international value had been reduced to
4.5%.
Hopes that inflation will peak in the first half of next year are
crucially dependent on continued stability in the foreign exchange
markets.
However great the political pressures may be on the Chancellor to
throw caution to the winds and bring forward major tax cuts in his
Budget at the end of the month, he is not really in a position to do so.
A tight Budget is necessary if a damaging deterioration in sterling is
to be avoided. The run-up to the General Election and the probability of
continued volatility in the dollar will make life difficult enough for
the pound.
Oil price woes
SHELL is assured of a year of strong profits growth in 1995 but the
outlook looks less promising as crude oil prices are set to remain low
and this year's gainers in the downstream activities will be moving into
reverse.
The current year is being driven by a cyclical upturn in chemicals
which has already ended. Third-quarter profits from this sector were up
on last year but down on the second quarter. The final quarter will
compare with a period when recovery was coming through so there may be
little growth.
Shell says the current weakening of prices and demand will continue
into 1996 but believes this is a pause rather than a cyclical downturn,
which provides some comfort.
Chairman John Jennings thinks the industry had better start getting
used to low oil prices because that is how they are going to stay. He
sees little chance of Brent crude moving out of its current $12 to $18 a
barrel range in the next 10 years. If anything they are more likely to
stay towards the bottom end of the spread.
The task facing the industry is dealing with the over-capacity in both
upstream (producing) and downstream (refining and marketing) activities.
Cost-cutting has been under way for some time but will have to continue.
However, the search for oil must continue to replace depleted reserves
and this is not going to get any cheaper as more inaccessible places
have to be targeted. Shell had a good run of discoveries in the 1980s
but its record in recent years has been no better than average.
There is a good correlation between exploration success and dividend
payments so there is a chance Shell's excellent track record of
increases in their payouts will slow. But given a strong balance sheet
and cash flow, there should still be growth in real terms.

STAKIS, the Glasgow-based hotel and casino group, has announced plans
to build a four star hotel for business travellers in London at a cost
of #12m.
The 180-room hotel in Upper Street, Islington is due to open in the
summer of 1997.
It will be built over a 250-place car park, near the Angel tube
station, within easy reach of Kings Cross station and the City financial
district.
''Opportunities to build hotels in London are very limited,'' said
Stakis chief executive David Michels.
''I am therefore delighted to have acquired this well located site
where Stakis can develop a good four-star unit tailored for the needs of
the business traveller.''
Stakis currently operates 42 hotels, 23 casinos and one hotel casino
in the UK.
Although the group has bought several new hotels in recent months, the
new unit in Islington is the first to be built from scratch since it
commissioned a 134-room facility at Edinburgh airport in March 1994.That
opened for business in July this year.
Stakis shares were unchanged at 76.5p.

NORTH West Water has been given a green light to proceed with its
#1830m agreed bid for Norweb, the regional electricity company serving
North-west England which, if successful, will create Britain's first
multi-utility company.
President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang said the bid would not be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
His statement said the director-general of Fair Trading had advised a
referral, citing concerns about regulating a mixed utility, barriers to
entry and managerial efficiency.
However, neither Professor Stephen Littlechild nor Ian Byatt,
respectively the regulators for the electricity and water industries,
considered that a reference was necessary either on regulatory or
competition grounds.
The decision not to refer the bid paves the way for further possible
mergers along similar lines although earlier this week Thames Water
ruled out bidding for London Electricity.
Mr Lang said that while the merger did raise issues about the
regulation of the merged company, these could be dealt with by
appropriate licence amendments.
Mr Byatt said he had agreed with North West Water to amend its licence
to ensure transparency if it merges with Norweb. He said: ''I must have
proper access to information on the efficiencies and cost savings
arising from the merger''.
He added that he would need to take account of any savings in the next
price review to ensure the benefits flow to customers.
The licence amendments ensure that Mr Byatt has access to the costs of
the joint facilities management company.
They also strengthen the financial ring fencing arrangements which
prohibit the transfer of any asset from North West Water to the
facilities management company without Byatt's consent.
Mr Byatt said that if the merger went ahead it was important that the
electricity watchdog Offer, the water regulator Ofwat and the customer
representative bodies continue to work closely together to ensure that
customers' interests are fully protected.
The bid clearance prompted Norweb's shares to add 30p to 1185p while
shares in North West Water gained 2p to 597p.

THE Quebec referendum on independence has produced one interesting
fact and one interesting statement.
The fact: Quebec already has devolved government and just as the
Conservatives have suggested would happen in relation to Scottish
devolution, the separatists in Quebec are not satisfied with the
devolved government they have, and want independence.
The interesting statement was made by Mr Salmond in an interview about
the Quebec referendum. In it he stated clearly that Scottish
independence would be better than Quebec's because Scotland would have
independence as part of a federal Europe. Just imagine that, five
million Scots submerged in 300 million Europeans and administered from
Brussels.

CONSUMERS of chocolate and producers of cocoa are both out to lose if
plans to substitute cocoa butter with vegetable fat go ahead.
As Anvar Khan reported, there are discussions at present in Europe to
allow 5% substitution of cocoa butter which, if allowed, would be bad
news for our health in terms of the increase in cholesterol content of
chocolate and bad news for farmers in cocoa producing countries (October
27).
Europe imports 60% of the world market of cocoa beans, most of which
comes from 31 African, Caribbean, or Pacific countries.
Some of these countries, like the Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Cameroon,
are highly dependent on cocoa. A reduction in the demand for cocoa could
seriously affect the livelihood of many farmers in these countries.
The alleged advantage of cocoa butter substitution is that it will
improve the shelf life of chocolate; there is no evidence of this.
Consumers, who have not asked for the proportion of cocoa butter to be
reduced, will lose out in terms of quality and producers will lose out
by having their incomes reduced.
As vegetable fat is cheaper than cocoa butter, the only winners will
be the confectionery companies who will increase their profits.

THERE is one lesson Scots should take from the Quebec referendum. Both
the politicians and the press failed the people of Quebec.
Nearly a quarter of the 93% of people who went to the polls believed
that separation would not mean any change to their currency, their
passport, or even their ability to send representatives to the House of
Commons! This is an unbelievably high number given the level of interest
in the question.
Members of the press have a duty to the public to accurately inform
and educate on matters which have such dramatic consequences.
Politicians must not mislead the public on issues simply to achieve any
objective.
Splitting up a country is not a game.
Separation would significantly affect the quality of life for the
average person in Quebec, and in Scotland if the nationalists ever
achieved power here. Politicians can talk about their aspirations and
hope for a better future, but people have a right to expect them to
state clearly the economic and social implications of their policies.

GEORGE Robertson has a curious interpretation of the Quebec referendum
on sovereignty. He claims that any constitutional uncertainty over
independence would damage financial markets in a Scottish context.
If this is his main argument against the SNP then his coat is on a
very shoogly nail. Perhaps he would care to remind us all how business
and the financial markets reacted at the last General Election, during
the false dawn of a Labour victory? Presumably he would agree that is
equal justification for not voting Labour?

AS a one-time Chairman of the old Scottish Liberal Party and a
frequent visitor to Canada, I have been following the devolution debate
with interest. As usual the parties have latched on to the Quebec
experience and abstracted arguments to support their cause.
The reality is that the Quebec situation bears no resemblance to the
Scottish problem. Quebec is a unique state in history, culture, and
language.
While Montreal is very much a bilingual city in the hinterland and the
north, Gaspe, etc, the language is almost completely French only. In
many restaurants the staff cannot speak English. French law is exercised
and woe betide any driver from Ontario who doesn't alter his technique.
So in many ways the French are masters of their own destiny in Quebec
and many just want to go the whole hog and become independent. But they
also want to negotiate a favourable contract with the rest of Canada and
this is the stumbling-block with the other provinces.
What is much more relevant to the Scottish/British situation is the
way the other provinces of Canada operate. I have visited the parliament
buildings in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and
Ontario. These parliaments are very active and play the most important
role in the ordinary life of the people.
Each province has different rates of taxes but I've never heard of any
province wanting to give up their parliament because their taxes were
higher than others. The very opposite is the case.
The provinces are very proud of their parliaments and people feel they
are very close to them. So giving the provinces their own parliament has
not provoked any desire in their provinces to break up Canada.
There can be dramatic differences between the ruling parties in the
federal and provincial parliaments. For example, the Conservative Party
was almost wiped out in the Canadian elections, yet soon afterwards the
Conservatives took power in Ontario, the most important province in
Canada.
This is not unusual. For years when the Liberals were in power the
Conservatives ruled in Ontario. When the Conservatives were in power in
Ottawa, the Liberals ruled in Toronto.
Of course this causes tension but the Prime Minister holds meetings
with the Premiers of the provinces from time to time and, usually after
debate, agreements are hammered out. The Canadians are civilised and
they realise that governance is not static but evolutionary.
Over the border in America the same situation prevails and I remember
being in the beautiful State House in Vermont. It was quite clear that
the affairs which touch the daily lives of the Vermonters were dealt
with in their own State Legislative.
Of course Vermont does not send a task force to Bosnia, for the duties
of state and national governments are clearly delineated. Yet the states
can vary tremendously and again this is the result of hammering out
where responsibilities lie.
I see a Scottish Parliament being similar to a Canadian provincial
parliament or an American state legislature. The powers of each will be
carefully agreed at the beginning but no doubt changes will take place
in the light of experience. There will be tensions but this is not
necessarily a bad thing. To do nothing will exacerbate the problem in
Scotland.
I welcome the proposed Scottish parliament and congratulate my former
colleague Jim Wallace and my old and friendly opponent George Robertson
on bringing reason and reconciliation into the debate.
I noticed too that no vote was ever taken during the lengthy
negotiations. This is a good Quaker practice probably emanating from an
Episcopal minister who also claims to be a Methodist. I hope this
technique can be developed and we can get rid of the ''yah boo''
politics we witness every day.
I have looked forward for years to home rule and I hope the parliament
when it is established will not be afraid to rethink and change to
ensure that the people of Scotland are well governed. This will be the
New Nova Scotia.

WE understand that your article covering the recent Committee on
Safety of Medicines advice on certain combined oral contraceptives
included a table of contraceptives. In the table you categorised
products according to their safety yet failed to include Cilest.
The CSM advice was based on three new studies which indicate that
combined oral contraceptives containing desogestrel and gestodene were
associated with increased risk of thromboembolism compared to other
progestogens.
An annex page attacked to the CSM advice lists the seven brands
affected by this new information and states that ''no change in
prescribing practice is required for any other combined oral
contraceptive''.
Since Cilest has not been shown to present an increased risk of
thromboembolism it should be included as an unrestricted product in your
tables.

TAX cuts of between #2000m and #5000m are expected in the Budget by
the six ''Wise Men'' who advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the
economy.
Most of them consider that for economic efficiency tax cuts should be
targeted towards lower earners rather than a reduction in the basic
rate.
''In addition most of us would oppose further cuts in public
investment in infrastructure and skills to make room for tax cuts; if
anything there is a case for increasing this type of spending,'' the
Panel of Independent Forecasters say in their latest triannual report.
They believe that current monetary and fiscal policy is too tight and
two, Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research and Professor Wynne Godley of King's College, Cambridge, think
the economy will slow substantially unless policy is relaxed.
On the other hand, Professor David Currie of the London Business
School and Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs reckon there is little scope
for relaxation if the Government's target of inflation below 2[1/2]% is
to be realised. They and Professor Tim Congdon, who has his own research
company, consider there is little scope for tax cuts unless financed by
''genuine and permanent'' reductions in public spending.
Another objective of the Government, to bring the public sector
borrowing requirement back to balance over the medium term is thought
unnecessarily ambitious by most of the team.
None see interest rates rising over the next year or so but only half
the team see a cut in prospect. Gross domestic product is expected to
grow by 2[3/4]% this year and 2[1/2]% next but consumer spending will
remain subdued, expanding by 2%-3% in 1996 from 2% this year. But there
should be a further modest fall in unemployment to about 2.1 million
next year.
The panel expresses concern over the build-up of stocks and is puzzled
why this is happening in the retail sector. Some of it may be due to
retailers rather than wholesalers holding stocks.
They also feel the weak export performance in the first half of the
year is surprising. While part is attributed to the slowdown in world
trade, they reckon that the UK has lost market share, partly because
capacity constraints have started to bite. Even so the trade deficit
should narrow next year.
Internationally the team has ruled out a recession in the US and sees
the economy there picking up. But rising public debt and increasing
rates of return on private capital will prevent any fall back in real
interest rates worldwide.
Sterling is seen staying where it is for the rest of this year, though
Professor Currie and Professor Congdon expect it to appreciate in 1996.
Like other economists, the panel has been surprised that business
investment has not increased faster than it has, particularly in
contrast to the position in the nited States. But they note that
investment does seem to be at last picking up.

THE ghosts of past misdeeds in South Africa could not be buried
forever. The long years of apartheid encompassed and concealed many
despicable acts on both sides of the argument but there is little
disagreement that a significant number were committed by or through the
state. They were all the more despicable for the involvement of those
who were charged with maintaining a civilised rule of law. It was
obvious that the end of apartheid would bring demands for justice, so
signally denied in the preceding years, but President Mandela was wise
enough to defer substantive action and to concentrate on appeals for a
healing of the nation. That necessary delay has allowed South Africa to
make great strides towards a united nationhood, demonstrated only this
week with the results of the local government elections which have
confirmed the dominant position of the ANC, but which also had the
benefit of passing off smoothly and with a good degree of participation
by the electorate. Now comes the crunch. The former Defence Minister,
General Magnus Malan, and 10 of his senior officers have been charged
with the murder of 13 blacks, including 11 women and children killed at
a prayer meeting.
Sections of the white population are outraged at the charges, which
are denied by those involved. The denials, which will probably have to
wait until next year to be contested in court, are couched in
extraordinary language. General Malan insists that he is a moderate and
a democrat and says that democracy in South Africa is now in its darkest
hour. If he believes that he is truly deluded, but it is unlikely that
any admissions of guilt will be forthcoming. This puts a degree of
pressure on the politicians who were Malan's masters at the time,
although whether or not they knew anything about the more dubious
activities of the security forces is still unclear. Great play has been
made of the amnesty clause in the country's interim constitution which
provides for immunity from prosecution for crimes committed with a
political objective. This has always been a difficult clause to
interpret and its inclusion in the current constitution is hard to
justify, other than on grounds of providing a safety valve.
President Mandela is determined in this case not to allow it to be
used loosely, and he is right. As he has made clear, the slaughter of
innocent women and children who were not in a political organisation, of
a priest and members of his congregation, has nothing to do with any
possible justification for crimes of political violence. This has put
Deputy President F W de Klerk, who headed the government in which
General Malan sat as Defence Minister, in a difficult position. He has
insisted that his party stands by the security forces and that temporary
immunity should be granted to the accused. The real and growing danger
for South Africa lies in the suggestion that the trail of evidence of
knowledge of wrongdoing, and even potentially of complicity, might lead
from the Ministry of Defence to senior civilian politicians. Whether
this could engulf Mr de Klerk is unknown, but once charges are laid,
allegations and rumours are certain to follow. There can be no quarrel
with President Mandela's decision to push ahead with the charges against
the officers of the security forces, but he will have to exert firm and
proper political control on the process to stop it running out of hand.
There are plenty of people in South Africa on all sides who would be
happy to manipulate the present situation. It is vital that they are not
given the chance.

BARDON has sold its Civil and Marine aggregates division to the ARC
Marine subsidiary of the Hanson group for #72.3m cash.
The transaction was described by ARC's David Snowdon as a win-win deal
as it would reduce Bardon's gearing while giving ARC substantial
operational benefits as the biggest European producer of sea-dredged
gravel and aggregates.
Bardon got into severe trouble when Evered, which later merged with
Bardon, acquired Civil and Marine for #120m in 1990. The investment was
written down to #66m at the time of the rescue #73m rights issue in
1993. In 1992 and 1993, Bardon lost a total of #88m. Chief executive
Peter Tom tried to sell the operation that year but found no attractive
offers.
The price being paid is one-third above the highest previously offered
and will reduce the gearing of the aggregates and quarrying company from
67% to 45%.
It will enable Bardon to develop the remaining busineses more
effectively including the John Fyfe subsidiary in Scotland and the
quarrying operations based on the largest quarry in Britain at Bardon in
Leicestershire.
Civil and Marine and ARC Marine achieved similar operating profits of
#5.5m last year although Bardon is the more efficent in that these were
generated from just four million tonnes of aggregate compared with the
seven million tonnes of the purchaser.
That is due to a better mix of fleet as well as having a strategic
position with three wharves in the Thames Estuary where prices are
higher than on ARC's stamping ground on the south coast.
Bardon shares firmed 2[1/2]p to 26[1/2]p while Hanson was [1/2]p
better at 190[1/2]p.
* ICI is increasing its presence in China with two major projects in
Shanghai. ICI Paints is to build its second manufacturing plant on anew
site at a cost of $40m.
ICI Polyurethanes has signed a letter of intent with a Chinese
chemical company to form a joint venture to build and operate a new
plant to make one of the key components in polyurethane systems used in
refrigerators, building insulation, footwear and furniture. The size of
the investment is expected to be around $400m.

CHANCELLORS are never short of advice, but that is something always
easier to give than to take, besides, little of what he gets is
disinterested. And he can hardly debate it in public since the whole
Budget exercise is conducted in purdah lest an indiscretion benefit some
person or group. The so-called ''Wise Men'' embody a device designed to
offer the Chancellor disinterested advice, and if he cannot debate it in
public at least everyone is party to it and ought to be the better
prepared for the real thing when it comes. In fact the Wise Men, like
similar groups in other contexts, seldom speak with one voice: economics
is not an exact science and much depends on the political assumptions of
its practitioners. In this case, however, there is a broad measure of
agreement among the advisers which will lend their opinions more weight
than usual. They do believe that there is room for tax cuts, but of a
modest nature. They agree that present fiscal policy is too tight and
should be somewhat relaxed. They do not believe, however, that cuts
should be at the expense of infrastructure expenditure, roughly one
might say that they do not want to sacrifice public investment to tax
cuts.
That should evoke support, as should two of their other agreed
positions -- that reductions which are made should be concentrated at
the lower end of the income scale, and that efforts should be made to
lower interest rates as well as reducing taxation, so that the latter
does not become the overwhelming priority. Of course they do differ on
specifics, but not as to be dramatically at odds with each other. Tax
cuts up to #5000m seem feasible, and only Professor Minford sees scope
for more, and then only over the next three years. The rest are more
circumspect, though most predict falling interest rates over the next 12
months and none thinks they will rise. Interestingly, they do not appear
to be much concerned about reducing public borrowing significantly
(though they recognise that it will exceed earlier estimates, and that
worries some of them who feel that cuts should only be financed by lower
public spending). The Chancellor will be grateful for that -- it is
perfectly possible to reduce one's revenue base while still borrowing
since the expectation of growth will right the borrowing anyway.
On the whole the assumptions behind this advice are basically
optimistic, and corroborate the ideas also advanced yesterday by the
London Business School which believes that the present slowdown in the
economy is not likely to be sustained and that the flexible labour
market will be enough to prevent worries about inflation enjoying much
substance. That optimism is in spite of anticipating a continuing fall
in unemployment, if not to below the psychologically important two
million mark.
What this means is that Kenneth Clarke has far more room for manoeuvre
than has hitherto been supposed. He would be imprudent to use it all up
by tax reductions -- indeed they would be counterproductive and almost
certainly provoke a hostile reaction. On the other hand he does have
room to take many people out of the income tax net altogether, to widen
the 20p band, and go some way to restoring personal allowances. He
certainly can consider options -- good news for the Scotch
whisky-makers, and home buyers hoping for the abolition of stamp duty on
house purchase? With some compensating increases in the odd insensitive
area, if such can be thought to exist. The outcome is likely to be close
to what the Chancellor might like and he can always sound less partisan
by saying that the Wise Men told him so.

THE City was surprised by an unexpectedly large underlying drop of
$186m in Britain's foreign currency reserves last month. In September
the reserves had risen by $128m, and there were expectations that
October would produce a $25m increase.
Most analysts concluded that the Bank of England had been engaged in
covert support of sterling when it came under pressure against the
German mark late last month.
The Bank may have bought pounds with its currency reserves when
sterling fell to within a whisker of its all-time low of DM2.1755 on
October 23.
The pound suffered in the wake of September's gilt auction, which was
the first not to be fully covered by bids for the #3000m of stock on
offer from the Bank of England.
But the main cause of the currency's weakness was the dollar, which
lost ground to the German mark ahead of the referendum in Quebec amid
fresh concerns about America's twin trade and budget deficits and the
stability of the Mexican peso.
Sterling's trade weighted index hit 83.5 on October 23 within shouting
distance of its all-time low of 82.7 on May 9.
But it has recovered steadily since then as the dollar has come back
into favour, especially since Quebec narrowly rejected independence, and
the mark has been knocked off its perch.
The October gilt auction was well covered, and the Bank of England is
thought to have sold over a billion pounds of gilts in the last week.
The pound enjoyed another good day yesterday on the back of further
gains in the dollar. Its trade weighted index gained 0.3 to 84.5, still
about 4.5% below its value at the start of the year.
Sterling made ground against both the dollar, where it added 0.40
cents to $1.5815, and the mark, where a 0.97 pfennig advance took it to
DM2.2429.
At least one pundit was sceptical about Bank of England intervention
to support sterling last month. Standard Chartered's Nick Parsons said:
''It's tempting to put two and two together to get five, but I doubt
very much if the authorities would want to be seen dabbling in the
exchange rate so soon before the Budget. I think it's probably best to
look elsewhere for an explanation.''
At the end of October the reserves stood at $47.35bn.

BELLWAY has joined the select few housebuilders who are looking
forward with any degree of optmism with private sector sales in the
current financial year ahead of those for 1994-95.
However, the social housing operations have seen a downturn because of
a change in Government financing for housing associations. Chairman
Kenneth Bell, who is becoming non-executive, said he does not expect
this to alter until the Government changes its policy towards social
housing.
In the year to July, Bellway raised house sales by 26% to 3813 units.
Thanks to the change in mix, turnover advanced 33% to #267m which helped
increase pre-tax profits by 21% to #34m.
Margins were held at the operating level but there was a sharp move
into interest payable because of a substantial amounts of land
purchasing pushing up the land bank by 2000 units to 14,000 plots.
North-east England remains the most profitable region.
Mr Bell said that Scotland is beginning to benefit from the
significant investment in the Central Belt in recent years.
The dividend total has been raised 10% to 7.7p covered almost three
times by earnings of 21.4p with a 5.3p final.

THE Quebec referendum result, having split people down the middle and
turned neighbour against neighbour, falls just one step short of the
apex of nationalist ambition. We certainly have a lot to learn from it,
principally that we should never sleepwalk into that sorry, embittered
condition.
On the morning after, the separatist bag was overflowing with escaping
cats. ''The ethnic vote'' was to blame for Quebec voting ''non'',
according to the provincial Premier, Jacques Parizeau. The
English-speakers, the Jews, the Eskimos . . . For ''the ethnic vote''
read ''the people who really have no right to be here''.
Suddenly, our own separatists were backing off at a rate of knots, 24
hours earlier, portentously advised Quebec to ''choose wisely today''.
Ninety-three per cent of voters turned out to ensure that they did
precisely that, though by a modest majority against division.
I was struck by a random quote in one report, attributed to a student
named Margaret Murray. She said she had come out to vote because she had
suddenly realised that she might otherwise ''wake up tomorrow morning
and find that my country has been taken away from me''.
With the surname Murray, there are no prizes for guessing which
''ethnic'' group she belonged to. Many of the Scottish settlers in the
nineteenth-century, driven from their own lands, settled in Quebec and
parts of Ontario where Gaelic-speakers and French-speakers lived side by
side, building the young Canadian nation. Was it not a higher calling to
bring these people, and all the other immigrant groups, together than it
now is to wedge them apart?
If, heaven forbid, Scotland were ever taken to the same brink, the
outcome would be the same and the majority much larger. An awful lot of
people who normally have better things to worry about would decide that
they did not want to wake up next morning and find that their country
had been taken away from them.
But why must so much zeal, malice, and distortion of argument be
devoted to confronting people with that choice, so that a corresponding
amount of energy has to be expended on countering it? What motivates the
determination to divide people in this way, so that in 100 years' time
(to accept Margaret Ewing's projection) a sufficient number of our
descendents just might be worn down, for a separate state to be
declared?
According to some commentators, the divisions within Quebec should
teach us the lesson that limited constitutional change will never
appease those who want to go the whole way. Nobody disputes that.
Fundamentalists are not interested in halfway houses, except to knock
them down.
But in most societies, including our own, fundamentalists are in the
minority. The real question, in drawing analogies between Quebec and
Scotland, is not whether devolution has killed off the separatist demand
(which it patently has not). It is whether the separatist demand would
be stronger or weaker if there had been no constitutional
decentralisation?
In the vast Canadian federation, that option is unthinkable. But it is
the closer parallel to the line which the Tories so dishonestly peddle
in the Scottish context. They claim that by ruling out all
constitutional change, they alone are true defenders of the Union.
It is a very superficial boast. For they never feel obliged to
consider the possibility that such intransigence does, in fact, pose by
far the greater threat to the Union. That, in my view, is the major
change over the past 16 years and it has come about largely as a result
of what has transpired during them. Polarising the argument, between all
or nothing, is a dangerous game played by cynics.
The Nationalists are nothing if not flexible when it comes to invoking
international parallels. In the early stages of upheaval in Central and
Eastern Europe they were forever putting down motions congratulating
obscure ethnic states on their resurrection. We don't hear much of that
now.
On the other hand, we find them last week proclaiming the virtues of
Spain as a European Union member which fights for its fisherfolk. Now it
may well be true that Spain gives a much higher priority than Britain to
the fishing industry. But that is a political fact which scarcely suits
the nationalist argument.
For whatever strength Spain has within the EU, it is derived from the
fact that it is a single country with a big voice; albeit one which has
gone to substantial lengths to devolve power to its regions and nations.
The one certainty is that if each of Spain's potential national states
had the fabled ''seat at the top table'', then none of them would punch
the same weight for its fishermen or any other vital interest.
Almost every European Union member is, to some extent, an amalgam of
nationalities. Most have separatist movements, similar to our own,
within them. Indeed, I noted that Mr Andrew Welsh will be hastening back
from a gathering of such groups in Corsica, to vote on the Nolan Report.
But contrary to all the nationalistic rhetoric, the significant
historical fact is that not one of these EU member states has broken up.
Nor, I suspect, will they. Just as in Quebec and in Scotland, all but
the fundamentalists can live quite happily with more than one identity.
And when nip comes to tuck, most of us are not prepared to wake up one
morning and find that our country has been taken away from us.

SCOTTISH Building Society has acquired 100 residential mortgage
accounts worth nearly #5m from London-based First Mortgage Securities
(FMS), bringing the total value of its loan book to #86m.
All the mortgages are on homes in Scotland, in line with the building
society's policy of only lending on properties north of Border.
The purchase of mortgages from FMS follows strong growth at the
Edinburgh-based Scottish Building Society this year.

THE mixed fortunes of different parts of the retail market are plain
to see in the half-yearly figures from Boots. Whereas demand continues
to grow in the health and beauty sector, the DIY market remains
difficult.
Group profits in the six months to September 30 rose by 4.2% at the
trading level, before exceptional items. However, at the pre-tax level
profits dropped largely due to lower sales following the disposal of the
pharmaceutical business and a higher tax charge.
While the trading environment for a number of businesses remains
difficult given what the group sees as a good overall performance, the
dividend was raised by 6.5%.
Boots The Chemists remains the star performer in the group and the
biggest profit contributor. Its earnings rose by 13.3% to #164.3m on
underlying sales growth of 4.5%.
Competition has intensified in over-the-counter medicines following a
price initiative on vitamins and minerals by Asda. However, the strength
of the Boots brand is such that despite the competitive trading
environment it has managed to increase its market share despite holding
its prices. This has involved higher marketing expenditure, up 17% to
#15m in the first half with the likelihood of a further increase in
spending ahead of the vital pre-Christmas trading period.
Cosmetics and toiletries account for just over a third of sales in
Boots The Chemists and are seen as one of the main drivers of profit
growth in the years ahead. Extra investment is taking place in new
product development to produce new brands to build on the success of No
7, Soltan and the Natural Collection.
The housing market remains depressed and as such there was no surprise
in the poor performance of the DIY businesses Do-IT-All and AG Stanley.
In addition to weak demand, Boots failed to shift as many of its surplus
retail properties as it hoped. Boots' chairman Sir Michael Angus said we
''should expect little good news from this area'' as long as the housing
market remains quiet. Boots' share of Do-It All's losses more than
doubled to #4.8m and AG Stanley's losses more than trebled to #7.6m.
Elsewhere, Halfords faced price competition and in a difficult market
its sales were flat. Profits were adversely affected by costs associated
with increasing warehouse capacity. Out-of-town superstores performed
better than the smaller High Street outlets.
Children's World reported higher sales helped by four new store
openings but profitability was held back by store development costs. A
further five stores are planned to open in the second half.
Boots Opticians outperformed the market in terms of sales growth at
21% helped by the opening of larger practices. Profits rose sharply to
#4.1m against #1.1m previously. Sales grew in Boots Healthcare
International and Boots Contract Manufacturing but profitability in both
divisions was held back by higher spending on investment in a number of
areas. Six new packing lines for toiletries are being installed at
Airdrie and Beeston.
The City was disappointed that there were no dates given for another
possible share buy-back despite the healthy cash position. Deputy
chairman and chief executive Lord Blyth said he would rather spend the
money on making appropriate acquisitions such as a German OTC medicines
business or by
investing in its property portfolio. The shares dropped 11p to 540p.

<TEXT>
Washington, Thursday -- The US Government last night announced a
criminal indictment of Daiwa Bank for hiding massive trading losses,
with potential fines of $1100m, and ordered the giant Japanese bank to
shut its doors in the United States.
The bank, which allegedly concealed the losses from US banking
regulators at the highest levels, was charged in the indictment with
conspiracy to defraud the Federal Reserve.
Banking regulators ordered the bank to close up shop in the United
States by February 2, saying the bank violated the law due to unsafe and
unsound banking practices.
The order from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Desposit
Insurance Corporation., the New York State Banking Department and
regulators in five other states affects all the operations of Daiwa and
its US branches, agencies and offices in 11 states.
''The agencies have taken these actions on the basis of information
indicating that Daiwa and The Daiwa Bank Trust Company and their
officials engaged in a pattern of unsafe and unsound banking practices
and violations of law over an extended period of time that are most
serious in nature,'' the order said.
The indictment and order stem from a scandal that erupted in September
after the bank disclosed that a trader, Toshihide Iguchi, at its New
York branch had hidden $1100m in losses of US Treasury securities over
11 years.
The indictment said senior Daiwa managers ''directed that those losses
be concealed'' from US regulators and deceived bank examiners about its
trading activities.
Daiwa Bank, calling the indictment ''regrettable and unfortunate'' in
a statement, said it plans to fight the criminal charges.

SHELL'S profits growth is slowing, with third-quarter net income up
29% at #1053m, bringing the nine-month total to #3607m, a rise of 49%.
Exploration and production earnings were flat in the third quarter,
with lower crude prices offset by continued volume growth. The spot
price for Brent Blend averaged $16.15 a barrel, against $16.70 in the
comparable period. Production was up 4%, with increases in Nigeria, the
UK, Oman, and Gabon offsetting a decline in Colombia because of a
disposal.
The upturn in the quarter came from the downstream activities.
Chemicals doubled their contribution but the cyclical upturn is slowing.
Margins benefited from the weakening of sterling against the Deutschmark
and volume improved as demand firmed.
Manufacturing, marine, and marketing made 18% more at #577m. Outside
the United States, product sales were 2% higher with good increases from
most regions. Manufacturing benefited from an improved operational
performance despite broadly unchanged margins. In the US, Shell
encountered strong volume growth and was helped by stock gains.
In the Asia-Pacific region refining margins were depressed. There was
some recovery in October because of seasonal stockbuilding but this may
not last because major additions to refinery capacity are coming on
stream over the next six months.
The group yesterday said that not all its mature operations are
meeting their target of 15% return on capital and strong efforts are
being made to improve their performance.
Shell concludes that difficult trading conditions are likely to
continue, with pressure on crude prices and refining margins worldwide.
Mild weather in Europe so far this autumn will not help the trend.
The slowdown in chemicals was more than the market had expected and
Shell shares slid 16[1/2]p to 729p.

* WHINGEING customers who complain they've been sold short by the
British Gas Three Star breakdown plan may have only themselves to blame.
Despite repeated warnings from consumer watchdogs to check small print
in contracts, many still seem unfamiliar with get-out clauses when their
old boiler irrevocably packs up and they expect a free replacement.
Not that British Gas comes off scot-free. Their leaflet promoting
''carefree'' services has a fourth star -- an asterisk so faint it might
challenge Jodrell Bank.
This directs attention to ''full terms and conditions'', available
from Freepost CV 2909, Stratford upon Avon. Check-Out obtained a copy
and discovered a potentially litigious litany almost the length of a
Shakespeare sonnet.
The tragedy is that exclusions 10.1 to 10.12 and other limitations --
like terminating the contract if it suits British Gas -- are scarcely
the stuff of a Crispian Day soliloquy.
All the same, they should be carefully read, marked, learned and
inwardly digested to avoid a winter's tale of woe -- especially as it
emerged this week that service engineers are netting bonuses each time a
customer is persuaded to buy a new boiler.
Phone 0345 754754 for further information on British Gas Service
Contracts.
* WITH only 50 or so shopping days to go, look out for this sign of
the times if you're buying toys for Christmas.
The British Association of Toy Retailers is warning against
fly-by-night traders who won't be around for problem gifts returned
after the holiday.
Approved Lion Mark retailers commit themselves to high standards and
safety. High Street members include Toys R Us, Early Learning,
Children's World, Beatties, and Jolly Giant.
* HOME front ideas: darker nights are an invitation to hang a new pair
of winter curtains. If tedious hemming discourages you from making them
yourself, UHU have the solution with new Fabric Glue.
The glue forms a strong, invisible bond with a range of materials --
from cotton blends and synthetic fibres to leather and suede, made
permanent by ironing. From John Lewis, Woolworths and W H Smith, price
#1.69 for 20ml. For advice and other stockists phone 0181-847 2227.

* HARD-SELL techniques are back with a vengeance and consumers are
paying the price, according to the independent consumer guide Which?
today.
The Consumers' Association has received complaints from desperate
readers pressured into signing expensive contracts and penalised when
they tried to change their minds.
A woman asked Zenith Windows for a quote. After a representative spent
eight hours at her home she agreed to pay #11,000 for #4000 worth of
windows.
A pensioner visited by an Anglian Windows' representative signed a
contract for a #4000 porch and paid a deposit of #405 -- although she
didn't own the house and wasn't told she would need planning permission
for the work.
''Foot-in-the-door salesmen must not be allowed to continue
browbeating customers into submission,'' says Which?, urging Government
action against offenders.
* THE Craigholme fashion show at Carmichael Hall, Eastwood Theatre, on
November 7 and 8 (7.30pm start) is being supported by Baccarett,

Inventive contributions, says Clare Henry, make The Red Ribbon Show
worth a visit.
NOT another Aids show! This was my first reaction to The Red Ribbon
Art Show at Glasgow Print Studio, perhaps prompted by the knowledge that
cancer is 1000 times more common than Aids, with 10 million sufferers
worldwide or 305,220 new UK cases of cancer compared with 352 new Aids
cases per year.
Always ready to eat my hat, however, I went to 25 King Street to see
it. It is a terrific show. ''We didn't expect this calibre of
response,'' says organiser Fiona Eadie, ''but artists have been really
inspired and really generous.''
Red is of course an ideal aesthetic colour providing an instant focus.
''Put a touch of red somewhere in the picture'' has long been an easy
bit of art class advice. Some artists here such as Wiszniewski, Wilson
and Mackechnie have added red bows to existing figures' hats, hair or
jackets, tied red bows around trees, car bumpers or even, like Gonzales,
added a clever tatooed invitation, ''Kiss Me'' on his subject's arm
along with the statutory red ribbon.
But many have gone the extra mile -- or two. Alasdair Gray wanted to
paint a portrait of someone HIV positive. Jamie McTaggart volunteered
and sat for Gray on October 13, a fact inscribed in typical Lanark
lettering around the picture. McTaggart has been HIV for eight years. He
wants people to know he has suffered little; that there is hope. Gray's
portrait reflects a calm, handsome face -- not resigned but fully
accepting his situation.
On the wacky side Eveleen Wright silkscreens a cake with angels;
Cassels provides unisex underwear, ''great for clubbing''; Ferry sets
his ribbon in a wax candle as part of an illuminated sculpture; Watt
makes ceramic ribbons, big and small, so that for #3 you too can
contribute.
Bids over #25 secure a ribbon of lipstick kisses from personalities
like Joanna Lumley, but it takes offers of more than #400 for
Blackadder's watercolour fish and ribbon or Alison Watt's superb whiter
shade of pale plaster lips with their eerie, protruding red snake forked
tongue.
Donaldson takes a serious look at the shapes of the Aids virus and
blood cells via computer graphics. Ganter also goes for red on red with
her paper collage. Less obvious is Carey's hand-coloured etching, Sailor
Boy and Peacock's Greek gymnast dancing a la Isadora Duncan with
swirling ribbons.
Ruth Greer, whose major Glasgow Print Studio solo show of mythological
prints also opens on Friday, contributes one of her enigmatic,
omnipotent women conquering a maze. For Greer, the maze is a symbol for
life, the ultimate labyrinth. Complex, full of unexpected twists and
turns, finding your way out is part of the universal challenge. And, yes
the Print Studio is considering a Pink Ribbon cancer fund show next
year.
* The Red Ribbon Show, in aid of Phace West Aids Project, is on till
November 11, with an auction tonight at 7.30pm. Sealed bids can also be
left at the Print Studio.

There's something odd down on the fish farm: loyalties are tested and
there is a whiff of betrayal in the air. Allan Laing meets Ken Stott,
main player in a tale of suspicion, duplicity and gut reactions.
KEN Stott's favourite colour is blue. He tells me this because I am a
newspaper reporter and, on past experience, he knows it is the kind of
thing that newspaper reporters like to know. He is being droll. He is
good at being droll. He's also good at thinking before he speaks. This
makes for intelligent and considerate answers.
A couple of years ago, at the London launch of BBC Scotland's BAFTA
award-winning drama, Takin' Over The Asylum, a tabloid showbiz
journalist approached the Scots actor and asked for an interview. No
problem, said Stott, I'll tell you anything you want to know about the
programme.
''So where do you come from, mate?'' asked the reporter in his chirpy,
Jack-the-lad accent.
''I said I'd answer any question about the programme,'' Stott replied.
''So what age are you?'' asked the journalist.
''Sorry, I'll repeat it,'' said Stott, firmly. ''I'll tell you
anything you want to know about the programme.'' The interview came to
an abrupt end.
I'd been forewarned that Ken Stott could be a difficult person to
interview. If, by difficult, it is meant that Stott is guarded in his
replies until he gets their measure of you, then difficult he most
certainly is.
But that's not being difficult. Not really. That's just being careful,
and you can't blame the man for that. This articulate and political
actor is strongly dismissive of the popular press. He does not
understand why a newspaper should be interested in trivia like his
favourite colour or his favourite food.
For the record, his favourite food is probably not fish. Not at the
moment at least. For two months this year he was knee-deep in herring
and haddock on the remote but achingly beautiful shores of Loch Tarbert.
Scriptwriter Donna Franceschild, winner of a Royal Television Society
award for Asylum, has penned a spanking new four-part drama for BBC
Scotland, set in a West Coast fish farm.
A Mug's Game reunites many of the same team. As well as Franceschild,
there is director David Blair and actors Stott and Katie Murphy. In
Asylum, last year's startling success, Ken Stott played a double-glazing
salesman who, when he wasn't selling windows, was spinning old records
as a hospital radio disc jockey. Only, the hospital was a mental
facility and Stott's character became involved with the lives of the
patients.
It was a moving, observant, and very witty piece of work. Which was
why it won a BAFTA Best Serial award last year. Stott's acclaimed
performance has also earned him a nomination (together with Robbie
Coltrane and Bobby Carlyle) for best actor in the biennial Scottish
BAFTA Awards. The winner will be announced tomorrow..
A Mug's Game is, well, a different kettle of fish. The humour and the
social observation are still there but this time it is a tale of
personal loyalty and betrayal. It is also the story of how a community
can fracture when its source of employment disappears. It happened to
the miners. It happened to the steel workers. On the west coast of
Scotland it happened once and then happened again . . . to the fishermen
and to the fish farmers.
Stott plays McCaffrey, a kind of managerial troubleshooter sent in to
sort out the fish farm when it is taken over by a big multi-national.
The dilemma for the local population is that they do not know whether he
is going to kill it or cure it. As the series progresses, the minds of
the various characters are concentrated upon survival and how -- in
order to do just that, survive -- they have to compromise their
loyalties. It is a very bitter-sweet kind of thing.
''I suppose it's about how fragile a community can be,'' Stott
explains while preparing, with almost fastidious precision, a pot of
perfectly percolated coffee in the kitchen of the Tarbert cottage, his
temporary home for the duration of the film shoot.
''It concerns, I suppose, how people's aspirations can be affected by
influences from afar. The beauty of Donna's work is that she weaves a
very dense web. There are so many stories woven together.
''She treads a dangerous path. Some of the writing is very easy and
colloquial but there are also some quite baroque passages -- and you can
only get away with that if you introduce the right characters. You make
them safe and believable as opposed to safe and boring. That allows you
then to indulge in this more baroque style and succeed. Of course,
whether or not the actor can deliver is another question . . .''
There is no dubiety about Stott's ability to deliver. His stage
credentials are formidable. He has worked with the RSC, the Royal Court
Theatre, the National, and Alan Ayckbourn's Scarborough Productions.
Earlier this year he won the Olivier Award for best supporting actor
with his performance in Arthur Miller's Broken Glass.
His film credits include Peter Capaldi's Oscar-winning Tartan Short,
Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life, Bill Forsyth's Being Human, and
Shallow Grave, in which he appeared as the tenacious Detective McCall.
He has only recently returned from South Africa where he played a major
role in the BBC's forthcoming historical series, Rhodes.
His acting is extraordinary in that he has the rare ability to make
his characters ordinary. By that, I mean convincing. He plays, not to
the gallery, but to the conviction he has in his roles. It is a very
clever and difficult thing for an actor to achieve. Was he aware of this
singular talent?
''Well, I'm aware only in so far as I've spent my entire professional
career trying not to be afraid of appearing ugly. The key to being a
good actor is not to be afraid of being ugly and yet many actors are
afraid of being so.
''I've been lucky because I've been able to play a vast range of
different characters, in the theatre as well as in film and television.
I worry about being typecast. I lost a job because of that once. I went
for this role and they asked me what I thought about the character. I
said that I saw it as a change of direction for me. There was panic in
their eyes. They were saying to themselves: 'We don't want him
experimenting on our programme. We want him to do what he did last time.
Do what we know he can do.' I'm very mindful of that. Actors need
variety.''
Stott, born in Edinburgh, came from a family with a passion for
literature. His father was an English teacher (and eventually assistant
headmaster at Heriot's) and his mother lectured in Italian literature at
Edinburgh University. It was, he said, a very liberal background.
''I suppose I became an actor because I enjoyed entertaining. It was a
bit of a drug to me,'' he says.
He holds strong views about popular television, and guards quality
drama jealously. He is probably the last actor you would find on a soap
opera. He abhors the mundane nature of programmes like Neighbours and
Home And Away. Even Eastenders. They do nothing, he says. They encourage
people to vegetate.
''But hard-hitting drama really makes people sit up and take notice,''
he says. ''It makes people think. It has the ability to make people see
themselves -- and that is a remarkable thing.''
Hard-hitting drama is what Donna Franceschild is all about. Having
written Asylum, a series set in urban Scotland, she decided to turn her
eye to a more rural setting. She had this idea bouncing around her head
about a fish farm (God knows why). It was going to be a smaller piece, a
single drama centred on a love triangle. Then it evolved, got bigger and
bigger, and turned itself into a major series about love, betrayal,
loyalty . . . the whole damned thing.
''If I fail this time then I fail big,'' says Franceschild before
exploding into a loud, infectious laugh. ''It's got lots of strands to
it but it's really concerned with the kind of things people feel loyal
to and what it takes to make them betray that loyalty. Each of the
characters ultimately makes a choice and decides where their allegiances
lie.''
But it's more than that. It's also about what happens to a community
when you take away the things that bind it together. What do people do
when they face this social crisis? Do they stick with their mates or do
they sell them down the river?
Franceschild was born in Chicago and brought up in Southern
California. In the mid-seventies she moved to London where she met a guy
from Glasgow.
''I realised very quickly that you can go through life knowing just
one Englishman but it is impossible to know just one Scot; they always
introduce you to everyone they know,'' she says.
She took a creative-writing course at Glasgow University and has been
writing about the city ever since.''I don't really understand what I am
writing myself until I've written it,'' she continues. ''A Mug's Game,
like everything else I've done, is a leap into the dark.''
The new series, like all her work, is etched with humour. Franceschild
says she cannot help but find things funny. ''The ideas of survival and
humour go together so easily. People are at their funniest when their
backs are against the wall; that's when they make a joke because it's
their best defence against despair. And it's a particularly Scottish
trait.''
A Mug's Game reunites many of the same team who worked on Asylum, a
situation with which Franceschild is delighted. ''You're working with
people who you are used to working with. David (Blair) as a director
likes to work with enormously committed people who work well as part of
a team. He likes people who are passionately committed to what they are
doing.''

ONE of the most exciting and innovative productions to hit London this
season, Martin Duncan's feverish, surreal restaging of the 1919 German
silent film classic for the Nottingham Playhouse and Lyric Hammersmith
confirms all the arguments about joint collaborations. One theatre would
probably not have had the resources but with two involved here, Duncan's
production knocks spots off most recent London theatre-going
experiences.
Like a re-enactment of one's worst nightmare, this allegorical tale
set in a small German town, of the fairground showman/doctor whose
mental domination induces a sleep-walking patient into committing
diabolical crimes, touches all kinds of raw nerves to do with
twentieth-century manias -- serial murder, madness, mind control, and
most searingly, paternalism's psychological shading into fascism.
Power is at the centre of it -- the power of one man's mind over
others. Psycho meets Frankenstein and then some. Ken Lee's
expressionistic, Chageallesque designs, Bunty Matthias's and Annable
Haydn's dream-like choreography and the extraordinary beauty of Barry
Simner's text create an atmosphere both terrifying and laced with
macabre humour.
Matthew Kelly's psychiatric and potentially political mesmeriser
doesn't perhaps exude sufficient fiendish glitter but John Ramm's
white-faced victim brings real chill and pathos. Best of all is the
shuddering electronic music of Peter Salem (violin) and Walter Fabeck's
own invented Chromasone -- a keyboard activated by his own gloved black
hands that appear to produce music by magic since they never actually
touch the keys. A seriously gothic, prophetic encounter.

TOMMY Steele has lasted well. This protean entertainer is the sole
cast member listed in the programme of Tommy Steele -- What a Show!
supported by an ensemble, and agile and well-drilled troupe of 10
dancers. It's a celebration of the singer from Bermondsey's musical
highlights: from Little White Bull to Singing In the Rain (omitting Some
Like it Hot; perhaps the star didn't feel like dragging up for the
occasion).
And that's not all folks. If you fancy the climax of Riverdance, here
it is with our Steele gallantly standing in for Michael Flatly. Audience
participation? Of course! Both questions from the audience and communal
handjive. It's a measure of Steele's power that the show can include
items from Grease and Riverdance, while both shows are still playing in
London.
Steele is what the people have come to see, and he's generous with
both time and talent. The evening is packed with inventively staged
numbers. The Emperor's New Clothes features a charismatic member of the
ensemble Mark Petitt as a con man. Flash, Bang, Wallop, a showstopper
from Half A Sixpence now seems more risque than the original was. Steele
closes the first act as Don Quixote in the famous Windmill chase using
high-speed back projection, and the second with a series of solo songs
ending with When You've Gotta Go from the Good Old, Bad Old, Days. The
audience naturally, didn't want him to leave.

THE opening of another biographical musical, Jolson, follows a
seven-year run for Buddy which has moved to the Strand Theatre, where
they're booking the show up to the Millennium. Jolson is a lavish show,
showcasing the extraordinary singing and dancing talents of Brian
Conley; his is a larger-than-life personality, an impishly charming
performer with fine attack and a voice that could pass for Al Jolson's
any day. His physique is much nearer to that of Jolson than was Larry
Parks's, who portrayed the Broadway star into films. And Parks didn't do
his own singing either.
This stage presentation offers Jolson in a much less flattering light
than did the films -- and it's all the better for it. Sally-Ann
Triplett's Ruby Keeler is more talented and versatile than the star
she's portraying; John Bennett is authoritatively excellent as Jolson's
long-suffering manager. There's a zippy supporting chorus to interpret
Tudor Davies's scintillating dance routines. A well-drilled orchestra
plays the (largely inauthentic-sounding) arrangements. The script, by
Rob Bettinson and Francis Essex, is several degrees better than that for
most other biographical shows. The sets and costumes are attractive and
lavish. Yet the show belongs to Brian Conley: this accomplished
singer/actor has found a role that suits him supremely well. Jolson
could prove to be a very popular show and it's at exactly the right
theatre.

FIRST there was the tacky Aussie soap, which begat the cult, and has
now spawned the musical with drag diva Lily Savage, Glasgow's very own
Terry Neason, and Maggie Kirkpatrick as ''The Freak'' -- the butch
warden everyone loves to hate -- all the way from Down Under to lend a
touch of authenticity.
Not that authentic is exactly what Cell Block H is after (though in
every other respect the series' distinctive features have been
replicated, even down to the wobbly sets, with loving fidelity). Parody
is queen here -- and who better than Lily Savage, the Liverpool ''lass''
with legs to die for, a peroxide wig down to her shoulders and a
scatter-gun for a mouth.
In fact, though Lily has her moments, she's less outrageous than one
might have expected. Prison bars don't seem to be the only thing
constraining her in what is, after all, just another form of panto with
Kirkpatrick as the villainous Ugly Sister, Lily as Cinders and Prince
Charming all rolled into one and a chorus of denim-clad prisoners to
provide thump and boogie.
The art of the enjoyable here is to sit back and let it all wash over
you, tastelessness and all. Neason particularly is in terrific form as
''top dog'' bringing the house down with a brilliant romantic ballad
send-up, I Never Told Him I Loved Him.
The truth is, though, the joy of Prisoner on the telly is it doesn't
know how bad it is. On stage the effort of achieving second-rateness is
there for all to see. Not, I suspect, that it will put the cultists off
one jot, judging by the length of the queue to shake the hands with
their heroines.

WHILE the world and his wife crams in to see Lloyd Webber at the
Playhouse, the Brunton Theatre Company is roving about East Lothian with
a rather less elaborate musical offering. Neil Simon's comedy is based
on the relationship between the show's own song-writing team of Marvin
Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager, and involves nothing more than two
performers, a grand piano, and a handful of songs.
Even with Malcolm Murray's giant keyboard of a set, the budget must be
in the region of the drinks bill for the Phantom's first-night party,
but that's not to say the Brunton doesn't give value for money. There's
an appealing simplicity about two people breaking into song round the
piano, no amplification, no big dance numbers, no razzmatazz.
That said, the venue's terrible acoustic and unsympathetic head-on
staging doesn't do any favours; I suspect some of Simon's witty
one-liners could be better placed by the actors, as many go unheard.
Oddly for a musical director, David Goodall, in the composer role,
demonstrates a vocal range somewhere between Phil Oakey and Ringo Starr,
his performance getting by primarily on the strength of his have-a-go
enthusiasm. The big tunes are carried considerably more effectively by a
feisty Maria Miller, as the lyric writer, who is getting her lungs into
shape for the title role in Cinderella at the Edinburgh King's. Her
emotional outburst in the middle of the second act is a real
showstopper.
Directed by Robin Peoples, the show is as slight as it is
light-hearted; the songs aren't brilliant, but like the script, they're
carried with enough charm to hold the audience through to the happy
ending.

DESPITE the assertion of colleague Mary Brennan in a dance review
earlier this week (not to mention 10 days of previews), this was the
official beginning of the panto season. Extending the usual run of such
things to an epic six months, Cameron Mackintosh has brought north a
visual treat for grown-ups which is technical highly impressive, but
never overly showy.
Predictably the swathes of drapery, lavish false proscenium arch,
superb lighting, quite astonishing sound design, and, of course, Lot
666: The Chandelier (the appearance of which caused a ripple of
understandably nervous coughing in the stalls) tends to steal the show,
the Gothic wonderland does not entirely overshadow the cast. Soprano
Nicky Adams as Christine is a real talent with a quite superb voice and
a stage presence that embraces you across the footlights. Andrew
Halliday's Raoul is not far behind and look out for Amanda Light in the
smaller role of Meg Giry. The choreography is attractive and the dancers
are first rate.
Personally, I couldn't take to Phantom Mark McKerracher's voice but
the real problem with his performance -- and that of Dorte Holst as the
diva Carlotta -- is that it is not sufficiently over the top. You long
for them to play the piece as the pantomime it is. But that's probably
not the fault of the performers. The trouble with Phantom is that it
takes itself too seriously. For all the pastiche of opera in book and
lyrics (Richard Stilgoe and Charles Hart), Lloyd Webber is in
showing-off mode for much of the time, with part songs and counterpoint
all over the shop. Shame that the only really memorable tune is that
irritating chromatic run from the title song.

THERE was nothing particularly inscrutable about conductor En Shao in
the first half of last night's concert in memory of Sir Alexander
Gibson, given by the student orchestra of the RSAMD. In fact, in the
first half, the Chinese conductor was all too scrutable.
Dodgy performances of Benjamin Britten's Young Person's Guide to the
Orchestra and Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto could only make you
wonder just how well En Shao actually knew the pieces. The most critical
thing that could be said about the orchestra is that, in this half, they
actually sounded like a student orchestra; and not a very good one.
You could hear the potentially fine playing, and know from previous
experience of the band (even given the shifting nature of its personnel)
that they play better than this. Ensemble was tentative, tenuous at
times, and very edgy. Intonation was often scratchy and lacked
confidence. Everything pointed to a lack of shape, of clear and sure
direction.
OK they got through it all; the real shame was that a better
accompaniment wasn't given to pianist Polina Chersonskaja, whose playing
of the Prokofiev concerto was extremely stylish, perhaps lacking just
that last touch of metallic brilliance, but sure-footed, polished,
poetic (at appropriate moments), and delivered with not a little
panache.
The change in atmosphere and delivery in the second half was nothing
short of dramatic. Conductor En Shao evidently knew Rachmaninov's Second
Symphony better than the other pieces. And the Academy Orchestra,
transformed into an ensemble of depth, richness of sound, and real
emotional weight, played with flair and intensity; red-blooded playing
from red-blooded youngsters; just what we should have been hearing all
night. See conductors?

BEETHOVEN called his eighth symphony the ''little one'', but nobody
should call it lightweight. As if to prove the point, Walter Weller gave
it the entire second half of his programme with the Royal SNO last
night, but what he sought to achieve through breadth of utterance might
have been more strikingly achieved through tension and ferocity.
It was, to some extent, an opportunity missed. Thick accents, lavish
string tone, and a wealth of pauses and slow-ups tended to get in the
way of what is, or should be, Beethoven's most volatile symphony. The
result was svelte, flowing, filled with fine detail, but it was a study
in Viennese polish with none of the neurosis that lies behind the abrupt
chords and sforzati with which the first movement, in particular, is
peppered.
Large-scale, too, were the performances that filled the rest of this
entirely Viennese programme. Schubert's fifth symphony with six double
basses is bound to tread somewhat heavily, and so it did in an
interpretation that had little spring to its rhythms. Yet once again
there was some loving interplay of string and woodwind tone, with the
main theme of the slow movement scrupulously phrased, in a way it isn't
always.
This, as we have come to recognise, is the Weller style, which is very
different from the Harnoncourt style or the Rattle style, but which paid
off in the courteous account of Mozart's C major piano concerto, K467,
that formed the evening's centrepiece. Though Andreas Haefliger, the
young Swiss soloist, might have preferred a more intimate accompaniment
to his alert, spruce playing, he never ceased to show his quick
responsiveness to Mozart's harmonic twists and turns. Here, moreover,
Weller's use of a big body of strings did enable him to bring a hushed
richness to the slow movement that was very beautiful.

THE best thing -- the worst thing -- about illusions is quite simply
that they aren't real. When you try to tie the vision down in satin or
sackcloth, or more particularly in flesh and blood, you find it just
won't sustain all the things you crave of it. It's as if fantasy and
reality are two different life forms that breathe antagonistic
atmospheres. Some people, however, never give up trying to make their
fantasies tangible, and it's two such doyens of excess -- Gilles de Rais
and King Ludwig II of Bavaria -- whom Lawrence Steger conjures up in The
Swans.
Gilles, you'll recall, was Marshal of France under Joan of Arc. What
you might not know is that he had a lust for brutalising and murdering
children, as well as the wealth to indulge that lust. By comparison,
Ludwig's excesses were almost benign: he exhausted the Treasury to
create a personal backdrop of palaces where he could make-believe his
life as king . . . King Louis XIV of France, usually.
Steger and his team offer us glimpses of their compulsions but, of
course, none of it can be for real. It can be a heady flourish of
Baroque theatricality (complete with marvellous mechanical scenery), it
can be a grainy film image or hectic words describing what isn't there
-- we will collude with the illusion, not least because the presentation
is intriguing, humourous, camp and deliciously wilful -- not unlike
Steger's own performance as Ludwig.
But -- as Gilles and Ludwig knew all too well -- the thrill dies in
the moment of recognition. In fact, Steger ruptures the bubble for us,
stage managing the end in yet another moment of apparent reality in a
clever mesh of false perspectives and true deceptions. A very merry
puzzle, indeed -- it runs until tomorrow.

MINISTERS next week will step up the fight against #3bn-a-year benefit
fraud with a large-scale computer crackdown on fraudsters. Technology is
to be used to track down criminals as the latest move in a crusade
against levels of fraud estimated to cost the equivalent of 3p on income
tax. The Government is poised to unveil the largest social security
computer matching system in Europe -- and ultimately the world -- to
cross-check claims made for the three main benefits.
COMPENSATION payments totalling #122m have been paid out by the
Ministry of Defence over the past five years, Armed Forces Minister
Nicholas Soames disclosed last night. The figure of #57m for 1994-95
included #35m paid out to ex-Servicewomen following a European Court
ruling that they had been unjustifiably sacked for becoming pregnant.
OVERSEAS Development Minister Baroness Chalker yesterday refused to
condemn some supermarket chains over big cuts in the cost of bananas,
amid fears that the economies of banana-producing Caribbean countries
would be harmed. Lady Chalker insisted in the Lords that the retail
price of the fruit was a ''commercial matter for the supermarkets
themselves''.
A LABOUR MP yesterday protested that the Prime Minister falsely had
accused him of being a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
Mr David Winnick (Walsall North) demanded in a point of order that Mr
Major should come to the Commons and correct the mistake. Replying,
Speaker Betty Boothroyd urged MPs to ensure they had their facts right
before making accusations across the floor of the Chamber. Mr Winnick
said: ''Just because he's the Prime Minister, surely that doesn't mean
he shouldn't come and correct a falsehood which he made to the House --
inadvertently.''

Remember, remember, the potential dangers of Bonfire Night. Alison
Kerr has some timely advice.
ACCORDING to the Department of Trade and Industry's bizarre way of
operating, if you haven't organised your fireworks display by
Hallowe'en, it's your own fault if you have an accident.
The DTI publishes a free leaflet on firework safety, and to obtain a
copy all you need to do is phone their publications office. When The
Herald phoned for its copy of the pamphlet, it was told that it would
take between five and seven days to arrive -- too late for bonfire
night.
Luckily, a local fireworks shop came to the rescue. Ablaze of Glory
(01505 61305) sells display quality fireworks for private use. They had
a copy of the DTI sheet as well as their own safety tips which are
specifically geared towards firework displays. So, for those who can't
get hold of the DTI's leaflet before next week, here are the
recommendations.
Plan ahead. Make sure that you have a big enough space for your chosen
firework display. Check individual fireworks boxes for the distance from
the display at which spectators should stand. Be aware too, of overhead
obstacles like telephone wires.
* Only buy products that meet the British Standard. These are branded
with the code BS7114.
* Keep fireworks in a closed box, somewhere cool and dry and
preferably locked away.
* Have a bucket of water on hand to plunge sparklers into once they're
finished, and never go back to a firework that hasn't gone off -- it
could still be live. At the end of the night, go back and douse it with
water, then bury it in the ground.
* Keep pets indoors with the curtains closed.
* Don't take any alcohol until after the display.
* Wear DIY safety glasses to protect your eyes and wear gloves when
lighting or holding a sparkler.
* Never give a sparkler to a child under five, and never let a child
light a firework.
* Always read the instructions carefully before lighting a firework
(and don't read them near any naked flame): remember that different
fireworks mean different dangers.
* When lighting a firework, keep it at arm's length and use a taper
rather than a match so that it lights first time.
* Remember that it is a criminal offence to throw a firework in a
street or a public place. The maximum penalty is a #5000 fine.

Once they were God slots, now they sell soup. Deedee Cuddihy
rediscovers vending machines.
THE smokers among us, even the reformed ones, may have memories of
those dear old days when, dying for a fag after the shops had long since
shut, you'd trudge out to the nearest cigarette machine not knowing if
you'd return home empty-handed or, joy of joys, with pockets overflowing
because the machine had gone ballistic and spewed its entire contents on
to the pavement.
Well, you always feel nostalgic when an anniversary comes round and
1995, according to the Automatic Vending Association of Britain, is the
100th anniversary of the vending machine.
The centenary was marked in fine style recently when the world's
largest vending exhibition was held in Manchester.
Strictly speaking it was the Greek mathematician Hero who developed
the first vending machine when, in 215BC, he invented a coin-operated
holy-water dispenser for use in Egyptian temples.
Londoners could buy postcards and writing paper from a machine as
early as 1883. But it wasn't until 1888, when machines selling Tutti
Frutti chewing-gum were installed on railway station platforms in New
York city, that the full potential of the ''silent salesman'' as vending
machines are known in the trade, became apparent.
Seven years later, in 1895, the first drinks vending machine to appear
in the UK was launched at an exhibition and the rest, as they say, is
history. A history of eagerly anticipated hot chocolate which turned out
to be nothing more than hot water and of ice-cold Pepsi which
disappeared into the bowels of the machine when a cup failed to
materialise.
That was in the old days, of course. Now, vending companies claim that
the efficiency of their machines has improved to such an extent that
''it has become a rarity to find a machine that is not working''.
Try telling that to the people who use Buchanan Bus Station in
Glasgow. On the first of two visits there, I found that not one of the
six vending machines located on the main concourse was in working order.
Happily, other vending machines in Glasgow performed much better than
the ones at the bus station. In fact, they all delivered just what they
were supposed to.
At the Western Infirmary, in phase one beside the dining-room, where
pie and beans (to be microwaved in an adjacent machine), chicken tikka
sandwiches, and yoghurt with fruit jam were also on offer, I tried
something called Espreschoc from the hi-tech hot drinks machine. This
turned out to be a powerful -- especially at 9.30am -- but delicious
combination of strong coffee and hot chocolate.
Glasgow University's Queen Margaret Union has six large vending
machines for drinks and snacks plus a cigarette machine and smaller,
wall-mounted machines which dispense jelly beans, mini chocolate eggs,
pistachio nuts, cashews and mint-flavoured condoms.
Staff say the machines work well ''unless people don't use them
properly''.
My impressively named supreme of tomato soup was speedily delivered
and hot, but low on flavour.
The drinks machine at North Woodside baths was in perfect working
order and served up a surprisingly decent cup of hot chocolate.
The Rennies and Aspro vending points in the ladies toliet of Queen
Street station were empty but the #1 disposable toothbrush and
toothpaste machine was functioning and swiftly dispensed its
outrageously over-priced product.
A toy vending machine on the street which promised impressive kids'
jewellery and even a watch for 20p, coughed out only the tiniest of
rings, hardly big enough to fit a baby.
Meanwhile, the bus station seemed to have got its vending act together
-- almost. On a second visit, five of the six machines were working but
the hot chocolate, I have to report, wasn't nearly as good as the stuff
at North Woodside baths.
Britain's vending machine industry is already worth more than #1000m a
year but those involved in the business want to see it grow bigger.
Young people will be one of the biggest targets, especially now that
vending using special cards rather than cash is on the way.
According to the AVAB, ''The most enthusiastic users of vending
machines are the young who buy on impulse and have been brought up in an
age of user-friendly machines and the cashcard.
''Consumers with cards,'' say the association, ''don't feel they're
spending money so there's less inhibition about giving in to impulse.
More impulse and less inhibition adds up to nearly doubling the
automatic-vending opportunity.''
Two of the first drinks vending machines to appear in Scotland between
the wars belong to the owner of a well-known soft-drink business in
Fife. They proved so unreliable, however, that according to his son, Ian
Plumber, he vowed never to use a vending machine again.
That didn't deter the younger Plumber who, along with ''two pals'',
went on to found the City Vending Company in the 1960s. It's now one of
the biggest vending firms in Britain and, at Heathrow Airport has
machines which dispense everything from miniature teddy bears, ''one of
our biggest sellers'' -- to haggis and neeps in the British Airways
staff canteen.
Plumber, as chairman of the AVAB's Scottish branch, said he was sorry
to hear about the vending problems at Buchanan Bus Station although he
was quick to point out that the machines weren't his.
But he told me that I shouldn't blame vending technology. ''It's so
advanced these days that it's more likely to be the human element that's
at fault.''

Copenhagen, Thursday,
TWO teachers felt sorry that two of their wildest pupils had been
barred from a summer camp, so they arranged for a prostitute to cheer
them up, it was reported today.
The teachers, who were not named, paid a prostitute #60 to have sex
with the boys, both aged 17, on the back seat of a school bus, the
Danish daily BT reported. The money had come from the boys themselves,
it said.
The teachers described the prostitute as ''a consolation'' for the
boys, who were among about 20 delinquents who attend special classes at
a private school in Funen county, in central Denmark.
The teachers resigned after the authorities learned about the
incident, the report said. The boys were not identified.
Danish law allows the purchase of sexual services by anybody 16 or
older.--AP.

Christopher Holme and Calum MacDonald report that after a shakey first
year, Scot FM faces its toughest battle yet.
IF IT is the fate of most fledgling radio stations to flounder in the
first year of life, Scot FM has done more than its fair share of
waddling.
It landed as a fragile bird on a dockside nest at Leith in September
last year and, variously plucked of presenters, trussed by internal
dissent and seasonally stuffed by its critics, it remains an
aesthetically-challenged duckling.
Grampian Television is now faced with the challenge of turning it into
a swan, after the departure of managing director Tom Hunter.
Commercial radio based in the east of Scotland has a history of
teething problems. Radio Forth had a disastrous launch in the 1970s
during an era when competition was virtually non-existent, running up
debts of #300,000 in its first year.
NorthSound in Aberdeen, despite a talented crew of journalists and
presenters which has since provided a rich source for television and
newspapers, failed to make any major impact in its initial months.
Ultimately its credibility was established by coverage of a fierce
blizzard and the success of Aberdeen FC in the early 1980s. NorthSound
now sponsors the football club, but ironically, cannot carry live
broadcasts of the games since it lost out to Scot FM's successful bid.
Scot FM broadcasts do not reach listeners in the North-east, but
reports of the station's difficulties evidently did which is why Hunter
was called to the Aberdeen meeting that led to his departure.
Grampian Television, which now has a 95% stake in Scot FM, yesterday
dismissed rumoured monthly losses of #90,000 and an overdraft of
#600,000 as ''well wide of the mark''.
A Grampian spokesman said the station was still ''on track'' to reach
a position of profitable trading in the near future but admitted that
losses in its first year had exceeded #400,000.
''We had budgeted to lose money; in the radio business you have to
speculate to accumulate,'' he said.
Other observers are less optimistic. Sara Maclean, deputy media
director at Faulds Advertising, said the likelihood of meeting the
break-even target by next September was extremely remote.
''It cannot get much worse for them. I think it is possible to turn
the station around but it is going to take an awful lot of work.
''It is important for Grampian to sit back and see why things have
gone wrong, but you also have to remember that this is probably the
toughest market place for radio anywhere in the UK,'' she said.
That catalogue of disasters is now familiar: failure to establish its
own identity either in the mass market alongside Clyde and Forth or a
high-quality niche; constant and highly-publicised turnover of key
staff; and lack of effective promotion at the outset.
Maclean said the obsession with instant fixes to boost ratings had
obscured long-term problems to develop its own presenters and invest in
editorial.
''They need something more than football. What they have to create is
something which is invaluable to me as an advertiser and a station that
attracts young up-market listeners,'' she added.
Even in the ratings game, Scot FM did not shine. Border Television,
one of the original investors, pulled out in May and sold its stake to
Grampian. Border's other station Century in Newcastle, started out at
the same time and has consistently outperformed Scot FM in reaching its
listenership.
One former presenter at the station, Alex Horsburgh, said he believed
Hunter's demise was fully merited. ''He came up here to kick arse, and
now he's got his arse kicked.
''It's a triumph for traditional Scottish attitudes. He thought he was
coming into a village mentality to wield the big stick, but it has
backfired badly on him.''
Interim MD, Bob Christie said yesterday there would be no undue haste
to appoint a successor.
''There will be no knee-jerk reaction. We will take our time. The
appointment could be internal or external, but there will be no rush,''
he said.
''I am here to provide management input and support for a station
which is making steady progress, both in terms of listening figures and
income. The football contract has given us a big leg-up, and we will be
recruiting extra journalists and sales staff,'' Christie added.
Richard Andrews, an analyst with Edinburgh stockbrokers Bell Lawrie
and White, shares this guarded optimism. ''Its revenues are quite
healthy at the moment and its share of listening is growing,'' he said.
Whether Scot FM turns out to be a dead duck, a beautiful swan, or a
phoenix rising from the ashes, it will have to act quickly.
Alistair Darling, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, said it was now on
its last chance to keep its franchise application promise for
high-quality speech output.
''If the station doesn't honour its obligations, I for one will be
asking the Radio Authority to look again at its licence.
''Those who run it really have to get a grip, otherwise I strongly
believe that the Radio Authority will have to intervene and issue them
with a final warning. If that doesn't work the authority should cancel
the franchise and give it to someone else.''

SMILE AND SNARL : A CAMPAIGN
In presenting his personal manifesto for a real consumers' charter,
Calum Macdonald advocates the schizophrenic approach. He has seen the
future and it works! No more Mr Nice Guy when the service received
leaves a lot to be desired -- but enter Mr Really Nice Guy with heaps of
praise in response to quality treatment.
MY WIFE frequently relates the following tale of life in the US of A:
on a business trip to Houston, Texas, she was divided between the choice
of two dinner dishes. Sensing her dilemma, the waiter intervened:
''Since you're a visitor, why don't we make you up a special sampler?''
She duly received helpings of both duck gumbo and crawfish etouffe,
which did nothing for her waistline, but left a lasting impression of
real hospitality.
On the other hand, a friend recalls a rather different anecdote of
downtown Scotland; in tourist-orientated St Andrews, to be precise. He
wanted to eat a sausage in a bun. Both were on the cafe menu, but as
separate items. The waitress, however, could not meet his demand until
our hungry friend ordered a full breakfast and an empty sandwich,
discarded the unnecessary ingredients and, triumphantly, ate his sausage
in a bun. He was poorer, but his point was made.
The comparison is instructive. Despite the virtual disappearance of
heavy industry, and the growth of tourism to become our biggest
employer, Scotland's service sector is, quite frankly, appalling.
Yes, I know, the Scottish Tourist Board is doing its bit, and
individual suppliers can boast excellence and genuine quality but, as a
nation, we still cannot bring ourselves to embrace the concept of
satisfying a customer, and taking money as our reward.
Perhaps it is because service feels too much like a throwback to
feudalism; perhaps we inherently lack the entrepreneurial spirit which
embodies the American Dream; perhaps we have too strong an addiction to
the welfare support blanket as a safer option than risk-taking; or
perhaps we are just bloody lazy.
But, surely, it doesn't have to be this way. I have never been to
America, but I have seen the future, and it works.
Back in late August, we decided to sell our home in Glasgow quickly
because my wife was about to start a new job, working long hours, in
Edinburgh. I set myself deadlines which, effectively, meant preparing
the house for the market in 10 days.
The response from estate agents, architects, council planners,
builders, electricians, plasterers, gardeners, cleaners, varied from
extremely helpful to downright obstructive.
But after the latter category had been cajoled or whipped into line,
the Timetable from Hell was met and, a further nine days later, we had
attained a very acceptable price for our home.
The process was physically and emotionally draining and, as a
strategy, I would recommend it only in extreme circumstances. However,
the experience confirmed a theory I have long held, albeit in sketchy
form. In 1995, and for ever more, the consumer is king (or queen).
Margaret Thatcher, most Scots agree, was no friend to our country. But
while her legacy pivoted on a ''Me'' culture which is now seen by most
of the nation as a busted flush, it also included the seeds of positive
change, seeds which are now being nurtured by the PM-in-waiting, Tony
Blair.
Both Thatcher and Blair believe, above everything else, in the market
economy. Or put another way: if the world doesn't want our products, we
must change the widgets we make, and sell our services differently.
Which is where we go back to the US, and consumer empowerment.
It is a truth almost universally acknowledged that Britain currently
has too few leaders in the global market-place. British Airways and
Marks &amp; Spencer have made it; BT is coming up fast on the outside; and
scores of smaller operations have recently adopted such concepts as
charter marks and total quality management. They are no doubt encouraged
by the seeming omnipresence in our life of such American landmarks as
McDonald's and Coca-Cola.
But we also lag behind much of the Western world in consumerism. The
best-known examples of consumer support in the UK -- That's Life,
Watchdog, Which? -- all start from a negative position of defence. They
champion the underdog, right wrongs, and expose do-badders.
Instead of following the US example slavishly, and becoming a country
where every minor fault results in big-time litigation, why not adopt a
different tack altogether? I would suggest that a more constructive
philosophy is the one I now find myself using: Smile and Snarl.
The table spells out the details. But I also have some concrete
examples to prove the philosophy works in practice:
* Smile -- I sent a letter of congratulation to ScotRail when a
station-master went out of his way to meet my wife off a train and
explain that I was running late.
* Smile -- I ended up apologising to a bus driver whose rather hasty
manoeuvring caused me to bang my head on the vehicle stairwell as I
tried to get off. He was very worried, but I assured him that accidents
happen, and I was not badly hurt.
* Snarl -- I wrung an apology and several hundreds of pounds out of a
leading bank (no name, it's now a reformed organisation) when its
computers made me appear to be a fraudulent user of my Visa card.
* Snarl -- I forced suitable compensation out of a leading drinks
company when one of its products exploded in our fridge, damaging other
goods.
Of course, the genesis of my philosophy is not unique. For decades,
both seller and buyer have muttered the mantra: ''The customer is always
right, even when he's wrong.''
Superficially, this strategy may sound similar to mine, but it
actually differs in two fundamental ways.
First, the customer is not always right. If a purchaser enters a shop
and offers 1p for a #1000 suite, he will not be allowed to buy it at
that price.
Secondly, and more to the point, adopting that mantra leaves power
with the seller, to exercise as he sees fit. The customer may hope he
will be treated well, but cannot depend on it. With Smile and Snarl,
power remains firmly with the consumer.
The single biggest strength of my philosophy is that it transcends
almost every social and political divide. Consumer empowerment is
already an issue for such groups as the Scottish (and UK) Consumer
Council, the Consumers' Association, Jack Jones's 1.5 million-strong
National Pensioners' Convention, and the Grey Panthers in the US.
Like them, I am fast becoming sceptical about the worth of our archaic
political system, and the time wasted at Westminster. More and more,
consumers do not need to be represented, and can assume power for
themselves.
Technology (as suggested by Tony Blair at the Labour Party conference)
would enable instant referendums on any controversial issue;
proportional representation would ensure a wide spread of views could be
heard; and both of the above could eliminate the need for many of our
expensive, and often ineffectual, MPs.
But consumer empowerment is an apolitical matter. None of the above
needs to happen. We must all simply Smile and Snarl to get our way and
-- along the way -- equip this country to become a nation of quality
service. And proud of it.
TEN STEPS TO A BETTER SERVICE
1 -- ALWAYS buy the best quality item/service you can afford. Cheap
alternatives may work, but will probably prove a false economy in the
long run. If you want the impossible done yesterday, make it clear that
you are prepared to pay above the going rate.
2 -- DO not be intimidated by the service supplier; remember, the
customer is king.
3 -- HOWEVER, allow the supplier to do his/her job professionally;
smile politely, and let the supplier suggest the best item or approach
to a task.
4 -- IF you disagree, or are not happy with the manner of the
supplier, calmly ask to be referred upwards to a more senior member of
staff.
5 -- KEEP smiling, and see if the boss can repair the damage done.
6 -- IF NOT, either snarl, or -- if there is an alternative supplier
-- go elsewhere.
7 -- NEVER snarl until you're talking to a decision-making member of
staff; it is pointless, and unfair to the junior employee, who is
probably only following rules.
8 -- ONCE the sale/strategy is agreed, don't be afraid to insist that
it is followed to the letter. Complain early, rather than later.
9 -- IF YOU are forced into more serious action, attack where the
supplier is weakest, ie if supplier promises speed, threaten to expose
publicly a lack of speed.
10 -- BUT if you are happy with the sale/service, call or write and
say so, singling out individual staff members who have been particularly
helpful. And both use that company again, and sing their praises to your
friends and family.

A memorial cairn to the Lockerbie disaster is dedicated in Washington
today, but while the world waits and wonders if there will ever be
answers to the troubling questions surrounding the bombing, Pamela Dix
reports how the sister of a PanAm 103 stewardess has made it her mission
to uncover the truth.
TODAY President Clinton is being presented with a memorial cairn at
Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, in memory of the 270 people
who died when PanAm 103 was blown up over Lockerbie on December 21,
1988. Sir Hector Munro, MP for Dumfries, will make the presentation. For
many of the bereaved, this will be a fitting way to remember that
appalling loss of life nearly seven years ago. The memorial was planned
by American relatives who have given their time and energy to raising
the $290,000 required to fund the cairn and the dedication ceremony,
which British relatives will be attending.
There are some dissenting voices, however, and the strongest is that
of Marina de Larrakoetxea, a Basque woman whose sister Maria Nieves was
a stewardess aboard PanAm 103, says the memorial demonstrates ''the
hypocrisy of the US administration in manipulating the truth and
obscuring justice, while inundating the public with rhetoric and
sympathy''. For her it is not a tribute but an insult to the dead, and
she has done all that she could to stop it.
For Larrakoetxea life since the Lockerbie disaster has been a resolute
fight to find the truth of what happened. For her, the unanswered
questions are many. What was the motivation for the bombing? How did the
bomb suitcase get on the plane? Why were some people warned not to
travel, and others not given that opportunity? Why was the precise
intelligence information received prior to the bombing not sufficient to
stop it? What exactly went wrong in the confusion of the immediate
aftermath? Why has there been an apparent cover-up at the highest levels
of government to obscure what happened before the bombing took place?
Marina de Larrakoetxea has driven herself to extraordinary lengths in
her pursuit of the answers to these questions. She represented herself
at the fatal accident inquiry in Dumfries -- in a second language, with
no legal training, asking questions of witnesses along with the best
legal minds in Scotland -- for a gruelling four months. Over and over
again she tried to push the parameters of the inquiry beyond what
Sheriff Principal John Mowat was prepared to accept. All prospect of a
normal life in New York -- where she lived and worked as a designer
before the disaster -- has been abandoned. Instead, her time is spent
between Spain, New York, Scotland, Germany and London, looking at every
possible option to help in her quest.
For Larrakoetxea it is an outrage that some people were given the
choice not to put their lives at risk. Following the shooting down in
July 1988 of an Iranian Airbus by the USS Vincennes, there was a
heightened awareness of the risk to American aviation. Warnings in the
months leading up to Lockerbie included a telephone call on December 5
to the US Embassy in Helsinki, naming PanAm, Frankfurt Airport and New
York as the destination -- and that there would be a bomb on the plane.
This warning was posted in the US Embassy in Moscow, and not revoked
before December 21.
Earlier this year a further intelligence warning from December 1988,
naming PanAm as a target, was released under the American Freedom of
Information Act. Yet Prime Minister John Major still maintains that ''no
specific warnings were received before the Lockerbie disaster''. For
Larrakoetxea these persistent denials in the face of mounting
information to the contrary are a deep source of frustration.
Having brought the case this far, both the American and British
Governments seem content to rest on their laurels: warrants have been
issued against two Libyans, and United Nations sanctions are in place to
put pressure on Libya to surrender the men. The impasse that began with
the indictments almost four years ago in November 1991 seems set to
continue, and it is one that stifles all public debate about the
disaster -- the subject is sub judice.
Arlington is a cemetery where America's military heroes are honoured.
For the United States, the bombing of PanAm 103 was a military action
that struck at the heart of the American way of life. According to a
spokesman from the US Embassy in London, the fact that there were also a
number of military personnel on the plane is justification enough for
the memorial to be at Arlington.
The cairn, consisting of 270 Scottish stones, will have on it, along
with the names of the dead, the words ''to commemorate those who lost
their lives in this attack against America''. The presence of Sir John
Kerr, British Ambassador to the United States, representing the Queen,
puts the seal of British Government approval on the event.
Larrakoetxea sought legal advice on whether she and her family could
prevent her sister's name from appearing on the memorial cairn. Her hope
was that a gap could remain, to be filled only when justice had been
served and the full truth had emerged.
It is right that there should be a fitting memorial to the 259
passengers and crew and 11 residents of Lockerbie who were killed. To
dedicate the memorial now, with the implication that the case is closed,
despite the fact that no-one has been brought to justice for the
bombing, is to Larrakoetxea entirely wrong.
Hers is an isolated position, but after nearly seven years of
struggle, that isolation is to her a small price to pay.

As Glasgow prepares to play host to 4000 young international
businessmen for a week, Robert Powell reports how the city could reap
rewards from the occasion in years to come.
MORE than 4000 young businessmen from around the world will descend on
Glasgow tomorrow for a week of seminars, socialising and networking to
clinch new deals.
The city's top hotels will be packed to capacity during the annual
congress of Junior Chamber International (JCI), which is expected to
pour between #5m and #7m into the local economy.
But there should also be long-term benefits from welcoming these
up-and-coming executives who are flying in from Europe, the Far East and
America to spend a pleasant week in Scotland. If they like what they
see, they may eventually decide to invest here.
''What we have got are the future decision makers in industry. The
payback for west central Scotland will be there for years to come,''
said John Morse, one of the congress organisers.
JCI links 400,000 businessmen aged between 18 and 40 who are members
of chambers of commerce the world over.
Every year they meet in a different country to socialise, conduct
training seminars and establish links which could lead to business deals
in the future.
The strongest contingent of delegates to the Glasgow congress is
coming from Japan. More than 1000 Japanese businessmen and their wives
are expected.
There will also be delegations several hundred strong from South Korea
-- which is hosting next year's congress in Pusan -- China, America,
France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and Finland.
But there will also be smaller delegations from countries such as
Zimbabwe and the Dominican Republic.
Glasgow clinched the venue for the 1995 congress three years ago after
fighting off stiff competition from Frankfurt and Miami, where the JCI
secretariat is based.
''We promoted Glasgow as a friendly place that could host the kind of
congress we were looking for, and we made no apology for supporting
whisky and golf,'' Mr Morse said.
In fact, many of the delegates will probably spend most of their
daylight hours seeing Scotland rather than attending training seminars
by the likes of Glasgow's personal development specialist Jack Black or
American management guru Gerry Godley.
Returning to Glasgow at night, the delegates will be invited to dinner
in Scottish family homes on Sunday, a special shopping session at Marks
&amp; Spencer on Monday night, and a chain of other social events during the
rest of the week culminating in a ball at the Kelvin Hall next Friday.
JCI president David Oji of Japan admits that the congress is a good
excuse for young businessmen to travel to parts of the world that they
might not otherwise see. And the Japanese, who always turn out in force
at JCI congresses, are no exception.
''Japanese people love to see other countries, and Scotland and
Glasgow are different from going to Hong Kong or other parts of Asia,''
he said.
''I believe that many of our members are interested in golf and they
would obviously like to see St Andrews or Turnberry or those other
famous golf courses,'' he added.
Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce and the city authorities are
particularly pleased that they have been able to host the JCI congress
even though they were unable to use Glasgow's main conference venue, the
Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) in Finnieston.
This will be occupied next week by firms setting up stands for the
Scottish Motor Show, so JCI will use Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and the
Kelvin Hall as its main venues.
Accommodation has been made available to suit all pockets, ranging
from youth hostel beds at #12 a night which may appeal to struggling
businessmen from Eastern Europe, to suites at five-star hotels at #140 a
night.
But with hotels in central Glasgow packed, some delegates are having
to stay as far away as East Kilbride.
The theme of this year's congress is ''Success through enterprise'',
reflecting the strong emphasis that JCI places these days on business
development.
Mr Oji said that when he joined JCI as a 24-year-old business studies
graduate in 1980, JCI saw itself much more as a service organisation
like the Lions or Rotary International.
In those days, the discussion of business matters at its meetings was
virtually taboo.
But this year's JCI congress is devoting the whole of Tuesday to
discussion of its ''Success through enterprise'' theme, with keynote
speakers from local organisations such as Scottish Enterprise on hand to
give Scotland's view.
Delegates who do not speak English need not worry. Throughout the
congress there will be simultaneous translation into French, Spanish and
Japanese.
Mr Oji, who runs a chain of restaurants and a clothing importing
business in Japan's port city of Yokohama, will make way for a new JCI
president at the Glasgow congress.
There is no mystery about his successor. The only candidate is Thomas
J. Clear III, a lawyer from Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The JCI congress is another landmark for putting Glasgow on the map of
the international conference circuit. Although it does not rival in size
the 10,000-delegate World Baptist Congress held in 1988, it is the kind
of high-profile prestige event that the city authorities are keen to
attract.
Other big international conferences earmarked for Glasgow include next
year's meeting of the International Society of Hypertension, which will
bring 6000 doctors to the city, and the annual congress of the American
Society of Travel Agents in 1997.
But the big daddy of them all will be a congress of 25,000 delegates
of Rotary International, also scheduled for 1997.
There was no rivalry between Glasgow and Edinburgh to stage this
year's JCI congress -- Edinburgh hosted the event in 1955. But following
the recent completion of Edinburgh International Conference Centre there
may well be more competition between the two cities to attract major
gatherings in the future.

Geneva
THE British-born former wife of Prince Aga Khan appeared in a Geneva
court today to ask a judge to lift an order barring her from selling
family jewels, legal sources said.
Princess Salimah faced the same judge who 10 days ago issued an
injunction against the sale, but there is no decision yet.
Auctioneers Christie's has estimated that the 261 lots of jewels, due
to be sold on November 13, could fetch #10m.
The Aga Khan says that, under the terms of the couple's divorce
settlement last March, the princess cannot sell off the collection and
must give him first option to buy individual pieces.
The princess, former model Sarah Croker Poole, and the Aga Khan were
married for more than 25 years and had three children.
0 ''The collection is the most sumptuous to have appeared on the
market since the sale of the Duchess of Windsor's jewels in 1987,''
boasts a press release from Christie's.
The 55-year-old Princess, who lives in Geneva, has launched two
appeals against the sale ban.
A three-judge panel at Geneva's appeals court is also set to hear the
case on Monday, lawyers said.
Under the terms of divorce the prince recognised the ''jewels shall
remain the princess's property'', according to one Geneva lawyer who has
seen the document.
But the text is said to stipulate that she must ensure the gems ''as
much as possible remained in the family'' and that she can only sell
''some items'' in extreme circumstances.
A friend of the princess said: ''She didn't get much in the divorce,
only 10% of what she wanted initially.
''She doesn't have much choice but to sell the jewels to make a break
with the past and to maintain her lifestyle.''
* The largest deep blue diamond ever offered at auction is expected to
fetch a world record #7.5m for a coloured stone when it is auctioned in
Geneva later this month, Sotheby's said. The gem is about the size of a
small postage stamp. -- Reuter.

Durban
BLACK demonstrators chanted ''murderers'' and ''bring de Klerk here''
after South Africa's former defence minister and 10 other white ex-army
officers were charged with death squad murders eight years ago in the
Zulu homeland.
Hawkish former defence chief Magnus Malan and the 10 retired senior
officers were arrested and accused of apartheid-era murders, a day after
the country held its first all-race local elections.
The 11, including five generals and an admiral, were granted bail and
told to appear in Durban Regional Court again on December 1, prosecutors
said.
They were charged with the murder of 13 blacks, including 11 women and
children, who were attending a prayer meeting in KwaZulu-Natal in 1987
during the dying years of apartheid. They were not asked to plead.
''They were arrested shortly before they appeared in court. They are
all charged with 13 counts of murder,'' said Carl Koenig, a prosecutor
with the police investigation task unit.
The announcement last Sunday that they faced arrest grabbed the
headlines in the run-up to the local government polls which hammered the
final nail into the coffin of apartheid.
Electoral officials said President Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress, which won power in South Africa's democracy elections in April
last year to end centuries of white supremacy, was poised for an
overwhelming victory as preliminary results trickled in for nearly 700
local councils.
Malan and the other retired officers, who appeared in the courtroom
dressed in sober grey or dark suits, have also been accused by the
government of involvement in so-called Third Force activities against
anti-apartheid movements.
A 12th accused, Brigadier John More, who was arrested a few months ago
and who has already appeared, joined the row of former security bosses
in front of the dock.
Malan, a former defence force chief who was defence minister during
the last violent decade of apartheid from 1980 to 1991, told reporters
as he left the court that the arrests were a crisis for the country.
''I would like to say I am a moderate . . . I am a democrat. I believe
in democracy in the new South Africa. Above all, I am a Christian. What
happened here today is the biggest crisis in the democracy of South
Africa.
''Democracy in South Africa is now in its darkest hour ever,'' he said
after being released on #1750 bail.
Deputy President F W de Klerk, South Africa's last white leader and
head of the National Party that entrenched and then dismantled
apartheid, said on Wednesday he and his party stood by the security
forces and wanted temporary immunity for the accused.
But Mandela, who succeeded de Klerk after the 1994 polls, said he
would not halt the prosecutions.
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi told a news briefing in
Johannesburg that de Klerk and Mandela's arch black rival, Zulu Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, could be called to testify in the trial.
The accused had halted a bid by white rightist Freedom Front leader
Constand Viljoen to obtain a court order preventing their arrest, saying
they wanted to clear their names as soon as possible. A trial is
unlikely until next year. -- Reuter.

New York
THE aphrodisiac the world has been searching for may be contained in a
capsule of chicken egg extract, doctors announcing clinical trials of a
treatment to boost sexual desire said today.
The product's researchers told a news conference at the New York
Academy of Sciences that a drug called Libido, already marketed in
Norway, would be tested over the next three years at hospitals in the
United States and Canada.
In a trial in Norway involving men with reduced sexual desire, more
than 83 percent responded positively to the treatment, ranging from a
''minor increase'' in desire to a ''very pronounced increase'', doctors
said.
''The world has been deluged with so-called aphrodisiacs for
centuries, and it is a fact that there really isn't an aphrodisiac,''
said the University of Toronto's Dr Jerald Bain.
''Whether Libido the drug is going to turn out to be that elusive
aphrodisiac really remains to be proven in a scientific way. At least
the initial study suggests that there is some potential for that to be
the case,'' he added.
The North American clinical trials of the treatment, a capsule taken
orally and made of freeze-dried chicken egg extract, will involve 500
men and 500 women at 20 hospitals in the United States and Canada.
The eggs are incubated for nine days, then broken. The extracts are
freeze-dried and made into a powder and put into capsules without other
medicinal ingredients. -- Reuter.

Helsinki
A CLAIM by three women to be the daughters of the youngest son of the
murdered Czar Nicholas II is to be investigated by Finnish scientists.
The women say that the Czar's son, Alexis, survived the Bolshevik
firing squad which killed his family in 1918.
The Finnish experts said today that, at the request of Russian
officials, they are to carry out DNA tests on the women, who all live in
St Petersburg.
''The claims are possible,'' said Ms Helena Ranta, a forensic
orthodontologist at Helsinki University.
The university signed an agreement on Wednesday with the St Petersburg
Academy of Arts and Science to study the three women. A fourth, claiming
to be their sister, lives in Germany.
Ms Ranta said: ''We should have our research results before the end of
the year.''
Nicholas II abdicated in 1917. The following year the Bolsheviks shot
him, his family and servants in Yekaterinburg, about 900 miles east of
Moscow.
American and Russian DNA experts said in August that tests they
carried out conclusively determined that bones found in a pit near the
city are those of the Czar and his family.
The remains included skeletons of Nicholas, his wife, three daughters,
three servants and a family doctor. Two skeletons were missing.
''The two are those of the son, Alexis, and a daughter, either
Anastasia or Marie,'' said Ms Ranta from the university's department of
forensic medicine.
The Duke of Edinburgh, whose grandmother, Princess Victoria, was the
sister of the last Czar's wife, gave blood for DNA tests in 1992. The
Czarina and her children had the same DNA and matched the Duke exactly.
The Finnish team will conduct similar DNA tests and will study X-rays
to try to settle the new claim.
The three women, with the family name of Filatov, were born in the
1950s. They say their father was Alexis, who lived and was buried in
Astrakhan, about 800 miles south of Moscow.
''If their claims are false, the tests will show it,'' Ms Ranta said.
But she warned: ''If they are Alexis's daughters, the tests won't be
able to prove it 100%.'' -- AP.

Wellington
THE Queen today signed a historic new law giving back land to the
Maoris and apologising for a ''crime'' against them.
In New Zealand's capital, Wellington, the Queen gave Royal Assent to
the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Bill, the first legislation of its
kind, which returns 38,000 acres of confiscated Maori land and pays #26m
in compensation.
The strong wording of the legislation refers to the seizure of land in
the North Island Waikato region by British colonists in 1863.
''The Crown expresses its profound regret and apologises unreservedly
for the loss of lives because of the hostilities arising from its
invasion, and at the devastation of property and social life which
resulted,'' the Act says. Compensation was the ''acknowledgment by the
Crown of their crime''.
Prime Minister Jim Bolger said: ''Her Majesty was asked to sign the
Bill in her constitutional role. It's an apology from the New Zealand
Government . . . it's not a personal apology from Her Majesty.''
Earlier the Queen faced Maori protesters, who labelled her a parasite
and staged a noisy demonstration, chanting ''Go Home!'' A group of about
100 left-wing Maori activists demonstrated outside a Maori Arts and
Crafts Institute when the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh paid a visit.

Stephen McGinty reports how satellite and cable companies are
competing to win viewers to their adult channels -- while hardcore
pornography programmes are slipping into Britain by the back door.
'NO sex please, we're British!'' It was the standard refrain of an
older time. A time of prim pin-stripe suits, bowler hats and bristling
moustaches. When sex was strictly for the foreigners. But time will
change even the most rigid dress sense -- on Europe's adult television
channels glittering G-strings are second to birthday suits, although
some in Britain, despite the launch of Playboy TV, are still unwilling
to wear it.
This week the Methodist Church decided to sell their shares in BSkyB
in protest at the satellite company's involvement with the American
soft-porn channel.
The development came on the same day the Independent Television
Commission announced the results of research into nudity in television
adverts. The research showed that nearly half those questioned did not
see the fuss over nudity. The #40,000 study was set up in the wake of an
advert for the shower gel Neutralia which attracted 300 complaints after
it showed the female nipple.
Researcher Wendy Hayward grouped viewers' responses into ''personality
archetypes'' after showing them foreign commercials containing different
degrees of nudity.
Ms Hayward said nearly half the people questioned fell into the
''liberal'' category and could not see why people made such a fuss about
nudity. Most of the remainder fell into the ''moralist'' or ''puritan''
groups. Only a few were ''crusaders'' or ''libertines'' who felt that
the more nudity there was the better.
The Methodist Church would fit neatly into the ''moralist'' mould. A
statement by the church said the decision was ''taken in order to
express dissatisfaction with material which is designed wholly to
provide sexual stimulation, and which degrades and exploits human
beings.''
The Methodist's backlash was the first of two body-blows to blight
Wednesday's launch of Playboy TV's new multi-million pound channel. The
second was launched by Television X. Models from the rival adult channel
hi-jacked Playboy's Trafalgar square press conference brandishing
banners saying ''Bunnies have diseases''.
Yet both companies will hope subscriptions will be boosted by the
media blitz. But in Scotland, United Artists cable company reported that
only 100 people had signed up for the new Playboy channel, while 3000 --
4% of cable subscribers -- take a variety of late-night adult channels
including HVC, Adult Channel and TVX.
Experts say a number of reasons lie behind the current interest in
adult channels. The first was the release in 1991 of The Lover's Guide
video. The film was described as an instructional sex guide by the BBFC
who despite the presence of erections and scenes which would result in
heavy fines in a film, possibly even jail sentences, granted it an
''18'' certificate.
This was followed by a flood of sexually explicit videos starring porn
actors whose previously illegal antics were rendered legitimate by the
simple inclusion of an elderly doctor discussing the health benefits of
various sexual positions.
Both TVX and Playboy TV are aimed at different markets. Patrick Keegan
of Playboy TV said: ''We cater for men and women and couples. TVX just
caters to men.''
Deric Botham of Television X said: ''We like it cheap and cheerful,
our sex. This is what you want when you come home from the pub with your
curry.''
Both stations, however, are approved by the ITC who are currently
requesting the Secretary of State to make a proscription order against
two European hard-core channels, Rendezvous and TV Erotica. If
successful, advertising, marketing and sales of satellite smart-cards
for both channels will be made illegal.
However, those seeking access to harder material can purchase illegal
smart cards through Soho sex shops. These allow satellite systems to
decode the signals carrying hard-core European sex channels such as TV
Eurotica which is beamed from Denmark.
Geoff Baines of What Satellite? said: ''There is a market for
pornography in Europe and in the UK, and as long as there is a market
there will be channels trying to satisfy that market. The only thing the
UK Government can do is scratch the surface. The technology has moved on
and the law is left behind, as is so often the case.''
In 1994, National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley made a
proscription order against Red Hot Television, as it consisted
exclusively of hardcore pornography. The channel ceased transmission not
long after the order was made. However, a number of complaints have also
been made by the public to the ITC about the Adult Channel, one of the
longest-running titles. Ironically the complaints are about the service
being over-censored.
So maybe that old adage should be: ''Some sex, please we're fickle.''

Katherine Butler reports from Mauritius how former colonies of
European states believe the special relationship which has provided them
with aid over the past 20 years is about to end
EU MINISTERS fly out to a small island in the Indian Ocean tomorrow to
renew their 20-year-old trade and aid pact with 70 of the world's
poorest nations. But the celebrations held to mark the end of almost two
years of painstaking negotiations will be overshadowed by the fears of
the developing countries that they are signing up for the last time.
The Lome Convention, designed essentially to prop up former British,
French, Dutch and Belgian colonies, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa but
also in the Caribbean and Pacific, offers aid in excess of #10bn over
the next five years but more importantly tariff-free access to European
markets for certain exports.
However, as the guilt for past colonial sins abates and Europe becomes
increasingly preoccupied with the former Soviet bloc states of Central
and Eastern Europe, many observers doubt if the agreement can survive
beyond the year 2000.
Negotiations to renew the convention were marked by bitter and at
times unseemly squabbles among EU countries over the size of their
contributions to the Lome aid budget, auguring badly for the future. The
particularly mean-spirited attitude of Britain and Germany (the UK
wanted to slash its donation by 30%) came as a shock to their former
colonies, convincing them that the days of this special relationship are
numbered.
In real terms, the new aid deal, agreed only after Germany secured
backing for a multi-billion pound cash package for Eastern Europe,
offers the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states no increase in
real terms on the previous agreement. To compensate for this
disappointment EU governments insist they have revamped the trade
provisions of the treaty, making it easier for ACP exports to penetrate
European markets.
Some of the concessions are hollow, however. Of the 300 farm imports
on which duties have been cut, the ACP countries have exports only in
50. And products which might pose a competitive threat, like olives,
lemons and wine, are still subject to full tariffs. One EU diplomat
admitted: ''We talk about opening markets but as soon as it comes to
anything sensitive, forget it.''
For manufactured exports, the new pact relaxes strict rules which
formerly denied ACP states concessionary trade treatment if they used
even a small percentage of foreign components.
Key industrial sectors like textiles, where countries like Mauritius
might have a competitive edge over Greek or Portuguese garment makers,
are excluded from concessionary treatment, yet success stories like
Mauritius, with its thriving sugar and textile industries, have proved
that it is trade, not aid, which will allow the Third World to catch up.
Mauritian Prime Minister Aneerood Jugnauth blames the end of the cold
war and the consequent loss of Africa's strategic interest for Europe
for what he calls ''the declining interest of our partners in our
struggle for development''.
British officials claim that the Government's reluctance to boost its
contribution to the pact's aid fund this time round is because Britain
wants to channel more cash into bilateral overseas aid rather than
expand a programme which is often inefficient, badly administered and
could soon be obsolete. Undoubtedly the EU's cumbersome procedures and
red tape could be tightened up, but Britain's attitude is viewed by
other member states as simply another example of its hostility to
anything orchestrated or managed by Brussels.
But even in Brussels top officials are prepared to concede that the
Lome experience may be drawing to the end of its natural life and
thoughts should be turning to a new model. European Commission research
shows that Africa's trade with Europe has actually been declining rather
than gaining ground over Third World regions despite the trade
preferences it enjoys. And changes in world trade rules could ultimately
make those preferences illegal anyway.
EU overseas aid commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro says the world has
changed and so the relationship must be adapted. ''Geopolitically and
economically so many things have changed. We must look at the convention
with new glasses.'' But even if the special relationship has to be
broken off Pinheiro insists it is possible for the two sides to remain
good friends.

Kirsty Scott examines a new report which attacks the myths surrounding
teenage mothers
IF YOU believe the stereotype, she's a scheming teenager using
conception as the key to a house of her own and a fistful of public
cash. But new research on the single mother has provided a different
portrait; that of a young woman who had not planned a pregnancy and
wouldn't wish the experience on anyone else.
The study, published today by the Family Policy Studies Centre,
analysed a variety of existing statistics and carried out a series of
in-depth interviews with young mothers to try to distinguish the reality
of teenage parenthood from the myths that surround it.
The researchers found that raising children on their own is not what
teenagers plan, and most aspire to a steady relationship and a
two-parent home for their child or children. In addition, the single
mothers questioned wouldn't recommend their experience as one that other
girls should follow, and most said unplanned pregnancies were the result
of contraceptives being misused or unavailable, rather than total
ignorance about family planning.
Other findings included:
* Moral objections to abortion and a sense of personal responsibility
are the main reasons for teenagers deciding to proceed with the
pregnancy.
* Those who had thought about parenthood before they became pregnant
expected to follow a traditional course of finding a permanent
relationship and settled home before starting a family.
* Some of the single women had never lived with the father of their
child, but a growing proportion were women whose cohabitation had broken
down either before or after birth.
* Teenage mothers may have to wait several years for their own
accommodation and living with their parents is not always possible or
satisfactory, especially in the long term.
The report author, Louie Burghes, said the findings had shown that the
popular myths about teenage mothers were not supported by the facts.
''The reality, underlined by these findings, is that there is no
simple explanations or short-term policy solutions for the problem of
unplanned teenage pregnancies,'' he said. ''One long-term aim must be to
reduce conceptions . . . but where children are conceived, it is
essential to promote family stability by providing better access to
housing and employment opportunities.''
Groups representing single mothers said they were delighted with the
report, after a year of sustained sniping against lone parents, which
culminated with the suggestion by the Conservative MP John Redwood that
single mothers consider adoption if they don't have a support structure
for their child.
''This study supports what we have been saying for 50 years; that
young single mothers need support, not blame,'' said Ian Maxwell of One
Parent Families.
''You need to educate boys as well as girls in the implications of
pregnancy and bringing up a child. It's very refreshing to get reports
which are as level-headed as this one.''
Across at the One-Plus organisation in Glasgow, spokeswoman Marion
Davis said: ''It really debunks a lot of the myths surrounding lone
parents and it confirms our views which are based on years of working
with lone mothers and children.''
Davis is hopeful that such research will start to do away with the
stereotypes, but is concerned that the single mother will continue to be
used as a metaphor for all that is wrong with society, and possibly as
an excuse for making cuts in public spending.
One issue the campaign groups are keeping an eye on is the suggestion
that the Government might abolish the lone-parent supplement on income
support, worth #6.30 a week. It's estimated the move could save the
Government #330m a year and could help achieve the Tories' goal of
pre-election tax cuts. Government sources have described the concerns as
speculation and declined to comment further.
The campaigners say that for all single mothers, teenage or not, any
clear-sighted attempt to examine their real, instead of imagined, lives
is more than welcome.
One single mum, Angie, who is in her mid-20s, recently told The Herald
that it was not a life that people chose willingly. ''The majority of
people don't choose to be single parents,'' she said. ''I didn't choose
to be a single parent, it just happened. Don't people know that it's a
struggle every single day?''

Patrick Laurence, in Johannesburg, examines the consequences for South
Africa of the decision to prosecute a former Defence Minister and top
security officers suspected of connections with death squads during the
country's apartheid years.
ASURREAL element has entered South African politics: the arrest of
former Defence Minister Magnus Malan on charges of murder arising out of
the slaying of 13 people, including seven children, in January 1987.
General Malan, who appeared in court briefly yesterday, is one of 11
former security police officers, including two former chiefs of the
South African Defence Force -- General Jannie Geldenhuys and General Kat
Liebenburg -- indicted in connection with an attack on a house in
KwaMakhuta, south of Durban, by men armed with AK-47s rifles.
The arrest of General Malan has sent shock waves through Afrikanerdom
and the parties which rely heavily on Afrikaner support, F W de Klerk's
National Party and Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front.
It is not impossible that Mr de Klerk and General Viljoen, another
former chief of the SA Defence Force, could find themselves in the dock
if the indictment of Malan is a harbinger of what lies ahead.
Nelson Mandela's Minister of Safety and Security, Sydney Mufamadi, has
inadvertently -- or perhaps not so inadvertently -- encouraged
conjecture along those lines by emphasising that investigations into the
1987 massacre would continue even if they implicate Mr De Klerk and
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
The arrest of General Malan and his 10 co-accused has affected
adversely two positive features of the contemporary political situation:
it has put additional strain on the Government of National Unity and it
has put the special -- and strange -- friendship between President
Mandela and General Viljoen in jeopardy.
Mr de Klerk's National Party, a partner in the Government of National
Unity, has said that the arrest of General Malan, once one of the most
powerful men in South Africa, has placed South Africa ''before its
greatest test since a negotiated solution was achieved.''
Chief Buthelezi's IFP, the third partner in the Government of National
Unity, has similarly condemned the arrest of General Malan and described
the endeavours of a special police task unit to identify the leaders of
death squads as a ''witch hunt''.
General Viljoen, who won Mr Mandela's admiration and perhaps even
gratitude by urging Afrikaner nationalists to seek their coveted
Afrikaner state or volkstaat through negotiations rather than war, has
expressed disquite, if not distrust, over ANC assurances that the
amnesty policy -- to which the ANC is publicly committed -- will be
applied dispassionately to both sides in the past conflict.
By prosecuting General Malan the ANC has risked fomenting resistance
and even rebellion against its rule by Afrikaner nationalists less than
18 months after Mr Mandela's inauguration, amid a mood of optimism, as
South Africa's first democratically elected President.
At the same time it has pre-empted the work of the Truth Commission.
One of the purposes of the commission is to act as a vehicle for amnesty
actions arising from the struggle between the security forces of the
white minority government and guerrillas of the ANC.
The question that observers are asking is why has the ANC taken the
risky course of prosecuting key figures in the security establishment
which served under President de Klerk and his predecessor, President P W
Botha.
The formal answer is that Mr Mufamadi has appointed a task unit to
investigate death squads which allegedly operated from within the
KwaZulu Police -- which was controlled by Chief Buthelezi until the
formal dissolution of the KwaZulu polity in April last year -- and that
the investigation and the law must take its course.
But there is no doubt that a political decision was taken in the first
place to establish the task unit, even if the actual pro forma decision
to prosecute General Malan was taken by the Attorney General of
KwaZulu-Natal, Tim McNally. It is pertinent to note that Mr McNally was
earlier subject to vigorous criticism by ANC leaders, including its
secretary-general, Cyril Ramaphosa, for his alleged reluctance to
prosecute leading members of the IFP and the KwaZulu Police.
A political factor which may have influenced the ANC is the perception
in the black community that Mr Mandela has been so anxious to assuage
white fears that he has neglected the black community.
What better way of demonstrating that he has not been beguiled by
General Viljoen and misled by Mr de Klerk than prosecuting General
Malan? Suspicions of a political motive are strengthened by the timing
of the prosecution: the decision was made on the eve of South Africa's
local government elections.
The danger of a right-wing rebellion -- accentuated by Mr Mandela's
refusal to heed pleas to extend the amnesty cut-off date under the Truth
Commission from December 5, 1993, to May 10, 1994, to include the
right-wingers responsible for the bomb blitz on the eve of the April
1994 election -- is compounded by another risk: that prosecution of
General Malan could establish a legal precedent for prosecution of top
ANC leaders.
If Malan is prosecuted for alleged involvement in the KwaMakhuta
massacre, why should the present Minister of Defence, Joe Modise, not be
prosecuted for his role as the former commander of the ANC guerrilla
army in its attacks on unarmed civilians, including a car bomb explosion
which killed 19 civilians in May 1983?
If Malan is arraigned for the KwaMakhuta killings, why should Mr
Mandela escape responsibility for the Shell House Massacre in which
eight Zulu protesters were shot dead outside the ANC's national
headquarters, and for his role in refusing to allow police to enter the
ANC headquarters to confiscate the weapons they thought were used in the
killing?
Mr Mandela has described the Shell House killings as self defence
after admitting, 18 months after the event, that he gave the
shoot-to-kill-if-necessary order. But, as Chief Buthelezi has pointed
out, ''self defence'' was the reason given by police when they were
criticised for the Sharpeville massacre of March 1960.

Miami
THE hijacker of a school bus carrying 11 disabled children was shot
dead by police today after a harrowing hour-long ride.
The man, said to have a grudge against tax collectors, died in a hail
of bullets after the bus stopped outside a Miami Beach restaurant.
Police tried to negotiate with him and when that failed they fired at
least three shots, said Metro-Dade police spokesman Pat Brickman.
''My information is he was not shot in the bus, he was shot in the
doorway,'' said the spokesman.
''The bus driver said she felt threatened because when he argued with
her he would reach inside his jacket. She thought he might shoot her.''
Television pictures showed police swarming around the bus door, then
dragging the hijacker away.
He told police he had a bomb and threatened to blow up the bus. Police
said a device strapped to the man's body turned out not to be dangerous.
Dade County schools Superintendent Octavio Visiedo said 11 youngsters,
some as young as seven, were on the bus, along with the woman driver and
an assistant.
''The bus driver frankly was a hero,'' Visiedo said. ''She never
panicked.''
Several of the children were said to have cuts and bruises, but fire
and rescue officials said none were seriously hurt.
Police vehicles quickly surrounded the bus as it travelled along two
major roads and the bus driver passed on the hijacker's demands over her
radio.
News helicopters followed and the chase was broadcast live on US
television.
The hijacker took the bus across the MacArthur Causeway linking Miami
and Miami Beach and led police through the streets of a tourist area.
He finally stopped outside a popular restaurant where he said he
wanted to eat lunch, the police spokesman said.
Dozens of police cars surrounded the bus and armed police crouched
behind them.
''As the bus stopped we attempted to make contact,'' Brickman said,
but then the bus started moving again and police opened fire.
Two restaurant workers said the hijacker had worked with them as a
waiter but quit last night, apparently because of a tax dispute.--AP.

Paris
THE arrest of Islamic terrorist suspects foiled an imminent bomb
attack on a crowded street market in the northern city of Lille, French
interior minister Jean-Louis Debre said yesterday.
He said the arrests appeared to be a major step in the probe into a
recent wave of bomb attacks, blamed on Algerian fundamentalist
militants, but more attacks could take place. ''The threat remains,'' he
warned.
Debre said 10 people were in police custody, including 27-year-old
Algerian Boualem Bensaid, who was suspected of being the leader of the
group planning the bomb attack on a Sunday market in Lille this weekend.
The minister said that, at the home of one of those detained near
Lille, police found a gas canister, explosives, nails and bolts and a
detonating device identical to the components of bombs used in some of
the attacks in which seven people have been killed and more than 170
wounded since July.
Documents, computers, accounts and weapons were also seized in the
swoops in Paris, Lyon and Lille.
Meanwhile, a statement by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), posted on to
the Internet computer network on October 20 by a California-based
grouping, says its fighters carried out bombings in France and vows that
it will strike again.
The text is similar to that of a letter sent to an international news
agency in Cairo last month. It carries the same date, September 23, and
both are signed by GIA leader Abu Abdel Rahman Ameen.
''Let it be our promise...that we will disturb your sleep, and tear
(you) up, and Islam will enter France,'' it concludes.
The statement denies the GIA had sought dialogue by sending a letter
to French President Jacques Chirac in August and inviting him to become
a Moslem.
The statement is published on the Internet by a group calling itself
the American Islamic Group (AIG) which gives an address and a telephone
number in San Diego.
''Before you read: We do not represent GIA. The following is only for
purposes of Informing Muslims,'' the AIG says in an introductory
disclaimer.
''AIG could easily be read as GIA. It says its material is only aimed
at informing Moslems but if you read on you realise that the two are
close,'' said Professor Paul Wilkinson, an expert on terrorism based at
St Andrews' University.
''In the United States and in other countries, a network of extremists
ranging from religious extremists to militia-type groups and Moslem
fundamentalists ... are using Internet.''

Manila
ABOUT 160,000 people fled their homes as super-typhoon Angela slammed
into the Philippines' most populous island today, flattening 15,000
houses, killing three people, and plunging five provinces into darkness.
Villagers unable to flee climbed to the roofs of their flooded homes
as the fiercest typhoon to hit the storm-prone archipelago roared
towards Luzon island, threatening the capital Manila.
President Fidel Ramos put the armed forces and the police on
nationwide alert.
Angela's wind speed picked up to 167mph as its eye approached the
Philippines but eased to 155mph after smashing into the Bicol region on
its way to the heartland of Luzon.
Forecasters said there was a chance it might weaken further slightly
before it hit the capital of 8.5 million people.
''The winds are so powerful people in tall buildings here feel they
are being hit by an earthquake,'' said Catanduanes Governor Severo
Alcantara as Angela hammered his province in Bicol for six hours
yesterday.
''We can't leave our offices. Anyone who walks in the street will be
blown away by the winds,'' Alcantara said.
Bicol civil defence officials said three people died in the region,
including a man hit by a flying iron roof sheet.
More than 31,000 families fled their homes and sought cover in
government buildings, schools, and churches.
The typhoon has already wrecked 15,000 wooden houses in Catanduanes,
220 miles east of Manila. It also knocked out electric power in five
Bicol provinces. At least 16 towns were flooded, some under 5ft of
water.
Angela was the most powerful storm since 1987 when Typhoon Nina killed
almost 1000 Filipinos and caused #29m in damage.--Reuter.

Police arrested him in Staffordshire after a tip-off from a driver who

No shots were fired and no firearm was recovered from Morris, said
police.
Morris became obsessed with Miss Hobkinson, now 26, and bombarded her

EGG collectors, trappers and marksmen are killing hundreds of birds of
prey in Scotland every year, according to a report published yesterday
by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
The findings come only days after Scottish landowners called for a
change in the law to allow them to kill hawks and eagles on their
estates.
Laws designed to protect the birds are being regularly flouted by
estate owners and gamekeepers, who blame them for the fall in the number
of grouse on their stooting moors, according to the RSPB.
Two hundred and thirty dead birds of prey were found by the RSPB in
1994. Many more birds are thought have been killed and disposed of
without its knowledge.
The majority of these were buzzards and hen harriers, but golden
eagles, peregrines and sparrowhawks were also found.
RSPB spokesman Mike Everett said: ''There are only 650 pairs of hen
harriers in the whole of Britain, and a significant number of these are
killed illegally every year.''
Egg collectors from all over Britain descend on remote Scottish glens
to steal the eggs of rare birds.
Even the endangered osprey is not spared their attentions. This summer
15 eggs were stolen from six nests in Strathspey.
MrStuart Housden, the RSPB's Scottish director, said: ''It is ironic
that the Scottish Landowners Federation is calling for changes in the
law to allow the killing of birds of prey in Scotland when persecution
and poisoning are already so widespread.''
He called on the Scottish public to be more vigilant and to report any
illegal kills to the police.

SHELTER Scotland yesterday praised the Government for its efforts to
help the street homeless in London, but pleaded for the same support
north of the Border.
The Government had spend #182m on the Rough Sleeping Initiative in the
English capital over the past five years in conjunction with voluntary
bodies, which had involved building 3000 homes.
Ideas for the same kind of approach were floated yesterday at a
seminar in Edinburgh organised by Shelter Scotland. Depute director Ms
Kate Caskie said: ''Voluntary organisations are usually reluctant to do
this, but we do congratulate the Government.
''They set the goal for the initiative and they have achieved it, and
we have to give them credit for that.''
However, she said, over the same five years, only #150,000 had been
distributed to a number of small-scale projects throughout Scotland,
where every night up to 1000 people are still sleeping rough.
Ms Caskie said the Scottish Office was carrying out detailed research
on homelessness, and Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was aware of the
acute problems of people sleeping in the streets.
''I don't think anybody can understand how miserable it is to sleep
rough. London has given an example to follow, but we would need to apply
things differently ln Scotland.
''We would have be creative about it, but I certainly believe it is
not beyond the wit of the volutnary sector and Government in Scotland to
come up with a successful approach.''

A LEADING Scottish property developer was yesterday accused of
attempting to pervert the course of justice following the death of a
workman employed on one of his sites.
Mr Kenneth Harper, 47, secretary of JK Investments Ltd, also faced
four charges alleging contravention of the Health and Safety at Work
Act.
The firm was also accused of the same charges at Dundee Sheriff Court.
It is claimed that an attempt to pervert the course of justice took
place when metal washers were welded to the hinges of hoist gates in a
bid to destroy or hide evidence of offences.
Harper and his firm deny failing to ensure that a diesel driven
platform hoist was safe.
It is alleged that, as a result, a hinged gate fell off and fatally
injured John Stupart.
Mr Stupart, of St Fillans Road, Dundee, was struck on the head by the
gate on April 17 this year at the former Royal Hotel in Union Street,
Dundee.
MrHarper and JK Investments deny that the hoist was operated in an
unsafe condition adjacent to a road and that the hoistway of the
platform was not sufficiently protected by gates.
It also denies that it failed to ensure that the hoistway was
protected by an enclosure to a height of at least two metres and that an
employee could be struck by moving parts.
The address of Mr Harper, who was not in court, was given as c/o JK
Investments Ltd, Old Hawkhill, Dundee.
The case was continued until December 8.

Local Government Correspondent Frances Horsburgh reports from The
Herald's conference on single-tier councils.
COSLA's Labour president, Councillor Rosemary McKenna, yesterday
unveiled fresh information on the vexed topics of councillors' special
responsibility allowances and the number of senior officials being
appointed by the new councils.
She told The Herald's The Challenge of Change conference on the new
single-tier councils that she hoped these figures would finally stop the
continuous sniping by Ministers at local government.
Cosla's survey showed that, with just one council still to set up an
allowances scheme, out of 1245 councillors there were 667 positions
which received such payments. Given the one-third reduction in the
number of councillors as a result of reorganisation, this would seem
''an entirely sensible spread of responsibility'', she claimed.
The average allowance was #12,500, equivalent to the salary of a
senior clerical officer working in local government.
The cost of the entire SRA scheme was around #5m which was less than
0.1% of total council spending in Scotland. The total cost of
councillors' allowances was #11m.
Mrs McKenna told the conference in the Carlton Highland Hotel,
Edinburgh: ''This is a small price to pay when you consider that the
responsibilities of senior councillors range from establishing major
strands of policy dealing with central government and other government
agencies and from the extremely complex area of local government finance
to the responsibilities of the council as an employer.''
Cosla's own research also showed that there had been a reduction from
1343 appointments at a salary of above #42,000 a year in the regional
and district councils to 713 under the new unitary system. Just five
councils still had to complete their management structures.
''Do Ministers ever think about the impact of using words like 'jobs
for the boys' and 'fat cats' about local government employees?'' she
said. ''I would have thought that they would have been wanting to talk
up morale in local government at this time to ensure a smooth transition
to the new authorities.''
The Cosla president explained that the salaries of chief executives,
none of which was above #100,000, had been determined through national
negotiation so that, regardless of the political complexion of councils,
the salaries would have been the same.
The allegation that councils were guilty of creating ''jobs of the
boys'' was rich considering the 5000 quango appointees in Scotland, she
said.
Mrs McKenna said Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's approach now
seemed to be, to paraphrase the words of Mr Michael Heseltine, ''I will
attack local government before breakfast, before lunch, before dinner,
especially during Labour Party conference, and certainly always before
newspaper deadlines.''
The relationship beween central and local government was now a bit
like Laurel and Hardy. Mr Forsyth was Hardy and local government was
Laurel. Hardy pretended to be Laurel's friend while knocking him about
all the time.

A NUMBER of speakers at the conference expressed their anger over the
increasing number of attacks by Scottish Office Ministers on local
government and the behaviour of some new councils.
Councillor Tom McCabe, Labour leader of the new South Lanarkshire
Council, denounced ''a hostile and despicable campaign of black
propaganda'' which he claimed had begun to flow from the Scottish Office
even before the unitary authorities had taken over the delivery of
services.
''We have already heard this morning from Mr Kynoch that he is more
than willing to play his part in doing whatever damage is necessary
through disinformation and downright inaccuracy if it helps the campaign
to re-elect a Conservative Government.''
He said Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth had indicated when he took
over that he wanted a more constructive relationship with local
government. The ''selective and misleading statements'' which had been
made within the last few weeks indicated a very different agenda.
''It seems that no matter what local government does over the next 12
months it will be belittled and falsely portrayed. That, however, should
not stop us from adopting an approach which allows us to defend the
critical services that local government delivers as well as the very
notion of meaningful local government,'' Councillor McCabe told the
conference.
Councillor David Begg, transport convener in the new City of Edinburgh
Council, said he was ''sick fed up of local government being used as a
punchbag by Michael Forsyth and his Ministers''.
Referring to their claims that Scottish local government staff numbers
had increased by 6% since 1987 compared to a fall south of the Border,
Councillor Begg said this could be explained in a number of ways.
For example, Scottish councils had been much more successful than
their English counterparts in retaining the provision of services
in-house when they were put out to public tender.
It was also the case that, while only one school had opted out in
Scotland, there were over 1000 grant-maintained schools in England. Down
south more than one million pupils were in classes of more than 30. They
should make a virtue of the fact that local government services were
better north of the Border.
Councillor Begg said they were also told local councillors were not
accountable enough. But there were four times as many people appointed
to quangos in Scotland than there were councillors. None of them was as
accountable as a locally elected member of a council.
This Government had at most only 18 months of life left, he told the
conference. His message to Ministers was: ''Just leave us alone and let
us get on with the job.'' After that, he hoped the Scottish Office would
be under new management.

<HEADLINE>Sacked executive hits out at trust</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FORMER health trust executive has claimed he has been made the
''scapegoat'' for the #1.8m blunder which cost him his job.
Mr Alastair Christie, 42, who was speaking for the first time since
being sacked by the Highland Communities NHS Trust last August, claimed
he was now being blamed for the mismanagement of others at the trust,
which has its headquarters in Inverness.
Around 45 employees of the 2000-plus staff face redundancy as a result
of the deficit and a geriatric hospital ward may have to be be closed to
balance the books.
But although Mr Christie admits a degree of culpability for the
controversy, he insists the error made was not directly his fault and
the trust would not be in its current mess if it had not sacked him.
Mr Christie said yesterday: ''I only got a slap on the wrist for the
error. I didn't screw up. I simply didn't spot the error early enough
and then never got the chance to correct it.
''The trust knew any financial blunder would be a political hot potato
and they needed someone to blame.
''I was never sacked for the error, although the chairman is now
giving that impression. I was dismissed for a harassment complaint
against me -- a charge I still deny.''
And Mr Christie called for the resignations of his boss,
#57,000-a-year chief executive St John Hattersley, and trust chairman
Donald John MacKay.
He went on: ''Their actions have cost me my job.''
Mr Christie joined the trust in September, 1994.
He introduced monthly checks which enabled him to eliminate a #2.2m
deficit, budgeted for 1994/95 before he arrived.
However, for the following year's negotiations with the Highland
Health Board, who pay the trust #45m a year for services provided by
their 14 hospitals, Mr Christie's depute, Mr Sam Fraser was put in
charge by Mr Hattersley.
Mr Christie added: ''That draft budget was to be ultimately approved
by a working party, led by St John Hattersley. However, the bottom-line
figure was wrong and it was brought to my attention by Sam on April 5,
after the contract had been signed with the health board.
''The #1m total required for the headquarters operation in Inverness
was not included in the calculations by an office girl. That accounts
for over half of the sum quoted.
Now Mr Christie is considering his next move. He said the trust had
told him that under new Scottish Office guidelines he has no right of
appeal, although he is contesting that.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson warned that, if the Tories
won a fifth term in office, they would see Mr Michael Forsyth's teeth
and his deep hatred of local democracy.
He told the conference: ''We can expect to see the wholesale
dismantling of local authorities with more powers removed, the extension
of compulsory competitive tendering, and even more savage cash cuts.''
Mr Robertson added: ''But if the Tories want to lurch to the right,
let them. For while they are drowning in their clear blue water, Labour
will be standing up for high-quality local services and delivering the
goods against the odds.''
The Labour leader claimed the Scottish Secretary was already up to his
old tricks. His aim, quite simply, was to cut money going to local
government and blame Labour councils for any subsequent rise in council
tax. Of course, all this would come at a time when councillors were
facing the pinch largely because of a costly and unwanted council
reorganisation.
He told the delegates: ''Michael Forsyth should not lecture anyone
about waste. His party are wasting hundreds and millions of pounds on
local government reorganisation because they insisted on atomising
Scotland's councils. That's a cost to the taxpayer which, like billions
wasted on the poll tax, is lost forever.''
Nor should he lecture anyone about bureaucracy. Because of the Tories'
''insane'' internal market in health care, we now spent an extra #1000m
on administration costs while the number of managers had quadrupled.
''Of course, local councils should cut down on unnecessary
bureaucracy. So should central government. But we would profit more from
a sensible debate about local government than we do from the sort of
yahboo politics we have heard recently from the Secretary of State,'' Mr
Robertson said.

<TEXT>
A 13-YEAR-OLD boy was sentenced to five years' youth custody by an Old
Bailey judge yesterday for killing a frail refugee from Nazi persecution
during a #15 mugging he carried out with his girl cousin.
After the robbery, the pair bought cannabis which they smoked, said Mr
Robin Grey QC, prosecuting.
They boy and his cousin had stalked Eva Scheiber, 83, from an
Underground station as she went on her regular Sunday lunch visit to
friends in a West London tower block in November last year.
She had reached the top of the first flight of stairs when her handbag
was snatched.
''It caused her to lose balance and fall downstairs. She was seriously
injured as a result and died two weeks later,'' said Mr Grey.
The boy, now 14 and who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted
the manslaughter of widow Mrs Scheiber and robbing her. His 14-year-old
cousin admitted theft. She was made subject to a supervision order for
two years.
''I do hope you are deeply ashamed of what you did,'' Judge Bruce
Laughland told the boy.
''It is deeply depressing to confront in the rather awesome
surroundings of this court two children like you. This was disgraceful
behaviour for you both to indulge in. It led to awful consequences.''
He told the girl that if he had greater powers he would have passed a
much more unpleasant sentence on her, as he believed she had played a
significant part in the mugging.
The judge refused an application from the press to allow the teenagers
to be identified.
The boy, with a skinhead haircut and earring, showed no emotion as he
was led to cells from the dock. His cousin left the dock accompanied by
officials.
Mrs Scheiber, a Hungarian refugee, is reported to have fled to Britain
in the 1930s to escape persecution.
The boy's counsel, Mr Nicholas Atkinson, QC, said: ''It started out as
a mean, evil, unpleasant little offence. It escalated to this
consequence. The victim was elderly and weak, an ideal candidate for a
handbag snatch. He is as young and as small a defendant in dock as one
is likely to see.''
The girl's counsel, Mr Michael Sayers, QC, maintained: ''Whatever they
did, they did together and with their eyes open.''
During the case, the court heard from a witness that the pair showed
off the cash they had stolen to other youngsters, but then began crying
as they recalled Mrs Scheiber's horrifying fall down a flight of stairs.

BRITISH programmes dominate nominations for the prestigious
International Emmy awards for television.
Chris Evans's entertainment show Don't Forget Your Toothbrush,
holocaust documentary Anne Frank Remembered, and The Politician's Wife,
which starred Juliet Stevenson, are among those in the running for top
awards at the Gala in New York later this month.
The BBC picked up five nominations in the six programme categories,
Channel Four collected four, but the ITV companies notched up only two
-- both for programmes on Carlton.
Carlton's predecessor, Thames, is still involved in programme
production and picked up a co-nomination with the BBC.
The International Emmys are an offshoot of the awards for American
programmes made by its National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
It has already been announced that BBC director general John Birt will
gain recognition with a directorate Emmy, and Sir Peter Ustinov will be
the Gala host on November 20.
The BBC was also nominated for an International Emmy in the Children
and Young People's category for Little Lord Fauntleroy, an adaptation of
a Francis Hodgson-Burnett story about an American boy adopted by his
aristocratic English grandfather.
Other British nominations include Child of Chernobyl, (Zenith North
for Carlton UK), Bookmark -- Sex, Lies and Jerzy Kosinski (BBC), A Short
Film About Loving, (WDR, KOLN and Channel Four co-production), and Cold
Comfort Farm (BBC and Thames Television).

THE actions of some Labour-controlled councils during reorganisation
came under attack at the conference from Councillor Maureen Watt, the
Scottish National Party's vice convener for local government.
She wondered if the Tories, given that they had little chance of
controlling the new councils, had spawned these new authorities to set
traps for their opponents. The council-bashing we had already seen would
seem to suggest this, she said. Why had some of the new administrations
been so stupid as to fall into the traps?
''I am of course referring to those councils who think they can carry
on in the same sweet way they have done previously giving jobs to their
own boys (and as a woman you might notice a wry smile as I choose the
word boys), refusing to review their structures and creating as many top
committee posts as possible to maximise special responsibility payments
and all this without even consideration for politically balanced
representation,'' said Councillor Watt, of Grampian.
She said she was not against paying the going rate for the job. She
did not think senior staff salaries were inflated.
''I have been deeply distressed watching highly professional senior
executives as they frantically apply for positions in new councils. This
is an appalling way to treat hard-working staff and in that regard I
hate the whole process of transfer,'' she said.
It was okay for the Government to pay huge salaries to new quango and
health board chiefs but not okay for chief executives to get reasonable
salaries.
She went on to explain that, in the SNP, councillors from Moray,
Angus, and Perthshire and Kinross had taken part in seminars looking at
flatter structures aiming to involve many more staff in decision-making
and responsibility.
Decentralisation of delivery of services was exercising the minds of
many councils. But achieving decentralisation while containing costs was
like walking a tightrope, she told the conference.

LABOUR pledged yesterday that it would take steps to make Scottish
quangos more accountable after releasing figures which showed that
spending on them had doubled in real terms since the Tories came to
power in 1979.
Among the measures proposed by Labour would be the setting up of a
register of interests for quango members.
Scottish home affairs spokesman John McFall has used figures from the
Commons library to calculate that spending on quangos north of the
Border has increased under the Conservative Government from #3500m to
#6900m.
He said: ''These figures show how the unelected state has ballooned in
size. Scots are sick and tired of having their major public services run
by faceless, hand-picked placemen.
''These figures, based as they are on official estimates, do not even
show the full picture as they do not even include the spending that will
be undertaken by Michael Forsyth's new water quangos. If Michael Forsyth
is not prepared to take action, Labour will.''
According to Mr McFall, Labour will return Scotland's water to local
democratic control and get rid of the three new water authorities.
Labour will ask for the resignation of all members and then ask the
local councils in the areas covered by the three water authorities to
nominate for positions.
Labour would seek to ensure that all appointments to quangos were made
from a panel or committee which included an ''independent element'' and
would establish a register of the financial, political, and other
interests of all Scottish quangos, with the same system of
disqualification in cases of maladministration and misconduct as already
apply in local government.
Mr McFall said: ''We will do more than extend scrutiny over
appointments. We will take steps to improve the accountablity of
Scottish quangos.''

Speaker Betty Boothroyd urged MPs to ensure they had their facts right

MONKLANDS officials and councillors to be questioned in a new ''jobs
for the boys'' inquiry will have the services of a leading lawyer paid
for by ratepayers.
However, political opponents of the Labour controlled council
yesterday claimed the idea was ''ridiculous'' and an unneccessary
expense.
The council denied it would pay thousands of pounds for a QC or
leading advocate. A spokesman said a solicitor from a leading firm of
Edinburgh lawyers would be engaged to act for officials and councillors
specifically representing the council.
''The solicitor will accompany and advise the witnesses where
appropriate during questioning,'' he added.
Monklands SNP councillor Neil Douglas said: ''It's an unnecessary
expense. Not all that long ago, we had senior Labour party members
telling us that all was well.
''Now the ruling Labour group want to commit further expense when all
that is needed in a forum like this is to let the people speak for
themselves.
''It begs the question do they have something to hide? Are they
frightened of saying something that is going to incriminate them? The
lawyer will not act for Monklands employees appearing as individuals but
only for those representing the council.''
Mr William Nimmo-Smith, QC, is to hold a statutory inquiry into
allegations over council appointments. The public stage is due to begin
soon at the council's Coatbridge headquarters.

SIGNS of a recovery in Conservative Party fortunes during the summer
have been sharply reversed, according to a new Gallup Poll.
A snapshot survey in the Daily Telegraph today shows that Labour has
the support of 61% of voters. The Conservatives have the backing of only
21.5%.
Labour's lead of 39.5 points, has increased by fully nine-and-a-half
points since last month and is now the third largest for any party
Gallup has ever recorded.
The more extensive Gallup 9000, conducted throughout last month,
reports similar figures. According to the 9000, Labour in October had
the backing of 58.9% of the electorate compared with the Tories' 24.3%.
Labour now has a lead of 34.6, an increase since September of 6.4
points.

SCOTTISH Labour MP John McFall pledged last night that he will
continue the fight to get his animal protection Bill on to the Statute
Book.
The Bill has been dropped by the Government on a technicality, but Mr
McFall, MP for Dumbarton, yesterday attacked Ministers for refusing to
give a few seconds of parliamentary time to a Bill which would have made
it illegal to inflict torture on wild animals.
His Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill -- approved by the Commons by 253
votes to nil last March -- has run out of parliamentary time, but Mr
McFall is determined to reintroduce it in the next parliamentary
session.
He said: ''Not allowing two seconds for a Bill which has occupied a
great deal of parliamentary time since I introduced it last December is
crazy and wasteful, and it shows an astonishing degree of indifference
to the suffering inflicted on wild animals every day of the year.''
Last night, the RSPCA said it was ''disgusted'' at the outcome.
''Despite massive public support, this Bill fell at the final hurdle,''
said Kate Parminter, the RSPCA's head of public affairs.
''We are disgusted both at the wrecking tactics used to destroy this
Bill and at the lack of support from the Government.''
The Bill seeks to make it a criminal offence to ''intentionally and
cruelly kick, beat, nail or otherwise impale, burn, crush or drown any
wild animal.''
Originally, the Bill contained clauses to outlaw all hunting with
hounds or the snaring of wild mammals.
Since then, however, it has been watered down following pressure from
the bloodsports lobby to the extent that it was accepted unanimously by
the Commons and at the committee stage in the Lords.

Labour believes it cannot lose on Nolan issue.
THE income MPs earn outside Parliament is a private matter between
them and their tax inspector, the Prime Minister insisted yesterday, in
response to a determined attack from Labour leader Tony Blair, who
challenged him to explain: ''Just what do you and your party have to
hide?''
Amid Labour jeers of ''sleaze, sleaze'', Mr Major told the Commons he
rejected Lord Nolan's recommendation that MPs be forced to disclose all
outside earnings, and accused Labour of wanting to pack the House with
professional politicians.
With MPs preparing for Monday's crucial debate on anti-sleaze reforms,
when they will vote on whether or not to disclose all their income, Mr
Blair accused Mr Major of defending the ''squalid, monied interests of
the Conservative Party''.
Mr Major said the ban on paid advocacy recommended by the select
committee set up to consider the Nolan reforms was enough. ''I think
that's entirely right. I support it.
''But if we do that, the income that Honourable Members earn for other
activities, explicitly approved by Parliament, seems to me to be a
matter between them and the Inland Revenue inspectors,'' he said.
With Labour confident that it already has won the debate on principle,
Mr Blair said: ''If now, in weakness, you go back on your word to
implement the report you commissioned, it will leave a stain on your
Prime Ministership and your Government that will not be removed until
this rotten administration is swept from office.''
To jeers from Labour, Mr Major accused Mr Blair of wanting to create
professional politicians, by excluding MPs from doing anything else.
''What you are proposing is bad for the future of the House of
Commons,'' he said.
Both sides yesterday intensified their efforts to secure victory in
Monday's vote. Although MPs are technically free to vote their
consciences, party managers are making it clear that the party line is
what matters.
Mr Major declared yesterday he would back the select committee report,
and Tory whips over the weekend will concentrate on bringing into line
the 20 or so Tory MPs who have threatened to vote with Labour or
abstain. Labour, for its part, has banned all foreign trips and forced
MPs to rearrange travel plans in order to be present for the vote.
Labour is confident that it faces a win-win situation on Monday. It
will seek to defeat the Government by gaining support from the Liberal
Democrats and defecting Tories for its amendment calling for full
disclosure. It then would look to make political capital from the
revelations of how much certain Tory back benchers actually earn.
If the Government wins, a Labour source said, Labour will make sure
the country knows that Tory MPs voted to keep their earnings secret. The
party already has laid plans for a full-scale news conference on Tuesday
morning to press home their arguments, regardless of the result.
Facing Mr Major at Question Time, Mr Blair said the Prime Minister,
having set up the Nolan committee in response to the public's concern
over public sleaze, could not justify voting down the Nolan committee's
central recommendation that all MPs's earnings be declared.
Mr Major told Mr Blair: ''I think one day you will realise that these
are serious matters that deserve serious consideration -- not the sort
of short-term, party political rant we have just heard from you.
''We have gone further than Lord Nolan has on the matters that are
undesirable. Rather than say simply disclose income, we have banned the
things that we believe to be wrong.
He added: ''Parliamentary rules already require all outside interests
to be entered in a register. That will continue. It will be published
more regularly. But the substantive point is clear. If it is wrong, it
shouldn't be done and the select committee propose to ban the things
that are wrong.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown wrote to Mr Major, challenging
him to exert his leadership and back disclosure. ''You must understand
that if Conservative MPs oppose full disclosure on Monday, you will not
just damage the Conservative Party, but far more importantly you will
undermine respect for Parliament and confidence in our political
system,'' he said.
RULES of procedure for Ministers are to be tightened after Lord
Nolan's report on public standards, the Government announced last night.
Public Service Minister Roger Freeman, in the Commons, set out a
revised wording of the Questions of Procedure for Ministers agreed with
the Prime Minister.For the first time it defines how Ministers can
withhold information only in exceptional circumstances.
During a debate on Lord Nolan's first report, as it effects Ministers
and government, Mr Freeman said the directive would read that:
''Ministers must not knowingly mislead Parliament and the public and
should correct any inadvertent errors at the earliest opportunity.''
Shadow Public Service Minister Derek Foster, until recently Labour's
long-standing Chief Whip, raised the question of two former Ministers
who he said had recently taken up ''lucrative'' business appointments.
Former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had gone to Natwest ''for a sum
rumoured to be #200,000 or so for a three-day week'' and ex-Trade
Minister Richard Needham had joined ''his long-standing friend and
patron Lord Prior at GEC for over #100,000''.
Mr Foster told the House: ''What is disturbing is that both claim to
have voluntarily submitted themselves to the Advisory Committee on
Business Appointments.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Robert Maclennan said he wanted to see
applicants for top public posts scrutinised by Commons select
committees.
Mr Maclennan supported Lord Nolan's suggestion that Ministers should
wait three months before taking up outside appointments.
Later, Labour's Civil Service spokesman Peter Mandelson, speaking from
the Front Bench for the first time, claimed the Government was ''mired
in sleaze''. However, he praised the Prime Minister for setting up the
Nolan committee in the first place.
Mr Mandelson, a Blair aide and former party ''spin-doctor'', told the
House that Mr Major had acted properly but now had been caught on the
horns of a dilemma between public concern about the conduct of MPs and
the wrath of Tory back benchers.
Replying to the same debate, Mr Freeman insisted the Government had
given a ''whole-hearted response'' to Nolan.
''Lord Nolan is not God. To assume somehow that everything Lord Nolan
and his committee do must be taken literally is foolish,'' he said.

A CABINET Minister has suggested that MPs should retire at 60, and
called for their numbers to be halved.
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Roger Freeman makes his outspoken
remarks in an interview on Channel 4's The People's Parliament to be
screened on Saturday.
However, a rule forcing MPs to retire at 60 would have cut short the
careers of Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, who is 62, and
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew, 66. Mr Freeman is 53.
Mr Freeman also insists that there are too many MPs. He says: ''This
is a personal view, the Government doesn't have a view on this, but I
think that we would be a more efficient Parliament with perhaps half the
number and I do believe that it would be sensible for a smaller number
of members of Parliament to have more resources at their disposal to
bring the executive to account.''
Mr Freeman also calls for younger MPs and more women MPs and admitted
the Labour Party was more successful than his own party in selecting
female candidates.
''I very much welcome the addition of more women into Parliament.''

THE Government last night hit back at claims that a nationwide
anti-measles campaign was responsible for injuring and crippling
children.
At least 20 families are considering legal action against the
Government following allegations that anti-measles injections caused
serious side-effects in some children, including brain damage.
However, Health Minister Tom Sackville told the Commons that most of
the reported adverse reactions to vaccinations were either ''trivial or
unlikely to be caused by the vaccine''.
He was responding in a short debate to Labour's Llew Smith, MP for
Blaenau Gwent, who demanded a ''full public inquiry'' into the issue.
The mass vaccinations followed forecasts from public health
specialists that an epidemic could infect up to 200,000 and cause 50
child deaths.
Mr Smith said: ''There was no evidence to support the claim of an
epidemic. How did the Health Department arrive at this conclusion?''
However, Mr Sackville replied that an epidemic was already present in
parts of Scotland and so it was decided to implement the campaign in
November 1994.

STRATHCLYDE region is to become the second Scottish local authority to
record classroom assaults on teachers.
It has reached agreement in principle with the teachers' unions on a
system to monitor threats and violence against teachers.
The authority's senior depute director of education, Mr David
Alexander, said yesterday: ''People think there has been an upsurge in
violence against teachers, but the problem has been that no-one knew
because there wasn't a way of accurately recording the number of
incidents.
''Threats and violence against teachers are unacceptable to the
teaching unions and to the authority.''
Although the precise detail of the system is to be worked out, it is
likely to involve head teachers recording incidents when they are going
through standard school procedures for excluding pupils who have
threatened or assaulted teachers and other staff.
Mr Drew Morrice, convener of the Educational Institute of Scotland in
Strathclyde, welcomed the agreement, but added: ''Monitoring is fine as
one part of the response to the issue, but it will be useful only if it
leads to identification of the scale of the problem, and to strategies
to prevent violence against staff.''
Monitoring in Strathclyde could begin in January.
In Tayside, the only authority which presently records violence
against staff, the latest statistics indicate that one teacher in 70 can
expect to be a victim of pupil assaults each year.

A #9M project to help regenerate the fortunes of one of Scotland's
best known east coast seaside towns was revealed yesterday.
The plan for Dunbar in East Lothian, a once thriving fishing port and
tourism centre, includes the conversion of an old building at the
harbour into hostel accommodation for divers in an effort to capitalise
on the town's popularity as a diving centre.
The three-year programme is aimed at revitalising the former popular
holiday resort and includes housing and tourism moves and environmental
improvements. It is hoped it will create about 400 jobs and help attract
1300 new residents.
Although badly hit by the decline of the traditional industries of
agriculture, fishing and tourism, the construction of the Torness
nuclear power station nearby provided a temporary cushion for the town
from the full economic effects of the run down.
However, in recent years the tourist trade in particular has suffered.
Locals believe the much-criticised road and rail network to the town
from Edinburgh, which they believe should be upgraded, has not helped.
East Lothian councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents Dunbar, said:
''Dunbar has suffered like many seaside towns by the fact that more and
more people are taking package holidays abroad.
''I would hope the projects announced today will help the town and
bring more people to it.''
The new package, relates to 12 specific projects and programmes, put
together by various local funding bodies, including Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd.
Among the projects are the redevelopment of a former hotel site into
flats for 34 local people, environmental improvements in the town's high
street and a new review of tourism strategy.
Dr Des Bonnar, chief executive of LEEL said: ''This is an exciting new
phase in the development of Dunbar which holds out the prospect of
better times ahead for the town and its residents.
''We are commited to working for the economic regeneration of the town
in partnership with the other members of the initiative.''
Scottish Homes district manager Coinneach MacLean said they were
committed to provide #1.38m to set up four housing projects in the town.
Funding bodies point to the new swimming pool and leisure centre, two
city-centre housing redevelopments and improvements to the harbour area
as some of the projects in place which will help improve conditions in
the town.

A HARBOURMASTER accused of ruling a Scottish port with a ''rod of
iron'' has won his claim for unfair dismissal from the #25,000-a-year
job.
Former Shell tanker skipper, Captain Alex Madden, 55, was accused of
upsetting existing and potential customers of Scrabster harbour at
Thurso with his confrontational manner and ''bull in a china shop''
attitude to harbour business.
Harbour trust chairman Geoffrey Minter, 53, told the Inverness
tribunal: ''It's easy to order people about on a ship, but not so in a
business world. You have to have regard of people.''
But Captain Madden, who was praised for his technical skills as
harbourmaster, said he was just trying to educate harbour users in new
EU rules on safety and the environment.
And yesterday, the tribunal told the harbour trust it had no valid
reason to sack the ex-mariner, and ordered them to pay him #11,000 --
the maximum compensation -- plus a basic award of #900.
Captain Madden said at his home in Culduthel Road, Inverness, he was
''absolutely elated'' by the result.
He added that he might have been unpopular among some fishermen for
setting up a night surveillance operation at the port to detect the
illegal landing of under-the-counter ''black fish''.
He also claimed that since his departure last November there had been
''irregularities'' in the running of the harbour and he had asked local
MP Robert MacLennan to investigate.

THE mother of Annan fire victim Elizabeth McPhillips, who died along
with her two children and another child, yesterday called for stricter
regulations and fire warnings on carpets.
Mrs Rosemary Slee and her husband Nigel, of Newbie, Annan, said they
were horrified when they had experimented with a piece of carpet similar
to that which was in the rooms where Elizabeth, 17, and the three
children died in February.
''We got the same kind of carpet about the same time and, after
hearing the evidence about how it burned and how it helped fuel the
fire, we decided to try it ourselves,'' said the couple at the end of
the fatal accident inquiry in Dumfries.
''We were absolutely horrified by the result and the way it burned,
and we will be throwing our carpets out,'' she added.
The inquiry into the deaths of Elizabeth, her nine-month-old son John
and 21-month-old daughter Sarah; along with a friend's six-month-old
daughter,Sophie Reid, heard how the victims were in the living room and
in an upstairs bedroom.
Fire officer Stuart Irving had already told how the carpet, which was
only in the two rooms, had fuelled the fire and there had only been two
small traces of the carpet, a phenomenon which he and other officers had
never seen before.
Mr Martin Shipp from the Fire Research Station at Watford, confirmed
the fire brigade evidence that the carpet had contributed to the speed
of the spread of the fire.
Dr Graham Adam, the police doctor called in after the house fire in
February at Shawhill Court, Annan, said that all four would have died
very quickly from smoke, and not from the burns they had received in the
fire.
Sheriff Kenneth Barr said that, judging from the evidence he had
heard, people must be made aware of trying to dry clothes at a fire, and
fiscal Stuart MacFarlane said people must make sure the smoke detectors
were working.
During the evidence it was revealed that no trace of batteries had
been found in the remains of the two smoke detectors in the hall and
landing of the house.
The sheriff will give a written determination later.

OFFERS close at noon today for the Post Office building which Glasgow
Development Agency wants to buy and turn into a National Gallery of
Scottish Art and Design.
The original deadline for bids was extended in controversial
circumstances a fortnight ago, but it is understood the number of
interested parties has not changed since.
The GDA, which offered #3m, is again likely to be well outbid by two
property developers in the private sector.
However, there will be no immediate announcement of the winner today.
It is understood that Morrison Developments, who want to turn the
building into an office block, has upped its bid from #3.5m to #5m.
Such an offer would smash the offer by original front-runner Jarlaw,
an Aberdeen-based property developer whose proposals include shops,
flats, offices, and restaurants.
Jarlaw has called on Scottish Office Ministers to block any sale until
its concerns over the Post Office's eleventh-hour decision to extend the
deadline are resolved.
The company alleges it has been prejudiced, treated unfairly, and ''in
a manner not normally associated with the disposal of surplus Government
property''.

AN 83-year-old man who discharged a shotgun and injured an intruder on
his allotment must pay damages, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday.
Mr Ted Newbery, of Ilkeston, Derbyshire, had his appeal against
damages turned down, but the three judges agreed he had the right to
defend his property.
Lord Justice Millet, rejecting the appeal, said: ''Violence may be
returned with necessary violence, but the force used must not exceed the
limits of what is reasonable in the circumstances.''
The judge sitting with Lords Justices Neill and Evans considered that
by firing a 12-bore shotgun through a hole in his shed door Mr Newbery
had acted in a manner which was ''clearly dangerous and bordered on
reckless''.
The intruder, Mark Revill, now 29, was hit in the right arm and chest
and seriously injured. He was left with 50 pellets embedded in his body
and lost much of the use of that arm.
Mr Newbery insisted last night that he would do the same again in
similar circumstances.
''All I did was protect my property and myself and I'd do the same
again,'' 83-year-old Ted Newbery is quoted as saying in the Sun
newspaper.
''The law is ridiculous. It's upside down. I always thought an
Englishman's home was his castle and you could protect it if someone
tried to smash their way in,'' he said.
''This whole thing has been nothing but a worry for me and my wife
Millicent. When it happened I was just 77 and now I'm nearly 84. It's
just taken over my entire life. There's not a single day goes by when I
don't worry about it.''
''I just feel as though this man has got away with something that he
shouldn't,'' said Mr Newbery.
''I was found not guilty at court and I thought that was the end of
it. I can't believe that he had the cheek to take me to court and sue me
for damages.''
Mr Newbery thanked the hundreds of well-wishers who had supported his
case and he said: ''I know I'm not bad. Now I just want to get on with
my life in peace.''
Mr Newbery had taken to sleeping in his brick-built allotment shed,
100-yards from his home, because he had been frightened and incensed by
a spate of thefts and vandalism in the area.
When he was disturbed from sleep by Revill and another man trying to
break in to the shed he poked the gun barrel through the door and fired.
Mr Newbery was charged with wounding, but acquitted. Revill later
pleaded guilty to various offences he had committed that night.
Revill then sued Mr Newbery for compensation and last December High
Court judge Mr Justice Rougier said the pensioner had used force out of
all proportion to the threat involved.
The judge assessed damages at #12,100 but held Revill two thirds to
blame for the 1988 incident and cut the amount to #4033 plus #320
interest. He also awarded Mr Newbery #400 on his counter claim against
Mr Revill for the nervous shock he suffered.

THE leader of the Moonies yesterday withdrew his application for entry
to Britain.
Solicitors acting for the Rev Sun Myung Moon, leader of the
Unification Church, said it was not practicable at this late stage to
make representations to Home Secretary Michael Howard.
Mr Moon was scheduled to arrive in the UK today as part of a tour of
European countries, but was banned by Mr Howard.
However, a High Court judge ruled on Wednesday that Mr Howard acted
unlawfully because he had not given Mr Moon the chance to make
representations against the ban.
Mr David Coombs, the solicitor acting for Mr Moon, said in a letter to
Mr Howard: ''It will not now be practicable for us to make
representations . . . and have them properly considered by you in time
for the Reverend Moon to travel to the United Kingdom on Friday as he
had intended.
''Regrettably, it will therefore not be possible for the Reverend Moon
to come to the United Kingdom.''
Mr Howard had defended his decision to bar the Rev Moon and warned
that the ban would not be lifted.
He warned of the misery caused to families when people joined the
Moonies and said: ''The ban is still in force. I do not intend to set it
aside.''
Under the ruling, he was obliged to look at any representations made
against the ban.
But Mr Mark Brann, president of the Unification Church in Britain,
wrote to Mr Howard yesterday, saying: ''To judge by your reaction to the
High Court decision, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that in
the present circumstances whatever representations may be made to you,
you would be unwilling to comply with either the spirit or the letter of
the High Court decision.''
Mr Howard said no Home Secretary had ever taken representations from
the person he was banning, yet it was this which had upset the judge.

A FATAL accident inquiry is to be held into the death of a pensioner
who lay undiscovered in the toilet of his doctor's surgery for 30 hours
after suffering a stroke.
The inquiry into the death of 86-year-old Mr John Ross has been
revealed by the family's lawyer. It will be held at Kirkcaldy Sheriff
Court on December 1.
Mr David Ritchie said: ''The family are pleased that there will be a
full investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr Ross's death.''
Mr Ross, a retired docker, of Sea Road, Methil, went missing on August
1 after leaving home to collect a prescription for his wife at the
nearby Muiredge Surgery of Dr Robert Dunn and partners.
When he failed to return home, a police search involving his sons was
launched, but there was no trace of him.
The next evening a member of staff found him in the toilet of the
surgery and it was realised he had lain there for 30 hours undiscovered
by staff when the premises were closed the previous night, or by
cleaners the following morning.
A statement later issued on behalf of the practice's four doctors
admitted: ''Procedures for checking and securing the practice were not
followed and the reasons for this will be thoroughly investigated.''
Mr Ross put up a brave fight for life, but lost his battle in
Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital on August 9.
Following an investigation, Fife Health Board last month called for a
strict new code of conduct in doctors' premises.

A RECORD 21 million overseas tourists visited the UK last year -- 8%
more than in 1993 -- spending #9009m.
During the same period, 1.8 million foreign visitors came to Scotland
-- an increase of 6% -- and spent #768m, recording a 14% rise on 1993.
The good performance hoisted Britain into fifth place in the world
tourism league behind the United States, France, Spain and Italy.
However, while the figures appeared to give cause for celebration, a
senior tourism official warned that Britain could not afford to be
complacent given the present growth rates of its tourism competitors.
The Consumers' Association magazine, Holiday Which? also insisted that
the BTA report should not be a reason for ''back patting''.
The statistics revealed yesterday in the British Tourist Authority's
annual report, confirmed that the #9009m spent by overseas tourists
during 1994 was 6% more than the previous year.
The US supplied the most visitors -- 2.97m -- who spent the most money
-- #1008m.
The Scottish Tourist Board is expecting this year will yield even
better figures, mainly because of interest created by films such as
Braveheart and Rob Roy.
Mr Tom Buncle, the STB's director of overseas marketing, said Scotland
had benefitted from the increasing demand worldwide for destinations
with strong cultural traditions and from a greater interest in ''green,
environmentally friendly destinations''.
Scotland also was cashing in on the increased demand for activity
holidays such as watersports, fishing and golf.
The report showed that the Japanese came to Britain for the tea,
Swedes came mainly for the beer, which was cheaper than their own, the
French enjoyed the culture, while the Spanish sought the peace and
tranquility of British golf courses.
The Dutch, on the other hand visited Britain for motorcycling breaks,
Norwegian women came over to get away from husbands and boyfriends,
while the Belgians, like the Americans, came for the shopping.
However, BTA chairman Ms Adele Biss warned that a lack of public funds
could hinder the UK's attempt to tap the lucrative Far Eastern market.
She said steps should be taken to establish a stronger presence in new
markets such as Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia.

FREDERICK West attempted to carry out an abortion in a Gloucestershire
wood on the Coatbridge woman who was to become his first wife,
Winchester Crown Court heard yesterday.
He attempted the operation because he was told his wife-to-be Rena was
going to give birth to a half-caste child.
The jury heard the abortion bid went wrong and the police became
involved -- possibly from information provided by a doctor.
The evidence was read in court from a written statement made by Mrs
Margaret Clarke, who had kept watch at Doghill Wood near Leadbury while
Fred West attempted to abort the child.
In the statement Mrs Clarke said Rena and Fred were at that time
besotted with each other. Because the abortion failed they decided to
get married and moved to Scotland.
The jury has been told that Charmaine West was born in Alexandra
Hospital, Coatbridge in 1963.
In her statement the witness described how years later she saw
Frederick West sexually abuse Charmaine in a caravan after he and Rena
had returned to Gloucester in 1969.
He was lying on a bed and was not wearing a shirt, but had pyjama
bottoms or trousers on.
He placed Charmaine, who was not wearing underpants, on his chest and
was moving her up and down his body. He pulled the little girl over his
groin area. As he was doing this he made suggestive comments.
A male witness described how, when staying for a night or two in Fred
West's caravan, he was shown black and white photographs of women's
genitals.
Mr Terence Crick said that Fred West had boasted of conducting
operations on the women. He was also shown numerous dirty implements
which Fred West said were used to perform abortions.
The jury has heard that Charmaine disappeared in 1971, when she was
eight.
Her body was unearthed from the kitchen area of a flat at 25 Midland
Road, Gloucester, where Fred West had set up home with his second wife.
Rosemary West is accused of Charmaine's murder and that of nine other
young girls and women.
The Crown has suggested that at the time Charmaine disappeared and was
murdered Fred West was in prison.
The jury also heard evidence that Ann McFall, a young babysitter for
Rena and Fred West was heavily pregnant with his child when she was last
seen.
The remains of Rena West and Ann McFall were recovered last year from
separate fields some distance from Gloucester as the investigation into
murders at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, continued.
Yesterday a woman broke down in the witness box -- haunted by an image
from the past.
Janette Clarke, wearing dark glasses and seated in the witness box,
described how she dropped mugs of coffee on the floor when a picture of
Fred West flashed on her television screen last year.
She recognised Fred West as the man who tried to abduct her on two
occasions in 1966 when she was 16.
Asked to describe the events leading up to the first alleged abduction
Mrs Clarke burst into tears.
It was some minutes before she could continue her story. Periodically
she wept as she told the jury what had happened to her.
The first alleged abduction had taken place as she returned home from
work at an egg factory. The police were called and they insisted she
continue her normal routine.
''I pleaded with them that I didn't want to go to work,'' said the
witness.
However, they insisted she should and no member of her family should
attempt to meet her at the bus stop. They would keep a close watch, and
no harm would come to her.
Two nights later Mrs Clarke described how the same car driver
attempted to abduct her.
Shown a picture of Fred West, Mrs Clarke declared: ''Oh God! That's
him, that's the man.''
She was one of a series of witnesses who described assaults and
attempted abductions conducted by Fred West allegedly acting alone in
the mid-1960s and 70s.
Other witnesses gave accounts of similar attacks. Two when they were
just schoolgirls.
The defence alleges on each occasion Fred West acted alone.
In the course of this evidence Mr Justice Mantell said it was
extremely distressing for witnesses to come into court and that had
already been demonstrated.
He suggested that if accounts were not being disputed, it might be
better if an arrangement could be made between defence and prosecution.
Following an adjournment, evidence of other witnesses who had been
expected to be called were read from statements.
The jury also heard how Mary Bastholm, who went missing in 1968, had
been seen on various occasions with someone resembling Frederick West.
The jury has been told that this disappearance had been investigated
by officers involved in the Cromwell Street inquiry, but there was no
evidence which would enable charges to be brought.
A witness described how the girl worked in a transport cafe, known as
the Pop-In cafe.
One of the regular visitors to the cafe, who knew Mary, was a young
girl.
Mrs Wendy Cox told the court that the girl had a strong Scottish
accent and her name was Ann. The defence claim this could have been Ann
McFall.
The trial continues.

THE Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay cannot halt the sale of the late Fred
West's memoirs for the benefit of his family even though he regards such
a move as ''repulsive'', according to Tory MP Douglas French, who
discussed the issue with him yesterday.
A figure of #1m has already been mentioned in relation to the sale.
Mr French, MP for Gloucester, has sponsored a Commons motion, signed
by some 20 of his colleagues, expressing ''extreme distaste'' at the
plan.
The MPs suggest that if it went ahead the proceeds should go not to
members of the West family, but to the families of victims of the
alleged murders.
Peter Harris, the Official Solicitor, acting on behalf of Fred West's
estate, has commissioned a ''definitive'' account of the Gloucester
builder's life, drawing on statements he made to police and an attempt
that West made at an autobiography before he was found hanged in prison
on New Year's Day.
Mr French said after the meeting: ''The Lord Chancellor very clearly
shares the public distaste for this deal. But he cannot see any way to
intervene because he believes that the Official Solicitor is correctly
interpreting his duties. However, he says that the copyright of part of
the material does rest, in his opinion, with the Gloucestershire
Constabulary.''
Lord Mackay suggested that Mr French discussed with the Home
Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, a formula to prevent criminals or their
families profiting from their crimes.
One way of doing it, Mr French said, was to make it unlawful for any
publisher or intermediary to offer money to criminals or their families
to purchase their memoirs.
The Prime Minister has already branded the deal negotiated on behalf
of the children of Fred and Rose West, as ''extremely distasteful''.
Gloucestershire Chief Constable Tony Butler said the force was
urgently seeking legal advice over the book plan.
* The Official Solicitor represents the interests of children, the
mentally ill and anyone else deemed incapable of defending their legal
rights.

MR Michael Thompson, of Carron Place, Ardgay, died in Raigmore

THE runner who finished seventh out of more than 3000 in a city-centre
marathon has admitted that he ran only three of the race's 26 miles.
MrLiam Rowe, 36, from County Kilkenny, has been ordered to hand back a
plaque he received for completing the Dublin run, and faces a possible
ban from future events.
Mr Rowe admitted his shorter-than-it-seemed marathon in an agreed
statement with the organisers of the race last Monday.
He said yesterday: ''I realise it was a mistake to do what I did. I
ran so hard over the three miles that I felt dizzy afterwards and had to
sit down.''
Mr Rowe's bid to pull a fast one was spotted when he finished in front
of established runners, ending the race in the creditable time of two
hours and 25 minutes.
One of the men he beat, Irish international marathon runner Noel
Richardson, said: ''I thought he was some kind of joker but he stayed in
front of me to the finish.''
Mr Rowe's ruse was discovered after an investigation involving
stewards positioned along the course.
Mr Jim Aughney, chairman of the committee that organised the race,
said: ''We had so much evidence that Mr Rowe made a full admission.
''I am disappointed that a person should have tried this. We certainly
make a big effort to see that all those who finish in the leading
positions are above board.''
Mr Rowe said: ''I got carried away with the atmosphere and when I saw
the crowd around the course I just wanted to join in the excitement. I
love running.''

PHOSPHOROUS sticks washed up on the Clyde coast in recent weeks were

Michael Portillo revealed yesterday in a letter to MPs.
The announcement follows parliamentary pressure on the Government to
halt gas pipeline operations on the seabed of the North Channel because
of fears that munitions dumped in the Irish Sea would be disturbed.
MoD experts initially hesitated to identify the devices, but have now
said they are from 30lb incendiary air bombs, the casings of which have
corroded away.
Mr Portillo said: ''The Clyde Submarine Base Clearance Diving Unit
will undertake clearance work for as long as it is required.''

<TEXT>
A PATIENT'S wounds were stitched by a 17-year-old work experience
student, a hospital trust admitted yesterday.
The Bradford Hospitals Trust has launched an inquiry into why the
A-level student -- working in Bradford Royal Infirmary for the past two
months -- was allowed to stitch wounds under the supervision of medical
staff.
A senior house officer showed the teenager how to perform the task,
and watched as he put two stitches in a woman's leg.
When the woman returned a week later to the casualty department with
another leg wound, the student put in three stitches while being
supervised by a staff nurse who thought he was a trainee doctor.
Hospital spokesman Mr Malcolm Poad said: ''While suturing is a very
minor procedure, Bradford Hospitals Trust is taking this matter very
seriously.
''We have a professional and very dedicated staff in the accident and
emergency department who set themselves high standards. This is an
isolated incident and we are sorry that on this occasion a rare error of
judgment has been made.''
Mr Poad claimed the student was ''mature and competent'' and had been
attending weekly voluntary sessions at the hospital's casualty
department for about two months, spending several hours each time.
''The senior housing officer supervising the boy on the first
occasion, on October 20, allowed him to put a couple of stitches in the
patient's leg, with the patient's approval,'' said Mr Poad.
A week later the patient, thought to be from Halifax, West Yorkshire,
returned to the hospital for three more stitches in a separate wound on
her leg.
''The lad offered to do some suturing. The male nurse asked if he was
trained to do it, believing he was a trainee on the department. He said
'Yes' and the patient said that he had treated her the week before,''
said Mr Poad.
The surgery on both occasions had worked perfectly, Mr Poad stressed.
He added that the members of staff involved have been interviewed and
are to be disciplined.
The patient and her doctor have been contacted and given a ''full
explanation and apology'', and similar work experience placements have
been suspended, pending a full review of the way the students are
managed.
Labour MP for Bradford West Mr Max Madden said: ''I am very pleased to
learn that this scheme has been halted by the hospital trust. I will be
contacting the chief executive and will be asking for a full explanation
as to the circumstances and why this boy was offered work experience.''
But he said the doctor and nurse at the centre of the row should not
be made scapegoats for the trust.
Mr Poad said work experience placements for A-level students seeking a
career in medicine were arranged through the trust's personnel
department in conjunction with the school concerned.
Such students were allowed, with a member of staff, to go into the
casualty department ''purely to observe''.
The teenager involved in the incidents attends a Bradford school and
is hoping to study at medical school next year if he passes his
A-levels.

<HEADLINE>Village divided over mountain emergency service's plan for headquarters. Split over rescue base proposal</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GLENCOE villagers are divided over plans by their world-famous
mountain rescue team to build its first proper headquarters.
The team is one of the busiest in Scotland and was officially formed
nearly 30 years ago, yet it has never had its own base.
Currently, it keeps its two vehicles, with much vital equipment
inside, in the local police station yard.
The team thought it had found the solution when it applied for
permission to build a base, including a meeting room, garage and store,
on a piece of private land beside a public car park.
Although the proposal attracted a number of objections, including ones
from the community council and from a householder whose cottage is next
to the site, members of the Lochaber divisional planning committee
approved the scheme by four votes to three after a site visit.
But many local people have now signed a petition against the plan. The
development is also opposed by the local Highland regional councillor
who is asking the council's full planning committee to overturn the
decision when it next meets on December 6.
Yesterday, team leader John Grieve said: ''I am staggered by the
objections. I do not know why they are getting quite so worked up about
it. It is something we sorely need for operational reasons. We have
tried to find other sites, but there is none available.''
The proposed building was a sympathetic design produced by an
award-winning architect, he said.
''The point is that planning permission already exists for a dwelling
house on the same site, and our building would be no bigger. So that
knocks down a lot of the objections.''
Another problem cited by objectors was that the team's need for access
through the car park to the base would mean the loss of some parking
spaces.
''The car park is unmarked at present but the region has agreed to
mark it out properly and that means more spaces would be created than
would be lost.''
Mr Grieve added: ''The divisional planning committee took the view
that our work was of sufficient importance to allow this to be built.
But there seems to be a core of vociferous objectors.
''Most mountain rescue teams get a lot of support from their local
communities but we do not seem to be getting that in this instance. They
say that we are a great bunch of people but that this site is not the
right place for our base.''
Indeed, those were almost exactly the words used by objectors who
spoke to The Herald last night. All stressed their support for the work
of the team but said the site was unsuitable.
A spokesman said: is, Mr Arthur Smith, chairman of Ballachulish and
Glencoe Community Council, said some locals have organised a petition
against the development and ''something like 80% of the village'' had
signed it. He added: ''What they are saying is please choose somewhere
else.''
Local regional councillor Albert Robertson, who is asking the full
planning committee to rescind the divisional committee's decision, said:
''Everybody agrees that the team are doing a great job and are very busy
throughout the year. We appreciate them being on hand and want them to
have a base, but not there.''
Hamish MacInnes, the internationally-renowned mountaineer who led the
Glencoe team until stepping down last year, is in two minds about the
plan.
He said last night: ''For many years there has been a need for a
proper base with a garage. But I do not think the site they have got is
the best one. Quite a lot of local people are objecting and I can see
their point of view.
''The proposed site is in a fairly prominent place. What is needed is
a site that is agreeable to everyone, but sites are difficult to come
by.''
Dr Michael Foxley, chairman of the divisional planning committee and
vice-chairman of the region's full planning committee, backed the scheme
despite some reservations.
''On balance, I supported it because the site already had planning
permission for a house. I was concerned about the impact on the
neighbour's property, but the precedent was already set.''

SURGEON Mr Debabarta Chatterjee was sacked last night from his post as
part-time consultant at Daliburgh Hospital in South Uist for
professional misconduct.
The Western Isles Health Board took the decision after a four-hour
special meeting in private. The dismissal takes effect immediately.
In a brief statement, the board said that it had reached its decision
after considering the report of an investigating panel set up to carry
out an independent inquiry into the circumstances of an incident in
which Mr Chatterjee had been involved.
The board made no further comment, although it is understood that the
professional misconduct concerned an operation on a patient.
Mr Chatterjee set up in general practice in South Uist in 1982 and
then was appointed part-time consultant surgeon at Daliburgh Hospital.
He was in dispute with the health board in 1984 and the wrangle lasted
for four years.
Mr Chatterjee, 58, is believed to be the highest paid doctor in the
Western Isles, between his GP practice and his part-time surgeon post.
His wife is also a GP in the same practice.
In May 1984 the board decided to terminate his appointment, primarily
on the grounds of breach of contract. Mr Chatterjee claims that he was
there to do only surgical work and not to act as a clinical assistant in
other medical areas.
He appealed against the board's decision and in May 1986 the Secretary
of State upheld his appeal. He was finally reinstated in 1988, but it
was later agreed that only acute emergency cases be dealt with at
Daliburgh and the health board then considered a list of options
regarding surgical cover for the Uists.
It was agreed to go for a new hospital at Balivanich, in Benbecula,
with surgeon cover being provided from a GP practice in Benbecula where
a qualifed surgeon, anaesthetist and obstetrician would also undertake
GP duties.
There were 19 applications for the post of part-time consultant
surgeon but Mr Chatterjee did not apply.
Dr Chatterjee was not available for comment last night.

THE head of the public school Dulwich College, Mr Anthony Verity,
resigned yesterday after governors found he had an ''inappropriate
relationship'' with his secretary.
In a statement, they said they did not find allegations of sexual
harassment against Mr Verity were sustained, but he had allowed an
''inappropriate relationship to develop''.
They said Mr Verity, 56, -- who had denied the allegations -- would
take early retirement from his #100,000-a-year post at the south-east
London school.
There were no details about a cash settlement and, after an eight-hour
meeting with the governors, Mr Verity said he was not allowed to
comment.
His resignation ends speculation over the headmaster's future after
his secretary, Mrs Anne Ridley, 38, made allegations of sexual
harassment against him relating to a business trip to Thailand.
In their statement, the governors said they ''did not find these
allegations to be sustained on the evidence''.
''They did, however, come to the view that Mr Verity permitted an
inappropriate relationship to develop and that this affected the
performance of his duties. Accordingly, the governors have agreed a
financial package with Mr Verity in line with his decision to take early
retirement. Mrs Anne Ridley has left the college on mutually agreed
terms.''
There has been speculation that any pay-off to the head could amount
to as much as #500,000 on the basis that Mr Verity could have continued
at the college for four years.
Last night's meeting was the third the former head and governors of
the #12,270-a-year school had held to try and settle the row, which led
to a number of parents at the 1400-boy college launching a vigorous
campaign calling for his reinstatement.

A TINY Highland church has been surprised by a bequest of #200,000,
which a relative of the deceased said is a mistake.
Former farm labourer and distillery worker Mr Edward Holt, 80,
remembered the old church in his home village of Craigellachie, on
Speyside, when he died in July in his adopted town of Paisley, after a
successful business career there.
An 86-year-old sister, who received only #1000 in her unmarried
brother's will, said: ''It's all a mistake. He never intended the church
should get so much.
''It should have been a couple of thousand, not a couple of hundred
thousand.''
After making bequests of #1000 each to two sisters in England and a
brother in Canada, the only survivors of 11 brothers and sisters, Mr
Holt left the ''residue'' of his estate to the church.
However, Miss Barbara Holt, a retired Air Force officer, said at her
Hampshire home: ''Eddie never thought for one moment he was going to die
so soon. He was a healthy, fit man -- but knew at some later stage in
his life, because he lived alone, he would have to go into an expensive
nursing home to be looked after.
''That was what the money was earmarked for. We were in regular touch
by phone and he thought there would only be about a couple of thousand
or so left for the church.''
Miss Holt said that only a few months before his death in his sleep at
his home in Acre Crescent, Paisley, he had changed his will to cover his
expected nursing costs. Before that, she and her brother and sister were
to get much more than #1000 each.
Mr Bill Iley, of Thorndean, Elderslie, a friend of Mr Holt, said:
''It's odd that all his money should go to the Kirk, because it was the
Methodist church he supported in Paisley.''
The minister of Aberlour and Craigellachie churches, the Rev Ken
Walker, said: ''I could not believe my ears when Mr Holt's lawyer phoned
me up. I thought it was a wind-up.

A TEENAGE schoolgirl broke down in tears yesterday as she claimed she
had been indecently assaulted in a classroom by her teacher.
The girl was 14-years-old at the time she alleged the incident
happened in a West Lothian school after she asked for help to operate a
metalwork machine.
She told Linlithgow Sheriff Court that she watched as Mr Leonard Hart,
50, moved across to repeat the attack on her 13-year-old friend after
she had shrugged him off.
''I got a fright. I kind of froze. I just didn't know what was
happening. It felt weird,'' she said.
The girl claimed that Mr Hart, from Edinburgh, put his arms across her
chest and pulled her towards him until he was touching her at the back.
She complained to her mother that night and the school's headteacher
the following day.
But it was another 24 hours after she complained to the headteacher
before she could bring herself to describe the full incident.
She bottled up the details until she was interviewed in her home by a
police officer.
She explained to the court: ''I felt dirty and ashamed.''
Mr Hart denies two charges of indecently assaulting schoolgirl pupils
in the classroom in March last year.
The girl claimed that the attacks took place in an L-shaped room while
she and her classmate were working on a machine round the corner and out
of sight of another 24 pupils in the class.
Her classmate, who claimed to be Mr Hart's second victim of the day,
told in her evidence of the look of horror on the first victim's face
when the teacher had stood behind her.
She told the court: ''I saw the expression on her face. She was
shocked. That's how I knew he was doing something to harm her.''
The trial was adjourned until November 14.

WORLD Boxing Council championship contender Lennox Lewis yesterday
launched a High Court bid for an injunction halting the body from
sanctioning a title bout between Frank Bruno and Mike Tyson.
Lewis is protesting against Bruno's plans to defend his heavyweight
crown against Tyson, who was released from jail seven months ago.
His counsel, Mr Michael Beloff QC, told Mr Justice Rattee that Lewis
asserted his right to challenge Bruno for one of the richest prizes in
international sport by reason of a WBC decision properly taken under its
rules and fortified by a contract between them.
Mr Beloff said the WBC was threatening to renege on its decision and
act in breach of contract and Bruno was interfering with Lewis's
contractual rights. He wanted the position frozen until a full trial of
the issues.
If a fight between Bruno and Tyson went ahead, then Lewis would have
lost forever his chance to recapture the heavyweight crown.
Such a loss would be incompensatible in damages, said Mr Beloff.
Mr Beloff said Lewis had beaten Bruno previously and fancied his
chances again. He also fancied Tyson's chances against Bruno and
believed if Tyson won then the ''complexities of boxing politics'' might
ensure he would never get his chance.
The WBC is set to argue that Lewis has misinterpreted its decision
taken at its November 1994 conference in Seville and that, on a true
interpretation, Lewis's rights as challenger were always to be
subordinated to those of Tyson once he was a free man.
They also denied the existence of any relevant contract between Lewis
and the WBC giving rise to the entitlement he asserted.
Neither Lewis nor Bruno was in court for the hearing which is expected
to conclude today.

<HEADLINE>Strathclyde spells out vital message. Euro funding is the key to 36,000 jobs</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE
NEW research has shown that the West of Scotland is far more dependant
on European aid than many local politicians had realised. More than
36,000 jobs in Strathclyde are generated by funding from the European
Union.
The figures come just as doubts are emerging about the area's ability
to continue to attract such a high level of funding. Three changes could
have a profound effect on its future ability to attract the millions of
pounds it does at present.
They are:
* The loss of Strathclyde region, leading to questions about whether
the smaller councils replacing it will be able to operate as effectively
in Brussels.
* A massive review in the next year over how Europe should distribute
its funds.
* The possibility of the European Union being enlarged, leaving the
cash available being spread more thinly.
The research on European aid has been carried out by consultants
Cambridge Econometrics for Strathclyde region, and will be published
shortly. At present it has only been circulated to a few key councillors
and senior officials.
It estimates that, over the 1994 to 1996 period, European Union funds
will support #625m worth of economic development in Strathclyde,
generating more than 23,000 jobs for men and 13,000 for women.
The economists say that Strathclyde's economy has grown at nearly
twice the rate it would have if there had been no European funding.
Among the biggest benefactors have been the manufacturing, construction
and finance and business services sectors. In fact with no EU
expenditure, manufacturing employment in the region would fall rather
than rise.
Council leaders from the 12 new councils in the West of Scotland will
meet later this month to consider what steps to take to ensure future
lobbying and funding arrangements, but there are concerns that petty
jealousies may scupper full co-operation.
Until now, Strathclyde region has operated its own office in Brussels
to lobby the EU. The new councils will be too small to do the same, and
are likely to have less impact, unless they can agree on a new strategy.
There are indications, though, that former district councillors on the
new authorities feel that they can do better than Strathclyde without
working with other councils.
Concerns have also been expressed that the former district councillors
have not been fully aware of the huge impact that the EU has had on the
local economy.
As Glasgow's Euro MP Bill Miller commented yesterday: ''There are
dangers out there that we have got to be aware of. If we get together
sooner rather than later and start planning for the next five years and
beyond, then hopefully we can come up with a West of Scotland plan. If
we don't then, I would be pessimistic. If we remain small authorities
bumping along we will lose out badly.''
A Strathclyde influence will continue in the Strathclyde European
Partnership, the organisation involving local authorities and the
Scottish Office which administers the European Regional Development Fund
and European Social Fund payments. But it is not a lobbying body, which
is what the 12 new councils will have to consider creating when they
meet on November 17.
Much of the EU money comes to the West of Scotland because of its
Objective 2 status whereby money is allocated to help regenerate areas
which have lost traditional industries.
The EU is reviewing where its funds should be spent, and there are a
number of other areas which are claiming that they should now qualify.
The enlargement of the union by taking in some of the Eastern European
countries is unlikely to happen before the middle of the next decade.
That too could mean less money for the West of Scotland, which is why
observers say it is vital that the Scottish lobbying continues.
Only last month, 114 projects in Strathclyde were awarded #67m worth
of ERDF grant assistance.
The Government's economic regeneration body, Scottish Enterprise, said
it was studying the review of Objective 2 status in Europe and was
working in partnership with the Scotland Europa office in Brussels,
local authorities and the voluntary sector to maintain the share of

Washington
THE families of five of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing, who are
boycotting today's inauguration of a memorial here, have called on
President Clinton to release all the evidence accumulated on the case.
They believe time is running out on the possibility of ever bringing
to justice the two Libyans accused of the crime, and they want to show
the world what the Libyan Government did.
In their letter to the president, they write: ''It is now time for a
decision on the Lockerbie bombing.'' They assert that Colonel Gadaffi
remains a danger to world peace. They say that ''justice would have best
been served with a swift and immediate response'', meaning a military
reaction to an act of war against the United States.
''Failing that,'' they write, ''full disclosure provides a modicum of
resolution while bringing the force of moral shame upon those nations
who have failed to guarantee international peace by upholding the rule
of law.'' They mean the European nations, including Britain, which have
refused to accept the American proposal to ban the import of oil from
Libya.
MrBert Ammerman, who leads a group of victims' families, said: ''We
have seen our enemies, and they are our allies.'' He meant Britain and
France -- which has its own grievance, the bombing of a French plane in
Africa in 1989 in which 171 people were killed.
Mr Ammerman and others at the news conference said they had been
sustained and helped in their loss by the support of people in Scotland
who continue to be their friends and supporters, seven years after the
disaster.
The former US secretary of state, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, attended
the news conference. He supported the suggestion that the evidence
should be released, on the practical grounds that there is no hope that
Libya will ever turn over the two suspects.
He said the Governments owed it to the families of the victims to
publish their findings. However, he disagreed with the decision of these
five families, and others in Britain and Europe, to boycott the
ceremony.
He also firmly rejected the suggestion that the American and British
governments are covering up evidence that Syria and Iran, not Libya,
were behind the bombing. He said that the evidence he had seen, when
secretary, was conclusive and had changed his own mind on the case.
A cairn built of Scottish stones will be consecrated at Arlington
National Cemetery today, bearing the names of all the 270 victims of the
bombing. Organisers expect between 1500 and 2000 relatives and friends
of the victims to attend, including about 60 from Britain.

<HEADLINE>13 cases run out of time as fiscal runs out of staff</HEADLINE>

THIRTEEN cases, involving fifteen accused, have collapsed after the
courtroom door remained shut because no member of the
procurator-fiscal's staff was available to appear before the Justice of
the Peace to ask for continuations.
Lawyers who found a cancellation notice on the door at Falkirk
District Court yesterday were angry, as were many witnesses.
The main police union said the mood among officers was one of deep
frustration.
The notice said the court was cancelled ''due to staffing problems at
the procurator-fiscal's office''. The fiscal concerned, Mr George Scott,
referred inquiries to the Crown Office in Edinburgh, which in turn
issued a statement saying it was making inquiries.
As far back as 1989, when he was president of the Procurator Fiscals'
Society, Mr Scott said ''the elastic is bound to burst sometime. It is
fully stretched at the moment''.
The matter was raised in Parliament by local Labour MP, Mr Michael
Connarty, who won a pledge from Mr Tony Newton, the Leader of the House,
to refer it to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Many claim there is an overstretched prosecution service suffering
underfunding.
It is understood Mr Scott's team, in common with fiscals across
Scotland, are suffering growing workloads. In Mr Scott's case, this
includes senior team members preparing the trial of six men accused of
UVF terrorist offences.
With others variously involved in cases, the result was that the
district court cases, admittedly at the bottom end of the scale with
such as minor assaults, parking and television licence offences, fell
off the end when a promised replacement became unavailable.
Mr Connarty, MP for Falkirk East, has asked Mr Forsyth for a meeting
along with the Home Affairs Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, and
senior law officers to discuss the wider issues of court funding.
He said afterwards: ''The courts are under intense pressure because of
more cases coming forward and lack of funding. Victims are going to be
very angry about accused people walking free.''
Mr Douglas Keil, general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation,
stated: ''This is the first time in the five years we have been drawing
attention to these problems that I have heard of anything so dramatic.''
He said it was a resource problem, and ''deeply frustrating for the
police''.
Mr Gordon Addison, secretary of the Falkirk and District Faculty of
Solicitors, said the closure was ''indicative of the underfunded and
overburdened system of justice in Scotland today''.
In Glasgow, where 7000 cases were lost last year at the district court
because of insufficient fiscal capacity, Mr Paul Langan, president of
Glasgow Bar Association, said: ''This story does not surprise me. It is
happening all the time in Glasgow.''

THE spectre of top-earners from the world of sport and entertainment
quitting Scotland if a Parliament in Edinburgh puts up income tax was
raised yesterday when the manager of Stephen Hendry said the snooker
player would consider leaving.
Mr Ian Doyle said such a decision by his client was a long way off and
would depend on higher income tax actually being levied by a Scottish
Parliament, but he said the snooker player was genuinely concerned about
the issue of a differential income tax burden north and south of the
Border.
The 26-year-old world snooker number one was not available for direct
comment yesterday, but Mr Doyle, his manager for 10 years, insisted that
he was speaking having discussed the matter fully with his client.
''This is hypothetical but he is a top-rate taxpayer paying 40% plus
10% in national insurance,'' said Mr Doyle. ''If Labour were to come in
and raise taxes -- bearing in mind that the top rate was 60% the last
time they were in and at one stage it was 93% -- and over and above that
they levied a Tartan Tax, he would have to consider leaving the country.
''The fact is, why should the Scots possibly be subjected to an extra
tax over and above the rest of the UK?''.
His comments were music to the ears of Scottish Conservatives, whose
chairman, Sir Michael Hirst said: ''He is right to denounce this
anti-Scottish tax and it is public-spirited of him to voice his concern,
which is shared by a great many Scots.
''Stephen Hendry is by no means the only Scot who would be forced out
the country by the Tartan Tax. It would provoke a haemorrhage of talent
out of Scotland -- achievers and wealth creators from the worlds of
business, sport and every other field of endeavour.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson countered that the snooker
star should not be listening to Tory scare stories. ''I can assure
Stephen and his manager that we have no plans to increase taxes for
Scotland,'' he said.
''In fact, our plans also give the Parliament the power to cut taxes
and if it were to do this -- who knows? -- we might even find English
snooker stars like Jimmy White moving to Scotland.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat convener Marilyne MacLaren said taxes would
only go up or down according to who the Scottish people vote for and
Stephen Hendry would have the same say as anyone else.
The SNP view was that the comments seemed to be long on Ian Doyle and
short on Stephen Hendry, and the whole Tartan Tax issue concerned
devolution rather than independence. Chief executive Michael Russell
said: ''If you want to have good health and education services and an
end to homeless people living on the streets, then well-off people must
accept the principle that they may be asked to pay a bit more for the
good of society at large.''
Mr Doyle insisted that he and Stephen Hendry were not aligning
themselves with the Conservative Party and would resist a differential
rate of income tax, whoever proposed it.

TORY legislation on the family was in disarray last night as Lord
Chancellor Lord Mackay's attempts to reform the law was set back. He
lost one Bill yesterday on family violence and the future for his
divorce law reform still awaits a Cabinet decision on Monday.
His proposed legislation to give additional protection to women and
children from violence in the home was abandoned yesterday after he had
to tell the Cabinet that he could not cope with 11th-hour Tory
amendments on what was supposed to have been an uncontroversial Bill.
Now the Lord Chancellor will have to introduce an entirely new Bill in
the Queen's Speech later this month.
His divorce law reforms, scheduled to be introduced for the new
session of Parliament later this month, are still awaiting Cabinet
decisions on expenditure.
Last night Tory back benchers in favour of his reforms went to see him
in his office in the House of Lords to reassure themselves that his
designs do not make divorce easier. Last week, Tory back benchers
opposed to his reforms came away from a private meeting with him
believing that, despite his intentions, his proposed legislation might
do just that.
Yesterday Lord Mackay rehearsed to the Cabinet his intentions for his
legislation on family homes and domestic violence, which he had supposed
would be non-controversial. But he had to admit that in the last stages
of this Bill, Tory MPs had raised problems that he could not handle to
get the Bill on the Statute Book this month. It will have to be
reintroduced as a new Bill after the Queen's Speech on November 15.
The Lord Chancellor is faced with losing one Bill yesterday and the
possibility that he will lose another Bill on Monday on divorce law
reform. But there are no signs that Lord Mackay will quit the
Government.
He pledged to bring the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill back
to the Commons ''at the earliest opportunity''.
He said on Channel 4 News that he had ''responded to comments by my
parliamentary colleagues who have concerns which they expressed to me
and which I would like if possible to deal with.''
The Bill dealt with important matters which were not easy to explain
to people who had not had much to do with the subject before.
Lord Mackay refused to comment on speculation he may be forced to drop
the Divorce Reform Bill because of Tory back bench disquiet.
He said: ''I observe the convention that prevents the disclosure of
the Queen's Speech in advance of the Queen making the speech. I do hope
this subject will receive the early attention of Parliament. I am
convinced it is the right Bill but it is open to discussion like any
other Bill.''

A TWO-HOUR Cabinet meeting yesterday failed to resolve the crucial
question of state spending, leaving the Prime Minister with the
unresolved problem of whether he can achieve the reductions needed to
produce tax cuts in the Budget on November 28.
Mr Major was forced to summon another special Cabinet meeting on
Monday.
At stake is the #263bn state spending figure which his Chancellor,
Kenneth Clarke, needs to achieve to provide ''prudent'' tax cuts in his
next Budget.
Three Cabinet Ministers are still dissatisfied with the budgetary
proposals before them. Health, social security and education are the key
issues in the run-up to a General Election. The Cabinet failed yesterday
to apportion to Education Secretary Mrs Gillian Shephard the #700m extra
that she requires.
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley and Defence Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind have offered cuts in their budgets, but they are still
insufficient for the Chancellor to announce tax cuts of up to #3bn in
his Budget statement.
The Cabinet could not even agree yesterday that the global state
spending figure of #263bn is confirmed. Over the weekend the Chancellor
and his Treasury Chief Secretary, William Waldegrave, will be conducting
one-to-one meetings with Cabinet colleagues, in a bid to give the Prime
Minister a decision on Monday.
On Tuesday Mr Major leaves for the Commonwealth Conference in New
Zealand. Last night the Government's spokesmen were trying to establish
that the state spending budget has been resolved and that Monday's
special Cabinet is required only to refine the details.
But it was clear that Ministers are still fighting for their
departmental budgets and cannot even at this stage confirm the #263bn
established target for state expenditure.
Mr Waldegrave's discussions with his Cabinet colleagues are meant to
secure departmental budgets that will ensure the proportion of the Gross
National Product going to public expenditure is reduced to the 40%
figure that the Prime Minister requires for tax cuts.
One of the major difficulties about the planning is that further
reductions in the #90bn social security budget are very complicated.
Increased spending on education is also complicated by the fact that
another #700m could be wasted by local authorities over which the Tories
now have little control.

<HEADLINE>Kynoch attacks new local authorities and 'jobs for the boys'. Bid to derail council 'gravy trains'</HEADLINE>

COUNCILS involved in ''jobs for the boys'' rows could face a crackdown
following a Scottish Office Minister's accusation of their creating a
gravy train.
Ministers are examining the possibility of giving the Local Government
Staff Commission greater powers to investigate such staff appointments.
The move emerged after Scottish Local Government Minister, Mr George
Kynoch, made his strongest attack on the behaviour of some of the new
councils at The Herald's ''Challenge of Change'' conference in
Edinburgh.
Mr Kynoch said some authorities had discredited themselves even six
months before they were due to take up the reins of power. ''That is
nothing less than a tragedy for local democracy in Scotland,'' he told
the conference.
It reopened the row with local councils after he accused them of using
local government reorganisation as an excuse for creating a gravy-train,
and drew in Labour which warned of ''the mother of all rows''.
In a speech which infuriated many delegates to the conference in the
Carlton Highland Hotel, Mr Kynoch listed the allegations against
councils, including excessive and unfairly allocated councillors'
allowances, far too many committees as a transparent pretext for making
extra payments to members, and too many senior officials on high
salaries to service relatively small councils.
For example, Mr Kynoch said West Lothian Council had created 27
committees when there were only 23 members on the council. The new
councils in the cities of Aberdeen and Dundee had respectively 16 and 18
committees.
''The public knows perfectly well what these people are about and the
predictable reaction is total cynicism about local government.''
He compared this with the new Borders Council which had 58 councillors
but only eight committees and Fife with 92 members and just nine
committees. There were areas, he said, where councils were showing
restraint.
Mr Kynoch said he would like to have been able to say that the new
councils had all prioritised service to their constituents, had embraced
the concept of value for money and had successfuly shrugged off the bad
practices of the past. But he claimed people simply would not believe
that.
Local government has now been subjected to a mounting series of
attacks by Ministers over claims of officials being appointed not by
merit but by unfair patronage. They have also accused councils of
employing too many highly paid staff and creating too many committees in
order to pay as many members as possible special responsibility
payments.
Mr Kynoch left the conference for a meeting with Staff Commission
chairman Robert Peggie to discuss in particular what to do about the
complaints which have been made about the conduct of some councillors in
the new North Lanarkshire Authority over senior appointments.
There has been speculation of growing friction between Mr Peggie and
the Minister over how best to deal with the North Lanarkshire situation
and the wider issue of ''jobs for the boys'' claims.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson departed from his prepared
text at the conference to warn Scottish Office Ministers there would be
''the mother of all rows'' if they attempted to tamper with the
independence of the Commission. No change could be made to its status
unless he was consulted.
''We are not going to stand back if Ministers think they can
intimidate people who are acting in the public interest and in the
interests of Scotland,'' he stated.
''The increasingly hysterical and targeted attacks on local government
are nothing more than an attempt to soften up Scotland's councils for
yet another savage round of Tory spending cuts,'' added Mr Robertson.
''They are a smokescreen designed to divert attention away from the
Secretary of State's real agenda: which is to make Scotland pay for the
Tory wipeout last year.''
However, he also suggested in his speech that, if need be, there
should be consideration to giving powers to the Staff Commission to
investigate these matters and to report back to the Secretary of State.
He told the conference: ''While the Staff Commission has powers to
intervene in cases where its guidelines have been obviously breached, it
does not currently have powers to investigate in less clear cut cases.''
In dealing with such cases, Mr Robertson said alternatives to full
blown inquiries instigated by the Scottish Office, which were unwieldy,
should be examined.
The Herald understands that the possible compromise being investigated
is to give the Staff Commission the real teeth which it has always
lacked to investigate complaints and order councils if necessary to
re-run appointments.
To give the present Commission more powers would, it appears, require
fresh legislation. But they could form the armoury to be passed on to a
more permanent body.
Mr Peggie has floated the idea of setting up some form of permanent
commission to monitor local government appointments which could take
over after the Staff Commission is wound up when reorganisation is
completed next year.
After yesterday's meeting the Staff Commission would say only that
''useful, constructive and wide-ranging discussions had taken place''
which had included the issue of the North Lanarkshire situation.
The Scottish Office said North Lanarkshire remained the subject of
on-going consideration by both the Staff Commission and Ministers.
The Staff Commission recently passed on a dossier on North Lanarkshire
to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, saying it had no further powers
to act although it could not give the council a clean bill of health.
As he has come under more pressure from Ministers and the trade unions
to get tough with councils over appointments, Mr Peggie has stressed
that the Commission as it was originally set up was not equipped to play
such a policeman role.
The main complaint against North Lanarkshire is over the appointment
by the new council of 64-year-old Mr David McKendrick to the job of
social work director. He is due to retire only six months after the
authority takes power next April.
Meanwhile, there was also a swipe at Cosla vice-president Peter
Peacock by Mr Kynoch. He said he had recently attacked the Government
for being ''puerile'' in denouncing local government abuses.
''I would have hoped that Cosla's first concern would be to proclaim
and impose the highest possible standards in local government. In
fairness I believe that is the aspiration of the majority of people in
Cosla and I hope therefore that they will disassociate themselves from
individual members who appear to defend the indefensible'' he said.
* Cosla has published figures showing that the 29 new councils were
introducing a flatter management structure, which meant a cut of more
than 600 chief officer posts in Scotland.
It also defended councillors' ''special responsibility'' allowances,
saying these amounted to 0.1% of total local government spending in
Scotland.
