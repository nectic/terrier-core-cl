THIS is a hospital for patients who are acutely unwell with emotional,
psychological or psychiatric problems. Our aim is to provide therapy
which we hope will enable them to return to the community after a
short-stay period,'' says Ian Rodger, hospital director at Langside
Priory Hospital.
''This is not a nursing home. We don't deal in long-term care or in
long-term psycho-geriatric care . . . and we never forget that when we
are caring for a patient we are both improving the quality of their
lives and those of their families.''
Opened as an independent unit in March of this year, Langside Priory
Hospital is Scotland's only private acute psychiatric hospital, and in
that very short time has already proved its worth and the quality of
individual care it provides.
Situated in two adjoining stone-fronted mansions in Mansionhouse Road,
Langside Priory has a day hospital and twenty in-patient beds. Each
patient has their own room and en-suite facilities. Ian Rodger heads a
clinical staff of 20-plus nurse therapists and trained counsellors.
Small but unique, the hospital is part of the Priory Hospitals Group
which has its headquarters in London and which was founded in l983. They
are the largest provider of private acute psychiatric care in the UK.
Although it is on the South Side of Glasgow, the hospital, which deals
with acute psychiatric cases, has in its few months existence treated
patients from the Borders, the Islands and the North as well as from
throughout the Central Belt.
''We treat the whole range of acute psychiatric illnesses,'' said Ian
Rodger. ''Specifically, we offer treatment programmes for depression,
stress, anxiety, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders,
phobias and for post-traumatic stress disorders as well as
alcohol-related problems. These are conditions which are major concerns
to both patient and family and our message is one of effective help.''
Strict criteria are laid down for admissions. Langside Priory does not
take adolescents, non-prescribed drug addicts or patients detained under
the Mental Health (Scotland) Act.
Combining skilled, modern care and treatment in comfortable, friendly
surroundings, the Langside Priory atmosphere on its own constitutes an
important factor in patient treatment.
''Our staff aim to assist patients to return to their life in the
community as soon as possible after health and wellbeing has returned,''
said Ian Rodger. ''Our care includes that very important ingredient,
time to listen.
''That also applies to our day hospital. It is intended for patients
who need help, but not necessarily in-patient hospitalisation. After an
initial assessment a day patient may at first attend daily, but that can
then reduce to occasional sessions.''
Langside Priory also claims to be the only private hospital of its
kind in Scotland to offer free aftercare to patients and their families
after their discharge. This aftercare remains free as long as it is
required, and is combined with free clinical assessment.
Another unique aspect, viewed as emphasising the hospital's intended
role as a community resource, is the free availability of self-help
leaflets. These provide information and advice under four key titles --
Overcoming Anxiety; Overcoming Eating Disorders; Taking the Strain Out
of Stress and Overcoming Depression.
''These leaflets are for guidance, perhaps to aid a concerned relative
or friend at a time when it may not be possible to seek other help. They
are written to identify trigger points and other key factors,'' said
Jacqui Rooney, marketing manager at the hospital.
In-patient and out-patient care is backed by a wide range of treatment
options which can include group therapy, drama therapy, art therapy and
relaxation techniques. Bereavement counselling and marital therapy are
also available.
''We have a dedicated staff whose aim is to provide individual care
for our patients in pleasant and comfortable surroundings,'' said Ian
Rodger.
''Modern treatment of psychiatric illness is all about meeting
individual needs. Above all, this is our approach at Langside Priory.''

Tests at Bon Secours are carried out with time to fully discuss the
results, an important part of the whole procedure
HEALTH screening doctor Nigel Pexton agrees with the description of
what is involved in a health screen as being very like an MOT for a car.
It provides what amounts to a snapshot of the client's current health.
It can pick up problems like overweight, cholesterol, high blood
pressure and smoking habits.
''It means that we can advise people on how to keep well, or tell them
they could be waiting for their heart attack,'' is his wry summary.
''People we see here at Bon Secours -- men or women -- may include
some who have some vague concern or worry about their health. Many
others arrive as part of some company scheme.''
No referral is required, an individual simply makes a health screen
appointment with the hospital. Results are sent to the client's GP, but
only if that is agreed.
It all takes about a couple of hours including a battery of tests in a
fairly radical physical checking.
''We establish that snapshot of current health using a standard
battery of medical tests including blood test, heart tracing, lung
function and similar checks. A good time to start these health
screenings is when a client is in his or her mid-twenties.
Then after a clean here-and-now type bill-of-health the next screening
doesn't have to be for a couple of years. We are seeing an increasing
number of people coming forward, the oldest in their late seventies, and
I would say that overall a good half of the number now come to us
through company schemes.
He sees health screening sessions as allowing most people to go away
with a broad understanding of their present health and with information
about what changes, if any, they should make to their lifestyle.
''Our tests at Bon Secours are carried out with time to fully discuss
the results, an important part of the whole procedure. As more companies
decide that health screening for employees makes good sense, we are
developing and expanding our service to take it out to the companies
concerned, on site. All the equipment we require has been tailored to be
fully mobile and can be taken out by car.''
A health screening session begins about two weeks before the
appointment, when the client receives a pack which contains general
health and dietary questionnaires to be returned in advance.
The actual screen begins with a series of clinical and fitness checks
carried out by a specially trained nurse, followed by a private
consultation with a health screening doctor, which usually lasts about
an hour. This includes a full physical examination.
''The tests involved range from urinalysis to an audiomery test and
may include a chest X-ray. The other important part is the opportunity
it gives for the client to discuss any general worries as well as
specific issues which may arise as a result of the answers given to the
questionnaires. The process takes time, and that is what it is all
about.
''Occasionally the examination reveals a situation which requires
urgent attention and appropriate advice is given. But the vast majority
of people go away reasssured about their general health as it is at that
moment -- and with the best advice we can give about how to keep things
that way.''
To mark Bon Secours 35th birthday, a #35 discount is being given with
each full health screen carried out from now until the end of the year.

MORE women of all ages now realise the importance of regular Well
Woman screening.
Sister Margaret Coyle says, ''Our advice on how often a screening
check-up should take place is to recommend one every two to
two-and-a-half years for any woman up to the age of 55, then annually
after that.''
Screenings can be carried out during the day or in the evening,
including examination by a female doctor if preferred. The screening is
designed to detect breast and gynaecological problems as early as
possible to facilitate early and successful treatment.
''While this screen is an integral part of the Bon Secours programme,
health screen is also available separately for women who are concerned
about these particular aspects of their health.''
The screen, which takes about half-an-hour and is followed up by a
written report to the client's GP, usually has results available within
ten days. Clients are also shown how to carry out vital breast
self-examinaton to help ensure continued health.
''The screen also contains a brief gynaecological history, a cervical
smear carried out by a nurse, and a measurement of blood pressure,''
said Sister Coyle.
''It is a very comprehensive screening, which takes in pelvic
examination and cholesterol checks.'' Her personal view is that a Well
Woman screening provides an important ''snapshot'' of a woman's current
health, of a type which is, above all, aimed at maintaining and
improving.

Physiotherapy treatment should always begin with a detailed diagnosis
session, according to John Wilkie, who is in charge of the physiotherapy
department at Bon Secours.
He heads a highly-qualified team who work with a full range of the
most modern equipment in what he admits is sometimes a detective work
approach to making a decision on the best treatment for individual
patients.
''Most of the people we treat have either been referred by a GP or
have simply visited here and asked for treatment,'' he said. ''Only a
few come to us as a follow-on to hospital treatment. We start off with a
full history -- what they think is wrong with them, what they think it
is all about. Then we carry out a full examination.
''A number of cases involve sporting injuries -- tennis and football,
golf, martial arts, and much more. We may be dealing with bad backs or
sore shoulders, elbows or knees. A golfer, for instance, may not think
that his injury is anything to do with his golf, yet that could be the
cause. The treatment varies.
''In some cases, it may not make it worse for the golfer to play more
golf -- it may even help. In others, a patient may be afraid to take
part in some kind of sport, yet that could be part of the treatment
required. Everything depends on the individual injury.''
He and his team reckon that a varying combination of rest, a change of
lifestyle and a continuing regime of exercise or exercise modification
can improve the condition of 95% of their patients.
The department is equipped with rehabiliation equipment,
electro-therapy apparatus and a wide range of exercise equipment
including a ''treadmill' and a traction bed. Domiciliary visits can be
carried out when required.
''Most people are fairly sedentary in their habits,'' said John
Wilkie. ''We try to encourage them to take up some suitable sport, but
to start in a gradual, progressive way if they have not been used to
exercise to any real extent. In a different approach, we can be working
at restoring an athlete to enable him or her to resume sporting
activities.''
The Bon Secours department's skills are taken into the hospital's
wards when required. That may happen in a wide range of conditions from
a ligament repair to a knee replacement.
''The physiotherapeutic approach can be used to benefit many
conditions, including obstetric and gynaecological, respiratory and
neurological cases as well as a wide range of post-operative conditions.
''The department's role includes co-operating closely with GPs and
consultants throughout many courses of treatment, and on discharge a
comprehensive report is compiled for a referring physician. On average,
a patient who comes direct for treatment without referral may require a
course of eight half-hour visits spread over four weeks combined with
possible exercise instruction and advice.
''But now and again, as we treat a patient, we may decide that there's
something not quite right about the situation, that there may be
something more behind an apparent condition. When that happens, we
advise that the patient should see a doctor for further investigation.
That is just another part of our role.'' With other patients, treatment
can mean manual techniques in combination with the use of equipment.
''Or it may come down to correcting things like lifting techniques or
postural correction,'' said John Wilkie. ''Above all, we remember that
no two patients are exactly the same in either background or injury, and
knowing about them as individuals is always important.''

THE noise made by someone snoring can be impressive by any standards.
In the Guinness Book of Records a peak level of 93db is recorded,
equivalent to a shout from six feet or of standing next to a tractor
engine. But there is nothing at all funny about snoring.
''It can be a tremendously debilitating problem for snorers and their
families. It can also be a health problem which needs medical
attention,'' say two medical experts in Glasgow.
Brian Bingham and John Crowther, two consultant ENT surgeons, are
colleagues who had already worked together in other areas when they
first decided to develop a mutual interest in snoring and snorers.
Three years along the way, they now operate the first private ''silent
parter'' snoring clinic at Bon Secours hospital. ''When a person falls
asleep and begins snoring, he or she doesn't know about it,'' said John
Crowther. ''But they are likely to be told about it very quickly. It can
be a major embarrassment for the individual, and can become a
tremendously debilitating problem for families.
''We know cases ranging from a sufferer who hasn't dared spend a
hotel-based holiday for some fifteen years because of complaints about
the noise when he snores, to a businessman who is genuinely scared to
fall asleep on a trans-Atlantic flight.''
Brian Bingham agrees. There are cases on general record where snoring
has caused severe social and marital disruption including, in one case
in America, a woman whose patience finally snapped one night while she
lay beside her sleeping, snoring husband. She got up, got a gun, and
shot him.
''Snoring is the sound of a partially obstructed and vibrating upper
airway,'' said Brian Bingham. ''Snorers are more likely to be
hypertensive and to suffer strokes and angina than non-snorers. The most
advanced stage of snoring is obstructive sleep apnoea. Apnoea is a total
airway obstruction. That can cause symptoms of daytime sleepiness, which
can result in drivers falling asleep at the wheel.
''For a wide variety of reasons any major and repeated snoring should
be investigated.''
At the Bon Secours ''silent partner'' clinic, where patients attend
after being referred by their GP -- often the result of family
insistence -- the first procedure is to obtain a detailed history. Then
follows a consulting room examination, which can take about
half-an-hour.
''That is when we may find something anatomically wrong which requires
correction,'' said John Crowther. ''That may mean a simple matter of a
nasal steroid spray to relieve congestion, or it may require surgical
correction, which can be by laser. The cause can even be enlarged
tonsils.''
Or Brian Bingham and John Crowther may decide on further investigation
in their ''sleep study room'' within the hospital. For a full
assessment, the patient comes to the hospital by appointment one
evening, goes to bed, has a normal night's sleep, and leaves in the
morning.
But he sleeps with a monitor device clipped to one finger. The monitor
records any fall in blood oxygen level, and that in turn switches on a
video camera which films, with sound, the way the patient behaves as he
snores.
''We may see him struggling for breath while he snores,'' said Brian
Bingham. ''It allows us to assess the extent to which he is suffering
from sleep apnoea, another stage in deciding the best treatment.''
The Glasgow consultants say that snoring is one of the most common
human abnormalities. In the 30-40 age group some 20% of men and 5% of
women are snorers. By the age of 6O, that has risen to 6O% of men and
40% of women being habitual snorers.
Brian Bingham describes some patients as having ''reached an
embarrassment point where they are desperately seeking an answer.
''Snoring for some people may be a social condition, but it can
develop into something more serious. It may not be possible to totally
cure every snorer, man or woman. But most will find they can
considerably improve their quality of life.''

JUST listening to patients is an important part of nursing, part of
helping to make an often worried or concerned person feel more at ease,
says Elizabeth Aghion, senior nursing sister at Bon Secours Hospital.
She is in charge of all nursing sections within the hospital and is in
no doubt about the priorities.
''On the one hand, medicine changes so rapidly today that we must
place a high priority on training and we do encourage post-graduate
nursing training although we are not a training hospital. Our aim is to
keep well up with every new priority that comes along.
''But on the other hand, nursing is about caring. We want our nurses
to be regarded as friendly and approachable. Sometimes we may have a
patient coming into hospital for a second time and asking if he or she
could be with the same nurse again.
''If we can, we try to arrange that because it can be important. And
we certainly don't have rigorous hospital timetables. If a patient wants
to sleep a little longer some morning, then we say fine, go ahead!''
With a ratio of one nurse to every five patients and Bon Secours staff
being noted for their long service within the hospital, the general and
genuine air of being friendly and approachable is an established way of
life among the nursing staff.
''Nursing has many facets,'' said Elizabeth Aghion. ''So has patient
care. For instance, our visiting hours are not restricted so that family
and friends can visit when it is most convenient, although we do
encourage visitors to leave by 9pm so that the patient can then settle
down for a good night's sleep.''
Meals matter in hospital, and Bon Secours prides itself in the quality
of menu and wide choice it provides throughout the day, and children's
menus are on offer for young patients.
''Offering them a choice of what they'd like is one way of reducing
any upset about having to be in hospital for a few days,'' said Sister
Aghion. ''That's why we offer them special main courses which -- as long
as there's no clash with medical or diet requirements -- are likely to
include hamburgers or chicken nuggets, with chips, of course. Then they
can choose from ice cream, jellies, or ice lollies.''
Most patient rooms have en-suite facilities and all have telephones
and remote control television .
Twenty-four hour medical cover is provided by resident medical
officers provided through a Research Fellowship with the department of
surgery at Glasgow University's Medical School.

THE story of Bon Secours Hospital, the first private hospital in
Glasgow and now celebrating its 35th birthday, begins even earlier and
includes a time when only a blend of faith and determination prevented
the whole endeavour heading towards near disaster.
The Sisters of Bon Secours of Paris, a nursing order, first arrived in
Britain in l869 and came to Scotland in l948. Six sisters came to
Glasgow at the invitation of Archbishop Campbell and initially bought a
large house at 32 Mansionhouse Road, Langside.
The house had been operating as Norwood Nursing Home and the name was
changed to St Alphonsus, the Sisters continuing its nursing role. Over
the next few years similar large houses at numbers 38, 36 and 4O were
purchased. In l953 the house at number 36 had to be demolished due to
dry rot, and this gave an opportunity to go ahead with a long cherished
dream, building a private hospital to be run and operated by the
Sisters.
Building began in l955. The project, to create Scotland's first
private hospital, would also be the first new hospital of any kind to be
built in Glasgow for 50 years. Initial plans called for a structure
three storeys high which would house more than 50 patients, and early
funds were raised by a group of supporters who called themselves The
Council of Friends of Bon Secours.
Work began on construction. The six Sisters who remained in the city
continued to carry out their duties at the next-door nursing home and
also assisted in energetic fund-raising.
Then a Government decree imposing a general credit freeze meant that
all work had to come to a complete halt as money ran out. For eighteen
months the half completed steel skeleton monopolised that part of the
Glasgow skyline while the Sisters found themselves faced with debt and a
further crisis in the shape of a ruling that they must either obtain a
Master of Works safety certificate for the structure or dismantle it.
Even when Treasury permission was finally obtained to borrow the
#l50,000 required to complete the hospital, the necessary loan could not
at first be obtained. The unexpected answer came from the Glasgow office
of a the Royal insurance company, where an executive whose wife had been
a patient at St Alphonsus suddenly came forward and agreed a loan of the
full amount required. The loan was repaid in full as a priority.
After what had been a gap of eighteen months, work once more began on
the Mansionhouse Road site. A landmark in more ways in one, it was
finally completed and the first patient was admitted in September l960.
Described as ''the most modern of its kind'', Bon Secours Hospital was
then an initial 28-bed unit with two operating theatres and full X-ray
facilities. Ready to carry out most types of surgery, most of its
facilities were managed by the Sisters, from nursing, catering and
laundry to theatre nursing, pathology and X-rays.
Their dedicated vocational and always non-denominational service to
the community very quickly established itself as a byword for
excellence.
These early days are well-remembered by Sister Irene Jamieson, now
director of operations at Bon Secours. When she was a young pupil
attending a local secondary school she helped as a holiday-time
volunteer in the nursing home on the hill while the hospital was being
built.
''In fact, a baby who was born at that time, Maryon Benn, now works in
Bon Secours as a senior receptionist. Nursing and medicine may have
changed in many ways since, but one thing that remains now exactly as it
was then is the caring attention to each patient that was always so
strong.''
Sister Irene joined the Order and went through nursing training. She
returned to Bon Secours in l970 and in the years that followed fulfilled
a variety of roles from radiography to being in charge of theatre. In
l985 the one-time schoolgirl ''who had helped out'' became matron, five
years later became manager, and now fulfils her present post in a role
that has also grown with the years.
''Looking back, there have certainly been vast changes. In the
earliest days, we had four-bed wards. Now, much of Bon Secours
accommodation is in single rooms with en-suite facilities.
''Then, our medical cover for patients was provided by consultants
only. Now we have 24-hour resident medical cover every day of the week.
We have 54 beds, including our new mother-and-child rooms. Specialities?
We have often debated this point over the years, and I would agree that
Bon Secours has, among other things, a strong orthopaedic history. In
the l97Os we were the first private hospital to carry out hip
replacements.
''But we have always made a conscious decision to provide a wide range
of often everyday treatments, including general surgery, opthalmic,
urology, ENT and plastic surgery. Always excepting cardiac surgery.''
But she sees the most important aspect of today's nursing as being the
same as always.
''We are here for the patient, to provide a quality of nursing care
which is professional but also compassionate and from the heart. I tell
our nurses that skills and professional competence are essential but
they need to care about their patients and realise that caring is
central to what we are all about.''
At about the time the hospital passed its 30th birthday it was
recognised that while Bon Secours had successfully continued to maintain
its standards there were other opportunities presenting.
''We made a conscious decision as Sisters that it was obvious we could
not continue to do everything on our own -- at the same time we did not
want all the good things we had built up within the hospital to die out.
We wanted it to continue to carry out our mission of caring for the sick
and seeking opportunities to help.''
It was decided to hand over the running of the hospital to
professional managers, although the Sisters still have a presence in the
hospital and with their advisors constitute the present board of
governors.
The team of professional managers assessed the entire position at Bon
Secours and decided that the building, although well maintained, needed
considerable renovation.
''Health care is a competitive world,'' said Jim Brannan, the present
financial director. ''We decided on a major #2.5m programme of updating,
to be followed by a programme of constant further updating and
reinvesting in equipment and facilities to ensure that Bon Secours will
always maintain its forefront place even in the face of new medical and
technical standards.''
The initial programme of updating took six months to complete. It
included the construction of a new eight-room consultants' suite along
with other additional facilities including a new treatment room,
physiotherapy unit and X-ray unit. A new computer room, pharmacy and
audio room were also created. Another addition was a minor procedures
theatre.
''Although much work has been carried out which can be seen throughout
the hospital, one of our next priorities -- within the next couple of
years -- will be to further upgrade all patient accommodation and
wards,'' said Jim Brannan.
''The way in which modern medicine has brought about decreasing
lengths of hospital stays is in some ways a problem for the future. But
we see it as an opportunity if we can provide the right quality of
modern service for our patients as private medicine becomes more and
more accessible to more and more people. It will also mean the constant
future expansion of the medical and treatment facilities we provide.''
He sees Bon Secours having a future which will see more use being made
of what he describes as ''mobile facilities'' some of them perhaps
shared.
''Beds for patients are no longer the big issue. These days more and
more patients are in the short-stay category. Issues to be addressed in
the long-term future are more likely to include preventive health checks
and screenings and arrangements for the care of the elderly on a
long-stay basis.''
Bon Secours is already working towards a time which it sees as
including dedicated day care centres where day patients will be treated
totally separately from other patients.
A helpline telephone facility, to be used by patients who are at home
but have a problem, is planned as an expanding service in the near
future.
''There are going to be further changes in Bon Secours in the years
ahead,'' said Sister Irene Jamieson, from her viewpoint as director of
operations. ''But although we will have to change and adapt, the
hospital will still always be Bon Secours.
''We think that Bon Secours has something different and special to
maintain.''
* Founded in l824, the Sisters of Bon Secours of Paris today provides
treatment for many thousands of patients throughout Europe, the US and
South America. With a nursing presence in London since they arrived
there in l869, a major programme of refurbishment has recently been
carried out at their hospital at Beaconsfield. A nursing home is
operated at Ramsgate.
Crossing to Ireland, the Sisters of Bon Secours run a 6OO-bed private
hospital at Cork. It is the largest private hospital in Europe with
teaching status. In the United States, Bon Secours is the tenth largest
provider of religious charitable health care on the eastern seaboard.
There is also an ongoing major commitment to South America, where work
has been in progress for more than 25 years providing health care and
health education for the very poor.
In Scotland, Bon Secours Hospital is listed as a charitable
organisation run by a trust management.

ANY out-patient department is in the front line of patient care, with
nurses at the sharp end, according to nursing sister Margaret Coyle, who
is out-patient manager at Bon Secours.
''Out-patient nurses are often the first contact with a hospital for
many people, the first hospital staff they see. So I tell all of my
nurses that a part of their job is quite simply to reassure patients who
come in and find themselves in totally strange surroundings. In its own
way, it is very much part of caring,'' she said.
Bon Secours out-patients are referred to a consultant specialist at
the hospital by a general practitioner. Sister Coyle, who has been in
the job for more than three years, deals with about 1700 out-patients a
month, about 400 of them visiting for the first time, others arriving
for purposes as varied as a change of dressing or minor procedures. As
medical techniques alter and improve, she has seen a steady increase in
the numbers who come seeking help and advice.
''Some are elderly, who may need extra assistance. Others are
children, and we keep a stock of toys and books to keep them happy. We
also operate a 24-hours-a-day on-call service for emergencies in some
departments including X-ray and pathology.''
Out-patient services at Bon Secours are open from 8am until 9pm on a
Monday to Friday basis and from 8am until l2.30pm on Saturdays. One of
the eight new out-patient consulting rooms is a dedicated opthalmic
room, and there is also a minor procedures treatment and plaster room.
The associated pathology service has a full range of pathology
disciplines available, and participates in all relevant External Quality
Assurance Schemes.
''Out-patient facilities available at Bon Secours have steadily
increased,'' said Sister Coyle. ''Their importance was recognised by the
way in which these facilities were considerably restructured during the
recent development programme.''
Present facilities now include an allergy testing service, audiometry,
and non-invasive cardiology with exercise ECG and lung-function testing.
A cervical cytology service is operated with pelvic examination and
cervical smear test. A clinical psychology service is available.
''Other services operated begin with a pharmacy dispensing service
available for out patients to a pain relief clinic run by consultant
anaesthetists,'' said Sister Coyle. ''They can involve other specialists
as required. Add to that other services like dietetics, speech therapy
and chiropody, and the out-patients label can cover a very wide expanse
of territory.''

Bon Secours has developed a strong family atmosphere over the years,
and whatever changes may be made, that is one thing we want to retain.
LOOKED at from the patient's viewpoint, one of the most striking
changes to take place in the world of medicine is the way in which
modern treatments and techniques have dramatically slashed the length of
the average hospital stay.
A typical illustration is the situation at Bon Secours.
''Compared with only a few years ago, our average length of patient
stay has been steadily decreasing for exactly the same types of
admissions and treatments,'' said Sister Irene Jamieson, who is director
of operations.
''In statistical terms, the average patient is now in hospital for 3
to 4 days -- a very short stay when viewed beside what used to be
required. Some hospital stays, for example the, perhaps, twelve to
fourteen days required for a hip replacement, or long stays following
some abdominal operations, do remain roughly as before. But more
operations are now carried out on a day surgery or overnight basis with
the patient then going home to rest and heal.
''The average length of time involved in a hospital stay is still
decreasing, although there will always be exceptions. It is obviously a
trend to be welcomed -- but it does create some problems for hospital
staff and management.''
Bon Secours now admits between five and six hundred patients a month,
many of them in the shorter stay category.
''It is a situation which results in some different nursing needs,''
said Sister Irene. ''But the core remains the same, the care of our
patients.''
Nurses and staff require updated skills to match the new techniques
and must also know the latest post-operative requirements.
Another change in today's Bon Secours facilities has been the
provision of mother and child rooms. Each of these has two beds, one for
the young patient and the other for the parent. There are toys, games
and books available, and the television service includes satellite with
its children's cartoon channels.
''Listening for any ways in which patients feel our services could
improve, then acting on suggestions wherever possible, is important in
achieving our aim of making a hospital stay as stress free as
possible,'' said Anne Connell, the hospital's business development
manager.
''In the same way, every room has a telephone because we know that
having a telephone link to friends and relatives is very, very important
to many people.
''Bon Secours has developed a strong family atmosphere over the years,
and whatever changes may be made, that is one thing we want to retain.
Our aim is to make that hospital stay as comfortable and as pleasant as
possible. It is part of the compassionate care which has always been
such an important aspect in this hospital and which continues as before.
''This is a modern, acute care hospital, but also very much the human
face of private medicine.''
Maintaining that human face takes many forms, from touches like a
small shop located just off the main reception area stocking soft drinks
and confectionery as well as a range of small toiletry items. Children
are allowed to visit if accompanied by an adult. A hairdresser is on
call. Business people determined to keep in touch during their hospital
stay can have a secretarial or fax service provided.
The ''family'' approach doesn't stop when the patient is discharged.
About two weeks later, a patient questionnaire is sent out, asking for
details on the standards of care and attention given during the stay,
along with comments.
''Parents with young children are often particularly pleased to learn
about our 'mother and child' rooms,'' said senior nursing sister
Elizabeth Aghion. ''Staff felt very happy too. A child wants his or her
mother when they wake up after an anaesthetic -- and sometimes dad will
be there too.''
If a mother decides she wants to leave the ''mother and child' room
for a short break nothing could be easier. A nurse will come along to
stand in.
And gone are the early days when mothers who saw a child returning
from an operation could be even more upset than the child. Today's
mother now knows much more about the medical aspects of what to expect.
''Mother and child being together is very important and very good for
both of them,'' said Elizabeth Aghion.

Bill Knox reports from Bon Secours Hospital, which is celebrating 35
years in health provision, examining its rich history and exploring its
plans for the future
TOTALLY updated by a #2.5m refurbishment programme, the Bon Secours
Hospital at Langside, Glasgow, celebrates its 35th birthday this month
with the claim that it has been at the forefront of private medicine
throughout that time and is still moving forward.
The professional managers who now run the 56-bed non-denominational
hospital in Mansionhouse Road describe it as ready for the new era and
the increasing demand for private medicine.
''We are fully committed to continue expanding our facilities whenever
that may be required to match the advancing standards of modern
medicine,'' said Mr Jim Brannan, who is financial director at Bon
Secours. ''When Bon Secours was opened in September l960 it was the
first new hospital to be built in the city for fifty years and the most
modern in its standards. We are still at that forefront.''
The hospital, today operated as a charitable organisation run by a
trust and Scotland's longest established private hospital, emerged from
its major refurbishment programme with many new facilities.
The surgery suite now consists of three modern theatres, one with
laminar flow. A new minor procedures theatre has been constructed, there
is an enlarged recovery area, and a dedicated wing for day and
short-stay surgery was incorporated into the programme.
''Thirty-five years is a long time, and things change,'' said Sister
Irene Jamieson, who is director of operations at Bon Secours.
''Different opportunities present themselves, and whilst changes are
made to maintain Bon Secours at the forefront of new standards and
techniques, one thing that will never change is the priority of care for
our patients.''
Bon Secours will also be looking to expand its role. It has the
physical space and ground available, said Sister Irene. Changes in the
years ahead were likely to include more dedicated day patient facilities
and at the same time more provision for long-term care of the elderly.
Any patient or visitor coming back to the three-storey hospital after
a number of years will find that much has changed, beginning with a
bright open-plan reception area leading to well-lit corridors and
re-equipped individual rooms.
Room heating and ventilation is thermostatically linked to weather
conditions and will adjust automatically, although windows can also be
opened if required. Provision has been made throughout for patients who
are disabled or who may have disabled visitors.
Appreciating the importance of attractive meals, the hospital makes a
point of providing a wide menu choice each day.
One of the first Scottish hospitals to introduce mother-and-child
rooms as a facility, Bon Secours also has 24-hour resident medical
officer care seven days a week. This is provided by the Department of
Surgery at the University of Glasgow, where Bon Secours has provided
four Fellowships at senior registrar level, the resident medical
officers carrying out research work in the unit and providing RMO cover
at the hospital.
Fulfilling its declared dedication to patient care and the recovery of
good health, the Bon Secours timetable for consultants' visits spans a
full spectrum of specialist skills from paediatrics and gynecology to
opthamology, plastic surgery and urology. These visiting consultants
have a new suite of rooms, their former accommodation now being used in
part for hospital administration purposes.
An emphasis is also placed on health screening checks and Well Woman
checks, where users are known as clients, not patients. The hospital's
dedicated Health Screening Unit is increasingly being used by
institutions and companies to give regular health checks to both
executives and employees and equally caters for individuals.
Well Woman screening is carried out by a specially trained team of
female nurses and doctors. A mammography screening service is also
available, carried out by a team of specialised consultants. As part of
Bon Secours programme of quality standards, X-rays are read
independently by two specialists.
These modern services are, said Sister Irene, all signs of the passage
of these thirty five years. But her own years of service at Bon Secours
have given her another method of measuring time.
''Not so long ago I met a new patient and recognised her as someone
who had been with us before. She agreed. On the previous occasion she
had brought her small son to have his tonsils out.
''How was he? Very well -- and now in his twenties!''

THE opening of Bon Secours Hospital in September 1960 gave the people
of Glasgow a modern, private facility. During the past five years major
renovation and new building has made sure that this hospital continues
to provide for patients, their relatives, and those who have the
responsibility of caring, facilities appropriate to the 1990s and
beyond.
The Bon Secours has always had a unique feel to it. In spite of the
changes that have taken place in modern medical and nursing practice,
the hospital has avoided an ''institutional atmosphere''. Patients now
enter a hospital served by a caring nursing staff, and a dedicated group
of personnel from the other important professions allied to medicine.
Modern theatre facilities, a wide spectrum of imaging and laboratory
techniques, with appropriate high dependency care and continuous medical
cover means that those who seek help can be reassured that they are
being cared for in the manner they would expect.
Out-patient facilities and investigative modalities are those to be
found in any modern hospital -- with ''on tap'' appropriate specialist
advice.
The Bon Secours Hospital, 35 years old today, has rightly gained the
reputation as a caring hospital, and now as it heads towards the
millennium it does so backed up by modern facilities and skilled staff.
The medical profession who have the privilege of looking after
patients in these facilities wish the hospital well in its important
role in fulfilling one of its original aims, namely, ''to produce a
welcoming atmosphere, to people from all walks of life and of all creeds
who need care.''

Darren Rodger looks at a coming of age project to boost the city's
heritage
WHAT better way for a housing association to celebrate its 21st
anniversary than by embarking on a development worthy of the 21st
century -- a project sure to be close to the heart of any Glaswegian
with even the slightest interest in the city's architectural heritage.
Linthouse, one of the largest and oldest of the city's community-based
housing associations, is in the process of converting, for sale, a
famous Glasgow landmark into unique and spacious luxury flats in finest,
and genuine, art deco style.
The building is the B-listed Luma lamp factory -- later known as
Caravan Land -- with its distinctive glass conning tower, which is
situated in Shieldhall Road, close to the M8 and handy for the city
centre, Glasgow Airport, and the Clyde Tunnel.
Built at the time of the 1938 Empire Exhibition for the manufacture
and, in the tower, testing of light bulbs, the property has been
derelict for 13 years, but its days as one of Glasgow's biggest eyesores
are numbered.
Linthouse Housing Association, whose non-profit-making remit is to
provide excellent homes and regenerate the local area, had been keeping
a watching brief and bought the three-storey building last year.
In association with Scottish Homes, Strathclyde Regional Council,
Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Development Agency, it is turning the
building into 43 state-of-the-art flats.
John McBride, development manager, said: ''This is definitely the most
ambitious project we have undertaken and everything connected with the
project is of the highest quality.
''As the former factory is a listed building we can't alter the basic
structure. But we see this development as more than just a conversion,
and we hope to turn the building and its 84ft tower into a major
feature, a gateway to the city.
''It isn't feasible to convert the tower itself into a flat but we are
planning to light it from inside and out with floodlights. I think the
effect will be quite outstanding.''
As well as creating 43 flats for sale, the Linthouse project includes
the construction of 12 four-in-a-block-type flats for rent.
Two flats in the Luma Tower development have already been sold and the
first release, due for completion in April next year, comprises 16 flats
ranging in price from #45,000 for the one-bedroom Strathaird to the
#56,000 two-bedroom Strathnaver.
The building was designed by Cornelius Armour and was completed in
1938. The architects for the present development are Cornelius McClymont
and their designs, applauded by Dr Gavin Stamp of the Mackintosh School
of Art, are in complete sympathy with the 1930s art deco style.
The Luma Tower is the association's biggest challenge and it was felt
the project launch should be marked in some special way -- hence the
burying of a time capsule at the site. Kirsty Wark was delighted to
assist, and the association made a donation to the Marie Curie Centre at
Huntershill on her behalf.
Kirsty said: ''The Luma Tower is part of Glasgow's landscape. Now,
rather than a ruin of the late twentieth century, it will be a landmark
for the 21st.''

THE great Raith Rovers European adventure willcontinue into the second
round of the UEFA Cup after they made it, narrowly, through their tie
with Akranes despite losing 1-0 in Iceland yesterday.
Rovers won through on a 3-2 aggregate and now wait with excited
anticipation the draw for the next stage, which takes place on Friday.
Their manager, Jimmy Nicholl, had no doubt about who he wanted to
face. ''We want the dream, Manchester United. It could happen now and if
it does I will attack at Old Trafford, unlike tonight.'' However, the
shock result at Old Trafford last night knocked that one on the head.
Nicholl was referring to an ultra-defensive performance in Iceland
that proved one of the more nerve-racking ties of recent years. He said:
''We were in a terrible situation when it was 0-0 at half-time. I
thought we'd done all right resisting their shots, but when you lose a
goal five minutes afterwards, it becomes very difficult.
''But we couldn't do any more defensively and all I could say to the
players was 'don't panic.'
''The pressure was intense as Scott Thomson pulled off a few great
saves, especially near the end. To be honest, at the end I couldn't
believe we had come out with a 1-0 defeat. It was a siege but we could
not afford to throw players forward at that stage.''
Hero of night, Thomson, said: ''I didn't realise it was so close to
the end that the saves came. There was a lot of bodies in front of me
but, thankfully, I got a touch when it mattered.''
The goalkeeper will be in for a pleasant surprise when he gets his
next pay packet. Club chairman Alex Penman said before the team left for
the airport: ''Scott was a hero. He can look forward to a double bonus
after this.''

GERMAN champions Borussia Dortmund are ready to rely on 19-year-old
goal specialist Lars Riechen to carry them to victory over Rangers in
tonight's Champions' League game at Ibrox.
Riechen, who still attends high school in the German city, has been
given permission to miss classes for two days. Then, on Thursday
morning, he will be back at his desk pursuing his pre-university
studies.
There is, however, no great gamble involved in the decision by coach
Ottmar Hitzfeldt to send a note to the teacher asking for Riechen to
miss classes. It has been done before, notably when Riechen scored for
Borussia when they defeated Inter-Milan in the San Siro two seasons ago.
Explained a club insider yesterday: ''Lars is one of the most exciting
talents in the country. At the moment he remains at high school, still
studying for university. But his future looks as if it will be in
football . . . and with Borussia.
''He has scored goals against Inter-Milan and then, last season, an
extra-time winner against La Coruna of Spain in the European game in our
own stadium.''
Added Hitzfeldt: ''This is a game where it is possible that we might
need the kind of player who can get important goals. Lars has shown that
he can do this. Whenever we have been in trouble he has been able to
contribute something a little bit special.
''I will have no worries about playing him against the Scots. He is
quick and he is clever, and he is very, very dangerous near goal. Also,
we have no problems with his temperament. He will play and then he will
go back to school, and then he will return to play against Bayern Munich
at the weekend.''
In the meantime, of course, there is the little matter of the Rangers
game and, while Borussia have won two games since their defeat by
Juventus, they have again lost three goals in each match, against
Stuttgart and then Eintracht Frankfurt.
They conceded three to the Italians in their own stadium and there is
a vulnerability about their defence which brought about a three-hour
talk-in among the players at the weekend.
The mistakes which brought the goals were examined and discussed and
Andy Moeller warned the defenders: ''We cannot keep scoring four goals
every week just to make sure that we are going to win a game. Apart from
the Juventus game, we scored six against Stuttgart and four against
Eintracht, but that is not something we can rely on doing all the time.
''We cannot look to do it in Glasgow. Certainly, we will be looking to
get goals and win the game but, against a team such as Rangers we cannot
afford to lose three goals.''
To that end Hottzfeldt is ready to curb some of the normal attacking
instincts of his side. The libero, Matthias Sammer, who likes to move
forward into attacking areas, has been told to stay at the back, while
international midfielder Steffan Freund has been handed the job of
man-marking Paul Gascoigne, who remains a player the Germans fear,
despite the absence of his most potent form so far this season.
The three players most mentioned by the Germans in their build-up have
been Gascoigne, Ally McCoist and Richard Gough.
McCoist because he is still seen as a major goal threat in spite of
the injury problems which have plagued him, Gough for his defensive
strength and his leadership qualities, and Gascoigne, well, because he's
Gascoigne!
Apparently the Borussia players and their coach have not discussed
Brian Laudrup to any extent, mainly because most of them can remember
him from his time with Bayern.

* RECENT reports suggested that house prices might be sticky for a
while, and there could be some pressure on rents, for example in housing
associations, as a result.
That was the fear south of the Border at least, but Scotland tends to
have a more stable situation generally. When the Scottish Federation of
Housing Associations held a seminar in Edinburgh last week, director
David Orr was not nearly so gloomy.
''We have about 200 associations, which are managing some 70,000
properties,'' he explained, ''and the present average rent is about #30
a week. For a variety of reasons, there is always pressure of events
that could result in increases.
''While no-one can ever give a guarantee there will never be any
increases, our view is that if there is any increase then it should be
in line with inflation-plus-1% at the most. Computing figures for the
future, of course, is something even the Chancellor can't do -- and nor
can we.
''We are looking to have a total of more like 100,000 properties in
perhaps three years, partly because of our own development programmes,
and partly because Scottish Homes is seeking to move out of management
of properties.''
The emphasis for all housing associations, he pointed out, was in
broad terms to have high standards throughout their properties and
affordable rents.
It's a view echoed by John Scott, at Govanhill. The association
director there sees #30 a week as typical rent for a two-person flat,
among their varied 1400 local properties.
''We are mainly offering flats, with some terraced houses,'' he says,
''with sizes suitable for two to eight, some being rehabilitated
tenements, and some new-build.
''In the latter case, there is a #4m-plus development at Coplaw Street
and Annandale Street, which gives high levels of insulation, double
glazing, gas-fired central heating, and fitted kitchen but not with
'white goods' like a cooker.
''We are not perhaps typical of local housing associations, since we
do not have a large amount of Scottish Homes stock, but eradicating
sub-tolerable housing is a core activity, as it is with other
associations. We also have a link with the local authority, which has
its own housing waiting list.''
Govanhill also has an interest in care in the community, providing
supported housing for the frail elderly, with 24-hour staffing, meals
and general care available. It is, John Scott agrees, tailoring
provision to the fact of an ageing local population.
''The ratio of inquiries for flats to actual placing is about 10 to
1,'' he adds. ''We also have a high demand for local workspace.''

Bill Sinclair reports on a new level of living at Troon
IT would be a foolish developer who chose to build new homes for the
very top of the market anywhere other than in an attractive location,
but seldom does an opportunity arise to create so special a development
as that at Crosbie Place in Troon, on the Ayrshire coast.
The site is flanked by two world-class golf courses -- the Royal Troon
and the Old Portland -- and is so exceptional that Alastair Wilson,
managing director of Wilson Homes of Kilmarnock, has personally devoted
two years of unflagging commitment to fulfil his dream of building not
just superb homes but an environment where owners can live in peace and
security in an area of great natural beauty and high amenity.
Seven large villas have been built in the four-acre garden grounds of
Amberley House on Crosbie Road.
Crosbie Place is contained within a decorative brick wall, with large
green gates at the entrance to the newly created, attractive, rustic
brick, sweeping drive leading past mature trees to a landscaped
courtyard.
All seven villas -- each of them subtly different -- has the latest in
security systems, with automatic doors to the double garages.
The attention to detail is obvious from the moment you enter a Crosbie
Place villa, from the distinctive front door right through to the
conservatory, and in the individual stained glass throughout each
dwelling.
The timber for the woodwork, a Brazilian cedar, was tracked down from
a supplier, M&amp;N Norman, who will not supply ecologically unsound
mahogany and will only buy from sustainable resources.
The cornicing comes from a supplier Mr Wilson found on one of his
explorations south. He uses the traditional methods to make his
plasterwork.
Stone for the exteriors was sourced from Baird &amp; Stevenson of
Lockerbie, to match the unusual honey colour of the old house.
In Crosbie Place, Alastair Wilson has designed out those aspects of
modern living which people find annoying. For example, in the drawing
room the table lamp lighting is controlled by the flick of a wall
switch.
Bathroom walls are sealed behind the tiling with an advanced membrane
and the latest in hydrotherapy baths awaits you in the main bathroom.
Though the design of each villa is subtly different, they all have
four bedrooms, two bathrooms, one shower room, a drawing room, a snug or
home entertainments room, and a large kitchen and utility room. Colour
schemes and kitchen finishes are at the discretion of purchasers.
Garden grounds are turfed with a large central landscaped area
decorated with terracotta urns.
Amberley House, which enjoys superb views out to sea, is presently
undergoing renovation and should be ready in a couple of months. It is
being preserved as a single dwelling, with four public rooms, five
bedrooms and four bathrooms. The top floor has a private staircase and
three bedrooms.
Alastair Wilson says: ''It is very difficult to find distinctive new
homes in such splendid locations. I hope people will come and see that
we have built something special.
''From the outset, I said that no one would get through the gates
until everything was right. The specially ordered lampposts have just
arrived, so I guess it's time to unveil Crosbie Place to the public.''
Prices of the new Crosbie Place villas start at #295,000. Viewing
arrangements from Wilson Homes, Kilmarnock.
* Light fantastic: relax in the spacious lounge, top left, or get back
to nature in the conservatory.

IF any Rangers players were unaware of exactly how big an event they
have become part of in the Champions' League playground, they found out
yesterday when it appeared as though Ibrox was being transformed from a
sporting arena into a broadcasting centre.
Walter Smith and his players were in danger of falling over cables or
being poked in the eye by microphones as they tried to finalise
preparations for this evening's match against Borussia Dortmund.
The Rangers manager pointed out in response to a question that every
match is important so far as his club are concerned, but if pressed,
even he would have to concede that the game against the champions of
Germany is heavy with significance for both sides.
Borussia, who trained at Ibrox last night, lost their opening Group C
game at home to section favourites Juventus, the same night two weeks
ago when Rangers lost in Romania to Steaua Bucharest, and a second
successive defeat for either club would make it virtually impossible to
qualify for the quarter-final stage of the competition.
''Yes, it is the same for both of us,'' Smith said. ''Having each lost
our first matches it is important now to demonstrate that you can come
back immediately with a win.''
Smith was still unable to say whether or not Richard Gough and David
Robertson would recover from injuries in time to bolster a defence which
will be minus the suspended Alan McLaren, and it will be nearer the
8.30pm kick-off time before the manager will know. He has contingency
plans in place, but, of course, would prefer to have his first-choice
defenders in place for what is likely to be a demanding night.
Having watched Dortmund closely in recent weeks, Smith knows players
such as Lars Ricken, Patrik Berger, Heiko Herrlich, and Andy Moeller
will relish any space and punish lapses in concentration and he is
hoping he will be allowed to continue with the three-man central
defensive system in use since the start of the season.
''Naturally, I would want to maintain that, but the fact is I just
don't know who will be available at this time,'' he said.
However, if Smith is weighed down by worry he disguises it well, and
was able to deal with the media circus throughout yesterday when he
would rather have been otherwise involved. He was even able to take in
his stride a question asked by a German who wanted to know if the fact
that Paul Gascoigne has decided to get married might make him a better
player.
''I certainly hope so,'' said Smith, who is not comfortable with the
attention which is given to Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup. Sometimes it
seems as though they are the only two players at Ibrox and Smith has had
to talk to all of his players impressing upon them that they all have a
vital role to play.
''We achieved some success last time we were in the Champions' League
because we were a very solid team,'' he said. ''Maybe too much is being
made of two players in particular, but the most important thing is to
get the team right, because it is only when the entire team is playing
properly that individuals are able to shine.''
The chances are Smith might have to play Stuart McCall sooner than
would have been preferred, because he has had a lengthy spell on the
sidelines through injury, but if he does use the Scotland
internationalist it will probably be as an attacking full back. Ian
Ferguson is available again after injury and he may win a place in the
midfield alongside Gascoigne, Laudrup, and Charlie Miller, who could
even be used further forward in support of Ally McCoist.
However, if Smith is unsure of the line-up then it makes little sense
for anyone else to speculate too much, and it won't do, either, to dwell
too long on Dortmund's resources. The fact that their manager, Ottmar
Hitzfeld, may be able to leave out someone like Ruben Sosa says it all.
''We have watched them play, but I think that if you look too long and
hard you only flood your brain with information about them,'' said
McCoist, who is seeking his first goal in Champions' League play. ''We
will have to play to our full if we are to get a result at Ibrox and
while it would be a serious blow to us if Richard (Gough), who has been
one of the best defenders in Europe so far this season, doesn't make it
we will have to hope that a win would still be within our capabilities.
''Defending well will be crucial, but our own players in midfield will
have to take the ball and make things happen, perhaps create one or two
goal-scoring chances.''
Scoring in Europe has, in fact, been a problem for Rangers these past
two seasons and that is something Smith wants to see change. ''Our
threat up front has to be improved,'' he said, ''and I will be playing
two up front in an attempt to do something about that problem.''
The Germans have an impressive array of players -- Sosa, Sammer,
Cesar, Moller, Kohler, Zorc -- but as McCoist says, it is best not to
think about them. ''It might only depress us,'' he said, ''so let's just
talk about me.''
Rangers supporters can only hope the talk is all about McCoist and
Rangers by the time the Ibrox lights are doused this evening. If so,
Rangers will, indeed, have reached a remarkable height of achievement.
* STRATHCLYDE Transport will run extra underground trains this evening
to cope with fans leaving Ibrox after the Rangers-Dortmund match.
Normally, services end at 10.30pm, but the game will not finish until
10.15, and a Strathclyde Transport spokeswoman said: ''We will run extra
trains for as long as it takes to clear the queues at the Ibrox
station.''

* Despite the company's reputation for using modern materials and
building techniques, Barratt is finding that a design that harks back to
the past is one of its best sellers.
When the traditional cottage-style Palmerston house styles were first
built exactly a year ago, sales exceeded the most optimistic
expectations.
Now the three-bedroom houses are being built on over half the Barratt
developments in Scotland, with more in the pipeline by the end of the
year.
Buyers have the choice of detached or semi-detached Palmerstons. The
front-facing lounge has an open plan staircase. The fitted kitchen has a
separate dining area and there is a downstairs cloakroom with WC.
Upstairs are two double bedrooms, a single bedroom, and bathroom. The
houses all have double glazing and energy-efficient central heating.
Most have garages.
''We listen to what our customers have to say,'' says Barratt Northern
chairman Mike Norton. ''And they have been asking for more features
inside a new house and traditional cottage-style elevations outside.
This is what we are providing.''
Prices for the Palmerston range from around #55,700 up to #73,000.

* THE Renfrewshire property market must be getting more stable -- two
properties with horsey connections are being sold, each coming with
plans for extension or conversion.
* Horse-lovers prepared to muck in and carry out their own conversion
might be interested in Jaapston Stables (pictured above). The
whitewashed stable block lies deep in the heart of West Renfrewshire's
rolling countryside, near Uplawmoor, and comes with plans for conversion
into a five-apartment cottage.
When complete, the conversion will have its own garage and garden and
buyers will have the option of acquiring an adjoining paddock. Slater
Hogg &amp; Howison is seeking offers over #75,000 for Jaapston Stables.
And...
* Ostlers Cottage on Paisley's Corsebar Lane is a traditional
property, linked to others in a small courtyard and screened by trees.
It has a conservatory at the front door which gives access to a dining
hallway, lounge, study, kitchen, two bedrooms and bathroom. Plans for
converting the attic space into living accommodation are awaiting final
approval. Slater Hogg &amp; Howison seeks offers over #85,000.

* MENTION castles and Royal Deeside and most people immediately think
of the Queen's stately summer playground. But there is another one. The
only other castle to be built in the area since Prince Albert
commissioned Balmoral for Queen Victoria has just been launched on to
the market -- and despite its traditional lines, it was built in the
late 1980s.
Strathieburn (pictureed above) stands 12 miles from Aberdeen and makes
use of architectural components and features whose origins span four
centuries of Deeside history. The castle was constructed eight years ago
by local architect Ron Gauld and his wife Susi to fit their own design
criteria.
''We wanted a house with lots of living space and masses of light
which looked and felt old, but was also easy and economical to run,''
says Ron. Strathieburn took them only 15 months to build, during which
time they became avid scavengers, scouring the area for parts of old
buildings which they could recycle.
The castle is a blend of historic stones rescued from other buildings.
Granite arches, stone features, wooden beams, planks, rafters and
flagstone floors came from places like Crathes Castle, Craiglarach House
in Aboyne, a Dundee jute mill, the historic Culter Paper Mill, and the
''Triple Kirks'' in Aberdeen.
''Ron and Susi Gauld have successfully achieved their objective of
creating a home which looks and feels old and is economical to run,''
says David Strang Steel of agents Strutt &amp; Parker. ''Despite its
appearance as a sixteenth-century tower house, Strathieburn is a
comfortable family home.''
The castle benefits from an ingenious under-floor heating system on
the ground floor with the remaining floors being heated by electric
heaters.
The accommodation, available at present on three floors, includes a
magnificent Great Hall, panelled dining room, open-plan kitchen, three
double bedrooms with en-suite facilities, one further bedroom, laundry,
utility room, and a double garage.
There are two windows in the attic and plans have been prepared which
would enable the purchaser to develop the attic space into three further
bedrooms, by extending the spiral staircase.
Strutt and Parker's Banchory office is seeking offers over #380,000.

* A PROMINENT listed building overlooking the Firth of Forth is being
converted into 36 unusual apartments. ''College House'' is the new name
for the former Ramsay Institute which is a Grade A listed building
situated at the end of Edinburgh's Portobello Road.
Built around the turn of the century, the brick building with its
handsome windows is being converted by Headon Developments.
''The attractiveness of the building from the outside and its
prominence are obvious,'' says selling agent John Brown of selling
agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe. ''It is just 15 minutes to the city centre
and five minutes to the beach.''
All floors are served by a lift and many of the flats will have
outstanding views across the Forth, particularly from the first and
second floors. Two bedroom flats predominate and all of these have
en-suite shower rooms, but if a customer does not wish a shower room,
this can be excluded and the price reduced.
A feature of each flat is a new timber floor in the sitting room which
is sanded and sealed. Prices range from #30,000 for a studio, #39,000
for a one bedroom, and #53,000 for a two-bedroom apartment, including
the en-suite shower room. Each flat has a private car parking space.

YES, I was one of the fortunate few. The cabling of Edinburgh has not
yet reached our neighbourhood and satellite dishes are banned on the
building, so I cannot introduce Sky Sports into the home even if I was
prepared to pay for it.
A kind friend who has the channel invited me round for the duration of
the Ryder Cup and I spent about 12 hours glued to the chair.
Of all the sporting events I have ever watched on the small screen
this was the most riveting. Never have I felt such tension, never such
elation at the finish. When Faldo sank the putt we sank the bottle.
Now, I realise in writing these words one is further frustrating the
millions who wanted to view -- and couldn't. Either, like me, they
cannot receive the satellite stations or they cannot afford it. The
bitterness of some true golf fans runs deep.
Before we argue the case for and against major sporting events being
excluded from terrestial television, I would like to pay tribute to the
Sky team. They were on live for more than 30 hours and I thought their
performance was quite superb.
The main presenters, Ewen Murray and Bruce Critchley, could not have
worked harder if they had been employed by Burger King. They were
utterly sold on the European cause -- fans with microphones -- as was
the anchorman, David Livingstone, another Scot, but who cared about
that? Out on the course the wandering wordsmiths -- Ken Brown, Peter
Oosterhuis, Tim Barter, Paul Broadhurst, and Larry Mize -- earned their
corn, too. They were not always the most professional of interviewers,
but they were full of enthusiasm.
Of course, I missed Peter Alliss, because he is to golf commentaries
what Peter O'Sullivan is to racing; one wonders how long he will remain
loyal to the shrinking sporting world of the BBC.
The Sky team made sure we never missed a vital shot. Who could ask for
anything more?
Quite a lot, reply the deprived millions. We want the Open, the Ryder
Cup, Wimbledon, the Derby, the Cheltenham Festival, premier division
football, the Cup Final, the Five Nations' Championship, and every Test
match to be on the BBC, ITV at worst. That is what we have come to
expect.
National institutions like these, the argument goes, should be
protected from predators from the satellite world. We have a right to
see them.
The real world is not like that any more.
Let us be fair to Sky. The reason they won the right to show this
Ryder Cup -- and the next two -- is that they were prepared to put a
package to the PGA Tour, which included screening tournaments in which
the BBC or ITV showed absolutely no interest. Sky also were main
sponsors of the British Masters.
This is a fair commitment to the game of golf and one which neither of
the terrestial companies were prepared to match.
The BBC will tell you they are short of cash, that they desperately
need an increase in the licence fee. Perhaps. But it is also a matter of
priorities.
I am constantly amazed at the amount of air time the BBC gives to
grand prix motor-racing, for instance. It cannot be cheap to televise
from all over the world and must have a smaller viewing potential than a
major golf event.
Apart from athletics, ITV appears to be interested in little more than
football. Their coverage of other sports, in Scotland particularly, is
practically non-existent.
In professional sport the participants want the best possible deal for
themselves. For that reason alone more major events will go to the
satellite channels.
By the time the next Ryder Cup comes along, in Valderrama in 1997, the
satellite audience will have increased significantly. Even so, the
majority of viewers will not have access to the channels.
I do hope, therefore, that some deal can be worked out to cushion the
blow.
It would surely not detract from Sky's coverage too much if they were
required to sell, at a fair price, edited highlights of the day's play
to one of the terrestial channels. If that were to happen no-one could
complain of being frozen out.
And, from the satellite company's point of view, it would be a smart
political move.

FRANK Bruno, the new World Boxing Council heavyweight boxing champion,
will take part in Sunday's BUPA Great Caledonian Run in Edinburgh. He
will also run in its sister 10k event, the BUPA Great Midland Run, on
Sunday, October 15.
Bruno covered the last four miles of the Great North Run half-marathon
on Tyneside following his world title victory over Oliver McCall at
Wembley. He enjoyed the run so much he insisted he would take part in
the Coventry event -- and then phoned back the race organisers to
declare he was also available to compete this weekend.
Bruno said: ''I was genuinely delighted by the enthusiasm shown by all
of the competitors in the Great North Run, who I know raised a lot of
money for charity. They were absolutely fantastic. My only regret is
that, after my championship bout, I decided not to run the full distance
there. Now in Edinburgh I'll have the opportunity to put that right.''
Edinburgh race director Nigel Gough said: ''The man's fabulous. Having
Liz McColgan running on what is effectively her own territory already
guaranteed the run a high profile. But Frank's participation is equally
as important. Those running for fun will appreciate his genuine attitude
to races of this kind.''

Dunfermline 2, Brechin 0
DUNFERMLINE managed to withstand the challenge of third division
Brechin City at East End Park last night in the Scottish League
Challenge Cup.
The Pars, currently sitting on top of the first division, ensured
their place in the semi-finals of the tournament but, as had been the
case in their second-round tie against Forfar, Bert Paton's men made
heavy weather of their task, looking vulnerable on a number of
occasions.
Goals from Greg Shaw and Stewart Petrie, one in either half, were
sufficient to give the Fifers victory, but the visitors lived up to the
pre-match promise given by their manager, John Ritchie, that they would
not be adopting the role of ''whipping boys''.
After a nervous start, Dunfermline took the lead after 21 minutes when
Allan Moore broke free on the right before sending in a probing cross to
the far post which was headed home powerfully by Shaw.
Dunfermline keeper Guido van De Kamp was troubled on a number of
occasions after the interval as the visitors pushed for an equaliser but
hesitancy in the Brechin defence gave Petrie the opportunity to drive
the ball home after 75 minutes to seal victory.
The Fifers will now face Dundee United in the semi-finals.
DUNFERMLINE -- Van De Kamp, McNamara, Fleming, Fenwick, Tod,
McCulloch, Moore, Robertson, Shaw, Petrie, Kinnaird. Substitutes --
McCathie, Den Bieman, P Smith.
BRECHIN -- Allan, Mitchell, Brown, Cairney, Connoway, Mearns,
McKeller, Farnan, Ross, Reid, McNeill. Substitutes -- McNeil, Marr,
Garden.
Referee -- R Tait (East Kilbride).

Manchester Utd 2, Rotor Volgograd 2
(agg: 2-2. Rotor win on away goals)
ALEX Ferguson, the Manchester United manager, put on a brave face
after his club crashed out of the UEFA Cup at the first hurdle last
night.
Having drawn 0-0 in Russia a fortnight ago, United suffered the agony
of defeat on the away-goals rule after having been held 2-2 ot Old
Trafford. Keeper Peter Schmeichel moved up for a corner to head the
equaliser in 89 minutes but United were unable to force a winner.
Youngster Paul Scholes had given them a lifeline on the hour mark
after first-half goals from Vladimir Nidergaus and Oleg Veretennikov had
put the visitors in the driving seat.
''It's hard to take,'' said Ferguson. ''We suffered for those 20
minutes of bad play in the first half. It meant an uphill fight but,
credit to them, they got to work in the second half and we were very
unlucky not to go through.
''I enjoyed the second half, they all did their best and the crowd
recognised that.''
Of Schmeichel's goal, Ferguson said: ''He deserved it, he tried hard
enough. He'll be talking about it for months.''
The Russians, although delighted with their success, were almost out
on their feet. Their coach, Victor Prokopenko, said ''With another 10
minutes United would have got the winner.''
On Schmeichel's goal, the coach said: ''I couldn't get any message out
to my defenders when he came up, and it was just totally unexpected for
us. These things don't happen often, though I think he did the right
thing in the situation.
''I really think that, if there'd been another five or 10 minutes left
in the game, Schmeichel would have scored again.''
United gave their all to achieve what was just beyond them, hitting
the woodwork twice and seeing efforts cleared off the line by the
backs-to-the-wall Russians either side of Scholes' fourth goal of the
season.
After Schmeichel's amazing late goal United could have pulled off an
astonishing comeback, but when Scholes fired over right on time, Rotor
had the spoils, even if United's gallant effort had the glory.
Ferguson had gambled on playing Andy Cole and Roy Keane after ham
string injuries but could only watch in despair as his defence caved in
twice in the opening 24 minutes.
Gary Neville had an unwanted part in the Russian's opener when he was
the last defender when Nidergaus played in Alexander Zernov, whose
square return allowed Nidergaus to roll the ball home.
Steve Bruce was at fault at the second goal, losing possession, and he
then failed to close down Veretennikov as he strode forward before
exacting full toll with a 25-yard strike that went in off an upright.
Ferguson's response was instant, Paul Scholes coming off the bench for
John O'Kane, with Lee Sharpe dropping back. Then Nicky Butt looked to
have given United a lifeline after 29 minutes but his header was cleared
off the line by Alexander Berketov.
Bryan Roy struck a blistering drive mid-way through the second-half at
the City Ground to give Nottingham Forest victory on the away goals rule
against Malmo.
Roy lived up to his #3.6m price tag after Malmo defender Jorgen
Ohlssen cracked under pressure and misheaded a long ball down the
middle. Roy pounced and powered the ball home from 20 yards.
At Elland Road, John Lukic saved Leeds from embarrassment. The
35-year-old keeper made a string of fine saves as the Yorkshire club
went down 1-0 against Monaco on the night, but the three goals Leeds
scored in the Principality were enough.
Liverpool reached Friday's second-round draw but not without cost.
Neil Ruddock will be suspended for his side's next match after the
Merseyside team were made to fight hard for a 0-0 scoreline against
Vladikavkaz, going through 2-1 on aggregate.
Defender Ruddock was booked for a second time in as many games and
will be ruled out of the next stage.

NIGEL Benn yesterday won the Boxer of the Year award -- then gave
himself a two-bout deadline for ending one of the most exciting and
successful careers in British fight history.
''I'm coming to the finish of my career,'' said the World Boxing
Council super-middleweight title holder after receiving the British
Board of Control trophy in London. ''When you are 24, you get hurt and
you shake it off. I'm 31 now and it hurts a bit more. I will have two
more fights, but I'm not ready to give up my belt yet.''
International Boxing Federation superstar Roy Jones is Benn's target
for his farewell performance, but pay-per-view television politics in
America will make that a hard match to put together.Benn got the
nomination ahead of his great friend and WBC world heavyweight champion
Frank Bruno, who fittingly presented the award.
British Fight of the Year was the first WBO super-middleweight title
clash between Steve Collins and Chris Eubank in March, while former
three-times world champion Mike McCallum was named Overseas Boxer of the
Year. The Sportsmanship Award went to Birmingham's Paul Wesley, a
stoppage victor over British middleweight champion Neville Brown.

SOME property developers use virtual reality machines to conjure up
hi-tech images of the completed product. Iain Robertson of Gaelic House
Developments uses sheer enthusiasm. He also uses holes in the floors,
walls, and ceilings to show just how good his eight Glasgow West End
apartments will be when they are finished.
Most builders would rather you stayed away until the place is ready
for occupation, every sign of building work buried away under
floorboards and wallpaper. Robertson and his partner, architect Alastair
Kirke, have no such qualms.
With construction still well under way, they are happy to show
visitors around the scheme at Kirklee Gardens in Kelvinside. Everywhere
is the bang and batter of building work. Painters, joiners, plumbers,
and electricians blare their radios throughout the buildings. It's a
real site.
Iain Robertson will proudly show you anything you want to see, answer
any question, lift any floorboard in his determination to prove that
this is one development with nothing to hide.
Following him through his conversion of three West End townhouses is a
demanding process. He insists that you use your own imagination to get
an idea of what the finished apartments will look like. ''Imagine this
room when it's decorated . . . picture this staircase when the carpets
are down and the cornicing painted . . .''
It seems to work. Several of the properties are already in lawyers'
hands. Yet the purchasers had only the plans, a noisy building site, and
their faith in the developers to go on.
But Robertson's enthusiasm is infectious. ''This is my favourite
room,'' he says -- several times. ''I'm really chuffed with this
bathroom . . . that cupola transforms this space . . . this flat is my
proudest moment . . . our bin-house is the most expensive in Glasgow . .
. this window will be wonderful to sit at . . .''
And developers don't come much more hands-on than Robertson. He just
can't keep his hands off his features. Banisters and baths, cornicing
and coving, they all get a lingering touch as he sweeps through double
doors, bounds up staircases, and vaults over voids in the floorboards.
What he is doing is restoring three elegant townhouses to their former
grandeur -- and he is prepared to go to great lengths, and expense, to
restore traditional features.
In the midst of his warmth and passion it is easy to forget one small
thing. Iain Robertson and Alastair Kirke are taking the sort of risk
that would have most of us waking at night in a cold sweat. Will they
get their money back on their eight apartments?
''I admit it -- these are not cheap apartments,'' says Robertson.
''We're putting a lot of money into the conversions and we have to have
faith that there are people out there who share our enthusiasm for
quality. ''We're getting a strong response, but it's only fair to say
that some potential buyers are very worried about selling their current
home -- especially those from outside the West End. People are asking
for very long entry dates. It all adds to the worry.''
Which is about as good a summary of Glasgow's patchy property market
as you can get. There are people who want to move, but they are finding
it hard to sell their own home -- which is why so many of the volume
builders are offering part-exchange deals.
Niche developers like Gaelic House cannot provide that kind of
incentive. Instead, they are selling the development on a commitment to
quality. Cornices, coving, ceiling roses, fireplaces, cupolas, dados,
banisters, and stained glass are major elements of each conversion.
Where neglect, or rot, has damaged former features these are now being
restored. But restoring architectural details and internal grandeur does
not come cheap. Some fireplaces cost well over #1000.
''It would make you weep,'' says Robertson. ''We are having to pay
more than #50 per metre to restore cornices and coving, but it's worth
it when you see the finished result. You can replace everything nowadays
-- which is great news. The bad news is that you have to pay a lot to
get it done well.''
Committed to high-quality conversions, he regrets looser planning
rules which allowed some dire townhouse redevelopments to go through in
the past.
''The number of lousy West End conversions would break your heart. So
many wonderful houses have been ruined. Now the chickens are coming home
to roost as people find them difficult to sell. We hope that we are
offering something different. A quality home with a dramatic use of
space and loads of original features preserved or recreated. You can
either do it or you can't -- we are showing that we can.''
Although he lives in a nearby West End townhouse at the moment, he has
decided to move into one of the apartments in the new scheme himself --
putting faith in his own product. And while he loves the buildings of
the West End, he is breezily unsentimental about the builders of 100
years ago -- pointing out where they cheated on brickwork, cut corners
on the plumbing, and dumped ash and rubble under floorboards to dampen
sound.
''Ash from Dixon's Blazes supplied the deafening for the whole of the
West End,'' he says, shaking his head in wonder that the builders got
away with it.
Each of the eight dwellings in his conversion is unique. They all have
dramatic living rooms, some with huge windows and antique fireplaces.
The work is scheduled for completion in November, and prices range from
#112,000 to #150,000. Gaelic House can be contacted on 0141 337 3447.

Akranes 1, Raith Rovers 0.
Agg: 2-3
IT'S a long trip from Akranes to Kirkcaldy, but for 200 fans from Fife
it became a joyous jaunt last night after Rovers squeezed their way into
the second round of the UEFA Cup.
It was not one of the more memorable performances by a Scots team in
Europe, not by a long distance, but they did stick to their task and
rode the luck that was theirs to see them through a hard day's work.
Raith defended their 3-1 lead from the first leg from much too far
back into their own territory and scarcely made an attacking
contribution to this second leg.
After having survived an almost constant siege in the first half, they
seemed to be in desperate bother, when one of the feared twins, Arnar
Gunnlaugsson, scored six minutes after half-time and, to be fair to the
Icelanders, they must wonder how they failed to snatch a second goal
which would have earned them a place in the next round.
So many chances did they make that one more goal seemed bound to come,
or so we thought, but, thanks to gritted teeth, some wonderful
goalkeeping by Scott Thomson, and a determined togetherness, the
Kirkcaldy side made it.
However, it was not an afternoon for those suffering from high blood
pressure.
Maybe it was the odd setting, a European venue perched on the edge of
the Atlantic, the unexpected bright sunshine, and the presence of almost
the entire local community but Rovers were prone to lapses of
concentration at various points throughout the 90 minutes.
Two or three times early on they were caught off guard and might well
have been severely punished. After six minutes, for instance, Olafir
Thordarson was presented with a chance by Bjarki Gunnlaugsson and it
needed a late challenge by Shaun Dennis to block the shot before it
reached Thomson's domain. Then, when Adolfsson rose unhindered to head a
corner from Ingolfsson, the ball was diverted by his team-mate, Arnar
Gunnlaugsson, otherwise Raith would have been in trouble.
Crawford and Dair spent a lonely time up front and never really made
much impression before both were replaced late on, but Crawford did
relieve the pressure at one point with a good run down the left although
he hit his cross too hard.
There was a really lucky break for the Fifers when one of the twins,
Arnar, was left in prefect position to meet a cross from the left but,
despite having plenty of time, he placed his header wide.
It took 26 minutes before the Scots managed to force a corner, a clear
illustration of their inability to command the midfield and, thus, being
forced into last-line defence.
Thomson was almost caught out by a throw-in from Julian Broddle,
having to race out to kick clear when challenged by Arnar Gunnlaugsson.
Broddle tried to make amends with a shot that was off target, but, at
that stage, many of the crowd were too busy spotting whales.
Their attention was soon recaptured three minutes before half-time
when McAnespie hit a superb free kick that was only inches over the bar.
The siege continued after the break with a ferocious Jonsson drive
that went outside Thomson's left-hand post.
After 51 minutes, the inevitable happened. A corner from Indolfsson
was headed towards the far post by Hognason and there was Arnar to help
the ball over the line.
Things then became very fraught, and when Indolfsson hit a hard
left-foot shot, the Rovers' fans held their breath as the ball whistled
past a post.
Another corner had the Kirkcaldy defence in disarray, but, this time,
Broddle cleared on the line.
The pressure was clearly getting to the Scots as McAnespie, attempting
to make a pass inside his own area, pushed the ball into the path of the
other twin, Bjarki, who ought to have done better than shoot over the
bar.
In 76 minutes Akranes put on striker Dejan Stogic for Indolfsson and
Raith followed by replacing Crawford with Wilson. It was certain to be a
nervy last 15 minutes for the Scots, and so it proved.
Thomson had a fine save from Thordarson as the defensive barrier was
breached again but the keeper bettered that with a magnificent stop from
a Jonsson free kick.
With six minutes left, Coyle had his name taken for kicking the ball
away and then Rovers put on McInally for Dair and hung on for all they
were worth. They did it, and the celebrations began.

Clydebank 0, Dundee United 1
TEENAGER Ben Honeyman earned the Tannadice side a Challenge Cup
semi-final clash with Dunfermline. He combined with another teenager
Stuart Gilmour just seven minutes from time to get the all-important
winner as this quarter-final tie seemed to be heading towards extra
time.
Gilmour found space on the left and his inch-perfect cross released
Honeyman, who calmly stroked the ball low past keeper Gary Matthews.
Although the Bankies came back in the final minutes they could not turn
their pressure into an equaliser.
The Tannadice side included four emerging players who were starting a
top team game for the first time. But if Clydebank, having read those
team lines, had any thoughts that this would make their task easier that
was dispelled within 20 minutes.
United, with the freshness of youth backed by experience, seemed the
more likely side in the opening stages, and after 12 minutes Honeyman
had a dangerous shot only partially blocked by keeper Gary Matthews. But
the Bankies were fortunate that their central defender Tom Currie
cleared.
Maurice Malpas was booked just before the interval and then United's
Mark Perry and Craig Tomlinson, of Clydebank, were also shown the yellow
card in separate incidents.
CLYDEBANK -- Matthews, Tomlinson, Sutherland, Landsdowne, Currie,
Nicholls, Teale, Connell, Kerrigan, Grady, Bowman. Substitutes --
Flannigan, Agnew, Lovering.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, Perry, Shannon, Gray, Dailly, Malpas,
Caldwell, Johnson, Walker, Honeyman, Gilmour. Substitutes -- McLaren,
Winters, Maxwell.

* ENTERING into the spirit of your new home could be a challenge if
you happen to become the buyer of Inverbervie's Hallgreen Castle. For it
does not come with vacant possession -- it appears to be teeming with
ghosts.
Undaunted by such a ghastly disadvantage, its selling agents have
conjured up a marketing campaign which makes no bones about the castle's
more ancient residents.
Dating from 1374, Hallgreen lays claim to being one of Scotland's
oldest castles as well as its most haunted. Spectres are reported three
or four times a year, the most common being medieval serving wenches, a
Victorian lady, a watchman, and a child.
The castle is situated on the outskirts of Inverbervie, roughly midway
between Stonehaven and Montrose. Its original tower house was built on a
spectacular clifftop situation by the Dunnet family in the late
fourteenth century, in local red sandstone. Since then it has been
extended with a southern wing built by the Rait family who owned the
property from 1478 to 1724, while further extensions were added in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Hallgreen had fallen into a dilapidated condition, but the present
owners have carried out extensive restoration to provide many of the
comforts of a modern home. At the same time, Hallgreen's authenticity
has been safeguarded with the work carried out after close consultation
with Historic Scotland. Original features have been retained where
possible.
Hallgreen Castle comprises three floors of manageable accommodation.
Its outstanding room is the Great Hall situated on the first floor, with
its recessed The castle has 2.3 acres of gardens and mature trees, and
estate agents Bell Ingram Rural say that only offers over #250,000 will
have a ghost of a chance.

SCOTLAND'S leading two players, Peter Nicol and Martin Heath, have
left Scotland's world team championships medal hopes in tatters by
declaring themselves unavailable for the event in Egypt in November.
Nicol, the world No.4 who underwent a tonsil operation in June, has
struggled in the early part of the season, and has reluctantly decided
to pull out in order to concentrate on preparation for November's
big-money Super Series, the Pakistan Open and Qatar Classic.
Heath's absence follows public criticism from team manager Pat Nicol.
The world No.35 from Oban, said: ''Unless there is a change in team
manager I won't be playing for Scotland again.''
After last week's news that Stuart Cowie is ineligible to play for
Scotland under World Squash Federation rules because it is less than
three years since he played for the England junior team, the latest
withdrawals have ended Scotland's hopes of making an impact in Egypt.
Barry Sutherland and Dave Gordon, from the European side, former
internationalists Alan Thomson and Alasdair Taylor plus Graeme Clark,
David Heath and Peter O'Hara will be chasing places in the four-man
line-up.

EDDIE Irvine was yesterday catapulted into the multi-millionaire
bracket after he completed a ''dream'' move to Ferrari. Irvine will
partner world champion Michael Schumacher next season after Formula
One's most famous and successful team secured his release from Jordan
Peugeot.
The Italians moved for Irvine in the last few days and were yesterday
thrashing out the terms of his release after meeting the driver and team
manager Eddie Jordan in Switzerland.
Ferrari are expected to pay around #3m after Jordan only announced
last Thursday they had taken up the second year of the three-year
contract the 29-year-old from Newtownards, Northern Ireland, was on.
''I would be very happy to see out my contract,'' said Irvine, whose
deal with the Maranello outfit is for up to three seasons. ''However,
every driver dreams of Ferrari. This is an opportunity which I would not
want to miss and I am very grateful to Eddie Jordan for allowing me to
take it.''
Johnny Herbert, currently seeking a drive after having been released
by Benetton, will be favourite to partner Brazilian Rubens Barrichello
at the Silverstone-based team next year.

INTER Milan were dumped out of the UEFA Cup by Swiss side Lugano last
night, beaten 2-1 on aggregate after having suffered a shock 1-0 home
defeat in the second leg of a first-round tie they were expected to
dominate.
A powerfully struck free-kick by Jose Carrasco with just four minutes
remaining stunned the crowd at the San Siro Stadium.
Jurgen Klinsmann scored two first-half goals as Bayern Munich
triumphed 5-0 over Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia to go through 5-1 on
aggregate.
Further strikes by Andreas Herzog, Mehmet Scholl, and Thomas Strunz
sealed the tie for the Germans.
Abel Balbo was on target twice and Daniel Fonseca once as Roma handed
out a 4-0 second-leg hammering to Switzerland's Neuchatel, Francesco
Statuto's deflected effort completing the scoring as the Italians went
through 5-1 on aggregate.
Fellow Italians AC Milan completed an 8-1 aggregate victory over
Zaglebie Lubin of Poland by winning the away leg 4-1, Croatian Zvonimir
Boban scoring the last two goals in the final four minutes.
And Pierluigi Casiraghi took his first round tally to four, following
up his first leg hat-trick with a goal Lazio's 2-1 away win over Omonia
Nicosia for a 7-1 aggregate victory.
Seville goalkeeper Juan Unzue saved a last-minute Kostadin Vidolov
penalty as the Spaniards prised a 1-1 second-leg draw against Botev
Plovdiv in Bulgaria to go through 3-1 on aggregate.
PSV Eindhoven walloped MyPa-47 of Finland 7-1 to take the tie 8-2 on
aggregate.

CELTIC'S missing millions -- the stars who have been absent recently
-- look likely to return against the Georgians of Dinamo Batumi at
Celtic Park tomorrow. Yesterday the players who have cost the Glasgow
club around #5m, trained in an attempt to prove that they would be fit
enough to play in the European Cup-winners' Cup second-leg tie.
Phil O'Donnell, the #1.7m buy from Motherwell last season, has been
missing with a groin strain. Dutchman Pierre van Hooydonk, who cost
#1.2m, has been suffering from a hamstring problem which kept him out of
the first leg in Georgia which Celtic won 3-2. And the German, Andreas
Thom, whose summer price was #2.2m, also has been out with a leg knock.
However, the players were sent out to test themselves 48 hours before
the match. Manager Tommy Burns said: ''We have the chance now to wait
and see if there is a reaction to the workout. If there is no reaction,
then the three players will be involved in the game against Batumi. If
there is a worry, then they will be left out. We have a lead, but Europe
is not a place to take chances.''
Burns, of course, is right, especially as his team must play Rangers
just 48 hours after this tie -- yet another complication which the
Scottish League and the European Union have not thought to take into
account when the Cup-winners' Cup was rescheduled.
The fortunate thing, this time around, is that the Scottish
Cup-winners will be playing at home, and I will be very surprised if the
Georgian team even come close to threatening Celtic's lead.
As for the John Collins' affair -- it is obvious that the break-up is
imminent. But that will not stop Burns playing Collins tomorrow if he
believes that to be the proper choice.

FARMER entrepreneurs in South-west Scotland looking for a new cash
crop could do worse than to consider growing strawberries over an
extended season which could see fresh fruit being picked for the
Christmas trade.
That is the view of Colin Stirling, senior horticultural adviser with
the Scottish Agricultural College, who has been promoting the growth of
soft fruit under protected conditions in the North of Scotland for many
years.
''Provided we do not get a thoroughly dreich autumn you can get the
fruit ripening right up to Christmas,'' he said. ''Last year one of our
growers in Orkney had fresh fruit on sale on Christmas day.
''Generally speaking growers using protective tunnels have just
finished harvesting in Aberdeenshire and they are actually still picking
in Caithness.''
Mr Stirling has been working with SAI Horticulture and Comrie-based
grower David Burberry to perfect a system of growing strawberries on
benches in polythene tunnels which should provide clean fresh fruit from
May until September, and beyond that for those who are anxious to extend
the season.
''We have provided start-up packages to growers as far apart as
Orkney, Skye, Alloa and Cheshire,'' he said. ''There are still some gaps
in the country especially on the west coast between Oban and Stranraer.
I believe there could be great potential for someone setting out to
provide high quality fruit to hotels and shopkeepers in places like Ayr,
Troon and Largs.''
The SAI strawberry system combines the talents of Mr Stirling with
those of Mr Burberry of Evanshen, Comrie, who has established a major
business producing high quality berries from May to October for Marks &amp;
Spencer. Horticultural marketing experience comes from Duncan Wood of
SAI Horticulture which has adapted the Dutch gro-bag method to suit
Scottish conditions.
The system is intended to be tailored to the likely demand for fruit
in a tourist area with a balance of shops, hotels and passing trade. It
should be considered as an add-on to an existing business or as a
supplement to family income. Employment would be provided for one person
over a period of up to five months.
The runners provided as part of the start-up kit would have been
lifted from the fields in the winter months and kept in cold storage (at
1.5 degrees centigrade) until required by the grower. They are described
as 60-day plants but can normally be expected to fruit within about 50
days.
For an early crop pollination may have to be ''assisted'' and that is
achieved by introducing fishermen's maggots, bought at the pupal stage,
which eventually hatch out as bluebottles. They die off after two weeks.
The basic system from SAI is designed for 500 sq m of growing space
provided by four tunnels erected over two seasons. The gro-bags sit on
benches at eye level which allows the fruit to hang at a convenient
height for picking. The plants and gro-bags from year one go on to
provide a spring crop the following year while new stock is brought in
for later harvesting.
At current prices the cost of one tunnel, completely fitted out, would
be approximately #5000, but about half that cost could be recovered in
year one. SAI calculates that the capital investment in polythene
tunnels could be written off over four years. The steel structures would
have a long life but the covers would probably require replacing every
three of four years.

JED-FOREST and Scotland scrum half Gary Armstrong, who is recovering
from a sprung rib cartilage, sustained in the third minute of his
comeback game against GHK on the first day of the premiership season,
will return for his club against Currie on Saturday week.
On medical advice he has decided not to rush his recovery and will
miss Jed's league game against Selkirk on Saturday. The injury, which
occurred in a freak incident when he fell on the ball, represented a
severe blow to Armstrong, who had fought his way back to fitness after
serious knee damage kept him out of the game for all of last season.
Yesterday he said: ''My physiotherapist has advised me to give the
ribs another week and, after all the trouble that I've had, I'm not
going to go against her advice.
Armstrong, who is determined to win back his Scotland place, added:
''When the going gets tough you just have to keep on smiling. My young
son Darren said to me the other day that if I made it to half-time in my
next game then I would get an orange. That's an incentive of sorts, I
suppose!''
The Borderer is being linked by the local press in Newcastle with Sir
John Hall's Newcastle-Gosforth superclub, although he said yesterday
that no approach had been made. ''If they did get in touch, then it's
certainly something I would consider. You have to keep your options open
but, really, I'm more than happy to play for Jed,'' he said.
* STAND-OFF Andrew Mehrtens has been sidelined by a shoulder injury as
the New Zealand team gears up for its upcoming tour of Italy and France.
Mehrtens said yesterday that he will not be available for the remainder
of the domestic season, ruling him out of representing Canterbury in the
National Provincial Championship play-offs.
Mehrtens said he damaged his right shoulder when tackled by Auckland
lock Robin Brooke early in a game last Saturday. ''It's still sore and I
would not be able to play in the NPC semi-finals or finals if Canterbury
get that far,'' he added.

Stirling County 34,
Barbarians 57
FOURTEEN tries on a sun-kissed afternoon in Stirling represented good
value for money for the near enough 5000 spectators at Stirling Albion's
Forthbank Stadium and the treasurers at Bridgehaugh and Murrayfield were
smiling too.
At 300 quid a touchdown, the scoring spree cost Barbarians' sponsors
Scottish Amicable a not insubstantial #4200. Stirling County's five
tries netted their youth development programme #1500 with the
Barbarians' nine touchdowns meaning that #2700 will wing its way towards
the SRU youth programme.
But there ain't any such thing as a free lunch or a cost-free
showpiece game and, with injuries to knee and hand (a broken finger
suspected), Kenny Logan must, at the very least, be doubtful for
County's premiership encounter with Heriot's FP on Saturday.
Stirling reached the midway point trailing 31-3 but, as captain Kevin
McKenzie said later, once they had managed to get their game plan up and
running, they put on a more-than-creditable show against the
star-studded Barbarians.
Gregor Townsend, playing his first game in the UK since returning from
a summer in Australia was a late replacement in the Baa-Baas side for
the injured Craig Chalmers. There was more than enough of the old magic
on display to remind Scottish fans of what they will be missing once he
decants to Northampton.
Until he went off hurt, Logan represented an ever-eager threat on the
left wing for Stirling and his try came as just punishment after an
atrocious, head-high tackle by the giant Bristol lock Simon Shaw which
was not at all in the Baa-Baas' tradition.
Murray Fraser, who has not had his troubles to seek since enlisting
with Stirling at the start of the season, used the showpiece game as a
reminder that he is not a bad footballer after all.
However, his 90-metre runaway try, complete with hitch-kick in front
of the spectating Princess Royal, merely served to underline the fact
that he does have a future at Bridgehaugh but not necessarily in the
No.9 nine shirt.
SRU patron, the Princess Royal, who has been an unofficial visitor at
Bridgehaugh in the past, also had family business in Stirling yesterday.
Her son, Peter Phillips, captained the Gordonstoun School side and
scored a try in their 29-11 defeat of County Colts, a taster for the
main attraction.
McKenzie declared, once it was all over, that the day had been a great
success not just for Stirling County but for the development of rugby in
the area as well. ''There were more than 4000 people here on a Tuesday
afternoon and that can only be good for rugby in this area. Some of them
might never have been at a game before and, I think, what they saw today
might encourage them to come back for more.''
Barbarians captain Gavin Hastings was full of praise for the Forthbank
Stadium setting. ''The playing surface out there today was absolutely
fantastic. For the life of me I can't understand why we persevere with
playing our rugby on long grass. The short grass out there on that pitch
today was conducive to playing good, open rugby and in terms of the
product that we have to serve up for the paying spectator, it was a good
advertisement for the game.''
Hastings declared, too, that even with the advent of professionalism
there would always be a place for the Barbarians.
''The Barbarians, as a concept, will survive if the players want it
to. At the end of the day it is up to them. Personally, I think that the
Barbarians is a superb concept and that's why I play for them whenever
I'm asked,'' he said.
The Barbarians were in Scotland to play a club side for only the third
time in their illustrious history. Melrose and Glasgow Academicals are
the only other Scottish clubs who have been graced by a game against the
famous invitation club.
County's big day ended last night with a gala dinner, attended by the
Princess Royal, at Dunblane Hydro.
McKenzie said: ''The amount of work which has gone into organising
this has been incredible, but when you get the chance to play against
the Barbarians you don't turn it down.
''It's been difficult for everybody concerned to fit it into a busy
league programme but, after the way the day has gone, I think everybody
takes a great deal of credit for the work they've put in.''

FORMER world indoor champion Hugh Duff and Graham Robertson last night
took Scotland's tally to seven players into the second round of the Saga
International Open in Preston. Both scored straight-sets wins.
Duff, the 1988 world indoor champion, beat women's world outdoor
champion Margaret Johnston 7-2, 7-2, while Robertson beat veteran
campaigner David Bryant 7-2 7-5. Scotland's only first-round loser was
Joyce Lindores, the women's world indoor champion, who lost to
Australia's Ian Schuback.
Schuback, a former world indoor singles and pairs champion, hit back
after dropping the opening set to win 4-7, 7-3, 7-1. Lindores fired a
verbal broadside at the Australian saying: ''He was so slow that it felt
like half-an-hour between my bowls, and when he got to the mat the
number of questions he asked were ridiculous.
''On occasions, he was repeating the questions I had asked seconds
earlier -- it was just gamesmanship.'' Results:
I Schuback (Australia) beat J Lindores (Scotland) 4-7, 7-3, 7-1; N
Burrows (Crown Green) beat T Allcock (England) 0-7, 7-3, 6-7; D Corkill
(Ireland) beat G Smith (England) 7-4, 7-6; H Duff (Scotland) beat M

NORTHERN Ireland is the current preferred option for Scottish hill
farmers selling breeding stock, especially if they are selling
blackfaces, judging from recent sales. Last week a Scottish-bred
blackface ram sold for #16,000 in Ulster, but in Lanark yesterday the
ring was packed for the annual sale of cast ewes with buyers from all
over the province. From the outset prices were in the region of #10 more
than last year, despite the regular lots being in leaner condition.
One of the Ulster buyers, John Fellowes, said: ''The sheep over here
are off really hard ground. I paid #32, which I have to admit was
slightly less than I anticipated because I bought early. You Scots
really don't realise how good your sheep are.'' He later confessed that
his annual consignment of 400 ewe lambs had recently averaged #37.
Another Northern Ireland buyer was much more adventurous when he paid
#80 for the annual consignment from David Ker, Craigdarroch, Sanquhar.
Astonishingly these ewes are five-years old and, despite their
distinguished pedigrees, are about to be put to a bluefaced Leicester
ram for cross breeding.
Local breeder Malcolm Couborough said: ''It's been a very good sale.
I've sold three lots -- up #12, #8 and #3. For hill ewes I am delighted.
If you're selling the right type of article there is no problem. Quality
is the key.''
However, Mr Couborough answered the ultimate question when he said:
''Without a doubt, without subsidies for our type of farming we could
not survive.''
The top price was #205 for a pen of 40 five-year-old ewes from Michael
Scott, Troloss, Elvanfoot, which sold to John Harkin, Northern Ireland.
Blackface breed president Ian Thomson said: ''Our breed is on the up and
up. The sheep industry in the hills and uplands is in marvellous heart
this year for most of us and these prices are not unexpected.''

Development has improved the Discovery, says Ross Finlay
THE tougher kind of off-road enthusiasts sometimes look down their
noses at the Land Rover Discovery for being a lifestyle accessory.
Certainly, some of the families who own this model hardly qualify as
rugged trail-breaking types, although it has to be repeated that many
people need 4x4s for their towing capabilities rather than as
off-roaders. However, the only manufacturer in the world which makes
nothing but 4x4s can merge fashion with sturdy performance if that is
what a section of the market demands.
Bearing in mind that the first Land Rover was introduced as long ago
as 1948, it is astonishing that in all those years there have been only
three model lines, and all of them survive -- the Defender, the
Discovery and the Range Rover. Nearly two million have been built, and
something like two-thirds of these remain in use. Robust construction
and a massive steel chassis see to that.
The Discovery was launched in 1989, and word that the company had
commissioned Terence Conran to advise on the interior did not impress
the hairy-chested brigade.
But his input still helps to make the Discovery a much more civilised
4x4 than many of its rivals. The interior has many neat details, like
map slots above the front sun visors, and it looks well. On the other
hand, it is very practical in things like floor coverings, grab handles,
working surfaces and access.
While the original Land Rover remained much the same for several
years, the Discovery is subject to a steady development programme. The
present models have changes to the front and rear appearance, as well as
altered fascia, seat and control design.
Modifications to the propshaft and rear suspension, and more in the
way of sound-deadening, all contribute to much lower noise levels than
before.
I have been driving a five-door V8i ES, the top-ranking model in the
Discovery range, whose price of #28,900 is close to the entry-level
Range Rover Classic. It uses the 3947cc extra-capacity version of the
familiar all-alloy V8 power unit, which as a result pours out 181bhp and
231lb ft of torque, with all the majestic woofle of this engine type
when the driver goes for hard acceleration.
The test car was fitted with the four-speed automatic transmission
which is a #1200 extra. It dims the performance slightly, although
0-60mph in 12 seconds, tremendous mid-range pull and a test track
maximum of 105mph are all pretty good going for the class.
Fuel consumption is much as you would expect, with returns like 27mpg
at 56mph, 20 at 75 and no more than 13mpg on the urban cycle.
On the road, the Discovery handles better than most 4x4s, although
within the strict limits which drivers of this kind of vehicle over-step
at their -- if not peril, at least embarrassment. It also scores higher
than most of its rivals for ride quality. The bounce is obviously there,
but not the constant jittering.
Off tarmac, even if it is nothing like the top rough-roader in the
range, the Discovery has composure and control. Permanently engaged 4WD,
a transfer box and a lockable centre differential all contribute to its
businesslike approach.
As far as cabin space is concerned, the Discovery ES is fine in front,
roomy in the back if the front seats are not too far reclined. The
interior is light and airy, since it has two sunroofs -- glass, with
mesh pull-across shades -- as well as big windows to the rear, and high
extra windows at the curve of the roofline.
The roof itself rises towards the rear, so headroom for back seat
passengers is lavish. While the ES comes with a pair of very occasional
fold-down inward facing seats right at the back, headroom there is poor,
and the accommodation is suitable only for smaller members of a
school-run group or undersized beaters at a shoot.

Two families explain why they send their children to private schools
ROY Chapman, senior lecturer in electrical engineering at Strathclyde
University, and his wife, Katherine, a general practitioner, were both
educated in the state sector, but opted for independent schooling for
their son, Benjamin, and daughter, Becky, at the secondary stage. Now 16
and 14, both are pupils at Glasgow Academy.
What made them decide to look at the independent sector? Roy says: ''I
was involved with the school board in the primary school, and the more I
saw what was going on, the more I was disillusioned. I just felt that as
a parent, you probably had a little more control in the independent
sector.
The main benefits which pupils derive, he believes, ''is the
combination of the academic and the extra-curricular. Certainly they are
stretched and challenged academically, and are set quite a lot of
homework, so they have to work.
''Obviously they are doing the same public exams as they would in the
state sector, but we feel that they wouldn't do the same amount of work
academically. ''The other thing is the extra-curricular activities on
offer within the school, they're both very involved with those.''
''The opportunities are there, and the teachers are very committed. We
feel we've made the right decision, the children are very happy -- and
that's very important.''
Susan and Edward Hinks live a few miles out of Edinburgh, and have two
sons, Angus, 11, and Harry, 9. Both parents attended boarding schools.
Interestingly, their two sons go to different schools, although they
both started in the nursery at Cargilfield, in Edinburgh.
''Angus went on up into the main school at Cargilfield, and Harry was
doing extremely well, but we felt when he was seven in P3, he just
wasn't ready to move up.
''We took them both round to see Stewart's Melville Junior School.
Harry said, ''Yes, this is fantastic,'' while Angus said ''No way''.
''We thought it was best to have happy children to get the best out of
them, so we decided to go our different ways.
''We believe that if children are happy at school, they will respond.
It's not easy, half-terms never coincide, nor do sports days, fireworks
and so on.''
Her elder son, Mrs Hinks says ''is very much the boarding sort of
chap. He increasingly felt that he was missing out, because the majority
of his friends boarded at Cargilfield. ''I don't think there's ever been
any difficulty for him in boarding, yet this is a child who's sensitive
and had his problems settling in when he began at the main school. It's
a complete about-turn. He is very happy, he's built up a lot of
confidence and grown in stature; he walks taller, feels part of the
group, he's been given responsibility and he feels important.''

<HEADLINE>Brussels cuts setaside rate</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KATHERINE BUTLER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976175287</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN agriculture ministers have relaxed curbs, on the amount of
cereals land farmers can plant, opening the way for a big increase in
grain supplies next year, writes KATHERINE BUTLER.
Responding to demands from grain producers they agreed to cut the
compulsory setaside rate from 12% to 10% and said the same rate should
apply to both rotational and non-rotational schemes.
The non-rotational rate which applies to land taken out of production
for five years was to be set at 15%.
While the reduction in setaside requirements is of benefit mainly to
exporters, Britain won assurances from Brussels that pig and poultry
producers hit by high feed prices would get priority in the allocation
of additional grain supplies.
''It is a firm undertaking on managing the market for local
consumers,'' Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said.
Under reform of the CAP in 1992 cereal producers were ordered to leave
at least 15% of their land idle in return for compensation. Last year
the rate was cut to 12% and in July a further 2% reduction proposed.
But despite a sharp rise in wheat prices the European Commission
resisted calls from the French, the EU's biggest grain exporters, for a
cut in the rate to just 6% setaside.
The Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, said yesterday that a
single 10% rate for both forms of setaside was acceptable as grain
output would be two million tonnes lower than the 175 million tonnes
forecast for 1995. The new measures will bring output up to an estimated
182 million tonnes next year.
David Jack, cereals convener for the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland, welcomed the Brussels announcement. ''The Commission has
responded positively to our call for a cut in setaside and for an early
decision,'' he said. ''This will allow Scottish cereal growers to plan
ahead and produce grain for which there is a firm and real market.''

<FLAG>BUSINESS COMMENT,</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>976175288</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
WHETHER or not the Chancellor of Exchequer Kenneth Clarke is tempted
to introduce what commentators would call a 'political' budget this
autumn with cuts in income tax to try to restore Tory party fortunes
remains to be seen. But there will certainly have been precious little
encouragement for him to do so from the two highest UK management
profile bodies -- the CBI and the IoD.
The IoD'S Budget representations announced yesterday in many respects
follow the same line as the CBI almost a fortnight ago. Both believe
that the time is not right for tax reductions and both are urging the
Chancellor to concentrate on aiding small businesses though there are
considerable differences in emphasis and in the measures that could be
taken.
A major joint theme is that if there are any personal tax cuts these
should be matched by reductions in public expenditure and that nothing
should be done to endanger the Government's anti-inflation stance.
If there is scope for a reduction either because consumer spending is
slowing or because of credible public spending reductions, than the CBI
believes this should be done by raising the bottom threshold.
The IoD would like genuine income tax reductions moving towards a 20p
rate. But neither party is looking, or calling for action in this
direction, in the coming Budget.
The campaign in some quarters, mainly the housing and construction
markets and those that service them but not exclusively so, that there
should be tax boosts for the housing market, gains no support.
The CBI basically ignored this possible aspect of the Budget while the
IoD comes out uncompromisingly against any such move on the grounds that
it is not clear that any impact would be lasting and, anyway, it would
merely add to the tax burden of others.
However, this may not be the upper consideration in the Chancellor's
mind as he struggles to find a formula to appease worried backbenchers.

LAST week the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street conceded that after all
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, had been right to
resist its calls for a rise in UK interest rates.
But the Bank of England's chief economist, Mervyn King, has now come
down against a cut in response to the slowdown in economic activity.
Bank base rates currently stand at 6.75%. Were they to peak at this
level this would be historically low in both nominal and real terms.
The Federal Reserve raised rates in the US much more aggressively than
here, but signs of a sharp slowdown in the second quarter prompted a
quarter-point cut in early July.
The American economy has perked up again. Not surprisingly the Fed
left rates on hold last night, though there is still speculation that a
further cut will be forthcoming at a later date.
US primes, the rates banks charge their best corporate customers, are
currently two full points higher at 8.75% than UK base rates.
The signs of a slowdown in activity here are to date much less
compelling that they were in the US three months ago when there were
fears of a mid-cycle recession. In both cases working off stocks has
been a major factor.
Mr King made the point yesterday that underlying inflation was still
significantly above the mid-point of the Government's 1% to 4% target
range, leaving the authorities with little scope for an easing in
monetary policy.
Building societies and other mortgage lenders, which have been
enjoying a strong inflow of funds at a time when demand for mortgages is
slack, have managed to cut their rates without the help of a reduction
in base rates.
So there is no obvious need for Mr Clarke to give into pressure for
lower interest rates. The economy has been sending out mixed signals on
retail sales and consumer spending.
But as past tax increases and the three half-point rises in base rates
in the last year work their way out of the economic equation, the
consumer should come back to life. Budget tax cuts may aid the process.
A mid-cycle cut in rates could help stoke the engines of future
inflation.

<TEXT>
THE Scotch Whisky Association is extremely unhappy about the continued
refusal of Chile to tax Scotch at the same level as its domestically
produced spirit.
Pisco attracts tax of only 25% of the wholesale price, while Scotch
whisky has to bear a 70% impost. Other imported spirits such as brandy
and gin pay only 30%.
SWA director of commercial affairs Tim Jackson said that by taxing the
principle imported competition at a higher rate than Chilean-produced
pisco, the country was blatantly ignoring the Gatt agreement on world
trade which banned the use of internal taxes to protect domestic
production.
Chile imports about #11m of Scotch whisky annually and in return
benefits from substantial wine exports to the UK in particular.
Campbell Evans, spokesman for the SWA, added that it hoped that if the
EU negotiators now on their way to Chile were successful in having the
distortion removed, it would have a domino effect throughout the rest of
South America which, as a whole, imports about #200m of whisky annually.

BIOCURE, the Aberdeen-based healthcare company, has moved into profit
for the first time and announced plans for a full Stock Exchange
listing, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Biocure was founded in 1984 by Dr Neil Hendry, a former consultant at
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, to follow up his research into certain
chemical compounds which showed potential for treating cancer and
healing wounds.
But the firm's commercial success stems from its Hypoguard subsidiary
at Woodbridge in Suffolk, which was purchased in 1990 as a cash cow to
fund the research programme.
Hypoguard, which produces a range of products for diabetics, increased
its sales by 45% to #5.5m in the year to June 30. This enabled the group
as a whole to make a pre-tax profit of #43,000 after a loss of #715,000
previously.
Biocure was floated on the unlisted securities market last year, but
chairman Bill Bruce said the company would upgrade to a full listing in
1996 if its results for the current financial year are as good as
expected.
''We do hope for a full listing in 1996, but it is tied to next year's
results,'' he said.
Hypoguard, which employs 80 people at its Woodbridge factory, makes
instruments that diagnose blood sugar levels and other medical equipment
for diabetics.
More than 80% of its output is exported, and Mr Bruce said there was
rising demand for its products in Eastern Europe and the Third World.
Since Biocure bought Hypoguard five years ago, it has overhauled the
company's management, invested #200,000 in new equipment and established
an efficient international distribution network.
''We are quite pleased that we have managed to turn the company around
and we hope to grow from here,'' Mr Bruce said.
Biocure spends about #600,000 to #700,000 a year on its medical
research programme in Aberdeen, but Mr Bruce said it would be some time
before this produced any pharmaceutical products with commercial
potential.
''At the moment we don't have anything on clinical trials. That is
still a year or two off,'' he said.
Biocure may pay a first dividend at the end of the current financial
year, but Mr Bruce said the company's main aim was to use its profits
from Hypoguard to fund research.
Biocure shares, which were floated at 40p in July last year, rose 3p
to 18p.

Concern that the clouds that have appeared on the economic horizon
over the last three months signal a slide back into recession was
virtually dismissed by Adair Turner, director-general of the CBI last
night, writes CHRIS STONE.
But he warned that the outcome would depend on action from the
Government, and crucially, from the business community itself.
In his first major speech on the economy since taking over from Howard
Davies earlier this month, he told businessmen that the CBI was
optimistic. ''We believe the present situation is more likely to end up
as a false dusk than a major turn-down.''
Speaking to the CBI's Eastern region annual dinner, he said: ''There
is no excuse for business not to succeed. We have to recognise that most
of what has to be done still lies with business itself. We need to focus
as much on what we as business can do for ourselves as on the limited
set of things that Government can do for us.''
He told the meeting that manufacturing industry had enjoyed the most
benign economic environment for 25 years. ''With business enjoying the
benefits of low inflation, fairly low interest rates, flexible labour
markets, and the highest rate of return for 20 years, the Government can
legitimately tell at least the export-based sectors that there is no
excuse not to succeed.''
Commenting on the successful performance of manufacturing industry
over the last three years, he said there remained an underlying concern
about whether improvements in competitiveness had gone far enough. ''Our
rate of growth is still significantly below what we ought to be able to
manage given productivity improvements, and significantly below the rate
we need to make further inroads into unemployment.''
Mr Turner said it was a matter of concern that even after three years
of strong export growth and depressed consumer expenditure the total
balance of payments remained in deficit. ''There remain significant
barriers to be overcome if we are to accelerate our growth to the levels
we would like to achieve. Our investment rate as a percentage GDP
remains below developed country norms. And our level of
business-financed R&amp;D lags those of our leading competitors.''
He said it was vital to sustain low inflation. ''We need a Budget
which takes no risks with borrowing, inflation and interest rates,'' he
said. Improvements in two key investments -- transport infrastructure,
and education and training -- were crucially needed from Government.
Mr Turner pointed out that the UK spends 15% to 20% less as a
percentage of GDP on roads than our major customers, less than a quarter
of what Germany spends per head on the rail infrastructure, and less
than a fifth of what France spends.

THE head of the Government's chief advisory body on trade promotion
issues last night told Scots business people that ''short sharp bursts''
of effort were not the answer to achieving success in the international
trade field.
Sir Derek Hornby, chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board, told
company representatives at a meeting of the Edinburgh and Lothians
Export Club that the export market was a long-term investment.
''You can't flash in and out of countries,'' he said. ''It's a long
grinding job and it doesn't come from the sales office. It comes from
the boardroom. You have to go back and back again.''
The board draws on the experience of top British business people. It
helps improve the export performance of UK industry and commerce and one
of its principal tasks is to advise Ministers on promotion efforts.
Sir Derek has been chairman since 1990 when he retired as chairman of
Rank Xerox (UK). He held a similar post with the board's North America
advisory group for three years.
After visiting Napier University in Edinburgh yesterday, he toured
Hall's of Broxburn which was established in 1925.
Today, 33 years after it concentrated its efforts on pig-based
manufacturing, the family business is one of Lothian's major employers.
Sir Derek then visited another West Lothian plant -- Heat and Control
at Bathgate -- before returning to Edinburgh to address the Export Club.
He said he found companies that had entered the export market were
willing to share their experiences with firms considering making the
move.
But he added that those planning to export had to do their homework
before investing a lot of money in overseas missions.
''You need to make sure the product is absolutely right for the
marketplace. You need to have people's trust and you must be able to
offer an excellent after-sales service,'' he said.

STEVE and Jacky Dinnes, who brought the Delifrance chain of French
cafes and bakeries to Scotland nine years ago, have sold up and gone to
Australia to set up a new Delifrance chain in more sunny climes, writes
ROBERT POWELL.
They have sold their Scottish business to the Macclesfield-based
catering company Sports and Leisure Foods (SLF) which already runs the
catering facilities at Aberdeen airport and Sumburgh airport in
Shetland.
SLF declined to say how much it had paid for the three Delifrance
outlets in Glasgow and Aberdeen and the two sub-franchises in Edinburgh
and Paisley, but the asking price was #1.2m.
The Delifrance brand name is owned by the French engineering company
Bouyges and SLF will have to open at least one new outlet in Scotland
each year in order to keep its franchise.
SLF development and operations manager Jonathan Cawley said a new
Delifrance cafe would be opened soon in either Edinburgh or Glasgow and
SLF planned to continue expanding the chain in Scotland thereafter.
Steve Dinnes got the idea of bringing the French-style cafes to
Scotland from his Dutch wife who used to work in a Delifrance outlet in
the Netherlands.
When he lost his job as an instrument technician in the North Sea oil
industry in 1986, he applied for a Delifrance franchise and the couple
opened their first cafe in Aberdeen a year later.
Nine years later they were running a five-outlet business with an
annual turnover of #1.4m, but they decided it was time for a change.
The couple are now based in Perth and have secured the Delifrance
franchise for Western Australia.

CALEDONIAN MacBrayne recorded its worst financial result for more than
a decade during the year in which the Government decided not to
privatise West Coast ferry services.
Cal-Mac sustained a pre-tax loss of #495,000 in the 12 months to
end-March, in spite of a #6.73m Government subsidy. This was its first
deficit since 1992, when it made a loss of #210,000, and contrasts with
a #360,000 profit in the company's transitional 15-month accounting
period to end-March last year.
The deficit was only Gourock-based Cal-Mac's second in the last 10
years.
As required, its 1994-95 budget had been set at break-even. However,
it was unable to keep within ''ambitious'' targets for staffing costs
and also failed to achieve its projected increase in passenger, car and
coach traffic.
Company secretary Gordon McKenzie said ever-increasing safety
legislation had impacted on the cost of staffing vessels, as well as on
repairs and overhauls.
Chairman Graeme Crombie said the overspend on staff costs was largely
the result of the need to meet changes in working regulations, coupled
with the inability to obtain approval for the necessary certification
(from the Marine Safety Agency) permitting changes to crewing levels as
frequently as had been anticipated.
He emphasised that a slight increase in traffic, albeit well below
forecast growth of 2%, had been achieved during a year in which tourism
was down between 10% and 15%.
Mr Crombie claimed Cal-Mac's deficit for the year to end-March was
actually an improvement of #282,000 on the previous 12 months because
the Government grant was #981,000 lower.
As a result of the 15-month transitional accounting period, this
figure was derived from comparisons with internal accounts for the 12
months to end-March last year.
Last September, after lengthy consideration of privatisation options,
the Government announced its decision to retain Cal-Mac as a single
entity within the public sector.
When the Government initially raised the possibility of privatisation
of West Coast ferry services, it evoked a storm of protest from the
people on the islands Cal-Mac serves.
Even though the ferry operator had on occasion been the butt of their
criticism, they campaigned for its preservation.
Comparing the 12 months to end-March with the 1993 calendar year, the
number of passengers was up 0.4% at 6.22 million. There was a 0.7%
increase in car traffic and a 3.3% rise in the number of commercial
vehicles carried. However, the number of coaches was down 3%.
In the current year, Cal-Mac's Government subsidy will increase to
#8.3m, to compensate for the cessation of the profitable Kyle-Kyleakin
sailing next month as a result of the opening of the Skye Bridge. The
rise in the grant also reflects the increased cost of compliance with
safety regulations.

THE battered image of Japan's banks took another blow yesterday when
Daiwa Bank, the country's tenth biggest commercial bank, said an
executive had run up hidden losses of $1100m on bond deals in New York.
Authorities tried to contain the fallout, saying Daiwa could survive
the blow and that the problem would not threaten the financial system,
now burdened with mountains of bad loans inherited from the collapse of
Japan's 1980s asset ''bubble.''
But news of the Daiwa debacle, the latest in a string of dire reports
about Japanese financial institutions to grab headlines, was almost
certain to fuel perceptions of a financial system in crisis, analysts
said.
''I've already had a couple of calls from US newspapers panting to
write a story about Japanese banks folding,'' said David Threadgold, an
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
''This does not give a good impression, and other Japanese banks are
going to get tarred with the same brush, whether they are guilty or
not.''
Daiwa Bank President Akira Fujita told a news conference that
Toshihide Iguchi, executive vice-president in charge of bond trading,
had run up losses of $1100m at Daiwa's New York office between 1984 and
1995. Mr Igushi was later arrested at his home in New Jersey and charged
with falsifying records and other crimes.
The deals were unauthorised and the losses not reported, bank and
finance ministry officials said.
A bank official said the losses did not involve trading in options or
derivatives, complex financial instruments traded by Nick Leeson, the
28-year-old trader who brought down Barings, Britain's oldest merchant
bank, last February.
How Daiwa's losses, run up in US Treasury bonds and bills, were hidden
from senior management was still under investigation, Mr Fujita said.
Banking experts said the hidden losses suggested Daiwa's internal
controls had been amazingly lax.
''I find it hard to believe that 'plain vanilla' transactions such as
these were being allowed to accumulate so long,'' said Larry Duke,
vice-president at Citibank. ''That's a real slack control system to say
the least.''
Daiwa's losses were but the latest in a string of bad news about
Japan's financial institutions in recent months.
In late August, authorities announced the Japan's first bank collapse
since the Second World War and shut down most business at its largest
credit union after a run on its deposits.
The news also comes on the eve of an interim report by a key advisory
panel, due out today, on how Japan should cope with financial
institutions' problem loans. These are estimated at about 50 trillion
yen.
Analysts are already worried the panel's recommendations will not go
far enough.
Japan's top central banker and the finance minister swiftly sought to
allay fears that Daiwa's losses would bring down the bank or spread to
other institutions.
''I believe the bank can well afford to cope with this loss and that
when considering their asset quality, profitability and unrealised gains
on their assets, this incident will not cause any concern over Daiwa's
fianancial strength,'' Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said in a
statement.
Daiwa itself said it would sell 30 billion yen in equities and 34
billion yen worth of real estate to secure a parent net profit of 7000m
yen for the six months to September 30.
''This incident is being considered as similar to Nick Leeson of
Barings, but the total loss for Barings was more than Barings' capital
base,'' a Finance Ministry official said.
''In the case of Daiwa the loss is only about one-seventh to
one-eighth of its total capital base, so this is not an ssue which could
shake Daiwa,'' he said.
More worrying for authorities is the prospect that the debacle will
stir up fresh concern abroad about the fragility of the country's
financial system. ''We are very much afraid of that,'' the finance
ministry official said.
Such fears could well be justified.
''US officials and the OECD and the Bank for International Settlements
have all been very strong in expresing concern over the situation here
in Japan,'' said Aaron Cohen, senior financial economist at Daiwa
Securities, which has no links to the bank. -- Reuter

IT is scant consolation to shareholders who happily bought into House
of Fraser 18 months ago at 180p and who are currently nursing a 17% loss
that the management is now doing all the right things.
To be fair, the retail climate could hardly be worse with household
insecurity compounded by the immeasurable effect of the National Lottery
even if the HoF average, or target, customer profile is somewhat
different to that of card scratchers.
However, only now can it be fully realised how underinvested the
company was at the time of flotation. There was and still is a dearth of
fully adequate management systems with EPOS still not completely
standard. That in part has resulted in the build-up of old stocks of
over six months which in all totalled #21m in January. These are being
drastically reduced at the appropriate selling seasons -- ladieswear and
accessories appear to have been the worst hit by poor in-store buying
decisions.
Sensibly, the exposure to electrical goods and furniture is being
reduced as the specialist operators can always always undercut while not
having to bear such large fixed overheads. Anecdotal evidence is in any
case that HoF is seen as being an expensive place to shop.
However, the emphasis on store renovation, which has led to an average
6% rise in like for like sales in most stores, is right as is the
reduction in the number of suppliers from 1800 to 1200 over a two-year
period. But the company's owns sales are lagging behind those of
in-store concessions -- Alexon announced a 12% rise in like for like
sales yesterday.
The consolation is that the chain will be in a better physical
condition than most of its competitors if there is an economic recovery
in perhaps 18 months time.
Profits for the year down from #35m to about #30m seem likely which
makes the stock dear at 17 times earnings and not that cheap even at 14
times for 1996-97. It is going to be a long haul although some comfort
could be administered through a liberal dividend policy to sweeten the
current 4.6% yield.

EDUCATION and information technology (IT) could be great levellers in
society but access is the key.
The problems that a poorly-educated workforce cause in terms of a
skills shortage have been widely documented. Even many of those people
who are well educated, with post-graduate qualifications, are often not
in receipt of the practical skills that many employers require such as
fluency in foreign languages.
There is a danger that unless a proper policy framework is put in
place to provide training in the use of information technology, from
early school days, a similar skills gap could occur.
There has been a lot of hype about the information superhighway and
how it is going to revolutionise our lives. What is already apparent is
that far from liberating us to enjoy more lesiure time, IT has actually
led to longer working hours for many employees.
What many people will be familar with is the increasing encroachment
of mobile phones, faxes and personal computers into everyday work and
social life. Everyday services such as shopping, banking and making
train reservations are all being computerised.
A recent report published by the electronics group Motorola in
association with Mori entitled ''Prepared for the Future? The British
and Technology'' shows a big social divide between those who are
technologically literate and those who are not.
Familiarity with and positive attitudes towards IT are noticeably
higher in those groups that already enjoy advantaged status in society
namely men, southerners, younger age groups, the employed, higher
socio-economic groups and the better educated.
Perhaps surprisingly, contrary to popular belief it is not spotty
teenage boys who are the most prevalent users of computer games, but
senior executives. They are nearly 1.5 times more likely to use computer
games than the general public.
Four out of five senior executives claim to be regular users of
personal computers compared with two out of five of the general public
and three out of five in socio-economic groups AB. They are also three
times more likely than the general population to use modems and four
times more likely to use the Internet.
Attitudes to IT are largely determined by experience and training at
work which automatically puts the elderly, unemployed and part-time
workers, of whom the vast majority are women, at a disadvantage.
Fifty-seven per cent of people out of work feel they are in danger of
being left behind in IT skills against 43% in full-time employment.
As many as one in five of the under-25s and a third of 25-44-year-olds
have received no IT training at all. In contrast, more than half of
senior executives have received in-house IT training, compared to 12% in
the general population.
Overall, the report shows that there exists a worrying level of
complacency about personal levels of IT proficiency. The people most in
need of IT training, those without any formal training and those who
started work before the IT revolution began, believe they are least in
need of IT training. More than half of those without training at all
believe they are adequately trained, and four out of five people who
have had some IT training think they have the right qualifications for
the job they are doing.
From the age of 45 there is a sharp drop in the levels of training,
equipment useage and familiarity with IT, indicating that people at the
peak of their career have not been able to keep up with the IT
revolution. This could be a particularly wasted opportunity.
People are living longer but face age discrimination from the age of
55. IT could provide a golden opportunity to harness the productive
skills of the middle-aged and mentally alert elderly for the good of
society.
If Britain is to remain competitive in global markets in the future it
will increasingly have to rely on its superior skills base to add value
to its products and services. Cheaper labour markets in the Far East and
eastern Europe mean that Britain will find it increasingly difficult to
compete in the production of basic goods.

A NEW facility for importing cars to Scotland from Europe by train via
the Channel tunnel was formally opened at the Eurocentral rail-freight
terminal near Mossend in Lanarkshire yesterday.
The #2m facility may also be used for exporting vehicles, but since it
became operational four weeks ago its sole user has been Ford, which
imports Mondeos by train from Ghent in Belgium.
The car terminal is operated by Autotrax, a joint venture between
British Rail and the automotive logistics firm Axial, which distributes
cars around Europe on behalf of several leading manufacturers.
It currently handles about four trains a week from Belgium, each one
carrying 200 cars.
Autotrax hopes the Scottish facility will soon start importing Ford
cars from Stuttgart in Germany and Citroen and Peugeot cars from France
as well.
The Autotrax terminal has parking space for 4000 vehicles, where
incoming cars can be cleaned, inspected and have accessories fitted
before being taken by road transporters to garage showrooms.
The Eurocentral rail-freight terminal opened a year ago, but until now
it has mainly handled container traffic. Scottish exports of whisky and
computer equipment account for a large slice of its throughput.

<TEXT>
THE Bank of England said yesterday it would be wrong to respond to the
first signs that the British economy might be slowing by easing monetary
policy.
The central bank's chief economist, Mervyn King, said it was committed
to the Government's target of bringing down the underlying inflation
rate to 2.5% in the medium-term and would not be swayed by short-term
fluctuations in economic data.
''It would be a serious mistake for monetary policy to look backwards
and respond simply to the latest quarterly growth rate rather than look
forward to what is likely to happen over the next two years, uncertain
though that outlook is,'' he said.
''And the attempt to fine-tune in our present state of ignorance is
likely to raise suspicions that an inflation surprise is on its way.''
The BoE recently responded to data suggesting economic growth is
slowing by dropping calls for a rise in interest rates it made earlier
in the year in the belief that a resurgence in inflation was imminent.
But it has warned that interest rates might still have to rise at some
point to ensure the Government meets its inflation target.
In a speech prepared for delivery at the Centre for Economic Policy
Research, Mr King said the weakness of sterling earlier this year could
push up inflation in the next few months.
''The fall in the sterling effective exchange rate of about 5% in the
early part of this year will place upward pressure on retail prices over
the next few months as cost increases pass down the supply chain,'' he
said.
''But the real question is how to prevent a temporary rise in measured
inflation from having second-round effects which jeopardise the
inflation target two years from now. Monetary policy must aim to prevent
these second-round effects from taking hold.''
King said the openness of the authorities in adopting a formal
inflation target and publishing minutes of monetary meetings between
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George had
led to a more intelligent public debate on policy.
''The negative effect has been that the need to look forward --
because of the lags in monetary policy -- has attracted some rather
unsophisticated criticisms of forecasting,'' he said. ''It is about
probabilities, not point estimates.''
The fact that the Government had set a range of 1%-4% around the 2.5%
inflation target did not imply it would be willing to settle for a
higher figure.
''The existence of a range does not mean that an average out-turn of
3.9% would be acceptable,'' Mr King said.
''If we are consistent in our pursuit of the inflation target then,
over a long period, the average inflation rate in the UK will be 2.5% or
less.'' -- Reuter.

Washington, Tuesday -- The US Federal Reserve decided today to leave
interest rates unchanged amid mounting signs that the 4[1/2]-year-old
economic recovery has gotten its second wind and is back on track.
With growth speeding up and inflation fading, the central bank's
policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had little reason to alter
policy at present.
The committee, composed of Fed board members and regional bank
presidents, provided no clues after its nearly 3[1/2]-hour meeting as to
whether it might lower rates in the months ahead.
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Friday that the economy
was looking up and that growth was not being held back by the
comparatively high level of short-term interest rates.
The Fed cut short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly
three years in July, trimming the federal funds rate that commercial
banks charge each other for money by a quarter percentage point to
5.75%.
But it has held rates steady since then as the economy has shown signs
of shaking off a second-quarter slowdown.
Mr Greenspan said he expects growth in the current quarter to top the
second quarter's anaemic 1.1% pace and analysts anticipate a further
strengthening in the months ahead.
Some though still expect the central bank to cut rates one more time
before the year is out to give the economy a helping hand into the 1996
presidential election year.
The Federal Reserve's goal is to keep the expansion that began more
than four years ago going at a rate around 2.5% a year -- enough to
create jobs without firing up inflation.
The trigger for the central bank's next rate cut could be an agreement
between the Republican-led Congress and the Clinton administration on a
plan to balance the federal Government budget, analysts said.
Although lower government budget deficits should help the economy in
the long-run by freeing up money for use by the private sector, they
could crimp growth in the short-run by cutting back on outlays to the
elderly and other groups.
Mr Greenspan stopped well short of promising a rate cut last week in
response to action on the budget. -- Reuter/AP

SCOTTISH Television shareholders at tomorrow's meeting called to
approve the complex #64m deal whereby Flextech will acquire a 20% stake
in the Glasgow- based television contractor will be encouraged by the
progress of HTV, writes ANDREW WILSON.
As part of the package, the cable and satellite company is handing
over its 20% stake in the Wales and West of England television company
to Scottish.
That has prompted the inevitable suggestions of a takeover by STV
although yesterday HTV chairman Louis Sherwood denied that he was in
talks with Scottish Television's Gus Macdonald.
The City believes that HTV would demand a good price for its favours
given the half-year figures to June. These showed pre-tax profits up
120% to #6.1m on turnover 16% ahead at #66.4m.
The company has shown a substantial recovery from 1992 when it fell
into losses when its sold more advertising air time than it was able to
deliver.
In the latest period, HTV increased advertising revenue by 5.4% to
#47.7m and holds a 6% market share which it expects to raise in the
current half-year, helped by the above-average proportion of ABC1 and
young viewers, a strengthened sales effort and regional programme
sponsorship.
Overall broadcasting profits increased by 12% to #15.8m while the
relatively recently formed rights division which sells library stock
tripled its contribution to #2.1m.
The company is also active in supplying cable companies and appears to
be more advanced than STV is this sector and operates outside ts
traditional terrestial franchise area.
The interim divdend has been raised 67% to 1.25p.
HTV shares closed 1p better at 233p for a #205m market capitalisation
compared with the #240m of STV.

THERE was relief in the City yesterday after the House of Fraser
stores group gave assurances there was no substantial amount of goods
mouldering away in the back of stock rooms.
In the half-year to end-July, it achieved a 2.2% rise in like-for-like
sales although overall turnover eased #3m to #323m. This drop reflected
the closure of three stores to leave the Glasgow-founded company with a
total of 52.
The best result came from Frasers in Edinburgh which has been
substantially refurbished -- according to managing director Andrew
Jennings it has changed beyond all recognition. It achieved a 19% rise
in like-for-like sales, while the Glasgow store was above the group
average.
There was the expected group pre-tax loss of #4.3m, little changed on
the previous year's #4.5m, and much in line with broker forecasts.
The interim dividend has been held at 1.7p.
The shares initially eased to 141p but recovered to close 6p better on
the day at 150p.
HoF was floated in March last year at 180p for a #413m market
capitalisation. The shares were sold by the Fayed brothers -- they kept
the group's Harrods flagship, leaving the on-going HoF with Dickins &amp;
Jones as its premier store. The latter is currently benefiting from a
near #20m renovation.
Chairman Brian McGowan said there was little encouragement for the
retail sector which is so important to the UK economy and pointed to the
tax increases in the spring.
He also blamed the National Lottery which takes #100m a week out of
non-food retail sales, the wet spring and the very hot July.
That continued into August which forced like-for-like sales down by
4%, although September has managed level pegging with last year.
Gross margins fell 1.7% to 31.2%. While they are expected to recover
in the current six months, they will not achieve the 32.9% seen last
year. This reflects the closure of the Bradford, Bridlington and South
Shields stores, the marking down of stock as some outlets are converted
more to speciality shops and the selling down of old stock amounting to
#10m in January and a residual #1.2m by July.
Some 20 stores have been refurbished in the last 18 months with more
to come. However, there are about five that run the risk of closure in
due course, although this is not thought to include any in Scotland.
Both Dundee and Paisley are trading ''pretty well on average'', while
Inverness has benefited from investment.
Overall there was little variation across Britain, although the Army &amp;
Navy store in London's Victoria has proved disappointing so far this
year.
The four out-of-town stores, including the now fabled Lakeside at
Thurrock, Essex, all showed double-digit rises in sales.
HoF started the financial year with some #21m of stock that was more
than six months old, some as much as three years old. That will continue
to affect margins in the current half-year as the remainder is sold off,
but Mr Jennings was adamant a similar situation would not recur.
Sales of menswear improved by 12% and perfumery by 7%, with ladieswear
and accessories both up 4%.
In contrast, there was a 5% decline in electrical goods and a 7%
setback in furniture -- although Mr McGowan does not appear to be
especially concerned about that as it occupies a lot of space with an
inadequate return on capital.
Concessions now account for an ever increasing proportion of sales, up
from 29% to 33%, and the aim is to reduce this as a fraction of the
total. The HoF own-label brands have so far proved a disappointment at
only 8% of the total.
The first benefits from the new distribution centre in Northampton
which is run by Christian Salvesen should be seen early next year,
although the full impact will come from late 1997 onwards.

BILL Scott has resigned as chief executive of Ferguson Shipbuilders,
the Port Glasgow shipyard which he virtually rebuilt from scratch after
a management buy-out from British Shipbuilders in 1989, writes ROBERT
POWELL.
His surprise departure follows the takeover of Ferguson by 80-year-old
millionaire Frank Dunnet in July, a move which split the board, but
which Mr Scott supported.
Finance director Richard Dean said Mr Scott handed in his resignation
last Friday, but would stay on as chief executive until the end of
October. A successor has not yet been chosen.
Mr Dean denied suggestions that Mr Scott had fallen out with
Ferguson's new owner and said his departure had been amicable.
''There was no acrimony at all,'' he said.
Mr Scott, 54, was not available for comment.
The shipyard employs around 350 people and makes small specialist
ships such as tugs and ferries. It made a pre-tax profit of #1.5m last
year on sales of #19.3m.
But when Mr Scott took over as part of a management buy-out team in
1989 Ferguson had only a skeleton staff of 34 employees. Its turnaround
since then has been one of the few success stories in the British
shipbuilding industry over the past 20 years.
Mr Dean said Ferguson had not secured any new orders since its
takeover by Mr Dunnet's electrical wholesale firm Holland House three
months ago, but there was still plenty of work in the pipeline.
''We have got four ships to deliver in the next nine months so we are
not short of work,'' he said.
The MBO in 1989 proved shortlived since the Norwegian shipbuilding
firm Kvaerner bought a 75% stake in Ferguson a year later and Mr Scott
left.
But he returned in 1991 as part of a consortium led by Sir Ross Belch,
another veteran of British Shipbuilders, which bought the company for
#225,000.
Ferguson then received a #1.2m equity boost from private shareholders
under the Business Expansion Scheme.
The shipyard's sale to Holland House for #4.9m three months ago
followed a failed attempt by Sir Ross earlier this year to buy Ferguson
outright through a small shipping company of which he is chairman.

THE Chancellor's priority in his autumn Budget should be tax cuts
which help small businesses, while reductions in income tax should only
be undertaken when they are sustainable, probably starting in 1997-98,
according to the Institute of Directors' Budget representations.
It is calling for the abolition of both capital gains tax on assets
held over three years and of inheritance tax to encourage a greater
supply of savings for investment.
The Chancellor is also urged to cut back the overall level of public
expenditure. However, the IoD said significant reductions could only be
achieved by fundamental reforms to welfare expenditure which could not
be done overnight.
So it is recommending that the Government develop and adopt policies
in the longer term which aim to switch substantially more welfare
provision from the public to the private sector. In the shorter term it
would like the Government to reduce public expenditure on a phased basis
over the Public Expenditure Survey period -- starting with cuts of
around #3000m to #4000m for 1996-97.
IoD director-general Tim Melville-Ross, introducing the submissions,
said that high capital taxes discouraged savings and much needed
investment. ''Our recommended radical reform of these taxes should help
investment, economic growth and jobs,'' he said. He added that, in
particular, it should help the small to medium-sized businesses which
were widely acknowledged as the main job creators.
While recognising the political significance of this year's Budget,
the IoD recommendations make plain that it expects the Chancellor to
maintain responsible economic management. This means adhering to his low
inflation policy and ensuring the mix of fiscal and interest rate
policies have the clear goal of keeping inflation down.
The IoD does believe, though, that the tax burden is too high and
should be reduced -- along with the necessary cuts in public
expenditure. It advocates that there should be a three-year rolling
programme of tax cuts totalling #3500m in 1996-97, with reductions of
#8500m and #12bn for the following two financial years.
It would like to lower income tax and corporation tax rates, but only
when it is clear that a reduction is sustainable, and probably starting
in financial year 1997-98.
''We strongly support the objective of a 20p basic rate of income tax,
and we urge the Chancellor to move towards this rate by reducing the
basic rate by 1.5p in 1997-98 and 1998-99. A cut of one percentage point
in corporation tax should accompany the income tax reductions in
1997-98,'' the IoD said.
There should be no new taxes and, in particular, no landfill tax and
the insurance premium tax should be abolished. The IoD has also come
down against calls for tax boosts to the housing market which, it said,
should be resisted. It is not clear that such measures would have a
lasting impact and they could only increase the overall burden for other
taxpayers.

MERCHANT BANKING
SHARES in merchant bank Quayle Munro Holdings yesterday surged 32p to
185p, a new closing high for the year, after it announced that net asset
value per share was currently 250p.
The Edinburgh-based group's shares fell heavily last month after
Leeds-based flexible packaging group Parkside International, of which
Quayle Munro owned 6%, issued a profits warning.
Parkside shares plunged and nearly #600,000 was wiped off the value of
Quayle Munro's holding.
Although the merchant bank recovered this loss with the sale of its
stake to Greenock-based British Polythene Industries, which two weeks
ago announced a #24m bid for Parkside, the City did not immediately
restore Quayle Munro shares to their former value.
However, they bounced back yesterday after the merchant bank announced
results for the year to end-June.
Net asset value rose from 234p to 244p during the 12 months, with the
year-end position a marked improvement on the 222p interim level.
As a result of the post-year-end advance of shares in Forward Group,
which Quayle Munro holds as a result of Forward's takeover of
Selkirk-based Exacta Circuits earlier this year, net asset value is
currently about 250p.
The sale of its investment in Exacta to Forward was also the major
factor in the second-half net asset value advance.
Other unquoted investments also performed satisfactorily, more than
offsetting disappointing showings by some of Quayle Munro's listed
investments.
The merchant bank believes it reasonable to contemplate a further
advance in net asset value in the current year, although it added that
this would be partially dependent on stock market movements.
Revenue before taxation edged up from #670,000 to #674,000, although
the previous year's figure was #770,000 before exceptional charges.
The total dividend is 5.6% higher at 9.5p, after a final payout of
6.5p.
Quayle Munro, which raised net asset value by 55% between listing in
June 1993 and end-June this year, is probably best known for its
high-profile work for the Scottish Office.
In July, it was commissioned to study privatisation possibilities
within Highlands and Islands Airports.
Corporate finance activity, which was low during the first six months,
picked up during the second half, according to chief executive Ian
Jones. Quayle Munro said activity had been satisfactory since the
year-end.
Earnings per share were up 17.1% at 13.79p, helped by an abnormally
low tax charge.

Fans of the City of Glasgow Philharmonic can look forward to a season
with a difference, Michael Tumelty reveals, as the orchestra broadens
its repertoire and changes its presentation, but retains its sense of
fun
THERE are changes afoot at the City of Glasgow Philharmonic Orchestra,
which is limbering up for a new winter season of light classical and
middle-of-the-road concerts at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall.
The changes will not be sudden or dramatic -- indeed some of them are
behind the scenes and connected with the business and artistic
administration of the band -- but the large following for this popular
and populist orchestra will become aware of a broadening of the palette
as the season gets under way.
Though such a statement might anger the passionately devoted fans of
the CGPO, it is the case that in recent years a feeling of deja vu has
crept into the organisation, both in terms of its musical horizons and
its presentation by the avuncular conductor and artistic director, Iain
Sutherland.
The Philharmonic orchestra has fashioned a niche (and a series of full
houses and sold-out concert programmes) out of an area of the repertoire
that it has made its own: from the smash hits of the classics (Classical
Sensations), to popular songs from Broadway and West End musicals, to
evenings of perfume and high romance (Valentine's nights, Viennese
nights), to good old-fashioned evenings of music from the movies.
Equally, however, there is a finite number of these programmes, and --
rightly or wrongly -- a perception has been growing, among more
objective assessors, that the entire venture was becoming cyclical and a
wee bit formularised. That concern was not limited to outsiders.
''We have been doing the same thing -- successfully -- year in, year
out,'' said John Donachy, chairman of the CGPO Foundation. ''We thought
we must introduce greater variety; some people probably don't want to
keep on hearing such a repetition of the major elements of our
success.''
Additionally, said Donachy, the CGPO felt increasingly that it was
being ''crowded'' by other orchestras beginning to impinge on the
repertoire that the Philharmonic considers its own specialised
territory. ''So we are going to be introducing a bit of variety, and
some novelty,'' he said.
It is also the case, he made clear, that the Philharmonic is just as
concerned about developing a younger and broader-based audience as every
other orchestra in the land (without, of course, endangering its core
support).
The Phil will be dipping a toe in the water -- ''starting to feel our
way'', said Donachy -- in its opening concert, next Sunday, in which the
guest star will be songstress Carol Kidd. For many, the finest jazz
singer in the land, and -- without argument -- one of the best
balladeers in the business, Kidd will appear in a mixed programme in
which she will be accompanied both by the orchestra and by her more
orthodox trio.
Later in the season, and heading off in a completely different
direction, the best-known Oz in the business, Rolf Harris, will return
to the Phil with his own audio visual presentation of the zany exploits
of Coojiebear and the Monster -- one for the young 'uns.
But the big change at the Phil this season will be the new faces in
front of the 65-strong band. You might have been forgiven for thinking
that, with the omnipresent Iain Sutherland in control (verbal and stick)
at the front, the CGPO was a one-man operation. Maybe it was. But, in
the quest to broaden horizons, the board is bringing in some variety.
''By widening the scope of artists and programmes, we hope to widen the
scope -- and age -- of our audience,'' said John Donachy.
The opening concert will be conducted by Adrian Drover, Carol Kidd's
own musical director, who will be furnishing arrangements for the
occasion. For the orchestra's November concert, the engaging,
effervescent, and loquacious Irishman, Christopher Bell, takes the stick
for the first time at the Phil. (He has already established himself,
last season, at the Children's Foundation concerts, as an amiable and
witty presenter; and this aspect of the CGPO philosophy -- communication
with the audience -- remains not only unchanged, but inviolable.) The
Rolf Harris spectacular next February will be conducted by Barry Booth,
who co-wrote Coojiebear.
Iain Sutherland will remain principal conductor, of course, and will
appear with the CGPO in regular programmes such as Classical Sensations,
the popular Christmas Cracker programmes, and the St Patrick's Night
show (though in the last, there will be a guest presenter, Henry Kelly
of Classic FM).
Behind the scenes there is a tightening of procedures. Programmes are
being subjected to a budgetary control that is vital to the survival of
the orchestra. Some of that discipline should be perceived out front:
Philharmonic concerts are famous (notorious) for tending to ramble.
Valued by its audience though the chat is, it can go on a bit, rather
elongating the evening both for orchestra and patrons.
''There will not be any over-runs, either at rehearsal or concert,''
assures John Donachy. People -- including the musicians -- will be able
to get their buses and trains. Every conductor will have to shut up and
get on with it.'' And so say all of us.

THE days of the British Empire might be over but a new force is
colouring the atlas pink. Glasgay! is putting Glasgow firmly on the map;
rapidly expanding from its inception in 1992 to the confident claim that
it is now the biggest lesbian and gay arts festival in Europe on only
its second outing. Organisers predict that it will attract substantial
number of visitors to the city.
Details of the festival were announced at a colourful,
pink-balloon-festooned bash at Glasgow's Cottier Theatre yesterday. Even
at this late stage -- Glasgay! kicks off its 10-day bonanza on October
27 -- events are still mushrooming across the city; artistic director
Cordelia Ditton puts the current tally at 84 events and counting.
It's an impressive programme of wide appeal, from the Poem A Day
series from Edwin Morgan to The Glasgay! Internet Experience, with
events taking place in a variety of venues, from the nightclub Bennetts
to St Bride's Episcopal Church, which hosts an evening of Benjamin
Britten music by Capella Nova.
Particularly substantial is the theatre and dance programme, with 18
companies presenting 58 performances. These include a solo show by the
acclaimed writer and performer Neil Bartlett at the Citizens', Clyde
Unity Theatre's A Little Older at the Tron and a production of Jonathon
Harvey's latest work, Rupert Street Lonely Hearts Club, also at the
Tron. Starving Artists reprise their '95 Fringe hit Sleeping with You at
the Arches and Nonsuch productions present a dance-theatre collaboration
Jardin Animee at the Cottier.
Higlights of the extensive music programme include the SAM Gay Men's
Chorus The Sound of Debutants in what promises to be a frolic-filled
night, and the unusual collaboration between the Scottish singer Horse
MacDonald and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra at Barrowland. A taster of
this set whetted everyone's appetite while Horse's photo-opportunity
antics with an actual 16-hand gee-gee provided an appropriate focus for
the Wild Wild West Country and Western Hoedown, to be held at the
Cottier on October 30.

EVER since I left the Labour Party to join the SNP, there has been
something puzzling me. Perhaps your correspondents George Robertson or
Norman Hogg (September 25) can help me out.
What I am struggling to understand is why a belief in Scottish
self-government makes me a ''nationalist'' when apparently a belief in
British (or French, Italian, German) self-government doesn't.
Given that national frontiers are fairly arbitrary things -- lines
drawn on a map at some point in history -- how does a preference for one
set of frontiers over another mark some of us out as ''nationalists''?
What makes the English Channel a more acceptable boundary (in the cases
of Messrs Robertson and Hogg) than the line draws from Solway to Tweed?
Perhaps a ''nationalist'' is someone who wants to change frontiers:
whereas someone who wants to retain the status quo is not a
''nationalist''? Is that it? A bit tough on the Latvians, Slovenians,
Finns, and all other small democratic and peaceful nations who have
re-drawn their frontiers this century.
Does the Labour Party regret the collapse of the Russian Empire? I
think we should be told.
Or could it be that George Robertson and Co don't accept the concept
of British nationalism? If so, let me recommend to them the excellent
account by the Yale historian Linda Colley, Britons: the Forging of a
Nation, which describes very clearly the quite conscious and systematic
processes whereby London governments of the eighteenth century promoted
a British nationalism of the most jingoistic kind.
Or if he is too busy slandering the SNP to have time for reading,
perhaps Mr Robertson could just cast his mind back to that infamous
emergency debate in the House of Commons when Argentina invaded the
Falklands/Malvinas. I can remember listening with mounting disgust to
the imperialistic rantings from the Labour front bench. The
''nationalists'' weren't sitting on the SNP benches that day.
Let me make something quite clear to George Robertson. I want Scotland
to be self-governing not because I am a ''nationalist,'' but because I
believe that a self-governing Scotland stands a much better chance of
being a socialist country than does the UK.
Oops! So that's why he is so afraid of the SNP.

HENRY McCubbin's statement that ''there is no independence in the
European Union'' will be news to Denmark, Ireland, Luxemburg and the
other member states of the EU (September 24).
The SNP's position is quite clear. It seeks for Scotland equality of
status with other European nations and a direct Scottish voice in the
decision-making bodies of the EU, aspirations which are shared by a
majority of Mr McCubbin's former constituents in the North-east of
Scotland. The reality is that these objectives can only be achieved
through independence in Europe.
It is to the SNP's credit that it is prepared to debate, openly and
fully, the many complex issues arising out of the development of the EU.
My speech to the SNP's annual conference in Perth was made as part of
that ongoing debate.
Mr McCubbin is unlikely to encounter a similar debate within any of
the other main political parties in Scotland. Rather than attacking the
SNP he should concentrate his efforts on initiating such a debate within
his own party.

* THERE has been a superb response to our prize-ticket competition,
held in association with the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall which next week
celebrates its fifth birthday. Beginning next Monday, the hall will
stage six celebratory, star-studded concerts over five nights.
The gala week will feature great orchestras: the St Petersburg
Philharmonic and their music director, the charismatic Yuri Temirkanov,
who, in three concerts over two evenings, will play the complete
symphonies of Tchaikovsky.
Scotland's own Royal SNO, with their Russian principal guest conductor
Alexander Lazarev, will perform a gala of extracts from Russian and
Italian operas with lead singers from the Bolshoi Opera in Moscow.
The week opens on Monday night with the spectacular Wadaiko Ichiro
drummers from Osaka, and ends on Friday with a recital by the great
Spanish diva, Montserrat Caballe. The entire week represents a unique
concentration of world-class artists.
The prize in our Dream Ticket competition is three pairs of top-price
tickets for every event in the Royal Concert Hall's fifth anniversary
gala week. Each set of tickets is worth more than #250.
Almost 450 entries were received from throughout Scotland, from
Inverness to Dumfries. Though the official closing date was first post
on Monday, to allow for the Glasgow bank holiday that day, the deadline
was extended to yesterday morning. All entries received by then were
thus valid.
* Answers: Question 1. c) Freddie Mercury; Question 2. b) Leningrad
Philharmonic; Question 3. b) St Andrew's Hall.
* Winning entries: Mrs M Harrington of Kirkintilloch; Mr R Campbell of
Glasgow; Mrs Sim of the Isle of Arran.

THIS is Glasgow's first sighting of Rambert since the conpany's
relaunch last November. Not that Glasgow saw all that much of them
before then -- well, not latterly, anyhow. Will this quadruple bill
rekindle old loyalties and spark off new ones? Possibly . . . I suspect
that the second programme (opening tomorrow night) packs more immediate
appeal.
This package, however, does offer some intriguing challenges, a
liberal dash of quirkiness and -- in the case of Kylian's Petite Mort --
a frisson of sexy innuendo that is positively rippling with athletic
double work and sinuous double entendre.
Symbolism runs in Matthew Hawkins' Dancing Attendance on the Cultural
Chasm. The juxtaposition that Hawkins engineers startles one into
looking afresh at such cliches as the swan on pointe. But then the
costumes, by Pearl -- bodysuits with strategic lacy additions -- startle
one into looking at the dancers bodies anyway!
This is an exotic, serious piece full of humour and complexity. One
that actually gets better the more you see it. I'd like to say the same
for Per Jonsson's Jupiter is Crying not least because it was such a
successful springboard for the education project at Grangemouth.
But somehow it's hard to see what the significant nuances are amid the
drumming and thrumming, the angst-ridden melees that ebb and flow at
full tilt across the stage.
Axioma 7 is a finale full of jokey, ridiculous moves -- a kind of
strip poker-cum-musical chairs to begin with. But, as it progresses,
again one senses a darker undertow: being odd one out isn't always fun.
Rambert, however, manages to be classy and entertaining in the one
programme and truly deserves a show of interest from Glasgow.

encouraging nationalist ''terrorists'' and extremists a bit rich?
Isn't it his own party, after all, which has long since harboured many
individuals who have sympathised with, and supported, the more extreme
and violent elements within the Irish and Palestinian nationalist causes
through the years, to name but a few.
In comparison, if he asks himself how many have died a violent death
in the cause of Scottish nationalism this century I fear he would be
struggling to reach single figures.

I AM happy to reassure Norman Hogg, worried about citizenship in an
independent Scotland (September 25). It has been settled Scottish
National Party policy for many years that on day one of independence
everyone resident here will be regarded as a citizen.
Moreover, for those who opt not to accept that offer but wish to
retain a different citizenship, there is the right of permanent
residence and of return.
I hope that Norman Hogg will recognise that the SNP's policy on
citizenship is at least as enlightened as the policy of any British
party and the position of our residents is more secure.
More than that, citizenship, far from being dependent on the SNP or
any other government of the day to define, would be entrenched in a
written constitution, in complete contrast to the present UK position.
In any case, as a member nation of the European Union all citizens of
Scotland will be simultaneously both Scots and Europeans. The SNP's
nationalism is not exclusive but inclusive.

Deputy Leader,

I WOULD like to comment on the letters from Messrs Fairlie and
McCubbin anent the Scottish National Party's ''Independence in Europe''
policy (September 25)
Mr McCubbin describes Independence in Europe as just a slogan. Far
from being that, it is as clear a blueprint as anyone could want.
Treaties, running to hundreds of pages, define precisely the position of
an independent member nation of five million. Scotland's position would
be exactly the same as Denmark or Finland.
What the debate was about -- and I would have expected Mr Fairlie to
welcome such a discussion -- was possible future developments in the
European Union (via the IGC), and the SNP's attitude towards such
developments.
Our conference in Perth last week had a chance to express views on
various aspects of a complex series of issues. These will now be studied
in depth by a working group before coming back to the party for
ratification or amendment.
I assume that all other parties -- not just in Scotland but across
Europe -- will be undertaking a similar process.

THE recent controversy over Chris Patten's comments about immigration
from Hong Kong is a perfect opportunity for the Scottish establishment
to exert its latent rights prior to the establishment of a parliament
for the country and extend a qualified welcome to some of the Hong Kong
Chinese.
We have an ideal location for Hong Kong Chinese enterprise in Dunoon
and its hinterland on the Cowal peninsula recently vacated by the
American Navy, and an area badly in need of economic regeneration.
The plan would be to set up a special relocation development zone and
to offer certain Hong Kong Chinese the right to live there for, say, 10
years.
Their passports would be stamped with this restriction, very like a
visa, but after 10 years the restriction would be cancelled and a full
passport issued with the right of abode anywhere in these islands.
The qualification for this opportunity would be monetary one, eg a
minimum deposit of #20,000, thus reducing the potential influx to
manageable proportions.
For those in the affected area who object to this scheme, and there
would probably be very few given the almost certain increase in
prosperity within a short space of time, the Government would make a
reciprocal offer of #20,000 and rehousing in Rothesay.
The rest of us could sit back and await some interesting comparisons
in five years and congratulate ourselves on making a canny Scottish
investment in the future.

I WRITE in response to the ill-founded observations in Ian Davis's
letter in defence of waterskiers (September 19). He chooses to deplore
only those sections of the by-laws attempting to reasonably contain the
activities of the minority group on whose behalf he speaks, ex cathedra.
Nowhere does he applaud the benefits otherwise accruing to the
majority of Loch Lomond users -- canoeing, sailing, windsurfing,
fishing, etc -- and is clearly out of touch with the realities of the
situation on this loch.
Not only do the water/jet-ski fraternity now find themselves pariahs
due to their overall lack of consideration for others, but they have
succeeded in completely destroying the fishing in the once famous
Millarochy Bay.
Not satisfied with this, and apparently in attempt to avoid the
overcrowding created by their peers, they surreptitiously launch from
any ''gap in the trees'' between Manse Bay (where they are now persona
non grata), Sallochy, and Rowardennan for the price of pitching a tent
on the Forest Enterprise site at Cashel.
The fishing no longer exists between Balmaha and Ross Point and on
September 19 and 20 six power boats and two jet-skis, apparently from
Inverbeg, occupied the small secluded sandy bay at the east end of
'Lonaig where they displayed their inane skills between noon and 7pm
cutting up each others' wakes towing giant rubber tyres along the east
and north face of 'Lonaig, previously one of the most prolific sea-trout
and salmon areas during August, September, and October.
Are these ''decent folk going about their recreation in an inoffensive
way''? In reality these are the majority! The minority are those one
occasionally sees out in the middle of the loch thoroughly enjoying
themselves freed from the continuous-pass, hour-after-hour pursuit of an
audience!
Mr Davis's fraternity spurned the opportunity previously offered by
the Park Authority in the form of reasonable notices at Millarochy where
their contempt for such an approach was compounded by their displays of
mindless skill using the 5mph marker buoys as obstacle courses.
It is questionable whether 5% of his membership know the first rule of
passing an approach vessel; or the simple difference between the lee of
a vessel and that of its lee shore, or could name any six islands or
shorelines on Loch Lomond.
One too frequently sees 15-year-olds operating boats capable of speeds
up to 50 knots. Heaven preserve us from such advocates of the overworked
platitude ''live and let live'' -- the true absurdity of which is only
brought home when one extrapolates beyond its warm-sounding
acceptability.
References to breeding season of wildlife being ''limited to only
short periods in the year'' are nonsense. Mallard and sawbill-duck young
can be seen on Loch Lomond as early as April and as late as September,
and one only need see an entire family of week-old sawbills flung on to
the rocks by the wash from these people, on whose behalf Mr Davis
writes, to appreciate that there are needs on Loch Lomond other than
human.
The only alternative to these long-overdue by-laws is a complete ban
on all power-driven craft capable of speeds above six knots. Sanity will
then be restored to this loch whose true amenity value lies in the quiet
water-borne pursuits not needing an audience and those others incapable
of destroying the peace and quiet which should obtain along its shores.
I have fished Loch Lomond for 31 years and have been obliged to watch
this unobtrusive pastime destroyed, exponentially, over the past 10
years by the body on whose behalf Mr Davis speaks.

WITHIN your report, Royal visit to Scots prison is cancelled, you
suggested that prison staff in English prisons were selecting prisoners
for mandatory drug testing who were known to be drug-free and therefore
the scheme was ''guaranteed to be muted'' (September 22).
Had you checked with us we would have told you that nothing could be
further from the truth. Selection of those to be tested is controlled by
computer and completely random. Strict security is in place to ensure
the samples cannot be tampered with.
Those prisoners who are suspected of drug use and are not selected by
the computer can be targeted. In these cases 70% are proving positive.
We in England are working very hard to reduce both the supply and the
demand for drugs in our prisons. Mandatory testing is an important part
of the strategy.

Mark Fisher on a flight of pure fantasy, Swedish quartet included
NOT wanting to give too much away about her venue's most intriguing
commission to date, the Lemon Tree press officer ventures to hint at
Swedish folk dancing.
Well, why not? Hint away! She's talking, after all, about a project
involving Forkbeard Fantasy, and when Forkbeard Fantasy are involved, it
isn't just that anything is possible, it's more that the more impossible
it sounds, the more likely it is.
So, yes, if there were to be a multi-media event in a small, dynamic
arts centre in Aberdeen, an event that combined video, music, and
theatre, that brought together the talents of Scotland's only Swedish
string quartet-in-residence -- the Yggdrasil Quartet -- a local video
training project, and Chris Britton of Forkbeard Fantasy (aka the
Brittonioni Brothers), and if that event did not include Swedish folk
dancing, well, you'd have the right to feel let down.
What's the Score? opens tonight, setting itself ''to boldly go where
no string quartet has gone before, playing exquisite music in absolutely
extraordinary circumstances.''
If you thought string quartets were all about dinner jackets, hushed
reverence, and seriousness, then the Yggdrasils are about to make you
think again. They'll be playing Beethoven's Quartet in C Major Opus 59
no. 3 more or less straight, but the fun and games between the
movements, and on the video monitors throughout, promise to show old
Ludwig in rather a different light.
So what's with the Swedish folk dancing, I demand of Chris Britton.
''They do go into this'', he admits a little sheepishly. ''But it
doesn't have a huge amount to do with the overall structure. It takes
people completely by surprise because it's so different to everything
else that's been going on.''
That's one surprise I've blown then. I do, however, promise to keep
quiet about the explosive finale Britton has in store, one that makes
use of a typically Forkbeardian prop, like the highly-sprung pop-up
projection screen and the disintegrating radio he's also devised for
this piece. They're gadgets that Britton will make use of in his guise
as Professor Davidson, a knowledgeable but hugely-irritating character
with a tendency to interrupt the Yggdrasil Quartet with streams of
multisyllabic musical insights.
The whole unlikely collaboration is the brainchild of the Lemon Tree's
artistic director, Shona Powell. She dreamed up the idea of teaming
Britton (whose 20-year track record includes a show starring a forklift
truck wrapped in cling-film and another featuring an eight-foot high
church on springs) with the Yggdrasil Quartet (four Swedes relocated to
Aberdeen), Aberdeen Video Access (a community video resource led by
film-maker Brian Keeley offering training to local people) and the
put-upon Lemon Tree technical team.
Britton is the mastermind behind What's the Score's overall shape, but
inevitably with such a diverse artistic team, the devised show has a
strong collaborative bent.
Whether it will anger the Beethoven purists or befuddle the theatre
audience will remain to be seen. Britton reckons he should be able to
appease both camps, while turning each on to the attractions of the
other.
''I'm sure people who don't normally go to classical concerts will be
pleasantly surprised by how fantastic it is,'' says Britton, explaining
that if the three performances from tonight until Friday go according to
plan, they hope to set up a tour for next year that may even stretch as
far as Sweden.

BRAINY nineties art-popsters certainly know their musical history,
deriving strength from informed diversity. On Monday night Mouse On Mars
revealed themselves to be three young, very shy German devotees of dub
reggae in general and seventies electronic-rockers Can in particular.
One Mouse-boy subtly wielded a mutoid double-necked guitar, initially
invoking painful memories of another, rightly-derided seventies act,
Wishbone Ash. Mouse No 2 spent much of the evening crouched
apologetically beneath a table laden with jumbled copper coils,
capacitors and wires, tweaking all manner of glacial sonic ambience into
being while the trio's drummer provided deft, organic, and plangent
poly-rhythms.
Glasgow liked them. So much so that the conclusion of one piece of
MOM's new-age skank was greeted with a roar of approval fierce enough to
cause the band's guitarist to jump in fright. Startle yourself
pleasantly with Mouse On Mars' two albums to date, Vulvaland and Iaora
Tahiti.
But what of Anglo-Gallic male-female sextet Stereolab? They are a more
severe B52s; a more playful Velvet Underground; a more diffuse and
democratic Talking Heads; Kraftwerk playing the songs of Burt Bacharach;
the Swingle Singers with a sense of alienation.
Sadly, though, while these are all interesting things to be, they can
also prove uninvolving and somewhat bloodless things to be. Indeed, it
wasn't until Stereolab's three final offerings that we were swept away
by an overwhelming wall of noise, having hitherto been mildly diverted
by an overly-manicured hedge of noise.
Historical excavation can sometimes be too dry and dusty a process.

CAN I correct the unfortunate impression given by Mr Brian Donohoe,
MP, in his recent statements on the levels of private patient health
care in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS Trust, that the trust is
catering for a large volume of private patients? That is not true.
More than 50% (#423,000) of our private income is from the In Vitro
Fertilisation Service. This is a largely out-patient service on which
different health boards have different policies.
However, Lothian Health chose not to fund this service. The trust see
this as a valuable service which should be available to Lothian and east
coast patients and therefore we provide it as a funded service. This
service is provided at the same cost base as the NHS and is certainly
not a significant revenue generator for the trust.
Indeed, this service helps support research, development and teaching
in this speciality. The RIE has the Medical Research Council
Reproductive Biology Centre on its campus which is an internationally
recognised centre of excellence.
Some #213,000 (or 25%) is funded from treating 33 private patients for
cardiac surgery in the same wards and facilities as NHS patients. This
is done to utilise the extra capacity after we have delivered the 750
operations authorised by the NHS Health Boards.
We believe there is an unmet need for cardiac surgery. The trust
intends to continue to support this service because by training 33
private patients we have shortened the waiting lists for NHS patients.
The remainder of income is spread over a variety of specialities and
includes income generated by clinical expert opinion requested by
insurance companies, patients or lawyers on cases which may lead to
compensation claims. This activity arises mainly because we are a
university teaching hospital with internationally acknowledged clinical
expertise and opinion is sought from all over the UK.
From this analysis you will see that the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh
does not run a large private health facility and I hope these facts
provide a more accurate picture.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Union affairs are bumping along badly at the moment but there
is a tendency for two quite distinct problems to become confusingly
entangled. The first is more easily described, for it concerns President
Jacques Chirac of France who appears determined to prove in office the
suspicions of unpredictable behaviour which were held in check so well
during his presidential campaign. President Chirac's lively behaviour
can be an asset. He can also be distressingly disruptive. His
determination to carry out nuclear tests in the Pacific is coupled with
an approach to security and defence issues which has caused considerable
confusion. If this were not bad enough, he has chosen a time of tension
over European monetary union to deliberately upset some of his peers.
The Austrian Chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, is furious about the abusive
way in which Chirac treated one of his statements at the Majorca summit.
Vranitzky, it seems, was trying to be nice to Chirac, but was ridiculed
for his pains.
The eccentricities of President Chirac will have to be accommodated.
He will in all probability be around for a considerable time and no
matter how he behaves France will continue to be at the core of the
European Union. Unfortunately, the argument over the proposed single
currency has quickened with what appears at first sight to be overly
aggressive statements from German monetary officials and the Bundesbank.
Finance Minister Theo Waigel upset the Italians at the Majorca summit by
suggesting that they would not be in a position to join the EMU in 1999.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has made it clear that
the bank will make its own public judgments on those EU members that it
considers able to qualify to take part in monetary union. Accompanying
this is firm insistence from Germany that the strict standards which
each nation must meet before joining in monetary union should not be
relaxed and that meeting these conditions is more important than a
timetable. Chancellor Kohl, with political imperatives in mind,
disagrees on the last point. There will be no discussion of delays in
EMU if he has his way.
It is painfully easy to be affronted at the attitude of the Germans.
The knee-jerk reaction is to ask what right they have to make judgments
on who should, or should not, take part in EMU. Certainly, German
monetary officials have been insensitive, but with a particular problem
in mind. Most Germans are extremely wary of monetary union because they
fear that the strong mark will be replaced with a weaker shared
currency. Because of this Mr Tietmeyer and others have insisted that
failure to observe the agreed criteria for union would lead only to
instability, by which he means inflation. It would, furthermore, wreck
chances of further integration within Europe and might even lead to a
detached Germany pursuing its own interests. Germany's hard-line on this
issue has mystified some and annoyed others, notably the French who are
not particularly keen on union and whose economy is unlikely to satisfy
the criteria for union in time. This is compounded by Mr Chirac's own
doubts about a single currency on which he manages at best to be
ambivalent.  The Germans are correct to hold to the agreed criteria and
they are correct to worry that other nations might like to soften the
criteria to alter the timetable. If EMU is going to go soft it will be
unsaleable to German voters, and rightly so. The Germans are issuing a
timely warning. They are right to do so and we should pay attention,
whether offended or not.

THE biggest single exception to the laws against price fixing now
looks doomed. The Net Book Agreement, which forced booksellers to accept
the one agreed price for any title they sold, has probably ended with
yesterday's decision of more major publishers to abandon it completely.
The agreement covered four-fifths of all books published in the UK.
Fewer than six months ago it survived scrutiny by the House of Commons
Heritage Select Committee, but its near end comes after years of
constant campaigning by some large publishers and booksellers. Reed
Publishing left the agreement four years ago and Hodder Headline left
last year. Now Random House and HarperCollins have taken the same road,
and HarperCollins is the world's biggest publisher of English language
books. Other, smaller publishers, will almost inevitably follow suit for
the agreement could be maintained only by a consensus which has
unarguably disappeared. The face of book selling in Britain will be
changed, with most titles, certainly most popular titles, becoming
cheaper and selling more copies.
The change will be welcomed by the larger book sellers, like W H Smith
which with Waterstones, which it also controls, has around a quarter of
the country's total book sales. It will also be welcomed by the
supermarkets which have the ability to ''pile them high and sell them
cheap'' just as much in books as in baked beans. A spokesman for
Dillons, which has been campaigning against the agreement for some
years, insisted that the agreement was ''a disincentive to reading, and
kept prices artificially high''. Should everyone, therefore, cheer? It
must seem strange that such a restrictive practice was ever accepted
(and begun in an age of free trade) when its results seem so negative
that even apparent beneficiaries are now rushing to drop it. The fact
is, however, that ending the price restriction will have consequences
other than those noted by the withdrawing publishers and traders. The
diversity of outlets -- bookshops -- will reduce with smaller and
specialist shops coming under acute financial pressures from big
competitors and supermarkets, who can afford small margins on popular
books, since they will not even stock up for minority tastes. The same
process will apply to diminish the number of small and specialist
publishers whose output will have to command higher prices to the extent
that it is relatively small in scale as befits the smaller audience to
which it appeals.
Minority tastes include academic titles which of their nature are
produced for specialist readers and which are already not exactly cheap.
The price of such titles will rise. Established authors and best sellers
may flourish more, but it will be harder for new entrants to the book
market, first novels for example, to win a readership and so ''create
the taste by which they are enjoyed''. In a curious, and even
paradoxical, way this change which seems so radical will reinforce the
conservatism of the reading public and those who seek to serve it. It
will, probably, reduce choice quite markedly and reinforce the ability
of the largest outlets to impose their notions of what is ''proper'' on
their customers.
All of these arguments have been deployed before. They have failed to
command acceptance, and the agreement has been crumbling. There remains
the possibility that the whole book market will now expand, new authors
will be greeted with more enthusiasm (they may be more strongly
marketed), and demand for specialised titles will emerge unscathed from
the higher prices they may have to carry. But few who love books will be
reassured: it is not likely to be a change to their advantage.

CONTRARY to some suggestions in terms of the great exchanges of
political invective, Scottish politics is a very tame affair. Over the
Atlantic few punches have ever been pulled. In the early years of this
century Teddy Roosevelt felt that William McKinley's government had a
''chocolate eclair backbone'' and made sure that everybody else was
told.
Many decades later Gordon Liddy, attacking presidential counsel John
Dean who spilt the beans on Nixon, felt that the lawyer's action had
''put him right up there with Judas Iscariot''.
A few years back things were also a bit rougher in UK politics. In the
aftermath of the Second World War, Churchill tried in vain to label
Labour as the Gestapo while Bevan described the Tories as ''lower than
vermin''.
Invective has always flowed just as easily within parties as between
them although Dalton's description of Cabinet colleague Manny Shinwell
as a ''shit and a low cur'' was on the tough side of normal behaviour.
It was, however, slightly more printable than Bevan on George Brown.
By and large, Adlai Stevenson had it right in saying that ''when
political ammunition runs low inevitably the rusty artillery of abuse is
always wheeled into action''.
Certainly the abuse has been pretty rusty in Scotland over the past
few years. The SNP have been called ''racist'', ''xenophobic'', and
''sectarian'', by a number of otherwise quite normal human beings and I
have come to the obvious conclusion that the level of abuse is directly
related to electoral success.
It is not a case with Burns the the ''mair they talk the better I'm
kent'' but rather more that ''the better I'm kent the mair they talk''.
This was certainly true in the Perth and Kinross by-election where the
Tory candidate climaxed an entire campaign attempting to smear my
colleague Roseanna Cunningham by describing her as the face of ''ugly
nationalism'', a comment which the fair ''republican Rose'' laughed off
with her usual aplomb.
Insults and personal attacks are usually counter-productive unless
they are really witty or original, which lets out most of the exchanges
in Scottish politics of late. By and large it is good advice not to
employ them unless you totally want to obscure what you have to say.
That advice extends to all politicians in all parties including my own.
However, it is absurd to try and take the politics out of politics or,
even worse, to imply that exchanges between democratic politicans,
however heated, are somehow responsible for activities which go outside
the realms of democratic politics.
It is sticks and stones, not names, which break bones. Not only that,
of course, but there are much worse things than streams of invective let
loose, often to little effect.
One of these is what we can style the Mandelson school of political
smears so evident in Labour's recent by-election campaigns and in the
bizarre behaviour of George Robertson over the past week.
To attempt an upstage of the SNP conference is par for Labour's course
these days, but to do so by means of a planted memo speaks volumes for
Robertson's motivation. He seems less concerned with the health of the
Scottish body politic than the robust electoral performance of the SNP.
However, it is Labour's end to the week which should give us most
cause for thought. For some years yours truly and, I suspect every
significant person in Scottish public life, have been on the receiving
end of a variety of threats from nutters, cranks, and a range of other
inadequates who get a cheap thrill out of causing a stir.
The response is always the same. Contact the police and take their
advice. Thus, for example, when Tayside Police informed us of two bomb
hoaxes at our conference last week we followed normal procedure and
proceeded with our democratic business.
We did not hold a press conference or suggest that anyone from the
''darker side'' of Labourism had been stirred into action by George
Robertson's targeting of the SNP conference although the threats had to
be taken more seriously in the heightened atmosphere that was a direct
result of George's foolish behaviour.
Not so the Labour Party. A hoax device is found at Labour HQ on
Saturday. Their first act is to summon the press who are in attendance,
not just in time for the bomb squad's arrival, but for the Sunday
newspaper deadlines.
It does not take the biggest cynic in the world to suspect that
something is rotten in the state of Labour politics in Scotland.
Six months ago, George Robertson was beaten fair and square in a
democratic debate on independence versus devolution. Since then the
kindest thing that can be said of his behaviour with regard to the SNP
is that it has become somewhat erratic.
Perhaps the whole thing is preying on his mind. What is not acceptable
is to drag all of Scottish politics through the mire just because he
wants to fling some mud at the SNP.
The way in which Scotland conducts itself is of great importance over
the next few years. We are among the few nations who have managed
through civic process to explore the most fundamental national debate of
all without recourse to violence.
In the period of democratic politics not a single person has ever died
as a result of the pursuit of Scottish independence. That is a prize
worth keeping.
Perhaps George Robertson should take Howard Greely's advice to young
America -- ''grow up with your country''.

Fiftieth anniversary is no reason for celebration, declares Defence
Correspondent Ian Bruce
Adrift and impotent in the new age of insecurity
TWO weeks of speeches will hint at it gently. But nobody among the
hundreds of world politicians due to speak in this fiftieth anniversary
year will say it directly: the United Nations is no longer the fit and
proper guardian of global peace.
In its current form, the organisation is adrift and impotent in the
new age of insecurity. Somalia, Lebanon, and Bosnia have destroyed its
credibility and exposed its glaring weaknesses of command, control, and
response to crisis.
Most of the 185 member states are long on rhetoric and short on
meeting their financial and physical dues. It explains why the UN is
usually a day late and more than a dollar short when it comes to
tackling obligations in an effective manner.
Its biggest debtor at $1600m, the United States, has also been,
ironically, its public salvation until now. It was the US that was the
driving force behind allied deployment to the Gulf in 1991. It was US
resolve that began the process of bombing the Serbs to the negotiating
table in Bosnia five weeks ago after three years of failed diplomacy and
200,000 unnecessary dead.
The UN hierarchy, isolated in its smoked-glass tower in downtown New
York, could never muster the resolve to issue an unambiguous order
authorising direct military action. Everything was negotiable and long
range. It was also fudged and riddled with get-outs for the aggressor.
General Lewis Mackenzie, the former UN commander in Bosnia, once
phoned New York from his Sarajevo bunker to seek emergency approval for
possible air action to deter Serb shelling. When he cleared the main
switchboard and was put through to the UN's ''military command centre'',
he stated his name and was asked who he was and why he was calling.
He had been in the former Yugoslavia for six months by then, and was
the man in charge of the organisation's most pressing and publicised
foreign operation. When his personal frustration subsided, he hung up
and reflected with a sinking sensation that the mission was doomed
unless something drastic happened fast to change the command structure.
Until three years ago, the military centre was manned purely on office
hours, Eastern Standard Time, despite the fact that more than 80,000
troops in blue helmets were risking life and limb worldwide, usually in
poorly-armed penny packets.
Living outnumbered and outgunned in Indian territory may have had a
certain romantic appeal to the bureaucracy. On the ground it meant
constant danger. Hundreds were killed or maimed to no great effect. The
UN became everyone's Aunt Sally. Blue helmets may as well have sported
bullseyes.
The command centre is now manned round the clock and staffed by people
who at least know the names and locations of their key players. But the
move will be little consolation for three million displaced Croats,
Muslims, and Serbs and their dead relatives.
Britain's new Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, appealed yesterday
for reform of the UN and urged member states to strive for ''early
preventative action'' to stop crises in their tracks.
But his supposed ''keynote'' speech was typical of the many that will
be delivered over the period of anniversary celebration. It stops
woefully short of what should be said. The UN does not require reform.
It needs total overhaul, the slashing of red tape, an end to the
pussyfooting of political correctness, and a recognition of the fact
that it cannot cope with fast-moving military situations without
sub-contracting the work to Nato.
Its members must also pay up or shut up. The many genuine and
effective facets of the organisation in the fields of health and
provision of emergency relief are hamstrung for lack of funds. If the
defaulters were members of a club, they would be expelled and excluded
from help themselves.
In total, the organisation is more than $1800m in the red. And while
many of its Third World diplomats live in privileged luxury in the Big
Apple, their less fortunate brethren back home are dying of starvation,
disease, and oppression. Nigeria is a prime example. It is not alone.
India, Iran, China, and the majority of the Arab nations are less than
shining examples of civil rights.
To some extent, the UN is also an organisation dominated in key
decision-making by the nuclear club of the Security Council. Yet Russia,
one of the founding five of that council, is screaming to know why it
was not consulted before bombing strikes in Bosnia. Germany and Japan
are quietly asking why, as major economic powers, they are excluded from
the top table.
Both are good questions. Recent UN-mandated operations have seemed
like extensions of American foreign policy. And while that is not to say
they have not been effective, it does not make the process inherently
right or just. More importantly, the UN cannot always depend on US
firepower to break the diplomatic deadlock if the application of force
conflicts with Washington's own foreign policy goals.
Britain itself is only in a prime position because it possesses
nuclear weapons. Its other saving grace is that it generally pays its
bills and is currently the single biggeat provider of peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia, with more than 8000 men on the ground and in the line
of fire.
There is a growing argument for the inclusion of the non-nuclear
powers such as Germany, Japan, and perhaps Brazil to reflect the shifts
in economic reality and apply a brake to any single nation dictating
policy.
Unless conflicts have spiralled completely out of control, and call
for a drastic military solution, the most effective weapon available
remains economic sanctions. Applied in time, these can deter aggression,
ensure non-involvement, and save lives. Who better to have a casting
vote than the nations with the ultimate economic clout?
The sad fact is that the UN, while helping to save millions of lives
in drought and famine-stricken regions, is not geared to its new role of
peacemaker. Peacekeeping is a failed dream. And until the UN can project
sufficient dedicated military strength to trouble spots, it will have to
defer to and depend upon sub-contractors such as Nato.

The managing director of InterCity East Coast yesterday signalled his
intentions for a management-employee buy out. Iain Wilson talked to him
about about his vision for the future
BRIAN Burdsall, the man most likely to head a privatised InterCity
East Coast, spoke yesterday of his vision to make the flagship
cross-border line the finest travel experience in Britain.
He promised to keep running more trains than required under the
Passenger Service Requirement set by the Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising, and to introduce ''material improvements'' across the
network.
But he ruled out investment in line electrification north of Edinburgh
by a privatised InterCity East Coast -- and denied that, in any way,
suggests Aberdeen or Inverness rail links are at risk.
The new operator was also unlikely to start a fares war with the West
Coast main line, remaining in State hands this side of a General
Election.
Opraf, the Government-appointed body responsible for awarding
franchises, yesterday invited tenders for running services over the
high-speed Scotland-London King's Cross route.
Burdsall, managing director of InterCity East Coast, immediately
announced he will lead a management-employee bid.
The line -- with income expected to soar from #217m to #240m this year
-- is widely regarded as one of the richest pickings available under the
controversial privatisation programme.
Burdsall's vehicle for the bid is Wenfordbray Ltd, which the
management team had to buy off-the-shelf -- because BR has again been
denied the opportunity to tender, despite an all-party Commons committee
recommending it should always have the opportunity to do so.
Sunderland-born Burdsall, 48, has worked in the railways since
graduating 26 years ago with a BA (Hons) from Keele University. He's
big, brash, exudes confidence, and has boundless positive energy for the
task ahead.
He is also desperate for support for the buy out among his 2900 staff,
including 660 in Scotland. Throughout our interview, he stressed a
desire for a partnership with employees and others, but it was already
clear that support will be far from overwhelming.
In Scotland, for example, the rail union RMT remained of the view that
managers were ''living in Cloud-cuckoo-land'' if they thought members
want railways in private hands.
And Labour's Scottish transport spokesman said the sale should be
scrapped to guarantee that such a vital main spur into Scotland will
remain in expert hands. Mr Henry McLeish said the line could go, in a
free-for-all, to a bus firm or other company without railways
experience. He added that the sale was a panic measure by a Government
desperate to save face after the fiasco in which the West Coast main
line sale was postponed indefinitely.
However, with 18 months of detailed planning already under his belt,
Burdsall believes that InterCity East Coast will be in the private
sector by March at the earliest or June at the latest.
Industry observers suspect it could be a year, or even more, before
privatisation becomes reality. Whatever the timetable -- and stiff
outside competition that he will face for the franchise -- Burdsall's
vision of the future East Coast cannot be ignored.
He was well aware that InterCity East Coast could easily turn out to
be the only privatised train operator of four that is running in
Scotland by the next General Election, due in the spring of 1997.
It would appear Burdsall suspects that a Labour Government would find
it very difficult to renationalise the company if its customers had
given the new operators a warm reception.
Significantly, he believes there will be no need to engage in a fares
war with the West Coast main line, arguing the degree of competition is
''actually not that great'' -- involving only the East Coast's direct
services out of Glasgow Central.
But he was adamant an East Coast train operator in the private sector
would beat a West Coast operator in the public sector if it ever came
down to a battle for customers.
Conversely, he suggested there is room for deals with ScotRail, which
has taken over responsibility for West Coast sleeper services.
He said: ''In many ways, our trains and the ScotRail sleepers are
complementary . . . a very large proportion of the market going one way
by sleeper then travelling the other way by East Coast. We probably have
more to lose by not having that relationship than by trying to spoil
it.''
Burdsall declined to dwell on questions arising from the possibility
that a Labour Government would approve a much-needed multi-million pound
West Coast upgrading.
The fastest West Coast journey time from Glasgow to London Euston is
four hours, 59 minutes -- compared with four hours, 10 minutes on the
East Coast from Edinburgh to King's Cross.
Indeed, with typical West Coast times of five hours, 15 minutes, it is
already possible to travel direct by InterCity East Coast from Glasgow,
via Edinburgh, and still arrive in London faster.
Burdsall was adamant the current schedule of 19 trains running south
and 17 running north each weekday will continue, regardless of a PSR
that says only 13 each way need run, because expansion, not retraction,
was the key to a successful railway.
As for electrification north of Edinburgh, he said: ''One of the
ironies of rail privatisation is that the Government, for the first
time, has underwritten things in a Passenger Service Requirement -- but
has still got it in the neck because in some places the PSR is not 100%
or more of what is at present operated.
''In the case of Aberdeen and Inverness, the main trains we operate
are included in the PSR, and that clearly provides a security of service
over the franchise period.
''If anyone can tell me what the benefits of electrification are over
and above that security, I would be interested to know.''
He added that InterCity East Coast could not justify electrification
costs based on one Inverness train and three Aberdeen trains each way
daily, and went on: ''I believe the real worry is that people assume you
will eventually not want to run trains north because they are not 'under
the wires'. But having the trains included in the PSR, which must be run
in exchange for financial support, lifts that worry.''
Burdsall later conceded that many staff were frightened about the
future, and that some were opposed to privatisation.
In a plea for employee support, he described the staff who run
InterCity East Coast as the best people to do so in future; they had
made the service among the safest and most efficient in Europe, and
''nobody new to this business could take it forward as well as them''.
He could, however, provide no assurances about job security on
privatisation: ''It would be foolish to guarantee anything, except that
you have got to be flexible to what the market needs.
''I think it is difficult to be categorical about jobs because they
are in various different activities and who knows which of these
activities will go forward.
''I think, inevitably, we will be looking towards the workforce being
responsive to what the customer wants. What I keep saying to staff is,
if they collectively deliver that, they have no reason to fear for the
future . . .''
Burdsall is positive the management buy-out team will win. His vision
is to grow the business, and make it ''the primary travel experience in
Europe''.
The bidders intend not just to run trains but to take on-board
services to a new level. They believe meeting the needs of individual
customers is the key to success. The company also aims to offer better
value for money, rather than cut fares.
The multi-faceted fares' structure will be simplified, and tailored to
niche markets, including tourists. It is believed there is huge scope
for increasing the 30,000-a-day passenger total.
Partnerships with a number of leading companies in retailing,
property, and restaurants are also expected to boost revenue prospects,
according to Burdsall. He estimates business could rise to #280m.

Young pupils face the challenge of doing it their own way and, as Mary
Brennan discovers, learn how to express their feelings through creative
participation
PERFORMING in front of others can prove a seriously intense business.
Just how intense was brought home to me, rather movingly, in a school
hall in Grangemouth last week.
Various urgent bodies were grouping themselves in fairly complicated
patterns while, at the back of the space, dozens more were percussing
furiously on everything from tambourines to what sounded like sandpaper
blocks. The sequence was coming to an end when . . . one word -- ''GO!''
It just cannoned out of her in the heat of the moment. Worried that her
chum had forgotten the next move, this wee girl, aged about 11, had
exploded like a starting pistol.
Together they ran -- slightly pink, but definitely not giving way to
incipient giggles -- to join others in building the next formation.
Everything about them, from the eager feet to the slightly glazed
expression of inner concentration, told you how thoroughly involved they
were. It was one of those shiny moments when you catch the flesh and
blood value behind paper statements of policy intent.
I'd gone along to Grangemouth High School for the last day of Reaching
Out, a dance project led by Rambert Dance Company's education and
community unit. Over a mere three weeks the team -- company animateur
Angela Walton, composer Ian Willcock, and Education Manager Alison Whyte
-- had worked with four different schools on music and movement, held
in-service training workshops for teachers, and were rounding things off
with an informal showing of the piece that had developed out of their
sessions in the schools.
In all, a hectic schedule with the added challenge of working with a
large contingent of younger pupils. The Rambert team usually deal more
with secondary school groups; here three of their four participating
schools were primaries -- Beancross, Bantaskin, and Easter Carmuirs, all
from the Falkirk / Grangemouth area of Central Region and all fairly new
to dance-making at this level.
''In the end it was quite a useful challenge for us,'' says Alison
Whyte with a grin. ''We had to find different ways into the work for the
different age groups. With older groups, such as the girls from
Grangemouth High, you can teach them a piece out of repertoire and then
have them work on it, changing it, introducing their own ideas. But
that's not going to work so well for younger groups. So you have to find
another stimulus that will give you the same result -- a piece of dance
that they have made themselves.''
This encouraging of creative participation lies at the heart of every
project. First of all they choose a piece from Rambert's current
repertoire -- part of their remit, after all, is to encourage an
interest in dance that will include watching professional performances.
For this particular project they settled on a comparatively recent
addition, Per Jonsson's Jupiter Is Crying -- seen at the King's in
Glasgow last night as part of the Rambert programme.
It is an abstract piece generated by a range of powerful emotions and
set to a thunderingly percussive soundscore. ''Narrative is such a
regular part of school work that we felt something abstract would be a
good departure from the norm,'' explained Angela Walton, the moving
force behind the dance-making.
''With the younger ones, we started them off talking about things they
loved, things they hated, their fears and their fantasies -- emotions
that relate to Johnsson's work. He has told us himself that, when he was
choreographing the piece, he had concentrated on feelings that 'moved
him to move'. So we got our primary school groups to do the same thing.
They came up with movements that expressed their emotions.''
Meanwhile, composer Ian Willcock was sounding out the musical
experience of the 70 or so primary children taking part. Again, the aim
is to relate what they do to the existing piece in the company's
repertoire. ''It's not just a case of trying to reproduce it,'' says
Willcock. ''There wouldn't be much point in that anyway, because the
dance is going to be different. What you're trying to do is explore the
structures, the strategies, used in the original composition so that you
can then have people play around with them, try to combine them in their
own ways.''
The really astounding aspect of all this is the sophisticated result
achieved in such a short time. At most, the team spent three days with
each school -- and sometimes not even that, splitting the time for the
group between music and dance-making. The outcome, when all four schools
came together in performance, looked as if 10 times that number of hours
-- at least -- had gone into evolving the movements and phrasing, and
into devising the score.
Gayle Donnelly, a dark haired 16-year-old at Grangemouth High, took
part in the first Rambert residency, hosted by Central Region last
October to coincide with the company's relaunch at the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre. This one, she reckoned, was every bit as good, if not
better. ''It's great when you're all working together, doing these moves
and you don't know -- well you've got to think about it -- and it just
starts to come together. It's really great. I'd love to do it again next
year if they have it. And I'd say to anybody who hasn't tried it --
you've really missed out.'' Gayle, and others from the project, were in
the audience at the King's, . watching Jupiter Is Crying, knowing they
have a particular, personal connection with the piece. Yet again the
Rambert Education team has brought the aims and objectives of Reaching
Out to life.
* Rambert Dance Company presents two different programmes at the
King's in Glasgow this week. Programme One is on tonight, Programme Two
opens tomorrow and runs until Saturday.

A READER writes to me from Arisaig, with reference to my column about
Salman Rushdie the other week, agreeing that he is not a holy innocent,
and asking whether he is a typical example of immigrant psychology.
For one reason and another, he feels dissatisfied with the place where
he was born. So he comes over here, but still fails to find the
satisfaction he seeks. Instead he makes trouble. ''One wonders if
settlers are by nature people who are never satisfied with anything,''
my correspondent says.
This may be true, but I am not sure we should regard a tendency to
dissatisfaction, or even an urge to travel about with it, as negative
qualities. Whole societies, in fact all European societies outside
Europe, have been built by people not content with their lot. Since they
decided to do something about it, the societies they founded are more
dynamic and optimistic, more open-minded and generous, than the
societies they left behind.
Prominent among those generations of migrants to new worlds were the
Scots.
Scots girn a lot, and many are happy to girn away while staying put
and taking it out on their brother Scots. But some do decide to do
something about it, and their impact on the rest of the globe has been
immense.
Their impact has not always been beneficial, though. During the second
quarter of the nineteenth century, William Jardine and Alexander
Matheson were the equivalent of today's drug barons in Colombia,
smuggling opium into China. But no curse, like no blessing is unmixed.
They ended up prompting the foundation of the Crown colony of Hong
Kong, where their firm, Jardine Matheson, remains a commercial force to
this day.
In the process, they also prised open the closed Empire of China, and
so allowed its people to become another of the great emigrant races. The
Chinese may not overall show the same propensity to emigrate as Scots,
but there are many more of them, so they easily make their presence
felt. Singapore is one largely Chinese city outside China. Vancouver may
soon be another. Perhaps the same future awaits San Francisco or Sydney.
Should anyone worry? The countries at the receiving end of these waves
of emigration do not seem to. They can see that the Chinese are frugal,
industrious, and law-abiding. They therefore make wonderful capitalists.
And if we believe in capitalism, we should surely accept that the
mobility of labour is as good for the system as the mobility of capital.
The people should go, as the money should go, where they can be put to
most productive use.
One would have thought this a principle to which the British might
feel able to subscribe. But in general only horror has greeted the
suggestion by the Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, that those of his
subjects who do not want to live under the communist tyranny lying in
wait for them from 1997 should have the right to come here.
True, there are three million of them, which is rather a lot. But
these things are relative. It is not as if the three million are idle
and useless. On the contrary, they have made a barren island in the
South China Sea into one of the world's most high-powered economies.
Three million capitalists capable of doing that should be an asset to
any other country calling itself capitalist.
A modest proposal occurs to me. We could let them come and, at little
or no cost to ourselves, set them up in conditions replicating as nearly
as possible those out of which Hong Kong has flourished. We could just
give some fairly useless lump of moor and mountain in the Highlands --
say Knoydart, where my reader from Arisaig might keep a distant eye on
them. They could, of course, receive no subsidies at all.
To make it as much as possible like Hong Kong, Knoydart should be
surrounded by barbed wire and searchlights. At first they might serve to
keep the locals out, and stop spoiling the whole experiment with their
girning and subsidy-seeking. By that time, I bet the peninsula would be
covered in skyscrapers, housing great financial and manufacturing
enterprises, with ships from all quarters of the globe sailing up Loch
Nevis.
Chance would be a fine thing, but a little fable like this might help
to point a contrast with the political and economic culture that we
actually have. It is a corporatist culture, resting on the assumption
that individuals cannot help themselves, but have to be helped by an
all-pervading official apparatus. We may have constitutional reform in
the next few years, but there is nothing on the table that might cause
corporatism's palsied grip to slacken.
No wonder, then, that so many enterprising Scots continue to go
somewhere else. No wonder, either, that they only give grounds for
further girning by those who have not the gumption to get up and go with
them. Nationalists bemoan the fact that young Scots seek their first
jobs abroad, as if that was not what they always have been doing.
In any case, some come back when they have made their pile. Even if
others leave for good, they often smooth the path for future waves of
Scotsmen on the make. By their collective contribution, they have
certainly helped to create the positive image which, we may reasonably
say, Scotland enjoys in the world.
We might even say that Scots are at their best when they are most like
the Chinese, and defy the prevailing mentality which would keep both in
their place.

IT is no real surprise that the Net Book Agreement is on its last
legs. Modern publishing, at least as understood in London, has been
transformed in the past decade from the preserve of more-or-less
amateurish gentlemen to an item in the portfolios of conglomerates whose
devotion to books rarely extends beyond the pages in which accountants
compose their masterpieces.
The NBA is of another age.
Rupert Murdoch illustrates the point. HarperCollins, his publishing
house, will, for example, buy up the memoirs of a Thatcher, a Newt
Gingrich, or a Colin Powell. Extracts from these will then be printed in
his Sunday Times, spinning off news stories, television documentaries,
and sales for both the book and the newspaper. In the trade they call it
synergy; others have different names.
It has very little to do with art, of course. Murdoch is not greatly
noted for his interest in culture of any sort, unless you count the
patronage that accrues to the publisher of politicians' maunderings as
culture. In his universe books are just one strand in a sticky web
stretching from newspapers, to magazines, to film studios, television
stations and on-line services. Books are software, packaged product to
be shifted by whatever means are necessary, and nothing more.
All that being so, yesterday's announcement from HarperCollins that it
(along with Random House) intends to abandon the NBA was predictable.
The tycoon who inflicted a price war on the newspaper industry with the
hope of driving rivals out of business was not likely to abide forever
by an agreement designed to ensure that the widest range of books is
available. As he has shown with newspapers, Murdoch's ideal is a market
in which the consumer can have any product he likes -- as long as it's a
Murdoch product.
In this, he enjoys the tacit support of other big players.
Supermarkets, with their enormous purchasing power, have been eyeing
the book trade for some time. Asda stocks the cut-price products of
Hodder Headline, a company that has already quit the NBA, and others are
eager to follow in finding a place for books between the beans and
burgers. The consequences of all this have been widely rehearsed, of
course.
Given the experience of countries such as France, we can expect a
narrowing in the range of books published and the widespread closure of
small book shops.
Publishers, too, will suffer. Already the trade is squeezed by big
chains who think the standard 33% discount inadequate, and who feel
insulted if a humble publishing house asks that accounts be settled in
anything less than 60 days. When supermarkets, who really know how to
keep suppliers in their place, enter the equation the future for first
novels and serious works of history, biography or politics will begin to
look bleak indeed.
What product managers keen to avoid offence will make of a James
Kelman or an Irvine Welsh doesn't bear thinking about.
But there is another aspect to all this. Scotland's cultural renewal
in recent years, such as it has been, has depended to a greater extent
on writers than most people have realised. Booker Prizes
notwithstanding, Scotland's authors, discovered and nurtured by small
Scottish publishers, have done more than most to enhance and preserve
the country's identity. What happens to them now? It is possible to
guess just how much thought has been given to the question by the clever
people at HarperCollins. Stacking them high and selling them cheap,
spouting the claptrap of ''consumer power'' while ensuring that consumer
choice is reduced steadily, they neither know nor care how the books
they sell are created. And besides, what profit is there in national
identity for a multi-national? It is a contradiction in terms.
Nevertheless, a nation's literature is its collective biography,
perhaps the most precious thing it has. In Scotland it has been under
pressure -- political, linguistic, economic -- for centuries. That
literary culture still exists at all as a recognisably distinct entity
is a small miracle, and one attributable to the small publishing houses
that have survived, despite all the odds, until now.
But the destruction of the NBA means the odds have been altered,
probably for good. Small book shops will find life impossible.
Publishers will no longer be able to subsidise anything of minority
interest. Educational texts will become rare and expensive things. And
all for the right -- is it not wonderful? -- to save a pound on the
polystyrene prose of Miss Jackie Collins.

IF it's autumn it must be time for chestnuts and I smell an old one
being roasted -- the hoary view that female violence is on the rise.
It's a theory which the media persists in, backed by the scantiest of
statistics and the occasional sensational case, one which seems to be
dusted down every time there's a glimpse of a gun-toting female on the
horizon, or rather on celluloid.
Sharon Stone has only to whip out an ice-pick or a pistol and suddenly
newsprint philosophers start panicking about manifestations of
aggression among women. Liz Hurley has only to have a run in with some
nasty teens to set off warning bells about packs of girl gangs
terrorising the country.
The hype has just been tweaked up again by a report, Freedom's
Children: Work, Relationships and Politics for 18-34-year olds in
Britain Today, published yesterday by the think-tank Demos, who claim to
have ''discovered a remarkable attachment to violence among younger
women''. The report's statement that ''we are already hearing of growing
numbers of girl gangs and criminals'' is hardly surprising. Sure, we're
all hearing that. We're hearing it from newspapers, magazines,
television, and radio. But are we seeing it?
Demos think so, presenting the rather hysterical-sounding claim that
Britain is facing an epidemic of female violence. Really? Is Britain
about to be invaded by mobs of angry girls, rampaging through our towns
swearing and shouting? As thousands of boozed-up men habitually do on
Saturdays during the football season? Somehow, I doubt it.
The report's over-the-top conclusion of an epidemic is informed by
statistics which show that in the past 10 years the number of women
charged with violent incidents has almost doubled from 5499 to 9397.
Certainly that's a troubling trend but it hardly signals an epidemic,
particularly when put into perspective and compared with the average
annual number of men charged with violent offences -- 50,000. It's also
a figure which probably reflects societal response to female violence as
much as the violence itself; a man attacked by a woman today is almost
certainly more likely to report that crime to the police than he would
have 10 years ago.
The high level of attention focused on female violent crime is partly
a prurient one -- the vicious femme fatale makes for sexier copy than
her male thug counterpart -- but it is almost certainly also an
insidious example of a reactionary response to feminism, a reaction
which was analysed in the early nineties by American feminist Susan
Feludi in her incisive tome Backlash. ''What has made women unhappy in
the past decade is not their equality but the rising pressure to halt
and even reverse women's quest for that equality,'' she wrote.
The reporting of surveys like that undertaken by Demos looks like part
of that backlash -- Sunday's Observer story on it carried the patronisng
headline ''Gentle sex indulges in thrill-seeking violence'', the
anachronistic synonym for women reinforcing the sense of shock. Demos's
point that woman have become more ''masculined'' equates increased
assertiveness over the past 10 years with increased female crime; the
implication is clearly that increased assertiveness is a bad thing.
Demos claim that their researchers found that 13% of women aged 18 to
24 thought it was acceptable to use violence to get what they want. The
actual crime statistics show that that must be a case of all mouth and
no action, as 13% of women are quite clearly not physically perpetrating
violence to get what they want.
In 1916 the psychologists Lombroso and Ferrero, describing female
criminals, deduced ''We have seen that a normal woman is naturally less
sensitive to pain than a man. We also saw that women have many traits in
common with children; that their moral sense is deficient; that they are
revengeful, jealous, inclined to vengeances of a refined cruelty. In
ordinary cases, these defects are neutralised by poetry, maternity, want
of passion, sexual coldness, by weakness, and an underdeveloped
intelligence. When a morbid activity of the physical centres intensifies
the bad qualities of women and induces them to seek relief in evil
deeds, the normal woman must be transformed into a born criminal more
terrible than any man.'' Ooh, err.
Undoubtedly then, as now, myths about the Amazons haunted the male
psyche.  The legendary female warriors used to break an arm or a leg of
the men they captured in battle, believing that the fellas would
compensate for the loss in the limb department with gains in the groin
department, acquitting themselves better between the sheets -- ''the
lame best perform the act of love'' remarked Queen Antanaria. No wonder
men across the country were freaked by Kathy Bates' performance in
Misery; they must have feared the movie would revive an ancient custom.
In Sexual Personae, the tough-talking American academic Camille Paglia
reckons that as society becomes more technologised, women, who
throughout mythology are identified with nature, are increasingly
demonised. ''The more nature is beaten back in the west, the more the
femme fatale appears, as a return of the repressed. She is the spectre
of the west's bad conscience about nature. She is the moral ambiguity of
nature, a malevolent moon that keeps breaking through our fog of hopeful
sentiment.'' The sentiment no doubt relating to stereotypical
assumptions about the so-called ''Gentle Sex''.
The fact is that the Nancy Kerrigans of this world are few and far
between; it's just that the fear of them is disproportionally intense.
Confronted by female violence men invariably feel emasculated, from the
Amazon's captives to EastEnder's Mark Fowler, recently miffed that his
wife Ruth scared off the thugs who had been harassing her spouse with a
niftily aimed karate kick.
But while self-defence classes might make women more prepared
physically to defend themselves from attack the majority of us are not
about to stomp around town, stamping on faces. Chill out; no thrill from
scratching someone'e eyes out could possibly compensate for spoiling a
good manicure. Cries of epidemic are undoubtedly a false alarm; the
battle of the sexes is sure to remain a war of words.

THE siege by members of Her Majesty's Press Corps continued yesterday
at the home of Brian MacKinnon, the now famous 32-year-old Bearsden
schoolboy. The tenacity of the media in this respect is matched only by
their ingenuity in trying to persuade Mr MacKinnon and/or his mother May
to tell their story.
A combination of the Scottish newspaper wars and ''Brandon Lee's
second schooldays'' being the only story in town led to the MacKinnons
receiving a daily barrage of letters and notes from journalists whose
only concern was to get the true facts across.
Mr MacKinnon has passed on to the Herald Diary the entire dossier of
written offers. We stress that no cash payment was requested or made for
this information but if he ever wants to go for a half-pint of something
some day, we could find it in the Diary budget.
The most direct and blunt approach came from the Daily Record who
wrote to Mr MacKinnon that they would be ''prepared to pay #20,000 for
full interview and background with you on your experiences and life''. A
previous approach to Mrs MacKinnon from a Record reporter had this more
eloquent message on the back of a visiting card: ''No newspaper tricks,
no offers of money, or paradise hols to Hawaii. Just the plain and
simple, straight-talking truth, so by the weekend this story will only
be used to wrap fish and chips and you can get on with your life in
peace.''
The Sunday Post tried a couthy approach with this letter from a lady
called Barbara Bruce: ''I know you've had a difficult week and the way
the press has been pestering you must have made things worse. As a
mother myself I think I can understand a little of what you've been
going through.''
The local newspaper the Milngavie &amp; Bersden Herald were equally
concerned in their letter to Mrs MacKinnon: ''I hope you are feeling
better and managed to get a good night's sleep. Things always look worse
than they really are.
''I am thinking of you and if you want any help on how to handle this
situation, please give me a call.''
The Daily Mirror, a journal well known for its sensitive exploration
of how we live our lives, wrote: ''Dear Brandon, Your unprecedented and
unusually spirited and original approach to life has caught the
imagination of generations who dream of a return to past vistas of
dreams and aspirations unfulfilled or missed.
''There is very little actual concrete condemnation of your amazing
life-experiment. Yet there is enormous appetite to learn of the
empirical results you have discovered by effectively living a life over
twice.'' The Mirror offered to ''match five-figure sums'' to explore
this whole concept through Brandon's eyes.
The Sun, as you might expect, were much more direct. A calling card
was popped through the door with this message on the back: ''Dear Mrs
MacKinnon, Please give me a call about Brian. It will be worth his
while.''
When this approach did not work, a more thoughtful letter arrived from
the Sun: ''In order to ease the intolerable pressure you are under --
which no-one wants -- I would ask you to reconsider our offer of #10,000
to speak to Brian . . . I can promise if you speak to me and tell me
your side of the story you'll be left in peace. After all, Brian hasn't
done anything illegal -- in fact, a lot of us have an admiration for
what he achieved . . .
''PS -- I am blonde woman outside in red car. If you want to speak --
and it won't take long -- flash the living room off and and on twice and
I'll come up.''
The man from the Press Association news agency wrote: ''Have a word
with me and the press pack will go home. PA News can put out any
statement from you to all press and radio. I'm the care-worn reporter in
sandals and blue coat.''
Many of the notes were scribbled on pages torn out of a reporter's
notebook. Gordon Hay, head of bureau of Scotland Today, showed a sense
of humour by appending this postscript to one of his messages: ''Sorry
for the quality of paper used for this missive. I had to borrow from a
friend's son and you know what the cutbacks in education have led to . .
.''
It was not only the Scottish media which beat a path to the
MacKinnons' door. A BBC Scotland journalist dropped off a letter from no
less distinctive a voice than Sir David Frost, inviting Brian MacKinnon
to appear on his Breakfast with Frost programme.
This Morning, the ITV chat programme, wrote to offer the opportunity
''to put the record straight'' in an interview with Judy Finnigan and
Richard Madeley, themselves no strangers to the unwelcome attentions of
the tabloid press.
Bella magazine offered ''a substantial fee'' for Brian MacKinnon's
story and added: ''We're a very well-respected women's magazine and
would, in no way, treat the story in a sensational manner . . . I'm
enclosing our current issue so you can see the sensitive way we treat
issues.'' The heading at the top of the front page read: ''The
bridegroom's a cheat -- he slept with the bridesmaid!''
The Daily Record eventually upped its offer to #25,000. The Scottish
Daily Express, in a letter to ''Mr Lee/MacKinnon'', said they would beat
any cash offer for the story.
The Herald communication which received a response from Brian
MacKinnon was a simple note offering no money but containing copies of
our coverage which we claimed ''has been less sensational and more
factual than any other paper''. Mr MacKinnon telephoned to invite The
Herald  to come to his house.
And could our reporters stop at a Chinese takeaway and buy some sweet
and sour prawns and fried rice, he asked. He and his mother had been
unable to get out of the house.
The takeaway was duly delivered. Brian MacKinnon insisted on paying
for it.

Frost, Sunday Post, Sunday Mail and all the other media whose notes,
letters, and imprecations made the above article possible.

Patrick Brogan on how a billionaire and his Independence party could
pave the way for another Clinton win
Texan is a capricious and exacting taskmaster
ALL of a sudden, things don't look too bright for the Republican
Party. Ross Perot is running again. With his usual flair for the
dramatic, the diminutive billionaire broke the news on Larry King Live,
the CNN call-in show on which he made his major announcements during the
1992 campaign.
He is launching the Independence Party to contest next year's
election, and although he declined to offer himself as the candidate,
there is not much doubt over who will be chosen.
Just last week, Perot was on stage with Newt Gingrich, praising the
Republicans, damning the Democrats, asserting that balancing the budget
was essential, that the Republicans' Contract With America was a major
document in the history of the Republic, and clearly suggesting he would
support whoever the Republicans might choose next year.
Now he has pulled the rug out from under their feet. Gingrich must be
furious, Bob Dole in despair. All the polls have shown President Bill
Clinton winning if there is a three-way race again.
Perot did suggest that he would be delighted if General Colin Powell
agreed to be the candidate, but there is not much chance that the
general will agree. If Perot launches a political party, it will be his
party, he will be in charge -- and the past three years have shown that
Perot is an exacting and capricious taskmaster.
Powell might run in the Republican primaries, if only to establish
himself as the obvious nominee for Vice-President: SenatorDole is 73
and, if elected, might settle for one term. His vice-president would be
the favourite for the nomination in 2000.
If Clinton were sufficiently desperate and brutal to dump his
vice-president, Al Gore, the general could be the Democrats'
vice-presidential candidate, and that certainly sounds like a winning
combination. Clinton cannot run in 2000, so the general would, once
again, be favourite -- as a Democrat. But if Perot is running, Clinton
would not have to consider such treachery.
A further reason to assume that Perot will be the Independent Party's
candidate is that otherwise all his billions will be of little use: he
will be limited to the flat $2000 contribution that any American can
make.
He said last night that the new party would be financed by small
contributions by the general public. He sounded ever-so populist -- but
that's the law. He can't sign a cheque for $50m for someone else's
campaign.
He had to launch the party now because a third party needs to comply
with Californian law, and that means accumulating 89,007 members by
October 24. A full-scale advertising campaign is being launched there
immediately to get that number of signatures.
Two other states, Ohio and Maine, have early deadlines for the
creation of third parties, and no doubt the Independentistas will be
busy there, too. But California is essential. It is the largest state by
far: Clinton is president today because he carried it.
Perot ran as an independent in 1992 and won almost 19% of the vote. It
is not absolutely clear that his intervention defeated President George
Bush, but all the evidence suggests that his supporters were much more
inclined to the Republicans than to the Democrats.
The question mark over the voting intentions of those 19% last time is
that they were all most certainly bitterly disappointed with Bush. They
believed the propaganda that he had put up taxes more than anyone else
in history (utterly untrue) after promising ''Read my lips, no new
taxes!'' (quite true). What is more, he appeared amazingly divorced from
the realities of contemporary America.
There are an awful lot of disaffected Americans out there. In 1992,
they voted for Ross Perot. Now they are looking for another candidate:
it is quite clear that neither Clinton nor Dole inspires the sort of
fervour that the Perotistas engendered in 1992.
Nor do the other Republican contenders. The most extreme, Patrick
Buchanan, the crypto-fascist journalist and Richard Nixon speech-writer,
is the nearest to an outsider (all the rest are senators or ex-senators
and governors), but he is too extreme to win the party nomination. He
has played with the idea of offering himself as an independent, but he
could not pay for it himself, and raising $40m-$50m is a daunting
challenge.
An independent, incidently, can take the plunge much later than a
third party, although he would still have to summon up an enormous
number of signatures to get on the ballot. In 1992, Perot was in the
race and out again and back again as late as September.
Perot, no doubt about it, would be responding to the general message
of disaffection by offering himself again. However, he is now better
known, and though the disaffection may be even deeper next year than in
1992, Perot may answer it less well.
That nasal, bad-tempered, know-it-all Texan twang can be extremely
irritating. If he carries off the California trick, then we will hear a
lot of it. As an official third party candidate, he will take part in
all the presidential debates again and will have immense coverage.
We will hear him sneering at the president, patronising the press,
inventing splendid, meaningless aphorisms for the next year. It will add
to the fun and games.
Bad news for the Republicans -- good news for President Clinton. It
probably means that unless Powell gets the Republican nomination, he
will win again.
Trouble is, Clinton is already in a state of permanent confrontation
with Congress, and it is only too probable that the Republicans will
still control both houses after 1996 -- and that means another five
years of gridlock.

Lord James Douglas-Hamilton examines the Scottish health service and
pronounces it better than ever as reforms take effect
IT IS particularly regrettable that the National Health Service -- the
safety net for the most vulnerable people in our society -- should have
become a political football. Unfortunately that is what has happened
over the past decade as scare stories, misinformation and black
propaganda have created a mood of pessimism totally unjustified by the
actual state of health care in Scotland.
The NHS is a success story. Behind the mythology of ''the cuts'' and
the hysteria about alleged crisis in the health service the facts show
solid progress in improving patient care.
In Scotland, increase spending on the NHS since 1979 is equivalent to
53% in real terms and this will continue to increase in real terms up to
1988. Net expenditure on the health service in Scotland this fiscal year
will exceed #4 billion for the first time -- 23% higher per head than
expenditure in England. We are also pursuing a target of 3% per annum
efficiency savings. Recent NHS pay settlements reflect public-sector
pay-bill policy to which the Government is committed.
What are our strategic aims? They can be summarised as: improving
Scotland's health; further developing primary care; promoting care in
the community; and reshaping hospital care. It is the responsibility of
the health boards to assess the needs of our population, provide the
necessary services and tailor their resources to meet those needs.
We remain absolutely committed to the basic principle that the
necessary health care is available -- free -- at the point of delivery
to those in need of it. The annual report on the NHS in Scotland,
published last week, illustrated the gratifying progress we are making
on the Patient's Charter and the continuing improvement in NHS
performance in Scotland.
In the past three years the average waiting time for a first
out-patient appointment has been reduced from seven to five weeks.
Three-quarters of non-urgent patients receive their first out-patient
appointment within nine weeks of referral by their GP. As recently as
March, 1991, nearly 13% of patients waited more than a year for
treatment; this has now been reduced to 1.8%. Some 80% of patients who
do not require immediate admission receive treatment within three months
of going on a waiting list.
At the sharp end -- accident and emergency cases -- the record is
good. Now 74% of accident and emergency cases are seen by a doctor
within the locally set target times and 83% of such cases have their
treatment completed within the local target time (usually two-three
hours).
In Scotland we have encouraged health boards and trusts to produce
local charters. It is vital that the consumers should be well-informed
about what is being done in the health service and should have their own
input into the deliberations on further improvement.
It is pleasing to record that these local charters have already led to
tighter guarantees on waiting times than those laid down in the national
Patient's Charter. It is in the nature of things that patient input will
frequently be in the form of a complaint; that is fair enough and much
to the purpose.
We are anxious to deal with complaints adequately and promptly and
have accepted the recommendations of the Wilson Report Being Heard, with
a view to simplifying the procedure. From April next year the new common
procedure for clinical and non-clinical complaints will be in place,
guaranteeing simplicity of administration, impartiality and
accessibility.
GP fundholding gives real power to general practitioners and has
produced improved services for patients. By April next year there will
be more than 300 GP practices in the scheme, serving 42% of the
population. Fundholding got off to a slow start but, as its benefits
become evident, it has gathered momentum.
The expansion of the scheme next April will entail a lowered list size
entry requirement from 6000 to 4000 patients and inclusion of nearly all
elective surgery in-patient and day case surgery as well as most
out-patients hospital attendances. A new option called Primary Care
Purchasing will be open to all practices, regardless of list size, to
purchase primary and community services health care.
National Health Service trusts are more local and accountable to those
who use their services. Their responsibility for a wider remit brings
them closer to the local community than the previous health boards and
their non-executive directors have strong connections with the local
community.
New codes of conduct have been introduced to regulate the operation of
trusts. They must also respond to the wishes of general practitioners
who act on behalf of patients and, if fundholders, buy services for
their patients. Trusts are also less bureaucratic and provide more
information to patients. The trusts' own patient charters make a
commitment to explicit standards of service. More out-patient services
are offered in the evening and at weekends.
One particularly exciting departure in modernising health care in
Scotland is the initiative at Stonehaven, where a state-of-the-art
hospital will replace two older, unsuitable facilities. The proposals
will identify best value for money and most likely will result in
earlier provision of a new hospital.
Quality of care will be maintained and the health board will include
quality stipulations and monitoring arrangements in its eventual
contract with whoever provides the service. The health board is in a
position to enforce the necessary high standards.
It does not mean privatisation of the NHS; people will not have to pay
for health care. The National Health Service will remain free. On the
other hand, the health board will be able to identify the best pattern
of service by investigating all the options.
The private sector is already well established in long-stay provision
and has proved its capacity for producing new and innovative solutions.
The services affected at Stonehaven are limited -- GPs provide services
at the existing hospitals and will continue to do so at the new
facility.
Altogether, the Stonehaven development is a promising innovation but,
predictably, it has attracted extravagant criticism from dogmatic
opponents of change, in politics and the media. Such people have made
the health service a battlefield.
Such is their doctrinaire loathing of participation by the private
sector that they would rather see patients moulder in outdated hospitals
than enjoy the benefits of private investment in superior facilities.
Dogma has blinded them to the interests of patients and their endless
detraction of our health service is worse than irresponsible.
Of course there are still problems with the health service. In many
respects, however, the NHS is the victim of its own success and that of
medical science. Twenty years ago a hip-replacement operation was not
regarded as an automatic right, a routine life-enhancing service for
senior citizens. Today that is the case and it is extremely gratifying
to witness the extension of quality life it ensures.
Yet this is just one example of the ever-expanding demands on the NHS
of an increasingly ageing population. Concepts of service have also been
redefined. When an opposition politican raised a scare some time ago
about a large waiting-list at a Scottish hospital, it turned out to be
substantially composed of women waiting for the removal of tattoos. Yet
hysteria and hype has given rise to a fantasy picture of the health
service as a regime of ramshackle institutions where patients occupy a
bed in shifts.
Every closure of a bed, a ward or a hospital facility which has become
locally surplus to requirements or clinically obsolete is greeted with a
well-orchestrated public outcry. The modern, efficient and
technologically advanced facilities which replace them are not afforded
equivalent publicity.
We must embark upon a campaign to inform and educate the public about
what is really happening in the health service -- their health service.
They have a right to know and a right not to be misinformed.
We have a good story to tell about the National Health Service in
Scotland and it deserves wider circulation. It is a story which reflects
credit on all concerned: doctors, nurses, administrators and workers at
all levels of hospital and community service. It is a matter for
reassurance, but not complacency. The health service has been enormously
improved and is on target for further progress. It is one of Scotland's
greatest assets and we should take pride in it rather than disparage it.
* Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is Minister of State at the Scottish
Office.

Margaret Vaughan finds a new optimism among scientists in the wake of
yesterday's announcement of a breakthrough in Aids research
We're in the middle of an era of incredibly sophisticated science and
there's this goddamn virus that has rapidly evolved to stay always a
step ahead and it's sticking its tongue out and saying ''I don't care
how smart you are, you don't have me yet''.
THE words of a despondent US scientist whose trials of yet another
promising vaccine had collapsed give eloquent testimony to the raging
frustration of those involved in Aids research.
False dawns have been so frequent that people have stopped looking to
the sky for signs of hope. The mood about Aids research has been rising
and falling in a regular cycle of hope and despair since the disease was
recognised 12 years ago. The international Aids conference in Japan last
summer marked a trough of scientific pessimism. This year, spirits are
rising again.
Now the dejection of scientists, who warned that considerable hurdles
stood in the way of countering the disease, has been replaced by a new
but guarded optimism due to several research successes. Such advances
may not yet mark the long-awaited dawn, but there is a discernible
lightening of the gloom.
And when you get right down to it, those harbouring the HIV virus and
those dying from full-blown Aids, and those who aren't yet but will be
infected, don't have time to hang about the chandelier-tiered hotel
rooms of international conferences consoling the scientists and
researchers and drug companies and governments that science will, one
day, triumph over the impudent pathogen. What's mere failure to the
scientists is a death sentence to the sufferers.
Yesterday's announcement that a cocktail of drugs, combining two of
the drugs given to patients with HIV and Aids, reduced deaths by 38%
over two years. Experts at the Medical Research Council said trials had
shown that the Aids virus may be held in check by combinations of drugs
that prevent it developing into the full-blown disease. HIV could then
become controllable. It offers a curb not a cure. And it was being
hailed as the most important result in a decade of research.
Vaccines that might protect against Aids and drugs which could counter
its relentless effects are now viewed as promising prospects for the
first time in many years.
In June this year, scientists discovered the first evidence in humans
that protection against HIV is possible. The research has important
implications for the development of an Aids vaccine.
Researchers in Oxford announced they had uncovered the first
authenticated evidence that some individuals can mount a successful
immune defence against HIV. A fortnight earlier, two teams in the United
States published evidence showing that the body can sustain effective
counterattacks against the virus for many years.
The developments were described as encouraging by researchers at the
Institute of Molecular Medicine in Oxford. The Oxford research says
natural defences can be effective against Aids while the US study showed
that, even in the majority of cases where immune systems fail, they
still put up a lengthy -- if losing -- fight.
The first research, by Dr Sarah Rowland-Jones, involved the discovery
of five Gambian prostitutes who had been repeatedly exposed to HIV but
who carried no trace of the virus. They had been exposed to HIV-2 -- the
weaker of the virus's two strains.
Their bodies reacted by creating killer T-cells which destroyed cells
infected with the virus. This was effective against both strains. The
women were found to have a common genetic constitution. This indicated
that their immune systems reacted to the Aids virus in a specific way.
If scientists can work out the exact nature of this response they could
try to mimic it.
Harvard Aids Institute scientists reported in the journal Science that
infection with the second milder HIV-2 virus sharply reduces the chance
of infection with HIV-1.
The findings suggest a new avenue for research into fine-tuning the
natural protection and delivering it in the form of a safe vaccine.
Ideally, researchers say, a vaccine could stimulate an immune response
similar to that triggered by HIV-2, but not expose patients to the risk
of infection.
Any effective vaccine is most likely to be based on stimulating killer
T-cells in advance of infection, according to Professor Robin Weiss of
the Institute of Cancer Research in London.
It is this approach that now preoccupies many Aids laboratories. In
May, hopes of finding an effective vaccine were raised by British
researchers working on monkeys, according to the Lancet. Monkeys
vaccinated with a specially weakened version of the SIV virus -- the
simian form of HIV -- survived injection with a virulent strain of the
virus.
Dr Neil Almond and colleagues from the National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control in Hertfordshire vaccinated eight
monkeys with SIV treated to make it so weak that it was no longer
infectious. Almost a year later, four of the animals were injected with
virulent SIV while the other four were injected with SIV-infected cells.
None of the eight vaccinated monkeys became infected, while eight other
monkeys not given the vaccine became SIV positive.
The research apparently overcame a major obstacle in the development
of an Aids vaccine -- the problem of making such a vaccine to give
protection against HIV-infected cells as well as against the virus
itself. The researchers suggested the way forward was to understand the
immune mechanisms which had produced the protection shown by the
monkeys. Less hazardous ways of producing the vaccine could then be
investigated.
Initial results of trials on AG1343, designed by an American drugs
company, were shown last month to a meeting of the International Society
of Antiviral Research in New Mexico. It was described as ''an exciting''
compound by the co-ordinator of trials at the Kobler Centre, Europe's
leading unit for testing anti-HIV drugs.
In April, in London, levels of HIV in Aids patients were found to be
cut by 99% by a drug under test. The results were available on only a
handful of patients, but scientists were heartened by the absence of
side effects and the dramatic effects on the virus in the blood stream.
Ploughing a lone furrow in the UK is Dr Abraham Karpas of Cambridge
University who has argued for the past 10 years that the Aids research
programmes have missed a simple way of treating patients -- giving them
blood from infected people whose bodies seem to have found a natural way
of combating the Aids virus.
Despite successful experiments and some limited trials of his passive
immunotherapy, all requests for funding from the UK's official Aids
research programme have been refused.
Last month the US National Academy of Sciences published results of a
major study carried out by French scientists which suggested that such
treatment may be a more effective approach than previously believed and
could offer clinical benefits and open paths to HIV treatment.
That same US scientist whose despondency illuminates the frustrations
of science in the fight against the virus has a sign on his desk. It is
a quotation from Albert Sabin, who developed the oral polio vaccine and
it says that a scientist who is also a human being cannot rest while
knowledge which might be used to reduce suffering rests on the shelf.
It's an eloquent reminder for all those involved with Aids that the work
to conquer it must, like the disease, be relentless.

A GUNMAN'S attempt to get revenge on a gang of illegal moneylenders
misfired, a court heard yesterday.
James Lang, 34, fired a sawn-off shotgun into the crowded Girnin Gates
pub in Drumchapel, Glasgow, during a karaoke night.
Screaming woman and other customers threw themselves to the floor as
Lang, wearing a mask, shot into their midst. However, he missed his
intended victims and managed only to shoot the leg off a wooden chair.
Then, after being chased down the street by angry customers, he was
caught and kicked unconscious and was taken to hospital.
Lang was jailed for five years and three months yesterday when he
admitted a charge of assault to the danger of life.
Defence advocate Ian Anderson told the High Court in Glasgow that Lang
and his family had been stabbed and slashed by illegal moneylenders.
Mr Anderson said Lang, of Fettercairn Avenue, Drumchapel, believed the
pub in Hecla Square was the base of his tormentors.
Mr Anderson said: ''His mother was forced out of her home and both he
and his brother have been stabbed and slashed because of a #3000 debt to
illegal moneylenders. His mother's front door was attacked by a man
wielding a chain saw.''
Temporary Judge John Wheatley, QC, said he had taken into account the
background involving the moneylenders on passing sentence.
Lang was originally charged with attempting to murder a number of
women customers in the pub and a Mr Kevin Keilly, his intended victim.
However, his plea of not guilty was accepted by the Crown and he
admitted the lesser charge of seriously assaulting Mr Keilly to the
danger of his life by shooting at him.

THE number of people complain-
ing to the Adjudicator of the Inland Revenue is soaring, it emerged
yesterday.
Most complaints centre on tax office mistakes and the way it uses its
discretion.
In her second annual report since she was made Adjudicator to the
Inland Revenue in 1993, Ms Elizabeth Filkin admits she regularly sees
cases of bad work and poor handling of complaints.
The number of complaints during the year to the end of March rose to
2581 from 1615 in the first 11 months of the adjudicator's office being
established in 1993.
''We have taken on more staff and will be recruiting more,'' Ms Filkin
said.
''The increase is not because things are getting worse but because
more people are aware of our office.''
Her office took up 504 new cases for full investigation in 1994/95 and
completed 381 investigations.
''The main things people complained about were mistakes by the Inland
Revenue and the way it had exercised -- or not exercised --
discretion.''
The average cost of each investigation amounted to just over #2000.
She found in favour of the complainant in 51% of the 381 cases
completed and she recommended that the Revenue pay compensation in 80
cases.
The highest payment was #7016 and the average #450.
''Sadly, there is still much resistance to paying compensation,
although it is getting better,'' she told a news conference.
In other cases, she recommended that the Revenue apologise; write-off
tax; or collect tax debts over a longer period than originally offered.
The adjudicator's job is to deal with complaints about handling, such
as delay, errors, and discourtesy. She does not consider appeals about
tax law or liability.

The pensioner, in his late 60s, purchased the weapons legally as
deactivated replicas. He then travelled to gun enthusiasts' fairs around
the country buying up parts to turn his collection into a real arsenal.
One of the officers who visited his home said: ''He could have

No charges are being brought against the man, as he was unaware he had

THE whole of Scotland is to receive less home heating aid than the
English counties of Wiltshire and Avon from a winter energy discount
scheme to be announced by the Department of Environment tomorrow.
The programme involves distributing five million voucher books to
owner-occupiers across the UK, offering up to #300 savings on
energy-efficiency appliances and improvement work.
A Department of Environment circular sent to participating appliance
suppliers, obtained by The Herald, shows Glasgow receiving fewer
vouchers than Clacton-on-Sea, Dundee fewer than Margate, and Scotland's
total allocation to be 142,230, or 3% fewer than Wiltshire and Avon.
The Highlands and Islands are excluded completely from the scheme, as
are Inverness and Stirling. Scotland's most northerly recipients, in
Aberdeen, will receive 11,000 discount books, the same as the town of
Newhaven, near Brighton.
The vouchers, which are redeemable from private sector suppliers
between October and January, offer reductions on improvements such as
double-glazing and cavity insulation for houses more than 10 years old
nominated by the Department of Environment. Some smaller items, such as
energy-saving lightbulbs and control timers, are also included.
However, fuel suppliers and action groups last night moved to condemn
Scotland's allocation.
Heatwise's chief executive in Dumbarton, Mr John McNeil, whose
charitable company will offer discounts through a private subsidiary,
claimed the scheme was ''ridiculously skewed'' and was
''discriminatory'' towards Scottish households.
He said: ''I can hardly believe that the Government sees the whole of
Scotland as being the same as a small portion of South-west England in
terms of needing help with energy improvements.
''Stirling does not exist, Inverness does not exist, and what we know
to be the coldest part of the country, the Highlands, does not exist
according to the allocation.''
He called for the Department of Environment to make public the
selection criteria for participating households, adding: ''Yet again it
shows that Scotland is far down the list in Whitehall when it comes to
energy.
''We are horrified but not surprised. We see this pattern all the
time, unfortunately.''
Energy Action Scotland's director, Ms Ann Marno, said that it was
''ridiculous'' and called for Scotland's share to be raised to 10%.
She added: ''I am sure that there are many homes in Scotland which
could benefit from the discounted improvements who are not being given
the opportunity by virtue of where they are situated.
''If people in Inverness, for instance, cannot access the scheme then
how can they be expected to carry out home improvements themselves.''
However, a Department of Environment spokesman said the it had drawn
up the list ''scientifically'' and denied that Scotland had been
unfairly treated.
He said: ''It was worked out on a targeting basis depending on the
number of homes in an area that can best utilise the improvements
offered by the scheme. It was decided on a nationwide criteria and not
regionally. Scotland has not been penalised on that basis.''

SCOTS were warned yesterday that anti-English prejudice could damage
the tourism industry.
In a hard-hitting speech at the Scottish Tourism Oscars, Mr Alistair
Mair, chairman and managing director of Caithness Glass, criticised pub
patrons who aggressively supported England's opposition during the Rugby
World Cup.
Drunken lager louts who roamed deserted town centres were also the
focus of a speech which pointed out that the tourism industry was under
tough attack in a market place where more people were taking cheap
foreign flights.
Also, many middle-ranking hotels were not offering value for money and
were found to be lacking in courteous service.
As an example, Mr Mair, chairman of the Oscars judging panel, said
that during the judges' tour he was refused a boiled egg for breakfast
in his room in a hotel; he did not name it.
Speaking at the Turnberry Hotel, Ayrshire, Mr Mair said: ''I have a
niggling but growing concern about another faction which is working
against tourism in Scotland, particularly in regard to our main market
in England and that is an element of anti-English sentiment . . .
''The attitude appearing in pubs and elsewhere during the Rugby World
Cup when Scots were aggressively supporting any team England were
playing against, can also be off-putting for visitors.
''While the tourist industry, the STB, and various other agencies can
promote Scotland all over the world, the problems of lager louts and
anti-English prejudice are the responsibilities of everyone, and
particularly the political parties jockeying for position in the run-up
to the next election.''
Mr Mair praised the work of many non-Scots who had brought spark,
drive, and enterprise to improve the service in situations where native
Scots had been less active.
He said: ''They may be incomers but they are not white settlers and
they have brought significant strengths to the Scottish tourism industry
which should be much encouraged.''
He praised the imaginative work of the Scottish Tourist Board for the
success of this year's summer season, which was greatly helped by the
good weather.
He commended its ability to raise standards, publicise activities, and
generally remarket Scotland's summer attractions.
The speech comes only weeks after it was hoped that the box office
block-buster Braveheart may create a tourist invasion next year.
Mr Mair and called on all Scottish politicians and the entire Scottish
population to help stop anti-English behaviour.
In praising the work of the Scottish Tourist Board he said: ''The
Scottish Tourist Board's marketing efforts are vital not only to
hopefully increase the number of visitors, but just to hold what we
have.''
The Scottish Tourism Oscars are sponsored by Caithness Glass, Grampian
Television, and The Herald. The winners, who received their awards of
Caithness glass, were Best Tourism Town -- Largs; Best Tourism Village
-- Ballater; Best Tourist Attraction -- Oban Rare Breeds Farm Park; Best
On-The-Water Attraction -- Loch Insh Watersports Centre; Most Glorious

THE city that had the first reported case of leukemia will launch a
#1m appeal today to develop a state-of-the-art research centre for
sufferers.
The unit, at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, will be named the
John Hughes Bennett Centre, in honour of the Englishman who discovered
the disease while working in Edinburgh 150 years ago.
It will be linked to a 14-bed bone marrow transplant suite for
patients with leukemia and related blood cancers, offering the chance to
translate successful research into action.
The transplant suite, currently under construction, is due to be
completed next spring and will work with existing facilities at
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
The joint appeal will be made by Viscount Chelsea on behalf of the
Leukemia Research Fund, the University of Edinburgh, and the Western
General Hospital NHS Trust at a one-day seminar on the life of Dr
Bennett at the Royal College of Physicians.
The unit will focus on stem cell research, pioneered in the UK in the
1980s, which is set to replace bone marrow transplantation as a
treatment for leukemia and other cancers.
''This new technique still requires a lot of research to make it a
routine procedure. It has tremendous implications for patients with
leukemia and other patients with cancer,'' said Dr David Grant,
scientific director of the Leukemia Research Fund.
An estimated 1% of the population will be afflicted by a cancer of the
blood during their life, which represents 1500 new cases annually in
Scotland of leukemia and other blood cancers.
Scottish leukemia doctors and scientists have been awarded research
grants and fellowships from the charity totalling more than #4m in the
past three years.
There are currently 17 research projects based in hospitals and labs
in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St Andrews, each adding to
the understanding and treatment of the disease.
The first reported case of a condition, initially known as
leucocythemia, was made by the then 33-year-old Dr John Bennett in
Edinburgh in 1845. The medic, who was born in Exeter, moved to Edinburgh
in 1833 after leaving an apprenticeship with a surgeon in Maidstone in
Kent.
He graduated from Edinburgh's prestigious medical school in 1837 with
the highest honours and a gold medal.
Dr Bennett became a colourful figure. He started an Edinburgh
controversy, which became a cause celebre, by challenging the
therapeutic value of bloodletting.
He created further controversy when he supported the admission of
women medical students in Edinburgh.
He was awarded many honours both in Britain and abroad, and his
research and findings were published extensively before his death, in
1875, at the age of 63.

AN industrial tribunal has rejected a complaint by a unionist that he
had been ''black-listed'' by the new owners of his former plant.
Mr John Kydd, of Dickson Avenue, Dundee, claimed he had been refused
employment on the grounds of trade union membership and ''black-listed''
as an activist by AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions (Scotland) Ltd,
Kingsway West, Dundee.
AT&amp;T's rejection of the complaint, saying it had not been submitted
within the stipulated three-month time limit, was upheld by the
tribunal.
While working for Timex, Mr Kydd had been a convener of shop stewards
and was well known as a trade union activist, the tribunal heard. He
applied unsuccessfully for more than 50 jobs in the UK after his
employment with Timex was terminated.
The tribunal noted: ''He had been closely involved in a dispute with
the management of Timex both before and after the closure of the Timex
factory in Dundee.''
Mr Kydd's father, also John Kydd, is a divisional organiser for the
AEEU.
Another former Timex assembler, Mr Albert Low, of Findhorn Place,
Dundee, also made a claim of discrimination before the tribunal.
In August 1993 and May 1994, AT&amp;T advertised for assemblers and
received 2500 applications.
Mr Kydd and Mr Low applied to AT&amp;T for employment on a number of
occasions but were unsuccessful.
The Dundee district committee of the AEEU began monitoring AT&amp;T's
recruitment policy and in January this year requested the number of AEEU
members recruited in 1994 as well as the number of ex-Timex recruits.
The company replied that during 1994-95 they had hired five former
Timex workers.
It also stated: ''AT&amp;T operates an open, non-discriminatory policy on
recruitment, selection, and advancement and by following this there is
no necessity to vet potential candidates' previous organisational
connections.
''Candidates are selected on the basis of being 'best fit' for the
job, taking into account abilities, skills, knowledge, attitude, and
general teaming abilities.''
Mr Kydd and Mr Low decided to go ahead with their tribunal complaints
after Mr Kydd visited a public library and obtained a book about trade
union legislation.

TAXI operators in Stornoway are set to withdraw their services on
Saturday nights as a result of late-night bus services to villages.
The buses leave the town about 1.30am on Saturdays to Point, Tolsta,
Ness, the West Side, and to the Lochs area with the young people who
come into Stornoway for a night out on Fridays.
The scheme came into operation about seven weeks ago in an attempt by
the Western Isles Islands Council to get youngsters off the streets.
However, the innovation is hitting the taxi drivers' income.
Mr Neil MacNeil, secretary of Stornoway Taxi Drivers' Association,
said yesterday: ''This move is costing us between #30 and #60 on a
Friday night and it is the weekend we make our wages. What we earn
through the week goes on fuel and expenses mostly.
''We have 34 operators in our association and there are 59 cars. There
are probably a dozen who are not members of the association but this
issue affects them as well and we would expect their support.
''We will therefore be withdrawing our taxi services from 10pm on
Saturday nights as a protest against these late-night subsidised council
bus services. However, we are not revealing which Saturday nights will
be targeted.
''If the late night buses continue, it could seriously affect our
members and some of them may be forced out of business.''
Mr MacNeil said that before the late buses, the youngsters normally
went home on the 10.30 or 11pm buses. Now they were staying in town
longer.
A council spokesman said: ''It is up to the taxi operators'
association to decide whether to withdraw their services on Saturday
nights or not.''

A FILE on a Scottish National Liberation Army campaign reportedly
involving death threats and letter bombs planned in Dublin, has been
submitted to the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions.
This follows a six-month investigation involving Irish Special Branch
officers and Scottish detectives.
Death threats were reported to have been made against a number of
prominent Scottish politicians during the campaign.
A number of letter bombs were reported to have been sent in March, at
the time of the Labour Party conference in Inverness -- including one to
leader Tony Blair. None of the devices exploded.
In May, a letter bomb linked to the SNLA campaign was received at the
London office of PA News. That device was understood to have been sent
as a warning by the SNLA of possible attacks on international airlines.
Threats, thought to have been posted in Dublin, also went to American
airlines and the United States embassy in London.
In May, police investigating the affair made a number of arrests in
Dublin under the terms of Ireland's anti-terrorist Offences Against the
State Act, but all of those detained were later released.
Police inquiries were thought to centre on people living in Dublin
with SNLA connections.

WHAT is it that is making Russia die at such an alarming rate? Life
expectancy in the country, already lower than in any other developed
nation, has plummeted once more, leaving scientists, doctors, and public
health officials unclear as to the cause. In the last four years the
life span of the Russian male has dropped from 64 to 57 years. In
America, the former super-power competitor, the average male lives to be
72.
According to researchers, there is no historical precedent anywhere in
the world for the health catastrophe now befalling the Russian
Federation.
''Nobody can quite figure it out, but it is a mystery that needs to be
solved soon,'' says Judith Shapiro, an economist specialising in health
demographics at London University. In fact, no country reporting to the
World Health Organisation has such a low age rate.
In Russia, women's average age is 71, while their US counterparts
usually live to reach 80.
Distressing levels of heart disease, cancer, and industrial accidents
have always been thought to explain much of the problem. Nevertheless,
none of these provides enough of a reason for why the death rate should
have doubled in the last decade.
In the past, experts at home and in the West have argued that the
blame lies with Russia's own crippled condition: its disastrous economic
blunders; its psychological damage to the collective soul; its health
care system in ruins; its ineptitude in vaccinating against preventable
diseases.
But even that awesome burden is not sufficent to account for the
degree of loss. And it is not just adults who are at risk. During each
of the last two years alone, infant mortality has risen by 15%. In 1990,
out of every 10,000 children born, 388 died in their first year from
serious birth defects.
In 1993 the figure had risen to 407, and last year's rate reached 436.
(These findings from Russia's Ministry of Health relate only to defects
grave enough to kill).
''What we have here is a disaster,'' says Dr Alexander Chuchalin, a
member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In his view a crucial factor
must be the decades of Soviet nuclear irresponsibility, not just at the
Chernobyl power station but at waste dumps and test sites right across
the country. Even so, establishing an irrefutable link with
environmental abuse takes time, the very commodity in short supply.
Couples are now attempting their own solution by foregoing having
children. Only 1.4 million babies were born in Russia last year, less
than half the number of recorded abortions. In fact, the birthrate is
lower than in any other country, and in 1994, for the first time, the
population shrank in every one of Russia's 79 regional districts.
Intensifying the bleak outlook is the realisation that much might have
been avoided had the Kremlin listened to geneticists' warnings in the
Sixties. ''No-one believed them,'' says Alexei Yablokov, chairman of the
National Security Council's committee on ecological health and safety.
''Now congenital deformities are increasing faster than any other
health problem. As a biologist I think we have to look not so much at
the conception of children by drunken couples, but at the chemical and
radioactive contamination of this environment.''

A corrupt type of business is destroying any attempt at civilised
life.
GRAVE as any mob in Dostoevsky, but dressed in better clothes, the
businessmen of Moscow marched through the capital the other day,
trembling with protest like everybody else. No placards, only briefcases
and pinstripes marked them out, and to the onlooker their procession at
first seemed blackly comical, as if someone had spiked a Rotarian outing
with subversion.
But the reason for the gathering could not have been more critical.
Four years ago those already aware of the darker side of capitalism knew
that a racketeer class would emerge to throw its weight around in Moscow
during this post-communist transition.
Yet no-one could have imagined just how menacing and unaccountable
crime in this city would become. There are moments when the whole of
life seems to function only at the behest of gangsters, leaving ordinary
citizens with the belief that democracy has simply replaced one tyranny
with another: a sly promise ending in the dirtiest of tricks.
Poverty was clearly not the problem of that curious assembly of
entrepreneurs, but as they ended their march outside the secret police
headquarters, here was one more symptom of a city's anger and despair;
its outrage at the bully's onslaught, and the inability of the state to
safeguard order.
The fact is there are now two kinds of private enterprise in Russia,
the legitimate and the violently criminal, and those in both the East
and West who know it is in the world's best interest for Russia to
develop into a prosperous, civilised culture can only regard this
killing epidemic with dread.
In the past year alone there have been 90 attacks on businessmen, 46
of whom were slain. Of that, 10 were senior members of the Round Table,
Russia's most influential business organisation with close ties to Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The other day the chairman of Moscow's
Society for the Deaf, Igor Abramov, was fatally struck by two shots to
the head, confirming suspicions that charities are now being hijacked by
Moscow's mafia, to purge the origins of squalid cash.
But that businessmen's parade was also a requiem of sorts; a memorial
to Ivan Kivelidi, chief of the Rosbiznesbank, who, only days before he
died, had called publicly for a crackdown on organised banditry. Now,
he, too, had been silenced and the notable feature about his murder, at
the age of 46, was not his wealth or influence, but the macabre way in
which he was killed: by some dastardly sleight of hand, he and his
secretary fell victim to a medieval revenge, death by poisoning.
Kivelidi was originally a journalist who, during perestroika, founded
a chain of cafes and food co-operatives, then moved into building
construction followed by technology deals. The originator of Russia's
Round Table, which now has 270 group members through the country, he was
most widely known as a colourful and articulate spokesman for the
entrepreneurial class.
At his funeral, mourners and bodyguards arrived in equal numbers,
among them Chernomyrdin, Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader,
and Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's self-aggrandising mayor. Boris Yeltsin sent
condolences.
The Prime Minister's office disclosed that Chernomyrdin had expressed
such fury over Kivelidi's murder that he had immediately demanded a
special report on priorities against crime from the Interior, Defence,
and Security Ministries. But protestations impress no-one because of
their futile repetition.
They were expressed most vigorously last March after Vladislav
Listyev, the popular director general of Russia's biggest television
channel, was assassinated as he entered his apartment block. They were
recited, also, after the journalist, Dmitry Kholodov, was blown to
pieces while investigating corruption in the Russian military.
In neither case has anyone been brought to trial, so in seeking to
avenge Ivan Kivelidi's killing, Round Table members have now announced
their own investigation and are offering a $1m reward.
Vladimir Shcherbakov, deputy head of the organisation, reflects: ''If
anything, Moscow is worse than Chicago in the 1920s. There gangs just
shot at one another. Here, a corrupt type of business is destroying any
attempt at civilised life.''
The obvious suspects move about the country, and the world, under the
derisive title of New Russians, shifting money made through deals in
arms, drugs, artefacts, and real estate into secret bank accounts.
Mostly loud, flamboyant, violent, and uncultured, they walk as if they
make the rules, buying up elegant turn-of-the-century apartments in
Moscow's most sophisticated neighbourhood, Patriarch Ponds, and maiming
the quiet, aromatic forests that skirt the capital by building mansions
of crude grandeur.
Packed around by security men and hungry, barking dogs, these new
''cottages'' possess a fortress quality and contravene any planning laws
that exist. But since they cost upwards of $300,000, and probably as
much again for the bijou Texan-style fittings, no one complains
officially. Splashy money, always calculated in dollars because the
rouble is considered worthless, creates intimidation of its own.
But close by, yet still hidden in the trees, there is the cosy charm
of the traditional dachas, their wooden frames with lacy fretwork round
the windows, sagging now under the weight of age. In this strange
juxtaposition of old families and nouveaux bodyguards and masters, the
incomers may be recycled criminals, former military employees, or
erstwhile KGB economists now owning private banks.
All will be licensed to carry arms, but the minders use illegal
weapons, often carrying pump-action shotguns in sport bags on one
shoulder. Each day they and their bosses will travel to work in convoy,
varying the route with every trip, but always occupying the middle
traffic lane in revealing mimicry of the old party cadres. Yet despite
such precautions the hunted might not escape the sports bag attack where
a weapon, equipped with a silencer, is aimed from within the holdall, or
''the Macedonian shootout'' where the gun is fired from the hip.
Historically, the New Russians emerged in three waves. The first
amassed huge money in financial services and property. The second (which
includes Chernomyrdin), secured its wealth from privatising state
industries via management buyouts, share issues and asset-stripping,
cornering oil, gas, minerals, and ores for sale abroad. The third, the
Hungry Wolves, is mainly composed of mafia hoods who made their initial
millions on the streets.
Unlike the first two groups who have found respectability through
banking and real estate, the wolves have been locked out of legitimate
investments, so they train their lethal sights on those who block their
way. Alternatively, they launder money through vulnerable sectors such
as children's hospitals.
Within this camp the brawling right-wing extremist, Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, finds a natural home, for, except when it comes to
exploiting the lush playgrounds of the world, the Hungry Wolves are
viciously xenophobic, wasting no opportunity to bring the poisons of
nationalism to the boil.
In open conflict with them, ethnic godfathers also dominate certain
Moscow neighbourhoods. As President Yeltsin continually insists, a
Chechen mob terrorises the capital, but is only one wild clan among
many. By controlling the import and export market, these robber barons
dictate the price of everything, including food. Even traders from
elsewhere in the Federation must pay tolls to them if they want their
products to reach the city's main markets.
''There is not a single businessman here who doesn't fork out
protection money of some sort,'' says Larisa Kislingskya, the robust and
respected crime correspondent of the news agency Tass. A dogged
investigator who has been threatened frequently because of her exposes,
she is determined to challenge corruption rather than allow the ''the
thugs to win''. However, like many Russians, her faith in the police is
negligible. ''Senior officers are extremely professional, but they are
few in number and thoroughly demoralised. The rank-and-file are rife
with graft.''
For risking her life in the cause of decency, Kislingskya earns just
$200 a month. ''Because of our history of state control there is no law
against organised crime. No law of corruption, either. How could there
be when the state owned everything?'' Such safeguards, she reflects,
would have implied the state itself was dishonest.
Even so, Kislingskya argues that before 1985 life was safer in Russia.
''Killing with a firearm was a sensation, and the murderer was always
found. Now gangsters have military grenades in their arsenals, and as
social order disintegrates, ordinary people are pushed into crime by
poverty.''
As for punishment, the pain and price of it seem to settle only on
victims and the bereaved. But there is a financial sanction -- the
withdrawal of foreign funds which the west may yet inflict if the
government does not strengthen its hand against the mobsters.
So if joint ventures are threatened, it is surely in the government's
interest to sort the gangsters out? ''Ah, you are presuming a
distinction between the government and corruption'' says one American
observer. At the Moscow Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
Michael McFaul, a visiting academic, comments that there are plenty of
influential officials, the cold war hawks, who are quite happy for
corruption to continue, and not necessarily because they themselves are
growing fat on payola.
''Part of the state believes foreign investment is vital for the
Russian economy and the stability of the world. But lots of
protectionist politicians would like nothing better than for foreigners
to turn and run.'' It is this shuttered brand of nationalism that binds
together the very rich and very poor. The first seek to corner power
entirely, the second (now 80% of Russia), seethe with disillusion at
what they call the west's betrayal.
In the high-crime Kuzminky district of Moscow, Lieutenant Roman
Fyodorov is one of only two investigators with a legal education. His
police station, a grim building with broken-down vehicles in the
courtyard, covers 130,000 people in a city of 10 million, and is
equipped with one computer for 180 police officers.
A university graduate with 18 years' experience, Fyodorov earns around
$120 a month, a salary slightly more than that of a teacher, a little
less than that of a doctor. If he worked on the outside as a bodyguard,
he could earn at least five times that sum.
Reflecting on earlier times, he says:''Before, no professional thief
would kill. It was a sort of honour. Now the cruellest crimes are
carried out because society is caught between values. The old ones are
dead, the new ones not yet born.''
Within Vagankovskye, Moscow's most illustrious cemetery, not far from
the grave where the poisoned banker Ivan Kivelidi is now buried, there
are the tombstones of two brothers, Otari Kvantrishvili, killed last
April by a sniper, and his elder brother, Amiran, assassinated eight
months earlier. Born in Georgia, they were raised in the Krasnopresnesky
quarter of Moscow by a family who trained them brilliantly in gambling
and fraud.
But Otari became far more impressive than a card sharp. A noted
athlete and wrestler in his youth, he was an important businessman and
politician, a philanthropist beloved by war veterans and orphans. And as
everyone also knew, but only ever mentioned in whispers, Otari was a
gangster, one of the most powerful in Russia.
At his funeral, three days after he was shot from a kindergarten
window, the stately lines of mourners confirmed everything about the
perilous intrigue in Moscow today. With black armbands and roses they
gathered, actors, sportsmen, politicians, tycoons, crooners, impresarios
. . . all in some way connected to fortunes piled up first from vice or
built on shady deals.
Otari had also been a coach for Dynamo, the Moscow club of the
Militia, his role there drawing him into contact with eminent cultural
figures and aides close to Boris Yeltsin. Today he and his brother are
watched over by a haloed angel made of stone, whose wing-span is just
broader than the minders who failed to defend them.
Their headstones back on to those of two other heroes -- Vladimir
Visotsky, Russia's modern bard and balladeer who pitted his alcoholic's
voice against communist oppression, and died of cardiac arrest, and Vlad
Listyev, that admired TV director general, who wanted to purge
corruption from the media. Shrines to good and evil, as close together
in death as in life.
Three murdered men, and now a fourth with Kivelidi, and still not a
single assassin brought to justice. When well-known figures expire in
Russia today, no one should ever assume they die from natural causes.

Black suits her. The allure of the Sicilian widow is captured in this
season's tailoring, giving the modern woman the opportunity of
displaying sense and sensuality, explains John Davidson
SHE IS the Gina Lollobrigida or Sophia Loren of the cornfields . . . a
perfect picture of alluring sensuality. Her tailored black suits may be
ever so refined, but the jackets are unfastened to reveal a pretty lace
basque. A veil barely masks a perfectly drawn eyebrow. Her gutsy glamour
contrasts dramatically with the harshness of peasant life. Marriage to
the mob has clearly had its compensations.
There is a wonderful elegance about this season's tailoring. But
unlike the svelte couture constructions of the late fifties -- from
which current fashion is stealing shamelessly for inspiration, it is not
worn over armour-plated foundationwear. The modern woman has dieted to
her optimum weight. She has exercised to the peak of fitness. She wants
to show off her body, not contort it with corsetry to some arbitrary
(and temporary) ideal of physical beauty.
But neither does she wish to dance near-naked in the streets. A
glimpse of stocking may now be very short of shocking. But we have had
enough of designers whose only idea for eveningwear is to send a
stick-thin model off down their runway clad in nothing but bra and
panties. Underwear is no longer masquerading as outerwear -- such
blatant exposure has become a total bore. For real sex appeal exists in
the balance between what is seen and what is saved, as it were, for
later.
Underwear is now back where it truly belongs. But that's not to say it
has disappeared wholly from view. For the modern world, the impossibly
buttoned-up two-dimensional glamour of yesteryear needs to be tempered
with a touch of humour, a suggestion of irony, a hint of trashiness.
This means your slip just might be showing. A lacey bra can peep above
the neckline of a shapely jacket. Stockings will be seamed, and shoes
kitten-heeled.
In a world of restless change, black remains a fashion constant. It
always looks sophisticated. It always seems chic. And, yes -- it's very
sexy too.

Mr Pat Watson's 40ft vessel, the Janet Rae, was towed into Bembridge
harbour on the Isle of Wight by the town's lifeboat late on Monday.
During the voyage to Brightlingsea and back Mr Watson, 56, called out
lifeboats eight times; ran aground three times; got lost in the Thames
Estuary for four days; ran out of fuel; squashed the boat owner he was

her temper. ''Fame is a responsibility . . . To your family and fans and
you need to attend these classes so there isn't any future tragedy,''
Judge Rich Fitterer told Love, the widow of Nirvana star Kurt Cobain.

TIRANA: Sixteen tonnes of 30-year-old British biscuits, supposed to be
fed only to animals, were sold instead to people in Albania, a Tirana
newspaper reported. The biscuits, which arrived last year as part of an
aid package, had been sold to people in the central town of Rrogozhina.
There were no reports of health problems but the company that sold the
old biscuits has been fined #330.

of steam and ash were shown around the world. However authorities
maintained a level four alert, meaning ''hazardous eruption in

THE United Nations faced financial collapse unless the member states
paid their dues, the Foreign Secretary, Mr Malcom Rifkind, warned
yesterday in New York.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Mr Rifkind said the UN was owed
more than $37bn in unpaid contributions, while troop contributing
countries, of which Britain is the largest, were owed nearly $1bn.
Calling for tougher penalties for debtors, including charging interest
on late payments, Mr Rifkind said that last year 39 countries failed to
pay up. ''We find cross-funding of regular budgets from the
peace-keeping budget unacceptable,'' he added.
''The financing arrangements must change. Some members pay too much.
Others, like the new economic giants of the developing world, now pay
less than they should. We need a scale that is simpler and reflects a
country's real capacity to pay, one without the additional anomalies and
distortions of the present system.''
Britain and Sweden, both major contributors to UN peacekeeping, had
put forward ideas he said and progress on those was needed soon because
the problem would not be solved by turning the tap off.
Mr Rifkind also backed the enlargement of the permanent membership of
the Security Council, proposing the addition of Germany and Japan, both
countries playing an increasing part across the range of UN business as
well as being among the top three financial contributors.
It was right they should benefit from any expansion of permanent
membership with the wider rights and responsibilities that entailed, he
added.
Turning to the next 50 years of the UN, Mr Rifkind said greater effort
should be focused on preventive action and peacebuilding. It was better
to stop a fire igniting than to contain or extinguish it.
Although the prospects for peace looked a little stronger, Bosnia was
the most tragic example of this. Much of the damage and destruction
might have been prevented by closer international attention to the
problems and tensions arising from the break up of Yugoslavia in the
early 1990s, he said.
He also called for a new approach to UN peacebuilding which meant
bridging the gap between humanitarian aid and long-term development
work. The task of rebuilding Bosnia could be a model for the future, he
said.

Darwin
THE inquest into the 1980 death of baby Azaria Chamberlain -- which
her parents blamed on a wild dog, or dingo -- was re-opened today by an
Australian coroner.
If a verdict is issued it could finally exonerate her parents Michael
and Lindy Chamberlain or find them culpable in her death.
Deputy Northern Territory coroner Irene Bruninghausen said: ''It
will be a very limited inquest.''
In December last year coroner John Lowndes re-opened the inquest into
nine-week-old Azaria's death, saying the law required him to ''finalise
the manner and cause of the death of Azaria Chamberlain''. He took new
evidence and then closed the inquest without issuing a verdict.
Azaria's mysterious disappearance from the Ayers Rock camping ground
during a family holiday has already resulted in two inquests, a trial,
two appeals, and a royal commission.
The re-opening of the case was prompted by reports that Mr Michael
Chamberlain, Azaria's father, planned to seek the quashing of a 1982
coroner's inquest that resulted in him and his wife being tried for
murder.
An inquest in February 1981 cleared the Chamberlains and found that a
dingo had killed their baby, but doubts about the case triggered a new
inquest the following year.
Mrs Lindy Chamberlain was convicted of murder and sentenced to life
imprisonment, while her husband received an 18-month suspended sentence
after being found guilty of being an accessory after the fact.
In 1987 a government commission effectively cleared the couple and the
following year the Territory Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the
convictions.
The trials, inquests, and government commission set off a media blitz
and provoked public interest in Australia comparable only with the
attention given to the O J Simpson murder trial.
Hollywood cast Meryl Streep and Sam Neill as the Chamberlains in a
1988 film version of the story called A Cry in the Dark.-- AP

Cairo
LIBYA has ordered all 30,000 Palestinians in the country out of their
homes into makeshift camps within 24 hours to prepare for their
expulsion.
A Libyan border offical said the Palestinians would be taken to camps,
then ferried in batches to another encampment on the border with Egypt,
where they would be expelled.
Earlier a UN official said Libya had already sent one group of 1500
Palestinians to the Egyptian-Libyan border.
The decision raised the prospect of a humanitarian crisis, because so
far Egypt has refused to accept expelled Palestinians, except those
transiting with official papers to Jordan or Gaza and the West Bank.
Other Arab countries are also reluctant to take them.
Dozens of expelled Palestinians, hoping to go to Gaza, were stranded
for weeks recently at the Salloum border crossing, penned in by barbed
wire and begging for food from travellers.
Libya, which has condemned the Palestinians' landmark 1993 peace
accord with Israel, took the steps just days after Israel and the PLO
initialed the next stage of their agreement for expanding Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank.
''It could be that the peace accord has led (Libyan leader Muammar)
Gaddafi to speed up the expulsions,'' Panos Moumtzis, Cairo
representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said. ''The clear objective is that Gaddafi wants to embarrass
(PLO leader Yasser) Arafat over the signing of the agreement.''
Libya said Sunday's Israeli-PLO deal was ''another step towards more
concessions to the enemies of the Arab nation''.
Diplomats in Tripoli have said large numbers of Palestinians and other
foreigners were rounded up recently after reports of unrest and a
campaign to crack down on illegal migrant labour.
Palestinians have been particularly targeted because of Gaddafi's
scathing rejection of the peace accord with Israel. Hundreds have been
expelled in an attempt to show up the limits of Palestinian self-rule in
the Gaza Strip.
A group of 153 finally left Salloum on Saturday after Jordan gave them
permission to enter.
Moumtzis, who visited Salloum yesterday to distribute food and
blankets to 21 Palestinians left behind, said he saw 12 large tents set
up on the Libyan side of the border.
''Libya wants to make a camp for them near the border and get them out
of the country,'' he said.
He described conditions on the border as hostile. Swarms of flies and
mosquitoes were increasing the risk of illness.
''It's a rubbish dump there.''Reuter.

United Nations
LIBYA has repeated its stance that it will not extradite to Britain or
the United States the two men wanted in connection with the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, in which 270 died.
Its ambassador to the UN, Mohamed Azwai Azwai, said the suspects could
be handed over for trial in The Hague, Netherlands, where a Scottish
judge could conduct the trial.
He said the major reason why Libya would not extradict the two to the
US or Britain was ''because both countries are adversaries. They have
condemned the suspects before the trial takes place.''
He was replying to US Secretary of State Warren Christopher's speech
to the General Assembly, in which he said the Security Council had
recognised the importance of countering State-sponsored terrorism by
imposing sanctions on Libya.
Azwai said Libya was not guilty of terrorism but its victim. He
alleged the US trained and sheltered terrorists against Libya.
He said that if the suspects were found guilty Libya would pay
compensation, but if they were acquitted, Libya would sue the US and
Britain.
He said the Security Council embargo on air transport, some oil
equipment and some financial transactions should be revoked and
negotiations held to return the relations with both countries back to
normal.
The sanctions on Libya were imposed in 1992 for its failure to
extradite for trial the two men wanted in connection with the bombing of
PanAm flight 103.--Reuter.

Palermo
GIULIO ANDREOTTI, seven times Prime Minister of Italy, went on trial
today accused of using his power to help the Mafia.
The case opened in the same fortified courtroom inside Palermo's
Ucciardone prison where some of the crime syndicate's most dangerous
bosses were tried in the 1980s.
It could, however, be months before 76-year-old Andreotti is called to
give evidence and at least two years before the three judges deliver
their verdict.
Andreotti, who for decades was sought out by Popes and courted by
fellow politicians, sat taking notes at the front of the court, flanked
by his lawyers and protected by plain-clothes police.
A life senator and key figure in Italy's Christian Democrat party, he
denies accusations that he served as the Mafia's political godfather in
Rome's corridors of power.
''I feel humiliated. I'm being tried for something I didn't do,'' he
said during a break in the proceedings.
The trial opened with procedural arguments and then adjourned until
early October after several hours of discussion.
In his first decision, presiding judge Francesco Ingargiola ruled out
O J Simpson-style live television cover.
Defence lawyer Franco Coppi asked the court to switch the trial to
Rome, where the defence wants the charges heard by a special ''Tribunal
of Ministers'' which judges alleged offences by current or former
government members. No decision has been made.
''If he committed these crimes, and let me say once and for all that
we believe he did not, then he committed them in Rome,'' Coppi said.
''Cosa Nostra's interest in Andreotti was in Rome. It has no
significance whatsoever that the Mafia is based in Palermo. As the
saying goes, all roads lead to Rome.''
The prosecution, whose 100,000-page case rests heavily on evidence
from leading Mafia informers, alleges Andreotti secretly met Mafia
bosses, attempted to influence judges to overturn the convictions of
mobsters, and even tacitly approved of several murders.
In exchange for protecting the Mafia, they allege, it delivered
Sicilian votes at election times. Those votes helped keep him at the
apex of the Christian Democrats, the party that dominated Italian
governments and state industry until the early 1990s.
The Christian Democrats collapsed under the weight of a kickback
scandal, and Andreotti's career ended.
''The only important thing is that this trial can teach Italians about
the relationship between politics and organised crime,'' said Giorgio
Bocca, one of Italy's most respected commentators.
Andreotti, who faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted, has called
the charges an intricate Mafia plot to punish him for crackdowns on
crime by governments he headed.
He also has charged the case is motivated by his political enemies,
and unnamed plotters in the United States.
His lawyers intend to call several international figures as character
witnesses, including former UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
The Andreotti trial is the latest in a series of upheavals that have
made the past three years the most turbulent in Italy's post-war period.
They include the Tangentopoli (Bribesville) scandal implicating more
than 3000 politicians and businessmen that brought down the Christian
Democrats and their long-time allies; the car-bombing murders of Italy's
two leading anti-Mafia prosecutors in Palermo; the rise to premier and
fall of Silvio Berlusconi, a media magnate who founded a new party; and
the entry into government for the first time of a right-wing party
descended from Benito Mussolini's Fascist movement.--Reuter/AP.

NATO said today it had agreed an outline for a special relationship
with Russia to cover all political and military ties.
A communique said the draft proposals had been presented to Russia's
ambassador to Brussels, Vitaly Churkin.
''Nato seeks active, co-operative, and constructive relations with
Russia because we fully recognise its important role in European
security,'' the statement said.
It said the alliance initiative followed a decision by Nato Foreign
Ministers last May to negotiate a political framework for relations
between the former cold war enemies by the end of this year.
The statement said the framework would cover all ''basic principles
for security co-operation as well as for the development of mutual
political consultations''.
Relations have been severely strained recently by alliance plans to
expand eastwards into Central and Eastern Europe and by Western
criticism of the crackdown in Chechnya.--Reuter

TWO of the three men who were jailed for life for the callous murder
of a brave grandfather, as they fled in panic from a #185,000 bank
robbery, have lodged appeals against their convictions.
Mr David Dunn, 63, was shot in the chest at close range as he tried to
foil the getaway of Robert Smith, Gerald McQuade, and Paul Bootland
after the robbery at the Bank of Scotland in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on
October 19, 1994.
Mr Dunn, who received a posthumous bravery award, was shot by Smith, a
Gulf war veteran, as he leaned into the getaway car and lashed out with
his shopping bag.
McQuade, 40, and Bootland, 25, have now lodged appeals against their
murder convictions, arguing that they suffered a miscarriage of justice.
One of the grounds of appeal is that the trial judge, Lord Osborne,
misdirected the jury.
The judge also jailed McQuade, of Prospecthill Road, Toryglen,
Glasgow, for 20 years for the bank robbery, Smith for 15,and Bootland,
of Greenend Grove, Edinburgh, for 10 years.
At the time of the shooting, Smith, a tank commander in the Gulf war,
was on the run from the Life Guards.
All three were also convicted of attempting to murder off-duty
policeman John Duffy, along with two members of the public, Mr John
Girdler and Mr Duncan Milliken, who risked their lives to help DC Duffy
thwart the escape.
For the attempted murder of Mr Duffy, McQuade, who actually fired the
shots, was jailed for 12 years, Smith for eight, and Bootland six.
For the attempted murders of Mr Milliken and Mr Girdler, who were
fired at by Smith, Smith got 12 years, McQuade eight, and Bootland six.
Bootland was the getaway driver and never fired a shot during the
incident, but the jury decided at the end of a 17-day trial at the High
Court in Edinburgh that because all three had gone on a bank raid armed
with loaded weapons, each was responsible for the others' actions.
Lord Osborne told the three accused: ''Tragically, David Dunn has paid
with his life the price of assisting in bringing you to justice.''
The appeal is due to be heard on October 12.

Mr Dunn, who received a posthumous bravery award, was shot by Smith, a
Gulf war veteran, as he leaned into the getaway car and lashed out with
his shopping bag.
McQuade, 40, and Bootland, 25, have now lodged appeals against their
murder convictions, arguing that they suffered a miscarriage of justice.
One of the grounds of appeal is that the trial judge, Lord Osborne,
misdirected the jury.
The judge also jailed McQuade, of Prospecthill Road, Toryglen,
Glasgow, for 20 years for the bank robbery, Smith for 15,and Bootland,
of Greenend Grove, Edinburgh, for 10 years.
At the time of the shooting, Smith, a tank commander in the Gulf war,
was on the run from the Life Guards.
All three were also convicted of attempting to murder off-duty
policeman John Duffy, along with two members of the public, Mr John
Girdler and Mr Duncan Milliken, who risked their lives to help DC Duffy
thwart the escape.
For the attempted murder of Mr Duffy, McQuade, who actually fired the
shots, was jailed for 12 years, Smith for eight, and Bootland six.
For the attempted murders of Mr Milliken and Mr Girdler, who were
fired at by Smith, Smith got 12 years, McQuade eight, and Bootland six.
Bootland was the getaway driver and never fired a shot during the
incident, but the jury decided at the end of a 17-day trial at the High
Court in Edinburgh that because all three had gone on a bank raid armed
with loaded weapons, each was responsible for the others' actions.
Lord Osborne told the three accused: ''Tragically, David Dunn has paid
with his life the price of assisting in bringing you to justice.''
The appeal is due to be heard on October 12.

THE pilot of an RAF Chinook helicopter which crashed on the Mull of
Kintyre, killing all on board, many of them top intelligence officers,
had increased his life insurance because he feared for his safety, it
was claimed yesterday.
Flight Lieutenant Richard Cook, 3O, told relatives of his unhappiness
with the aircraft's airworthiness in the months before the disaster in
June last year, when he and 28 others died.
He had taken out large amounts of life assurance because of his fears,
according to his widow, Sara.
Even though a Ministry of Defence inquiry blamed pilot error for the
crash in which senior officers of the RUC Special Branch, military
intelligence, and MI5 were killed, Flight Lieutenant Cook's family
claimed he was made a scapegoat.
His father, John, told the Belfast Telegraph: ''It was not Rick that
took them into the mountain -- it was the aircraft.''
The helicopter was on its way from RAF Aldergrove to Inverness when it
crashed on the Mull in thick fog. The flight captain, Flight Lieutenant
Jonathan Tapper, was among those killed.
An investigation report said there had been no mechanical failure and
claimed the crew had been negligent.
Mrs Cook said her husband had become increasingly concerned with the
helicopter equipment. A week before the crash he told his father, a
former RAF pilot, to ask questions if the upgraded Chinook Mark Two was
involved in an accident.
Mrs Cook said: ''I could tell he was desperately unhappy with the
helicopter. He was obviously fearful about something.
''The amount of life insurance he got in the last six months . . . he
spent too much. But he would say: 'If anything happens to me, I want you
looked after'.''

Union calls award 'obscene' as nurses battle for 3% deal.
A SALARY increase of more than 30% to the head of Scotland's biggest
NHS Trust has been described as ''obscene'' by a union official whose
members are battling for a percentage increase one tenth of that.
The annual report of Grampian Healthcare Trust shows that for the year
ended March 31, chief executive Jeremy Taylor's salary package jumped
from #75,000 to #101,000.
The total includes #9000 performance-related pay, #9000 expenses and
benefits, and #4000 in pension contributions.
Last night, Mr Taylor defended the increase, claiming he had earned
every penny.
He said: ''We work in a very tight framework set out by the Scottish
Office and we are not responsible for the salary increases. That is done
by a separate body.''
When asked if he thought his increase would damage morale among staff,
Mr Taylor replied: ''Staff in the health service think people should get
what they deserve. I have earned it.''
The trust says the salary reflects the responsibility of the job and
the increase is exaggerated because he declined a rise the previous
year.
However, Mr John Lambie, Unison's health spokesman in Scotland, said:
''A lot of people would settle for the increase Mr Taylor has received
as their salary.
''Given the information that is now becoming available from trusts
throughout the country, I think it is obscene that the chief executives
are awarding themselves massive increases.
''This comes at a time when the funding for patient care has been
substantially reduced.
''On top of that, members of staff who are actually delivering patient
care are being held over a barrel for a miserly 3% which has not yet
been finalised.
''It makes you wonder if this is a bonus for the closure of hospitals
and a reduction in services, even a bonus for destroying the NHS.''
The trust's 2800 nurses have been offered a 3% annual wage increase
but negotiations have not yet been concluded.
In the past year, the trust has closed Kingseat Hospital at Newmachar
and House of Daviot Hospital for the elderly and infirm near Inverurie.
It also plans to close Woodlands Hospital, on the outskirts of
Aberdeen, and is one of the bidders involved in open competition to
provide the services in Stonehaven currently supplied by the ageing
Arduthie and Woodcot hospitals.
The report reveals that there are more than 200 fewer nurses working
for the trust than last year and that the wage bill for nursing and
midwifery fell by #224,000 while the number of management and
administration posts rose from 427 to 471 and the wage bill went up by
#439,000.
A trust spokesman defended Mr Taylor's increase. ''His salary reflects
the responsibility of a chief executive of an organisation of the size
of Grampian Healthcare which is one of the biggest in the UK with a
budget of #136m, and which is going through a process of considerable
change because of community care,'' he said.
''Another point to make is that the remuneration committee which sets
this salary is guided by independent consultants and the salary is
obviously within the Scottish Office guidelines.
''The increase is larger than it might otherwise have been because in
the preceding year he elected to remain on a lower general manager's
grade rather than a chief executive's grade, so that has obviously
exaggerated the increase this year.
''An element of his salary is performance related and he has to meet
targets set by the trust's remuneration committee.
''His salary is consistent with the responsibilities of a chief
executive of a very large, sophisticated organisation which has 71 sites
across the North-east, 6000 staff, 21 hospitals and 46 health centres.''
Mr Taylor has spent all his working life in the health service,
starting in 1975 as a theatre assistant in North-Western Regional Health
Authority, based in Manchester.
He then held a number of executive posts in different parts of England
and spent two years as an administrator at the Armed Forces Hospital in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
He moved to Grampian in 1991 and led the NHS trust application for
Grampian Healthcare.
Surprise at the size of the increase was expressed by Dr Kim Walker,
chairman of Grampian Local Health Council, who said: ''It does seem to
be rather large. We have concerns over a wage rise of that size.
''I am not sure what more responsibility Mr Taylor has because
Grampian Healthcare have been putting so many people back out into the
community that I would have thought his responsibility would have been
less.''

'It is time to maintain the momentum for peace' -- US Secretary of
State Warren Christopher.
United Nations
BALKAN foreign ministers held a new round of Bosnia peace talks today,
with American mediators seeking to nail down an agreement on the shape
of a future two-part Bosnian state.
''This is a very important day in the negotiations,'' said US
Secretary of State Warren Christopher as he opened the negotiations with
ministers Muhamed Sacirbey of Bosnia, Mate Granic of Croatia, and Milan
Milutinovic of rump Yugoslavia.
Christopher said he hoped the ministers would reach an accord on key
Bosnian constitutional issues, including the Parliament and the
presidency, and work towards a ceasefire in Bosnia's 41-month war.
''It is time to maintain the momentum for peace and overcome the
momentum for war,'' he said.
The one-day talks aim to build on an agreement reached on September 8
in Geneva, where ministers agreed to set up a two-part state of which
49% would go to Bosnian Serbs and the rest to a Muslim and Croat
federation.
Christopher later departed, leaving the talks in the hands of chief US
negotiator Richard Holbrooke, European mediator Carl Bildt, and
officials from Britain, Russia, France, and Germany -- the Contact Group
seeking to end the Bosnian war.
Despite the US optimism, Bosnia's Sacirbey protested that there was a
basic contradiction in the talks because of what he called Serb refusal
to accept democratic elections. He accused the United States of leaning
on the Muslim-led Sarajevo Government to reach agreement.
''The other side continues to refuse to accept the requirement that
the future Parliament and presidency should be elected by popular
vote,'' he said in a speech to the UN General Assembly.
He said he was surprised and angry at having to negotiate over the
issue. Asked later if he was under US pressure, he told reporters:
''Significant pressure by which we will be deemed responsible for the
breakdown of these negotiations.''
''The problem is we have dictators dictating democracy and war
criminals dictating standards of human rights and it's hard to be
hopeful with these odds,'' he said.
Last-minute Bosnian government objections had raised doubts overnight
as to whether the meeting could take place. Christopher telephoned
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic this morning to help allay the
concerns, said US State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
Bosnia earlier dropped a threat to boycott the talks after Sarajevo
demanded and received a US assurance that Serbs would not be allowed to
secede from a future Bosnian state.
Burns told reporters Washington remained hopeful of agreement despite
the Bosnian Government objections.
And Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind put a positive gloss on today's
difficulties.
''There will be disappointments, there will be reverses but I believe
we are now in a situation where we can see we are moving towards a
political settlement,'' he said.
Since the outline agreement for peace was worked out earlier this
month, a stunning offensive by government and Croat forces has overrun
1,500 sq miles of Serb-held territory and forced 120,000 Serb civilians
to flee to their northern stronghold of Banja Luka.
Earlier today, hard-line Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic was in New
York and told a news conference: ''It is logical to expect the disputed
questions to be solved by diplomatic means.
''But if war continues, even greater suffering will be produced, not
only in this area but wider as well.''

Stuttgart
A COURT today convicted former leftist guerrilla Sieglinde Hofmann of
taking part in the murder of a top German businessman and of attempting
to kill former Nato chief Alexander Haig in the 1970s.
The court in the southern city of Stuttgart sentenced Hofmann, a
former member of the Red Army Faction (RAF) guerrilla group, to life
imprisonment. She was jailed for 15 years in 1982 for her part in
another RAF case.
Hofmann was found guilty of taking part in the kidnapping and murder
of Hanns Martin Schleyer, then chairman of the German Employers'
Federation, which rocked West Germany in 1977.
She was also convicted of helping to plan the attempted murder of
General Haig in a bomb blast in 1979.
RAF members kidnapped Schleyer and killed his four guards. They held
him for several weeks in hideouts across Europe, demanding the release
of 11 RAF guerrillas from German prisons.
Their demands were reinforced by Palestinian guerrillas who hijacked a
Lufthansa plane which was later stormed by German commandos at Mogadishu
airport in Somalia. The passengers were freed and Schleyer's captors
killed him shortly afterwards.
Hofmann, 50, said the verdict ensured her ''extermination sentence
will be continued''. She had refused to take any part in what she
branded a ''show trial''.
Her 1982 sentence resulted from her membership of the RAF and the
attempted kidnapping of former Dresdner Bank chief Juergen Ponto, who
was later murdered.
Hofmann was arrested in France in 1980 and extradited to Germany to
stand trial for the attempted murder of Ponto.
The Paris appeal court ruled in June 1993 that she should also stand
trial in Germany for the killing of Schleyer, the attempted
assassination of Haig, and her alleged role in a 1977 rocket attack on
the German Federal Prosecutor's Office.
Formed in the early 1970s as the Baader-Meinhoff gang, the RAF waged a
war of assassinations and kidnappings, mainly against West German
politicians, industrialists, and military leaders. Hofman belonged to
the RAF inner circle.--Reuter/AP.

A CIVILIAN supervisor stoleprinting materials from the Fettes HQ of
Lothian and Borders Police and sold them on to another printer at a
large discount.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday, Martyn Campbell, 40, admitted
the theft from the police building in Fettes Avenue, Edinburgh, on
January 13, 1994. Campbell, of Woodfield Avenue, Edinburgh, worked there
as a #15,000-a-year civilian print room supervisor.
Depute fiscal Brian Robertson said poor stock control had allowed
Campbell, who was responsible for ordering print room materials, to
steal.
''The matter caused considerable embarrassment to the police.'' he
said.
Mr Robertson told Sheriff Annella Cowan that staff became suspicious
when they could not find a chemical, when 24 bottles of it had just been
delivered.
A printout from Campbell's computer turned out to be his invoice to
another printer for chemicals and printing plates worth #1315. There was
a discount of 60% and Campbell was paid #526.10 for the goods.
Mr Robertson said some of the property was recovered. Campbell was
sacked after his crime came to light but is taking the police to an
industrial tribunal.
Defence solicitor Brian Gilfedder said Campbell had been a diligent
and hard-working employee. Another printer was starting up his own
business and Campbell agreed to loan him materials.
The other man offered money and Campbell at first refused but later
agreed because he was hard up. ''He accepts that by doing that he
unlawfully appropriated materials which did not belong to him,'' said Mr
Gilfedder.
Sheriff Cowan deferred sentence for background reports until October
17.

Moscow
THE remains of Russia's last czar and his family, murdered by the
Bolsheviks in 1918, will be reburied next February in St Petersburg, the
city's mayor Anatoly Sobchak said today.
Sobchak told Interfax news agency that St Petersburg was chosen by a
special government committee of which he is vice-chairman. The choice is
thought certain to be endorsed by the full Russian parliament.
The remains of Czar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and three of
their five children were identified after DNA tests in Britain and the
United States. The bones of their son Alexei and of one of their three
daughters have not been found.
The remains were exhumed in 1992 from shallow graves in a forest near
Yekaterinburg, the Urals city where the family was killed by Bolsheviks
on July 17, 1918.
Sobchak said the commitee decided the reburial should take place in
the imperial family vault in the cathedral of the St Peter and Paul
Fortress on February 25, 1996, the Orthodox feast of Absolution.
He said the deciding factor for the commission was the view of
Russia's Patriarch Aleksii, head of the Orthodox Church, who favoured
reburial in St Petersburg.
Aleksii told the commission that reburial in Yekaterinburg would in
effect have meant prolonging the czar's exile into eternity.
The committee also rejected a proposal by the Russian Orthodox church
in exile to rebury the czar in Moscow in the Cathedral of Christ the
Saviour, now being rebuilt in the capital.
Sobchak said the remains would be transported back to the former
Imperial capital along the same route that Nicholas and his family
followed when they fled.-- Reuter.

CHRISTIAN Salvesen has teamed up with Tesco to run nine new recycling
and service depots for the supermarket giant, which will create 700 jobs
by next year, some of them in Livingston.
A mix of full and part-time jobs will be offered at the new centres,
one at Livingston, which will recycle 160,000 tonnes of cardboard and
10,000 tonnes of plastic clingfilm every year from Tesco's 527 stores.
The first unit at Middleton, Greater Manchester, will be opened
officially today by Environment Secretary John Gummer.
Tesco chairman, Sir Ian MacLaurin, said: ''The recycling service units
demonstrate in a very practical way our commitment to the environment.
''The scheme proves that it can make good business sense to be
environmentally sensitive.''
The other seven centres will be at Hinckley, Leicestershire, Harlow in
Essex, Snodland in Kent, Didcot in Oxfordshire, Chepstow, Doncaster, and
Southampton.
It is estimated that the new units, described by Tesco as the most
advanced in Europe, will save the company #12m a year.
As well as the recycling operation, a further 50,000 tonnes of
cardboard a year will be saved through the use of new plastic trays
which will be washed at the new centres before being collected for
re-use.
Meanwhile, almost 2000 new jobs are to be created at a holiday village
to be built by leisure giant Rank, it was announced yesterday.
The company began ground-clearing work at the site in Whinfell, near
Penrith, Cumbria, after receiving planning approval from the local
council.
Up to 1000 people will be involved in building the Oasis Holiday
Village over the next 18 months.
There will be 700 new jobs at the holiday centre when it opens in
mid-1997 and a further 260 jobs servicing the village.
Mr Angus Crichton-Miller, managing director of Rank's holiday
division, said he was delighted to get the go-ahead to build the
village, which aims to be an up-market holiday centre.
Rank is waiting for planning permission to build a second village in
Kent and hopes to have three operating by the year 2000.
''It will be a major boost for British tourism,'' said Mr
Crichton-Miller.
Rank has other major holiday businesses, including Butlin's, Warner,
and Shearings.
The new holiday village will cost up to #100m and will inject #15m a
year into the local economy.
It will offer high-quality facilities set in 370 acres of woodland and
will accommodate up to 3500 guests.

Los Angeles
WELCOME back to the O J Simpson circus.
A year after the jury selection process began, the double murder trial
entered its final phase today, attracting dozens more TV crews than in
recent weeks and a crowd of about 50 curious observers gathered in light
drizzle outside the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building.
Across the street in ''Camp O J'', TV trailers and satellites were set
up to beam details of the closing arguments all over the world.
Vendors selling teeshirts and bumper stickers were out in force, as
was Larry Mays, an evangelist with a banner announcing ''Ask Jesus to
save your soul'' and artist Rodney Vanworth inviting people to add their
own comments to his series of Simpson trial canvases.
At one point a shouting match broke out between Simpson supporters and
detractors, but security officers quickly moved in to prevent any
violence.
TV lights glared as lawyers entered the courthouse and cheers and
jeers rose as the crowd recognised some of the leading characters in the
trial.
''O J did not, could not, would not -- we believe in justice,'' said a
sign held by a black woman huddling under an umbrella with two children.
The reference was to Simpson's court statement on Friday in which he
reiterated his innocence in the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown
Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Another supporter of the former football star was an 80-year-old white
man wearing a straw hat and farming dungarees sporting cardboard signs
all over his body saying, ''100% not guilty''.
''O J has been framed,'' shouted Wesley Griswold. ''I got up before
the chickens this morning to come here. They finally accused a black man
who can defend himself,'' he said.
Across a rope divider, Larry Green was screaming at Simpson
supporters. ''God bless the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department) for
protecting us from the animals in this city.''
Green said he did not support ex-detective Mark Fuhrman, who testified
he found a bloody glove at Simpson's estate but later invoked his
constitutional right against self-incrimination to avoid being
questioned about racist statements he made in taped interviews with a
screenwriter.
''Fuhrman may be a racist but O J is a murderer,'' said Green, who is
white. ''You can't say anything critical about African-Americans without
being branded a racist.''
Linda Johnson-Phillips, a black woman who said she had attended 41
sessions of the trial in the handful of public seats allocated by
lottery daily, said: ''I have seen the jury every day and looked at
their faces, and they were so relieved last week when both sides ended
their cases. I think they will reach a verdict in 10 to 14 days.''
Law professor Peter Arenella commented that any doubt, not just
reasonable doubt, might be enough to free Simpson.
''If this were an ordinary homicide case involving the typical murder
defendant, the prosecution case would be a slam dunk for a conviction,''
Arenella said.
''The problem for the prosecution is this is not an ordinary murder
case. This is the O J Simpson case, and the standard of doubt might be
not just proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but proof beyond any doubt
given Simpson's public persona and the continued difficulty many people
have in believing Simpson could be capable of such a crime.''--Reuter.

A SOCIAL worker described yesterday how he listened to a suspect in
three murders tell police the gruesome details of the killings.
Mr Jonathan Eckersley was called to Ipswich police station, Suffolk,
on December 20 last year, to sit in on interviews with 24-year-old Jason
Mitchell, who had been arrested for strangling two pensioners and
butchering his own father a few days before.
''It was one of the most appalling accounts I have ever heard, one of
the most shocking things,'' Mr Eckersley told a public inquiry into
Mitchell's medical history.
He said Mitchell, who is detained at Rampton hospital after receiving
three life sentences at Ipswich Crown Court in July, was interviewed by
detectives about the deaths of Arthur and Shirley Wilson and his father,
Robert Mitchell, who were killed in the Suffolk village of Bramford.
''I was hearing about very horrific things. He described them in a
matter-of-fact way,'' said Mr Eckersley. ''There was no reference to any
sense of emotion, no evidence of guilt or remorse.''
A second social worker, Mr Robert Buxton, said he attended interviews
on December 21 when Mitchell became aggressive with psychiatrist Dr
Hadrian Ball and seemed to relish discussing the details of his crimes.
The inquiry, chaired by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, QC, at Bury St Edmunds,
is investigating the care and control given to Mitchell after he was
first detained in a mental hospital in 1990.
It is reviewing how he was able to present different views of his
mental state to doctors so that he was conditionally discharged back
into the community.
The inquiry was adjourned until today.

Washington
THE last stage of the O J Simpson trial finally arrived today, and
Judge Lance Ito picked a quarrel with the TV cameramen and banned them
from his courtroom.
After a final flurry of bad-tempered dispute between the lawyers, the
prosecutors started their final arguments, exactly a year after jury
selection began. The cameras were ordered out early in the afternoon,
ostensibly because a cameraman had filmed the defendant taking notes.
The judge claimed to fear that viewers could read the notes but
reporters speculated that he wanted TV excluded to speed things along.
Perhaps, at last, he had realised that the lawyers were playing to the
cameras, and thus prolonging the case. He may, of course, change his
mind tomorrow.
Before the TV mini-drama, Marcia Clark, the chief prosecutor, started
by thanking the jurors, who have been sequestered in a motel since
January. Judge Ito suggested last week that these last proceedings
should run all day and into the evening in hopes of finishing this week,
and the jury agreed enthusiastically.
The prosecution will take several days to cover all the ground, and
then the defence will have the final, lengthy word before the jury
retires to deliberate. The verdict is probably several weeks off.
Ms Clark called the evidence against the former football star
overwhelming. She reminded the jury that he had been an abusive husband,
and his murdered ex-wife, Nicole, had called the police twice for
protection.
Ms Clark described the main items of evidence against him, the
evidence of his house-guest, Kato Kaelin, who heard a mysterious bump in
the night, neighbours of Nicole Brown's who heard a hysterical dog
barking, and the gruesome sight of the two bodies.
She described how the police came to the scene and found the bodies of
Nicole and Ron Goldman. The unfortunate young man was a waiter at a
local restaurant and had dropped by Ms Brown's house to deliver a pair
of spectacles belonging to Ms Brown's mother that had been left in the
restaurant. Police also found a glove and ski mask there.
This was the first difficult passage: the defence is going to argue
that the policeman who allegedly found the glove in fact planted it
there, and later planted its pair at Simpson's house.
They will say that he is a racist who hated black men, especially
those married to white women.
The police went to Simpson's house, without waiting for a warrant, and
knocked up its occupants. Simpson had left for Chicago, carrying a
mysterious black bag that disappeared.
Kaelin showed where he had heard the thump on the side of the house,
and that is where the police found the other glove.
Later, they obtained a warrant and searched the house, discovering
traces of blood in the hall and on a pair of socks in Simpson's bedroom.
The defence will argue that they were all planted and that the blood on
the socks was planted in a police laboratory.
This is a crucial issue: DNA experts testified that Simpson's blood
was found at Nicole's house, and that his blood, mingled with Nicole's
and with Ron Goldman's, was found in his car, on the glove, and on the
socks, and also spattered on the driveway and in the hall of his house.
The prosecution will also claim that hair matching Simpson's was found
on the ski-mask, and traces of fibre from Goldman's shirt and from
Simpson's car, the famous Ford Bronco, were found mingled in Simpson's
house.

A MISTAKE by council officials has caused yet another delay in a new
ferry for the remote Atlantic island of Foula.
Shetland Islands Council admitted yesterday officials had not
advertised in the official journal of the European Union a contract to
fit out the new ferry, a necessity for such council tenders.
After more than five years' delay, during which the council spent
#400,000 on a new ferry which proved unsuitable for the rough seas
between Foula and the Shetland mainland, the 50 islanders were expecting
a boat of their own, based in Foula, next May.
A fibreglass hull had been bought from a Cornish shipyard and the
contract to fit it out was about to be awarded to an Orkney boatbuilder
when the omission was discovered.
Council chief executive Malcolm Green said it would have to be
re-advertised in the journal and go out to tender all over again. Mr
Green said the boat should be in service ''certainly by this time next
year'' and possibly as early as June 1996.
''An internal inquiry is in hand to find out why this mistake was made
and, more importantly, to learn from it and improve procedures
accordingly,'' Mr Green said.
The council has created a purpose-built harbour at Foula for the boat.
Meantime, the islanders are having to share with the island of Papa
Stour a ferry based at West Burrafirth on mainland Shetland.

<HEADLINE>Sting 'hired private detective to obtain theft confession'</HEADLINE>

ROCK singer Sting hired a private detective to obtain a taped
confession of theft from his accountant, a court heard yesterday.
Accountant Keith Moore is alleged to have abused the trust placed in
him by stealing #6m from Sting to fund a series of largely unsuccessful
speculative ventures and to twice stave off bankruptcy.
Mr Moore, of Stevenage Road, Fulham, south-west London, denies 15
sample counts of theft.
Sting told Southwark Crown Court yesterday that in 1992 his solicitor
had shown Mr Moore a document which listed the allegations and asked
whether he disagreed with anything in it.
''Mr Moore said: 'No, I couldn't','' Sting said.
Mr Nicholas Purnell, defending, countered: ''Far from getting an
admission from Mr Moore, all you ever got from him was his distress and
upset that he had let you down by investing the money and losing it.''
Mr Purnell continued: ''If he confessed, why was it necessary for you
to employ a private detective to try and get a taped interview?''
Sting: ''This was arranged before Mr Moore confessed. We had no
guarantee this would happen.'' He added that he had not known the
detective would masquerade as a solicitor or carry a hidden tape
recorder.
Mr Purnell: ''You sent someone else to do the dirty work for you.''
Sting: ''I faced Mr Moore with the allegations myself. It took a lot
of courage.''
Sting told the court Mr Moore had used his money to buy a #230,000
house at Earl's Court for his girlfriend.
However, Mr Purnell said: ''He had not bought it for his girlfriend at
all. It was rented out to a Scottish gentleman.''
Mr Purnell said Mr Moore's girlfriend had considered buying the house
but that the purchase had been made by one of Mr Moore's companies,
Gramelda Investments.
Sting denied that Mr Moore had raised the possibility of investing in
the house during a fireside chat at the singer's house.
Mr Purnell also said Sting had agreed to pay a #691,871 tax bill for
Mr Moore as a bonus for obtaining a #16m royalties settlement.
Mr Purnell said Sting made the offer at his beach house in Malibu,
California, in 1991, two days after his 40th birthday.
However, Sting said: ''Mr Moore was being paid very well, at least
#800,000 a year.
''I would not have thought I would have had to pay him a commission.
That was never suggested in all our years.''
Mr Purnell said Mr Moore had mentioned he was in difficulty with an
income tax bill and had suggested Sting might pay it if he wished to
show his appreciation.
Sting said: ''I'm a generous man but not that generous.''
The trial will continue today.

AN inventor from Perthshire has devised a new tool to detect at point
of sale the presence of forged banknotes. He says it will make the crime
of forgery more difficult. It could also mean that more innocent people
caught with forged notes in their possession will lose out.
Mr Gordon Scott, 56, from Inchture, claims his system is foolproof and
will easily allow anyone to spot counterfeit currency at a glance.
Forgers are now able to make banknotes which can deceive ultraviolet
light checks. They also use lacquered paper for fake notes so that
special pens do not leave a tell-tale dirty mark.
Mr Scott says the device he has developed will ''keep banks and shops
one step ahead of the forgers for many years''.
The security consultant came across the idea for the system when he
was inspecting counterfeit notes under a magnifying glass.
He explained: ''On a real banknote, the printing and colours have a
terrific clarity under magnification.
''But when I looked at a counterfeit note under the magnifying glass,
it looked all blotchy and smeared.''
Mr Scott contacted ACO Electronics in Hertfordshire with his
development and the firm has now turned his idea into reality. Already
100 of the devices have been manufactured.
The new note checker consists of a magnifying glass set above a panel
illuminated by a bulb, and cash can be quickly passed through.
Mr Scott said: ''The idea is that a cashier can check a note at a
glance. It is very easy to use. I think this is a real step forward.
''To get past this system, the forgers will have to get hold of real
paper and dramatically improve the quality of printing and colour.''
Mr Scott has kept in close contact with police while developing his
system.
Mr Stewart Ross, force information officer at Tayside Police, said:
''We have looked at the equipment and would always encourage endeavour
in this field.''

THE Labour leaders of the new City of Edinburgh Council were variously
described as ''high-handed'', ''undemocratic'', and ''Stalinist'' in
their approach by opposition councillors at a meeting of the council's
policy committee yesterday.
Insults flew as the Liberal Democrats claimed that the dates of
council meetings had been changed without proper notification to suit a
few leading Labour members.
The new council's chairman, Mr Eric Milligan, was called ''Stalinist''
after saying that he for one would be delighted to see policy committee
meetings (which actually give the opposition a better chance to question
officials) replaced by full council meetings if that was wanted.
Mr Donald Gorrie, Liberal Democrat leader, claimed that the Labour
leaders treated their own colleagues with contempt. ''But they are not
going to treat us or the Tories with contempt and get away with it,'' he
said. ''We will fight our corner on every possible occasion.''
But Labour councillors insisted that the meetings which had been
changed had been provisional dates only, and it would be a waste of
money to hold a full council meeting if the agenda was small.
They accused the opposition of trying to make political capital out of
the difficulties of reorganisation.
''It is much ado about nothing,'' said Labour's Councillor Brian
Fallon, who said the Tories had not consulted Labour when they were in
power.
The new chief executive, Mr Tom Aitchison, apologised for not ensuring
that councillors were individually notified about the substitution of
the policy committee meeting for a full council meeting.

A LABOUR MP launched a swingeing attack on Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth yesterday over the delay in publishing a report on a
schizophrenic killer.
Ayrshire MP George Foulkes said Mr Forsyth's failure to make public
the Mental Welfare Commission report into Philip McFadden, who killed
Strathclyde police constable Lewis Fulton, had led to a growing
suspicion that the Scottish Secretary had something to hide.
Last night, however, the accusation was rejected by Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State at the Scottish Office. Lord James
said Ministers accepted that the matter needed to be resolved quickly
and intended to make an announcement very soon.
The attack by Mr Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley,
comes at a time of growing concern at the breakdown of Care in the
Community because of lack of resources and failures in communication
between departments after the killing of Bryan Bennet by Stephen Laudat
in Newham, east London.
Former Scottish Secretary Ian Lang set up an inquiry at the request of
Mr Foulkes after he was approached by the policeman's parents, who live
at New Cumnock, Ayrshire.
Mr Foulkes said yesterday: ''I know the Mental Welfare Commission sent
the report to Michael Forsyth months ago and some weeks ago I wrote to
him asking that he publish it and let the family have copies in advance.
''He has been sitting on it for too long now and suspicions are
growing that he has something to hide. The report is ready and should be
published in full now along with the Secretary of State's response,
setting out what action he proposes to take.''
Mr Fulton was stabbed to death by Philip McFadden, a schizophrenic who
had been discharged from Gartnavel Hospital, when the policeman went to
help colleagues in Glasgow on June 17, 1994.
McFadden's mother, Mary, said at the time she had been worried about
her son's behaviour. However, she said her attempts to get help had been
ignored by the authorities.
In England, at least seven people have been killed in similar
circumstances over the past four years and fears are growing that the
supervised discharge, part of the policy of Care in the Community, is
breaking down, Mr Foulkes claimed.
He added: ''Unless the Government reviews this policy, fears must
remain that there could be further killings. Michael Forsyth must stop
his dithering on this now.
''Care in the Community is a sensible policy provided the necessary
resources are available and care is able to be taken in assessment of
each case.''
Lord James said last night: ''The Secretary of State asked the Mental
Welfare Commission to undertake to prepare a report into the care and
treatment of Philip McFadden, who was found insane in bar of trial for
the death of PC Fulton.
''Care should be taken when talking about Care in the Community or
making direct comparisons with cases in England. Bland assertions of
this kind are uninformed and unhelpful. Philip McFadden was not a Care
in the Community patient in June 1994.
''The department has been considering, with the commission, what
arrangements should be made for making the report available, taking into
account issues relating to patient confidentiality.
''I accept that this needs to be resolved quickly and intend to make
an announcement very shortly.''
* The Secretary of State wrote to the chairman of the Mental Welfare
Commission on October 27, 1994, inviting him to investigate the care and
treatment of McFadden, who had been found insane in bar of trial at the
High Court in Edinburgh on September 30, 1994. The commission undertook
the inquiry on November 7, 1994.

ELECTRICITY privatisation has cost the taxpayer #3000m, Labour's Trade
and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson claimed yesterday.
He said figures showed that in real terms the Exchequer had received
#3000m less in revenue since privatisation compared to the equivalent
period before the sell-off.
Ministerial claims that privatisation had benefited the taxpayer had,
he said, been ''blown apart''. Mr Wilson's claims refer only to England
and Wales, because Scottish figures are not yet available for analysis
on the same basis, but his comments will add to the row over plans for
''windfall'' taxation of public utilities.
Mr Wilson claimed that in the four financial years from 1987 to 1991,
when the electricity generators and regional electricity companies were
still in the public sector, their total collective contribution to the
Exchequer was #5998m.
However, in the corresponding period since privatisation, the total
tax yield from the industry has been just #3103m.
Mr Wilson described the figures as ''dynamite'' and promised an
on-going campaign to challenge Tory claims about the success of
privatisation.
He said: ''From the Prime Minister down, they constantly refer to the
inefficiency and loss-making of the utilities pre-privatisation. Nothing
could be further from the truth.''

LOCAL authorities in Scotland employ too many staff compared to their
counterparts in England, a Government Minister warned yesterday.
Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson said the move to
single-tier authorities offered councils a chance to put this right.
Figures published yesterday show that -- even taking account of
adjustments for changes of responsibility -- Scottish staffing levels
have risen for 10 successive years. By comparison, English councils are
making reductions.
The Joint Staffing Watch Survey shows that in June 1995 Scottish
councils employed 305,485 staff. This compares with 303,612 a year ago.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) said it did not
accept that direct comparisons between Scotland and England could be
made.
A spokeswoman said the latest figures reflected an increase in areas
where local authorities had taken on new responsibilities.
There was also a year-on-year rise of 1.5% in police services, an area
in which the Government was keen to see action.
Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth confirmed yesterday,
after consulting Cosla, that an independent Property Commission would be
set up to settle disputes between councils over property transfers
resulting from reorganisation.

The union sent a dictionary to his home. It arrived addressed to
Brandon Lee when Brian and his mother were out. As it was too big to go
through the letter box the postman left it with a neighbour.
Some friends I had made at school came looking for me. They met the
neighbour and asked if she knew where Brandon was. The neighbour replied
that she thought they were being hoodwinked.
A PACKAGE from Dundee University was the beginning of the end for
Brian MacKinnon's double life as a 17-year-old schoolboy. Having passed
himself off as Brandon Lee for a year at Bearsden Academy he believed
the most dangerous part of his ruse was over.
However, half way through mid-term he was at an anatomy lecture in the
university when members of the Medical and Dental Defence Union of
Scotland arrived to canvas students and offered a free medical
dictionary to all those who joined.
''There was a pile of dictionaries on the table,'' said Brian, ''but
not enough for everyone. I couldn't be bothered going down to get one,
there was a bit of a rush, but they said everyone who didn't would be
sent one.''
Brian gave no further thought to the dictionary, but true to its word
the union sent one to his home. It arrived addressed to Brandon Lee when
Brian and his mother were out. As it was too big to go through the
letter box, the postman left it with a neighbour.
''The neighbour came to the door with the parcel addressed to Brandon
and of course she didn't have a clue who Brandon was,'' added Brian.
''Shortly after some of the friends I had made at school came to the
door looking for me when we were out. They met the neighbour somehow and
asked if she knew where Brandon was.
''The neighbour replied that she thought they were being hoodwinked.
And said that my name was in fact Brian MacKinnon and I was in fact
25-years-old. At least this is how what she said was later reported to
me by the girls.
''I really don't know how the thing got out at first but I can only
imagine that the parcel and that conversation with my friends was the
catalyst for real gossip.''
As a result, one of Brian's friends later challenged him about his
identity. He recounted the conversation as reported to him and asked
Brian if it was true that he was not Brandon Lee. He denied it.
''I told him that I had a cousin called Brian MacKinnon and there must
have been confusion between the two of us.'' The explanation was
accepted on the surface but Brian believed that his friends knew.
''There seemed to be a tacit understanding that it was not a subject
we would cover again. But deep down I felt that they were aware I
foresaw the prospect of my being unable to keep the lid on things.''
Now that is all over and he can step back, Brian says although he has
regrets he can hold his head up high.
''Within myself I believe that I am fundamentally a sound and capable
individual. In so far as I am able I give my trust and goodwill to
everyone.
''Although I have experienced guilt pangs over the action that I felt
compelled to take -- the old rationale of the ends justifying the means
does not hold water -- I am nevertheless not entirely ashamed that I had
the gumption to try and overcome a gross injustice by standing on my own
two feet and not merely capitulating on my knees.''
These attempts at overcoming what he perceived as an injustice, had
taken him to Dundee University, where things started going wrong.
Brian's mother had decided she wanted a change of scene and would stay
with him while at university. They lived in a rented flat, changing
later to a hotel because it was not suitable.
However, costs were far greater than they had budgeted for and the
sale of some property did not go as smoothly as expected leaving them
drastically short of available funds.
''We couldn't afford to live there and pay the fees. It was
devastating but we had to come back to Glasgow,'' said Brian.
''I couldn't at this stage give up after all I had come through so I
wrote to the university telling them I had run out of money and also
saying my grandmother had died suddenly. I told them she had been paying
for the course but I was expecting some money from her estate, but that
would take some time and could I take a year out. The grandmother thing
was a lie but it was the only way I could think of to cover the
situation.''
Brian and his mother moved back to Bearsden and towards the final
incident which would result in his being unmasked. He had not entirely
lost touch with friends when at university and now back in Glasgow the
friendships continued in a casual fashion.
Most were away from school and Brian would occasionally be invited out
for a pizza or a movie. He always went with a group and there was never
any romantic relationships. The question of his identity was never
mentioned at this time.
In February 1995 he went to a party with the group and one of the
girls suggested that he join her and another girl on holiday in Tenerife
during the summer.
''I was aware they were much younger. This girl and I got on very well
despite our age difference, but I certainly had no romantic designs on
her, I thought it would be harmless and I didn't have any holiday plans.
On reflection I now realise that it was a monumental mistake on my part.
''But even then I foresaw the need for a restful few weeks before
returning to restart medicine at Dundee. I was living under considerable
strain.''
Brian's deception would have been impossible to hold together during
the complicated and legally exacting process of booking a holiday and
leaving the country. He did not attempt to travel as Brandon Lee.
When the holiday was booked he sat in the travel agents beside one of
the girls and gave his real name. He had become sufficiently confident
in the belief that his friends already knew the truth to allow him to
drop his guard.
''I only have one passport in my real name. I have never had two
passports. There was no way I could go on holiday unless I used my real
name. When I was in the travel agents I didn't make any fuss about it or
announce who I was with bravado. When I was asked I just quietly said my
name was Brian MacKinnon.''
Brian shared a flat on holiday with three girls in the Tenerife resort
of Playa de Las Americas. At first things went well. He didn't go to
clubs and contrary to press reports did not get involved in a bar
incident or arrested by the police.
''I was in a bar just once during the week I was in Tenerife, he said.
And I only had one drink. All this stuff about fights and arrests would
be laughable if it wasn't so distressing. It has taken a terrible toll
on my mother and not a single word of it is true.''
Things did go badly wrong, however, early on in the holiday. There had
been tension between Brian and one of the girls, not a close friend,
which was becoming hard for him to deal with. ''I don't know why but she
was giving me a really hard time.''
''It boiled over one night when they returned from dinner one night.
Some extremely boisterous English lads were staying in the room next
door and had come to borrow washing up liquid during the day.
''When the four friends returned to their flat they found it had been
foamed up and was all over the patio door in their room. The girls
became upset and wanted to go next door and remonstrate.''
Said Brian: ''I didn't want that to happen. These guys had been
drinking since they arrived and anything could have happened. I was
worried that they would have reacted violently. I stopped the girls
going to their room.
''I shouted, 'you mustn't do that, you must be crazy', there is no way
of knowing how these guys will react. They have been drinking. I did not
physically stop them, but it briefly became a real shouting match.
''During that one of the girls said 'act your age, I know I am', it
was clear to me what she meant. One of the girls became very upset and
she stormed off.''
The next day the atmosphere was tense and although Brian tried to make
the peace it was to no avail. ''I told them I was going for a walk but I
went to the travel agents and booked the first available flight home.
''I knew I had it as far as Brandon Lee was concerned. There was bad
feeling and I sensed my story was no longer held in trust.
''I came back from holiday on August 8 and two weeks later I received
a recorded delivery letter from the rector of Bearsden Academy asking me
if I could clear up a discrepancy in my records which might otherwise
affect my future in higher education. He wanted me to prove I was
Brandon Lee. I couldn't.''
Ironically Brian's ruse had come to an end just when it seemed he was
on the home straight. There had been no problems throughout Brian's
school year. It seemed to go fairly smoothly.
On reflection he feels his popularity was a by-product of the school
year but worthwhile. ''I was never trying to recreate my original
schooldays. I was popular enough the first time and got very good grades
but in fact I didn't really enjoy my last two years at school.
''Work moved slowly and I had been unable to do one of the subjects I
wanted to do. When I went back as Brandon Lee I wasn't trying to be
popular.''
Despite the success of the school year Brian did not jump for joy when
it was over. ''There was no feeling of elation as I finished school.
There was certainly a sense of happiness and relief. I'm not subject to
strong emotion, but the thing I wanted was starting to come closer.
''I had been for interview at Dundee towards the end of December 1993
and I didn't get accepted immediately, obviously I had to wait until my
higher results came out. The interview was nerve wracking but it went as
well as I could possibly have hoped.
''Higher results came out in August and I got five A's, but I knew
that was not the end of it because I had the whole Dundee thing to go
through.
''I had to be accepted, my feeling was that I would meet with an even
more intense astuteness and curiosity. That was my supposition and the
last thing that would have served me well was to become overly self
assured.
''In the summer I had a holiday in Canada and other holidays away with
a friend from outside the school. We went fishing. I think I also went
away with my mum, so much of the holiday was taken up with travel.
''By that time people from school had my phone number and I got the
occasional call. People would ask to go to a movie, always in groups of
people. While I was still in this mileau, my purpose was not to appear
as suddenly changed and become too conspicious by disappearing.
''I think that rationale was borne out later when I left the
university and people were knocking on my door. People are curious . . .
especially younger people. The way I acted towards people then without
keeping them entirely at arms length, not to make them suspicious. I
think my rationale was borne out.
''At Dundee University it was a bit easier, it was less of a trauma,
yes. Finally it seemed as though I was getting somewhere with what I
wanted to, whereas at school it seemed like I still had a precarious
mountain climb ahead of me. I never became complacent, there was most
certainly a risk at unie.
''And one of the other students whom I met in the queue to matriculate
said something about mature students which seemed to reflect that I was
one. Whether he sensed this from the way I appeared, spoke, or acted, I
don't know. Anyway I deflected the conversation on to something else.''

THE front runners for the post of chief constable of Strathclyde
emerged yesterday as Mr Barry Shaw, chief constable of Cleveland, and Mr
John Orr, the former Lockerbie detective and now assistant inspector of
constabulary for Scotland.
The announcement of the successor to Mr Leslie Sharp, who retires at
the end of the year, will be made on October 12 after interviews by a
committee from Strathclyde region police authority.
There are two other candidates in addition to Mr Orr and Mr Shaw -- Mr
Malcolm Cairns, 48, deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester Police,
and Mr William Nelson, 45, deputy chief constable of Hampshire
Constabulary.
In recent times, the police authority has favoured officers with
substantive rank for what is widely recognised as the top police job in
the UK after the commissionership of the Metropolitan Police.
Both Mr Orr and Mr Shaw have impeccable Strathclyde credentials and
both are policing high fliers. Mr John Orr's police career began as a
village bobby in Ayrshire in 1964 and it was from Ayrshire that he
joined the newly-formed Scottish Crime Squad in 1971, serving in Airdrie
and Glasgow. As a detective sergeant from 1976 he was involved in
serious crime investigation with Strathclyde Police serious crime squad.
His career as a detective took him to deputy head of the serious crime
squad, then head of the squad in 1984 and on to the post of CID chief in
Govan -- Glasgow's highest crime division -- where he took charge of a
large number of murder inquiries.
In 1987, as detective chief superintendent, he became joint head of
CID in Strathclyde. It was his name that emerged when, in the immediate
aftermath of the Lockerbie air disaster, it became apparent that the
police were dealing with the mass murder of 270 people.
In the following two years, he headed the team of officers who pieced
together the evidence that eventually led to indictments being drawn up
by the Crown and warrants for the arrest of two named Lybian agents.
In January, 1990, Mr Orr, now 50, was appointed deputy chief constable
of Dumfries and Galloway, the centre of the Lockerbie investigation, and
last year he was seconded as assistant inspector of constabulary for
Scotland at the Scottish Office.
His chief rival for the post, Mr Barry Shaw, 54, comes from
Manchester, serving in the Merchant Navy before joining the City of
Glasgow Police in 1965. As a sergeant in the old Marine Division, one of
his commands was of the famous Untouchables -- a specialist squad of
undercover Glasgow officers who tackled both street criminals and major
crime, becoming legendary in the process.
Mr Shaw was in charge in Partick and Drumchapel before becoming staff
officer to Chief Constable Sir Patrick Hamill. As a deputy divisional
commander at Motherwell he policed the miners' strike in 1983 and 1984
and as a chief superintendent he was in charge in both Greenock and
Glasgow city centre.
Mr Shaw is known to be fiercely proud of his background as a Glasgow
and Strathclyde officer and he is known to be held in high regard by
senior force members.
After leaving the force to go south as an assistant chief constable in
North Yorkshire in 1988, his rise to the top was meteoric. In 1993, he
became chief constable in Cleveland, where he has the reputation as a
moderniser with an open management style.
Both Mr Cairns and Mr Nelson are, according to informed sources,
long-odds outsiders for the #87,000 Strathclyde job.

THE SNP would not be forgiven by the people if they entered a devolved
parliament in a wrecking role, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George
Robertson, claimed yesterday as the Scottish Constitutional Convention
inched another step towards a final agreement.
Yesterday had been billed as the final meeting of the convention's
executive, but, although no fundamental of points of principle remain to
be resolved, it said there would have to be another round of discussions
before final details in wording were agreed.
Canon Kenyon Wright said that in nearing completion it was ''a time of
deep satisfaction -- the path is now clear''. He stressed that they were
was still on track to have a finished document by October 20 and a
public launch on St Andrew's Day of the scheme for home rule
On thorny issues such as the proposal to have 129 members in the
Scottish parliament, on its financial powers, and on the problem of
entrenchment, Canon Wright said there was full agreement in principle.
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said it had been a
''workmanlike'' meeting which brought the final document a step closer.
But the fact that the detail was not finalised made yesterday's news
conference a little flat. Canon Wright issued an invitation to ordinary
members and sympathisers of the SNP at least to look at the scheme that
was now on offer.
Mr Robertson made clear that as the scheme was near completion it was
too late for the SNP leadership to come on board anyway, but he issued a
challenge to Mr Alex Salmond to give an undertaking that his party would
not stand in elections to the devolved parliament merely to carry out a
wrecking role.
''They should declare that they will not use this parliament which we
have worked so painstakingly to create simply as a stepping stone to
their objective by wrecking it from the outset -- that this parliament
will not be used and abused by them to get what they cannot get at the
ballot box,'' said Mr Robertson.
''The SNP or the Liberal Democrats are entitled to persuade the people
to support their case of separatism or federalism, but not to use the
machinery of the new parliament to gain the outcome they cannot achieve
through elections.''
However, Mr Salmond ridiculed the idea that the nationalists should
suddenly start taking interest in a body that ruled out their specific
policy of independence in Europe. ''The Scottish people will be the ones
to decide and we will continue to put the case for independence at the
ballot box at every opportunity.
''George Robertson comes across in all this as a very conditional
democrat and I have been waiting for the best part of two months for
Tony Blair to endorse the concept of popular sovereignty as signed by
his members in the Claim of Right.''

Northern Ireland leaders' meetings with Major raise hopes for end to
stalemate in peace process.
HARD-LINE Unionist the Rev Ian Paisley and nationalist John Hume
emerged from separate talks with the Prime Minister yesterday,
encouraged that the stalemate in the Northern Ireland peace process can
be ended.
Mr Paisley, after a cordial 90 minutes at No 10, said: ''We had a
meeting that encouraged us. I am certainly encouraged. I think there is
progress that could be made on the basis of the democratic principle.''
Mr Hume, the SDLP leader, spoke of ''new ideas'' to be considered
after his hour-long meeting. Neither he nor No 10 was prepared to detail
them. All sides seemed reassured that the 13-month ceasefire is in no
immediate danger.
Mr Paisley, who has had stormy meetings with Mr Major earlier this
year, described this one as ''constructive''.
He was accompanied by fellow DUP MPs Peter Robinson and the Rev
William McCrea. They submitted that an elected ''convention'' be
established that would allow them at least to talk to Sinn Fein, if not
actually negotiate.
Mr David Trimble, the new Ulster Unionist leader, put a similar plan
to the Prime Minister when they met last week. Sinn Fein and the SDLP
are still resisting this, fearing that they would be in a minority in an
elected convention.
Mr Paisley said: ''The fact that the Prime Minister is prepared to
consider the proposals that we have put to him shows that the Prime
Minister realises that he has to go back to the people of Northern
Ireland and deal directly with elected representatives -- and not those
who put themselves forward on the strength that they have so much
Semtex, so many guns, and so much power to work mayhem in the
community.''
He added: ''If Sinn Fein was mandated, they would be in the assembly
just the same way as they are in the councils in Northern Ireland. If
you are asking me, 'Would we negotiate with them?' we would probably be
talking down to them rather than having a love-in.''
Mr Paisley and his colleagues listened to the Prime Minister for 25
minutes uninterrupted as he responded to their request to bring them up
to date. They were reassured by his determination that there could be no
all-party talks until the IRA had made a significant move to
decommission their weapons.
The meeting at No 10 took place as Home Secretary Michael Howard
announced that he would not allow a temporary transfer to prisons in
Northern Ireland of convicted IRA prisoners. Patrick Kelly and Michael
O'Brien are serving 43 years between them for attempted murder. Their
case for transfer had been carefully considered but they did not meet
the criteria.
Mr Hume also received an update of Mr Major's talks with the Irish
premier, Mr John Bruton, at the EU summit in Majorca last weekend.
''Some new ideas and proposals emerged and we are going to consider
them, and the Prime Minister is going to consider them as well. We have
no doubt after today's meeting of the Prime Minister's continued
commitment to the peace process and to keeping it very steadily on the
road.''
No 10 emphasised that talks with the democratic leaders in Ulster are
to continue but no date was set yesterday for further meetings. The
Prime Minister is encouraged by growing awareness in Dublin and
Washington that the IRA must be more positive about decommissioning of
weapons.
The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, emphasised in a
speech in New Zealand that the London-Dublin Framework for the Future is
not a blueprint for a united Ireland, merely one model for a
comprehensive political settlement.

THE modern-day battle for the political soul of William Wallace
continues, with Tories -- stung by the SNP's Braveheart campaign --
coming up with a new declaration in Arbroath which claims the
thirteenth-century hero as one of theirs.
Angus Conservatives have risen to the bait of the movie starring Mel
Gibson by handing out leaflets in Arbroath and Montrose. These do not
carry the chiselled features of the Australian movie star but carry a
message saying that the SNP are best suited to a Hollywood fantasy.
They then make a proclamation about the man who died in the cause of
independence which may startle some historians. Above the imprint of the
Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, the leaflet seeks to ''out''
him as a Tory, stating: ''William Wallace wanted real freedom and
opportunity -- the cornerstone of Conservative beliefs. A Unionist is a
Patriot.''
Mr Sandy Kydd, of Angus Conservatives, explained: ''We were evening up
the score by saying that Wallace was a patriot but so are Conservatives
and Unionists. We are as much proud of being Scots as anyone, only
within the Union.''
SNP chief executive Michael Russell was impressed by their initiative,
if not their historical veracity, saying: ''Trying to present William
Wallace as a Scottish Conservative and Unionist in a movie would have
resulted less in Braveheart than in one of the Carry On films.''
* Scottish Office Minister Raymond Robertson last night continued the
theme by using the motif to lambast the SNP's failure to come up with
figures on the cost of independence.
''Mr Salmond and his army have fled the field of battle whenever
challenged over the arithmetic of independence, preferring to fight fact
with falsehood,'' he told a meeting at Friockheim in Angus.
The SNP leader pointed out that they had published their statistics
earlier this month.

REPORTS of the death of Humphrey, the Cabinet Office cat, have been
greatly exaggerated.
No less a newspaper than The Times reported the feared demise of the
black-and-white tom, which had been missing from its usual haunts around
No 10, Whitehall, and St James's Park since June.
''Quite honestly, I think it was his kidneys and he just went away to
die,'' a Cabinet Office spokesman told the newspaper.
Not so.
Despite being overfed on Civil Service biscuits, a diet that may have
led to his kidney condition, Humphrey wandered further than normal and
found new friends at the Army Medical College at Millbank.
Policemen at the gate took to him and Humphrey rather liked them too.
They give him a new name -- PC Patrol Cat -- without suspecting that
this was the moggy that was once the prime suspect in the disappearance
of four robin chicks from a nest in a window box at No 10.
Not knowing his suspect criminal past, the policemen at the medical
college even took Humphrey to a vet for a medical.
While it is known that Prime Minister John Major was very fond of the
robin chicks in the nest outside his office, it was not at all clear
last night that he held similar affections for Humphrey.
The tom first appeared in the Cabinet Office in 1989, during the
tenure of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
A staff poll led to him being named after the Permanent Secretary in
the BBC comedy Yes Minister, said to be Lady Thatcher's favourite
television programme.
It was only after the obituary appeared in the diary column of The
Times yesterday that officers at the medical college realised their
stray was the infamous Humphrey.

Harold Petrie.
Mr Brian Parkinson, 28, of Fitby Road, Bedale, Yorkshire, and Mr David
Parkinson, 22, of Rae Circle, Inverurie, are charged with murdering
46-year-old Mr Petrie outside the Inverurie Loco works social club on
September 17.
Both are also charged with assault and robbery.
A third accused, Ms Joanne Langley, 24, also of Fitby Road, Bedale,
was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice and reset.
Depute-fiscal Mrs Sandra McRobert later said all three made no plea or
declaration and were committed for further examination.
Both men were remanded in custody and Ms Langley was released on bail.

THOUSANDS of Scottish students face delays in receiving their grants
this year as a result of a deluge in late applications for university
places.
The Student Awards Agency last night admitted that it had been
inundated by the sheer volume of paperwork. Temporary staff recruited to
meet the usual August peak had been retained.
''There is a backlog because there has been an absolute avalanche of
applications in September, but we are doing all we can to get through it
as quickly as possible,'' an SAA official said. She added that it was
not possible to put a figure on numbers involved.
Student leaders said the hold-ups were likely to cause financial
difficulties.
Mr Douglas Trainer, president of NUS Scotland, said: ''We are
concerned that there are some delays. Hardship is at record levels and I
would hope and expect that money will be with students as soon as
possible.''
Aberdeen University is among the worst sufferers, because of sickness
and staffing difficulties in the SAA section which deals with its
applications. Ron Bird, president of the students' representative
council there, said: ''This is a perennial problem, but it seems
particularly acute this year.
''We have had a continual line of students into the office to phone
about their grants. It has been constantly busy for the last two weeks.
They are very worried.''
The SAA spokeswoman said resources had been diverted to the section
dealing with Aberdeen to enable it to catch up.

Safety campaigners concerned at sentence of 240 hours' community
service for death crash driver.
A SPEEDING teenage driver who killed a woman on her way home with her
husband after they had collected their 13-year-old daughter from the
Guides has been sentenced to 240 hours of community service.
Mrs Jacalyn Nisbet, 37, was killed as her husband John and daughter
Ashley looked on.
Driver Gordon Todd spun out of control in his mother's Ford Fiesta and
ploughed into Mrs Nisbet, killing her almost instantly.
A doctor living nearby tried to help her but she died of head injuries
before she could be put into an ambulance.
Last night road safety campaigners said the sentence imposed on Mr
Todd should have been more severe.
Mrs Isobel Brydie, co-chairman of the Scottish Campaign Against
Irresponsible Drivers, said: ''In cases like this, where drivers are
found guilty of dangerous driving and at excessive speed, there should
be no other sentence than a heavy custodial one.''
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard yesterday that Todd was 17 at the time
and had passed his test two weeks before the accident on Edinburgh's
Maybury Drive on January 13.
Sheriff Charles Stoddart decided that, in all the circumstances, he
would not sentence Todd to detention and instead ordered him to do 240
hours of community service. He was also given a five-year driving ban
and ordered to resit his test.
There were no aggravating factors such as drink, or using the car
without permission, and the sheriff also felt that it was not true to
say that no sentence other than detention was appropriate.
''Nothing this court does can alleviate the tragedy which has happened
to the family of the victim,'' said Sheriff Stoddart.
Apprentice engineer Todd, now 18, had earlier admitted causing Mrs
Nisbet's death by driving dangerously and at excessive speed.
Witnesses estimated that he was driving along the wet stretch of road,
which has a 30mph limit, at up to 75mph when he lost control of the
1.6-litre fuel-injected car on a deceptively tricky bend and spun
through 270 degrees.
The car mounted a grass verge, hit a stone wall at about 50mph and
slid along until it hit Mrs Nisbet, who was on her way home after she
and her husband had collected their daughter Ashley from a Guides
meeting at the local church hall.
Todd, of Silverknowes View, Edinburgh, told police afterwards that he
had taken his foot off the accelerator as he approached the corner.
''As I was just coming into the bend my rear end slid away from me, I
turned into it to try to control it but I couldn't -- the car spun.''
Defence advocate Stephen MacGibbon produced testimonials to Todd's
character from Scout leaders, church elders, and his neighbours.
He said that Todd bore the ''awful responsibility'' of being to blame
for the death of another human being.
''I am only too conscious that he has pleaded guilty to driving
dangerously in such a way as to cause the death of a young mother in
appalling circumstances,'' said Mr MacGibbon.
He added that Todd had not had time to learn from his mistakes as a
driver when the tragedy, which sharply highlighted his youth and driving
inexperience, occurred.
''He did what silly young men have done and will continue to do, he
drove the car far faster than it should have been in the circumstances
and far faster than his experience merited.''
Although he accepted that the accident was caused by a ''few seconds
of lunatic speed'', Mr MacGibbon said that estimates of 70-75mph were
perhaps too high.
He told the sheriff that the testimonials painted a picture of a
''shy, conscientious, and caring'' young man whose irresponsibility in
driving the car the way he did was out of character.
''Mr Todd has punished and will continue to punish himself. He has to
live with the consequences of what he has done.''
Sheriff Stoddart said that the case was far removed from ones where
drivers had been drinking or were in stolen cars.
He also said that he also took into account Todd's age, lack of
previous convictions, and previous good character.
Mrs Brydie, after hearing details of the court case, added: ''In this
case, as in others which cause death, I believe a custodial sentence was
required.
''The case also highlights the problems with the present driving test.
Here we have a young man who passed his driving test only a few weeks
previously doing up to no doubt around 30mph during that test.
''He then gets on to the open road and is not used to higher speeds,
which are commonplace in high-performance cars nowadays.
''There is a 10-year custodial sentence available to courts in cases
like this and I believe the only right sentence is a custodial one.
People who stab or shoot people would not be given 240 hours of
community service.''
Mr John Nisbet, the husband of Jacalyn Nisbet, said last night: ''I
have only got one thing on my mind and that is the death of my wife.
''I have heard of the verdict. I am much too upset to speak about
anything at the moment. I just want to be left alone.''
Todd's father, Mr Jim Todd, last night expressed his sympathy for the
family of Mrs Nisbet. Mr Todd said: ''We feel for the family and about
what has happened. My son and all of us are very, very upset at it.''

IF every police officer in the Northern Constabulary was deployed to
fight drug abuse in the Highlands and Islands they still could not
defeat it because of the extent of the problem, Chief Constable Hugh
MacMillan claimed yesterday.
Mr MacMillan reported to the Joint Northern Police Committee that
there had been a 26.7% increase for drug-related arrests for January to
July compared to the same period last year.
After the meeting he said that an inter-agency approach was now
needed: ''If I devoted my whole force to nothing but drugs
investigations, I would still have a problem . . . It is not something I
can tackle as a police chief on my own. It has to be the whole community
without exception.
''I am speaking about social services, I am speaking about the health
board, I am speaking about education: community councils, district
councils, and the police committee. Everybody has got to be involved.
''At the moment what we are attempting to do is to come together as a
group of educationists, social workers, police and decide methods
whereby we can educate, deter, help those already on drugs and also to
detect and arrest.''
According to Mr MacMillan's report the biggest problem is in the
Inverness and Nairn command area where there there were 334 arrests in
the whole of 1994 and 217 for the first six months of this year. Ross,
Cromarty and Skye area, meanwhile, made 181 drug-related arrests last
year and 110 in the same period, with Lochaber not far behind with 150
and 57 respectively.
Shetland and the Western Isles had comparable rates of arrests with 72
in Shetland last year and 41 in the first half of 1995, while in the
Western Isles the figures were 63 and 37.
Orkney did not report the same level of problem in 1994 with just 16
arrests for the whole year, but the problem there appears to be
worsening with 25 arrests between January and July this year.

THE Scots doctor leading the Aids drug tests which have brought new
hope to HIV patients said yesterday that even bigger drug cocktails were
on the way.
The results of the Delta trials -- which showed that combination drugs
could reduce death rates by 38% -- were described as stunning by
Professor Alasdair Breckenridge, chairman of the co-ordinating
committee.
The improvement emerged among patients given the first specific Aids
drug, AZT, in combination with either of two other drugs, compared with
those given AZT alone; although they will not cure Aids, these cocktails
are expected to prolong life and delay progression to full-blown Aids.
Now the Quattro trial, which began last month, is to look at
combinations of three or four drugs, said the Fife-born professor, who
qualified in medicine at St Andrews in 1964 and has worked in Dundee and
at Hammersmith Hospital. He is now Professor of Clinical Pharmacology at
Liverpool University.
''If two drugs are better than one, it is only logical to look at
whether three or even four drugs are better than two,'' he said.
The Delta trials, which started in 1992, involved more than 3000
people with HIV in Europe and Australia. Four Scottish Aids centres took
part.
They were randomly assigned one of three different treatments -- AZT
alone, or with didanosine (ddI) or with zalcitabine (ddC) -- all similar
drugs that attack the virus's ability to work and replicate itself.
Of the patients who had never taken AZT before, 17% who took AZT alone
died in the course of the trial, compared with 10% who took AZT with ddI
and 12% who took AZT with ddC.
The trial showed that patients in all categories who had received AZT
alone in the past fared worse than those who had not -- including those
who were assigned in the trial to receive AZT alone.
''This demonstrates that resistance to the drug develops if it is
given alone,'' said Professor Breckenridge. ''Giving a combination keeps
the virus on the hop and delays resistance.
''Aids patients' groups are already aware of this and have been given
a briefing on the findings. They will be voting with their feet in
favour of combination therapy.''
As a result, it was going to be difficult to sustain giving AZT alone
to patients but this was not bad news for makers Glaxo-Wellcome, which
market it under the brand name Retrovir.
''The trial has shown it to have a valuable role as part of multiple
therapy,'' said Professor Breckenridge. ''It has strengthened AZT's
position -- you just have to look at Glaxo-Wellcome's share price
today.''
The price jumped nearly 2% before stabilising up 10p, 1.3% above
Monday's close, at 751p.
At present, the three drugs are not licensed to be used in multiple
therapy and the drug companies -- the other two drugs are made by
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche -- will have to apply for licences.
However, Professor Breckenridge said: ''Many doctors will already have
added one and one together and have started prescribing it -- now they
have the clinical data to support them.
''This is a huge boost for clinical trials and a huge benefit to
people with Aids. To get a 38% difference betwen two groups is quite
stunning. It is a very remarkable difference in as big a trial as
this.''

A PART of Scottish history, exiled south of the Border for almost a
decade after being banned by football bosses, is set to return and take
pride of place in a planned museum at Hampden Park.
The famous Hampden square goalposts are earmarked to take pride of
place in the museum when the south stand at the national stadium is
redeveloped.
Until then, they will be sited at a football mini-exhibition being set
up at the Transport Museum in Glasgow.
The current owner of the goalposts, Maryhill-born publican Bill
Campbell, who runs The Cross Inn at Kinver in the West Midlands, is
delighted they will be returned.
Mr Campbell, 48, bought the goalposts, stanchions, and nets for #6200,
when they came up for auction eight years ago, on behalf of a syndicate
of business people.
Yesterday, he said: ''They should never have left Scotland in the
first place. I am delighted they are going back.
''I originally bought them to stop them falling into the wrong hands.
There were people who wanted to break them up into ornaments. But they
are a very important part of Scottish football history and should be
kept as such.''
The square posts were installed at Hampden in 1903 and were there
until 1987, when they were outlawed by international football
authorities.
During the 84 years they were on site, they saw 288 international
goals as well as countless other scores in cup final and European
matches.
Until two years ago, the football posts graced the roof of Bill's
former pub The Farmers Boy, in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and
brought him dozens of curious customers. Scottish football great Denis
Law, who put a few goals between them, even took time to visit the pub.
Mr Richard Williams, assistant curator of the planned museum, said:
''Naturally we are over the moon that Mr Campbell is allowing us to have
the posts on loan and hopefully we will be able to buy them in the
future and make them part of the display at a permanent museum.''
Along with his boss, Mr Ged O'Brien, Mr Williams, from Merthyr Tydfil,
Wales, will scour the country seeking out football memorabilia. They
already have more than #200,000 in funding from Glasgow City Council,
the GDA, the SFA, and Strathclyde European Partnership.
Mr O'Brien is hoping the museum at Hampden will cover 57,000sq ft and
have 10,000sq ft of storage space.
He said: ''This will be the first national football museum in the
world. We are certainly ahead of the game and there is no doubt Glasgow
is the number-one city in the world in terms of football history.''

A SCHEME to transfer almost #3000m worth of water and sewerage assets
to a new Government-appointed quango was approved by Strathclyde
councillors yesterday amid accusations of betrayal and cowardice from
demonstrators.
Labour councillors, who had asked for an additional week to consider
the voluminous documentation after a mix up over last Tuesday's deadline
for submission to the Scottish Office, were at pains to point out that
they had built in conditions which they hoped would safeguard the assets
until the return of a Labour Government.
They warned Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, that any move to
privatise water and sewerage services, including the introduction of
build, own, and operate schemes (BOOs), would be challenged by means of
judicial review.
Militant Labour district councillor, Tommy Sheridan, rebuked the
Labour administration for its lack of backbone.
He claimed yesterday: ''They were worried about being surcharged
something like #100,000 for the whole council. If they are not willing
to risk that kind of surcharge then they should be standing aside and
letting in people who will.
''Labour councillors were uncomfortable with their decision today
because I feel they are betraying the trust people invested in them at
the last election, particularly given the massive ''no'' vote in the
water referendum.''
However, Strathclyde is proud of the fact that, alone amongst the
water authorities, it refused to let Government-appointed private
consultants into the region to draw up the transfer scheme.
This had allowed the council to prepare a scheme which sought to
protect the interests of the people of the region until the assets could
be brought back into council control.
The scheme could prevent any sales of land to developers and protect
public access and fishing rights.
Should the Secretary of State wish to amend the scheme, he would have
to consult Strathclyde.
Councillor Des McNulty who has been fronting Strathclyde's campaign to
keep water services under council control, explained: ''Legislation is
forcing us to transfer the assets at this time. But we are trying to
make sure that these assets are going to come back into public control
as soon as the Government is chucked out.''
Earlier, at a water service committee meeting, Liberal Democrat leader
Christopher Mason said an approach should be made to opposition MP's
urging them to have any BOOs cancelled if possible.
He said he was also at a loss to understand why the West Water
Authority had been granted accommodation in the council's water services
headquarters in Balmore Road, Glasgow.

AN industrial tribunal heard yesterday how a council repair job ''went
out of control'' and trebled from the original contract price to almost
#1m.
The chief executive of Lochaber District Council at the time, Mr David
Blair, was sacked after councillors learned of the overspend. He is now
seeking reinstatement.
The council chairman, Councillor Neil Clark, told the hearing in
Glasgow there had been problems with Swedish timber houses in Caol. It
was originally estimated that it would cost #300,000 to repair them but
the final bill was nearly #1m.
He said the matter came to light after the publication of an internal
auditor's reports dealing with various contracts with which the council
had been involved.
Asked whether he had seen the reports, Mr Clark said: ''Eventually. It
transpired that the chief executive felt that these audited reports were
not for the sight of councillors, that they were private and
confidential.''
Mr Clark, asked how he had come to hear of them, replied: ''I was
contacted by the director of finance in October 1993 expressing concern
that his report had not been put to the council.''
The finance director had reported: ''Officers have failed to carry out
instructions, failed to report changes or alterations in contract work
and costs, and failed to ensure guidelines and controls were adhered to.
''However, it must be taken into account that they were working under
constraints of time and political pressure to achieve their objectives.
''This is the third time that I have reported on a capital contract.
On each occasion, there has been a pattern of council instructions not
being followed and financial regulations disregarded due to apparent
pressure to spend money by a certain time and to involvement of
members.''
The finance director added: ''If the internal audit reports had been
considered more promptly, it might have been possible to recover some of
the alleged overpayments.
''Members failed to take sufficiently close interest in the limited
monitoring information supplied to them.
''A closer interest, more persistent questioning, and continuing
demands for better quality, timeous information would have helped to
ensure that members received sufficient information to carry out their
duty as custodians of the public purse.''
The finance director also referred to a tenants' meeting in Caol in
October 1989, when councillors agreed to redecoration costs which
eventually rose to #99,268 for 55 properties and noted that council
approval was never given for the expenditure.
Mr Clark told the tribunal that the council set up an investigation
sub-committee to look at the various reports.
It found that on the Swedish house repair contract at Caol the final
account totalled #942,000 which was an excess of #672,159 of the sum in
the capital programme for the project.
Councillor Mackin, the member for the area of the house contract from
1974 to 1984, told the disciplinary hearing he thought it would have
been better ''to knock the houses down and start again''.
He added that Mr Blair could not be blamed for the increased costs as
''everyone wanted their houses done properly''.
The tribunal continues today.

A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD schoolboy has been found dead at his Borders home
after being excluded from school amid allegations of drug possession.
The body of Peebles High School pupil Alistair Lambert was found at
his parents' home in High Cottages, Walkerburn, late on Monday.
His parents, Peter and Brenda Lambert, who have two older sons at the
school, David and Ross, were too upset yesterday to talk about the
events.
An official of Lothian and Borders Police confirmed that the boy had
been found dead. She added: ''There are no suspicious circumstances. A
report is being prepared for the procurator-fiscal at Peebles.''
The drugs allegations are still thought to be under investigation.
Alistair's death was the second tragedy to affect the first-year class
this term. David Dunlop, 12, was killed with his father a few weeks ago.
Their car was engulfed in flames after a collision near Lanark.
Yesterday, chaplains were on hand at Peebles High School, where
Alistair had been attending for only a few weeks, to comfort distraught
pupils and staff.
The rector, Dr Rob Kerr said: ''Our first reaction is numbing shock
followed by deep sadness at the loss of a young life. Our thoughts are
with Mr and Mrs Lambert and Alistair's two brothers at the school.''
He revealed that the boy had been excluded on Thursday after police
were called to the school over a claim of drugs possession.
A meeting was due to have taken place between staff and Alistair's
parents later this week over his return to school.
Dr Kerr said that the 1000-pupil school had a strict policy of
automatic temporary exclusion in any case that involved drug
allegations.
''There has been no other drug-related exclusion here for over two
years but we are actively aware of a wider problem and pupils attend
drug awareness sessions at regular stages of their school career. As
Alistair had only been here a few weeks, he would not yet have attended
one,'' he added.
Borders' director of education, Mr Ian Dutton, said the department was
in ''a state of shock'' over the schoolboy's death.
''I can confirm there was an incident at Peebles High School last
Thursday in which there was a suspicion that some illegal substances had
been brought into the school by a pupil. The police were asked to
investigate by the school.
''The school temporarily excluded the pupil. He was sent home and a
letter was sent to his parents where they were asked to visit the school
to discuss under what circumstances he would be reinstated.''
Mr Dutton denied that there was a problem with drugs among
schoolchildren in the region.
''They're not a major problem but we are not complacent about it. We
have a health education programme which provides a course of instruction
in warning pupils of the nature of and the dangers of taking drugs.''
The Rev John Wilson, who is a minister in Walkerburn and chaplain of
Walkerburn primary where Alistair and his brothers were pupils, said he
had been comforting the boy's friends and family.
''He had just left Walkerburn primary. I went down to see staff and
pupils who knew him from last year and spoke to them. I went up to
Peebles High School and I have been speaking to children up there who
wanted to speak to me.
''There has been a lot of shock about this tragedy. I saw his parents
this morning and I'll be going back to see them tonight. They are very
distressed.''
He said that Alistair ''was a wee laddie who liked attention and
sought attention''.

THE organisers of next year's Burns International Festival have been
accused of depriving 150 of Ayrshire's most talented young performers
from playing their part in the programme of events.
The attack has come from one of the area's most respected arts
promoters and follows widespread criticism of the organisation of the
festival which is being staged to commemorate the bicentenary of the
death of Robert Burns.
It will cast a shadow over today's events at which details of the
programme and sponsorship are to be announced and the Princess Royal
will unveil a statue of Burns in Kilmarnock.
A briefing will be given today by festival director John Struthers and
chairman Eric Rowe on what stage the widely criticised festival has
reached.
It is understood that major sponsorship is likely to come from United
Distillers and Scottish Power and that major international stars will
join local performers and groups in a programme of events beginning at
the turn of the year and reaching a climax next July on the anniversary
of his death.
Ms Marilyn De Blieck, director of operations with Strathclyde Opera
Theatre Trust, claims she was ''led up the garden path'' over proposals
to stage a new musical theatre production of Tam O'Shanter.
The trust operates the professional Opera West company and also
Ayrshire Voices which is a vehicle for local young singing and
performing talent.
Although the work has been commissioned and is nearing completion by
composer Michael Norris, the Burns International Festival company has
made it clear that there will be no funds made available for it to be
staged.
Ms De Blieck said: ''We are angry and disappointed and quite frankly
at a loss to understand what the festival is going to be about. Our
production of Tam O'Shanter appeared ideal in that it would celebrate
one of Burns's most famous works and would involve local young people in
the production.''
Mr Struthers said he had made every effort to get funding for some of
the events put forward by the trust but that his board had chosen not to
give its backing.

CAMPAIGNERS against the #250m M74 extension will be invited to have
their say at a council planning inquiry on October 11. However, one
campaigner has already described the invitation as ''totally
inadequate''.
Glasgow councillor Ron Davey, chairman of the development control
committee, said: ''We are anxious that everyone is given a fair
opportunity to put forward their views.''
A large-scale floor model of the road route is being prepared.
''Hopefully, by referring to the model, it will not be necessary for any
of the committee members to actually leave the inquiry to visit the
scene,'' Mr Davey said.
There are two petitions and 600 letters from individual objectors. The
road will mean the demolition of 27 houses, two churches, a social club,
and 99 commercial and industrial premises. The five-mile stretch will
link the present M74 near Cambuslang with the southern approaches of the
Kingston Bridge.
Mr Rab Fulton, of the No M74 campaign, yesterday criticised
councillors for not accepting a move for a site inspection. ''We feel
the hearing is totally inadequate, because not everyone affected by this
will get a chance to attend,'' he said. ''We will organise our own site
inspections at Tollcross, Rutherglen, and Govanhill and will invite the
councillors to come along.''
* Six consortia are to take part in a competition to complete the
upgrading of the A74 to motorway standard. The project is the first of
its kind in Scotland based on the Government's Private Finance
Initiative. The successful consortium will design, build, finance, and
operate the road for between 25 and 30 years in exchange for payments
from the Government.

* One of the first victims of British Rail's ill-fated winter
timetable was Junior Health Minister Tom Sackville. He arrived at
Paddington on Monday morning, the first day of the new timings, to find
that the 08.45 Cheltenham Spa Express had been rescheduled to leave
London at 08.40. The change had not been included in the new timetable.
Mr Sackville jumped back in his ministerial car and ordered his driver
to take him the 110 miles to Gloucester, where he was due to open the
new HQ of the Community Health Council. A civil servant among the
welcoming party said that an ''angry letter'' was on its way to
Railtrack. A Department of Health spokesman said: ''Mr Sackville will be
writing to complain that he missed his train. The correct time was not
advertised.''

A BUS driver was recovering yesterday after being hit in the face by a
bottle while at the wheel of his double-decker.
Mr Craig Clarkson lost control of the 31A Lothian Region Transport
bus, which was carrying six passengers, after the bottle smashed through
the passenger door at the foot of Liberton Brae on Monday night.
Mr Clarkson, 31, of Livingston, swerved on to the other side of the
road before coming to a halt near the pavement. A second bus travelling
in the opposite direction had to brake sharply to avoid a crash.
A spokesman for Lothian Region Transport said: ''The people concerned
must be totally mindless and quite unable to see the possible
consequences of their action. It was absolutely deplorable.''
He said he did not know when the injured man would be fit for duty.
Mr Clarkson was treated for cuts to his face, head, and neck at
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and later discharged.
Police are seeking three youths seen running away from the scene,
including one wearing a fawn jacket. They are also seeking a cyclist
seen in the area at the time.
A spokesman said the incident could have proved more serious.

A FRESH legal challenge which, if successful, could delay and possibly
halt rail privatisation until after the next General Election was
unveiled yesterday by the Save Our Railways campaign.
The pressure group -- which includes the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities, the rail unions, the Railway Development Society, and
Transport 2000 -- is seeking a judicial review of the rail franchise
director's alleged failure to produce criteria for determining service
cuts.
It has been advised that the franchise director, Mr Roger Salmon, is
obliged by law to set down criteria before deciding upon Passenger
Service Requirements, and declared that it is confident that an initial
High Court hearing in late October or early November will open the way
for a full judicial review over the cutbacks he has proposed.
The case, which is being funded by the unions and an increasing number
of local authorities, is based initially on cuts envisaged throughout
the first three franchise areas: Great Western Inter City; London,
Tilbury and Southend, and South West Trains.
Save Our Railways co-ordinator, Mr Jonathan Bray, stressed yesterday
that similar action was in the pipeline for the second tranche of
franchises including the East Coast Main Line.
If successful, the legal move could force Mr Salmon to abort
privatisation moves pending drawing up of the necessary criteria after
which the process of tendering for rail franchises would probably need
to be restarted from scratch causing the privatisation timetable to
''collapse altogether''.
Speaking at the relaunch of the campaign in London yesterday Mr Jimmy
Knapp, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime, and Transport union,
said the Government's problems were mounting steadily, privatisation was
''on the ropes'', and the campaign aimed to deliver the knockout blow.

THE InterCity East Coast rail line was put up for sale yesterday,
setting off a scramble for some of the richest pickings available under
the Government's privatisation programme.
Among those interested in the flagship Anglo-Scottish route is London
and Continental Railways, which includes Richard Branson's Virgin Group.
It is already bidding to build the #3000m Channel Tunnel rail link.
Other interested parties are understood to include bus companies and
sea container firms.
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, called for the ''free
for all'' sale to be scrapped in the interests of commuters and
Scotland.
London and Continental Railways confirmed it was interested in
InterCity East Coast, whose passenger revenue last year topped #205m,
plus Midland Main Line.
LCR is also believed to be interested in bidding for the West Coast
main line from London Euston to Glasgow Central, which needs #1000m for
upgrading. The line's sale, however, was postponed indefinitely last
month.
Depending on the bidding outcomes, LCR could become the biggest rail
operator in the country, controlling main northern trunk routes out of
London. It has six shareholders -- US construction group Bechtel;
consulting engineers Ove Arup; tunnelling experts Halcrow; National
Express coach operators; bankers SBC Warburg; and Virgin. It is advised
by London Electric and by the consulting arm of the French national
railway, SNCF.
The consortium will face a strong challenge from InterCity East Coast,
whose managing director, Mr Brian Burdsall, announced that a
management-employee bid would be lodged.
Mr Burdsall, who has 2900 employees -- including 660 in Scotland --
has been working on detailed plans for around 18 months. He is confident
of victory because ''the people who operate InterCity East Coast today
are the best people to do so in the future''.
He insisted that nobody new to the business could take it forward as
well as his staff and spoke of a vision to make East Coast the finest
long-haul travel experience in Britain.
The Government also invited tenders for the Gatwick Express, Midland
Main Line, and Network SouthCentral.
The latest wave of sales was described as a ''grim moment'' by Labour
and was greeted with a legal challenge by anti-privatisation
campaigners.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher warned that up to 20,000
jobs could be lost across the rail industry in the next two years as
operators cut costs in search of profits.
He said Labour was hopeful of preventing most of the industry being
sold off ''before we enter government'', and added: ''We remain
absolutely committed to a publicly owned, publicly accountable railway.
If the Tories succeed in destroying it, we will then recreate it during
the lifetime of that Labour government.''
Mr McLeish said he could not understand why the Government was
pressing ahead with sales: ''The Tories cannot even print a proper
timetable, never mind sell the railway, and it would be better for all
of us if the sale was halted immediately.''
Transport Secretary Sir George Young said rail franchising was
gathering increasing momentum, and added that the second wave of
invitations to tender meant that ''over 40% of the network in passenger
revenue terms is now on offer to the private sector''.
Mr Murray Hughes, editor of Railway Gazette International, said the
Government appeared to have moved the goalposts in its previously stated
privatisation time-scale.

SCOTS were warned yesterday that anti-English prejudice could damage
the tourism industry.
In a hard-hitting speech at the Scottish Tourism Oscars, Mr Alistair
Mair, chairman and managing director of Caithness Glass, criticised pub
patrons who aggressively supported England's opposition during the Rugby
World Cup.
Drunken lager louts who roamed deserted town centres were also the
focus of a speech which pointed out that the tourism industry was under
tough attack in a market place where more people were taking cheap
foreign flights.
Also, many middle-ranking hotels were not offering value for money and
were found to be lacking in courteous service.
As an example, Mr Mair, chairman of the Oscars judging panel, said
that during the judges' tour he was refused a boiled egg for breakfast
in his room in a hotel; he did not name it.
Speaking at the Turnberry Hotel, Ayrshire, Mr Mair said: ''I have a
niggling but growing concern about another faction which is working
against tourism in Scotland, particularly in regard to our main market
in England and that is an element of anti-English sentiment . . .
''The attitude appearing in pubs and elsewhere during the Rugby World
Cup when Scots were aggressively supporting any team England were
playing against, can also be off-putting for visitors.
''While the tourist industry, the STB, and various other agencies can
promote Scotland all over the world, the problems of lager louts and
anti-English prejudice are the responsibilities of everyone, and
particularly the political parties jockeying for position in the run-up
to the next election.''
Mr Mair praised the work of many non-Scots who had brought spark,
drive, and enterprise to improve the service in situations where native
Scots had been less active.
He said: ''They may be incomers but they are not white settlers and
they have brought significant strengths to the Scottish tourism industry
which should be much encouraged.''
He praised the imaginative work of the Scottish Tourist Board for the
success of this year's summer season, which was greatly helped by the
good weather.
He commended its ability to raise standards, publicise activities, and
generally remarket Scotland's summer attractions.
The Scottish Tourism Oscars are sponsored by Caithness Glass, Grampian
Television, and The Herald. The winners, who received their awards of
Caithness glass, were Best Tourism Town -- Largs; Best Tourism Village
-- Ballater; Best Tourist Attraction -- Oban Rare Breeds Farm Park; Best
On-The-Water Attraction -- Loch Insh Watersports Centre; Most Glorious
Garden -- Crathes; Best New Tourist Attraction -- Mount Stuart, Bute.

STIRLING County's big day against the Barbarians at the town's
Forthbank Stadium yesterday came by Royal Appointment.
Scottish Rugby Union patron, the Princess Royal, was a spectator at
the showpiece game but she had family business to attend to as well.
Her son, Peter Phillips, captained the Gordonstoun School side to a
convincing 29-11 win over County Colts in a taster for the main event.
And Peter, who sported an all-enveloping scrum-cap, rounded off the
school side's victory with a try of his own.
Young Master Phillips is an avid rugby enthusiast and one of his most
prized possessions is the shirt worn by Scotland captain David Sole
during the Grand Slam victory over England in 1990.
The Scotland players had invited the youngster into their dressing
room after the game when Sole made the impromptu presentation of the
muddy and bloody shirt.
Yesterday, the princess also attended the 25th anniversary
celebrations of the Fife Institute of Physical and Recreational
Education. She was asked along because she had officially opened the
institute in Glenrothes in Fife in the early 1970s.
Nearly 13 million people have visited the centre, run by Fife Regional
Council, since it was opened.

EXCLUSIVE
BRIAN MacKinnon found out last month that the ''Brandon Lee''
character he had created to satisfy his burning ambition to become a
doctor was about to be exposed at the very institution he believed would
help him serve his purpose.
He told The Herald yesterday how the realisation that his dream was
about to be shattered because of stricter admissions procedures at
Dundee University sent him into panic. ''I found myself unable to act in
any direction,'' he revealed.
He also studied medicine at Glasgow University in the early 1980s and
claimed that the institution had treated him badly when it refused to
take him back after he had repeated a year and failed all but one of his
second year examinations.
The university yesterday issued a detailed rebuttal of Mr MacKinnon's
allegations, saying he had been given every possible support despite
appearing not to be up to the course, academically.
The 32-year-old had gained entry to Dundee University's medical school
last year claiming to be 17-year-old Brandon Lee. He had concluded that
taking on the identity of a Bearsden Academy schoolboy and gaining
sufficient top-grade Highers for university was the only way he could
achieve his ambition.
He had secured the place he coveted -- at Dundee's medical school --
by the standard UK admissions' system, which does not demand independent
checks on new students' birthdays or nationality.
He then dropped out of the university for personal reasons in December
after one term and was due to re-enrol as a first year medical student
next week.
But, in August, he learned that the university had tightened up
enrolment regulations for new students because of an illegal scheme in
England involving grant payments being fraudulently made to fictitious
overseas undergraduates.
The university told Mr MacKinnon -- whom it still believed was Brandon
Lee -- that, in common with other new students, he would have to furnish
his birth certificate on enrolment.
That would have revealed his true identity and, in all likelihood,
resulted in his expulsion.
He told The Herald: ''I realised when I was sent information by the
university in August. I noticed the procedure for matriculation included
presentation of a birth certificate or, if you were born outside the UK,
a passport.
''I felt certain at that point that my plans were wholly unravelled.''
He concluded that he had no option but to sit it out ''in the slightest
but patently forlorn hope that some miracle might save my position''.
He explained: ''I considered approaching someone on the university
medical faculty and openly discussing what I had done but in remembering
my experiences at Glasgow University I realised that this would have
been hopelessly naive.
''I was overwhelmed by such a realisation. I found myself unable to
act in any direction.''
He has claimed that he failed in medicine at Glasgow University at his
examinations because of a debilitating illness and accused the
university of treating him in a hostile and uncaring way.
But the Dean of the faculty, Professor Brian Whiting, said yesterday:
''It appears from the history of the case that he was not up to it
academically.''
University authorities also rejected his allegations about being badly
treated and said the full appeals procedures had been exhausted in his
campaign for re-admission as a medical student.
The authorities disclosed that he had written more than 230 letters to
each member of the senate and the court -- the university's governing
body -- pleading his case.
Mr MacKinnon failed his first year medical exams in 1981 but secured
admission to second year after passing his resits. But he dropped out in
second year because of ill-health.
The university said he had been given the full support of the chief
adviser, a doctor, and a student counsellor and psychiatrist. In light
of their advice, he was persuaded to withdraw from the course and seek
re-entry.
It said he had asked to repeat his second year, which he did, because
he was ''feeling very well'', but he failed four exams and passed only
one on resit, and was told that he faced exclusion from the course.
Then, said the university, when he went before the appeals committee
to argue his case for continuing his studies he claimed he had been ill,
but had concealed his illness.
The university said it had no record of ill-health during his third
year. Professor Whiting said: ''By the time he got to the end of the
repeat second year and had failed three out of four resits, I think the
right decision was made. This student was no longer acceptable in
relation to the medical faculty.''
The university said it had acted out of ''kindness'' and ''in his best
interests'' when it had advised him to withdraw from his studies.
Professor Whiting went on: ''We have a responsibility to protect the
public in training doctors and I think we always take the view that we
are the first important gateway to the medical profession and so
standards have to be as high as possible.''
Referring to his later change of identity, the Dean said deceit ''was
not good grounds'' for letting someone continue on a medical course.
The university also said that Mr MacKinnon was ''running out of time''
because medical students must complete their course in six years, which
means there is an opportunity to repeat only one year.
Mr MacKinnon made several appeals which were rejected and, despite a
succession of letters from him and his mother, he was told no further
action could be taken.
He unsuccessfully sought a re-opening of his appeal to the court and,
in 1986, he returned to study in the science faculty. Although he
successfully completed an honours degree he did not graduate. His
correspondence with the university continued until 1991.
Mr MacKinnon said last night that he found the university's account
''disappointing but totally expected. I have presented my story as
honestly and as completely as I can''.
Dundee University emphasised that its new admissions arrangements were
not linked to Mr MacKinnon's case. Mr Gordon Black, the assistant
admissions officer, said that, because Mr MacKinnon was not a new
student and was seeking to be re-admitted, he would have received an
admissions letter earlier than most other students.
He agreed that he would have been exposed last year if the new system
had been in use then.
''If it had been introduced then we would have picked this up. I would
imagine he would have been taken up before the university authorities.''
Meanwhile, Mr MacKinnon will shortly be informed of the university's
decision about his future. It is all but certain that he will not be
allowed to be re-admitted to the medical school.
The Herald has delivered letters to Dr Michael Almond, secretary of
the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, and Mr Norman MacLeod,
headteacher of Bearsden Academy, in which he explains his actions, and
apologises for them.
The Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Professor Denis
McDevitt, will have the final say on his future after consulting the
termination of studies (review) committee.
Dr Almond said yesterday that he sympathised with him, ''because he
has got himself into an awful mess by applying his obvious talents in a
misguided direction.
''But, as has been said before, if someone falsifies an application
form, particularly for a professional course like medicine, then it is
not something which is looked upon with any great favour.
''You are training people for a profession and therefore the attitude
of that profession is important. Whether that profession would be happy
admitting someone to its ranks who falsified information is far more
important a factor than it would be in a normal university course, but
obviously we are concerned about the reputation of the university and
the medical school as well. We have got to be fair to Mr MacKinnon, but
fair to the public as well.''
Mr MacLeod said: ''On reading Brian's letter a line from Hamlet ran
through my head: 'When sorrows come they come not single spies but in
battalions.' Early illness, disputed exclusion from university, academic
re-entry resulting in a near miss, father dying of cancer, falsification
of identity, exposure and likely exclusion from Dundee University.
''It would also be fanciful in the extreme to quote the line from
Macbeth about vaulting ambition that o'erleaps itself. But, in essence,
what we are reading in this letter is a personal tragedy.
''His was also an extremely high-risk strategy. Medicine of all
professions is the embodiment of integrity, trust, honour. His judgment
was flawed in building a career on such a falsehood as the one he
perpetrated. But I wish him well as he embarks on the next phase of his
life.
''He will be remembered here as an unselfish, considerate, bright,
friendly former pupil. Many of the staff, I think, understand his
motives and do not feel hostility to his deception.''

A BOOK price war is set to break out as two more major publishers
pulled out of the scheme which sets minimum prices.
HarperCollins and Random House are withdrawing from the Net Book
Agreement, effectively ending the system and likely to herald a new
free-market era.
Hodder Headline and Reed has already said it would abandon the
agreement, which has been in effect for 40 years, and media group
Pearson, which owns Penguin, said it would not continue its
long-standing support for the NBA. Announcements from other publishers
are expected tomorrow when leading firms gather for the next monthly
meeting of the Publishers' Association.
W H Smith and sister firm Waterstone's said they would each cut the
prices of about 100 popular titles from Sunday.
Supermarket chain Asda, which already offers 50% discounts on some
Hodder books, said it had signed a multi-million pound agreement with
HarperCollins and would be selling more cut-price titles from next week.
However, although it will mean cheaper books available, there could be
a cut in titles, with publishers reluctant to take on new writers.
Independent book chains in Scotland, who have supported the NBA
because they felt it ensured a wider range of titles, are reluctantly
set to join the price war.
Mr Willie Anderson, president of the Booksellers Association and
managing director of John Smith Bookshops in Glasgow, and who has fought
a long campaign to retain the agreement, said his firm would probably be
entering into ''some form of price reductions on HarperCollins and
Random House books''.
He went on: ''In the long run, the consumer is going to lose most
because the consumer is going to have a narrower range of books from
which to choose. Prices will increase on less popular books to make up
for cuts in bestsellers.''
Mrs Hilary Thin, a director of James Thin booksellers in Edinburgh,
said the firm would also be offering special prices on some bestsellers.
Thin's would strive to maintain a wide range of stock, she said,
because it was in the interest of public knowledge and freedom that
people could get books if they wanted them. However, she warned that
publishers would be slightly nervous of taking on new writers and that
some bookshops might order fewer books.
Defenders of the NBA argue that price-fixing allows a wide range of
books to be stocked by small as well as large shops, encouraging new
writers. Abandoning it would mean large chains and superstores would
cream off bestseller sales by cutting prices, leaving many smaller
chains unable to compete, they believe.
Mr Anderson added: ''There are now too many substantial publishers
outside the agreement to make it possible for the Publishers
Association, who administer the NBA, to defend the agreement in the
court.''
He added: ''Booksellers are now faced with a price war after October
1, which can only be to the detriment of independent booksellers.''
Around one third of books published in Britain will not now be subject
to minimum price setting.
At HarperCollins, Mr Eddie Bell said the NBA had served authors and
the book trade well, but its position ''is no longer tenable. It
survived the House of Commons National Heritage Select Committee
investigation earlier this year, only to fall at the first legal fence a
few weeks ago in front of the Restrictive Trade Practices Court.''
At Random House, the largest trade publisher in the English language,
Mr Gail Roebuck said it had staunchly defended the NBA as long as
industry consensus had existed: ''That consensus has now self-evidently
collapsed.''
Last week, the BBC announced it was withdrawing more than 150
children's titles from the NBA.
HarperCollins list of top authors includes Martin Amis, Kingsley Amis,
Jeffrey Archer, Tom Clancy, Agatha Christie, Doris Lessing, Len
Deighton, Michael Dobbs, Fay Weldon, Sidney Sheldon, and Robert Ludlum.
Perennial best-sellers include Collins dictionaries, Batholomew maps,
and The Times Atlas of the World.

New York
FEDERAL prosecutors charged a former trader at Daiwa Bank Ltd with
falsifying books and records, concealing $1100m in bond losses over 11
years, US Attorney Mary Jo White said today.
According to the complaint filed in US District Court here, the
trader, Toshihide Iguchi, disclosed the losses in a letter dated July 13
to the president of Daiwa in Japan.
In the letter, Iguchi, who was an executive vice president in charge
of bond trading, admitted he had engaged in a pattern of illegal conduct
in connection with his duties at the New York branch, Ms White said.
The US complaint alleged that Iguchi sold, without authorisation, US
government securities belonging to Daiwa or held by Daiwa on behalf of
its customers. The unauthorised sales were allegedly used to cover
trading losses.
To conceal the scheme, the complaint alleges, Iguchi forged Bankers
Trust New York Corp account statements relating to the custody account,
and placed the forged statements in Daiwa's files.
The allegedly forged statement for the period ended July 31, 1995,
showed Daiwa had securities valued at about $4600m when in fact the
account only held securities valued at about $3500m, the complaint
alleged.
Iguchi, 44, is a permanent resident of the United States, living in
New Jersey.
At his arraignment, he was remanded in custody and a federal defender
appointed to represent him said Iguchi may make a bail application
later.
A Daiwa bank official said the losses did not involve trading in
options or derivatives, the complex financial instruments traded by Nick
Leeson, the 28-year-old trader who allegedly brought down Barings,
Britain's oldest merchant bank, last February.
Earlier Japanese financial authorities called the incident ''deeply
regrettable'' but insisted it posed no threat to either Daiwa or to
Japan's financial system, which has been hit hard by bad debts.
Since the discovery of the losses, Daiwa has announced that its
president and chairman would each take 30% pay cuts, and other senior
staff would take cuts of between 10% and 30%, for six months from next
month.
In Tokyo, central bank Governor Yasuo Matsushita said in a statement
that the bank had issued a strict warning to Daiwa.
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said there was no need to worry
about the financial health of Daiwa, Japan's 10th largest commercial
bank, or the overall financial system.

Washington
THE Bosnian talks in America yesterday produced real hope of peace,
with the warring parties reaching a framework agreement on the future
government of the country.
President Bill Clinton said the Foreign Ministers of Bosnia, Croatia,
and Yugoslavia had agreed on the basic principles for a settlement.
There will be a presidency, parliament, and constitutional court, and
there will be free democratic elections under international supervision.
He insisted Bosnia would not be partitioned. It will remain a single
state, and the Serbs will not be allowed to secede.
The Ministers, he said, had taken ''another positive step towards
peace in Bosnia''.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic welcomed the agreement, echoing
Mr Clinton's words. It was ''a further step in the direction of peace''.
He added: ''All those who are for a continuation of war will find it
hard to annul the results of the conference.''
He said the deal confirmed the existence of his Bosnian Serb Republika
Srpska ''as well as the equality of the Serb with the other peoples in
former Bosnia-Herzegovina.'' He said a political settlement, which might
be painful for all three sides in the conflict, could be expected in the
near future.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sacirbey said the agreement provided
on paper for free and direct elections for a parliament and presidency,
but that only time would tell if there was a real commitment to make the
agreement work.
Mr Clinton conceded that many details remain to be settled. These
include the map of the territory to be divided between the Serbs and the
others.
The recent Muslim-Croat conquests have produced a division of Bosnia
into roughly equal parts between the allies and the Serbs, but the devil
is in the details. There will be prolonged argument over future borders
and quite probably more fighting as each side seeks to improve its
position.
The Bosnian Government demanded free elections, while the Serbs wanted
to nominate their senior figures directly. A further question to be
resolved is the fate of General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military
commander, and Mr Karadzic, who have both been indicted for war crimes.
It could prove a barrier. After the talks last night, Mr Sacirbey said
the peace accords would be difficult to implement unless they were
jailed or put on trial. ''As long as Mladic and Karadzic are free, not
only is Bosnia in danger but peace is in danger.''
The deal was built on basic principles for ending the war which were
agreed earlier this month at a meeting in Geneva, the fruit of an
aggressive US-led diplomatic drive twinned with powerful Nato air
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.
Under the terms of the Geneva accord, Bosnia will remain a single
state but will be divided into sections: a Muslim-Croat federation with
51% of the territory and a Bosnian Serb republic with 49%.
Both communities pledge freedom of movement, respect for human rights
and the right of return for refugees. The agreement calls for the
stationing of European security monitors in all main towns to check that
agreements are kept.
Bosnia will have a single parliament which will draw two thirds of its
representatives from the Muslim-Croat federation and one-third from the
Bosnian Serb republic. Decisions on any issue would be taken by majority
vote, provided at least one third of each group backed the decision.
The presidency would have the same makeup and decisions would also be
taken by majority vote. If one third of the total members of the
presidency disagree, any decision would be referred back to the
parliament.
The elections will take place as soon as soon as possible.
The Ministers' meeting was under the direction of the US Secretary of
State, Mr Warren Christopher, with his chief assistant for Bosnian
affairs, envoy Richard Holbrooke. The other members of the contact
group, Britain, Germany, France, and Russia, were also represented.
Mr Clinton said Mr Holbrooke would return to the Balkans tomorrow to
try to settle the remaining questions. The most acute of those problems
is achieving a ceasefire. Mr Clinton said once a peace agreement has
been signed, the US would help to enforce it, whatever doubts
Republicans have.
