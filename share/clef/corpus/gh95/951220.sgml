ACTRESS Janet Suzman yesterday claimed the Government was behaving like ``a
wicked fairy in a pantomime'' over plans for a crackdown on bogus asylum
seekers.
Ms Suzman joined former Middle East hostage John McCarthy at a protest against
the controversial Immigration and Asylum Bill, which aims to streamline the
applications procedure and tighten up benefit rules. Ministers have stressed
that genuine refugees have nothing to fear.
However, Ms Suzman said at the demonstration outside the Commons: ``It seems so
cruel, when we have such a huge street problem of the homeless and mentally ill
anyway, that suddenly, like a wicked fairy in a pantomime, the Government waves
its wand and deposits thousands of people on the streets, the day this Bill is
passed.''
Under the proposed legislation, income support payments will not be made to
those who have been refused asylum, even though they may be appealing.
Ms Suzman said: ``This is a moral issue and the Home Secretary, Michael Howard,
should be ashamed of himself, because his grandfather came over here from some
East European country years ago.''
As part of the protest, actress Billie Whitelaw and eight children from George
Mitchell School in London's Waltham Forest performed a short play about a
Kurdish boy forced to flee his homeland.

DETECTIVES in Renfrewshire launched a murder inquiry yesterday following what
was described as a vicious and unprovoked attack on a man who later died in
hospital.
Mr John McGrorey, 39, of Rankine Street, Johnstone, was found lying in the
town's Canal Road suffering from a serious head injury at about 9pm on Monday.
Mr McGrorey, who lived alone and was unemployed, was taken by ambulance to the
Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, and later transferred to the Southern
General Hospital, Glasgow, where he died at about 9.30am yesterday.
Detective Sergeant David Hay said yesterday: ``This was a vicious and
completely unprovoked attack on a man who seemed to keep himself to himself.''
Detectives, who say there is no evidence to suggest the attack was
drugs-related, have appealed for anyone who may have been in the area of
Thornbrae, Campbell Street, or Canal Road, at about 9pm on Monday.
They would particularly like to speak to two men seen walking in the area at
the time and have urged anyone with information to contact them.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth's plan to expand the role of the Scottish
Grand Committee was approved by MPs last night without a vote.
One of the changes will enable the committee comprising all Scotland's MPs to
question senior UK Cabinet Ministers. The Prime Minister is expected to give
evidence next month.
However, Opposition MPs including Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson,
said the changes fell far short of providing Scotland with a domestic
parliament to take over the handling of Scottish business from Westminster.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, for the Liberal Democrats, said he welcomed the changes if
they would lead to further measures.
For the Scottish National Party, Mr Andrew Welsh predicted that the committee
would be ``widely ignored in Scotland''.

MEDICAL experts are mystified why the parents of a seven-week-old baby who died
from meningitis had themselves become ill.
The parents, who have not been identified, are ``improving'' in hospital in
Newcastle upon Tyne.
Doctors have confirmed that one has meningitis, while the other is ``possibly''
suffering from the disease.
Neither has left Newcastle General Hospital since taking their baby to casualty
last Thursday. The child died within hours.
Dr Nicol Black, consultant in communicable disease control for Newcastle health
authority, said: ``We are still trying to piece it all together. A family case
like this is extremely unusual.
``The chance of parents becoming infected from their children is something like
that of being struck by lightning or a meteor,'' he said.
q Borders Health Board last night confirmed that a 12-month-old boy had been
admitted to Borders General Hospital suffering from meningococcal septicaemia.
Earlier this month two women were admitted to the hospital with meningococcal
meningitis. Both have now been released. Borders Health Board said the baby is
responding well to treatment.

LOTTERY watchdog Peter Davis is to keep his job, the National Heritage
Secretary Virginia Bottomley announced last night, much to the amazement of
opposition MPs.
The move followed days of speculation that he could face the sack after
admitting accepting free flights with the American company GTECH, a key Camelot
stakeholder.
Mrs Bottomley told Mr Davis yesterday afternoon: ``You retain my
confidence.......there is not, and never has been, any doubt about your
integrity.''
In a letter to him after the pair met at the department, Mrs Bottomley said he
had given an assurance that, in future, if he was involved in situations that
could lead to a conflict of interest with his role as regulator, he would seek
guidance from the department.
She made it clear: ``I do not think your acceptance of the flights was wise in
the context of your role as regulator of the lottery.''
Her statement followed a weekend of fevered rumours over Mr Davis's dealings
with GTECH, which has a 22.5% stake in lottery operator Camelot.
Mr Davis, director-general of Oflot, became embroiled in a row after his
admission to the Commons Public Accounts Committee last week that he accepted
flights in helicopters and private jets belonging to GTECH.
He also stayed at the Long Island home of the firm's non-executive director
Carl Menges, a family friend for 20 years.
Then on Monday, after Mr Davis was summoned to the Heritage Department for a
two-hour meeting with Mrs Bottomley, he emerged and declared he was ``going
back to work''.
However, his statement appeared to fuel a major Commons row and Shadow Heritage
Secretary Jack Cunningham warned Mrs Bottomley over the Despatch Box that many
people across Britain would be ``astonished'' if Mr Davis was allowed to stay
in his job.
He called on her to publish a code of conduct for the regulator and said there
was a case for an independent investigation of ``this whole sorry episode''.
Last night, Mrs Bottomley praised Mr Davis for his role in launching the
``highly successful lottery''.
Mrs Bottomley went on: ``You are making a full report on your overseas travel
and hospitality arrangements to the Public Accounts Committee. You have assured
me that there are no other issues which may come to light subsequently which
could affect my decision in this matter.
``I have told you that I do not think your acceptance of the flights was wise
in the context of your role as regulator of the lottery.''
Mr Davis said in a statement: ``I am grateful to the Secretary of State for her
expression of confidence in me as the regulator of the National Lottery.
``I am looking forward to continuing my work of ensuring that the National
Lottery is run properly, that players' interests are protected, and that the
maximum funds are raised for the good causes.''
Dr Cunningham said: ``Mrs Bottomley's decision will be greeted with incredulity
throughout Britain.
``A public watchdog who has defied the advice of senior civil servants and
closely involved himself with a private company of which he has the
responsibility of regulating cannot command public confidence.
``Mr Davis' lack of judgment has in turn exposed a serious flaw in the judgment
of the Secretary of State.''
Liberal Democrat national heritage spokesman Robert Maclennan said: ``This move
scarcely smacks of firm government. When her own department guidelines have
been flagrantly disobeyed regarding accepting hospitality, Virginia Bottomley
is apparently willing to turn a blind eye.
``Mr Davis is not fit to regulate a million pound business if he cannot
regulate his own behaviour.''
A Camelot spokeswoman said: ``It's not really for us to comment. It's a
Government matter.''

AMID dramatic scenes in the Commons last night, the Government was defeated
over its approach to fisheries policy.
It lost the crucial vote on how it would tackle this weekend's negotiations on
the common fisheries policy by 299 votes to 297, an Opposition majority of two.
Two Tories - Mr Michael Carttiss (Great Yarmouth) and Mr Bill Cash (Stafford) -
voted against the Government and 25 failed to vote for a variety of reasons,
including it is thought, 11 deliberate abstentions.
Jubilant Opposition MPs waved their order papers as the vote was declared,
while Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said the Government had listened to the
points raised and would give due weight to what had been said.
He said that Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry would, as always, represent the
interests of the UK and UK fishermen. However, from the Labour benches,
Agriculture spokesman Gavin Strang said that Mr Hogg's statement was ``just not
good enough.''
The Government's fisheries policy had failed, and the Commons had taken a
historic decision. He said: ``The Government has been defeated. It is all very
well for the Minister (Mr Hogg) to say that Ministers will pay due attention,
but the fact is that the House has rejected the Government's position on
fisheries policy.''
In reaching their decision, MPs rejected pleas from both Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth and Mr Baldry, who argued that inside or outside the CFP the
Government would fight for Britain's interests.
They also rejected what was described as a last-minute bribe, under which
Ministers promised #15m in the form of grants towards harbour works and
marketing schemes over the next three years, some of which is destined for
Scotland.
The acrimonious debate was opened by Mr Forsyth, who said he was the first to
acknowledge the level of concern in fishing communities, but argued the
difficulties could best be resolved from within the CFP. He was constantly
interrupted by Euro-sceptic MPs, notably Mr John Townend (Bridlington) who told
Mr Forsyth he could not be blamed for the ``betrayal'' of fisheries policy by
the former Tory Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath.
Sir Edward, hitting back in a later contribution, described Mr Townend's
remarks as ``abusive'' and bluntly told the House: ``I am not a traitor to my
country, whatever the Honourable Gentleman may think.''
Mr Forsyth's main point was that Mr Baldry, would be fighting hard to get the
best deal possible for UK fishermen at the talks which begin in Brussels
tomorrow.
The Minister said: ``I am well aware that many fishermen do not believe they
have been well served by the CFP. Most of them recognise that the CFP has not
been successful in conserving fish stocks.
``They feel their fishing rights are increasingly insecure because they believe
that the CFP is founded on a principle of equal access by all community
fishermen to fish stocks throughout the Community's waters.
``I understand this fear but I think it is exaggerated. We should not
underestimate our success in maintaining relative stability, in limiting access
to our territorial waters, in applying effective controls on Spanish access and
fishing effort in western waters. These are successes we have achieved within
the Community and which cut across the principle of equal access.''
For Labour, Dr Strang strongly criticised the Government over its handling of
fisheries policies over the years, notably its signing up to an agreement
allowing Spanish vessels into the Irish Box and allowing increased access for
Spanish fishing vessels to the waters to the west of the United Kingdom, which
presented ``an unacceptable threat to the economic viability of fishing
communities in England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.''
He claimed the Government had not effectively represented in Europe the
interests of the UK fishing industry and had failed to implement at home a
fisheries policy which was in the interests of the domestic industry.
Dr Strang said: ``I have spoken today to fishermens' leaders from Plymouth to
Lerwick and they support Labour's amendment. It is utterly unacceptable that we
should be decommissioning UK boats to facilitate access to UK waters by one of
European partners -in this case Spain. The real issues and real problems remain
unaddressed.''
Mr David Harris (St Ives - Con.), who represents a large fishing community in
the South-west of England, said that he was torn between the need to support
the Government and the wishes of his constituents.
Mr Jim Wallace (Orkney and Shetland - Lib Dem.) said a 200-mile fishing limit
was no solution to the problems facing the fishing industry.
He insisted there was no majority in the House for Britain to renege on its
international obligations and withdraw from the CFP.
``What is required is a thoroughgoing reform of the CFP and for proper
enforcement.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond urged would-be Tory rebels not to be ``bought cheaply''
and to hold out for bigger Government concessions.
Condemning Government ``failures'' in tackling the problems of over-fishing, he
said: ``Time and time again we have had a strategy by the fishing industry to
the Government and time and time again it has been greeted with deaf ears.
``If the Government is defeated this evening, there will be rejoicing in every
fishing port the length and breadth of Britain.''
Former whipless Tory Euro-rebel Christopher Gill (Ludlow) said the CFP was
``failing to protect fishing stocks, encouraging short-term exploitation at the
expense of genuine conservation, making criminals of otherwise honest people,
alienating public opinion, and perpetuating the situation in which a vital
British interest is compromised by the process of qualified majority voting''.
Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood - Con.) told the House that Ministers
should be required to signal to European partners the intention to establish a
200-mile exclusion zone and to leave the CFP, with the decision to be endorsed
by voters in a general election.
``The CFP is a busted flush and we should have no further part of it.''
Tory former leadership challenger John Redwood (Wokingham), intervened to say:
``Do you recognise that there are a lot of good Conservatives here tonight who
do not wish to give any comfort to the Labour Party on their political stunt,
but who are deeply worried about the state of the fishing industry?
``Is there more you can say about the robust stance you will take at the
Council and, if necessary, British action you might take after the Council so
that we stand up for British fishermen and not for Spanish ones?''
Mr Baldry replied: ``You can rest assured that I see my primary duty to this
House is to represent and stand up for the interests of the British fishing
industry.''
The Labour amendment accusing Ministers of failing to implement fisheries
policy in interests of UK, was defeated by 305 votes to 297, a Government
majority of eight.
However, the Government was defeated by two votes on its motion voicing support
for Ministers' intention to ``negotiate the best possible fishing opportunities
for British fishermen consistent with scientific advice and the need to sustain
the stocks''. Voting was 299 to 297.
q The Tories who did note vote were: Rupert Allason (Torbay), David Atkinson
(Bournemouth East) Spencer Batiste (Elmet), Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton
South-West), Dr Michael Clark (Rochford), Sir Julian Critchley (Aldershot),
Hugh Dykes (Harrow East), Harold Elletson (Blackpool North), Sir Peter Fry
(Wellingborough). Christopher Gill (Ludlow), Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Harry
Greenway (Ealing North), Tony Marlow (Northampton North), Sir Michael Marshall
(Arundel), David Porter (Waveney), Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills),
Michael Spicer (Worcestershire South), Walter Sweeney (Vale of Glamorgan), Sir
Peter Tapsell (Lindsey East), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East), Peter Thurnham
(Bolton North-East), John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood), David Wilshire
(Spelthorne) and Ann Winterton (Congleton). Whipless Tory Sir Richard Body also
did not vote.

IN a surprise move, the Labour leaders of the new City of Edinburgh Council
opted yesterday to stick with the traditional city colours of black and white,
with a dash of dark red, for the authority's new logo.
There had been speculation that dark blue or even dark green might be favoured
colours but, in the end, tradition prevailed.
The new corporate identity consists of the word Edinburgh in capital letters,
with a Celtic E and a Latin V, and underneath it the words ``The City of
Edinburgh Council''. An in-house team from Lothian region and Edinburgh
district created the design.
Labour leader Keith Geddes told the council that the cost of beginning the
transfer to the new identity would be limited to #100,000 this year.
It would take until the end of the century for all Lothian region and Edinburgh
District Council signs to be changed.
A report explained that a figure of #400,000 for establishing a new logo, which
had caused a previous row, related to the amount required if a more complete
implementation of the new identity were to be undertaken.

LAST night's victory tasted sweet for Mr Donald Dewar, MP for Garscadden, and
Opposition Chief Whip since the beginning of the session.
One Scots Labour MP said: ``When I saw Donald wearing his Sunday School face I
knew we were going to win.'' The ``Sunday School face'' means Mr Dewar is
looking marginally less pessimistic than usual.
In a vote where victory was tantalisingly near with the Government majority
down to five and many discontented Tory MPs, Mr Dewar marshalled the Labour
vote aided by three Labour back benchers, Mr Dale Campbell-Savours
(Workington), Mr Martin Redmond (Don Valley), and Mr John Fraser (Norwood).
The latter was in a neck brace after breaking a back vertebrae after being
knocked down by a car. He struggled in, despite being very ill.
Without the Tory rebels the Opposition could not have done it, but Mr Dewar was
already winning high opinions from those who wondered if Mr Blair had blundered
in putting one of the party's best despatch box performers in a backroom job,
however important.
However the reality of victory, with the prospect of more, as the Government's
majority seems set to inexorably fall, has buoyed party morale at the end of a
year which has finished disastrously for the Government and with the prospect
for Labour that it may not have to wait as long as 1997 to find itself in
office.
Mr Dewar's appointment has also been seen as a reassurance to the Scottish
party that Labour will indeed deliver a Scottish parliament at long last. It is
becoming recognised that few men are better equipped to steer the Scotland Bill
through what could prove some rough passages in the Commons.
With an important input into policy making, Mr Dewar now ranks as one of the
small band around Mr Blair on whom the electoral success of the party rests.

A SCOTTISH businessman was yesterday charged in a Boston court with violating
the US embargo against Libya by attempting to export more than $250,000
(#166,000) worth of computers and related equipment.
Mr David McKeeve, 36, from Glasgow, and the company for which he worked, McNeil
International of Edinburgh, are accused of submitting false information to
shipping agents and the US Customs Service.
McNeil International is unlisted in the Edinburgh phone book. Its telephone
number is ex-directory.
Mr McKeeve said the shipments were destined initially for Cyprus and later for
Ethiopia.
The court said his intended recipient was actually Libya, which was placed on
the US embargo list in 1986.
If convicted, Mr McKeeve faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $550,000
(#366,000).
In January 1986, the then President Ronald Reagan ordered the rupture of
economic and commercial relations with Libya and froze all Libyan assets in the
United States.
The move followed US accusations that Libya harboured and trained members of
the Abu Nidal group believed to be responsible for attacks at Rome and Vienna
airports.
Since the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, which killed 270 people, Washington has
sought a worldwide oil embargo against Libya to force Tripoli to hand over two
alleged Libyan agents sought in connection with the bombing.

A FATHER shattered by grief at the savage killing of his teenage daughter
yesterday made an anguished plea for the public to help police track down her
murderer.
Mr Philip Julyan, his voice cracking with emotion and with tears welling,
called on anyone who might have seen his daughter, Mhairi, during the last
fateful minutes as she made her way home from a panto, to come forward.
The 16-year-old schoolgirl went missing on Saturday night after watching
Sleeping Beauty at Kilmarnock's Palace Theatre with friends. After an
intensive
police search her body was found in a bus depot just a few hundred yards from
her home in Samson Avenue.
The Julyan family - father Philip, mother Maureen, both 46, and sister Claire,
21, - yesterday took the brave step of subjecting themselves to the ordeal of
a
news conference to help police in the murder hunt.
As he hugged his wife and daughter, Mr Julyan, visibly distraught, said: ``I
make this appeal in the hope that someone may have seeen Mhairi on Saturday
night when she left the Palace Theatre on her way home. And even during
Saturday night or even Sunday to come forward to let the police know and even
if anyone knows anything at all.
``Just come forward and let the police know. We've got to find out. We must.
Thanks.''
Police have established that Mhairi left the Palace Theatre around 9.30pm and
set off in a happy frame of mind after an enjoyable evening out with her best
friend, Julie-Ann Holland, to make her way home. It was a journey which should
have taken 10 to 15 minutes, but one she did not complete.
Her worried parents phoned a friends and when she could not be traced police
were alerted. They began a series of searches of the area. The grim discovery
of her body lying in a floor well in the Stagecoach Western Scottish bus depot
in McKinlay Place was made on Sunday afternoon.
Julie-Ann Holland described yesterday how she went out searching for Mhairi
after Mrs Julyan called the Hollands to say she had not returned home.
``As soon as I found out she was missing, we went out. We went to the
nightclubs, because her mum thought she maybe had gone there, but I knew all
the time that she would not be there. We went to all the parks, me and the
rest
of her pals.''
Julie-Ann's mother, Mrs Jane Holland, said her daughter had started screaming
when she found out that Mhairi was missing. ``We knew straight away really,''
said Mrs Holland. ``She would not have spoken to a
stranger. I'm just really, really angry and I just want whoever has done it to
be caught.''
Julie-Ann and Mhairi had been friends since the age of six and had been
together at the pantomime on Saturday night. The Hollands had waved her off on
the steps of the theatre after she decided to walk home.
``She went away laughing and joking,'' said Julie-Ann. ``She had really got
into the swing of the pantomime, shouting out and all that. At times she was
the only one you could hear.''
Another friend, 15-year-old Louise, said Mhairi was often described as quiet,
but was a popular girl who would hang around with the other youngsters in the
parks and always had a good word for everyone. ``She was really nice, you
know.
And I know that she wanted a lot out of life.''
Prayers were said at Kilmarnock Academy yesterday for their dead schoolmate
and
staff and pupils observed a minute's silence in her memory. Many of Mhairi's
closest friends were not there. They have been unable to return to school
since
the tragedy and some are receiving counselling.
The Rev Tom Jarvie, the school chaplain, spoke of the deep sense of loss which
the school and the community at large was feeling.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder, the man leading the hunt, said yesterday
that the attack on Mhairi appeared to have been sexually motivated and had
been
``particularly brutal and savage''.
He was not prepared to discuss how she had died, but said his team were not
looking for a murder weapon.
Mr Lauder added: ``I do not wish to instil panic but it would be irresponsible
to ignore the fact that it could happen again. I would ask parents to have a
heightened awareness of where their children, even adolescents, are at this
time of year when there is so much going on.''
Mr Lauder has so far ruled out any connection with any other unsolved case,
including the murder of Miss Shona Stevens in Irvine in November 1994 which is
still being investigated by detectives under his command.
He added: ``It is absolutely vital that anyone who has even the slightest
shred
of information gets in touch. It may be that they saw Mhairi at some stage or
it may be that they saw something suspicious in the area on Saturday night or
Sunday morning.''
Mr Lauder said the killer may have been bloodstained and there was a ``very
real possibility'' that he may have had local knowledge. He urged anyone who
was unhappy or uncomfortable about someone's behaviour to contact him in
confidence.
Mhairi's likely route would have taken her along London Road, past the Jet
filling station, into Middlemass Drive then into McKinlay Crescent beside the
bus depot.
She was wearing a black, Hoi Polloi bomber jacket, dark trousers, a purple
flowery blouse and black boots. Her curly ginger hair may have been tied in a
clasp.

IT took Labour councillors less than 30 seconds to consider the results of a
10-month investigation of financial irregularity in a number of community
projects in Easterhouse in Glasgow.
The report, which has been passed to Strathclyde Police, reveals an
unacceptable absence of financial records and a failure to account properly for
at least #12,000 of public funds.
It further points out that disciplinary procedures have already been set in
train against two community volunteers, one of whom is an elected member of the
new City of Glasgow unitary authority.
Due to pressures of business and a bereavement, there were no opposition
members present at yesterday's meeting of the community action committee.
Town clerk Thomas Monaghan opened the meeting by saying there was one item on
the agenda. Convener Christine Devine then asked committee members if they
wished to accept the recommendations. They responded: ``Agreed!'' And it was
all over.
Last night, however, Militant Group leader Councillor Thomas Sheridan
threatened to expose the two community volunteers unless action was taken
against them.
The auditor's report examined the affairs of Cranhill Community Council,
Greater Easterhouse Theatre Company, Cranhill Youth Forum, and Healthy Cities
projects.

EVIL Richard Karling was jailed for life yesterday after almost getting away
with murder.
A jury found him guilty of drugging secretary Ms Dorothy Niven, 33, in a city
restaurant and later smothering and murdering her in her home.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that the following day, he called an ambulance
claiming he had just found her lying unconscious and face-down on her bed.
But Ms Niven had been dead for more than 12 hours.
At first her murder went undetected when a post mortem examination found
nothing suspicious about her death.
Meanwhile, Karling, 43, cried crocodile tears over her death, while thinking
his well-laid plans had led to the perfect murder.
It was only the suspicions of depute-fiscal Mr David Green, who was present at
the first post mortem in Glasgow's City Mortuary, which led to Karling's
downfall.
The first police surgeon called to Ms Niven's house at Silvan Place, Busby,
Renfrewshire, treated the incident as a ``sudden death''.
Later, Dr Ali-Alousi, who conducted a post mortem examination on June 30 last,
did not ask for a second pathologist to help him because it was not reported a
suspicious death.
He found that Ms Niven died of congestion of the lungs.
But Mr Green, who is married to a doctor, was not satisfied.
He learned also that the dead woman had two boyfriends, and ordered a second
post-mortem examination at Glasgow's City Mortuary.
This was carried out two weeks later by pathologist Dr Marie Cassidy and a
colleague from Glasgow University.
They found that Ms Niven had been suffocated and killed, and Mr Green
instigated a murder inquiry.
Dr Cassidy noticed that the dead woman's pants were on back-to-front and
inside-out.
She told Lord Johnston and a jury later that she thought the pants had been put
on after her death.
Dr Cassidy was asked if the woman may have died while having sex with her face
pressed into the pillow.
She said it was possible, but unlikely although the woman had been drugged and
would not struggle much.
Karling claimed in evidence that he had adjusted the pants, but denied he had
put them on after she died. He also denied having sex with Ms Niven after
taking her home the previous evening in June 27 last, from the Pancake Place,
Union Street, Glasgow.
Dr Cassidy said that by the time she examined Ms Niven it was too late to
determine whether she had been sexually assaulted.
A sample of her blood showed traces of the sleeping drug Temazepam.
There was no sign of a break-in to the dead woman's home and police interviewed
Karling, of Bellview Crescent, Ayr, and her fiance, William Lynch.
During his trial Karling named Mr Lynch, of Comely Park, Gallowgate, Glasgow,
as the killer.
Detectives faced a classic ``who-dunnit'' mystery as they began a painstaking
murder hunt.
Karling claimed Ms Niven led a double life, working as a secretary at the
Students' Loan Company by day and in massage parlours at night.
His marriage to Sheila Ross, a daughter of the late Lord Ross, MP and Labour
Secretary of State for Scotland, was breaking up in l986.
Karling claimed he met Ms Niven in a sauna in Holland Street, Glasgow, and
began a stormy love-hate relationship with her.
Her mother, Mrs Ivy Niven, of Sandgate Avenue, Mount Vernon, Glasgow, told how
Karling had thrown her daughter into a bath of cold water in his house in Ayr.
He also told her: ``If I can't have you no one else will.''
Karling was the general manager of a large television retail firm in Ayrshire
and had money to spend on Ms Niven.
They had meals in good hotels, enjoyed foreign holidays and Karling claimed he
gave her a car and furnished her flat.
But his drinking and obsessive jealousy led to a break up and she had to get a
court interdict to stop him phoning or following her.
However, Ms Niven agreed later to see him again.
Both Karling and Mr Lynch were unaware that she was sleeping with them in turn.
But by this time Karling, a heavy drinker, had lost his well-paid job and he
was living in a rented flat on housing benefit.
He faced losing Ms Niven again.
He began to plot her death and to spin the web of deceit as a cover up.
But Ms Niven's behaviour towards her fiancee William Lynch also helped lead to
her death.
On the day she died Mr Lynch, a gas inspector, drove her to work after living
with her for several nights.
She told him she was going to visit her mother in hospital.
Instead, she had arranged to meet Karling for a meal and then take him home,
but unwittingly she was falling into his death trap.
Advocate depute Mr William Totten, prosecuting, told Karling in court:
``Dorothy was a young, attractive and vivacious girl and you were obsessed by
her.
``You gave her a good time, and you had money to spend on her.
``The money, gifts and good times had run out and Dorothy had enough of the
relationship.
``You would have been left without her, with nothing, and you decided to kill
her.''
Asked by Mr Hugh Matthews, QC, defending why he had shown little emotion in the
witness box, Karling replied: ``My tears are inside me.''
Karling sat impassively as the jury found him guilty of murder by a majority.

THE Government last night slumped to a humiliating Commons defeat as its
approach to fisheries policy was defeated by two votes.
It was the culmination of the anger of bankrupt British fishermen building up
over the past two years.
A combination of Tory MPs representing fishermen throughout the UK and
Euro-sceptics challenged the Prime Minister to deliver a better European Union
deal.
The Tories, supported by Ulster Unionists and others, defeated the Labour
Party's outright challenge by eight votes. However, the Government went down by
two votes, 299-297, on its own motion 48 hours before Fisheries Minister Tony
Baldry goes into negotiations in Brussels which will decide who is allowed to
fish where and on what quotas.
The Commons debate was on a technical motion and therefore has no impact on
legislation. However, when Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said the
Government would take ``due weight on what has happened tonight'' he was jeered.
It was a moral victory for UK fishermen against what they regard as a sell-out
to Europe on their fishing quotas and the challenge from Spanish and other
fleets in what they consider their home waters.
Tory Euro-sceptics intervened against the Government to emphasise their message
to Mr Major that they are still severely critical of his whole European policy.
The Tories would not support the Labour Party in what they regarded as a
cynical amendment to the fisheries debate and so, despite eight Scottish and
Welsh Nationalist votes, the Labour amendment was thrown out by eight votes.
However, when it came to the Government's motion which insists that
conservation is the key issue, all the pent-up frustration on the Tory back
benches was expressed.
The two-vote defeat does not change anything in UK and European legislation,
but it was a loud declaration the country is deeply dissatisfied by the laying
up of boats from Peterhead to Newlyn in Cornwall.
In the last Commons vote before Christmas, Government Ministers were hoping
they could slip through on a mere technical vote on conservation.
Euro-sceptic Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, was put up by the
Government in the debate instead of Cabinet colleague Douglas Hogg in order to
minimise Tory defections. In this, Mr Forsyth succeeded in confining the defeat
to merely two votes.
Opposition MPs waved their order papers as the result was declared, and Labour
leader Tony Blair said the Government was increasingly unable to govern.
A total of 13 Tory MPs failed to support the Government in the crucial vote,
which came at the end of an acrimonious debate. Mr William Cash (Stafford) and
Mr Michael Cartiss (Great Yarmouth) voted with Labour, 11 abstained, while
others were absent through illness or on overseas trips.
Both Mr Forsyth and Mr Baldry insisted they would fight for the best interests
of the fishing industry in the negotiations and said that, inside or outside
the Common Fisheries Policy, there would have to be a reduction in fishing
effort because there were too many boats chasing too few fish.
The Ministers even tried to buy off the rebellion by announcing at the last
minute a #15m plan to give grants to harbour works and marketing schemes, about
#2.5m of which would have come to Scotland. The concession, however, was not
enough.
Labour's agriculture spokesman, Mr Gavin Strang, said the Government's
fisheries policy had failed and that the Commons had taken ``a historic
decision''.
Mr Blair said: ``The Government is unravelling. It is unable to lead. It is
increasingly unable to represent Britain, it is increasingly unable to govern.
``The leadership election changed absolutely nothing and so we see the
parliamentary year ending as it began: incompetence, division, and chaos.
``The Tories' divisions over Europe now run so deep that they have reduced
Government policy to a state of virtual paralysis. Because he never stood up to
his rebels, the Prime Minister is unable to control them. Because he has never
made his own views clear, he allows both sides of the European divide to claim
him as their own.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ``This is an important defeat for the Government
and an important victory for the fishing communities. It is all the more
damaging for the Government's credibility because the issue cuts across the
fault line of Europe in the Tory Party.
``The reaction in the fishing communities around Scotland will be one of
celebration that finally, after years of neglect and betrayal, the Government
fisheries Ministers have finally got their come-uppance.''
The Liberal Democrats' deputy leader, Mr Alan Beith, said: ``The House of
Commons has rightly insisted on a much tougher line in support of our fishermen
and the country will see this as a further demonstration that this Government
must go.''
Lib-Dem fisheries spokesman and Scottish leader Jim Wallace, the MP for Orkney
and Shetland, said: ``Tonight's vote shows conclusively that the Government has
lost the confidence of the people in its dealings with fishing policy. It was a
reflection of years of neglect of the fishing industry.''

TORY MP David Ashby was last night surveying the ruins of his life as the
dramatic loss of a libel action effectively left him branded a homosexual,
liar, and hypocrite.
The Leicestershire North West MP broke down and sobbed after a High Court jury
dismissed his claim by a majority verdict, and left him facing a legal bill
estimated at up to #500,000.
However, the Sunday Times in-house lawyer Alastair Brett said he expected the
paper to ``show magnanimity'' in its victory.
Mr Ashby, 55, brushed aside an attempt by his wife Sylvana - who offered
damning evidence against him during the 20-day trial - to offer commiserations.
She crossed the court and kissed him on the back of his neck. But he pushed her
away as she attempted to put an arm around him and snapped: ``Just leave me
alone.''
The action arose from a damages claim against the Sunday Times over an article
which claimed Mr Ashby was having a homosexual affair with neighbour Dr Ciaran
Kilduff.
Mr Ashby claimed the article made him out to be not only a homosexual, but a
liar over his relationship with Dr Kilduff and a hypocrite for stressing the
importance of family values in his last election address to voters.
Two hours after the verdict, Mr Ashby astonished cheering colleagues by
appearing in the Commons.

A SCOTS bride broke down in tears yesterday after a judge gave her an early
Christmas present by allowing her to be reunited with her Nigerian husband.
Mr Peter Nwokoye is being detained in Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, pending a
judicial review of a decision by the immigration authorities to refuse to grant
him political asylum.
He fears political persecution if he is sent back to Ogoniland, a homeland he
shared with Nobel Peace Prize nominee Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was recently executed
by the Nigerian Government.
Lord Milligan decided yesterday that Mr Nwokoye could be released pending a
court hearing of his case, provided his wife Tracy lodged #1000 security with
the court.
Mr Nwokoye, 35, arrived in the UK in 1991 and was at first allowed to remain
for six months. That was later extended, and in June this year he applied for
political asylum.
That was refused in July this year and he is seeking a judicial review of that
decision. He has been detained in prison for the past six months.
Advocate Mungo Bovey appeared for Mr Nwokoye at the Court of Session yesterday
to ask for interim liberation for his client pending the judicial review.
He said that Mr Nwokoye feared persecution because of the current situation in
Ogoniland. His client claimed there had been a rebellion in his village against
the decision of the Government and Shell Oil to destroy houses and take over
the land to enable oil prospecting to take place.
Mr Nwokoye alleged that two of his brothers had been imprisoned because of
protests and his mother was in hospital because of injuries she had suffered
during riots.
He argued that he should be treated as a refugee and granted asylum in Britain
under the UN Convention.
Lord Milligan was told that on September 22 this year Mr Nwokoye married a
Scots bank clerk, Miss Tracy McPherson, 26, who was unwilling to go to Nigeria
to live in the present climate of fear.
Mr Bovey said that she visited her husband three times a week in prison.
Mr Nwokoye had already been detained for about six months and if he was not
granted interim liberation now he could be left in prison for another six
months before his judicial review could be heard.
Lord Milligan said he was willing to grant Mr Nwokoye his freedom, but there
had to be a sufficient deterrent for him not to abscond if he were released
from prison.
He imposed a condition that #1000 be lodged as security with the court and that
Mr Nwokoye should report to the police in Edinburgh three times a week.
Speaking from the couple's home in Downfield Place, Dalry, Edinburgh, after the
hearing Mrs Nwokoye said: ``I can't believe it. I'm never going to have another
Christmas present like this.''
She had left her home late yesterday afternoon to lodge the #1000 required to
secure her husband's liberty, but was disappointed to learn he would not be
released immediately.
``I'm disappointed, but I know he's definitely going to be released tomorrow.''
However, she said the battle to save her husband from deportation was not over.
``The fight is still going on. The real case is the deportation issue.
``Last week there was a Channel 4 documentary called Delta Force which had
pictures of my husband's village. It has been totally razed. I'm not going to
let him go back to that,'' she said.

THE Glasgow-based Student Loans Company has gone ``in-house'' for its new chief
executive.
Mr Colin Ward, the company's assistant managing director, saw off more than 200
external candidates for the job, replacing retiring acting chief executive Sir
Eric Ash.
Sir Eric, who will resume his earlier role as non-executive director, was
appointed when the company's fortunes were at their lowest.
Thousands of students were left penniless after a new system to deal with
repeat borrowers failed. Universities were also angered by the company's
failure to handle the many urgent inquiries.
Sir Eric took over from the company's first chief executive, Mr Ron Harrison,
who was sacked for alleged financial irregularities.
Mr Ward, a chartered accountant, joined the company in 1990.

A LIEUTENANT-colonel who requisitioned an Army helicopter for a golf trip has
been disciplined and procedures tightened to prevent a recurrence of such an
incident, the Government announced last night.
The member of the Third Battalion, the Highland Regiment was one of two
officers taken by Gazelle helicopter to a tournament in May.
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames said in a Commons written reply that
inquiries by the Royal Military Police in Edinburgh had been completed and
considered by the Army chain of command.
``A Gazelle helicopter deviated from its task to take two Army officers to a
golf tournament,'' he said.
``There was no dishonest intent on the part of the officer responsible. He did,
however, make an error of judgment and he has been subject to the appropriate
disciplinary action.
A MoD spokesman declined to specify what action had been taken, but confirmed
it had not involved demotion or court-martial.
He emphasised that no blame had attached to the pilot of the helicopter.

<HEADLINE>New pill scare sparks requests for abortions</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974798867</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 30 women have asked for abortions in the past week after becoming
pregnant in the wake of the latest contraceptive pill scare, Britain's biggest
abortion charity reported yesterday.
It was a ``small but significant'' start to a period in which growing numbers
of women are expected to report unplanned pregnancies after stopping taking
their usual pill, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service.
``It is very early days yet and any surge in demand will be starting to show
from now,'' said chief executive Ian Jones.
BPAS, which carries out more than one in three abortions outside the NHS, was
monitoring the aftermath of the official warning two months ago that one and a
half million women should switch to safer brands of pill, he said.
Government scientists alerted doctors and pharmacists to findings that seven
brands carried twice the usual risk of causing blood clots in leg veins.
Their official letter recommended that women should finish their monthly course
before switching brands.
However, GPs and others, critical of the way the warning was made public,
immediately expressed concern that many unwanted pregnancies would result from
women dropping their regular pill before arranging to start a replacement.
That concern was now being borne out, said Mr Jones.
``We do expect an increase in the numbers giving the pill scare as the reason
for their pregnancy but it is too early to have much idea of the scale,'' added
Mr Jones.
The phenomenon was being monitored nationally by the seven BPAS clinics on a
computer-linked system, he said. It was hoped to link this with studies.
The research had to take into account the fact that one of the most common
reasons given by women for unwanted pregnancy was a switch in contraceptive
methods, usually because the pill they were taking did not suit them.
There was also a seasonal rise in demand for abortions in the post-Christmas
period, he said.
The biggest scare over the contraceptive pill, a decade ago, had led to an 8%
rise in demand for abortions, said Mr Jones. BPAS was currently carrying out
30,000 abortions a year.

THE job of advising the Scottish Prison Service team on the operational
specification for Scotland's first private prison has been given to Mr Alec
Spencer, governor of Peterhead prison.
The 500-prisoner, category B jail will be built under the Private Finance
Initiative and run under a Scottish Prison Service contract by private
operators.
It is to be built on one of three sites, most probably close to the existing
Low Moss prison at Bishopbriggs.
Mr Spencer, 49, will be responsible for specifying such matters as security
standards, regimes, and medical and educational facilities at the jail which
private contractors would then have to meet.
His post at Peterhead is to be filled by the governor of Aberdeen prison, Mr
Bill Rattray, 43. In another move, Mr Bill McKinlay, governor in charge at HM
Young Offenders' Institution at Polmont, is to become governor of Shotts prison
when the current governor, Mr George Shearer, retires in May.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday announced a major building
programme to improve Scotland's road network, with more than half the money
coming through the Private Finance Initiative.
A total of 17 schemes costing #450m will start over the next three years,
including long-awaited by-passes and three major motorway upgrades funded
through #257m from the PFI.
The announcement was welcomed warmly by industry and motoring organisations as
a significant success in strengthening the Scottish road network, but greeted
with dismay by some environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth.
The first PFI roads project will be the last 18-mile section of the A74 in
Scotland to motorway standard.
Under the scheme, which was used for the new Skye Bridge, private firms
undertake to design, build, finance and operate the project.
The advantage to the Government is that it does not have to find the huge
capital investment itself but it pays back over a period of time to the private
consortium. The Scottish Secretary remains the owner of the bridge or stretch
of road.
``It's a bit like buying something on hire purchase,'' said David Begg,
lecturer in transport economics at Napier University and also Lothian Regional
Council's transportation committee convener.
``It seems to be a short-term way out of the financial difficulties for the
Scottish Office. It could mean the taxpayer paying up to 20% more for a given
road improvement, compared to conventional financing.''
PFI will also be used for upgrading the M8 from Baillieston to Newhouse and the
M80 from Stepps to Cumbernauld.The latter is likely to be strongly opposed by
conservationists, eager to protect important habitats in the Kelvin Valley.
The remainder of the programme includes dualling of the A1 between Haddington
and Dunbar, a notorious stretch for accidents, improvements to the A75
Stranraer Euro-route, A9, and bypasses at Kintore and Dalkeith.
Mr Forsyth said: ``The trunk road network is of vital importance to the
continuing health of Scotland's economy. Our strategy is to give priority to
the key routes of major importance to the economy and my new plans will ensure
further rapid progress in that strategy."
Both the RAC and the AA said the announcement was a welcome recognition by the
Government of the importance of the road network to Scotland.
Mr Iain McMillan, director of CBI Scotland, said the schemes were good news for
business. ``We have lobbied long and hard to ensure a sound infrastructure for
Scotland. The completion of the M74 and of the Baillieston to Newhouse section
of the M8 are two key priorities,'' he added.
q Eight of the schemes approved yesterday are due to start during the next two
years: the A74 upgrade of the last 18-mile section in Scotland still not
motorway standard (PFI), M8 Newbridge underpass, M90 Halbeath interchange, A96
Kintore by-pass, A96 Blackburn bypass, A9 Logie Easter, A68 Dalkeith bypass.
and the A830 Loch Nan Uamh to Polnish bridge.
Nine are planned to start between April 1997 and March 1999: the M8 Baillieston
to Newhouse (PFI) including Newhouse to Shotts, junctions 5-6 (PFI), M80 Stepps
to Cumbernauld (PFI), M77 Fenwick to Floak, A1 Haddington to Dunbar, A830
Arisaig to Kinsadel, A828 Creagan Bridge, A75 The Glen and the A92 Balmedie to
Tipperty.

Brussels
Prime Minister John Major's remark that a clause in the Maastricht treaty's
timetable for a single currency is ``no longer operative'' had the European
Commission in confusion yesterday.
Mr Major alarmed back-bench critics of the EU on Monday when he told Labour's
veteran Euro-sceptic, Mr Peter Shore, that sterling's membership of the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was no longer a factor in monetary union.
Mr Shore had argued that Britain could not join the planned single currency in
1999 because Maastricht required entrants to have been in the ERM for at least
two years.
Mr Major has said Britain will not put the pound back into the ERM in the
present Parliament. He told the Commons that membership no longer applied as a
qualification for the single currency ``because the ERM that existed at the
time no longer exists''.
This met with a neutral reaction yesterday from the Commission, which normally
talks in spirited terms about the inevitability of monetary union and the
observance of Maastricht's convergence criteria for those wishing to join the
single currency.
Maastricht's wording is ambiguous, stating only that a member state must
respect the normal fluctuation margins in the ERM for two years without severe
tensions or voluntary devaluations if it is to join the single currency.
Many observers take the view that Mr Major is correct. The EU would be highly
unlikely to exclude any currency wishing to join in monetary union if it met
all the criteria without formal membership of the ERM.

A NIGERIAN political refugee seeking asylum in Britain would be targeted by
government death squads if he returned home, it was claimed yesterday. A former
Nigerian army chief told an immigration appeal hearing in Glasgow that the
country's military dictatorship would execute human rights campaigner Akin
Adegboye without a trial.
Colonel Tony Nyiam told Mr Mungo Deans, the special adjudicator hearing the
case, that Mr Adegboye's life was at risk because of his close links with
pro-democracy factions within the armed forces.
``It would be even more dangerous for Akin to go home than for me. If I am
caught, at least there would be some form of trial. They would just eliminate
him,'' he said.
Mr Adegboye, 36, of Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, and his Nigerian wife, Teju, are
appealing against deportation orders and are claiming political asylum because
they fear persecution and death if they return.
Mr Paul Seils, the Scottish Refugee Council lawyer representing Mr Adegboye,
said the Home Office's decision to refuse asylum to Mr Adegboye was because it
deemed his activities not to be serious enough.
``I don't think they had the right information, or they would not have said
that,'' Col Nyiam said.
The hearing is expected to finish today with a written decision due in January.

WHEN Santa Major wished him a ``Happy 1995'' last year, Ebenezer Blair snarled
back: ``Humbug. Bunkum.'' He knew what was coming and yesterday he told us.
The Prime Minister's year had ended as it had begun, he thundered, ``in
weakness, chaos and incompetence.'' Yes, dear reader, the Spirit of Christmas,
who had attempted an early entry to the Palace of Westminster on Budget Day to
be fobbed off with a cut-price bottle of Scotch, couldn't even get inside the
door for the last Prime Minister's Questions before Christmas.
The pantomime element of the season survived. Mr David Shaw (Dover - Con.) was
hissed even more than usual by Labour as he rose to ask his question. Appearing
to revel in his Demon King role he got his own back by making the question an
extremely long one including the festive accusation that the Opposition is soft
on drugs.
The Tory children then gave Mr Paddy Ashdown, whom they seem to dislike more
than any of Labour's star performers, an ever ruder reception. Like Mr Shaw, Mr
Ashdown seems to enjoy enraging his critics and regularly succeeds in winding
up the Prime Minister, normally a mild-mannered Clark Kent figure who mislaid
his Superman gear in 1992.
Mr Blair's scriptwriters had gone into overdrive for his last Commons
performance of the year and handed him a multi-layered soundbite which fitted
in railway privatisation, unhealthy prisons, Tory divisions on Europe and
failure to run the National Lottery right. And that wasn't Mr Major's year -
that was just this week.
The Leader of the Opposition has been soundbiting away at him all year and,
with most of the ammunition provided by HMG, one almost expects the Prime
Minister to come from behind the despatch box with his hands up saying ``I
surrender''.
But no. Despite this deluge of soundbites going into every television
set-owning home in the land, Clark Major refuses to give in. Each session ends
with him clinging to the despatch box by his fingertips ready to go another
round.
Mr Blair sneered at the #1bn to be spent in two years on promoting rail
privatisation. It would have been better spent on improving the services.
Mr Major replied that Railtrack was to invest #10bn in the infrastructure and
enquired where Labour would have found that kind of money from. Mr Blair said
it could make a start with the #1bn the Government had wasted which, as Mr
Major, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, pointed out, left him #9bn short.
Supportive Labour barrackers roared, ``Where, where?'' when the Prime Minister
apparently incautiously announced that some services already were improving. He
let them go on until they were hooked and then told them that 100 extra trains
had been added to Rail Southwest's timetable.
Faced with this soundbite-blunting defence, Mr Blair fell back on demanding a
guarantee that the existing level of services would not be cut - a guarantee BR
was never able to deliver - and dragged in VAT increases from somewhere in the
wings, a signal that the soundbite assault had failed to roll over the
objective.
Because we were one day short of breaking up for Christmas, things were a bit
rowdier - the children get excited about this time - but Prime Minister's
Questions is a form of trench warfare and, as it was on the Western Front, will
be, let us hope, mitigated over the actual day by signs of goodwill among the
resting combatants.

FIVE Liberal Democrat MPs have won the right to present all five Ten Minute
Rule Bills for which time was allocated in the Commons next month - by camping
out in sleeping bags in a Commons attic corridor last week to come first in the
queue.
They did it partly to ensure that the five subjects they chose get an airing
and also to highlight what they regard as the absurd procedures for determining
who wins the right to present such a Bill and make a 10-minute speech in
support of it.
Mr Archy Kirkwood (Roxburgh and Berwickshire), Mr Chris Davies (Littleborough
and Saddleworth), Mr Simon Hughes (Southwark and Bermondsey), Mr David Rendel
(Newbury) and Mr Paul Tyler (North Cornwall) spent last Thursday night in
sleeping bags. They were sustained by regular supplies of food and drink by
supporters and slept as best they could through the nearby chimes of Big Ben.
THE Government aims to safeguard the interests of the British steel industry in
a row over EU aid for Irish Steel, the Prime Minister insisted yesterday. He
was responding in the Commons to Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, who
called on the Prime Minister to say if he fully understood ``the damage that
could be done to British-Irish relations at a very crucial moment in the Irish
peace process''.
THE Prime Minister yesterday reaffirmed his Government's opposition to
legalising drugs, insisting he had ``no intention'' of lifting the ban on
cannabis.
Such a move was not the right way to proceed, he said
SPENDING by the Prime Minister's office has fallen, Mr Major disclosed last
night. The total cost in 1994-95, covering items including travel, telephones,
entertainment, staff and office refurbishment, was #7.67m, compared with #9.22m
the previous year, he said in a written reply.

THE schools' assisted places scheme is here to stay, Scottish Education
Minister Raymond Robertson said yesterday.
The issue was raised in a Commons committee the day after Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth announced plans for expanding the scheme in Scotland.
From the Labour Front Bench, Mrs Helen Liddell said that the scheme had risen
in cost from #800,000 in 1981-82 to #10.6m now.
She said: ``In government, we will phase out this scheme because we believe it
is inequitable and elitist and is an implied attack on the Scottish education
system.''
However, Mr Robertson said the case for the scheme was very strong and that the
Government was determined to continue it. It improved quality and standards,
widened the choice available to parents regardless of their income, expanded
opportunities for children and widened the social mix.

THE Prime Minister and Irish Premier John Bruton plan to meet in Dublin
tomorrow to try to keep the peace momentum going.
Last night, Mr Major and the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble spent an hour
at No. 10 discussing Ulster Unionist ideas for reinstating a Belfast assembly,
(writes Geoffrey Parkhouse).
The Ulster Unionists, who are now crucial to Mr Major's majority in the
Commons, are suggesting that a Belfast assembly could be the way forward to
allow them to talk to Sinn Fein in parallel with efforts now being made by the
independent commission headed by ex-US senator George Mitchell and his team -
who were in Dublin yesterday - to find a way to decommission IRA weapons.

GLASGOW Central MP Mike Watson was in hot water last night after failing to
vote in the crucial division while unpaired.
A Labour Whip, confirming to The Herald Mr Watson had not been paired, said:
``If you contact him before I do, tell him I want a word.''
Mr Watson returned on Monday from Barcelona,
where he went after his controversial selection last week as prospective
candidate for the Glasgow Govan constituency in which his opponent, Mr
Mohammed
Sarwar, contested the way the votes were counted.
When Mr Watson did not appear at Westminster yesterday Labour Whips began
frantic attempts to contact him before the vote but failed to do so.
He now faces a disciplinary meeting with Chief Whip Donald Dewar for failing
to
obey a three-line whip.
Last Thursday, Mr Watson was embroiled in a row after winning the nomination
for Glasgow Govan.
The manner of his victory and the size of his winning margin (one vote after a
count-back) led to demands for an appeal by supporters of Councillor Sarwar.
Labour's national executive committee will decide whether to investigate Mr
Sarwar's complaint when it meets on January 24.
Last night, inquiries to Mr Watson's home were being recorded on an answering
machine.

AN #8m investment planned at the Nigg yard in Easter Ross could create 800 jobs
by enabling it to penetrate new markets.
The initiative by BARMAC, the Brown &amp; Root and J Ray McDermott joint venture
company, is part of its plan to meet the challenges of the changing offshore
construction market.
It will take the company into the next century as one of Europe's leading
providers of energy-related construction services.
The BARMAC 2000 strategy proposes the development of the Nigg graving dock to
serve the growing need for floating production systems (FPS) and other dry-dock
services for the North-west Continental Shelf.
The company is also planning to seek work decommissioning redundant offshore
structures.
The Highlands and Islands Enterprise network, through Ross and Cromarty
Enterprise (RACE), is to kick start the development and take forward a bid for
more than #3m of vital European cash.
The company employs 1400 personnel at their Nigg and Ardersier yards and they
estimate a further 800 jobs could be created by the opportunities the
developments will bring.
``This potential major infrastructure investment is a clear indication of the
confidence our parent companies have in our ability to win a significant share
of growing new markets, of our employees' ability to adapt in order to
capitalise on these markets, and of our determination to build a sustainable
future for the yards,'' said BARMAC general manager Don Wright.
Ardersier will concentrate on servicing the reduced requirement for traditional
structures and Nigg and its graving dock will form the focus for the new
business segments.
Because FPS - normally ship-shaped structures through which fields produce -
are more economical for developing marginal fields, fields in deep or exposed
waters, and fields with poor access to existing infrastructure, they are
increasingly popular.
A conservative estimate of 26 fields will be developed using FPS in the North
Sea over the next five years.

CASES of mass murder by women are, fortunately, rare. The Rosemary West trial
filled pages of most newspapers for weeks and various family survivors continue
to provide gory details for eager readers.
Myra Hindley, who has at last admitted to being corrupt, wicked and evil, has
at least one supporter to remind us of the horrors of the Moors murders, lest
we forget.
Apart from the antics of sportsmen, soap stars, politicans and the royal
family, nothing fascinates the public more than a ``good'' murder story.
But mass murders by women are by no means a confined to modern times. Just over
a century ago, in 1889, Jessie King was tried at the High Court in Edinburgh
for the murder of three babies. There were no complex medical or legal issues
and the evidence was clear.
The case held nothing of the mystery and intrigue of the Madeleine Smith trial
with its ingredients of clandestine romance, arsenic and a Frenchman, which may
explain why it has not achieved the same notoriety.
The trial of Jessie King ended with almost inevitable verdicts of guilty on two
of the charges of murder. The jury took only four minutes to reach a unanimous
verdict and King was sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead.
The case gives us a glimpse of life in Victorian Edinburgh, particularly among
the lower classes.
The stigma and financial realities of illegitimacy were disastrous to girls who
``got themselves into trouble'' and none of the choices available was likely to
provide a happy solution.
The girl could return in shame to her parents if they would take her or she
could rely on the charity of the parish. Other options were infanticide,
illegal abortion with its great risks to health, trying to find the prospective
father and persuade him into marriage, having the child and trying to earn
money to support both mother and baby, often by  prostitution.
The other choice was to have the baby and arrange an adoption. Without the
advantage of social work departments this was usually a private arrangement and
it was not until 1930 that adoption was put on a formal basis as we now know it.
In a commercial transaction, a deal is easily struck if there is a willing
buyer and a desperate seller. Newspaper advertisements usually provided the
necessary link between the parties. For only a few pounds the girl could solve
her problem with only her conscience to trouble her.
We should bear in mind that antenatal care was probably non-existent in the
vast bulk of unwanted pregnancies and the risk of miscarriage was fairly high.
Many ``quacks'' were willing to provide a wide range of drugs in these
circumstances, with varying degrees of success. Professor Glaister's great
text-book Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology refers to a considerable traffic
in abortifacient drugs under barely disguised names such as ``Female remedies
for obstruction''.
Others resorted to the unskilled use of instruments with the accompanying risks
of septicaemia.
The trade of ``baby-farming'' seems to have been more popular in England but
the profits to be made attracted the attention of Jessie King and her elderly
lover, Thomas Pearson. It is not clear how many babies died in their care but
the matter came to the attention of police when some boys playing in the
Stockbridge area of Edinburgh found the body of an infant wrapped in an old
coat.
Inquiries led to Jessie and her lover being charged with the murder of three
children. Jessie admitted the murder of two of the infants but Thomas denied
his guilt.
At the trial he was more anxious to speak up and gave evidence as a prosecution
witness, saving his own neck from the rope and ensuring Jessie's conviction.
The evidence was clear and the Solicitor-General withdrew the third charge,
which she had not admitted. He had an easy task to convince the jury that the
only appropriate verdict was guilty of murder.
Following the best traditions of the Scottish Bar, counsel for King made a
creditable effort to suggest reasonable doubt and to persuade the jury to
consider the role the lover had played.
The Lord Justice Clerk painted a far from pretty picture of life behind the
public image of Edinburgh and indicated that the parents of these wretched
children must bear at least some moral reponsibility. But he made it clear that
if the jury accepted the evidence, it was enough to convict.
While awaiting execution in Calton Jail, Jessie made unsuccessful attempts at
beating the hangman by trying to strangle herself. Her mental health was
investigated, but she was pronounced fit to hang and the sentence was carried
out on March 11, 1889.
Just as, earlier in the century, Burke might have walked free if Hare had not
given evidence for the Crown, Jessie King might have escaped if her ``gallant''
lover had not shopped her.
Even today, the Crown Office faces a difficult task in deciding whether to use
guilty people to give evidence against their criminal associates, thus
rendering themselves immune from prosecution. It is expedient, but is it
justice?
Although Jessie King's trial was not complex, the Crown took great care to
obtain the best possible forensic evidence. It would have been easy to jump to
conclusions in a case of suspected child murder and in the case of very poor
people some babies who died of natural causes were disposed of very casually to
avoid expense.
The case was notable for the eminence of the doctors involved - Dr Henry
Littlejohn and his son, Harvey, who succeeded him in the Chair of Forensic
Medicine at Edinburgh University, and Dr Joseph Bell, the ``original'' Sherlock
Holmes.
It was also the first trial attended by William Roughead W.S, the eminent
chronicler of crime, who covered every murder trial, bar one, at the High Court
in Edinburgh for the next 60 years. He missed one because he happened to be on
holiday in Arran at the date of the trial.
Just as in 1889, there are still many unwanted children around the world and a
final thought for 1995 can be found in the Gospel according to St Mark:
``Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not.''

THE Rev Andrew McLellan's hysterical reply (December 18) to Stewart Lamont's
article on the Asylum Bill is long on rhetoric and short on facts.
The point the article made, quite correctly, was that a large number of people
are abusing the system to gain entry to Britain unlawfully. I think that is a
perfectly legitimate comment to make.
Mr McLellan does not answer the allegation that Glasgow Presbytery was
railroaded into a motion opposing the Asylum Bill by two of his fellow
activists. Is that because it is true?
To long-suffering church members like myself it seems that the convenership of
the Church and Nation Committee has become a platform for clerics with a
leftward leaning who do not necessarily reflect the views of the body of the
Kirk.
Incidentally, since Stewart Lamont's article only appeared on Saturday Mr
McLellan must have friends in The Herald to have his letter published on a
Monday morning.
J M Anderson,
7 Victoria Park Gardens South,
Glasgow.
I WAS disappointed to read in The Herald (December 16 and 18) of two well-known
Church of Scotland ministers exchanging insults in this season of goodwill.
Without going into the rights and wrongs of the matter, what concerned me most
of all was the way in which the World Mission and Unity Committee dealt with
the situation at the meeting of Glasgow Presbytery on December 12.
In fact, their report was dealt with near the end of the meeting. There was
nothing in print before the Presbytery, so that an informed discussion could
take place.
I have reason to believe that the Presbytery Council were unaware that the
Mission and Unity Committee were to raise this important issue. If they had
known, I think it would have been placed nearer the top of the agenda, rather
than nearer the bottom.
The Presbytery's World Mission and Unity Committee ought to be rapped over the
knuckles!
Rev John Jolly,

IN response to the letter by the Rev Maxwell Craig about the proposed
withdrawal of benefits from asylum seekers (December 12), I write to say that I
will not be writing to my MP as he requests. This, I trust, is not because I am
indifferent to the plight of the disadvantaged or to the unfairness of the law.
It is because I have no faith in his proposed method of putting the world to
rights.
The commission that Jesus gave to his church as I understand the New Testament,
was not to pressurise governments, but to preach the gospel.

THE Rev Stewart Lamont's article on asylum (December 16) does justice neither
to his subject nor to himself.
It is regrettable that he should stoop to question the integrity of those of us
within the Scottish churches who have challenged the proposals to withdraw
benefit from certain important categories of asylum seekers.
But it is more serious that he should give such a confused and confusing
account of the issue. Limits of space unfortunately mean it is possible to deal
with only some of the points where Mr Lamont goes wrong!
First, the issue of withdrawal of benefits, the subject of regulations due to
be debated and decided by Parliament this week and to come into force on
January 6, is totally separate, as Mr Lamont clearly fails to appreciate, from
the proposals (equally open to criticism, as it happens) in the Bill currently
before Parliament.
Secondly, this is not a protest orchestrated by a small group of zealots, as Mr
Lamont implies. The proposals have been criticised by a wide range of
charitable organisations and public bodies, including the official
representatives of all the main British churches.
Thirdly, Mr Lamont's suggestion that Britain's system is somehow being
exploited by a host of immigrant opportunists is unworthy. There is already
widespread concern at the low rate of Home Office acceptance of applications
for asylum. The withdrawal of benefits will cause much further suffering among
many innocent and vulnerable people.
The proposals will in effect remove the right of appeal against the refusal of
asylum and are arguably in breach of the UK's obligations under the 1951 UN
Convention on the Status of Refugees. It is entirely appropriate that those
concerned about justice and hospitality should speak out against them - and
particularly at this time of year.

Glasgow-Berlin analogy
HOW can Michael Fry (December 13) still be sniggering at communists in 1995?
OK, so their big experiment behind the Iron Curtain didn't work, but you don't
have to look very far to see signs that our own, under the Iron Lady, hasn't
exactly been a runaway success. Perhaps we'll soon turn our back on failure too.
His analogy between Glasgow and Berlin could be stretched a little further.
Glasgow's so-called socialist administration seems pledged, amid the
triumphalism of its public-relations coups, to reproduce here the ``desperate
dilapidation and bold brutalism'' of post-war East Berlin, by failing to
address housing problems, continuing to demolish fine old buildings, and
bulldozing motorways into the heart of the city: what Mr Fry might call
``socialist planning'' run amok.
We would do well to turn our back on that failure too, and as Deyan Sudjic,
Glasgow's new ``1999'' director, says, treat our city with respect (December
12). and that includes Mr Pat Lally refraining from cheap remarks about Glasgow
becoming ``the Vienna of the north''.
Berlin, by the way, has a healthy tradition of voting communist: it elected a
communist mayor the same year that Hitler came to power. Why don't we follow
its example of bucking the national trend, by throwing out not only the failed
Tories at Westminster, but also tired old Labour in Glasgow?

MADRID: A bogus gynaecologist who treated more than 11,000 women was cleared by
a court in northern Spain yesterday of fraud, falsifying documents, and
illegally using a professional title.
The court at San Sebastian gave a three-year suspended sentence to imposter
Jose Luis Fernandez, 44, saying his practical knowledge and dedication made up
for his lack of formal training. He had practised for 14 years, four of them at
a leading hospital in Barcelona, before being exposed.
Crowd gassed
LAGOS: Nigerian police fired teargas yesterday to disperse a crowd that
gathered for a rally in the commercial capital Lagos to demand an immediate
return to democracy, witnesses said. In London, an action group of the
Commonwealth, which expelled Nigeria following the execution of nine human
rights activists, said fresh punitive steps might be needed.
Trial put off
TEL AVIV: An Israeli court put off the trial of Yitzhak Rabin's self-confessed

would have time to study the evidence.
Briton falls
TOKYO: A 37-year-old British businessman visiting Japan fell to his death from
a fourth-floor office window, police said. Geoffrey Till, a car-parts company
executive of Witney, Oxfordshire, was found on Monday outside the offices of a
Japanese firm where he was to have had a meeting. Police suspected suicide.

HONG KONG: Britain has dismissed a Chinese demand to exclude Hong Kong Governor
Chris Patten from the ceremonial handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Beijing has
demonstrated its dislike of the governor with a series of attacks, but Hugh
Davies, head of the British team responsible for the handover, said: ``Clearly
the governor is a major participant.''
q.A South Korean woman welcomed as Hong Kong's 10 millionth visitor for this

travel cheques, and two air tickets to come back again.
Celluloid sales
NEW YORK: The green army uniform worn by Tom Hanks in the film Forrest Gump
sold for #11,215 at a sale in New York of film and television memorabilia.
Other big sellers were Greta Garbo's love letters to actor Gilbert Roland,
which went for more than #11,000, and a pair of boxing shorts worn by Sylvester
Stallone in the 1976 film Rocky, which fetched more than #7100, doubling
estimates.
Leader `critical'
ATHENS: Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, in hospital for a month, was
fighting off a new secondary infection and his condition had worsened. Hospital
sources were reported as saying his condition was critical.
All bets off
PARIS: A strike at the French equivalent of the Tote entered its sixth day
yesterday, depriving thousands of would-be punters of a flutter. A spokesman
for the state-run Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU) said the strike, over salaries and
jobs, had affected the system's computer network.
Dini set to quit
ROME: An aide said Prime Minister Lamberto Dini would offer his resignation on
December 30, opening the way to a parliamentary debate in the New Year on
Italy's political future. Dini has led a technocrat government since the
collapse of media magnate     Silvio Berlusconi's coalition government last
January.

PROFESSOR J Hume Adams finds no cause for concern about possible transmission
of BSE to humans as CJD because he understands that there are now strict
controls in abattoirs dealing with the use of brain, spinal cord, and eye
tissues for beefburgers, etc (December 14).
The Government has admitted that recent spot checks in abattoirs have shown
that almost half of them were not complying with correct procedures, and that
in 17 cases breaches of regulations have allowed machanically recovered spinal
cord tissue to get into meat products for human consumption.
Professor Adams also assures us that ``a considerable amount'' of infectious
brain tissue is needed even to transmit BSE to another cow by ingestion - a
degree of imprecision that seems remarkable from a scientist.
The curiously phlegmatic attitude adopted by the authorities to this potential
danger contrasts markedly with the plethora of thou-shalt-nots we got at the
start of the Aids score.

Washington, Tuesday
CIA chief John Deutch today predicted a worldwide surge in terrorism in the
next decade and said he was shifting US spy resources to help meet the threat.
``I regret that I have come to the conclusion there is going to be tremendous
growth in terrorism over the next decade or so, not only directed towards
Americans but throughout the world,'' he told the House of Representatives
Intelligence Committee.
Deutch said the forecast rise in terrorism would have ``immense impact on how
we conduct our foreign policy, immense impact on how American businesses
operate abroad''.
Replying to a question about the threat, the head of the Central Intelligence
Agency did not discuss why he expected a surge nor pinpoint the possible
perpetrators.
However in his opening statement he said: ``It is my judgment that ideologies
and regimes inimical to democracy will continue to exist. Examples today are
Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.''
He also cited unspecified transnational groups involved in drug running,
organised crime, and terrorism.
Deutch said the CIA and its sister US intelligence agencies were shifting
resources to cope with the threat.
He called for a halt in criticism of the CIA's covert operations arm, derided
in recent years for bungled operations, from the discovery of a Moscow mole in
its midst to bribing bureaucrats for trade secrets in Paris.-Reuter.

MONEY is the universal solvent; everything can be turned into money that is
either a gain or a loss, remarked Lord Neaves in 1874.
For David Ashby it looks like being a vary large loss indeed. As the Tory MP
wept into his hands in the High Court yesterday, he had to start coming to
terms with two things. First, after a lurid 20-day courtroom battle which has
turned him from an undistinguished backbencher to a reluctant household name,
he had lost his libel action against the Sunday Times. The court had decided
that the ``family from Hell'' was an unkind but apparently not inaccurate
sobriquet. So no ``universal solvent'' for David Ashby. But there was worse to
come.
Ashby, a Lloyd's ``name'' who has admitted he has financial problems, now faces
a costs bill (his own, plus that of the newspaper) unofficially estimated at
#500,000.
Some astronomically large payouts in the English courts in recent years have
encouraged those who believe their reputations to have been impuned to seek
redress through a libel case. In 1989 a jury awarded former Tory party deputy
chairman Lord Aldington #1.5m over allegations by Count Nicolai Tolstoy, the
largest libel award ever.
Better known perhaps is the case brought by another former holder of that post,
Lord Archer, who won #500,000 over allegations in the Daily Star, then gave the
lot to charity. But the price of failure, and even the price of success, can be
enormous. Not only has the individual had to tolerate the wide circulation of
minute details of their private lives, but they are likely to be landed with a
crippling bill for the legal costs. Bill Roache, Coronation Street's Ken
Barlow, won #50,000 damages because the Sun claimed he was boring in real life
as well as in his role, but was then confronted with a legal bill for #120,000
because he failed to win costs.
The operation of the law on defamation is another instance in which it is hard
for the Scots not to sound smug, though slighted individuals may not agree.
While the English system is sympathetic to the fragile ego, Scots law takes a
more robust view of defamation. Martin Smith, one of the few lawyers in
Scotland with extensive experience in libel cases says: ``In Scotland you get
next to nothing for having your reputation damaged. This is because you have to
prove loss, and that isn't easy. Jeffrey Archer would have got very little up
here.''
Also, while all cases in England have to go through the High Court, in Scotland
most go through the Sheriff Court. For the Scots client, this has the advantage
of making the costs considerably less but the likely payout is also likely to
be less. In Scotland, only about one defamation case a year is heard in the
Court of Session (the Scottish equivalent of the High Court).
The second big difference is that while the English system often uses juries to
decide both the merits of the case and the level of damages, in Scotland the
use of a jury for a libel hearing, even in Court of Session cases, is
relatively rare. Juries are likely to award considerably higher damages.
In Scotland the record for libel damages is #50,000. It is held by Lillian
Winter, who had sued News Scotland Ltd for an article in the Sun alleging that
she had been caught having sex with an inmate at Glenochil prison, where she
was employed as a prison officer. Significantly, this case was heard by a jury.
Before the Winter case, the highest personal payout for defamation had been
#7500 to seamen's union leader Sam McCluskie for allegations made in a series
of letters by one of his members.
The combination of low damages awards and facing the legal costs, for which
there is no legal aid, mean that only about 5% of Scots defamation cases ever
make it to court.
Smith says a typical cost of taking a case to court is #5000 but if you lose
you can get landed with the defender's costs, so you can double that.
A libel action has been described as a toy that allows the rich to sue the rich
with the proceeds being trousered by the legal profession. Even in Scotland,
that's not too wide of the mark.

IT IS a rare occasion when this column gets itself accused of culture. We are
neither noticeably Doric nor Ionic, after all, more a sort of long streak
propping up the far side of the page with a pediment that leaves something to
be desired. But if the Scottish Arts Council is to be believed we are, in our
own modest way, one small pillar in the mighty edifice that is Scotland's
cultural industry.
According to a report issued by the council earlier this week, the country is
pediculous with folk earning their bread from the arts and culture. There are
more of us dancing, singing, painting, acting, scribbling, and generally
creating than there are primary teachers, shipbuilders, or whisky workers.
Indeed, in some sectors cultural activity is more intense in Scotland than it
is in any part of Britain outside London. And two cheers for that.
Purists among you might wonder, certainly after wading through this week's
assault on the frontiers of syntax, what journalists are doing among the
cultural and cultured. The problem of definition aside - what else would you
call us that wasn't merely obscene? - it might seem odd that those paid to pick
over the culture are themselves described as cultural producers.
But there it is: the SAC says so and the SAC, we must presume, knows whereof it
speaks.
That aside, however, its report seems to support the claim, long advertised but
never proven, that Scotland has enjoyed something of a cultural renaissance in
recent decades. Long ago MacDiarmid argued that cultural nationalism might be
the prerequisite for political nationalism, rather than vice versa, and here we
are with what appears to be a boom in (broadly speaking) the arts.
Does this mean that political self-determination will inevitably follow? The
Irish experience seems to suggest as much, though as Ireland has shown,
cultural resurgences seem to lose much of their puff once independence has been
achieved. Nevertheless, it is tempting to believe that self-confidence in the
arts and media, never mind employment, will one day be rewarded with a free
state to accompany its free spirit.
FOR that reason, perhaps, the SAC's findings for those sectors in which
Scotland does not outperform the rest of the UK are doubly interesting. Authors
and artists (even journalists) may flourish: what are we to make of the
broadcasters? According to the SAC, culling its information from the 1991
Census, Scotland's share of employment in the radio, television, and theatre
sector amounts to only 5% of the UK total. True, the figures for the film and
book trades amount to only 4% and 2% respectively, but these industries are not
governed by legislation to the same extent as broadcasting.
Equally, the BBC has a ``federated'' structure designed explicitly, so we are
told, to recognise Scotland's distinctiveness as a ``national region'', while
the regional structure of ITV (Channel Four always excepted) is meant to ensure
that the Scottish stations get their share of the revenue cake, if not the work.
Yet plainly, in terms of employment and production, the gravitational pull of
London remains stronger than any politician's good intentions. At the very
least our share of the jobs should match our share of the population, but it
does not. In film, meanwhile, Scotland's manifold attractions as a location
have done little to revive the local industry.
The parallels are tempting. BBC federalism and ITV's periodic efforts at
devolution have yet to produce the sort of results generally claimed for their
political equivalents. As other cultural activities show, Scotland has the
human resources but, in broadcasting, few of the rewards.
It is the culture's equivalent to North Sea oil, an export trade in ideas,
people, and skills.
Other areas of the UK could make the same claims, of course, but that is hardly
the point. The SAC's report indicates unusual signs of cultural activity in
Scotland at a time when, politically, the pot is beginning to bubble again. Yet
in broadcasting, where the idea of Britain remains strong (where else do you
hear of the ``national'', meaning British, news?), even federal structures have
failed to ameliorate the problem.
There may just be a lesson in this. After all, the substance at issue is the
same whether the debate is about politics or culture: power is the key. You can
have it granted by London, or even by a distant ``network centre'', or you can
achieve it for yourself. And sometimes the only way to do that is by toppling a
few old, familiar pillars.

AND they called it puppy love. A youth appeared recently at a sheriff court
(let's just say somewhere in central Scotland) on the bizarre charge of having
sex with a neighbour's dog, and was ordered to be detained.
Apparently, before the hearing his mother arrived at court and spotted her
offspring across the room. She enquired as to why he was there and expressed
outrage when she learned the nature of the charge. ``The neighbour's dog!'' she
exclaimed. ``That's ridiculous. We've got a dug of oor ain.'' The unfortunate
youth then lodged a bail appeal, later withdrawn with the explanation that he
felt safer if he wasn't allowed to return home because his father was a boxer.
Life's a bitch
AT the risk of causing more offence to true dog lovers and descending further
into the depths of depravity, we could also record the activities of Monty,
erstwhile fox terrier owned by my distinguished colleague Robbie Dinwoodie, The
Herald's first Devil's Advocate.
Monty's concupiscent attentions extended beyond canine targets to another
family pet, the neutered cat, sometimes al fresco and often in flagrante in
front of the neighbours or dinner party guests.
Even intelligent humans, so-called sentient beings from a higher evolutionary
order, can take coupling activities beyond the pale. Students of one Scottish
academic, noted for his freelance frolics with all and sundry, once defined the
limits he would go to in search of sexual gratification. ``Anything with a
pulse,'' they said.
Spot the
difference
AN Asian shopkeeper was giving evidence at the High Court in Edinburgh after an
incident at his premises involving a number of young men. The men in the dock
were white and the shopkeeper was asked to look round the court to see whether
he could recognise anyone who had entered his shop at the relevant time.
He was having obvious difficulty in picking anyone out and explained: ``It is
like you get in China. All the people look the same.''
Barking
IN another case in the same court, a witness conceded that his regular drug
habit had perhaps caused a slowing down of his thought processes. ``Do you
remember August 5,'' he was asked. ``I don't remember August,'' he responded.
Dog's dinner
ONE thing's for sure if the SNP ever delivers its independent Scotland:
there'll be no shortage of work for lawyers. The proposed Bill of Rights alone
has enough guarantees to sustain a million working lunches and countless
careers: free health care, housing, benefits, trade unions, and fair and decent
renumeration for work and conditions that respect the dignity of the person.
There's also a tilt to yoof power: the voting age shifts down to 16 and even
leisure is liberated. The Bill would guarantee access to go roamin' in the
gloamin' anywhere in Scotland and to swear back at any obstructive landowner in
Gaelic, broad Scots or Urdu.
Even the miserable likes of the Diary get protection with freedom of the press,
which presumably means that in the world of news hounds, dog can still eat dog.
Hair of the......
AS this is the last Devil's Advocate before the festive season, we would like
to wish all our contributors and readers a very Merry Christmas, subject to the
usual rubric of contentment before capacity when addressing the sherry or
whisky bottle. That way you should avoid feeling rough, rough the next day. The
Diary's New Year resolution will be to let sleeping four-legged friends lie. No
more shaggy dog stories in 1996. Promise.

THE recent Caithness referendum and Scottish opinion poll have decisively shown
local and national opposition to nuclear reprocessing at Dounreay.
Mr John Baxter, director of Dounreay, arrogantly sought to dismiss such views
as being rushed, and ``not the way to judge whether the community understands
what we do and is content with it''.
Yet the Dounreay management were prepared to rush into a contract for the
reprocessing with no consultation whatever, and furthermore withheld (again)
information about contamination and problems at the plant.
FoE Scotland has been calling for the same extensive consultation process to be
conducted in Scotland as in the US.
We are confident that such consultation would show, as the referendum and poll
have done, how out of touch with Scottish opinion Mr Baxter is. It is time for
the people of Scotland to be listened to.

YOUR report on the public inquiry over the fate of the Dupplin Cross near
Forteviot amazes me (December 13).
In the first place the matter does not appear to have been aired nationally on
any previous occasion. That having been said, your report states, ``Villagers
and experts are agreed that the cross should be removed.......'' This beggars
understanding.
Putting aside the avarice of the National Museum in Edinburgh, is there no
person or organisation left in our beleaguered country capable of fostering the
concept that our ancient monuments in their original settings inspire informed
visitors, who tend to return, to explore Scotland beyond the dubious delights
of Edinburgh, Scott Country, Alloway, and the Whisky Trail?
Move the Dupplin Cross? Whatever for? Put a weatherproof glazed cage round and
over it as was done with Sueno's Stone in Forres.
Such a scheme would cost a great deal less than #56,000 and a plastic replica,
and might even attract a portion of the money wasted on the National Lottery.

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer may enjoy the way in which the OECD has
endorsed the direction of his projections for the UK economy in the next two
years, but the Paris-based organisation is somewhat less optimistic as to the
precise figures. It suggests somewhat less growth and somewhat more inflation,
but it does notice how the British economy has become less prone to inflation
these past few years - and more than the Chancellor will be gratified by that
observation. Both sets of forecasts do note how the build-up of stocks could
affect eventual outcomes. For both sets, therefore, the behaviour of consumers
is vital.
Economies aren't by nature dynamic and all forecasts have to be hedged. The
Chancellor's are widely recognised as being optimistic - they reflect his
personality as well as the data - but the OECD's were arrived at before the
latest interest-rate reduction. Modest though that was, it does reinforce Mr
Clarke's case, which will be further strengthened if, as is likely, more
reductions follow in the spring. Such changes could be enough to bridge most of
the gap between the two lots of figures, though both are really dependent on
movements in the international economy. Britain's dependence on exports makes
what happens in the United States and Germany, two very important customers,
extremely significant for us, though there are few ways in which any British
chancellor can directly influence American or German decisions.
Long before the next two years have passed local events will endorse one or
other of these projections. An early example would be the Christmas retail
figures and the extent to which their spending is financed by credit. These
will be known by January, but people who can ``feel'' economic trends will have
formed an opinion before Ne'erday.

``Eight-Hundred Films Reviewed and Rated: Barry Norman's Plums and Turkeys''
announces the cover of the festive Radio Times.
Yet within the amazing variety of films listed there are only three that could
even vaguely be described as Scottish. One is the international movie
Highlander with Sean Connery, and two are wonderful comedies with Scottish
subjects - Whisky Galore &amp; The Maggie - but comedies whose genesis is
definitely from south of the Border.
Next year is the year of the centenary of cinema, and follows probably the best
yet for Scottish film with two international block busters - Rob Roy and
Braveheart - an Oscar (for Peter Capaldi's Franz Kafka, which was produced in
the BBC-supported Tartan Shorts series) and a highly successful low-budget
movie, Shallow Grave. But if our industry is only capable of providing less
than half of one per cent of movies that television chooses to show at the most
intensively viewed part of the year, then we are still going nowhere.
There is probably more optimism in the Scottish film community now than there
has been for a generation. Even Michael Forsyth's experience of being booed in
and booed out of the Braveheart premiers in his own constituency has not turned
the Secretary of State away from ordering a major study into Scottish film to
be published next year. But while Michael Forsyth is good at listening - it
seems to have been his big idea of 1995 - like the rest of the Tories he has
been pretty poor about doing anything with what he hears.
A case in point is a decision waiting on his desk regarding the future of the
Scottish film institutions. In the first half of this year the Scottish Office
reviewed the role of the Scottish Film Council and it was anticipated that the
results of this review would be published this autumn.
Nothing has happened, although the report is believed to have been in draft
form as early as August.
Among the speculation is that the review confirms the view of many in Scotland
that what we need is a new agency, provisionally entitled Scottish Screen.
Scottish Screen would draw together the diverse bodies that now exist - the
film council, the Production Fund, the Training Trust, and Scottish Screen
Locations - into a single ``super authority'' to develop policy and implement
it.
So far so good. Scotland does not need a single body, but that body needs power
and resources. It cannot be just a makeover of the Scottish Film Council, which
is on a promising new path but which has a remit that is largely cultural and
educational.
Scottish Screen needs to be able to tackle some of the structural problems that
exist - and these are primarily commercial issues. A weak physical
infrastructure (specifically the lack of a full sound stage), lack of expertise
in marketing and distribution, and a stronger ability to attract investment are
some of the areas that need urgent action. And despite the excellent work of
the Scottish Film Production Fund and the Glasgow Development Agency (which has
lead public policy in the absence of interest from Scottish Enterprise at a
national level) there needs to be more money made available for project
development.
Most of all Scotland needs to establish a ``film-friendly'' environment, and
this needs management and promotion by one agency. The context should be set by
politicians - particularly the tax context, where Scotland is crying out for an
initiative like the Irish ``Section 35'' which allows tax write-offs for
investment. The practical steps that come after have to be taken by film
professionals.
The need for that film-friendly environment can be seen clearly in the
Braveheart experience. The Section 35 money was only the final incentive that
tipped the balance. Ireland's inspired film minister, Michael D Higgins, was
able to offer Mel Gibson co-operation at every level of Irish life - from the
use of the Army for battle scenes (suitably scaled up by the wonders of
computer graphics) down to access to the Irish countryside. Despite the hard
work and enthusiasm of Scotland's film administrators, our country could not
match that commitment.
A real Scottish Screen would be a body established from the media industries,
involving professionals from television and film. There is no need for it to be
yet another quango - it can be created by federating existing organisations on
an equal basis and supplementing them with other small commercially orientated
bodies, keenly targeted towards specific developmental tasks. It would be
motivated by the vision of a sustainable, competitive Scottish film industry
and sustained by the tax incentives that will encourage production.
Such an initiative will need money, political will, and freedom from
interference from south of the Border, where the Department of National
Heritage jealously guards the right and privileges of the studio-based London
film industry.
Next year could be the year of the real revival - the long-term revival - of
the Scottish film industry. All it will take is the courage and vision to make
it happen.
Then we can get the world watching our plums and turkeys at Christmas, and reap
the benefit of them every day of the year.

THIS is being written the morning after The Herald's editorial Christmas party,
I am afraid. So I do not feel quite up to contemplating, as is my wont, one of
the great issues of our time. Instead, let me give you a question for your
games of Trivial Pursuit over the festive weekend: who, beside the Scots, are
the only haggis-eating people on earth?
I shall supply the answer straightaway, since I would guess that not one in a
million could have the remotest inkling of it. The answer is the people of the
Rhineland Palatinate, one of the smallest and surely the sleepiest of the
German Lnder.
In its sleepiness it is, and this is why I like it, decidedly unGerman. I have
got to know it quite well because a friend of mine lives there with his family,
and I visited them again a couple of weeks ago. When I first met him, sharing
digs at Hamburg University, Wolfgang was a workaholic Prussian, though with a
substratum of humanity which might be brought out if only he could be persuaded
to get drunk. He was also - how shall we put this? - just a wee bit right wing.
His parents had been expelled from Silesia by the Poles at the end of the
Second World War, and neither they nor he had ever forgiven it. At least it
provided the stuff of discussion far into the night.
He grew up into a nuclear physicist, but the problem for nuclear physicists is
that after the age of 40 they become a trifle superannuated: the theoretical
flair is gone, the mathematical imagination fades, all the really creative work
is being done by younger brains. Wolfgang has become not only superannuated but
also, to coin a phrase, palatinated.
One reason why the Palatinate is so sleepy is that on a good many days a good
many of its citizens are coping with a hangover. It is wine-growing country, a
fact of which they take full advantage. As soon as I arrived, late on a Friday
night after a hellish journey from snowbound Berlin, bottles of rather peculiar
red champagne were opened: one for me, one for Wolfgang.
At breakfast we refreshed ourselves with copious draughts of what used to be
Oscar Wilde's favourite tipple, hock-and-seltzer, now ultra-trendy in this
country under the name of Spritzer and known to the Germans as Scholle. The
copious draughts continued through the morning, and by lunchtime I was feeling
a little woozy. At this point Wolfgang insisted on our jumping into his car.
Freezing fog lay thick over the Rhine Valley but he drives, as all Germans do,
like a thing possessed. Within 10 minutes we were, doubtless thanks to my
prayers, at his favourite vintner's.
The scene there was much like a Glasgow pub on a Friday night.
A crowd of locals, bright-eyed and red-cheeked in the fug, had obviously been
at it for some time. Vintners provide a room for the tasting of their product,
and they are generous. At least two dozen bottles were set out, with more
available when any was empty. You could drink as much as you liked for free.
Obviously there was an expectation that a case of something would be bought
before leaving, but no pressure on that point. As I said, it is all decidedly
unGerman.
Why are the people of the Palatinate like this? Probably because they live on a
frontier, or on three to be precise. Down the centuries they have had armies
trampling all over them, so have decided there are better things to do than
worry about the great issues of the time. The culture is resolutely
proletarian. As far as I can discover this land, almost uniquely, contains no
opera house; it prefers karaoke and country and western. The local daily, Die
Rheinpfalz, makes the Aberdeen Press and Journal look cosmopolitan. Each Monday
it carries eight pages of reports on junior football. And everyone is
fanatically devoted to Kaiserslautern, the Raith Rovers of Germany.
If all this has a familiar ring, it may be worth pointing out that the
Palatinate is traditionally Calvinist too. In fact the Reformation can be said
to have started here, in the town of Worms, where Martin Luther was arraigned
before the Imperial Diet and said: ``Here I stand. I can do no other.''
In principle it was no doubt a good thing to possess the true religion, but in
practice it had, in the centre of Europe, certain disadvantages, by attracting
the attention of the trampling armies. The trouble started in 1620 when the
Elector Palatine, Frederick V, tried to claim the Crown of Bohemia and set off
the Thirty Years' War. In his own country, two centuries of devastation
followed.
It is interesting that Frederick was married to a Scots lassie, Elizabeth,
daughter of James VI. Hence, perhaps, the haggis. As the evening of our boozy
Saturday drew on, I said to Wolfgang that I would like to taste some
specialities of the region. With his wife at the wheel this time, we drove to a
restaurant in the charming village of Freinsheim.
The starter on the set menu was Schmalz, bread and dripping, and very toothsome
too: did I not say that the culture was resolutely proletarian? A salad of
lamb's lettuce followed, a bit twee by British standards but as common as
cabbage in the Palatinate. Then came its culinary pride and joy, Saumagen. This
translates as sow's stomach. It is indeed a pork haggis, but on just the same
formula as any made from a sheep: the innards are chopped up and stuffed inside
the bag to be cooked. The result is tastier than our version, and amply
testifies to the sterling qualities of the people who invented it.

MANY part-time workers can now no longer be treated as conveniently expendable
employees, open to instant dismissal without compensation when business is
having a hard time. This year, the UK Government has given them the protection
to which they are entitled by European Community Law.
The importance of part-time employment on Britain's commerce and industry has
grown significantly over the past decade and the supposedly caring 90s have
seen a steady drift away from full-time employment, with more and more jobs
being filled by part-time workers.
To some extent that may be because, until relatively recently, part-time
employees working more than eight but less than 16 hours per week were required
to work for five years before qualifying for the protection afforded after two
years' service to their full-time colleagues.
Those working less than eight hours per week never could enjoy that protection,
which may have made them attractive to an employer seeking to retain
flexibility without the risk of incurring liabilities when a downturn in trade
might force redundancies.
However, a sea change in the fortunes of part-time workers has occurred in the
past 18 months, following a decision of the House of Lords in March last year.
They held that the provisions of the Employment Protection Consolidation Act
1978 governing eligibility for redundancy payments were incompatible with the
provisions of Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome and European Community Equality
Law.
They also found that those provisions of the Act subjecting employees with less
than 16 hours service per week to different conditions for compensation for
unfair dismissal were also incompatible with EU equality law.
The Government subsequently took steps to rectify the position by issuing the
Employment Protection (Part-time Employees) Regulations 1995, effective from
February 6 this year. They repeated various provisions of the 1978 Act so that
part-time service, regardless of the number of hours worked per week, now
counts in computing an employee's continuous employment, both for the purposes
of unfair dismissal protection and in establishing the right to a redundancy
payment.
This is a somewhat radical change in the law relating to part-time workers and
it is clear that not all employers have yet got the message. The lack of
protection, which existed until the introduction of the new regulations, had
engendered a casual approach to the treatment of such employees and there was,
to some extent, a general feeling that when times were hard they were
expendable.
Equally, in a disciplinary situation, whereas a full-time worker, with more
than two years service would have to be treated fairly and reasonably, the
employer could, generally speaking, still afford to be somewhat cavalier in
regard to part-time personnel, who either had not yet qualified for protection
or never could.
All that has changed. Today, all employees have the same rights, whether they
work one or 50 hours a week. That is something which employers must now grasp.
The extension of the rights of part-time workers does not stop there. Those
same qualifying thresholds used also to apply to maternity rights, but changes
introduced by the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 conferred
significant rights on all women expecting a baby on or after October 16, 1994.
Since that date, all women, no matter whether they are full-time or part-time
employees, what hours they work each week, or how long they have been employed,
have the right to 14 weeks' maternity leave. Under the 1995 regulations, the
qualifying limits for extended maternity leave have also been harmonised and,
accordingly, all women employees with more than two years service are entitled
to extended maternity absence, delaying their return to work for up to 29 weeks
from the beginning of the week in which their baby is born.
Another right enjoyed by part-time workers is the right to protection from
dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy, for which all women employees now
qualify regardless of their hours of work or length of employment. It is also
automatically unfair to dismiss any employee, regardless of hours worked,
length of service or age, if the reason, or principal reason, for dismissal is
that he or she has sought to rely on certain of their statutory rights.
There have also been changes to the rules on Health and Safety, which apply
equally to part-time employees, and the 1995 Finance Act introduced changes to
make part-time employees equally eligible to participate in profit-related pay
and profit-sharing schemes, employee share-ownership trusts, share option
schemes, and savings-related share-option schemes.
To add to the employer's nightmare, the two-year qualifying threshold itself
has come under attack of late with a recent decision of the English Court of
Appeal questioning its justification.
That case is currently on appeal to the House of Lords but it leaves the law in
a somewhat confused state. If it is decided that the unfair dismissal
compensation is to be deemed ``pay'' under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome,
employees with less than two years service would probably have the right to
make unfair dismissal claims. That right may already be said to extend to some
employees in the public sector, due to the ``direct effect'' of the EU Equal
Treatment Directive.
Taken together, this all adds up to the fact that, no matter how long an
employee has been employed or how many hours each week he or she works, any
decisions taken affecting them must be arrived at very carefully against a
background of up-to-date advice. Employment law, particularly that relating to
part-time workers, is in a fluid state and represents a real danger to any
employer who chooses to ignore these new-found rights.

ACCORDING to your recent reports the misinformed public are unwilling to
consume good Scotch beef due to an unjustifiable fear of BSE and yet they are
willing to eat cheese made from unpasteurised (raw) milk which contains
listeria monocytogenes.
Once I had to sign a death certificate for a new-born baby dead of listeria
monocytogenes meningitis, passed on from the mother who had almost certainly
consumed listeria.
As some will know, pregnant women are routinely instructed to avoid certain
cheeses until after delivery because of this risk.
Large outbreaks of salmonellosis due to unpasteurised milk encouraged the
decision to make it illegal to sell unpasteurised milk in Scotland
Now, because of the greater risk of infection, it is time to make it illegal to
sell cheese made from such milk.
For these reasons there are those who will sympathise with Clydesdale District
Council and it is unhelpful for Arthur Bell to pursue them for doing their duty.
But again, maybe he is just another misinformed member of the public.

EPLORE your cheap attack on Bob Maclennan (December 15). In defending Dounreay
he has been doing what every MP should do. That is defend, when necessary and
as far as possible, the major employers of his constituents.
You imply that it is inappropriate to reprocess American nuclear ``muck'' at
Dounreay. All the nuclear ``muck'' from Scotland's hospitals and nuclear power
stations is processed in England. Would it not follow that this is
inappropriate?
You mention the leadership of a farmer in this campaign to undermine one of
Caithness's major employers. Would it not be more appropriate for a Caithness
farmer to direct his efforts to assisting Bob Maclennan in defending Caithness
beef farmers from fellow scaremongers?
Terry Jones,
3 Bridge of Westfield,
Thurso.
THE sneers in your editorial on December 15 were unworthy both of your
newspaper and of the target, Robert Maclennan, MP for Caithness and Sutherland.
He is respected across the party political spectrum as a very able and
thoughtful individual.
It is only the local recognition of his basic integrity and of his hard work on
behalf of his constituents that has ensured his re-election as MP for Caithness
and Sutherland in every General Election since 1966, regardless of national
party trends or negative press comment.

CONDITIONS at the Royal Edinburgh Psychiatric Hospital are clearly
unacceptable. For the Scottish Health Advisory Service to have identified 50
points of criticism is dispiriting for the doctors, nurses, and ancillary staff
who quite obviously struggle in a difficult situation. Worse, it implies a
demeaning regime for patients who are among the most vulnerable people cared
for by the National Health Service. The main points of criticism assembled by
the SHAS indicate clearly enough the most obvious areas of concern. There is no
excuse for inadequate cleaning in any hospital; this suggests either that the
cleaners are incompetent or that too little money is being spent on hygiene.
Either way it should be capable of remedy. Other matters are more difficult and
appear to indicate a management which cannot or will not lead and an overall
framework which is simply not capable of meeting the needs of psychiatric care.
We fear that the last two points are nearest the core of what ails the Royal
Edinburgh. The report on the hospital comments on a distinct lack of
involvement by junior medical staff, and whether or not the staff themselves
should carry some blame for this it is surely the duty of management to involve
junior staff and to give them leadership. The inadequacy of nursing provision
is another area in which management must surely have failed, although in this
respect the amount of resources made available to the hospital is obviously
relevant.
Yet whatever went wrong inside the Royal Edinburgh cannot be taken in isolation
from the more general question of care for psychiatric patients, both in
hospitals and as they are moved into the community. The report expresses
concern that patients are being discharged too quickly and that this leads to
problems when these inadaquate preparations lead to a breakdown of care when
patients go into the community. As we have said on previous occasions, there is
nothing wrong with the theory of care in the community, but if patients are not
prepared for this with sensitivity and an understanding that they must not be
pressured, and if care is not continued adequately once they are in the
community, what is a sensible policy becomes a nightmare. There are good points
about the Royal Edinburgh but the problems must be addressed immediately.

THERE'S a colourful Christmas star on the steeple of Henderson Parish Church in
Kilmarnock, but within its walls the minister is grappling with issues, dark
and terrible, which have dimmed the brightest notions of the festive season.
The Rev David Lacy is angry. Angry and weary, and sick to his heart. In some
cold clinical setting, 16-year-old Mhairi Julyan, the daughter of one of his
parishioners, lies dead, her life violated and extinguished just minutes from
the church doors.
And in that one act of evil, Mr Lacy sees a thick layer of moral apathy
stretching from our own front rooms to the broader reaches of society, to
inadequate policing and even to the church itself.
``There is shock about this but with it comes a weariness. It's difficult to
put it into words that you can make sense of. It's a feeling of just how much
we tolerate. From the little things like kids dropping litter in the streets.
We just allow it to happen.
``The only time when the community arises, rises as one and says no, is when
something patently awful and evil happens, but by then it's too late. Some
person out there has all through his life believed he can do what he likes and
now he stops and thinks, I can even take a human life if it suits me.''
David Lacy is 43, a big, bluff man with a son in the same class as Mhairi, a
daughter he can't let out alone at night, and a community searching desperately
for answers or explanation. He thinks we should start by looking closely at
ourselves.
``We are horrified because this is so bad,'' he said. ``But we know all the
other things that happen. This murder, this is the head of the monster but the
tail is always there and it's flicking. Every time it hits at home, it grabs
you by the guts. But it's been happening for too long. This thing is now far
more possible today than it ever was before.
``I'm not angry at anyone. I'm angry at evil and we, the church, are as much to
blame. It's not been popular to talk about evil and sin. We want to tickle
their ears with something a wee bit more palatable and popular. It's the
feel-good factor. We don't tell them how it is. That there is evil and that it
must be fought.''
To win that fight, he said, we need a ``willingness to face up to this in the
political sense''. That means more police for a start. ``It's not the police's
fault, but officers are being drafted in from Kilbirnie for this case. There
aren't enough of them, but it's not their fault. It's our fault and mainly
because if we put up taxes to help the police force people would object, I
would object. Society says we will just get by.
``No; what we need is for everyone, every family, every parent, every school
teacher, when they see something wrong it should be stood up to and society
should support them in that stance. The law should support the victim, not the
aggressor. The policing should support them in their fight against whatever
evil it is.
``Why are we so careful and so precious in our attitudes to the wrongdoer? We
are not supportive enough of the victim until suddenly an innocent victim is
sacrificed.''
Mr Lacy is angry and the rest of Kilmarnock is just as disturbed. This town's
collective heart is breaking, not for innocence lost but for this confirmation
that they, too, live in an often brutal and senseless world.
In the main shopping precinct the talk was mainly of Mhairi's murder, all
thoughts of Christmas vanished under a growing sense of unease and panic. The
grim-faced warnings by the police that parents should keep an eye on their
offspring were almost redundant. Mothers and fathers, tight-lipped and pale,
had made a mental note when Mhairi's body was found on Sunday.
``There's evil all around, isn't there?'' said Margaret Findlay, a mother of
two, aged 12 and 14. ``Even on Thursday night, my daughter walked home at 10pm.
Then there was a school disco last night and when I went to pick her up, every
body was there to pick up their kids, everyone had turned out.''
Up at Kilmarnock Academy, where Mhairi was a pupil, the receptionist is calming
a caller who is apparently making arrangements to collect a child. ``I know,
it's such a worry,'' she said. ``It just brings it all home.''
Along the corridor, past the hall where the school band is rehearsing
half-heartedly for a Christmas concert, headmaster Frank Donnelly has been busy
issuing warnings to parents about the concert and a senior prom, offering
school assistance to make sure the children get home safely. ``I think the mood
here is much more sombre than I can ever remember it,'' he said grimly.
Outside, maybe five minutes walk away, at the bus depot where Mhairi's body was
found, someone has propped two small bunches of flowers against the wall, next
to the police incident room. To one side, an elderly passerby is shaking his
head, eyes bright with tears. ``It's just appalling, awful,'' he said. ``But
then no-one is safe to walk the streets these days.''
Yet while those in the town who had never known Mhairi drew lessons for their
own lives from her death, those who knew her best could do nothing more
yesterday than grieve for a lost companion and a bright, uncomplicated life cut
so brutally short.
Julie-Ann Holland was her best friend. They had known each other since she was
six and it was Julie-Ann who waved her off on the steps of the Palace Theatre
on Saturday night. She was put under sedation after the murder, but spoke to
The Herald yesterday.
``She was walking backwards, with a big cheesy grin on her face, just saying,
I'll see you later, bye now. She went away laughing and joking. She had really
got into the swing of the pantomime, shouting out and all of that. At times she
was the only one you could hear.
``She was so nice, you could tell her anything. She wanted to be a nurse, you
know. To help people.''
Julie-Ann is aware of the strength of feeling about the murder, but the
collective sense of outrage, from Mr Lacy to the man on the street, has done
little to ease her own pain.
``I always tried to protect her, you know, look out for her,'' she said, eyes
creasing tight and the tears finally coming. ``I always tried to protect her
all the way. She was just wonderful.''

GENERAL Sir Michael Walker is the man cast centre-stage in Europe's latest
version of mission impossible. As commander of Nato's 60,000-strong ground
forces in Bosnia, he is about to become the military equivalent of a fairground
Aunt Sally.
Tomorrow he faces his first major challenge in a face-to-face meeting with the
warring parties in Bosnia. His key task is domination of the psychological high
ground. He has the firepower to back his remit. But the major hurdle is
convincing the Serbs that he is prepared to wield the big stick.
Sir Michael, aged 51, must become all things to all men in a land where
duplicity is a way of life. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is Olympic
class when it comes to mendacity. Walker will have to learn to read the small
print between the lines of the sub-text.
In Bosnia, nothing is as it seems. The only recognised law, to paraphrase Mao
Tse Tung, comes from the barrel of a gun. To that end, General Walker has
sought the assurance of big guns. Key components of the British contingent are
a regiment of Challenger tanks backed by infantry in armoured fighting vehicles
and self-propelled heavy artillery.
While the objective remains the peaceful and orderly disengagement of the
opposing armies, Walker, with political backing, has already made it plain that
Nato policy will be robust. Anyone reluctant to comply with pull-back tables
will be, as they say, shown the road.
The British are in the process of shifting 7000 tons of ammunition and 7500
vehicles into their assigned sector. Most of it lies in Serb territory,
including the important military and transport centre of Banja Luka. Before
Yugoslavia disintegrated, the city was an army corps headquarters.
About two-fifths of the 13,100-man contingent is in place. Their immediate job
is changing berets from UN blue and painting their vehicles in the colours of
the trade, camouflage green and black.
The immediate job is ensuring the release of prisoners of war and the
establishment of a demilitarised zone between the opposing forces. Patrolling
that zone and guaranteeing freedom of passage will constitute the first
potential stumbling block on the way to peace.
Previous UN commanders in the area were forever frustrated by the lack of
recognisable chains of command among the Serbs, Croats and Muslims. Deals
struck with one local warlord were not recognised by the next tinpot general 10
kilometers down the track. Negotiation became a morass and the UN effort
drowned in it.
Another part of the initial process is the disarming of civilians. Given that
most of the local forces were militia, that is a daunting order. Yugoslavia
once had the fourth-largest conventional military apparatus in Europe. Everyone
had to complete basic military training. The country was a huge, armed camp.
During the siege of Vukovar in Croatia, whose shattered ruins became a symbol
of the conflict, the Serbs fired more shells than Britain had in its entire
Nato inventory.
General Walker says he will patrol behind Serb lines, brooking no interference.
The intransigence of petty tyrants at roadblocks, the scourge of UN relief
convoys and Protection Force teams for more than three years, has had its day.
From early next month, patrols will roll through unhindered or roll over the
debris of anything standing in their way. God is on the side of the big
battalions.
Backing them up at sea is the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious with its strike
force of six Sea Harrier jets, two frigates, HMS Brazen and HMS Beaver, and the
destroyer HMS London.
Twenty minutes flying time across the Adriatic at Italian airbases are 12 more
Harriers and eight Tornados, supported by early-warning aircraft and airborne
tankers.
The punch they represent is a powerful one. Being bombed to the conference
table was a salutary lesson for the Serbs.
On paper, Walker's approach and the vast array of weaponry and manpower
available should be guarantors of stable transition from war. But it must never
be forgotten that Nato is dealing with people whose reactions to threat and the
prospect of defeat are not logical.
Two days ago, a poll conducted in Serbia confirmed Ratko Mladic, the ``butcher
of Bosnia'', as the second most popular man in the country. He brought victory,
however fleeting. He gave the Serbs a renewed sense of national identity. The
fact that he has been indicted for war crimes and would, given the chance, lead
them to extinction in a blaze of glory is irrelevant.
Nato's job, and General Walker's reputation as a tough and business-like
soldier, may hang on the Serbs' national whim. The Western alliance is treading
in the valley of the shadow. Peace may yet be a long and bloody way down the
line.

NASTY big pomanders stinking of lavendar and festooned with lime green ribbons;
thick acrylic white socks decorated with bog-eyed reindeer with lolling
tongues; Pocahontas bubble bath; leather-bound desk tidies; wicker baskets all
wrapped up in cellophane full of titchy bottles containing about five drops of
weird smelly stuff which no-one will ever open, let alone use; horrificly
expensive sets of miniature crystal golf clubs and plush toys of any size,
price or description but especially Garfields.
Who buys this cack? I'll tell you who. Women with PMT buy it, that's who.
That's premenstrual tension, or potty mad trauma in layman's terms. Women with
PMT should not be allowed out of doors. They should stay tucked up on the sofa
working off their hormonal hysteria by shrieking insults at The Montel Williams
Show. They should be allowed to take a sickie so they don't pollute the
workplace with their mania. They should not be allowed near blunt objects,
sharp knives, or boxes of matches. Small children, furry animals, and errant
husbands should be locked out of their reach.
But most important of all, they should not be allowed to shop. If department
stores were really sharing, caring places they'd have PMT detectors on their
doors. When the alarm went off the security staff could gently remove the
woman, easily spotted due to that mad-eyed, fixed grin, unaccessorised look
which the PMT sufferer favours, pack her in a taxi, and send her home with the
urgent counsel ``do not shop''.
Of course, as we all know, department stores are not caring, sharing places.
They are places which need to entice PMT'ers through their doors so they can
get rid of the revolting goods which some woman in merchandising designed last
year while in the throes of a particularly evil bout of PMT herself. And,
unfortunately, although the last thing a PMT victim should attempt is a
shopping expedition, it's the very thing which she craves most.
She will shop with the zealous air of one with an assured sense of purpose,
although in fact she won't have the foggiest idea what she's looking for. She's
in search of the consumer equivalent of the Holy Grail, looking for a
mysterious purchase which will give her a sense of warmth and wellbeing and
stop her snarling at Big Issue vendors.
Eventually her eyes will light upon a bright orange and pink reversible hooded
anorak, the kind of clothing which can only be reasonably worn by
three-year-old infants with no road sense who might benefit from its
traffic-stopping abilities.
``If I buy this jacket,'' she will think, ``all will be right with the world
and the buzzing noise in my brain might subside. I could cease shopping, go
home, and watch The Montel Williams Show.''
I know this is how the PMT'er thinks. I am that woman. I have that jacket. It
hangs in my hall as a terrible lesson to me, a potential reminder of the folly
of dashing out to the shops at that certain time of the month. But do I pay
heed? Do I heck. Every four weeks it catches my eye and before I know it I've
shrugged it on and I'm rushing headlong out to the city centre in a frenzied
fit.
I mean, I have wine-coloured tights in my lingerie drawer. How could the woman
at Marks and Spencer have allowed me to buy them? Why didn't she take me aside
and say ``Dearie. No.'' And who were the evil vixens responsible for putting
them out on display in the first place?
Not only did I fail to come to my senses about the wine-coloured tights when I
got home, I actually put them on and went out to a nightclub wearing them. With
a short skirt. They were displayed in all their frightful glory. My friends
gasped in horror and, quite rightly, shunned me. Girls in the toilet queue gave
me pitying glances and kept a slight distance in case my bad taste disease was
infectious. I cared not. I thought I looked fabulous.
The moment I menstruated the very memory of it had me sobbing in shame. A
friend has just sent me a Purple Ronnie card. The verse on the front says it
all. ``Some folks are brilliant at telling good stories/And Being all clever
and funny/But some are just splendid at shopping all day/And spending great
sackloads of money.'' It's entitled ``A poem about a crazy shopper''. When it
comes to crazy shopping I'm right up there in the ranks of the truly barking.
Woof! Woof!
The worst aspect of this PMT shopping affliction is that it invariably grips me
the week before pay day. Not only do I go out spending sackloads of money on
cack I don't need or want, I'm spending great sackloads of money I can't
afford, pitching me straight into overdraft.
I'm trying to pluck up the courage to present a PMT plea to my bank manager.
Well, if it can be accepted in British law courts as a justifiable defence for
murder surely it can excuse a few financial indiscretions.
That said, I'm at least grateful that my PMT ailment only really manifests
itself in shopping insanity these days. Over the past two years my hormones
have settled down and my PMT has subsided from psychotic slagging matches with
innocent bystanders, like dry cleaners apologising for a slight delay in
delivery. These days the murderous impulses have diminished and the symptoms
are more or less manageable; my clumsiness increases in direct proportion to my
grip on rational thought decreasing. I have to avoid thin-stemmed glasses and
important decisions, like whether or not to buy orange and pink anoraks.
BUT at the moment I'm in a state of terror. A glance at the calendar confirms a
scheduled bout of PMT hitting me in the face at the exact time I need to do my
Christmas shopping. I just know that I'm about to buy nonsense presents, like
executive desk toys for friends who work outdoors and a bumper pack of Baywatch
Barbie dolls for everyone else, including my mate's mum.
So that's the reason why we chicks sometimes buy inappropriate prezzies. What's
your excuse boys? Incidentally, if anyone gives me a ``bouquet of wooden
kitchen utensils'' as some unquestionably PMT-afflicted person at Marie Claire
helpfully suggested in their Christmas gift pages, I will have no qualms about
poking the sender in the eye with the pointiest of said utensils.

THE Prime Minister is undoubtedly pleased with himself. By virtually promising
a referendum on the issue of a single currency he has eased some of the
pressure from the Euro-sceptics on his back benches. It is his way of appeasing
their whining attempts to influence the party manifesto for the next election
and to bend it to a Euro-sceptic line. Now this might constitute excellent
politics for the Tory party but it is not a satisfactory way in which to
conduct the governance of the nation. Those in favour of a referendum will
argue that an issue as important as the single currency must be subjected to
open public debate to be followed by a vote in which the considered and
informed opinion of the nation will be gauged.
Pigs might fly. If past experience of the single-currency affair is to be
repeated we will be in for an unending exchange of furious rhetoric which will
enlighten nobody. Don't take our word for it alone. The Confederation of
British Industry was so irritated by the political debate on Europe that it
warned of a danger that the nation's economic interests were in danger of being
undermined. Does Mr Major really want to condemn us to more of the same? It is
worth repeating the comments of CBI president Sir Bryan Nicholson at greater
length because they constitute a precise description of at least part of what
will take place in a referendum competition. He says that there is no support
for what has already taken place, characterising it as a shrill, xenophobic,
nationalistic debate which does not deal with the real business issues. Here is
the nub. The banner of national sovereignty is waved over the Emu battlefield
by the sceptics at every opportunity, but the loss of sovereignty is arguable
whereas the loss of economic advantage to a Britain which is sidelined from
monetary union would be clear and damaging.
This should not be taken as blind acceptance of Emu. On balance we agree with
the CBI's preference for open options on the matter and a full consideration of
the advantages and disadvantages as they unfold, but all of this should be
undertaken with proper information and a positive attitude towards the
potential benefits. None of it is possible if the threat of a referendum hangs
over the whole affair. Referendums are not necessarily bad but, as we have
indicated already, the sterility of the rhetoric which would flow from a
referendum campaign on a single currency is truly frightening. We have elected
representatives to form mature judgments on this and they have notably failed
to do so. This does not mean that we must seize the task from them. The manner
in which politicians of all parties conduct themselves on this issue in coming
months is an important part of the way in which we will judge them at the
General Election. That is the vote which matters. Talk of a referendum is just
another way for Mr Major and his confused colleagues to avoid yet another
essential duty of government. It will not do.

ON the morning of Thursday October 26, I left home literally convinced I was in
perfect health and walked up to a mobile medical unit in the Kidston Hall
car-park.
Shortly afterwards my certainty of wellbeing was shattered. On December 12 I
returned home after surgery and six days in hospital.
The mobile unit belonged to the West of Scotland Breast Screening Service - for
the first time my age had brought me within its scope. I was among the one in
100 women whose initial X-rays need clarification.
I am so grateful to the service, and to the surgical team and nurses at the
Western Infirmary for the excellent treatment I am receiving.
My purpose in writing is to urge all women who are invited to screening
sessions to go. Don't tear the letter up or, as I did, foolishly delay
appointments later on.

WE are all under stress at this time of year but we feel that Glasgow design
guru Janice Kirkpatrick may be suffering more than most. As evidence we
reproduce part of an article which she contributed to Design Week magazine on
the theme of Christmas colours:
``Then there are the metallics. Never trust a whore, never watch Hearts of
Gold. At Christmas, everything glitters and nothing is gold, Pantone 872 is
only ink on paper. Glittery things induce madness, Versace, and inspire some
very bad seasonal dressing. Silver balls inspire some very bad seasonal dancing.
``Tinseltown was a song by Blue Nile. A Glasgow band with a sensible colour in
their name. They obviously understood how bad things could get at this time of
year.
``Thankfully, Glasgow's streets are not paved with gold. London must be
lathered up and talking in tongues by now.
``In the words of that old song by Billy Ocean, red light spells danger . . .
you have been warned.''
Merry Christmas, Janice, and pass the mulled wine.
Pun of the Week
MR Brent Lockie, depute fiscal, prosecuting three Aberdeen students for the
heinous crime of growing a bit of cannabis in their flat, described it as ``a
joint venture''. Which is worth at least 180 hours' community service in its
own right.
No excuses
THE BBC television programme Only an Excuse has put together a comic
compilation of football parody and pastiche for our delectation on Hogmanay.
Jonathon Watson brings to our screens a flute-playing Gazza, a Graeme Souness
who admits that all that nice violence in the film Midnight Express was his
inspiration for becoming a football manager in Turkey, and a Jim White who asks
on Scotsport ``Did playing those European ties on a Thursday night cost Celtic
valuable league points? Let's hope so.''
The addition of tall, thin, angular actor Alastair MacGowan to the Only an
Excuse team allows the programme to impersonate tall, thin, angular people such
as Alan Hansen, Jurgen Klinsmann, and David Ginola.
But, for the Diary, the best part of the preview we saw was a devastatingly
literate and profound analysis of the game of football as it might have been
seen through the eyes of the MacIlvanney brothers, William and Hugh. In fact we
have taken the liberty of ripping off a great chunk of the dialogue, which
should be read in suitably gravelly and deeply meaningful MacIlvanneyesque
tones:
Hugh: Football is, was, and ever should have been the ballet of the working
classes, the poetry of the po-faced, the concerto of the criminally insane.
William: In our day, when you were talking football, you were talking millions
of mad, mental maniacs. The people's punters, pontificating, pissed, packed
like pilchards on the hallowed slopes of Hampden Park, the nation's national
cowshed.
Hugh: Watching with awesome awe some of the most skilfully accurate men on
earth. I tell you, in those conditions it wasn't easy to pee into a beer can.
William: Of coure this is now and that was then, when you could stand on the
terraces and just soak up the atmosphere through your shoes.
To compensate for this literary stuff, we have the Jim White character talking
about the UEFA three-foreigners rule. ``Or, as we call it in Scotland, the
three diddies rule.''
Wise guys
WE are nearing the end of our quest to name the Fourth Wise Person and say what
gift he or she might bring. Late arrivals at the stable in Bethlehem include:
q Former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart who would turn up with an array
of gifts and ask the baby Jesus to take his pick. (Stewart Hunter, Oban.)
q A salesperson from Herod Life, Palestine's biggest insurance company, with a
sales pitch which ends: ``In fact, the only thing you're not covered for is
mass infanticide.'' (Anon.)
q A Palestinian traffic policeman to tell Joseph that his donkey has just been
towed away and a daud of that gold will come in handy if he wants it back. (Jim
Paterson, Larkhall).
But Stuart Lindsday of Erskine shines brightliest today with his suggestion
that the fourth Wise Man would be Brandon Lee, schoolboy of the year, who would
bustle up to the manger with the words: ``Let me through, I'm a doctor.''
Time is running out for readers who wish to win a bottle of Langs Supreme
whisky or a Langs whisky first-footing kit. Closing date for entries, to the
usual address, is tomorrow.
Festive plug
WHAT with there only being four shopping days left before That Day, bathroom
furnishings giant Armitage Shanks has entered the ``what do you buy for a
person who has got everything'' arena.
Never mind your aftershave or under-arm stuff, the company says. Buy your loved
one a bath. It will ``last for years despite being used every day, provide
hundreds of hours of fun and relaxation for all the family, and doesn't require
batteries to make it work!''
Mr Shanks suggests the ``County'' bath, which ``accommodates two people in
comfort''.
For those of generous, even Santa, proportions Armitage Shanks recommends the
``Leander'' - a tub that is both ``generous in size'' and ``one of the
strongest baths available which can withstand great weight and the perfect
companion after a night on the tiles''.
For those whose stature more resembles that of one of Santa's little helpers,
Shanks offers the ``extra-short showertub''. In case you were worrying about
how to wrap up these unusual presents, Armitage Shanks is offering free festive
paper with every bath.

BY calling for the formation of a Socialist Labour Party Arthur Scargill has
thrown down a challenge to the left, both those within the Labour Party and
those organised outside.
The Communist Party of Great Britain recognises that the establishment of an
SLP will act as a focus for the best elements in the working-class movement to
provide an alternative to the decades of Labour Party betrayals.
The present political discontent in British society has left huge swathes of
the population disillusioned with politics. It is inevitable that after 16
years of Tory rule many will vote for Blair's Labour Party on the basis that
``they can't be any worse than this lot''.
However, as British capitalism lurches towards crisis, it is probable that the
next Government, Labour or Tory, will act like the French Government - huge
cuts in public spending and welfare, combined with further attacks on workers'
pay and conditions.
In such circumstances workers' discontent will need to have a political voice.
The options are fairly plain. If the left does not offer a positive alternative
of a society based on need and in the interest of all humanity then the right,
in the form of narrow, anti-working class, anti-social, chauvinism, will grow.
Whatever the timescale of a launch for a Socialist Labour Party the project has
historic potential to create a serious, mass, left-wing organisation in
Britain. It is crucial that such an opportunity is not wasted on the altar of
political sectarianism or bureaucratic methods.
The widest possible debate must take place to enable the working-class movement
to come up with a genuine, independent alternative to the bosses' Britain of
Blair, Major, Salmond, or Ashdown.

THERE is a tendency to yawn when the travel trade describes its grim state,
bleats on about this being the most distressing year it has ever suffered and
warns, peevishly, that this time it plans to do something about it. The
industry's cry wolf syndrome has led us to cock a knowing eyebrow and wait,
smirking, for the price-cut banners to appear in travel agents' windows.
This year, though, no amount of hype can disguise the dismal state of the
package holiday business. Yesterday First Choice Holidays, one of the big three
tour operators, announced a major slump in profits to #1.3m. They followed
rival Airtours which last week reported a 22% drop in profits to #59m. Thomson
Holidays are more than 50% down.
The travel industry blames everyone but itself. Yet the evidence is that they
are to blame for the bind in which they now find themselves, although it is the
public who will, literally and figuratively, pay the price.
This year, the major operators are cutting back substantially on the numbers of
holidays available. There will be between 10% and 30% fewer packages available.
A T Mays, the travel agent chain, said yesterday there would be 1.5 million
fewer holidays for sale next year. While bookings have plunged by 30%, brochure
prices have risen by 10%.
The objective, according to one leisure analyst, is to make sure a lot of
people cannot get the package holiday they want, cannot get the hotel or
destination they would like, if they leave booking until early summer. The
operators are aiming to break the cycle of last-minute booking.
Last year 45% of package holidays were booked late - between April and October
- compared with an annual average of 30%. Yet total sales of package holidays
were similar to the previous year. There were 10 million packages on offer last
year. But about 20% of the holidays were so deeply discounted that operators
saw their profits take a dive.
But the late-booking culture is the industry's fault. In the race to lure more
holidaymakers and gain ever more market share, the operators piled on capacity.
More hotels, more resorts, more destinations than any other operators, they
trilled. Now they yelp that they were forced to discount holiday prices to sell
off excess capacity.
Yesterday, in explaining the slump in profits for last year, the chairman of
First Choice, Michael Julien, said the industry had been forced into
significant discounting in June, July and August to sell excess capacity
created - he claimed - by unexpectedly weak consumer demand, partly the result
of the exceptionally hot UK summer. In other words, he blames the feel-bad
factor and, to borrow a phrase from another travel operator, the wrong kind of
weather.
Yet there was no whacking reduction in the numbers flying abroad on package
tours last year. Quite the reverse. What seems to have happened is that the
punters just got smart and waited for the discounts to start before booking.
By increasing brochure prices and reducing the choice of holidays available,
the major operators hope to reverse a trend that has become ever more marked in
the cut-throat package holiday trade.
``The major operators have been unable over the past few years to resist trying
to steal a march on their rivals, and in their greed to grab market share they
have been unable to control capacity,'' said an industry insider.
The enormous collapse of profits is forcing the major companies to address the
difficulties created by their previous strategy, according to John Boyle, who
co-founded the independent Scottish-based travel company Direct Holidays.
``The holidaymaker has had a bonanza for the past year or two. What's happened
now is that the big operators have decided that they can make more money by
reducing capacity.''
Direct Holidays, which as its name implies sells direct to the public, cutting
out travel agents, will announce substantially increased profits this year,
making it probably the only UK operator to make serious money.
The colossal losses, says Mr Boyle, have given the big operators a fright. The
evidence of capacity reduction is clear from the numbers of aircraft charters
scheduled for next summer by the big companies. For example, First Choice is
known to have reduced its fleet by two, sending one to operate out of Dublin
and another to New Zealand; Thomson Holidays have cancelled two 757s they were
due to charter from May, and Airtours have reduced flights also.

<HEADLINE>One in eight at risk from alcohol abuse</HEADLINE>

ALCOHOL abuse has reached ``staggering'' levels in parts of the west of
Scotland, says Argyll and Clyde Health Board.
The annual report of public health director Dr Lesley Wilkie found that 52,000
people aged 16 or over in the health board area, or one in eight of the
population, were running some degree of risk of damage to their health through
alcohol abuse.
Many of those could be within the Government's new recommended limit for
``safe'' drinking, 28 units in total a week for men and 21 for women.
The report's figures, based on the previous upper limit of 21 units for men and
14 for women, show that most problem drinkers consumed a maximum of
approximately six-and-a-half pints of beer more than the old limit.
The board spends #12m every year on hospital treatment for patients with
alcohol-related illnesses. That amounts to almost #30 for everyone in the board
area, which covers the districts of Argyll and Bute, Dumbarton, Inverclyde, and
Renfrew.
The report said:
q.Deaths from alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis were 42% above the Scottish
average between 1981 and 1993.
q.The death rate for all alcohol-attributable diseases was increasing and had
outstripped the Scottish rate in recent years (up to 12 deaths per 100,000
compared to the national average of less than nine per 100,000).
Dr Wilkie spoke of the ``truly staggering toll of disease, disability, and
death caused by the misuse of alcohol''.
She said there was particular concern that alcohol-related problems were
affecting more young people and women and added that more research would be
done into ``safe'' drinking levels.
Mr Douglas Allsop, director of the Scottish Council on Alcohol, said: ``This
reinforces the fact that alcohol is a bigger problem than drugs. Rural areas
have specific problems with heavy drinking without the resources to tackle
them.''
Dr Wilkie added that there had been positive findings, such as the success of
exercise and health promotion campaigns.

A ZAIREAN passenger plane on a charter flight crashed in northern Angola last
night killing 139 people.
``There were 139 people on board, plus five crew. There were only five
survivors,'' said Zairean Transport Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba.
A Ministry official said most of the dead were Angolans.
Hospital staff said five survivors were flown to the Zaire capital Kinshasa
today and four were in intensive care.
``They have been badly burned and their condition is serious. At this stage
they are unable to talk,'' a doctor said.
The fifth survivor, the co-pilot, had been taken away by his family. Five
corpses were also brought back from Angola. Officials there said the plane, a
Lockheed-built Electra operated by the private Trans Service Airlift, had
crashed at Kahengula in Angola's remote Lunda Norte province.
Diamonds produced in the Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul regions are smuggled out via
Zaire and many Zaireans regularly travel to eastern Angola to dig for diamonds
or to buy them.
MADRID: Forty-three passengers on a Venezuelan airliner were taken to hospital
with broken bones or shock in the Canary Islands today after their plane
plunged 3000ft in turbulence over the Atlantic.
``Everything was an inferno,'' said Italian Lorena Rizzo, 24, after the plane,
on a flight from Caracas to Rome, landed in Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.
The VIASA (Venezolana de Aviacion) DC-10 airliner carrying 154 people flew into
a clear-air zone around 2am, according to passengers, and the plane nose-dived,
sending passengers and luggage hurtling around the cabin.
``We were all quiet and suddenly, we entered an air vacuum, and that's all,''
said Italian Carmela Mulas, 66, in hospital with a crushed backbone.
She said that after the drop the captain told passengers through the intercom
that the plane had fallen 1000m and added: ``Thank God, we are alive.''
He then asked for permission to make an emergency landing at Las Palmas, two
hours' flight away, so passengers with spinal injury, broken bones, cuts,
bruises, and shock could be treated.
A number of people refused to get back on the plane and it resumed its journey
to Rome with 24 fewer people on board, said an airport spokesman.
Spanish television showed passengers being driven back to the airport in neck
braces and arm slings. One was sitting in a wheelchair. Five people were kept
in hospital on the Canary Islands.
Local media listed among the injuries a fractured pubis, fractured ribs, broken
vertebrae, a broken sternum, and collar and jaw-bone fractures. -Reuter.

TORY MP David Ashby last night was determined not to give the impression he is
a broken man after losing a libel action against the Sunday Times and the
newapaper's former editor Andrew Neil.
He took his seat as normal in the House of Commons at question time after a
jury had delivered a devastating verdict against him.
The majority decision at the High Court in London branded the Member of
Parliament for North West Leicestershire as a homosexual, and a hypocrite.
Nevertheless, within a couple of hours he was in his usual place in the House
of Commons.
In court, he sat sobbing with his head in his hands after the jury delivered
their verdict. His estranged wife, Silvana, who had given evidence for the
other side, crossed the courtroom and attempted to console him.
The 55-year-old MP pushed her away after she had put her arms around him and
kissed him on the back of the neck.
``Just leave me,'' was all the MP, newly disgraced by the jury's verdict, could
utter.
He remained in court until two policemen escorted him towards the sanctuary of
his lawyers' chambers in the nearby Temple Inn.
Prior to the case, the MP had lost vast sums by investing with Lloyd's. The
bill for pursuing the libel action, said by the Sunday Times to have been
misguided and illogical, will cost him an additional #500,000.
Mr Ashby, who before yesterday's verdict already had three mortgages to pay,
told the court that he was considering applying for legal aid to finance
matrimonial proceedings.
The MP may have finances to meet his latest legal bill. Nevertheless, it must
have crossed his mind that if he were to be declared bankrupt, he could no
longer carry on as a Member of Parliament. There was no suggestion that was the
case last night.
The scenes in the courtroom yesterday were extraordinary.
Spurned by her husband, Mrs Ashby returned to her seat and buried her head in
her arms. Yet she had spoken out loudly against him from the witness box.
For the Sunday Times, there were mixed emotions. Naturally its legal
representatives were delighted that the newspaper and former editor had been
exonerated. At the same time, there appeared to be some regret that it had come
to this.
``We will have to show magnanimity in our victory,'' said in-house lawyer
Alastair Brett. He anticipated that the current editor of the Sunday Times
would regard the case as a tragic family problem and would be sensible about
what further steps might be taken.
Despite these remarks, his employers soon after issued a statement declaring:
``We are sorry that Mr Ashby decided to take us to court and that he now faces
a substantial legal bill. But it was his choice.''
The statement continued: ``His case and ours could not have been more fully
aired in the High Court and in the end the jury decided in our favour.''
Mrs Ashby told reporters: ``It gives me no pleasure to see my husband lose an
expensive libel action.''
In an extraordinary twist that demonstrated the nature of their love-hate
relationship, she later said: ``I love my husband very much and will always be
behind him.''
She denied being ``obsessively jealous'' or showing, as her husband alleged,
``extreme hatred or violence'' towards him or anyone else.
She added: ``I have no idea what the future holds for me. I hope and trust that
relations with my daughter will return to normal as quickly as possible.''
Before the jury retired, she had heard the judge tell them: ``You have
witnessed a family exposing its misery in the full glare of publicity.''
Yesterday, Mrs Ashby continued: ``I hope it will not have a terrible effect on
him.
``On numerous occasions, I asked him to think twice before continuing with the
litigation.''
Mr Ashby's solicitor, libel action specialist Peter Carter-Ruck, issued a
statement on the MP's behalf. It read: ``I am deeply disappointed by the
decision of the court today. I am very grateful for the kind support of my
constituents during what has been a most traumatic ordeal.''
Against all the odds, Mr Ashby made an immediate appearance in the House of
Commons.
His presence at question time underlined his determination to hold on to his
seat.
Another man might well have applied for the Chiltern Hundreds but a by-election
could prove disastrous for an adminstration that is rapidly running out of a
majority.
While many Conservatives may have worried that the court decision could make a
General Election come sooner rather than later, it was clear last night that Mr
Ashby intends to battle on.
That is his style. The bustling, round-faced, workaday lawyer is the Whips'
idea of a perfect MP.
He rarely said anything out of place. Indeed, he has hardly said much at all in
the House of Commons. Obediently he has paraded through the division lobbies,
always on the Government's side.
Clearly, Mr Ashby's private life is in turmoil and it is almost certain that
the Tory Whips knew all about that.
That they can deal with. In fact, it is something they can use to their
advantage. They will pressurise Mr Ashby to carry on, despite the jury.
For their part, they will welcome his vote every time a division is called.
But many now believe Mr Ashby's political future hangs in the balance.
Officers in his constituency association, who have so far been supportive, said
they would be consulting him in advance of the next executive meeting in the
New Year.
Chairman Clifford McKee said: ``I expect to see him in about a week's time. I
can't comment on any action that may arise from this case until we have had
time to see David and speak to the association executive.''

THE Boldin triplets are finally reunited. Sisters Bernita and Berneta were born
nearly three weeks after their brother, Kenard.
The girls were delivered by emergency Caesarean section at Good Samaritan
Medical Centre in West Palm Beach, Florida.
Bernita weighed 1lb 13oz and Berneta, 1lb 15oz.
Delvonda Boldin's triplets were not due until March, but she went into labour
and delivered Kenard on Thanksgiving Day, November 25. He weighed 1lb 5oz.
``I think the girls got mad at the boy and kicked him out,'' said Mrs Boldin.
``Then the girls wanted to find out what they were missing, so they came into
the world, too.''
Doctors gave Mrs Boldin medication to stop her contractions and stitched her
cervix to allow the two remaining babies to remain in the womb so they could
continue to develop.
Babies in a multiple pregnancy have been born    at separate times, but this
is the first case in which     all three babies survived,    said Dr Anne
Graham. The triplets were today said to be in critical but stable condition at
the hospital, where they will probably remain until March.
Mrs Boldin, 24, a dental assistant, and her husband, Bernard, also have an
eight-year-old daughter.-AP.

<HEADLINE>More emergencies put `bed managers' under pressure</HEADLINE>

HOSPITALS are having to appoint ``bed managers'' to cope with a steady increase
in emergency admissions, according to a report published today.
The rise - 15% in four years in Scotland, 13% in England - is putting many
hospitals under considerable pressure, say the National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts and the British Association of Medical Managers, who
produced the report.
The appointment of managerial bed-jugglers comes at a time when the NHS is also
under pressure to reduce administrative costs by 5%.
Hospital trusts are also having to set up emergency admission wards and provide
high-dependency units to take the pressure off intensive care.
Nor is the increase a short-term blip in the statistics. The report points out
that in Scotland - where the data has been collected more comprehensively - an
increase of 42% can be traced between 1981 and 1993.
The report says: ``The hospitals affected are experiencing problems in coping
with the relentless flow of emergency admissions at the same time as keeping
pace with the queue for planned care.
``Hospital managers are having to continually juggle beds to accommodate the
influx of patients. Some hospitals have had to cancel operations, often at the
last minute, to find spare beds. Some hospitals have had to close to emergency
admissions - sending the problem elsewhere - for one or two days at a time.''
While the maximum manageable bed occupancy level was said to be 80 to 85%, some
hospitals were running with up to 100% of beds occupied.
Mr Philip Hunt, director of Nahat, said yesterday: ``Trusts and health
authorities are already tackling the problem with some success but we must find
a long-term solution to this new phenomenon so that emergency admissions are
catered for more effectively in the normal day-to-day activities of our
hospitals.''
The report looks to a study by Mr Steve Kendrick, of the information and
statistics division of the NHS in Scotland, for an analysis of the causes. He
found that the 12-year increase spanned all ages and diagnoses, that the number
of people having repeated admissions had increased by 70%, and that 12% of the
increase involved people being re-admitted within 28 days.
The biggest increases occurred in the catch-all group of symptoms including
chest or abdominal pain and swelling, and in poisonings - particularly
paracetamol. Mr Kendrick also suggests that the increase in people living alone
or in small households, without families who can look after them, may play a
part.
Other possible factors cited in the report are rising expectations and
referrals by GPs already overburdened by other work and playing safe for fear
of being sued.
The Scottish Ambulance Service, which is introducing a prioritised system for
responding to emergency calls, has generated increased traffic in recent years
as a result of a promotion urging people to dial 999 immediately if they suffer
chest pains or other possible heart-attack symptoms, because of the benefits of
early intervention.
Although it is seen as a largely inner-city problem, the recently-opened Lorne
and Isles Hospital in Oban this year had a 32.6% increase in emergency
admissions between April and October, compared with the same period last year
in the old hospital group it replaced.

<HEADLINE>Skye Bridge protesters challenge toll legality</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE
OPPONENTS of the Skye bridge are still questioning the legal authority of the
operators Skye Bridge Ltd to collect tolls and island councillors are to ask
the new Highland Council to prepare for court action.
At issue is whether the Government followed the proper legal procedures before
the bridge opened on October 16. One particular point is whether they
advertised the identity of the warranted concessionaire, the party licensed to
stop traffic and collect tolls, under the terms of the New Roads and Street
Works Act 1991.
According to the protesters, the Act makes it clear that the certificate of the
warranted concessionaire must be advertised in the legal paper, the Edinburgh
Gazette, and whichever paper the Secretary of State believes best informs the
community most affected by road or street work.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office told The Herald this week: ``That part of
the Act does not apply to the Skye bridge because it is effectively a new road.
It only applies to existing roads.''
Skye and Kyle Against the Tolls (Skat) campaigner Robbie (the Pict) Robertson
does not accept the offical explanation: ``Clearly, the purpose is to ensure
that the travelling public is made aware who the licensed concessionaire is,
who can stop traffic and collect tolls on the A87 using powers orginally given
to the Secretary of State.''
Skye councillor Gavin Scott-Moncrieff, also a Skat member, said yesterday he
would now be asking the Highland Council, which is committed to a campaign to
abolish the present toll regime on the bridge, to seek further legal advice
with a view to applying for interim interdict.
``It is all very well to say the bridge is up now so let's get on with it but
there are many people in Skye who are suffering because of the imposition of
the tolls.
``There are now hundreds of people who have refused to pay their tolls as a
protest and sometime they will have to appear in court. It would appear they
may have no case to answer if the toll collection was not lawful in the first
place.''

PRINCESS Anne will not be among the crowd to see her son Peter win his first
schools rugby cap for Scotland, it was revealed last night. Her decision was
welcomed by Mr Tom Robertson, president of the Scottish Schools Union, who
said: ``There will be enough pressure on the lad as it is without it turning
into a real circus.''
Peter Phillips, 18, a pupil at Gordonstoun, makes his international debut
against the French Schools at Goldenacre, Edinburgh, on Friday afternoon. He
will become the first member of the royal family to play international rugby at
any level. He escaped injury after being involved in a car accident at the
weekend.
Bucking trend
THE engineering industry is set for continued growth next year despite a recent
slowdown in orders, according to a new report yesterday. The Engineering
Employers' Federation suggested that the United Kingdom market did not grow at
all over the last month but capital expenditure by firms and employment
increased and the industry is confident about the new year.
Shipyard deal
THE 1300 workers at the Kvaerner Govan shipyard on the Clyde yesterday accepted
a new pay deal which will cover them for the next two years. Following a
ballot, they agreed to an increase of 3.27% from January 1 with a further
increase of 2.8% in 1997, depending on the Retail Price Index. The yard also
confirmed a #60m contract for the construction of a ship to be used in the
launching of commercial satellites.
Shops anger
PLANS to extend a major shopping complex in Glasgow have been criticised by
council officials in Clydebank who fear that its own Clyde Shopping Centre will
suffer from the expansion. Details of the latest proposals for the former
Goodyear tyre factory site in Drumchapel were disclosed by Glasgow District
Council in a consultation document.
Theatre plan
THE Denny Civic Theatre in Dumbarton is to receive an #80,000 refurbishment
grant from the Scottish Arts Council Lottery Fund. Restoration work during the
five-year project will include an upgraded foyer area, new box office and bar,
and a small visual arts gallery.
Golf raid plea
POLICE in Renfrew yesterday appealed for witnesses after a man was injured
during a robbery at Erskine Golf Club, Bishopton. Mr James Allan, 63, a club
committee member, was hit on the head with a wooden baton as he chased three
armed men, who earlier had stolen a small amount of money from the club. He was
treated in hospital and later released.

<HEADLINE>Row over fuel rods bound for Dounreay</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974798913</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A ROW flared last night after it was revealed that Dounreay is set to receive
cargoes of almost 1000 bomb grade nuclear fuel rods from Belgium.
The highly-radioactive elements will be recycled at the D.1204 reprocessing
plant.
A total of 995 rods containing highly-enriched uranium will be shipped to the
Caithness facility by research organisation SCP, which operates the BR.2
reactor at Mol, near Antwerp.
The deal was revealed yesterday by Greenpeace and later confirmed by the
Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs.
Yesterday, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, which operates the Dounreay site,
would neither confirm nor deny the shipments.
The deal was criticised yesterday by Greenpeace and by anti-nuclear activist
Rose Young, of the Northern European Nuclear Information Group, which is based
in Lerwick.
Mr Jan van de Putte, of Greenpeace Belgium, said the deal was illegal because
the Belgian Government had passed a resolution against transporting the
material.
He said: ``There is a major threat of A-bomb grade material getting into the
wrong hands, such as terrorist groups or `rogue' governments, who could use it
to make crude nuclear weapons.
``It goes against the wishes of the Belgian parliament and that of the Scottish
people.''
Ms Young said: ``Once again Dounreay is to be used as the world's nuclear waste
dump. The transport is dangerous, the reprocessing is dangerous and the storage
of such nuclear fuel is lethal.''
She added: ``We now face the prospect of fuel from Australia, Germany, India,
Britain, Belgium, and possibly the United States, coming to Dounreay, against
the wishes of the local people.''
Dounreay will not disclose the value of the new contract, but it is believed to
be in the region of #20m.
The D.1204 plant, the only facility in the Western world available for
recycling fuel from research reactors, has been mothballed for the past year,
but is set to re-open next month.
Yesterday, Mr Ian Shepherd, spokesman for Dounreay, said: ``We never discuss
specific contracts for reasons of commercial confidentiality.'' But he stressed
that Dounreay operated its reprocessing activities in accordance with tough,
internationally-agreed guidelines.
Last week, in a poll organised by Caithness Against Nuclear Dumping, voters in
Caithness voted two-to-one against Dounreay's plans to import foreign
atomic-fuel for reprocessing.

Kelso said farewell this week to        the woman they still regard as
their duchess. Liz Taylor was among those at the reception          for Lady
Jane Grosvenor
TEARS were not far away when Kelso Community Council held a reception in the
Provost's Parlour of the elegant town hall to say goodbye to Lady Jane
Grosvenor, the ex-wife of the local potentate, the Duke of Roxburghe.
Though she resumed using her maiden name after she divorced her husband, Guy,
more than five years ago, and he has since remarried, the people of Kelso still
refer to her as ``the duchess'' and talk about the duke's second wife as ``the
other one''.
This is not really a slight on Virginia, the second duchess, who married the
duke                   in September 1992, and has kept a low profile since
then, but more a reflection on the high regard in which local people hold Lady
Jane. In Duchess Virginia's defence it is only fair to say that Lady Jane would
be an almost impossible act to follow. In a popularity poll for the whole
district, she would come out a winner by a long stretch, and on this week's
evidence the esteem in which she is held is well deserved.
When that elusive quality ``charm'' was being distributed, she must have
scooped the pool on the day of her birth. Her charm is entirely natural, making
her the most approachable aristocrat most people in the Borders have ever met.
Perhaps she owes this quality of accessibility to the fact that she was born
the daughter of a younger son of a ducal family, living in Northern Ireland,
where she and her siblings had a free and open existence.
Family life changed dramatically when she was 14 and her father unexpectedly
became the 5th Duke of Westminster. The family then moved to Eaton Hall in
Cheshire with another home in London which Lady Jane hated. Her
unconventionality extended to taking a job as an au pair in Brussels, and
wanting to work for the Red Cross, but that last plan was cast aside when she
married Guy Innes-Ker, 10th Duke of Roxburghe.
It seemed to be a suitable marriage. He was 23; she 25. He was tall, slim and
blond-haired; she was tall, not quite so slim, with long, curling dark brown
hair and a lovely face. Both came from super-rich families. Lady Jane's
brother, now the 6th Duke of Westminster, to whom she is very close, is reputed
to be the richest man in Britain.
When they leave their present home, Cherrytrees near Yetholm, she and her
children will spend Christmas with him and his family at Eaton Hall. ``There'll
be around 22 of us there,'' said her youngest son, Lord Edward, in happy
anticipation.
Unfortunately the promise Lady Jane's young husband Guy presented as a more
accessible and agreeable duke than his father, who was locally nicknamed
``Bobo'', was not fulfilled after he succeeded to the dukedom in 1974. Kelso
people at the farewell reception were privately saying that the best thing he
ever did for them was to marry Lady Jane who they took to their hearts at once.
After the wedding in 1977 she set about building bridges between the local
community and Floors Castle which broods behind a long stretch of imposing wall
on the outskirts of the town. The way she won all hearts to her in Kelso is
remarkable because, to be frank, the Dukes of Roxburghe, for the past two
generations anyway, have not been popular although local people have always
preserved lip-service courtesy towards them. In private, furrowed brows and
twisted lips tell a different story when their names are mentioned.
The present duke's unpopularity does not seem to be confined to the Borders,
because when he applied to become a member of the Jockey Club in September
1991, he was, astonishingly, black-balled by at least nine members.
This act was a marked signal of disapproval because, like his father, the duke
is a renowned breeder of thoroughbred horses, owns Kelso racecourse, and was
put up for membership of the Jockey Club by Colonel Sir Piers Bengough, the
Queen's representative at Ascot. Normally a background like that would have
guaranteed acceptance.
Lady Jane, however, turned out to be a very different kind of duchess. In the
early days when her husband was studying agriculture at Cambridge, they lived
modestly in the South where she did her own cooking, using recipes out of The
Paupers' Cookbook. During the time spent at Floors, she went shopping on foot
in the town and was often seen helping out at the garden centre which she
helped to establish at Floors. A local woman said she only realised the
gardening girl in jeans was the duchess because of the diamond rings that
adorned her fingers.
She was so successful in winning respect and affection that for a while it
looked as if the long estrangement between the Dukes of Roxburghe and their
neighbours was about to end, but unhappily, after the birth of three children,
the marriage ran into problems, rumours abounded, and in March 1990 she sued
her husband for divorce on the grounds of adultery with an unnamed woman.
In divorce, it is said, friends should not take sides, but Kelso disregarded
that advice and sided openly with the duchess. Though she moved out to live at
Cherrytrees, near Yetholm, seven miles from Kelso, she was still regarded as
the chief lady of the town, invited to all official, and many unofficial
occasions.
This summer, however, Lady Jane let it be known that she was putting
Cherrytrees on the market and moving to the South so that she could be near her
children. The eldest child of her marriage to Guy is 17-year-old Lady Roseanne,
followed by 14-year-old Charles, the Marquis of Bowmont, and 11-year-old Lord
Edward Innes-Ker. The marquis is already at Eton to which he will be followed
by his brother next year and the duchess's new home is only half-an-hour's
drive from the school.
THE children have obviously adopted their mother's informality. ``I'm called
Ted,'' said her youngest son introducing himself when he and his elder brother
accompanied their mother to the reception. Both boys, neatly dressed in grey
suits and tightly knotted ties, moved among the guests talking about fishing,
about their love of rugby (both play), and in Charles's case, shooting.
When they posed as a family for shot after shot of photographs, Lady Jane urged
them to ``smile'' and they did so without the least sign of boredom or
frustration. They also looked on with obvious pride when their mother stood,
elegant in a navy fitted dress with a wide white collar, in the middle of about
30 assembled councillors, to hear George Renton, Provost of Kelso, express the
sentiments of the town towards her.
``We are going to miss you,'' he said, ``you have been a great, great asset to
this town and to the Borders.''
In reply she said she was certainly not turning her back on the Borders for
good but would be coming back once a month because she is involved with several
business projects in the district, including a new conference-centre company
that is to be set up in Leitholm, near Duns, and with the Historic Buildings
Trust.
Though her new home is to be an old rectory, ``which we're already referring to
as the Old Manse'', she joked, she would always feel a Borderer at heart and it
has always been her intention that her children think of themselves as
Borderers for their entire lives.
Provost Renton presented her with a large picture wrapped in brown paper which
she immediately unwrapped to reveal a framed picture of Kelso Bridge, taken by
local photographer Alan Thompson.
After the speeches everyone wanted to talk to the duchess and all had a
personal memory of her to contribute. ``She really won my heart when she went
on the ride-out to Yetholm with the Kelso Laddie a couple of years ago and rode
right in the front, singing all the local songs at the top of her voice,'' said
one man.
Another said the duchess earned her respect by going to the Hawick Common
Riding where women are not allowed into the special sheds set aside for men to
attend the celebrations. ``She stood outside in the rain with all the other
women and, like we all did, complained about Hawick's male chauvinism,'' she
remembered.
When it came my turn to speak to Lady Jane she grasped my hand with a smile and
said she remembered being interviewed by me 18 years ago when she arrived at
Floors as a new bride. It was remarkable that she remembered because we have
not met since.
In those days she was a plumpish, fresh-faced girl with tumbling dark hair.
Today she is tall, slim and statuesque, a beauty with a short-cut bob, but her
unfeigned naturalness is as real now as it was then.
I remembered that in those early days she had enthused about horse riding and
enquired if she still rode but she shook her head. ``I had a bad fall in
Ayrshire a couple of years ago and told myself `It's time to give this up.'.''
Finally I asked the Duchess what it was about the Borders that she would miss
most and she looked pensive. ``The people I think,'' she said, looking around
at the happy throng in the town hall.
``They're so natural and I'll miss the beauty of the countryside. I love it,
just love it. You see, apart from here, I've lived in Northern Ireland and the
Midlands, but never in the South and it's all going to be very strange to me. I
know I'll always be hankering after the Borderlands but I'll keep coming back I
promise I will.''

THE Edinburgh Festival Society became the recipient of the largest Scottish
award yet to an arts organisation from the proceeds of the National Lottery.
Of the #4.2m of grants announced yesterday, #3m goes to the society towards its
plans to convert the Highland Tolbooth Church at the top of the Royal Mile into
a home for the festival.
The #7.3m plan will see the building, which was built as the Church of
Scotland's Assembly Hall in the mid nineteenth-century, converted into
exhibition space, a performance and rehearsal hall, box office, cafe, bar, and
offices. The announcement of support from the Scottish Art Council through its
National Lottery committee will pave the way for other public bodies to support
the project.
The festival's Mr Nick Dodds said indications of support had already been
received from Edinburgh District Council, Lothian Regional Council, and Lothian
and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited.
It is planned to open the centre in 1998.
The second largest grant announced yesterday was for a mobile cinema for the
Highlands. The award to Hi-Arts is for the construction and running of a lorry
trailer-based cinema modelled on the French Cinemobile which has visited
Scotland.
Exceptionally, the lottery committee granted #50,000 to the project to assist
with initial running costs, in addition to its #330,317 capital grant. The
construction of the vehicle will be commissioned in March, with the aim of
having the 100-seat cinema on the road in September.
Another arts vehicle on the road next year will be the Book Bus which has been
part of a campaign to promote books and reading. A #30,000 grant will enable a
new company, Readiscovery Touring Ltd, to buy the bus to continue the work.

Six shot dead in
Bronx shoe shop
NEW YORK: Six people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed and two others
wounded when a gunman trying to steal a pair of boots opened fire in a Bronx
shoe shop. He shot eight people minutes after entering Little Chester's Shoes
and demanding free boots, police said.
Gunman Michael Vernon, 22, who tried to escape using a victim as cover, was
shot and apprehended by police in New York City's second mass murder in 11
days. Another gunman killed seven people and himself in a burning and shooting
spree in a Harlem clothes shop on December 8.
Doctor cleared
MADRID: A bogus gynaecologist who treated more than 11,000 women was cleared by
a court in northern Spain yesterday of fraud, falsifying documents, and
illegally using a professional title. The court at San Sebastian gave a
three-year suspended sentence to imposter Jose Luis Fernandez, 44, saying his
practical knowledge and dedication in 14 years' practice made up for his lack
of formal training.
Trial put off
TEL AVIV: An Israeli court put off the trial of Yitzhak Rabin's self-confessed
assassin, 25-year-old Yigal Amir, 25, until January 23 so that his lawyers
would have time to study the evidence.
Walesa summons
WARSAW: Outgoing Polish President Lech Walesa called an urgent meeting of the
National Defence Committee at his Warsaw Palace last night concerning an
alleged threat to state security. Radio reported that it concerned documents
about the activities of Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy.
Patten backed
HONG KONG: Britain has dismissed a Chinese demand to exclude Hong Kong Governor
Chris Patten from the ceremonial handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Beijing has
demonstrated its dislike of the governor with a series of attacks, but Hugh
Davies, head of the British team responsible for the handover, said: ``Clearly
the governor is a major participant.''
q A South Korean woman welcomed as Hong Kong's 10 millionth visitor this year
won a ride in a Rolls-Royce, a night in a deluxe hotel, #650 in travel cheques,
and two air tickets to come back again.
Celluloid sales
NEW YORK: The green army uniform worn by Tom Hanks in the film Forrest Gump
sold for #11,215 at a sale in New York of film and television memorabilia.
Other big sellers were Greta Garbo's love letters to actor Gilbert Roland,
which went for more than #11,000, and a pair of boxing shorts worn by Sylvester
Stallone in the 1976 film Rocky, which fetched more than #7100.
Leader `critical'
ATHENS: Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, in hospital for a month, was
fighting off a new secondary infection and his condition had worsened. Hospital
sources were reported as saying his condition was critical.
All bets off
PARIS: A strike at the French equivalent of the Tote entered its sixth day
yesterday, depriving thousands of would-be punters of a flutter. A spokesman
for the state-run Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU) said the strike, over salaries and
jobs, had affected the system's computer network.
Dini set to quit
ROME: An aide said Prime Minister Lamberto Dini would offer his resignation on
December 30, opening the way to a parliamentary debate in the New Year on
Italy's political future. Dini has led a technocrat government since the
collapse of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's coalition government last January.
Belgians strike
BRUSSELS: Rail and air strikes plunged Belgian transport into chaos yesterday
Most of national airline Sabena's 280 flights were cancelled and at least half
the country had no trains. Eurostar trains to Paris and London were also
affected.

<RECORDNO>974798917</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE ``family from hell'' was an unkind but not an inaccurate sobriquet coined
by observers of Tory MP David Ashby's libel action. This was not the usual
hurly-burly of suburban ups and downs but an altogether more dramatically
dysfunctional set-up, reminiscent of an American soap or even a Greek tragedy.
Mr Ashby's 52-year-old wife Silvana claimed he threatened to kill her. He
pointed a knife at her chest, put a lighter to her skirt, and a pillow over her
face, she said. But she adored him even now, she told the jury.
In the MP's version, Silvana Ashby was a Latin Jekyll and Hyde with a vicious
vocabulary who once attacked him in the rockery, and fought with everyone - but
especially builders.
Their bizarre mutual tenderness even found expression outside court each
morning as, before the next bout of mud-slinging, they would kiss each other
continental-style on both cheeks.
In the midst of this emotional quagmire their only child, Alexandra - who lives
abroad - claimed to love them equally, but sat next to her father and bitterly
denounced her mother's possessiveness.
Silvana Ashby remains close to her 83-year-old mother and sister, who still
live in Italy.
But Mr Ashby has a tortured relationship with his sister Lynne, exacerbated, he
claimed, by Lynne Ashby and his wife being sworn enemies.
It was Lynne Ashby, dubbed the ``malevolent sister'' by the judge, who went to
the press with stories about the MP and Dr Kilduff. ``She hates me,'' said Mr
Ashby. ``She was determined to get me. She was coming in for the kill.'' She
even drew doodles of him hanging from a gibbet.
Bobby Sheridan, the homosexual partner of the MP's late brother, Brian, branded
Lynne Ashby ``cuckoo'' and claimed she was bent on destroying all her brothers
so she could have the business.
Whatever the truth of life in the ``crazy house'', as the MP described it,
there was abundant evidence during the case that the Ashby family lavished more
care on its four elderly, incontinent dogs than on each other.
Ironic from an MP whose last election address read that he was ``married with a
family and therefore understands the needs of families''.

Washington, Tuesday
RICHARD HOLBROOKE, the man who negotiated the Bosnia peace treaty, is to leave
the government next year, after one last effort to resolve the Cyprus dispute.
He will return to Wall Street, where he used to be an investment banker,
holding himself in readiness to become secretary of state if the job is offered
him in 1997.
Mr Holbrooke is assistant secretary for European affairs. He was always a
staunch advocate of taking a firm line on the Balkans, but until last summer,
his advice was ignored. President Clinton and Secretary Warren Christopher
preferred the soft, European line and the war continued.
After the fiasco of the first Nato air-strike and the taking of UN hostages,
then the capture of Srebrenica and the massacre of its inhabitants, Mr
Holbrooke was at last allowed to apply the full force of American power and
diplomacy.
The result, after four months of shuttle diplomacy, was the reversal of the
situation on the ground and the Dayton peace agreement. Mr Holbrooke has many
enemies in Washington, but his success makes him the obvious candidate to
succeed Mr Christopher if the president is re-elected.
Mr Holbrooke will probably leave in February. Before that, he will conduct a
round of shuttle diplomacy in a new attempt to break the long stalemate over
Cyprus. A Turkish army has occupied the northern part of the island since 1974
and repeated efforts to reach an agreement between Greece, Turkey, and the two
sides in Cyprus itself have all failed.
Mr Holbrooke told the Washington Post: ``We intend to make 1996 the year of the
big push on Cyprus.''

TORY MP Peter Bottomley was yesterday awarded #40,000 damages by a High Court
jury which found by a majority that he had been libelled by a Sunday Express
article.
Mr Justin Walford, legal adviser to Express Newspapers, which was also ordered
to pay the estimated #250,000 costs of the eight-day trial, said the company
was considering an appeal because of the questions raised over press freedom.
Mr Bottomley, husband of Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley, was accused in
the article of betraying jailed paratrooper Private Lee Clegg by appearing at a
meeting with Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness.
The former Northern Ireland Minister said after the hearing: ``I don't mind
robust criticism or even vulgar criticism but this stopped me doing what I have
devoted my life to - ending the violence in Northern Ireland.''
Mr Thomas Shields QC, who represented the MP, had told the hearing that Mr
Bottomley had been ``shocked and horrified'' when he read the article last
January which linked his sharing a platform with Mr McGuinness and the failure
to free Private Clegg who at that time was in jail for murdering a joyrider in
Northern Ireland.
The 51-year-old MP for Eltham had told the court he was prepared to talk to two
Sunday Express journalists at his Surrey home and had explained he did not see
any link with his decision to appear at the meeting and the failure of the
House of Lords action to free Private Clegg.
However, the article which appeared the following day did not contain one
reference to his remarks to the journalists.
Mr Justice Blofeld, advising the jury on damages, had told them that any award
should take into account damage to political reputation.
He also indicated to them how much could be awarded in cases of personal injury
under new guidelines set by the Court of Appeal last week.
Mr Walford said after the hearing: ``We are disappointed with the result and we
shall be looking very closely at mounting an appeal.''
q.Two Metropolitan policemen who sued the BBC over a Panorama programme which
they claimed painted them as racists yesterday won a total of #16,500 libel
damages.
In a unanimous verdict, a High Court jury awarded Constables Christopher Wright
#12,500 and Peter Callaghan #4000.
The BBC was also ordered to pay the costs of the case, unofficially estimated
at #200,000.
The BBC denied libel and pleaded fair comment. It argued that the officers were
not identifiable from the programme - which dealt with a crisis of confidence
in the police among East End Asians - and that it did not accuse them of being
racist.

What's in a name? Usually a pun if you're a hairdresser, finds KEN SMITH, as he
combs the country
Hairdressing salon names would make you just want to Curl Up and Dye with
embarrassment. Other businesses can happily get by with the simple name of the
owner above the door. Malcolm Campbell's is a fine enough name to sell an apple
or two without resorting to calling it What A Pear or Gnaw Your Onions.
If it's not the owner's name, then a simple description of the services on
offer will suffice. What could be simpler than The Bank of Scotland? No need
there to have a chain of banks called the Cash Inn or Cheque It Out.
But hairdressers. They reach for the Book of Puns quicker than for a can of
lacquer as soon as they get the keys to a salon. Some were probably thought to
be quite smart the first time they were used. Cut Above for example, or Blow
Your Top, or Streaks Ahead. Unfortunately crimpers keep most of their
imagination for their hairstyles. Any novelty these names once had was soon
dissipated by the fact they have been reproduced the length of the country.
Others though turn to thoughts of their spare time, and in hairdressers' cases
that means keeping fit or foreign holidays. Thus in Glasgow we have the Hair
Port, Haircraft, Hair 2000, and Hairobics salons. Those interested in a night
out at a show have dreamed up, would you believe, Dyes 'n' Dolls as well as
Beyond the Fringe. Or perhaps there was a romantic filmgoer who chose Perfect
Endings.
These are all scissor-wielders in Glasgow. Outside in the country though things
begin to be a shade more weird. It may attract Aberdeen fans, but The Shearing
Shed in Dunoon sounds just a tad rough and ready. Ayrshire is just as bad with
Shear Magic in Dalry and The Head Gardener in Prestwick. We all know people who
look like they've been done over by a sheep-shearer, we just didn't think
salons would boast about it.
Only in Lanarkshire would a salon have the honesty to call itself Nutters. But
it doesn't say whether that's the staff or the clients.
Some do, of course, use their name, in a straight-up way such as Betty's in
Coatbridge or Janette's in Partick. Others try to be a bit more fanciful such
as Deb 'n' Hair. In Glasgow's Candleriggs, actor John Comerford runs a salon
and just calls it, well, John Comerford. So why the puns elsewhere John?
``Straight up, hairdressers don't have the imagination to think of anything
else. Although I do like the salon I saw called Michaelangus. I mean, is it
just run by two guys called Michael and Angus who ran their names together to
make it sound like Michelangelo? I'd hate to go in and ask them though, in case
they say they've never heard of Michelangelo. Mind you, I've never heard of a
hairdresser called Angus either.
``I'm sure there must be a Short 'n' Curlies out there somewhere, and there's a
Public Hair in Nottingham, I think, which is just waiting for someone to muck
about with the sign. I think some hairdressers should be a bit more honest
though and call what they do Cut and Run.''
Others are a bit more obscure. I mean, I may only have got an O-grade in
French, but does A Sans Cheveux not mean without hair? And the Tin Tin Hair
Studio. Who would want a haircut like a Belgian cartoon character? Then there
is Pele Hairdressing in Glasgow.
I don't recall the Brazilian footballer having a flowing mane or nipping into
Glasgow for a quick cut and blow-dry. Co-owner Fraser Stroak at Pele's
explained: ``Well there's three of us in the partnership and all three of us
would have argued over the name for ever. But all three of us are football
daft, so we finally settled on Pele. It's short, easy to remember, and he's
well known.''
Certainly makes more sense than calling it after Bobby Charlton.
Nor is it just a West of Scotland thing, this constant punning. Bristol, for
example, can offer you Friendly Wave, or perhaps the more unfriendly nineties'
names of Parting Company, Cutting Comments, and Head Case.
So why did John Comerford stick with just his name? ``My dad's name is John,''
he recalled, ``and the day before I opened it, he came to see it, and he was so
proud of me. And the tragedy was he died suddenly the next day, so I've really
named it in memory of him.'' He choked back a sob.
That's such a sad story. ``Yes,'' he added. ``And not a word of it is true you
gullible fool.''
See hairdressers? They can be so cutting at times.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
NATO began a final countdown today to its biggest operation in 50 years,
confident that it has the men and political muscle to bring Bosnia the peace
its UN predecessor failed to deliver for 3!s years.
``I do not underestimate the challenge but Ifor (Implementation Force) has been
given the tools to do the job,'' said Britain's General Sir Michael Walker,
commander of Nato ground forces in Bosnia, on arrival in Sarajevo today.
``We offer the chance for something everybody wants - peace,'' he told
reporters as scattered units of the multi-national force grouped for
deployment.
Bosnia was ripped apart in ethnic crossfire during Europe's worst conflict
since the Second World War, which killed 200,000 people and displaced between
two and three million.
D-Day for the Nato-led peace enforcers, eventually to number 60,000, starts
around 11am tomorrow, when they formally take over from the United Nations in
Bosnia.
Nato officials said the first test could come within days of the Implementation
Force (Ifor) succeeding the blighted United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor)
when new commanders order Serbs and Muslims to quit front lines in the Bosnian
capital, Sarajevo.
French troops patrolling Sarajevo have earmarked several sites they want
vacated. Walker is to meet leaders of the warring parties on Thursday to say
what he wants.
``Sarajevo is the key, it is first chronologically and politically and will set
the tone for the rest of the operation,'' said one senior Nato official.
``These people have been at war a long time and no-one wants to be the first to
pull back.''
A spokesman for the departing UN mission gave a final briefing for journalists.
``We who have survived the war are handing over to the peacemakers,'' Alexander
Ivanko said.
``Hopefully we will now see the final chapter in this tragic war and the start
of a new era in Bosnia.''
The UN, criticised for its operation in Bosnia, will take away from Bosnia
little thanks from a people bitter at its failures and forgetful of its
achievements.
Today, however, the organisation defended the performance of its staff there
and pledged to continue to work in the civilian sector.
``For more than three years, United Nations personnel in Bosnia worked to
contain the conflict and lighten the burden of suffering civilians,'' said a
spokesman for Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
``They were not sent there to stop the war, yet were asked to shoulder the
blame for the lack of peace.
``They brought humanitarian relief to millions, while agonising over the deaths
that they could not prevent.''
UN troops teamed up with the UN refugee agency to deliver hundreds of thousands
of tons of humanitarian supplies that kept Bosnians alive despite the raging
war around them, the statement added.
``In the process, 110 peacekeepers died, over 800 were wounded, hundreds were
taken hostage, some more than once,'' it said.
``They did their job; they did it well. This should not be forgotten.''-Reuter.

HEALTH workshops aimed at reducing stress among Aberdeen District Council staff
have proved a success. A three-day series of the health and well-being
workshops were held in October at the administrative buildings in Kittybrewster
and St Nicholas House and were attended by 493 employees, about one sixth of
the workforce.
Robbery bid
A JUVENILE was arrested after an attempted robbery at the sub-post office in
the village of Kirkgunzeon, near Dalbeattie, Dumfriesshire, yesterday. Police
said the sub-postmistress was unhurt and no weapon was involved.
Drugs case
POLICE raided a flat and seized 11 cannabis plants being grown in the loft,
Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard yesterday. University student Scott Fraser, 22, of
Westholm Avenue, Aberdeen, Stephen Kay, 21, of Elmfield Avenue, Aberdeen, and
Neil Forbes, 21, of Monreith Road, Newlands, Glasgow, admitted growing the
plants earlier this year. Sheriff David Kelbie deferred sentence until January
12.

A COUPLE who took part in a sadistic attack on a 79-year-old pensioner were
each jailed for eight years yesterday.
Mr Charles Wells suffered a fractured cheekbone as he was repeatedly punched in
the face. He was also forced to drink as a bottle of rum was thrust into his
mouth.
Temporary judge Alexander Wilkinson QC told Gail Hope and Earl Young at the
High Court in Edinburgh: ``You brought into reality what must be the nightmare
of any elderly person living on his or her own.......Such people must be
protected.''
Hope, of Ferry Road, Edinburgh, was found guilty unanimously of an assault on
Mr Wells in his Edinburgh home on August 20 this year during which he was
robbed of #20.
Young, of West Montgomery Place, Edinburgh, admitted assault and robbery.
The court heard that Mr Wells, a retired widower, used to go to a public house
for an hour every day to enjoy a pint of beer and read his newspaper.
He struck up an acquaintance with Hope and agreed to put her up for the night
after she phoned to say her boyfriend had put her out.
This happened on several occasions and he usually gave her a meal, a drink, and
cigarettes. Eventually he got fed up and on August 20 told her not to come back.
That afternoon, Young, whom he had never met, appeared at his door and claimed
that water was leaking from his kitchen into the flat below.
But when Mr Wells let him in, Young said: ``I am going to give you a going
over.'' Young then opened the door for Hope.
Hope got a bottle of rum from the kitchen and Young held the old man's wrists
while Hope tried to pour the drink down his throat.
Mr Wells said his lips were cut and bruised by the bottle. ``She kept pouring
the rum. Some was going into my mouth but most on my shirt and the chair until
the bottle was finished.''
Young punched him between 10 and 20 times on the face and chest. Mr Wells
added: ``He took his time. There were 10 to 15 seconds between punches, maybe
more.''
At one point Hope hit him over the back with a standard lamp.
Mr Wells told the court that his right cheekbone was fractured and he needed
stitches for a gash over his left eye.

Ann Shaw offers psychological advice on the gift of giving
IF YOU are knee-deep in wrapping paper or too exhausted with trekking around
shops, known as the ritual sacrifice of time by psychologists, you may still be
looking for some last-minute ideas for presents.
Remember that successful present giving depends less on the value of the gift
than on your ability to analyse accurately the personalities of your relatives
and friends. Yes - psychologists have been working away at this rich vein and
have recognised three distinct types.
The key is to tune into their needs. Knowing what drives a person is the most
effective way to understand likes and dislikes. The three motivations
identified are: affiliation, achievement, and power.
Those in the affiliation group want to please and make friends. They look at
the method of presentation more than the gift itself. With them it is the
thought that counts. Scented soap, genuine beeswax candles, books of handmade
paper or homemade cookies will all be appreciated.
In the achievement slot they are highly competitive, work hard, like flattery,
and are confident, active and determined. They see gifts as trophies - tokens
of the high esteem in which they believe they are held. Value certainly counts
with them. You're safe with any new fad or designer-labelled gift, desk toys,
car mascots, monogrammed pen or pencil or tickets to the hottest show in town.
The power people are driven by money - they are influential and leaders. They
prefer to give rather than to receive. Despite their success and wealth they do
like to receive gifts, provided they are appropriate, and useful. Look out for
army knives, credit-card holders, state-of-the-art desk or travel alarm clocks.
All this and much more is explained in Just What I've Always Wanted by Susannah
Constantine and Pia Marocco (Quadrille Publishing, #12.99). It makes a superb
gift in itself.
Once you realise what makes your family and friends tick present-giving is no
longer a lottery; you can buy and wrap with confidence.
Shirley Conran offers the best bit of advice: ``So that I'm never caught short
of a gift when I haven't time to shop (a chronic condition of the working
mother) I keep a permanent gift drawer for little gifts that I buy when I see
them; also in this drawer is a gift-wrapping box in which are scissors, a
Sellotape dispenser, white tissue and cream, narrow real satin baby ribbon; you
might try this with a more daring colour scheme.''
Remember some of the nicest gifts cost nothing. Conran says one of the most
thoughtful gifts she ever received was from her future mother-in-law who gave
her for Christmas a collection of photographs of her bridegroom as a little boy.
This brings me on to the subject of hand-made gifts. There is something extra
special about receiving a present that's been made, especially if it is edible.
For, despite the commercialisation of Christmas, an increasing number of people
do take pride in creating simple, thoughtful gifts. Not only is it cheaper but
it avoids High Street hassles.
Where do you start? Look no further than Mrs Beeton's Hand-Made Gifts (Ward
Lock, #15.99). Her book captures the real joy of giving. Here you will find
gifts for every occasion from Christmas to Mother's Day and wedding
anniversaries.
For those who like the challenge of making their own Christmas decorations, I
recommend Myra Davidson's excellent Christmas Crafts (Cassell, #10.99). It's a
bit late for this year, though, unless you are very nifty with a pair of
scissors and a sewing kit - but the book itself makes a good gift for anyone
keen on the crafts.

<HEADLINE>Secret document on conditions at the Royal Edinburgh lists more than 50 criticisms MP calls for inquiry at hospital</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By ROB ROBERTSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974798926</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE full extent of the concerns of an independent health watchdog about
conditions at a Scottish psychiatric hospital became apparent last night in a
secret six-page document studied closely by The Herald.
More than 50 points of criticism are contained in the minute of a three-hour
meeting between officials of the Scottish Health Advisory Service and managers
at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.
Last night, local Labour MP Nigel Griffiths wrote to Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth, asking him to launch an inquiry. Mr Griffiths is to meet patients'
representatives in the next few weeks.
A seven-strong team from the SHAS, an independent body funded by the Scottish
Office, spent five days investigating conditions at the hospital between
October 9 and 13. The document spells out major concerns over the hospital,
which has a staff of 630 and an annual budget of about #21m.
Among the points raised were:
q Concerns that patients were being discharged too quickly. Current discharge
procedures raised the risk of a breakdown of care when patients go into the
community.
q There was a strong case to reduce the bed numbers to at most 20 per ward,
maybe 15.
q They detected a sense of lack of involvement from the meeting the inquiry
team had with junior medical staff, which was rearranged because no-one turned
up for the first one.
q The practice of ``pinching'' nurses from one ward to staff another was
described as bad news and the nursing staff needed clear professional
leadership.
Fears were raised that there were too few nurses dealing with too many patients
in overcrowded wards. In some cases, patients felt unsafe and the agencies
involved at the hospital were not working as well together as they could.
Consultant staff said they felt left out of the strategic planning process and
the business plan and thought there was a lack of faith that things were being
fought for explicitly and loudly.
The standard of cleaning was described as ``abysmal'' and there were worries
that, if things such as catering problems arose at the hospital, the management
organisation would not be able to deal with them.
Last night, Dr Donald Rankin, director of the Scottish Health Advisory Service,
condemned the leaking of the document, which he insisted was not an SHAS report
but minutes of preliminary discussions between SHAS officials and the trust.
``This document has not come from anyone within this organisation. I deplore
the leaking of what is a confidential document before the final report has been
agreed and its contents made known to the trust and the health board.''
Dr Rankin said SHAS had never been afraid of criticising hospitals but its work
depended on maintaining confidentiality until it had drawn up its final report.
``We are working on a draft and will publish the report by the end of
January,'' he added.
The document does list 15 ``good features'' at the hospital, which included
educational work, various projects, and the positive attitude of clinical and
social work staff.
Mr Jim Kiddie, support worker with the Royal Edinburgh's patients, said
patients and their families had raised concerns over the staff levels and
conditions at the hospital at a number of meetings.
Mr Griffiths, MP for Edinburgh South, said he had visited the hospital in
February and raised his concerns on a number of issues with management. ``It
saddens me to see that, months later, the same problems are remarked on by the
inquiry team. Action must be taken at the hospital to improve conditions in the
light of this document,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for the Royal Edinburgh said last night she could not comment on
any matters at present because the hospital had not seen any report.

Bangkok, Tuesday
TREASURE hunters relying on a mystic monk and an 83-year-old nun are hunting
for a #250m hoard of gold they believe Japanese troops buried during the Second
World War.
The nun was the wife of a Japanese Imperial soldier during the construction of
the Death Railway, where thousands of Allied prisoners-of-war died building a
link between Thailand and Burma.
The site is near the famed Bridge on the River Kwai, 20 miles east of the
Burmese border.
The nun's claims to know the whereabouts of a train full of hidden Japanese war
treasure were taken seriously last week after a government excavating team
found a train line buried 6yd underground. The track led to a cave which
appeared to have been blocked with boulders and cement. On Saturday, the team
sealed off the area and posted army guards after finding three Second World War
train carriages buried under the rubble.
Deputy Education Minister Chaovarin Latthasaksiri said: ``I believe gold bars
might be buried there. Only the mad would have dug so deep to hide three
coaches loaded with stones.''
Today, an earth mover turned up only dirt and limestone. However, the Minister
vowed to continue the search.
The hunt was triggered by Thai businessman Tom Meesiri, who found a section of
the underground railway track after hiring a Buddhist monk to divine the
location of the hoard.

Moscow, Tuesday
RUSSIA'S triumphant communists today thundered towards seizing one-third of the
seats in the lower house of parliament, but Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
rejected their calls for big policy switches.
``Changes, shifts, sackings - nothing of the sort will happen,'' Chernomyrdin
insisted.
``Personnel changes have routinely taken place and will take place in future
but they have nothing to do with this election.''
The Kremlin said that Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin had discussed personnel issues
at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow where the president is recovering
from a mild heart attack, but no details were given.
``What is essential for us is stability and above all economic stability,''
said Chernomyrdin.
Rubbing salt in the wounds suffered by President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian
reformers, Communist Party candidates took 49 of the 195 single-seat
constituencies declared by mid-afternoon.
The communists also led Sunday's election to the State Duma with 21.5% of the
votes on a separate list which counts support for parties rather than
individuals.
Nationalists extremist led by the fiery Vladimir Zhirinovsky were second on
10.8% and Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia party was third on 9.7% support.
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov told a news conference: ``In all
probability we will have about 30% of the votes in the party list, and a little
bit more than that in single-seat constituencies.''
According to Interfax, government experts believe the communists are likely to
end up with around 150 out of the parliament's 450 seats.
They said Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party would win 49 seats from the
party list section and one constituency seat.
Our Home is Russia would win 43 party list seats in addition to at least 10
constituency seats, while the fourth-placed Yabloko party would get 37 list
seats and 12 constituency seats.
Many of the 225 constituency seats have been won by independents whose
allegiance is likely to be clear only when the Duma meets.
Zyuganov said his party would seek allies in parliament to strengthen its hand
and demanded shifts in economic policy.
However the Duma has little strength under a constitution which puts most power
in the hands of the president and Chernomyrdin at once ruled out any change of
direction after talks with Yeltsin.
``What is essential for us is stability and above all economic stability,''
Chernomyrdin said in a speech to the Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament.
The West has reacted calmly to the communists' success and financial markets
have been unruffled because they regard a presidential poll next June as more
important.
In Brussels, new Nato Secretary General Javier Solana vowed to expand the
Alliance eastwards to take in former Warsaw Pact countries, but said Nato must
co-operate with Moscow.
Zyuganov has warned Nato against expanding and said today the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not rush into new alliances.
Grigory Yavlinsky, whose liberal Yabloko party is fourth in the party list
section with 7.7% support, warned reformist groups must unite to fight the
communists in the presidential race.
Results were coming in much more slowly than expected. Some international
observers, who gave the vote a clean bill of health overall, said they were
concerned about the delays but election officials ruled out the possibility of
foul play.-Reuter.

Canberra, Tuesday
A BATTERED Australian Santa Claus has said he will no longer be coming to the
boisterous outback town of Bourke after he was attacked by a group of children.
Santa and an assistant elf fled to the police station for help and had to
continue their mission handing out sweets from a police wagon with a police
escort, Santa told reporters today.
``They were kicking me in the groin, pinching, punching in the kidneys, and
trying to grab the sweets and remove my disguise,'' said local businessman John
Holmes.
The attack on the 14st Holmes by 30 children aged eight to 13 occurred after a
carol-singing concert. ``I wouldn't have liked to be out in the open for
another five minutes,'' said Holmes.
It was the third time in three years that a Santa has come under attack in
Bourke. In 1993, a different Santa was dragged from his boat on the Darling
River and partly stripped.
Last year, children at a youth centre threw bottles at Holmes during his Santa
appearance. After the latest attack, he says he will not be donning the red
suit and white beard again.

<HEADLINE>Former Slimmer of Year tells of weight gain `fine'</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FORMER Young Slimmer of the Year told a court yesterday how she signed a
contract agreeing to pay a ``fine'' of #10,000 a week for every pound she went
over 10!s stones.
``I thought it was a good incentive to lose weight,'' Michele Deakin told
Liverpool Crown Court. It's a lot of money. But they didn't want me turning up
at promotions advertising the (diet) product weighing 20 stones again.''
She was giving evidence as a prosecution witness in the trial of Australian
Peter Foster, 32, former fiance of model Samatha Fox.
Mr Foster, of Hadley Wood, Barnet, north London, denies conspiring to supply
slimming granules under the name Deakin Diet, contrary to trading standard
rules.
Miss Deakin, 27, mother of four-year-old twin girls, was named Young Slimmer of
1988 by a magazine.
The court heard she was contacted by Mr Foster and persuaded to endorse his
diet product which consisted of guar gum, which swells up in the stomach and
makes people feel full.
However, she had never used it. Her weight loss from 22 stones to 10 stones was
entirely due to her own efforts.
In return, Miss Deakin, then 19, was to receive #1000 a week as long as she
stayed slim, plus royalties from the product. Yesterday, Miss Deakin said she
received only about #2000.
The jury heard that Miss Deakin appeared at a Liverpool court in April 1990
when she pleaded guilty to the same charge Mr Foster now faces.
She received a sentence of six months' imprisonment suspended for two years.
The trial continues.

Zurich, Tuesday
MILLIONAIRE Geo Mantegazza, one of Switzerland's richest men, was freed
tonight, a day after he was kidnapped.
He appeared in satisfactory health after his ordeal, said police.
Mantegazza, 67, was abducted from his office in the town of     Paradiso in the
Italian-speaking canton of Ticino yesterday.
Mantegazza is co-owner of the Swiss travel group Globus-Gateway Tours, which
includes the Cosmos holidays group and Monarch airline. His brother, Sergio,
runs the group from London. He also has several property firms.
A police statement announcing the businessman's release gave no further details
and did not indicate whether he had been freed by his kidnappers or by a police
operation.
However Alex Pedrazzini, president of Ticino canton, hinted in a radio
interview that no arrests had been made, saying a hunt was on for the
kidnappers.
Police commander Franco Ballabio had earlier kept a virtual blackout on details
of the kidnapping. ``A person's life is at stake,'' he said.
Police were earlier reported to have contacted Interpol about the kidnapping.
Italian police also helped in the case.
Swiss newspapers had speculated that Mantegazza had been taken over the border
into Italy.
There were unconfirmed reports that his wife had received threatening phone
calls, claiming that he would be killed if she informed police.
One Swiss newspaper said the family had received a ransom demand.
Such kidnappings are rare in Switzerland. Many rich and famous people choose to
live in the Alpine nation precisely because they feel assured of safety and
discretion.
Mantegazza lives in the lakeside southern city of Lugano with his second wife
and a four-year-old son.
The Mantegazza brothers were ranked among the 200 richest Swiss this month,
with estimated joint holdings of #1001m to #1700m. Monarch is one of Europe's
biggest privately-owned charter airlines.
The brothers also own luxury properties in Ticino and England.-Reuter.

A PLAN by health Ministers to make ``whistle-blowing'' on their colleagues a
contractual responsibility for doctors has been rejected by Greater Glasgow
Health Board.
The board has told the Scottish Health Department that it would be fraught with
difficulties.
Dr Harry Burns, director of public health, told the board meeting yesterday
that the plan would create a climate of fear and suspicion, and could be used
as a stick with which to beat doctors. Its main implication was that doctors
could be disciplined formally for failure or apparent failure to report
inadequate performance on the part of a colleague.
``We have a considerable amount of experience in the identification of
variations in the standard of clinical practice - that is one reason why we
have clinical audit.
``It is a subtle and complex matter. In many instances, apparent poor
performance is due to a combination of factors outwith the control of the
clinician and to put individual doctors in a position in which they could be
disciplined for failure to respond to evidence of poor clinical performance
which may be difficult to interpret is, in our view, unreasonable.''
Dr Burns acknowledged that there had been instances where clinical negligence
had been so gross that colluding in a cover-up would have amounted to
professional misconduct. However, the new legislation covering the General
Medical Council empowered it to deal with such cases.

BING Crosby's celebrated dream of a white Christmas could come true in
Scotland's cities this year, according to weather forecasters.
They say sub-zero temperatures are expected to arrive from the Arctic today and
remain until after Christmas Day, increasing the likelihood of a blanket of
snow falling in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen on Monday.
A white Christmas is, however, more likely in Aberdeen and Edinburgh than in
Glasgow because eastern parts of the country will suffer most from freezing air
coming from the North Pole.
The weather forecast meant bookmakers suffered another bout of the jitters
yesterday. William Hill is offering evens - down from 3-1 - on snow falling in
Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, Birmingham, and Nottingham on Christmas Day.
Heather Reid, a weather forecaster at Glasgow Weather Centre, said yesterday:
``It's possible that snow will fall in Glasgow and Edinburgh on Christmas Day.
``But I think Edinburgh stands a better chance than Glasgow because most of the
wintry weather will be on the east side of Scotland.''
She added: ``It's even more likely in Aberdeen.''
The odds on bets for a white Christmas have been sliding back in recent days.
William Hill spokesman, Mr Graham Sharpe, said shops were already facing a
six-figure payout if flakes fall on Monday.
Figures show that the last white Christmas in Glasgow was in 1980. The last
time snow fell on Christmas Day in Edinburgh was in 1962. Snow fell last on
Christmas Day in Aberdeen in 1993.
Snow flurries are forecast for the east and possibly in parts of the west today.

HERALD reader Patricia Bain got an early Christmas gift yesterday, a #16,000
sports car.
Mrs Bain received a new MGF - the first MG model to be built since 1980 - as
the winner of a competition run by The Herald, Rover MG, and Scottish MG
dealers.
Her husband Norman put his wife's name on the entry form, which was the first
correct one drawn from more than 18,000.
Mrs Bain, 41, an adult education tutor, of First Avenue, Netherlee, Glasgow
said: ``The MGF is a beautiful car, I just can't believe it's mine. I thought
someone was playing a joke on me at first.
``I've been driving for 20 years and I always fancied a sports car but I would
never have been able to buy one.''
Only 16,000 MGFs will be produced each year at the company's factory in
Longbridge, Birmingham.
The prize was presented at Shields Rover on St Andrews Road, Glasgow, where
owner Joe O'Donnell said the competition had provided a tremendous boost for
the car.
The competition question was ``What do the letters `MG' stand for?'' - Morris
Garages.

AN elderly man died last night after fire broke out in his flat at Cawdor
Terrace, Albany Street, Oban. Police were contacting relatives before releasing
his name.
Two other residents of the block, brothers Neil and Angus Campbell, and three
police officers who attended the scene, Constables Darryl Burnside, Alisdair
Barlow, and Derek Crooks, were treated for smoke inhalation at the Lorn and
Islands District General Hospital.
Climbers rescued
TWO climbers were rescued from one of the country's most treacherous ridges
last night by A Sea King helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth. Police in Inverness
said the men had been stranded on 3000ft Aonach Eagach. They were reported to
be safe and well.
Jobs threatened
HIGHLAND Council workers face an uncertain Christmas after it was announced a
further 180 jobs could be axed. The move follows a reduction of 65 white-collar
posts in the run-up to April's launch of the new authority.
Keep it clean
MOTORISTS face on-the-spot #20 fines in a police crackdown on roadway ``grime
crime'' - where number plates on cars, vans, and lorries are obscured by dirt.
A senior police officer at Lanarkshire's traffic department said fines would be
imposed under the Road Vehicles (Conditions and Use) Regulations, 1986.
Sellafield jobs
UP to 1000 jobs are to be created by a new #360m plant for treating nuclear
waste at Sellafield in Cumbria. The plant is to open in 2002.
Suicide pact
TWO schoolgirls made a suicide pact before one threw herself under a train and
the other threatened to jump off a bridge, police said today. One of the
15-year-olds dived under the wheels of a train as it approached Southampton
Central Station last night. She slipped between the tracks and the train passed
over her, leaving her unscathed. Her friend was spotted earlier in the day
threatening to jump off a bridge in Southampton.
Theft charge
A MAN charged with stealing about #853,000 from the Salvation Army over a
four-month period in 1992 was granted bail when he appeared before Bow Street
magistrates in London yesterday. Mr Stuart Christopher Ford, 44, unemployed,
formerly of Audley Road, Stetchford, Birmingham, was remanded on bail until
February 13 on condition that he surrender his passport and reside at an
address in Halifax, West Yorkshire.
Bedside vigil
ACTRESS Una Stubbs has pulled out of a play after her son collapsed with a
suspected brain haemorrhage. The 58-year-old star, who made her name as Alf
Garnett's daughter Rita in Till Death Us Do Part, travelled 200 miles to the
bedside of musician son Christian, 24, from the West Yorkshire Playhouse in
Leeds where she was starring in Peter Pan. A spokeswoman said Christian
successfully had undergone an operation to remove the clot at a London hospital
after he collapsed last week.
Christmas joy
FOREST Enterprise has stepped in to make sure an injured Portuguese worker has
a happy Christmas with his family. Manuel Da Fonceca Ribeiro suffered a spinal
injury in a fall while working for a contractor in Castle Douglas Forest in
Kirkcudbrightshire. He was taken to Dumfries Infirmary and it looked as if he
would not be able to get home for the festive season as his boss had returned
to the Continent. Yesterday, forestry bosses arranged to pay for Manuel's

A MASKED intruder who subjected a 56-year-old postmistress to a terrifying
ordeal after breaking into her home was ordered to be detained for six years
yesterday.
Mrs Christina Paterson's nightmare ended only after she told Sean Padden of her
fears she might never see her newly-born grand-daughter.
Padden, 20, who had been drinking and taking cannabis, admitted striking Mrs
Paterson repeatedly on the head with an air pistol to her injury on May 6 this
year after breaking into her home in Perth.
Mr James Campbell, advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh that Mrs
Paterson had fallen asleep in the living room but woke up to be confronted by a
figure armed with a gun and wearing a balaclava.
The man shouted at her and tied her thumbs together.
When she tried to run into the kitchen she was struck several times on the head
with the gun. Mrs Paterson told the intruder she feared she would never see her
newly-born grand-child and he calmed down, said he would not hurt her, and
left. Mrs Paterson told police she might know her attacker. She had known
Padden since he was a child and he lived just along the road.
Padden, of Murray Crescent, Perth, admitted the attack to police and said he
had climbed through an open window because he wanted to get in out of the cold.
Mr Brian McConnachie, for Padden, said his client accepted it must have been an
extremely terrifying ordeal for his victim and was genuinely remorseful.
Mr McConnachie said Padden had fallen out with his mother and step-father and
had been told to leave the family home. He had the air pistol because he
intended spending the night in nearby woods and wanted to scare off anything or
anyone that came near.
He had been drinking and smoking cannabis and when he saw the open window at
Mrs Paterson's house he climbed in. When she woke, she panicked, which induced
panic in him.
He believed he had struck her three or four times with the gun during a
struggle and was brought to his senses when Mrs Paterson mentioned her
grand-daughter.

SECONDARY schools in Edinburgh are facing the possibility of five-figure cuts
in their budgets next year because of the ``double whammy'' of severe capping
and the cost of local government reorganisation.
The warning came yesterday from Councillor Elizabeth Maginnis, convener of
Lothian region's education committee.
She said: ``It is a very grim situation indeed and makes a mockery of the
Government's predictions that education would be protected under its spending
plans. We are not crying wolf.''
Councillor Maginnis said prospects would have been less severe if the Scottish
Office had applied the more generous capping levels which will take effect in
England and Wales.
The shadow Edinburgh City Council has not had a definitive statement about its
grant-aided expenditure but has predicted a 10% cut across the board to take
account of capping and the cost of reorganisation.
Councillor Maginnis said: ``From discussions with colleagues across Scotland,
the picture is looking as severe as it is for Edinburgh.''

A FAMILY feud ended up before an industrial tribunal following the death of the
senior partner of a garden centre.
Miss Margaret MacDonald, 34, whose father Ronald died of cancer last year,
claimed she was forced out of her job at the garden centre by her father's
brother and her aunt.
She told a Glasgow industrial tribunal how the remaining partner, her uncle, Mr
Allan MacDonald, wanted to sell the entire ground, including the land where her
family home stood so that he could go to live at his house in Spain.
Then he said the nursery business, MacDonald Brothers, at Bogton Nurseries,
Muirend Road, Glasgow, was to continue as a going concern as it would fetch a
better price, Miss MacDonald claimed.
Miss MacDonald, of Glasgow Road, Stewarton, told the tribunal that she, her
mother Constance, her brothers Angus and Ian, her cousin David, and her Aunt
Patricia all worked at the nursery or garden centre.
Miss MacDonald told the tribunal of the strained relationship between her and
her aunt. ``It wasn't a normal relationship. I was tolerated, she was
tolerated. But it was a successful business and we didn't allow anything to get
in its way.''
After her father's death, Miss MacDonald claimed her Aunt Patricia began
interfering in the running of the shop at the garden centre, she was
countermanding instructions and staff began to leave.
She claimed she was left short-staffed at Easter, one of the busiest weekends
of the year and over May and June, the hottest and busiest summers she could
remember.
She had to give up her only day off and had to work weekends when her aunt went
on holidays and she was expected to cancel prior engagements.
``It was horrific and I complained to my uncle. Staff didn't know who to take
instructions from. Before my father's death, they took instructions from me but
now I was just an assistant like them.
``They started talking back to me. Pressure was such that I couldn't cope.''
Miss MacDonald said the incidents leading to her departure were a culmination
of events to get rid of her: ``I was a thorn in the flesh. They wouldn't have
to pay me redundancy and they got me out of the way.
``It got to the stage there was no other way out. I wanted to be there to see
what I had worked for, what I had slaved for, being sold.
``How would you feel when, the day after, someone changed the locks? I was
still living there and that is what happened. Next day, my cousin walked up and
took my job. Maybe he was only helping out, I don't know.''
Miss MacDonald said she told her uncle that circumstances were beyond her
control and the only way she could cope was to resign.
``I wanted him to turn round and say, `Margaret, what's wrong?' He wasn't
giving me any support.'' She agreed she was given a pay rise earlier this year.
The hearing continues in February.

IT was a sad day when Mr Happy - the only successful slogan and logo Glasgow
has ever had - was killed off.
However, according to new research by psychologists, the council leaders who
presided over his untimely demise may have been right. Being happy can stop you
thinking straight, they say.
The Roger Hargreaves character, who sold the city throughout the world in the
1980s with his infectious energy, was left out of the Year of Culture 1990 and
suspended officially in 1991, to be followed by a succession of forgettable
replacements.
Now, Dr Mike Oaksford and a team from Warwick University have concluded that
when it comes to logical deduction, happy people do not perform well. In fact,
the reasoning strategies observed in positive-minded people were similar to
those seen in patients who had suffered damage to the frontal lobes of the
brain.
In a paper presented yesterday at the British Psychological Society's
conference in London, Dr Oaksford and his team found that both positive and
negative mood states impaired reasoning performance.
However, for certain problems specifically set up to test deductive thought
processes, only the subjects in a happy mood performed badly.
Glasgow District Council chiefs did order Mr Happy to be dusted off again last
year to highlight the city's image.
It was all very low key but it could no doubt provide the British Psychological
Society with an agenda for a new conference.

THE people of Nairn on the Moray Firth can be a reserved lot. Thus a number of
them were surprised to be asked about their sex lives. In particular whether
they were heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual.
Some no doubt did not know what a bi was but they were pretty sure they had
never had sex with one.
Then there was the question about their ethnic origins, whether they were
black, or even if they were not Highlanders but from elsewhere.
It sounded, perhaps, as if some race group was monitoring whether there were
too many white settlers taking over in the town just north-east of Inverness.
The nosey-parkers however were simply the local housing association, the Albyn
Housing Society, which next month takes over 80 houses in Nairn from Scottish
Homes, the Government housing agency. In order to show that it did not
discriminate against minorities in its housing allocation, it had to ask
tenants some searching questions.
However, the Rev Bill Wallace, of the Church of Scotland's board of social
responsibility, was not happy: ``I cannot see any positive purpose in this. It
is stirring up issues which do not exist in the Highlands.
``There is a real danger that this sort of thing could open up a Pandora's Box
of resentment about outsiders and minorities. Highland communities have always
been open and friendly and we have a traditional reluctance to pigeonhole
people in this way,'' he said.
Albyn, which manages 1300 houses throughout the Highlands, explained that it
had to gather information on sexuality, race, religion, and disability to show
that it did not discriminate.
Senior housing officer David Brookfield said: ``The information we will gather
through this survey is for monitoring our equal opportunities policy and will
be treated in the strictest confidence.''

<HEADLINE>Stagecoach runs into merger snag Perth-based bus group awarded the first passenger rail franchise</HEADLINE>

WITHIN hours of Perth-based bus group Stagecoach being awarded the first
passenger rail franchise, the Office of Fair Trading raised the possibility of
a monopolies investigation.
Coming from a fellow Government department, the OFT view could be considered an
embarrassment to the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf), which would
have been hoping that the letting of the South West Trains franchise to
Stagecoach would go without a hitch.
Labour has also called for the intervention of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Stagecoach is no stranger to the MMC, which recently accused it of ``predatory
and deplorable'' actions in putting a municipal bus company in Darlington out
of business.
In contrast, Opraf said of Stagecoach: ``They are good value for money, they
have a commitment to running a really good business to the benefit of
passengers, they are in the business for the long term, and they have a dynamic
management team.''
Stagecoach, which already runs buses in South West Trains' territory and plans
to provide dedicated bus feeder services to some rail stations, is set to move
on to the rails early in the New Year.
However, an OFT official said yesterday: ``I would certainly expect us to be
looking at it.
``As far as we are concerned, it is just another merger. We are concerned with
the effects on competition because we have one transport company taking over
another transport company, albeit different forms of transport.''
The OFT would advise Mr Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, on whether
or not he should refer Stagecoach's acquisition of South West Trains to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
An MMC official said: ``I am sure all the Government departments will be having
a think about whether we should be looking at it. At the moment, nothing has
happened, so we will have to wait and see.''
Former ScotRail chairman, Mr John Cameron, Stagecoach's rail adviser and a
director of the post-privatisation South West Trains, welcomed the ``real
prospect of providing an integrated service between rail and bus transport''
and believed this would encourage the use of public transport.
Mr Cameron said, because rail privatisation was a ``very regulated'' process,
Stagecoach was committed to certain criteria which he believed would ensure the
company did not run into conflict with the OFT.
Stagecoach, which intends to bid for all of the rail franchises including
ScotRail, plans to upgrade stations in the South West Trains' network and
improve passenger information.
Pay, conditions, and pensions of the 4000 staff would all be protected but
Stagecoach admitted that ``some staff cuts'' might be required although it was
hoped that these could be achieved through voluntary redundancy and early
retirement.
Stagecoach, which is acquiring South West Trains for a nominal sum, will
receive a subsidy of #54.7m in the first year of the franchise. For 1995/96,
the Government earmarked #83.4m of financial support for the train operating
company within the public sector.
In current prices, Stagecoach's subsidy will gradually decline to #40.3m in
2002/03, averaging #49m over the seven-year life of the franchise.
Stagecoach will provide guarantees of #42m in respect of its franchise
obligations, including a #21m performance bond.
South West Trains operates suburban and mainline services out of London's
Waterloo to more than 200 stations, principally in south-west London, Surrey,
Hampshire, and Dorset. The biggest of the 25 franchises being sold off in terms
of passenger revenues, it employs nearly 4000 people, runs more than 1000
trains and carries nearly 100 million passengers each year.
Although Stagecoach is pledged to run improved services on about half the
current subsidy, Labour transport spokesman Brian Wilson claimed the company
was only obliged contractually to provide 86% of the current timetable in light
of the minimum passenger service requirements specified by Opraf.
Calling for a monopolies inquiry, Mr Wilson said: ``Usually, the OFT are
running round the country trying to catch up with Stagecoach. On this occasion,
they have the opportunity to pre-empt developments.''
Opraf, aware that South West Trains is a busy commuter network covering an area
where railways have ``considerable monopoly power'', said a wide range of fares
would be regulated.
However, only 47% of South West Trains' passenger revenue will be subject to
fares regulation.
Stagecoach chairman Brian Souter said he was bidding for all available
franchises and was particulary keen to concentrate on other London commuter
services where be believed a largely captive market was getting a raw deal.
``You have to take out a bank loan to get on to a train down here,'' he said on
leaving the official launch ceremony of the first privatised franchise staged
at the QE2 Conference centre in Westminster.
Despite the likelihood of the bulk of Stagecoach operations being sited in the
London area, the company had no intention of quitting where skilled staff were
available and the quality of life in Perth was superior.
Transport Secretary Sir George Young said: ``This is the most important
announcement for passengers since the privatisation process began. People will
be able to see for themselves the quality of service being offered by those in
the franchise bidding process.''
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail union, issued an early
warning to Stagecoach against redundancies, stressing that he could not see to
run more services, or even run the existing services, and cut jobs at the same
time.
Franchising contracts covering Great Western Trains out of London Paddington
and LTS (London, Tilbury, and Southend) are imminent and could be finalised
today and the second tranche of contracts, including the East Coast Main Line,
are due to be let early next year.
The pressure group Save Our Railways yesterday conceded defeat over the first
batch of franchises and ended, at least temporarily, its High Court action.
Shares in the Perth-based company yesterday leapt 11p to 293p.

Keith Bruce, while hissing at Hook, finds himself enchanted by Scottish
Ballet's Peter Pan production
THIS is the story our parents did not warn us about; instead, they read it to
us as they tucked us up in bed. J.M Barrie's Peter Pan has become more potent
with every passing paranoia of the 90s.
From the weird and incomprehensible world of Michael Jackson and his Neverland
retreat - a phenomenon that makes Presley's Graceland excesses look like a
study in showbusiness mediocrity - to the reality of the Jamie Bulger killing
and media anxiety about loss of innocence in our youngsters, this tale of the
boy who declined to grow up is a parable of our times.
Alongside Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, it is one of the most
enduring contributions Scotland has made to our twentieth-century
commonplaceness. Children's literature, drilled into us all at an early age,
has the power to do what adult books cannot. The continuing enthusiasm among
the pre-schools for images of pirates can be traced back to those two books.
It stays with us all our life and the notion of piracy as something undoubtedly
illegal but neither evil nor wicked, and worthwhile if only to keep the
bureaucrats at bay, finds a home in each successive technological advance. Home
taping is killing music? That'll be right.
While Stevenson's Jim Hawkins undergoes a lesson in life, Barrie's Peter
presents problems that have had literary analysts reaching for their Freudian
analogies. How quickly we forget what the story meant to us as we grew up.
First there was the phase of flying. Headlong jumps from the first landing that
ended in tears. A lesson in life every bit as profound as Jim-lad's.
Then we begin to wonder about the boy's relationship with Wendy - this usually
dawns alongside the realisation that avoiding growing up is not an option and
girls are not necessarily to be universally despised. Later still, we twig what
Tinkerbell's problem is - a crucial lesson - and that rich tapestry of all our
future dealings with the opposite sex is set in a mixture of marshmallow and
concrete in our hearts. Goethe might have invented the concept of romantic
love, but Barrie simplified the equation.
Self-knowledge will later normally allow us to identify some continuing
Pan-like tendencies, but the memory of that bumpy landing on the lobby floor
will still keep most of us on the right side of fantasy.
All of which makes Scottish Ballet's Peter Pan the show of the Scottish festive
season, the storytelling genius of Stuart Paterson (to be seen in Dundee,
Edinburgh, and Stirling) notwithstanding.
Ignore the dance critics on this one, because they have their own agenda, which
most of the Christmas theatre audience probably care little about. There is
nothing particularly awful about the dancing here. I've seen Scottish Ballet
much worse. This is charming and light and they neither bump into one another
nor get seriously out of time with the music.
If Graham Lustig's choreography is neither disciplined classical ballet nor
exciting modern dance, so what? The narrative drive to the piece is actually
very impressive, particularly in the current revised version.
It was only at the very beginning, before he adapted to the pace of the story -
and impatient for the departure of Mr &amp; Mrs Darling and the entrance of our
hero - that my three-year-old asked: ``When is the Mummy going to go?''
Margaret Woznica's design suits both this narrative directness and the seasonal
nature of the show. No fussiness or ambiguity here. Eddie McGuire's music is
quite simply perfect. Easy to listen to and appreciate but far from dumb, his
use of Scottish traditional music is appropriate to the author's origins and to
the folk-tale spirit of the piece.
I saw the show - for a second time - at a matinee packed with kids. Unbidden,
we hissed Captain Hook and a gesture from Rupert Jowett's Pan had us applauding
Tinkerbell back to consciousness (you'd forgive a girl like that anything). We
loved the cutesy crocodile and believed a boy could fly. That'll do me for an
afternoon.
n.Peter Pan is at Glasgow's Theatre Royal to December 30.

SCOTLAND'S enterprise network is losing one of its leading executives. Archie
Bethel, chief executive of Lanarkshire Development Agency, has announced he is
going back to the private sector, writes KEN SMITH.
He is joining Motherwell Bridge, Scotland's largest private engineering
company, as managing director of its manufacturing division.
His resignation comes only days after Secretary of State Michael Forsyth
announced a 7.5% cut-back in funding for Scottish Enterprise and its satellite
enterprise companies. However, the two events are not connected.
Mr Bethel was the only local enterprise company chief executive recruited from
the private sector when the network was established in 1991, and it was always
anticipated that he would return at some point.
He said yesterday that despite the cut-back he still believed the funding was
available for the major development and job-creation programmes currently
planned.
LDA is Scotland's second largest Government-funded enterprise company and, with
the others, will learn what its budget for next year will be from Scottish
Enterprise's headquarters in January.
Mr Bethel is staying with LDA until the end of March.

<HEADLINE>FAO calls for rise in cereal output</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974799036</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has warned that
world cereal output must rise at least 4% in 1996 to safeguard food security.
A new report by the FAO, the UN ``watchdog'' on food supply, added a warning
that dwindling stocks and high prices may damage some poorer Third World
nations.
``With 1995 crop estimates now much firmer, it is certain that cereal stocks
will be drawn down sharply even to meet the reduced consumption requirements
now expected,'' its latest Food Outlook said.
``This will mean continuing high cereal import costs with possible serious
implications for low-income, food-deficit countries.''
The agency said the world needed bigger harvests in 1996 to ensure food
security. ``To meet only the currently expected below-trend utilisation in
1996-97 and to prevent a further erosion of world cereal stocks, a minimum
increase of 4% will be required,'' it said.
The FAO said its latest forecast for 1995 world cereal output was 1.883 billion
tonnes - eight million tonnes less than it last forecast in September.
Cereal stocks were expected to fall by 47 million tonnes to 226 million tonnes
in 1996-97. ``At this level, the ratio of cereal stocks to trend utilisation in
1996-97, at 14% to 15%, would be well below what the FAO secretariat considers
the minimum necessary to safeguard world food security,'' it said.
The FAO said a draw on stocks was expected despite a likely decrease in global
cereal consumption by some 2% in 1995-96. The decrease was a result of a sharp
drop in animal feed use in developed countries because of high prices.
Its current forecast for 1995 world cereal output would be 64 million tonnes or
3.3% below the revised estimate of production last year.

<HEADLINE>Larry Fish becomes Royal Bank's highest paid director as Peter Wood sees income slump by #24m Citizens chairman earns #1.5m</HEADLINE>

LARRY Fish has replaced Peter Wood as the most highly paid director of the
Royal Bank of Scotland.
The chairman of the extremely successful Citizens retail banking subsidiary in
New England earned #1,547,000 in the year to September, whereas Mr Wood, who
founded the Direct Line insurance business, saw his total slump from
#24,466,000 to just #486,000.
The previous year he gained #13m from the buy-out of his interests in Direct
Line as well as a #7,064,000 pension fund top-up and a #4m bonus.
The annual report shows that chairman Lord Younger had a comparatively modest
uplift from #226,000 to #242,000, while chief executive Dr George Mathewson,
who still has a three-year contract, was just #8000 better off at #485,000.
It also shows that the board has exercised substantial numbers of share
options. Dr Mathewson was sitting on a profit before tax of #1.44m and
operations director Norman McLuskie realised #727,000.
Unfortunately for them, they sold at 465p rather than waiting until the
takeover fears swept the City. These drove the price up to a peak of 658p last
week, although the shares have retreated rapidly, dropping another 17p to 568p
yesterday.
Last Friday, corporate and institutional director Iain Robertson exercised
options over 80,000 shares or more than half his option holding at 620p for a
#341,000 profit.
Retail banking director Tony Schofield is now the biggest option holder at
275,000 with a striking price of 193p.
The Royal is the first bank to comply fully with the Greenbury Code on
disclosure of directors' remuneration.
Citizens has been a major achievement for Dr Mathewson. When it was acquired in
1988, there was a widespread feeling it would not amount to very much and
certainly not reach his target of contributing 10% of group earnings.
But it has consistently out-performed its peer group and is the only bank in
New England not to have incurred losses in the recession in the early nineties.
Profits in the last five years have leapt from #11m to #107m. In contrast, the
parent had a rocky period in 1991 and 1992, the nadir being when profits from
the on-going businesses fell to #32m before bounding ahead three years later to
last time's total of #602m.
That meant the Royal is the only British bank not to have lost money in the US
- there have been tales of woe from Barclays, HSBC with its Marine Midland
subsidiary, and National Westminster before John Tugman got to grips with
NatWest Bankcorp.
The major reason Midland is now a subsidiary of HSBC is its disastrous purchase
of Crocker National Bank in California which was stuffed full of dud property
and Latin American loans.
The greatest humiliation was that the sale of Crocker's head office prevented
Midland actually falling into the red.
Citizens has concentrated on making acquisitions within 100 miles of its
Providence, Rhode Island, headquarters. That has enabled it to grow its
customer base with less risk than if it had cherry picked takeover
opportunities across the US.

GARY Armstrong expects to sign the contract which will take him to Newcastle
within the next few days.
Lawyers acting for the Scotland scrum half and Sir John Hall's new superclub
have been examining the contract in detail for a fortnight but yesterday
Armstrong said all had now been agreed and there remained only the formality of
an official signing.
Armstrong made his debut for the club during a guest appearance when Newcastle
played Transvaal last month and expects to be involved in the latter part of
the Tynesiders' Courage League II programme early in the new year.
The three-year deal, worth more than #150,000, will see Armstrong form a
half-back partnership with England's Rob Andrew who moved from Wasps and
sacrificed his international career in order to become Newcastle's director of
rugby on five-year contract reputed to be worth #750,000.
Armstrong's fellow Borderer Doddie Weir is also still involved in negotiations
with Newcastle and, along with Dean Ryan, Tony Underwood, and Nick Popplewell,
the new recruits will form the spearhead of Andrew's plan to gain promotion to
the English first division and, ultimately, to play in Europe and realise Sir
John's dream of making Newcastle the biggest rugby club in Europe.
Yesterday, Armstrong, 29, said: ``Everything has now been agreed and although
it will be a wrench to leave Jed-Forest I now just want to get the contract
signed and get down to business in Newcastle.
``It's a huge challenge but it's one that I'm looking forward to. I expect to
hear from Rob Andrew within the next few days and then we can get the signing
over and take it from there,'' he said.
q PROTRACTED negotiations aimed at placing the Scotland international squad
under contract to the SRU are nearing completion and pen will be put to paper
any day now.
The Herald understands that the players stand to earn about #3000 a game this
season, making some #15,000 in total, plus a #5000 retainer and bonuses
depending on where the side finishes in the Five Nations tournament. The
concept of win-bonuses for individual games has, apparently, been kicked into
touch.

<HEADLINE>Federal Reserve cuts rates</HEADLINE>

AMERICAN short-term interest rates have been reduced by a quarter-of-a-point,
for the second time this year, by the US Federal Reserve. It is a move which
should cheer Wall Street which had suffered a 101.5-point fall in the Dow Index
on Monday, its biggest one-day decline in eight years.
Against the background of the continuing impasse over the Federal budget, which
meant that the release of yesterday's expected batch of US economic data has
been delayed, hopes had been fading that the authorities would cut rates
although earlier expectations and market sentiment had been for a small
reduction.
It should also be good news for UK shares which normally take their lead from
Wall Street which had shown some recovery early on yesterday. However, the
problem of the federal budget could continue to act as a dampener. The FTSE-100
Index closed down 19.2 points at 3576.9 but at one stage it had been down over
37 points following Monday's 46.5-point fall, recovering some ground after Wall
Street's steady opening.
The cut in US rates lowered the federal funds rate that commercial banks charge
each for overnight loans by a quarter-percentage point to 5.5%. The Fed left
the discount rate that it charges banks for money unchanged at 5.25%.
``Since the last easing of monetary policy in July, inflation has been somewhat
more favourable than anticipated,'' central bank chairman Alan Greenspan said
in a statement.
``This result, along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations,
warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions,'' he added.
The cut, by the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee,
followed a string of statistics showing the economy softening after a
surprisingly strong rise in the third quarter.
Some analysts had questioned whether the central bank would cut rates while the
Republican-led Congress and the Clinton administration were still battling over
the budget.
But Fed officials had argued interest rate policy should not be held hostage to
political manoeuvring over the budget and should be free to respond to changes
in the economy.

GLAXO Wellcome is selling its half-interest in the Warner Wellcome joint
venture for $1050m (#683m) in line with its strategy of concentrating on
prescription-only drugs, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The venture was agreed in July 1993 to develop and market consumer products
globally which included Warner Lambert, Wellcome - then independent of Glaxo -
and some of the Glaxo over-the-counter medicines, including the Zantac
heartburn product group.
Glaxo Wellcome will continue to supply ``switch products'' or medicines which
are being transferred from prescription to over-the-counter status.
These include Zantac 75, Beconase for hay fever, and Zovirax cold-sore cream.
It is selling the original Wellcome ``sniffs and sneezes'' products such as
Actifed and Sudafed and Calpol.
In the half-year to June, Glaxo Wellcome's share of profits in the joint
venture amounted to #38m including Wellcome's share prior to the #9000m hostile
takeover.
The prospect of finding a large sum to cut its #3500m debt helped reduce an
earlier 27p fall in the share price to just 7p at 878p by the close.

LEX Gold, the former civil servant who helped give the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) a stronger profile in Scotland, now plans to do the same for
Scottish Chambers of Commerce.
Mr Gold finished a two-year stint as director of CBI Scotland last month. He
will take up a part-time appointment as director general of Scottish Chambers
on January 3.
``For some time now they have been looking to establish a presence at a
national level . . . it is a big job and I am looking forward to doing it,'' he
said.
Mr Gold said Scottish Chambers, which claims to be the country's biggest
business organisation, should make its voice better heard in policy areas such
as transport, tourism, European affairs, education and training.
But he added that it should remain politically neutral on the thorny issue of
devolution, asking only what the economic consequences of a parliament in
Edinburgh would be.
Mr Gold said Scottish Chambers' 8000 members had a wide range of views on the
constitutional aspects of devolution, but they were united on one thing: ``They
want to see their businesses develop and grow and their primary interest is in
getting the right conditions.''
They were asking themselves: ``What does it mean in terms of the business
community? Is it going to raise costs or is it going to provide
opportunities?'' he said.
``I think there are plans to take that debate on the business issues in
devolution around the regions in Scotland as part of the Chambers' activities.''
Mr Gold said he would start his new job by undertaking a round of consultations
with the organisation's grass roots.
``The first thing I intend to do is to go around and listen to what the
chambers say. I don't come with a package of measures which I intend to impose
upon them,'' he said.
Mr Gold stressed he had not deliberately left CBI Scotland to work for a rival
business organisation.
He said he had only agreed to take on the CBI job for two years after a 33-year
career in the civil service. When he left he had no idea he would be approached
for the Scottish Chambers' post.
This became vacant in July when Charles Winter, the previous director general,
stepped down due to heart trouble. Mr Winter, who had been chief executive of
Royal Bank of Scotland, began the task of giving Scottish Chambers a higher
profile.
Peter Dunn, a Scottish Chambers director from Fife who is a noted enthusiast of
home rule, stepped into the breach temporarily after Mr Winter's departure.
Mr Dunn's interpretation of a recent Scottish Chambers survey of members'
attitudes to devolution ruffled feathers among some firms opposed to any change
in direct rule from Westminster.
The CBI, which has 1500 1member companies in Scotland, welcomed Mr Gold's new
appointment. ``Naturally we are wishing Lex well in his new job,'' said Paul
Walker, the spokesman of CBI Scotland.
Mr Gold said he hoped to continue working closely with the CBI, as well as
other organisations such as Scottish Financial Enterprise and Scottish Council
Development and Industry, to achieve a common stance on key business issues.
He will receive #20,000 a year for spending three days a week at Scottish
Chambers, less than the #30,000 he earned working full-time at CBI Scotland,
but then again, he is not doing it for the money.
``It is the nature of the challenge that attracts me,'' said Mr Gold, who
played football for Rangers and worked briefly as a journalist before starting
his career in the civil service.
He will divide his remaining time between voluntary organisations such as the
Scottish Training Advisory Group (STAG) for disabled people and Apex Scotland,
an organisation that helps ex-offenders.
``I have also had two or three approaches which I am currently considering for
gainful employments. Just watch this space,'' he added.

THE advantage dancing on skates has over a regular sprung floor lies in the
great circular sweeps of the stage, the gyroscopic spirals and the ability to
glide backwards at much speed with effortless grace. The disadvantages are much
the same.
Once you've seen the characters from Alice in Wonderland sweep, spiral, and
glide, there's not much to be said about a troupe of jazz hoofers sweeping,
spiralling and gliding, or an army of Charlie Chaplins, or a gang of futuristic
robots. Hot Ice, choreographed by Phil Winston and directed by Amanda Thompson,
has more to do with rapid and multiple costume changes than it does
attention-grabbing dance.
The numbers that work best tend to involve just one or two skaters who are
allowed time and space to show off their technical skills and impressive
acrobatic ability. These are usually set to the more primal musical pieces
where rhythm is everything, although there's also a nice duet to When I Fall in
Love. More typically, the performance is as humourless as the self-important
soft rock songs that top and tail the show, all broad gestures, bland grins and
po-faced scowls.
Ofpants, the official panto watchdog, was laid up in bed (it's a testing time
of year), which is just as well, given the lack of effort to engage the
under-10s, notwithstanding Alice and an unsophisticated football spoof (Michael
Clark eat your heart out).
Far more diverting are the stunning laser effects (``Lovely to look at,'' says
the theatre's programme and you can't fault it for honesty), but even the
bizarrely diverse range of influences from Gershwin to the formation of the
universe, can't disguise the production's lack of soul.

HOWDEN Group is managing to hold its head comfortably above water during a
difficult time for the engineering industry.
Its order book for specialist equipment, ranging from fans and compressors to
pasta-making machines and drilling rigs, rose 26% to a record #243m during the
six months to October 31.
The Renfrew-based group enjoyed particularly strong business in the Far East
and also traded well in Europe and South Africa.
But profit growth was restrained by high manufacturing costs in the US and
Canada and a poor performance in Germany.
The strong mark and low demand for tunnelling equipment from the depressed
construction industry meant its German subsidiary, Wirth, barely broke even,
but this had been expected.
Group operating profits increased 10% to #13.5m as turnover rose 9% to #211.6m
and profit margins were maintained at 6.3%.
But profits before tax grew only 4% to #11m, held back by higher interest
charges as gearing crept up to 47% from 37% at the start of the period.
``It is a pretty good performance in what we know are difficult markets for
engineering companies generally,'' said analyst Richard Andrews at Edinburgh
stockbroker Bell Lawrie White.
But the overall result was ``just a little more depressed than had been
hoped''. Although Howden shares firmed 1p to 68p, Mr Andrews is cutting his
full-year profit forecast to #33.5m from #35.0m.
Howden's corporate services director, Alan Maclachlan, said the explosion of
new orders included a spate of small contracts worth less than #5m in the Far
East.
Howden said its recently established fan businesses in Malaysia and Singapore
had ``performed beyond expectations'' and the construction of its fan and heat
exchanger factory in China was proceeding smoothly. The Chinese factory should
open next summer with ``a reasonable order book''.
Gearing should sink back towards 40% by the end of the financial year, but no
major acquisitions are planned following a spate of purchases around the globe
over the last three years.
Only 20% of Howden's turnover is now generated in the UK. About 30% comes from
North America and 17% from Continental Europe. The remaining 33% comes from
emerging markets in the Far East, Africa and Latin America.
The widespread nature of Howden's business makes the firm confident about its
prospects.

SCOTTISH Milk, the farmers' co-operative which succeeded the old Milk Marketing
Board, said yesterday it was heartened by the support it had received during a
series of ``meet the members'' presentations. By the end of this week the
management team will have addressed 15 meetings from Kelso to Kintyre.
Deregulation of the dairy industry has concentrated the minds of producers on
whether their interests are best served by staying with the co-operative or
transferring to one of the increasing band of purchasers seeking direct
supplies.
The Scottish Milk meetings have been attended by 1000 of the 18000 active
members in the co-op.
John Duncan, Scottish Milk chairman, said there was support for the broad
policies being pursued by the company - to maximise efficiency, implement cost
savings wherever possible and offer members enthusiastic leadership.
``We believe farmers have gone home from the meetings feeling confident that
their co-op can deliver the kind of returns they are looking for as milk
producers.''
On the key issue of price comparisons, he advised members to check any offers
from alternative outlets with their area manager. Past experience had shown
that prices quoted by competitors needed to be properly interpreted by each
individual producer, he warned.
At the meetings managing director Jack Pirie pointed out that in the first 12
months of trading Scottish Milk paid members on average 1.5p a litre more than
the old SMMB did. ``In any other commercial sphere that kind of progress would
have made headlines,'' he said.
Milk Marque in England had established the standard litre which had 4.1%
butterfat and 3.35% protein, and for that quality it paid 24.75p a litre, he
added. All comparison stemmed from that figure but not all milk conformed to
the standard litre. Scottish Milk expected to pay about 25.5p a litre for 4.1%
butterfat and 3.3% protein.
``With this to build on, together with our high standards of service to both
customers and members, we are optimistic about our ability to compete in the
market place.''
The most important figure for members' milk prices was income net of costs, he
said. Scottish Milk had been working, with some measure of success, to reduce
costs and was in the middle of discussions with its haulage contractors about
major changes aimed at achieving further significant savings.
A number of industry commentators have, in recent weeks, been emphasising the
importance of a strong co-operative remaining in the dairy sector. That theme
was taken up by John Duncan at the producers' meetings he addressed.
The vast majority of producers wanted to be part of a body owned by them and
managed for their benefit, he said. ``They want an organisation that will seek
to maximise returns to members in the long term, offer them collective strength
in the market place, and secure a wide spread of customers in order to spread
the risk.
``The concept of producers working together with collective strength is right -
but some make the mistake of thinking about Scottish Milk as an alterative
buyer of their milk. Such an attitude is all about the short term. Instead,
producers must think about their security in the long term. Only a strong
Scottish Milk can provide that.''

THE Scottish Salmon Growers' Association has welcomed the introduction by the
European Union of a minimum import price for Norwegian salmon.
Phillip Thorn, chairman of the association, said it was the first stage in
addressing the problem of massive over-production in Norway.
Further measures were being discussed with the European Commission, said Mr
Thorn. ``I am disappointed that they have only implemented the minimum price
for whole fish, and have omitted fillets,'' he added.
``However, I am sure the EU processing industry will also be most concerned and
we will be pressing for their inclusion.''
The SSGA would be working for the introduction of more effective medium and
longer-term measures including volume controls on Norwegian exports to the EU,
he said.
Meanwhile, Moray Seafoods, already one of the largest shellfish producers in
Britain, is about to invest #350,000 to increase production and raise
processing standards.
The company, which has 250 employees at its plant in Buckie, has recorded 15%
increases in turnover for the last two financial years and is on target for a
30% rise in sales this year.
Grant Eckersley, Moray Seafoods' managing director, said: ``We have decided to
rebuild our coldwater prawn processing unit again from scratch and provide the
most modern environment with full separation for high care product processing
and packaging operations.''
The company is also installing new machinery which will halve energy costs
while cooking prawns more gently and evenly.

Michael Tumelty profiles a noteworthy group who ensure our music is well
accounted for
IT IS largely unseen, unheard, and unheralded. The general public is probably
not aware of its existence. Many in the music business will only be dimly aware
of its function or location. But the Scottish Music Information Centre (SMIC)
is a vital component in the engine room of musical Scotland, providing the fuel
for the smooth running of much of the musical life in the country. Literally.
If you attend a concert by the Paragon or Hebrides Ensembles, the Chamber Group
of Scotland, or any of the orchestras which happen to be performing a work by a
Scottish composer, new or old, the probability is the music - score and parts -
being performed was prepared and issued by the Scottish Music Information
Centre.
If you read a book, or an article in a newspaper or specialist magazine which
touches on Scottish music; if you attend a lecture, see a slide show, or hear a
radio talk on the subject; part at least of the information therein is likely
to have originated in, or have been verified by, SMIC.
``We're not a performing or promoting body, not a library, not a museum,'' says
Kirsteen McCue, general manager of the centre. ``We're all of these, and that's
our real strength. We feel that we're a unique organisation in Scotland.''
Unique it certainly is. Tucked away on the top floor of a west end building in
Glasgow owned by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology, the Scottish
Music Information Centre is a vast storage house - a treasure trove - of
Scottish music.
It has a manuscript collection which is priceless, containing around 9000
scores of works by over 300 Scottish composers, dating back to the sixteenth
century and earlier, and a reference facility which can provide you with every
scrap of biographical or professional information you might require about any
aspect of Scottish musical life.
It holds a unique collection of around 4000 recordings of Scottish music, many
archival, many from broadcasts given by the BBC, and many privately-made,
non-broadcast recordings which are the sole record of works that received only
one performance.
Now, in a continuing extension of its more public face - SMIC has been
associated with a number of projects over the years, from a festival of
Icelandic music to the large-scale Scotland's Music exhibition - the
information centre is undertaking its first commercial venture with the
publication of the Scottish Music Handbook.
An invaluable reference tool for anyone involved in any aspect of the business,
from education to performance,  the handbook, launched recently by
percussionist Evelyn Glennie, should instantly find a place in every public
library and school, college or university music department in the country. (See
Handbook review on this page.)
The production of the book would have been inconceivable only a few years ago,
and is a reflection of the recent dramatic change in status and function of the
information centre.
Founded in the sixties as the Scottish Music Archive by Professor Fred Rimmer
of Glasgow University's music department, the centre was originally sited on
university premises and had a specific function: to build up a national
resource of musical materials.
``Most of our composers don't have a publisher,'' says McCue, touching on one
of the most controversial issues in Scottish musical affairs. ``Therefore their
music is not copyright, and is not automatically kept in one of the main
deposit libraries in Britain.''
HE adds: ``If it wasn't for the fact that Fred Rimmer set up the archive to
pull all of that material together, it would be lost, scattered, with
composers, in people's houses...... not accessible.''
In the mid-eighties, the function of the archive was broadened. It became an
information centre, part of an international network, and its scope was
extended to include dissemination as well as storage - its monthly newsheet,
Music Current, is an invaluable guide to contemporary music event in Scotland
and abroad.
The Scottish Arts Council, stipulating the development of the information side
of the business, came in as the main funder and, in 1992, trebled its grant to
the organisation to #61,500, which covers the rent of the building and the
salaries of the staff, now increased to three full-time and one part-time.
``The SAC grant is our oxygen,'' says McCue.
Additional finance to cover the running costs of the operation is provided by
facilities and services offered by SMIC, by trusts and foundations, and by
Glasgow city council.
Production of the Scottish Music Handbook - which has taken just over a year -
was met by rapid development of SMIC's in-house computerised database, with
special finance and extra staff. While the need for a handbook was first
pinpointed and suggested some years ago by Matthew Rooke, music director of the
SAC, the volume of inquiries received by SMIC - over 1600 last year - itself
dictated such a development.
Next priority for Kirsteen McCue is space. ``We have centuries of stuff here in
boxes, and we are absolutely squeezed for space. And we also need
environmentally controlled space; the manuscript collection includes autograph
material which needs to be stored in acid-free boxes, and in conditions which
are not too dry, not too damp.
``It's needed not just to make it accessible, but for future generations.
Before the eighteenth century, all this material was never gathered in one
place. Now it's vitally important to grasp the opportunity to preserve it.''

DAVID Sole has decided not to appeal against the six-month ban imposed by the
Scottish Rugby Union for bringing the game into disrepute, but Edinburgh
Academicals are still to contact the SRU to express their shock and
astonishment at the severity of the sentence, writes Derek Douglas.
The former Scotland captain was suspended until May 11 following a Murrayfield
disciplinary hearing which investigated the ``tantamount to cheating'' remarks
made by Sole about the performance of referee Colin Henderson after Edinburgh
Academicals' premiership defeat by Melrose.
Yesterday, Sole, who has been coaching the Academicals' forwards in addition to
overseeing the Raeburn Place under-21 side and assisting with the mini and
midi-sections, said: ``I consider the matter to be closed and I don't see any
point in appealing. I shall continue to go along to Raeburn Place but obviously
not in a coaching capacity.
``We have a good young side and in Paddy Haslett, Barry Stewart, and Scott
Murray we have three players who have the ability to go all the way. The whole
affair just saddens me but I'm not going to get bitter and twisted about it.
``So far as next season is concerned I don't know yet what I'm going to do.
There are a number of things happening on the personal front which might
influence my decision one way or the other,'' he said.
Academicals remain angry at the sentence imposed on their assistant coach - and
in particular the effect it will have on Sunday afternoon sessions with the
seven-year-olds - but will follow the lead given by Sole.
In a statement yesterday they declared: ``After intensive consultation David
has indicated that he does not consider it worth the powder and shot to appeal
against the ban.
``For our part we have decided therefore not to take any formal appeal action
but will be writing to the SRU expressing many concerns over the manner in
which the ban was arrived at and their shock and astonishment at the severity
of the sentence when compared with suspensions handed out for violent,
dangerous play.
``Accies would like to express their thanks to the many ordinary members of the
public and individuals from other clubs who have contacted them expressing
their surprise and deep anger at the length of the ban handed to a national
sporting hero.
``Particularly appreciated is that from many people connected with mini rugby
who have expressed their continued support and bewilderment that their children
will be denied the services of a coach whom they respect and admire.
``Although the severity of the sentence and the manner in which it has been
arrived at still rankles, perhaps the approaching new year indicates the time
has come to draw a line under this matter and for Accies to look forward to the
second half of the season and the challenges that await them next year,'' said
the statement.
Privately, many senior Academicals are still angry at the intervention of
international referee Ray Megson who said that he would not officiate at
Raeburn Place until the matter was resolved. His intervention came, as he
admitted later, at a time when he had not realised that Accies had not condoned
Sole's comments.
Megson is scheduled to referee Academicals' Boxing Day game with Edinburgh
Borderers. One Raeburn Place insider said yesterday: ``Perhaps Ray might
consider discretion to be the better part of valour on this occasion. It might
be best if frayed tempers were given time to heal.''
q ACADEMICALS hooker Kenny Day has been banned for 12 weeks after having been
sent off for stamping against Watsonians.

BRITISH basketball officials say it's no hoax - IBF super-middleweight champion
Roy Jones, Jr, is set to quit boxing and pursue a basketball career in England
with Budweiser League outfit London Towers.
League and club officials said yesterday that Jones plans to retire after his
title defence against Merqui Sosa on January 12 and move to England for a trial
with the Towers.
``It's extremely serious,'' said Basketball League spokesman Rob Webb. ``This
is real. We've been in regular contact with his agent.''
There was speculation that Jones' move could be related to his efforts to line
up a lucrative unification bout against Britain's WBC super-middleweight
champion Nigel Benn - but the London club believe instead that the boxer is
using them as a stepping stone towards a basketball career at a higher level.
Snooker
A PROPOSAL to pay board members of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker
Association failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority at the annual
meeting of the game's governing body in Bristol yesterday.
Ian Doyle, manager of world champion Stephen Hendry and carrying proxy votes
for nine other players, argued the WPBSA should concentrate on putting a more
extended executive structure in place - complete with chief executive - rather
than attempt to run board business on a day-to-day basis.
Squash
MARTIN Heath's success in the recent Scottish championship could mark the end
of his self-imposed exile from the Scottish team.
Disagreement arose at last season's European championships, and the 22-year-old
from Oban refused to play at the world event in Egypt last month, but the world
No.30 could return for the European championships in May.
``Hopefully the situation will soon be sorted out,'' he said. ``It would be
good to get back in the team because Scotland should be a match for anyone if
they are at full strength.''
With world No.8 Peter Nicol also missing from the world championship side,
Scotland finished just fifteenth.
Swimming
DUNFERMLINE High School pupil Bryan Morgan, who set two new British junior
records for backstroke at the weekend, will travel with the Scottish youth
squad to Denmark in January. Morgan, 15, of Dunfermline Carnegie ASC, knocked
0.38sec off the 50m backstroke record with a time of 27.32sec and beat the old
100m backstroke record of 58.11 with 57.94.
He will now compete in backstroke events at the multi-nation tournament in
Copenhagen next month.
Curling
THE Stakis Masters tournament was launched yesterday with an announcement of
its biggest prize fund yet and news of its highest ever level of participation
by foreign teams, including for the first time, an entry from Canada.
The Perth event, which will take place over the first weekend of January, is
now in its third year and already, with almost #8000 available for the top
teams, it is recognised as the premier event in Scotland.
The competition has been given extra spice by the British Curling Association's
decision that taking part is mandatory for any team with hopes of representing
Britain at the 1998 Winter Olympics.
Tennis
ALAN Mackin's challenge in the Orange Bowl world 14-and-under championships in
Florida ended in yesterday's second round. The 14-year-old from Paisley who won
through the qualifying competition to earn his place in the 128-player draw,
defeated Canadian John Rodger 6-4, 6-3 before bowing out 6-1, 6-2 to Marius
Gormans of Slovakia.
Michele Mair has returned from the Challenger circuit in Australia to contest
this week's British Women's Tennis Association Christmas tournament at Queen's
Club. The Scottish No.1 opened with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Suffolk junior Susan
Durham yesterday.
JEFF Tarango yesterday apologised to umpire Bruno Rebeuh, and to tennis in
general, for his infamous outburst at Wimbledon that led to a fine of almost
#30,000 and a ban from next year's tournament. The American stormed off court,
refusing to play on, in protest at the umpires' decisions during a singles
match against Alexander Mronz.
On appeal to the Grand Slam committee, Tarango's fine was reduced to #18,000,
which equals the prize money he would have otherwise received. He will still
not be allowed to play in next year's Wimbledon but the additional
one-tournament suspension was suspended for three years. The American's
six-month battle with the sport's establishment now seems to be over.
Boxing
SHINJI Takehara, of Japan, won the WBA middleweight title in Tokyo last night
when he outpointed defending champion Jorge Castro, of Argentina.
Sports awards
BRITISH intermediate heptathlon champion Jacky Tindal (Fife AC) is promoted
alongside British international Mel Neef in the latest list of awards from the
Scottish Sports Aid Foundation. The 17-year-old Buckhaven High School pupil
receives a #1000 Robertson Trust bursary, as does the 25-year-old City of
Glasgow star.
Walker Cup golfer Gordon Sherry (Kilmarnock) has also had a #1000 cash boost
from the Bank of Scotland's `Elite' Awards scheme, as has swimmer Graeme Smith
(Dunfermline). Awards:

American football
SAN Francisco 49ers blew a 21-point lead but rallied in time to defeat
Minnesota Vikings 37-30, setting themselves up to play all of their NFL
post-season matches at Candlestick Park. The 49ers must now win their final
game next weekend to secure the home-field advantage.
Receiver Jerry Rice caught 14 passes for a team-record 289 yards and three
touchdowns as the 49ers secured a first-round bye in the play-offs.
San Francisco's win also propelled the NFC Central Detroit Lions into the
play-offs, much to the relief of their head coach Wayne Fontes, who had been
threatened with the sack if his team had failed.

RUGBY
PHILIPPE Sella, who holds a world record of 111 caps in a top-level career
spanning more than 15 years, has announced his retirement from the
international scene.
The 33-year-old Frenchman earned his last cap on June 22 in Pretoria when
France defeated England in the World Cup third-place play-off. ``It's time for
me to concentrate on life outside rugby,'' said Sella, who runs a clothing
business. He scored 36 tries for France and was also one of the toughest
defenders in the team.
Sella enjoyed the best moments of his career in the 1987 World Cup where France
lost to New Zealand in the final after an fine win over Australia in the semis.
He has said that he intends to develop his company in England and might join an
English club next season, although he denied reports linking him with
Harlequins, Leicester, and Saracens.

THERE is definitely a whiff of rebellion in the air. You can smell it in
committee rooms up and down the land, club men with hundreds of years of unpaid
service behind them, railing and ranting at the organisation which is running,
or ruining as some would have it, the game they love. Frankly, at the moment,
in the nostrils of their own members, the SRU stinks.
It is not one issue, not just the argument about who should represent Scotland
in Europe next season, though that is an important cause celebre. Nor is it
just club officials who are upset.
The whole of the North and Midlands districts are up in arms having been forced
to play their championship match against the Scottish Exiles on Sunday, a quite
ludicrous decision given the weakness of the home side. My understanding is
that the majority of the SRU committee, the 18 men who make up the sport's most
powerful elite, were originally in favour of granting a postponement.
That did not suit some people so a telephone poll took place in which committee
members were urged to change their mind. This is no way to run a whelk stall,
never mind a multi-million pound organisation.
Nor are the top players resigned to continuing to reside and play in Scotland.
Money talks. If they are offered large sums to go South most of them will take
it. To predict that the Scotland team of two years hence will be made up
entirely of exiles is by no means fanciful.
It is therefore quite astonishing to hear leading SRU figures describe the
actions of such as Sir John Hall, the millionaire backer of Newcastle, as
``going on an ego trip''. They had better pray that there are Scottish
businessmen who are willing to sign up for the same cruise.
There has been much talk about the clubs calling an extraordinary general
meeting to challenge the decision that Districts - still to be formed or even
named - will be our European representatives. That may indeed happen.
But I am beginning to believe, from conversations that I have had with senior
club officials, that the special meeting may well be called to propose a vote
of no confidence in the committee itself.
``We are not just concerned about the European competition,'' a Stirling County
office-bearer told me on Saturday. ``There is a lot more we want to know.
``The growing number of staff at Murrayfield is another worry, the financial
position of the union - which appears to have deteriorated rapidly - is
something else we want to ask about, plus the whole question of league
reconstruction.
``This is a big club with big ideas and we are not content to be fed a diet of
scraps from the Murrayfield table.''
You could hear these comments echoed at Meggetland and Melrose.
A motion of no confidence is a rare but not unique occurrence in rugby. The
entire Welsh Rugby Union hierarchy was swept away just a few years ago.
I would not like to see that happen in Scotland because there are a lot of
decent, hard-working people on the SRU committee who have given sterling
service to the game. Dr Ian Todd, the current president, is one of life's
gentlemen. It is not his fault that the sport has been thrown into turmoil by
what seems increasingly, to me, a cowardly decision of the International Board
simply to declare the game open.
Charlie Ritchie is a grand chap to have at your side in a crisis and he will be
needed.
Because I believe the SRU must act to save itself and to stop the game from
descending into a civil war, the union should call an extraordinary general
meeting. They should not wait to be pushed into a corner.
The visionaries on the committee, the likes of Duncan Paterson and Allan Hosie
who have been arguing for a change in procedure for some years, should be used
to spell out how the union sees the future. Let Jim Telfer explain his thinking
face to face with club members.
What should clubs be doing about contracts? And could the director of rugby, or
anybody else, tell us how the Exiles are to be fitted into the new set-up.
Iain Laughland, the finance convener, should speak openly about the deficit and
about the remedies he intends to apply. Chief executive Bill Hogg might be
given his say, too; no-one has worked longer or harder in the union's interest.
Let's put all the cards on the table. The days of the old committee issuing
edicts on tablets of stone have gone; ``but the clubs are the SRU'' was always
the cry though hardly the reality. Now that might be an accurate assessment.
Kenny Milne, the retiring Heriot's and Scotland hooker, made a sensible
suggestion to me on Saturday. ``If it is to be Districts in Europe, then why
not pay the clubs for the release of every single player.
``That way, the more successful sides will at least receive some monetary
reward for their efforts.'' The union might do well to listen more to the wiser
players.
All is by no means black in Scottish rugby. We have just concluded one of the
most exciting first division championships. There are bigger crowds at club
matches than ever before; the public want to get behind the international side.
What is needed now is men of vision and courage to come forward and to speak
their mind. The alternative is just a mess.

WHO was the geezer last night roaring one of the Roses' more plangent
masterpieces of adolescent yearning, Waterfall, while wearing an orange acrylic
Jimmy-wig - so-called because the tam-o'-shanter which comes handily
pre-attached to it is intended to invoke Russ Abbot's archetypal drunken Scot,
Mr C U Jimmy? Who? Who?
A clue. Last night he sang in a costermonger's hectoring tones, having forsaken
the fey uncertainty of his original vocal style. Correct. It's Ian Brown, the
latest graduate from the Shaun Ryder Memorial School of Flat Mancunian
Atonality.
Granted, Ian only wore the Jimmy-wig briefly, someone in the stage-front throng
having gifted it to him. The wayward singing lasted throughout, although oddly
not during acoustic versions of Your Star Will Shine and Tightrope.
Why the change? Why does Ian Brown gaze out above the crowd's heads with a
simian look that's either sublimely sure or supremely indifferent? The Stone
Roses: we've waited for them since the summer of 1990, and were they as good
last night as they used to be? Were they any good at all? If they leave it for
another five-and-a-half years, will everyone have bogged off home? I honestly
don't know.
I do know that these days the Stone Roses are just a question of music, rather
than cultural definition and belief, so I can say wow, that John Squire! From
his guitar he extrudes deft metallic runs; aquaeous swathes; muscular chimes;
delicate shimmers, and funky, chunky bits.
``You soon got tired,'' Ian Brown observed as the crowd's dancing flagged at
one point. It began again, but as to why . . .

COMMUNICADO Theatre Company has provided the Tron - and thereafter Edinburgh's
Traverse - with a perfect Christmas show. Only it is not a Christmas show.
Sure, seasonal references have been inserted into this inspired piece of
story-telling, presented with the sort of easy theatricality that is Gerry
Mulgrew's company at its best. But basically it is the same show that premiered
at the Scottish International Children's Festival in Edinburgh in the early
summer.
It worked well then, and it works equally well now. The difference is in the
receptiveness - and size - of the audience. This is a show that is simply an
entertaining piece of theatre, but it seems that shows that work on such a
direct level are either for Christmas or for kids. Something wrong in the
equation there, perhaps.
Still, let's spot the panto elements. The occasional burst of music, chiefly
rendered by Jane MacFarlane (fiddle and cello), and Mulgrew himself. The puppet
sequences - one scene hypnotically rendered on a set the size of a dinner
plate, and a totally superfluous dance sequence (cf panto) with a mannequin
demonstrating Irish dancing, for example. Transformation scenes and quick
changes, they're all here.
What about the themes in these three Scots tales (from the collections of
Duncan Williamson)? Fairy tales as good as Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen.
Come to that, The Taen-Awa, which forms the whole of the second half, is a nice
pagan obverse of the Nativity.
The six-strong company - Donna Bainbridge, Peter Grimes, Conleth Hill, Anne
Lacey, MacFarlane, and Mulgrew - is excellent, conjuring up characters with
nothing and everything. They are a true ensemble - and no-one's making any fuss
about it.

THE National Trust for Scotland has been awarded a #116,000 grant by the
European Union as part of a #230,000 project to study grazing in the Scottish
Highlands.
Overgrazing by sheep and deer has long been blamed by conservationists for
causing widespread damage to the Scottish uplands.
The two-year study will be undertaken by the National Trust in collaboration
with the Scottish Wildlife Trust and Scottish Natural Heritage together with
the Insititute of Terrestrial Ecology in Banchory and the Macaulay Land
Research Institute in Aberdeen.
To work out what grazing level is needed to conserve the Scottish uplands the
project team will look at four sites in detail - Ben Lawers, Glencoe, Torridon
and the Lendalfoot Hills.

By IAN PAUL
CELTIC are on the verge of bringing another Dutch player to Parkhead to join
Pierre van Hooydonk, the striker who joined them last January for #1.2m. Van
Hooydonk is with Burns in his home town, Breda, where the pair are expected to
watch Roda's international defender, Johan de Kock, who has been the subject of
recent Parkhead scrutiny, in action this afternoon against the striker's former
side.
De Kock was the man who was called on to Anfield last week to replace Denis
Bergkamp when the Dutch manager, Guus Hiddink, decided that the national side
needed more aerial strength to cope with Tony Cascarino and John Aldridge in
the second half of their European Championship play-off with the Republic of
Ireland. Celtic had him watched that night.
Burns has been in Holland for a couple of days and, although other suggested
targets have been Denis de Nooyer of Sparta Rotterdam and Luc Nilis of PSV
Eindhoven, my understanding is that the man they are after is De Kock who,
although 31, has impressed Hiddink since he took over as national coach and is
now a certainty to be included in the squad for the European Championship
finals.
The fact that the Belgian, Nilis, is highly paid and very content with
Eindhoven, to where he can commute comfortably from home across the Border,
would seem to rule him out and, as Sparta Rotterdam, the club for whom de
Nooyer plays, have no game today, it is odds-on that Burns will be taking in
the match involving Hooydonk's former team.
For a man with five caps De Kock, astonishingly, is a part-timer who combines
his football with his day job as a civil engineer, but the word is that he
would be enthusiastic about a move to Celtic. In fact, the move had seemed a
possibility at the start of the season when van Hooydonk recommended the tall,
powerful defender. Nothing came of that early interest but there seems no doubt
that Roda would be willing to trade with Celtic, as their star turn's contract
runs out at the end of the season when, in the new Bosman era, he would be free
to move without any fee being involved.
Roda price him at 4m gilders which is about #1.6m, a fee Celtic would
accommodate if the player fits their requirements.
Although the club is relatively well off in his department, Burns has said
consistently that he is in the market for quality players when they are
available and is also committed to drumming up competition throughout the side.
The success of van Hooydonk, who is the leading scorer in the country, and the
all-round professionalism of Dutch players as a whole have impressed Burns and
chief scout David Hay, both of whom are fans of the Ajax youth system which the
management at Parkhead is trying to imitate in the long term.

MOST companies have reviewed the structure and operation of their boards
because of the Cadbury Code, according to a new survey, writes CHRIS STONE.
The CBI/Touche Ross study of corporate governance shows that 81% of companies
have taken action on the     issue.
The findings also show that 89% of companies want the Cadbury Code to remain
confined to principles, and 85% believe compliance with it has been
straightforward. A total of 71% believe their institutional shareholders are
concerned to ensure they comply with the code.
The survey was sent to the chairman or chief executive of 347 companies in the
last quarter and received a 45% response.
Among the other findings, 90% of respondents believe Cadbury has had no
positive effect on their financial performance; 61% feel compliance has not
added significantly to audit costs and the workload of senior executives, and
54% feel only larger listed companies should be required to comply with all of
it.
Some 67% think it should be modified for smaller listed companies and almost
75% said companies should simply be required to disclose the extent of their
compliance, although more than a quarter of firms believe compliance should be
required with each section of the code.
Commenting on the results, CBI president Sir Bryan Nicholson said: ``The CBI
was a sponsor of the original       Cadbury Committee and is a sponsor of the
newly-created successor body, to be chaired by Sir Ronald Hampel.
``High standards of corporate governance promote confidence in the investing
community and the public at large in the companies that practise them.
``A clear set of guiding principles for boards and directors, and disclosure of
how businesses are following them, are sensible ways of encouraging these
aims.''
However, the survey found though, 85% of respondents felt that the new
committee should not attempt any major change in the Cadbury Code until
companies have had more experience of the existing requirements.

SHARES of Coal Investments, which is the largest investor in Mining (Scotland),
operator of Longannet mine and nine open-cast sites, were suspended yesterday
pending clarification of its financial position, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Mining (Scotland), which employs some 900 people at Longannet, stressed the
news did not directly affect it.
David Brewer, its finance and operations director, said: ``We note this
situation with interest and are not happy to see one of our major shareholders
in any financial difficulty but it has no direct and immediate implications for
us.''
He pointed out Coal Investments was only one shareholder in the company. Others
include Waverley Resources and Murray Johnstone, as well as the workforce.
The company has the finance it requires fully in place, with spending in the
current year at Longannet between #15m and #20m to raise output to two million
tonnes a year, and it expects to make a profit in its first trading period for
the 15 months to next March.
Formed in 1993 to take over some British Coal pits, Coal Investments has
invested heavily in opening the Markham Main pit in South Yorkshire and
Silverdale colliery in Staffordshire among others. But they have taken longer
to bring into production than expected, extending the company's initial
loss-making period.
Its shares have fallen heavily this year on fears it will require refinancing.
Coal Investments said the immediate reason for the share suspension was the
refusal of planning permission for a coal face at Hem Heath colliery,
Stoke-on-Trent. It has been reviewing its financial position since the
beginning of December.
Its longer term future is under-pinned by lengthy supply contracts with the
power generation industry, notably a five-year contract with National Power to
supply 2,800,000 tonnes a year.

TEXTILE shares have been under-performing the market for some months, but the
general gloom was deepened yesterday by a miserable trading update from
Courtaulds Textiles, which was echoed by Coats Viyella.
The latter's shares managed to stay almost level at 169p but Courtaulds'
slumped 24p to 373p, and even mighty Marks &amp; Spencer slipped 8p to 431p on the
implications for its sales figures.
It is hardly surprising the industry is having a hard time given what it has
had to cope with. The weather was until recently all wrong, with an
exceptionally long hot summer followed by a mild and dry autumn. The result was
depressed demand for woollies and other outerwear. This was disappointing
because in the first seven months of the year, Courtaulds experienced good
trading. However, the second half is the more important.
Lack of demand hit margins which were already under pressure from higher raw
material prices, with cotton and wool, for example, showing big rises.
Household textiles have been a difficult area all year, partly because of the
poor housing market, with fewer people moving and replacing curtains, bed linen
and the like.
While clothing sales in the UK have returned to more normal levels in November
and December, in the US Courtaulds has been hit by destocking in the face of
weaker than expected demand. To cap it all, the strikes in France have affected
business there. The US and France account for more than a quarter of group
sales.
As a result, chief executive Noel Jervis warned that pre-exceptional pre-tax
profits would be down on 1994's #47.3m. This is in spite of a 16% advance in
operating profits on continuing operations in the first half. But the final
dividend will be held.
In Coats' case, demand and raw material problems have been partly offset by a
strong showing from the thread business, particularly in Europe and Brazil. But
it still sees 1995 profits as being below market expectations and also slightly
less than in 1994.
The trading statements could mark the nadir of the textile sector and further
share weakness could provide a buying opportunity.

SCOTTISH football needs to rationalise in order to survive. It is competitive
and, when the quality is high, a great attraction. So provided it can achieve
this and maintain it, it can be a success in Scotland. It is the national game
that every child wants to play well. It has no serious competition from other
spectator sports except an occasional golf or rugby event. And supporters care
passionately about their clubs.
The problem is that most parties want too much without giving a lot in return.
The media and the fans they influence want:
l A successful national team competing at the top level.
l Club success in Europe.
l The clubs to buy million-pound players.
l A massive youth coaching and training system producing star players and
costing millions of pounds.
l Entertaining football.
l Top quality stadia.
l Low admission prices.
The trouble is, with an economy and population the size of Scotland, we can't
have it all.
Meantime, players want six-figure contracts and nearly 40 supposedly
professional clubs who control the game. They want ``someone'' to keep them
alive. For several years that ``someone'' has mostly been the Celtic and
Rangers supporter, supplemented by some sponsor and television money shared
around.
On an average Saturday, the supporters of two of the 40 clubs pay out about
two-thirds of all the gate money. So the balance is definitely wrong. It is
clear that there are too many clubs, not enough customers - and just as clear
not enough quality players can be produced, or even attracted from elsewhere.
So how can we improve things? Not by making a so-called ``top'' division of 16
clubs. This just brings more mediocrity, and short-changes the customer. Yes,
the subsidy from Celtic and Rangers will increase, and be shared by more, but
weakening the two big clubs will not bring strength or quality.
Perhaps we can use our resources better. Here are some ideas.
To begin with, the Bosman decision, where the best players will move to the
most financially-successful clubs, means that we need a league that is
financially viable. It will have to be a small league. Eventually, we should
have no more than 10 fully professional clubs in a Major League, with
re-election of the weakest member required every two years - not relegation.
These clubs should enter partnerships with 10 Minor League clubs in other
towns, and 10 semi-professional youth ``farm'' clubs as well.
Just as important, the clubs who want to participate at the professional level
should be obliged to do what Aberdeen and Celtic have done, namely raise
capital and make their operations self-sufficient, not dependent.
Each club in the professional league should have internal capital of at least
#1.5m, invested by its owners, ideally to include its supporters or even its
local council. It should provide 15,000 covered seats or more, and be able to
sponsor a second-tier and youth network.
Some claim that the clubs play too many games. The answer is to extend the
season into summer, with a winter break - providing better conditions for
spectators, fewer injuries, and better pitches.
How can we finance the best training centres, football camps, youth coaching?
The Scottish Football Association has the money. Instead of developing Hampden
Park (already a less than ideal stadium with many seats at ground level 50
yards behind the goal line), using the clubs' and taxpayers' money, resources
should go to development of the quality of the game. Glasgow will soon have two
major stadia with a total of more than 100,000 quality seats. It needs a
national football stadium as much as it needs a national supermarket.
The recent talk of a 16-club ``top'' division, put forward by a group of
``takers'' does no service to the future of professional football in Scotland.
Aside from ignoring obligations to sponsors and television contracts, it
ignores the paying customer in favour of survival and self-interest.
 Fergus McCann, 1995.

EUROPEAN football's so-called three-plus-two rule which restricts the number of
foreign players in a side is outlawed with immediate and direct effect, the
European Commission insisted yesterday.
But the European Union of Football Associations (UEFA) immediately countered
saying that they held a different interpretation of the law and would be doing
nothing to change it.
Meanwhile, European soccer and other team sports have been left in confusion
about the rules.
Social Affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn told a committee of Euro-MPs in
Brussels that he was surprised at the reaction of UEFA to the EU's Court of
Justice ruling against the restriction of foreign players.
The court ruled last week in favour of Belgian soccer professional Jean-Marc
Bosman in a case which appeared to scrap the rule limiting the number of
foreign players which a side can field in a European game.
It did so because it said the present system conflicted with the free movement
of labour in Europe.
The ruling also seeks to end the transfer system in professional team sports on
which many small soccer clubs depend for survival.
UEFA had said on their first reaction to the court's decision that in their
view the three-plus-two rule might remain valid for European level competition.
``This interpretation seems to me to be clearly contrary to the court's
ruling,'' Flynn said.
He told Euro-MPs: ``The court's ruling was clear. The restrictions on the
number of EU players that clubs can play - the so-called three-plus-two rule -
are outlawed.''
Later, he issued a formal statement quoting from the court's ruling in which it
was made clear that ``Article 48 of the EEC treaty precludes the application of
rules laid down by sporting associations under which, in matches in
competitions which they organise, football clubs may field only a limited
number of professional players who are nationals of other member states.''
The court also said that nationality restrictions could be accepted only for
matches between national teams on grounds which are of sporting interest.
Flynn said: ``It is clear to me that from now on nationality restrictions are
illegal in European-level club competitions. I expect those affected to take
the necessary steps to change their rules to comply with the court's ruling. In
any event, all those affected should be aware that this ruling has immediate
and direct effect.''
But Alasdair Bell, the Scottish lawyer who           represents UEFA in
Brussels, said the ruling was not as clear as Flynn was making out and that its
wording required clarification.
``For the moment there is no next step,'' he said, ``there is just
disagreement. We have read this judgment one way and the commission has read it
another way. We are not going to do anything.''
Bell thought it likely that a challenge would be made again in the courts so
that clarification could be sought.

East Stirlingshire 5,
Albion Rovers 1
THE home side improved their league fortunes with this win at Firs Park last
night. 'Shire struck after eight minutes when a pass from Hunter released
Lamont, who slotted the ball home.
Three minutes before the interval, Rovers' Gallacher put the ball past his own
keeper, and the match was finished as a contest just seven minutes into the
second half when Hunter supplied Dwyer with a chance which he finished from 10
yards.
Four minutes later Lee's cross was headed home by Dwyer, and then the striker
completed his hat trick with a fine shot from the edge of the six-yard box.
With six minutes remaining Rovers claimed a consolation goal through Willock.

<HEADLINE>Hammer of Scots looks forward - and back FOOTBALL LEGEND JOHNNY HAYNES HOPES THAT THE WEMBLEY ENCOUNTER WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JOHNNY Haynes last night drooled over the prospect of Scotland meeting England
again next summer, just as the ``Hammer of the Scots'' relished the fixture
more than 30 years ago.
There was a disturbing confidence in his belief that the Wembley match in June
will go the same way as many of the home internationals he starred in, during
the late 50s and early 60s.
The man remembered by most Scots fans as the individual wholly responsible for
our blackest day, the 9-3 Wembley defeat in 1961, is now settled in business in
Edinburgh. The fact that, on that black day, he scored twice and laid on most
of the others lends some credence to the legend that has built up around him
since.
A mild-mannered Londoner, Haynes has made the most difficult of transitions,
from a man feared by a whole nation of football followers to one of its most
popular incomers. That makes the realisation that the former Fulham inside left
was one of the few world-class players produced by the United Kingdom just a
bit more palatable to take.
When he relaxes this afternoon in Harry's Bar in the West End of the capital,
enjoying Christmas lunch with a host of recently found Scottish friends, he has
still not decided whether to join the trek to Wembley next summer.
``I may sit tight and watch the game on television, although as the day draws
closer the appeal of the occasion will no doubt grow,'' Haynes reflected.
``It's amazing that it took a quirk of the draw on Sunday to resurrect a
fixture that the professionals wanted to play but the authorities were much
less keen about.
``The fact that it will be in a competitive tournament will surely add that
touch of spice and hopefully we will see the match become a regular in the
calendar again.
``In my time it was the highlight of the football season, whether it be at
Wembley or in front of that huge, noisy crowd at Hampden Park.
``Everyone made great stress of the will there was within the whole Scottish
nation to win but there was a deep determination among other players to come
out on top as well.
``They were superb matches, played with great players, although I seem to
remember that your goalkeepers weren't all that great - and you'll get no names
from me!''
It was almost certainly in the series against the Auld Enemy that the jibes
from the south at Scottish keepers were born, and much of the damage was
inflicted by schemer Haynes.
Aberdeen's Freddie Martin lost seven goals in 1955, Frank Haffey's career all
but ended with a concession of nine in '61, and Stewart Kennedy never recovered
from a 5-1 mauling in 1975.
``I still get stick from my pals up here about the old games, but you Scots
have this great talent for only remembering the good days,'' added Britain's
first #100-a-week player.
``There were so many good players around when I played, like Jimmy Greaves and
Jimmy Baxter, and it made the quality of the matches virtually assured.
``But there will be good players at Wembley next summer, when the fact that
it's a European Championship tie will give the game an exciting edge.
``I remember playing for England schoolboys in 1950, when the full team beat
Scotland 1-0 at Hampden in what was used as a qualifying tie for the World Cup
finals - sorry to bring up yet another victory. So it is some time since the
fixture has had such a meaningful tag.
``There are so few football matches nowadays that really grabs the imagination
of the public, that it's a shame that this, one of the greatest games, should
have been lost for six years.''
Whether at Wembley in the flesh, or from his Fountainbridge home, Haynes will
relive the past on June 15. Sadly, none of us will ever supersede his memory of
the match, from that hellish April day 34 years ago.

DEAR, oh dear. National Westminster Bank has sold its NatWest Bancorp for a
total of $3260m (#2100m) compared with the $4000m rumoured in September when
chairman Lord Alexander said it was up for sale.
That caused a certain amount of bemusement in banking parlours. Nothing seems
more calculated to damage morale among staff, who in the US are much more
mobile than their UK counterparts and would want to take pre-emptive action
before the cost-cutting programme that normally means 20% redundancies imposed
by the new owner.
At the time several names were in the frame but not that of yesterday's buyer.
That is Boston-based Fleet Financial Corporation, which is actually getting
Bancorp slightly more cheaply than the headline figure.
It is paying the equivalent of #1700m in cash, but Fleet can reduce that by
offering #310m of its own stock. Also there is a final consideration of about
#370m spread over a maximum of eight years. So NatWest will not have quite so
many of the readies as first appears.
It has been clear for several weeks it would not get its hoped for price even
if other US banks have been changing hands at well over twice book value.
Something around two-and-a-half times would have been reassuring but this looks
like being about one-and-a-half.
NatWest shares jumped 19!sp to 649p on relief that the deal had finally been
completed and that it may buy back 100 million shares, which would lap up #650m
and increase earnings per share.
It is now talking about making acquisitions in fund management and life
assurance, but that seems somewhat late in the day.
Cruel it may be, but all the other UK High Street banks have clear strategies.
That of NatWest remains a mystery.

SHORT-TERM British interest rates will remain unchanged as the economy grows
modestly above trend over the next two years, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) said yesterday.
In its latest economic outlook, written before the Budget, the Paris-based
think-tank forecast the British economy would grow on average by 2.5% in 1996
and 1997, slightly down on its estimate for 1995 of 2.7%. These forecasts fall
short of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's estimates of 2.75% growth this year and 3%
growth next.
``No further rise in interest rates is assumed over the next two years,'' the
OECD report said, as the impact of fiscal restraint becomes progressively less
important in 1996.
Slazenger sold
INDUSTRIAL conglomerate BTR has decided to sell one of the world's best-known
sports businesses for more than #300m. Dunlop Slazenger, with an annual
turnover of #275m, is being bought by venture capital group Cinven. BTR said it
aimed to complete the sale by early next year.
Trust disappoints
MURRAY Smaller Markets Trust significantly under-performed the World and
All-Share indices during the six months to end-November. The Murray
Johnstone-managed trust, which is invested in smaller markets around the globe,
achieved a total return on net assets of only 4.3%. During the six months, the
respective total returns on the World and All-Share indices were 11.4% and
11.7%. The #284m fund's interim dividend was raised by 2.6% to 1.60p.
Hess go-ahead
AMERADA Hess has been given Government consent to develop the Telford field in
the North Sea. The field has estimated reserves of 48 million barrels of oil
and 74 billion cubic feet of gas. Three production wells and three water
injection wells will be drilled next year and the first oil is expected in
1997. Crude output from the Telford field 100 miles north-east of Aberdeen is
expected to reach 30,000 barrels a day.

THE gap between Rangers and Celtic at the top of the premier division stands at
two points. The pursuit of the championship grows ever more intriguing.
Rangers went into Lanarkshire last night hoping to take from Fir Park three
points to keep Celtic at arm's length, but the Ibrox side can feel the breath
of their traditional rivals hot on the back of their neck. Motherwell proved
much more resilient than most of the 10,197 audience could have imagined,
especially when they lost another yet another key player before the kick-off.
Dougie Arnott had to be sent home on Monday morning because he was feeling the
effects of flu. Andy Roddie started the match, but it was really only in the
second half that he became any kind of menace.
The same was true of Alex Burns, but once these two started to use their main
attributes, their pace, they troubled Rangers' defence and the game became
vibrant and exciting. Chances were created and both keepers had to rely on the
structure of their goals to prevent goals. It should also be said that Andy
Goram and Scott Howie played well.
Rangers' manager Walter Smith, who always seems to look calm while others
around him are succumbing to their anxieties, felt from the kick-off the match
wore the look of a no-scoring draw. When he watched Gordon Durie's header hit
the crossbar and then Howie turn a net-bound shot by Durie over the top, his
instincts were confirmed.
However, he wasn't too disappointed with his team's performance given the
unavailabilities with which he still must contend - Ally McCoist and Stuart
McCall were added to the casualty list while Oleg Salenko and Paul Gascoigne
were the most notable absentees because of suspensions - although he pointed
out: ``I think it shows that we are not able to play as a unit because of those
who are missing.''
Motherwell also have serious injury concerns - they have been without key
players like Chris McCart and Tommy Coyne, in particular - but they have
persevered with their passing game and there were times last night when they
looked slick and dangerous.
Nevertheless, at this stage last season they were 18 goals better off, and when
Goram made a marvellous save from Paul Lambert early in the first half,
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish must have felt that the break in front of goal
was not going to come along, and similarly when a Burns shot, which was
deflected by Alan McLaren, hit the base of a post in the second half.
Still, McLeish had reason to feel positive. Brian Martin returned after injury
and played remarkably well in defence, although he also was able to push
forward in support of those ahead of him. But he hobbled off 12 minutes from
the end suffering from a hamstring strain.
Billy Davies also failed to finish the game because of injury and his place was
taken by Jamie Dolan with fewer than 10 minutes left. Dolan is regarded as one
of the most influential players in Motherwell's side, but he was dropped last
night perhaps as a reminder that more is expected of him.
The same could apply to Alexei Mikhailichenko, who started the game, but he
under-produced. It is must be one of the great regrets of recent times in the
premier division that he should still be unable to be consistently influential
because he does possess such sublime skills.
Motherwell's performance, as McLeish said, made a mockery of their position at
the bottom of the division, although the point taken last night meant they
moved into second-bottom place on goal difference. ``Time for a cartwheel,''
said McLeish, who refuses to become too downhearted.
``I'd be more upset if were not creating chances, but I think you can see where
our problem lies. However, I tell the players that a couple of results could
lift them clear because it is very tight in this division.''
McLeish was especially pleased with the contribution of Greig Denham, who was
making only his sixth appearance in the first team this season. The 19-year-old
showed a cool touch at the back and made some timely interventions.
``Yes, he does have the credentials,'' said McLeish. ``He looked as though he
had been at the heart of the defence all his life. He has the kind of mentality
which is essential at this level.'' The manager added that he continues to seek
a player to help ease Motherwell's problems, but pointed out: ``It isn't that
I've been inactive. It's just that I want to be sure the next player is the
right one.''
Teams
MOTHERWELL - Howie, May, McKinnon, Krivokapic, Martin, Denham, Lambert,
McSkimming, Burns, Roddie, Davies. Substitutes - Dolan, Essandoh, Ritchie.
RANGERS - Goram, McLaren, Gough, Petric, Robertson, Mikhailichenko, Ferguson,
Miller, McInnes, Durie, Laudrup. Substitutes - Durrant, Murray, McGinty.

PREMIER division newcomers Raith Rovers yesterday were given permission to
kick-off a #2.3m redevelopment of their Stark's Park ground at Kirkcaldy.
Following approval by Kirkcaldy district's development committee, the ground
will be transformed into an all-seater stadium, increasing capacity by around
1000, taking the total to 10,400.
Two new stands, each seating 3400 fans, will be built at each end of the
ground, while the existing railway stand will be extended to hold an additional
590.
Access to the ground will be provided underneath the stands, which will remove
congestion currently blighting Pratt Street on match days.
New floodlighting, snack facilities and entry for disabled supporters are
planned, while the pitch itself will be moved 2.5 metres south and have its
famous slope removed.
Work on the ambitious scheme is scheduled to start after the game against
Rangers on March 30 and be completed in time for the start of the 1996/97
season - the deadline laid down in the Taylor Report.
q DUNDEE manager Jim Duffy last night fined himself after having been booked in
a reserve match at Dens Park.
The player-manager was yellow carded for complaining about a penalty decision
which went against his team in Monday's clash with Livingston.
Duffy spoke up after a tackle by recent signing Barry Smith was penalised by
the match referee, even though a linesman signalled a corner when the ball went
out of play.
The Dens Park manager said: ``I felt it was a good tackle from Barry, but I am
fining myself for being booked, because I know by this stage in my career that
nothing I can say is going to make a referee change his mind over a decision.''
Duffy was able to recall that this is only the second time in his long playing
career that he has picked up a yellow card for dissent.
q.SOUTHAMPTON'S Paul McDonald last night asked Scottish managers to kickstart
his career. The 27-year-old former Hamilton winger has been on the transfer
list since Dave Merrington took over at The Dell in the summer.
A move to Burnley has already fallen through and #50,000-rated McDonald said:
``It has been bitterly disappointing since Merrington took over, and I would
jump at a move back to Scotland.
q.HIGHLAND League Clach have signed former Caley Thistle player Mike Andrew,
who was one of five given free transfers by Fort William to save money.
The 36-year-old will make his debut against his former club on Saturday.

AS THE English FA yesterday confirmed that each of Scotland's ties in the
European Championships already has been officially declared a sell-out, the
controversy over the allocation for the England-Scotland meeting on June 15 is
showed no sign of easing.
The argument has now been taken up by Scottish Labour's spokesman on sport,
John McAllion MP, who has called for a rethink on the allocation, suggesting
that there could be ``serious trouble'' as a result of the way the tickets are
to be distributed.
His intervention comes at the same time as the FA indicated that it might be
able to provide at best an extra 2000 tickets on top of the regulation 7000 set
aside for visiting fans.
McAllion has written to the English and Scottish Sport Ministers, Iain Sproat
and Raymond Robertson, urging them to raise the matter with the football
authorities. ``I find it unacceptable that Scottish fans will receive only 7000
out of a total of 76,000 tickets for this match.'' he said. ``There will be
enormous interest in the game, with up to 30,000 Scots wanting to travel to
Wembley to see it. Unless there is a rethink there could be a number of
flashpoints which could lead to serious trouble.'' He has made these points to
the ministers:
l.Since ticket touts are already boasting of exploiting the fans from Scotland
by charging up to #1000 a ticket, this could lead to serious trouble outside
the stadium;
l.Since touts will sell tickets to anyone prepared to pay their price, for any
part of the ground, there is a real danger of Scottish and English fans mixing
in the same part of the ground, with potentially explosive implications for
order at the game.
l.Police strategies for keeping rival fans separated, which is common practice
these days, will be rendered null and void.
``For all those reasons, it would be disastrous for the tournament organisers
to treat this game as just another tie. It is not. It is a special tie which
will be played in exceptional circumstances and should be treated accordingly
by the authorities.''
The avalanche of ticket applications has meant that the FA has closed the book
on the Wembley match and the games with Holland and Switzerland at Villa Park,
Birmingham.
Meanwhile in Glasgow, the SFA Travel Club organiser, Marjory Nimmo, continues
to be inundated with requests to join the only official organisation which can
supply tickets in Scotland.
q.MARTIN O'Neill yesterday confirmed his decision to resign as manager of first
division Norwich. O'Neill quit the Carrow Road club on Sunday but had been
understood to be having second thoughts.
q.HAMILTON are offering specially discounted tickets for the second half of the
season costing #50 for adults and #28 for senior citizens and juveniles. They
are for all the home games until May.

FIRST Choice Holidays reckons it has done all it can to raise profits next year
and now it is all down to the fickle customer.
January is the vital month, when a quarter of all summer holidays are booked.
Only when February arrives will the industry know what the 1996 season holds.
First Choice has lopped off 1,500,000 holidays from capacity, to 1993 levels of
8,500,000. This will mean much better margins compared with discount-hit 1995,
if demand does not fall further. However early bookings are down by a quarter.
It has raised brochure prices by 9%, in line with competitors. Bookings have
been for higher margin packages so yield is up 17%.
It believes a #17m increase in advertising this year has lifted early bookings
2% to 12.9%. It is also well ahead in the 1995-96 winter season.
The group's airline, Air 2000, has reduced its summer capacity by 4% to
2,800,000 seats.
The usual first-half trading loss is coming down, last year running at #24m,
and chief executive Francis Baron is aiming to eliminate it over a number of
years.
The purchase of the minority holding in the Canadian operation will help. It
contributed 80% more profits at #7.9m in the year to October.
Through 126 redundancies and a requirement for 200 fewer summer staff, some #3m
a year has been removed from costs. Travel agents' commission has been cut to
about 10%.
First Choice confirmed its earlier indication of profits of #1.3m against
#16.3m for 1994-95 and maintained dividends of 3.85p. Net cash stands at #101m.
The shares were unchanged at 64p.

Starring role for Astra
ALTHOUGH the number of variants which made it Vauxhall's biggest model range
has been trimmed, there are still more than 40 catalogued types of Astra. The
body styles alone include three-door and five-door hatchbacks, a four-door
saloon, a convertible and a five-door estate.
The Astra offers a bewildering choice of engines. It is not just a matter of
1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and two-litre petrol engines, plus a diesel and a turbo diesel.
You would have to be a University Challenge contender to remember all the
sub-divisions like 1.4 Hi-Torq and 1.6 E-drive. The point is that there are
engines for all purposes, from the ultra frugal to the sporty 16-valve.
All the Astras have been improved by the styling changes introduced earlier
this year. I think that, of the whole considerable Vauxhall range, the Astra is
the car which best suits the ``family'' V-grille front-end. And the estate
version is one of the most attractive looking load carriers in its class, far
more neatly styled overall than the car which is its most obvious rival.
During 1995 the CDX was introduced as the top-line Astra estate. It comes as a
1.7-litre turbo diesel at #15,065, or with a choice of petrol engines, the
1.6-litre at #15,345 or the two-litre at #16,645, which puts it into the upper
part of the Vectra price range. The two-litre CDX estate has a very full
specification. Electronically monitored anti-lock braking is standard, and so
are twin airbags, air conditioning, alloy wheels, a CD player and an alarm
system which includes a sensor to set it off if a window is broken.
An Ecotec 16-valve engine with a 136bhp output gives the two-litre CDX good
reserves of power without too great a thirst. I drove the test car on a scamper
to Spain and Portugal. On motorways and dual carriageways it cruised very
easily at just under 3000rpm, relaxed but not especially quiet.
Less interested, during that mile-eating run, in acceleration than in fuel
economy, I noted that the Astra managed about 43mpg on its best cruising
tankful, compared with 37mpg on stretches which involved the inevitable dash
for a ferry.
Vauxhall has given it gas-filled shock absorbers and altered front suspension
settings, but it still seems more like a long-distance cruiser than a car for
scampering round the lanes. And this is another Vauxhall in which you are
better treating the gearbox smoothly, timing the changes properly, than just
shoving the lever unthinkingly about.
There are not many two-litre Astras around. The extra engine capacity, and the
extra power which comes with it, make the two-litre CDX an easier long-distance
cruiser and generally much brisker.
You can feel the Opel design influence in the front seats, which are harder
than some UK owners prefer. Certainly, I began to shuffle in mine much earlier
than I do in a base-model Astra Merit.
As a working estate, though, the CDX scores well. The concertina-type security
blind covers a large and well-shaped load area. It swallowed cases, bags and
boxes in some profusion, and kept them all well out of sight.
Two-up and with a well-laden rear compartment, the Astra maintained its ride
quality, and when required it would tackle winding roads with verve. One it
romped up happened to be a European speed hill climb championship course.
But, despite the extra performance compared with other models, this is a
practical rather than a semi-sporting estate. Vauxhall's preference for secure
understeer is obvious, and that makes sense, because a car which may be called
upon to carry considerable loads needs to handle safely at any weight up to its
recommended maximum.

THE six ``wise men'' who advise the Chancellor should in future be referred to
as the six wise persons following Mr Clarke's decision, announced yesterday, to
include two leading women economists in the panel of independent economic
advisers.
It is a move which will be much appreciated by those who feel, rightly, that
women are still grossly under-represented in many fields. There may be nothing
like the same number of women economists as men, but to treat the panel as a
solely male preserve would be an anachronism in this day and age.
Whether it actually plays any significant role in Treasury planning is beside
the point, though the views and opinions of outside commentators and
forecasters were always studied even before the panel (then with seven members)
was established by Norman Lamont in January 1993 to help restore credibility
after our ignominous exit from the ERM.
New member Kate Barker is the chief economic adviser at the Confederation of
British Industry, while Bridget Rosewell is a co-founder of Business
Strategies, an economics and business consultancy which also undertakes
research with the CBI, specialising on the regions.
Their respective jobs give them an ear to the ground on British industry and
should make them particularly hard headed and realistic when putting forward
their views. Some economists tend to live in ivory towers, though these days it
is common practice at the Treasury itself to second them to companies so they
can get a better feel of the subject, a form of work experience almost.

<RECORDNO>974799072</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A JURY found the case against an AA patrolman charged with causing the death of
a young Ayrshire woman by driving his van dangerously not proven yesterday.
Ms Alison Dunn, 20, of Arran Place, Ardrossan, died after the car in which she
was a passenger was involved in a head-on collision with Mr Bernard Coyle's van
on the A737 Johnstone by-pass.
Mr Coyle, 58, of Campsie Road, Slaemuir, Port Glasgow, who was an AA patrolman
at the time, denied causing her death by dangerous driving.
The jury at Paisley Sheriff Court returned a not proven verdict by majority.
As he left the court, Mr Coyle said he was ``greatly relieved'' his ordeal was
over.
Ms Dunn's father Ronald, of Springvale Street, Saltcoats, said he had to accept
the jury's decision and added: ``Whatever the result, it wouldn't have brought
our daughter back.''
During the trial, the court heard claims from lorry driver John McLelland, 29,
of Kirknowe Cottages, Howwood, Renfrewshire, that he had been driving his
articulated lorry east on the by-pass when Mr Coyle's van suddenly appeared
directly behind him.
He said he saw the van appear close to the rear of his trailer in his offside
wing mirror and it ``caused him some alarm''.
He said the van had pulled out as if to overtake his 40ft truck and there was
an almost instantaneous impact with the car, driven by Mr Andrew Allan, 24, of
Ardrossan Road, West Kilbride.
In a statement to police, he said he thought the van driver must have suffered
a heart attack or stroke, causing him to lose control of the vehicle.
However, Mr Coyle denied that he had driven on the wrong side of the road in
the seconds leading up to the collision and said he had no recollection of
driving behind Mr McLelland's heavy goods lorry or that he had tried to
overtake any traffic.
He claimed he had seen Mr Allan's car coming towards him on the wrong side of
the road and had tried to take evasive action by swerving to the right on to
the other carriageway, but could not avoid a collision.

ANOTHER man was shot dead last night in Belfast in what appears to be a purge
against suspected drug dealers.
Chris Johnston, 38, who was gunned down at a street corner in the Lower Ormeau
Road area, was the second murder victim in 24 hours and the fifth since the
campaign started last April.
Earlier Francis Collins, 4O, a father of five, was shot dead in front of his
wife at their chip shop in the republican New Lodge Road area. Although no
organisation claimed responsibility for that attack, police blamed the IRA.
Mr Johnston had been on bail on drugs charges and was returning to his home in
Cooke Street when he was ambushed. Gunmen had taken over a nearby house and
opened fired as he got out of his car.
Three men have been shot dead within a fortnight. All were alleged drugs
dealers.
As Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew prepares to meet Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring in Dublin today, these killings are bound to leave the two
Governments uneasy on future prospects for the peace process.

CARBERRY Tower, the Christian residential conference centre near Musselburgh,
is to continue in that capacity although it is being sold by the Church of
Scotland.
The Kirk has sold the house and estate to the Friends of Carberry for #747,000.
Negotiations have been in progress with the friends' organisation since the
General Assembly of the Kirk agreed last May that its board of parish education
should sell Carberry at full commercial value.
Carberry Tower dates back to 1480 and stands in 35 acres of parkland. It was
gifted to the Church of Scotland in 1961 by the Elphinstone family.

IT COULD be the end of the road for three England quick bowlers, at least for
the time being, with the news that Angus Fraser has been left out of the side
for England's final practice match before the fourth Test, which starts in Port
Elizabeth on Boxing Day.
Fraser joins Devon Malcolm and Darren Gough, two other fast bowlers who were
expected to play a big part in South Africa, on the sidelines. All three were
omitted from the drawn third Test; and they now can expect the same fate when
battle resumes on Boxing Day.
Batsman Jason Gallian steps into the side to play South Africa's equivalent of
Combined Universities in Pietermaritzburg today, less than 24 hours after
having arrived from Pakistan, while Dominic Cork has been rested, making way
for Mike Watkinson.
The pace bowling spots are again occupied by Peter Martin and Mark Ilott, with
manager Ray Illingworth stating: ``We will probably pick our Test team from
these 11 players, plus Cork. We won't make any final decision until we've seen
the Port Elizabeth wicket. But Peter and Mark did well enough in Durban.''
Gough is injured, while Malcolm's speed is an advantage  only when pitches are
quicker than those England are likely to find during the rest of this Test tour.
Fraser is reliable on any surface. However, it appears the 30-year-old
Middlesex seamer is being left behind by younger players.
Gallian seems certain to face South Africa on Tuesday having flown in from A
tour duty to replace the injured John Crawley. ``I feel a bit wobbly, but I'm
looking forward to playing,'' said Gallian.
q JOHN Emburey is set to step into the breach for England today when the
43-year-old spinner will be named as twelfth man when England A face Pakistan A
in the third and final one-day clash at Sheikhupura Stadium.
His inclusion will complete a busy tour for Emburey who, as team manager, has
conducted the usual duties of organising and monitoring the players, and has
even been seen motivating lethagic Pakistani groundsmen and acting as an
emergency scorer in the second one-day contest.
AUSTRALIA yesterday beat West Indies in the World Series, limited-overs
competition. The Aussies won the match by 24 runs despite an improved
performance by the tourists in cold and blustery conditions at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground.
In reply to Australia's 249 for six from their 50 overs, West Indies subsided
to 225 all out in 49.1 overs and are still searching for their first win in the
triangular competition which also features Sri Lanka.

THE current chairman of the Edinburgh Sick Children's NHS Trust, Mr Graeme
Millar, has been named as the new chairman of the Southern Scotland Electricity
Consumers' Committee (SSECC), which covers the ScottishPower area.
He will take over next month from Professor Tom Carberry, who has held the post
for six years.
Yesterday, Mr Millar pledged to use his appointment to persuade ScottishPower
and all the other suppliers ``to address consumers' needs that would normally
come from a privatised competitive market''.
He said he saw the SSECC as sitting midway between the regulator Offer and
ScottishPower and other suppliers, acting as a source of information and advice
to both sectors.
Mr Carberry, who is retiring, said he had seen a marked improvement in consumer
services offered by ScottishPower since 1990/91.
He added that consumers would continue to benefit between now and 1998.
However, the SSECC was concerned that consumers had not benefited ``anything
like the same extent as the shareholders and the senior executives of the
companies''.

LORD Brocket yesterday pleaded guilty to his part in a #4.5m classic car fraud.
The 43-year-old friend of the Prince of Wales, looking strained and worried,
announced his plea from the dock at Luton Crown Court.
He was told by Judge Daniel Rodwell QC that he could expect to go to prison
when the case was dealt with early next year.
The judge said he was ordering pre-sentence reports and warned the stately home
owner: ``I want to make it clear that by ordering a pre-sentence report it
doesn't mean you are going to receive anything other than a custodial
sentence.''
The length of the prison sentence could well be determined by what was said in
the reports, the judge said.
``I don't want you to be under any misapprehension whatsoever. Do you
understand?''
Brocket replied: ``Yes, your honour.''
The polo-playing aristocrat was charged under his name Charles Ronald Nall-Cain.
In the dock with him was 40-year-old mechanic Stephen Gwyther, of Cromer Hyde
Lane, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, American classic-car salesman Richard
Furtado, 41, of Bluebells, Welwyn Garden City, and financial consultant Michael
Campbell-Bowling, 59, of Cambria Street, Fulham, west London.
All four men were charged with conspiracy to defraud, alleging that between May
17 1989 and September 1 last year, they conspired together and with a fifth
man, Mr Mark Caswell, to defraud such persons as could be induced to part with
money.
Brocket and Gwyther pleaded guilty to the charge but Furtado and
Campbell-Bowling denied the offence.
Mr Peter Stage, for the prosecution, asked Judge Rodwell for 14 days so that a
decision could be reached on whether it was in the public interest to proceed
with a trial against Furtado and Campbell-Bowling.
Desmond De Silva QC, for Brocket, asked the judge to renew his client's bail,
saying he wanted to sort out ``matters of deep family concern so that he might
be allowed to attend to his affairs''.
Judge Rodwell adjourned the case for 28 days and all four men were granted bail.
The case arose from a burglary which Brocket claimed had happened in May 1991.
He said four valuable classic cars had been stolen from a showroom in a
converted stable block on the Brocket Hall Estate at Lemsford, Hertfordshire.
The cars, said to be worth millions, were a 1952 Ferrari 340 America, a 1955
Ferrari Europe, a Ferrari 195 Sport, and a 1960 Maserati Tipo Bird Cage.
At the time, Brocket claimed the thieves had carried out a ``professional job''
by removing the alarm system.
In fact, no burglary had taken place.
In February this year, the lord, along with four other men, was arrested and
accused of attempting to deceive insurance companies - the charge which he
admitted yesterday.
Mr Steven Barker, Lord Brocket's solicitor, said: ``He has pleaded guilty and
that is as a result of a decision he made some considerable time ago and he has
had to live with that decision for some time.''
The solicitor said there were matrimonial proceedings pending which would be
heard in the High Court next month. Mr Barker added: ``He fully accepts the
consequences of his action. He is prepared to go to prison but he is far more
concerned with the welfare of his children.''
The solicitor added that the hearing in the High Court would involve ``family
and residential orders being made''.
He asked the press and media to exercise care and caution in reporting personal
matters concerning Lord Brocket.

THE centre of Lord Brocket's world is the 25-bedroom Georgian stately home set
in 1400 acres that provides his income and houses his fabulous #20m car
collection.
The 3rd Baron Brocket inherited Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, once the home of
Lady Caroline Lamb, in 1965 at age 13.
In 1981, he opened it as a premier international conference centre.
Lord Brocket's widely-publicised marriage to American heiress Isabell Lorenzo,
34, ended in divorce in September.

THE #100 fine imposed on Colin Montgomerie for audibly swearing during the
Johnnie Walker world championship in Jamaica last week proved to be no
impediment to his being selected for the same sponsor's award as the European
Player of the Year. Towards the end of a frustrating season, during which he
had been second three times and in the first 10 on six other occasions,
Montgomerie in late August and early September ended a 12-month victory drought
by winning the German Open and Lancome Trophy.
That breakthrough occurred shortly after his sudden-death play-off loss to
Australia's Steve Elkington in the US PGA championship, one of the world's four
majors which have so far eluded him. Of that ambition Montgomerie said:
``Realistically, I suppose, I've got 32 more attempts, four a year until I'm 40
- after which I'm unlikely to get better.''
Montgomerie then made his contribution to Europe's unexpected Ryder Cup triumph
over the USA with two points out of five, one of which came in the singles,
where he had a 2 and 1 victory over the Masters champion, Ben Crenshaw.
A month later at St Andrews, Montgomerie's wins in the first four rounds helped
to take Scotland into the final of the Dunhill Cup for the third time, and
although he lost to Zimbabwe's Nick Price, Sam Torrance and Andrew Coltart had
already won to gain Scotland's first victory in the event.

SKIING
IT was a day of mixed emotions for Alberto Tomba yesterday, with success in a
World Cup slalom in Italy coming before the threat of the sack from the
Carabinieri.
Tomba celebrated his twenty-ninth birthday with victory on the piste at Madonna
Di Campiglio after Jure Kosir, quickest after the first leg, crashed.
``You can imagine what this win means,'' said Tomba, who has been under police
investigation after a photographer, who had sold nude photographs of him to a
magazine, complained the Italian had thrown a heavy glass trophy at him after a
World Cup race on Sunday.
Tomba was only third after the 59-gate first leg, but then pulled out all the
stops and flew down the piste on the second run to clock a combined time of
1min. 34.62sec. for his first victory of the season, with France's Yves Dimier
second. Overall World Cup leader Lasse Kjus, of Norway, finished third but was
later disqualified for straddling a gate, third place going to Italy's Konrad
Ladstaetter.
However, Tomba's joy was cut short with the news that he could be sacked from
the para-military Carabinieri police after the incident with the photographer.
The police have stated that their inquiry would ``examine the disciplinary
position'' of Tomba, who holds the rank of sergeant.
The freelance photographer suffered a cut hand after Tomba appeared to throw a
magnum of spumante and then a heavy glass trophy at him during a prize-giving
ceremony on Sunday.

THE West district have suspended United WS for two-and-a-half years following
an incident at the Scotstoun complex last month when a female member of staff
was verbally assaulted by the United WS team and had to be escorted from the
pitch by Irvine, the opposition.
The woman had gone on to the field to terminate the game after the time for the
let had expired, and now the district have suspended the club for bringing the
game into disrepute.
As United WS had been warned in March as to theirconduct, they have also been
banned for the remainder of the season as their discipline has been showing no
improvement.
The severity of the suspension has surprised the club. Parvez Malik, the
secretary, said: ``Emotions are running high among some of our members for they
are horrified at the length of the suspension. We have contacted our solicitors
and will be appealing.''
No matter the outcome, the future of the club is in the balance. The captain of
the mainly Asian side, Khalil Malik, has suggested: ``Once this case is over we
will not play again,'' while president of the West district, Stuart Stephen,
said: ``We regret having to take this decision, but with United WS having
received written warnings, we have been left with no alternative.''

ROUTINE issuing of visas by American authorities in the United Kingdom was
suspended yesterday because of the renewed row between Congress and President
Bill Clinton over the federal budget.
The consulate generals in Edinburgh and Belfast, and the American Embassy in
London all stopped dealing with visas for non-immigrants and immigrants for the
duration of the US Government shutdown.
Routine services for American citizens were also suspended but the authorities
said UK citizens who were travelling to the US for business or pleasure for up
to 90 days did not need visas.
A spokeswoman at the London Embassy said the suspension had no connection with
the possibility of the American Consulate General in Edinburgh being closed.
Earlier this year, the Edinburgh consulate was threatened with closure, with
other consulates, as the US State Department sought economies.
Lothian region and Edinburgh councillors campaigned for it to stay open and
enlisted the support of two former presidents, Jimmy Carter and George Bush.
On October 27, a spokesman at the US Embassy said Congress had decided to defer
a decision on the Edinburgh consulate until a foreign affairs budget was
presented at a future date. A number of other consulates were being closed. Dr
William Crowe, the US Ambassador to Britain, indicated in a lecture in
Edinburgh that he was not optimistic about the consulate in Edinburgh
continuing.

NO TWO ways about it. Whatever your role in the music business - performer,
student, educator, promoter, writer, broadcaster, librarian - the new Scottish
Music Handbook is an indispensible tool of the trade. But it will be of
interest, too, to the vast public which attends musical events throughout the
country, or anyone who wants to find the range of general or specific musical
activities in their region.
If you want to join a choir, book a ceilidh band, learn an instrument, buy an
instrument or get a broken one fixed, apply for a grant or make a recording,
book a hall or commission a composer, there is information in this handbook
which will take you where you want to go.
Well-organised in layout, the handbook embraces organisations, education, young
people's music, sources of funding, suppliers and services, clubs and
promoters, and so on.
By far the largest section is given to artists, who are categorised by genre -
classical, country music, early music, folk and traditional, jazz, light music,
music from other cultures, rock.'n'.pop, and community. Within these categories
there are further subdivisions according to type. So, in folk and traditional
music, for example, you can trace, alphabetically, lists of agents, bagpipers,
fiddlers, mandolin players, Uillean pipers, and more.
The statistics alone give an astonishing account of the volume, density, and
geographical spread of music activity in Scotland. I counted 73 choirs, nine
opera companies, 11 chamber orchestras, 22 symphony orchestras, 50 separate
sources of funding, and 125 composers and arrangers.
The sections are packed with information: across the entries on choirs, for
example, you can learn where they're based, their historical background, the
type of music they perform, their regular rehearsal and concert dates, and
contact numbers.
Each section of the book is prefaced by an essay. These are by a range of
contributors and are of varying quality, from the informative to the
self-serving and superficial.
These notwithstanding, the handbook is an immediately useful goldmine of
information and contacts. Copies can be obtained from most good bookshops or
directly from the Scottish Music Information Centre, 1 Bowmont Gardens, Glasgow
G12 9LR. (Tel 0141 334 6393) Price #12.99.

SWITZERLAND, in the same group as Scotland in next year's European
Championships in England, surprised the football world last night by sacking
their English-born manager, Roy Hodgson.
Hodgson, who coached the Swiss to their first World Cup finals in 30 years last
year, was recently appointed manager of Italian Serie A side Inter-Milan, and
had intended to stayed on as part-time manager of Switzerland, making it clear
he wanted to lead the country to their first European finals in June.
However, the Swiss football federation yesterday named Portugal's Artur Jorge
as national coach. Jorge will commence his duties on January 1 on a contract
that runs through to the end of the 1998 World Cup finals in France.
Jorge, 49, has an impressive pedigree in European league football, but he may
face an uphill struggle in winning over Swiss players and public. He was
previously coach of Benfica, but left in September on amiable terms after 15
months of mediocre results. Before that, he had a successful three-season stint
as coach at Paris St Germain. Under Jorge's guidance, they won the French title
in 1993-94.
Scotland manager Craig Brown, whose side face Switzerland at Villa Park on June
18 in Euro '96, said: ``I've got to be pleased with this news because I am
fully aware of Roy Hodgson's abilities as a coach,'' said Brown. ``He is a
personal friend and a great coach, so I can't be too disappointed that
Switzerland will be under new management. But I can't say much more because I
don't know much about Artur Jorge.''
q SCOTLAND have climbed six places in the FIFA world rankings to twenty-sixth,
following a run of only one defeat in nine matches. England have dropped out of
the top 20. Rankings:
1, Brazil (last year 1); 2, Germany (5); 3, Italy (4); 4, Spain (2); 5, Russia
(13); 6, Holland (6); 7, Argentina (10); 8, France (19); 9, Denmark (14); 10,
Norway (8); 11, Romania (11); 12, Mexico (15); 13, Sweden (3); 14, Czech
Republic (34); 15, Colombia (17); 16, Portugal (20); 17, Bulgaria (16). 18;
Switzerland (7); 19, USA (23); 20, Ivory Coast (25).
