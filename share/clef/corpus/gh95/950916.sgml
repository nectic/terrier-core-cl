The countryside of the Great European Plain is unremarkable but, as
Doreen Taylor-Wilkie reports, it is the crucible of the continent's
history.
EVERY time I climbed into a train for another journey through Germany,
there was this sense of adventure. At first, I couldn't explain it. Why
should it be exciting to sit in a carriage and watch the miles go by?
It was not as though the country was dramatic -- no great mountains,
or spectacular views. Just flourishing agriculture -- cattle, sheep,
luxurious hedges and grain turning gold for mile after mile, only varied
by trees, pretty villages, the occasional broad river.
Then I realised: it was the history. Across this great European plain,
for centuries armies had marched and people fled, only to return again
to build their ruined farms and lives. Since the days of the tireless
Roman legions, Prussians, Swedes, French, British, Germans, Bohemians,
Russians and many more had trudged backwards and forwards over this huge
expanse. It was the heart of Europe -- long before the European Union.
My idea was to see as many parts of Germany as possible using a
British Rail International Freedom Pass, which allowed me to wander. To
save time, I had flown to the great hub of Frankfurt, taking the Air UK
flight via Stansted, that lovely, peaceful airport in which to break a
journey.
Frankfurt is a major financial and commercial city, with more than 400
banks, and was the winner over London and other candidates for the
European Central Bank, which have its home in the dizzy heights of the
Europa Tower, a new all-glass skyscraper. Indeed this is a city of
sudden skyscrapers, looming incongruously over older buildings, and
casting long evening shadows. Yet this is also an old city, going back
to Charlemagne.
In the fourteenth century, the Dom (Cathedral) became the place where
German monarchs were elected and later crowned. This was followed by a
great banquet in the Kaisersal of the ''Romer'' (City Hall), still used
for city council meetings, and its balcony for great occasions. The
Romerberg (square) below is the heart of the old city, where huge open
air markets once took place, full again of ''apparently old'' buildings.
Before the Second World War, this area held several hundred old
half-timbered houses. Today, only one original remains, Haus Werheim.
Hard though it is to believe, all the rest are meticulously restored. So
it is even with the Romer itself, where only one doorway survived, with
several beautiful churches, and the fountain that used to flow with wine
at the early crownings. We sat happily outside the cafe opposite and
watched its less ambitious spray of water falling cool on the sunny
square.
Germany's major poet, Goethe, was born in 1749 into a wealthy
Frankfurt family. Goethe's Haus is one of those I would never have
guessed had been rebuilt -- a typical eighteenth-century redstone
townhouse, with a pretty small garden at the back. One of the reasons it
all seems so real is that, in 1942, the Goethe Society bravely removed
all the contents for safe-keeping.
This was a courageous act because, at that time, even to hint that
Germany might be badly bombed was dubbed disloyal. The result today is
that we were able to wander the wide staircase through some 20 rooms,
past the family portraits and Goethe's desk where he always worked
standing, marvel at the puppet theatre where he designed childhood
plays, and admire an early form of central heating.
Frankfurt spends a lot on cultural and artistic events, and its
museums are famous. Taking a pedestrian bridge over the Main, we came to
the Museum Mile, some eight major museums in beautiful positions along
the river. Just over the bridge is the nineteenth-century Stadel, built
to house the collection of the its founder, the merchant Johann
Friedrich Stadel. There are works from painters such as Botticelli,
Durer, Rembrandt, but the Gallery's prize possession is the
fifteenth-century Lucca Madonna by Jan Van Eyck. So earnestly was it
being described by a local lecturer that it took us 20 minutes to get
anywhere near.
Another favourite was the Kunsthandwerk Museum (Arts and Crafts from
many lands) in a beautiful modern building. Others cover Architecture,
the Post, Film, History, Natural History, and an unusual Ikon Museum.
The reward for all this hard work was lunch at an outdoor cafe at the
Sculpture Museum.
The train journey north follows the River Main to Mainz, once the
Roman headquarters in Germania. The Roman Stones in the Zahlbachtal
(valley) recall that time and, from later, are the 1000-year-old
Cathedral and a fourteenth-century wooden tower of the medieval gates.
The great time to be in this old university town is Carnival, just
before Lent.
At Mainz I began the journey along the Rhine, one of Europe's
classics, and our train ran along the west bank. Each small town and
village, clinging to the river banks, has its watch tower where barons
and greedy burghers once sank river boats and stole their cargos. On
each side vines cling to any possible ledge, in some places almost
vertical, which make harvesting tricky. This is one of the great wine
areas. Not far south of Koblenz is the Lorelei's Rock, where the lure of
her singing enticed sailors to their deaths.
To bring the Rhine even closer, we decided to take a boat tour on both
the Mosel and the Rhine. If possible, the Mosel, a gentle river that
somehow seems warmer, has even more luscious vines. But you could watch
a river like the Rhine for ever. It is beautiful but not necessarily
tranquil. At times, great long barges, linked two-together, push their
way up river, laden with cargo, scattering ducks and other waterfowl,
and stirring the occasional floating pieces of wood, which bob and dip
like sea horses.
South Koblenz on the east side is the Rhine's only intact castle,
Marksburg, inhabited for 700 years. There is a drawbridge and vaulted
gate, and the Riders' Stairway, chiselled into the rock. I could only
marvel at how anyone ever rode a horse up it.
The castle stands high above Braudach and, from the battlements where
defenders poured oil and tar on the enemies below, it was easy to see
why the barons chose sites like this. Nothing could move in the
countryside or river without being spotted.
Koblenz is a typical German small city of squares and old streets, and
a deep wall along the river bank. It lies in the centre of farmland and
villages such as Brey, from 1500, with a half-timbered Gasthaus and
Alter Weinstube. At the top of the steep main street is an old, but
still working, farm, and a little shrine crammed against the building
nearby. Ryen, closer to Koblenz, is full of white, half-timbered houses,
and a statue of St Joseph leading down to the river. A solid arched
wall, has marks to show how high the river rose.
Before the train reaches Cologne, the line passes Bonn, still the seat
of Germany's parliament but not for much longer. Even from a distance,
it was not possible to miss Cologne's vast cathedral, more than 150ft
high above the nave, with the sonorous St Peter's Bell, which weighs 24
tons. But this time there was no chance to revisit many places I had
known earlier. It was quickly back to the station, and the next
Inter-City Express (ICE) for Hamburg.
Once again the great plain opened up ahead of us. There is interest on
the train, too, in meeting people. From Frankfurt, in the restaurant
car, I had met an Austrian dress designer on his way to a fashion show;
the journey to Hamburg turned into an interesting day with two German
women, one a student with excellent English, one travelling to Lubeck on
the Baltic, with no more English than I had German.
In no time, we were all deep in talk, the revealing sort that you can
have only with people you will never see again. Later I met a man who
lived in Dortmund, but had been born in Konigsburg in what became East
Germany. He was five when his family fled west at the end of the war and
he had gone back with his much older sister only this year . . .
''Nothing was left,'' he said with a shrug, ''and that was harder for
her. She could remember.''
The Free Hanseatic City of Hamburg was one of the oldest republics in
Germany. For a long time it did not even permit nobles to come in and
mix with its affluent burghers. It is also called the most British city
outside Britain; a long-established Anglo-German Club flourishes. In
truth, it is more like any of the trading cities established by the
medieval Hanseatic League, which controlled trade from the Baltic to the
North Sea and along the coast of Northern Europe.
Hamburg is a water city, not just along the docks but also in its
lakes, Ausenalster and the Binnenalster. At any time, sails dot the
Ausenalster and watersports are popular, while Binnenalster is so close
to the centre of the city that it is only a few minutes from the
Hauptbanhof (main station). There are also canals, used to bring in
goods before the Elbe was navigable as far as Hamburg.
Never far away are some 450 Canada geese, the progeny of four which
Queen Elizabeth II donated on an early visit! All this water and some
one and a half million trees turn Hamburg into a vast parkland, but
traffic moves fast and I soon learned that it was not wise even to think
of jay-walking.
The best way to get a first glimpse is by the glass-topped boats that
tour the lakes and the harbour, though the sun soon lured us outside to
the open-air stern. The view from the lake made it easy to see why
Hamburg people boast so much about the prosperity of their city. Huge
houses with magnificent gardens face streets lined with trees, 96
consulates speak of the sea, and the old Hanseatic buildings are
magnificent, Nor are the canals only for pleasure. They are public
transport for people in luxury suburbs such as Eppendorf, who can leave
their cars at home.
We had an evening at the Musikhalle, Hamburg's famous and beautiful
concert hall which escaped Second World War bombs. Its centrepiece is
the Brahmatorium, with a huge statue of the composer.
Like any port, Hamburg has its redlight district, the Reeperbahn in St
Pauli, long a place where tourists went to get a glimpse of the
peep-shows. But much has changed since the Reeperbahn was hit hard by
worries of Aids. With great resourcefulness, the district decided to
change. Now there are theatres, clubs, and nightspots of a much more
conventional kind. Hamburg has 5000 musical theatre seats but it is
still hard to get a ticket for the favourites.
This is an immensely lively city with beer gardens, restaurants,
cafes, indoor and out.
From Hamburg, it is only three hours by train to Berlin with just one
main stop. Again the countryside rolled by, sunlit and green, but, was
it my imagination, or was it less tidy, the buildings less prosperous,
and the whole landscape emptier than in former West Germany? After a
couple of days I decided it was not my imagination.
I had not been in Berlin since the wall came down and found myself
totally disorientated. The great point of reference had gone, with a few
stretches left. Not only souvenir hunters, eager to sell a piece of
painted graffiti, have completed that first exhilarating destruction,
but it is as though Berlin people want no reminders of the past. Though
understandable just now, future generations may regret that no memorial
has been left to so much pain.
One place I remembered was Checkpoint Charlie where we had made our
way through to East Berlin. Today, only the marks on the road are left
and one watchtower which those determined to build on every square yard
of valuable land are determined to demolish. Few maps mark where the
Wall stood and to find out more, I joined Berlin Walks (tours in
English) led by expatriate Nicholas Gay, who is a mine of knowledge.
He took us to the wall Museum, founded by one man, Rainer
Hildeebrandt, in a building close by Checkpoint Charlie. In graphic
words and pictures it traces some of the miraculous escapes, with people
crammed into unlikely parts of motor vehicles, and the young man who
took his sports car with escapers packed below its roof line under the
barrier. But it also recalls some of the tragedies of those who did not
succeed.
The bus to take is the 100 from Berlin Zoo, along the Siegessaule, a
huge winged statue gazing loftily over the green of the Tiergarten, then
on to the Brandenburg Gate and, miraculously it seemed, past where the
Wall once stood on to Unter den Linden, Berlin's most famous street. The
thrill of that matter-of-fact crossing was superb, and so were the old
buildings, the Stadtsoper (Opera House) and Konzert Haus, where the next
evening I heard the Berlin Symphony Orchestra play Mozart and Bruckner.
On the last day, I did what everyone should do in Berlin; I took a
river and canal voyage. In three hours from Stadt Mitte we circled
Museum Island, which holds the National Gallery and Pergamon Museum,
among others, then sailed west on the River Spree past the Reichstag,
under bridge after bridge to Charlottenburg Palace.
Charlottenburg was built in 1690 by Sophie Charlotte, wife of Frederik
I, and has a gallery of German Romantic paintings that is a real gem. On
the way back we took the Landwehrkanal, right through the heart of the
city. With a good restaurant on board, this was my most peaceful tour of
all.
Next it was back on the ICE train, across Germany again, to the Rhine
at Dusseldorf and a quick tour of the Altstadt, the old town, which is
full of restaurants, shops, breweries, with many bars making their own
beer, all set against a delicious smell of baked biscuits.
Then a short S-bahn ride to the airport, and back to Stansted, with
the feeling that in 10 days I had absorbed a great deal.

A CALIFORNIAN chemist is likely to be canonised by the world's teenage
population. No, he has not invented the next range of designer drugs,
but he might have found a cure for acne.
Dr William Wood from Humboldt State University has discovered a
substance in the feet of deer which researchers previously thought to be
scent-marking material but which may actually be an anti-microbial agent
that protects the animals' feet from infection. His work has shown that
the secretions from glands between the toes of black-tailed deer inhibit
the growth of micro-organisms. In particular it works against the
primary pathogen that causes human acne.
The chemicals which the deer use for scent marking also help prevent
it from picking up microbial infections.
Starting with the natural product, Wood synthesised several additional
compounds and tested them against a variety of bugs. He found that its
main compound is active against a narrow range of micro-organism
species, which includes bacteria, fungi and yeasts.
The greatest activity occurred against Propioni bacterium acnes, the
main cause of acne in humans and in particular, human adolescents. Not
surprisingly, as it protects the dainty feet of deer, it works against
the fungal infection which causes athletes' foot. Even better for some
was the noted effect against Pityrosporum ovale which causes dandruff.
While the mechanism is unknown, it seems that most of the
micro-organisms affected by Wood's compounds are those that depend on
skin oils as a nutritional source.
Synthetic versions of the compound could now be the active ingredient
in a new generation of highly specific anti-acne products. US based
Research Corporation Technologies is now commercialising the invention
for the university and Wood, and the discovery could be a huge
moneyspinner. In the US alone, anti-acne preparations generate more than
$500m in business every year, and most of the non-prescription remedies
are only mildly effective against acne.
Dermatologists prescribe antibiotics for serious acne cases. Although
antibiotics are highly effective against acne, their long-term use can
lead to other infections and development of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria. The broader the antibiotic spectrum, the greater the number of
bacteria species that have the chance to develop resistance. Although
broad-spectrum treatment is justified when bacteria cannot be
identified, targeted antibiotic treatments are more desirable.
It seems that the smelly stuff from between the toes of the
black-tailed deer could be the answer to teenage prayers the world over.

THE commonly used conservation tool of relocating threatened or
endangered species results in the loss of genetic variability,
scientists in Georgia have discovered. They believe that genetic
variability is important for an organism's short and long-term success.
The researchers at Georgia University's Savannah River Ecology
Laboratory studied populations of fish that were moved from sites in
Texas to California and then to Nevada more than 60 years ago to control
mosquitoes by eating their water-borne larvae. They found that recently
established fish populations had lost a number of rare gene variants
called alleles. Such genetic variation is important in helping
populations cope with environmental change.
Dr Gene Stockwell attributes the loss of alleles to a ''bottleneck''
that probably occurred early in the introduction history. Bottlenecks
occur when the number of individual organisms declines and then
recovers, and genetic variability is lost in the process, he explained.
''These results were surprising because the initial transplant
involved 900 fish and because mosquitofish have numerous reproductive
traits that should minimise the effects of bottlenecks on genetic
diversity,'' he says.
Using an analogy to describe the mechanism, he added: ''If you have a
hundred blue marbles and only a few white ones, then when you grab only
a handful, you will probably pick up only blue marbles. If in the
future, as conditions change, you may need white marbles to adapt to the
change.''
The findings apply to other organisms that are relocated and to fish
such as trout and salmon that are raised in hatcheries.
''We recommend that before a population is relocated research should
be conducted to determine the genetic variability of the sample
collected for relocation,'' Dr Stockwell said.
''Researchers should also go back and sample the relocated population
to determine if it has retained genetic variability in the new location.
In this way, researchers could look for bottlenecks in genetic
variation.''
Meanwhile, in Scotland, biodiversity is considered vital enough to
have attracted a massive #377,000 three-year grant from the Scottish
Office Agriculture and Fish department. The grant is to Glasgow
University's Division of Environment and Evolutionary Biology in
co-operation with the Scottish Agricultural College for one of the
biggest biodiversity studies in the UK.
The objective is to identify predictive relationships between defined
groups of plants present in the Sceptic agricultural landscape from
uplands to lowland and the biodiversity of vegetation, birds, and
insects. Using the information will give researchers an insight into
modelling the likely impacts of land use change.

THIS is the latest in split-screen racing action combining new video
game technology with the cutting edge of radical racing, so Nintendo
say. Gamers looking for smart graphics, good sound, and a diversion
that's actually fun need look no further than Nintendo's new release.
The unlikely combatants in Unirally are cute little unicycles with
personalities of their own. This unlikely scenario is quite appealing.
One player takes control of a uniracer, a single wheeler with attitude
that's built for speed and with improbable gymnastic ability enabling it
to perform all kinds of moves from simple flips to spectacular combat
moves. Each wheelie has its own personality, style and name, and will
also respond to comment on the user's ability.
The object is to beat the clock and an opponent. The racers are guided
around many vast tracks, pulling stunts, tricks and accelerating to
leave an opponent far behind. You can play against the computer, or
challenge friend. It beats street fighting.
The track consists of a suspended network of brightly coloured
pathways which contain many obstacles including glue, ice and one-way
tiles. The graphics are subtly brilliant, with hundreds of ray-traced
frames of animation for the Uniracers, and clear, crisp track and
background images. The music in the game is surprisingly good for the
SNES, with some fast-paced rock tunes helping to set the mood for the
gameplay.
It's also the fastest side scrolling game we've found on a 16-bit
console, with more than 6000 frames of animation making up each unicycle
alone. Gamers have to be fast, alert, and aware all the time because of
the combinations of tracks, directions, and stunts which all increase or
decrease speed. Over all, Unirally is a good game, it's fast, it looks
and sounds great and the Uniracers seem alive, the only reservation is
that the #44.99 game may seem to become repetitive very quickly.

* IT'S quite the opposite of an ignorant pig. This is the intelligent
pig, which eventually could put an end to the constant disruption caused
by service suppliers digging up roads and pavements.
Developed by Pipeline Integrity International, a new unit of British
Gas, the Intelligent Pig can go where no man really wants to go, deep
into the maze of gas pipes and sewers beneath our feet and even under
the sea.
The Pig, is a dedicated robot designed to work down in the dark and
the damp.
It's a sophisticated device that travels through a pipeline, obtaining
information on the condition of the pipe itself.
After a summer of claim and counter-claim about the amount of water
disappearing from underground pipes, this mechanical animal could soon
be nosing around the various mains water supply pipes searching for
leaks and helping to plug them.
The pig, which can carry a camera for visual inspection, can give
operators detailed information about pipeline condition and defects
including corrosion and metal loss, cracks, and exposure.
They can work on or offshore and have the advantage of not causing
huge interruptions to which ever service the line is supplying.
The inspection vehicle has specialised equipment including grouters
and cutters and can be used to carry out repairs and reseal pipes by
spraying a mixture of chemicals which can block punctures and
re-establish pipeline integrity.
Its sensors can report on the condition of pipe walls and pass this
information back to operators who use sophisticated computer programing
to analyse the data to pinpoint the exact location of serious faults.
Finding out where a problem lies means that workers only have to dig a
small hole in the ground to reach the fault, rather than dig major
excavations on a hit-or-miss basis.
The computer program can also predict the potential growth and
development of faults and calculate the risk of pipeline failure and its
consequences.
British Gas are now offering their intelligent subterranean pig to
pipeline operators all over the world in what is proving to be a huge
global market.

THE British athletes who will sweat it out in Atlanta in next year's
Olympic Games will be relying on Aberdeen physiologist Dr Ron Maughan to
get through the heats . . . and the heat. Without him and his scientific
strategy for beating the scorching temperatures in the Deep South, the
world's biggest sporting spectacle could become killing games.
Dr Maughan is chair of the British Olympics Association steering group
and co-ordinator of the acclimatisation strategy.
He's just returned from the weather training camp in Tallahassee where
some of the top athletes spent two weeks undergoing rigorous training
and assessment to ensure they are in the peak of condition when they
actually compete next year.
He tells us: ''Two of the problems facing us in Atlanta will be the
short-term physical changes which the teams will experience on arrival
and which disappear in a week or two, and the need for a strategy in
coping with physical exertion in very hot and humid conditions.
''We know that both physical and mental performance deteriorates in
hot conditions, as everyone will remember during the recent hot spell
here at home.
''But it will also be very humid in Atlanta next year with
temperatures well into the nineties.
''Our strategy is to minimise the impairment on performance in two
ways. The teams will have an acclimatisation period in which they will
train in the heat and get over the physical changes necessary to cope,
like perspiring more and becoming dehydrated.
''Believe it or not, but they will have to get used to drinking more
than 10 times their normal amount of fluids, up to 15 litres a day,
which is almost four gallons.
''Here in Scotland, an athlete can drink a few Cokes, but in Atlanta,
drinking 15 litres would be a disaster, especially for people in weight
category sports. They'd be taking 4500 calories a day, which is more
than people get in food. Adding such a huge amount of calories to their
diet would cause immediate and enormous weight problems.
''We also have to identify the needs of individuals, and the
measurements we took at Tallahassee will be a great help in planing the
strategy for next year. We are seeing more and more major sporting
events in hot and humid countries, like the next Commonwealth Games in
Kuala Lumpur which will be even more severe than Atlanta,'' he said.
Dr Maughan, of Aberdeen University, and a member of the Scottish
Sports Institute, adds: ''Our athletes face severe problems in those
conditions and we are learning how to help them cope to put them on an
equal footing. Scots just haven't been getting the experience of these
situations. If you spend all year training in Glasgow then have to run a
marathon in the tropics, then the problems can be serious.
''In fact there are lots of issues which are only identified when our
athletes actually train under adverse circumstances. Not only will they
have to drink more, but they have to learn how to drink so that they are
not faced with a major event weighed down by several litres of extra
fluid.
''From a scientific point of view, we have to ensure every athlete is
at their peak, so weights and intakes of individuals will have to be
very finely judged,'' he said.
''We are working towards a system which involves monitoring team
members very closely, measuring intake and output. Urine checks give us
a very prompt feedback and let us know whether an athlete is dehydrated
and we are able to rectify any problems before they become severe.
''Over the next few weeks we will be looking at all the measurements
we made in Tallahassee to see how they relate to performance and ability
to cope. This system is very new, but it is vital if our team members
are to be at their peak and to stay fit and healthy.
''Using the information in our databanks we will be able to identify
problems now and have solutions to them when the games start next year.
''We have to keep ahead of the game if we are to stay ahead in the
games.''

Sara Stevenson looks at the work of James Cox.
AMONG the most interesting photographers working in the later
nineteenth century was the son of one of Dundee's richest industrial
families. James Cox was the son of George, one of four brothers engaged
in the jute trade who had come to wealth in the Crimean and
Franco-Prussian wars -- owning a whole street in Dundee and great
baronial houses in the Highlands.
Cox apparently took up photography in the 1870s and was painting
pictures at the same time. He was a collector and probably a friend of
several of the painters -- the Glasgow Boys, Arthur Melville, David
Murray, and Thomas Millie Dow, and others like William McTaggart. His
photography shows the same kind of variety and he declared that he
admired diversity as a source of liveliness.
Unexpectedly, his wealth was not a handicap. His undoubted enthusiasm
for gadgets and improvements -- the experiments he set up for the Dundee
Photographic Association with 3000-candlepower electric light, the
lecture he organised for an audience of 2000 people with pictures
enlarged to 30ft across -- might well have distracted his eye for a good
picture.
Using a whole range of the processes and cameras available at the
time, from the big glass-plate cameras taking pictures 10" x 12" to a
tiny snapshot camera capable of action shots, Cox turned his attention
to his family and friends -- chilly picnics in the mountains, formal
portraits in the studio, theatrical performances and poses -- and the
landscape -- from splendid, distant winter scenes to domestic interiors.
But his most radical and interesting work was taken in the fishing
villages of Auchmithie and West Haven, on the east coast, near Dundee.
Around 1880, he made a study of fishing life there, which is touching in
its humanity, while exploring the intriguing possibilities of the
distortions of light and movement in bright seaside light.
His picture of the two solemn girls and their small, ribald brother
reflects the hardness of the life in an increasingly difficult industry.
The older girl has the seriousness of a working woman and the younger
has picked up her anxiety. But the lad is living in a different world,
even living at a different speed, and is unable to calm down to the
camera's time and let us see his face.
This is a lovely picture and one that Cox himself liked because he
made a big platinum print of it. It illustrates beautifully that
fascinating idea that people sitting side by side can be living life at
a different speed and can react to a photographer in a way that shows us
what they were like. We can, astonishingly, after more than a hundred
years, still feel what it was like to be one of these youngsters.

ASTRONOMY and astrology -- I'm sure you would have to accept that the
two subjects are light years apart these days. An astromologist is as
difficult to find as the fabled unicorn or a poor bookie. Former
Astronomer Royal Dr Harold Spencer Jones once noted that he had never
met an astrologer who actually observed the stars, nor yet a serious
observer of the stars who practised astrology.
It's certainly true that hybrids are difficult to visualise -- somehow
combinations of Stephen Hawkins and Russell Grant, or Patrick Moore and
Mystic Meg, leave the mind well and truly boggled.
All the more amazing, then, that for 2000 thousand years astrology,
widely held to be one of the oldest sciences, was intimately linked as a
discipline with astronomy and taught in the great European universities.
What is now considered mere mumbo-jumbo was in the Middle Ages an
important element in the political and social decision-making process.
Few monarchs would consider rising from their pit without an assurance
of favourable psychic winds from their court astrologer.
Scotland, and in particular the University of Glasgow, can boast one
of the greatest exponents of the combined medieval skills of astronomy
and astrology in the shape of mathematician John Bassantin who is said
to have been born near Greenlaw in Berwickshire.
We know that instead of devoting himself to Latin and philosophy or to
canon and civil law, surefire methods of gaining status and salary, John
''threw himself'' into the study of maths which was generally held in
contempt and even with suspicion as being the key to the black arts.
Glasgow apparently did not provide a suitable intellectual climate for
the scholar and Bassantin travelled to the Continent, eventually
settling in Paris where he lectured in the university and provided
horoscopes for the rich and famous.
Bassantin was no Brahan Seer or Nostradamus but his reputation grew
steadily during his spell abroad. He is probably best remembered for a
very odd encounter in 1562 in London with Sir Robert Melville who was on
a diplomatic mission from Mary, Queen of Scots to her cousin Elizabeth
seeking a meeting between the two monarchs.
In his memoirs Melville tells of a curious discussion in which
Bassantin, ''a man learnit in the high scyences'', told the diplomat
that all his ''upricht dealin'' and ''honest travell'' would be in vain.
The queens, he predicted, would never meet (true); there would be
''lengthy captivity and utter wrak'' for Mary at the hands of Elizabeth
(true); and the kingdom of England would soon fall to the crown of
Scotland (true).
When Melville refused to listen to the ''devilisch news'' Bassantin
assured him he was a devout Christian but pointed out that God gave to
some ''mair and clearer knowledge than to others''.
You can understand Sir Bob being ever so slightly miffed. With a
know-all like Bassantin hovering on the sidelines the chances were that
the entire diplomatic corps might soon be picking up their jotters.

In a regular new column, Dominic Ryan wonders why he belongs to the
only species with a proper sense of aesthetic balance.
IAM confined to my parents' back garden today where I'm contemplating
my sunburnt navel. This is because I'm supposed to be mowing the lawn.
It's easier to be philosophical when there's work to be done.
But why are we so obsessed with ensuring those green blades are kept
neat and tidy? Why can't we let them be?
I'm told it's because only the weak-willed allow their square domain
to grow wild.
Aye, there's the rub! That's the reason I soon must roll out the
deadly machine and bare my soul to the midges . . . because it's every
civilised person's job to claim their domain, stake out their very own
piece of the planet. It's up to us and us alone to conquer the unruly
forces of Nature.
It's not a divine right, a pioneering spirit, or some noble sense of
liberating justice which shapes our modern world. It's the lawnmower;
the deus ex machina which saves us from the entanglement of natural
forces and, in the end, makes everything look just right.
The lawnmower man tames grass-skirted savages, opens up the land of
the free, turns wild places into parks, offers minimalist fences for
drunken hedgerows once filled with all manner of creature who served
only to sully our clean rivers of tar with their flattened innards.
One wonders why Nature was unable to follow the pattern book in the
first place. Instead of those shapeless, jaggy clumps, and mad splashes
of white and gold, I could have my very own symmetrical carpet of
uniform green. Perfection ready-made.
The more I ponder this task -- it's a mighty steep hill for a lawn --
the more pollenous Madame Nature gets right up my nose.
It's not just the grass, after all. There's cutting, pruning, weeding,
rolling. . . for Heaven's sake, are we the only species with a proper
sense of aesthetic balance?
Even the spider under the bird table over there can't shape a decent
web. It's all to one side. Nothing like in the books.
I once read about the ''death of the last wilderness''. Can you
believe anyone mourning the loss of a confusion of bug-infested
branches?
If stung by some pang of guilt for indulging a polluted world of
instant satisfaction and disposable value, or if the video player was
playing up, it might be nice to embark on a day trip back into the
twilight zone, but where in heaven would you park the car?
People who love rain forests invariably live in high-rise flats. Even
a rain forest must look smooth and somehow appealing from way up there
in the ivory towers.
But these are the people who join Greenpeace and like whales.
Beautiful, they say. Messengers from another world. But I've seen whales
on TV and they have clumps of barnacles stuck to their noses.
I wonder what the great barnacled ones make of the current brouhaha in
the South Pacific. If we believe that whales serenade one another across
entire oceans -- and if that's singing they surely took lessons from
Yoko Ono -- they're not going to be too happy with repeated blasts on
the French horn.
In the native language of Polynesia, Mururoa means ''place of the
great secret''; as President Chirac and some deaf whales have discovered
it's not so easy to hide a nuclear explosion.
Apparently, the Mururoa Atoll sinks an inch with each blast and some
scientists worry that one test-day the whole thing might shatter in a
giant garlic mushroom.
Is there something odd about spending so much time manicuring a lawn
when a Pacific paradise is about to be blown apart? Maybe we can blame
Nature for her bad example. Pompeii . . . what a party that was!
If Mururoa doesn't blow up, there's always the possibility of water
simply entering the radioactive caverns under the lagoon and swamping
the Pacific with contamination.
Truly it's our mission to keep the brine pure. Perhaps, that's why
myriad creatures cannot be allowed to loiter in the depths. All goggle
eyes, tentacles, sharp teeth, and fishy smell. Even a good drift net is
a limited sieve for so much debris.
Nature's like that. Messy and unattractive. If it wasn't for our
indomitable housekeeping, the world would be in a sorry state.
Everything needs fixing, from lawns to children's teeth. Flymos and
braces -- the cut and comfort to keep us on the straight and narrow.
Me? Well, I'm too old now for a brace. And, anyway, I think it looks
like rain . . .

* AT the edge of the little estuary across the road the falling tide
has scooped a hollow in the mud. It was here, two autumns ago, that I
stood 10ft from a solitary curlew sandpiper, one evening and again the
following morning at low water. This curious intimacy contrasted hugely
with the origin and destination of the bird. Curfew sandpipers breed in
the Taymir peninsula in central Siberia and winter in southern Africa.
Others move from Russia to South Africa, Australia and New Zealand every
autumn.
The numbers of curlew sandpipers moving through our east coast salt
marshes in August and September fluctuate enormously, as their westerly
dispersal from the high arctic breeding grounds is affected by weather
systems. In 1992 there were only a handful, the most being three at any
one place. In other autumns you can see dozens flicking over the Ythan
or Aberlady, distinguished from the dunlins with which they associate by
their house-martin-like white rumps. This is an easier field mark than
the slightly more decurved bill, the slenderer neck and longer legs or
the more chirpy and less nasal call.
It is one of those birds that you recognise easily once you have
observed its peculiar ''jizz'', the overall appearance, voice and
movement by which we recognise each other as well. I had plenty of time
to absorb the jizz of the curlew sandpiper as I stood observing the
stranger on our shore and it observed, if it was a bird of the year, its
first human being. We should recognise each other's species again.

The names were not the only excitement when Peter Evans ventured out
on a fungus hunt. THere was also the frisson of danger
IT'S 8.30am on a Sunday morning and I'm sitting on a bus in Elm Row,
Edinburgh, outside the hedonist's delight that is the Valvona and Crolla
shop -- well known in the city for its mouth watering Italian delicacies
and wines.
After a Saturday spent in pouring rain and wind on Ben Nevis watching
semi-deranged men and women running up and down the mountain in the
annual Ben Nevis race, I'm feeling a little jaded, and I have to keep
pinching myself to stay awake. Some people have already called to say
they prefer the comfort of their beds and will not be joining us.
The pay-attention voice of Philip Contini -- one of the third
generation family who run the delicatessen business -- comes over the
coach loudspeaker and jolts me into a state of alertness. He welcomes us
aboard, does a final name check and we're off to a secret location to
pursue an activity nothing like as popular in Britain as it is on the
Continent: foraging for fungi.
There are two coaches, and apart from the stay-abeds who decied the
effort of getting to Elm Row early on a Sunday morning was all too much
for them, both are full.
Foragers have come equipped, as requested, with baskets for their
finds, strong footwear and waterproofs. Those with some experience have
bought books for identification and knives for detaching the fungi from
trees. Me, I'm just along for the ride, a fun day in the fresh air, to
learn a bit more about fungi, and the Italian picnic that's coming
later.
I've never managed to pluck up the courage to go fungi hunting, for
fear of picking the wrong thing and ending up in hospital, or, worse
still, on a cold slab with my toes turned up. And I'm fairly typical of
the average Brit, it seems. Searching for mushrooms in damp woodland
glades is not a favourite weekend pastime in this country, unlike France
and Italy, where it is much more popular.
The countryside abounds with edible varieties, whose flavours are as
intriguing as their names, yet such is our suspicion of them that only a
handful of congnoscenti ever get to enjoy them. The rest of us are happy
to play safe and buy from the relatively restricted ranges in
supermarkets. Most will have tasted nothing more exciting than your
everyday cultivated mushroom (a different species from the field
mushroom, by the way).
Around 1200 edible mushrooms grow in Europe. Only about 30 varities
are very poisonous, with another 30 suspect. If you can't identify them
in the first place of course, it's of little comfort to know that not
many will ctually kill you.
However, following a few golden rules will prevent you coming to
serious harm or suffering an unpleasant tummy upset, and you can enjoy
your finds with impunity. The thing to do is to stick to what you know.
If, like the inimitable Manuel, you ''know notheeng'' then go hunting
with someone who does.
Some mushrooms, such as the ordinary field variety familiar to all of
us, chanterelles, giant puff balls, the ''chicken of the woods'' and the
beef steak fungus are readily identifiable. Using them in cooking can
open up a whole new world of flavour -- and it's all free into the
bargain.
Back to the bus and I take the opportunity to chat to fellow traveller
Margaret MacPherson, from Edinburgh, in the seat opposite. ''I've lived
in Italy for 17 years and it's a favourite pastime there,'' she says.
''I don't know mushrooms well enough, so I'd like to know more about
them -- what kinds there are, what are the safe ones and what are the
poisonous ones. I just thought it was a wonderful idea and a nice,
healthy oudoor activity.''
Philip Contini is on the microphone again to tell us more about the
day's itinerary, and reveals that we are heading for Mellerstain House,
between Lauder and Kelso. Once there we are greeted by other members of
the Contini family waiting to serve coffee and pastries for inner
fortification before the hunting begins.
Then we listen to fungi expert Dr Roy Watling, from Edinburgh's Royal
Botanic Garden. A veritable Magnus Pike, wearing a sweatshirt bearing
the legend ''Knackered Gardner'', he explains that the bone dry summer
has not been good for fungi, and that we should not be over optimistic
in our quest.
He shows us giant puff balls and the ''chicken in the woods'' as
examples of edible fungi, explains some of the dangers and touches on
conservation. Picking fungi does little to affect numbers, but trampling
the soil does by destroying the spores, so foraging in large groups is
not a good idea. We are also advised to collect healthy specimens.
We divide into two groups and spread out into the policies of
Mellerstain House in search of fungi. Within minutes, Sarah Morphew
Stephen, from Charleston in Fife, has found a superb beef steak fungus
for Dr Watling to enthuse over. Sliced and cooked, it has a strong
flavour, he says.
His caution about the dry summer is beginning to look decidedly
apposite when I stumble across a huge, shelf-like fungus attached to the
decaying stump of a sycamore tree. Sadly, it turns out not to be edible,
but at least is not poisonous.
After a couple of hours of hunting, everyone returns to Mellerstain
with baskets more or less full of fungi, ready for identification.
First, however, is the pleasure of the Italian picnic with wholesome
bean and pasta soup, delicious pizzas, bread with cheese and sliced
meats, and wine.
Seated, we gather round a table for the knackered gardner's star
performance, executed with utmost aplomb. He pulls samples from the
baskets, delivers their Latin and common names and proceeds to tell us
whether they are of any use or not in the kitchen.
Living up to their name, the phallic stinkhorns are discarded quickly,
but there are plenty of edible specimens, including a reasonable number
of field mushrooms found on the paddocks around Mellerstain. There's the
beef steak found early on, chicken in the woods, Jew's ear and many
more.
Dr Watling's advice for cooking edible mushrooms is to do as little as
possible, first rolling them in flour to seal in the flavour, then
frying them in hot fat. Something else to note is that they do not
improve with age, so unless you intend to dry them, use them soon after
collection.
It's fascinating to listen to someone with such a detailed knowledge
and love of his subject, and the talk continues for some time before we
finally pile on to the buses for the return trip to Edinburgh, much more
enlightened about one of nature's more mysterious bounties.
Autumn is prime time for gathering fungi, so do your tastebuds a
favour and get out there with the collecting basket. If you want to meet
Roy Watling in person and get him to identify some of your finds, he's
doing a fungi surgery on Monday, October 2, at Valvona and Crolla, 19
Elm Row, Edinburgh, 0131 556 6066.

THE temperature was in the eighties. The sky was blue, unsullied by
cloud in every direction. I was salmon fishing at the height of the hot
spell, bemoaning several things.
Firstly, I had made the mistake of wearing neoprene waders. As anyone
who knows about neoprene will tell you, they are great for keeping you
warm. In winter, the long-johns and thermals are no longer necessary and
they keep your backside dry and the kidneys warm as the snow swirls
around you. But in summer . . . a portable sauna seems the best
description. I was awash, a ball of lard, dripping.
Secondly, that damned sunshine. Pointless fishing except before
sunrise and after sunset. In high summer, it makes for a very long day
if you don't stop fishing and go shopping or have a game of golf before
a leisurely lunch and an afternoon nap. Shopping? Golf? On a salmon
fishing day? Behave yourself. I get a form of dyslexia if there are more
than three things to choose from in a shop, especially a gent's
outfitters, and I subscribe to Billy Connolly's version of the old adage
that golf is a good walk wasted . . . and anyway I haven't any golf
clubs. Mind you, I'd have been as well casting with a golf club because
there was precious little water in the river, and I use that phrase
advisedly. The little water that was there was precious. It allowed some
fish to run the river in the dark and gave cover under the trees and
banks for the fish that were already there.
Thirdly, the expense of it all. A day's salmon fishing can set you
back a great many spondulicks. You have to pay handsomely for good water
at the right time of the year and unlike the walk-wasters out on the
links, you usually have to book it months beforehand. Most of the fine
beats on famous rivers are offered to the tenant who fished the previous
year, so it is difficult to get your wader in the fishing hut door, so
to speak. Even if the fishing the previous year was not great, most
people are loath to give up good fishing in case the year they decide
not to go back turns out to be the best ever, with catches up by dozens
and more fish in the river than the 80-year-old ghillie has seen since
the day of the great disaster, when he had the wings of his deerstalker
tied down over his ears and didn't hear His Lordship offer him a dram.
I'm rambling, but that is what one tends to do on days like that. You
sit on the bank baking or hot in the hut and cogitate. If I'm spending
so much for one rod on this beat and there are five other anglers doing
the same, then on this beat alone there is enough dosh being wasted to
buy a modest secondhand car and that's just one day. If you take the
whole river for the whole week, well I think we might be talking
Maserati, Ferrari or Rolls-Royce amounts of money being frittered away
in the hot Scottish sun.
So, to keep myself sane, I decided to take a run up into the hills and
see what effect the lack of rain was having on the burns that feed the
river. It was a mite cooler up there, but no more conducive to optimism
about the river. The rocky pools that provide shelter for the wee ones,
the salmon and trout parr, were dangerously low. And as I have said here
before, it doesn't matter how many salmon come into the river to spawn
if there is nowhere for the progeny to grow in safety. If the drought
dries out all the wee hidey-holes and pools, the parr will die and there
will be no run of smolts to sea and consequently no salmon in years to
come.
So, that perhaps is the true cost of our summer of sun. How many small
fish survived water temperatures in the seventies or found shelter under
a bank that hadn't been trampled flat by sheep or cattle is much more
important than the amount of money spent by anglers who can usually
afford it anyway. Because, make no mistake about it, there will always
be someone willing to fish, but only if there is something to fish for.
Back down on the river, I took off the waders and sat on the bench
under a tree with a beer from the fridge in the fishing hut. It was
going to be a long hot day trying to catch a fish, but somebody has to
do it, don't they?

Funway. Their USA City Breaks brochure features New York, Las Vegas,
Miami, Nashville, and many more. With Glasgow flights and a
''dollar-saving Funbook'' (full of discounts for dining, shopping and
sightseeing), it's worth glancing through if you're planning a trip to
the States between October and April. Boston is offered for #298 for two
nights; New York from #325, and Las Vegas from #379. Alamo car hire is
on offer from #3 a day, and kids (aged 2-11) go for #199. Travel agents
have brochures now.
* BARBADOS is never viewed as a cheap destination, but if you're
prepared to take pot luck on accommodation (and hotels listed are
minimum four star and on the exclusive West Coast), you can have a
holiday there just now with Caribtours for just #775 per person.
There's a minimum stay of one week and the price is based on double
occupancy of a room. Holidays must be booked within 14 days of departure
and this includes scheduled BWIA flights from London. For more
information call 0171 581 3517.
* THE new 1996 South African Airways Holidays brochure has some great
tours in it for those looking to explore what's become the world's
hottest tourist destination. Prices start at #799 for two weeks' car
hire and flights, and there are some good add-ons combining Mauritius,
Botswana, and Zimbabwe.
A tour that caught my imagination was the Country House Self-Drive
Tour, taking in all the highlights of the country while staying in
exquisite country houses. The rub is, it's #2699 per person -- still it
is a 20-day tour. For a brochure call 01342 322525.
* AT MAYS has introduced a spate of late offers for those still
looking for some summer sun: #20 off Unijet Summer Sun Holidays; #40 off
Beach Villas; #25 off Club 18-30; #20 off Cosmos Summer Sun; #100 per
booking of four off Inspirations Holidays and up to 20% off QEII
cruises. For more information call their hotline on 0141 951 8455.
* HOLIDAY Autos have introduced a new USA-only brochure featuring, for
the first time, an all-inclusive car rental rate. No more local taxes
and insurances slapped on with collection of the vehicle. Book under
this scheme and you know exactly what the final bill will be before you
leave Britain.
Lead-in prices start at #163 for a two-door economy car in Florida
including absolutely everything -- even a free 15-minute phonecard in
case of breakdown! Travel agents have details.
* If you're going to Europe by car it's worth bearing in mind the
following advice regarding the carrying of spare fuel: no fuel cans are
allowed in cars on board Le Shuttle or a ferry, and it's illegal to
import fuel in a car to Belgium, though you can carry a full fuel can
once in the country.
In Luxembourg, Italy and Greece, however, it's illegal to carry fuel
cans in a vehicle at any time, so keep petrol levels topped up!
* BLUEBIRD Express is to offer charters to Canada from Glasgow this
winter. Starting November 7 there will be weekly Airbus services until
January 10, 1996, with fares from #239 return. Christmas departures will
cost #359, with Club Class an extra #50 one way. Children under 15 years
have a #50 reduction. 01444 235678.
* AT MAYS City Breaks are offering a special on short weekend breaks
to Paris. Three nights, direct from Glasgow or Edinburgh, will cost just
#176. This includes B&amp;B, return coach transfer between the airport and
central Paris; a free River Seine cruise, free Berlitz guidebook and the
air passenger duty tax. See your local branch of AT Mays.
* ANYONE going to Portugal take note: unless you fancy a #22
on-the-spot fine from the police, carry at all times some form of ID
with photo. The bureaucratic Portuguese have passed a law making it
compulsory that everyone in Portugal -- resident or tourist -- carries
proof of ID incorporating a photograph.
They have not been over zealous in their efforts to tell visitors to
their country, hence a considerable number of irate tourists are
returning with tales of fines eating into their holiday money. So much
for EC comradeship!
* DON'T be stuck in long duty free queues any more. If you know the
product you want call ahead on the freephone 0800 844 844. This applies
to all seven BAA airports: Edinburgh, Glasgow, London Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted, Southampton and Aberdeen.

Come to the window, sweet is the night air!
Listen! you hear the grating roar of pebbles
which the waves suck back and fling,
At their return, up the high strand . . .
* DOVER Beach and the Gareloch may be several hundred miles apart, but
the lines on the right become instantly meaningful to anyone living
close to the shoreline. Michael and Patricia Low and their 21-year-old
daughter Frances live in just such a setting -- in a home which
overlooks the lovely, brooding waters of the Gareloch in west
Dunbartonshire.
It's the perfect house for a family of avid and skilled sailors who
can even see their yacht from the plethora of windows which are a
feature of this bright and commodious home.
When they were first married the couple lived in Helensburgh but, says
Michael Low, ''we always fancied living up the Gareloch. When we had our
first boat, a Piper, we had a mooring off here.'' His wife adds: ''We
sat on the mooring and said we'd like to live in this house. Luckily,
when it came on the market, we were able to buy it.''
The house has been home to the Lows for 17 years now, growing
considerably in that time. The years have seen the addition of a
well-proportioned porch, as well as a utility room off the kitchen,
while an upstairs bedroom has been converted to provide a sitting room
which Patricia Low describes as ''a great wee snug in the winter''.
Part of the very generous balcony at first-floor level has been turned
into sun room, with still more spectacular views across the loch where,
in addition to the comings and goings of pleasure craft, the more
sinister hulks of submarines, plying in or out of their base at Faslane,
can be regularly spotted.
With nine rooms, there's plenty of space for family and friends, not
to mention Mungo, the black labrador. Some of the big bonuses of living
in this spot, says Patricia Low, are ''being out in the country, yet
very convenient for Helensburgh -- and of course, the water, where
there's always something to look at''.
As well as space within the house, there's just over half an acre of
garden.
Frances, a student of product design engineering at Strathclyde
University, says: ''Mungo loves the fields up the back with plenty of
open space for walking.''
Michael Low, who is a stockbroker with Tilney &amp; Co in Glasgow, lists
as another pluspoint -- ''the excellent train service to the city, which
suits me very well''.
But for sailing enthusiasts, the fact that they can get their dinghy
down a slipway yards from the house with their yacht anchored just
another 50 or so offshore, means nothing could be more idyllic. Here is
a home perfectly matched to the family's hobby.
With the lack of space which is too often a feature of many modern
houses, the Lows are particularly appreciative of the roominess of their
elegant home.
The main reception room is the lounge-dining room where the two
open-plan areas are respectively 22ft by 19ft, and 14ft by 12ft. Add to
that five windows, including one so large it covers most of the wall
overlooking the Gareloch -- repeated in their bedroom above -- and it's
easy to understand why the couple fell in love with the house.
Despite its size, however, Patricia Low finds the house ''very easy''
to run. Just as well, since the couple do a lot of entertaining in this
comfortable and peaceful home, which is a very des res indeed.

* IF I could write a Rosamunde Pilcher novel, I know just the place
for the setting: the best-selling author's own home on the outskirts of
Dundee. It would go like this . . .
We leave the narrow, rutted farm road and turn into a wide gravel
drive past a small paddock, and park in front of an imposing large white
house. Through the Spanish-looking archways to the side of the house we
glimpse a small splash pool and a hard tennis court.
Loose-limbed and athletic (that's Pilcher-speak), my photographer
swings his equipment easily from the boot of the car and the
glass-panelled front door is opened as we approach. Rosy-cheeked from
the warmth of the day, the home help ushers us into the hall and
Rosamunde Pilcher hurries down the elegantly curving staircase to greet
us.
In no time at all we are relaxing in comfortable sofas with king-size
cups of fragrant, steaming coffee (in Pilcher novels the coffee is
always fragrant and steaming) in the large, L-shaped drawing room -- the
dining room forming the base of the L.
It is in fact two rooms with many tall sash windows hung with curtains
of deep saffron yellow velvet. The walls are plain and light floods in
from all angles. The sofas are upholstered in textured, plain cream
fabric and the carpet is softly patterned. It is a room of flowers,
books, family photographs, china displays, deeply waxed furniture,
paintings and vibrant combinations of primary colour and pattern. There
are two dogs, a labrador and a long-haired dachshund.
Rosamunde Pilcher is a born home-maker and has a charming home, but
let her take up the tale . . .
''Although it's in farming land, this house was never a farm house,''
she explains. ''We built it ourselves in 1955. We were living then in
the huge, cold family home -- now the Dundee Technology Centre. We
wanted to build a smaller, traditional house but building was restricted
at that time and it was difficult to get materials and labour. We had
three children. Our fourth was born here, and we built six bedrooms and
two bathrooms.
''I am enormously fond of it and still constantly making improvements.
I make most of the curtains myself, lined and interlined and all
hand-sewn hems. As soon as I finished Coming Home, my new novel, I
celebrated by making new curtains for one of the bedrooms.''
The bedrooms on the upper floor are reached from that handsome,
curving wooden staircase and through archways leading to cedar doors.
Many of the beds have patchwork quilts and the smallest bedroom is the
space in which she works on her old portable typewriter. It was her
youngest daughter's room and is decorated in a simple scheme of orange
and lemon on a white ground.
''This is just the way it was when we decorated it for her when she
was 12. Another bedroom still has the Peter Rabbit nursery paper on the
walls. I'm fond of it and see no point in changing it. And this carpet
on the landing came from our first home. It looks as fresh as the day we
put it down 45 years ago.''
Rosamunde Pilcher thought of everything when she designed her home.
Large purpose-built drying cupboards, enormous floored attics with a
stage for children's concerts which at one time also had swings and
trapezes to take care of rainy days.
As we make our way downstairs, Rosamunde's husband, Graham, comes to
say goodbye. Behind him, I catch sight of ''Harry the Head'', as he is
called by the family, his large soulful eyes gazing down through long
lashes from the wall.
''He is a mule deer,'' explains Mr Pilcher. ''I shot him in Colorado.
Now I wish I hadn't, but he was stuffed and shipped over in a thing the
size of a wardrobe and at great expense, so we had to hang him.'' Harry
looks reproachful. Graham grins back cheerfully.
A happy home. The perfect setting for a novel. Perhaps I'll try . . .
* 'Coming Home' by Rosamunde Pilcher is published by Hodder &amp;
Stoughton at #16.99.

Bill Sinclair follows landscaping's ever-changing contours.
* TRY looking on the garden as your home's largest room, the one
visitors see first, suggests Norman Hereward Wilson, who has spent more
than 40 years in the landscape business, and still derives great
pleasure from helping people redecorate that largest room.
In his time he has seen some substantial changes in our gardens, as
well as short-lived fashions. One major influence was the Glasgow Garden
Festival in 1988, ripples from which are still being felt in plots large
and small throughout Scotland.
''It changed landscaping from a grey area to the done thing,'' he
says. ''It even changed the kind of materials available for gardens. For
example, everyone wanted a patio, and instead of just boring grey slabs,
suddenly a range of colours and textures became available.''
Norman, who owns and runs Hereward Landscapes in East Kilbride, was
chairman of the British Association of Landscape Industries in 1979-80
and played an active role in BALI's lobbying of the Environment
Department, which led to the Liverpool and Glasgow garden festivals.
Half of Hereward's business involves domestic gardens -- the fun
market he calls it, since it leads to home owners deriving more pleasure
from their investment.
''With first homes, people tend to tackle their gardens on a DIY
basis. Most of our clients are in their second or third homes, and we
deal increasingly with people who are looking for easy maintenance and
more enjoyment.
''We are often asked to turn a vegetable plot into a lawn -- hardly
ever the other way round.
''Our domestic clients spend on average between #1000 and #2000,
though its not unknown for a client to spend up to #40,000 for a major
scheme carried out in two or more phases.
''Initially, I meet the client to identify what they are trying to
achieve. If they want a design involving a drawing, there is a fee
between #150 and #250, but this is knocked off the bill if we carry out
the work.
''With the sketch we will show the client samples of materials, and we
may look at other gardens we have done.
''The work might extend over three or four years -- patio and grass
this year, features and trees next year, further planting in the third
year and then perhaps a water feature the following year.''
Norman follows his father's habit of asking clients what their hobbies
are.
''If someone is keen to spend all their spare time on the golf course
they won't want to spend a lot of time looking after flower beds, he
says. ''And the garden you want at 45 to 50 may not be the one you want
at 60.
''In the days of vegetable plots and large flower beds, gardening used
to be hard work. Now it can be tuned to be less labour-intensive --
without going to concrete.''
Sometimes Hereward's starting point is a garden left to grow wild.
Norman Wilson says: ''When staff used to come back and say a garden
was so bad you couldn't see the lions and tigers, my father used to say
we'll worry about it when you can't see the giraffes.
''My younger son Gordon is 6ft 4in tall, and if I can't see him for
the weeds then it's a giraffe garden.''
As well as his son Gordon, Norman's wife Kay is involved in Hereward's
sales and promotions, and his elder son John translates his father ideas
into design sketches on a consultancy basis.
Often Hereward is asked to sketch ponds, fountains and waterfalls into
its designs.
''When I was a boy,'' says Norman, ''water features involved concrete:
now they come as a packet. All you need is a hole in the ground for your
plastic pool and submersible pump.
''I have seven grandchildren, so the water feature in my garden has to
be safe. The pond has a metal grille and pebbles, and the centrepiece is
a millstone. The water comes up through the hole and bubbles over the
millstone on to the pebbles.
''It makes an attractive feature, popular with birds and other
wildlife.''
Garden lighting has been in vogue for a couple of years now, and
Norman Wilson recommends pinpointing features. ''A spotlight on trees
can produce a surprising amount of colour to brighten a winter
evening,'' he says.
''You must have a cut-off for power supplies in the garden,'' he adds.
''Lighting can now be 12-volt and is simple to install, but a pool pump
still has to be 240-volt and I believe it is a job for someone
qualified.''
This year the trend in landscaping has been toward Japanese-style
gardens -- ''a bit of gravel, some funny stone, an oddly shaped tree''.
This can be useful for the front gardens of terraced homes, where a lawn
means carrying the mower through the house.
Perhaps a more lasting trend in Scotland is highlighted by the great
increase in the number of patio doors being sold. Apparently we are
learning to enjoy the features of our landscaped gardens all year round
from the warmth and comfort of our sitting rooms.

Gavin Bell travels to the West Indies in search of Treasure Island and
discovers riches beyond the dreams of avarice.
THE problem with Treasure Island is that nobody has actually seen it.
Robert Louis Stevenson, who created it, admitted he did not have the
faintest idea of where it might be, although he accepted it was
generally supposed to be in the West Indies.
After years of diligent research, I believe I may have found it -- in
the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles, 1300 miles south-east of
Florida.
It is shaped like a pineapple, its symbol is a rare parrot, and it is
stuffed with treasure; not the traditional kind that would interest Long
John Silver, but things more precious -- rainforests bursting with
exuberant life, coral reefs teeming with tropical fish, pleasant people
who smile a lot, and seriously good jazz by moonlight.
St Lucia, dubbed ''the Helen of the West Indies'', is far from being
the most popular tourist destination in the Caribbean, which enhances
its charm. It was the prospect of a mildly adventurous holiday off the
beaten track that drew myself and a friend to its craggy mountains and
coral gardens, and we were not disappointed.
With less than 150,000 people scattered over 240 square miles of
forests, banana plantations, and coconut groves, it is not exactly
overcrowded. Outside the bustling little capital, Castries, there is a
sense of space and timelessness; find a secluded bay, let your mind
wander, and it's easy to imagine the Hispaniola rounding the headland
with young Jim Hawkins at the helm.
St Lucia's turbulent history encourages such flights of fancy. The
island's first known European resident was Francois Leclerc, a French
pirate known as Jamb de Bois by virtue of his peg-leg. He specialised in
Spanish galleons -- capturing four in 1554 alone -- while his lieutenant
made a name for himself by holding Havana to ransom for three weeks.
The British and French fought over the island for 150 years, most
notably in the Battle of the Saints in 1782, when Admirals Hood and
Drake were in the thick of the action which destroyed a French fleet on
its way to attack Nelson in Jamaica. Restored fortifications dating from
the colonial era are now popular attractions, while French influence
survives in a patois spoken by most of the islanders.
The principal area developed for tourists and the yachting fraternity
is around Rodney Bay on the north-west coast. Its mile-long white sand
beach is probably the best on the island, and thankfully developers have
been constrained to limit their hotels and apartment complexes to two
and three-storey affairs which do not scar the natural beauty of the
place.
An adjacent marina has a variety of open-air restaurants. One evening
we wandered into the Charthouse restaurant for a digestif after having
dined elsewhere. We began by sitting on chairs near the water's edge,
then sat on the wooden verandah with our bare feet dangling in the
water, and by the end of the evening were prostrate, gazing at the
stars. It was some time before we realised everybody else had gone home.
One of the most charming hideaways is Marigot Bay, a popular yacht
harbour surrounded by lush green hillsides which was where Rex Harrison
was depicted talking with animals in the film Dr Doolittle. Like most of
the island it is pretty laid back; the most energetic form of life we
saw there was a man paddling around the yachts on a surfboard, selling
bananas.
It is exactly the kind of place where you would expect to meet a man
in a top hat having an interesting conversation with a parrot.
The most spectacular sight on St Lucia, which features on its national
flag, is the twin volcanic peaks, swathed in dense vegetation, rising
sheer out of the sea to a height of more than half a mile. From their
base, they seem to pierce the sky.
It was in the shade of these massive geological spikes that we
discovered an unusual waterfall. Having been given directions by a
local, we drove a short way along a concrete road, then followed a
footpath through the jungle for a few hundred yards to where a stream
plunged over a rockface into a shallow pool. At first sight, it seemed
disappointing -- the fall was little more than a spray, and there was
nowhere to swim.
But once under the fall, an unexpected pleasure -- the water was hot,
having risen from sulphur springs. Thus we took it in turns to have a
therapeutic shower, standing on the bare rock and contemplating one of
the most magnificent views in the Caribbean.
While most governments seem oblivious to the destruction of the
world's rainforests, St Lucia is a heartening exception. About 10% of
the island is still covered with virgin rainforest, and an enlightened
forestry division aims to keep it that way -- by force if necessary.
Anyone caught damaging a tree is liable to a $5OOOEC (#1200) fine or a
year in prison.
Part of the cost of protecting the forests, and judicious planting of
Caribbean Pine to prevent soil erosion, comes from revenues from guided
walks. For $25EC (#6) each, we were taken for a three-hour hike through
an exotic sylvan wonderland by Hermina Francis of the forestry division.
From such hidden treasures high in the mountains, we descended to
explore sunken treasures. At its best, scuba-diving is an almost
mystical experience in which one ''flies'' over the surface of another
world, and St Lucia offers some of the best diving there is.
Day trips organized by Scuba St Lucia, which includes boat transfers
down the west coast and lunch in a secluded bay, take beginners and
qualified divers to spectacular coral gardens and reef walls as
jealously protected as the rainforests. The water is warm and clear,
offering good visibility. Swimming through a shoal of silver jackfish,
shimmering blue and gold in the refracted light, is like flying through
a rainbow.
The jewel in the crown of St Lucia is Pigeon Island, the ersthwile
lair of old Jamb de Bois and site of Rodney Castle, where the British
plotted to spike the guns of the French on nearby Martinique. It is no
longer an island, having been connected to the mainland by a narrow
causeway, nor happily are there many pigeons.
It is now a national park, with botanical gardens and an interesting
little museum nestling beneath the ruins of the fort and musket
redoubts. It is a delightful place to stroll through landscaped grounds,
swim in the shallows of a sandy bay, and enjoy a leisurely lunch at a
waterside restaurant.
It was here that my friend and I attended an all-day concert during a
recent international jazz festival. Not being an aficionado of jazz, I
wandered off to explore the fort and imagine Rodney's flagship
Formidable blazing away at the French.
But the following evening I was converted by Luther Francois, the
leader of the St Lucia Jazz Ensemble. We had returned to Pigeon Island
for a nightcap in The Captain's Cellar, an old pub run by Luther and his
wife. It was almost midnight, but Luther was just leading his group into
another set of mellow music for the benefit of an audience we had just
swelled to six.
His flute solos were magic, casting a spell worthy of Stevenson's
Treasure Island. Leaving the old pirate's lair by moonlight, I swear I
caught a glimpse of an old sea-dog with a sabre-cut across one cheek,
and heard him singing:
Fifteen men on the dead man's chest,
Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum!
FACTFILE
GAVIN BELL travelled independently of tour operators, who offer
package holidays with all-inclusive rates at the major hotels.
British Airways and British West Indian Airlines have direct, non-stop
flights to St Lucia from London from about #375 return.
For a self-catering alternative to the luxury hotels, Tuxedo Villas at
Rodney Bay is recommended. Rates from $95 US to $180 per night depending
on season and size of apartment; 8% government tax and 10% service
charge additional. Phone: (809) 452 8553; fax: (809) 452 8577.
The dry season from January to April is the most popular, and the
rainy season from May to October is the hottest. Temperatures generally
range from mid-60s to mid-80s, moderated by constant trade winds.

* CLEARING out bookshelves recently, a task which for me usually means
distribution to other shelves rather than disposal, I came across a copy
of Palgrave's Golden Treasury of Lyrical Poetry.
Inside, on the fly-leaf, there was a carefully pressed four-leaved
clover and the inscription 1953. Quite a momentous year, with the
Coronation and the ascent of Everest, but for me this flower, now faded
to an olive hue, represents the beginning of an interest which has
survived for over 40 years.
People press flowers for all different reasons. You may wish to
preserve that first declaration of love, a single red rose or a corsage.
Today it is possible to have a wedding nosegay or full bouquet preserved
for posterity. Young children may make gifts from them, while botanists
on field trips will use specially treated papers which extract moisture
until proper pressing can take place.
The procedures are simple and you can achieve almost 100% success rate
by following the four Ps of presses, picking, pressing and presentation.
PRESSES:
There are several types of presss on the market, from the simple
book-size portable one made from two sheets of plywood and layers of
absorbant papers, fastened with elastic bands of velcro straps to the
full-size professional press. Still good for emergencies is the
telephone directory, thick book or even under a rug in an area of heavy
use. My own presses are made from 18mm MDF plywood, which is often
flatter than standard ply, though this is just as adequate. Pressure is
applied by tightening coach bolts and wing nuts in each corner; small
G-clamps will suffice. I normally press a maximum of six layers I have a
''sandwich'' of three layers of newspapers, blotting paper and two
layers of plain kitchen roll, plain as in not quilted or textured,
although I have had some unusual results with the latter, producing
seersucker petals!
PICKING:
Ideally, flowers should be picked on a dry day around mid-morning when
when they have fully opened and the overnight moisture has evaporated.
Do remember that there is now a wide group of wild flowers which are
protected by law, banning uprooting or even picking of them. It's never
been easier to buy wildflower seeds from garden centres, specialist seed
merchants and conservation bodies such as the National Trust For
Scotland. Share and exchange your plants with friends and
fellow-gardeners.
Once you have picked your plants, lay them on a flat surface and shake
gently to dislodge any insects. Small flowers may be pressed direct.
Bulkier flowers such as rosebuds and be cut carfully in half, while
multi-petalled chrysanths and dahlias can be taken apart, pressed then
reassembled when ready. Soft-petalled flowers such as geums,
potentillas, hydrangeas, buttercups, daisies, heartsease, pansies,
violas, and anenomes press well, while in springtime you can have
fantatic results with bluebells (although those have a longer drying
period) snowdrops, wood anenomes and sorrels, primroses and violets.
Experiment with ferns and foliage, especially as the colours turn in
autumn, and create a stock of ''fillers'', frothy flowers such as lady's
mantle, cow's parsley, chervil, coriander, baby's breath and
meadowsweet, which can all be used for edging. For striking backgrounds
use large petals such as roses, petunias, godetias, begonias, and
gladioli.
I aim to have all but the heaviest of flowers or leaves ready within
five days to a fortnight, changing the papers every day for the first
four days then every other day until pressing is complete.
There is a wide selection of papers available, including specialist
papers made from different materials. Probably the most suitable and
reasonably priced is parchment or parchment-style papers available at
most art stores.
PRESENTATION:
You don't necessaarily have to stick to producing pictures or cards. A
wide range of articles can be made using pressed flowers -- bookmarks,
book-plates, coasters, table mats, decorative candles, fingerplates for
doors and picture or photo frames.
It is a sad fact of life that pressed flowers, even behind glass, will
eventually fade, although often to pleasing Victorian hues. Colours may
be preserved by using a transparent seal; the non-reflective iron-on
type is preferable, as all air bubbles are removed by this method.
For the ultimate in preservation, why not have your masterpiece
laser-printed?

A swirl of fascinating geometric patterns, found in ley-lined
Wiltshire, Japan, Australia and Scottish fields - are they elaborate
hoaxes or alien communications? The exotic designs have researchers
spinning. Stephen McGinty and photographer Stuart Conway take a look
around the amazing creations.
THE strangest thing about crop circles is who you might meet in them.
And, of course, in the swirls of corn the strangest characters become
the most ordin-ary. Everyone accepts David Icke, in a purple shell-suit,
proclaiming that the intricate concentric circles of unflattened corn to
be a message from a dying Earth to the God-head.
''It's a last desperate attempt by the spirit of the earth to ask
creation for help,'' he explained, before elaborating that as Satan had
cut the planet's communication chord so Mother Earth has had to resort
to a novel form of semaphore.
Then there is Reg Presley, The Trogg's front man who planned to invest
the #1m from Wet Wet Wet's hit version of his song Love Is All Around in
a helicopter and research equipment to aid his examination into just
what lies at the heart of this mysterious matter.
Hoaxers, such as Dave Chorley and Doug Bower who as ''Doug and Dave''
deflated the media attention which swelled in the late eighties around
crop circles, are believed by many to be not only the heart but the
devilish mind behind designs which each year appear in the fields around
the area.
Now you'll find young apprentices such as Rob ''Spiderman'' Irving,
Rod Dickinson and Julian Richardson carrying on the nocturnal work of
the recently retired ''Doug and Dave''. Armed with ropes and iron bars
they have successfully created scorpions and spider's webs to confuse
and confound their opponents.
But believers in the phenomenon of crop circles state that there is a
sinister conspiracy of scientists, world governments, and religions such
as the Catholic church who are manipulating hoaxers to generate a
man-made smoke-screen over something science and technology simply
cannot explain.
The interest from members of the Royal family such as the Queen and
Prince Charles, who were both recently briefed by author and researcher
Colin Andrews of Circles Phenomenon Research International, only adds a
few more colourful characters to a controversial storm that has everyone
spinning in circles.
How are they made? This was the only question worth asking last month
when, in Wiltshire, Reg Presley, Colin Andrews, and aerospace consultant
and UFO researcher Timothy-Roy Dutton visited the bizarre and exotic
designs pressed into the fields of unhappy farmers. Hundreds of
astonished visitors were drawn -- by curiosity -- from France, Germany,
Japan, and America to explore the creations which appeared during the
hours of darkness.
''I don't think they are created by aliens,'' said Michael Green,
founder of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies. ''I don't think they are
created by space ship take-offs. That is not my perception at all. But I
do think we are dealing with an intelligence. It's a very strange
intelligence which humanity cannot as yet recognise or understand.
''There are quite a lot of lines of evidence that say we are dealing
with a genuine phenomenon. This is the difficult bit you see. When it
was just plain circles 10 or 20 years ago, that was easy enough for some
scientists to bustle forward and say it's a natural phenomenon which is
caused by freak weather and climactic changes, said Green.
''But once the formations became extremely complicated and it was
evident that there was an intelligence behind it. More over an
intelligence that was interactive with human intelligence . . . I'm not
talking about hoaxes. Then it becomes rather difficult, because the
scientific community do not believe that there is an other intelligence
on the planet except for the human one.''
For the past year a government body have been attempting to penetrate
the secrets of the circles. The agricultural research body ADAS has
scientists examining the soil samples and roots lifted off crop circles
from around the country.
Anomalies have been found in the ''genuine'' circles but not those
created by known hoaxers. Dr Mike Foley has analysed the results, and,
though reluctant to explain the exact nature of the anomalies in case an
enthusiastic hoaxer should try to duplicate them, he said there was a
difference.
However, he explained that there was not enough data available to
construct an effective test which separates so-called genuine cirlces
from hoaxes. ''It is crucial though to be able to find a test which can
differentiate between a hoax and a real one.''
Michael Green said: ''The effect that has been described to me is as
if a huge bolt of lightning has hit the middle of the crop formation.
It's affecting not only the structure of the soil but the living
organisms within it.''
Such research is crucial for scientists to battle against those who
brand them as being simply duped by hoaxers. Mr Green said they were
dealing with an organised scam designed by international scientists
concerned about the bending protocols of science.
''There is also a strong religious content to it, because obviously
some of the financing agents behind the scam are in fact, we suspect,
major religious organisations. One that has been mentioned by their own
people is the Roman Catholic church.''
Evidence of crop circles creeps back hundred years and spans the
planet with reports arriving from Australia, Japan, and America.
Stirrings in Scottish fields have not been uncommon. In 1993 fields by
Linlithgow Loch where found to contain a circle with a tail, while Fife
has also been blessed. In Corpach near Fort William a circle was even
found, uncharacteristically, among reeds and grass.
Ron Halliday, an administrator at Stirling University and chairman of
Scottish Earth Mysteries Research, has visited sites to conduct
measurements and record local people's reactions.
''There did seem to be anomalies in the earth energy. I found that you
got different reactions from different parts of the circle. There was a
strong pull outside with no reaction in the centre,'' he said. Crop
circle visits have been known to affect people adversly with headaches,
cramps, and sickness sometimes reported.
Of the four key questions of any investigation: How? Why? Where? and
When?, only the last two can be easily answered. Where, is often
Wiltshire and Hampshire and with close proximity to ancient ley-lines
and the structure of Stonehenge, but others have been found in Wales.
When, is always at night with construction by an unknown force estimated
to be in more than five seconds and less than 30 seconds.
How, remains a matter of the deepest debate. Hoaxs are of course,
human, but there is the school of thought which believes they are
divinely inspired -- how else, they argue, could such complex designs be
carved in the dark. Those which lack the mark of man could be a result
of a plasma vortex, in effect, a focused whirlwind.
Electricity generated between a positive charge in the sky over an
opposing charge grounded in the earth has also been put forward. Lurking
behind theories such as tidal-breathing effects and steam pressure, some
insist is the hand of an intelligence which is determined to scrawl a
message for man's attention.
Metaphysical symbols including Gaia, the image of the celtic earth
goddess, have been created. However, the percentage of people who gaze
upon the majesty of crop circles and see the work of nature alone is
small. To the rest, each shape bears a man-made tag.

'You don't argue when you're getting a grant'
* IT was a lovely old house in a stone-built terrace in a Scottish
country town. It was just over 100 years old, modest yet stately in the
way that only old houses can be. The old lady who'd lived there on her
own had, inevitably, let it go down hill a bit; but this was a house
that was ready for a new life.
It would do nicely. Jo bought it. Then her visitors started to arrive.
The first was from the district council. ''Those stairs are too
steep,'' he said, making a note on his clipboard. ''They'll have to be
replaced.'' This seemed strange. If they were too steep for the
nimble-footed Jo, what would they have been like for the old lady? Also,
the houses on either side still had their original stairs. But you don't
argue with somebody who's going to give you an improvement grant.
''The kitchen's too small,'' said the visitor, making a hieroglyph,
''but you can knock down this wall and open it out into the back sitting
room. And I suppose you realise this house has no bathroom?'' Yes, said
Jo, she was acutely aware of the fact; but here was where it would go.
''Fine,'' said the man, ''but access must be from the hall, so you'll
have to block off that door and put another one here.'' And off he went.
The second visitor was the architect for the project, a breezy young
man who tended to wear jeans and comfortable shoes. But the fee he had
quoted was, mysteriously, one-third of that quoted by an architect who
wore a blazer and brogues; so fair enough. He said he'd measure the
bedroom ceiling -- there had to be a height of not less than 2000
millimetres over at least one half of the floor area. (Had the old lady
known about this?) Another house like this he'd measured had to have the
entire bedroom ceiling raised by two inches. ''But you're lucky,'' he
said, winding up his red tape measure.
Then there was another thing. ''Schedule II, Note 2,'' he said. ''The
larger or largest apartment in the house shall be considered to be the
living room.'' But, said Jo, the upstairs bedroom was the biggest by
far. ''I know,'' said the architect, ''so maybe we'll ignore that bit.
However, you need to have a minimum aggregate storage capacity of 1.25
cubic metres for dry goods and 0.3 cubic metres for linen and general.
Which you haven't.'' And off he went, breezily.
The third visitors were from the gas company. ''The pipe will have to
go in here,'' said one, pointing a steel-capped toe at a beautiful
hydrangea bush. Must it? yelped Jo. ''Must,'' he said. Jo reached for
her garden fork. Later, her car was filled with dusty-pink and blue
hydrangeas for distributing to the needy.
Last time I visited the lovely old house it was a complete shambles.
No wall or floor didn't have a hole. A rubble-filled skip half-blocked
the street outside. Jo was muck-streaked but defiant. A voice, a
little-old-lady voice, was whispering to her: ''Don't worry, dear.
You're going to love it here.'' Jo asked, mentally, if she'd be in
before Christmas. ''I promise you,'' said the voice.

Aileen Little discovers how the bishop's wife became 'addicted' to
creative needlework
* THE tranquil sitting room in their spacious family flat near St
Mary's Cathedral provides a welcome refuge for the Bishop of Edinburgh,
the Most Reverend Richard Holloway, and his wife Jean, who have now
refound their peace after the flurry of press coverage prompted by the
bishop's controversial remarks over couples co-habiting earlier this
year.
Mrs Holloway's idea of homeliness is a decor of calming reds, beiges
and blues, with toning patchwork soft furnishings which she first began
in 1975. ''I was at the house of a friend who was doing a bit of
patchwork -- I'd never seen it in progress before. Another friend and I
decided to make Christmas presents that year and I made cushions. It's
terribly addictive.''
Raised in Wisconsin, then in New York from the age of 12, Mrs Holloway
is the daughter of an experienced needlewoman. ''She made a lot of my
clothes and I made a lot of my own daughter's clothes. It was partly
thrift because we were living on a shoestring, but it was also
enjoyable.''
The patchwork quilting, however, has taken a particularly firm hold.
''It's relaxing, but takes over, so I'm trying to shy away from it at
the moment,'' says Mrs Holloway, who is treasurer of Thistle Quilters
and a member of the UK-wide Quilters Guild.
Nearly two years ago, she contributed to the Guild's fifth national
exhibition. The theme was traditional patterns with a new slant, and she
was subsequently thrilled to find her exhibit on the cover of The
Quilter magazine.
The complexity of that quilt typifies the kind of challenge its
creator likes to set herself: ''I love spending an evening with grass
paper. Geometry was the only subject in which where I got straight As at
school. I even love hitting a snag -- it throws me back on my
ingenuity.''
Over the years, that ingenuity has resulted in at least a dozen quilts
in log-cabin design. Home-crafted quilts cover all the household beds, a
mountain of cushions has been made, and a cot quilt for every baby born
to clergy in the diocese. ''Eventually they got ahead of me so I had to
stop,'' says Mrs Holloway.
More cot quilts for dispatch to Romania, pincushions galore -- and
wall hangings. An example of this last art form hangs in the family
room. It is composed of tiny hexagons in Mrs Holloway's favourite reds
and blues, the shades merging into an impressionistic effect.
Covering a table, altar cloth fashion, a quilt in 3D baby block design
provides a striking focal point. ''I love optical illusions. The quilt
on our bed is made with straight, lined pieces, yet the overall effect
is of circles. I find that intriguing.''
Jean Holloway's expertise doesn't stop at furnishings. She has
produced four quilted jackets, keeping a silk one for ''best'', numerous
waistcoats, and she even made her husband's cope and mitre.
These vestments, she hastens to add, are not in patchwork! All of it
is created in the workroom where, for the time being at least, the
sewing machine remains under wraps.
While its owner completes an Open University course related to the
counselling she does for several agencies, craftwork must take a back
seat. But not for long, she hopes. ''It's very satisfying to watch
patchwork grow, then to live with it. I'm hooked on it.''

The man who made my classic dream machine is extending his range,
writes EILEEN CRONE.
SIX years ago I bought a bed from an enterprising young man with an
unusual and unforgettable name, Roland Ziervogel, after seeing an
intriguing small advertisement in a Sunday newspaper. In those days he
worked in a unit at Hillington Industrial Estate, under the name Our
House, and produced a limited range of beds and tables.
When I left my then partner, I took the bed with me and was never
allowed to forget that I had taken something rather special. I thought
so anyway, and had no intention of leaving behind my Argyll bed,
machine-made in solid American ash. It is robust, of high quality, and
to my mind its clean lines, with echoes of Mackintosh, make it a modern
classic.
At that time, Roland proclaimed that the most interesting designs for
the mass market were to be found in Habitat, but he could offer
something of much better quality and design for the same money. The
Argyll bed sells for #355 (3ft), #465 (4ft 6in), and #535 (5ft).
Nowadays Ziervogel's business is based at 41 Dawsholm Avenue, on
Glasgow's Dawsholm Industrial Estate, and his furniture range has been
expanded to include wardrobes, mirrors, and bedside tables to go with
his beds, and he is working on sideboards to add to his range of dining
room tables and shelving.
Roland, 32, says: ''I am trying to move out of the bedroom and give
the range some depth, though I do not have dining chairs as yet.''
Our House's development has been steady since Roland began it in 1987.
''I was the perennial student,'' he says, ''and the impending doom of
unemployment set me to thinking that I would like to use the practical
skills I had shown as a boy. I was always interested in design, but had
no formal training.''
At the moment he works on his own, selling directly to the public,
largely through word of mouth recommendations. His main sellers of the
collection are still his beds.
One of the beauties of his furniture is that, while not bespoke, it is
made to order and the dimensions of beds and mirrors can be altered to
suit the setting.
The only problem is that you'd better not be in a hurry, for it could
take up to six months for your furniture to be ready, depending largely
on Roland's holiday schedule -- and Roland loves his holidays. He is at
present on relaxing in Kenya.
Speedier completions could be on the way, however, since he plans to
move into a new and adventurous phase in his business development on his
return.
He recently received planning permission for new premises in a
self-build project on the Dawsholm Industrial Estate. This is being
backed by the Glasgow Development Corporation as a manufacturing
investment.
He hopes to employ a workforce of five innovative cabinetmakers and
possibly a trainee or two. The project starts in October with an
expected completion date of January-February 1996.
Roland has been thinking of changing the name of his business for some
time now and has come up with Wildwood.
Charles Church at the GDA says: ''We are backing Mr Ziervogel as we
believe his company has a great future.''
My ex-boyfriend is also entering a new phase in his development, by
accepting the loss of the beloved bed. He recently bought the same bed,
customised to 6ft square -- compared to the 4ft 6in we had. Maybe he is
trying to tell me something...

THE CRAIGENDARROCH HOTEL AND COUNTRY CLUB
Ballater
Unsurpassed luxury in regal surroundings
WHEN marmalade magnate John Keiller decided to build a luxurious home
just across the River Dee from the Balmoral estate in 1891 he would
never have imagined that a century later tourists to Royal Deeside would
be able to enjoy ''the finest view in Scotland'' from his home.
No expense was spared when Craigendarroch was built on the outskirts
of Ballater and just as Mr Keiller aimed to provide the highest
standards of the day for his family the current occupiers, the
Craigendarroch Hotel and Country Club, are aiming for the highest
standards of the 1990s.
It is a four-star hotel but manager Eric Brown says: ''We are aiming
for five-star standards.''
For his entertainment Mr Keiller would have probably enjoyed shooting,
fishing, and walking in the unrivalled mountain scenery above Ballater.
A century on he would be staggered by the options available to those
from far and near who come to spend their leisure time at
Craigendarroch.
Deeside has been one of the warmest places in Scotland this summer, a
not unusual occurrence, but it can also be one of the harshest in the
winter so Craigendarroch has taken steps to ensure that whatever the
weather there is plenty to do.
The area is fast becoming recognised as amongst the most popular in
Britain for activity holidays and the Craigendarroch has a company based
in-house whose staff will organise anything from cycle trekking to clay
pigeon shooting and fly or deep sea fishing to off-road driving.
However, if you feel so inclined, you need never leave the luxury of
the hotel and country club for an entertaining break with or without the
family.
The Craigendarroch has its own pool where, although the management are
discreet about discussing it, the royal family have been regular
swimmers during their summer break at Balmoral.
It has a poolside spa bath, a squash court, snooker room, sauna, an
aerobics studio, and a state of the art gymnasium, and if you really
want to be pampered you can pop into the health and beauty salon.
Within the grounds there is even a 75-metre dry-ski slope and an
all-weather tennis court.
If you want to take your children with you, but still enjoy a rest,
the hotel organises a range of activities which will take them off your
hands.
One of the most attractive features about the Craigendarroch is the
variety which it offers.
There are numerous high quality places to dine nearby but the hotel
itself offers a standard of cuisine uncommon in family hotels in its
award winning Oaks Restaurant or everything from smoked seafood or
fillet steak to pizza in its brasserie-style restaurant in the
Clubhouse.
The Oaks has already been awarded two rosettes from the Automobile
Association but executive chef Eric Faussurier is working hard for a
third.
After dinner, well away from the youngsters and their more lively
pursuits, parents can enjoy coffee in the peace and luxury of The Study
in front of a roaring log fire.
Virtually all the rooms at the Craigendarroch have been recently
refurbished to an extremely high standard and from them you can enjoy a
mountain view but if you really want a treat their five suites named
after previous owners of the Craigendarroch are the height of luxury.
Had Mr Keiller made the journey to Craigendarroch -- in modern
transport it is less than an hour from Aberdeen and less than 90 minutes
from Perth -- he could have parked his car in a specially reserved
parking space in front of the Keiller suite.
After a complimetary sherry, and perhaps enjoying a film on the
satellite television in either the lounge or bedroom, he could have
relaxed in the jacuzzi before dressing and strolling downstairs to the
Oaks Restaurant to enjoy a meal of, perhaps, medallions of Angus beef
fillets followed by Highland rarebit.
After a restful night in the king-size bed he could have stolled out
to enjoy breakfast on his balcony while gazing across the Forest of
Balmoral towards Lochnagar.
If he had wanted guests he could have accommodated them on the two
full sized pull-down beds in the lounge which are there for such a
situation, or for children.
Perhaps, like me, he would have been impressed with the video
telephone in the lounge. Without a doubt, he, like me, wouldn't have
known anyone with a videophone to telephone!
There was a time when a lack of snow in the winter or bad weather
during a summer or autumn break would have meant an active holiday on
Deeside might be marred with little to do.
Deeside and the Craigendarroch in particular has ended those days and
the biggest problems holidaymakers now face is how many of the host of
activities on offer they can squeeze in during their stay.
Mr Keiller, I feel, would have been proud of what has happened to the
home he put so much thought into building.
Rather than use the local granite he had the red sandstone from which
it is constructed transported from Fife to Ballater station by rail and
and then hauled up the hillside on carts.
There are more and more vehicles climbing the hill to Craigendarroch
these days as it draws tourists to enjoy the pleasures which Mr Keiller
enjoyed, and many more.

Michael Fry continues his hazardous journey with the Jacobite horde
and finds himself below the gates of Edinburgh.
EDINBURGH, September 16 -- The capital of Scotland tonight lies at the
mercy of Prince Charles Edward Stewart and his 2000 Jacobite troops.
They took up a position late this afternoon at Slateford, only three
miles from Edinburgh Castle and the high kirk of St Giles, which are
clearly visible across the countryside in between. The prince is
spending the night at Gray's Mill, on the Water of Leith, with his
soldiers encamped round him.
On his arrival, Charles sent the city fathers a carefully worded
demand for capitulation. He ordered them to fling wide the gates and
receive him into the town, but promised to preserve their rights and
liberties. At the same time, he made it clear that if there was any
opposition he would not be answerable for the consequences. The
implication was clear; the alternative to surrender may be the storming
and sacking of the city.
In Edinburgh itself, there are signs of panic. Resident Jacobites
expect an occupation at any minute, while leading Whigs wonder whether
they should get out before it is too late. The prince's lightning
advance from Perth, which he left only five days ago, has taken everyone
by surprise.
On the way the Jacobites met no resistance from the people, and little
enough from the King's forces. Marching via Dunblane, they reached the
Fords of Frew, on the upper reaches of the River Forth, on September 12.
They expected to contest the passage, but the detachment of Colonel
Gardiner's Dragoons guarding the fords, had fallen back on Stirling.
This opened the road to Edinburgh. Pressing on as quickly as possible,
Charles bypassed Stirling Castle. Its batteries fired on his army, and a
cannonball fell near him. He remarked only that the ''the dogs bark but
dare not bite''. Two days ago the Jacobites took Falkirk, where the
prince won the support of Lord Kilmarnock, at whose home, Callendar
House, he dined that night. Yesterday he sent a vanguard of 1000 men
under Lord George Murray to attack the bridge at Linlithgow, which
Gardiner's dragoons were meant to hold. But they retreated again, and
Charles was able to take the town unopposed.
The remaining defences round Edinburgh have now crumbled. This morning
the Jacobite army was on the road to the capital at five o'clock. The
last chance for the Government's troops to block their advance was at
Coltbridge, or Roseburn, the hamlet where the Glasgow road crosses the
Water of Leith.
At the bridge, Gardiner's dragoons were strengthened by the only other
regiment left in the Lowlands, Colonel Hamilton's. Both units were
placed under the command of Brigadier Thomas Fowke. The officers were
still discussing tactics when they heard savage yells from the fields to
their West. They assumed that this signalled the approach of the
Jacobites, though one rumour has it that the noise only came from a
dragoon who had tumbled into a disused coalpit.
At any rate, with some city fathers and many citizens looking on in
astonshiment, the defenders abandoned their position and moved off down
the Water of Leith to encamp for the night on Leith Links. They intend
to wait for the arrival of Sir John Cope, commander-in-chief, Scotland.
He is in the process of shipping his main body of 2000 troops back from
Aberdeen towards Edinburgh, after failing to confine the Jacobite
rebellion to the North of Scotland. It is not yet known when he will
arrive. Meanwhile the ''Canter of Coltbrigg'', as local people at once
dubbed it, has shown the reluctance for battle of the King's officers
and their weary, dispirited soldiers.
They have left Edinburgh more or less helpless. The garrison in the
castle is sitting tight and making no effort to hold the city itself.
The defences are disorganised. The Lord Provost, Alexander Stewart, has
come under heavy criticism for being ''slow in his deliberations'' and
''backward in executing things agreed''. About the only measure that can
be immediately put into effect is to ring the church-bells as a signal
for the assembly of volunteers.
In these circumstances, the town council can only play for time. After
the prince's arrival, a stream of messengers went back and forth between
him and the city fathers. This evening, a delegation of them arrived by
stage-coach at Slateford to ask what exactly he expected of them. The
answer was spelled out by one of his closest aides, John Murray of
Broughton. As well as making Edinburgh an open city, they were to
deliver up the arms of both the town and the garrison, together with any
ammunition and military stores. This meeting did not, however, produce
any firm agreement. If bloodshed is to be avoided, the pressure cannot
be allowed to build up much more.
That is why some sudden coup has to be feared. There are unconfirmed
reports that, under cover of darkness, the prince is sending Donald
Cameron of Lochiel and his regiment round to the east, possibly to the
Netherbow Port which divides the city proper from the Canongate. This
would be a tricky manoeuvre, for it would mean passing undetected under
the castle's guns. But if it were to succeed, Edinburgh would be cut off
on three sides, and in touch on the fourth only with the soldiers at
Leith who have no stomach for a fight. Surrender could probably be just
a matter of time, and the prince would have won his race with Cope for
the capital.

NATIONAL Planting Week begins on September 24 and the popular poet Pam
Ayres, currently heard on Radio 2 each week with The Pam Ayres Radio
Show, has got into the spirit of things already by doing some planting
of her own.
Pam, who is a keen gardener, is seen here putting the finishing
touches to a hanging basket that will add colour to her patio throughout
the autumn and winter months.
She hopes her poem, below, will encourage everyone with a garden to
look for the hundreds of ways plants can make it look more colourful and
appealing during autumn and winter.
Don't think that it's the time of year
When gardens MUST look drab and drear,
When colours fade and blooms subside
And gardeners sadly go inside.
It's National Planting Week you see
When your local nursery
And garden centre offer you
Plants to glow the winter through!
Some you might not know about,
That flourish when the sun's NOT out,
Whose colours are a joy to see
When June's a distant memory
Don't leave your garden brown and tragic
Try a little Autumn Magic!
Pam Ayres

Body and Soul, The Diplomats of Jazz
* THIS privately-made recording of the excellent four-piece band
should be available at their Edinburgh regular residencies -- the Bank
Hotel (Thursday nights) and the Royal Ettrick Hotel (Sunday afternoons).
It's an impressive collection of 10 tracks from the Diplomats' favourite
jazz period -- the 1920s and 1930s. Jim Petrie's wistful cornet is
particularly well suited to the dark melody of Sweet Like This, while
the swinging clarinet of Jackie Graham is best featured on I Want A
Little Girl.
Ecklund at Elkhart, The Classic Jazz All-Stars (Jazzology)
* ACE cornettist Peter Ecklund's opening remark on this CD is: ''This
is gonna be great.'' And he's proved right -- unsurprisingly, since his
line-up features trombonist Dan Barrett, clarinettist Bobby Gordon,
pianist Mark Shane, and guitarist Marty Grosz. As ever with these guys,
there is not one standard among the 15 tracks which have been dug up
from old movies and revues. The highlights are many: the gorgeous and
melancholy Trees -- a weird and wonderful melody carried by Ecklund's
majestic cornet; the joyous (despite the title) Somebody Stole My Gal,
sung by Grosz; and the brooding Black Cat Moan, on which everyone
excels.

IT was back in the early eighties when I first came across the
guitarist Howard Alden, first on an album with cornettist Dick Sudhalter
in a tribute to Bix Beiderbecke, and then in really fast company on
another album dedicated to Hoagy Carmichael songs.
There was Alden still in his early twenties in a rhythm section with
pianist Nat Pierce and drummer Frankie Capp and supporting two
outstanding veterans, tenor saxophonist Eddie Miller and cornettist Wild
Bill Davison.
A dozen or so years on he has developed into one of the most
accomplished guitarists on the current jazz scene. Not only as a soloist
but as an arranger and also as an on-stage organiser as he demonstrated
during the Nairn Jazz Festival.
His move to New York just a little more than 10 years ago has helped
propel him to his present position as one of the most sought after
stylists in the jazz world.
His move to a seven-string guitar in l993 has added to his stature as
a soloist and jazz archivist, and Alden told me at Nairn how the switch
of instruments came about.
''I was able to lure George Van Eps out of retirement in February 1991
and we recorded together for Concord,'' recalled Alden. ''I had been
listening to records of George and what he did with his seven-string
instrument and it intrigued me.
'' Anyhow, I called George and initially he was not too keen to go
back into a recording studio at all. But I persevered and I heard from
mutual friends that he was warming to the idea and finally he agreed,
and we went into the studio and made our first album together,'' he
said.
That came out with the two master craftsmen supported by Jake Hanna on
drums and Dave Stone on bass and included a Van Eps original Queerology
along with a dozen timeless standards.
Four months later the quartet returned to the studio to make a second
album, this time with two tunes from Van Eps, Lap Piano and Forty-Eight
and by now Alden was realising that he would have to follow the old
master who had invented his seven-string guitar back in the thirties
around the time he was playing for Ray Noble.
Explained Alden: ''I just couldn't play the chord voicings I wanted
to, the kind George plays, without making the move. I tried out George's
guitar at his home one time and then I contacted Bob Benedetto, who
makes guitars for so many of the guys, and asked him to build a
seven-string model for me.
'' Once I had the guitar that was it! I haven't played anything else
since,'' he said.
Another CD for Concord followed with Alden and the 83-year-old Van Eps
both playing their seven-string instruments, and with another Van Eps
original being recorded, Salute to Basie.
''Now I have another project on the go with George, another album we
are set to make together and I have been playing with him at festivals
and it's been an education for me. You are playing with history when you
get up there with him.
''He has been around jazz since the twenties and he still plays
beautifully. I have some other guitar things, too, with a guy called
Jimmy Bruno and another New York guitar player Frank Vignola so I'm
keeping busy.''
That is as it should be. Alden has developed into a musician who can
compare to anyone around. He keeps good company at all times and his
albums -- all of them -- are imbued with a marvellous feel for jazz
history.
Where can you hear originals from the late Bud Freeman? Or almost
unknown tunes from The Lion? Or the songs penned by Van Eps over the
decades?
On Howard Alden CDs -- that's where! And long may that continue.

Ian Walls is persuaded by a garden centre that takes the high ground
on its subjects
* FEW nurseries or garden centres can trace their history back to
1335, but Joe McIndoe, who owns and runs the Mill Garden Centre at
Armadale, West Lothian, does just that.
Located at Barbauchlaw, which was in the 12th and 13th century
operated as a grain mill, Joe has transformed a hilly site into one of
the most attractive garden centres in the country since 1976 when he
took it over.
Apart from its history, what makes the mill really different is that,
in addition to the retail side, there is a concentrated wholesale
production section.
It produces a range of plants, for other garden centres, landscapers
and local authorities. To crown it all, there is a beautifully
landscaped garden adjacent to the McIndoe home, constantly being
revamped to make it still more attractive.
In addition to Joe, there is his wife, Dorothy, and two part-time
helpers. Joe is also busy in horticultural circles, being convener of
the nursery and glasshouse committee for the National Farmers' Union.
He is also chairman of a joint committee formed between the NFU and
the Horticultural Trades Association to look into the training and
future for young workers in the industry.
Armadale can be a bleak place, especially in the winter, at 660ft
above sea level, with the garden centre and nursery in a valley at
500ft. You can be sure any plants here will be hardy enough to grow
anywhere.
There is a magnificent range of conifers, shrubs and garden plants,
some of which are unique. Joe is a mine of information on plant species
and how to get the best out of them.
The centre can be difficult to find but when you get to Armadale, stop
and ask anyone -- they will tell you.
And for directions on cultivating pot plants, Andrew Duncan at his
garden centre in Milngavie provided some tips and discussed the sort of
problems customers meet.
''The most common trouble is over or under-watering. People don't
realise how much water a healthy pot plant can get through in a warm
home or conservatory,'' he said.
''The weight of pots is an excellent guide and so is using a moisture
meter. But, really, the best way is to immerse the whole pot in a basin
or bucket of water. If it bubbles, it is not fully watered.
''Yellowing of the lower leaves is a typical symptom of being
over-watered. The most common example of that is the geranium. It should
always be kept on the dry side.''
Here is Andrew's list of pot plants, with a few succinct comments.
African violet -- This is ideal for centrally-heated homes. Likes good
light, but not direct. Water by standing in saucers, filling with water,
and letting the plant take what it needs. Look for brilliant new
colours, which are now available.
Lilium -- There is an amazing demand for new lilies such as Stargazer
(pink and white) and the yellow Asiatic hybrids. After flowering, they
can be planted out.
Poinsettias -- Coloured bracts last really well in centrally-heated
homes. Look for outstanding new red colours. Keep in half light and give
plenty of water.
Foliage plants -- A wide range wich is ideal for a warm home. Most are
happy in indirect light. Water regularly.
Weeping figs -- Along with schefflera, are becoming very popular.
Several new varieties.
Begonias -- Rushing up the popularity polls. They like good light,
watered and fed regularly. Can last a long time. Begonia semperflorens
in summer bedding can be lifted, potted up with new compost and will
flower almost continuously.
Kalanchoe -- Must have adequate light to develop flowers. Once they do
flower, not so light-demanding. Need regular watering and feeding.
Pot mums -- Probably the biggest selling pot plant ever. Adequately
watered, will flower for six to eight weeks. Ideal in the home, except
for dull corners.
Busy Lizzies (impatiens) -- The New Guinea type is really only for
summer use. Others make ideal house plants under cool conditions. Must
be watered and fed regularly. Do particularly well in bathrooms.
Cyclamen -- Available now through to March. Like cool conditions,
watered and fed regularly. Better watered in saucers, from the base.
Dead flowers must be picked out, to prevent rotting.
Azaleas -- Coming into shops and garden centres now. Like to be kept
in a cool room and need plenty of water, daily without fail.
Plant arrangements -- Big sellers. May need renewal of odd plants at
times. Make ideal presents, at prices from #7:50 to #35 or even more.
Meanwhile, for planting shrubs, there is no better time than autumn.
Soils are invariably warm and moist. Shrubs can get established with a
minimum of bother.
Decide what you want to achieve. Rapid cover of a wall, pergola or
other feature? A hedge or barrier, for wind protection or privacy? Is it
simply to add colour at specific times of year?
Good garden centres group shrubs in categories, and coloured labels
tell you what you get for your money.
Check sizes. A diminutive specimen now could be a monster in a year or
two. Not only height matters, but root growth.
Here are a few suggestions for varieties.
To cover a north wall, try cotoneaster horizontalis or microphylla.
Something a bit more exotic could be hydrangea petiolaris which flowers
in summer.
For winter colour, there is jasminum nudiflorum, plus the pyracanthas
which have beautiful berries if the birds leave them alone.
There are several ornamental vines called vitis, for pergolas. And who
could forget polygonum baldschuanicum?
For south walls, there is an endless choice. I like ceanothus, or
magnolia. Roses are ideal for any aspect, and clematis montana is a
vigorous climber.
For hedging, it takes a lot to beat berberis, which is a good barrier
shrub too because of its prickles. Escallonia makes grand hedging,
particularly in coastal areas.
Another excellent hedging shrub often overlooked is fuchsia. I use it
to make my aluminium greenhouse look more attractive. Most fuchsias must
be cut back hard every spring, remember.
Many gardeners like rhododendron hedges. Even the common ponticum
variety will do. Remember flowering currants also. They can stand a lot
of trimming back and flower beautifully in the spring.

The Great Escape, Blur (Food)
* REAFFIRMING the power of perky pop as a vehicle for pithy protest,
The Great Escape is an awe-inspiring climax to the social-realist
triptych begun with Modern Life Is Rubbish. Surpassing all Blur's
obvious sixties influences -- Ray Davies, Small Faces, Syd Barrett, Burt
Bacharach -- sharp-eyed satirist Damon Albarn views the current rotten
state of Britco (1979) plc. He sees the dreariness and moral turpitude
of its suburbs; the false dawn of the Tory scratchcard ethic; corporate
chisellers; the commuter's daily grind; Friday-night High Street lager
loutishness. While Damon's judgment is predictable -- Britco (1979) plc
stinks -- his tone is refreshingly multi-faceted. Blur thus manage to be
both sardonic and whimsical; fey and sneering; evincing an undertow of
regret for the nature of the things they savage. Similarly, Blur cover
the waterfront from music hall to proto-metal, equally capable of
cranking out a hurdy-gurdy rockney knees-up or a poignant wide-screen
ballad. Pithy vignettes; incisive lyrical couplets; top tunes. A
blurring good album. In 1995, Britpop plc has never sounded so healthy.
Jazz Juice 3, various (Street Sounds)
* GLUG deep draughts of this stuff and you'll become the druid of
fluid, man. An assembly of cool and swinging Latinate jazz-salsa-funk
explorations crafted variously between 1963 and 1985. Groove to Tito
Puente's take on Take Five! Feel boss and soulful with Soul Bossa Nova
by Quincy Jones and his Orchestra! You may be moved sufficiently to
drive a Nova over your ova when the Billy Mitchell Quintet play Bossa
Nova Ova! Er . . . in other words, this is an eclectic blast.
The Peel Session, Syd Barrett (Strange Fruit)
* HOW to gauge the worth of long-extinguished Pink Floyd luminary Syd
Barrett in the light of his subsequent status as Britain's first
acid-casualty? Simply listen to Effervescing Elephant, one of only five
tracks Syd was able to record for the Peel prog in 1970, and you will
tearily glimpse his childlike free-form eerieness. Remember, kids: drugs
may well reveal the gates of God's heavenly kingdom, but then they snap
the key in the lock. As Syd would doubtless tell you himself today, if
only he could.
Circus, Lenny Kravitz (Virgin)
* BEWARE! Led Zep-obsessed man in jumbo-cord loon pants shouting
''Rock and roll is dead!'' We knew, Lenny, we knew. What we didn't know,
as is revealed by a photograph on this album's inner sleeve, is that
Lenny has dreadlocked pubes. Git outta here, ya clown!
Flagman Ahead, the Tab Two (Virgin)
* A GROOVY, insistently-floaty jazz-house-rap dancefloor hybrid aus
Ulm, in Deutschland. The fab Tab Two are Hellmut Hattler and Joo Kraus,
a duo who have plainly listened and learnt with Miles Davis. If last
year you bought and loved Brooklyn Funk Essentials' wondrous Cool And
Steady And Easy, here's another storming treat for you. The Tab Two:
unflagging enjoyment for head and feet.
DAVID BELCHER
Tamburello, Peter King (Miles Music)
* BEST known as a lucid keeper of Charlie Parker's alto saxophone
flame, King features here in impressively expansive mood, easing both
alto and soprano through arrangements of Purcell, Gershwin and Bartok,
confident ballads as well as his own blazingly emotional tribute to
racing driver Ayrton Senna, the scene of whose death the title refers
to.
Monkjack, Jack Bruce (CMP)
* SUPPORTED by his own concise piano playing and Bernie Worrell's
apposite Hammond organ, Bruce showcases his magnificent voice across the
full range of expression from roaring, pleading blues to the nigh on
hymnal. The aptly titled Tightrope is a typically fearless performance
from an artist who has never been afraid to take risks, which this time
pay off handsomely.
Threads, Battlefield Band (Temple)
* BATTLEFIELD'S second album since 1990's major personnel upheaval is
a work of consolidation rather than exploration, once again featuring a
thoughtful blend of traditional and electric instruments. The tunes
range from atmospheric to sprightly and are never less than enjoyable,
but the songs, addressing traditional as well as current state of the
nation themes, suffer from a lack of real strength and character in the
vocal delivery.
Live, Bill Frisell Trio (Gramavision)
* GUITARIST Frisell, bass guitarist Kermit Driscoll and drummer Joey
Baron take telepathy to new heights as they rip through a hectic,
pan-American pot-pourri of musical styles from be-bop to bluegrass and
back, in the midst of which collective understanding are moments of
sheer individual magic. These 11 pieces demand and repay attention, even
if at 71 minutes it's a slightly gruelling experience.

Liz Taylor visits the town of white gold and finds that the crossed
swords still guard their wares most jealously.
LEADING his party of tourists in Meissen, the guide explained: ''We
call this town the Sleeping Beauty.'' It is well named for it is a very
quiet, old-world little township of 32,000 people, 16 miles from
Dresden. Fortunately the devastation that was visited on Dresden in
February 1945, and which is still visible there, missed it completely.
Today Meissen's Hansel and Gretel houses, shabby and paint peeling but
with window boxes spilling geraniums and petunias, cluster around the
flanks of a fairy-tale castle perched high on a rock overlooking the
River Elbe in the part of Germany that used to belong to the GDR.
There is no outward indication that this is the town of ''white
gold'', the place where the finest and most expensive European porcelain
has been made, and jealously guarded, since the early eighteenth
century.
Still today millionaires aspire to own Meissen pieces, to eat off
Meissen plates. In October Sotheby's are holding a sale of the
possessions of the Grand Duke of Baden-Baden in which one of the prize
lots is a 47-piece Meissen tea and coffee service which is expected to
sell for at least #50,000.
In 1710, August the Strong, Elector of Saxony, who had been employing
necromancers and alchemists to find the secret of changing base metal
into gold, suddenly switched his interest to the making of porcelain and
inadvertently discovered the formula for making, if not pure gold, at
least a great deal of money.
For many years European pottery makers had been trying to work out how
the Chinese made the highly coveted porcelain which was imported in
large quantities from the East. The first manufactory of porcelain in
Europe would be able to cash in on an enormous demand for fine pottery.
August employed a man called J F Boettger who experimented mixing
kaolin, which is mined near Meissen, with clay until he hit on a formula
for making fine, white hard paste porcelain. In 1710 the Royal Porcelain
Manufactory was founded and set up in Meissen's Albrecht fortress which
could be guarded against intrusion by industrial spies from other places
intent on finding out Boettger's secret formula.
August also devised the Meissen trademark, the crossed blue swords
which still mark every genuine piece. The factory remained in the castle
until the late nineteenth century when it moved into its present
premises on the edge of the town. The company is still owned by the
state of Saxony.
To this day Meissen guards its patterns, its trademark, and its wares
most jealously. Once a year there is a day of great ceremony when
Meissen forgeries, which enterprising copyists started making almost
from the day of the factory's foundation, are gathered in from all over
the world and ceremonially thrown from a high window in the factory to
smash to pieces on the ground below. In the magnificent museum of
Meissen ware on the top two floors of the factory, a small section is
set aside to show some of the more successful forgeries but they are
housed in a little cupboard and displayed almost reluctantly.
In recent years the Meissen factory has experienced a drop in sales to
its top customers, the USA and Japan, but with the injection of fresh
money from Western Germany, they are fighting back to regain lost
markets. During the days of the GDR, almost 2000 people were employed in
the porcelain factory but the workforce has now been cut to just over
900.
Visitors are given a comprehensive tour of the factory which boasts a
huge window painted with the Meissen trademark showing how it has
changed -- only minutely -- over the centuries, and a wonderful ceiling
painted with a pastoral scene above a double staircase that is flanked
by china candelabras almost 12ft tall and decorated with characteristic
Meissen swathes of flowers and fruit.
The emphasis is on quality -- pure gold is used for gilding and more
than 75% of the work is done by hand. Even the blue crossed-swords
trademark is hand-painted on each piece by a ''sworder''. Visitors can
watch modellers, who are called ''repairers'', painstakingly building up
roses and rosebuds, potters throwing shapes, and artists tracing designs
on plates. The factory has its own art school where children as young as
five or six are taught to draw and paint. The most promising of them go
on to work for the factory.
The greatest pleasure in visiting Meissen, however, is to browse
through the museum. Nowhere in the world can there be a better
collection of beautiful procelain painted by some of the best-known
artists throughout the centuries . . . grinning Chinamen by Horoldt; a
comical nobleman wearing glasses riding on a goat, also wearing the same
sort of glasses, which was the work of the great Kaendler in 1737.
The factory has not contented itself with continually turning out
traditional designs and the work of young artists is on display among
the famous names from the past. One modern piece that caught the eye was
a lady with a hat, designed by Sylvia Klode in 1991.
The standard set is incredibly high. Nothing but perfection is
accepted, and prices reflect this quality. In the shop adjoining the
factory visitors can buy a tiny painted pillbox for the Deutschmark
equivalent of about #140, a candlestick for over #800, and a beautiful
coffee pot for #6300. There are a few seconds -- very few -- and the
cheapest of these, a little figurine, cost #55.
So don't go to Meissen hoping to pick up a bargain or you are sure to
be disappointed. Go to admire, to wonder and come away astonished that
so many beautiful things have been collected in one place.
MARKET NEWS
* I HAVE to eat my words about Wemyss Ware. At Sotheby's sale in
Gleneagles last month, a sleeping piglet painted with thistles was
sufficiently admired by a UK collector to fetch the record price of
#8625. The estimate was between #1000 and #1500 which shows that
Sotheby's were as surprised as I was. Their explanation for the
unexpected popularity of the piece was: ''It's very rare to get a
sleeping piglet''.

* FROM an isolated farm cottage in Ormiston, East Lothian, Michael
McManus turns out unusual wood sculptures and original works of art in
native hardwood that are now much sought after as collector's items.
Most of Mike's pieces can be displayed indoors or outside as he uses
tong oil to treat them, rather than wax.
Like the tree-trunk figure pictured left, his pieces are unique; but
one theme Mike which has become his trademark is a large leaf shape made
of burr elm (example above). The underside of the leaf retains the burrs
and scarbrous growth from the outside of the tree. In contrast, the
topside of the platter is carved to an unbelievable delicacy, complete
with natural, almost lace-like holes.
* Small Michael McManus pieces can be seen at the Scottish Craft
Centre, Princes Square, Glasgow. Larger commissions -- Tynemount Farm
Cottage, Ormiston, East Lothian (01875 614202).

LINDEN HALL
Northumbria
17th century magnificence
Linden Hall Hotel and North Northumbria.
You could easily spend a couple of days at Linden Hall, not far from
Morpeth, without ever wanting to leave the house and grounds. The hotel
has beautiful gardens, with a conservatory full of plants and warm
enough for sitting in far into the winter months. Many spend a whole day
in the health spa, with its myriad health and beauty treatments, plus
sauna, and sunbeds. But at seven o'clock in the morning, the indoor pool
was my ideal place to start the day. This is no mere plunge pool but a
stretch of water for proper swimming. With plenty to do already, any
reluctance to leave the hotel grounds will become even stronger when the
new golf course, at present being built in a semi-circle around the
hotel, is complete in 1997.
Yet Linden Hall is no over-modern complex, all glass and bright
lights. The lovely Georgian building,with its stable block and
courtyard, was long a private home. It was built in 1812 by William
Biggs, a wealthy banker and member of the Biggs family who had lived in
Northumbria since the 17th century. The architect was Sir Charles Monck,
steeped in the wide-ranging, classical education of the time. He also
became MP for Northumberland, with a habit of speaking Greek in
Parliament when appropriate!
In the years since, Linden Hall has belonged to only four families.
who have all left their mark and, looking closely, I could make out the
initials CWB 1813 underneath the first stone step of the main staircase
in the Inner Hall. It commemorates the Biggs' move to Linden Hall.
But exploring the area is always part of the interest of a weekend
away. The hotel is close to Long Horsley, near the River Coquet, and
this part of Northumbria is very beautiful. My favourite route south is
via the A68, leading off the Edinburgh by-pass, over Soutra Hill to the
A697, at Carfraemill. The road then travels through some lovely Border
country, skirting the Cheviot Hills. Over the border, the Northumbrian
roads are fascinating, not as high as the Border hills but rolling up
and down in great dips, with the sudden sign hidden dip. That means that
just as you get to the foot of a hill, or what seems to be the foot, it
dips again.
Like its neighbour to the north, this was good fighting country, with
skirmishes and battles that did not always divide into English versus
Scots contests but, as often, were cross-border disputes between the
great families of Percy (everything seems to have a Percy connection in
Northumbria) Douglas, Scott, Elliot, Armstrong, Nickson, and the like.
No wonder there are so many castles, towers and now mansions, many in
the care of the National Trust, and my first visit, to Wallington Hall,
in Cambo west of the hotel, bore out the warring past. Its fine, inner
hall is lined with frescoes of Northumbrian history, with one panel
depicting the celebrated 'Chevvy (Cheviot) Chase' in which the heads of
both the Percy and Douglas families were slain. This featured again
later in the day at Alnwick Castle. Two of Wallington's best exhbitions
are its Dolls' House collection, magnificent miniatures no child would
dare to play with, and the 1900s kitchen, with the earliest washing
machine I have ever seen -- a hand rotated water-filled drum below a
huge, old mangle.
The road north to Rothbury and Alnwick skirts Harwood forest and the
hills, and some visitors come to Linden Hall for the walking in this
area. Not far away is the old Roman Road, which strides north through
the Borders. Just outside Rothbury is another National Trust house,
Cragside, built by the Victorian industrialist, Lord Armstrong. Alas,
the house was closed that day but the grounds are 1000 acres of ponds,
lakes and burns. Both houses are open to end-October. From Cragside, the
road over the hills to Alnwick was even more magnificent, with great
views.
Alnwick Castle, the home of the Duke of Northumberland (a Percy), is
very grand, its great battlements standing on a wide sweep of grass. One
of Alnwick's charms is the fact that it is still a home, with many
family photographs on small tables. It is closed for six months from
mid-October, when the guard rails and special exhibitions disappear, the
carpet returns to the great dining room, and the family moves in. That
gives this ancient castle a special, inexplicable but fascinating
atmosphere. From Alnwick, there was just time to head north for
Chillingham Castle, where the famous white cattle in the park, are the
sole survivorts of the wild herds that once roamed free.
Linden Hall is well known for its cuisine, and people from the area
regularly join hotel guests for a superb dinner. That night we ate
smoked Craster salmon, then duck delicately flavoured with tarragon,
after a mental tussle between that and chicken with king prawns and
Champagne cream, all very luscious. Yet the simple homemade sorbet that
came between the two was also delicious. It came as a surprise that
Linden Hall has its own pub, the Linden pub, in a converted old barn and
loft. There is a sheltered garden, warm enough to sit out quite late in
the season, with boules and a king-size outdoor chess board. Owned by
the hotel, it is run separately, and has good pub food for a night or
lunch 'out'.
Having looked at inland Northumbria, I then turned east for the coast,
a wonderful coast of islands, river mouths, rocks and sand, with masses
of birds, breeding there in summer and wintering birds from the autumn.
The coast road is specially signed and offers castles -- starting with
Warkwork, which dominates the town below. Further north, inland from
Beadnel, the pele tower, Preston Towre, has walls seven feet thick. From
Beanel the road lies along the sea, running through Seahouses, the
jumping off point for the Farne Islands with huge gatherings of
seabirds, and a grey seal colony over 30 islands. It is possible to land
on two. There are glimpses of old fortified ruins on the cliffs and 18th
century Bamburgh Castle springs up ahead, its great bulk some 100ft
above the cliffs. It has a splendid collection of arms, and is open to
the end of October.
Just north of here, I was unlucky enough to mistime the tides for the
causeway to Holy Island, but I had known it earlier, with Lindisfarne,
its ruined Benedictine priory, founded in 635AD by St Aidan, whose
statue stands on the island. There is also the mid 16th century
Lindisfarne Castle, and many bird species -- the first place I ever saw
a long-eared owl!
By now, the main coast road had turned inland for the A1 and
Berwick-on-Tweed, which feels as though it should be on the Scots side
of the border -- a fine, walled town with much still standing. It had
been a great two days. Next time at Linden Hall, I would happily make it
a week.

THE HERALD HOME FOR TODAY
* HARRY Gaughan's daughter is four-months old and so far her Dad
admits that he doesn't know what she looks like with her eyes open.
Gaughan has another ''baby'' right now which is even more demanding of
his time and energy as a site manager for CALA Homes; supervising The
Herald Home for Today being built near Dullatur in Cumbernauld.
The house-building challenge of the decade was initially conceived
over two years ago, when Marley Buiding Materials gave UK architects a
competition brief to design a house for the future using existing
technology and traditional materials. It then went one stage further,
when the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland suggested the
winning house be built. CALA Homes stepped in as joint sponsor and
builder, The Herald agreed to ''adopt'' it -- and winning architect
Andrew Kenyon from Bristol should see his design come to fruition in
November.
Although Kenyon's design meets the competition brief, the building
reality has been somewhat more complex. ''Because it's a prototype,
everything in the house has had to be constructed as a one-off,''
explains Gaughan. ''Nothing in the design is standard and because the
specifications have called for different sizes, shapes and materials,
all of the suppliers involved have had to make moulds and jigs to
produce one-off products. This is time consuming and expensive.''
Gaughan has been closely working with the brick-laying sub-contractor,
Jim Gilfillan. Both admit they are on a learning curve as each phase is
completed. Every trade represented on site will be involved and they are
all in the same position; this house has never been built before -- and
will probably never be built again. To date the superstructure is almost
finished and the roof is ready to go on. Even this has been hand built.
''There are only three pre-fabricated trusses and three glu-lam beams in
the roof,'' says Gaughan. ''After that, comes the plumbing and
electrical roughing which will bring its own difficulties given that the
flooring throughout is concrete. Everything has to be concealed and as
the concrete floors have already been laid , all the pipes and wiring
will have to be dropped down through the cavity walls to precisely the
right position.'' With all its inherent problems, CALA have delegated
the right man to the job; Gaughan won the NHBC's top award in Scotland
last year and is in the top 10 again for this year's accolade which is
open only to site managers.
The Herald Home for Today is both energy efficient and environmentally
friendly. Kenyon's design is based on a central conservatory which will
draw in solar energy through a glass roof fitted with a thermostatically
controlled automatic ventilation system. Down one side of the
conservatory is three bedrooms (one with en-suite bathroom), and the
family bathroom; bordering the other side of the conservatory, is the
living/dining room, kitchen, store and utility room. A glass-fronted
passage links the apartments on either side of the conservatory. The
garage has been designed to allow easy conversion into a study or extra
living space if required, and parking will accommodate up to four cars.
CALA made an apt choice in deciding to build this home within their
Eaglerise development of 49, three and four-bedroom bungalows and four
and five-bedroom villas, all of which have different external finishes.
Eaglerise sits on high ground overlooking the Westerwood Golf and
Country Club and is within minutes of Westerwood's luxury hotel.
House prices at Eaglerise start at #125,000 but so far, CALA have not
announced a price for The Herald Home for Today. Because it is a
one-off, the true cost is likely to be very high, but with completion
now expected in November, whoever buys it will have a unique home, at a
unique price.

Catherine Brown finds happy chickens under a cloudless sky.
ONE thing about the boiled egg on my plate is that I've just collected
it from the henhouse where it was laid. So at least it's fresh. Another
thing is that I know now what a henhouse with a couple of thousand
cackling hens feels like.
Herded together under one roof, but able to move about, scratch, flap
their wings -- peck my feet -- and go off to a nesting box to lay an
egg, a few had even gone outside to roll about in the earth and peck the
green grass under a blue sky. Lucky them.
They are among the 16% of the 32 million hens in the UK which are not
confined to a cage. Their ''barn'' type henhouse is on a small farm at
Inchinnan, just outside Glasgow, known as The Brown Egg Farm, where
Grant and May Montgomery run a farm shop selling their own-grown
produce, and where they also have a farmyard of rare breeds of sheep and
pigs in pens, plus a few extra-lucky hens who run around in total
freedom.
''We took down our battery-cage system about five years ago because it
did not fit in with what we do here,'' said Grant Montgomery. ''We are a
very small, working farm with around a thousand customers a week who
come to buy a tray of a dozen eggs, and bring their children to see our
animals.''
They have recently won a poultry award for the high quality of their
eggs. Their hens are a new, more docile breed, which have caused less
fighting. I searched among them for signs of battered victims, but could
find none. Farms like this may not be on everyone's doorstep, but the
opportunity to choose the welfare system used for the hen producing the
egg on your plate, has recently taken a new turn. From now on the Co-op
have made it possible to identify all eggs from battery hens with their
''Intensively Reared'' label.
Launched this summer as part of their ''Responsible Retailing''
campaign, it has created a stir in the industry by labelling more
honestly one of the less palatable food industry facts. But the Co-op
had, after all, had its beginnings in a revolt by the Rochdale Pioneers
who set up shop in 1844 in response to adulteration and false weighing
in the food industry.
Their current campaign has been launched on the basis of a survey of
30,000 consumers and Co-op members where 71% claimed that retailers had
a responsibility to ensure that animals were treated humanely. The egg
industry is fond of carrying a ''country/farm fresh'' message on eggs
which have come from reared-in-cages hens. The Co-op have put an end to
this nonsense and all their eggs will show clearly the method of hen
management. It's a bold move.
Especially in the face of Government opposition which claims their new
labelling is ''both inaccurate and emotive''. What the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) suggests as a better description,
is ''eggs from caged hens''.
''Technically,'' says a spokesman for the Co-op, ''there is no
provision at present in the EU to allow for the honest labelling of
battery eggs. But we will continue to do so.''
At a meeting between the egg producers, MAFF and the Co-op, it was
agreed that provision to label battery eggs would now be requested from
the EU. Not just pioneering more information on egg origins, The Co-op
were also the first major multiple to take up the RSPCA scheme about a
year ago, identifying products from high animal welfare systems. Eggs
which carry the ''Freedom Food'' label are from free range or barn
systems inspected independently by the RSPCA. So far, among the major
multiples, only Tesco has taken up the Freedom Foods scheme.
The other current egg-labelling issue is the loophole which has been
discovered in EU legislation which allows imported eggs to be packed in
the UK and sold as if they were home-produced.
Look for the British lion stamp on the box -- otherwise it's possible
that the packing station address, even a Scottish one, may not guarantee
that the egg was laid by a hen in Scotland.

WHILE the hot weather scorched the land in July and August, undersea
fish and shellfish were quietly feeding and growing.
Now is harvest time.
Mussels, scallops and oysters are superb quality and in plentiful
supply this month, says Scottish Shellfish Marketing Group's spokesman,
Philip Marshall.
And they will get richer in meat content as the season progresses, but
avoid scallops in November when they spawn.
His group sells only scallops in the shell, though the muscle and roe
may also be removed and sold separately.
To prevent them drying out, the scallops may be soaked in water, and
will therefore containing a percentage of water.
''Soaked'' scallops are likely to have considerably less flavour than
those ''unsoaked'' or live in the shell and should also be cheaper.

Ian Anderson lives mostly in Wiltshire with his wife, Shona and
children James and Gael. His career as a musician with the band Jethro
Tull continues unabated for 27 years.
* AS a rake-thin nipper growing up in Edinburgh I could afford a sweet
tooth. Even well into teenage, I would shift sticky puds with never so
much as an ungainly pound to show for it.
Then, in the summer of '66 came the awesome realisation: the
mysterious delights of Vindaloos and Madras were more than a match for
the occasional cravings of sweet youth.
Now, as a tending-to-bloom 48-year-old, I have to watch the calories
and my visits to the local emporium of take-away sensations are down to
once a week.
So, a little analytical research has found me coming to terms with the
need to strike an acceptable balance as regards spice versus nice. A
nice bod and acceptable breath do not come easy when the chillies and
garlic, coriander and cumin combine with the dangerous desire to consume
whole carcasses in a single sitting.
Thus I have become a sort of reformed occasional meat-eating
vegetarian fish lover. I have become that most insidious of denizens of
the kitchen deeps: the menopausal male, cook-for-himself, apron-toting
invader of the province of wifely superiority.
Of course my wife Shona is a far better cook than I would ever be.But
she puts up with my oat bran in the morning, lo-cal soup and salad
lunchette and even tolerates my occasional blow-outs of fresh chili and
spice adulterated lobster tails. All washed down with a little iced
whisky of the cheapest blend.

OUR magnificent summer is fast becoming a distant memory as the depths
of winter loom.
One of the hotels offering Herald readers the opportunity to fully
charge batteries for the months of head -- via luxury breaks at special
prices -- is the Marine Highland in Ayrshire.
Four star, five Crowns, it overlooks the majestic 18th fairway of
Royal Troon golf course, a British Open classic venue.
Only 45 minutes from Glasgow, and 100 minutes from Edinburgh, the
hotel has breathtaking views across the Firth of Clyde to the Isle of
Arran.
The hotel has long enjoyed a well deserved reputation at home and
abroad, boasting award winning food and wines; rooms equipped to high
standard, and one of the finest health and fitness clubs in the area,
including 50ft-long swimming pool.
It is steeped in tradition. But behind the grandeur, let alone pomp
and circumstance within the imposing, sprawling castle-style property,
is an informality that puts every visitor, young or old, at ease.
On an impromptu visit, one of the greatest pleasures was the welcome
given to children from staff who are more used to rubbing shoulders with
the rich and famous, including members of the Scottish football team and
the golfing superstars whose portraits adorn many of the walls.
At any hotel, a key to ''rip off'' time for those with family in tow
can be the charges made for youngsters' basic pleasures such as cokes
and ice cream.
The Marine Highland's Continental-style Crosbie's brasserie, where
adults are offered an interesting range of snacks or meals in pleasant
surroundings, passed the test -- offering a wide, good value children's
menu plus refreshing, non-alcohol cocktails at 75p-#1.
Even finer cuisine is to be found in the more sophisticated Fairways
restaurant, which overlooks Royal Troon golf course, and where more
formal attire is expected at dinner and No Smoking is allowed until
10pm.
The cooking can be described as classical, although many dishes have
been given a modern interpretation by executive chef Richard Sturgeon. A
four course dinner with coffee and chocolate truffles, and offering
around seven choices of dessert, costs #22-a-head. House wines are
#9.75, while the list for connoisseurs takes in produce from, to name
but a few, Australia, California, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and
South Africa.
The hotel is a golfers' paradise, within easy distance of 20 courses.
But there are dozens of other attractions -- including Culzean Castle;
Kelburn Country Centre; the Robert Burns visitor centre, and Scottish
Maritime Centre.
lo Yachting, clay pigeon shooting, archery, even flying lessons, are
also available, and the hotel also has access to fishing.
However, there is no need to leave the premises to unwind and relax,
with the heated indoor swimming pool a popular attraction.
The health and fitness club, with fully equipped gymnasium and
instruction, includes squash courts, spa, sauna, steam room, and solaria
with fast tan bed.
The hotel has four bars, including the elegant L'Aperitif and Arran
Lounge with a selection of malts that ensure ''Highland'' hospitality
can be maintained to high standard.
All 72 bedrooms, ranging from single to suites and catering for a
total 128 guests, have private bathrooms, satellite TV, trouser press,
hairdryer, and tea and coffe tray.
Many overlook the Firth and the 18th fairway, which is flanked by a
long sandy beach. At low tide, the beach has super rock pools for
exploring, offering hours of fun. At high tide, it guarantees bracing
walks -- ideal for blowing away the cobwebs and any stresses or strains.

Brambling brings its own rewards, says Lady Claire Macdonald, dispite
the risk to life and limb.
This is a subject which brings out the worst in me. I like to think
I'm not a particularly mean-spirited person, but when blackberries, or
brambles, are at issue I am extremely nasty. I become territorial, and
almost snarl if I meet anyone up in the forestry track behind Kinloch
picking brambles on what I consider ''my'' patch.
I am quite sure that a passion for brambling is hereditory. My mother
is an ardent brambler too. Luckily for me Godfrey also enjoys our
brambling sessions.
Part of the attraction of the ''sport'' might possibly come from the
danger involved. Anyone who is an avid brambler will know immediately
what I mean. But to the others I should explain that the best brambles
grow in the most impossible and inaccessible places. And such is their
glistening lure that they are irresistible.
The day will surely come when I slip into a ravine, ripping my clothes
and self alike on vicious bramble thorns in my descent. But as yet, with
some 47 brambling autumns under my belt, I haven't yet had such an
accident. I creep gingerly down vertical rock-strewn paths, my toes
clenched in my wellies, and stretching to reach the brambles in an
arm-lengthening way that would have Jane Fonda jealous at my prowess.
Brambles are delicious, and can be made into any number of delicious
puds ranging from the everyday pie or crumble, via the rather more
elaborate Sunday-lunch worthy Meringue Bramble pie, to the positively
elegant party pudding, like creamy mousses, iced creams, sorbets,
suedoise covered in whipped cream and studded with tiny vanilla
meringues. A cinnamon-flavoured pavlova with brambles folded into
whipped cream piled on top is delicious, or a nutty -- for my preference
a toasted almond -- meringue cake filled with brambles in whipped cream.
You can spin out the pleasures of eating your hard-gotten gains by
freezing the brambles. They freeze extremely well, just packed into poly
bags.
When I cook them I put them into a saucepan over a moderate heat --
with no extra water -- just until their juices seep out of them. But
what just about every recipe I can think of benefits from is lemon -- it
enhances the flavour of the brambles immeasurably. Wash the lemon well
under running hot water, to remove the preservative with which they are
sprayed, dry it, then grate it finely into the pan with the brambles as
they cook.
You can dissolve gelatine in the lemon juice if you are making a
mousse, or the parfait in today's recipe, which is just a slightly
different mousse made with crushed brambles and the sugar content
whisked into the whites, as for making meringue. The result is a much
more mallow-textured pudding, and very effective with its purple streaks
rather than the more uniformly coloured mousse for which I liquidise
then sieve the cooked fruit to get a smooth puree.
A sieved bramble puree makes a very good sauce as a substitute for
whipped cream.
One of the most luxurious of all things made with brambles is bramble
jelly. This, if you can make enough, makes very good small presents. But
I think it is essential to use a great deal of lemon juice (not grated
rind) in the making of bramble jelly, otherwise it can be on the sickly
side. Also, it is vital to make the jelly using fruit which is as
freshly picked as is possible, and use some under-ripe berries, too.
This ensures that you reach a set in the minimum boiling time, which
also vastly improves the flavour of the jelly -- it tends to taste
caramelly if it has to boil for a length of time.
Bramble and lemon Parfait
Serves 6-8
1[1/2]lbs brambles
grated rind of lemon
juice of 1 lemon
4 large eggs, whites only
8oz caster sugar
[1/2] pint double cream, whipped but not too stiffly
1 sachet ([1/2]oz) gelatine
Put the brambles and lemon rind into a saucepan over gentle heat, and
add the lemon juice. Cook very gently until the juices run from the
brambles. Take the pan off the heat, strain the brambles from the juices
-- I use a slotted spoon for this -- and sprinkle the gelatine into the
hot juice. Shake the pan gently over heat -- take care not to let the
liquid boil -- until the gelatine granules have dissolved completely.
Then put the brambles back into the liquid and crush them with the back
of a wooden spoon.
Cool completely, you can hurry this process by putting the pan into a
bowl of cold water with some ice cubes, but stir the contents of the pan
to prevent the gelatine setting on the bottom of the pan.
In a bowl whisk the whites until stiff, then, whisking continuously
add the sugar gradually, a spoonful at a time and whisking well between
each. With the same unwashed whisks, whisk the cream.
Fold the gelling bramble and lemon mixture into the whipped cream
then, with a large metal spoon, fold the meringue mixture into this.
Pour into a glass bowl -- because it looks best in glass or crystal.
Leave it streaky, don't try to fold everything completely thoroughly.
That also negates any garnishing -- it looks pretty enough as it is.

Dark continent? Not when you get an eyeful of these colourful fabrics.
BRIAR WILLIAMS reports
* AFTER the dominance of Mediterranean and Indian influences in
interiors comes . . . the African style. Strong designs feature
abstracts, colour blocks and stylised figures.
Genuine African-made fabrics can be hard to get hold of, but
fortunately many fabric houses have produced their own modified
versions.
Sanderson has applied its creative minds to adapting traditional
styles. Ethnic, a new design from the exciting Quartet collection,
claims African tribes as its inspiration. It offers block-printed
wallpapers and fabrics and intricate geometric weaves. Colours are
strong and natural, such as ochre, terracotta and charcoal.
Weaves are priced at #27.50 for 145cm wide; cottons #16.95 for 137cm
wide; wallpapers are #15.50 a roll and borders from #9.95 to #12.95.
Both are made from 100% cotton.
Kings Fabrics stocks African-style batik prints of the kind commonly
produced in Kenya. Although too lightweight for upholstery, their strong
colours and lively patterns are perfect for airy summer curtains. Made
from 100% cotton, the batiks cost #2.98 a yard.
If you'd prefer the real thing, Cold Comfort Farm in Zimbabwe produces
woven tapestries. The weaving group is part of a co-operative society
which hand-spins the wool and dyes it, using colours extracted from
indigenous plants. They produce more than 60 designs, each interpreted
by the weaver who will vary colour and materials.
Cold Comfort Farm's tapestries are currently on display at Out Of
Africa in Edinburgh's St Stephen Street, and at the Tolquhon Gallery in
Ellon. Each piece is individually priced, according to the work
involved, which may take from a few weeks to a month to complete.
Also from Cold Comfort are Shona stone carvings, produced by a people
purported to be the legendary guardians of King Solomon's mines. The
work is influenced by the Shona belief that the final carving is shaped
by the nature of the rock's spirit essence and features mainly stylised
figures, many with irresistibly sad expressions.

* THE subject for discussion, this week, is bras. (Reader's problems
in this area is being dealt with elsewhere.) We all wear one. Only the
reckless go bra-less. Even Olympic Gold Medallist Sally Gunnell, MBE,
the Penelope Pitstop of the 400m hurdle, who has not breasts but
muscles, has allied herself with Berlei manufacturers to promote their
sports bra.
The thrust, if you pardon the expression, of the sports bra is to
delay ''long-term sagging''. Berlei want to eliminate the bounce, and
have delivered this in the form of a revolutionary example of brassiere
engineering.
Berlei researched what happened to the nude breast when 20 women with
different bust and cup sizes were video-taped running on a treadmill set
at speeds of up to 12km per hour. They wore no bra, their ordinary bra,
and a sports bra. The tape was then analysed frame by frame, by
computer, and it was probably then decided that a Shock Absorber was in
order. The Berlei Shock Asorber reduces breast movement, because the
only way your bust is not going to undulate is if it is absolutely
compressed to the chest. Not so much foot-binding as breast-binding.
The public in general trust Sally Gunnell, she seems genuine. So much
so that this fan went out and bought six months' supply of Quorn when
she appeared in the ad on the telly. If it's good enough for Sally
Gunnell, I said to the supermarket assistant, then it's good enough for
me. I shall be buying a bra too, to inspire me to keep fit.
Did you know?
* Ten million women exercise regularly.
* Less than one million sports bras are sold each year.
* Of the women that exercise, 77% do not wear a sports bra and 19%
wear no bra at all.
* Also 43% claimed they did not need the support, and 34% claimed they
did not do enough exercise to justify the purchase of a sports bra.
Keeping abreast of the times
* Can underwired bras damage your health?
No, 50% of bra sales are underwired. Only an ill-fitting bra will
cause backache, neck and shoulder problems.
An underwired bra is safe, unless, of course, it is being twisted
around your neck by the neighbourhood psycho.
* How will I know if I'm wearing the correct bra size?
If your bra barely covers your nipples, it is too small. If there's
room for the messages, it's too big.
* Will exercise stop my breasts from sagging?
No. Like a useless man, a breast is made up of fat which cannot
support itself.
* As a 38DD, soon to be married, I am discovering it is difficult to
find beautiful bridal lingerie that will give me the support I need and
complement my dress.
I'm not surprised you're getting married soon with your shape. I bet
he couldn't propose quick enough. Anne Summers cater for breast
outsizes.
* How do I care for my bra?
Always handwash. Never tumble dry. Bleach when grey. But I think it's
kind of mean, to only have one, especially when entertaining.

For 150 years, it has been a bastion of confident bourgeois
aspirations. Now, says Lesley Duncan, Glasgow Academy is squaring up to
the challenges of the 21st century.
ONE point should perhaps be cleared up first. Glasgow Academy does not
insist on a mandatory ''The'' in its title, unlike its Edinburgh
equivalent. ''The majority of folk, even academicals, would call it
Glasgow Academy,'' says the rector, David Comins. ''We're a bit relaxed
about it.'' Comins, an Englishman and mathematician by background, is
only the eighth rector in the school's 150-year history.
One-hundred-and-fiftieth birthdays tend to generate such statistics as
well as a host of celebratory events. In the case of the Academy the
latter reached a climax yesterday with the official opening of the new
music school (by former rector Colin Turner) at lunchtime and a civic
reception in the City Chambers in the evening.
The classical stone building set back from Great Western Road at
Kelvinbridge is one of the West End's landmarks, engulfed in greenery in
the summer months. It's surprising to find that it wasn't the school's
first home. That was in Elmbank Street and the building was taken over
by Glasgow High School when the Academy moved west in 1878.
At last night's party in Glasgow's City Chambers, more surprises would
have been in store for anyone unfamiliar with recent developments at the
Academy. Among the pupils and immediate former pupils present were girls
as well as boys. For the Academy has pursued a similar path to that of
many former one-sex schools. It has been for the last four years a
co-educational establishment since its merger with Westbourne School for
Girls. Sartorially this has meant the introduction of a purple element
into the academy's traditional blue tie and crest. The motto remains the
same -- Serva fidem (Keep the faith).
The Academy has been keeping the faith with generations of pupils
since its creation in 1845, in the wake of the Disruption, by a group of
businessmen and Free Church clergymen intent on establishing a school to
meet the educational and spiritual needs of their city in a time of
rapid expansion. From the beginning, the Academy prepared its young men
for university, the professions, and business, as well as the wider
needs of the community.
As the West of Scotland's oldest independent school, it has always
seemed a bastion of confident, bourgeois aspirations. More than 90% of
its pupils currently go on to study degree courses at college or
university.
The roll-call of distinguished former pupils of the past is an
impressive one, encompassing politicians, judges, moderators of general
assemblies of the established and free churches, and prominent academics
and industrialists. Individual names to conjure with include Sir William
Ramsay, Nobel prize winner and discoverer of argon and other gases; that
suave entertainer Jack Buchanan; aviation pioneer Jim Mollinson; the
artist Sir D Y Cameron; the playwrights Barrie and Bridie; the poet
Maurice Lindsay; and novelist Guy McCrone of Wax Fruit fame.
The Academy prides itself in its tradition of service. Almost 500
former pupils lost their lives in the two world wars. Two VCs were won
in the first. From Victorian times, pupils have been encouraged to
consider those in need. In keeping with this, one of the current 150th
birthday projects is to collect #50,000 for the Eastpark Children's
Home, specifically for the wing for teenage girls. At least three
influential organisations for youth -- the Scottish Schoolboys' Club,
the Boys' Brigade, and the Boy Scout movement in Scotland -- owed much
at their inception to former academicians.
If Scots sometimes think they are being taken over by the English, the
Academy could be seen as spearheading a counter-coup. Distinguished old
boys of today include Sir John Kerr, British Ambassador to Washington;
politicians Donald Dewar and Robert McLennan; Jeremy Isaacs and Neil
MacGregor, directors respectively of the Royal Opera House and London's
National Gallery; banker Angus Grossart; artist William Crosbie; former
Herald editor Alastair Warren; business luminaries Sir Iain Vallance of
BT and Charles Miller Smith, chief executive of ICI; Oxbridge historians
Norman Stone and Niall Ferguson; and George MacDonald Fraser, chronicler
of that most bounderish of public schoolboys, Flashman.
George Fraser was a boarding pupil in the early 1940s (the boarding
school no longer exists) and remembers the school with affection. ''It
was a smashing school, very friendly,'' he recalls, ''and nobody got
bullied.'' Though he himself admits to having failed ''every exam except
English and History!'' he sent his sons there and says, ''I can't think
of a higher recommendation.'' He also recalls how the teaching staff of
his day was ''an interesting mix of English masters and Scots
dominies''.
Physically, the main school remains much as it was in his day. The
tall doorway, its glass decorated with classical figures, leads to the
central well which now houses a library where senior pupils browse under
the eye of oil paintings of former rectors. A big, tiered, lecture room
used to house Latin classes. Classics may be in general eclipse but at
Glasgow Academy ''one-and-two-thirds-classicists'' are still employed
fully, says David Comins.
Across the playground -- as unpristine as anywhere haunted by the
boisterous young -- lies the new music block, an enviable addition to
the school's facilities. It has individual practice rooms and a little
recital hall with curved walls, a Yamaha grand piano, and views over the
Kelvin. On the day I visited, the quality of its acoustics was proved by
fifth-year pupil Rosemary Morrison, who gave a Saint-Saens cello piece a
spirited run-through with director of music Bill Ritchie.
In the biology building boys and girls work in classrooms that are
divided sensibly into studying and experimental areas. Since the
departmental head's surname is Shirley this shrine to science is known
inevitably as ''The Shirley Temple''.
The Academy's special strengths have traditionally been seen as
academic and sporting (the Scottish Rugby Union was founded in the
school's common room in 1873 and 81 FPs have played for Scotland). But
art is a popular subject for senior pupils. No fewer than 11 sat A-level
art in last year's sixth form, with six top grades ensuing. The art
rooms glow with creativity. Head art teacher Adrian de Villiers,
originally from South Africa, stresses the importance of drawing and
also encourages three-dimensional work. The results range from the
dazzling to the disconcerting. An annual art trip has taken pupils to
Paris, Barcelona, and Amsterdam in recent years. Next month's excursion
is to New York, no less.
Other special activities for the 150th year include a dinner for
former pupils; a rugby tournament (this took place at the school's
sports grounds at Anniesland at the beginning of the month and, whisper
it, was won by a team from the east); a hockey tournament in November;
the simultaneous scaling of 150 Munros next May; a climbing expedition
to Pakistan next summer; a summer ball next June (for which the whole
playground will be tented over); various debates and question times
chaired by the likes of Donald Dewar and Sir Michael Hirst; and a
production of Oliver. ''On top of all that we're hoping to get some
exams passed as well!'' says David Comins.
Though most of his earlier teaching experience was in single-sex
schools, including Glenalmond, Comins is an enthusiast for co-education.
''It is so obviously a more natural environment,'' he says. And ''Life
is co-educational!'' Indeed. Co-education has, of course, been the
traditional way of education in Scotland outside the cities.
Fees for the privilege of attending Glasgow Academy -- and youngsters
are privileged to be in such a stimulating educational environment --
range from #475 a term for nursery and kindergarten to #1430 a term for
Forms 3 to 6 in the senior school. It is significant, however, that out
of a senior school of 585 pupils, 80 have assisted places and school
funds support 24 others where families may have fallen on hard times --
a total of almost 18%. Parents range from people on Sunday Times lists
of the super-rich to a street flower-seller. ''It's quite a good mix,
healthy and beneficial,'' says the rector.

TURNER: The Fighting Temeraire.
Judy Egerton.
National Gallery and Yale University Press,
#10.95
IT IS one of the nation's best-loved pictures. J M W Turner's The
Fighting Temeraire, Tugged to her Last Berth to be Broken Up 1838, has
been reproduced millions of times as engraving, poster, postcard, and
print since the artist gave it to the nation 140 years ago.
No wonder. It contains all the right ingredients of patriotism,
pathos, and nostalgia as a highly charged sunset salutes a graceful old
battleship on her last voyage.
This famous ship had fought heroically at the Battle of Trafalgar in
1805. Now her days are done. Turner makes her inglorious finale -- a
huge but powerless, almost ghostly vessel without masts, sail or flags
-- into a memorable image symbolising the end of an era; the end of
sail. The picture can also be intepreted as a lament for the passing of
Britain's naval greatness. or an allegory of sacrifice to progress. At
the time it evoked for many the flavour of 1838 when Queen Victoria was
crowned. and Brunel's SS Great Western inaugurated transatlantic
passenger crossings by steam ship.
This book, published to coincide with a superb exhibition on the same
subject at London's National Gallery until October 1, begins with an
account of the 98-gun ship herself, against a background of the wars
with France. Then it looks at Turner the artist and his obsessive study
of ships and the sea. In part three, the two cross as Turner transforms
the ship's last voyage into poetic fiction.
For Turner did not attempt accurate documentation of the event. Indeed
he used a great deal of artistic licence in his painting, freely
adapting facts. He did not actually witness the spectacle -- some would
say tragedy -- but painted it all from imagination.
Turner did not need to see the scene. By 1838 his knowledge of ships
was vast and newspaper reports were enough to fire his imagination.
In fact, the Temeraire was not towed to Rotherhithe at sunset. (No
self respecting pilot in his senses would have chosen to navigate a
crowded river in the gloom!) In reality the ship had no masts, no furled
sails. Turner represents the offending tug as a strange squat, evil
toad-like shape. Even its belching funnel is in the wrong place.
Yet without Turner the Temeraire would probably now be entirely
forgotten. Ruskin judged it to be the last picture Turner painted ''with
his perfect power''. Turner himself was very fond of his painting of the
Temeraire. He called it ''my darling'', refused offers to buy it, and
kept it with him till his death.
From the start the Fighting Temeraire was received with acclaim,
immediately being reviewed as ''the most wonderful of all the works of
the greatest master of the age''.
Judy Egerton, an expert in her field, writes clearly, making this well
illustrated book a good wallow for sailors, historians and art lovers
alike.

* A PIECE OF JUSTICE by Jill Paton Walsh, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #15.99,
is a delightful and relaxing book as befits the setting, a fictional
Cambridge College. This is the second novel with Imogen Quy (to rhyme
with 'why') the part-time college nurse as the amateur detective and we
meet her first with a group of friends planning the pattern and various
fabrics for a patchwork quilt to raffle in aid of the Red Cross.
Fran, Imogen's friend and lodger, is taken on by her tutor to
ghost-write a biography of an eccentric but now dead mathematician. It
transpires that she is by no means the first to approach this task and
all her predecessors have disappeared in one way or another. It becomes
Imogen's self-appointed task to find out why and the theme of
guilt-making forms an integral part of the mystery and its solution.
* CLOSE CALL by Gillian Slovo, Michael Joseph, #14.99, has Kate
Baeier, private detective turned journalist, after five years as a war
reporter taking on what should be the relatively relaxing job of writing
newspaper profiles. The most recent of these, that of a police Chief
Superintendent, leads Kate into a nightmare collage of suspected rape,
drug-dealing, the death of a tramp in the cells, the planting of
evidence and police corruption generally, together with a 20-year-old
fatal hit-and-run case.
We have the advantage of being steered through the resultant maze with
the utmost skill and entertainment by Miss Slovo whereas poor Kate
Baeier has matters only complicated for her by the ministrations of
Valerie, a rape counsellor, Carmen, her former partner in the detective
agency, and Anna, her best friend, respectively.
The policemen tend to be stereotyped baddies but I am happy to say
that they come out of it better than the girlfriends in the end.
* WISH YOU WERE HERE by Lesley Grant-Adamson, Hodder and Stoughton,
#15.99, finds Linda, a divorcee for a year who has a job in a Cathedral
Town book-shop, going on a solitary driving-tour of England. In order to
resist going on holiday with a persistent fellow shop-assistant, she had
convinced her friends that she was going to Italy, nobody knows where
she really is and she is therefore an ideal target for Tom Hoby, a
sinister character who by his own descritpion ''collects'' women.
Inexorably she allows herself to be manoeuvred into joining the
collection. We already know of the outcome from the first chapter which
cuts in when the trap has just been sprung and, from then on the
chapters alternate, even numbers taking the story forward from its
beginning, odd numbers from the beginning of the end to the end. Linda's
inability to draw back while there is still time from the thrall imposed
by Tom is wholly convincing.
* THE politically correct CLEAN BREAK by Val McDermid, HarperCollins,
#14.99, has, as one would expect, an anti-establishment private
investigator Kate Brannigan, a ''Ms'' if ever there was one, is
constantly whinging about the imagined shortcomings of others while
herself possessing the ethics of an alley cat with only a fraction of
its charm. (Sorry about cliches, but Ms Brannigan talks in nothing else
and it's catching).
A reader who can survive that will be rewarded with a story that is
fast moving and well contrived in which Brannigan finds herself involved
with two cases simultaneously, the one -- covering a sequence of art
thefts -- taking her all around Europe, the other -- industrial sabotage
in a firm of industrial cleaning manufacturers -- being confined to a
car journey's distance from her native Manchester.
Ms Brannigan, not to mention Ms McDermid, handle both with competence
and steer the reader through a double sequence of interlocking
predicaments towards a successful denouement. I was only left with a
feeling of compassion for the Ms's long-suffering live-in lover and his
equally battered rival for her favours.

ONE MOONLIT NIGHT.
Caradog Prichard.
Canongate, #8.99
* WHEN Caradog Prichard took the bardic crown he won at the 1927
Eisteddfod to show his mother ''she plonked it on her head and sang a
hymn'' in the mental hospital where she was to spend much of her life.
The bereft boy became a successful Fleet Street journalist, but could
not purge himself of the anguish he felt at his mother's condition, and
tried to commit suicide under a train.
It was only through writing that he was able to express the love he
felt for her. His one novel One Moonlit Night, published in the original
Welsh in 1961, when Prichard was 57, is a masterpiece, and we have to be
grateful to Canongate for publishing the first complete English
translation.
The story is narrated by a boy growing up in a Welsh community during
the First World War.
The women fight against poverty, and many of the men won't come home
from the trenches. There is also the tension of a Welsh speaking
community having to come to terms with the English introduced by
incomers, a situation paralleled in the Gaelic experience in rural
Scotland.
The lyrical writing style, full of the innocence of the young, is made
even more attractive by the music of Welsh place-names, and nick-names
such as Little Owen the Coal.
Despite the sadness of the subject, it's an exuberant book about
childhood friendships and insights.
The boy who depends on his mother has to become a man in the space of
hours as he accompanies her to the asylum at the end of this wonderful
novel, as the author must have had to do with his own mother.
''And there we were, Mam and me singing at the tops of our voices:
'The Man who was crucified long ago/ For a sinful man like me/ who
drained the cup completely/ Himself on Calvary.''

THE sheltered life of a journalist leaves less time than normal for
goggle-boxing. At least that's my excuse. Two new audio tapes feature
familiar characters from TV series that I haven't seen. An innocent ear
is guaranteed.
Channel 4 sets its Drop the Dead Donkey ''sitcom'' in the world of the
fictional TV station GlobeLink News. In Drop the Dead Donkey 2000 (three
tapes, Bespoke Audio, #8.99) the editorial team -- toupee-totting
newscaster Henry (any resemblance to Reginald Bousanquet is purely
intentional), his rival Sally, fussy George the editor, hard-man
managing director Gus, lesbian Helen, et al -- are facing up to the new
millennium. There's bloody civil war in Montreux, GlobeLink's owner is
in financial straits, and there's a small dead Welshman in the lift.
Fun is guaranteed. Much of it at the expense of the office
stereotypes. But the extra ingredient is a mystery. When foreign
correspondent Damien finds himself doing an anodyne article on the
privatisation of a Welsh regiment (uniforms by Vaclav Havel) he
discovers that 11 officers have committed suicide in the previous few
months. Someone, moreover, has cut the report of their regimental dinner
from the local paper's archives.
The plot is ingenious, cynical, and all too plausible. Will the threat
to the nation's manhood be exposed? Listen on with Stephen Tompkinson.
Ruth Rendell's Chief Inspector Wexford investigates the bludgeoning of
a handsome smallholder in the main story in Blood Lines (Random House,
two cassettes, #8.99). Geraldine James reads with total professionalism
but the plot is difficult to follow, even if the theme of serial
domestic violence is explored perceptively.
The shorter stories are more telling. For example, the one about the
successful woman executive who is a compulsive shopper, though she
realises with ''a flash of appalled insight'' that she actually hates
new clothes. An essay in psychology with a victim but no crime.
Lanark is not just a pleasant county town but the title of Alasdair
Gray's most ambitious novel. A dramatised version has been challenging
audiences at the Edinburgh Festival. Meanwhile the Glaswegian
artist-author demonstrates yet another talent with his pawky rendering
of excerpts from the book (Canongate Audio, two tapes, #7.99). The
mixture of precise description and surrealistic subject-matter keeps the
listener engrossed if bemused.
In a sunless future world, the eponymous character socialises in a
cinema cafe of the '40s Glaswegian variety before diving into the even
more bizarre environment of a subterranean hospital with talking lifts
and human flesh on the menu.
Lanark's love story with Rima, whom he frees from the metal (and
mental) carapace of a giant bird, is a mixture of the erotic and the
odd. Is it all part of a giant allegory about the self-destructiveness
both of corporate humanity and of individuals guarding themselves
against emotion? Too soon to say on this sampling. At the end, Gray
promises more -- ''if I am spared''. A eventuality devoutly to be
desired for many reasons. Gray is as inimitable as he's entertaining.
Naxos AudioBooks have issued a wealth of established classics this
summer, complete with appropriate incidental music. The oldest of them
takes some beating. Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, penned in the late
fourteenth century, have been rendered into modern couplets that catch
the spirit of the original (can today's Higher students still lisp a few
lines of the Prologue in Middle English?).
The sly humour about social pretension, the savage irony about
clerical hypocrisy and abuses, above all the sheer zest for life, leap
from the spoken text. The Knight's Tale leaves one sorry for Emily who
is the object, rather than subject, of obsessive desire on the part of
two Theban cousins. The Miller's Tale is as scabrous as ever; the
Pardoner's points a still chilling moral about greed (three cassettes,
#7.49)
That cult reading-matter of the 1960s -- Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria
Quartet -- can be sampled with the issue on tape of its second volume,
Balthazar (Naxos, three cassettes, #7.49). The erotic, exotic world of
prewar Alexandria with expatriots and locals caught in a complex network
of relationships -- ''like a slimy congress of eels'' -- is conjured by
Durrell's poet's prose. Can one really leap into the story amid-stream?
Perhaps it would be best to meet the pivotal Justine in the first
volume, issued on tape by Naxos last spring. The two remaining novels
are promised for the autumn. Ravel and Debussy set the musical tone of
civilised decadence.
Aubrey's Brief Lives are sketches of sixteenth and early
seventeenth-century notables, gossipy, vulgar, quaint, moving -- above
all human (two cassettes, #5.99). An unexpected treat, in John Buchan
mode, is the 1903 thriller by Erskine Childers, The Riddle of the Sands.
This story of two men in a boat in the North Sea anticipates uncannily
the German threat to Britain of 11 years on. Its warm, immediate writing
and patriotic assumptions are given added poignancy by the knowledge
that its author was later executed for his IRA activities in the Irish
Civil War (Naxos, two cassettes, #5.99).

Eileen McCallum currently appearing in The Trick is to Keep Breathing
at the Tron, Glasgow, describes her nocturnal reading to ANN DONALD.
* I WAS reading Iain Crichton Smith's book Consider The Lilies at the
recent Edinburgh Book Festival. I knew about it already but it was great
to read in more detail and realise the poetic craft he brought to it by
interweaving it with a lovely spare and simple language.
I also read Lewis Grassic Gibbon's short story Smeddum which has a
real sting in the tail. Again he's got a real poetry but it's more a
rollicking use of ''the speak''. I have his other book A Scots Quair
about all the time as a kind of comfort book. My parents were Aberdonian
and we spent a lot of time in Deeside so the book means quite a lot to
me, and I love the character of Chris.
My daughter has recently moved to Kenya and a holiday there influenced
my reading. I read Dervla Murphy's Ukimii Road which unfortunately when
translated means AIDS Road. She's an Irishwoman in her sixties and an
intrepid traveller and prolific writer. For this book she bought the
best mountain bike that she could find, flew to Nairobi and just started
cycling. She cycled all over the country stopping en route in various
villages to have a beer and ask if anyone could give her a bed for the
night.
I read Out Of Africa by Karen Blixen as well. I was a book that I had
resisted for a long time and read it under sufferance in a way thinking
''I'm not going to like this one bit''. However I was surprisingly
engaged by it. I thought that it might be a view of Africa that I don't
particularly care for, ie a colonialist's view. But Blixen ran her farm
fairly and had good relations with her black workers.
I read a book about Beryll Markham called Lives of Beryll Markham by
Errol Trzebinski. She was one of the first aviatrixes and I think she
was the first female to fly in one direction around the world. She was
very much a member of the White Mischief set out in Africa and a real
free spirit who bred horses, was very brave and loved flying. Though you
get the impression from this book that she wasn't a particularly
pleasant woman.

CONTEMPORARY SCOTTISH STUDIES. Hugh MacDiarmid. Carcanet, #25 (pp461)
IN conversation with his friend and fellow poet Norman MacCaig, Hugh
MacDiarmid -- with characteristic and understandable immodesty --
claimed to have created modern Scottish literature. ''You've written a
lot,'' replied MacCaig, ''but not a literature.'' Perhaps, but nobody
did more for the cause of modern Scottish literature than MacDiarmid
who, under that pseudonym, wrote poems as fine as those of Eliot or
Pound and used his given name of Christopher Murray Grieve to write
polemics that gave Scotland an opportunity to consider what was wrong
with its culture.
Polemicist Grieve created his poetic alter ego in October 1922 in the
third issue of his magazines Scottish Chapbook where the scots lyric
''The Watergaw'' was attributed pseudonymously to MacDiarmid so a great
modern Scot was born in the annus mirabilis of modernism, the year of
Ulysses and The Waste Land. Grieve felt MacDiarmid would never get his
due in a Scotland stuck in the swamp of a sentimental and complacent
post-Burnsian culture and set out to educate Scots to adjust to the ways
of the modern, and modernist, world.
This he did impressively in The Scottish Educational Journal, the
weekly paper of the Educational Institute of Scotland. During the period
the first three MacDiarmid books of poetry were published -- Sangschaw
(1925), Penny Wheep (1926), A Drunk Man looks at the Thistle (1926) --
Grieve contributed a ''Contemporary Scottish Studies'' column to the
Scottish Educational Journal from June 19, 1925 to February 4, 1927.
The column caused great controversy. Grieve's admirer Helen
Cruickshank, buying her weekly copy from a station bookstall in
Edinburgh, was asked by the manager if she could account for the popular
interest in a paper previously bought only by teachers. ''People buy
it,'' she explained, ''to see what is being castigated by C M Grieve
this week.'' Cruickshank's neighbour in Edinburgh was Thomas Henderson,
editor of The Scottish Educational Journal. He had no idea, when he
accepted the column by Grieve, he was taking on a man determined to
damage the pillars of Scottish society.
Some of the articles were collected in the book Contemporary Scottish
Studies in 1926 and in 1976 The Scottish Educational Journal celebrated
its centenary by reprinting the original articles along with the furious
correspondence they provoked. This latest reprint, edited by Alan Riach,
is a reminder of how Grieve made the Modern Scottish Renaissance to
promote the poetry of MacDiarmid. Grieve described MacDiarmid as the
only modern Scot capable of producing lyrics suitable for the
modernistic music of F G Scott; as a leader of ''the new movement
towards Scottish Independence in art or politics;'' as a cultural
saviour of Scotland.
According to Grieve, almost everyone was out of step but MacDiarmid.
Grieve had included four poems by Lauchlan Maclean Watt in his anthology
Northern Numbers but now trashed him as the perpetrator of poetic
''atrocities''. Charles Murray, also anthologised in Grieve's Northern
Numbers, was rubbished as a man who ''has not only never written a line
of poetry in his life, but . . . is constitutionally incapable of doing
so.'' Neil Munro, to whom the first issue of Northern Numbers was
dedicated, got off comparatively lightly by being dismissed as ''a minor
artist (lacking) the personality to make the most of the limited, yet
indubitable gifts he possesses''.
Everything contaminated by the Kailyard or the Celtic Twilight was
condemned by Grieve. J M Barrie was savaged as an unscrupulously
commercial dramatist not worthy of consideration in a Scottish context.
Mrs Kennedy-Fraser, the folksong collector, was ''a Rip Van Winkle of
Scottish musical development''. What Scotland needed was a revolutionary
rebirth, a farewell to all ''the 'sob-stuff', invincible ignorance, and
conceit which characterises nine-tenths of the pronouncements of those
who are today regarded as authorities on the arts in Scotland''. Thus
spoke Grieve on behalf of Scottish Renaissance Man MacDiarmid.
Determined to dispose of spurious notions of Scottish culture and
founding his faith in an antithetical and irrationalist Scottish
literature on a lively academic study by G Gregory Smith -- ''Professor
Gregory Smith, whose book on Scottish Literature is . . . the first
text-book I would like to place in the hands of any young Scot likely to
play a part in bringing about a National Renaissance'' -- Grieve
believed his Modern Scottish Renaissance was an antidote to the poison
that had corrupted Scottish culture.
Grieve advanced a theory of Synthetic Scots which, of course, made the
experimental MacDiarmid sound a greater poet than Burns who ''did
nothing to restore Braid Scots (but) simply took it at the level at
which he found it''. Burns's song ''A Man's a Man'' was an
''unspeakable'' failure. It was, wrote Grieve, ''high time the Burns
legend was destroyed''. Grieve favoured foreign writers, especially such
Russian revolutionary poets as Blok and Mayakovsky -- ''A Scottish
Mayakovsky at this juncture would be a godsend.'' There were no prizes
for guessing the poet Grieve had in mind as the Scottish Mayakovsky.
Readers ranted at the iconoclastic opinions of Grieve which was
exactly the response Grieve wanted. He was out to make enemies among the
establishment and the more he made the merrier he was. The Scottish
Educational Journal provided Griev with a platform on which to preach
sermons on the Modern Scottish Renaissance. Grieve's combative prose in
Contemporary Scottish Studies played a critical part in the making of
MacDiarmid.

SLEEPING WITH GHOSTS.
A life's work in photography.
Don McCullin, Vantage UK, #15.00
* SLEEPING With Ghosts is a retrospective of some of Don McCullin's
greatest work.
His pictures from the trouble hell holes of the world -- Biafra,
Bangladesh, Cyprus, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Iraq, to name a few -- are
legend and show, honestly and vividly, man's inhumanity to his fellow
man.
McCullin's war photographs gathered together like this make a
remarkable and historic document, as well as being a graphic insight
into the horrors and suffering of war.
Juxtaposed with the monochrome madness of conflict, are dramatic still
lifes, and haunting landscapes -- such as this on of pilgrims on a
sandbank on the Gandak river near Patna, some taken in India and
Indonesia, others taken in and around Somerset, which are themselves
brooding with the guilt and trauma of the survivor.
After viewing this astonishing, personally selected collection of 200
images, you must wonder if this courageous and dedicated photographer
manages to sleep at all.

The Pilgrim's Guide to Santiago de Compostela: Annie Shaver-Crandell
and Paul Gerson. Harvey Miller, #48.
THIS is not one of the rougher guides. A simple pilgrim inclined to
plain fare as well as true valour, might buy a fortnight's wayside
provisions for the cost. But it's a book of unusual character, a labour
of love as well as learning. The authors and their helpers appear mainly
based around New York.
At the book's core, but using only 30 of its 424 pages, is a
translation of the twelfth-century guide to the pilgrim routes through
France and Spain to the Galician shrine of St James the Great, the James
who was brother of John, not of Jesus.
This guide to one of the three greatest medieval pilgrimages -- the
others were to Jerusalem and Rome -- was written in Latin by an unknown
Frenchman who hated Basques and Navarrese, whom he thought related to
the Scots, and warned of the hazards of the journey a couple of
centuries before Chaucer's Wife of Bath attempted it.
On this pilgrim way there may have been no Giant Despair or Slough of
Despond but there were ferry men between Bordeaux and Spain reputed to
tip their pilgrim-passengers into the river and rob the corpses of the
drowned. The author also mixed sexual libels on the local tribes and
warnings about bad fish with a guide to veneration of alleged relics on
the routes, including the head of John the Baptist, the body of Mary
Magdalene, and the knife that cut the bread at the Last Supper. As in
every age, the elements of faith go with passing fashions and foolish
superstitions.
But the greater part of the book (which has a separate two-volume
companion work of detailed notes, textual criticism, and study of
manuscripts) is taken up by the gazeteer of the towns and and monuments
of the pilgrim routes. This includes such obvious entries as the great
churhces of Tours, Toulouse, and Leon, but also covers in rich detail
places with less immediately obvious associations with the pilgrimage,
such as Arles.
The authors are perhaps too inclined to be ''immersed in the spirit of
the Middle Ages'' to develop what they rightly say about the continuing
appeal of prilgrimage both as idea and experience -- as testified today
not only in Jerusalem but in Iona as well as Lourdes or Santiago.
It's also a pity that they didn't note the important place of Santiago
and the pilgrimage routes in the English-language travel literature of
Spain whether in the robust Protestant forms of George Borrow and
Richard Ford (who warned that Galicia should only be visited in summer),
the gipsy-violin in Catholicism of Walter Starkie, or even the
detachment of V S Pritchett. He felt the nave of Leon Cathedral, seen
through stained glass, as ''a stab from a medieval heaven'' in air like
frozen wine. Galicia also produced some of Borrow's liveliest mixtures
of experience and imagination, and Santiago bought more of his New
Testaments than most Spanish cities.

IN September 1970, Salvador Allende, one of Isabel's many uncles on
her father's side, was elected president of Chile, by a coalition of
Marxists, Socialists, Communists, segments of the disillusioned
middle-class, and Christian radicals, determined to embark on a
programme of transition toward socialism, without altering the nation's
long bourgeois and democratic tradition. It was insurmountably glamorous
that a Marxist had been elected by democratic vote. The eyes of the
world were on Chile.
Isabel Allende wrote Paula for her daughter, while nursing her through
a coma. Isabel wanted to explain the family history. Intended at first
to be a series of letters which her daughter could read when well, now,
a record of everything Isabel never got the chance to share with her;
her childhood and the lives of their ancestors.
To tell you the truth, it's a remarkable work, combining
autobiographical detail, peasant superstition, political documentary,
intertwining destiny, tragedy, generations of storytelling and humour.
There are very few people in this world who can write words which make
you smile while simultaneously wishing that life was another way. Paula
is a real book about real events. Stand back and admire Allende's
talent, her literary ability even more potent for being stripped and
harnessed in personal despair.
After Allende's victory, Isabel Allende's beloved stepfather, Tio
Ramon, was named ambassador to Argentina and thereon attempted to
normalise relations between Argentina and Chile. A man of impractical
principle, he fired his guards because he believed that the
representative of a people's government could not be surrounded by hired
killers. Four years after the first terrorist attempt on their house in
Buenos Aires, Isabel's parents slipped away in the dead of night to save
their skins. Sometimes mob ignorance overrules the brave and the
brilliant. The family eventually paid for his integrity with many years
of exile.
Allende herself, is quirky, intelligent, human and desperate. There
are chapters where she voices a direct challenge to God to make her
strong and inquisitive daughter well again. But she is never
self-indulgent. She makes the painful accessible, fate funny, the
sadistic machismo, eccentric disciplines of her grandfather and
stepfather, endearing.
Family life pans out as only reality not fiction can. Isabel's
maternal grandmother Meme, was able to communicate with animals,
foretell the future and move objects with her gaze. Fortunately her
grandfather, Tata, ''regarded telepathy and telekinesis as innocent
diversions and in no way a serious obstacle to marriage''. Isabel's
mother was beautiful, she ''amused herself with charitable works and
romantic novels'' and ''had lovesick admirers buzzing round like flies;
young men her father held at bay and her mother analysed with tarot
cards''. But it is her desperation to provide for her kids after being
abandoned by Isabel's biological father, that breaks her.
Her mother, in turmoil, a vulnerable condition which sometimes
ensnares the strongest men, inadvertently attracts men of intelligence
who will figure later in her life and contribute to her family's
personal and political safety. Her stepfather, Tio Ramon, taught Isabel
the value of a good argument. She recounts defending Job, for example,
against accusations of idiocy after a hard day's schooling. Her
stepfather would convince her that her view was wrong, and then chin her
for allowing someone to change her mind.
''Are you covinced that Job was a numbskull?''
''Yes, Tio Ramon.''
''Will you swear to that in writing?''
''Yes.''
''I do not now how many statements with three carbons I signed in my
adolescence on topics as wildly diverse as biting my fingernails and the
threatened extinction of whales. I believe that for a few years Tio
Ramon kept some of them -- for example, the one in which I swear that it
is his fault that I will never meet any men and will end up an old maid.
That was in Bolivia, when at age 11 I threw a tantrum because he did not
let me go to a party where I thought I would see my beloved Big Ears.''
Allende's charming and meticulous prose makes various degrees of
insanity -- political or psychological -- palatable.
Isabel's book, was inspired by death but it reeks of life. The ghosts
of Meme and Paula, the healers, herbalists and the I Ching, vague
harbingers of hope, who try to bring Paula back to life, are written
about so matter-of-factly, that realism reads like a fairy tale. Isabel
ponders on motherhood, her decision to let her daughter go, and rest in
peace, having given her life in the first place. And the reader is
invited too, to remember, as the book dissolves in grief, the prediction
of the Chilean seer who accosted Isabel at a feast, 180 pages and more
than 30 years earlier.
''One of your children will be known in many parts of the world. Which
one? my mother demanded. The seer pointed to you, Paula.'' Now we know
why.

THE BIOGRAPHER'S MOUSTACHE.
Kingsley Amis.
Flamingo, #9.99
* INVENTION was never Sir Kingsley's strongest point; and given that
he has lately co-operated in his own authorised biography, it's hard to
resist the suggestion that he is once again mining his life for what he
regards as fictional nuggets.
On the other hand, he could be up to something. He could be using the
biography as a metaphor, which would invite us to compare the elderly
man of letters, Jamie Farr -- whose face is pink from ''decades of
assiduous boozing'' -- with Amis himself, and the hack and failed
novelist turned biographer Gordon Scott-Thompson, a scholarship boy from
suburban London, with his younger self.
Then again, his son, Martin, could be in there. For Amis dispenses
advice on life and fiction as often as he sends his characters for a
drink. His advice on both topics is pretty much the same: do what you
like and ignore everyone else, which isn't much to sustain a novel and
if the best a work of fiction can offer is glimpses of its author and
his opinions, then those who do not share Sir Kingsley's interest in
himself will find his latest work offers little in the way of
entertainment.
It is a flat and sloppy book, which as a first novel, rather than a
piece of late-period indulgence, would never have seen the light of day.
It is sustained by a number of set pieces, which have a tired air, not
because Amis and others have done them better elsewhere, but because
they are set pieces and positions them to lift a flagging narrative
rather than placing them where they will have the maximum effect. His
great gift was always as a storyteller, someone who could entertain with
tricky plots and observations. Here we see his craft exposed, which
means it isn't working.
Amis was always good in bars and restaurants. Dinner tables brought
out the best in his fiction and as we may expect, given the
autobiographical nature of this novel, there are a couple of dinner
parties. These are preceded by half-page conversations on what people
are having to drink. Since the ploy with reviewing Amis is to find out
what he's up to, here he could, of course, be attempting a form of
social realism, representing life as art, but somehow I doubt it. And,
of course, there is a tilt at ''the bastards who run publishing'' but
with this evidence in your hand it's hard to take that rant seriously.
Most of these difficulties could have been hidden in a fluent prose
style. But Amis seems to go out of his way to use a style that exposes
his novel's weaknesses. It reads like dictation. There are rambling
sentences which are more pedestrian than workmanlike, which slow the
narrative and beg the question that if he couldn't be bothered trying to
shape his prose, why should anyone bother reading it?
There is a dated feel, which comes from a similar reticence and class
consciousness to that found in Carry On films. When Gordon takes Jamie's
wife Joanna to bed, he offers ''hanky panky'' though when using the
world ''girlfriend'', Amis tells us Jamie ''understood the contemporary
world well enough to be aware that you were not supposed to call people
things like that in it''. Given that such a sentence sort of makes
sense, there are similarly misplaced and misunderstood gestures towards
contemporary society from the younger generation. Gordon's girlfriend
describes something as ''uncool'' and he suggests the word has gone out
of use. ''They had, but they're starting to again,'' she tells him,
getting it wrong, of course. The time warp extends to locations, to the
world of bedsits and country weekends but no matter where he takes his
characters and no matter how hard he tries to inject a plot, his heart
isn't in it and whenever the Amis narrative drive tries to take over it
gets lost in broken sentences, half formed ideas and requests for more
drink.

Douglas Thompson talks to song and dance marvel Shirley MacLaine about
her career, her past lives and, of course, what the future holds.
FORTY years ago when Alfred Hitchcock was casting The Trouble with
Harry he viewed the screen-test of a 19-year-old Broadway actress called
Shirley MacLaine, who strutted her stuff doing a brief song-and-dance
act with a borrowed scarf as a prop. The rotund genius rumbled at her:
''My dear, you have the guts of a bank robber.''
The lady in question recalls: ''I didn't know what he meant. I didn't
know enough to be scared.''
She knows lots and lots now. The Hitchcock movie was the first of many
running from classics like The Apartment and Irma La Douce to more
recent efforts like her Oscar winner Terms of Endearment, Steel
Magnolias, Madame Sousatzka (her favourite), and the present release
Guarding Tess in which she plays the US President's widow being
''minded'' by Nicolas Cage.
But the redhead with great legs that have been dancing for more than
half a century (she was named after Shirley Temple and began ballet
classes at three-years-old) has also written eight books, starred in her
own television series, six television specials, produced and toured in
five one-woman shows, danced on Broadway, travelled much of the world,
and brought up a daughter who is now an actress. More, you might think,
than one could do in a lifetime.
But MacLaine, as we know, has had more than one life. She's been
living yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
Off Pacific Coast Highway and down the surf-lapped Malibu Road she
lives in a memorabilia-filled apartment. Every time you visit the
question of whether she's as mad as a snake springs to the fore. The
welcome mat is unsettlingly reptilian. It reads: ''Welcome UFOs and
crews.''
She insists that, among other beings, she's been a suicide victim in
Atlantis (reincarnation and Atlantis) which she discovered with the help
of a 300-year-old Irish pickpocket. Her spiritual odyssey, belief in ETs
rather than Steven Spielberg, and all manner of New Age spin-offs like
channellers -- ''human radios'' -- has been well documented in her
series of bestselling books.
Her latest book is more secular. And sexy. And, if you are a devotee
of the Tardis or Star Trek and suspicious of stellar sensations, much
more interesting and intriguing. It's about her life and loves
(including Robert Mitchum, Yves Montand whom she shared with Marilyn
Monroe, Danny Kaye) and friends (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis
Jnr, Jack Lemmon, Paul Newman, James Gardner, and others in a few
decades of Hollywood Who's Who) and involves much stranger things than
UFOs hovering over her head or her previous existence as Mongolian
nomad.
There was, if you recall, a hoo-ha about her nine-and-a-half fingered
composite Labour MP lover which helped sell even more copies of her book
Out On A Limb in which she told of their affair. She remembers all the
controversy: ''More people were concerned with my in-body experiences
than my out-of-body ones.''
Much of the humour -- and some heartache -- echoes throughout My Lucky
Stars: A Hollywood Memoir. It's by MacLaine so there is metempsychosis
but there's also Sinatra punching holes in hotel-room walls to indicate
that he has not got the accommodation he expected and telling her: ''Oh,
I just wish someone would try and hurt you so I could kill them for
you.''
And real-life killer ''Godfather'' Sam Giancana almost breaking her
arm because she wouldn't eat his pasta.
In her older age, the New Age material works better diluted by the
shenanigans of Sinatra and the Rat Pack and she tells super tales of
Dean Martin which revolve around his talent rather than his drinking --
although she maintains the ''drunkie'' act was just that: an act. The
''drink'' was always apple juice. Martin certainly comes across against
image as a sensitive and caring man.
Sinatra is Sinatra. The world's touchiest man. A short fuse human
explosive device.
MacLaine was ''the girl'' in the Rat Pack, the Clan who played and
played Las Vegas. Later, in the early 1990s she toured with Sinatra and
the antics from a couple of decades earlier hadn't changed too much.
After a show they would end up at an Italian restaurant where the food
and $1500 bottles of wine would be waiting. The local Mafia bosses would
turn up. Sinatra deferred to the mobsters for a couple of drinks and
then spent the rest of the evening insulting them.
By then MacLaine, naive in the Sam Giancana days, knew how to work the
situation so no-one lost face -- or their kneecaps.
Her tale is a glorious story of a Hollywood long gone. The politics
and the culture have changed dramatically. MacLaine's insight is honest.
She's not so much dishing dirt as telling the way they all were.
Of Mitchum, the dog-eared, big-waisted favourite of some decades of
moviegoers, she provides some extra paint in her portrait. We knew he
was difficult. We knew he played the toughie, but read poetry while
enjoying regular refreshments. But MacLaine, who had a long affair with
him, explains the fear of the man in a pub pugilist body who only wanted
to roll with life's punches. He was so passive that this woman who had
so many lives was irritated by him: ''He demanded nothing. He had no
desires.''
She jumps in the spaceship for other people. ''Peter Sellers inhabited
his various characters in such a deep way that, I now believe, they came
from his past life experiences and inhabited him.''
There is talk of her mother who forced her into tantrums: ''I believe
that in a lifetime prior to this one I experienced such a profound lack
of resolution with anger that I needed to come to terms with it and
literally chose my own mother because she would provoke me to resolve
it. The Hindus call it samsara.''
Call it what you like, Shirley MacLaine landed lucky. She was an
understudy in The Pajama Game when the lead Carol Haney broke her ankle.
The legendary producer Hal Wallis saw her and she signed a film contract
with him. She received three Oscar nominations almost as fast as her tap
shoes could click -- Some Came Running (a lost treasure today in which
she co-starred with Sinatra and Dean Martin), The Apartment, and Irma La
Douce.
For a time there was everybody's favourite light comedy actress.
Daffy, cute, funny, vulnerable. And the long legs that could wrap
themselves around any choreographer's dreams. She says it all changed a
quarter of a century ago when Jack Nicholson made Five Easy Pieces and
ordered his special sandwich in a cafe. She says grittier cinema seemed
to begin then: ''That scene catapulted us as actors into a different
decision-making process. That's the real transition I made -- not this
longevity stuff.''
Whatever, she has, she agrees, been around for some time. It shows
when she speaks. There's not the bravo-speak of the Baywatch set or the
gobbledegook of instant icons but rather the hard call: ''In acting,
we're always getting up to bat to humiliate ourselves.''
Barbs and criticism to her are like water off a Mongolian nomad's
back. She is her own woman and humiliation doesn't seem an option.
Forget Mystic Meg. This is a chance to find out about life's lottery:
''This millenium consciousness that they call it is everybody seeing the
end of not just this decade and not only 100 years but then of a
thousand-year time period -- and that is an apocalyptic point of view.
That's an approach, the sort of spell of doom and gloom, which has
shaped the end of every thousand-year period and it never came and it's
not going to come now.
''I think change will occur and nature is going to have a great deal
to do with balancing the human attitude. Nature is going to fight back
-- we're going to have earthquakes and typhoons and tidal waves and
stuff like that. It's happening right now. The handwriting is coming in
broader and broader strokes. I don't think man will make the big shift
until nature does, and then we will be forced to change. We need to
change.
''We're going to go into a Depression and that means lack of nature.
It means we begin to look at how the harmony of man and nature isn't
really living now. All these things I look at from the upside point of
view. I'm a personal example of it.''
She is a sure-footed survivor. She was married to producer Steve
Parker for 17 years. It finally ended in divorce in 1987, but they had
been apart for a long, long time. Her daughter Sachi lived in Japan with
her father but now is close to her mother and is acting: ''She's been
wanting to act for years and she's really good but she's struggling like
a lot of them. It's very hard on her. I don't know how she does it.
''She's resilient but she's also fragile and has a Japanese mentality
because she grew up there for so long. She speaks, reads and writes
fluent Japanese. She thinks like a Japanese -- totally focused.''
MacLaine has also always been that. She says she is not upset about
ageing and fading looks: ''What's to lose when you've never had them? I
was never a glamour puss. I've always wanted to be a character actor and
for the rest of my life I'm going to get all the parts that have gone to
Katharine Hepburn.''
In whatever life she's living you gather she'll get her wishes. Her
roles have changed with time and the times. ''I never look at my old
films. I can't bear it, not being able to go back to the editing room or
to do another take. I specialised in victims but I loved playing those
characters. I wouldn't mind playing them now but it probably wouldn't be
a good idea. The feminists would kill me.''
That, of course, is questionable. MacLaine still retains that devilish
streak Hitchcock noticed that disquieting number of years ago. She
agrees: ''There is something in me even now that would push a peanut all
the way down a street just to see if I could do it.''

The Crash Test Dummies are the hardest-working and the toughest family
in the business, writes Joe Donnelly, but are they more than just
sacrifial slams?
THEY have become one of the best known families in the world. On a
practical scale, they have done more for humankind than most.
Mum, dad, the kids, and baby. The Crash Test Dummies. This is the
Volvo team who surely have the toughest job in the motor trade. Every
day, they are sacrificed for the greater good, put into cars and then
slammed at very high speed against walls, barriers and other immovable
objects.
They don't complain, or cry, or bleed. Their working day is over in a
couple of seconds each morning before they are resurrected for the next
day's slaughter. Quite expressionless, they go through it all again and
again and again in what, for any human, would be the ultimate nightmare.
Scots actor Tom Conti might have pretended to give it a try in the
Vauxhall airbag advert -- ''Only kidding J D'' -- but the crash test
dummies are not pretending. For them it's a killing, rather than
kidding. They go through windscreens and slam into solid walls. They
whiplash, somersault and contort exactly the way real people do in
real-life crashes.
Most of the safety improvements in cars, and much of the safety
legislation for cars, is down to this obliging family and their
relatives in other car corporations. The dummies go through their daily
torture so that we won't. They also sacrifice themselves over and over
to design better cars. They can tell the engineers, not in so many
words, but in so many traumatic injuries, even at an early stage in the
development, the ''crash safety'' of a car which is not even available
for use on the roads.
Ase Lund, analyst in Volvo's crash safety section says: ''It's not
just enough to meet legal requirements in a lab. We have to make sure
that cars are safe in accidents on the streets.''
Her colleague Ingrid Skogsmo says of the dummies: ''You could say that
we've tried to translate the factors which determine whether or not a
human being is injured into a dummy. We can use this as a basis for an
assessment of the extent of the injuries a person could suffer in a road
accident.''
For this they use ''Average Sam'' who the testers look upon as a
competent colleague. He represents a normal driver who's five foot nine
and weighs just under 12 stone. His wife is more delicate, in shape at
least, with a more feminine face and a womanly bust. Baby is small and
wrinkled, like they usually are. The real difference between the kids
and the real McCoy, travelling wise, is that they don't drop crisp
packets on the floor, spill Irn Bru, constantly listen to walkmans, or
ask if we're nearly there yet.
Sam is technically advanced, full of sensors and cables linked to all
parts of his body. He's related to a Hybrid, a more advanced species
used to measure the damage caused in head-on collisions. The generations
of Hybrids are much more sensitive, technically speaking, which means
that research engineers can evaluate injuries to many more parts of the
body from one specific simulated accident.
At Volvo alone, there are more than 50 of Sam's relatives. Because
there is, at the end of the day, no such individual as the average
driver, the crash test dummies include a dainty little lady and a
hulking six-foot-plus 16-stone trucker. There are dummies of all ages,
shapes and sizes.
Skigsmo says a working day is never dull for the crash test dummies.
Average Sam and his family are subjected to head-on collisions,
side-swipes, rear shunts. They drive into pillars, posts, other cars,
travelling at a crawl or up to 50 miles an hour.
While we must assume that they feel no pain, the dummies are stuffed
with sensors to measure the stresses, pressures, and striking forces
which would be suffered by various parts of the human body in any type
of accident from a low speed fender-bender to a dreadful head-on smash
with an oncoming car.
At Volvo, the face alone has 18 measuring points and there is a reason
for this. While facial injuries are not rated very highly on the AIS
(abbreviated injury scale) which measures degrees of life-threatening
danger in road accidents, the people who suffer what are known as
cosmetic injuries can also suffer serious psychological problems because
of them.
The head is also full of sensors which can give evidence of whether or
not a real human would have suffered severe injury or a skull fracture.
Measurement vanes in the spine measure the impact of injuries on the
chest and can tell if it has been squeezed or compressed. The risk of
chest injuries are deduced by calculating the acceleration of the ribs.
Another measure calculates rib fractures and damage to internal organs.
All round the body, other sensors measure potential injuries to feet and
joints.
The use of dummies in assessing potential injuries in crash tests was
pioneered in the USA, but in the early days, the dummies had very few
measuring points and the initial aim was to make a survey of the most
serious types of injury.
Work was focused on ensuring that the seatbelts held passengers in
place, and progressed to measuring the degree of impact on the head and
chest. The sophisticated technology incorporated in the dummies allows
the researchers to work out degrees of injury. They can even let safety
engineers know if the seat belt itself, having kept the dummy in place,
has itself caused an injury.
As car technology improves, so does the advance of the crash test
dummies, and some of their other relatives.
English company Concentra Ltd of Coventry is at the leading edge of
computer-aided design which is being used to make virtual people who can
let researchers know just what's happening to them. Concentra have
designed a test dummy in a computer which they say can help with ''human
factors'' engineering.
It's called an Obedient Mannequin which the design software company
has created to respond to instructions. It can even make itself
comfortable.
The obedient mannequin is a system conceived to cut down the time
taken to design the interiors of cars, a process which often takes
months. Concentra believe their system can reduce this to less than a
week. In recent tradition, car designers have used computer simulation
to test whether what they have designed will actually suit a human user
-- whether he or she can reach the pedals and wheel, see over the edge
of the windscreen, feel comfortable with the height of the seat belt, or
the seat itself.
The human analogues on screen could be moved around, but at the end of
the day, the system tends to be one of virtual trial and error.
The obedient mannequin programme is different in that it can
understand instructions and the result is that this computer-generated
dummy can seat itself comfortably in a fraction of a second.
''The traditional approach has been to work with a physical mock-up or
a general propose computer mannequin,'' says Concentra's product manager
John Wilson.
''Both are time-consuming and result in a final production model being
used on just a few human variations. We designed the OM system to
analyse hundreds of human sizes in less than an hour.
''Under the system the screen dummy, which is no dummy after all, can
go beyond the simple question of whether it fits inside the car. It can
calculate to say whether it's really comfy and if not at ease, it can be
instructed to adjust the seat or steering wheel until it's just right.
From there it can check to see whether it can reach major controls
without difficulty,'' he says.
The models have been taken even further in a high-tech programme
written by US lab engineers.
The Dyna model analyses the interaction of passengers and any vehicles
involves in impacts and was used to analyse the 1991 Sevenoaks train
crash which killed two people and injured more than 500. The crash
happened when the train hit the buffers and the first official estimates
calculated the train was travelling at a mere 5mph.
The Lawrence Livermore Dyna programme mapped out simulations of seated
and unseated passengers on a three-dimensional imager and discovered the
train had been moving at 10mph faster than had first been thought.
The programme was run by Fraser Nash Consultancy of Leatherhead who
were investigating the crash for the Heath and Safety Executive. They
were able to run computer simulations of the train crash effects on a
number of passengers, running the virtual locomotive at various speeds.
Such is the power of the simulation that it was able to show not only
where passengers ended up, but how they would likely be injured at the
different speeds.
Now the high-tech programme can be used to prepare recommendations to
make train interiors more safe in the event of an accident.
The Dyna programme takes the dummy management a step further, and
makes it a great deal cheaper too. While crash tests are impressive,
they are expensive, costing upwards of #30,000 for every prang. Using
the Dyna system, parts can be crash-tested on computer which allows
manufacturers to improve on designs and prototypes before carrying out
final physical catastrophes. The computer simulation also allows
engineers to get a clearer picture of what happens than they do at the
moment in slow-motion photography.
One British firm has used applications of the programme to test
whether life-jackets will keep a person's head out of the water. They
are now looking at adaptations, using the electronic dummies to model
the launch of a lifeboat from a North Sea oil platform. The computer's
analogue humans, representing workers who might need a speedy exit from
a rig in a disaster, can be programmed to jump into a boat, slide down a
ramp, and free-fall about 20 metres into the sea.
The software calculates not only if the lifeboat can take the strain,
but the impact's effects on the people inside the boat, and it can also
test the results in digitised seas representing conditions which would
be too dangerous for real testing.
While computers will naturally take testing light years ahead, using
high maths to check angles and parameters, Average Sam and his extended
family will not be made redundant. They will remain to die another day,
all in the cause of pure altruism.
Whatever Sam, wife, kids and baby suffer, poor souls, it all helps the
engineers help preventing it happening to us.
Sam and the rest of the dummies will take it on the chin, the neck,
the leg, or whatever part hits the immovable object first, without a cry
or a whimper, or even a change of expression from that bland and placid
look to show the pain and trauma of it all.
Or maybe he won't. Sam has a distant cousin in Tokyo's Science
University who might, like the obedient mannequin, be able to show the
researchers how much discomfort and pain he is suffering.
Scientists at the university are programming robots, for the first
time in history, to show emotion by facial expression.
Talking robots are being designed to complement their own verbal
skills using signals recognisable to their human workmates. The Japanese
scientists have apparently used a real woman's death mask to design a
robot face which can stretch its various facial components on a scale of
zero to eight and is probably enough to scare the weans. The mimicry
allows it to display a range of emotions from anger to happiness and
sadness, disgust, surprise and fear.
Average Sam, in the course of the few milliseconds it takes for him
and his family to get through the worst of their working day, might very
well display a few of those on his way towards the brick wall.
And if he could speak, would he give a brave and stoic soldier's
farewell, or more likely: GET ME OUT OF HERE!

ERIC Cantona has confirmed he will attend Diego Maradona's meeting in
Paris on Monday that will attempt to form a world players' union.
Manchester United's French striker, a long-time admirer of the former
World Cup-winning captain, said: ''Of course I will be with Diego
Maradona on September 18 in Paris, certainly along with other players.
And even if he only has one ally on that day, it will be me.''
Maradona also invited Chelsea's Dutch star Ruud Gullit and Brazil's
Bebeto to Paris, but it is not known whether they will attend.
The Argentinian has said a players' union would break the monopoly
that the world governing body FIFA have on the game.
He also claims that FIFA have betrayed the game by failing to use its
funds to build stadiums or to help developing soccer nations.
Both Cantona and Maradona -- now back with his first club, Boca
Juniors -- will return to action shortly after lengthy suspensions.
Cantona, 29, is scheduled to make his comeback in United's Premiership
clash with Liverpool on October 1.

A TIRED and weary Celtic squad returned yesterday after an overnight
stay in Istanbul, almost 12 hours after having left their hotel in the
Turkish capital. The team were delayed in Turkey longer than they had
been at Batumi after their European clash.
The group almost failed to make the scheduled Turkish Airlines flight
after problems with unpaid bills at the hotel. Twelve hours earlier, the
team had been forced to wait for 20 minutes until Batumi club officials
received payments from journalists for telephone installations.
Yesterday, the hotel muddle held up some of the party for more than an
hour.
Meanwhile, suggestions that Celtic wish to probe the Batumi team list
are off the mark. UEFA regulations are very strict, and all players must
present passports -- even when they are playing at home.
There is no way that any team can use players who are not registered
properly, under the severe guidelines which European bosses insist upon.
Celtic may raise the problem of the telephone bills with UEFA, but,
basically, that is a matter which will be raised by the journalists
involved.
It is not the first time I have had to pay for a telephone in 30 years
of covering European football. Nor will it be the last. We are talking
here of storms in teacups.

* FORMER Rangers defender Basile Boli, who was knocked unconscious
when he collided with Monaco team-mate Marc Delaroche during Tuesday
night's UEFA Cup match against Leeds, left hospital yesterday.
The clash came as Tony Yeboah completed his hat trick in Leeds' 3-0
first round, first-leg victory in the principality. Club sources said
Boli was still in a state of shock but was not seriously injured.
Goalkeeper Delaroche was also injured and spent 24 hours in hospital.

CELTIC arrived back in Glasgow yesterday little more than 24 hours
before their premier division match against Motherwell at Parkhead this
afternoon.
Manager Tommy Burns, who has guided his team to back-to-back victories
over Aberdeen and Dinamo Batumi, refuses to accept that his players will
have too many problems after their long trek in Europe.
Burns simply shrugs off the difficulties that the Scottish Cup winners
have had to handle over the last four days that they have spent
travelling to Georgia and back.
In Glasgow yesterday, the manager said: ''It would have been very much
worse for us if we had come back with a bad result. What we have done is
win two games, two very important games, and that is the kind of thing
which helps any team.
''I don't think that I will have to do anything special to lift these
players for the Motherwell match. The victories will do that, especially
when you consider that we came from behind in each game to get the
results we wanted.
''The best thing of all for players is when they are stringing
together a series of results, and that's what we are doing at the
moment.
''We knew how hard this particular period was going to be, and we will
go into the match against Motherwell still knowing that. But I would
rather have it this way than not be playing in Europe.''
Best of all for Burns this week was that winning comeback to the
European stage. It may well be that their Georgian opponents in the
Cup-winners' Cup tie were not of the highest pedigree -- but that
matters little this morning.
All that really counts is that Celtic scored an impressive result away
from home in a Black Sea resort where the Yugoslav cup holders, Obilic,
were defeated.
They were able to overcome the travel problems and other worries which
plagued them, and produce a victory which will surely carry them into
the draw for the next round.
Today, they must handle Motherwell, a game they should not have been
asked to play.
I have said it before and I repeat it now -- the Scottish League must
be more ready to help clubs who are asked to play on a Thursday night in
Europe. More especially in this case, when the journey has been so long
and when the league brought forward the Coca-Cola Cup clash with Rangers
to Tuesday, for television money.
Celtic have lost out on all counts as far as the fixture congestion is
concerned. My understanding is that Motherwell would have readily agreed
to switch the league game to Sunday -- and then, suddenly, the Parkhead
men were hit by the decision which said they will play Rangers on
Tuesday.
Burns, though, stoically refuses to hide behind these real problems.
He is not looking for excuses, although he is entitled so to do.
Instead, he will simply look at his players this morning and then decide
which of them has suffered less on the journey back to Glasgow.
Some will be rested. And, of course, central defender John Hughes is
out after having been ordered off at Pittodrie last Sunday. Ex-Queen's
Park man Malcolm Mackay looks sure to take over at the heart of the
defence alongside Tommy Boyd.
There could be other chances as well, because Burns may have Pierre
van Hooydonk, who missed the game in Georgia, ready to return if he has
shaken off the hamstring problem which kept him at home.
The return leg with Batumi will be pushed on to the back burner at the
moment. However, while Burns will not say so, he must know that his team
is through to the next round.
The way they performed on the Black Sea coast must have given him and
his players heart for the rest of the campaign, which now could stretch
at least until the Spring.
Three goals away from home in any European tie cannot be
underestimated. Just ask any of the teams who failed to do as well as
Burns and his men.

TWO members of Europe's Ryder Cup side next week lead the way at the
halfway stage of the British Masters at Collingtree Park. But four
others, including defending champion Ian Woosnam, missed the cut.
Sam Torrance, enjoying the finest sustained spell of his career, sank
a curling 35-foot birdie putt on the last hole of his second round for a
66 and an 11-under-par aggregate of 133.
Team-mate Mark James is one behind along with Spaniard Santiago Luna
following a 67, but Woosnam, called up to replace the injured Jose Maria
Olazabal, failed to qualify, and so did David Gilford and Bernard
Gallacher's two rookies, Irishman Philip Walton and Swede Per-Ulrik
Johansson.
Walton signed off by taking 9 at the 543-yard eighteenth -- it
included a two-shot penalty for grounding his club in a hazard -- while
Woosnam, needing to hole a nine-foot birdie putt to survive,
three-putted for a bogey 6.
Torrance, starting with his Irish Open victory in July, has played 38
rounds and is a cumulative 91 under par.
''I felt great today,'' said the Scot, at 42 the oldest member of the
Ryder Cup side. ''My dad said 10 years ago that I would play my best
golf in my forties and he was right.
''At the time I didn't believe him, but I didn't disbelieve him
either. I'm driving great and I've worked a lot on my chipping. If you
chip well you don't mind missing the green.''
A case in point was the 543-yard fourteenth. On the fringe in two
Torrance chipped in from 15 feet for an eagle 3.
James was playing two matches ahead and he also had an eagle, hitting
a No.4-iron shot to 15 feet on the 498-yard ninth. It took the
41-year-old to the turn in 32, but a No.9-iron shot to five feet on the
eleventh was his only further move forward.
Asked when the butterflies start churning in Ryder Cup week James, who
at Oak Hill earns his seventh cap, replied: ''My biggest problem is
getting pumped up. I've no idea how to do that. I'll have to speak to
the doctor, I suppose.''
The form of Torrance and James is good news for Gallacher, and so is
that of Seve Ballesteros, who after missing six of his previous eight
halfway cuts had a second successive 69 to be on six under par.
''I will have to call St Andrews to lower my handicap,'' said the
smiling Spaniard, who is on the same mark as Colin Montgomerie. Howard
Clark, the other Ryder Cup man in the field, was content as well after
recording another 70.
Round of the day came from Ulsterman Darren Clarke. Eagle putts of 30
and 20 feet helped the 27-year-old to a course record 62 and into a
share of fourth place with Des Smyth, Jon Lomas and Stephen Ames.

AS well as putting behind them a disappointing result in their opening
Champions' League game in midweek, Rangers almost certainly will have to
resume domestic business at Falkirk today without Brian Laudrup, who
suffered a thigh strain in the 1-0 defeat by Steaua Bucharest on
Wednesday.
The Danish internationalist will be given every chance to make it, but
manager Walter Smith was not making optimistic sounds.
Striker Mark Hateley, who missed the European game, went through a
cartilage operation yesterday and at the same time a minor ankle problem
was being cleared up. The combination still should not keep him out of
action more than four or five weeks, but in the meantime Oleg Salenko is
likely to get his chance to establish his claim to a regular place.
The Russian and his former Soviet Union team-mate, Alexei
Mikhailichenko, are in line to play against Falkirk in a side that could
show a few changes from midweek. Whoever is on the park, Smith expects
them to concentrate on the job in hand and relegate Europe and any other
extraneous to the back burner for the time being.
''We must not allow Europe, or the League Cup for that matter, to
deflect us from what is our prime objective, to retain the league
championship,'' maintained Smith. ''We have started well with two wins
and we want to keep that going.''
Smith has a healthy respect for Falkirk who, he recalled, invariably
force Rangers into a tight game, and expects a similar scenario this
afternoon.
Fakirk manager John Lambie looks upon the meeting with the champions
with some relish, knowing that the atmosphere of the day will have its
effect on his players. ''They will respond to the occasion,'' he said,
''and to be fair to them, they have worked hard all week. We have to be
better organised and I know that I will need to find another defender,
but that won't be before this game.''
In fact, Lambie is heading for England next week to look at one he has
in mind. He could have done with him today as Joe McLaughlin has been
ruled out.
''It will be tough, but playing a team like Rangers nobody expects you
to win, so it might just be coming at the right time for us,'' added
Lambie.
Falkirk's former manager, Jim Jefferies, takes his team to Lambie's
former haunt, Firhill, in good fettle, and the news of one of his Hearts
players, Kevin Thomas, will cheer him even more. Thomas suffered a very
bad knee ligament injury last April and was exected to be out for a year
at least, but he is back in light training months ahead of schedule.
''I am not rushing things, but I hope to be able to play again before
the end of the year,'' said 20-year Thomas, who is another in the
conveyor belt of promising youngsters, two of whom, Alan Johnston and
Gary Locke, have established their first-team spots.
In contrast, the club's longest serving player, Gary Mackay, who has
been suffering from a back injury, will be checked out this morning.
Thistle have four players doubtful, Roddy McDonald, Steve Pittman,
Tommy Turner and Albert Craig. Pittman is one of three players yet to
accept terms -- Ian Cameron and Derek McWilliams are the others -- after
Alan Dinnie agreed a new one-year deal this week.
Kilmarnock, uncharacteristically, have struggled to get into their
stride so far and can expect a tough afternoon from UEFA Cup contenders
Raith Rovers, who beat Akranes 3-1 at Stark's Park on Tuesday. Killie
striker Steve Maskrey is still out, but Colin McKee is fit to return.
Raith will miss defender Shaun Dennis, who was hurt in midweek.

PROMOTER Frank Maloney is set to issue a #150,000 challenge to former
world champion Chris Eubank to fight unbeaten American Montell Griffin.
''I'm contacting Eubank's lawyer this morning before I fly back to
America to re-join Lennox Lewis, with an offer of #150,000 for Eubank to
fight Griffin at light-heavyweight,'' said Maloney.
''Eubank keeps saying he wants to move up from super-middleweight to
light-heavyweight.
''Well, here's his chance to establish himself in that division -- and
make some good money at the same time.
''The fight will be in London, and we can get it on before
Christmas.''
Chicago-based Griffin, who holds a decision over former double world
champion James Toney, earlier this week took his record to 17 straight
wins with a sixth-round stoppage of Hunter Clay at Battersea.
He had the experienced Clay down at the end of the fourth and again in
the sixth from a series of body punches.
Eubank failed in a bid to regain his WBO super-middleweight title from
Steve Collins in Cork two weeks ago, and his camp have talked about the
Brighton-based boxer stepping up a weight.

IT has been all go for Gordon Dalziel recently, in charge of Ayr
United while the search goes on for a replacement for former manager
Simon Stainrod.
Dalziel took and afternoon off yesterday to relax for he will be
included in the injury-hit Ayr line-up today for the visit to Stirling
Albion, who will have winger Ian McInnes, suspended in midweek, back.
East Fife, unbeaten, could be on dangerous ground when they visit a
full-strength Stranraer, of whom manager Alex McAnespie said: ''We have
now found form.''
Charlie Nicholas will again lead Clyde, who add Graham Watson and Paul
Paterson to the pool for the match at Montrose.
Berwick have winger Kevin Kane available to face Stenhousemuir, who
will be without Max Christie. Forfar will freshen their side to meet
Queen of the South, who have John Mclaren and Kevin Hetherington
returning.
Third division Albion Rovers, told yesterday by their own advisers
that they should sell up and move into a new stadium with Airdrie, are
away to Ross County, while another side with problems, Cowdenbeath, were
shocked yesterday when Dom Maratea said that he was quitting football.
In addition Eddie Petrie is again unsettled at not getting a transfer
move.
Manager Tom Steven said: ''Dom has told me he is not interested in the
game any more. I had asked him to keep playing for another month to help
us over our injuries and give him a chance to think closely about it.
But he just wants to stop playing.''
Livingston have no problems but manager Jim Leishman will freshen his
side to face Alloa, while East Stirling are without eight of their
first-team squad as they head for Queen's Park.
Queen's are without Ross Caven who has a thigh injury. Arbroath will
be unchanged as they face Caledonian Thistle.

ALTHOUGH they were beaten by Celtic in a memorable meeting at
Pittodrie last Sunday, Aberdeen will travel to the capital to face Hibs
in confident enough mood -- and not just because they earned a great
deal of praise for what was a thrilling six-goal contest.
The club's share issue is going well and manager Roy Aitken can
anticipate a sizeable cash budget as a result with which to bring in new
faces.
The share launch, due to end next week, is expected to raise at least
#2.5m and chairman Ian Donald said: ''If the manager came to see me
today and wanted a certain player we are now in a position to back
him.''
Aitken, who has two or three players in mind, among them #1m-rated
Scottish midfielder Paul Bernard of Oldham, will name an unchanged team
for Easter Road but will also insist on tightening up in defence.
Hibs, despite the fact that they were knocked out of the Coca-Cola Cup
by first division Airdrie, are nurturing quiet ambitons about the
premier championship this season, although manager Alex Miller would
never enter into such speculation. His team, none the less, have looked
good in two league games away from home, drawing at Firhill when they
were unlucky not to win handsomely, and beating Kilmarnock 3-0 at Rugby
Park.
Striker Keith Wright believes the current side is ready for anything.
''I am sure we will be better than ever this season,'' said the man who
scored twice last week, ''and if you forget that Airdrie performance, we
have played really well. We had appalling away form last year, yet were
only pipped for second place by a point.''
It will be a special day for keeper Jim Leighton, making his 100th
appearance for the club, ironically against his old team.

LIZ McColgan will attempt to present further evidence of the revival
of her endurance running career tomorrow by beating the newly-crowned
world marathon champion, Manuela Machado, and by breaking a half
marathon record held by her coach, Grete Waitz.
But she has lost the spur of Scottish rival, Yvonne Murray, whose
presence would have presented a sharp goad.
As Norwegian Waitz, McColgan's new mentor, arrived on Tyneside
yesterday to watch her protege in the Great North Run, Murray was
revealed as a non-starter -- the second significant defector from the
women's race following the withdrawal of Australia's double Commonwealth
marathon champion, Lisa Ondieki.
The organisers, with consequent unspent funds, now seek a late
transfusion of additional talent to the BUPA-backed event. But the
current African championships, and upcoming World Half-marathon
Championships, significantly limit the available options.
Even without Murray, who has ended her season after the diagnosis of
swollen glands and a cold, McColgan faces a severe examination by
Portugal's world champion, Machado.
At the peak of her powers in 1992, McColgan posted three times which
rank among the 10 fastest ever. One of these, 69min 53sec, on this
course, fell just four seconds short of Waitz's record.
The sharp end of the men's race, weather permitting, features a world
record attempt between Kenya's Moses Tanui and Benson Masya, repectively
fastest and second fastest ever.
A silicon chip, developed so that pig farmers could keep track of
their stock, will be given a test run for the first time in the UK. In
mass fields those who start further back are always faced with official
performances in excess of their actual one, due to the time taken for a
cast of thousands to reach the start.
''A chip attached to shoe laces will transmit a message to antenae in
a special tartan strip on the start and finish lines,'' said race
director John Caine. The device can be hired at a cost of #3 and could
be used to provide split times for each individual mile for every
participant in mass races.
* LINFORD Christie, who insists his championship career is over, ran
his fastest 100 metres of the year, 10.00sec, at the lucrative Tokyo
international meeting yesterday. Canada's respective World silver and
gold medallists, Bruny Surin and Donovan Bailey, were timed at 10.02 and
10.09.

GILLIAN Stewart led a rewarding day for the Scots when she completed a
six-under-par 67 to share the lead with Marie-Laure de Lorenzi in the
Dutch Open at Nijmegen.
Morag Wright was close behind following her 69 while Cathy
Panton-Lewis and Tracey Craik had 71s, and Julie Forbes recovered for a
72 after having been three over par after only three holes.
Stewart holed from 15 feet for a birdie at the first hole before
adding four more birdies in five holes from the fifth to be out in 32.
At the long eleventh, Stewart found the green in two, but
three-putted, then redeemed this lapse with a birdie 3 at the fifteenth.
After a birdie at the fourth, Wright then had three birdies in a row
from the tenth, and then saved her 4 from sand at the fifteenth.
Leading scores (British and Irish unless otherwise stated):
67 -- M-L de Lorenzi (France), G Stewart.
69 -- S Bennett, N Moult, S Waugh (Australia), L Tadiotto (Belgium), M
Wright, A Brighouse, F Pike (Australia).
70 -- K Pearce (Australia), F Dassu (Italy), M Hageman (Holland), T
Loveys, S Dallongeville (France).
71 -- P Gonzalez (Colombia), D Dowling, L Weima (Holland), D Barnard,
S Gronberg (Sweden), R Hetherington (Australia), R Comstock (USA), M
Preti (Italy), L Maritz-Atkins (S Africa), L Fairclough, C Panton-Lewis,
L Brooky (New Zealand), T Craik, N Buxton.
72 -- E Knuth (Spain), S Moon (USA), D Booker (Australia), S Yamamoto
(Japan), F Fehlauer (Germany), M Sutton, K Speak, J Forbes, C Hall, J
Morley, S Head.
Other Scottish scores: 74 -- L Irvine. 78 -- K Ross.
SCOTLAND'S Dale Reid shot a third-round 75 on a day of high scoring in
the preliminary tournament for the LPGA qualifying school at Mission
Hills in California.
Reid, who needs only to finish in the top 30, holds third place on
216, level par, eight strokes behind American Holly Reynolds. Corinne
Dibnah, a former British Open champion from Australia, is in eighth
place on 219 following a 72.

THE start of a new season always bring an air of expectancy of good
things to come. The new men's hockey campaign which begins today could
well prove to be the most productive of the decade.
For a start the sports legislators have taken the bold step to
brighten up the game. No longer will defenders be penalised by conceding
a penalty corner for putting the ball over the by-line while off-side
has been abandoned as an experiment of the season.
Then the most exciting aspect of the new season is the emergence of
some real talent and a new commitment by clubs to lift the standard
after the disastrous Nissan European Nations Cup campaign last month
where Scotland crashed to 10th, its worst ranking in a decade.
The memory of that disaster is being quickly erased by the form of the
principle championship contenders like Western, Touche Ross Gordonians,
MIM and defending champions Grange.
Having won the Women's National Hockey League on each of the past 13
years it is only natural that the Wester Klick Photopoint captain
Margery Coutts is confident ''it will be the same again'' come the
spring.

BACK to basics would seem the order of the day for at least four teams
in today's Division 1 programme.
Back to the formation which has given Dunfermline a 100% record so far
-- they experimented in midweek against Forfar in the Challenge Cup and
were close to coming a cropper.
Back to the idea that Dundee will hit you like a whirlwind early on,
and probably take the lead. Keeping it is another matter.
Back to the problem facing St Johnstone -- a good defence being put
under severe pressure because the forwards are not scoring.
Back to the worry that faces Hamilton Accies manager, Iain Munro, who
has yet to pick up a league point and has only one goal in the bank.
Bert Paton, the Dunfermline manager, admitted that his midweek
experiment had backfired. ''We will return to the system that has been
successful so far, although I don't think we have been playing as well
as we can. This will be a tough match at Love Street. St Mirren always
play football.''
Saints lost to Jim Leishman's Livingston in midweek, but manager Jimmy
Bone looks forward to today's game and stressed that if his strikers can
begin to hit the target, the Paisley side would be a force.
The Perth Saints face a similar problem. They, according to manager
Paul Sturrock, played some of their best football of the season, but
still lost to Clydebank in midweek -- without scoring. Dundee United
head for Kilbowie without Dave Bowman and Craig Brewster.
Hamilton's visit to Dens Park to face Dundee cannot appeal to a side
whose biggest fault seems to be lack of confidence.Dundee will miss the
injured Morten Weighorst and Gerry Britton. Defender Roddy Manley may
return. Airdrie will face a test of character at Broadwood when the
free-flowng Greenock Morton make their visit.

MELROSE coach Rob Moffat has bucked the trend developing within the
ranks of Scotland's top clubs with a hefty vote of confidence for the
new premiership set-up.
Moffat, whose side compete in today's glamour match at Myreside
against championship leaders Watsonians, underscored the high confidence
factor evident at the Greenyards with a ringing declaration that the 25%
attrition rate which has put the wind up so many of his premiership
rivals does not have to mean negative rugby and that the increased
competitiveness can only be good for the game.
''Eight teams, with two facing relegation, means that every game means
something. This is a very interesting league and I'm all for it. Those
who say otherwise are concentrating too much on the negative aspects.
''The tension and the fact that the premiership will be decided by the
middle of November means that we should be playing on good surfaces and
that must be good for the spectators.
''Last season, when only eight from 14 were guaranteed a place in the
top division, people said that this would mean boring rugby, but if they
were still saying that at the end of the season then they weren't at the
same games as me.
''It's early days yet and there are still lots of games to go, but the
way things are shaping up I think it is true to say that any side is
capable of beating the others.
Watsonians are the only unbeaten side just now, but if they can keep
that record once we are well into the championship, then I would have to
say that would be a miraculous achievement.''
Melrose have had Watsonians watched on each of their three games thus
far and Moffat has a pretty clear idea of how they will play it today.
He has, too, a very clear idea of how his side will attempt to end
'Sonians unbeaten run but, not surprisingly, he chooses to keep that to
himself.
Watsonians, on the verge of a bright new commercial future, were
yesterday counting not cash but the cost of their record win over
Heriot's on Wednesday night.
Lock Colin Campbell was the major casualty, a sprung collar bone being
confirmed, and he will be out for the duration.
However, the other Wednesday night casualties, Jamie Weston (knee),
Scott Hastings (shin), and Stuart Mather (ribs) are fit enough to be
included in today's 19-strong squad.
Melrose were already without lock Euan Simpson, who is unavailable
because of veterinary duties (although he has said that this will be the
only occasion when work will interfere with play), and yesterday Derek
Lunn was drafted into the side at tight-head prop, Kevin Allan having
not recovered from the shoulder injury sustained against Hawick on
Wednesday.
Meanwhile, whatever the extent of the relief that defending champions
Stirling County may have felt in their first league win over Edinburgh
Accies on Wednesday night has not inhibited the selectors in revising
the team for today's visit to Gala.
Gareth Flockhart, who will attend the international squad session at
Murrayfield tomorrow and who was on Scotland's summer tour to Zimbabwe,
has given way to David Elliot at wing forward, whereas Angus Turner, the
Glasgow wing who missed Wednesday's win because of business, returns in
place of Scott Crawford.
Gala name a 19-man squad, flying in the face of entreaties by rugby
director Johnny Gray at the start of the season, when Watsonians did
likewise, that perming 15 from 19 on match-day would not become the
norm.
Heriot's, recovering from that 43-0 thrashing by Watsonians at
Goldenacre on Wednesday, have called up David Lewis, another of their
New Zealand recruits, for the tussle with Edinburgh Academicals at
Raeburn Place. John Robertson is recalled at breakaway wing-forward.
Edinburgh Accies, beaten 17-6 by Stirling on Wednesday, feature a back
division along familiar lines but list a squad of 12 forwards, injuries
preventing the naming of a starting pack line-up until today.
Boroughmuir, who kept up the chase on the pace-setting Watsonians by
beating Gala 25-10 at Meggetland in midweek, have drafted Grant Wilson
and Darren Burns back into the pack for the Mansfield Park match against
Hawick, who have had to make a change at scrum half as Kevin Reid has a
Fire Brigade interview. Alan Gray deputises.
Division II leaders Jed-Forest, who like Currie have an unbeaten
record, today meet Kelso at Poynder Park in a Border derby, while Currie
are at Burnbrae, where West of Scotland seek to build upon that midweek
victory over GHK.

PHEW! At last a win, and we needed it badly. After two defeats we
wanted that victory over Edinburgh Accies on Wednesday night very much
indeed.
The doubters were beginning to say ''we told you so.'' They reckoned
that Stirling were one-season wonders. Hopefully, now we have a base on
which to build and we will be able to prove them wrong.
Of course, there's a lot of pressure on the champions, but what people
have to remember is that at the very top level we are a young club and,
especially for the less experienced players, living with that pressure
is very much part of the growing up process.
The new premiership is shaping up to become a real dog-fight. We knew
that it would, of course, but so far as I'm concerned, one of the plus
points to the home and away format is that, unlike last year when the
top teams played each other only once, now, if you are beaten in the
first half of the season, then there exists the opportunity for revenge
next time around.
The new league has thrown up some pretty strange results with lots of
sides going down at home. Nobody would have predicted that at the start
of the season.
Today we travel down to Gala and we don't expect an easy passage.
Gala were written off at the start of the season, but then they
grabbed a draw at Raeburn Place against Edinburgh Academicals, who were
seen by many as dark horses for the championship. On paper there's no
accounting for that but, as many scribes and pundits often forget, we're
not playing on paper.
Watsonians, who are setting the pace just now, have Melrose at
Myreside, and although Watsonians must start as favourites, only a fool
would write off Melrose.
If Melrose do get a win today then that is the league blown wide open
and the hunt is on, once again, with a vengeance.
The professionalism issue rears its head again this weekend with a
series of meetings at Murrayfield.
The SRU were meeting the clubs last night, and tomorrow, at the first
international squad session of the season, Scotland's International
Board representative Fred McLeod has said that he will talk to the
players.
We're desperate to hear what he's got to say. Some of us had a brief
meeting with him just as the debate was hotting up, but this will be the
first time since then that the entire squad will have had an opportunity
to get the low-down from the horse's mouth. And I know Freddie won't
mind me saying that!
Until now we've been getting our information from the press and, with
the exception of this column, we all know that you can't believe
everything that you read in the papers.
I'm certainly not going into the meeting with Freddie with a
pre-conceived idea about how much the SRU will pay the international
players. That will, no doubt, be a matter for negotiation.
However, what I can say is that we must hammer out a deal which
doesn't put us at too much of a disadvantage when it comes to playing
other countries whose players will be virtually full-time professionals.
However, if we are to believe what the French rugby boss Bernard
Lapasset is saying, then that won't include France.
He's said that rugby in France will remain amateur. Pull the other
one, Bernard. That is rank hypocrisy, because we all know that French
players are paid -- and have been for years.
I was out with big Shade Munro at the weekend -- comics please note --
and, of course, I've got no first-hand knowledge of this, but he was
telling me that he's still struggling with his groin.
I reckon that if things go badly at GHK then he's going to throw in
his lot -- and his groin -- with whoever the league leaders turn out to
be. Cunning. A joke, Shadey, honest!

ALREADY this season we see the pressure that teams are under in the
SRU Tennents Premiership, and the parallels with football and some of
its battles are so obvious they jump up and whack you in the face.
I always look at Mark Hateley of Rangers, for he has, unquestionably,
been the most effective soccer player in Scotland over the last few
years. Outstanding in the air and on the ground, he has more pace than
many a man half his age and size, and yet, strangely, he hasn't been
deemed good enough to play for England for some time.
The obvious conclusion is that we aren't very good at football in this
country, and a fairly good Englishman who can dance around his less able
Scottish opponents is very good box office and well worth the money. Or
so it would seem.
The question I'd ask is: Where the heck do you take all of this? In
rugby, as the clubs suddenly find themselves in the mother of all
seasons, it has been glaringly obvious over the last few days that more
and more clubs are reeling in unknown antipodeans and others to bolster
their chances of success or survival. Most of the clubs have negotiated
deals with sponsors which disappear if they go down a division, and it's
panic, panic, panic and sign the cheques.
Last Saturday, I watched Darren George, Boroughmuir's New Zealand
lineout man, take more two-handed lineout ball in a game of rugby than I
have ever seen before. And I mean ever. And yet I had never heard of
Darren George.
Terry Rahui won the game for Heriot's last Saturday. I had never heard
of Terry Rahui. GHK have Cecil du Plessis. Never heard of him.
Melrose fielded Wellington player Isaac Feaunati on Wednesday night.
He only arrived on Monday. Never heard of him either. And there are lots
more.
Don't get me wrong, but this isn't a long-term solution to anything
and if one hired gun can win a game, there really is sod all point in
the other 29 people turning up.
Contrast that, if you will, with the sight of Gregor Townsend and
Michael Dods, maybe or maybe not going south to play their game.
Let's dwell on Dods. I spoke to him in New Zealand a while ago and it
is glaringly obvious that the opportunities he got out there to practise
his rugby far outweigh any he may have back here. He had an hour and a
half practising goal kicks at lunch-time on Carisbrook. He worked beside
Jamie Joseph at Speight's breweries, which I don't think was
particularly ''time challenged,'' and Otago, his team, trained three
afternoons a week.
Let's now dwell on Townsend who, on his day, is as good as anything in
the world. But he was, until recently, a student at Edinburgh University
and time, for him, was at a premium. But the top English rugby clubs,
like top English football clubs, can't survive on signing what might be
ordinary players and so they have tried to attract our top players, like
Townsend. Craig Chalmers says he has been tapped, too.
I find it very odd then that, as a country, we let our best players go
down south and we replace them with average foreigners, who come as
hired guns to give us a quick fix.
Surely to goodness the solution is staring us in the face, and that is
that we have to recognise that we in this country still don't really
take our sport all that seriously, no matter how much we table thump
about all the football issues and other things. We don't give our
youngsters a chance to blossom like more sports orientated countries do.
Frankly, I don't want to go and watch four New Zealanders, two of whom
may be eligible to play for Scotland, helping Watsonians to win games.
It devalues it for me.
At the moment it doesn't take a staggering amount of ability to be an
import into Scotland and look really good. And that, I'm afraid to say,
is what I always remember as I watch Mark Hateley, or one of rugby's
hired guns, right now.

THE silent majority spoke last night on the vexed question of
professionalism -- and the silence was deafening.
The Scottish Rugby Union, as part of the consultation process designed
to steer the game into the 21st century, had called a Murrayfield
meeting at which all of the 102 clubs within its aegis were to be
canvassed for their views on pay-for-play, transfer fees, win bonuses,
registration of players, and all the rest.
The meeting was trailed by SRU president Dr Iain Todd as ''historic''
and one of the most important in the annals of the game. It lasted 35
minutes and elicited just three questions from the floor.
A couple of pointers for the future were provided, namely that any
Scottish player who follows the money trail south might put his
international career in jeopardy and that a moratorium on payments
beneath international level is the most probably course of action for
the Scottish game.
Nevertheless, the Murrayfield hierarchy were obviously disappointed at
the marked lack of guidance offered from the floor. Whether the issues
involved were too complex for discussion in such an open forum or
whether the clubs are just too confused to make any kind of reasoned
contribution to the debate is now merely a matter for conjecture.
The only guidance which the union were given on how to proceed was
that on a show of hands, asked for by IB representative Fred McLeod,
whereby the vast majority indicated that they favoured a season-long
moratorium on player-payment at all but national squad level.
''That seems to be almost unanimous and that, in itself, is very
helpful,'' said McLeod.
He had earlier given the meeting a briefing on the IB decision to
declare the game open once last month's Paris Declaration is ratified
when the board meets again in Tokyo next week.
''The purpose of tonight's meeting is to gather feed-back from the
clubs on how you see the way ahead,'' he said. And as it neared its
premature end with a marked lack of the feed-back which McLeod and the
union were seeking he was moved to remark: ''I can't believe this.''
Todd, meanwhile, declared: ''I'm surprised that there have been no
more questions raised. This is a minefield and we are taking the first
tentative steps into it.
''In Scotland there is a limited amount of money available at club
level and from what I have heard during my tours around the districts
these past few weeks they are not going to pay their players at club
level. However, I must say that I am surprised there have been so few
questions tonight. I fully expected there to have been more.''
McLeod said that he was meeting the international squad tomorrow, but
he was adamant that the financial stability of the union and the
Scottish game would not be sacrificed for a ''handful of individuals,
whoever they may be.''
''Everything will be considered before anything is offered to one
group and we will only pay what we can afford to pay. We are certainly
not meeting the international squad on Sunday with a view to coming to
an arrangement with them before we have talked to all of the other
groups that have to be talked to.''
McLeod said that, after next week's Tokyo meeting, all groups involved
in the game -- referees, medical staff and administrators -- would be
approached for their views before any decisions were taken.
There would also have to be an extraordinary general meeting of the
union, at which the new by-laws -- which could include provision for
amateur status in large sections of the game -- would be ratified.
He also hinted that some form of registration might be brought in
which would tie players with aspirations to play international rugby to
the Scottish club scene.
Former Scotland internationalist Keith Roberton of the Melrose club --
who was one of the three questioners -- had declared that he was in
favour of a moratorium on payment at club level, but he was concerned
that Scotland might be placed at a disadvantage if neighbouring
countries did not follow suit.
McLeod said: ''The move by Sir John Hall, buying over
Newcastle-Gosforth, is obviously a matter for concern and I can
understand that the Border clubs in particular might be afraid that they
would lose players to a professional Newcastle.
''However, Newcastle may have to accept the implications for them,
which may turn out to be contrary to what the RFU decides at the end of
the day.
''Additionally, players may have to decide whether they want to be
international players for Scotland or top club players in England,
because I can assure you that the demands of the national coaching
director, Jim Telfer, will be met.
''I would canvass all players not to venture into agreements outwith
this country which might jeopardise or interfere with his commitment to
the national squad.''

THE worst kept secret in Scottish rugby was finally confirmed
yesterday with an announcement from Watsonians that millionaire
businessman John Connor is to invest in the club this season.
However, at #50,000, the sum involved falls some way short of the
#100,000-#200,000 which has been widely touted in the media these past
few months -- a figure which Connor and those close to him did little to
correct.
Nevertheless, the #50,000 now lodged with championship leaders
Watsonians represents a notable first for the game in Scotland. And with
a similar sum also reported to be going to Currie from the same sponsor,
his investment in the game is considerable.
The club also confirmed that Hastings International Ltd, the new
business venture of former Scotland captain Gavin Hastings, has been
appointed as a consultant at Myreside to develop commercial and
sponsorship activities as well and maintaining and developing the
profile of Watsonians.
Connor said: ''I am mindful that this figure will not in itself ensure
the success that Watsonians crave. I hope, though, that it will assist
them in a positive way.''

WHEN she retired from her sport, overcome by pressure of expectation
aged 16, Joyce Gordon was already a Scottish senior judo
internationalist and UK junior No.1. Yet despite 10 years off the mat --
marriage, nursing career, and two Caesarian sections later -- she heads
for the world judo championships in Japan on Monday with the title in
her sights, and thoughts already on next year's Olympics.
Now Joyce Heron, and almost 31, she travels as reigning world and
European bronze medallist in the 48-kilo class, with every chance of
up-grading the colour of her medal as she bids to secure an Atlanta
place.
A shy, soft-spoken waif, standing only 4ft 10in. high and weighing a
fraction more than seven stones, she is an improbable sporting heroine,
but the Paisley-born mother of seven and 10-year old daughters is a
tigress in the dojo, or judo gym.
Even in a sport where toughness and aggression are the norm, she
provokes gasps of awe -- similar, one imagines, to the impression she
made on the boys who teased her at school 20 years ago, then were decked
by this slip of a lassie.
Like young bucks chasing a reputation, by challenging veteran Western
gun-slingers, invariably lads in Hunterhill, where she grew up, wanted
to try their luck.
''One boy teased me for four months before I gave him a hiding,''
recalls Joyce. ''We were the best of pals after. I've never had a
problem with anyone as an adult.''
No wonder. While the kids are in school, she trains 15 hours a week.
In the gym she squats with 90kg on her back -- double her normal body
weight -- 25 repetitions with the equivalent of almost two hundredweight
sacks of coal, and 25 bench-press reps, explosive bursts of energy
driving 60kg away from her petite frame each time.
Introduced to the sport by her dad at the age of nine, she scarcely
looks to have aged since school, to the amusement of her elder daughter.
At a ballet class, oblivious to mum's pleas to shut up, Suzanne urged:
''Tell them you're 30, mum -- I don't want them to think you're young.''
Yet occasionally her body feels the years: hands so painful she can
scarcely grip the jacket -- she has dislocated five fingers over the
years. And when she bared her right arm, there was a huge bruise, where
Scotland's 6ft 4in. coach, Colin McIver, accidently crushed her during a
recent work-out. As usual, there was not a murmer of complaint.
''She is quite incredible,'' says McIver, formerly Britain's head
coach and now chief executive of Scottish Judo. ''To be out of the sport
for 10 years, have two children, then come back and master all the new
techniques is remarkable -- the hardest task I've had is to stop her
over-training. Joyce wanted to win so much that she was burning herself
out.
''Very occasionally, she will break down in tears when training. When
I ask what's wrong, she'll tell me. But she never volunteers she is in
pain, or asks to stop.''
''I don't like to be considered a wimp,'' she insists. ''You learn to
live with pain, though maybe a couple of days a year it gets
unbearable.''
Nobody could accuse her of being soft. Scotland has only 200
competitive female players, perhaps 2000 in Britain. ''It's the physical
contact -- women don't like it,'' adds Joyce. ''But I do. It's one thing
which appeals to me.''
Because of her strength and speed, Heron is considered unorthodox,
these attributes overshadowing skill at any particular throw or hold.
She takes opponents to ground, where her fitness almost invariably
tells, often with the strangle-hold, shime-waza.
Japan will be no culture shock. Backing from the Foundation for Sport
and the Arts funded training last year at Budo University, exclusively
for martial arts.
In the forthcoming championships she faces the Japanese world champion
and runner-up, plus the other defending bronze medal-winner. But Joyce
is a better player now than two years ago, when she had only just
completed her rehabilitation to the sport: ''I started back just for
fun, without a thought of competing. I'm much more mature now than when
I packed it in as a girl.
''I know I'm capable of being among the medals. I need to, to gain a
good Olympic seeding. There's no additional pressure knowing I must
finish in the first eight to ensure Britain is allowed to compete at all
in my class in Atlanta next year.''
She can't be complacent, for even assuming success in Japan, the
Olympic place could go to Sarah Flynn, the Great Britain No.2, whose
mentor is Neil Adams, the former double Olympic silver medal-winner and
world champion, now Britain's chief coach.
When she leaves for Chiba on Monday, husband Patrick, a leading radio
operator with the Royal Navy, will tune in to domestic chores at their
Rosyth home, having taken three weeks' leave. ''I gave up quite a lot
when we got married -- my home, and nursing. Patrick's happy to do this
for me, though he misses me -- I'd be worried if he didn't.''

FEW people, not even the man himself, could have envisaged the day
when the name Nicholas would appear on a Scottish second division team
list but, if you are suprised at that, Charlie has genuinely been taken
aback by how much he is enjoying it.
The man, whose virtuosity with Celtic in particular, Arsenal, and
Aberdeen to a lesser extent, made him one of the most celebrated players
of his generation, took a long time to persuade himself that he should
join an old friend, Clyde manager Alex Smith, in the lower regions of
the Scottish League, an area he had never experienced in 16 seasons
among the elite of the game on both sides of the Border.
Since he decided to leave Celtic, where he was no longer a contender
for the first team, his choice in his own mind was to retire, or take up
Smith's invitation. ''There were one or two foreign offers, but I have
businesses here and my family is here.
''I felt I had done my moving and either I was quitting or joining
Clyde. In the end, I still wanted to play, and I have not regretted it
for a minute. I am enjoying myself a lot in this league and I am content
and happy for the moment and we will see what happens for the future.''
The biggest suprise, perhaps, for Nicholas has been the standard of
player in the division which is two leagues below his usual residence.
''That has been a pleasant, unexpected bonus for me. Here at Clyde there
are a few players who have real promise and I can honestly say they
would stand comparison with some of the younger lads at Parkhead -- and
I got to know them well enough in my last season there.
''They are mainly all young kids, like Jim Brown, who was at Rangers.
Alex Smith is a lucky man to get him. He looks a real quality player,
certainly at our level. He looks too good for this league already and he
is only 19.
''Kenny Gillies, who was at St Mirren is one, and another is Tommy
Harrison, who was to have been a big star at Hearts but suffered a bad
injury. Martin O'Neill is on the fringe of the internaional side. These
four have bright chances of making it. They have the qualities to play
at the highest level. Now I have played four league games, I have told
Alex how much I have been taken aback by the standard of player he has.
''Maybe the fact that they are full time at Clyde is a big bonus for
them. I have had a great kick out of playing alongside them. I am
playing really well myself. Alex just told me to and play and try to get
things organised. Some of the younger guys can do a bit of extra running
on my behalf.''
Nicholas feels as if he has been with the Broadwood club a season
rather than a few weeks, but it is too early yet to say if he will see
out the two-year contract Clyde gave him. The arrangement between him
and Smith is typically fluid. If Charlie wants to pack it in at the end
of the season, for instance, he and the manager will shake hands and
that will be that.
As of this moment, that is not looking odds on. His influence on the
Clyde players has been such that the team is sitting in fourth place
and, according to the new boy, getting better. Nicholas, as you might
expect of one whose ear-ring and sockless appearance caused its own
little ripple in his heyday, has not had much trouble becoming part of
thedressing room scene at Broadwood. Charlie believes in encouragement
rather than harassing.
''On the field, I believe I am good at giving the lads encouragement.
If they miss chances, that's not the time to bawl at them, it's time to
egg them on.
''I enjoy the fact that when lads come off the park they say to me
that they appreciated that I was complimenting rather than criticising.
The other thing I have that I think they appreciate is my hatred of
losing. That has always been my style. I hate getting beat at
training.''
He has agreed with Smith that he will do his best to get the team up
into the first division and then, if his legs are feeling the strain, he
will sit and talk out the next move with the manager.
''I won't be holding them to a ransom to stay for the two years, but
at the moment I am having fun.''
If any of the young men in his vicinity do get special offers to move
on, they would need to look further afield to find a more authoritative
adviser than their new striker.
Likewise, the 33-year-old Nicholas can see a little of the 19-year-old
Charlie in some of the boys in the club. ''There are certain things like
kids trying to impress to get into the first team, just as I did in my
time. Maybe they try something stupid, that Pele could not manage, and
they will learn it is best to do the simple things, as I was told by
people like Danny McGrain. Just be yourself, you don't need to impress
people.''
His philosophy in dealing with the younger generation has been to make
things simple because not everyone can understand the intricacies of
technique and tactical play. In his last 18 months at Parkhead, Charlie
found himself among the apprentice stars and enjoyed the experience.
''I have always been one for talking to the kids anyway. I remember I
used to go into reserve team dressing room at Arsenal and have a chat
with the boys. My career shows that I have never properly fulfilled what
I should have done, but at the same time I have never changed much. I
have accepted the criticism and always managed to stay happy. It is only
a game of bloody football after all.''
Nicholas has admitted that his move from Celtic to Arsenal rather than
Liverpool was a mistake, but in hindsight would also say it might have
been better to stay put with Celtic. ''The problem with that was that,
like Kenny Dalglish and others before me, I was made such a low offer by
Celtic that it was an enticement to leave. So I did.''
Charlie would argue that he had a successful career but he would not
dispute that he should have stayed at the very top much longer than he
did. There were various circumstances which had their effect, not least
the environment at Highbury where Nicholas confesses now he was not
quite the cocky cheeky chappie that people imagined.
''I had been to London only once, as a supporter when Scotland got
beat 5-1, and it was a whole new world to me. I felt I had made the
big-time but at the same time I was lonely, a bit frustrated and found
it hard going. I thought London was about the same size as Glasgow.''
His advice to any aspiring star in a similar situation would be to
make sure that he feels in his own mind that it is right for him. ''You
can make wrong decisions as I am a living witness, and what you need to
do if you get the chance to get something bigger is to take in
everything, the fact that your are moving away, the type of lifestyle
you want to lead.''
He dismissed once and for all that the choice of Arsenal was based on
finance. ''I could have gone to Inter Milan and made more money than
either of the English clubs.''
He admits, too, that he was a bit disappointed at the way he left
Celtic second time round. ''I felt that I was basically frozen out. Last
season I think I started about five games but I was always just filling
a gap. The worst part for me was not being involved when we won the cup,
although I was injured. I was delighted for everybody, but I had never
had that experience before.''
He was left out of Celtic's pre-season tour and felt a bit hurt. ''I
am a very close friend of Tommy Burns and cherish that friendship, but I
must admit I was bit disappointed in the way it was all handled.
''I thought maybe against Liverpool I could have got 10 to 15 minutes
just to say ''goodbye.'' In my last year, I think I realised how much of
a supporter I had become.''
Nicholas is not sure about the future of the game or himself. ''I was
in Manchester covering the Aberdeen-Celtic game for Sky, and I thought
it was tremendous. Yet people around me were saying how poor the
defences were. Then we watched Manchester City and Arsenal, when the
defences were on top, and it was a horrible 1-0 bore. I thought to
myself: ''I'd be much happier watching poor defences every week.
''If we are going to continue with the attacking matches that we saw
at Pittodrie, then I would be optimistic. I believe managers have to
believe in their team and let them go for it.''
Is he tempted to become one of them in due course? Charlie is not
sure. ''I know my style of play has never been known to be a success in
management, but that doesn't bother me. I am sure I would be good at
man-management. The down side is that I don't know if I fancy the
lifestyle.
''Going in at 9am and still being there at 9pm is maybe not the kind
of life I would enjoy. I see Dalglish getting out of it because I think
he wants to able to play the odd game of golf here and there. That's the
quandary for me.''
In the meantime, he expects to get an idea of what he wants to do with
his future while he plays out his career with Clyde. ''Maybe in a
strange little way, this is me contributing back some of what I have got
out of the game. If that is the case I am glad to be doing it.''

CHAMPIONS Warwickshire took a giant stride towards retaining the
Britannic Assurance championship title when they forced Kent to follow
on 229 runs behind on the second day at Canterbury yesterday.
However, their celebrations will be delayed by at least another day as
England pace bowler Angus Fraser kept second-placed Middlesex's hopes
flickering at Somerset.
Kent reached 18 without loss in their second innings by the close
after Warwickshire skipper Dermot Reeve took five for 30 to restrict the
hosts to 239 first time round, which featured a fine 103 from Graham
Cowdrey.
This was in response to Warwickshire's 468 for six declared, as Roger
Twose added to opener Nick Knight's 174 with his side's second century.
Twose, in possibly his last innings for the county before he emigrates
to New Zealand, finished unbeaten on 109 after having started the day on
54.
Middlesex, handicapped by losing the first day's play at Taunton,
reduced Somerset to 306 for eight, with Fraser returning figures of five
for 36. But in order to pip Warwickshire, Middlesex must take a maximum
24 points from this match and hope the leaders fail to polish off Kent.
Lancashire's hopes of lifting themselves to third in the final table
took a pounding at Derby, where England player Dominic Cork completed a
haul of seven for 61 to give him 90 wickets for the season.
The fourth-placed visitors added just 21 to their overnight 134 for
eight, with Derbyshire then responding by reaching 161 for two in their
second innings for a lead of 273.
Kim Barnett was unbeaten on 80 at the close in his last championship
innings as Derbyshire skipper.
Elsewhere, last-wicket pair Andy Pick and Dave Pennett boosted
Nottinghamshire to 159 for nine with an unbeaten stand of 54 against
Durham, who go into today's play with a 265-run lead having achieved
maximum batting points for the first time this season.
Durham, who can climb off the foot of the table above Kent if they win
this game, reached 424 at Chester-le-Street, with opener Wayne Larkins
extending his overnight 113 by eight runs. Alan Walker (four for 29) and
Manoj Prabhakar (three for 38) then tore into the Notts order.
Yorkshire's pace attack bowled their side into a winning position at
Chelmsford against Essex, who were reduced to 62 for five in their
second innings.
A maiden first-class half-century from Richard Kettleborough (55) and
a fine knock of 98 by David Byas had earlier helped Yorkshire to an
all-out total of 309, a deficit of just four runs.
The weather played havoc at other grounds, with four matches badly
affected.
Just 12 deliveries were possible between Sussex and Northamptonshire
at Hove, where the hosts added seven runs without loss to their
overnight 104 for two after the first day had been restricted to
two-and-a-half hours of action.
There was no play at The Oval, where Surrey will resume today on 71
for two, still 114 runs behind Hampshire's first innings 185 all out.
It was a similar story at Grace Road, where the second day's wash-out
left Leicestershire on 57 for one, 139 runs adrift of Gloucestershire's
196.
Worcestershire and Glamorgan have yet to make a start at all after two
days of rain at Worcester.
Derbyshire 267 (P DeFreitas 94 no) and 161-2 (K Barnett 80 no);
Lancashire 155 (I Austin 80 no, D Cork 7-61).
Durham 424 (W Larkins 121, J Morris 109, M Roseberry 53, J Daley 50, R
Bates 5-88); Nottinghamshire 159-9 (A Walker 4-29).
Essex 313 (R Rollins 63, N Hussain 58, P Prichard 54) and 62-5;
Yorkshire 309 (D Byas 98, R Kettleborough 55, M Ilott 4-97).
Warwickshire 468-6 dec (N Knight 174, R Twose 109 no, N Smith 54,
Wasim Khan 51); Kent 239 (G Cowdrey 103, D Reeve 5-30) and 18-0.
Gloucestershire 196; Leicestershire 57-1.
Somerset 306-8 (A Hayhurst 71, R Harden 63, K Parsons 62, A Fraser
5-36) v Middlesex.
Hampshire 185 (M Bicknell 4-65); Surrey 71-2.
Sussex 111-2 v Northamptonshire.

THE Perth-based auction firm United Auctions found itself on the
receiving end of a #2m tender offer from investment holding company
Guinness Peat yesterday -- only hours after its shares became available
for trading on the London Stock Exchange through the Alternative
Investment Market.
Earlier in the day chief executive Alan McGregor was posing for the
cameras as a City gent in a bowler hat with a Highland cow at Perth
Agricultural Centre to mark the flotation. Within hours, however,
Glasgow-based stockbrokers Stirling Hendry &amp; Company said they were
seeking to acquire up to 532,000 Ordinary shares at 275p per share on
behalf of Guinness Peat (Scotland) -- a premium of 21% on the latest
trade price of 210p for United Auctions' shares.
The offer came as a surprise to United directors but they were
unwilling to make any comment.
If the Guinness Peat tender offer is accepted in full they will hold
29.9% of United Auctions -- just below the level at which they would
have to launch a full bid.
United Auctions' main centres are at Perth and Stirling. In addition
to livestock sales their activities include farm and land estate agency,
forestry advisory and management services, insurance broking and meat
wholesaling.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Milk tops up seasonality payments</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Milk, the successor to the old Scottish Milk Marketing Board,
has confirmed that a new scale of seasonality payments is to be
introduced from next April.
The purpose is to encourage a more level pattern of production to
better match the needs of customers and consumers. This should in the
longer term lead to higher returns for the farmer.
The SMMB did operate such a scheme but Scottish Milk, in its first
year, opted instead for a relatively free market trading situation. Some
producers claimed that led to Scotland's dairy farmers receiving some of
the lowest prices for milk in the UK.
The new scale will see a premium of 2p per litre paid in the months of
July, August, September and October with 1.5p paid in November. The
penalties are in turn concentrated in the early months of the year
rising to 4p per litre in June.
More good news from Scottish Milk concerned the August pricing, which
on a provisional basis has been fixed at 22.6p per litre -- 0.2p better
than forecast.
However, the protein level of milk collected in recent weeks has shown
a significant drop, probably because of the hot weather. A newsletter to
producers comments: ''We therefore do not anticipate that the historic
annual average for protein will be sustained in the current period. The
directors have therefore decided to amend the protein standard downwards
to 3.25%.''
That means that there will be no penalty for producers who fail to
match the previous higher level.
This decision is causing some quiet smiles on the part of perhaps as
many as 200 members of Scottish Milk who have indicated a desire to sell
their milk elsewhere. The rules of the new body require the directors to
give 90 days' notice of any change unless they believe that the
circumstances warrant shorter notice. The directors are now saying: ''We
believe that a shorter period of notice is warranted and the new lower
standard will come into effect from October 1, 1995.''
Some weeks ago Henry Griffiths, a Lanarkshire dairy farmer, said that
Scottish Milk had breached the terms of his contract and that he planned
to sell his milk to another buyer and be better off by around #10,000
per year. Subsequently the company was granted an interdict against Mr
Griffiths stating that he had to observe the statutory 90 days' period
of notice.
Mr Griffiths decided not to enter a costly court action but earlier
this week, commenting on the change in protein standards, said: ''The
board seems to make up the rules as they go along to suit themselves.''

THIS month marks the first anniversary of the creation a trailblazing
organisation at the University of Abertay in Dundee, one of only a few
of its kind in Scotland -- Product Development Tayside.
Its launch last September was the culmination of efforts, initiated by
Tayside Region Industrial Office, in partnership with Tayside Community
Business and the University of Abertay, to set up an organisation which
would encourage the development, manufacture and marketing of innovative
new products.
Building on the strengths and using the facilities of the university's
engineering department, its aim is to give professional support to
individuals and small companies who might have genuinely new product
ideas, but lack some of the skills necessary to exploit them
commercially.
By the end of the first year, Helen Mill, manager of Product
Development Tayside, can boast some measure of success. One of the first
products to which PDT has lent practical support is a cot alarm invented
by a 19-year-old client. He reached the UK final of Young Electronic
Designer of the Year and won an innovation award for his invention -- an
ingenious device designed to prevent the abduction of babies from
maternity wards.
Another client was helped to develop a mitre bevel -- a versatile
joinery tool for which an international patent application has been
made. A third has developed a rucksack tent -- a conventional rucksack
with integral one-person tent to provide emergency shelter.
These three projects are all now at the stage where further finance is
required to launch them into the marketplace. Product Development
Tayside is helping them to look for partners and backers who want
investment opportunities.
This bringing together of the inventor and his or her prototype with
fund providers or licensees is the final step in what Mill expects to
be, on average, a year-long co-operative exercise.
There is a strict screening process to decide which product ideas are
accepted. Of last year's 120 enquiries, only around 10 have gone forward
as potentially viable commercial projects. At the beginning, a number of
individuals' ideas are rejected simply because they are not new, and a
lot of others are re-directed to more appropriate agencies. Others still
do not require the specific engineering design assistance Abertay is
able to give.
Clients pay a registration fee, and Mill puts their proposals and
products to an independent review panel of technical and business
experts. They assesses the product's technical and market potential. If
it is accepted, the client and PDT work together to analyse customer
needs, develop the product in the light of these, make prototypes and
test them. At the same time PDT, where necessary, gives assistance in
business planning, marketing and after-sales servicing.
PDT has only three staff -- Mill, who has a degree in production
engineering and a qualification in materials and mechanics, a technical
assistant who is a mechanical and electronic toolmaker, and an
administrative assistant. Where it is unable to provide the specific
expertise required, it finds and co-ordinates skills from other
disciplines and consultancies.
It is not until products are on sale that the clients begin to repay
PDT's costs. Thorough screening is, therefore, essential to ensure its
funds are not depleted by failures. Conversely, support for successful
products ensures PDT, which is a non-profit making organisation, will be
able to continue its service for many years to come.

THINGS are happening again on Glasgow's Broomielaw, where the gleaming
stone and metal of the elegant 280,000 sq ft Atlantic Quay office
development has sat, for some years, amid the crumbling legacy of an
earlier era in the city's commercial history.
The buildings, which now house the corporate HQs of ScottishPower,
Stakis and other blue-chip tenants such as TSB and BAe Sema, were meant
to be the first phase of a much bigger redevelopment of the area. The
deep recession in the UK property market put paid to that.
But now, with a new player on the scene, further phases are promised.
Site clearance has already taken place. Temporary landscaping is
imminent. Detailed planning permission is already in place for the first
130,000 sq ft building. There have even been preliminary discussions
with potential tenants.
Two of the people involved in these further phases of Atlantic Quay
have had an interest in the project from the start. But, within its
eventful lifespan, their own corporate identity has passed through a
significant evolutionary process.
The original Atlatic Quay development was launched by Glasgow &amp;
Oriental, a 50:50 joint venture between the Japanese construction and
property group Kumagai Gumi and the UK developer partnership Bellhouse &amp;
Joseph.
Ed Bellhouse and Jonathan Joseph are still deeply involved, although
today they participate as the soon-to-be-renamed Dares Estates, a small
quoted property company in which Kwik-Fit's Tom Farmer is the biggest
shareholder and a non-executive director.
Now that we are promised further action on the waterfront, it is worth
exploring that evolution. Atlantic Quay was not just hit by the UK
property recession. It was affected, indirectly, by the bursting of the
bubble economy in Japan.
Kumagai Gumi went through a massive strategic reassessment,
withdrawing from much of its overseas development activity. That left
Bellhouse &amp; Joseph frustrated and unable to make progress on the Glasgow
development beyond phase one.
''To break the impasse,'' says Ed Bellhouse, ''we eventually said
look, most of our work as developers on phase one is complete. Why don't
we trade our share of that for the undeveloped part of the site and then
find a new development partner to take that forward?''
So, today, Kumagai retains the entire interest in phase one and
Bellhouse and his partner have forged a new link to develop the
five-and-a-half acres which will eventually house phases two and three.
That link is with Pillar Property Investments, formed in 1991 and run by
Raymond Mould and Patrick Vaughan, the pair who sold Arlington
Securities to British Aerospace.
Pillar was originally conceived as a vulture fund, buying up
undervalued property assets during the recession. It was floated last
year. Bellhouse &amp; Joseph had worked with the principals in Pillar in the
redevelopment of a department store on London's Queensway in the
eighties, the biggest inner city development of its kind at the time.
''It suited them to be involved in a development opportunity at that
stage of their development,'' says Bellhouse of the new joint venture
which, over the next six to eight years, hopes to complete Atlantic
Quay.
Since the relaunch of the development, Bellhouse &amp; Joseph has gone
through its own transformation into a listed and more broadly balanced
property company. ''We've been developers and managers of developments
for the past 15 years,'' explains Bellhouse. ''We entered the recession
owning development assets and we've come out the other end still owning
some. We felt a need to balance that with an investment portfolio.''
His logic is not just that a broader base will help the pair ride out
future market cycles more effectively. Bellhouse firmly believes that,
with the institutions still in retreat from direct involvement in
property, there will be a growing need for quoted property investment
vehicles in which they can invest instead.
Six months back, the chance arose to effectively back Bellhouse &amp;
Joseph into a quoted vehicle, Dares Estates. Dares had been through a
debt for equity swap with its banks in 1993 and a small rights issue in
1994 which had brought in a portfolio of properties, mainly in
South-east England, with a rental stream of around #3m a year.
That latter deal brought in Kwik-Fit's Tom Farmer, currently the
biggest single shareholder in Dares. The company is chaired by Ervin
Landau of Halliwell Landau, the Manchester firm of solicitors which acts
for Kwik-Fit. Landau has been a non-executive director of Kwik-Fit for
24 years.
The management of Dares, which will be renamed in due course, is now
in the hands of Ed Bellhouse and Jonathan Joseph. They plan to expand
its established property interests and are looking at a number of
portfolios at the moment. ''We're looking to add up to #20m worth over
the next six months,'' says Bellhouse.

Changing value
for money
A RECENT funeral party in the Tinto Firs Hotel in Glasgow offered
almost #600 in old banknotes to settle their bill, and had the money
refused. The money was part of the savings of the lady who died. She had
always refused to open a bank account although her family had persuaded
her to at least put the money into a safety deposit box at the bank.
However, the hotel could have taken the banknotes if they were
Scottish as Scottish banks do not withdraw notes, unlike the Bank of
England which occasionally does. Even then, the Bank of England would
normally redeem such notes if they were sent to Threadneedle Street.
Incidents like this are not unusual as many elderly people still do
not trust banks and continue to keep their savings in hard cash. You may
think that as well as the obvious danger from house break-ins, such
savings would be eroded by inflation.
But this is not true in all cases. Alwyn James of the Royal Bank of
Scotland told me of a recent case when a car dealer in the North-east of
Scotland sold a second-hand car for #1400 to a young man who paid cash.
The money had come from the estate of the man's father who had kept his
savings in a pillow case.
Having completed the sale, the dealer panicked when he saw that the
notes were 60-years old, and he phoned the Royal's head office in
Edinburgh to check it would accept them.
James assured the dealer that it would, but informed him that he would
be foolish to put the money into the bank as the thirties notes were
collectors' items and could fetch five times their face value.
All set to make
an impact
TONY Pender, former chief executive of English Estates, has teamed up
with Jim Fiddes and his colleagues at Ryden to head up Ryden's Glasgow
operation, and also to oversee its new North of England office in Leeds.
Their paths last crossed in the truest of senses on the rugby pitches
of Cambridge some 30 years ago, when Pender really made his mark on
Fiddes, Ryden's senior partner.
The two young estate management students lined up on different sides
in an inter-college game, Pender for Queens College and Fiddes for
Caius.
During the game Fiddes who was, if you can imagine it, a dashing young
scrum half, was making a daring thrust towards the line when he ran into
the implacable Pender. ''I don't really remember much of what happened
next,'' he recalls, ''except that I think I ended up nearer the halfway
line than the try line.''
Pender, who later became a Cambridge blue, modestly describes that
tackle as ''a pretty good thump''. Fiddes is hoping that he makes as big
an impact on the Scottish property scene.
Fertile source
of amusement
THOSE opening the mail in the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce post room
must have though the postie had got his letters mixed up when they
opened one piece of correspondence which proclaimed the wonderful feats
of SUPER-DUG! There were headlines such as ''Your Super-dug is truly
amazing!'' and ''Thanks to Super-Dug. . .''
There was even a photograph of a dog sitting quietly in a garden
which, at first glance, staff thought was Super-Dug, but on closer
reading it turned out that Super-Dug was organic manure supplied by
Pelco Fertilizers, ''purveyors of fine manures to the Gentry since
1959''.
Perhaps first impressions were not all that far astray. I've certainly
got a dog which could claim to be in the super class when it comes to
fertilising the garden.
Hastings takes
legal advice
FORMER Scottish rugby captain Gavin Hastings has had a long
association with solicitor's firm Henderson Boyd Jackson, as it has
sponsored his club, Watsonians, for whose commercial activities he is
responsible.
It was only natural then that when Henderson Boyd Jackson was planning
to open a Falkirk office it should ask him to go along and ''kick off''
the proceedings.
The firm's ever active PR, Cathy Cullis, arrived with the usual props,
excuse the pun, for a photo session including, as ever, an oval ball.
But Ross Blyth, the corporate partner in charge of the new office, had
other ideas. He produced a wig, normally worn by solicitors when
appearing in court, and a law tome. However, Hastings, who never shirked
a tackle when playing for Scotland, told Blyth: ''You will never get me
in that outfit.''
But, as any good lawyer would, he immediately saw this as a challenge
and, appealing to the player's good business sense, suggested that,
perhaps, just perhaps, Henderson Boyd Jackson might consider taking a
couple of advertising hoardings at future Watsonian games if the wig was
donned.
That was as good as scoring a try for Hastings. He could not resist
the temptation, and on it went!

* I have a holding of shares in Barclays Bank. In its half-yearly
report I read that it had purchased a million or so of its own shares on
the open market. I have now received a form of election whereby I can
take shares, instead of a cash dividend. I find this mystifying, buying
back shares just to reissue them. Can you enlighten me as to the logic
of the manoeuvre?
* An increasing number of companies offer their shareholders the form
of election you describe. It allows them to reinvest their dividends and
thereby increase their share holdings. There is nothing sinister about
such offers, which widen the choice open to shareholders. But if you
want to receive your dividend cheque you need take no action.
Before deciding to reinvest dividends in a company's shares there are
a couple of points which should be borne in mind. If on the eventual
sale of the enlarged shareholding there was a liability to capital gains
tax, the calculations would be a nightmare for all but the best
organised.
Second, the reinvestment of dividends is a form of investment by
stealth. No conscious decision would be taken to increase a
shareholding. A shareholder not requiring his dividend income could
instead choose to save up all his dividends until he had a sufficient
sum to reinvest the proceeds. He could then choose between enlarging one
of his holdings or making a fresh investment.
Nevertheless, many shareholders find dividend reinvestment a
convenient way of building up capital. It is particularly popular with
investment trusts and personal equity plans. One suspects, therefore,
that any company withdrawing its dividend reinvestment facility just
because it was having to buy back its own shares on the market would run
into opposition from the shareholders who make use of it.

* On retiring I have recently taken out a private pension from
self-employed contributions but have opted to take a quarter of the sum
(#5000) in cash with a view to investing it to earn income by way of a
PEP.
An obvious solution would be a corporate bond PEP. However, it would
appear that while yielding a good income there is little possibility of
growth. This could be overcome if there were a significant proportion of
convertibles and I would welcome your advice on this. Alternatively, I
have been looking at Dartmoor Investment Trust, which seems to have some
growth record while yielding 12%. With such a yield is this a sound
investment for a PEP?
* It is a rule of thumb that the higher the yield the lower the
prospect for capital growth and often the higher the risk. The best you
will be able to hope for with most corporate bond PEPs, all of which
incidentally have a high proportion of convertible stocks in their
portfolio, is the maintenance of the value of the capital.
These PEPs are being sold as income providers and so the emphasis is
on high yield. But the fund's portfolio can be structured to produce a
lower yield but with better prospects for capital growth. One such fund
is Baillie Gifford's Convertible and General Unit Trust which yields
5.3%.
Dartmoor Investment Trust must come into the speculative category as
it invests in split capital investment trusts whose performance can be
highly volatile. This has been reflected in Dartmoor's performance.
Since their launch in 1990 at 100p, the shares have been up to nearly
150p and down to 70p. They are currently 134p. If you are prepared for a
bumpy ride then you could put a portion of your funds into the trust.
* I have recently applied to my local authority landlord to buy my
council house. I anticipate the purchase price to be around #18,000
which I would like to mortgage over a fairly short period, say five
years.
I am employed as a school teacher earning #20,000 per annum. I am
married and living with my husband and two children but I would like to
proceed in my own name as my husband is self-employed. Could you please
give me some advice on the best mortgage lender to approach and type of
mortgage?
* You will have to use a repayment mortgage for such a short period
but you should not have any problem finding a lender prepared to fund a
mortgage over five years, though he will want to know if it would leave
you with enough money to meet other essential outgoings.
As for which mortgage lender, offers come and go rapidly but at the
time of writing Northern Rock and Halifax have good offers for
first-time buyers and the Woolwich and Abbey National are also worth
approaching, though they will usually lend up to only 95% of valuation.
* I would be grateful if you would repeat the advice, which I believe
you gave to a previous correspondent, about the wisdom of leaving title
deeds in the hands of a building society.
When I asked my building society about the procedure for paying off a
mortgage I was advised to leave #1 unpaid so that it would retain the
deeds for safe-keeping. Could you please repeat the pros and cons of
this arrangement? Incidentally, how big a disaster would it be if these
deeds were ''lost''.
* Leaving #1 in the mortgage account will not necessarily mean you
won't have to pay a fee for the society to retain the title deeds for
safe-keeping. Typically, societies demand a #25 or #50 one-off fee for
this, though practice does vary.
The #1 will mean you stay on the society's books which could be useful
should you ever want to borrow money again. Leaving the deeds with it
saves time and bother and they will be more secure than if they were
kept under the mattress at home, but the society may not accept
liability for their loss. You will have to check its position on this.
It is certainly no disaster if they do go up in smoke. All you have to
do is apply to the Keeper of the Registers in Edinburgh to ask for a
certified copy which is as valid as the original. There will be a charge
for this, its size depending on the complexity of the deeds.
* I have a pension plan for the self-employed with Sun Alliance. The
policy was taken out in 1976/77 and premiums of #750 were paid annually.
They were increased last year to #1000 and to #1500 this year.
I made inquiries from the company recently about what pension I might
expect on the maturity date which is 1998 and was given the following
information. Assuming a growth rate of 6% there would be a cash sum of
#7000 plus a pension of #2230 per annum; with growth of 12% the figures
would be #11,500 and #3590 respectively.
It also gave estimated funds transferable to another insurer of
#38,400 at 6% growth and #45,100 at 12%. I would be grateful to know how
you think the pension plan has performed and for any advice you may have
about transferring to another fund in three years time.
* The Sun Alliance managed fund has had a respectable track record in
recent years and it would not make sense to switch your investment to
another fund, particularly so late in the policy's life. On maturity you
have the right to transfer the accumulated value of your policy to
another company in order to buy an annuity. As to whether it would be
better to do this or take the terms offered by Sun Alliance, this
depends on the annuity rates available at the time. You will have to
investigate these then.
* I will be retiring early next year and will at that time be moving
house to be nearer my family. I own my own home on which there is now no
mortgage, and in view of present market conditions I have been
considering buying the new one now rather than waiting until next year.
I will, of course, require the house here until I retire and then it
will be sold.
Can you say if the loan to purchase the new one will attract tax
relief and will there be any question of capital gains tax as there will
be a period when I own two homes?
* Tax relief will be available on the interest payments on a loan of
up to #30,000 under the rules applying to bridging loans. Tax relief is
normally only given where the property is used as the main residence at
the time the interest is paid. However, where a loan is taken out for
the purchase of another property which is to be used as the main
residence, interest payments qualify for relief for a prescribed period.
The period for which tax relief is given is restricted to 12 months, but
the Revenue has the power to extend this if it considers it reasonable
to do so.
There is no question of a charge to capital gains tax on the sale of
your present house as it is used as your main residence and the absence
from your new home will be ignored for this purpose.
* If it is specified in a will that a beneficiary is to receive a sum
free of tax can there then be a subsequent demand on the recipient for
tax? If inheritance tax is paid before the estate is finalised, is the
beneficiary then liable to capital gains tax on the amount received? If
so, how much of the legacy would go to tax?
* If you make a legacy in your will and stipulate that the beneficiary
is to receive it free of inheritance tax, then he or she will receive it
without any tax deduction. What happens in these circumstances is that
any tax which would have been due on the legacy is met out of the
residue of your estate.
If, for example, you leave an estate of #200,000 with a #25,000
free-of-tax legacy to your sister and the balance of the estate to your
son, then the tax liability on the whole #200,000 would have to be met
out of the #175,000 residue. At current rates the tax due would be
#18,400, leaving #156,600 to your son.
There is no capital gains tax on death. If your estate includes assets
liable to capital gains tax, these transfer to the beneficiaries at
their value at your date of death.

THE banks and building societies have protested loudly about the
Government's plan to cut back the state help available to home owners
when they get into difficulties paying their mortgages.
However, it seems the public is hardly aware of the changes even
though they are likely to increase the risk of repossession. Research by
Barclays Bank reveals that less than a third of buyers have any idea
that such major changes to income support are imminent.
The changes mean that from the beginning of next month, new mortgage
holders -- and that includes anyone who remortgages with a different
lender -- will get no help with their mortgage payments during the first
nine months of any period of unemployment or sickness.
Repossessions have been falling since 1991 when they reached a peak of
75,540, but even the threat of another upturn in the number of people
losing their homes has failed to budge the Government on the issue. In
fact, in spite of all the noise emanating from the mortgage lenders, it
seems to have successfully thrown the ball back into their court because
they are beginning to come up with some innovative ways of tackling the
problem.
Most lenders are thinking in terms of insurance. Mortgage protection
insurance has been available for a number of years. It usually covers
payments for up to a year if you are out of work or fall ill. The
difficulty is that it is expensive -- it adds around 5% to the cost of a
mortgage -- and it may not cover you if you are self-employed or work on
contract, which is becoming increasingly common.
But there are signs some lenders are thinking about adapting the age
old traditions of mortgage lending to meet the challenges of an
increasingly insecure workforce who can expect to experience periods of
relative affluence, interspersed with spells of unemployment or
part-time work.
The Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, is expected to unveil
a new flexible plan within the next couple of weeks. There is nothing
new about these. Those in the know can do it for themselves with the
agreement of their lender. For example, there is nothing to stop couples
with two incomes accelerating their repayments while they can afford to
do so and slowing them down again if one income is sacrificed when they
start a family.
Some lenders, notably the Bank of Ireland, Bradford &amp; Bingley and
National &amp; Provincial, have even launched baby-break mortgages
specifically to allow repayment holidays following the birth of a child.
And the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks have pioneered flexible mortgages
which allow borrowers to alter the level of repayments as their
circumstances change.
However, none of these schemes allow for repayment holidays during
periods of sickness or unemployment. And if any of them are to work
massive investment in staff training will be needed to explain how the
way you repay your mortgage can be adjusted to meet your needs.
Whatever Government is in power, the shrinking social security budget
means we can no longer take it for granted that every benefit will
continue in perpetuity. The message is clear: those who can afford it
must take better financial care of themselves.
These latest social security cutbacks are likely to have far reaching
effects. Falling house prices and negative equity have caused the number
of first-time buyers to dry up to a trickle. It seems an increasing
number of people are prepared to rent or delay the decision to buy.
New home owners who want to minimise the risk of repossession must now
look to themselves, but they should realise that insurance may not be
the answer, even where it is offered free by lenders such as the
Skipton, the Britannia, the Market Harborough and the Hinckley &amp; Rugby.
Those in high-risk occupations, the self-employed or contract workers
will be much better off exploring more flexible ways of repaying their
mortgage or simply increasing their level of savings so they have a
large enough cushion to carry them through the hard times.
The changes
* After October 1 anyone with an existing mortgage who falls on hard
times will get half of the repayments covered by the DSS after two
months of unemployment and the full amount after a further four months.
* Anyone who takes out a mortgage after October 1 must be unemployed
for nine months before the DSS will cover their repayments.
* There is no state help with mortgages for those with more than #8000
of savings and it is reduced for those with over #3000 worth.

NEWS that the Government is considering relaxing rules on pensions to
allow some of the money to be used to finance long-term nursing care is
welcome, but it won't solve the problems now facing thousands of elderly
people.
Estimates suggest that one in six pensioners could need residential
care for an average of up to three years. But, under current rules, many
of them have to sell their homes to pay for this, leaving little or
nothing to pass on to their heirs.
Personal and company schemes are bound by a host of Inland Revenue
rules which prevent the money built up being to used to finance anything
other than an income in retirement.
But it has been suggested that a relaxation of the rules might be
announced in the November Budget, allowing part of your pension income
to go towards paying for long-term care in the years to come.
One idea might be to defer some pension when you first retire in
exchange for a higher income in the future to fund the huge costs of
residential or nursing care.
This might help those in receipt of good private pensions to plan for
their twilight years. It won't do anything, however, to help the less
fortunate who have only state pensions and benefits, but who own their
home. They may still be forced to sell up to pay their care bills.
Also, tinkering with the rules won't do anything to boost the amount
people put into pensions during their working lives. That's becoming
more important as state pensions are cut back, especially if the funds
built up are expected to meet the costs of expensive nursing care as
well as a comfortable income when you retire.
It has been estimated that only one out of every 100 employees retires
from a company pension scheme with the maximum benefits it can provide.
Employees in company schemes cannot top up their benefits through
personal plans, but they can make additional voluntary contributions
(AVCs).
The trouble is that very few do. Figures suggest that out of some 11
million company scheme members only one million pay AVCs. But numbers
could expand dramatically if the Government agrees to a change in the
contribution limits.
AVCs offer the same tax benefits as personal pensions -- employees
qualify for full tax relief on the money they put in and their savings
accumulate within a tax-free fund. But contributions to an AVC scheme
cannot be as flexible as those put into a personal pension plan.
If you pay less into the latter than the maximum allowed by the Inland
Revenue each year, you have the chance to mop what you've missed, paying
in for up to six years years in one go if you choose.
This gives those with personal pensions, whether they're employees or
self-employed, the chance to make contributions when they can best
afford them -- complete with up to 40% tax relief. Many use an
inheritance or the proceeds of a life policy to maximise their
contributions in later life.
Such flexibility is not available to AVC payers. Instead, each year
company scheme members have to make a one-off choice about paying AVCs
and benefitting from the tax relief available. If the allowance is not
used up that year it is lost for ever.
Now the Government is being urged to change the rules so people
contributing to AVCs can make up for lost time by putting in substantial
AVC payments when they can afford them.
The Association of Consulting Actuaries (ACA) is urging the Chancellor
to use the platform of this year's Budget to announce the change. ''A
lot of people leave it very late to think about their pensions and then
realise they should have started doing something five years earlier,''
says Lynne Davis at the ACA.
''We think it would be only logical for employees in company schemes
to have the same opportunity to backtrack as those with personal
pensions.''
So does Brian McKenna at Glasgow financial adviser MGW. ''It would be
a tremendous boost to AVCs. With an upper limit of 15% of salary each
year on combined contributions to the main company scheme and AVCs it
can be tricky for employees to get a really meaningful amount into their
pensions.
''But with the ability to go back six years, AVCs would be set for a
major expansion. It doesn't seem fair that although employees with
personal pensions are allowed to carry back contributions, those in
company schemes are not.''
Noel Valerio at Money Managers says: ''Allowing more flexibility for
AVCs would be particularly useful for female employees who have taken
time out from their careers to bring up a family and want to give their
pensions a boost once they're back in work.''
It is easy for employees to join in-house AVC plans run in conjunction
with their main scheme, but that may not always be the wisest course of
action. You will be limited in your choice of investment managers and
must take benefits from the AVC scheme at the same time as the main
scheme.
Instead or as well as the in-house scheme employees can also opt for
free-standing AVCs from a variety of insurance companies and investment
managers. Administrative charges may be higher, but there is potentially
a better chance of active investment management and greater growth.
There is also the opportunity to take a pension from your
free-standing AVCs from age 50, deferring your main scheme benefits
until, say, 60 or 65 when they would be worth substantially more.

DESPITE the huge success of shares since the big investing
institutions caught on to the idea that they were a good defence against
inflation, there remains a large body of cautious people who prefer a
fixed-interest return. They like to know just what their income will be
this year, next year, and so on. A lot of them also like to know exactly
how much they are worth, checking the figure in building society books
or the equivalent.
They are now in the sights of the marketing experts of the firms of
fund managers who predict a big inflow of funds for the new corporate
bond personal equity plans (PEPs).
There is, however, always something to argue about when you come to
think about how to invest money. The arrival of corporate bond PEPs
prompted cautionary advice that investors should consider carefully how
suitable these products were to their needs. Younger investors with no
immediate requirement for income might be better off buying a PEP based
on shares, for instance. Shares are more risky than fixed-interest
investments but over the long inflationary years they have proved a
better protection for capital.
On the face of it, fixed-interest bond PEPs sound pretty attractive to
the investor who wants to improve income without putting capital at
risk. After all, bonds, even convertible ones and Preference shares,
where the investor has the option of converting into shares at fixed
prices some time in the future, have a stated rate of interest which the
company has undertaken to pay. And they often have a date on which the
capital is due to be repaid.
Investors have to remember, however, that the promises come from the
company and not from heaven or the Government, and even apparently sound
companies can hit trouble. So both the income and the capital will bear
some measure of risk. And as these are quoted investments their value
will fluctuate as the general level of interest rates rises and falls.
Peter Hargreaves of independent adviser Hargreaves Lansdown points
out: ''They are subject to normal market forces and do not provide a
guarantee of income or the guarantee of capital which is afforded under
a deposit with a bank or building society.''
Ideally, you buy fixed-interest investments when rates are high and
likely to fall. The problem is that even now when rates are pretty low
compared with what they have been, there is still room to argue whether
they will go up or down.
If inflation stays low, which is a fairly popular prediction nowadays,
a lot of fixed-interest investments may turn out to be at bargain levels
even though they are not necessarily cheap by historical standards.
There is something of a price war going on among the fund management
groups with offers of low or nil initial charges but perhaps with an
exit charge if you cash in within five years. But possibly the most
important charge for a long-term investor to consider is the annual one
for management.
Legal &amp; General, the insurance company, produced a novel guaranteed
corporate bond PEP offering investors prepared to lock their money up
for five-and-a-half years fixed interest of 7% with no charges at all.
It was able to forego charges because it was itself issuing the bond
which went into the PEP, raising capital at 7% interest at a time when
it would probably have had to pay 8.25% if it had simply put the bond on
the market in the normal way.
The company hopes to start a new segment of business arranging similar
no-charge guaranteed bond PEPs for other major companies wanting to
raise capital on ''cheap'' terms. If the idea catches on it will start
with very large and solid companies and hopefully trickle down to others
later.
Guinness Flight tackles the problem of wooing the cautious investor
who normally keeps cash in a bank or building society by producing a
bond PEP with an AA credit rating. It says this will have 75% or more of
its investments in corporate bonds with AA or better credit ratings.
While the market value of this sort of high rated bond will fluctuate
with the general level of interest rates, the prices should not stray
too far from equivalent Government securities.
The number of corporate bond PEPs is still increasing. Most are of the
managed variety, where the investor relies on the skills of the fund
manager to produce the income and safeguard the capital as far as
possible. As with all investments the caution has to be that the higher
the yield, the higher the risk which is implied -- for bonds as well as
for shares. You can get a bit of both worlds if you go for a PEP which
buys convertible securities.
As well as the managed PEPs you can select your own investments,
although your PEP still has to be in the hands of an authorised manager
so the Inland Revenue can make sure you keep within the limit of one
#6000 PEP a year.
A lot of stockbrokers and some independent advisers will handle this
for you. Hargreaves Lansdown, for instance, offers clients a choice of
Hanson, Royal Insurance, Glaxo or British Gas bonds to put in a low-cost
self-select PEP.
Government securities -- gilts -- are not permitted investments for
bond PEPs but they are free of capital gains tax up to #200,000 nominal
value. Next year we will see a market developing in ''stripped gilts''
where one buyer can take just the income and another only the capital
value to redemption date.
Eventually, that will be a multi-million pound market, but we don't
yet know how the Government plans to tax the strips.

<HEADLINE>Regulator bows to MMC on on Hydro</HEADLINE>

PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild has accepted in full the recommendations
of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for more lenient price controls
on Scottish Hydro-Electric than those he originally proposed.
''I have concluded that the commission's recommendations form an
appropriate basis for revised price controls for Hydro-Electric,'' the
director general of the office of electricity regulation (Offer) said.
The Perth-based power company, which challenged Professor
Littlechild's original proposals for a new price control regime last
year, welcomed the announcement.
But Hydro-Electric said it would only make a detailed statement after
seeing the regulator's fresh proposals when they are published next
week.
The issue was referred to the MMC in November after Hydro-Electric
protested that Offer's original proposals would not allow it to make
enough money from distribution to renew its network of ageing power
lines in the Highlands and Islands.
The MMC, which published its findings in June, broadly agreed with
Hydro-Electric's arguments.
It said the company should continue to subsidise the high cost of
distributing power to remote rural communities by up to #40m per year
with windfall profits from its generation of cheap hydro electricity.
It also said Hydro-Electric should only have to cut the price of
electricity delivered to domestic consumers by 8.5% in real terms over
the next four years -- less than the 10% originally proposed by Prof
Littlechild.
The MMC increased the amount that Hydro-Electric should spend on
renewing power lines by #22m to #247m.
And it said the yardstick used by Hydro-Electric and ScottishPower to
determine tariffs for domestic consumers should be calculated in a more
generous manner.
But the MMC tightened the reins on Hydro-Electric by ordering the
company to cut its operating costs by 2% a year in real terms over the
next four years. Prof Littlechild had only sought a 1% annual cut.
The industry regulator said the MMC report on Hydro-Electric did not
warrant any modification to price controls on Glasgow-based
ScottishPower, which supplies electricity to south and central Scotland.
Hydro-Electric shares fell 1p to 368p.

TRADE Secretary Ian Lang has so far nodded through the now effectively
consummated takeover of South Western Electricity by a US utility for
#1000m -- Hanson's agreed #1500m offer for Eastern and ScottishPower's
#1000m hostile takeover attack on Manweb.
Waiting in the wings is the hostile #1600m bid for Norweb from fellow
Mancunian North West Water, which is likely to have a rougher regulatory
ride, with the industry regulators for both water and electricity
arguing that it is beyond their legal powers to intervene and so, by
inference, that there should be a reference to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
But now, with the disclosure that PowerGen -- the smaller of the two
English generating companies -- is in talks with Midlands Electricity
about a possible #1900m merger, the pressure for an MMC reference will
reach a crescendo. Particular attention will be paid to the impact of
any PowerGen takeover on consumers, whose long term interests have been
totally ignored to date.
In most bid situations, if the purchaser does not like the new face,
he can go next door. But here there is an effective monopoly, while
further down the track there must be concern over the financial
strengths and long term commitments of the bidder -- particularly if it
is of overseas orgin -- who may want to pass the parcel.
It is expected that PowerGen could offer around 975p, which resulted
in Midlands shares jumping 45p to 937p.
Now that it is open season for bidders, the name of the game is to
find the next target, with London Electricity allegedly in the sights of
at least one German operator. That could concentrate minds more in
Westminster than any other utility takeover.
Needless to say, the chances of success of a British company being
allowed to acquire a similar operation in Germany would seem somewhat
remote.
Manweb's chief executive John Roberts gave the game away yesterday
when he said the business is now being run for cash. That is a cry of
desperation from a company which has stretched itself on a financial
rack and mortgaged its future through its proposal to distribute such
largesse to shareholders in its attempts to remain independent.
Cost cutting will be the order of the day, which leaves little in
reserve against the rainy days that will undoubtedly come to a company
which, even by the year 2000, does not really expect gearing to drop
below 130% -- it is just 28% at present. Such cutting to the bone bodes
ill for capital expenditure or the ability to introduce new technology
on any substantial scale in the future.
Ironically with five bids now taking place, including PowerGen, one
argument for privatisation is disappearing with the concentration of
power in fewer hands.
But a great deal of the blame does attach itself to industry regulator
Professor Stephen Littlechild, who has been bamboozled time and time
again by the Recs. He has also appeared to be unable to move away from a
legalistic approach with strict interpretation of the issues, so has
proved to be easy meat for the more inventive finance directors. If he
had the ability to see through them, then the vast sums now available to
buy out shareholders would have remained with customers.
It is time Ian Lang stirred -- who knows, there could even be a
political benefit.

THE City gave the thumbs-down to the eagerly anticipated Manweb
defence against the #1000m hostile offer from ScottishPower.
That was despite the Chester based regional electricity company
revealing a bigger than expected package of benefits amounting to 550p
per share to most shareholders or about 100p above most expectations.
And Manweb is making the first-ever profits forecast covering two years
in a defence bid ''that is unprecedented and that is its potency, ''
claimed Schroders advisor John Reynolds.
Petrol was thrown on the fire of controversy over electricity industry
takeovers when PowerGen said that it is in talks which could lead to the
acquisition of Midlands Electricity.
Mawnweb shares eased 6p to 1010p while ScottishPower were 5p off at
371p indicating that the matter was probably now decided, particularly
as the Glasgow based company now has 20.8% of the equity. That was
underlined with the offer now having been extended until October 6 with
City hopes of an increase in the terms now dashed.
ScottishPower's chief executive Ian Robinson said that the document
was very weak and that it fell far short of the integrated electricity
company's offer. That is currently worth 1015p including a cash element
of 607p.
He pointed out that Manweb says that the value of the rump of the Rec
is worth 376p after the dsitribution of the various cash elements. That
means that the total Manweb value is 926p or about 90p short of the bid.
Manweb envisages a new company, New Manweb, acquiring the existing
entity to enable cash to be distributed as a capital distribution rather
than as income to reduce tax.
Eyebrows were raised when Manweb, which is chaired by industrialist
Bill Goodall, forecast that profits in the current year will decline
from #139.9m to #127.2m but recover to #139.6m in the year to March
1997.
But the latest figure includes a recovery of distribution revenues of
over #14m which effectively means that 1996-97 profits, without this
element, would drop below those for the year to March 1995. This year's
profit forecast is also after bearing the reduction in revenues
following Professor Littlechild's regulatory review, amounting to #52m,
offset by cost savings rising in the current year from #46m to #61m.
But the real surprise is the expectation that gearing or the level of
debt to shareholders funds would rise to 160% after paying out #278m to
shareholders to raise debt to towards #400m. Manweb chief executive John
Roberts emphasised that the figures had been calculated conservatively
but gearing would not drop below 130% before the year 2000.
If the ScottishPower bid lapses, then Manweb will pay out a special
dividend of 50p with a tax credit of 12p which would be payable only to
some shareholders as well as another 203p cash.
In addition, there will be an issue of Preference shares worth 125p,
and possibly carrying an interest rate of 10%, using those issued by
Northern Electricity in its financial restructuring as a guide. Later,
172p of shares will be forthcoming from Manweb's stake in the National
Grid if, and when, that is floated, possibly in 1997.
In addition, there will be a conventional dividend of 29.8p for the
current year which is the same as that for 1994-95, followed by a 7%
rise to 31.9p in the subsequent year. It is intended to grow dividends
by this amount until the end of the decade.
Mr Roberts added that it is in customers best interests for Manweb to
remain independent as it had invested #400m since privatisation and
charges were 14% lower in real terms.

THE outcome of negotiations between Perth-based insurance group
General Accident and bid prospect Provident Mutual, the life insurer and
pensions specialist, is unlikely to be known much before the end of this
month.
Market rumour, which was perhaps too close to the mark for General
Accident's comfort, forced the Perth-based group to confirm on Thursday
evening that it was in discussions with Provident Mutual which ''may or
may not lead to an acquisition''.
A successful conclusion of talks would probably herald General
Accident's biggest acquisition since the late-eighties, when it acquired
the New Zealand Insurance Corporation for #376m.
The Perth-based group is keen to build up greater expertise in the
pensions field. About 80% of Provident Mutual's business is
pensions-related.

BANFFSHIRE distiller Macallan-Glenlivet, pleasantly surprised by its
continuing strength in the US, yesterday announced a 14% increase in
interim pre-tax profits to #2.93m.
''The Macallan'' single malts -- the company's sole range -- also
remain popular in Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, and sales
have moved ahead in the UK in spite of the most recent 26p-a-bottle duty
hike.
Managing director Willie Phillips, who attributes the strong
performance in the US to what is in ''The Macallan'' bottle, said:
''Things are going well in America. We are surpised they have gone so
well for so long.''
First-half turnover was up 8% at #7.70m. The dividend for the six
months to end-June was raised 15% to 0.47p.
However, the board expects the anticipated rise in full-year profits
to be below the 14% growth achieved in the first half.
Commenting on the industry as a whole, Mr Phillips believes companies
must stop competing on the basis of ''less-than-realistic'' prices. He
does not believe low prices are sensible in terms of replacement of
stock and the longer-term interests of the industry.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's 26p-a-bottle duty increase, announced in
December's mini-Budget, exacerbated difficulties in the domestic market,
Macallan-Glenlivet said. It added that the duty hike continued an
unjust, and widening, bias in favour of imported wines and other
lower-taxed alcohol products.
In 1994, Macallan-Glenlivet lifted pre-tax profits by 17% to #6.69m.
The company's shares were yesterday unchanged at 215p.

IF the tattooed Angel of Death is no more than a phantasm then she has
done us a favour. Whether the elegant priest was havering from the
pulpit at Dungarvan, his sermon no more than a naive morality tale, he
has at least shed light through the chinks in our armoury of
self-delusion.
Aids: the gay plague, retribution for junkies' bad habits, a deadly
Malthusian epidemic controlling by killing the promiscuous populaces of
sub-Saharan Africa. All those soothing comfort blankets to wrap around
our fears.
Sure, the Aids myths continue to abound. No more so than in the Times
with its stubborn refusal to apologise for a long, vindictive crusade --
now discredited -- which sought to convince us that we were conned by
the scientific establishment. That, somehow, this is not a problem for
heterosexuals, for us, for our children, for society at large. It was
just a thrilling retributive plague on the pervs and the promiscuous and
the self-destructive.
Now along comes a priest with Kennedy credentials and a Rolex and
Hollywood good looks and his tale of an avenging woman maddened by
distress sowing death among his flock. Within hours, the Questing Angels
flock to the town with their mobile phones and modems and scepticism:
the Avenging Angels, in the shape of the Irish medical establish,
descend to visit scorn on the curate and the scientific validity of the
story.
You have to sleep with a woman more than 500 times to get the virus,
insists a man who should know better. Yes, it's more difficult to
transmit the virus from female to male. But why doesn't the former Aids
co-ordinator tell us that the level of infectivity is the crucial risk
factor?
There's been no increase in numbers seeking Aids tests, soothes
another Dr Doubting Thomas. Anyway, squawk the medical men, we have
condom machines in the toilets of the town. Now, let us for a moment
stand back from the mawkish drama of it all. Let us look at the context.
This is a country where the health service is dominated by some of the
most reactionary of religious ideas. Where a child raped by an adult is
forced into court seeking a termination, and refused.
Would you wonder that the fearful might want tests in the safe
anonymity of a big city or the relatively non-judgmental private clinics
and secular NHS of London?
This is a country which, boasts the leading consultant in sexual
diseases, teaches its people to practice abstinence first, to question
their choice of partner next and -- lastly -- tells sinners to use a
condom.
This is a country which has shut its eyes to levels of HIV in its
population. The virus is rife in Dublin's prison population. Yet there
is a denial of its reach in the wider community, according to
researchers here.
The priest did not think to question those men who came for help about
their previous sexual history or whether they had been in prison or if
they had used drugs.
If the story is a religious fantasy, repaying more in contemplation of
the mind that dreamt it up than in any investigation of its objective
truth, it offers still an uneasy sense of a wider denial of the reality
of what Aids means and of the prejudices we cling to. In contravention
of all the irrefutable scientific evidence we continue to view it as
something that concerns others, not ourselves.
This week, researchers at the Centre for Research on Drugs and Health
Behaviour published a paper on drug use, sexual risk and sexual safety,
in the journal Drug Link.
It offers some uncomfortable truths, not least that HIV is primarily a
sexually transmitted disease. The researchers found that HIV prevalence
among drug injectors has stabilised. Condoms tended to be used where
safer sex was the norm, as in first-time encounters between men.
So, while drug users had reduced the risk of contracting HIV through
contaminated needles, and homosexual men practised safer sex,
heterosexuals have still to heed the warnings. The researchers found a
relatively high level of dishonesty between partners about sexual
history, drug use, and HIV status. Unprotected sex, they say, remains
the norm in all heterosexual relationships.
Many sexual encounters are highly ambiguous, lacking clarity over how
far things will go: too soon, you risk a red-faced rejection, too late
and it could be literally too late.
Maybe there really is a moral here: that Aids should be a concern for
all our communities. It is here in our midst and it is more deadly to go
on denying that reality and act on it than to question the existence of
the tattooed avenger.

West of Scotland writers are not only limiting themselves and their
countrymen, they are limiting the views of outsiders as well, argues
David Hall.
IF Walter Scott set foot in a West of Scotland pub today (or, for that
matter, a writers' group), he would be greeted with the silence normally
reserved in Westerns for unwelcome strangers entering the saloon.
The explanation lies in the West of Scotland's conception of itself as
. . . well . . . Scotland. The West of Scotland is the real Scotland,
the home of what Scotland stands for (which, it seems, is working-class
virtue, class hatred, and Anglophobia) while other regions and other
Scots are less representative. The exceptions to this rule are the
Gaelic-speaking islanders. It is impossible for West of Scotland Man to
out-authenticise a Gael: on both language and history he is easily blown
away, for the islanders have a tongue of greater antiquity and a record
of genuine suffering.
Yet while the West's pretensions will always be exposed in the
presence of the Gael, they very rarely are, for Gaels write in Gaelic,
which (despite its current revival) is still read by a fraction of the
population, most of whom do not live on the mainland.
Love it, loathe it, or sprinkle it with dialect, English is the main
Scottish language and in the literature produced in English, the West of
Scotland rules the roost. Since our most successful writers are drawn
from the working class, the West gets the literature it wants:
proletarian romanticism on the one hand, bleak urban realism on the
other. The reading public laps up both, presumably because each
satisfies an important social need: the romanticism gives it a warm
glow, the realism sets it virtuously aflame.
It is no surprise that when working-class writers fall out, it tends
to be over which of them has captured the real working-class experience,
which is a genuine man of the people, or which has remained one, despite
material success. Accusations of selling-out are tediously commonplace,
credibility of dialogue being among the acid tests: ''working-class
people don't talk like that'' is a favourite carp.
The same set of attitudes appears in TV and cinema, with the same
limiting results. Taggart, STV's answer to the problem of how to
televise McIlvanney's Laidlaw without paying the author, invariably
contains a scene in which the trail of clues leads to the drawing-room
of a posh Glasgow home, where Taggart and Lady La-di-La exchange verbal
uppercuts, before the viewer gives it to Taggart on points: it is always
the little man who, pausing at the door, gets the last punch in before
the bell. Now that his character has forsaken us for that crime-free
metropolis in the sky (did even he, one wonders, weary of the plots?)
the scriptwriters have a chance to improve.
Which brings us to Scottish flicks. Seen Rob Roy yet? What did you
think? I know what I thought, watching Liam Neeson attempt to roar like
a rampant lion before beating the flashy swordsmanship of Tim Roth's
odious English villain. Here we go again, I thought.
It is no exaggeration to claim that all classes other than the working
class are seriously under-fictionalised in West of Scotland literature,
which suffers from an inverted social pyramid. The middle or upper
classes rarely appear in novels and when they do, it is in two
dimensions (or less). They are stooges, brought in to behave badly, so
as to underscore the virtues of the working-class hero.
Middle-class academics, for instance, can always be relied upon to
address the hero pretentiously and at excessive length, provoking
laconic put-downs intended to prove that while the middle class is
assumed to know about the finer things in life, real insight lies with
the workers. (No prizes for guessing who I'm talking about here.)
But a novelist has a duty to humanity to represent it to the reader as
faithfully and as accurately as possible. This Scott was able to do --
partly because he was a genius, partly because his legal work and the
democratic nature of Edinburgh tavern-life offered insights into every
social class: as a novelist, he was not limited to writing convincingly
about his own.
With the exception of octogenarian Robin Jenkins, the same is not true
of today's West of Scotland writers. The chances of McIlvanney or Kelman
creating a character like Lady Runcie-Campbell in The Cone-Gatherers are
equivalent to those of either man accepting the Booker Prize in a
tuxedo: neither would, because he has too much, you know, integrity.
And neither writes the kind of novels that I want to read. I do not
wish to sound prescriptive, for only a fool would attempt to dictate to
authors their subject matter, characters, and themes. We all want
variety. But at present, this is precisely what is lacking.
Novels fail to satisfy because of their narrow social focus. They just
aren't big enough. Ours is a kaleidoscopic city and it needs a novelist
to match, one able to weave plot and characters around those aspects of
life which most often bring us within each other's orbit: law, money,
politics, love.
Other writers manage it. Take Allan Massie. Massie does not hail from
the West of Scotland, nor is he working-class-and-proud-of-it, nor does
he share the attitudes under discussion. Massie is one of nature's
cravat-wearers, educated at Glenalmond and Cambridge. He is right wing
and a champion of the Union. He is also Scotland's leading novelist, the
one most resembling Scott (of whom he has written an imaginary
autobiography, The Ragged Lion).
It is Massie who most fulfils the crowning criteria of
quality-in-quantity over an extended period of time. After a
comparatively slight literary debut, Change and Decay In All Around I
See, Massie has given us, among other works, a
state-of-modern-Scotland-murder-novel, a
state-of-the-Scottish-aristocracy novel, a state-of-modern-Italy novel
(for Massie, like Jenkins, has taught abroad) and -- beginning with
Augustus -- a trilogy of state-of-the-Roman-Empire novels.
I find Massie more interesting and satisfying than any West of
Scotland novelist, because he is sufficiently fascinated by -- and
knowledgeable about -- far more things to want to write novels about
them. If, unlike Scott, he does not quite contain the country within
him, he comes closer to it than his West of Scotland counterparts, which
is just as well, for they are not just read by a local audience:
southerners are listening in to the squeals and bangings coming through
their north-facing wall and forming their own opinions about what it
means.
West of Scotland writers are not only limiting themselves and their
countrymen, they are limiting the views of outsiders as well. Novels
should destroy stereotypes, not reinforce them.
Having accused two of Scotland's leading writers of inability to
characterise outside their own class, I had better produce some
evidence. Let's begin with Chapter 14 of The Papers of Tony Veitch,
McIlvanney's follow-up to Laidlaw. In this scene, our proletarian hero
is in Glasgow University club bar, seeking leads on a missing student.
It is the first time he has returned since dropping out of university at
the end of his first year (after passing his exams, McIlvanney is quick
to tell us -- and it is essential that he do so, to prevent us from
dismissing the anti-academicism that follows as sour grapes, motivated
by failure).
But the fact that McIlvanney cares about whether his character passed
or not rather gives the game away, for although certain writers want to
reject the bourgeoisie and all associated institutions, they insist on
this being a one-way exchange: Laidlaw must be allowed to reject
university, without it rejecting him. Next, Laidlaw talks to Veitch's
former tutor, within earshot of a dialogue between two other academics.
Listening to them, Laidlaw is glad that he left when he did, for he
''didn't want to be included in that clique of mutually supportive
opinions that so often passes for culture'':
''A lot of what passes for intellectuality's just polysyllabic
prejudice,'' he thinks out loud (as one does).
By using the word ''polysyllabic'', Laidlaw reveals himself to be
something of a bogus anti-intellectual, for a true anti-intellectual
would content himself with ''big''. Making critical use of the
polysyllable ''polysyllabic'' is having your cake and eating it.
Vietch's tutor, questioned about the student's character, prefaces his
reply by observing (as one would): ''Academicism, of course, can be
mental formaldehyde.''
There is a great deal more of this, in what is easily the weakest
chapter in the book. It is weak because it is unconvincing; it is only
because most reviewers are themselves academics that they lack the guts
to say so: no-one wants to be thought of as not being able to take it.
Numerous scholars of my acquaintance are just as streetwise as Laidlaw
and more successful in their private and family lives. So what is
McIlvanney playing at? He was better when he was younger, as he shows in
his first novel, Remedy Is None:
Professor Aird shuffled his notes and took off his glasses. Charlie
liked these moments. The professor could express more with his face than
with words. Charlie remembered the time he had demolished the Chicago
school of critics with one eloquent eyebrow.
This is the university I remember.
Kelman doesn't like the middle classes either. In this scene from the
Booker Prize-winning novel, How Late It Was, How Late, Sammy (who has
recently gone blind) visits his local Lubianka, the doctor's surgery.
The heartlessness of the middle-class professional is quickly
established.
Would you sit down over there please. Sorry doctor, I'm blind, I'm no
sure where ye're talking about. Two steps forward five to your right.
The doctor carried on talking before Sammy had found the seat.
In the interrogation which follows, the doctor reveals other negative
character traits, like impatience and testiness. He is quite prepared to
keep a blind man waiting three long minutes in uncertainty between
questions, even when not preoccupied with a physical examination.
Inconvenienced, he will happily pull social and educational rank,
implying that his working-class patient is ignorant of the meaning of
everyday words.
Is there any record of blindness in your family? Parents or brothers
and sisters. Grandparents. My mother and father both wore glasses;
Constantly? Eh . . . All the time?
As with McIlvanney, language is not so much used as abused by the
middle-class character. Visual stimuli. Sightloss capacity. Found
dysfunction. Poor Sammy has no defences and becomes increasingly
frustrated, bringing the consultation to an end in classic (as it were)
Kelman fashion. A depressing scene, though not for the reasons he
intended.
But I spoke of big novels. By big, I do not necessarily mean long. In
comparatively slender works like Kidnapped and Catriona, Robert Louis
Stevenson (another tavern-drinking Edinburgh lawyer) offers us
characters such as David Balfour, Captain Hoseason, Lord Advocate
Prestongrange and his beautiful daughter, Barbara. These appear in a
succession of powerful scenes, all of which are beyond the range of
Kelman and McIlvanney.
Remember Balfour's first meeting with lawyer Rankeillor, on the road
to claiming his inheritance? Like Laidlaw and Sammy, honest Davie is
confronted with the language of the educated middle class:
''And now,'' says he, ''if you have any business, pray be brief and
come swiftly to the point. Nec gemino bellum Troianum orditur ab ovo --
do you understand that?'', says he, with a keen look. ''I will do even
as Horace says, sir,'' I answered, smiling, ''and carry you in media
res.''
Rankeillor, we are told, ''placed more scraps of Latin in his speech .
. . but it was all uttered with a fine geniality of eye and manner which
went far to conquer my distrust''. Of course it was, because in
Stevenson's Scotland, lawyers are not by definition scheming, corrupt,
and obsessed with social and educational one-upmanship. But if we
re-read the scene as McIlvanney might have written it:
''Nec gemino bellum Troianum orditur ab ovo,'' said Rankeillor, ''do
you understand that?'' He used Latin like a crutch. Kick it away and he
would crumple. ''I'll have a dram from that bottle ye keep behind The
Aeneid,'' replied Laidlaw.
And Kelman?
''Nec gemino bellum Troianum orditur ab ovo, said the lawyer. Do you
understand that? Would English make it any easier, Mr Samuels? Scots? Ya
****ing eedjit! Who the **** d'ye think ye are, spouting Latin at me? Ye
can take yer ****ing House of Shaws and stuff it up yer **** ya ****ing
****!
Doesn't quite work, does it? But the lack of variety in West of
Scotland fiction is only partly the fault of writers like Kelman and
McIlvanney. One major reason working-class fiction dominates is that the
other classes have become artistically inert. It's really the fault of
stockbrokers and accountants, and teachers like me, that the variety
isn't there.
Major writers of the past included magistrates, school inspectors,
customs officials, sea captains, and the son of a family of lighthouse
engineers. Why aren't their descendants doing it now?
I am well aware that just who and what Walter Scott was remain matters
of opinion and topics of scholarly debate. But what is less open to
debate is that Scott, more than any other Scottish writer, can be said
to contain Scotland within him.
The Scott I have in mind is not so burdened by debt that he cannot
write what he pleases, nor is he slave to that three-volume convention
which made us throw in the towel on his home-readers at school and vow
never to pick them up again. The Scott I am thinking of is the one who
(as Buchan puts it) ''stands at the end securely among the prophets, for
he gathers all things, however lowly and crooked, within the love of
God.''

It's a long way from Hillhead to the Himalayas but to a film producer,
moving mountains is all in a day's work. ALASDAIR MARSHALL speaks with
Iain Smith.
IN preparation for his next role, Brad Pitt is growing a beard,
learning rudimentary Tibetan, and having asthma tests. In preparation
for his next role, Iain Smith, from Hillhead, is wheeling and dealing
with the Tibetan authorities.
Early next year the two will head for the rarefied air of the
Himalayas to shoot the $50m TriStar production Seven Years in Tibet.
Pitt will be the star and Smith co-producer.
In the historic tradition of doughty Scots travellers, Smith -- once
nicknamed Smudger -- is unlikely to lose his way.
Inaccessible locations are a speciality of the unobtrusive Glaswegian,
whose low-profile is in direct contrast to the big-budget movies he
produces.
On his rise to the more rarefied levels of the industry, he has
criss-crossed the globe like Harrison Ford at the start of an Indiana
Jones adventure. The dotted trail leads from the white sands of Morar
(Local Hero) to the jungles of Thailand (The Killing Fields) and South
America (The Mission) and on to teeming Calcutta (City of Joy) and Costa
Rica (1492).
As Waterworld's Kevin Costner would attest, making movies in exotic
locations can be problematical and expensive. Smith is renowned for
laying the groundwork that brings logistically complex projects in, on
time and within budget, while cosseting temperamental stars like Robert
De Niro, Patrick Swayze, and Gerard Depardieu along the way.
A key figure on locations where extra days can cost millions, he has
arguably lost out in the feeding frenzy for credits and never had due
recognition for his work.
His latest picture, Mary Reilly, was not filmed abroad. It was shot
near London, with a couple of days in Edinburgh. It was not without
problems, though these lay outwith Iain Smith's province.
It features Julia Roberts, unlikely in a Victorian upstairs-downstairs
pinny as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde's maid. The screenwriters were
understandably stymied for a spell when the call came for a ''happier''
ending.
With the Robert Louis Stevenson spin-off completed, Smith, who as a
schoolboy shot his first movie on the roof of a Glasgow kirk, is
preparing to shoot his next one on the roof of the world.
Since he bought the rights to Seven Years in Tibet almost a decade
ago, the project has been close to his heart . . . and his wallet has
been beating even faster. (The recurring cost of renewing the rights now
totals $200,000.)
''In high-concept terms you could call it 'Dances With Wolves In The
Mountains','' he tells me from his office at Pinewood Studios.
''It is an epic tale of adventure. It has an epic landscape. It has an
epic part. The kind of part an actor would die for.
''Richard Gere, who is a friend of the Dalai Lama, was very interested
at one stage but he's too old now. Brad Pitt is the hottest young actor
in the movies. He's good-looking, he's a good actor, and he's strong
physically. He's ideal.''
It's a case of gilded youth playing gilded youth.
A bestseller in the 1950s, Seven Years in Tibet is an extraordinary
autobiographical account of high adventure written by the German
mountaineer Heinrich Harrer.
The first man to climb the north face of the Eiger and an Olympic gold
medallist, Harrer was in the Himalayas when the Second World War was
declared. Interned by the British, he escaped and decided to head for
the hills instead of opting for the safer route to the sea.
With a full tank of derring-do but no equipment or oxygen, the
maverick mountaineer's chances of survival were slim to non-existent. He
almost died on the perilous ascent before reaching the mysterious locked
kingdom of Tibet.
There he became a close friend and confidante of the then 14-year-old
Dalai Lama and experienced a spiritual enlightenment that changed his
life for ever. (Harrer, now living in Lichtenstein, is still active in
his support of Tibetan liberation from Chinese occupation.)
''I read the book as a kid and I used to dream about Tibet,'' Smith,
who will co-produce with French director Jean Jacques Arnaud, said. ''I
first optioned it about 10 years ago.
''I took the project to David Puttnam when he was boss at Columbia.
But when he got the boot and a hostile new management took over, I was
out on my ear.
''Disney got interested and picked up the costs for $400,000. But it
never gelled and I was out on the street again.
''The key to the project's third reincarnation was a script by Becky
Johnson, who wrote Prince of Tides. She caught the essence of the book.
It was enough to convince Jean Jacques, who had big hits with The Name
Of The Rose and The Bear, and TriStar picked it up from Disney for $1m a
year ago. Now we have a green light.
''That's what I love about the business. One moment you're twiddling
your thumbs with nothing to do . . . then you've got too much. That's
the way I like it.''
Born in Hillhead 43 years ago, Iain's mother, Anne Urquhart, was an
actress with the Unity Theatre. His father, Nathanial Smith, was a
notable figure in the city's West End. An artist who refused to
compromise by teaching, he earned a living with a decorator's business
and was a founding member of the philosophical Hours Club. Iain is no
slouch as a philosopher himself, according to early employer Bill
Forsyth.
''He's a thinker who develops a creative strategy to fit the
circumstances,'' Forsyth said. ''He covers every conceivable problem or
snag that could develop before it occurs. He's brilliant at what he does
and has probably never been given the credit he is due.''
Forsyth's former partner and fellow director Charlie Gormley concurs.
''Smithy never liked our slapdash ways but he's a heavy hitter today.
He's a very, very clever line producer. He takes everybody's dreams to
difficult and dangerous locations and makes them work, and that is no
mean feat.''
What of Smith's own take on his talents? ''There may be something
Calvinistic about it but I've always enjoyed the challenge of working in
difficult places,'' he said. ''I have the feeling that if a movie is
difficult to shoot it will be interesting to watch.''
TAKE ONE: The roof of St Bride's Church in Hyndland. The 14-year-old
tyro Smith is already exhibiting his aptitude as a fixer in persuading
the minister to allow him to shoot an 8mm thriller with some pals.
TAKE TWO: On the beach at Morar for Local Hero. Producer David Puttnam
has taken to his foxhole leaving line producer Smith on the sand dunes
soothing fevered journalists, who won't accept that Burt Lancaster
doesn't really want to speak to them.
TAKE THREE: There is big trouble on the Calcutta set of City of Joy.
Enraged religious zealots are stoning Patrick Swayze. ''I had to
restrain him. He wanted to gub them,'' the unflappable Smith reports.
''I said, 'Just smile at them and walk to the car, Patrick.' He said,
'I'll do it in five minutes so it looks like my idea.'
TAKE FOUR: Gerard Depardieu is proving a handful in Costa Rica while
making the Christopher Columbus epic 1492. ''Gerard was the soul of
discretion while we were shooting the court sequences in Spain but he
got a bit unruly in the New World. He spent a fair bit of time in the
drinking dens sorting out the locals. There was never any side from
Gerard though. He was a great guy.
''The big stars can be difficult and badly behaved. Doing something
out of the ordinary can seem like a good idea when a star is sitting in
an air-conditioned lounge in Beverly Hills. But when they experience the
reality of a difficult location it can be much tougher than they
thought.
''Some stars are lonely and insecure. It's understandable. It's their
image that's on the screen and if they are involved in a flop it's their
image that suffers.''
Married for 20 years and the father of three children, Iain Smith's
life is sweet today. But there were no grants when he attended the
School of Film Technology at Covent Garden, so he worked at a cinema
box-office and as a barman.
His first taste of big-budget movie-making was with the movie Death
Watch, which was shot in Glasgow. Then came the start of his association
with David Puttnam when Chariots of Fire was filmed in Scotland.
''I don't deal with the conceptual side as much as some producers,''
he said. ''My main strength is getting things done. The secret of
working effectively abroad is a very Scottish thing. I'm very straight
with people and I speak common sense.
''Before I go anywhere I familiarise myself with the history,
geography, and politics of the country. Then I'll spend a lot of time
there socialising with people and getting to know the local business
community. That's how you find out if the Minister of Finance is about
to get bumped-off.
''A lot of money is spent setting things up, but it's worth it. A firm
foundation is essential on tricky projects.
''One of the great sadnesses is that dictatorships are easy to deal
with. Dealing with a democracy is much more difficult.''

IHAD answered her question in the most civil terms, at a pace that to
the average Glaswegian would be termed snail-like. In the arrogant
manner monopolised by upper-class Londoners she slurred mockingly,
''Could I have that in English please?''
Until this, it had been a good meal, if only because of the company. I
had been sitting next to Graeme. On reaching the restaurant, we were
told that it was a gourmet's evening (as opposed to a good evening, I
presume). The meal was being cooked, sorry composed, by one of the
country's top chefs, a bit of a food loony by all accounts. Being a chef
must be the only line of work where having a tendency to throw tantrums
is seen as an indication of talent. (''Of course he's a good butcher,
did you see the way he punched that customer?'')
This chef, we were told, has a distinctive ''Food Philosophy''. Only
chefs and architects are pretentious enough to believe that their work
has to have some philosophical basis. Has a plumber ever said ''I
usually challenge the traditional Western way of viewing the U-bend'',
or the baker ''I feel that my bread rolls make a statement about our
acceptance of perspective''?
I'm not a particular fan of gourmet foods. I don't mind spicy foods
but I can't take foods that are unpredictable. Who can understand these
guys who have some bizarre need to analyse tastes that bit too much?
That woman that does the wine-tasting on the Food and Drink programme is
so over the top that she managed to become a cliche within a matter of
weeks of appearing on the telly. Her analysis of tastes manages to be at
once so detailed and yet so useless. If I'd gone to the trouble of
making a sophisticated claret, the last thing I'd want is Jilly Goolden
telling the world that it tastes strongly of old leather boots.
On the Christmas edition, by contrast, she made a fruit punch out of
five types of citrus fruit. Two minutes later she was telling us
excitedly: ''I think I can taste a bit of grapefruit, some orange, maybe
a bit of lime.'' Of course you could you silly bint. You made the stuff!
Anyway, this bloke was into the dogma of complimentation, and he chose
the wines as well as the food. The idea is that the taste of the wine
should supplement and contrast with the taste of the food. I wondered
why there were nine glasses beside each setting: as it turned out, we
were expected to use each one. A different wine being served with each
course.
When the first course was offered, I should just have walked out. It
was obviously not going to be an easy night. The menu said we were going
to have oysters and asparagus in gelatine. Do you know what he gave us?
A slice of oysters! In gelatine! At least, you're probably thinking, we
got a glass of wine. That may be true, but the only problem was that the
chef had decided that the ideal wine to compliment the delicate sourness
of a piece of stale seafood in cold clear jelly would be one that tasted
like a soup made from stale carpets. With my good manners coming to the
fore, I ate the food, trying not to taste it as I chewed, washing it
down with wine that I was also trying not to taste. I resolved not to
look at the menu again, and in best football-speak, I planned to take
each course as it comes.
The second course was an indeterminate piece of meat on a bed of
couscous. Couscous is one so-called food that my wife Veres keeps trying
to persuade me is a good idea. The debate consists of her serving it up
and me returning it sharpish, almost untouched, into the bin. Couscous
might be OK in the kind of country where they haven't yet taken to the
concept of the chip shop.
For those who have never tasted it, I would warn you away from it,
except that there would be hell to pay in terms of letters from the
British Council for Couscous Promotion.
The third course will live with me for a long time. Although I said
that I would not read the menu, when you see that you're due to get a
portion of bone marrow coming up, it doesn't slip the mind too easily.
Blissful ignorance would have been fine, but they didn't even have the
courtesy to find the French word for bone marrow.
For anyone who's thinking of trying it, can I just offer the following
advice. Don't. Honestly, bone marrow is the kind of dish that makes
couscous seem like pie and chips. Graeme loved it, but he's from
Paisley: he might be expected to like glorified dog food.
Why did I not just ask for different foods? Good manners I suppose.
The bloke next to me had pled vegetarianism and, while we were getting
all this, he was making do with various mushroom and fish dishes.
Vegetarians are often smug nutters, but this one was acting like King
Smug of the Self-satisfied People. ''Yummo! That bone marrow looks
delicious. How am I going to cope with this poached salmon?''
Vegetarian or not, if he carried on much longer he was going to be
getting a knuckle sandwich.
By the time the meal came to an end I had fought my way through nine
unpalatable dishes (OK, eight, the chocolate pudding was all right) and
had managed to taste eight varieties of sock juice (OK, seven; the
pudding wine tasted like cough syrup with vodka in it. Worse than that,
some braying upper-class twit suddenly found my Scottishness a matter of
some amusement.
The last thing I would subscribe to is Scottish Nationalism, but if
there's one thing that gets my dander up it's people who, through either
snobbery or prejudice, have a right good laugh at my Scottish accent.
It's not that I hate the English, I just hate snobs.
At that moment, though, my nerve failed me. Instead of ''I think
you'll find the correct statement is 'pardon me, I didn't quite catch
that','' I could only mumble my answer again with play school slowness.
The only thing that tasted worse than the bone marrow was the humble
pie.

RADIO Scotland's Speaking Out this week was about the Sunday ferry
crossing on Stornoway. Much was said about the respect for a culture,
the unique attraction of a calm day of rest -- and then the voices of
liberal reason prevailed.
An American lady asked the man of the church where exactly, chapter
and verse, did the Bible say you couldn't hang up your washing on a
Sunday. There was a resentment about the fire-and-brimstone cliche
perpetrated by the ignored mainlanders but at the same time the image of
swings being chained up by the parkies so that children were not tempted
to transgress God's law brought the issue into focus.
For all the measured tones, for all the strained reasonableness, what
actually came across was the dogmatic belief that non-believers cannot
''opt out'' from God's law: so individualism could be dismissed and
democracy misinterpreted.
When it was suggested that the devout were not being coerced to set
foot on any offending ferry the reply came back like ticker tape that
Sunday ferries would mean people would be forced to work, shopkeepers
would be themselves coerced into servicing the marauding hordes. (Sorry,
that was my expression -- but the illiberalism expressed was turning my
vocabulary a little rococo.)
Ruth Wishart, with a wonderful sly yet polite question, asked whether
it was then acceptable to a person holding these tenets to read a
newspaper on a Monday -- because folk had been working on a Sunday to
produce it.
There followed a great pause which made for great listening.
Asking friends and colleagues about the chaining up of swings, a
practice I had never heard of, was fascinating. An actress friend (sorry
if that's got a dodgy ring to it brethren) who had heard the programme
made the point that the activity of play is not a luxury for little ones
but a necessity of development.
Others warned me that if I wrote what I thought of such a blatant
nonsense I would be placing myself in a sectarian camp (now camp I might
be, but sectarian no).
Unlike the fundamentalists of the parks, I believe in the rights of a
child to swing, slide, and generally behave like a wean on a Sunday. A
Muslim woman phoning in made the sensible point that while she avoided
pork, alcohol, and gambling, her beliefs did not involve intrusive
restriction on other people's habits.
The ludicrousness of a man talking about another person's domestic
practices (the washing hang-up) in terms of Biblical law with such
superiority and pompous rigidity made bleakly funny listening. And the
claims made for this dogma's pretended openness, were even dafter.
Electricity introduced to the churches was hailed as proof. Personally,
as a condemned opter-out, I think candles are prettier, but it doesn't
stop me switching on the tumble dryer.
(Yes, the children's clothes needed drying, after they had made
themselves happily manky in the park.)
Another friend of mine told me that in fifties Troon, Sunday fun was
managing to swing inspite of the chains.
In the second episode of the Women Of The World series (BBC Radio
Scotland), Votes For Women, the topic was the quota system for women MPs
introduced by the ANC. I have always had a liberal's ambivalence about
quotas but I found the argument convincing. There is no need to be a
token figure or behave like one if an imbalance of patriarchal history
is being redressed.
The need to redesign the infrastructure is strong: one-third of the
MPs in Mandela's government are women and their insistence that creches
be provided to make that shift possible makes utter sense.
And they won't be repressing the swings.

RIGHT. The scene is set for an interesting final to the Scottish
International Piano Competition tomorrow night in the Royal Concert
Hall, which will feature four concertos with the Royal SNO and the young
pianists who made it through the semi-finals.
The four are: Lori Kaufman (Beethoven's Fourth Concerto), Maria
Rostotsky (Liszt's First), Charles Owen (Beethoven Four again) and
Giampaolo Stuami (Prokofiev Three). Now, the way they've all played so
far guarantees nothing about how they will cope with a concerto, but,
all things being equal, there will be poetry, superbly organised
musicianship, intelligence, and sheer dynamite -- in that order -- from
these four.
American Kaufman is a poetic player whose sensitivity should make for
an interesting account of the Beethoven; ''fragrant'' was the word I
used to describe her playing. Rostotsky, a Russian-born Swedish girl --
she is 20 next week -- gave a display of stunningly lucid pianism in her
semi yesterday, including an unmannered and highly touching account of
Beethoven's last piano sonata. The Liszt seems an odd choice; it will
test her physical power.
Charles Owen, whose Beethoven again I commented on in the semis, is
out of the best school of British pianism -- unaffected, naturalistic,
and with playing informed by brainwork. (The exemplar of the school,
John Lill, is one of the judges.) But the sensation of yesterday -- the
single one of the competition -- was Italian Stuami, who gave a
breathtaking recital with a spectacular version of Stravinsky's
Petrushka. Wait till you hear this boy. Prokofiev should be right up his
street.

FORMER Minister Sir Nicholas Scott is to face a challenge for the new
rock-solid Tory seat of Chelsea and Kensington, it emerged yesterday.
Ulster Minister Sir John Wheeler confirmed he had thrown his hat in
the ring.
He is likely to be just the first of a series of senior Tories to put
their names forward for the Conservative stronghold near the House of
Commons.
Local Tories decided at a meeting last week to open the seat to a
contest rather than back Sir Nicholas unopposed.
The former Minister for the Disabled could have difficulty winning the
nomination after he was recently arrested and breath-tested following an
accident involving a toddler.
It is still not clear if any charges will be brought.
Sir John insisted yesterday that he was not trying to oust Sir
Nicholas, but merely attempting to find another seat after the abolition
of his own Westminster North constituency.
Boundary changes have created havoc in Tory ranks, leaving some MPs
like former Chancellor Norman Lamont without a seat and others with
their majorities drastically cut.
The spectre of Tory MPs abandoning seats now set to fall to Labour,
and in some cases trying to oust party colleagues from safer seats, has
been ridiculed as the ''chicken run'' by Labour.
Chelsea and Kensington is a newly-merged seat. Sir Nicholas is
currently MP for Chelsea.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth last night warned a group of senior
Scottish businessmen in Glasgow about the pitfalls of a Scottish
parliament.
His warning was sounded against a backdrop of ''three years of broad
based recovery and rising employment''.
Mr Forsyth said that the OECD forecast the UK to be the fastest
growing major EU economy in 1995, as in 1994. ''There is every
opportunity for Scotland to continue to share fully in this growth,'' he
added.
His vision, however, was not confined to this year alone. Mr Forsyth
told them that, by next century, Scottish Enterprise aimed to create an
additional 25,000 businesses.
However, all of this progress was potentially at risk -- because the
culture of competition which the Tories sought to promote existed in a
largely hostile political environment.
''Only the Conservatives are genuinely and unreservedly committed to
free enterprise, and in Scotland we are a minority party.''
Mr Forsyth said the opponents of modernity were now trying to build a
sea-wall between themselves and the tide of economic liberation sweeping
across the rest of the world. That barrier was a Scottish Parliament.
''It is very bad news for business, the financial community and all
our wealth creators.
''Take inward investment. Where is the incentive to overseas investors
to involve themselves in an economy whose fiscal base is an income tax
rate 3p higher than in England, Wales and Northern Ireland?
''The problem with the Tartan Tax is not simply the anguish it will
provoke when individual taxpayers receive the hated brown envelope.
''It is a malign octopus whose tentacles reach graspingly into every
area of Scottish life. Higher taxation means higher wage demands. That,
in turn, blunts the competitive edge on which we would all agree our
prosperity depends.''
Mr Forsyth said Labour's whole devolution policy was a Heath Robinson
contraption held together with chewing gum and string.
After more than six years anguished debate over how many additional
members could stand on the point of a pin, the devolutionists were still
so divided and disorganised that they had to convert their planned
plenary meeting of the Constitutional Convention on the 26th of this
month into a mere executive meeting.
He said: ''They have set themselves a deadline of November 30 for
unveiling the final package. Painted into a corner, they are prepared to
scribble any daft scheme on the back of an envelope to create an
appearance of unity.''
Schools, he told the meeting, must be seed beds of competitiveness.
''We must persuade parents, teachers and pupils that competition creates
a general striving which raises the water-table of attainment.''
Mr Forsyth said he also wanted to carry forward John Major's programme
for giving schools more freedom and control over their own affairs.
''In the coming weeks we shall be exploring all the possible options
with people in the education world.''
Mr Forsyth also told them that the drug culture which largely fuelled
crime had become a threat to our very civilisation. ''That is why I am
glad, here in Strathclyde region, to have an opportunity of applauding
the police initiative known as Operation Eagle. I believe it may become
a blueprint for similar exercises elsewhere in the country.''
He added: ''The rescheduling of Temazepam, which I announced this
week, is another example of the Government's determination to come to
grips with the drugs problem.
''On the young offenders' front, so closely related to drug abuse,
community service orders must no longer be seen as a soft option. They
must involve hard physical work, not brutality, but visible effort with
offenders clearing up motorways or beaches in protective clothing which
advertises what they are.''

LA Rutherford is in floozy mode. Blonde hair haphazardly back-combed,
little black dress, can in one hand, fag in the other. She's standing,
more or less. And she's thinking, thinking the kind of sobering thoughts
that can crowd in when you've had one good drink too many. In company
with the excellent Annie Carvell and Ailie Cohen, she's seeking the
further shores of everyday happiness -- no guarantees, of course that
any of them will get there.
All Of Me is a bitter-sweet, funny, and clear-sighted piece about
growing up. About the big, positive schemes and dreams that eventually
turned into sour memories at the back of a sleepless mind. It all begins
when a wee girl looks out of a TV monitor and says: ''When I'm older I
think I'll have a great life.'' Moments later and Donna Rutherford is
confiding on the ups and downs of her life, rallying to reassure us, as
she sways slightly, that ''naw, naw, ah'll be awright.''
Later Annie Carvell -- old enough to be the child's granny -- will
pound the mic into her palm as she thinks of missed chances, the sound
thundering like a head banging against a wall. And Ailie Cohen -- maybe
ages with Donna? -- will fumble into declaring that, since she can't be
the person she is in dreams, she will simply never sleep again.
And while the video that mixes in with the live action neatly extends
our perception of the women -- Annie at home, for instance -- the text
mixes in telling fragments of song and a shrewd skein of myth and
children's story that edges the personal testimonies into something more
universal, a realm of vulnerabilities, frustrations, and hopes that is,
essentially, all of us.

PRESIDENT Jacques Chirac, fortunately for him, thrives in adversity --
his presidential election campaign, which saw him rise from depths of
unpopularity to the Elysee, proved it.
This winter, he is going to need all that courage: not only in the
field of international relations, which have absorbed so much of his
energy during the four months since his election; but, more trickily for
a man nicknamed ''le Bulldozer'', in the domain of sensitive reform at
home.
However grim they may be, the foreign problems of the moment will
finally go away -- the Bosnian crisis, even the furious worldwide
protests at France's resumption of nuclear tests in the Pacific should
die out next year.
There have even been rays of hope concerning the summertime spate of
terrorist bombings in France: police have identified, if not found, a
suspect, a 24-year-old delinquent of Algerian origin whose fingerprints
were found on an unexploded device. Some apparently significant arrests
were also made last week in Islamic circles in Lyon.
It is the health of the nation which, quite literally, showed itself
last week to be a more insidious problem for President Chirac's
government, and one capable of causing infinitely more political harm
than any number of bombs in the Pacific.
The problem is colossal and rising health costs. The free choice of
one's doctor among France's 110,000 GPs is a mainstay of the country's
welfare system. You take your pick and you pay -- #20 per visit is the
going rate. You then fill in a simple form and mail it, with details of
prescribed medicines, to a local health insurance centre which
reimburses 73%. Three-quarters of French people have extra insurance
which takes care of the rest.
A patient may see a specialist without recommendation from a GP and
nothing prevents the nervous from consulting as many doctors as they
wish. The latter, anxious to retain a faithful clientele, are given to
over-prescribing. The consultation, as a GP said last week, is the mass
and the medicine is the host. And the latter alone costs the State
nearly #8bn a year.
Proudly acknowledged as one of the most comprehensive and flexible in
the world, France's health insurance system, a running sore on the body
of public finance, is chronically in debt -- by #4bn this year.
Reforming it in depth, however, is only envisaged by right-wing
hot-heads and would be as politically perilous as meddling with the
legal minimum wage. The latter, discussed by Britain's Labour Party last
week, stands at around #8000 a year. In France, where it is a
40-year-old institution, to be earning le smic is synonymous with near
poverty.
Last Wednesday Health Minister Elisabeth Hubert, a doctor herself,
gently grasped the nettle and met leaders of the four medical unions to
examine the health deficit. Spending which should have risen by only 3%
for the whole of this year has shot up by 3.6% over the first seven
months alone.
Expecting a rude shock, union leaders were actually delighted by the
proposals of Dr Hubert, who, before Mr Chirac's election had threatened
tough measures against doctors who over-prescribed.
A ''personal medical diary'', which has long been demanded by doctors
in France, will be introduced over the next three years, to keep a
record of all patients' consultations and prevent them from shopping
around GPs. Doctors will have to conform to certain basic rules when
prescribing drugs and government health insurance controllers will have
computer access to see what any one doctor is prescribing and for what
ailments. However the government envisages no financial sections against
over-generous GPs. Irresponsible patients, on the other hand, could be
refused reimbursement.
Dr Hubert's moderate measures to reduce the health deficit are seen by
many observers here as a sop to the powerful medical and pharmaceutical
lobbies at the expense of patients. They are already contributing to the
health overdraft in the form of supplementary taxation.
Whatever her intentions, Dr Hubert's room for manoeuvre is small. On
the one hand are the doctors. On the other, the health insurance service
is pretty well controlled by the FO trades union which is determined to
defend the rights of patients. President Chirac has already shown how
wary he is of such union influence, especially in the civil service.
Elected after promising sweeping reforms, President Chirac looks as if
he will be increasingly bogged down in reality this winter.

THE past is another country and you can't get there from here. In
truth it is many countries, constructs of truth and fiction,
imagination, myth, memory and history, sometimes overlaid, sometimes
contiguous, sometimes worlds apart. The perspective of the peasant is
never the viewpoint of the prince.
The immediately striking thing about the prefatory instalment of the
BBC's huge, and hugely ambitious, The People's Century (Wednesday) was
the extraordinary period footage. In the year of cinema's centenary this
was apt, but it was something more than that. Alone in history the
twentieth century stands revealed (this being the operative word) as the
self-conscious age.
For the first time the species looked itself in the living face. The
shift in perception was so extraordinary we have yet to grasp what it
really means.
History ceased to be the victors' version or tales told by poets. It
ceased to be personal or dependent on flawed memories or uncertain
words. As the century opened objectivity arrived, however spurious the
idea might now seem. Suddenly memories were collective; suddenly we all
had a witness.
Yet what made The People's Century compelling was the hypnotic
interweaving of survivors' accounts with the footage. The clarity
visited upon the very old when they recall the far past was
counterpointed here by the ghostly figures who passed, smiling vaguely,
shouting silently, in their pomp or in their misery, across the screen.
Men and women magnificently aged spoke of a past the camera had caught
and preserved in emulsion, in time but not of it.
Thus a Frenchwoman who had seen Bleriot's flight across the Channel
recalled her childish excitement while the screen showed a frail,
puttering craft lift uncertainly into the air. Thus another child now
grown white-haired spoke of the old queen as we saw the venerable
imperial mother slumbering in state. A Russian man said to be 106 --
does Russia's long struggle with history breed longevity? -- spoke of
manning barricades in the failed revolution of 1905, and a survivor of
the Titanic disaster remembered the long, final silence after the
vessel's sinking while on film its four funnels still exhaled
soundlessly.
On this evidence, The People's Century is likely to be magnificent, an
inoculation against millennium fevers to come. It is grandiose, of
course, and debatable; histories always are. Because it is a product of
the age of the moving image it is liable, even obliged, to overlook the
written word. But as a glance over the world's shoulder, as a way of
looking back at where we have been and who we have been, it is unlikely
to be bettered.
There are 25 episodes to go: time marches on.
Time marches on, too, for the Proms. Indeed, it tramples over them.
After a century of concerts, the Omnibus Special (BBC1, Monday) on
this self-obsessively English event demonstrated that the years have
been less than kind.
This isn't to confuse the last night with the rest of the season, or
to cast aspersions on the music-lovers who must, by now, be heartily
sick of the manic Little Englanders who have given the event the
reputation it enjoys, if that's the word, among the general public. But
speaking as one given to wondering what Blake would have made of the
butchering of Jerusalem, it's hard not to conclude that all the fine
music in the world isn't worth this annual insult to our intelligence,
be it British, English or Scottish.
One obsessive boasted of having just paid his 1500th visit to the
Proms. He couldn't explain it (a ''disease'', apparently) but appeared
to think it didn't needed much explaining. We should be grateful, I
suppose, that it keeps him off the streets.
Mind you, few of us would want to venture out when the boys and girls
from Backup (BBC1, Thursday) are about. Ethnically mixed, corrected for
gender balance, with lots of personal problems, van-loads of
sensitivity, and a really caring and sharing attitude towards riot
shields and truncheons, they may not frighten the bad guys but they have
this reviewer peeping out from behind his fingers.
As a police unit they make for a really pretty decent acting ensemble;
as an acting ensemble their policing methods make even the layman
cringe. This, you can't help but feel, is doubtless because of all the
technical advice the series has had from real coppers.
In this week's episode yet another ex-soldier went berserk (the actor
with the short straw is the one who has to make ''post-traumatic stress
disorder'' sound like everyday dialogue) for reasons inadequately
explained.
Despite tons of gear and masses of manpower, the squad could not
actually lay hands on the paranoid para until he hid himself in a church
tower, accidentally dropped the machine pistol with which he had
intended to off his sister's betrothed, and allowed himself to be talked
down from a ledge by the sarge whose own problems don't bear thinking
about.
As is so often the case with cop shows, there was absolutely nothing
wrong with the acting. Some of it, last week and this, has been very
good indeed. But the demands of a genre in which tension is contrived
rather than created meant that the plot was full of holes so big even
the Serious Fraud Office would have spotted them.
Or was I the only one to hear the squad's boss tell them to search the
entire church, watch them fail to do any such thing, wonder why a
trained soldier would drop his gun so conveniently, and ask myself if
there wasn't another, half-way plausible way to arrive at the rooftop
finale? Whatever writers like to believe, viewers do notice this sort of
thing. It irritates the hell out of them.
As do the programme makers who give every appearance of defining new
ideas solely by their resemblance to old ideas. TV is, for example,
stuffed with cookery shows; we have an excess of them. What, therefore,
does the maitre'd at BBC2 propose for Tuesday night if not Rick Stein's
Taste of the Sea? Another eccentric chef, another BBC book, more recipes
for you to forget to try at home: the appetite vanishes.
On the same night, and at the same time, ITV was exhibiting a new,
brainless sit-com from the writer of the ineffably brainless Men
Behaving Badly. On Thursday, meanwhile, the BBC was showing A Question
of Sport with laughs, otherwise known as They Think It's All Over,
neatly man-marking Scottish's A Game of Two Halves.
Creativity? Variety? The century draws to a close, not with a bang but
a re-run.

Kota Kinabalu
RESCUERS began tonight to extract the charred bodies of 34 people
killed in Malaysia's worst air crash for nearly two decades.
A Malaysian Airlines (MAS) plane, carrying 49 passengers and a crew of
four, overshot the runway and ploughed into about 20 squatter houses
near the Sabah town of Tawau after arriving on a scheduled flight from
Kota Kinabalu.
Rescue officials said 18 people survived the crash and one person was
still missing.
''This is a terrible tragedy. We are very, very sad,'' said Malaysia's
Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik.
It was not clear why the twin-engined turbo-prop Fokker 50 crashed,
but officials said they had recovered its black box flight recorder.
''The black box will be sent to England for investigation. At this
point we do not want to speculate on the cause of the crash,'' Ling
said.
Witnesses and MAS ground staff at Tawau said they saw the plane
engulfed in flames and heard a loud explosion after it hit the nearby
shacks.
One survivor, MAS steward Kamarul Bahrin, said the plane had suddenly
slowed and then picked up speed just before the crash.
Authorities declined to comment on a television report that the
aircraft might have been trying to lift off after aborting its landing.
Another survivor, director of Tawau prison Jews Sinoh, said: ''It was
so sudden. I felt a hard hit. I just managed to crawl out of one of the
exits.''
Police said nine squatters were injured, two critically, but there
were no deaths.
Malaysia's worst air disaster was in 1977 when an MAS Boeing 737
airliner exploded in mid-air, killing all 100 people on board.--Reuter.

<RECORDNO>976355563</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of jobs could be on the line because of a ''back door''
public sector merger, an MP claimed yesterday.
Labour's Helen Liddell says a leaked document reveals secret plans to
merge the responsibilities of the Contributions Agency and the Inland
Revenue as part of a cash-saving exercise.
A memo setting out the plan was leaked to Mrs Liddell, the MP for
Monklands East, by an ''internal source''.
She said: ''This move would mean a massive reorganisation and big job
losses. I am deeply concerned about what is going to happen to these
jobs.
''I understand that a statement about the merger will be made on
Tuesday as a fait accompli in a directive from Michael Heseltine. If
that is so this is Government by the back door.''
Criticising the way the proposed merger is being handled, she said:
''Trade unions whose members work in the departments appear to have been
told nothing and the move cannot be challenged in Parliament just now
because of the summer recess.''
More than 63,000 people work in the Inland Revenue -- 6000 in Scotland
-- and 9800 people work in the Contributions Agency.
A merger between two of the unions in the departments -- the Inland
Revenue Staff Federation (IRSF) and the National Union of Civil and
Public Servants (NUCPS) to form a 163,000-strong super union -- will
also be announced on Tuesday.
An NUCPS spokesman said: ''The new union is designed to give us more
strength specifically to fight moves such as this.''

Rome
HE CAME to Rome wide-eyed and unknown. Three decades later, Clint
Eastwood is back, an acclaimed director and star of sensitive roles a
far cry from his ''spaghetti western'' days.
Eastwood today collected the Campidoglio film critics' award for
directors, joining the ranks of Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, and
Martin Scorsese.
Speaking to reporters before the ceremony at the Campidoglio piazza,
seat of Rome's government, Eastwood said that when he first came here,
''Italy completely won me over''.
''I was a young, eager hopeful -- Sergio Leone chose me to act in A
Fistful of Dollars and my career took off,'' he said of the director's
famous spaghetti western.
On his recent role co-starring with Meryl Streep in The Bridges of
Madison County, Eastwood said: ''I've changed, and I thought the time
had come to tell the private story of a middle-aged man and woman that
become first friends, then lovers.''
A retrospective of his works runs here next month.--AP.

<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<TEXT>
VETERANS' leaders are to launch a nationwide campaign to return the
two minutes silence on Armistice Day to its traditional time of the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, it was disclosed yesterday.
They will also ask 10,000 local authorities to support the silence by
firing maroons.
There was a time when a hush fell across Britain at 11am on Armistice
Day in an act of remembrance for the dead and injured in wars and
conflicts and in gratitude to those who made the supreme sacrifice.
The original timing of the silence marked the exact time of the end of
the First World War in 1918.
But as the years passed the two minutes silence largely lapsed, apart
from religious services on what is now known as Remembrance Sunday --
the second Sunday of November.
But now the Royal British Legion, spurred on by the millions who
faithfully observed silences during this summer's poignant anniversaries
to mark the end of the Second World War, plans a massive campaign to
resurrect the traditional time for the silence.
The legion's campaign, called Ten Thousand Silences, will next month
focus on local authorities, commercial organisations, and the public
sector, particularly schools.
''We do not think it is too much to ask, in respect of those who have
gone and in gratitude for 50 years of peace, that we should all be given
the opportunity to stop and remember and reflect for two minutes,'' said
Lord Hesketh, a leading legion campaigner.
''We stress in all of this that the maintenance of the two minutes
silence must be entirely voluntary. We simply ask commercial
organisations to stop and give a signal at the beginning and end.''
Lord Hesketh said the VE-Day celebrations in May, when millions of
people, including thousands of fans at football matches, observed the
silence, proved ''that we have the mood of the nation behind us''.
He stressed: ''Tucked away on a Sunday it is at present out of sight
and out of mind for most people.''
When it is brought back this November it will fall on a Saturday. But
five years out of seven it will take place during the working week,
bringing it more effectively to the attention of ordinary people, said
Lord Hesketh.
The legion firmly believes that to maintain peace and freedom the
people of Britain must always remember, in line with mainland Europe,
where Armistice Day remembrance has remained an important part of
national life.
But it is more than just remembrance for the sufferings of the two
world wars -- there have been 70 conflicts since 1945, and only one year
-- 1968 -- when no British serviceman or woman was killed on active
service.
The legion said that what people remembered during the silence was up
to them, although many would want to recall the sacrifices of the world
wars.
A spokesman said: ''But in addition, younger people might want to
offer a prayer of thanks for the fact that neither they nor their
parents have ever been called upon to go to war.
''Or they might want to reflect upon the recent relief from the
oppressive threat of nuclear warfare.''

Nicosia
BRITISH bride Joanna Cook, who collapsed and died half an hour after
her wedding in a Cyprus holiday resort, suffered a brain haemorrhage, a
pathologist said today.
After an hour-long post mortem examination, pathologist Eleni Antoniou
said the haemorrhage was caused by a defect she was born with.
Miss Cook, a 24-year-old sales assistant from Enfield, north London,
died less than an hour after her marriage to printer Kerion Leybourne,
26, also from Enfield. The couple were married at the town hall in
Paphos yesterday.
She collapsed in front of her new husband, relatives, and guests as
they were on their way to a reception at a Paphos hotel.
Doctors made frantic efforts to resucitate her, but she was dead on
arrival at hospital.
Her parents said she had been taking medicines for strong migraines,
police said.
The couple were married in the office of Mayor Andreas Attaliotis in
Paphos town hall.
''They looked so happy, the two of them were very touched,'' he said
today. ''It is very sad, very tragic.''--Reuter.

TWO of three trains which were described by judges as an absurdity are
to remain in service, ScotRail confirmed yesterday.
A spokesman justified their retention on grounds that one has been
popular with commuters and the other will make ''a useful contribution
to drivers' knowledge of routes''.
The trains have covered three stretches of track since May as a device
to circumvent time-consuming, expensive, and potentially embarrassing
line closure procedures.
Before then, the track at Cowlairs junction near Glasgow had been used
only by the Fort William-London sleeper service which was under threat
of withdrawal.
The sleeper was saved this week, with two court actions raised over
the trains by Highland Regional Council playing a crucial role in
winning the reprieve.
The service, now guaranteed for seven years, will continue to use the
three stretches of line, so the need to run the so-called ''ghost
trains'' to avoid a closure process no longer applies.
However, only the 23.58 service between Maryhill and Bishopbriggs,
which Scotland's senior judge Lord Hope, the Lord President, had ruled
was of no conceivable benefit to travellers, is being dropped.
A ScotRail spokesman argued that the 23.48 Cumbernauld to Queen Street
train has been a success with late-night commuters.
However, it will no longer be diverted to cover the sleeper route
which meant it had to reverse into Queen Street, described by three
Appeal judges as a transparently absurd arrangement to avoid closure
procedures.
The 20.05 Inverness to Glasgow train, via Cumbernauld, will continue
to be diverted to the sleeper track, adding six minutes to the normal
journey.
ScotRail cited operational reasons for not returning to the ordinary
route. The diversion will allow more drivers to gain work experience
over the sleeper lines, offering extra cover when regulars are on
holiday or ill.
Drivers have to be trained over routes before being allowed to carry
passengers. If six months have lapsed between runs, training must begin
all over again.

Helsinki
THE Finnish state alcohol monopoly has withdrawn all French wines from
sale after receiving a letter saying five bottles had been contaminated
with cyanide.
''We heard about the scare this morning and we told all our people to
stop selling any French wines right away,'' an Alko spokeswoman said.
''We are taking all the French wines off the shelves.
''We hope very much it is only a joke, of course,'' she added, ''but
we cannot ignore a thing like that.''
It was not immediately clear if the letter linked the poison threat to
the resumption of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific earlier
this month.
Finns have hardly responded to calls to boycott French goods in
protest at France's resumption of nuclear testing.
Local media recently reported that the president's kitchen was still
buying French products.
In further developments, France today barred the Greenpeace vessel
Altair from entering the port of Marseilles, citing an anti-terrorist
plan adopted after a series of bomb attacks in France.
Privately, officials acknowledged they were more concerned about
adverse publicity from the environmental group, which has spearheaded
protests against France's resumption of nuclear tests.
They feared that activists would try to disrupt a visit on Sunday by
Culture Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy.
Meanwhile, hotel owners in Tahiti said today that least 26,000
holidaymakers had cancelled visits since rioters rampaged through the
capital Papeete last week in protest against tests.--Reuter.

AS it celebrates its 40th birthday this week, one is tempted to ask,
''What on earth is happening to ITV?'' And the answer is, well, nothing
much. At least, nothing new. What's on offer is what was on offer last
year. And maybe the year before that. Commercial television would appear
to be stuck in a time warp, trapped by the desire to make easy money at
the expense of new and innovative programmes.
Whatever happened to the spirit which broke the mould and brought you
dramas like Cracker, Prime Suspect, Morse, and even our very own
Taggart? Granted, they're all coming back but, frankly, they've reached
their sell-by date. So where are the new programmes to take their place?
The only hope for the future, it seems, rests with four new pilot
shows which ITV plans to test on the network market later this season
(Strike Force, a drama about an RAF squadron; Papparazzo, about a
celebrity photographer; Bliss, a science-based murder mystery; and
McCallum, a thriller involving a forensic pathologist). None sounds as
if it's out there on the cutting edge.
For the moment at least you cannot help but despair when you look at
the ITV schedules. This week, in particular, is a real bummer with
little worthy of note. Everything is frighteningly familiar -- a few old
drama series, the odd repeat of a feature film, and the return tonight
of two of the most appalling programmes ever created (Gladiators and
Blind Date). Indeed, the only thing really worth mentioning is a new
one-off Mr Bean (Wednesday) with Rowan Atkinson making his last-but-one
appearance as the silent, bumbling twit. So a half-hour comedy show is
the ITV highlight of the week? Sadly, yes.
It is time ITV took a tumble to itself and started making new
programmes once again. And if it doesn't then it should at least have
the decency to admit defeat and do what it used to do -- import good,
quality drama from the States.
* THAT SAID, it is perhaps a bit rich to draw your attention to a BBC
show which is returning this week for its 10th season. But Casualty
(BBC1, Saturday) is just television's way of telling you that the nights
are fair drawing in. It is as familiar and dependable as an old
raincoat. There is little more to be said. Or so you think until you
pick up the press release from the Beeb's ever-resourceful publicity
department.
In a bid to drum up something new to say about its most popular drama
series, it has drawn up a list of the 10 things you didn't know about
Casualty. Most of them are boring (did you know, by the way, that they
were originally going to call it Frontline?) but a couple are worth
mentioning in a yukky, grotesque, kind of a way.
Patients' vomit, for instance, is made from a mixture of Weetabix and
chicken soup. Except if you are a vegetarian actor, of course. In which
case they provide vegetable soup for you to throw up. ''Diced carrots? I
don't remember eating diced carrots?''
Crushed limbs, incidently, are usually made from a mixture of gelatine
and beef bones. The blood is a melange of warm water, glycerine, and
red-and-green food colouring. I just thought you ought to know this. It
may provide a healthy new insight into the BBC's most durable drama
series.
Call it old, call it tired, call it formulaic, but Casualty 10 years
on is as fit as the proverbial butcher's dog. Its pulse is sounder than
Medics, its blood pressure better than Chicago Hope, and its reflexes
every bit as sharp as Cardiac Arrest. In fact, only ER is in better
shape than this patient.
Mind you, I have never really understood the viewing public's eternal
fascination with medical drama. I suspect it has something to do with a
vicarious pleasure we get from watching people in pain.
You always know that, when the doctor grabs those resuss paddles,
plonks them on the patient's chest, and shouts ''Stand back, please!''
then the poor sucker on the emergency table is going to cop it. No
amount of electric-powered jump starts are going to bring that
once-heaving chest back to life. Next stop is the mortuary slab with a
tag on the toe. Predictable? You bet.
So why then is Casualty so damned successful? Maybe part of the reason
is the fact that it is not flashy. It is quite matter-of-fact (to the
point of being unglamorous) in its approach. And it steers well clear of
soap-opera territory. The doctors are no Kildares and the nurses no
Florence Nightingales. The only certainty is that Charlie Fairhead
(Derek Thompson) will continue to be miserable as he carries the weight
of Holby General's world upon his shoulders.
Love interest? Well, a bit, but what there is has been dealt with
beyond the hospital corridors. It's as if the sex thing has been
surgically removed off screen. It sticks to a well-established format.
You get two or maybe three domestic scenes and you have to work out
which character from each scene will end up in the casualty unit. It's a
dramatic ''guess who''.
Traditionally, Casualty always splashes out on its production budget
for its first (and last) episodes. This week's opener is no exception. A
dodgy corner-cutting builder erects a temporary grandstand at the local
athletics field. Naturally it collapses and Holby General goes on
emergency alert. Somebody's bound to die. So who will get the paddle
treatment? Will it be the ice-cream salesman's chubby fresh-faced son or
the teenage athlete trapped by the legs under the wreckage?
Meanwhile Charlie continues to have the hots for his old flame, Dr Baz
Hayes (Julia Watson) while consultant Mike Barrett (Clive Mantle), who
has finally split from his wife, is getting the silent treatment from
Nurse Rachel Longworth (Jane Gurnett).
* Go Now (BBC2, Saturday) is the first in a short season of
made-for-TV movies with the common thread of love. Produced by the same
team which made Roddy Doyle's acclaimed four-part drama Family last year
and starring our own Bobby Carlyle (Hamish MacBeth), it's a razor-sharp
contemporary love story designed to make you laugh and cry --
occasionally at the same time.
Carlyle plays Nick, a plasterer by trade, who cares about two things
in life -- his mates and playing football. Then he falls in love with
Karen (Juliet Aubrey). Everything is going swimmingly until Nick starts
to have clumsy accidents at work. His football skills desert him and
he's dropped from the local team. The couple's relationship becomes
sorely tested when Nick is diagnosed as suffering from Multiple
Sclerosis.
Go Now, which was written by Jimmy McGovern (Cracker) and Paul Powell,
tackles the disease head-on. Powell, who suffers from MS, brings a
crushing reality to this, his first television script. He is clearly
writing from the heart of his own experiences and brings an honesty and
an integrity to the drama.
Director Michael Winterbottom has made a highly original film which is
distinctive in its approach. He avoids the heavy social realism and goes
instead for a story which is essentially a series of snapshots from a
difficult relationship, interspersed with still sequences and captions
to indicate the passing of time. It's different but it works incredibly
well.
* FORMER flavour-of-the-month Jonathan Ross, of whom it has been said:
''Is there no beginning to this man's talents?'' continues his quest for
a television career with Mondo Rosso (BBC2, Friday), a six-part look at
the worst B-movies ever made. Bad sets, bad acting, bad scripts, and bad
special effects . . . and then there are the film clips. In the coming
weeks the series will highlight the low points of cinematic history,
from the cringingly embarrassing sci-fi movies of the 50s to the
mind-bendingly perverse drug movies of the 80s.
This week Jonathan, together with studio guests Eddie Izzard and
Ingrid Pitt (scream queen star of such deranged celluloid products as
Vampire Lovers and Countess Dracula), looks at trash horror. Ross says:
''It would take a madman, a fool, or a complete genius to dare to show
this stuff on television.'' Well, two out of three ain't bad.
* FINALLY this week, a sore point. Every year in Britain 10,000 boys,
mostly infants, have ritual circumcision inflicted upon them. It can be
carried out by anyone, anywhere, and by any method. Usually, it is
carried out without anaesthetic.
In War Cries: It's A Boy! (C4, Thursday) Jewish journalist and
filmmaker (and concerned parent) Victor S Schonfield investigates this
painful procedure and questions its validity. Is it really a necessary
part of the spiritual and cultural identity of Moslem and Jewish people?
Or is it an unnecessary and brutal mutilation which scars a child for
life?
For the first time ever a mohal (a jewish circumciser), Midlands Rabbi
David Singer, agreed to allow the filming of the operation on Joshua, an
eight-day-old child. The documentary takes a harrowing turn when the
baby's (non-Jewish) father summons Schonfield back to Birmingham. Joshua
is in intensive care as a result of the circumcision; his father is
beside himself with grief and rage at the ''immoral and arrogant''
action which has endangered the child's life. Cutting edge or what?
Uncomfortable but compulsive viewing.

THERE has been a febrile political atmosphere since the country left
the ERM abruptly three years ago; but there has been a clear shift of
gear in the past week. The run-up to the next election has begun,
although there are still probably 18 months to go. Mr Blair has been
running fast since his own election as Labour leader: he obviously has
felt that he had to transform Labour publicly to gain the advantage that
its claim to be ''new'' would confer. It has been a good run, but it has
faltered a little of late with a leaked internal document spelling out
some worries prevalent among his advisers this spring, the political
indiscretions of a leading Welsh Labour MP, and the resignation of Kevin
Macnamara, an admittedly relatively obscure front bench spokesman.
Curiously, none of this seems to have done Mr Blair's public standing
any harm. The Tories did make some recovery in the opinion polls
following Mr Major's own electoral success against Mr Redwood, but the
improvement was soon eroded; Labour still enjoys a formidable lead in
declared public support.
Mr Blair's performance at the TUC may have enhanced his wider appeal:
voters respect leaders who can be firm with their own supporters, and
the fact is that the unions have nowhere else to turn (though their
members are quite another matter). For its part the Government now knows
that it will be able to deliver tax reductions in the Budget; and it may
not have to cut public spending to any significant degree to do so, for
the economy has been growing. The struggle with inflation goes on, but
many economic observers believe there is every chance that interest
rates will be able to fall without risking a sudden inflationary surge.
The great unknown in all this is: how important are financial
considerations going to be in determining political sentiment? The
Tories have enjoyed no benefit from presiding over the near-conquest of
inflation; indeed, some of the consequences in low nominal rates of
return on savings, and low wage awards, may have worked against them.
That could be because many voters are well aware that recent economic
success stems from the failure of our ERM membership rather than the
Government's own intentions. The Government has not recovered from the
devastating blow to its financial competence which was delivered so soon
after its last electoral success. The effects of that blow were felt in
higher personal taxation, and lower benefits for home owners at the very
point the housing market turned sour. It will be hard for the
Government's fortunes to recover fully.
It would, however, be reasonable to suppose that they are bound to
recover somewhat. A Tory wipe-out in the UK along the lines suffered by
the Canadian Conservatives at their last general election seems
improbable. The size of the swing Labour needs for victory is very
large, and even if Tory hopes from boundary redistribution are less than
they were, they are likely to be net beneficiaries. What all this
implies is a hard-fought 18 months, and a much closer eventual outcome
than the present opinion poll figures would suggest. For Labour both the
Liberal and Nationalist performances could be exceptionally important,
since the bloc of Scottish seats is so vital to its overall total. For
the Tories, the Liberals may prove to be decisive in determining the
outcome in their comparable stronghold in southern England. All these
matters will be debated nearer the time; before that the coming Budget
is assuming an unusual political significance -- a significance out of
all proportion to its importance to the conduct of economic affairs.

<TEXT>
CUSTOMS officials were yesterday looking for clues on board an
abandoned yacht found drifting with drugs worth around #3.5m.
The 41ft Carla II, which was at Brixham quayside, south Devon, was
discovered two and a half miles off Berry Head.
The red-hulled, Italian registered craft had about a tonne of cannabis
resin on board, probably from Morocco, packed into dozens of boxes.
She was found by a Brixham trawler, the Marilyn Jayne, and the crew
uncovered a Marie Celeste-style mystery.
The trawlermen found a pair of shoes on the yacht's deck along with
coffee cups and the remains of a meal in the cockpit, as if she was
abandoned quickly. They also found maps and charts.
One theory is that a drugs transfer between Carla II and another
vessel may have been abandoned because the trawler was in the area.
Customs officers are seeking a link between the yacht and a motor
cruiser seen speeding from the area at about the same time.
''We are hopeful of making arrests based on evidence which will come
to light, such as fingerprints and who hired the craft,'' said a Customs
spokesman.
After climbing aboard to investigate, the trawler crew lashed the
yacht to their 110ft vessel and brought her into port.
Customs said they were ''very grateful'' to them for bringing the
yacht into Brixham where several feet of water were pumped out of her.
Officials were yesterday examining road maps of Switzerland, Italy,
Spain and France, and a navigation chart to Gibraltar found on board.

THE Government and Labour both struggled to contain political damage
yesterday, the Government by denying a rift between Education Secretary
Gillian Shephard and the Prime Minister over a leaked briefing paper;
Labour by ignoring outspoken criticism of its Ulster policy from a
former front bencher.
Mrs Shephard refused to deny a warning, contained in the briefing
paper, that state schools in England and Wales were dangerously
under-funded, prompting Labour claims that she is at odds with Mr Major.
On Thursday, a day-long Cabinet meeting called to discuss Tory
pre-election strategy was overshadowed by the leak of what was claimed
to be a document prepared for Mrs Shephard which suggested the
Government was at risk over its education policy.
Mrs Shephard promised an inquiry into the leak, and dismissed the
suggestion of a split with Mr Major. She is one of the Prime Minister's
closest political supporters.
''It is inconceivable that on a matter like education, where he and I
start from the same position, there could be any division of view,'' she
said.
But Labour claimed the document proved she was unhappy with her
spending allocation, and speculation suggests the leak might have been
an attempt to obtain more resources.
Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she refused to deny the
main thrust of the document, that schools were suffering from
under-funding. Instead, she said only that, while more money had been
made available this year, the effects across the country had been
''patchy''.
Meanwhile, Hull North MP Kevin McNamara followed up his resignation as
a Labour front bencher with a stinging criticism of the Northern Ireland
policy adopted by Mr Blair.
He accused Mr Blair of ''slavishly'' following the Government line.
''He has done it uncritically, directly and in a manner which I don't
think is to the benefit of the peace process in Northern Ireland or the
British Labour Party,'' he said.
Mr McNamara, an acknowledged pro-nationalist who served for seven
years as Northern Ireland spokesman, resigned as Shadow Civil Service
Minister on Thursday night, citing disappointment over Labour's Ulster
and trade union policies.
In his letter of resignation, Mr McNamara criticised Mr Blair for
supporting the Government's demand that the IRA must hand over weapons
before Sinn Fein can be allowed to join all-party talks.
Mr Blair replied by reaffirming his support for the Downing Street
declaration which would give the people of Ulster the right to decide
their future. ''I believe that the bi-partisan approach is the best way
to peace and that to disturb it, particularly now, would be
irresponsible and wrong,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Women's rights are human rights, says action plan of UN conference</HEADLINE>

Beijing
THE world women's conference approved a hotly disputed blueprint
today, setting forth a plan of battle for sexual equality into the
twenty-first century that enshrined women's rights as human rights but
avoided commitments to pay for action.
The UN Fourth World Women's Conference passed its Platform for Action
and Beijing Declaration after a cliffhanging finale that pitted an
informal bloc of the Vatican and conservative Islamists against Europe
and South Africa in 11th-hour wrangling until dawn over the fine print.
''We now need a tidal change,'' Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland told the closing ceremony. ''Women will no longer accept the
role of second-rate citizens.''
An overnight compromise enabled proponents and opponents of new sexual
rights to claim victory at the world's biggest gathering of women,
launched on August 30 with a spirited grassroots forum.
More than 30,000 women converged on a tent city erected in a Beijing
suburb where they met and talked, danced, wept, and demonstrated for 10
days to lobby for their rights in the Platform for Action -- despite
rain, heavy-handed Chinese police surveillance, and host-country curbs
on free speech.
The event, held once in 10 years, concluded with the more solemn
United Nations conference and its milestone declaration.
''Women's rights are human rights,'' the declaration said.
The platform says women should not be punished for abortions in
countries where it is illegal, offers protection against rape and war
crimes, calls for a more powerful role in politics, recognises unpaid
labour, and goes into battle against poverty.
''I believe firmly that if we all do our little bit, no matter how
small it is, we shall succeed in making even the impossible, possible,''
Secretary General Gertrude Mongella concluded.
''As our Chinese hosts say, the journey of 1000 miles begins with one
step.''
However, some delegates swiftly voiced doubts about the power of a
platform for action that urges governments to act but does not bind them
to do anything.
The Vatican launched a stinging attack on the refusal of developed
countries to open their purses to fund specific goals of the platform.
''Surely we must do more for the girl child in poor nations than give
lip service to providing access to education, health, and social
services, while carefully avoiding any concrete commitment of new and
additional resources to that end,'' said Mary Ann Glendon, first woman
leader of a delegation from the Holy See.
The declaration, seen as a clarion call for women to fight for their
rights in the next decade, demands empowerment of women, equality, and
the end of all violence against women, but does not say how all this
will be achieved.
Deep divisions that marked the 12-day conference persisted to the end,
with 41 of 189 delegate nations adding reservations to the document --
most on a single health paragraph that gives women greater freedoms to
choose abortion and contraception.
The Papal nuncio vented fury over ambiguity of the language, warning
against wording on sexual rights that could be interpreted to endorse
abortion and homosexuality.
After all reservations had been voiced, Chinese president of the
conference, Chen Muhua, slammed her gavel on the decennial document to
approve the cocktail of compromise and promise.
Delegates celebrated passage of the platform with hugs and applause
and cheers.
In a final blow to the hosts, Brundtland did not hesitate to embarrass
China, criticising ''zealous security'' along with police harassment and
lack of visas for many women who wanted to attend the UN conference and
the grassroots forum.--Reuter.

NEGOTIATIONS between Britain and Argentina are close to agreeing a
common strategy to explore the continental shelf between the Falkland
Islands and the Patagonian mainland. The target is hydro-carbons --
mainly oil. The existence of a vast new oil province similar in size and
type to that of the North Sea has long been suspected by expert
geologists working for the international oil companies; and there may
even be additional deep-water deposits to the east of the islands in the
direction of New Georgia. There certainly are likely to be all sorts of
mineral in the British Antarctic territories nearby, though these will
only be explored -- and later developed -- by a much wider, and entirely
separate, international agreement.
The Falkands waters will not be explored systematically, let alone
developed, if the two countries with competing claims to sovereignty of
the Falklands insist on their rights. What they are moving towards is a
strategy which puts this debate into suspense, though there may yet be
problems when it comes to dividing the rewards. The competing claims are
a matter of history, although British possession of the Falklands
actually antedates the creation of the Argentinian republic itself.
The Argentinian invasion during the first Thatcher administration led
to their armed forces being ejected by a major British amphibious
expedition which proved to be highly successful, but very costly in both
life and money. The memory of that event makes it difficult for either
country's public opinion to abandon its commitment, but it seems that a
way is being found to ignore what is a theoretical debate in favour of
practical, positive activity. This makes obvious sense economically.
Even though it will take some years before the oil starts to flow that
is no great problem, since today's low prices might have improved to
provide enhanced justification for the new investment. Much depends on
the quality of the oil actually found, and on the depth of the
surrounding waters, which are shallow to the west of the Falklands but
deep towards South Georgia.
Any successful agreement in the South Atlantic could provide the model
for other areas of offshore exploration where the search for minerals is
impeded by competing sovereign claims. The Aegean waters between Greece
and Turkey are, for example, thought to contain significant oil
deposits. Their geography is complicated by the way in which the Greek
islands hug the Turkish coast, making it difficult to insist on
hard-and-fast judgments about rights to the seabed and any treasures it
may overlie. That, and the bitter animosity between Greeks and Turks,
has effectively prevented the economic exploitation of potential
resources which both countries would benefit from greatly, as would the
European Union, of which Greece is a member and Turkey hopes to be.
By ignoring questions of sovereignty which threaten violence (in both
these cases) the participants ensure political stability, the one thing
international oil companies require to justify their expenditure of the
millions of dollars even a single exploratory drilling costs. These
immense costs (and exploratory wells are only the beginning) are met by
the international oil companies only because they can be sure of a high
rate of return, even after big tax takes by the governments involved.
Restricted political agreement delivers the situation required by the
companies without jeopardising long-term rights. More permanent
political accord could settle all the outstanding questions, but even
raising the thorny question of relations between the states shows why
the suspension of competing claims is such sound common sense.

THE SKY above RAF Leuchars in Fife was strictly for the birds
yesterday. But that will change today when the base hosts the service's
only remaining Battle of Britain show.
Sixty thousand spectators are expected to flock to Leuchars for the
spectacle, the only military air show for enthusiasts in Scotland and
the North of England.
Fliers representing eight air forces from foreign skies -- Americans,
Italians, French, Belgians, Danes, Norwegians, Dutch and Germans -- will
join with the RAF, the Royal Navy and the Army to provide the thrills.
The several display teams taking part this year will include the
Battle of Britain Memorial Flight -- comprised of a Hurricane, a
Spitfire and a Lancaster -- which earlier this year staged a VE Day
celebration flypast over Buckingham Palace.
The world-famous Red Arrows, the French Air Force equivalent the
Patrouille de France, the RAF Falcons parachute team and the Army's Blue
Eagles helicopter display team will also go through their paces.
The civilian contribution to the seven-hour flying display will
include the zany Cadbury Crunchie Flying Circus and the new Rover Group
aerobatic team, performing at Leuchars for the first time.
The military aircraft taking part will include the Hercules C-130.

I SUGGEST that Councillor Danny Meikle's comments, which gave rise to
your headline, Windfarm approval may prove windfall (September 9), are a
little premature and do not reflect the views of the majority of people
in the Douglas valley, Lanarkshire.
He says that there is hardly any noise from the site. Of course there
isn't. Only six windmills have been built so far and the sails haven't
started turning. My own experience of a similar site is that these
windmills do create noise and a colleague who lives near to a site in
Yorkshire will confirm that fact.
The creation of a further 20 jobs in this area is to be welcomed but
these are only temporary. How many permanent jobs will be created as a
direct result of the windfarm?
The site may indeed prove to be a tourist attraction but there is
little evidence of that so far. But what will visitors see when they
visit our villages? Litter, broken pavements, and holes in the roads.
This is hardly the level of infrastructure required to attract
investment through tourism.
Rather than waste money on viewing platforms let us spend it on
projects that will benefit the people who live here and encourage more
visitors.
Take a walk by the pond in Douglas at sunset and look west. The
skyline could be straight out of an H G Wells novel. The wonderful view
up towards Hagshaw Hill has gone forever. Is that environmentally
friendly?

AS one who has sailed Loch Lomond for over 20 years and has just spent
a perfect season on the loch I totally failed to witness the chaos or
wave of acrimony described by James Freeman in what I consider to be an
ill-informed article (September 11).
I am neither a speed-boater nor a jet-skier but I cannot understand
the apparent persecution of this group, which can only be encouraged by
misleading articles.
In my own experience some of the most malicious and dangerous
behaviour on the loch has been perpetuated by the angling fraternity.
It would appear to me that James Freeman has his waders firmly planted
in the angling camp. Perhaps the solution lies in a total ban on
angling.

THANK you for the beautiful supplement, Autumn Scotland (September
12).
It is a bitter irony that on the same day we should receive
notification of Glasgow City Council's planning application for a
landfill site 300 yards from our home.
The proposed site will swallow up 144 hectares of countryside between
East Kilbride and Glasgow, destroying the amenity for its wide range of
users.
Is it too much to ask that this unspoilt part of Scotland be protected
this autumn and in the future?

FURTHER to your report, Loch Lomond seeks tourism strategy (September
13), while we are awaiting further developments regarding Drumkinnon Bay
perhaps readers would be interested to know of another development on
the east side of the river by Moss O'Balloch where the park authority
wishes to put a road for cars where the existing riverside walk has
always been.
This will mean uprooting mature trees and plants and disturbance to
the 40 or so swans as well as other wildfowl. A footbridge is then to be
constructed to enable walkers to bypass this road.
Whilst I and other residents are not objecting to improvements to the
slipway itself, we feel that the footbridge will be unsightly as well as
leading to problems of congestion, cyclists, vandalism etc. We have
heard of no-one who is in favour of the bridge.
We have suggested several alternative ideas which would be more
environmentally acceptable and also infinitely cheaper.
We understand the planning meeting is to be held on September 19 and
eagerly await the decision.
Incidentally, we feel that the new bridge suggested across the bottom
of the loch into the country park will be equally unsightly and no doubt
sailing-boat owners on the river will be worried about height problems.
Surely people will picnic, etc, on one side of the river or the other.

WHEN Jeremy Brett first appeared in the role of Sherlock Holmes, he
brought fresh and invigorating qualities to the role. There was a slight
air of raffishness, maybe even a touch of camp about his
characterisation but it rang bells with the millions of Holmes
aficionados around the country. Here at last was a Holmes not only with
style, but with soul.
Jeremy Brett put it thus: ''The trouble is (Sir Arthur Conan) Doyle
gave him brains galore and only the sensibility of an eight-year-old.
Children can take Sherlock at face value and understand him. But what
really makes him tick is as much a problem for adult audiences to
understand as it has for me playing him.''
The part of Holmes has attracted many fine actors. I have always had a
soft spot for the Basil Rathbone version. The aquiline profile and the
dashing way that Rathbone had with the part became a standard, surpassed
only by Brett.
Although he made 42 films as Holmes, I always felt there was more to
come and that, like Holmes himself, he would go on and on, making the
part uniquely his in the way that Joan Hickson became the incarnation of
Miss Marple. Even the finite supply of Holmes stories would not be a
problem. Several authors have managed a credible job with Conan Doyle's
blueprint and in Billy Wilder's case a brilliant fictitious film, The
Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, which combined wit with pseudo-Conan
Doyle scenarios.
Now there is no more to come. Jeremy Brett died of heart disease at
his home on Tuesday aged 59. More deadly than falling over the
Reichenbach Falls (from which he returned), or Colonel Moran's bullet
(which hit the dummy silhouetted in the window of his Baker Street home)
or any deadly scheme that the evil Professor Moriarty could devise, was
that common enemy of so many mortals -- a heart attack. Death when it
came, was soft, at the end of a decade of health difficulties.
There was a mental breakdown after the death of his wife Joanie in
1986, followed by the onset of manic depression, and heart problems were
diagnosed last year. Through it all the Sherlock show went on. Last
Sunday listeners to the radio in Scotland heard him appeal on behalf of
the Manic Depression Society.
The intensity and sincerity of the plea was evident, as was the
sensitivity of the way that he described the problems of those whose
level of reality swings from mountain top highs to the depths of
personal hell. Prior to that broadcast, I was an admirer of Jeremy Brett
the actor. Moved by it, I became an admirer of Jeremy Brett the man.
Was that the secret of insight which Brett had brought to his
characterisation of Sherlock Holmes? Was it manic depression that caused
Holmes' periods of torpor and his firece bursts of energy in pursuit of
a case?
It is an interesting thought, but the secret of how Brett managed to
give Holmes more soul than any previous is less interesting to me than
how he managed to discharge his professional duties while suffering from
the condition known as manic depression. Here is a secret which deserves
to be shared -- and the Manic Depression Society exists to do so.
Actors are, in my view, a much undervalued profession. Of course there
are some who are overvalued -- the overpaid and overweight Marlon Brando
comes to mind. But they are as exceptional as the Jackie Collins
''earnalikes'' in the world of writing fiction.
Most actors are insecure in employment if not also in self-confidence,
they are hard-working by necessity when they get work (who re-employs
actors who are late for calls?), and subject to working conditions which
would have most manual workers complaining to the health and safety
types. Moreover, their work is subject to a lot more criticism than most
people's efforts and it is not always constructive or kind.
The actor (I use the unisex term employed by many actresses) is
supposed to subscribe to the ''show-must-go-on'' principle. It means
that they are required to perform whether or not their back is aching or
their heart is breaking. The fact that so many actors give pleasure to
so many while enduring personal problems is a tribute to their
professionalism.
There are probably more temptations or pressures in their life than in
most people's and it should be no surprise that there are many who
succumb (paying the extra price of public exposure if they are a big
enough name to warrant a headline). Actors are in general nice people
and they enhance our lives rather than detract from them.
So thank you, Jeremy and all like you. You have gone to the place from
which there is no curtain call but with many others I shall enjoy the
repeats and the pleasure of enjoying the company of your incomparable
Holmes.
A last thought that the preacher in me cannot resist, and what are
preachers but not actors with a regular job? It is that we are all in
some respects like actors. We must go about and do our business, face to
the world although our souls are in despair. We have the brains to do
it, but so often the eight-year-old within us comes out as the persona
we present to the world. Putting our brains and our childlike character
together is what Jesus taught his listeners, and brings out the best in
us whether we are playing Sherlock Holmes or simply ourselves.

I HAVE just read Ian Bell's article, Vatican strike force defends the
demented blueprint (September 14).
Earlier this year I attended the preparatory meeting in New York for
the United Nations Women's Conference. Several colleagues in Beijing
have kept me informed of progress at this meeting.
It is not just the Vatican and Muslim countries who oppose the immoral
agenda of the West but also many Third World nations. I have personally
spoken to many of the representatives from this latter group who are
appalled at what the European Union wants to force on them.
Ian Bell claims that appeals to ancient contradictory texts are used
by those who oppose the export of immorality. I guess he is referring to
the Ten Commandments. When his moral framework has stood 3500 years of
attack and still been followed by countless millions, then perhaps I
would grant him a little credibility.
The Book referred to by Ian Bell is, I believe, the Bible. Yes, it is
still the world's bestseller, at 30 million per year. In the 1780s
Voltaire said that within 100 years no-one would read the Bible.
Well, 100 years after Voltaire died his house in Geneva was purchased
by the Geneva Bible Society and used as a base for international Bible
distribution. Will anyone read Ian Bell's article in 100 years?
''Just because the Book says so'' is a very good reason for doing it.
The sexual revolution of the last 30 years has brought a lot of
short-lived instant gratification and much misery.
Ian Bell appears to ridicule chastity and the concept of keeping
oneself sexually pure. The Book says that sex is for marriage, where
marriage is defined as the life long union of a man and woman. If this
simple advice were followed there would be little call for abortion,
little spread of VD or Aids, less infertility, and many more people at
peace with each other.

<HEADLINE>UN resumes aid flights into Sarajevo. Airlift ends forced five-month break.</HEADLINE>

Geneva
THE international airlift to Sarajevo is to resume tomorrow after a
five-month halt.
A UN trial flight, carrying a symbolic three tonnes of wheat flour and
French Defence Minister Charles Millon, touched down safely in the
Bosnian capital this afternoon.
Military officials from the five states contributing planes --
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States -- then
conferred by telephone and agreed to resume the lifeline with eight
scheduled flights, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR).
The first flight, an American cargo plane, will take off from Ancona
airbase in Italy at 9.50am, said spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume.
British, French, and US planes will be taking part in the airlift
initially.
The UNHCR, the main relief agency operating in former Yugoslavia, also
welcomed yesterday's accord to lift the siege of the Bosnian capital and
make access easier for aid convoys taking food and medical supplies to
the city of 400,000 people.
The first convoys to arrive in Sarajevo since the operation was
suspended at the end of last month entered the city under armed UN
escort today.
''They both got through without a hitch, according to our preliminary
report,'' said a spokeswoman.
The Geneva-based UNHCR co-ordinates the airlift, begun on July 3,
1992, but grounded since April 8 when Bosnian Serbs refused to give
security assurances to governments that provide the planes.
''It has been the longest interruption in the history of the
airlift,'' said Berthiaume.
Averaging about 15 flights a day for a total of 12,320 over three
years, the lifeline has delivered 153,412 tonnes of aid to Sarajevo.
Some 20 countries have taken part.
In October 1993 it surpassed the length of the Western airlift that
enabled Berlin to survive a long Soviet blockade early in the Cold War.
''The food situation is not good but it is not desperate. It is
important to resume normal distribution of supplies,'' Berthiaume said.
Under the agreement reached yesterday, Bosnian Serb forces agreed to
withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo as Nato suspends its bombing
campaign for 72 hours.
Aid convoys are to be allowed to travel to Sarajevo on two roads
through Serb territory that had previously been closed.
Berthiaume said that yesterday's accord represented an important
development. ''Bringing in goods by roads is much better, less costly
and more efficient,'' she said.
''From now on, we are meant to have free access to all roads to
Sarajevo -- free access with no checkpoints.''
However, even if the Bosnian Serbs pull out all the heavy weapons they
have promised to move, Sarajevo will still be ringed by big guns
previously judged to be a severe threat to the city.
Britain's UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Rupert Smith, is
said to be far from happy about this.
The deal reached on Thursday allows mortars of 82mm or smaller,
artillery of 100mm or smaller, and all anti-aircraft guns to stay inside
the 12[1/2]-mile exclusion zone around the city.
UN sources said that General Smith sent a letter to Bosnian Serb Army
commander General Ratko Mladic today asking him to remove all mortars
and artillery of 76mm or larger and all anti- aircraft guns of 20mm or
larger.
Meanwhile, five UN agencies have made a joint appeal for fresh funds
to help 280,000 newly displaced persons in former Yugoslavia, mainly
Serb refugees driven by Croat forces from the rebel Krajina region.
The agencies are seeking an extra #30m to provide food and shelter for
''the largest single movement of refugees'' since the war broke out.
Relief workers say about 90,000 Serbs have been forced to flee their
homes across Bosnia as their soldiers retreat before a huge Muslim and
Croat offensive.--Reuter.

IT was encouraging to read of the green plan being launched by Dundee
District Council to help hedgehogs as well as other wild creatures
(September 6).
Gardeners who pile autumn leaves and garden debris into heaps for
burning should check very carefully to make sure that a hedgehog has not
chosen the heap to use as a nest. The ideal solution is to build a
bonfire just before lighting it.
We heard several stories last year of people who made a last-minute
check and found a grumpy hedgehog curled up among the rubbish. They were
very relieved not to be responsible for the little creature's death.

IS it not time that we had the TV weather forecasters give equal

''league'' table of how accurate the forecasts have been for each
county? Is there any excuse for excluding Shetland from the screen but
constantly featuring the Cherbourg peninsula?
Could we also not have the map with the North to the bottom and South

MATTHEW SMITH'S letter was excellent and so true (September 13). The
opinion polls on the subject of devolution/parliament should be ignored
because people do not know what they are voting for.
In many respects, I believe what people are saying is, ''Please bring
more decision-making back to a local level''. That to me, means not a
new body but using existing bodies.
The obvious way forward in the future is to use the new unitary
authorities as the avenue to obtain greater responsibility and, more
importantly, local accountability by allowing them a say in new areas
with a direct ability through, say, the council leaders to contribute to
debates on Scottish relevant legislation issues through the Scottish
Grand Committee, which is already active.
After all, people are more likely to know their local councillor
rather than their MP unless the MP is in a high-profile position.
In allowing this change I would further suggest that paying
councillors a reasonable salary means they can then devote more time to
local matters. Perhaps then they can take on board positions in the
quangos, thus increasing further the local accountability.
The additional benefit to introducing salaries for councillors is that
people who have a wish to serve their local community as councillors,
and have not previously been able to do so for affordability reasons,
would then be able to do so.
I am proud of being Scottish. I am also proud of being part of the
United Kingdom enjoying all the advantages that brings, be it as a
strong meaningful foice in the EC or through the United Nations and
other areas where the United Kingdom is an important body.

TOM FULTON'S letter on decentralisation (September 9) exposes the
Government's hypocrisy in advocating subsidiarity for Europe -- ie,
devolving power to member states -- and decentralisation for local
authorities -- ie, devolving power to the community -- while
consistently refusing to consider any shift of power from Westminster to
a Scottish assembly.
Democracy in the UK is far from perfect with a non-elected Upper House
and a Parliament that operates with regulations that manifestly fail to
deter corrupt practices -- a position which would not be tolerated in
local government.
If democracy is to be raised in the public's esteem, it will have to
be changed to comply with the stated wishes of the Scottish people.
Tom Fulton, a resident in East Ayrshire, should not be apprehensive
about the decentralisation plans of the new council which will devolve
optimum power of managerial and democractic decision-making on local
matters to a local level.
Local committees will supplement the work of six traditional service
committees and will convene local forums on a regular basis to ensure as
far as possible that the council's agenda reflects the aspirations and
concerns of the people of East Ayrshire.
That is what we in East Ayrshire understand democracy to be about.

I HAVE to take issue with Bernard Tomlinson's reference to the
''Gaelic name'' of the ''Aberdeenshire'' Dee or Deva (September 4)
Admittedly for most of its course the Dee is in Aberdeenshire but it
also passes through the northern part of Kincardineshire and thereafter
forms the Aberdeenshire-Kincardineshire boundary before reaching the
city of Aberdeen and the North Sea.
And, although Kincardine and Deeside district will become part of the
new (Greater) Aberdeenshire next year, the name Kincardine(shire) will
survive as a postal address, within the name of a presbytery and perhaps
even as a lord lieutenancy.
Further, the name Dee (or Deva) was recorded as ''Diva'' as early as
146 AD -- that is, over 300 years before the Gaels arrived in Scotland
and there is no evidence whatsoever of a Gaelic-speaking settlement on
Deeside until probably after circa 850 AD.
Indeed all the major river-names in Scotland are pre-Gaelic, with many
also being probably pre-Celtic.
If it is necessary to attribute the naming of the Dee to any specific
Celtic-speaking people, one can only suggest the Celtic-speaking Picts.

Sue Innes reflects on the positive response to her book which gives
solutions for both sexes in today's career-dominated society.
IT was when the woman from London local radio told me for the fourth
time how much she liked my book, and how surprised she was that she
liked it, that I began to understand. She was almost bouncing with
enthusiasm (which was nice), but what she really wanted me to know was
that it wasn't what she'd expected at all.
When she'd been asked to do the interview and told it was a book by a
Scottish feminist, she said her heart sank; it would be heavy going,
hard work, not a lot of fun . . . because feminist means dull and behind
the times; add Scottish and in the London mind it means even more dull
and even more behind the times. Several other people who interviewed me
in a rather bewildering round of local radio stations said much the same
thing, only less explicitly.
There is a formula to radio interviews done ''down the line''. The
interview over, the presenter cues the music and then has a quick
private word with you, thanking you for coming on the programme,
something polite probably, 'bye . . . This time quite a few interviewers
were more than polite, saying they'd skim-read the book for purposes of
work but then either that they'd taken it home to read properly, or were
intending to.
Several said how relevant it was to issues they were facing in their
own lives. One woman -- a skilled presenter and interviewer -- told me
her short-term contract was up in two weeks and what then? The specific
impact of a growing ''contract culture'' for women is one of the things
I write about. Another told me she'd had a major gynae operation three
weeks ago but was back at work because she's a freelance so has no sick
pay or security; another said she and her partner wanted to have
children but couldn't see how to create the kind of work-home balance
which didn't depend on him being the main breadwinner, her work
secondary -- one of my main themes.
A male interviewer talked wearily about the long hours and how he
hardly saw his partner.
Feminism is seen as not very relevant anymore and unreadable with it,
my publisher said: ''Your book isn't -- but how do we get people who
think that to read it in the first place?'' Sadly (or perhaps not) I am
beyond an age to be packaged as ''babe feminism''. And, he said: ''Some
journalists are saying to us you just ask more questions, don't have
answers. They like the Americans because they come up with answers.''
There are no easy answers and no single formula. My book is full of
answers. Most of them the same sort of answers many women and some men
have been suggesting for most of the century. Proper career breaks and
properly paid and protected part-time work; good, affordable childcare;
better provision for the elderly; a minimum wage; equal pay . . . though
I also ask the next question: why don't we do these things?
Tensions between work and the family are still at the centre of most
women's lives. Women are in the workplace and public life in a way we
never before recognised as existing. Opportunity, a degree of
independence, and agency is now taken for granted by most women -- yet
there are continuing barriers against women's progress at work and in
decision-making roles; and support for family responsibilities is only
available if you can pay for it. ''Work'' and ''family'' are still seen
as opposing rather than as complementary needs and there are new
pressures in the 1990s -- financial pressures, long hours, insecurity,
uncertainty.
Fewer women are marrying and more women are not having children -- we
shouldn't be surprised.
But I also think that in the absence of social support women have been
finding their own answers to the practical and political problems of
managing caring responsibilities alongside the need to earn a living.
Women who work flexibly and are finding ways to combine work at home
and outside it could be a model for a post-industrial workforce. Women
leaving corporate structures because they're weary of battling an ageist
and sexist mentality are among the most creative people in business.
Which is about economic policy and social and family policy. But avoid
the ''F'' word and say it's about women in society and you hit the main
excuse for the interviews I didn't do. They had a repeating pattern,
too, with a young-ish researcher reading the book and talking
enthusiastically to me and planning it all, only to come back with a
decision from the producer or editor, ''no, we did women last week,''
and once (memorably) ''no,'' Jimmy Young's doing women this week . . .''
I went to look for my book in a large bookstore. I couldn't see it but
checked with an assistant. ''About women? That'll be under gender
studies which is under sociology on the third floor.'' About men means
about people; about women it's specialist (as well as worthy and the
rest of it), a ''minority interest''. It's all about people, of course.
Finding new and better ways to work and live, matters urgent to all of
us, whatever we call ourselves, feminist or post-feminist, worthy and
unworthy, women and men.

<HEADLINE>Dunblane-based firm falsely claimed to be member of consumer protection groups. Bogus travel agency fined #8000</HEADLINE>

A TRAVEL firm which falsely claimed to be a member of travel agents'
consumer protection groups was fined #8000 yesterday.
At Stirling Sheriff Court, Dunblane-based Gold Crown Express Travel,
which ceased trading last year, was found guilty of falsely claiming to
be a member of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) and the
International Air Transport Association (Iata).
Company director Maggie Bremner was also fined #500 after admitting
allowing the acronyms to be used on the firm's notepaper.
The court was told that the offences occurred between December 1993
and January 1994 after the firm was set up following the collapse of
time-share agency International Resorts Sales and Travel which had
operated from the same offices until it went into liquidation.
Bremner, 45, of Ochiltree, Dunblane, told Sheriff John MacDonald that
the new firm was set up by former International Resorts boss William
Montgomery. He told her he had applied for Abta membership and until it
came through any travel arrangements would be made through an
Abta-bonded agent.
She claimed Mr Montgomery had asked her and another employee to be its
directors after reports of clients losing money carried in various
Scottish newspapers.
Bremner claimed Mr Montgomery had secured investors in the new firm,
including Celtic Football Club secretary Dominic Keane.
She alleged Mr Montgomery had had meetings with Mr Keane and his
brother, who lived in Florida, before the launch of Gold Crown.
She further claimed Mr Montgomery's plan was to make enough money out
of Gold Crown to pay off more than 350 couples who had paid money for
time-shares to IRST but had not received their deeds because cash had
not been forwarded to IRST's resorts in Florida and the Bahamas.
The court heard that customers were persuaded to pay up to #1995 for
membership of a travel club based in the United States. Gold Crown
purchased the memberships for $75.
Bremner said there had been chaotic scenes in the months running up to
the collapse of IRST, with irate customers phoning up and some still
waiting for their time-shares 18 months after handing over thousands of
pounds.
She claimed staff were frequently not paid at IRST or Gold Crown, and
that hundreds of cheques had bounced and printers were owed more than
#12,000.
Police had to be called to the Dunblane offices several times after
disturbances involving people who were owed money.
On one occasion, Bremner claimed, she and another executive had a
chair thrown at them by angry sales people in a Manchester sub-office of
Gold Crown who had not received their wages.
She said she was personally owed more than #10,000 in back wages and
expenses, and had only continued to work for Mr Montgomery because she
wished to see IRST customers reimbursed.
She claimed she had even paid for customers' holidays using her own
credit card.
''I stayed to try to help people get their title deeds for
time-share,'' she said. ''I visited them at their homes and got to know
them personally. I was their only link.''
She said of Mr Montgomery: ''I continued to have faith in him despite
all the problems.''
Defence counsel Donald McLeod said: ''In so far as Maggie Bremner must
bear responsibility, she did so under considerable pressure from Mr
Montgomery, to whom she was in a position of disadvantage because she
was owed so much money.''
Sheriff MacDonald said the firm deserved to pay the maximum penalty
for using the Abta and Iata logos.
And he told Bremner: ''I accept you were considerably influenced by
what William Montgomery said to you.''
After the case, Central Regional Council's chief trading standards
officer Mr Iain McLean said the investigation had been one of the most
lengthy and complicated ever undertaken by his department.
''I'm glad the fines reflect the seriousness of it,'' he said.
Among those who paid money to Gold Crown was Mrs Tracey Forsyth, of
Conifer Road, Mayfield, Midlothian.
She was not in court yesterday but relatives said she intended to
pursue the company through the civil courts to recover nearly #600.
At an earlier hearing, Mrs Forsyth told Sheriff MacDonald: 'I'd never
have given them my money if I had known they weren't a member of Abta.''
Mr Keane could not be contacted yesterday for his reaction.

Anvar Khan reviews Sue Innes's book which gives an insight to the
disaffection or love women have developed for feminism.
THE one thing that feminists cannot stomach about Baroness Margaret
Thatcher is the fact that she's right-wing. If she had been the first
socialist PM, she would have been hailed as a feminist icon. Feminists
are nearly always left-wing, because, unlike Tories, they're quite happy
to attribute their success to an ideaology, rather than their own
personal ability.
The left-wing, including men and women, insist that if us girls ruled
the world, it would be a much nicer place. The only world such political
animals are interested in, therefore, is a socialist democracy. If they
were merely concerned about women's rights they could congratulate any
female pioneer regardless of her political colour.
The author of Making It Work -- Women, Change and Challenge in the 90s
is journalist Sue Innes, a columnist for Scotland on Sunday. She devotes
a few pages to Baroness Thatcher, and less passionately than elsewhere
on other instances of sexual injustice, argues that the Cabinet gave her
a raw deal, but there is the underlying attitude that the quondam PM
asked for it because she didn't handle herself correctly.
Instead of heading the war against the Falklands, for example, as a
woman, she should have been highlighting efforts at Greenham Common.
Here, it could have been mentioned that the might of the suffragettes
once agreed, in response to criticism from men, that if women were truly
equal they should bear arms, that they should be prepared to fight for
the country whose power they wanted to share.
But let us not be churlish. Sue Innes, bless her, a woman who has made
a career out of a practising feminism, has put together a book which
aims to register the disaffection or love ordinary women have for it,
and we shall concern ourselves, as she has, with that.
The book is in three parts with 12 chapters and a conclusion. It is a
review of statistics, coupled with chat from Sue, and littered with
interviews with women in varying emotional and professional states of
grace. Some come across as annoyingly fulsome and whingey, the type who,
regardless of a feminist utopia, would, by their very lack of character
or ability, be destined to fail anyway.
A woman who dropped out of nurse training of her own accord pops up to
talk about a new direction. She gives the ground-breaking insight: ''You
realise you do know things and you're learning new things -- you realise
you're still a person.''
Notable feminists are interviewed too, for their wisdom. Joyce
McMillan is quoted as saying that it is a trade-off, having a career
instead of kids. But the point is that women are now free from the
expectation of having kids. Neither feminism nor Mother Nature may dare
legislate for woman's individual fulfilment. The truth is, that not all
healthy, fertile women want kids. If the small percentage of women who
have careers, edit kids from their lives, the human race will not die
out. But if women don't work, the vociferous and practical demand for
equal pay and equal opportunities will.
One thing I did learn, as a twenty-something female, from the book,
which was useful, is that it is a bad idea to cancel having a family in
the belief that their omission ensures a high-flying career, because
there is no evidence to support this. If you do want children you might
as well have them.
The standard of writing in the book is unfortunately poor, often
convoluted. There are some real humdingers. For example: ''The strength
of 'second wave' feminism was that it began to explore the interface
between social definitions of women and the subjective experience of
femininity'', is plain seventies ''femspeak'', a lapse in the order of
the English language, a reference to a time when student feminism was
discussed in artificial and pseudo-intellectual terms. It was then, as
it is now, of little sense or impact.
The book records, faithfully, what British women have said about their
economic and social status. And you get the impression that some of the
female worthies, the writers, the community workers, and commentators
interviewed are professional talkers. That they spend an inordinate
amount of time debating issues, when they should be going mainstream, in
the workplace, wowing male or female bosses, and paving the way.
A lot of time has been spent analysing feminism, devising and
redefining it. The urge to do, to tangibly achieve, has been relegated.
This would be typical.
Women love to talk and share their experiences. Feminism, the concept,
has survived by countless numbers of women talking, resurrecting
theories, in magazines, on the radio, on TV. But who is implementing it
for real? The book goes on and on about issues ''we have to think
about''. There are women all over the country, it would seem, who are
prepared for success, but have forgotten all about achieving it.
''This is the book we've been waiting for: a front-line report on
women in Britain today'' exalts the blurb on the back cover. Women are
not on the front line. If only Eve was indeed ahead, and not assigned
back-bencher status, there, to operate, as a noisy nuisance, rather with
the effectiveness of leadership.

THE Millennium Fund's grant of #42.5m towards speeding up the creation
of a 5000-mile national cycle network is an inspired move, if only to
bolster the efforts of Sustrans which began the whole process.
While the process of transforming disused railways, casual towpaths,
old tracks, and roadside verges into acceptable cycle paths is
relatively cheap, the next stage of changing inner-city centres to suit
only pedestrians, bicycles, and trams, is not.
Sir George Young, the Transport Secretary, should therefore forget the
present euphoria and move to provide Government money towards
transforming the UK transport system.
The bicycle may be an extremely cheap and efficient form of transport
but it still has limitations in rural districts, especially in winter.
The Government must promote public transport at the expense of the
private car if it is serious about environmental problems.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday extended the deadline for
businesses to lodge appeals against rates revaluation notices, which
have more than doubled in many cases.
His decision -- announced via Scottish Industry and Local Government
Minister George Kynoch -- came on the very day that appeals should have
closed in Strathclyde.
The extension to December 15 followed protests from the business
community, which argued that any so-called equity with systems in
England and Wales was a joke.
Complaints that there was no effective deadline south of the Border,
suggesting appeals could be lodged to the year 2001 -- compared with
September 30 for most of Scotland -- were raised privately with Mr
Forsyth last week by the Forum of Private Business.
FPB Scottish spokesman Mr Jim Gorie said that he was delighted the
Scottish Secretary had listened and acted upon protests that ''many
small businesses could not meet the original deadline''.
The objections were underlined by separate legislation that allowed
English firms to appeal over the next five years.
Mr Gorie added that Scottish difficulties in meeting original
deadlines were made worse by dubious rating consultancies who went into
liquidation after promising to lodge appeals.
Mr Kynoch announced the extension of three months in a brief
statement, and added: ''The decision comes after requests for an
extension from the business community on behalf of those ratepayers who
disagree with rateable valuations placed on their premises following
revaluation.''
He said an amendment order to the Valuation Timetable (Scotland) Order
1995 has been made. However, valuation appeal committees would start to
schedule hearings in respect of those already lodged.
The Herald last week revealed a record number of Glasgow businesses
had already lodged appeals before the September 15 closing date.
One reason for the increase involved block submissions by Strathclyde
Regional Council over revaluations of its property made by an employee,
the regional assessor.
A similar response to the five-yearly revaluation exercise was
forecast elsewhere in Scotland, which has more than 200,000 non-domestic
properties. They face uplifts in rateable value of up to 150%, with the
average rise 32%.
The introduction of a unified business rate, plus phasing arrangements
or transitional relief announced by the Scottish Office, should soften
the impact of rises, with annual increases restricted to 10%.
The Federation of Small Businesses remains adamant that no ''level
playing field'' exists between Scottish and English rate bills,
regardless of the new unified business rate. It wants even more appeals
because Scottish firms ''are still being penalised''.

YOU report that the Argyle Line in Glasgow is being reopened after
flood damage (September 7).
Your readers may also like to know that the Kelvin Walkway, which has
been closed since December from Kelvingrove Park right through to North
Kelvinside, opened about a month ago. The publicity was conspicious by
its absence.
However, if the parks and recreation department clear away the sand,
rubbish, and undergrowth it could return to normal use.
The Kelvin Walkway is, or was, used by thousands of joggers,
commuters, cyclists and walkers and was recently promoted as a strategic
cycle route by Strathclyde Roads.
Is it too much to ask that parks and recreation divert some of the
promotional budget for Scotstoun Leisure Centre to finish the job and
promote such a vital traffic-free route?

<HEADLINE>Home Secretary asks BBC to drop police killer film clip</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976355597</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Home Secretary last night called on the BBC to drop a sequence of
film from an Everyman programme in which a police killer talks about the
murder.
MrMichael Howard said the programme would cause ''obvious and
understandable distress to the family of a brave police officer killed
in the line of duty''.
The film features Robert Eades talking about the murder of Sergeant
Derek Robertson, stabbed to death after the policeman responded to a 999
call about a sub-post office raid.
In a statement last night, the BBC said: ''BBC TV executives will be
looking at the programme, and we will respond later today.''
Earlier, a BBC spokeswoman had confirmed it was considering a request
from Mr Derek Lewis, director general of the Prison Service, to drop the
sequence.
The request was being considered by the BBC's head of religious
broadcasting, the Rev Ernie Rea.
In a statement, Mr Howard said: ''The broadcasting of remarks made by
a convicted murderer serves no public interest and is insulting to the
memory of Sergeant Derek Robertson.
''I entirely share the family's strong objections to the broadcast of
the material. I have made my position clear to the BBC and I trust that
they will now respond by removing this material from the programme.''
The programme features a minuteanda half ''fly on the wall'' recording
of a conversation between Eades and a psychologist in which Eades talks
about the killing.
Eades stabbed Mr Robertson -- who was armed with only a truncheon --
six times. He was sentenced in January to a minimum 25 years'
imprisonment.
The documentary, called Confrontation on E-Wing, was made by an
independent producer.
Earlier, MPs from across the political spectrum expressed their
disgust at the proposed transmission.
Tory MP Michael Shersby, parliamentary adviser to the Police
Federation, said: ''I shall write to the chairman of the BBC and ask him
not to transmit the programme.
''I went to Sergeant Robertson's funeral. It's quite disgraceful that
the BBC should transmit a film about this man in custody. That's a
totally inappropriate use of television.''
The politicians' distaste for the programme, a 50-minute documentary
scheduled for screening on Sunday, was mirrored in a statement from the
Police Federation's national vice chairman, Mr Ian Westwood.
He said: ''We are disgusted that the BBC has spent public money on
putting this programme together and are even contemplating transmitting
it.''
A BBC spokeswoman said there was ''no question of the BBC or the
programme condoning serious crime, nor of giving a convicted murderer a
platform''.
It was intended to examine the pioneering work of psychologists at
Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, helping criminals to come to terms
with the consequences of their crimes.
The BBC stressed the sequence featuring Eades was a ''fly on the
wall'' style recording of a conversation between the prisoner and the
psychologist, not an interview with Eades by the BBC.
Contrary to earlier reports, the spokeswoman said that, in the version
due to be transmitted, Eades did not use the words ''too conscientious''
in describing Mr Robertson's attempt to arrest him, although she
acknowledged that was the gist of his remarks.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday demanded
emergency aid for communities hit by recent flooding in the north-east.
On a visit to the worst-hit area around Keith, Mr Robertson met
councillors from the Moray unitary authority and representatives of the
National Farmers' Union before calling for the Government to set up an
emergency task force.
''These floods have been disastrous for farmers and householders,'' he
said. ''For some farmers, the floods have produced freak crop conditions
which have led to thousands of pounds worth of losses.''

<TEXT>
A FATAL accident inquiry into the Chinook helicopter disaster has been
postponed until January, to enable solicitors representing families of
the two dead pilots to make detailed investigations into several
''matters of concern''.
Sheriff Principal Robert Hay agreed yesterday to adjourn the inquiry,
which had been due to begin at Paisley on October 16, to allow Mr Peter
Watson and Mr Martin Stephen more time to interview expert witnesses and
consult technical documents.
Twenty-nine people -- including senior Northern Ireland security
officials -- died when the helicopter crashed into a hillside near
Campbeltown in the summer of 1994.
The sheriff also set aside a full month for the inquiry, starting on
January 8, after hearing that it was unlikely that the two weeks
originally allocated would be adequate.
Calling for the adjournment, Mr Watson said a number of concerns had
been drawn to his attention which had been touched upon by the board of
inquiry, but which, in the opinion of those instructing him, ''had not
been dealt with adequately''.
It had become apparent that only 10 of the witnesses he would require
to precognose would be available for interview, and some military
personnel were currently not available.
He was seeking to recover additional productions, such as records and
technical papers which his experts wished to examine. So far that had
not been possible, although the Ministry of Defence had indicated they
were being compiled.

THE new director-general of the Confederation of British Industry
yesterday backed his predecessor's call for restraints on boardroom pay
for ''industry fat cats''.
Mr Adair Turner, who takes up his post on Monday, said directors' pay
should reflect their performance.
He backed Mr Howard Davies, the new deputy governor of the Bank of
England, who said highly paid company directors should be brought ''back
into line'' and face pay cuts to regain public confidence.
Mr Davies told BBC Radio 4 certain companies should reassess pay
awards and go to shareholders for approval.
Mr Turner said he did not want to comment on any particular rate but
said he supported Mr Davies and the Greenbury report's recommendation
for immediate reviews of boardroom pay.
At the other end of the scale, Mr Turner supported the official CBI
policy in opposing any minimum wage.
About 94% of Scots disapprove of the recent salary increases and share
option deals awarded to chief executives and chairmen of the privatised
electricity and gas industries, according to a poll published yesterday
by the public sector union Unison, writes David Ross, Highland
Correspondent.
Labour, meanwhile, launched plans to increase the powers of the
privatised utilities' regulators to make them enforce standards of
service and curb the indulgences at the top. If pay and perks keep going
up, customers' bills should come down, according to Labour.

VOWING ''I will never give up'', paralysed actor Christopher Reeve has
angrily denied a tabloid newspaper report that he wanted his wife to let
him die peacefully by turning off his respirator.
In an open letter to the National Enquirer, Reeve said the
sensationalist weekly tabloid's assertion that he begged his wife to
''pull the plug'' was ''so hurtful and so completely without foundation
that I felt I had to respond.
''I have not given up. I will never give up. An article such as yours,
while distressing in the extreme, will not deter me,'' Reeve said.
Reeve, 42, the star of the Superman films, has been paralysed from the
neck down since he was injured in a horseback riding accident over three
months ago in Virginia. He is undergoing rehabilitation at a New Jersey
clinic and breathes with the aid of a respirator.
The article said that Reeve became depressed when, according to the
newspaper, doctors told him he would probably not survive high-risk
experimental therapy and would remain paralysed for the rest of his
life.
The Florida-based publication said it stood by its story.--Reuter.

CLARE HENRY finds that Open Doors Day is an eye-opener for
architectural aficionados.
AS soon as you read this, grab your coat and rush out. A fire? A
flood? A hurricane? No, It's Open Doors Day, quite the most brilliant
idea ever. Today and tomorrow you can amuse yourself for free, poking
your nose into other people's buildings, offices, studios, halls, homes,
workrooms, churches -- even their loos. Because on Open Doors Day all
sorts of buildings, public and private, famous and unknown, large and
small, new and old, are open to the public.
''I never knew this place existed,'' is a common cry as folk discover
architectural jewels they have previously rushed past. Low-profile
exteriors can hide glorious interiors as I found last Saturday in
Paisley when I visited St Matthew's, a fabulous Art Nouveau church
designed by local architect W D McLennan in 1906 for #9000.
This weekend it's the turn of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Alloa,
Banff, Cumbernauld, Dumfries, Hamilton, Inverness, Perth, and others to
open their doors. You've missed Paisley -- but I recommend it for next
year. Glasgow was the first city in the UK to have Open Doors Day. That
was in 1990. People loved it. It was a success from the word go. Today
it's spread to 26 towns in Scotland -- even London followed suit.
Sadly Scotland can't claim to have originated the idea. The concept
for European Heritage Days, as they are officially called on the
Continent, was initiated by the Council of Europe in 1984. The first was
in Paris. Doors Open Days now exist in Budapest, Athens, Leiden,
Copenhagen, Ljubljana, Riga, Stockholm, Lisbon, and hundreds of other
cities.
I went on the first Glasgow Open Doors Day when about 20 places
tentatively put a toe in the water, and I discovered the sumptuous
Clydeport interior of 1908; St Luke's 1879 Greek Orthodox Cathedral in
the West End and, on the South Side, Queens Park Synagogue with its
beautiful modern stained-glass commissioned from John Clark in 1990.
This year there are 95 venues to visit -- they even had to turn some
applications away.
Every year I make a point of visiting places new to me, and have never
been disappointed. With Glasgow City of Architecture and Design 1999 on
the horizon, it's all the more important that Glaswegians appreciate the
rich heritage they possess. This is a terrific chance to get to know
your city better -- and to argue for improvements.
I'm appalled at the lack of signage, documentation -- never mind a
basic postcard -- of many of Glasgow's best buildings. Hutchesons' Hall
is among the most elegant. It's in the heart of the city and occupied by
the National Trust -- yet you can't even get a postcard of it there.
Yes, we know there are lots of neglected buildings -- there are the
trees growing out of them to prove it -- but when is Glasgow going to
shout loudly about its riches of fabulous, clean, well-maintained,
unique architecture? It's no good bemoaning what's been lost. Celebrate
what we still have.
Among the many glories is 3 Park Terrace, the residence of the Lord
Provost in the 1870s. Now the offices and home of architects Parr
Shearer, it has been immaculately and lovingly restored by them from a
virtual ruin back into its extraordinary Victorian white and gold
magnificence. This sort of thing takes huge private commitment and one
wonders if the city appreciates what many folk have done to help
Glasgow's conservation movement over the past 20 years.
Another super building is the former Ross Memorial Church at 160 West
Regent Street, now the offices of Keppie Architects. It sits beside the
Compass Gallery, so I have passed it for years and only this week
visited its elaborate interior with impressive carved decoration and
stained glass.
With 1999 in mind, Liz Davidson, director of Glasgow Building
Preservation Trust, who orchestrates Glasgow's Doors Open Day, has got a
number of architects to open their own offices, including Norman Foster
Associates in the Pumphouse at Finneston Quay; BDP Architects in
Blythswood Square (in the old Lady Artists Club remodelled by
Mackintosh), and Page and Park in the Italian Centre.
Some architects are speaking in the buildings they are responsible for
-- so meet them face to face and don't be shy to make your own views
known. After all, Glasgow won the accolade of Year of Architecture and
Design 1999 on the basis of its excellent public consultation and
grassroots involvement.
Glasgow's most famous architects are of course Mackintosh and Greek
Thomson in the nineteenth century and Coia in the twentieth. Scotland
Street School is one Mackintosh gem often overlooked (they have a good
cafe too), while Thomson's Holmwood in Netherlee Road has recently been
saved for the city and is definitely worth a visit as restoration begins
to make incredible discoveries.
Jack Coia has been hailed as the founder of Scottish modern church
design. His open Catholic churches include St Charles, St Columkillies
in Rutherglen (1940), and St Anne's in Whitevale Street from 1931.
The range of buildings is tremendous, from Rogano's, Britain's most
stylish Art Deco restaurant, via Leiper's 1866 Cottier Theatre to
Atlantic Quay built in 1991. There's a Buddhist Centre, the GDA's lavish
Atrium Court (ride the waterfall lifts); the Victorian Procurators
Library in Mandela Place, Pitt Street's Police Museum, Follies nightclub
-- not forgetting the City Chambers.
The excellent Open Doors leaflet is divided into areas: City Centre,
Townhead, Riverside; Glasgow Green, West End, Garnethill, Kelvinside to
Possil, South Side and Park Circus.
Brand new -- indeed not quite finished but game to be seen -- are the
Piping Centre in the old Cowcaddens Church, rescued from dereliction to
become Scotland's only bagpiping centre by architects McGurn Logan
Duncan Opfer, and the last surviving Georgian tobacco baron's house, in
Miller Street. This is being restored by Glasgow Preservation Trust to
act as its new base.
To cap it all tomorrow you can even visit The Herald building
(designed by Sir Owen Williams in 1936 with a sleek extension in 1987 by
Burnet, Bell &amp; Partners) with guided tours at 10am, 12pm and 2pm. Happy
hunting!

Place for times and details of special events, talks and tours.

SHE was one of the Petticoat pirates, that group of media dragon
ladies -- they included Eve Pollard, who went on to become a Fleet
Street editor -- who began their journalistic careers in the 1960s on
the then smart teenage magazine Petticoat edited by the legendary Audrey
Slaughter.
They were all aggressive and ruthlessly ambitious, but it is probably
true to say that Janet Street-Porter was in a class on her own. She not
only looked outrageous, deliberately so, she sounded outrageous,
although that was due more to natural causes than affectation. Her south
London accent was compounded by her dental equipment so that the vocal
sounds she produced were strident, possibly unique, and undeniably
attention grabbing.
The funny thing about her attack on the men in grey suits who are
running and ruining British television, delivered at the Edinburgh
Television Festival two weeks ago in the MacTaggart lecture, is that she
had said it all before. The fat tomcats of British television have been
castrated by the lady many times.
She made headlines four years ago when she railed about the BBC's
''masonic league of ritualistic men in grey suits'' who, she claimed,
had ''tried for years to keep her out''. In Edinburgh she alleged that
the blight holding back Britain's TV industry was ''the dreaded four Ms:
male, middle class, middle-aged, and mediocre''.
Those executives in the audience she had in mind had no doubt that she
was referring to them. The attack hit home because, as they know only
too well, standards on British TV are falling. The days when that boast
about being the best in the world will no longer be remotely plausible,
let alone true, loom close.
Thrice married, six feet tall, with great big teeth, the oldest living
punk in Britain, 48-year-old Street-Porter, who has spent her career
creating a public image of herself -- and selling it brilliantly -- has
had a hell of a two weeks. On top of the furore her lecture created came
her departure, after a mere nine months, from Live TV, the cable service
run by the Mirror Group.
She had fallen foul of two men who qualified for at least three of her
Ms. There is no way anyone would regard either David Montgomery, the
group's chief executive, or Kelvin MacKenzie, the man who made the Sun
what it was, Mirror Television's managing director, as mediocre.
The lecture looks now like a suicide note, because life with Kelvin at
Live TV, launched in June, was anything but compatible. It was a
disaster area. The tales of separate cars taking the pair to promotional
events to sell the new service, their blazing rows -- spiced with
personal insults -- over just what the service should be like, have been
the talk of the Docklands' steamie where the fledgling operation has its
headquarters in the Docklands Tower for months. ''What's going on makes
Drop the Dead Donkey look like Jackanory,'' said one observer.
She joined Live TV nine months ago, one of her coterie said, because
she wanted to be called managing director and have a bigger toy box than
the BBC would give her. It was seen as a vanity project and a waste of
her talents, but her precipitate departure has not led to lamentations
and gnashing of teeth from the station's staff.
Although they may fear what Mackenzie will do to Live TV -- he could
turn it into the television equivalent of the Sun -- they hated what she
was doing with it. In particular the Street-Porter hallmark, an info-bar
running across the bottom of the screen which contained plugs for future
programmes, jokes, and other youth-oriented information was detested.
There is no need to weep for her. The Colossus of Clerkenwell, where
she has her ultra modern home, a building straight from a Gaudi
nightmare, may have been toppled, but she has not departed Canary Wharf
empty handed. The pay off -- she is said to have had a two-year contract
-- is put at anything between #100,000 and #300,000. That kind of money,
as well as buying time, buys silence, so her side of the story will be
slow in coming out. But she has a problem. Where does she go next?
Is her departure, as one former Channel 4 colleague said, ''a blip''
in her career, or will losing what she insisted was ''her baby'' prove
more serious?
She failed in her ambition at the BBC, which was to become a channel
controller, either of BBC1 or BBC2, and there would not seem to be any
place for her there to return to. Maybe it is back to presenting and
producing programmes that she should go, because there is no denying
Street-Porter was both a mesmeric, if irritating, performer -- a sort of
Esther Rantzen with attitude -- and a gifted programme maker.
On and behind the camera she has had an impact on what is seen on our
TV screens, especially programmes for those who belong to -- what she
memorably called, since those teeth affect her diction -- ''yoof''.
Janet Street-Porter, born Janet Bull, has always suffered at the hands
of the media. Her voice has been described as having ''the tone, pitch,
and certainty of a South London cabbie in pain''. It has also been
called ''strangulated Cockney'', but it cannot be since she was born in
Fulham, which is well out of earshot of Bow bells.
She has been called loud, sassy, and garish, her teeth mocked as being
like tombstones, her legs called beanpoles, and her dress ludicrous. She
was once described as ''a woman who looks like a traffic light and
sounds like a Tannoy'' and ''the mistress of the glottal stop''.
But there is no need to feel sorry for her, although Kelvin MacKenzie
did go too far when, in a notorious Sun stunt in 1988, he published a
photograph of her and a horse side by side and urged the readers to
decide which was the uglier. (With that in their mutual past lives it is
hard to see how anybody ever thought they would work well together at
Live TV.) She is her own creation, after all.
Her parents, Cherrie and Frank Bull, were a local government clerk and
an electrical engineer, living in Fulham, who were proud of their
academically inclined daughter. She took 11 O levels and four A levels,
seeing them as a means to an end.
When she was 14 the family moved from Fulham to Perivale, and Janet,
who had no intention of being confined in the suburban wastelands,
proved a rebellious teenager forever coming home late after
night-clubbing in the West End where she sported the latest fashions
designed by herself and funded from Saturday jobs in shops.
She went to architectural college, but did not finish the course,
leaving after a year to try journalism. She got a job on Petticoat,
where she was not popular, moved to the Evening Standard, the Daily
Mirror, and proved a smart writer about fashion.
She also spent a short time on London radio before becoming a
television presenter on the London Weekend Show in 1975, a job she held
for four years. She was a success, although the show was only seen in
London, and it led to her hosting Saturday Night People with Clive James
and Russell Harty, a cheeky late-night chat show.
Her youth-oriented programme, Network 7, for Channel 4 won her a Bafta
for originality and led to her being recruited in 1988 by the BBC as
head of youth programmes, the corporation having discovered that there
was a youth audience.
Four years ago she was promoted from commissioning editor to head of
youth and entertainment features with an annual budget of #9m. She has
been responsible for programmes like Dance Energy, compered by her
latest boyfriend, Normski, who is 20 years her junior; Good Sport,
presented by John Fashanu; Rough Guide to the World; A-Z of Belief;
Reportage; and How Do They Do That?
There was also a disastrous game show called Style Trial and something
called Paramount City. She also launched the BBC's Def II strand and, by
the end of her career there, was responsible for almost 200 hours of
programming a year.
As to what it added up to, cynics dismiss the typical Street-Porter
product as a triumph of style over content, which requires little
concentration, is drenched in gimmicks, and presented by fashionable
people. But it hits its market spot on.
She also launched the careers of the likes of Ruby Wax and Danny
Baker. Although her ambition led her into the role of executive, she is
probably best equipped to be a creator.
The job she wanted was that of either controller of BBC1 or BBC2 --
there was a terrible media scare when it was thought she might become
head of music and arts -- but neither proved to be in the gift of her
long-time ally, John Birt.
Last September, realising that she had gone about as far as she could
go, she left the BBC and moved to Montgomery's then, and still, chancy
cable TV venture. The rest is history.
She has always been different. She got engaged for the first time aged
14, but her mother put a stop to that, so she tried again aged 16, and
finally got married for the first time when she was 19 to a
photographer, Tim Street-Porter, whose surname she has kept.
Two other husbands, Tony Elliot, publisher of Time Out, and Frank
Cvitanovich followed, and in between marriages and afterwards there have
been her blokes. She likes a man about the house, allegedly plunders her
boyfriends for ideas, and, because they are younger than she is, gets
round any biological clock problems because she can mother them.
She relaxes at her cottage in Yorkshire and, to everyone's amazement,
is president of the Ramblers Association. She likes long walks. They
clear the mind.
Her talent is having her finger on the common pulse, an inbred ability
to spot trends before they happen, and stars before they get there. She
is said to be a most effective and brilliant producer, although someone
who grossly over-commits herself and, while being the guru of ''yoof'',
has solid establishment virtues.
She works hard and has an instinct for power games. People who have
worked with her say she can be tyrannical. She says: ''I know exactly
what I want, and when I want it, and it's probably half an hour ago.''
As to what makes her tick, Tony Elliott -- whose Time Out staff went
on strike for a week when he employed her as a deputy editor -- summed
it up succinctly: ''Work makes her tick.''
The last has not been seen, let alone heard, of Janet Street-Porter.

FOUR million working days and millions of pounds are lost every year
in Scotland because of stress-related illnesses, a seminar on stress was
told yesterday.
The huge increase in stress among workers had a variety of causes, but
among the biggest were overwork, worry over losing a job and large scale
redundancies, said Ms Roslyn Taylor, a clinical psychologist.
''There is now a feeling that people are expendable and managers can
get away with anything,'' said Ms Taylor, an expert on the handling of
stress.
There was a new culture in many companies where it was no longer
acceptable for people to leave work at their allotted time, she said.
Instead, staff were working longer and longer hours because they were so
worried about their future.
''People are terrified they are going to lose their jobs so, where
there is that kind of culture, people do not want to be seen to be the
first to leave,'' said Ms Taylor, who formerly worked at Paisley's
Dykebar Hospital.
The seminar was organised by Glasgow Chamber of Commerce. More than
100 members were told how to recognise symptoms, their causes and how
they could deal with the problem.
During the 1970s, there had been a move towards ''caring'' management,
but this had largely disappeared in the 1980s as increased competition,
the widening free market and more aggressive management styles took
over, said Ms Taylor.
There was now a recognised syndrome in many companies known as
''anorexic organisation'' where firms had cut staff so far back that
there were not enough people to do the job properly.
Ms Taylor, who is now a partner in a clinical psychology practice
which helps companies to cut stress levels and so improve performance,
said that recent guidelines published by the Health and Safety Executive
made it compulsory for companies to offer help to staff suffering from
stress.
Public sector organisations were now at the forefront in tackling
stress and it was no longer considered ''macho'' for people to pretend
that the problem did not exist.
Stress afflicted people right across the board, with symptoms
appearing in staff in all kinds of jobs and professions. As well as
causing sickness, it sapped productivity, creativity and motivation.
The chamber's Mr Charlie Hall said: ''Stress costs industry millions
every year in sickness and absenteeism. Our event is a direct response
to this.''

Frances Horsburgh examines what's in store for councillors and
officials at this year's Herald conference on local government reform.
THE Herald is preparing to stage a second major local government
conference in Edinburgh. As at last year's highly successful gathering,
the views expressed by keynote speakers will be hard-hitting, relevant,
and provocative.
The open discussions and expert-led workshops will mean that everyone
who attends can become involved.
Almost halfway through this vital transitional year between the old
two-tier system of local government and the new unitary structure, The
Herald's conference offers Scotland's politicians and senior council
officials the chance to draw breath for a day, to listen to each other's
experiences, and to look ahead.
Scottish Local Government minister George Kynoch will be the first
main speaker, with Cosla president Councillor Rosemary McKenna and
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson rounding up events later in
the day.
In between, Lothian region convener and chairman of the new City of
Edinburgh Council, Eric Milligan, will be among those speakers tackling
the challenge of reform.
With splendid timing The Herald's first Challenge of Change conference
took place in November 1994 just a few days after the reorganisation
legislation had finally received royal assent.
At that time Scotland's 29 new single-tier councils were on the brink
of being born and, despite all the protests, local authority water and
sewerage services were set to move under the control of the three new
water quangos.
Elections to the new councils took place last April with the
Conservatives failing to win control of a single one of the new
authorities.
This year's Challenge of Change conference, which takes place on
November 2, is just as timely, coming as it does a few weeks before the
Budget and the hard facts it will reveal about the financial situation
the new councils can expect when they take full control next April.
Already provisional figures for this year have revealed a large
disparity between spending levels and the amount of grant which some
councils could expect to receive. Glasgow and Dundee look like being
especially hard hit.
In addition, most councils are also complaining that the #36m
allocated by the Government to cover their reorganisation costs during
this transitional year is not nearly adequate.
After the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has told the House of Commons on
November 28 how high our personal taxes will be for 1996-97, local
government will also learn how much of its spending will be supported by
Government grant.
On the basis of previous projections coming from the Scottish Office,
Cosla is already predicting further cutbacks will be needed.
Decentralisation is one of the buzz words in Scottish local government
these days as the new authorities have to produce their individual plans
to devolve power by the end of 1997. Many are already planning to take
important steps in this direction.
New Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has expressed his own
enthusiasm for this form of devolution and wants to see community
councils playing a more meaningful role.
At the conference two new chief executives -- John Anderson of the
Glasgow Council, and Arthur McCourt from the Highland authority -- will
give their views on whether the issues involved in bringing more power
to the people differ between urban and rural areas.
Later Neil McDowall, director of law and administration for the
Aberdeenshire council, will hold a workshop describing one council's
progress towards decentralisation.
Scottish local government's umbrella organisation, the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities, is about to reinvent itself in an exercise
in some ways necessitated by the move from two-tier to single-tier
councils.
Cosla, however, is going further and will be emerging next year with a
new slimmed-down committee structure and a more pro-active stance, it is
promised.
Douglas Sinclair, its recently appointed new secretary-general and
formerly chief executive of Central region, will address The Herald's
conference in a keynote speech.
The conference will also examine the extent to which the
reorganisation has provided opportunities for management and structural
reforms within councils and the problems and solutions which are being
found.
Margaret Ford, director of the Eglinton Management Centre in
Edinburgh, will be conducting a workshop at the conference ''Building a
corporate structure -- merging authorities successfully''.
She says: ''With all the negative publicity which has surrounded a few
of the appointments of senior staff to the new councils, a lot of good
work which has been done has been overshadowed.
''The conference will provide a great opportunity to highlight much of
the positive and constructive progress which has been made by the new
councils.''

How would the history of the Second World War read if it had been
written by the soldiers rather than generals and politicians?
WHAT was it like for the foot soldiers in the Second World War? Fifty
years after the guns stopped firing, the answer to this question is
unclear, says Dr Paul Addison, of the department of history at Edinburgh
University.
Next week he will chair an international academic conference which
will examine the ordinary soldier's experience and will be addressed by
27 speakers covering a wide spectrum.
In Dr Addison's view, much has become known about people at the top --
commanders and politicians -- but little attention has been given to
what soldiering was like for those actually involved in the fighting --
private soldiers, NCOs, and junior officers in the main combatant armies
in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.
''How different was it for the foot soldiers in the British Army from
the German Army?'' he asks.
''If you got old comrades talking, would they tell the same stories
about the sergeant major? Were the ordinary German soldiers
indoctrinated with Nazism in the same way as the SS?''
The gathering, to be held at Edinburgh University's Pollock Halls of
Residence from September 22 to 24, will be the first time a major
conference has taken a bottom-up view of the conflict in Europe, he
says.
''There has been exciting pioneering work in recent years and the time
is ripe for a full-scale discussion. Above all, we'll be looking at the
factors that make or break morale and the capacity of the troops to keep
on fighting.
''What were relations like with the officers? What was the food like
and the accommodation? What was their physical state? How much sleep did
they get?''
As he refers to books on the war, Dr Addison comments there is not
enough oral history.
''There is still time to do it. You could get a large number of people
who served in the Second World War and get a very good oral history
project. Ideally, what you want is a German and British team doing a
comparative study.
''This is historical gold there for the digging.''
One question at the conference will be what kept the Red Army
fighting, considering that casualties on the Eastern Front were higher
than anywhere else.
Dr Jeremy Crang, of Edinburgh University's history department, will
speak on the British soldier on the home front.
The actual feelings of soldiers are difficult to get at, he says, but
raw material has survived in letters by both British and German soldiers
which their respective authorities opened.
A main question, Dr Crang says, is whether armies are motivated by
ideas or by primary groups, the members of which are prepared to die for
their friends.
One study has suggested that the ''buddy'' system is not enough and
soldiers have to be ideologically motivated.
Speakers will include Professor Norman Stone, of Oxford University, on
''The Croats and the Black Legend'', Dr Diana Henderson, of Edinburgh
University, on ''The Scottish Soldier'', and Professor John Erickson, of
Edinburgh University, on ''Red Army battlefield performance 1941-45''.
Although the conflict in the Far East will not be included in the
conference programme, American academics will contribute.
The conference aims to attract an audience both of specialists in
military history and those with experience of the life of the soldier.
Len Deighton, the author, and Scots poet Hamish Henderson are to be
among those attending the event.

A MAN appeared in court yesterday accused of repeatedly firing a
shotgun through a bedroom door in the direction of his wife and family.
Mr Brian MacAulay, 59, who appeared from custody, pled not guilty at
Stirling Sheriff Court to recklessly discharging the gun in the
direction of his wife, Marilyn, two other members of his family, Colin
and Deborah MacAulay, and Fraser McGhee of St James Terrace, Kilmacolm,
at the family home at Park Terrace, Stirling, on Thursday.
He also pled not guilty to being disorderly, committing a breach of
the peace, and assaulting his wife by seizing hold of her, pushing her
against a wall, grabbing her by the throat, compressing her neck, and
attempting to strike her with his knee.
He was released on bail.
Trial, which will be before a sheriff alone under summary procedure,
was set for December.

A TEENAGER who knocked over a 77-year-old woman causing her to break
her hip and shoulder when he stole her bag was given 240-hours'
community service yesterday.
Ryan O'Neill, 16, had been drinking when he attacked Mrs Margaret
Hunter as she walked home with her shopping in a lane in Lochgelly,
Fife, on September 20 last year.
O'Neill, 15 at the time, grabbed Mrs Hunter's bag causing her to fall
to the ground, fracturing her hip and shoulder.
The High Court in Edinburgh was told the teenager had fallen into bad
company and drank about half a bottle of cheap wine before assaulting
Mrs Hunter. He spent some of the #13 he stole on cans of lager.
Lord Mayfield told O'Neill that normally a period of detention would
be imposed for such a serious offence, but said he was prepared to give
him the chance of carrying out community service.
First offender O'Neill, of Cardenden, Fife, had admitted assaulting
Mrs Hunter to her severe injury and permanent impairment and robbing her
of a bag containing groceries, greeting cards and a purse containing
#13.
Mrs Hunter was detained in hospital for two weeks after the incident
for treatment to her injuries. Two days after she was released her
husband died.

DES O'Connor is terrifying, SingalongaMax scares them to bits, but if
you really want to put the frighteners on car thieves turn to Ian
Paisley.
The Ulsterman's booming rhetoric is the most popular request for a new
anti-theft device which uses full volume tape recordings.
Any would-be crook trying to prise open a car fitted with the Waso
alarm is hit by a 120 decibel blast of the owner's choice.
So far, the strangled tones of Ian Paisley have been the most popular
choice to deter thieves.
In second place, appropriately for a former Shadow Transport
Secretary, is Labour's deputy leader John Prescott.
A loud rendition of one of his heart-felt working man's speeches sends
a shiver down the spines of thieves as they try the locks.
Des O'Connor, whose voice once frightened the fish in a Russ Abbot TV
ad for cigars, is in third place.
Max Bygraves proves you may need hands but you also need a lot of
nerve to rob a car playing his tunes -- he is fourth most popular.
Another popular choice is former US President Richard Nixon.
Motorists particularly like the line from a speech in which he denied
his involvement in Watergate by shouting: ''I am not a crook.''
A spokesman for Nuneaton-based Waso Vehicle Security said: ''Des and
Max at full throttle are enough to scare most people, but Ian Paisley's
voice is by far the most terrifying one we have fitted so far and is the
most popular.''
It is not known whether anyone has ever asked for a recording of a
John Major speech.
A security insider commented: ''Somehow, a very loud voice saying 'oh
yes' frightening off a gang of thieves is pretty hard to imagine.''

ASTRO-PHYSICIST Stephen Hawking married his former nurse Elaine Mason
in a simple private ceremony in Cambridge Registry Office yesterday.
Wheelchair-bound Professor Hawking -- author of the best-selling book
A Brief History of Time -- speaks with the help of a computerised voice
synthesizer. He said after the ceremony:''It's wonderful. I have married
the woman I love.''
His 45-year-old bride was hired by his former wife, Jane, to help the
53-year-old Cambridge University professor cope with the crippling
effects of Motor Neurone Disease.
Later Professor Hawking moved in with his nurse, leaving his wife Jane
after 25 years of marriage.
Yesterday the newlyweds posed for around 50 photographers after the
45-minute ceremony, even though they had intended to keep it secret.
Professor Hawking was seen to corner his new bride by some bushes with
his wheelchair before kissing her.
The new Mrs Hawking cradled his head and said: ''I love him very much
-- I am very happy. He's the coolest man I know.''
Professor Hawking arrived five minutes before the ceremony in a VW van
specially adapted for his wheelchair, while his bride followed
immediately behind in a separate car.
She was dressed in a long cream linen skirt, matching jacket and a
pillbox hat and veil and carried a bouquet of freesia, carnations and
roses. The groom wore a grey suit with a yellow freesia button-hole.
Registrar Adrian Wright said that Professor Hawking had pre-programmed
his wedding vows into his voice synthesizer.
''It was a lovely ceremony -- just like any other but with slightly
different logistics. It was a happy family affair,'' he said.
The bride's mother Mrs Muriel Lawson, from Devon, who was among the
six guests, said afterwards: ''I think it is wonderful.''
Professor Hawking's best man was Mr Robert Donovan, a friend from his
days as a doctorate student at Cambridge University.
His bride was among a team of 15 nurses hired by Professor Hawking's
former wife to attend on him in shifts 24-hours a day.
Her former husband, David, was the Cambridge-based engineer who
designed Professor Hawking's voice synthesizer.
The new Mrs Hawking has a teenage son and daughter and Professor
Hawking has a grown-up daughter and two sons. None of their children
were at yesterday's ceremony.

BRITAIN risks becoming a backwater of European technology if
scientists fail to seize the imagination of the public, according to the
incoming president of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science.
Speaking at the end of the week-long Science Festival, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh said there was far less public interest in science here than in
other countries.
''I think there is a danger that the concerns expressed by the
scientific community are perceived outside as perhaps a long, poorly
co-ordinated, and boring whinge,'' said Sir Ronald.
''Not only must there be public understanding of science, there must
an understanding of the public by scientists.
''Very often research scientists in particular are driven to what they
do by an inner compulsion, an enthusiasm which they sometimes forget
that 95% of the rest of the world does not share.''

THE SCOTTISH Arts Council unveiled its action plan yesterday to more
than 100 teachers and education experts at a conference in Edinburgh.
The council's newly-appointed senior education officer Sylvia Dow's
ideas included the Danish concept of a weekend showcase, where teachers
and educationalists could see a range of arts groups at work, take part
in practical workshops and discuss key issues in an informal setting.
She also outlined plans for joint training initiatives for artists and
educators, a research project at Stirling University on the quality of
work that Scotland's professional companies undertake in education, and
a possible major conference and publication focusing on the arts and
special needs.
Ms Dow said the SAC aimed to forge strong links between artists, arts
groups, schools, colleges and the education authorities.
She added: ''It is vital that in such a period of tremendous change as
we find education today -- for example with changes to the curriculum,
devolved school management and local government reorganisation -- we do
not lose sight of the value of the arts in education and of education in
the arts.''
SAC director Seona Reid said the council was now ready to move forward
with the practical implementation of its strategy published in 1993,
bringing coherence to the previous ''excellent, but unfocused activities
in education''.

RAIL unions yesterday called on an incoming Labour Government to take
steps to reverse the break-up and privatisation of British Rail.
The call, which will be repeated at next month's Labour Party
conference, comes against a background of union suspicion that Labour
might be softening its commitment to restore the rail industry to public
control.
Earlier this week, Aslef general secretary Lew Adams said his members
would regret that Labour leader Tony Blair, in his address to the TUC,
had stopped short of reaffirming last year's commitment to take all
parts of BR back into public ownership and control. Mr Blair replied by
declaring in a radio interview that ''no union, not even Aslef'' would
tell him what to do.

TRADE unionist Sam McCluskie, former leader of the National Union of
Seamen and treasurer of the Labour Party, died last night. He was 63.
A spokesman for the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport
Workers said he had ''a brave and prolonged battle against cancer''.
As leader of the NUS, he was involved in the 1966 national seamen's
strike.
Friend and former colleague Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT, said:
''The labour and trade union movement has lost one of its greatest
servants and I have lost a great personal friend.''
Mr McCluskie was born in Leith, and worked as a seaman from 1950.
He became an official of the NUS in 1964, and was general secretary
from 1986 to 1991, when his union merged with the National Union of
Railwaymen to form the RMT.
He told friends that travel as a young chef on the boats provided his
political education. South Africa put him off apartheid, Latin America
gave him a lifelong detestation of Fascism and a glimpse of the Eastern
bloc made him permanently distrustful of Communism.
First elected as a lay member of the NUS in 1963, he was appointed a
full-time official two years later and spent most of the next 13 years
working as a branch secretary in ports scattered around the UK.
At a posting in Hull, he formed a lasting political friendship with an
aspiring young liner steward named John Prescott, how deputy leader of
the Labour Party.

THE new chairman of the BMA Scottish Council warned yesterday of a
critical time in the National Health Service and ''a grave danger of
squeezing efficiency out of the system''.
Mr Arthur Morris, a consultant plastic surgeon in Dundee Teaching
Hospitals NHS Trust, said after his election that the health service was
now very vulnerable to the slightest crisis, such as a flu epidemic or
the illness of key staff.
Mr Morris said it could not be stated that NHS reforms were working
just because things were counted better.
The much-needed junior doctor hours of work reforms had coincided with
career restructuring in specialist training and both had vastly
increased consultant workloads at a time of increasing demographic
demand and with Patient Charter targets.
It was unfortunate that more and more consultants were taking the
route of an early retirement, exacerbating a chronic shortage.
Mr Morris said the move to more treatment in the primary care sector
was to be applauded, but to target bed closures ahead of providing
adequate facilities in the community meant that more and more patients
with difficult problems were being discharged prematurely.
The Health Service Ombudsman for Scotland, England, and Wales, Mr
William Reid, outlined to the BMA meeting the extension to his role the
Government proposes to introduce next year. New legislation will extend

the British Association festival in Newcastle
A ROYAL Marines officer saved 20,000 civilians from drowning at the
hands of Serbian dam-busters, it was revealed yesterday.
The unsung hero, Captain Mark Gray, 29, from Devon defied land mines
and booby traps to open a sluice gate on top of the Peruca dam in
Croatia shortly before the occupying Serbs detonated explosives deep
inside it.
His audacious feat two years ago has been unknown to the public until
described to the Science Festival yesterday by engineering Professor
Paul Pack from Oxford University.
He described how Serbian militia had expelled UN observers from the
65-metre-high dam in January, 1993, and set off huge explosives in a
maintenance gallery that ran the dam's length at foundation level.
''This was an attempt to use the 540 million cubic metres of stored
water as a weapon of mass destruction to the downstream land and
population,'' said Professor Pack.
''Some 20,000 people would have been drowned or rendered homeless had
the dam failed as intended.''
Severe damage was caused to three points in the dam corresponding to
where the saboteurs had placed their explosives. In the central section
alone it was estimated that 15 tons of explosive had been used.
At each of these three points the top of the dam -- made of rock fill
with a clay core -- sagged by two metres, said Professor Pack, who was a
member of a British team despatched by the Overseas Development
Administration to inspect it and advise on repairs after the Croatians
reoccupied it.
''During the tenure of the UN observers, but while the dam was in Serb
hands, the British major, who had trained as an engineer, had visited
the site and observed that the Serbs were holding the water level well
above the correct full supply level,'' he said.
''On his own initiative, and exceeding his authority, he opened the
surface spillway gate sufficiently to slowly reduce the water level. He
managed to lower the water level by some metres by the time the attempt
to destroy the dam took place.
''Had he not been able to reduce the level, there is no doubt that the
dam would have failed as water would have poured over the slumped crest
after the explosions.''
As it was, Professor Pack said it was only a miracle that the dam had
not failed. With gunfire echoing in the hills engineers had to race
against time before the ongoing erosion of the dam's clay core caused a
blow-through and total collapse.
Professor Pack said he learned later that the officer could have been
disciplined for exceeding his authority.
''I wrote to the Ministry of Defence and told him he should be given a
medal instead.''
Earlier, it was learned that drug experts have closed a loophole that
was enabling athletes to cheat with impunity.
Extensive research on natural levels of the hormone
dihydrotestosterone will allow sports authorities to make charges stick
against athletes who boost their levels artificially.
Dihydrotestosterone is a metabolite of the male hormone testosterone;
it occurs naturally in males and, to a lesser extent, in females, but in
both cases the levels vary from one individual to another.
Dr David Cowan, from the Drug Control Centre at King's College,
London, said: ''Thanks to extensive population testing we now have the
data setting out the parameters for its natural occurrence. This has
enabled us to set threshold levels beyond which we can say with
authority that the levels have been boosted artificially, and the
disciplinary bodies will have the data to back them up.''
The use of dihydrotestosterone came to prominence last year when
Chinese swimmers accused of using it were disqualified from the Asian
Games.
It binds to receptors in the muscle, giving added size and strength,
in the bones, boosting the manufacture of red blood cells, and in the
brain, where it arouses a more aggressive and competitive edge.
It can be obtained in the form of a fine powder, mixed with whisky,
and rubbed on to the chest, where it will penetrate the skin, said Dr
Cowan.
Although it does not produce acute toxic effects, long-term use can
lead to kidney and liver damage.
But higher levels, within the normal parameters, may be good news.
Tests on Greek army recruits, published recently in the Lancet, showed
that the higher the levels they had the more orgasms they achieved in
the course of a week.
Meanwhile, Dr Cowan and his colleagues have turned their attention to
other cheating agents which have proved difficult to detect, and hope to
crack them too.
In another medical breakthrough, saliva tests may soon be used to
determine when workers are over-stressed and need a break.
The tests will go under trial next year on business executives and
footballers.
Excessive stress can lower resistance to infection, said former
athlete Dr Lynn Fitzgerald, Reader in Sports Science at Brunel
University.
''Accountants are prone to herpes towards the end of the financial
year when they are struggling to get their books balanced,'' she said.
''Athletes are pushing themselves harder than ever before, and more
are suffering from illness -- colds, sore throats and flu, post-vital
fatigue syndrome, and chronic fatigue.
''Infections result in poor performance, with weeks or even months of
training lost.''
Although some stress was no bad thing, there was a well-established
link between psychological stress and immune competence, she added.
Cortisol, adrenalin, and neuropeptides are released during
psychological stress as well as during physical exercise.
''The effects on the immune system of the physical stresses of elite
athletes appear to be cumulative,'' said Dr Fitzgerald. ''Each
exhaustive training session or competition compromises the immune system
for a few hours, which provides an opportunity for infections to take
hold.''

A SURGEON who removed a woman's ''perfectly normal'' left ovary during
a hysterectomy, despite her insistence it should not be touched, was
found guilty yesterday of serious professional misconduct.
The General Medical Council's professional conduct committee ordered
that Dr Nathaniel Adu's name should be struck off the register.
Announcing the decision, committee chairman Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter said
the treatment given to Mrs Vanessa King undermined the trust patients
were entitled to place in their doctors.
Dr Adu unnecessarily removed both ovaries and when told Mrs King was
''about 50'' joked: ''She won't need these then, will she?''
Miss Linda Dobbs, barrister to the council, told its professional
conduct committee that Mrs King, of Thaxted Close, Luton, was in fact 42
when Dr Adu performed the operation.
Dr Adu, of Devonia Gardens, Edmonton, London, was asked to perform the
hysterectomy operation on Mrs King as well as investigate a suspected
cyst on her right ovary.
''Mrs King accepted the right ovary might have to be removed but was
adamant 'under no circumstances' should her left one be removed,'' said
Miss Dobbs.
The patient was concerned about the effect which a drug she was taking
could have on hormone replacement therapy and wrote on the consent form
for the operation ''left ovary not to be removed'' and initialled it.
The operation took place on June 9, 1993, at the Luton and Dunstable
Hospital.
Mrs King, who waived the right to anonymity while giving evidence,
said: ''I had a cold chill up my spine when I spoke to Dr Adu after the
operation because I knew something had gone wrong.
''I asked him if he was saying he had removed my left ovary and he
said 'Yes, but we'll put you on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) and
you'll be okay','' she added.
She was shocked and angry because she had been told that the drug she
had been taking for a benign breast condition could interfere with HRT.
Mrs King said she told Dr Adu she was going to make a formal complaint
about him and asked, ''Who gave you the right to play God?''
Dr Adu, who qualified in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1973, did not attend the
hearing. He had denied removing the ovary without permission.

THE widow of Dundee Lord Provost Tom McDonald last night vowed to
continue the work of her late husband after she won a resounding victory
in the by-election for his seat.
The Lord Provost, who died in June at the age of 43, had represented
the ward in the city for 21 years and was Dundee's youngest councillor
at the age of 22 when he was first elected in 1974.
Mrs Jill McDonald, 33, won the Lochee West seat on the new Dundee City
Council on Thursday and increased Labour's share of the poll following
her late husband's victory in the ward in April.
Last night, Mrs McDonald revealed that she had been asked to stand in
an election for the Labour Party nine years ago, but declined the offer
after Mr McDonald proposed to her.
She explained: ''In 1986, I had considered standing. The party had
approached me to stand in a very important council seat.
''That was the same year that Tom proposed to me. I decided that we
would get married and that one councillor in the family was enough.
Mrs McDonald sadly added: ''That's what we have now. But I think Tom
would be absolutely delighted, he always encouraged me in my politics
and my work in the Labour Party.''
Mr McDonald had been ill for several years before his death in June.
His funeral service in Dundee was attended by politicians and civic
leaders from throughout Scotland.
At the by-election for his council seat on Thursday, Mrs McDonald, a
teacher in Dundee, increased Labour's share of the poll by 10% to 72.8%
of the votes cast.
She described how the people of Lochee West had helped her cope with
her husband's death.
''I have had absolutely first-class support since Tom's death.I really
couldn't have gone through the last few months without the support of
the people of Lochee West.
''I was really overwhelmed by the warmth of the people on the doorstep
and the tributes that they paid to my late husband.''
The new councillor fought the by-election battle on the same 12
pledges that her husband had campaigned with in April.
* Election result: Jill McDonald (Labour) -- 993 votes; James Smith
(SNP) -- 245; Richard Cotter (Con) -- 96; Dominic Handley (Comm) -- 27.

<HEADLINE>As NHS is warned of 'critical times', staff adopt a new militancy Chemist fined for advising on drug prices and a good Samaritan is 'mugged'.</HEADLINE>

A CHEMIST who alerted customers when the price of medicines was lower
than the standard NHS prescription was yesterday fined #550 by a
disciplinary panel.
Mr Allan Sharpe vowed to appeal against the decision and said he would
continue his campaign against ''overpriced'' NHS prescription charges.
The panel's decision was widely criticised, and described by one MP as
''mugging the good Samaritan''.
The pharmacist has been advising patients to buy their medicines and
ointments privately whenever the cost was less than the standard #5.25
charge per item.
His stance was yesterday backed by health professionals, union
officials, and consumer bodies in Scotland. They threatened to raise the
issue publicly in Parliament and privately with Health Ministers.
Mr Sharpe, of Newbridge, Gwent, first appeared before Mid Glamorgan
family health services authority six weeks ago after complaints that he
was breaching his NHS contract. He received more than 1000 letters of
support from patients, GPs, and other pharmacists following nationwide
publicity about his case.
After learning his punishment yesterday, he said: ''I stand by what I
did and I intend to appeal. I hope the eventual outcome will give
pharmacists the freedom to deal fairly with patients, who should have
the right to prescriptions at a price they can afford.''
Mr Sharpe, who is being supported by the National Pharmaceutical
Association, claimed his stand against NHS prescription charges was
backed up by a recent survey that found more than 70% of the most
commonly prescribed drugs cost less than #5, with 30% costing under #1.
He said: ''I'm going to carry on pending my appeal to the Welsh
Office. My case is that there is nothing in my NHS contract which covers
what I am doing, so therefore I am not breaching that contract. The
outcome is precisely what I expected because the NHS was both judge and
jury. I shall fight on.''
Customers at Mr Sharpe's pharmacy supported his campaign. Mrs Mavis
Perkins, a widow who suffers from arthritis, said: ''He's doing a good
job and I think he should get on and be appreciated for what he's
doing.'' Mr Sharpe insists that the only financial benefit is to his
customers, who are now reported to have started a collection to pay his
fine.
Mr Alf Morris, MP for Wythenshawe, who was a junior Health Minister in
the last Labour Government, defended the chemist. ''It's really mugging
the good Samaritan,'' he said.
''It's putting rules above humanity. There's been an explosive
increase in prescription charges under the Tories. When the Government
came to power a prescription was 20p. Now it's #5.25. He has been acting
as a good Samaritan by helping low-income families.''
In Scotland, Dr Brian Potter, Scottish secretary of the BMA, would not
comment on Mr Sharpe's case, but said: ''In general terms we support the
view that medicines should be given to patients at a price they can
afford. The whole question needs to be looked at in depth.''
Mr Norrie McIntosh, regional officer of the Manufacturing, Science and
Finance Union -- which represents pharmacists -- criticised the landmark
decision.
He said many working-class people struggling to pay prescription costs
would be ''deeply upset and mystified'' by the disciplinary panel's
decision.
Mrs Deirdre Hutton, chairwoman of the National Consumer Council in
Scotland, backed the principle of chemists giving advice on the cheapest
drugs available and said the issue was one of consumer choice.
She said: ''From the consumer's point of view, I find it hard to see
what justification there is in not letting the pharmacist give this
advice. Who else is the consumer expected to get good advice from?''
Mr Tom Kirkwood, Scottish information officer for the Patients
Association, said he received dozens of complaints a year about the
price difference between prescriptions and over-the-counter drugs. But
he said those who officially reported their concerns were just the tip
of the iceberg.

<TEXT>
THE Clydebuilt liner QE2 was hit by a 95ft-high wave in mid-Atlantic
as she sailed at four knots through the tail of Hurricane Luis, it was
disclosed yesterday.
The wave hit the ship bow on -- the crest reaching bridge level.
Captain Ronald Warwick, 54, said: ''It looked as if we were going
straight into the white cliffs of Dover . . . real white-knuckle stuff.
It was the biggest I have seen in 38 years at sea.''
The liner was carrying 1200 passengers including TV magician Paul
Daniels and his wife Debbie McGee, and Coronation Street actor Johnny
Briggs with his family, when the wave struck.
Most of the passengers -- who paid #900 for the cruise -- were asleep.
Captain Warwick had ordered people to stay below decks as the ship
plunged though massive seas.
The huge wall of water was spotted early last Monday as the ship
travelled at four knots off Newfoundland on her way to New York.
The captain and crew knew how high the water reached because the
bridge of the 25-year-old ship is 95ft above the waterline. Captain
Warwick and the watch on duty ducked as the wave broke over the bows,
damaging rails.
Minor repairs were carried out when the liner arrived in New York
eight hours behind schedule.
The ship is expected back in Southampton next Tuesday.

NOVELIST P D James threatened to resign from the Crime Writers'
Association in a row over class, morality and political correctness.
The author of Devices and Desires and other novels featuring police
chief Adam Dalgliesh has been stung by fellow members' accusations that
she dismissed working class crime as uninteresting and without moral
dilemmas.
The row started when James, 74, a baroness, justified the middle-class
milieu of her books in a BBC World Service interview.
She reportedly said: ''In the pits of the inner city area, where crime
is the norm and murder is commonplace, you don't get moral choice, you
don't get contrasts between good and evil.''
There followed a bitter three-month row in the CWA's private journal
Red Herrings.
In one exchange of letters, James, who holds the CWA's Diamond Dagger
for a lifetime contribution to the genre, made veiled threats to resign.
She only wanted to be a member if the CWA remained ''non-sectarian and
non-political'', she said.
Author Mark Timlin's stories of hero Nick Sharman, a drug-taking
university drop-out investigating south London crimes, are about to be
televised following a successful pilot film starring Clive Owen.
Timlin said many would find James's reported comments offensive.
''Everybody makes moral choices every time they get up,'' he said,
citing a friend on the dole offered work ''off the book''.
He said: ''He made the choice not to cheat the DSS, and he's going to
suffer because he's skint.''
CWA chairman Peter Walker said of the row: ''Debate is always very
welcome and interesting, but it has been fanned into something totally
out of proportion.
''I am very concerned that one of our most esteemed members has been
seen to be personally attacked.''
He claimed P D James had made no move to resign, but expressed herself
''unhappy'' with the way the CWA had changed.

A FORMER Army doctor who died after his car crashed into a lorry was
being investigated by police over allegations made by patients, a health
board said yesterday.
Dr Andrew Waring, 44, a Gulf war veteran, was critically injured when
his Fiat Cinquecento ran into the back of an articulated lorry parked in
a lay-by in the early hours of Thursday. He died in hospital later that
night.
The lorry driver was not injured in the crash on the A89 near
Newbridge, Edinburgh. A report on the collision has been sent to the
procurator fiscal.
Dr Waring, of Pitconnochie Farm Road, Crossford, near Dunfermline, who
had two daughters and a son, had been absent from his one-man practice
since last week.
A spokeswoman for Fife Health Board said the board was asked to
provide a locum for the surgery at High Valleyfield, near Dunfermline,
last Friday.
''There were complaints made to the local police,'' she said. ''I was
aware police were investigating allegations by patients of the doctor. I
do not know what they were.''
She added: ''We were aware Dr Waring was unable to cover his practice.
We had arranged locum cover over the last week and that will be
continued.''
The spokeswoman went on: ''We were told police had been to the
practice last Friday and that is when he went off work.''
Fife Police refused to comment, and receptionists at the surgery,
where Dr Waring had been based since 1989, said: ''We have nothing to
say.''
Dr Waring served with the Royal Army Medical Corps for 16 years.
During a two-year stint in Ulster, he survived a terrorist attack when a
medical centre was blown up.
He left the Army in 1989, but was called up to serve in the Gulf war
the following year.

SIAMESE twins Chloe and Nicole Astbury got their first cuddle from
their mother yesterday as doctors breathed a sigh of relief at their
successful birth.
Melanie Astbury, 25, missed out on her wish of seeing the twins born
after medical staff had to give her a general anaesthetic for the birth
at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester.
As the babies were taken to a special neo-natal care unit to be
examined by surgeons, Mrs Astbury could only look at a photograph of
them taken soon after their birth.
However, later yesterday, after doctors said they were satisfied with
the twins' progress, she was allowed to hold them.
Her husband Brian, 26, an electrician from Denton, Manchester, watched
the birth by caesarean section and said: ''They're beautiful.''
Dozens of messages of congratulations and flowers from family, friends
and strangers flooded into the hospital after news of the birth, which
doctors said was ''relatively straightforward''.
The two dark-haired girls, who weighed a combined 12lb 9oz, were last
night said to be ''comfortable, well and rested'' and their mother was
making a normal recovery from the operation at 11.09pm on Thursday.
The twins will now undergo an exhaustive series of scans and tests to
discover the extent of the abnormality that joins them. They are known
to share a liver. But the consultant paediatric surgeon looking after
them, Mr Alan Dickson, said he would investigate the likelihood that
they could also have a joined bowel and possibly other abdominal organs.
It is likely to be up to a year before an operation is carried out to
separate the girls, who are joined at the trunk but can move their heads
without difficulty.
Mr Dickson said yesterday: ''We genuinely feel optimistic about their
chances of survival.''
The twins were born earlier than the medical team had planned after
Mrs Astbury started to have intermittent contractions on Thursday.
Dr Michael Maresh, the consultant obstetrician who headed the team
which delivered them, said: ''I was delighted. They are a very
attractive pair of girls and delivered in good condition.''
The twins could remain in St Mary's until their operation, which will
be performed only after detailed tests have been completed and advice
taken from experts in different fields of medicine.
However, the medical team at St Mary's has said the girls have a
better chance than other Siamese twins because they have their own
hearts and lungs and other vital organs.
One of the girls had some difficulty in breathing for a short time
after they were both resuscitated after the birth, but Mr Dickson said
this had caused no problems.
Just before the birth, Mr Astbury said: ''We are having two babies who
are going to get all the love and attention in the world. We will face
the hurdles when and if they arise.''
The couple's solicitor, Ms Andrea McWatt, said: ''They have smiled all
the way through and have seemed quietly confident that whatever problems
they may face they will able to deal with.''
The Astburys have sold their story to a national newspaper for a sum
known to be at least #50,000.
The girls were the fifth pregnancy involving Siamese twins seen by St
Mary's in the past five years. Two couples decided to terminate their
pregnancies and two others -- both from abroad -- were delivered but
subsequently died.

TRAVELLERS suffered the west coast blues yesterday, with both road and
rail disrupted in a situation liable to continue this weekend.
AA Roadwatch reported major delays on the A74 at Elvanfoot, on the
Beattock summit. Strathclyde police said the tailbacks reached 10 miles
in one direction and seven miles in the other.
Meanwhile, a major power failure brought chaos to main line train
services between London Euston and Glasgow.
Delays of up to three hours were reported while Railtrack investigated
the failure, in the Rugby area, and trains were diverted via
Northampton, in an effort to minimise the disruption to timetables. Rail
travellers were advised last night to check today before travelling.

THE war of words raged on last night over calls by the leader of
Britain's hospital trusts for people to pay for hospital treatment.
Mr Rodney Walker, outgoing chairman of the NHS Trust Federation,
sparked the row when he called on people to take out medical insurance
to ensure the service could continue to meet the needs of the most
vulnerable.
Rising costs in the National Health Service meant this would be
necessary to ensure help was available for the elderly, chronically
sick, and in emergencies.
But his vision of a ''safety-net'' service in the next century was
almost universally condemned yesterday as junior Health Minister Tom
Sackville accused Mr Walker of being ''overly pessimistic'' and stressed
the proposals were not Government policy.
However, Shadow Health Secretary Margaret Beckett claimed Mr Walker
had ''blown the gaff on the Government's long-term plans for the NHS''.
She said: ''Mr Walker declares his belief in the health service, but
describes a service that caters mainly for the poor and weak, with
private insurance for everyone else. This is not our National Health
Service. It is the two-tier service they have in the US.''
Some of the strongest criticism came from health managers, who accused
Mr Walker of ''running up the white flag'' on the NHS.
Mr Philip Hunt, director of the National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts, said Mr Walker held a minority view.
Although Mr Walker claimed the NHS was better placed than any other
health care system to meet the challenges of an ageing population, and
new technology, he admitted that potentially massive pressures were
building up.

MR JOHN Major is planning a new round of meetings with leaders of the
constitutional parties in Ulster in a bid to break the deadlock over the
peace process.
The Prime Minister is to have his first formal meeting at Downing
Street on Tuesday with the Ulster Unionist Party's new leader, Mr David
Trimble.
Officials at No. 10 are also trying to fix an early meeting with Mr
John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist SDLP and a key player in
brokering the IRA ceasefire a year ago.
Government sources said Mr Major had agreed in addition to a request
for talks by hardline Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley, but this
may not take place next week for diary reasons.
Mr Major will see Irish Premier John Bruton next weekend, at the EU
summit in Mallorca, for the first time since Dublin pulled out of the
UK-Irish talks scheduled to have taken place at Chequers nine days ago.
But Downing Street aides were playing down the significance of the
occasion and the opportunity for meaningful discussion.
The UK-Irish summit was put back at Irish insistence after a
last-minute change of mind in Dublin over proposals for an independent
commission to oversee the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.
British officials privately accused the Irish of bowing to pressure
from Sinn Fein in the wake of an IRA statement refusing to give up a
single weapon.
But they were taking comfort from the fact that Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams was reported to be coming under intense pressure during his visit
to the United States to agree to co-operate in the setting up of the
commission.

A PUBLIC campaign to shame chief executives of ''rogue'' Scottish
hospital trusts into coming up with no-strings-attached pay offers will
be launched next week by the country's biggest nursing union.
It follows the realisation that Scots nurses are being offered
substantially poorer pay deals than their colleagues in England, the
leader of the Royal College of Nursing said yesterday.
Nationally 62% of trusts, more than 300, have met the RCN target and
offered a 3% increase without conditions.
In Scotland, only 15 out of 47 trusts have offered no-strings deals
and, in the majority of cases, trusts have attached conditions to their
offers.
The Scottish position blots the otherwise widespread success of the
RCN's campaign on wages.
Speaking at a conference in Glasgow yesterday, Miss Christine Hancock,
general secretary of the RCN, said the names of Scottish trusts which
have failed to match the minimum would be made public in an attempt to
shame chief executives into increasing their offers.
''We have got to work very hard to get the strings removed in Scotland
and that's why our next stage is going to be focusing on what we are
calling the rogue trusts.''
Miss Hancock said the strings attached to pay offers nationally
varied, but often centred on loss of holidays or conditions. ''Some are
outrageous, like halving your sick pay. Others are on holiday
entitlement.''
''We are happy to negotiate separately on some of these things, but we
are not willing to accept the position where nurse get 3% only if they
agree to them.''
English trusts may have fallen into line more rapidly because there is
a shortage of nurses down south, she added. ''In Scotland, trusts may
assume that they don't have a shortage of nurses so they can hold out.''
Miss Hancock said that the consequences of failing to implement
universal rises without conditions could be damaging. ''Ultimately, if
trusts don't pay people properly then a number will move and those that
can't will become demoralised.
''Trusts won't lose staff just because of money, but pay rises signify
how nurses are valued. People are very, very angry. They feel really
angry that their managers are not valuing them as highly as other
people.''
The RCN, in common with the other main nursing unions, is against the
Government fostered move towards local pay bargaining. However, it
pulled away from the threat of industrial action.
Instead the union announced it would defeat the concept by getting 300
trusts to accept a minimum 3% deal which it claims would effectively be
a national agreement. That target was reached on Wednesday.

CLAIMS that the newly announced tolls for the Skye Bridge will
represent significant savings on ferry fares were challenged last night.
Skye Bridge Ltd announced yesterday that, when the bridge opens next
month, the toll for a passenger car will be #4.30, compared to the ferry
fare of #5.40. Frequent users will be able to buy books of tickets,
working out at #2.44. Between May 1 and September 30, tolls will rise to
#5.20.
Chairman of the Skye Bridge company, Sir Iain Noble, said last night:
''For most users of the crossing the bridge tariffs will represent a
significant saving on the current ferry fare.
''The key benefit to bridge users, however, will be a convenient
reliable and accessible route to and from the Isle of Skye.
''Once the concession has ended and the bridge is paid for, the people
of the area will have a toll-free bridge.''
However, Mr Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal
Group, disputed that the tolls were good news for islanders.
She said: ''One group which is particularly badly hit are those
driving small commercial vehicles. They get over on the ferry paying the
same as cars but here you see they are going to have to pay #9.80 in
high and low season. Even with discount tickets they will still have to
pay #9.51. That is not exactly going to help small businesses
flourish.''
Mrs MacRae said it should be remembered the ferry dropped its fares
significantly in the winter, adding: ''But that isn't the point. The
point is the people of Skye are going to have to be paying the highest
tolls in Europe for a bridge that was imposed upon them.
''The people on the privately financed Dartford Bridge are only paying
90p although, at #86m, it cost more than three times what this bridge
cost.''
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye,
commented: ''This largely cosmetic package, slipped out in
characteristically cowardly fashion on a Friday afternoon, will do
little to persuade anyone locally away from the overwhleming sense of
injustice about the imposition of these Skye-high tolls and will do
absolutely nothing to promote the vital tourist trade.''
Under the tolls, HGV Class 1 vehicles must pay #12.70 all year, with
#12.20 at discount. HGV2 vehicles will pay #25.40 and #24.61 at
discount.
A minibus will cost #21.50 in high season and #14.30 in low season. A
coach will cost #37.50 in high season and #25.40 low. A motorcycle will
cost #2.60 high, #2.10 low, and #1.21 discount.

<HEADLINE>SNP-held council opposes pre-school voucher plan</HEADLINE>

AN SNP-controlled council has become the first in Scotland to decide
against bidding for the forerunner to the Government's controversial
pre-school voucher scheme.
The Scottish Office will invite bids from local authorities to run a
pilot voucher scheme for 1996-7, after which the initiative will be
introduced throughout Scotland.
It envisages local authorities, private nurseries, and the voluntary
playgroup sector competing for vouchers worth #1100, which the parents
of mainly four-year-olds will use to ''buy'' pre-schooling for their
children.
However, councillors on the policy and resources committee of Perth
and Kinross shadow council, which comes into force next year, agreed by
15 votes to three to have nothing to do with the pilot.
Councillor Janet Law, SNP convener of the council's education
committee, said vouchers were ill-conceived, potentially divisive,
unworkable, and objectionable.
The Scottish Labour Party last night also called for the Government to
abandon the pre-school voucher scheme.
The party's spokeswoman on Scottish education, Mrs Maria Fyfe, said:
''The scheme for testing out nursery vouchers is flawed. They must
guarantee that local authorities are being asked to participate in true
pilot projects, with built-in monitoring and evaluation, and procedures
for reporting back findings to the authorities involved.''
Councillor Law said: ''We are not going to be involved in the pilot
scheme. We do not believe it would benefit parents and children. The
concept of a free market is detrimental to the provision of nursery
education.
''Vouchers introduce competition and do not guarantee access. The
right to a voucher is not the same as the right to a nursery place.''
The council will write to other authorities in the hope they will
adopt a similar stance.
Its decision was welcomed by Mrs Judith Gillespie, convener of the
Scottish Parent Teacher Council. She said: ''It has shown great wisdom.
Parents want local authority provision. They want the money to go to
local authorities to provide places. Vouchers are tortuous to
administer. They are not what parents want.''
In 1997, the Government plans to send vouchers through the post to
parents of eligible children. They would exchange the vouchers for
places at an establishment of their choice.
It believes #1100 is enough to meet the cost of three terms of
high-quality pre-schooling. It expects the value of the voucher to
''buy'' a part-time place in a nursery and up to a full-time place in a
playgroup with suitable educational input.
Parents would be able to top up the value if they used the voucher in
the private or voluntary sector but local authorities would not be able
to charge more than #1100. The nursery or playgroup would accept
vouchers and redeem them for cash.
About 64,000 children a year are likely to be eligible.

<HEADLINE>Fish industry gets caught in voting row</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish fishing industry was thrown into turmoil yesterday by a
split in one of its most powerful catchers' organisations.
Nine directors of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association
(SWFPA), including the chairman and vice-chairman, resigned to spearhead
a breakaway organisation, the Fishermen's Association Ltd, which will
fight for total withdrawal from the European Union Common Fisheries
Policy (CFP).
Aberdeen solicitor Roddy McColl, who for 23 years has represented the
SWFPA, also resigned on behalf of his company Iain Smith and Co. It is
expected that next week he will become secretary to the new
organisation.
The split became inevitable when, two weeks ago, the SWFPA voted by
18-14 to remain within the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF), an
umbrella organisation which will now have a direct rival in the new
association.
For almost two years, there has been discontent within the SWFPA at
the SFF's refusal to back the Save Britain's Fish Campaign, which is
urging Britain's withdrawal from the CFP. The SFF believe it is not
feasible to withdraw and that the sensible course of action is to work
towards change.
After resigning from the board and leaving the meeting of the SWFPA in
Banff yesterday, chairman Tom Hay said: ''I have resigned because at the
last meeting the very basic and elementary principles of democracy were
undermined when directors of two branches voted against the wishes of
their membership.''
Mr Hay said that a poll had been carried out and, of the 126 skippers
in the Fraserburgh branch, 77 had voted against remaining in the SFF, 10
voted for, there were two spoiled papers, and 37 did not vote.
''There was an overwhelming vote by the fishermen to leave the SFF but
five out of the six Fraserburgh directors voted in favour of remaining
in the SFF,'' he said.
Mr Hay, who has been appointed chairman of the new association, said
it was a similar story in Buckie, with 15 votes in favour of coming out
of the SFF and 11 for staying in, but two of the Buckie directors voted
for remaining in the SFF.
''If the directors had voted in accordance with the wishes of their
membership, the vote would have been 21-11 in favour of leaving the
SFF.''
Pledging his support for the Fishermen's Association Ltd, Mr Hay said
it was for all types of fishermen in all sizes of vessels.
''No matter what some people may say, it will not be a single issue
organisation, but will truly represent the will of its members in every
area of concern.''
''This means such issues as the interaction between the oil and
fishing industries; consultation with the Department of Transport to try
to minimise the impact of new fishing vessel safety regulations;
Norwegian sector operations; inshore fisheries management; the growing
pressure from environmental organisations; and, of course, the Common
Fisheries Policy with all its ramifications.''
The new chairman of the SWFPA, Mr Alex Smith, of Arbroath, said:
''This is the tragic outcome of a bitter conflict within the
association.''
He added, however, that there was no question of the SWFPA collapsing
as a result of the breakaway.
The chief executive of the SFF, Mr Bob Allan, said last night that
while the most important thing for the industry at the moment should be
unity, the SFF would now get on to address the issues in front of them.
There had been irreconcilable differences recently because the SFF was
opposed to withdrawal from the CFP and it would take some time to
evaluate what would happen as a result of the split.

<HEADLINE>Father finds murdered girl's body. Teenager stabbed to death</HEADLINE>

The body of a murdered teenager was discovered by her father and her
best friend from school, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Brian Smith, 45, ran shouting from the scene to fetch his wife,
while the friend, Emma Jones, ran behind, crying in the street.
Mr Smith, not realising his daughter Naomi was dead, grabbed a blanket
from the house and rushed back to the scene to keep her body warm until
paramedics arrived.
Her mother, Catherine, 47, broke down at a news conference as she
recounted the discovery and vented her grief and anger over the death of
her 15-year-old daughter, who had been repeatedly stabbed.
Asked what she would like to see done to the killer, she said: ''A
life for a life. I would like to see him get life imprisonment at least
-- without any parole.''
Her daughter's body was found just 100 yards from the family home, at
a children's playground known as The Rec.
She had left the house on Bretts Hall Estate, Ansley Common, Nuneaton,
Warwickshire, at 9.45pm on Thursday to post a letter at a post box
nearby for her mother.
Mrs Smith said the last time she had seen her ginger-haired daughter
was as she left the house to carry out the errand. ''After that no-one
knows what happened to her.''
Mrs Smith said she later set out, scouring the streets for her missing
daughter, while her husband called at Emma's house. The friend demanded
she be allowed to accompany Mr Smith in his search.
Mrs Smith said: ''I had gone all the way down the estate and all the
way back with a neighbour. We brought Emma back with us as she was
supposed to be staying at our house.
''Then we realised about The Rec, so Emma and my husband went up there
and there was my daughter.''
Mr Smith said his daughter had no enemies he knew of. She was a Take
That fan who loved playing her records and had recently begun attending
a local brass band.
Naomi was the youngest child of Mr and Mrs Smith, who are both taxi
drivers. There are two older brothers, Andrew and David, and one
half-brother, Clayton.
Detective Sergeant Tony Bayliss told the news conference he was sure
Naomi had been killed where her body was found, probably just an hour
before she was discovered.
Despite attempts by paramedics who arrived on the scene to resuscitate
the girl, there were no signs of life.
Mr Bayliss said the father and friends have travelled around the
streets in his car and went to the car park of the recreation ground and
shone the car headlights on to the children's play area.
That was the moment they discovered Naomi's body, lying under a
climbing frame in the field.
He said: ''Emma Jones is deeply distressed, as you can imagine. Emma
is now with officers from our specialist child protection unit.''
Mrs Smith said she believed whoever had stabbed and sexually assaulted
her child was ''an evil person''.
Mr Bayliss would not confirm if Naomi had been raped but said she had
been sexually assaulted and suffered ''a very severe attack'', in which
''violent force was used''.
Naomi was known to have visited the playground with other local
children. The officer said the teenager had been spotted by neighbours
standing close to the entrance to the park earlier that evening.
He said the teenager had boyfriends in the past but did not think she
was going out with a boy at the time of her death.
A murder weapon has still not been found and police would say only
that they believe it was a sharp implement used to inflict a number of
vicious stab wounds.
Police are trying to trace a red Ford Escort car which was seen on the
estate between 9-11pm on Thursday night. They were appealing for anybody
who saw Naomi or the car near the scene to come forward.
At the girl's school, Hartshill, many of the 700 pupils left morning
assembly in tears after the news was revealed.
Headmaster Ian Hecks said police officers arrived at the school gates
at 8.30am and asked for all the children to be assembled in the main
hall. After being told of Naomi's death, they were asked to give police
any assistance they could.
Referring to Emma Jones, he said: ''Naomi and her friend were always
together at school. They did the same things and were inseparable. I
would describe them as the closest of best friends almost to the
exclusion of anyone else.''
He added: ''I have been advising pupils not to go out on their own at
night unless they are with friends and to make sure mum and dad know
where they are.
''She had only gone around the corner to post a letter for her mum and
this happened. There is a lunatic out there who needs to be caught. I
know some of the pupils are frightened and so am I.''

TWO firefighters were hurt bringing a blaze under control near
Blackpool's Golden Mile last night.
Around 75 firefighters tackled the fire which started at an indoor
market and spread to neighbouring buildings and streets. Many buildings
later had to be demolished.
The fire began at Foxhall Market, an indoor shopping centre on Foxhall
Road, near the central promenade.
There were reports of an explosion as the fire broke out. Several two
and three-storey shops and flats in the narrow side streets were quickly
engulfed by flames.
Fifteen fire appliances attended the fire in an area known as Foxhall
Village.
The two injured firefighters suffered burns.
A Lancashire Fire Brigade spokesman said: ''This was a very major
incident.''

<HEADLINE>Glasgow Airport looks in line for #27m direct railway link</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976355633</RECORDNO>

DETAILED plans for a #27m direct rail link to Glasgow Airport are
likely to be drawn up next year.
Strathclyde Regional Council said a planning application was likely to
be made after the new local authority is in place next year.
''The plans would then be put out for the public consultation
process,'' a spokesman told The Herald.
The scheme, which will link the airport with Paisley St James station
on the existing Glasgow Central to Greenock and Wemyss Bay line, has the
backing of BAA Ltd, the company behind the airport; Railtrack; ScotRail;
Renfrewshire Enterprise; and the Glasgow Development Agency.
Concern, however, has been expressed by Renfrew District Council over
the proposal, which crosses a vital recreation area at St James.
Mr Douglas Ferguson, strategic development manager for the PTE, said
the new line could be linked to a second project, Crossrail, which aims
to electrify an existing freight line, running from West Street across
the Gorbals.
If both schemes are implemented, they will link the Glasgow suburban
rail network and beyond with the airport. The St James option would also
open up access from the south of Glasgow, providing an interchange
facility at Paisley Gilmour Street.
Mr Ferguson said the Royal Bank of Scotland was among a team of
consultants engaged to gauge the likely level of private funding for the
project.
He said the Paisley St James mile-long link had emerged as the
favoured option in the five years since the idea of a station at the
airport had first been raised.
''Increasingly these airports are seeing a good transport link as an
important asset. Glasgow Airport has seen what has happened at
Prestwick,'' he said.
''When linked with Crossrail, Glasgow Airport would be accessed easily
by rail, not only from north and west of the city, but also from other
parts of Scotland, including Edinburgh and Aberdeen.
''The airport is fully supportive of the scheme and has stated it
would be willing to pay for an element of it, including the costs of the
station itself.''
Mr Ferguson said it was hoped a partnership of private and public
funding would pay for the project, but estimated the new link would not
be open until the year 2000.
He admitted the proposed privatisation of Railtrack and ScotRail could
throw a spanner in the works. ''It is potentially another obstacle,'' he
said.
However, a spokeswoman for Railtrack Scotland said the company was
very keen on network development. ''This proposal represents a
substantial example of that,'' she said.
BAA's head of planning and international marketing, Mr Ian McMahon,
said while the company welcomed the scheme, it was essential other
transport links to the airport were also maintained. ''The rail link
cannot be seen as a substitute for improving road links,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Rifkind warns on peace deal. Serbs fire missiles as siege guns pull back</HEADLINE>

THE Bosnia peace deal was taking effect yesterday, but only just.
The Serbs started withdrawing their heavy weapons from Sarajevo's
surrounding hills, and allowed the city's airport to be reopened, but
fired missiles at Nato planes over the safe haven, Gorazde.
The two missiles, launched at reconnaissance jets, missed but provoked
a strongly-worded protest from the UN.
A Nato spokesman said they were ''likely to be SA-7s or
shoulder-launched missiles. The aircraft were not hit and both returned
safely.''
There was no return fire.
A shoulder-fired SA-7 missile is believed to have been used to shoot
down a French Mirage 2000 over Pale on the first day of the Nato air
campaign. The Serbs' fixed air defence systems have been largely
destroyed in the blitz, but the portable SA-7 still poses a serious
threat.
French Defence Minister Charles Millon said yesterday the two Mirage
pilots were safe and sound. They were presumed to be in Serb hands, but
Mr Millon said: ''For security reasons, I can't say more.
In the light of the missile attack yesterday, there was a timely
warning from Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind. He cautioned that the
peace agreement brokered by the US remained fragile and could collapse
within days. He warned that Nato air strikes would resume tomorrow night
if the Bosnian Serbs failed to honour the deal.
Mr Rifkind, who leaves tomorrow for a three-day visit to Serbia,
Croatia and Sarajevo, said: ''We are very conscious of the fact that a
signature on a piece of paper is not in itself a bankable bit of proof.
It is what happens on the ground that matters.''
On BBC Radio 4's the World at One, he said the success of the
agreement depended on the removal of Serb weapons from the 12[1/2]-mile
exclusion zone around Sarajevo. So far there had been only a partial
withdrawal.
His warning was reinforced by Nato's southern commander, Admiral
Leighton Smith, who told Bosnian Serbs to move the guns or face the
threat of renewed air strikes. He will decide with UN commander General
Bernard Janvier tomorrow night if there has been enough progress to
extend a pause in air strikes.
There was also a welcome and a warning from US President Bill Clinton.
''Let me emphasise that if the Bosnian Serbs do not comply with their
commitments, the air strikes will resume.''
He said that the strikes had been intended to ''prevent further
slaughter of innocent civilians in Sarajevo and other safe areas in
Bosnia''. The Serbian agreement is ''a direct result of Nato's
steadfastness in protecting the safe areas and the close co-operation
between the UN and Nato.''
He added that the Bosnian Serbs ''must now carry out their commitments
and then turn their energies towards a political settlement that will
end this terrible conflict for good.''
The Americans can claim most of the credit for the progress in pushing
the Bosnian war towards a settlement, by insisting on the Nato air
offensive and finally over-riding British and French hesitations.
It was also US assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke who
obtained Bosnian Serb agreement to lift the siege of Sarajevo in
exchange, partially, for a halt to Nato bombings.
On Wednesday Bosnian Serb political and military leaders agreed to
withdraw their weapons and open roads to the Bosnian capital within six
days. They also agreed to the reopening of the airport, which has been
closed since April.
Yesterday afternoon a French Hercules, under Nato air cover, brought a
load of flour and the French Defence Minister to the city. Meanwhile, a
UN relief convoy was allowed in from Kiseljak through Serb territory.
Mr Rifkind said American involvement, the intervention of Serbian
president Slobodan Milosevic, and Nato's ''robust'' approach had
contributed to the settlement.
He agreed that the Bosnian Serbs retained the capability ''to do
mischief'', and predicted that the prospects for Bosnia if the peace
process failed were ''bleak, bad and terrible''. But he believed
pressure for peace within Bosnia was irresistible.
With the mainly-Muslim Bosnian government indicating grave
reservations about the accord -- notably over the amount and type of
weapons the Serbs must remove -- Mr Rifkind warned they should not try
to take military advantage of the damage the Nato air strikes have
inflicted on the Serbs.
''They must not seek to capitalise on any withdrawal by the Bosnian
Serbs in an unacceptable way or otherwise you will simply get a return
to the status quo and that will not please anyone,'' he said.
Meanwhile, senior officials and mediators from the five-power Contact
Group on the former Yugoslavia, Britain, the United States, Russia,
France and Germany, met to try to map out the next steps in an overall
peace settlement in the coming weeks.
The talks took place at the Russian mission to the United Nations in
Geneva, and after the meeting Russia's first deputy Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said key figures, including Mr Holbrooke, would be heading
back to the former Yugoslavia this weekend to pursue the drive.
Mr Holbrooke warned there was still a long way to go before an accord
creating a new-shape Bosnia could be concluded.
''We are exploring views, looking for common ground between Belgrade
and Sarajevo. This is difficult and I will not reveal details,'' he
added just before the meeting.
