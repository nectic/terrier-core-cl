Ian Walls discovers some prizewinning secrets.
I RECENTLY spent a fascinating day with real gardening experts. Not, I
hasten to add, the folk who endeavour to tell us what to do on radio or
TV but at the judging of the annual FloralFest Container Competition
covering Port Glasgow, Greenock, Gourock, Inverkip and Wemyss Bay.
The event was started off seven years go by Ken Thomson, editor of the
Greenock Telegraph, and is now sponsored by Eric Gallagher of Cardwell
Nursery and Garden Centre in Gourock.
George Dunne from Glenside Road, Port Glasgow, won FloralFest for the
second time. His prize-winning display of containerised plants is
breathtaking and the whole garden is a mass of colour and fragrance.
George's pride and joy are his standard fuchsias which are among the
finest to be found anywhere. The Dunne greenhouse is packed with plants,
many of which he brings on from seed. In fact, he reckons he will have
to find space now for a second greenhouse.
His recipe for success -- Vitax Vitafeed 412 for young plants in the
greenhouse, and then a mixture of Miracle-Gro and Tomorite on a weekly
basis once they are planted out.
Gerard Harkins, who lives in Columba Street, Greenock, took early
retirement from his job as a quality analyst with IBM three years ago,
and spent some of his retirement money on a greenhouse. He finished a
close second in the competition, and said the new greenhouse was behind
his success.
''I enjoy bringing on things from seed,'' he said. ''The greenhouse
allows me to do this, and I get a lot of pleasure in propagating and
nursing plants.''
Gerard uses Miracle-Gro and Phostrogen to bring on his containerised
plants. He uses them full strength once a week and then twice on reduced
strength the following week.
Fred and Jean Ball are known as regular prizewinners in FloralFest and
are current holders of the trophy, but the fierce competition forced
them into third place this year.
Fred brings on most of his plants from seeds or plantlets. He said:
''It's almost a full-time job. I give my plants three feeds --
Miracle-Gro, Tomorite and Seaweed Extract. During the very hot weather,
I have been watering the plants every three hours. You really have to
watch with containers because they dry out very quickly.''
Ian and Joyce McLellan of King Street, Gourock, also did well in the
competition. They spend a lot of time caring for their mass of hanging
baskets, window boxes, tubs and even chimney pots.
Each evening Ian tends to his containers. Joyce usually manages to
give a helping hand, if she is not tending to the roses in her part of
the garden. Ian feeds his plants once a week with Miracle-Gro and
Phostrogen, and the results are spectacular.
So much for the experts, then.
For the rest of us, it's fascinating growing plants from seeds. You
pop in a tiny seed, it germinates, and hey presto, you end up with a
plant. The seed is in fact asleep, and we are trying to wake it up. Each
seed has a built-in set of conditions, to encourage it to germinate or
start to grow. Fulfil the conditions, or you get failure.
You also get failure if the seed is not full of life. It may not
always be new seed, but it has come through a test procedure. The snag
is that these test conditions may have optimal temperature, moisture and
air needs. When you consider the number of variables involved for a
gardener, you can see why things sometimes go wrong.
Drying out seed after germination means it is killed. Temperature is
also important, most seeds will germinate at between 60 and 70F.
Light or darkness also has a part to play, particularly for the fine
seed that is sown on the surface of compost. The answer is to look at
the packet and see what it says.
It is vital to make sure that air is available to the seed. It helps
to improve what is called the air-filled porosity of compost by adding
some Perlite. If you use soggy, inert compost you are in trouble from
the outset.
While spring and early summer is the time to sow most seeds, there are
lots which can be sown now. They include coleus, schizanthus (poor man's
orchid), cyclamen, aralias, asparagus ferns, calceolarias and a host of
pot plants, herbaceous perennials and shrubs.
And in case it has slipped your notice, it is Flower Show time again.
Ayr Flower Show is on this weekend, as is Glasgow's Penjing Day -- mini
gardens or landscapes -- at the Botanic Gardens.

WHEN Lynn Seymour comes to the Edinburgh Festival next week, her
contribution will be a step into the unknown. She is doing two workshops
at the Fringe Club (as part of a series of masterclasses), coaching
actors in movement. As yet, she has no idea who her pupils will be, or
exactly what she will do with them. ''I've never done anything quite
like this before,'' she confesses. But staking out new territory has
always been what she is best at.
Seymour, one of our greatest, most expressive ballerinas, has always
excelled at taking risks and bringing new dimensions to ballet. She has
worked with many choreographers, but most notably with Sir Kenneth
MacMillan, who, inspired by her pliable physique, interpretative daring,
and chutzpah, created many new roles on her -- including Juliet in his
version of Romeo and Juliet. Over the past couple of years, at the age
when most ballet dancers have hung up their pointe shoes, she appeared
in new works by the experimental group Second Stride and the Mark
Baldwin Dance Company. She grimaces at the memory: ''Physically it was
very hard to get back into. Awful.''
This is hard to believe. The dancer, now 56, is still in beautiful
shape. In her grey leggings she looks tiny and slender. Her hair is
streaked with grey, but her face is still soft and her brown eyes look
like big chocolate drops behind her gold-rimmed specs. And she still has
a smile that breaks her face in two, like that of an eager child. She
lives in a charming little house in Hammersmith, with a button-eyed
lapdog, and greets you without a trace of snobbery, offering tea, and
asking your opinion about a couple of old chairs she found in the
street.
She thinks the have-a-go instinct that has characterised her career
might have to do with the fact that her family were pioneers. She is
third-generation Canadian (her mother's family were Scottish; her
maternal grandfather studied at Edinburgh University). ''Whatever you
tried to do, the attitude was 'just go for it','' she recalls. ''My
brother was a great runner, for instance. He was a gold medallist in his
time. My father tried to join the air force, but was sent back because
he was too young. But he was that kind of chap. Romantic.''
Like many young girls her desire to dance was kindled by seeing the
film The Red Shoes. But, while other little girls dreamed of wearing
tulle and floating about like a fairy princess, her motive was
different: ''I wanted to enter the world of music, to be surrounded by
music.''
She attended classes and was spotted at 13 when the Royal Ballet (then
the Sadler's Wells) was touring North America. At 15 she moved to London
to take up the scholarship she was offered at the company school, but
never quite got to grips with the stuffier, socially stratified Britain.
She has often said that she felt like an outsider, and that she never
quite shrugged that feeling off. ''I did find the ballet world very
restricting,'' she admits. ''They were always pushing you down all the
time. Just when you were at your best they would say, 'Well, there's
nothing more for you to do.' ''
She never toed the line. No ascetic ballerina, she smoked, drank, and
ate. And while she was a maverick in her professional life, she also had
an extremely volatile personal life. Virtually anything that could
happen to her has happened -- broken marriages, serious injuries, bouts
of depression, alcohol addiction, bankruptcy. She has never made any
secret of the traumas in her life, and the press cuttings are brimful of
them.
Mention this candour, however, and you see the first glint of steel in
her. ''Well, I don't find any shame in the things that have happened,''
she says. The brown eyes are now less soft, more defensive. ''I wasn't
the first person to talk about such things.''
Then she softens a little and concedes that perhaps she did want to
give the lie to the Barbie doll image that some people still retain of
ballerinas.
''Perhaps the compulsion to tell the truth about my life was also
partly to do with what we were working on at the time. The ballets we
were working on weren't to do with fairyland. It was the times: Pinter,
Orton, Osborne -- everybody was talking about real life, and we were
working on all of these things. It was exciting to explore it in
dance.''
In the late fifties she appeared in works like The Burrow, a study of
claustrophobia, and The Invitation, which dealt with rape. In the latter
she was astounding, using her dramatic invention to transform from a
naive young girl to a violated and traumatised victim. She worked with
MacMillan as he mapped out new territory for British ballet. Despite the
depth she brought to the classical roles, it was breaking new ground
that really set her alight.
Ask her what was most appealing to her -- creating a new role in the
rehearsal room or dancing that role on stage -- and her answer is
unhesitating.
''Creating it. Always. The rest was second best -- even performing.
Creating a role is gorgeous work. When you come up with something good
you feel so elated. It's the best. By the time it is on stage it is in
different hands somehow. And people will watch it and say something like
'That was jolly nice' and it's your guts in there!''
The character she enjoyed creating most was the title role of
MacMillan's Anastasia. ''Because she was a contemporary person. And it
was dealing with possible injustice. I thought it was a super ballet.
And it was all new -- you could just make this person,'' she says.
But, despite her passion for her work, she says she no longer wants to
dance. ''I'm not really interested in dancing anymore. It's funny. I
used to adore it, and now it's just not there any more. I love it every
morning when I wake up and realise I don't have to go to a class -- I
feel great! Though I do like going dancing with my kids.''
Her three sons (twins Adrian and Jerszy, and the younger Demian), now
grown up, have been an immense force for good in her life and she went
to enormous organisational lengths to take them with her on tour when
they were small. She is proud of having brought them up and is practical
about their impact on her. ''They were often what got me on to the
stage.''
Now, she says, she is uncertain which direction to go next. ''I would
like to choreograph some more, perhaps . . .'' What about acting? She
was always Britain's most dramatic dancer. She shakes her head firmly.
''I don't want to be on the stage any more.''
* Lynn Seymour's two-day Professional Masterclass is at the Fringe
Club, Edinburgh, on August 29 and 30.

There are more than a few highly-covetable items to be picked up
around the Fringe in Edinburgh just now. and present their shopping
selections
SOONER or later the Fringe goes to my head. I have the cloches,
fedoras, hooker-doons and trilbies to prove it. Time and again I have
muttered -- ''This is the last straw!'' only to succumb to yet another
hat-attack.
Things were going nicely. I'd survived into week two without being
netted by more than a 50s cocktail chapeau -- a wee flying-saucer in
searing fuschia with navy spots -- that I happened on near the Gilded
Balloon II.
I might have made more headway in the resistance stakes if I hadn't
wandered into the West End Craft and Design Fair . . . For there I
struck unexpected gold -- or rather tartan, velvet, silk, and hand-made
felt.
Cleverly plaid is how I'd describe Jane Mackie's designs. I
automatically homed in on the headgear -- perky little berets and hats
in colourful tartans, banded with velvet or contrasting checks. They
just happen to mix and match with a host of other goodies. Everything
from tartan earrings to dressy little box jackets, appliqued T-shirts
(tartan-hearted) and cosy button-through smocks that skim the knee with
a cheeky frill.
These are clothes that really show up the marvellous vitality of
tartan patterns -- well worth checking out. Jane Mackie sells only
through design fairs. For details of future locations, phone 0131-441
1311.
I was just about to browse through some ceramics when I saw this
velvet brim glinting in the sun . . . kingfisher blue . . . A Regency
buck's affair with a peacock feather pluming at the front. Nestling
nearby, a hot coral number in silk, its wide turned-back brim cut away
at the edge into a curling apostrophe. Fate had led me to Cee Cee Head
Wear -- brilliantly pretty hats with witty detailing by Cathy Carpenter
(0131-667 6306).
An accidental turn right and not left, and instead of the exit I found
Fawns Reid (0131-555 3992) and her extraordinary collection of garments
made from recycled materials. Here are hats to make the scalp tingle. A
hand-felted lavender-grey picture hat, its lavish brim neatly stiffened
at the edge, the crown heavily ruched. A simple little pull-on made
special because of the rainbow swirls laid into the woollen felting.
Highly individual style that lets nothing go to waste!
To cap it all, on my way out I discovered clever hatpins made from
de-constructed watches by Julie Robertson. Surely a sign that it's
always the right time for another hat.
* All hats and clothes are currently on sale at the West End Craft and
Design Fair, St John's Church (corner of Princes Street and Lothian
Road). Until September 2, except Sundays.

Asda is to change the way it sizes egg after complaints from confused
customers. The supermarket will replace the 0 to 5 marking system with
simple small, medium, large, and extra-large sizes. A spokesman said:
''Many customers were confused by the numbering system, not knowing
whether a size 1 was a small or large egg.''

ACCORDING to followers of the Cowal Highland Gathering, these are the
real Highland Games, dwarfing Braemar by comparison.
As the 101st Cowal Highland Gathering enters its second day today,
having attracted one of the largest overseas entries in the
championships' history, the scene is set for the procession of nearly
3000 pipers and drummers in more than 150 pipe bands along Argyll
Street, Dunoon.
With about 500 dance competitors, this is the world's largest
gathering of either dancers or pipers. This year Dunoon welcomes
competitors from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, America, Europe, and,
for the first time in almost 50 years, South Africa.
Over this weekend, Dunoon's population has swollen from 9000 to about
50,000 and the town has been transformed into a giant, good-humoured
street party. In the stadium today, some 25,000 people will watch an
action-packed tartan kaleidoscope of colour and action against the skirl
of the pipes.
This year marks a return of track athletics after an absence of
several years, including a 3000m race which has attracted a field of
more than 30 of Scotland's top middle-distance runners. The event would
not, of course, be complete without the traditional heavy athletics --
hammer, shot, and caber.
Today will be the decider for the coveted Cowal Trophies for pipe
bands, including the 90-year-old Argyll Shield presented to the
gathering by Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Louise.
Chieftain of the Day today will be Strathclyde police Chief Constable
Leslie Sharp. Proceedings will end with a fireworks display on Dunoon
esplanade.

<HEADLINE>Heads caution against reading too much into another successful year for the private sector.  Passes 'reflect value added'</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S independent school sector gave itself a pat on the back
yesterday, after turning in another batch of high pass rates in this
year's Higher, Certificate of Sixth Year Studies, and A-level
examinations.
Mrs Judith Sischy, director of the Scottish Council of Independent
Schools, said the results reflected the hard work and commitment of
pupils and staff in private secondaries, where annual fees can be
between #1840 and #7875 for day pupils, and from #7782 to #11,730 for
boarders.
Most fifth year pupils sat four or more Highers, and the average pass
rate was 85%. More than a third achieved A bands. Independent schools
educate 4% of Scotland's pupils.
Mrs Sischy said: ''In many cases there will be success stories far
above the average.''
But the council and heads cautioned against reading too much into the
raw results, while one of Scotland's leading educational researchers, Dr
Brian Boyd, warned that they made no contribution to the key debate
about measuring the value schools add to pupils and their achievement.
Dr Boyd, associate director of the Quality in Education Centre at
Strathclyde University, Glasgow, said: ''It is very difficult to know
from these results whether a school is making a significant impact, or
doing better or worse than you would expect it to.''
Mrs Sischy, however, said: ''I would maintain we do work very hard on
the intake, and probably would score very highly on value added. What we
do best is not just stretching the most able. We also stretch the middle
ability range. That is what value added is about.
''Although it does not show in the tables, the high level of success
we achieve implies that we do provide added value.''
The High School of Glasgow and Hutchesons' Grammar in the city, said
to be the two Scottish independent schools with the most demanding
selection procedures, had the highest average of A passes at Higher in
fifth year.
Mr Brian Lockhart, acting rector of Glasgow High, said: ''Our 94% pass
rate in fifth year is about the same as we have achieved in recent
years. Consistently good results and the number of A passes confirm that
we are providing quality.
''It is our policy to present all pupils in fifth year for Highers,
and that means these results are a true reflection of the school.''
Another school which did particularly well in the number of As
achieved in fifth year, St George's School for Girls in Edinburgh, is
finding that Scottish courses and qualifications are growing in
popularity over English GCSE exams.
St George's head, Dr Judith McClure, said: ''We have about 80% of our
students now doing Highers because they very much like the range you can
get from them. The problem with A Levels is that they are two-year
courses and are quite narrowly-based.''
As in the state sector, there are fewer single-sex schools in the
private sector, but Dr McClure described St George's as ''flourishing
and full''. She said: ''In girls' schools you gather together a lot of
well-motivated girls, the whole school is devoted to them, and they are
likely to do better, as our results confirm.''
Mr Keith Pearson, head of George Heriot's, in Edinburgh, said the
school's results would probably not be as strong as last year's, but he
added: ''Equally, I think they will be pleasing over the piece.''
Mrs Sischy said: ''The tables do not tell you how to make comparisons
with other schools. Exam results are a pointer. They do not tell you
about the raw material coming into the school, or the school itself.''
Dr Boyd said: ''Independent schools have favourable staff pupil
ratios, 30% to 40% higher than mainstream state schools. You would be
hard put not to get very good results in these circumstances.
''There are certain things independent schools do very well. They have
an ethos of achievement, and the best of these schools are very good at
promoting it. But when you focus on exam results you need to be wary
about whether schools are being selective internally, with youngsters
who do not keep up being discarded. That would be very negative.''

EDINBURGH presents a treasure trove of shopping opportunities.
At Galeries Mirage on Raeburn Place I found an Aladdin's cave of
jewels, silver, indigo shawls and wedding screens. Its ornamental hats
and head-dresses from Afganistan won me over hands down. Like ceremonial
crowns, bejewelled and tasselled, plastered with metal coins and tokens,
they ooze an irresistible exotic aura.
In the Scottish Gallery, Peter Chang has just been nominated for the
#15,000 Jerwood Prize, (the sole Scot in a high powered list of
Britain's top six) to be announced on September 6 in London. His
fabulous ornate but modern bracelets and brooches bring the 21st century
to the gallery.
Also on show there is the work of Susan Cross. Cross's grandmother, an
accomplished needlewoman, has a lot to answer for. Susan is unique in
applying sewing techniques like crochet to metal with beautiful results.
These austere, elegant oxidised silver and gold chain tassels and
fringed pendants of great abstract beauty are expensive but wearable.
Meanwhile at the Open Eye Gallery on Cumberland Street silversmith
Angus McFadyen's work is on sale. His engraved salt cellars with garnet
feet and pansy design are a treat as is his shimmering silver jampot. A
real taste of the high life.
At InHouse on Howe Street, you can marvel at technology. Till recently
only Cinderella enjoyed a glass coach. Now, if you have #2613 handy, you
too can possess a fantastic chair in folded crystal by Boeri. InHouse
know how to make your mouth water: Sottsass's crazy coloured jugs and
dishes in primary red, blue and yellow hand blown Murano glass (at
#1200) are among the more expensive treats, but for the rest of us there
is a range of glass by Aino Aalto designed in 1932 from #5.95.
Also on offer are Philippe Starck's simple but amazing Daum flower
holders, a snip at #790, and McConnico's hilarious cactus goblets.
Did Greta Scacchi wear real Georgian jewellery in the Cosway film? Joe
Bonnar could probably tell you, for his Thistle Street shop supplied the
Portrait Gallery's display of miniatures, rose cut diarmonds, rubies and
coral. Designed to be discreet, subtle, not showy and best by candle
light -- worth window-shopping for.
On a down note as I don't like fierce feathered creatures, Jeremy
James ceramic birds at the Open Eye on Cumberland Street filled me with
horror. Others obviously enjoy James's snarling dogs and clucking hens
as they are selling well.

Michael Fry continues his contemporaneous reports of the Jacobite
rebellion, as General Sir John Cope looks for an opportunity to face the
rebels.
INVERGARRY, August 26 -- Prince Charles declared today that he will
take the first chance to lead his Jacobite clansmen into battle with the
Government's forces advancing to meet him under Sir John Cope.
General Cope has reached Dalwhinnie, so the two armies are only about
25 miles apart by the military road which leads from the Great Glen over
the Corrieyairack Pass, 2500 feet high, to the upper reaches of the
River Spey.
With this information to hand, the prince is to hold a council of war
tonight at the castle of John MacDonald of Glengarry beside Loch Oich.
It lies 20 miles north-east of Glenfinnan where he raised his standard
last week. In wet and stormy weather, he reached the Great Glen by
marching the whole way on foot with his men over mountain tracks,
avoiding Fort William which is still held by the Government. When a heel
of Charles's boot came off, the Highlanders said they were glad to hear
it because he could not go so fast.
A week ago his forces numbered 1500. More have joined him since. But
this is still only the embryo of an army, almost half of it made up by
Donald Cameron of Lochiel's regiment, the rest mainly by men from the
clans of Alexander MacDonald of Keppoch and of Ranald MacDonald of
Clanranald, to which the MacDonalds of Glengarry are now added.
They are poorly armed. The prince brought some small cannon with him
from France, but since there are no roads in the West Highlands, he
could not move them from his landing place. There are also problems of
organisation. The Highland warriors think heavy manual work beneath
them. Some weapons and ammunition have had to be abandoned because they
would not follow orders to carry them on their own shoulders, even
though there was no other way of transporting equipment over rugged
country.
The two Irish mercenary officers who came with the prince, Sir John
MacDonald and Colonel John William O'Sullivan, are worried at the lack
of military discipline. They have recommended the formation of companies
of uniform size but, says O'Sullivan, ''that cannot be followed. They
must go by tribes. Such a chief of a tribe has 60 men, another 30,
another 20 more or less. They will not mix nor separate. They will
follow their own way''.
Meanwhile, General Cope has rapidly advanced with more than 2000
troops up the main road from Edinburgh through the central Highlands
towards Inverness. While the Government was caught unawares by the
prince's landing, it has long had a contingency plan against the
possibility of a Jacobite rising. This is based on the fortification of
the Great Glen with small but permanent garrisons at Fort William, Fort
Augustus, and Fort George, linked by the military roads which General
Wade built 20 years ago.
To make something of that plan is now Cope's task. But his force is
not big enough to crush the Jacobites, and he has no chance of immediate
reinforcements. As he advanced he heard with dismay that two of the
Government's main allies in the Highlands, the Duke of Atholl and Lord
Glenorchy, had not succeeded in raising any companies for him. Extra
strength can now only come by recalling troops from the British Army in
Flanders. This will take time and will only be done reluctantly because
of French successes this year in the fighting for the province.
Where Cope moves next will depend on what the Jacobites decide to do.
During the council of war at Invergarry, there will be two basic choices
facing the prince, his advisers, and the chiefs who have rallied to him.
They have to recruit more men, but they have at the same time to stop
Cope breaking into the Great Glen and linking up with the garrisons,
which would spell the end of their rebellion.
If the Jacobite leaders put recruitment first they would probably
continue marching north to Inverness where, for example, the Frasers
under Lord Lovat might join them. There are reports of his being in
touch with the prince. But he has also supplied intelligence to Duncan
Forbes of Culloden, Lord President of the Court of Session, who is
directing political efforts to keep the clans peaceful from his house
near Inverness. The news reaching him is not good. A message which got
through from Fort Augustus reported that the Highlanders ''are in great
spirits and all have sworn to conquer or die''.
The prince himself prefers to attack Cope as soon as possible. He has
appealed to clans further south to join him. The MacDonalds of Glencoe
and the Stewarts of Appin are reported to be on their way. He has no
other means of recruiting strength if he wants to take the initiative
and advance over the Corrieyairack Pass. After that the military road
crosses desolate, uninhabited country. But if the Jacobites occupied the
pass, they would be in a strong position to mount a sudden assault on
Cope. The pass also forms a formidable barrier, impossible to outflank,
to any effort by him to storm it.
His position is thus difficult. He cannot reach the pass before the
Jacobites. In that case he can only make for the next best place to
block their advance, at Garva where the road crosses the Spey. His army
is well-armed but fatigued after its forced march, and he has problems
with its morale. He has been plagued with desertions, and with sabotage
by Jacobite sympathisers during his progress through Perthshire. Bags of
grain have mysteriously burst open and horses have been stolen.

THE campaign against the drugs menace on Scotland's streets is being
stepped up.
Local drug action teams will share #200,000 of Government money that
will go towards educating young people about the dangers of drug abuse.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, who announced
the funding while visiting Glasgow's Drug Crisis Centre, said: ''The
projects aim to explore ideas which will help divert young people away
from drugs.''
The local teams, based throughout the country, will devise ways of
encouraging young people like themselves to get involved in games,
crafts, and leisure pursuits designed to steer them away from the drug
culture.
Lord James said there were now an estimated 9500 intravenous drug
takers in Glasgow alone.
Recent research has shown that in some areas of the city, such as
Springburn, there are between 700 and 800 young people injecting drugs,
with many of them taking some form of drug like Temazepam since they
were 13.
Lord James also expressed his fears over the widespread misuse of
Temazepam and warned that it might have to be reclassified.
The 24 projects will receive #200,000 immediately with up to #100,000
to follow.

on Rangers' group opponents
GERMAN star Jurgen Kohler yesterday dismissed the challenge of Rangers
and predicted that Borussia Dortmund would win the European Cup.
The defender, rated the best man-marker on the Continent, is the
latest of six imports from Italy made by the German champions.
Kohler, who cost #1.5m from Juventus, is confident that Dortmund are
now ready to rule in Europe. He insisted: ''We are bigger, better, and
wealthier than Rangers.
''This club can afford to buy any player it wants without having to
sell anyone. We can compete financially with anyone. The club's record
in the transfer market proves this.
''There is no need to be concerned about Rangers or any British club.
And there are enough players here who played with Juventus to know that
we are capable of winning our Champions' League group and going all the
way to take Ajax's crown. We are that good.''
Big-spending Dortmund have also acquired Matthias Sammer (Inter
Milan), Andreas Moller (Juventus), Stefan Reuter (Juventus), Julio Cesar
(Juventus), and Karl Heinz Riedle (Lazio).
During the summer, midfielders Patrik Berger (Slavia Prague) and
Carsten Wolters (Wattenscheid) also were signed by Borussia.
But they will be without their strike force of Riedle and Swiss
internationalist Stephane Chapuisat, who are recovering from serious
knee injuries.
Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld admitted: ''They will certainly miss the early
rounds, but should be fit by the time we meet Rangers.
''But they were also absent when we went on the run which won our
championship. We succeeded then despite enormous injury problems. I will
have the best-motivated team in all the Champions' League.''
Dortmund also have fast-improving attacker Heiko Herrlich, who was
joint-top scorer in the Bundesliga last season with 20 goals.
Rangers fans will find an unwelcome sight when they arrive at
Dortmund's Westfalen Stadium for their Champions' League game in
December -- home supporters in Celtic colours. The two clubs have had a
special affinity since they met in a European tie some years back, and
green-and-white is regularly sported among the yellow-and-black at the
home of the German champions.
A Celtic spokesman said yesterday: ''There's always been a good
relationship between the clubs, and last season a group of Dortmund fans
visited us for a home game, wearing half-Celtic and half-Dortmund
scarves.''
* RANGERS were last night rated 16-1 shots to win the Champions'
League.
Bookmakers Corals last night listed their odds about who will be the
champions of Europe and rate Juventus as 11-4 favourites for the
competition, while Dortmund -- also Rangers Champions' League rivals --
are 9-1 to lift the cup.
Group betting in Rangers' group has Juventus at 4-5 to top the group,
Dortmund 9-4, and Rangers 7-2, with Steaua Bucharest written off at
40-1.
Rangers are 5-4 to qualify from their group to the quarter-final
stages.

* IT hasn't been a summer to think of decorating. It hasn't even been
a summer to think. But somebody, somewhere, is waiting to hit you with
the traditional gloom-laden observation: ''Aye, the nights are fair
drawn' in''. And when this comes, as come it will for a' that, you know
you can't put off the awful business for much longer.
For some people, redecorating is an obsession, an all-year craving
that's never satisfied, a bit like the perpetual painting of the Forth
Bridge in the days when the Forth Bridge was painted.
Here's a cautionary tale. I once had a neighbour who'd taken over a
beautiful old grain mill which had been converted by a cowboy into a
sort of house, and who set out to remodel and redecorate the interior
according to her own vision.
The process took four years -- which was also the length of time she
spent in that house, hemmed in by trestle-tables, coughing in the
vapours of chemical paint remover, and unable to find the toaster. So
far as I could see, she never had time to have her hair done.
In the course of this, she discovered some secrets. When the original
conversion was done, the cowboy had cut a few significant corners. If
the planning inspectors said there had to be a ventilation duct above
this door, then an aluminium louvre was duly screwed into place,
although there was no hole behind it. I will not go into the
complexities of the plumbing, apart from saying that water was not
freely available.
All right: when she moved she got a good price, but is it worth giving
up four years of your life for a good price? Now, of course, she has
taken over another suitable case for treatment, and is plastering,
papering and pickaxe-ing like a dervish, although she still hasn't found
the toaster. But she is an extreme case.
Let us assume that you, on the other hand, are sane, the nights are
fair drawn' in, and you are about to redecorate. This is bold,
courageous and all that, but you will end up with several unanswered
questions.
* Why does the phone always ring when you are papering the ceiling?
* Where is the bloody phone?
* When you're removing a wall cupboard and are down to the last screw,
why is there somebody at the door trying to sell you a raffle ticket?
* Why are seven rolls of wallpaper not quite enough?
* Why does the local shop always close just when you know you're
running short of white emulsion?
* Where did you put the screwdriver?
As I said, there are no answers to these questions. But with the
nights fair drawn' in, you will be asking them. So join the club.

MANY prints now come ready-framed and most of us are quite happy that
someone else has saved us the trouble of choosing a frame. But what
happens when we have a picture or print which needs a frame to set it
off?
For some sound advice, and to put myself in the picture, I went to the
Byre Gallery in Byres Road, Glasgow, where Charles Wilson, who has been
a picture framer for 11 years, helped me to find where to start among so
much choice.
''You have to look at the colours in the picture first and have a good
look at the colours of the mounts and frames. Nine times out of 10 the
customer will ask you what you think, as I have been doing it for so
long.''
The first thing the customer should look for is a shop which will
devote the time to them and give the advice they require. ''When they
come in we show them different coloured cards -- there are about 40
colours to choose from in mounts.
''Then they get to choose the frame from hundreds of types. The most
popular colours are ivories or natural creams. It seems to be the
fashion. They also want black frames with black mounts for the black and
white prints or a grey mount with a black frame.''
However, there is one major mistake which most people make when
choosing frames. ''It depends on your print and what you are actually
framing, but you are supposed to match the colour of the frame to the
print, not the decor of the room. That's a basic mistake that most
people make, they try to match the picture with the decor.''
The range of things that folk are framing is vast. Posters and
pictures are standard but Charles has framed medals, uniforms, baby
bootees and cow horns.
The most pernickety customers are the people who want their own work
framed to perfection. ''They tend to know what they want, art students
and the like, even if it looks terrible. The worst I had to do was a
yellow mount in a yellow frame. The whole thing looked terrible when it
was finished, but they know exactly what they want in their mind so you
can't change it.''
To have a picture framed professionally will cost from #17 for a
10x12in shape, with extra charges for non-reflective glass or marbled
mounts. Another option offered by some picture-framers is the chance to
bring in your own frames to be assembled properly. This is good news for
those who like older frames which can be picked up in junk shops or car
boot sales.
Remember, at the end of the day it is you who will have to live with
the frame and the picture, so it's your opinion that really counts. Try
hanging several different types and sizes of frames together for a
dramatic impact. The family portraits in assorted frames standing on a
shelf, or if you happen to have one, a piano, will look classy.
Lastly, if you have young children and have pictures or posters you
want to hang in their bedrooms, why not have them heat-sealed? This will
make them immune to sticky fingers (you can wipe them clean) and there
is no danger of broken glass.

Mary Bennie forges ahead with stylish designs
* THE current fashion for metal furniture is proving a boon for two
husband and wife teams in Glasgow.
Peter and Christine Beresford run the Workshop Studio at Uddingston,
and specialise in making tables and chairs for both indoors and out.
Peter, who is a civil engineer by training, started making steel
furniture as a hobby, because he was ''fed up with plastic garden
furniture''.
His hobby has turned into a small business, built up mostly by
word-of-mouth. ''People saw the pieces I'd made and asked me to make
something similar for them. Most of the pieces I make are for dining
rooms -- sets of dining chairs and a table, for example. I also do
single chairs which could be for a hall or bedroom. I develop the
designs, in consultation with the client.''
''From initial commission to end result usually takes about three
months.''
The Workshop Studio produces a wide selection of chairs and tables,
which can be finished with a glass, wooden or tiled top. The chairs can
be left plain or upholstered. They come in various styles, including
Queen Anne, Mediterranean and Mackintosh, and in various finishes. It
also makes lamps and candlesticks to complement the furniture.
Rob Mulholland Design is another business which developed almost by
chance. Rob studied sculpture at Edinburgh College of Art and set up his
own business in Glasgow about four years ago, concentrating on
sculpture, painting and printmaking. He made his first metal chair for
his wife, who had seen a similar one in Amsterdam. Now furniture-making
has become the main thrust of his work, with printmaking and painting
taking second place. Rob's wife Susan is also involved with the
business, taking care of the administration.
''Our furniture is all made from forged steel, which can be cold bent,
or heated for more intricate parts of a design,'' explains Rob. ''Steel
is more flexible than iron, which is heavy and also brittle. Most
furniture is made from steel, although it is often all referred to as
iron or wrought iron.
To date, Rob has developed a range of items based on three design
styles. ''The Flux range is an ongoing series of designs made from
forged metal, derived from natural forms and shapes,'' he says. ''Each
piece is hand-made and comes in various finishes -- classic black,
natural rust, or aluminium, or painted in whatever colour the customer
wants.''
Items in this range include tables, chairs, candle stands, uplighters
and accessories such as curtain rails and door handles.
The Flux range interacts well with their most recent range, Sonic Boom
Boom Bang -- minimalist forms made from hand spun steel and aluminium.
''Sonic pieces look solid, yet are both light and strong. Again they
come in various finishes, including black, aluminium and natural steel.
The range includes tables, chairs, stools, vases and uplighters, and we
are currently working on other designs,'' says Rob.
The third range, Alba, is mainly designed for contract work. The Alba
chair is manufactured on a large scale. * The Workshop Studio, 121
Bellshill Road, Uddingston, Glasgow. 01698 810948.

Although books can speak volumes about the personality of their owner,
Johanna Hall finds that more often, the colour of the jacket is more
telling.
THERE is nothing more depressing than walking into someone's house and
finding not one book. A well-stocked bookshelf can transform a room and
say a lot about the taste of the occupant -- or can it?
Is that bookcase filled with well-loved and well-thumbed volumes which
express something of the reader's personality and lifestyle, or are they
just an extension of the decoration of the room?
Anjela Bond is department manager of Waterstones bookshop in
Edinburgh, and she sees people coming in to buy books as decoration.
''There are an awful lot of books that don't really seem worth the
money, but they look nice. There are some art books, antiques and
collectibles books which are very expensive and very hard to get a hold
of, and when you flick through them there's not a lot to them. At #35
they have a few beautiful plates but once you've looked at them, that's
it.''
So once you've got your beautiful expensive book, Anjela doesn't see
it ending up on the top of a dusty bookshelf. ''I guess people lay them
out carefully and they just happen to be lying open when people come by.
Then they put them in a prominent place in the book shelf.
''But some of them are really too big for a shelf, like a recent book
The Art of Make Up. It was about #40 and a really beautiful book which
would have to be laid down as it's too tall. You would need a coffee
table to put it on, as there is nothing else you could do with it.'' Top
of this posh book list must be a boxed set of books called The
Hermitage, a bit of a wow at #150.
You may not be able to judge a book by its cover, but the book jacket
is a very important part of the book both for the publisher and the
customer. ''Today I was asked for a Shakespeare book and the woman
wouldn't buy it because she didn't like the colour of the spine. She
wanted specifically a hardback book of Shakespeare tragedies. She said
she didn't like the colours.''
This can work the other way too, with people buying books because they
like the way they look, and to complement the other books on the shelf
and add that little ''something'' to the room.
''Penguin issued their first-out paperbacks in the same colour, they
also redid their crime ones in the same colour. People just buy the next
one, the next one and the next one. Perhaps one title is not very
interesting to them, but it's the next one in the series so they are
going to have it.'' So when you are being impressed by someone's
library, look out for the perfect set of blue, green or orange penguins.
At one time people didn't even bother to buy real books for
decoration, they bought leather-covered wood which, when done up, looks
like a row of literary classics. If you search for them, they are still
to be found.
However, the person who wants to be seen sporting the ''right'' kind
of literature isn't going for the leather-bound volume which they will
probably pick up and have to blow off the dust. Anjela is selling
something more contemporary to the public.
''Very occasionally someone will come in and ask for that, but
nowadays it's more the matt, two-tone, quite simple cover they go for. A
lot of modern hardbacks, the publisher has a certain look to the cover
and some people pick up on that. I know that booksellers do. There's so
much choice that certain booksellers will just go for anything that's
like the kind of cover. I guess that the public do as well, and pick up
on certain colours.''
Just for the record there are more blue books around just now. There
are some books which are definitely bought for decoration, and miniature
books are among them as they have a strong appeal in themselves, even if
the print is sometimes impossible to read. Some folk are also following
the trend that some book shops have started of stacking books vertically
rather than horizontally, eye-catching but perhaps not too practical.
To find out what books say about a person's personality look past the
book shelf and check out the toilet. There you'll find the books which
folk read in short sharp bursts. This is where the cartoon books, joke
books and books of sayings or quotes lurk. To find out what the
householder really reads, try under the bed where the oose and dust
compete with the latest steamy best-seller or spy novel.

Wendy Jack finds Scots furniture shops are buying furniture in Asia
due to the superior workmanship and design on offer in the Orient.
THE Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Malayasia, Indonesia, China . .
. and Scotland. The common factor? Furniture. Made in Asia, bought in
Glasgow.
Scratch the surface of these connections, and a fascinating story
comes to light. It begins, sadly, with an all-too-familiar scenario of
British workers shooting themselves in the foot . . .
A decade or so ago Ken Forrest, managing director of Forrest
Furnishing in Glasgow, was frustrated at British furniture
manufacturers' inability to deliver on time. It meant he couldn't meet
his customers' needs -- bad news for any business.
To source new supplies he travelled to the Far East, in what has
proved to be the start of something big and successful.
Today, Ken Forrest makes regular buying sorties to Asia for
merchandise for his company's shops. There is also a separate company
with an office in Singapore, manned by Singapore-Chinese, which supplies
furniture to other UK retailers as well as joint ventures with local
people in a number of factories in Asia.
The Philippines, he explained, ''is the powerhouse of design in Asia,
very creative both in the design and use of raw materials. They use all
sorts of wood, rattan, ceramics, wrought iron and their use of colour is
really quite superb, from vibrant tones through to subtle, earthy
shades.
''It's quite unique in Asia for design, and the creativity probably
came from the Spanish influence, it was once a colony of Spain.''
Furniture factories in the Philippines range from very small, with not
much more than a family working in it, to massive operations of 1000 or
more workers.
''Interestingly,'' Forrest says, ''The Filipinos probably have more
industrial relations problems than almost anywhere else in Asia. They've
tended in the main to split into smaller factories because if one goes
down, they can switch production.
''Unfortunately, they've used up most of their indigenous woods. They
were into furniture-making very early, so they are importing, which is
becoming more and more difficult with the controls being put on many of
the Asian countries. They don't want to export raw wood, they want to
process it and add value themselves.''
As with many leaders in a field, the Filipinos are plagued by
plagiarism. The distinction of the design and colour of the mainly
dining and occasional furniture and accessories make pieces made in the
Philippines easily recognisable to an expert, if not to the lay public,
who see only attractive merchandise.
Fossilstone, like an early marble, is a natural stone which is cut out
and carved into beautiful occasional pieces such as coffee or lamp
tables, in creamy browns and other soft hues.
Singapore, once an excellent source of furniture, has become very
expensive for production because of rising living standards, explained
Ken Forrest.
''With full employment they have guest workers from surrounding
countries, but most companies have moved their factories to neighbouring
countries such as Malayasia, Indonesia, Vietnam and China -- all with
their lower cost bases. They are either Singapore-owned, or joint
ventures.
''Most of these countries don't tend to come up with good design of
their own, but if you can give them sketches of designs -- as we do
in-house at Forrest Furnishing -- they can develop them and do a good
job. We do that a great deal.
''Alternatively, they may have a design they're making for someone
else, perhaps in America, and we'll suggest alternatives to that to
improve it for the UK market. We sell that under ScanThai which is our
own label. Another bonus is that because the US is a big buyer in Asia,
we can buy on their backs, which also means we can be in at the start of
many of the new designs which will be coming to the UK.''
How difficult is it to communicate in Asian countries on these
business trips?
''Apart from Singapore and the Philippines, where English is widely
spoken, in most of the other countries it can be useful to have a
Chinese-speaking interpreter -- which is the reason we have our office
in Singapore,'' explains Forrest.
''Much of the industry throughout Asia is Chinese-owned, even in
Malayasia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The people will be of Chinese
descent and will have kept their own Chinese dialect. I tend to travel
with a Singaporean -- that's a very useful introduction. Once you
develop a rapport you can develop good relationships and friendships,
but it does take a little time.''
Macdonald Furnishing, of Glasgow, also offers Oriental design with its
Ming range in hand-carved rosewood. It is remarkably reasonably priced,
considering its quality and the distance it has to be shipped.
It's possible to buy a dining table and eight chairs from the range
for under #2000, while the smaller occasional pieces start from under
#100.
China and the northern borders of Thailand with Laos and Burma, which
have strong Chinese influences and excellent hand-carving skills, are
the best places to provide fine furniture, according to Graham Spurr,
Macdonald's general manager. Since the company took its first Ming
pieces eight years ago, there has been considerable demand for the
furniture, says Spurr.
''There's no typical customer, but one interesting thing is that while
some people will buy a complete range to fill a room, others will buy
just one or two pieces to mix with other styles of furniture, maybe
traditional or even Scandinavian.
''We find a constant demand for Ming. Whether its appeal is largely
due to people travelling further afield now to Asia and seeing the
furniture, I don't know, but there's certainly a growing demand for
it.''
Furniture manufacturing has meant a new lease of life for the rubber
tree. At the end of its useful life it used to be burned down. But
because it takes on stain or colour extremely well, and can be matched
up with more expensive, but less environmentally-friendly teak and
mahogany, it has become very useful. Reasonably priced and very strong,
it is particularly valuable for dining table frames and chairs.

AGA hasn't made it to the encyclopedia pages as yet, but the feeling
is that it won't be long before it becomes part of the English language.
For serious cooks everywhere, an Aga is what the rest of the kitchen
is built around. Take it away and life will go on, but not quite in the
same solid, efficient manner.
Warm and welcoming, it uses controllable heat to handle everything
from cooking for the entire family to keeping plates warm or drying
clothes.
The latest range of classically designed Agas and other equipment is
available for inspection at Gibson-Wight Ltd, 14-18 East Shaw Street,
Kilmarnock.
The company is opening a brand-new showroom on September 2 to replace
the original premises, extensively damaged by last year's flooding in
the area.
It will house a whole series of related products, including Rayburn,
Stanley and Esse range cookers as well as leading manufacturers of solid
fuel, gas and oil-fired stoves. A full range of cooking utensils and
accessories are also available and on display in the showroom.
Gibson-Wight can supply any model to order and the showroom will
feature built up and operating versions in order that potential
customers can see for themselves just how capable and versatile these
units are.
''It is difficult to demonstrate in any other way just how much a part
of any home cookers or stoves of this type become,'' said Mr Gibson.
''They have such a presence that, having become used to one, it is
almost impossible to imagine life without it.''
Although solid fuel cookers and stoves can be specified, the company
is finding that the majority of customers are opting for gas or
oil-fired versions, however, solid fuel stoves are still popular.
There is also the attraction of knowing that an investment in one of
these machines will not be influenced by the passing of time or changing
fashion. They simply never go out of style and they will operate at peak
efficiency for decades with a little basic maintenance.
So whether your need is for a dedicated cooker, such as the Aga, or
one which will combine this with the ability to drive a central heating
system to heat the whole house, there is something on display that will
be ideal.
Like many suppliers, Gibson-Wight are finding that these timeless
designs are being purchased by the owners of a broad spectrum of house
types.
Once perceived to be almost exclusively part of the older and larger,
stone-built home, they are now being installed -- with great success --
into today's smaller properties.
The advantages this type of unit offer over other cookers and stoves
include lower operating costs and a vastly extended effective working
life.
As with all the best designs, the chances are you will only have to
buy one. Although the official opening date for the new showroom is
still a week away, Gibson-Wight tell us the units are already in stock
and staff will be able to provide any information on specifications and
prices as of now. However, a discount of 10% off all accessories and
utensils will be offered on opening day, Saturday, September 2.

* THE Henry Ford European Conservation Awards are open for
applications with a total of $500,000 in prize money for the greenest of
countries.
Applications fall into four broadly defined categories: natural
environment -- conserving flora, fauna and their environments; heritage,
conservation engineering; reducing consumption of natural resources; and
youth projects. Winning countries will receive trophies, certificates,
and prize money.
From its inception 13 years ago, the scheme has broadened its
international reach, with participants from 23 countries across Europe.
TV horticulturist David Bellamy, who launched the awards in conjunction
with Ford in 1982, said: ''The awards have opened thousands of windows
on to environmental projects, providing funding for winning projects.''

* USER-FRIENDLY is a term normally used to describe computer
programmes designed to make it easy for humans. No matter how
user-friendly they are though, there will always be users who are
themselves unfriendly. Computerphobes exist and probably always will.
The Little Book of Computer Wisdom is a handy little publication
designed to cure the phobia, or at least get it down to a manageable
level. Its mission, clearly stated, is to teach people to become friends
with their PC.
We've read it, and unlike many a manual, we could understand it from
page one, and at a penny under #10, it's money well spent by the
neophyte computer user.
The Little Book is 300 plus pages of easy-to-comprehend explanations
which enable the reader to develop a general computer sense, not about
particular systems or programs, but a basic understanding that lets the
novice approach a machine, switch it on, run a program and get it to
work. It takes the reader on a step-by-step ramble through the basics of
word processing, databases, and networking and more besides. Written by
Charles Rubin, the little paperback will become a handy little bible.
Frontiers is keeping it close to the PC.
For children, books of wisdom will come in the form of two new works
by authors Neil Ardley and Simon Gage, who is the acting director for
the Edinburgh Science Festival.
Simon, who lives in Edinburgh, and Neil, who has more than 90 books to
his credit, are popular writers of ''fun'' science, which is the best
way to get youngsters interested in the nature of the universe.
In How Things Work, Neil investigates machinery and shows, in
easy-to-understand explanations, exactly how it does work. Simon's
Action Pack: Light and Illusion introduces the world of light to
youngsters and includes a guide book, models to make, games to play, and
plenty more.
Both books are published by Dorling Kindersley and both authors were
demonstrating the fun side of science at their Exploding Scientific
Evening in the Edinburgh Book Festival's Children's activity tent on
Thursday.

* A NEW all-action adventure game from Nintendo, Illusion of Time, is
based on a mythical Earth of tall ships, bi-planes, and monsters. The
role-playing scenario allows the player make an expedition to the
mythical Tower of Babel, a necessity for finding an answer to the Chaos
Comet which is set to return from deep space and cause all sorts of
problems.
The game personality, Will, has been here before, with his father,
except that of the expedition only he returned from the tower, with no
recollection, as happens in fantasy role-playing games, of what
happened. How was he saved? How did he get home?
Suspension of disbelief is vital; for instance, when in jail, players
should talk to everything, including the moss on the walls.
The basic objective is to discover six mystic statues scattered around
the globe in ancient ruins, which unlock the secrets of the tower and
the key to combating the chaos comet.
The game is a fairly standard adventure with a fair sense of drama and
dramatic location, including the Great Wall of China and Inca Ruins, but
it is somewhat limiting and linear. You cannot, for instance, deviate
from the main plot in any way and must follow the predefined path.
Combat in the game consists of facing the enemy and repeatedly pressing
the fire button, not as exciting as it could be.
Illusion of Time is not the most challenging game on the market, but
it's quite fun and should keep you occupied for a week or two, as the
quest takes many days to see through. Worth taking a look, if only to
see the macabre ''Pig Suicide'' scene.

Scotland, burdened with the disadvantages of weather and midges,
struggles with the holiday trade. But, says Peter Evans, one man is
making a contribution with a nice little line in scenic videos.
THE Scottish Tourist Board has a problem. Not enough visitors are
coming to Scotland and it wants to attract a lot more.Now if you've been
stuck behind a caravan on the A9 or waited in an endless queue to get a
ferry to one of the islands these past few weeks, you may not be
convinced of the merits of this argument. You're probably more inclined
towards the idea of sticking up a ''No Admittance'' sign at the Border.
But like it or not, tourism is one of Scotland's biggest income
earners and providers of service industry jobs -- most notably in the
hotel and catering trade, but also in sectors such as leisure activity.
Think about all the golf courses, the mountain bike hire outlets, pony
trekking and water sports centres and the like.
Competition to attract visitors, however, is fierce, not only within
Britain but on a world-wide scale. Scotland has its disadvantages: the
weather and the midges, as well as an unfortunate number of catering
outlets and hotels who still operate on the principle that they are
doing customers a favour by letting them patronise their establishments.
There's still a long way to go in providing the service, the quality
and variety of food that tourists, and indeed home-grown holidaymakers
have a right to expect for their money.
In the last 20 or 30 years, people in Britain have increasingly taken
their holidays abroad, and now have to be persuaded somehow that British
is best, or at least as good.
The tourist season is currently at its height and ''Scotland is only
crowded for a very short time in the year,'' says Gordon Adams, the
STB's director of planning and development. The peak months are from
July to September. ''Our policy is to try to get people to come off
season.''
Scotland's tourist trade is highly dependent on the ''Auld Enemy'' for
business. Adams points out -- perhaps surprisingly -- that two-thirds of
all expenditure on Scottish Tourism comes from England. But there has
been a long-term decline in the number of English visitors venturing
north of the Border.
Therein lies the dilemma: how to attract them back -- along with more
of the foreign variety. Enter stage left Hamish MacInnes, the wily fox
of Glencoe: mountaineer, designer of mountain rescue stretchers, former
leader of the Glencoe mountain rescue team and specialist safety adviser
to film makers. Remember The Eiger Sanction when Clint Eastwood cut the
rope and took a big fall that must have raised his voice an octave or
two? MacInnes was the man responsible for making sure Eastwood stayed in
one piece.
MacInnes also does a nice line in videos, and the other day he was at
the Glasgow Hilton to launch the latest one in his Where Eagles Fly
series. With commentary by MacInnes himself, together with Sean Connery,
songs written and sung by Moira Kerr and instrumentals provided by
musicians such as jazz guitarist Martin Taylor and Donald Shaw of
Capercaillie, Scottish Fantasia is aimed at bringing in those elusive
tourists.
It centres on promoting Scotland's greatest asset -- the scenery.
''There is general acceptance that this is a particularly beautiful
country,'' says Gordon Adams. ''One of my main objectives is to make
people more aware of Scotland's environment,'' says MacInnes.
The viewer is taken on a whistle-stop tour of some popular scenic
areas, starting in Stirling and the Trossachs, crossing over to
Inveraray, Bute, Dunoon and Easdale, then north to Oban, Mull and nearby
islands.
There are long sections backed by music and Moira Kerr's lilting
voice, without any commentary, letting the scenery speak for itself.
Connery ''lishps'' through the first part of the film, touching on
major historical characters: Wallace, for instance, was ''hung, drawn
and quartered in London, England'' and whose head was fixed on Tower
Bridge. Stirling, with its monument to Wallace, is described as a ''laid
back little town, mega big in hishtory''.
Then there's Rob Roy MacGregor of course, ''a man to take along if you
had some shword work or cattle rustling in mind'', and Loch Lomond -- 18
miles long, four and a half miles wide at its widest point, 630 feet
deep at its deepest, the largest stretch of fresh water in Britain.
References to the word ''crannog'' pass without any explanation of
what a crannog actually is -- annoying for many potential tourist who
won't know what this is (an ancient lake dwelling in Scotland and
Ireland).
Connery hands over the commentary to MacInnes at the Cobbler, that
''great little mountain'' above Arrochar so beloved of Glaswegians
during the outdoors boom of the 1930s.
References are inevitably brief as the journey progresses. The
Campbell dynasty's connection with Inveraray; Dunoon and Highland Mary,
and Oban Highland Games feature, before we skip across to Mull and the
rugged coastlines of the islands.
Dervaig is described as a ''cute'' place and Staffa, with its
remarkable basaltic columns a ''fab'' island. Not adjectives I would
have used, and they do grate on the hearing.
Musically, the last section of the film and its stunningly beautiful,
''wild, untameable, all powerful, invincible'' scenery is the one I
enjoyed most.
But hang on a minute, isn't there an inherent paradox in this?
Visitors are attracted by the prospect of peace and quiet, to be able to
savour the scenery. Bring in more of them and that surely prevents them
enjoying what they came for in the first place.
For Gordon Adams, the solution is one of management. The STB has a
declared ''Tourism and Environment'' policy with the objective of
sensitive integration.
The effects of visitor pressure -- traffic congestion, litter, erosion
on footpaths and sand dunes, disturbance to rare plants, nesting birds
and marine mammals -- are acknowledged but Adams maintains the problems
are confined to relatively few locations.
Asked at the video launch if the STB had invested anything in the
repair of footpath erosion, for example, he replied that was the
responsibility of ''other agencies'' like Scottish Natural Heritage.
The prize available by the end of the century in terms of increased
tourist business if initiatives are successful is estimated at half a
billion pounds.
That sort of cash injected into the economy is worth fighting for, but
the STB has to be vigilant in its efforts to preserve intact the scenery
the visitors come to see and enjoy.
If that means putting its hand in its pocket on occasions, the
responsibility cannot be shirked and palmed off onto those ''other
agencies'' Gordon Adams talked about.

* A SURVEY by Apple Computer UK into education trends shows that
technology will be widespread in classrooms within the next 10 years.
The research shows that more than half of the UK's teenagers already
use computers at school and most want to use them even more. While
teachers see computers being used for marking exams -- and that might
take some of the drudgery out of it -- teenagers will be using them for
completing school work at home.
Teachers in the survey predict that as class sizes grow over the next
10 years technology will make teaching easier. Computers will increase
the learning resources available via CD-ROM and the Internet and
tailored educational software will enable school staff to take on a more
supervisory role. Most teachers also feel that children with access to a
home computer have a learning advantage over those without.
Obviously. It used to take hours to copy the class swot's homework.
Now you can duplicate a disk in seconds.
* EDINBURGH University's new informatics umbrella group is up and
running, bringing key departments and institutes together with hardware
and software suppliers and other hi-tech users.
The non-profit-making organisation has been set up because the speed
of developments in the field of Information Technology has created a
need for effective feedback and communications between academics,
suppliers, and users to help ensure that future developments remain
properly focused.
The members expect to benefit by exchanging ideas and discovering
areas of mutual interest and expertise. The Edinburgh Informatics
Association is expected to help accelerate the transfer of technology,
and, it is hoped, should establish the Uni as a centre for Informatics
excellence.
* ALSO up and running is a new computer-assisted learning unit in St
Andrews University Biochemistry section. Bio-Cal is developing a
multimedia CAL package covering Higher and A-Level courses, focusing
initially on the Higher syllabus, but possibly graduating to the
undergraduate course.
Bio-Cal's package, structured for pupils who might benefit from an
easily accessible approach to biochemistry, will include multimedia
components such as stills, drawings, cartoons, simulations, and video
clips. More advanced levels will be added for teachers. St Andrews has
already won a number of awards for computer-assisted learning packages
for other subjects including science and maths.
* XEROX Desktop Documents have announced a new suite of integrated
software to simplify management of paper and electronic documents. Based
on leading optical character recognition, Xerox's software enables users
accurately to capture, recognise, and manage documents as well as
exchange them via fax and e-mail. The suite will be sold in a bundle
with the Epson LapCAT to provide a complete hard-software solution for
home and office businesses.
The Desktop Document Management Suite comprises four components, all
accessible from a single integrated control panel. A scanning interface
allows users to scan multiple-page documents, and using an Image Manager
they can be printed, faxed, or e-mailed.
The Textbridge software converts scanned images to editable files, and
a Visual recall uses powerful search-and-retrieve technology to call up
both electronic and scanned documents. The software and LapCAT scanner
are selling for #299.

Lindsay Errington traces the tragically truncated career of a great
chronicler of his times.
LIKE the 18th-century painter Allan Ramsay, and like his own older
contemporary, Henry Raeburn, Wilkie was an artist of international
calibre and, in his own day, certainly of international reputation. To
him belongs the distinction of creating a totally new art from the
''low'' category of genre painting; a delicate and multi-purposed tool
for the examination of society in all its personal and formal relations,
equally adapted to conveying youth and age, reflection and action,
humour and pathos, urban and rural, past and present.
Wilkie was born in 1785, the son of the Minister of Cults, a small
parish in Fife. His first major picture, Pitlessie Fair depicted an
important annual event in the social and economic life of his rural
community. Cattle and horses, together with quantities of household
items, were for sale, and most people in the district must have gathered
there. Wilkie was thinking, for his picture, in terms of a portrait of
his local community.
In 1805, having amassed a small sum of money, he left for London,
which was to be his home for the rest of his life. The painting with
which he leapt from obscurity and poverty into an almost overnight fame,
Village Politicians, is perhaps a slightly too obvious pastiche of the
paintings of the 17th-century Flemish artist David Teniers. Wilkie's
second picture, The Blind Fiddler, probably the best known and best
loved of his whole career, seems immeasurably superior in maturity and
originality.
In 1817 he paid a prolonged visit to Scotland, where he collected
material for his future pictures which he intended to make ''more
Scotch''. Five years later when George IV paid his state visit to
Edinburgh Wilkie was on the spot to record the event.
At this moment, Wilkie seemed to be at the peak of his powers and the
head of his career. Suddenly, within a matter of months at the end of
1824, all this collapsed. A series of deaths and family catastrophies
precipitated a nervous breakdown and Wilkie found himself physically
incapable of painting. He decided to go abroad to recuperate, and the
next few years, were spent on the Continent. Wilkie's years abroad
brought him into daily contact with paintings, which had no equivalent
in 19th-century Britain.
The works which he produced after his return to Britain disconcerted a
number of contemporaries who would have preferred him to carry on
issuing small scale, highly detailed humorous episodes of rural life.
Wilkie's new pictures were very much larger, more serious in treatment,
broader, darker and more cursory, but the means he employed to obtain
depth of shade are responsible for the sad condition of many of his
later pictures.
In 1840 Wilkie again set out on a foreign journey. His destination was
Egypt and the Holy Land. On the return journey a year later he fell ill
after injudicious consumption of iced lemonade and fruit. His condition
worsened and death occurred off Gibraltar. His funeral was commemorated
by Turner in his well known painting Peace, Burial at Sea.

Jim Hewitson recalls the malign intentions of the fisher folk of
Musselburgh towards the KIng's camel.
Edward Graham (camel keeper), July 30, 1633.
Myths: It's scarcely two weeks since King Charles left Scotland after
his coronation and royal tour. What significance can we read into the
fact that his first act on returning to London was to order a camel on a
ceremonial trek around Scotland?
Graham: Well, as I'm sure you'll know, his father King James I -- that
will be sixth up here, won't it -- had gathered one of the most splendid
private menageries in Europe at St James's Park. However, very few
citizens were allowed to see the creatures and the present king wishes
to rectify that.
Myths: It is known that folk in London consider the Scots suspicious
and a trifle touchy but can we rule out any suggestions that the camel
is some sort of symbolic message from our monarch? For instance that he
has ''taken the hump'' over criticism from the Scots nobility of new
forms of worship?
Graham: I would certainly say so.
Myths: Or as has been suggested in a news-sheet that Charles is subtly
telling the citizens of Edinburgh, who are disgruntled at having to foot
the bill for his coronation and the new Parliament Hall, that there is
as much chance of him bailing them out as there is of a camel passing
through the eye of a needle. Idle speculation?
Graham: As far as I'm aware the visit was planned before all this
summer's ceremony.
Myths: It's said in London that this particular camel has a bad track
record?
Graham: Not really, although he was one of the famous half-dozen
camels who along with an elephant were gifted by the King of Spain four
years ago. They made the headlines, you'll recall, when a plan was
devised to smuggle them into London at dead of night disguised as a
coach and six but it failed miserably and whole districts of the capital
were in uproar at the sight.
Myths: Well, he certainly seemed to have made a quick impression on
the fisherfolk of Musselburgh.
Graham: Yes, unfortunately he got excited when he got a whiff of the
sea air and trampled the nets on the way to the surf. It was only a bit
of harmless fun -- he's high-spirited.
Myths: That may be so but it was being suggested around the pubs that
night that there could be a fortnight's feeding in him for the whole of
Fisherrow.
Graham: I fear they would find him a trifle stringy.
Myths: And the incident at Leith?
Graham: It's true he ended up swimming in the basin among the merchant
vessels but only because he was startled by the pilot gun fired from the
outer harbour. As I say, he's a bit excitable but an excellent swimmer.
I agree it does tend to give a whole new meaning to the idea of the ship
of the desert.
Myths: Now camels have had something of a bad press. It's been said
they're ugly, smelly, ill-tempered, dangerous, unreliable,
foul-breathed, almost impossible to ride. Will the people of Scotland
see the other side of the camel on this visit?
Graham: No, I shouldn't think so. I'd simply add that they're clumsy,
lazy, and, as you might say, nane the waur o' a good whipping. Next
year, if this visit proves successful, I hope to bring up all six
animals and race them on Glasgow Green -- that should be something to
tell the grandchildren about.

Bruce Sandison takes a trip to the pastures of boyhood and discovers
some surprising facts.
MY mother and I argue about route planning round Edinburgh. Come to
think of it, my mother and I argue about everything. And I never win. I
suppose that's what mothers are for, to remind us of our fallibility. At
least that is what she says and although I know I shouldn't argue, on
this occasion I was right and determined to prove it.
We were squabbling over the quickest way between Newington and
Edinburgh Castle and things were getting heated. Eventually, and
exasperated, I agreed: ''Fine, if you say so, I'll go that way: King's
Buildings, through Grange, round the Meadows, up Castle Terrace. When I
arrive late I'll just ditch the car and scale the ruddy rock. Are you
satisfied?''
I was attending a reception in the Great Hall and had been warned,
don't be late. On the esplanade I was directed to park and wait in my
car for transport. I read the stone-writ words above the heads of Robert
Bruce and William Wallace, Nemo me impune lacessit, the motto of the
kings of Scotland -- no one provokes me with impunity -- and wondered
how my heroes would have reacted to these instructions.
The motto reminded me of a Glasgow soldier standing guard duty during
the tourist season and being asked by an American visitor what the words
meant. Nothing can match Glasgow humour and the soldier responed
unhesitatingly: ''Nae 10-ton trucks across the drawbridge, Sir.'' My
light-weight mini bus rumbled over safely and I was soon in the Great
Hall enjoying a glass of tax-payer-funded red wine with canapes.
We were inaugurating European Nature Conservation Year (ENCY) which
had been preceded by a Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) seminar. SNH
Chairman, Magnus Magnusson, welcomed 100 guests to the Roxburgh Hotel
followed by presentations on native woods, conservation and farming,
Holyrood Park's Sticky Catchfly plant, and a homily from Richard
Hartley, Council of Europe Member, on the European context and ENCY.
After lunch we bussed round Holyrood Park between experts: Dunsapie
Loch with Joe Muir on visitor and park management; Duddingston Loch bird
life with Charles Rawcliffe from the Scottish Wildlife Trust; Karen
Morrison, SNH, at Prestonfield on the Scottish Golf Course Wildlife
Initiative and David Oldham of the Edinburgh Green Belt Trust on urban
conservation; Alan McKirdy, SNH, on the geology of the area.
What could they tell me that I didn't already know? As boys, my
brother and I roamed Edinburgh from the Water of Leith to the top of
Arthur's Seat and knew every corner of the park. We had hunted English
invaders out of ruined St Anthony's Chapel above St Margaret's Loch,
launched ''The Yellow Carvel'' and ''The Flower'' to battle on Dunsapie;
and, as Army Cadets, recoiled from the shock of bren gun and .303 rifle
at Hunter's Bog range.
In the event, the tour was full of interest, conducted by people
clearly in love with the unique environment of the park and completely
committed to its conservation and preservation. I learned a lot,
particularly about the geological forces that created Edinburgh, the
''Athens of the North'', city of seven hills and cradle of present day
geology.
The most famous site is ''Hutton's Section'' at the south end of
Salisbury Crags. James Hutton (1726-1823) was born in Auld Reekie and
studied medicine at Edinburgh University. He is best known as author of
A Theory of the Earth, the cornerstone of modern geology. Hutton showed
how the crags were formed: not by cold precipitation from the sea, but
by the intrusion and cooling of hot molten rocks.
Holyrood is still a great place for heat and cooling and the park is
perfect for all kinds of outdoor activity; jogging, running, hill
walking, wildflowers, birdwatching, history, geology, archaeology, or
just plain, simple, strolling. Arthur's Seat (823ft), the ancient
''lion'' guarding the auld grey city, dominates Holyrood and the way to
the top is easy; but no matter how often I climb the hill, I approach
the summit with an enduring sense of excitement and anticipation.
My life lies spread below me; the house where I lived, the pier at
Newhaven where we fished, Jocks Lodge where I suffered as a willing but
ineffectual rugby fullback; Calton Hill and Royal High School, patiently
waiting for a Scottish Parliament; Edinburgh Castle, the Great Hall, red
wine with canapes -- I am still searching for the Sticky Catchfly plant
-- perhaps, one day . . .

STRIDENT of voice, an opportunist and a thief, its high profile in

avifauna. Pie means a mixture, originally of many colours, now of two,
but why this bird should have attracted the diminutive of Margaret as a
prefix was not clear. The Magpie, along with many crows, has always had
associations with bad luck and the devil. Any bid symbolic to pagans was
bad news for Christians. ''One is for sorrow . . .'' the children's
rhyme goes, and any number of versions exist of the rest of the chant.
Magpies are increasing in range and numbers, working their way back to
areas where they were hung in rows on keepers' gibbets a century ago.
The expansion is in fact taking place slowly, for they do not usually
wander more than ten kilometres in a lifetime. However, as with
politicians, public perception is everything. Lacking spin doctors,
Maggies court a very bad press. The anguished descriptions of suburban
nest robbing can disguise the ecological fact that prey numbers
determine predator numbers and not the other way round.
The unpopularity of the species may prevent a true appreciation of its
cunning and acuteness. It survives by caution -- you won't see one at a
bird table except for a rapid dawn raid. But the big domed nest is an
engineering marvel; Glasgow Museums have just acquired one which was
built in a Rutherglen garden -- on a base of a hundred S-shaped wire
wall ties. The birds must have been at the building site in the mornings
and evenings, collecting material for a nest ''which no man has the wit
even to begin to work'' as Langland observed in Piers Ploughman in the
fifteenth century. Stridency, aggression and self-confidence can be
offset by intelligence and ingenuity -- even in politicians. But then
again perhaps not.

Bruce Sandison takes a trip to the pastures of boyhood and discovers
some surprising facts.
MY mother and I argue about route planning round Edinburgh. Come to
think of it, my mother and I argue about everything. And I never win. I
suppose that's what mothers are for, to remind us of our fallibility. At
least that is what she says and although I know I shouldn't argue, on
this occasion I was right and determined to prove it.
We were squabbling over the quickest way between Newington and
Edinburgh Castle and things were getting heated. Eventually, and
exasperated, I agreed: ''Fine, if you say so, I'll go that way: King's
Buildings, through Grange, round the Meadows, up Castle Terrace. When I
arrive late I'll just ditch the car and scale the ruddy rock. Are you
satisfied?''
I was attending a reception in the Great Hall and had been warned,
don't be late. On the esplanade I was directed to park and wait in my
car for transport. I read the stone-writ words above the heads of Robert
Bruce and William Wallace, Nemo me impune lacessit, the motto of the
kings of Scotland -- no one provokes me with impunity -- and wondered
how my heroes would have reacted to these instructions.
The motto reminded me of a Glasgow soldier standing guard duty during
the tourist season and being asked by an American visitor what the words
meant. Nothing can match Glasgow humour and the soldier responed
unhesitatingly: ''Nae 10-ton trucks across the drawbridge, Sir.'' My
light-weight mini bus rumbled over safely and I was soon in the Great
Hall enjoying a glass of tax-payer-funded red wine with canapes.
We were inaugurating European Nature Conservation Year (ENCY) which
had been preceded by a Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) seminar. SNH
Chairman, Magnus Magnusson, welcomed 100 guests to the Roxburgh Hotel
followed by presentations on native woods, conservation and farming,
Holyrood Park's Sticky Catchfly plant, and a homily from Richard
Hartley, Council of Europe Member, on the European context and ENCY.
After lunch we bussed round Holyrood Park between experts: Dunsapie
Loch with Joe Muir on visitor and park management; Duddingston Loch bird
life with Charles Rawcliffe from the Scottish Wildlife Trust; Karen
Morrison, SNH, at Prestonfield on the Scottish Golf Course Wildlife
Initiative and David Oldham of the Edinburgh Green Belt Trust on urban
conservation; Alan McKirdy, SNH, on the geology of the area.
What could they tell me that I didn't already know? As boys, my
brother and I roamed Edinburgh from the Water of Leith to the top of
Arthur's Seat and knew every corner of the park. We had hunted English
invaders out of ruined St Anthony's Chapel above St Margaret's Loch,
launched ''The Yellow Carvel'' and ''The Flower'' to battle on Dunsapie;
and, as Army Cadets, recoiled from the shock of bren gun and .303 rifle
at Hunter's Bog range.
In the event, the tour was full of interest, conducted by people
clearly in love with the unique environment of the park and completely
committed to its conservation and preservation. I learned a lot,
particularly about the geological forces that created Edinburgh, the
''Athens of the North'', city of seven hills and cradle of present day
geology.
The most famous site is ''Hutton's Section'' at the south end of
Salisbury Crags. James Hutton (1726-1823) was born in Auld Reekie and
studied medicine at Edinburgh University. He is best known as author of
A Theory of the Earth, the cornerstone of modern geology. Hutton showed
how the crags were formed: not by cold precipitation from the sea, but
by the intrusion and cooling of hot molten rocks.
Holyrood is still a great place for heat and cooling and the park is
perfect for all kinds of outdoor activity; jogging, running, hill
walking, wildflowers, birdwatching, history, geology, archaeology, or
just plain, simple, strolling. Arthur's Seat (823ft), the ancient
''lion'' guarding the auld grey city, dominates Holyrood and the way to
the top is easy; but no matter how often I climb the hill, I approach
the summit with an enduring sense of excitement and anticipation.
My life lies spread below me; the house where I lived, the pier at
Newhaven where we fished, Jocks Lodge where I suffered as a willing but
ineffectual rugby fullback; Calton Hill and Royal High School, patiently
waiting for a Scottish Parliament; Edinburgh Castle, the Great Hall, red
wine with canapes -- I am still searching for the Sticky Catchfly plant
-- perhaps, one day . . .

THE day of the kind and helpful policeman has indeed not disappeared.
My wife and I were among the thousands of athletes who left a trail of
sweat and suffering along the half-marathon route in Glasgow on Sunday.
We had left our car near the Templeton Business Centre on Saturday
night so that we could make a comfortable and convenient exit, after
claiming our medals, bananas, and T-shirts at the end of the race.
The car was not causing any obstruction, nor was there a yellow line
anywhere to be seen. We were however dismayed when we realised the car
had disappeared.
A traffic policeman who was trying to cope with frustrated motorists
was kind enough to radio to his headquarters and to break the news to us
that the car had been towed away to the infamous High Street pound.
I asked him what I should do now given that I had no money on me and
had merely relied on my car key to get me home.
He waved down a taxi and asked how much it would cost to take us to
the car pound -- the taxi driver replied #1.50 -- and the policeman went
into his pocket and gave me #2. I asked him how I could get the money
back to him and he said just to give it to charity, and he sent us on
our way.
The policeman's altruism was compounded not only by that of the taxi
driver who switched off his meter at #2.50 (in a traffic jam) and who
took us right to the car pound for the #2 although the journey would
have cost significantly more, but also by the sheer human kindness of
the administration at the car pound who told us that we would not have
to pay a penny to be allowed to drive our car past the guard with the
alsatian on to the relative tranquillity of High Street.
I would like to thank the anonymous policeman, the taxi driver, and
the car-pound attendant from the bottom of my heart; they typify all
that is great about Glasgow.

BELIEVE me when I say Scotland will not get word-of-mouth advertising
in the positive vein until you clean up your act.
The people of Scotland are so proud of their heritage, their battles,
their clans, their music, their dress, their athletics, their beautiful
Highlands, and loyalty to the Queen.
Besides all that, the Scots are friendly, outgoing, considerate, and
kind to all visitors who come to see what all the shouting is about --
especially if the visitors happen to be Americans.
But, please, the Scots must clean the sidewalks, streets, train
stations (using Stirling as a model), buses, and the garden areas of the
council houses.
Where is the Scottish pride I hear so much about? Don't the Scots care
what outsiders think of them?
Every Scot should learn to put that scrap of trash in a pocket until
they spot a litter bin, or take it home. Soon, if everyone takes pride
in their surroundings, the tourists will return.

GLASGOW and her people are most welcoming, helpful, and friendly.
My husband, who was born in Glasgow, and I, born in the United States,
live in Normandy in the French Cotentin. We have been visiting friends
in Glasgow while my husband has been doing research on his family.
The women who work in the Town Clerk's office went out of their way,
looking through handwritten records to give us information.
We then continued on to the Mitchell Library where we received the
most pertinent and cordial service from one of the librarians.
While I was trying to use an old 10p coin to make a call from the
airport, one of the airport's employees came over and gave us a coin
from his own pocket to enable us to call.
At all times we were treated with the utmost courtesy -- and always
with a smile -- even in the shops and on the streets.
Thank you, Glasgow.

<TEXT>
I WRITE in response to the Consumer Extra article, Fly way to drive
off midges (August 18), in which a survey was purported to have been
carried out on four brands of insect repellent available in Scotland.
The manner in which this test was carried out was far from clinical.
Many surveys before this have been carried out in which SHOO! has proved
very effective. I hardly think that spraying four different products on
the same body at the same time is basis for such a survey important
enough to take up half a page in your newspaper.
A little more thought and investigative journalism is required before
producing this possibly very damaging article. For example, the
effective ingredient in SHOO! is dimethyl phthalate (or DMP for short),
which has been recommended by the World Health Organisation as an
effective insect repellent of which there is 45% in SHOO!
Neither of the products tested were beastie-killers. This is most
misleading, neither DMP nor DEET are insecticides, they are all
repellents. Midges, which I believe this test was aimed at, are not in
fact attracted by salt but by body heat hence the fact they bite to
consume the blood of mammals.
The reason behind the dye being stripped from the Mosi-Guard container
was likely little to do with its strength and more to do with an alcohol
base which is present in all repellents.
DMP and DEET are plastics isomers used in the production of plastics
and have the effect of softening the material, hence contact with
plastics should be avoided.
We claim SHOO! to be the world's most advanced insect repellent. The
effective ingredient is recommended by the WHO and SHOO! has been
thoroughly tested (by Greater Glasgow Health Board dermatology
department) on people with sensitive skin types by the chief consultant,
Dr A Forsyth. Our product has been sent all round the world and used on
Dundee, Cambridge, and most recently Oxford University expeditions in
areas of high malarial risk.
The Forestry Commission has used SHOO! for more than 20 years and
other regular customers are the National Trust for Scotland, the Hydro
Board, British Telecom, Argyll and District, Central and Highland
Regional councils. I suspect it is because they truly understand the
need for an effective deterrent against the ''Scotch midges'' as your
reporter described them.

I HAVE written to you before on your continued publication of
ill-conceived nonsense by John Macleod, most of which has been consigned
to your editorial scrapheap. I sincerely wish you would do the same with
Macleod's copy.
His latest (Tory-free Scotland could cost us all, August 22) defies
belief and is an insult to any intelligent reader of whatever political
persuasion.
While spending half his words on the issue of devolution, he states
that Scots don't mention it among the important issues of the day,
highlighting instead employment, housing, inflation, education, and
health care.
Leaving aside inflation -- which I suspect your ordinary man or woman
in the street would not immediately state as a priority any more than
devolution -- it is the enormous damage done to the four other areas
that has turned Scotland increasingly against the Tories.
This is the more so because Scots see policy in these areas being
pursued for ideological ends in the face of reason and expressed
domocratic opinion; the same ''ideological social ends'', of which he is
critical in the Opposition parties.
His sideswipe at equal opportunities for women and gays in this
respect is contemptible.
He poses the question as to whether we really want a Tory-free
Scotland. I certainly do, with the same desire as I want a Macleod-free
Herald.

DENNIS CANAVAN is to be congratulated for his honesty in acknowledging
the inherent contradiction in the idea that Scottish people could be
sovereign while remaining part of the United Kingdom and hence subjects
of the Crown, ie, the sovereign Westminster government.
It is also refreshing to see a Labour MP recognising that, since no
Westminster Parliament can bind its successor, the idea of a devolved
Scottish parliament having ''entrenched powers'' is nonsense (August
19).
Unfortunately the remedy to the problem of ''entrenchment'' suggested
by Mr Canavan is more nonsense. Does he really believe that the
Westminster Parliament would enter into a treaty which would in effect
allow the international community to interfere in the internal
government of a sovereign nation, the UK, of which Scotland would remain
a constituent part?
As for the idea that such an agreement would put moral pressure on the
Westminster Parliament to observe the terms of the treaty, we only need
to consider what happens with existing international agreements.
The UK played a major part in the construction of several
international human rights agreements, yet despite being party to most
of them none are enforceable in UK courts and recently the UN asked the
Government why the British people had no Bill of Rights.
The answer is quite simple. The introduction of an enforceable Bill of
Rights would in effect transfer sovereignty from Parliament to the
people and, despite the legal and moral obligations incurred by being
party to these treaties, neither Labour nor Conservative Governments
have shown any inclination to surrender sovereignty. We see the same
reluctance with regard to the EU.
Dennis Canavan will have to recognise that Scotland's choice is the
Union or independence. All that lies between is a confidence trick on
the Scottish people.

YOUR inclusion in my Herald of a pamphlet on transcendental meditation
is much resented -- and for many reasons, not least because presumably
you, for monetary gain, are prepared to be responsible for the
introduction of young and old, who know no better, to teaching that will
draw them away from the only true lasting peace of Him who said ''My
peace I leave you . . . ''(John 14:27) into a non-Christian culture and
Hindu-type religion that will serve them ill in future days; the same
religion has served its practitioners ill where it has had dominance for
centuries.
I will not be tedious but I could give you real Bible answers for
every ill that TM is supposed to address, from that system of faith
which brings no future bondage with it -- the ways of Christ and freedom
(John 14: 6).

FOR long I have suspected that we as ratepayers are being taken for a
ride through the unjustifiable extravagance of our local council. I am
now convinced of it.
A young lady arrived by car at my home all the way from Dumbarton. She
said that she had been sent to investigate a complaint that in our area
a cock crowed in the early morning.
Did we keep hens? ''Yes.'' Did we keep a cock? ''No.'' So she went to
look elsewhere.
My reaction was disbelief that anyone who has come to live in the
country would not accept the inevitable country calls of the early
morning -- cows, sheep, birds, cocks, etc; but even more amazing to me
was that our council should entertain such a stupid complaint and
authorise an investigation.
At a time when the popularity rating of our representatives, MPs,
councillors, etc, is so low, this sort of nonsense cannot help much.

I WAS interested in the general thrust of Alf Young's article (August
17), particularly his reference to ''Baffled of Balfron's computer
problems''.
The implication that the residents of that Stirlingshire village may
be at the forefront of modern technology was for me disturbing, at least
of my childhood recollection of the place where my grandparents had a
but and ben, long since gone in a reconstruction of Buchanan Street but
which was at Quarryknowe.
Then it was a place of paraffin lamps and stoves, the wicks and fuel
for which were purchased at Thorpe's Store, where also the accumulator
or wet-cell battery which powered the radio was charged.
The emporium also supplied the equipment needs of those who, like my
grandfather, fished the Endrick Water and its feeder burns and also
provided for those who hunted game on land or in the air.
The neighbouring farms, on many of which I had casual employment, then
had horses as their main source of power. And watching them being shod
in John Taylor's smiddy in Dunmore Street was one of the great delights
of visits to Balfron, greatly enhanced by being allowed to participate,
albeit in a minor way, in the process.
Just along the street from the smiddy was Alexander's garage whose
blue buses provided the regular service between the village and the city
but, just as importantly, made available a duplicate when there were
more passengers than the scheduled bus could cope with.
This, I may say, was a great boon to the bona fide travellers who had
made their way to hotels, at Blanefield, Strathblane, and Killearn, for
the Sunday drink not then available in the city.
Computers are a welcome adjunct of modern living but linking them with
Balfron had me baffled.

ALLAN MASSIE was missing from Michael Fry's cabal at Edinburgh's
BookFest. He's the only creative writer who's also a political pundit
among those who were there.
Recently, Massie regretted the kind of journalism that treats art as
''higher gossip.'' That patrician stance to the commercialisation of
culture is mirrored in both his own and Fry's punditry.
How long will the market for Scottish broadsheets bear the churning of
material by contributors faxing similarly toned articles between North
Bridge and Albion Street after the Thomson titles are finally sold?
Perhaps Paul Scott, that man of Scottish letters, has a point (August
23).

MICHAEL FRY discusses an event in the Edinburgh Book festival, On the
Edge of Europe, in which I took part (August 23). During the event
itself Fry made a bad-tempered, long, and rambling intervention. None of
us were very sure what had upset him or what point he was trying to
make. His article throws a little light on it.
I think that he was chiefly disturbed by some recent remarks by Allan
Massie which I quoted. They were from his article in the Times Literary
Supplement, Goodbye to the United Kingdom? In this Massie says that the
UK ''is no longer a success story'' and that independence offers
Scotland the prospect both of escaping from British decline and of
playing a distinctive part in international affairs.
He says the ''Unionists are like monarchists, in thrall to an idea
which is out of date and has no longer a useful function''.
Of course, many of us have been saying these things for years; but it
is new, and encouraging, that Massie, the chief intellectual force on
the right of Scottish politics, should join us. Michael Fry (and
Forsyth) must feel the ground shifting under their feet.
Neither Massie nor I have ever said that independence will
automatically solve all of our problems, although I think that is a
necessary pre-condition.
Nor have either of us ever suggested that all aspects of English (or
British) cultural influence should be discarded, although I have argued
that we should be free to choose what we like and not have it imposed on
us.
I am afraid that Fry (who is a friend and a neighbour of mine) has in
this instance gone off on an ill-considered tangent.

THE difference is in the details where religion and politics are
concerned. In politics it is necessary to be strong on specifics, the
details to which grand schemes and ideologies all come down in the end.
Opponents of the Labour Party have not been slow to promote this, in
demanding that devolution proposals are spelt out root and branch, jot
and tittle.
However, in religion things are different. It is the letter of the law
which stifles, and too much concentration on jots and tittles becomes
divisive. Those who insist on The Truth being spelt out in detail are
usually defined as ''fundamentalist'' and paint themselves into an
ideological corner from which they shout condemnation on all who do not
see life from their perspective.
Another way of putting this difference is to say that politics is
concerned with the art of the possible and that such pragmatic
boundaries will never allow it to get it right, except in the details.
Whereas religion, dealing in eternal verities which few human beings
manage to live up to, should concern itself with ideals and be wary of
getting bogged down in details which are bound to create anomalies and
contradictions which will undermine the ideal.
Religion is at its worst when it becomes too specific. Whether it is
Calvinists denouncing Sabbath-breaking, Roman Catholics banning
contraceptives because they contradict papal teaching, or Muslims
cutting off the hands of thieves in accordance with their moral law --
it usually paints a very unpretty picture. Jesus did not last 200 years
as the inspiration of countless generations of Christian from very
divergent cultures by being strong on specifics. He instead opted for
parables.
These ''heavenly stories with an earthy meaning'' are an excellent way
of portraying human beings struggling to translate ideals into practice,
the supreme parable (of the nature of God) being the
life/death/resurrection of Jesus himself.
Had Jesus opted for a new set of laws or commandments, or been
specific about the lifestyle which was required by his followers, then
He and His teaching would have long ago been thrown in the dustbin of
history. They would have as much relevance as to everyday modern living
as a 2000-year-old carpenter's manual from Galilee would have to the
erection of a modern building.
Certainly, the teaching of Jesus has suffered from those who wanted it
to be more specific. Paul, confronted with disparate groups of
Christians who had different ideas and emphases, coped with this by
writing letters which contained a mixture of news, sermon, poetry, and
detailed advice on moral matters. Alas, there have always been those who
took Paul's treatment of questions which were very much part of the
culture of his time as being normative for all time. Hats for women in
church is one example.
There is less of this kind of nonsense about. Modern evangelicals are
a bit more pragmatic than their sterner ancesters and you will not now
see hats insisted upon by many churches where the Bible is taken
literally. However, the human tendency to codify religion and stress
rules and regulations is alive and well in other religions as well as
Christianity.
Orthodox Judaism has always had a good line in details -- kosher
cooking being an excellent example. And what about Islamic law with its
awesome web of penalties and duties? Together they make Catholic canon
law seem a bit relaxed.
But my aim here is not to assess relative merits or to slag off
non-Christian religions. My point is that we should resist the Tittle
Tendency whenever we find it because it diminishes the God of all
religions by tying Him down with a Liliputian web of tiny rules and
regulations and pretending that we have captured the truth.
The twenty-first century poses new social and moral problems which
were never foreseen by those who first wrote down the Torah, the Koran,
or the New Testament. Examples of issues which could never have been
foreseen are those arising from advances in genetic research or nuclear
fission.
We have the means to voyage to the poisonous atmosphere of Venus and
have now the industrial appetite to pollute our own through toxic waste.
We have more people than the world can cope with and less awareness of
who our neighbours are than at any time in history. We have shrunk the
world to a global village and are more than aware its problems are too
big for us.
The old rule book will simply not do. There will undoubtedly be a
temptation to reach into the scriptures and try to extend rules which
were designed for another age. They will soon be undermined.
Another temptation is to throw away all the old religion books and
start again. That way lies madness -- the delusion that we are
spiritually different from previous generations. We need the timeless
truths expressed in parables and high principles, only we need them
repackaged for each generation.
Let those with faith in the future -- and the eternal verities --
leave the details of how that might be accomplished to the politicians
and stick to the principles upon which a new civilisation may be created
out of the moral chaos which has settled over the world. That way we can
continue to find fresh inspiration from the scriptures of our religions
and not use them as a rule book which condemns us to live in the past
rather than the future.

THE peace process in Northern Ireland is neither dead nor stalled but
it is limping a little. That is not the fault of the British Government.
It is important that this message is made clear and repeated so that it
is appreciated fully in Belfast, in Dublin and, if at all possible, in
Washington. The Government's latest package of measures are aimed at
injecting a little pace into the process. The measures, which we will
return to, were accompanied by a booklet detailing the considerable
number of changes already undertaken by the Government in the cause of
peace. At the back of the booklet is a cartoon from an Irish newspaper
which depicts Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein and Sir Patrick playing chess.
Mr Adams is saying ''your move, your move, your move''. The message is
obvious. This is not accepted by Sinn Fein which was at its surly best
yesterday in describing the new moves as derisory and insulting. The
simple fact is that any progress towards a lasting peace must be on the
basis of give-and-take. So far the British Government has given and Sinn
Fein has taken. This is not to say that Sir Patrick and his colleagues
have always been correct. They have been properly chided when, for
instance, the internal disputes of the Conservative Party threatened to
bring the process to a halt, but they have been flexible and have moved
forward in a spirit of compromise.
Yesterday's proposals are a case in point. The remission for jailed
paramilitaries is to be restored to 50%. These are not political
prisoners; they are prisoners who have been convicted of crimes
associated with terrible violence. Under the 50% rule many of them will
be released in the near future. That is a concession, and a significant
one. Similarly, an independent review of the province's emergency laws
is promised together with a White Paper on police reforms. All of this
should allow progress and a place for Sinn Fein at all-party
negotiations, but it will not because Sinn Fein refuses to contemplate
an abandonment by the IRA of its weapons.  Sir Patrick did not demand
complete abandonment yesterday but clear progress towards that goal.
This is entirely reasonable and if Sinn Fein wants to be regarded as a
serious partner for negotiations it must move. The vehicle for this is
irrelevant but the requirement is essential.

IT is not pleasant to contemplate Dounreay processing thousands of
rods of spent nuclear fuel from around the world. This is, after all, a
plant which has a serious problem with radioactive contamination and
which concealed for years the existence of a totally unsuitable shaft
filled with radioactive waste. The reasons why Dounreay might be in line
for the reprocessing work are complicated and involve repeated changes
in policy by the United States Government. The basic facts are not,
however, in dispute.
Opposition to the spent fuel returning to the United States is
vociferous and, despite denying it, our own Department of Trade and
Industry has spent considerable time and money lobbying in the United
States for the rods to be sent to Dounreay for reprocessing. With
admirable concern for the man in the street, Americans have been
consulted by the US Department of Energy. They were asked whether they
wanted the fuel to return to the US, to be reprocessed at Dounreay, or a
mixture of both. The results of this survey are not known, but it is a
fair bet that the Americans want the rods to be anywhere but in the
United States. The man in the street in Scotland has not, of course,
been consulted by anyone.   This wholly unsatisfactory situation cannot
continue. Highland Regional Council is rightly upset by the underhand
machinations of the Department of Trade and Industry. It is a mark of
the respect in which our Government institutions are held that HIE has
written directly to the US Department of Energy pointing out, in effect,
that sending material to Dounreay for reprocessing would be like pouring
petrol on a bonfire. Local campaigners against nuclear dumping have a
similarly clear-eyed approach to matters, preferring to plan a trip to
the United States to lobby the US Government over any probably fruitless
attempt to make the authorities in London listen. The problems raised by
this issue are manifold. The days are past when Dounreay could claim
that new developments would lead to employment opportunities. The
present Dounreay workforce appears disillusioned; any reprocessing would
bring few extra jobs and Caithness as a whole has suffered for years
through over-reliance on the nuclear industry stifling the possibility
of a diversity of industry. Nor should the rest of Scotland be
complacent as this is a problem for us all.

COMMUNICATIONS in the West Highlands used to depend on ferries powered
by oars rather than engines. That from Islay to Jura was still propelled
by oar as late as 1918. Most changed during the late nineteenth century
when paddle steamers emerged, but very brief crossings long used very
small craft. The ferry from Colintraive to Rhubodach on the Kyles of
Bute was a tiny motor boat as late as the 1950s, though it now boasts a
small but speedy engine-powered CalMac car ferry, which takes three
minutes on a calm day.
It serves Rothesay, though it hardly competes with the main Weymss Bay
service which takes far longer by sea but saves the very long car
journey fronm the lowlands via Loch Lomond, Loch Fyne, and Glendaruel.
The islanders, or a goodly majority according to a recent opinion poll,
would like a bridge at Colintraive all the same. The example of the Skye
bridge has whetted appetites but stimulated almost no local opposition.
It is an example of how car ownership has multiplied. A mere two cars a
day used to seem the maximum from Colintraive to Strachur during the
early 1940s, but the car ferry and the (relatively) new fast road down
Glendaruel has changed everything. There is a now a fairly constant
traffic, particularly during the summer. There is a good case for a
bridge, not least because the existing ferry journey is not particularly
cheap, though no doubt any new creation would, like the Skye bridge, be
financed by tolls, and its actual costs might not be any less: even a
short crossing bridge would be expensive and if the most scenic location
were preferred to the shortest it might be at the Burnt isles just
before the Eastern Kyle turns to Tighnabruaich and opens up views up
Loch Riddon and across to Kintyre on one side and right down past
Rothesay Bay to the Renfrewshire coast on the other hand. But that would
be a much more costly project, with dearer tolls.
The proposal will attract a lot of discussion but will hardly displace
any popular boat song: ''The Day we went to Rothesay O'' is immortal.

DAVID Coulthard said yesterday that he would hand team-mate Damon Hill
a victory chance in tomorrow's Belgian Grand Prix -- but only if
ordered.
The Scot is determined to prove he has the ability to make it as a
top-class driver after having been sacked by Williams for next season,
and knows this race would be the perfect place.
But the 24-year-old could be in the position to help Hill reduce
Michael Schumacher's 11-point lead, and the title hopeful has questioned
whether team orders should now be used.
''If the team asked me to move over and let Damon through then I will
do so,'' said the Scot, fifth fastest in yesterday's first qualifying,
one place adrift of Hill. ''But it would have to be if I was told.
''Those sort of decisions are down to the team and depending on how
the race is going. If Michael is in front and I am ahead of Damon then
they might want me to pull over.''
Coulthard, denied a maiden victory at the British Grand Prix when he
incurred a pit-lane penalty, added: ''If not, they should allow both
drivers just to go out and race. When I go out there I will be driving
to win.''
The Monaco-based Scot is expected to join McLaren next season, but he
said: ''I don't want to comment about my future because I'm
concentrating on this season. But I am confident I will have a top-four
drive.''
Heavy rain fell on the track yesterday, but a late charge by Farrari's
Gerhard Berger gave him provisional pole position, just in front of
Schumacher, with Jean Alesi, also in a Ferrari, in third place ahead of
Hill and Coulthard.
''We got caught out at the end when the track got drier and the set-up
of the car was not right,'' said Hill. ''Then on my last set of tyres, I
had a blistered left rear. I would prefer to be on the front row and if
tomorrow is wet these grid positions should stand.''
Johnny Herbert sat out the session after having walked away unhurt
from a high-speed crash during his practice session.

SCOTLAND'S Peter Haining won his third successive lightweight single
sculls title in Tampere yesterday at the World Rowing Championships with
an emphatic -- and dramatic victory.
Until yesterday, no one had won this title three times and Haining was
forced to give his all for his unique achievement.
He accidentally dropped his asthma inhaler, which he has to use before
every race, and when a replacement was finally brought to him by British
team manager David Tanner, who had commandeered an umpire's launch to
take it to him at the start, he knew that there would not be enough time
for the inhaler to take full effect.
After the first hundred metres, Haining led through each intermediate
mark. By halfway, he had more than a length's lead but his breathing was
becoming more difficult.
Despite his problems, Haining was able to hold off Tomas Kacovsky of
the Czech Republic and the fast-finishing Anders Brehms of Denmark, who
took the minor medals ahead of Ireland's Niall O'Toole finished a
disappointing fourth.
As he crossed the line, Haining collapsed and was dragged out of the
boat for emergency oxygen treatment. The medal ceremony went on without
him.
Later, Haining's Loch Lomond clubmate Jim McNiven just failed to
retain his world title in lightweight eights. The British crew, which
also included Ben Helm from Edinburgh, came in second behind Denmark.
Two other British silver medals yesterday came from the women's
lightweight four and pair, while the open women's four, with Scots
Gillian Lindsay and Kate Templeton aboard, finished fifth in their
final.

RANGERS discovered again how intoxicating the big time can be when
they were drawn to play the champions of Italy, Germany, and Romania in
the Champions League yesterday. The draw in Geneva more than made up for
all the sleepless nights caused by fear and tension as the Ibrox side
coped with a dangerous preliminary tie.
Six games against Juventus, Borussia Dortmund, and Steaua Bucharest,
with two qualifying for the quarter-final stages from Group C, will test
Rangers' squad to their limits and if they are to reach the final
stages, a few of the players might have to find qualities they, as yet,
are unaware they possess.
''I believe we have been drawn against a couple of teams, Juventus and
Borussia Dortmund, who can be described as the outstanding sides in the
Champions' League along with Ajax and Real Madrid,'' said Walter Smith,
who was still able to pronounce himself satisfied with the draw.
Given that Rangers had experienced the trauma of failing to be
included in the draw last season, and the one before, just to be among
the elite again was enough. When Smith says he is ''just pleased to be
there'' you know he isn't simply talking in football cliches. He speaks
from the heart.
Besides, it would be foolish to beat his chest because Group C of the
Champions' League is a powerful gathering of ambitious clubs, with
Juventus and Dortmund early favourites to claim the two qualifying
places.
''It will be tough, and now there are three points for a win, that
could make a difference to the qualifying process,'' Smith said. ''But
as to how Rangers will do remains to be seen.
''After our own pre-season tournament here when we beat Steaua 4-0 and
Sampdoria 2-0 some papers said we would win the European Cup, and then
when we only beat Anorthosis 1-0 at Ibrox, we're told we are duds.
Probably we're somewhere in between.''
Historical fact, if nothing else, favours Rangers because they have
already knocked every one of the group opponents out of European
competition. Steaua did beat Rangers on aggregate when Graeme Souness
was in charge in 1988, but the Ibrox side won 2-0 on aggregate in the
European Cup-winners' Cup in 1969.
Also, Juventus were beaten in the first round of the European Cup in
1978, and two years earlier, Rangers won 2-0 on aggregate against
Dortmund in a Cup-winners' tie.
Back to the future, however, and it all begins with an away game in
Bucharest on Wednesday, September 13. Dortmund are at Ibrox a fortnight
later, and on October 18, Rangers will be in Turin's Stadio Delle Alpi,
back home against the Italians on November 1, home to Steaua on November
22, and finally, away to Dortmund on December 6.
''It will be a hectic time for us as we watch and check on the other
sides,'' Smith said. ''It means a lot of travelling over the next few
weeks.''
Apart from their twenty-third championship further evidence of the
Juventus growing dominance was offered when they reached the final of
last season's UEFA Cup beating Dortmund in the semis.
The Ibrox side will have to combine their skills, professional pride,
and experience to win one of the top places which is not beyond them,
especially if Brian Laudrup and Paul Gascoigne strike form. The other
players need only look back a few seasons and remember how much pleasure
they took from their last run in the Champions' League.
It is a competition which captures the imagination of all of Europe,
giving entire countries as well as the competing clubs a wonderful
feeling of wellbeing.
The Champions' League is a platform for the gifted and that includes
both Laudrup and Gascoigne, who might wish to continue the exorcising of
a bad memory from a match in the Stadio Delle Alpi. England were playing
Germany in the 1990 World Cup final and when Gascoigne was punished with
his second booking of the tournament, which meant he automatically would
miss the final even though in the event his team didn't make it, he
burst into tears.
He now has another opportunity to return to Turin and leave with his
happy face on. Juventus, who have just become champions for the
twenty-third time, have an array of talents available including their
captain, Gianluca Vialli, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Vladimir Jugovic, and
Pietro Vierchowod, bought in from Sampdoria.
They also have Attilo Lombardo, who was the player of the competition
when he played for Sampdoria in Rangers pre-season event a year ago, but
he has a broken leg and might not be ready in time.
A twist of fate means two players, Jurgen Koller and Andreas Moller,
who were sold by Juventus might be returning to haunt them. The Italians
transferred the German pair to Dortmund.

IT has been a long time since Celtic suporters were able to bask in
the warming light of European football.
But hopefully their absence from the major competitions will have made
them more determined to make the most of opportunities because their
journey into the unknown for a European Cup-winners' Cup-tie against
Dynamo Batumi will be fraught with danger.
Tommy Burns must take his side to the Black Sea town of Georgia two
weeks on Thursday, which leaves him little time to compile a dossier on
his opponents.
Also, Celtic are scheduled to play Motherwell in the premier division
two days after the first leg -- the flights to and from Georgia will be
at least six hours long each -- and there is little likelihood of the
Tennents Scottish Cup holders persuading UEFA to change the date.
Dundee United were confronted with a similar problem last season and
were unable to move the European authorities who are unlikely to be any
more sympathetic should Celtic make an approach.
Burns will simply have to make the best of it, not that he was
complaining yesterday after the draws were announced from Geneva.
''It would have been nicer to have had a team nearer home,'' he said,
''but we have to accept whoever we get.
''Having to travel such distances will be difficult, but we all want
to be part of these competitions and we have to make the most of them
when given the chance to play.''
Finding out Batumi's strengths and weaknesses also will present
difficulties, but Burns says he will make some kind of arrangements to
ensure his team do not go in blind.
''I'm sure, though, they will be a decent team because a lot of
quality teams have already come out of Georgia,'' Burns added.
Scotland's other surviving representative in Europe, Raith Rovers, who
beat Faroe Islands side Gotu 6-2 on aggregate in a preliminary tie, have
a good chance of proceeding further in the UEFA Cup.
They were drawn against Akranes and the first leg will be at home on
Tuesday, September 12.
Raith were prepared to play the home leg away from Stark's Park had
they been drawn against one of the bigger outfits, but now they will
stay at home.
''It is an excellent draw for us because it gives us a chance to go
forward,'' said manager Jimmy Nicholl.
''I don't know too much about them yet, other than that they beat
Shelbourne 6-0 on aggregate in the preliminary round.''
Nicholl had been worried his side might have been drawn against an
Eastern European club, a prospect which would not have caught the
imagination of Kirkcaldy. Indeed, Nicholl had been hoping to be drawn
against Akranes or, if it had to be one of the big clubs, he wanted
Leeds United.
However, Jim Bett, who played for Valur in Iceland, warned Raith that
they will have to be at their best to survive. ''Akranes are a decent
side as they showed when they beat Feyenoord 1-0 in the Cup-winners' Cup
last year,'' he said.
''The Icelandic season runs from May until September and they are on
course to lift the League championship.
''Raith are at home in the first leg and they are going have to try to
finish the job at Stark's Park, because with their limited European
experience, they will find it very tough in Iceland.
''It will be a lot harder than most people expect, but if Raith can
play to the top of their form they should get through.''

BLACKBURN Rovers' first experience of Champions' League football will
not be straightforward, drawn as they are in Group B with Spartak
Moscow, Legia Warsaw, and Rosenborg.
Three years ago, when Graeme Souness was manager, Liverpool went to
Moscow as English champions and Spartak beat them 4-2, with
controversial keeper Bruce Grobbelaar having been sent off. The Russians
won the tie 6-2 on aggregate and Rovers will do well to avoid another
retreat from Moscow.
Manager Ray Harford will draw heavily on the experience of Kenny
Dalglish, recently elevated to director of football at Ewood Park.
''Kenny has wide and extensive knowledge of European football,'' said
Harford, ''and he will travel and watch the teams for us.
''We are on a learning curve while some of the other teams like Ajax,
Real Madrid, and Juventus have been involved at this level for 20 years
or more. It's a way of life for them but a new one for us.''
Harford tried to sign a couple of top players before the European
deadline, but refused to pay the money asked. It wasn't like that in
Daglish's day.
Manchester United have been given a tricky UEFA Cup first-round tie
against Rotor Voltgograd, and Alex Ferguson's first reaction was:
''Where is it?''
However, he was quick to find out and added: ''I understand they are
1000 miles north of Moscow and have just started emerging as a
footballing force. When you play these Russian sides you can never
underestimate them because they always have gifted players.''
Ferguson will make immediate arrangements to have his opponents
watched, but Leeds United might have a queue of people wishing to spy on
their UEFA opponents, Monaco. ''What a wonderful spying trip,'' said
manager Howard Wilkinson. ''I'm almost tempted to go on that one
myself.''
Everton, cruelly hit by the post-Heysel ban having won the European
Cup-winners' Cup and the English title, are back in the big league with
what appears an easy, first-round tie against Reykjavik. Iceland, in
fact, should bring back good memories for manager Joe Royle, who scored
four goals when Everton beat Keflavik 9-2 on aggregate in a Eurpean Cup
first-round tie away in 1970.

BAMBER Gascoigne's ''starter for 10'' would sum up the East End Park
challenge between Dunfermline and Dundee United today for the students
of this season's first division football.
And questions will be asked of both teams this early in the season as
they try for the points that could lead to a premier prize -- the Fifers
finally beating the runners-up spot they have had to suffer for the past
two seasons, and the men from Tayside returning immediately to the top
league.
Dunfermline manager Bert Paton was in cavalier mood: ''These are the
type of games the players love. Good crowd, good atmosphere, and bring
on anyone.''
The Fifers have had an excellent start, both pre-season and in league
and cup competitions, despite being without top strikers Kenny Ward,
Hamish French, and new signing Andy Smith -- all long-term injuries.
United also, despite a 1-1 stutter against Morton in the opening
league game, have shown they also are getting into the swing of a tough
division. Manager Billy Kirkwood admits his side have the talent.
''Attitude will be the biggest problem,'' he said.
Dundee -- with 12 goals in three games -- entertain Airdrie at Dens
Park in what should be another tasty treat.
Morton, despite their defeats by Rangers in front of 40,000 fans,
followed by a reverse at Meadowbank by the newly-named Livingston in
fron of around 300, will meet managerless Dumbarton at Cappielow,
hopefully with an enthusiastic support to pull them round.
Jim Fallon, Dumbarton's coach, temporarily in charge, admitted that he
would not apply for the manager's post, which is now being advertised
after Terry Butcher turned down Sons earlier in the week.
''Dumbarton want someone with a high profile, and I could not do
that,'' said Fallon. ''If they wanted something on more part-time lines,
I would think again. I am happy here as coach.''
The Saints go marching out at Love Street -- St Mirren and St
Johnstone, while because Hamilton are still ground-sharing with Partick
Thistle, their match against Clydebank at Firhill has been put back
until tomorrow.

PREMIER DIVISION KICK-OFF:
THERE is not much danger of any Scot declaring the country's premier
division ''the best league in the world,'' a description often used by
others not too far distant, but as the league season kicks off this
afternoon we would be thrilled to think it might be better than it has
been for a while.
Maybe we will get a real league race this season and a decent show in
Europe to suggest that standards are rising again.
Celtic, obviously, will be expected to be title challengers while
Aberdeen, after their depressing time last season, ought to do much
better.
But few people expect the league flag to fly anywhere other than Ibrox
come this time next year. Rangers will not listen to such talk and
manager Walter Smith made it clear yesterday that the priority after the
midweek excitement was to ''make sure we don't take our eye off the
ball'' on the domestic front.
He went on: ''It has been difficult to concentrate on the start of the
league because of the European games. All the things going on around us,
the draw and its implications, could be further motivation for other
teams to beat us, and I stressed to the players today that it is success
at home that brings Europe and the big games.''
Smith will decide this morning if another new man, Oleg Salenko, will
make his debut against Kilmarnock at Ibrox when the championship flag
will be unfurled once again.
The chances are that Mark Hateley will miss the game as a result of a
groin injury, joining other major absentees Brian Laudrup, Paul
Gascoigne, and Iain Ferguson, but Alexei Mikhailichenko and Trevor
Steven are back in contention.
Kilmarnock have four men out injured -- Steve Maskrey, Colin McKee,
Gus McPherson, and Derek Anderson.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns is well aware of the expectations of the
fans who will flock back to Parkhead this season following their sojourn
at Hampden. ''Expectations are always high here and maybe the arrival of
Andreas Thom has increased them further, but I think realistic
supporters will see that we still need two or three players. We are
trying to resolve that and progress is being made.''
However, he said he knew nothing of the possibility that Ilyan
Kiriakov, the Anorthosis midffield man who did well against Rangers in
the Champions' Cup preliminary round, would be offered to Celtic.
A report yesterday suggested that the Bulgarian would be available at
somewhere between #1m and #2m. ''We have not been offered the player,''
said Burns, although he added that he had been impressed with him in the
first leg at Ibrox.
Celtic will give new man John Hughes until the last minute to see if
he has recovered from an injury. If the former Falkirk player fails to
make it, Malcolm Mackay will take his place.
Raith have to do without Jason Dair, Ronnie Coyle, Barry Wilson, and
Stephen McAnespie because of injury, and Jim McInally is doubtful. Said
manager Jimmy Nicholl: ''The last time we made it to the premier
division we took seven games before we won. I hope we don't have to wait
that long this time.''
Hearts yesterday introduced their new coach, Paul Hegarty, who has
left Dundee United amicably to take over looking after the young players
at Tynecastle. Manager Jim Jefferies has to do without suspended striker
John Robertson. New man Alan Lawrence is likely to be on the bench,
while Neil Berry is added to the squad for the visit of Motherwell.
The Fir Park manager, Alex McLeish, will have Tommy Coyne back after
he missed the 2-0 win over MyPa 47 in midweek, but may still keep Alex
Burns in the side.
Falkirk face Aberdeen at Brockville and for Pittodrie strikers Eoin
Jess and Scott Booth there will be the added incentive that Scotland
manager Craig Brown will be watching.
''It was disappointing to lose my place with Scotland,'' said Jess,
''I'd love to be involved once again but only I can show I'm worth it.''
Manager Roy Aitken said: 'The arrival of a new manager always brings a
freshness and John Lambie's teams are always well organised and
difficult to beat. I'd settle now for the same performance and the same
result as we had in our final league game last season when we won 2-0.''
Defenders Gary Smith and Colin Woodthorpe are back after injury but
striker Duncan Shearer is still suspended.
Lambie, who will be without Steve Fulton, Paul McGrillen and David
Weir, added: ''Last season was a one-off. Aberdeen won't be in that
position again. I would tip them to be in the top four come next May.''
The man who succeeded Lambie at Partick Thistle, Murdo MacLeod, finds
himself matching tactics with Hibs and the man to whom he was assistant
manager, Alex Miller, in his first game in the division. Miller has a
load of personnel worries. Five players are out, Keith Wright and Gareth
Evans who are injured, and three who are suspended, Gordon Hunter, David
Farrell and Willie Miller.

ALEX McAnespie's Stranraer, believed to have been promoted well above
their abilities under the league reconstruction exercise just over a
year ago, have the opportunity to silence critics by emerging from among
their peers at the end of the season.
By finishing top of the old second division last summer, Stranraer
jumped up to the second tier of 10 clubs under the new arrangements,
while passing them -- on the way down -- were such as Morton, Dumbarton,
and Clyde.
Stranraer began this campaign with a goalless draw against Berwick,
and McAnespie sent his strikers out for some extra shooting practice as
a consequence. He realises that if his men are to prove a point among
Scotland's middleweight clubs, they will have to find the net regularly.
Challenges do not come much harder than the one they face today at the
home of Stenhousemuir.
Tommy Campbell's Forfar, last season's third-division champions, will
find out what life is like in the second division when they tackle Alex
Smith's Clyde -- Charlie Nicholas and all -- at Broadwood.
One of the teams who took the drop to the basement last term,
Meadowbank, have been resurrected, Phoenix-like, as Jim Leishman's
all-conquering Livingston. After having taken the scalps of St Johnstone
and Morton in cup exploits, they are back to picking on people their own
size in the third division. Today it is Arbroath's turn to face them, at
Gayfield.

COLIN Montgomerie felt he could have scored in the 50s yesterday, but
it was fellow-Scot Gary Orr, with his lowest round of three seasons on
tour, who set a course-record eight-under-par 63 to claim a share of the
halfway lead at the Volvo German Open in Stuttgart.
Orr, the 1993 rookie of the year, grabbed an eagle and six birdies to
move to 10-under par, the same as Welshman Paul Affleck (68), and
Australian Paul Moloney (65).
Montgomerie, whose 64 left him one off the pace, says he keeps waking
up at night thinking about putts he missed before losing a play-off to
Australian Steve Elkington in the US PGA championship a fortnight ago.
Things have not changed in this, his very next event. ''That could
have been in the 50s,'' he said. ''The putts are just not going in and
I'm telling myself it's just a matter of time. But whereas the rest of
my game has improved 100% in the last couple of years, my putting has
gone back 40%.''
On the same score as Montgomerie are two other Scots, Gordon Brand Jr
(66), and Sam Torrance (65).
Ian Woosnam, meanwhile, set out yesterday with two putters -- one
short, one long. After switching between them with little success his
round added up to 69, the same as his first. Needing to finish fifth or
maybe higher to be sure of a seventh Ryder Cup cap next month, he has a
real mountain to climb. Of Bernard Gallacher's two wild cards, one is
already in Nick Faldo's pocket and the other looks earmarked for Jose
Maria Olazabal, despite fitness worries
Woosnam was one of 19 players battling for five available cup spots.
Now, after the halfway cut, it is 13 chasing four spots. Out went Miguel
Angel Jimenez, Pierre Fulke, Jarmo Sandelin, Alexander Cejka, Russell
Claydon, and Peter Baker.
Yorkshire's Howard Clark and Swede Per-Ulrik Johansson, currently in
the side, will spend an anxious weekend at home after missing the cut as
well. Johansson was ninth, but he has been overtaken by Ireland's Philip
Walton, who lies five under following a 69, but is not safe yet.
Sixth-placed David Gilford is, though, after a 67 swept the Crewe
29-year-old to seven under par.
Gilford, on his debut four years ago, lost foursomes games with
Montgomerie and Nick Faldo and then was left out of the singles.

FORMER Stirling University student Elaine Ratcliffe had victory in the
British Women's Strokeplay championship at Sandwich snatched by a
little-known Spaniard yesterday as high winds blew most competitors off
course.
The England internationalist was overnight halfway leader, but slumped
to closing rounds of 77 and 72 across the 6129-yard linksland course as
18-year-old Maria Jose Pons, from Valencia, stormed to her first major
tournament victory by three shots.
Pons, a pharmaceutical student, helped the Spanish national team to
beat England in the semi-final and Scotland in the final of the European
team championship in the last month.
She also played her part in the victory of the Continent of Europe
over Great Britain and Ireland in the Vagliano Trophy match at Ganton,
three weeks ago.
Pons was the only player to break the par of 72 over the shortened
Open Championship course, producing excellent rounds of 71 and a closing
70 for a one-over-par four-round aggregate of 288. Past champion Joanne
Hockley of Felixstowe Ferry finished five strokes adrift.
Scottish Ladies' champion Hilary Monaghan was the sole Scottish
survivor and she closed with rounds of 76 and 78 for an aggregate of
311. Leading scores:
289 -- M Pons (Spain) 71, 70.
292 -- E Ratcliffe (Sandiway) 74, 69, 77, 72.
294 -- J Hockley (Felixstowe Ferry) 74, 71.

75, 75, 73, 74.
298 -- K Stupples (Royal Cinque Ports) 73, 75, 77, 73.

one better in this year's City of Aberdeen Doug Sanders world junior
championship at Newmachar, near Aberdeen.
In wet, windy conditions, Gleeson's two rounds of 75 for an
eight-over-par aggregate of 150 over a tough course were good enough to
give him a three-shot lead to carry into tomorrow's final 36 holes.

COLLINGTREE SENIORS
NEIL Coles, winner of 28 titles worldwide and a further eight on the
PGA European Seniors Tour, is poised to add another after moving into a
share of the lead in the Collingtree Seniors tournament.
The 60-year-old former Ryder Cup star shot a level-par 72 in the
second round at Collingtree Park in Northampton for a one-under-par
total of 143 -- the same score as Spain's Francisco Abreu who added a 73
to his opening 70.
Another former Ryder Cup man, seniors rookie Maurice Bembridge, posted
a 71 -- one of only two scores to beat par in tough windy conditions --
to stand a shot behind the joint-leaders on level-par 144.
Scotland's David Huish also managed a 71 for a share of third place on
145. But overnight leader Brian Huggett of Wales was blown from
five-under-par at the start to one-over 145 following a 78.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
143 -- F Abreu (Spain) 70, 73; N Coles 71, 72.
144 -- M Bembridge 73, 71.

WHILE French hopes in the Teacher's Round Britain Challenge were
dashed after their boat Belle Helene skippered by Jean-Philippe Saliou
struck rocks on the shore at Turnberry Point -- requiring the rescue of
the crew of eight by helicopter -- Scotland's Jon Fitzgerald and Paul
Jeffes clawed their way back into contention, finishing third and fifth
respectively.
With south-westerley winds gusting to more than 40 knots, Scots boats
Glendronach, driven alternately by Chris Nichol and Fitzgerald, and Lord
Inverforth, with Jeffes and Chris Owen sharing helming duties, both
worked hard through Thursday night.
The Scots improved on entering home waters. Lying seventh, Jeffes
passed Welsh boat Celtic Dragon (Colin Lyons) off Stranraer and then
overtook Ireland's Positively Belfast on the two circuits in the Clyde
-- between DZ buoy -- off the Heads of Ayr and Ailsa Craig, and then
Hamilton Rock by Lamlash and Hunterston.
Fitzgerald finally overturned a six-mile deficit over England's Vivien
Cherry and was 20 minutes ahead by the Rothesay finish line, just before
7am yesterday. Ireland's David Harte was first to finish at 11.05pm on
Thursday.
Still lying second overall, the Scots are now only two points behind
Wales and the mood is extremely buoyant: ''We're very happy with our
result on this leg,'' enthused Glendronach's Chris Nichol. ''To have
rallied from the back end of the fleet off Wales proves we can be in
contention in the more solid breezes. The crews on both our boats worked
tirelessly through last night.''
Sailing towards DZ buoy, the French yacht was knocked flat by a
40-knot squall while dropping their spinnaker. On its side for more than
10 minutes and drifting sideways, it quickly hit rocks and, 40 minutes
later, came to rest close to Turnberry Point in poor visibility. The
crew were airlifted from the rocks at just before midnight. Results:
1, Dream of Erin (D Harte) Ireland 23-06-06 (24/8); 2, Pride of
Cardiff (R Tudor) Wales 4-37-00 25/8; 3, Glendronach (J Fitzgerald)
6-37-40; 4, Spirit of London Docklands (V Cherry) England 7-00-07; 5,
Lord Inverforth (P Jeffes) Scotland 7-08-03; 6, Positively Belfast (D
Gomes) Ireland 7-11-45; 7, Celtic Dragon (C Lyons) Wales 7-58-33.
Overall after two legs -- 1, Wales 18pts; 2, Scotland 20; 3, Ireland
23.75.

BRITAIN'S hopes of automatic entry into the Atlanta Olympics, on the
back of England winning the Nissan European Nations Men's Hockey Cup,
ended in disappointment yesterday when England lost 2-1 in the
semi-final to Holland.
Britain must now contest a qualifying tournament in Barcelona in
January, although they will have grounds for optimism, with England
ranked in the top four in Europe.
But they were swamped in the first half when the Dutch netted both
their goals. After the break Calum Giles cut the deficit from a corner,
but their fightback lacked penetration.
Holland's opponents in tomorrow's finals will be defending champions
Germany, who have won three of the six previous finals, but they will
have great difficulty in wresting the title from the great rivals.
Poland and Ireland have secured automatic entry into the 1998 finals
in Italy when they disposed of Wales and Spain respectively in their
opening classification matches.
Scotland return to duty this morning with a place in the first
qualifying tournament in the World Cup as their target. They must finish
above either Switzerland or France to be sure of advancement. Results:
Semi-finals: Holland 2, England 1; Germany 4, Belgium 0. Places 5/8:
Ireland 3, Spain 1; Poland 3, Wales 1.

AN admirable degree of enterprise by England's batsmen, mainly through
the determined efforts of an in-form Graeme Hick and a resurgent Jack
Russell, brought a first innings total which is substantial enough at
454 not only to subject the West Indies to enormous pressure, but indeed
to take this final Test of the series at least towards safety for
England after only the second day.
The West Indies response in the final session came in the most
positive fashion with Stuart Williams taking three boundaries from Devon
Malcolm's opening over, and then in his next he was hit successfully to
the cover boundary. It took the tourists just 13 overs to reach 50 for
one at stumps, but Williams was unlucky to be given caught behind.
In the England innings earlier, the West Indies' pace attack, which
Mike Atherton's men reeling before close of play on the first day, was
made to look almost innocuous with the application demonstrated by
England's sixth-wicket pair.
Hick was a little uncertain at the start, offering a sharp low chance
to short square leg in only the second over, but having resumed on his
overnight score of 43, he didn't take long to reach his thirteenth Test
half-century. He played an elegant drive off Walsh to reach 49 and then
turned the next ball to mid-wicket for his 50.
Both Russell and Hick scored briskly at a run a minute in the first
hour, in complete contrast to England's rate of scoring on the first
day. Hick's stroke-play was delightful throughout his innings and his
perfect timing was evident in one particular shot to the backward square
leg boundary off Walsh, when he merely guided the ball on its way
without going through with the full stroke.
Curtly Ambrose, who has bowled better now towards the end of the tour
on a good wicket, than he has at any time in this series, replaced Ian
Bishop and beat Hick with one which seamed away. His next ball brought a
difficult high chance to the wicketkeeper, who just got a hand to it but
the ball sped to the third-man boundary on the parched outfield.
Off spinner Carl Hooper was brought on with the double change in the
West Indian attack, and in his second over, Hick drove him square for
four to get into the seventies. Runs came more rapidly for Hick during
that period as he demonstrated his customary ease against spin bowlers
before becoming one of Ken Benjamin's three victims.
His innings, just four short of a fourth Test century, ended with the
West Indians claiming an important wicket immediately before lunch,
exactly as they had done in the first innings with the dismissal the
England captain.
Michael Watkinson, who was given more lives than any cat has ever been
favoured with (he was missed three times off Walsh alone) enabled Walsh
to reach a personal milestone of 300 Test wickets. Walsh, playing in his
eightieth Test, became the tenth man in Test history to join the elite
club.
An apparent confrontation, a physical contact, during the England
innings between Ambrose and Dominic Cork, seemed to cause concern, but
the match referee issued a statement later dismissing the incident as an
accident.
It did not, however, deter Russell from continuing to graft his way
towards a second Test century, but he fell just nine short on the stroke
of tea with England on 419 for eight.
It was the England keeper's second dismissal in Tests in the nervous
nineties.
He had, nevertheless, done enough, particularly with his 144-run
partnership earlier with Hick, to take England towards a very
considerable total. Scoreboard:

SCOTLAND just failed to pull off a sensational win against MCC in
Aberdeen yesterday.
In a dramatic finish, Iain Philip's side fell just one wicket short
after the skipper's declaration had set up an intriguing contest.
Continuing 159 runs ahead, Scotland's batsmen scored briskly in the
morning, with George Reifer again in scintillating form and Neil MacRae
finishing unbeaten on 42.
Philip's declaration left MCC requiring 254 in just under 60 overs,
and while classy opener Carl Rogers was at the crease it looked
possible. His 117 included three mighty 6s and seven 4s.
But he took one liberty too many and was stumped by Alec Davies off
Jim Govan. The same combination also accounted for Bobby Parks and Alan
Lewis, the latter having scored with 37 off 55 balls.
Ferguslie's Stuart Kennedy weighed in with two wickets and a vital
catch to remove captain Paul Parker as the Scots scented an unlikely
win.
And when the ninth wicket fell with 2.4 overs remaining, Philip posted
eight fielders round the bat but failed to unnerve the obdurate Gordon
Harris. Scores:
Scotland 281 and 107-2 dec (N MacRae 42no, G Reifer 42); MCC 133-3 dec
and 213-9 (C Rogers 117, A Lewis 37; J Govan 4-74).

LINFORD Christie last night defeated world 100 metres champion Donovan
Bailey for the second time in 10 days, a win which was as crucial for
his bank balance as his pride.
Christie produced another powerful display at the Brussels Grand Prix
meeting to storm home in 10.08sec. The victory over Bailey at last
week's Zurich meeting and in Bergium helped 35-year-old Christie prove
he is still a major force in sprinting.
It also kept him in the running for the most lucrative prize in
athletics -- a jackpot of $250,000 in gold bars. Athletes who win their
events in all Golden Four meetings in Oslo, Zurich, Brussels, and Berlin
earn a share of the jackpot. After his victory, Christie heads for
Berlin next week with a superb chance of getting his hands on the gold.
Scotland's Liz McColgan trailed in a well-beaten sixth in the women's
5000m won by Sonia O'Sullivan in 14min.50.69sec, with McColgan clocking
15-14.67.
O'Sullivan finished 40m clear but her attack on Fernanda Ribeiro's
world record ran out of steam.
Mozambique's Maria Mutola broke the women's 1000 metres world record,
picking up prizes worth $50,000 when finishing in a time of
2min.29.34sec.
Britain's Jonathan Edwards took the triple jump with 17.28m.

JOSE Maria Olazabal continued to play impressive golf in spite of a
painful foot injury as he moved into equal second place after the second
round of the $2m World Series in Akron, Ohio, yesterday.
The Spaniard compiled an even-par 70 in demanding conditions on the
Firestone course, where rock-hard greens sent scores soaring.
Leader Jim Gallagher, shot 71 for a three-under-par 137 halfway total.
Nick Faldo was five behind, but Scot Andrew Coltart, who played with
Open champion John Daly, was last after a 78.
The big news continued to be the controversy involving Greg Norman and
Mark McCumber. Norman claims he saw McCumber touch the line of his putt
on the seventh green during Thursday's first round. McCumber said he was
removing an insect.
Yesterday, Norman said: ''I'm 100% correct.'' McCumber countered:
''What Greg thought he saw is not what happened.'' Leading scores
(Americans unless stated):
137 -- J Gallagher 66, 71.
138 -- B Mayfair 70, 68; J M Olazabal (Spain) 68, 70; M Sullivan 71,

(Australia) 73, 68; N Price (Zimbabwe) 72, 69; Payne Stewart 67, 74.
Other scores included: 142 -- N Faldo (England) 71, 71. 144 -- M
McCumber 68, 76. 148 -- W Riley (Australia) 73, 75. 151 -- J Daly 78,

THE International Rugby Football Board, which for too long now has
resembled a piece of flotsam swept along on the tide with the wreckage
of the good ship Amateurism, must grasp the final opportunity today to
regain control in its own house.
As the IB meets for the third and last day of its Paris congress -- a
momentous meeting designed to guide the game into the new
professionalised millenium -- it drinks in the Last Chance Saloon.
For more than a decade, the IB has been almost an irrelevance as
significant and powerful elements within its constituency have driven
coach, horses, and all the rest through its amateurism regulations.
Too late, the board decided that this was indeed the case. For much of
last year, a four-man working party on amateurism comprising Scotland's
Freddie McLeod, Bernard Lapasset of France, Vernon Pugh of Wales, and
Rob Fisher of New Zealand scoured the oval globe and, in the words of
Pugh -- a Queen's Counsel in the real world -- discovered that the
''nature and extent of the breaches of the current regulations has been
found to be most concerning.''
The working party report -- which considered that the status quo was
no longer an option and that professionalism in some degree would have
to be countenanced -- was presented to the board when it met in Bristol
in March. However, it proved too big a bullet to bite and, scandalously,
the issue was fudged and a decision was postponed until this weekend in
Paris.
In March, Pugh -- with a degree of foresight that in truth merely
stated the obvious -- observed: ''The one thing not on our side is
time.'' How right he was. Within three months, the three Southern
Hemisphere unions which have all along been the most significant
transgressors of the amateurism code and the most belligerent in calling
for its repeal, signed a #370m broadcasting deal with Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation.
They now had a startling war-chest from which to pay their players
and, for instance, the All Blacks will now earn around #100,000 per man
for a season's work.
Simultaneously, Kerry Packer's World Rugby Corporation attempted an
audacious coup which, if successful, would have seen the world's top
1000 players on their books. Once the players had been bought, as
revealed in The Herald last week, WRC then intended to sell the game
back to the establishment in the form of franchises for the Scottish
Rugby Union and the like.
The takeover attempt failed only because the players -- certainly
those in the Southern Hemisphere -- had wrung monetary concessions from
their unions.
Freddie McLeod is absolutely right when he says that concrete
proposals must be delivered tomorrow. Another fudge will leave a bitter
taste.
The SRU has already set out its stall. It is in favour of a
professional game of sorts. It wants the devilish word ''amateur''
exorcised from the regulations. International players would be placed
under contract, and would be expected to work for the union by way of
marketing the game. Cash would be disbursed via a trust fund. Is this
pay-for-play which is the great stumbling block for many of the die-hard
members of the board.
It would be hypocritical to present it in any other way. International
players are likely to be paid because they are international players.
End of story.
The issue is no longer one of if the players will be paid, but rather
one of when, and what form those payments will take. The next great
issue is how much? Southern Hemisphere players, even in advance of this
weekend's meeting, have already negotiated five-figure deals. England's
players will receive at least #40,000 per season through a shirt
sponsor.
While the matter was being addressed in private by the SRU, the figure
of #35,000 per season for Scottish internationalists drifted into the
public domain. From whence it came, nobody will now say. However, it has
now been greeted by much sucking of teeth in Murrayfield circles. ''We
will pay what we can afford,'' says McLeod. He says the Scottish figure
is ''likely to be nearer #35,000'' than the 100 grand which Sean
Fitzpatrick will deposit in his New Zealand bank account. Now, we hear,
the figure being talked about is between #15,000 and #20,000.
Scotland, like England, are willing to sell the jerseys. A discrete
logo, says McLeod. Is a Scotland jersey worth less than an English one?
There will have to be some hard-nosed negotiation on this one if
Scottish players are not to feel like country cousins even in our own
Five Nations' championship.
If, as they must, the IB decides this weekend that they have little
choice but to embrace professionalism, then the way ahead is strewn with
traps and pitfalls. The World Rugby Corporation has gone away for now.
If the IB does not get it right in Paris today, then ''Packer, The
Sequel'' may already be in the making.

CALL me an old sweetheart but I can't help thinking that this year's
fixture list for the half-decent player will be an uncomfortable one in
the extreme. The leagues start next week, and, being a romantic, I've
been looking forward to them for ages, but it doesn't half look tough.
You see, despite being old and broken, I can still remember being
young and fresh, and even when I was young and fresh and running around
like Bambi, I was still sent home by my then boss on the occasional
Monday morning for walking around like a zombie and banging off the
walls with fatigue after games, Sunday sessions, and midweek training.
For this year's players it could become unbearable.
It was Jane Dunbar, the doctor who looks after last year's champions,
Stirling County, who sowed the seeds when she mentioned that, in her
opinion, it was going to be increasingly difficult for her players to
recover in between matches, especially now that there's the odd Sunday
and Wednesday game thrown in.
''Take Brian Ireland,'' she said. ''He has 10 stitches below and above
one of his eyes after a game earlier this week, and he is always getting
knocks. How is he going to be able to protect that kind of thing if he
may have to play again, during the season, after half a week instead of
having a whole week to recover?
''I think that it is going to be tough for us as medics to keep the
players fit, and it is going to be hard for them to keep themselves
tuned to play.''
Looking at the season, the third fixture in the programme is on a
Wednesday, there is an A game on the Sunday after a league match, and
there is a league match on a Sunday after an international.
There are district matches around and between league matches and an
international. Confused? No need, because all it means that some players
might be tempted to do more than is healthy, and put themselves and
their clubs at risk.
''It's going to get worse rather than better.'' says Donald MacLeod,
the convenor of the SRU medical committee. ''The challenges are now
going to get greater, and there seems to be a requirement for injuries
which had previously taken five to seven days to heal to be cured in two
or three days.
''It is imperative that clubs and players have access to quality
medical attention immediately, and that people understand that injuries
do need rest to heal. If someone wants to get fit quickly after, for
example, a slight ankle strain, then they must realise that they can't
stand at the bar after the game and have a few pints.
They have to go home.'' Aaaargh! The obvious corollary of it all to me
is that clubs involved in the higher echelons of the game must be
thinking in terms of using a squad system to rest crucial players more
in line with the way football clubs operate.
David McLean, the honorary fitness advisor to the Scottish team,
agrees: ''Rugby is like boxing,'' he says. ''The contact takes it out of
you. After games the players are going to feel sore, especially the
forwards. They won't get a chance to ease away the knocks like they used
to.
So, like football, the successful sides will have squads to pick from,
and the sides that pick up the least injuries will be the most
successful.''
And the knock-on effects will be devastating. Let's just say that the
IB vote for professionalism this weekend. Let's just say that the clubs
like it and put some of their players on contracts.
Well, what happens if the clubs want players to play a day after
internationals? Or the SRU want players to play the day after league
matches? Or the district wants a player to play midweek when he really
doesn't fancy it? Or a player, in order to earn his corn under his
contract with the SRU, has to go to Oban to promote rugby, and then is
expected to turn out for his club that night? All of this money has a
little down side to it I would reckon.
I have always looked at football and scoffed at players calling off
international matches with non-existent injuries -- a scandal really.
Could that happen now in rugby? After all, clubs may end up in a
position to exert undue force on players, and if clubs eventually
provide some bread and butter players then might they get that bit more
powerful? ''It should be remembered that when we prepared the players
for the World Cup, we asked them to play only once a week,'' says
McLean. ''That looks as though it isn't going to happen this year.
There's no doubt that the top players often feel that their club
training is a waste of time, too.
''I can now see the clubs exerting a bigger pull on them as the
leagues become more demanding, and when contracts arrive they will want
to players to fulfil their obligations.''
The message coming through is doing so loud and clear. This season,
players will have to appreciate that it takes months to prepare for a
game, and not a 10-minute warm up. They will also have to appreciate
that they are bound to become the centre of attraction in a tug of war
between their clubs and the SRU. And they also have to appreciate the
huge value of quality medical back up, and, importantly, bags of rest.
You know the ideal solution? Give up the day jobs. Only joking.

GLASGOW'S Gary Jacobs will have to climb his own Everest and produce
the biggest boxing shock of the decade if he is to become the WBC
welterweight champion of the world in Atlantic City tonight.
Throughout his professional career, the 29-year-old Scot has said it
is his destiny to win the title, and that he wanted to beat the best on
the planet to do so. In Pernell Whitaker, the 31-year-old master boxer
from Virginia, he is certainly meeting the best in a division which is
rich in talent.
Not since Ken Buchanan beat Ismael Laguna in 1970 has a Scottish boxer
won a world title on foreign soil, but Jacobs, who was reuinited with
wife Linda and little daughters Olivia and Jemma last night, is
convinced that his hour has come.
''I'm going to give the best performance of my life tomorrow night,''
he said. ''I know it will take that to beat Whitaker -- but this is it,
the pinnacle of my career.
''Whitaker has been the best for years and he is the one I have been
waiting for. He's a great fighter but tomorrow night when the first bell
rings, it will be just him and I in the ring, and I am going to win.''
Mickey Duff, the manager who has steered Jacobs to this challenge, was
for once drowned out by a boxer. But he did manage to get in a word or
two when he said: ''Thank God the training is over. Gary has been so
good it's frightening.''
Whitaker, however, has taken everything in his stride. Tomorrow night
will be his seventeenth world title fight and he has lost just one,
which was seven years ago.
Another was drawn against the legendary Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez in
1993, but few thought that Chavez deserved a share of the points.
Whitaker quite simply is awesome in skill and has a self belief which
matches that of the Scot.
I strolled along the boardwalk with the man and he told me: ''I'm
definitely going to win. I'm in the best shape since the Chavez fight --
both focused and more relaxed. Gary Jacobs deserves this chance of a
world title but he won't even come near to beating Pernell Whitaker. He
is good but he's not in the same class.
''What will happen when we get into the ring? I'm going to have some
fun. It's nothing personal, just business.''
0
Whitaker, while trying to convince us that the only thing on his mind
was the Jacobs challenge, slipped up when he announced to passing fans
that his next defence would be in November. And that could work in the
Scot's favour.
Jacobs is rated a no-hoper here and if Whitaker has been the slightest
bit lax in his preparation, then he could pay for it. The fact that he
has won world titles at four different weights makes him an overwhelming
favourite but Jacobs will give him a much toughter test than the
Americans believe.
Neither is noted as a heavy puncher, and with both men being
southpaws, it could be an awkward fight. Jacobs will find it difficult
to pin down a man who claims, with every justification, that he is the
best defensive boxer in the world, but Whitaker will seldom if ever have
come up against an opponent as fit and determined as the Scot.
Said Jacobs: ''If he thinks it's going to be fun, then that's fine
with me. I can assure you he won't be laughing when I walk away with the
championship belt. I've never been so sure of anything in my life.''
And Mickey Duff believes it too. He said: ''Despite all the
predictions from the Americans, Gary has a realistic chance of causing a
huge upset. Anyone who dismisses him is a fool.''
I certainly would not dismiss Jacobs, but despite all the confidence
and determination shown by the man from Glasgow, I have to go for the
champion to retain his title with a bit of style.
I hope I'm wrong.

LONDON Scottish, who meet Melrose at the Greenyards tomorrow in a
XV-a-side match, will attempt to add the CIS Selkirk sevens trophy to
their list of successes today.
This prize so far has eluded the exiles and they will be looking to
their new recruits, particularly Max Duthie, the former Cambridge
University and Rosslyn Park flanker, to right that omission.
Experience in the exiles' ranks comes from former Scotland World Cup
sevens scrum half Dave Millard, who will have former Harlequin Gavin
Thompson and ex-Saracen Malcolm Kemp and skipper Simon Holmes playing
outside him.
Craig Joiner joins Graham Shiel in a powerful-looking Melrose side
which failed to do itself justice at Poynder Park last week.
Kelso, who won their own sevens last weekend, make one change to their
line-up, Doug Baird coming in for Ian Macarthur who now has joined GHK.
Draw (first tie 2pm):
Gala v Newcastle Gosforth; Jed-Forest v Peebles; Kelso v Langholm;
Waterloo v Stirling County; London Scottish v Hawick YM; Selkirk v
Wigton; Wakefield v Melrose; Hawick v Edinburgh Borderers.

TARTAN has been a mixed blessing to Cowal Highland Gathering. It was
always the main attraction -- the skirl of the pipes, the swirl of the
dancers' kilts. But tartan has latterly spelt the death of its proud
athletics tradition.
In Cowal's heyday, the black ash, and latterly red blaes of the track,
provided one of the finest surfaces in Scotland.
Urged on by crowds of up to 30,000, Olympic sprinters and endurance
men flocked to Dunoon, attracted by its quality cinders, and the chance
of good times. And not just on the track.
World mile record-holder Derek Ibbotson was a regular visitor. Norman
Gregor set two Scottish pole-vault records there; so, too, did David
Stevenson. Mike Lindsay had a shot-putt record, and there were national
bests from sprinters Les Piggott and Ming Campbell, at 75 and 150 yards
respectively. Mike McLean achieved another at 600 yards, Hugh Barrow one
at the three-quarter mile, Robert Graham at two miles. Ian Binnie and
Lachie Stewart set several records at various distances.
But the advent of all-weather tartan tracks, which produce faster
times, heralded terminal decline. Cinders, like grass, is an
anachronism.
0
The Dunoon meeting once ranked just behind Rangers Sports among the
biggest events on the Scottish programme. Cowal drew crowds whose size
puts modern grand-prix athletics, with budgets of millions of dollars,
and TV coverage, in the shade.
Almost inevitably, six years ago, track events were axed, although
throws continued. But today, Cameron Spence, from the Greenock club, IBM
Spango Valley, attempts to resuscitate the running games.
The former Irish cross-country internationalist has a modest budget.
''I've #1000, but I reckon I've managed to put together as good a field
for the scratch 3000 metres as we've had in Scotland all year,'' he
said.
Internationalists Tom Murray, Robert Quinn, Chris Robison, John
Mackay, Adrian Callan, and Steven Wylie are included in an excellent
line-up. Most will also do the handicap mile.
Spence's elder brother, George, is heavy events convener, and has nine
leading amateur and professional throwers, including Bill Sutherland
from the USA.
Entries will be accepted today (athletics starts at 2.30). There are
also sprint handicaps for both sexes, plus young athletes' handicaps at
100, 200 and 1000m.
Lachie Stewart, the 1970 Commonwealth 10,000m champion, who set
Scottish records at 11 and 12 miles, and the one-hour run there in 1967,
recalls how athletics always played second fiddle to the pipes. Once,
the runners almost jumped through the big drum to escape being mown
down. ''The bands marched on to the track during the 3000m,'' he said.
''There was nowhere to go -- it was mayhem.''
But the most amazing record of all came in 1953. That Ian Binnie
should turn down a Great Britain vest, declining to race against Germany
at the White City, says much for Cowal's status. The Glasgow draughtsman
had promised to tackle the one-hour run.
At each stage from seven miles -- 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 miles, plus
one-hour -- Binnie broke the Scottish, British, and Empire all-comers'
records, failing only narrowly to beat Emile Zatopek's world mark.

TEN times Scottish champions Hawick, who defeated Ballymena 53-26 in a
pre-season friendly at Mansfield Park last night, are investigating the
possibility of setting up a trust fund for their players.
The Greens, who have developed a wide-ranging commercial initiative
during the close-season, with all but two of their Tennents Premierships
games attracting sponsorship and a have in place a scheme for indidual
player sponsorship, are examining the tax implications of a plan
intended to bring more players to Mansfield Park and encourage them to
stay throughout their playing careers.
Secretary John Thorburn said: ''It's too early to say much more about
it other than that it is being designed to reward loyalty at the end of
a career rather than on an annual basis. Hopefully -- in light of the IB
meeting this weekend -- this would retain some of the principles of
amateurism but not leave the players financially disadvantaged.''

CHAPELTOUN House, Stewarton, off the B769 Stewarton to Irvine road, is
well worth a visit. Chapeltoun itself was originally an ancient place of
worship, so a good food pilgrimage would be much in keeping.
Owned by Colin and Graeme McKenzie, whose family have a well-known
establishment further north near Culloden, the country house hotel is
featured in all the major guides, including the Michelin, for its
quality food and high standards.
The present Chapeltoun House was built at the turn of the century in a
Scottish arts and crafts style in 20-acres of park and woodland for a
local industrialist and his English wife. A rose and thistle theme can
still be seen in various parts of the building, and there are headstones
for the family pets in the gounds.
Antique furniture and fittings add a period touch. The Annick Water
flows through the bottom of the garden, with trout and even salmon to be
caught.
The eight bedrooms have individual characteristics and ensuite
facilities, the larger master rooms have bay windows looking over the
Annick Valley to the Clyde coast with the Isle of Arran in the distance.
Winter Warmer weekend rates are #99 per night for two including dinner,
bed and hearty breakfast.
An excellent introduction to Chapeltoun House hospitality is the black
tie gourmet dinner evening on Friday September 22, which includes four
wines from Burgundy chosen and presented by Bryce Fraser of Corney &amp;
Barrow. At #28 a ticket, and with only 26 places in all, book on 01560
482696.
Head chef Tom O'Donnel is in charge of the kitchen, and lunch is
served daily from 12 until 2pm and dinner from 7 until 9 pm. There is
also a lunch-time bar menu with any two courses for #6.90 and three for
#8.90. Portions are generous. The wine list has 150 different wines from
around the world.
Lunch at #15.90 for three courses, coffee and dinner at #19.90 for two
courses and coffee, or #23.80 for three courses and coffee represent
excellent value for money.
The philosophy of the full plateful prevails and presentation is
pleasing. I've never eaten such pinkly, tender rack of lamb in Scotland
before with a rosemary scented essence and a confit of baby leeks.

A CLOSE scrutiny of credit control procedures and practices is being
undertaken by Scottish livestock auctioneers John Swan &amp; Sons in the
wake of the British Beef collapse.
''No-one should be unduly worried however by this move,'' Lewis
McGill, recently installed chairman, was quick to assure the farming
community.
Speaking after the company's annual meeting at its New Mart Road
Edinburgh Gorgie headquarters, he said: ''We could not have anticipated
we would have become a victim of one of the biggest company failures in
the meat industry.
''The collapse of British Beef has had a major impact on our results
this year.'' Shareholders were entitled to ask why this major customer
was allowed to run up such a large debt, he added.
''But the fact remains that their terms of trading were no different
from any other wholesale customer.'' The British Beef collapse was
considered a one-off.
Shareholders of the south-east livestock auctioneers and estate
agents, with John Swan both owning and operating marts in Edinburgh and
Newton St Boswells, obviously understood the nature of the dilemma for
not one question was asked on the subject at the meeting.
Mr McGill pointed out that the farming community had to appreciate
that if it wished the facility of prompt payment through the market,
then market operators had to finance the meat industry, and that there
was a price to pay for that facility.
The year's results involved a #132,000 provision in full for the
British Beef debt plus exceptional property repairs totally #32,000. Any
recovery made in respect of the debt would be credited in the current
financial year.
Numbers of stock handled by John Swan showed small increases, which
was against the national trend. If this situation continued and there
were no material falls in stock value then profits should return to
normal levels.
For the record, profits for 1994-95 after taxation totalled #152,399,
with the meeting agreeing that it be divided up as a dividend of 18p and
9p per share on the Ordinary and deferred shares respectively be paid
(#120,960), with profits retained of the remaining #31,439.
The post-balance sheet situation showed no significant events
affecting John Swan &amp; Sons since April 30 last, the meeting was told.

MEMBERS of the Highlands and Islands Sheep Health Association have
welcomed the introduction of a new vaccine to combat enzootic abortion
in ewes, but they still maintain prevention is better than cure.
The association has spent the last six years trying to make producers
throughout the UK aware of the disease -- and its financial
implications. It fears that advertisements for the new vaccine may lull
farmers into a false sense of security.
''We welcome any efforts to fight the scourge of enzootic abortion but
the advertisements do not paint a full picture,'' said Brian Macdonald,
the association's development officer.
''The bottom line is that every female sheep brought on to a farm can
be a carrier -- including young lambs which are the progeny of a carrier
or which have been in contact with a carrier ewe around lambing time.''
The association's advice is that the only way to keep the disease out
of flocks is for farmers to purchase female sheep from producers who can
provide certificates confirming that the animals come from flocks which
are free of the disease.
''There are large numbers of sheep available from Scottish flocks
which have been subject to rigorous blood testing and monitoring
programmes carried out by Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary
Services,'' said Barty Synge, regional veterinary officer at Thurso.
''Only when sheep in such flocks have been monitored and found free of
EAE for two years or more can they be sold as EAE accredited, with
flockmasters able to pass on accreditation to buyers.''
The association's advice to farmers who already have the disease in
their flocks is to buy EAE accredited sheep and vaccinate them before
allowing them contact with infected animals. It warns that even
vaccination does not normally prevent the shedding of organisms which
can spread the disease and pose risk to pregnant women who come in
contact with sheep.
Alvin Cerely, marketing director of Mycofarm UK, which is advertising
its Enzovax product extensively in the farming press, said that they did
not dispute the fact that it made sense to buy clean sheep. Not everyone
did buy clean sheep, however, and if there was already a problem within
a flock the farmer should be vaccinating his sheep in any case.
He disagreed with the association on the effectiveness of vaccination
in combatting the shedding of infected organisms. ''It does have a
significant effect,'' he said.
''We already know that abortion will cost the sheep industry between
#30m and #35m this year.''
During their vaccine trials Mycofarm found that four out of five
flocks carried either an enzootic infection or toxoplasmosis, the two
most common causes of abortion. What they cannot forecast is which
flocks will be hit heavily and which will escape serious losses.
Mr Cerely said that because abortion struck before there was a living
lamb to lose farmers seemed to overlook the financial implications. The
problem was either not recognised or ignored in favour of treating more
obvious problems.
''This is one problem that will not go away if it is ignored,'' he
said. ''On the contrary, it will become more problematic and costly with
every year that passes.''
* UK EXPORTS of lamb are continuing on a generally upward trend as
trade with France remains strong. Spain is also taking more lamb each
week and, since the beginning of July this has been reflected in the
super light lamb price at markets -- averaging in excess of 100p a kg
liveweight.
At that price super light lambs were commanding a 10p premium over
standard weight lambs, said the Meat and Livestock Commission. Trade
with Spain is expected to increase throughout the autumn.

MANWEB yesterday denied it was banking on a referral of
ScottishPower's hostile bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
after turning down another request from the Glasgow-based utility for
talks.
ScottishPower believes South Western Electricity's decision to accept
US company Southern's increased offer of 965p a share should persuade
Manweb's board to recommend its bid, the shares-plus-cash terms of which
are now worth 974p.
However, Manweb claims ScottishPower's shares-plus-cash offer
represents 10.6-times-adjusted earnings, compared with the
11.5-times-earnings implicit in Southern's bid for Sweb. The
Chester-based company claims the 915p cash alternative represents only
9.9-times-earnings.
Manweb chief executive John Roberts said: ''There can be no point in
discussing with ScottishPower an offer which fundamentally undervalues
Manweb. It is disingenuous for ScottishPower to claim that its mean
offer should now be considered a full one.''
David Vernon-Smith, corporate affairs director of Manweb, denied that
the company was waiting for the MMC to come to its rescue.
He said: ''We have always made it absolutely plain that we were going
to defend this without having to rely on any reference to the MMC.
''There are issues to be considered by the appropriate bodies but we
have not worked on the basis that an MMC referral is the only defence we
have got. We have never tried to hide behind that at all.''
However, Manweb is hoping that Ian Lang, President of the Board of
Trade, will announce whether or not the bid is being referred sooner
rather than later, thus removing the uncertainty.
The company has another three weeks to unveil a lucrative package for
shareholders, along the lines of that used by Northern in its defence
against Trafalgar House.

THE second agreed bid in the electricity sector was signalled
yesterday when South Western Electricity (Sweb) agreed revised terms
from Southern Co. of the US worth 965p per share.
This reinforces ScottishPower's position in its battle with Manweb,
given that its share and cash offer is currently worth 974p with the
recent improvement in ScottishPower's share price.
The Sweb bid puts a clear limit on the value of Manweb. The latter
argues that ScottishPower's offer is worth 10.6 times earnings per
share, against the 11.5 times being offer for Sweb and 13 times for
Eastern (from Hanson). But it is hard to see Manweb really being worth
over #10 given that it was considered one of the weakest of the
distributors.
Before the bid fever began, Sweb was rated a little higher than
Manweb, having a yield of 4.7% against 5.1%, though neither was among
the first rank of the power distributors. This is in fact probably why
they were among the first to be bid for as the predators recognised that
more could be squeezed from them.
Hanson's agreed offer for Eastern was 975p cash but Eastern is
considered among the best.
ScottishPower's 915p cash alternative certainly looks too low and a
sweetener would no doubt do the trick if Manweb was not so alienated.
Its only real defence now is to press on stubbornly with its cash back
plan and hope for a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
One wonders if ScottishPower would not have done better by being less
aggressive and trying for an agreed bid, which might even have ended up
being cheaper. It would certainly have involved much less hassle and
attracted a smaller risk of a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
In addition, integration would have been easier had the drawbridge
been voluntarily lowered rather than stormed by force. As it was the
offer apparently came out of the blue as much to Manweb's directors as
the stock market. There was no prior contact.
The agreed bid for Sweb is worth 7% more than Southern's first 900p
attempt which was rejected. The group had hoped to find a white knight
in its neighbour, Southern Electric, and had even agreed a price of over
#10. But as soon as the tentative offer was made it was withdrawn
because the regulator wouldn't give it the nod. The higher price was
justifiable because of the larger scope for rationalisation benefits.
Manweb claims the same reason for being worth more to ScottishPower,
though the companies' areas are not contiguous so the benefits would be
less. Vertical integration is not possible as ScottishPower would not be
allowed to supply Manweb's customers direct.
The Southern bid consists of 900p cash plus a special dividend of 65p.
As many of Sweb's 100,000 shareholders are non-taxpayers or hold their
shares in a PEP, this dividend is worth 81p to them.
In addition, shareholders will retain Sweb's 20.3p final dividend,
payable in October. They can opt to receive loan notes instead of cash
or alternative terms of cash, the special dividend plus National Grid
shares when the latter is floated.
Sweb's non-executive chairman Maurice Warren will resign when the deal
gows through. Although Southern says it admires Sweb chief executive
John Seed and hopes he will remain a consultant it intends to put in its
own man. Mr Seed is in line for a #350,000 payoff and also has share
options but these amount to only #350,000 worth for the whole board.
Southern is also interested in acquiring some of the generating
capacity of National Power and PowerGen which the industry regulator
Professor Stephen Littlechild has ordered them to divest to increase
competition.
Sweb shares jumped 36p to 948p and the electricity sector was a little
firmer. Manweb rose 6p to 893p but remain way below the ScottishPower
bid on fears of a monopolies reference. The offer for Sweb is considered
no more likely to be referred than Hanson's for Eastern because it is an
outside bidder.
But bids within the sector are another thing, with the regulator,
Professor Stephen Littlechild, not keen. However, it will be perverse if
outsiders are allowed a free hand at the expense of insiders when the
cost savings in the latter case will be more significant.
There is another point -- do we want part of an essential industry to
be foreign owned? For long-term strategic rather than chauvinistic
reasons this is an issue which should receive attention. So if there is
to be a monopolies reference all the bids should be referred on grounds
of national interest if nothing else.

THE Proclaimers were close enough with their song Sunshine on Leith.
It was sunshine in Hanover Street in Edinburgh, and only two square
metres of it that kept 10 netsurfers hooked to the World Wide Web at
Cyberia, the city's first cyber-cafe.
Admittedly it was a sunny day when Greenpeace used a solar generator
to power up the cyber-cafe's computers in a demonstration of the oldest
power known to man. Greenpeace were also launching their own internet
page designed to provide a direct access to information on solar power,
new solar inventions and to take a swipe at the industries and
politicians responsible for blocking the development of solar power.
Last week Frontiers showed you the experimental Ecostar post van which
runs on the new generation of sodium sulphur high-storage batteries, and
the US experiments on electrochemical power, both of which represent
major advances in power generation and storage.
The Greenpeace solar array is another example of major leaps forward
in eco-friendly generation. It uses the power of the sun to create
electricity, just like every other power source, except it does it a lot
faster. Coal and oil-fired stations use materials which soaked up the
sun millions of years ago. Nuclear fuel comes from elements created in
stars billions of years ago. Solar panels just soak up the heat and
light as it comes and power comes out. When you consider that the sun
powers the whole of the planet's weather system, it's clear that there's
a lot of solar power available.
The green commandos say that in half an hour enough of the sun's
energy is received by the earth to power humankind's activities for a
whole year.
Their panel at Cyberia only swiped a few square meters of the heavenly
bounty, but that was enough to power up 10 PCs which in turn allowed 10
users to communicate with other folk at the other side of the world.
One might consider that Death Valley in Arizona, or the Kalahari
Desert might be ideal places to set up solar rays, and indeed they are,
but even in Scotland, and despite the unseasonal appearance of the sun
in summertime, there's enough sun to make solar panels an attractive
proposition.
Corin Millais of Greenpeace said: 'By powering the Internet we have
demonstrated that solar power works in Scotland.''
At Cyberia, owner Gavin Nicholson confesses to being impressed. ''I
expected the generators to be much larger, but they managed to power my
entire set of systems from only four small panels. I could see that they
worked immediately, but I understand that the panels can be hooked to
batteries to store the power for when it's dark. I'd be very interested
to see whether the panels could be used to generate power for the cyber
cafe on a full-time basis.
''It might be difficult, though, to persuade the council to let me
site panels on the roof of a listed building in Hanover Street.''
It's the reaction of business and bureaucrats to solar generation that
has sparked the Greenpeace campaign on the Internet because of their
concern for global pollution from power generation by what have become
known as conventional means.
Greenpeace say that one single photo-voltaic panel can produce enough
electricity to power a television. Forty can power a house and solar
panels installed on buildings throughout the UK could provide as much
electricity as is needed to supply the whole country. The cost, they
add, had dropped a hundredfold in the past 20 years, though it is still
a fairly expensive way of generating electricity. That cost, however,
does not include the environmental damage from power stations. Neither
does it count the cost of decommissioning nuclear stations or dealing
with the waste therefrom.
Quite rightly Greenpeace says that solar power produces no radioactive
waste. They also point out that other countries, including Germany,
Holland, Japan, and the US, are investing fairly substantially in the
technology. There is no veil over the hint that the UK could do better.
Grrenpeace claims that DTI studies show that solar panels installed on
buildings have the potential to provide as much electricity as Britain
needs. To show that some entrepreneurs believe in sunshine power,
British companies generate exports of #40m a year making the panels.
On the environmental front, Greenpeace says the electricity industry
pumped out 200 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
while a billion pounds have been spent on subsidising nuclear power.
Only half a million pounds went into solar research.
Here at Frontiers, our aim is to show the new, the innovative, and the
work of people at the cutting edge of science and technology and we
believe it's best to leave politics to the experts. However, almost
every technological advance has brought with it  political change and
solar panels will do so too, at some stage.
If the technology is there and if it can cope, it can only a good idea
to do some real research into the potential. The electricity generating
business is huge, and it is big business and there is nothing wrong with
making a buck. However, the oil and the coal will run out.  At the
moment their use contributes to the dangers of global warming and its
uncertainties. At the end of the coal age, all that will be left will be
nuclear power, not necessarily a bad power, but it has its attendant
problems -- to wit, Chernobyl.
Solar power, free, clean, and becoming cheaper, has a place in the
power generation of the future. Even a cloudy old place like Scotland
usually is, should get on that bandwagon while the going is good.

ICI has agreed to pay #23m to Thermex Energy in the US as settlement
of a #317m court judgment against it earlier this month.
A Texas judge had upheld antitrust damages of nearly $500m against
ICI, prompting the group's Atlas Powder subsidiary, which it took over
in 1990, to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in case a deal
with Thermex could not be reached.
Thermex, a US explosives company, had claimed that Atlas was part of a
conspiracy that forced it into bankruptcy in 1990.
ICI has always denied that there was any conspiring with group of
manufacturers to force Thermex out of business. But while it continues
to believe that the lawsuit had no basis and the judgment was both
unreasonable and unwarranted, the settlement had been reached to remove
uncertainty overhanging the business.
Howver, ICI still faces claims brought after the Oklahoma bonbing on
the grounds that an ICI fertiliser may have been used in the bomb.

TOURS-to-restaurant group Baldwin yesterday said camping and caravan
holidaymakers were beating the gloomy trend in the rest of the leisure
industry.
''Despite reports of 1995 being a difficult year for the holiday
package industry and no sign of growth for the major tour operators, the
self-drive holiday market -- and camping in particular -- has once again
defied the trend.
''Falling ferry fares and the opening of the Channel Tunnel have had a
beneficial effect on bookings which we expect to increase by more than
9% over 1994,'' said chairman David Landau.
Baldwin lost #3.2m before tax for the out-of-season period covering
the six months to April 30, compared with losses of #2.2m at the same
stage last year.
It said the increased loss was due to extra advertising and marketing
costs involved in growing the tours business.
The company said clients had in general been booking holidays later
than in previous years. However, Baldwin said it was confident of at
least matching last year's record-breaking profit levels.
The interim dividend improves to 2p from 1.6p with a loss per share up
to 11.3p from 7.67p.

SCOTTISH solicitors have been busy raising money for charity.
Staff of Maclay Murray &amp; Spens went ''over the top'' in a charity
abseil down the 100ft side of Edinburgh's Holiday Inn. Altogether the
team raised #1100 for the Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund, and the entire
event added almost #16,000 to the charity's coffers with 30 teams taking
part.
Jolyon Thomson from Maclay Murray &amp; Spens admits: ''It was a good
experience which I'm not sure I would like to repeat. Going over the top
was the worst bit and reaching the ground was a relief indeed.'' Never
mind, it was all in a good cause.
More than 100 Scottish solicitor's firms raised money for the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund and the British Heart Foundation in a rather less
nerve-wracking way when they participated in the Will to Give scheme
recently.
The initiative raised more than #13,000, with solicitors drawing up
wills for a suggested donation of #35 which was then divided between the
two charities. Shetlanders certainly appear to be a generous lot --
Lerwick's Tait &amp; Peterson raised an incredible #1176, the highest sum
donated by an individual firm.
Roderick Davidson of Stirling-based Kerr &amp; Co, who co-ordinated the
scheme, was delighted with its success. To mark the occasion he posed
with a giant will outside Edinburgh's High Court in Parliament Square
flanked by Maureen Harrison, Scottish director of the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund, and John Prosser, Scottish director of the British Heart
Foundation.

INtelligent street lamps could soon herald the answer to a host of
problems, says Joe Donnelly
A TEAM at Glasgow Caledonian University are working on a way to give
street lights some brainpower. The bright idea, excuse the pun, comes
from the New Intelligent Technologies Research Centre, headed by Barry
Beggs.
The lighting team want to make street lights think for themselves and
they are collaborating with a team from Oviedo Uni in northern Spain,
using a #700,000 European Union research grant.
The idea of intelligent street lighting is not as fanciful as one
might suppose. The objective of the massive project is to improve
quality and reduce maintenance costs, but also to make lights more
adaptive for ordinary people to use.
Traditional lighting systems can't pinpoint where a fault has
occurred, which results in electricians having to search around, or even
waiting for the public to complain, resulting in long delays for
repairs, and possible hazards in areas where lighting is particularly
vital.
Faults, according to Barry Beggs and his team, also mean street lights
use more power for less illumination.
The ISCELIS system is being developed to take information from each
individual light and report back to a central control unit. When a fault
arises, the processor works out where and what the problem is.
Because the individual lights will be centrally controlled, there
could be added benefits including an automatic reduction in brightness
for motorways when traffic volumes are very low. It could also be used
to vary light levels in tunnels to merge with the natural light outside,
combating the sudden day-blindness drivers suffer when emerging.
The Caledonian-Oviedo project is being funded for two years under the
Craft section of the Brite-EuRam programme which is particularly
concerned with getting small companies involved in active research. Of
small firms involved two of them are Scottish, U A Comms of Kilmarnock
and Dunsmore Data of Edinburgh, two of seven companies who see such
benefits from the applications that collectively they have contributed
half the costs.
Barry Beggs tells us: ''We're now talking to Strathclyde region to try
out a prototype of the system. Hopefully we will identify an ideal site
in Glasgow very soon. The system should make substantial savings all
round, but the potential applications are numerous.''
Barry won't elaborate on the possibilities, but suffice it to say that
if every street lamp is connected to a central brain, a city could have
a ready-made network which could allow communications or even monitoring
if necessary, and there is a possibility that the ISCELIS system could
be adapted for streetlighting. So long as it does not affect the green
sequence in St Vincent Street, we're all for that.
Barry adds: ''A faster response time for repairs will have a safety
benefit. Research by the Institution of Lighting Engineers shows a
proven relationship between quality of street lighting and crime.
''And a faster repair response will have obvious advantages in costs
and safety. The quicker street lights are repaired, the less time
travellers will be in the dark.''

WHA'L o caller oysters. Last century, this cry resounded through
Edinburgh's streets as Newhaven lassies, nicknamed autumn cuckoos, sold
some of the millions of fresh oysters consumed every year. Over-fishing
and pollution gradually killed the native oyster beds, but the autumn
cuckoo remains as the company logo of August's TrailBlazer competition
winner.
Loch Fyne Oysters at Cairndow in Argyll is playing a significant role
in re-introducing the taste for this shellfish, renowned for its
aphrodisiac qualities, back into the UK. In the last 10 years, home
consumption has rocketed from six to some 30 million of the molluscs
annually.
Yet the development of the company came about almost by chance
according to chairman John Noble. ''In the late 1970s, I was looking to
generate more revenue for my family estate and in conversation with a
local fish farmer he mentioned it was possible to get seed oysters. I
knew conditions in Loch Fyne were likely to be good because of old
shells on the shore, which during the war I pounded up to feed the hens
as grit -- no-one knew why they had died out.''
Noble and the fish farmer, Andrew Lane, now the company's managing
director, had to start from scratch because, if fish farming was in its
infancy, oyster farming had barely been conceived. They made various
abortive attempts and had several study trips to France, before
developing a successful colony of the Gigas or Pacific oyster. Now,
there are more than two million laid down, the oldest of which is
company mascot, Hamish, who weighs in excess of half a kilo.
Recognising that cultivating oysters alone would not be a viable
business, the company soon diversified into smoking top-quality local
salmon and dealing in West coast shellfish. With guaranteed next-day
delivery in the UK, this provided an entry into some of the most
prestigious restaurants and hotels, initially in Britain and, more
recently, overseas including the likes of Raffles in Singapore and the
Mandarin in Hong Kong.
The company produces some 300 tonnes of smoked salmon a year and
turnover is now around #4m, 50% of which is generated from exports. It
supplies Cathay Pacific, is number one supplier of oysters to Hong Kong
and is making steady inroads into China. These achievements were
recognised when it was granted a Queen's Award for Export Achievement
last year.
One of its greatest successes is the Loch Fyne Oyster Bar and seafood
shop, written up in several good food guides, which turns over nearly
#1m a year.
''Initially we sold fresh trout and oysters from under an umbrella on
the old Telford bridge at the head of Loch Fyne. This went quite well,
so we put up a little wooden kiosk. Our farm buildings had become
practically redundant, so we converted them into offices, the smoke
house and the restaurant, the last of which, we think, sells more
oysters than any other single outlet in the UK,'' John Noble says.
Two further restaurants were developed in Nottingham and Peterborough,
and discussions are at an early stage with possible partners to develop
more at various sites around the UK.
''From the re-creation of oyster beds on Loch Fyne 17 years ago, this
company is now the largest producer of oysters in Scotland,'' says John
Ker, head of Entrepreneurial Services at Ernst &amp; Young's Glasgow office.
''In addition to its dedication to quality, its exporting achievements
and marketing flair, it is also a significant employer in a scattered
Highland rural economy. The managing director began as a graduate
trainee fish farmer; the company director was taken on as a student from
HIE; the oyster bar manageress was a local housewife with no formal
training who now runs a restaurant with sales of over #400,000, and a
shepherd's wife runs the shop with similar level of sales.''

DAVID Boyce, senior partner of solicitor Boyds, and fellow partner
Stuart Russell decided to go for a run while attending the recent
American Bar Association annual meeting in Chicago.
The $25 entry fee for the 5K run went to charity, and although the
Scottish contingent were not among the first across the line they at
least had the satisfaction of beating the English Law Society
participants. After the race their English colleagues came up with the
lame excuse that they were too busy handing out business cards to worry
about beating them.
''A more credible excuse,'' Russell says, ''would have been the heat
and humidity. On the morning the race took place it was 79 degrees by
8am and the humidity was 75%.''
More than 15,000 American lawyers were in town for the event and
Locate in Scotland and the Law Society of Scotland took advantage of so
many solicitors being around to hold a seminar in the Hyatt Regency
entitled ''Scotland: The Business Gateway to Europe''.
David Boyce was one of the speakers and he explained the process of
acquiring land in this country, as well as talking about the development
funding which is available. Other Scottish solicitors taking part
included Michael Dean of McGrigor Donald and Andrew Sleigh of W&amp;J
Burness.
At a loss for foreign words
YET another survey has illustrated that when it comes to languages
British executives lag far behind the foreign competition.
Michael Page Group, the international executive consultancy,
interviewed 1300 executives in Germany -- 46% of whom claimed to speak
fluent English, with another 36% saying they had a good working
knowledge of our language. We should be grateful so many can talk in
English as only 5.5% of UK executives interviewed said they could speak
fluent German.
The only language where we came out ahead of the Germans was Italian.
Wait for it. A staggering 1.8% of British executives interviewed claimed
to be Italian speakers, compared to 1.5% of Germans.
I wonder what the Italians did to upset the Germans, as they are
obviously not on speaking terms.
Guides of all
kinds in demand
TOURIST guides will be in great demand tomorrow on the Cowal Peninsula
when visitors arrive for the Cowal Highland Games where 150 pipe bands
will be performing.
But the local population of 17,000 is more interested in another guide
which has just appeared -- the second edition of the Dunoon &amp; Cowal
Business Directory published by Argyll &amp; Islands Enterprise. It attempts
to list all the businesses operating on the peninsula, including the one
and only chimney sweep, Dougie Pollock in Kames, and the two dry stane
dykers.
Some 8000 copies of the guide produced by Argyll Publishing are being
distributed to every household and business in the area.
Very creditable
funding effort
STRATHCLYDE Credit Union Development Agency is one of the many bodies
in the West of Scotland which will have to look elsewhere for funding
when Strathclyde Regional Council ceases to exist.
The Region provides around one third of the agency's funding, which is
why it has invited representatives from the 12 unitary authorities which
will replace it to a reception on Wednesday evening to hear about credit
unions.
Since it was formed in 1988 the agency has trained volunteers for 37
new credit unions, and there are now an estimated 20,000 members in
Strathclyde.
Credit unions are a wonderful asset to any community, and I personally
hope the new authorities agree to provide funding.
Miles quicker
going by bus
LABOUR MP and shadow Trade and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson failed
to turn up for an appointment yesterday with Graeme Torrance, managing
director of Clydesdale which operates bus services in Wilson's
Cunningham North constituency.
He rang Torrance to apologise and explained that the train he was on
to Glasgow's Queen Street station had broken down. On hearing the MP's
reason for not making the meeting Torrance politely suggested that
perhaps he should consider travelling by bus in future.
Russians are
suited to a tee
DOUGLAS Smith, manager of Slater Menswear in Aberdeen, is delighted
with the latest contract he has clinched -- supplying blazers and
flannels to Moscow City Golf Club, which is situated only 10 minutes
from the Kremlin.
The order came out of the blue when Alexander Jarounine called in at
the Aberdeen store last week for an emergency fitting out. The Moscow
City Golf Club official was in Aberdeen on business when he discovered
that the agenda included a dinner with the city's Lord Provost.
Unfortunately, he did not have clothes with him suitable for the
occasion.
Aberdeen FC director Denis Miller suggested he go along to Slater's,
where else, and he would be fixed up. While in the store he got into
conversation with Douglas Smith, and before leaving he had placed an
order for 20 blazers and flannels for the Moscow club's officials.
Smith told Business Diary: ''We are delighted to get such an order and
it could lead to us supplying the club's membership.''
Distance will not present a problem as far as making the clothes is
concerned. When the firm was completing an order for a company in
Murmansk it received measurements from some ladies which appeared more
suited to a Geoff Capes type figure. The company questioned the
measurements only to be told everything was in order.
The clothes were duly made and Slater Menswear was told that they
fitted perfectly.
Designs on ice
hockey stardom
ALLAN McConachie, senior designer with the 999 Design Group, has an
identity problem. He is in danger of becoming a cult figure with
teenagers in the Borders who think he is an international ice hockey
star.
His picture adorns the walls of many young ice hockey fans' bedrooms
after it appeared in the promotional material for Border Vikings, the
Dumfries-based team which plays in the First Division.
McConachie's rise to fame came when he was faced with the problem of
creating a promotional package for the re-launch of the Vikings in the
middle of summer when there were no players around.
Needing someone to model for a photograph, he simply kitted himself
out in ice hockey gear. This led to his face appearing on thousands of
brochures and posters which, if such a thing is possible in an ice rink,
are selling like hot cakes.
Border Vikings play their first game of the new season tonight, which
must be a sure sign that the heatwave is over, and McConachie must be
praying for a victory to ensure that his non-appearance in the team is
not blamed for any defeat.
Chamber driven
to excitement
I THOUGHT the shows had come to town when I spotted the following
headline on Glasgow Chamber of Commerce's latest release. Free Ride 'n'
Drive Event it proclaimed, and I had this image of Geoff Runcie, chief
executive of the chamber, on a dodgem car, but it was nothing so
exciting.
The jazzy headline was referring to a seminar the chamber is running
on September 7 at Gleddoch House Hotel, Langbank in Renfrewshire, to
explain the benefits of the British Chamber of Commerce's latest venture
-- a car fleet programme run by Ryland Multifleet.
Following the seminar there will be an opportunity to test drive a
selection of Audi cars which is where the Free Ride 'n' Drive headline
comes in.

IAIN Graham insists: ''We are providing something which liberates
people and enables them to use their own initiative.'' His company,
Graham Technology, develops some of the leading software transforming
the quality and complexity of business which can now be conducted on the
telephone.
I've written elsewhere in The Herald recently about call centres, the
sophisticated computer/telephone technology used by more and more
businesses to sell catalogue goods and financial products, collect
debts, and deal with service inquiries, from electricity black-outs to
people trapped in lifts.
I first wrote about Graham Technology in April last year when its GT-X
product, which takes the way such call centres operate to a higher plane
of sophistication, had been taken on board by Great Universal Stores,
which was upgrading the way it processed millions of catalogue orders.
A lot has happened to Graham Technology since. This June the fruits of
a major alliance with the mighty AT&amp;T of America were unveiled, when the
communications giant's Global Business Communications Systems, whose
products sell in more than 50 countries, launched Callflow, its version
of the Graham software.
In the same month, at the X/Open software industry awards in London's
Grosvenor House, Graham Technology was awarded the premier Software
Supplier of the Year title, against finalist opposition which included
such heavyweights as Hewlett Packard. ''We had nominated GUS in the user
section, and we knew they had won,'' says Iain Graham. ''But winning in
our own right too means we are now talking to most of the majors about
what we can offer. Currently we are running an average of one-and-a-half
presentations a day.''
Graham has teamed up with Cambridge Technology of Boston to bid for
contracts in Europe and the US. That link, he believes, could quickly
lead to the Glasgow business establishing its own base on America's
eastern seaboard.
AT&amp;T GBCS's major product is Definity, an all-digital telephone switch
with a capacity of up to 30,000 lines. Launching the rebadged Callflow
software enables it to provide call centre customers with a complete
turnkey service, and will ensure Graham Technology a steady flow of
royalty income and additional sub-contract work for years ahead.
The deal, Iain Graham explains, started to take shape last December.
His Hillington-based company was looking for the right switch supplier
for a contract. At the same time, AT&amp;T was seeking Graham Technology out
because the grapevine had suggested the Scottish company's software was
the right partner for its own hardware.
''When we all met for the first time, we already knew each others'
names,'' recalls Graham. It is rare for the American multinational to
look outside its own research and development facility, Bell
Laboratories, for new products. But at the launch of Callflow, the
managing director of AT&amp;T GBCS, David Phillips, called the Graham
software a ''world beating product''.
The first Callflow deal was quickly done with Autoglass, the car
windscreen specialist. A stack of others are in various stages of
negotiation. The impact, Graham believes, should be worth several
million pounds to his company over the next few years.
''AT&amp;T gives us legs we would never have developed otherwise,'' he
says. ''The biggest risk for us is that the pace of development this
generates outstrips the income flow to us.'' Graham's focus is simple.
He wants to sell software licences to bigger partners and become a
globally recognised supplier by the end of this year.
The combination of increasingly sophisticated telephone switches and
the Graham software, which allows a call centre operator to pull
together information from a range of independent data bases on to one
workstation screen, using point and click commands, creates a powerful
marketing and selling tool. But Iain Graham believes such systems can
evolve well beyond that level.
''I use the analogy of the Japanese entering the market for nuts and
bolts. At first they concentrated on producing particular sizes in
volume more cheaply than anyone else could. The first examples of
selling things like insurance on the telephone are a bit like that.
''But I'm not sure that kind of cost advantage is sustainable longer
term. So we need to move towards universal operators, who can, once the
business case is defined, deal with anything that is thrown at them.''
The thrust of Graham Technology's software development is to provide the
tools that will enable operators to handle these broad-band challenges,
to create telephone interfaces between companies and their customers
which can be switched from one business process to another at will.
The result of that, Graham argues, will be an organisational upheaval
in companies as we know them, rendering functional departments such as
sales largely redundant. Key workers, released from command and control
management systems, will be able to concentrate on developing strategies
for how each organisation can deliver better products or services.
They will be ''liberated''. But there is, of course, a danger that
their liberation will be bought at the price of the actual call centre
operators becoming more and more tightly tied to the instructions and
protocols on the screens in front of them.
Iain Graham admits that he would not relish the management challenge
of running, say, a 200-person call centre. Indeed, one of his personal
projects is to develop a whole series of smaller linked centres, built
on a human scale, across the Scottish Highlands and Islands. He is
talking to Highlands and Islands Enterprise about how to make that dream
a reality.
Meanwhile, Graham Technology is in the final stages of negotiations
with Telecom Services Centres, the start-up company building a call
centre in Rothesay with heavy HIE financial backing. It too will
probably feature Graham-inspired technology.
''At the moment the business is snowballing,'' says Iain's wife,
Sheena. ''But we need a new mission this year,'' he counters. ''We have
to avoid the 'we've arrived' syndrome.''

ROY HANLON, the actor, is my first victim of the morning at the Leith
Gallery, Giles Street, where I'm Portrait Painting Live each day during
the Festival.
Roy is looking wild and woolly, a marked contrast to my model of
yesterday --my niece in her wedding dress. He's all set to play Wild
Bill Hickok at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, next week, and I launch
straight in with strong orange and brown.
The Leith Gallery is the new venture of two powerful and determined
women, Jan Morrison and Joan Arnott. They have premises on The Shore,
but until these are renovated they've rented a temporary space nearby
for their Festival exhibition.
They were kind enough to invite me, and 35 of my paintings, to share
this show with an incredibly good and successful young artist, Angus
McEwan.
Most gallery-goers, I've discovered, are artists themselves -- if not
yet, then they want to be. My public painting has been witnessed so far
by the most talented bunch you could hope to meet. My first day, an
elderly painter, Donald Swann, made the trip specially to Leith out of
fellow-feeling, as years ago he had done the same at the Netherbow --
painting anyone who dropped in.
Mid-morning some of Roy's friends drop in, a film producer and a
designer/sculptor/fiddler. The talk turns to bidding for Ecus for film
projects and prizewinning giant footprints for Pilton.
Roy's mouth keeps moving but I soldier on until lunchtime when John
and Morag Aitkenhead, of Kilquhanity School, arrive. We hug, we chat,
they buy a picture.
At The Waterfront the sun is shining and I am wearing a sun dress --
on the east coast of Scotland in August, for heaven's sake!
The afternoon brings my lifelong buddy, George Byatt, to sit for me.
His silvery hair and blue silk shirt start me off on a cool tone poem in
blues and greys. He never stops talking either. Jenny, presiding
receptionist of the gallery, plies us with coffee and peppermint tea
while trying to sneak in some philosophy revision. George switches the
topic to philosophy to oblige.
A man arrives to demand what ''portrait painting live'' means and sits
very close to me. I presume he is an art critic and rise to the
challenge.
George's conversation softens him and it transpires he is a retired
professor who also wants to paint. He expresses an interest in seeing a
picture start from scratch. So I offer to paint him with a mirror placed
so that he can watch me work.
Ten minutes later I've an oil sketch of him, only lacking colour. He
offers to come back another day and we make a date.
The dinner break in the day usually means a rush back to Colinton for
a vegetarian meal at home.
Ten minutes' sleep, a wash, and out again -- back along through the
traffic lights to the theatre.
Today it's the King's and, 30 minutes in, the play is retitled Watch
the Audience Marching Towards the Street as the fire alarm expels us all
outside to the blessed relief of the cool night air.
We meet Kenny Ireland, who says the Lyceum alarm goes off every time
someone on the top floor has a shower with the door shut.
The privilege of three whole weeks at the Festival has made me smug.
But as the end of week two approaches, panic is setting in. Extra
commissions have meant painting morning and afternoon, and my serious
ticket searches have been hindered by a mind obsessed with where to buy
turps and whether to use a certain seductive tube of purple or not.
However, now I have got my tickets for Bondagers, Tap Dogs, and Ningali
I am feeling more calm.
The town is full of friends. Pauline Collins, up for a workshop at the
Actors Studio, agreed with me that what was needed was a directory of
Who's in Town -- quite simply a list of all performers' names
alphabetically arranged with what show they are in alongside. Anyone
volunteer?
Surely nowhere in the world is there more talent per inch of crowded
pavement than here. The town is buzzing, the streets are throbbing in
downtown Leith, the model is still talking.
* The Leith Gallery, 93 Giles Street, Leith, is open daily throughout
the Festival from 11am to 8pm, Portrait Painting Live 3pm-5pm.

Herald film reviewer William Russell pens an open letter to Mark
Cousins, director of the Edinburgh Film Festival.
Dear Mark Cousins,
PEOPLE who dissect films, and there have been a lot of them in Lothian
Road these past two weeks, invariably get round to talking about
structure. Get that right and the rest will follow, it is said.
Well, you and Ginnie Atkinson, your energetic, harassed producer, got
the structure of the Film Festival right. You also created a genuinely
happy, enthusiastic atmosphere around Filmhouse which made it a pleasure
to attend. (Loved your fan club, by the way, known in some quarters as
the Kissing Cousins. Their adulation will have helped keep the adrenalin
flowing, although don't believe everything they say. To quote that
celebrated Billy Wilder line -- nobody's perfect.)
Taking the clubroom and the cafe back inside the main building was a
good idea because the Drambuie tents never quite worked. They separated
the delegates, the press, the film-makers and the punters from the
cinemas and deprived the Festival of a focal point.
The new Rosebud section met your aim of providing a showcase for
unusual independent films. While I did not like all of them, you would
not expect me to.
Any film festival should reflect its director's taste. If it is not to
the liking of critics a useful argument can follow. If it is not to the
taste of the audience they will make their views clear at the box
office.
To take a case in point, giving a young Scots film-maker like Morag
McKinnon the chance to show 3, made for #40,000, a film I had deep
reservations about, on the splendid Filmhouse 1 screen as the main
evening show was worth doing. You did not discover the new Tarantino,
however, and my happiest moment came in Desperado when Quentin, who
misguidedly thinks he can act, got blown away.
One of the striking features was the strong showing made by Scottish
films. If Edinburgh serves any purpose it is as the place to launch
them. Like many people I admired Bernard Ruddens's Hunger Artist. Allan
Laing found David Hayman's The Near Room well-nigh perfect. Not everyone
agreed, but that does not matter.
Gillies and Billy Mackinnon returned to their roots with the
well-received Small Faces, and while Gillies's Steve Martin film, A
Simple Twist of Fate, made me cringe, that was no reason not to show it.
Martin also turned up, something of a coup, while Diane Ladd, who
brought her film Mrs Munck, entertained everyone she met. The three
Tartan Shorts were well above standard this year, while BBC Scotland's
Nightlife, directed by Patrick Harkins, was a model short film.
Your other coup was to get Leslie Caron, who stars in your closing
film, Peter Chelsom's intriguing Funny Bones, to attend. Festivals are
not about stars, but they do add to the general gaiety, and she is a
legend. The New British Expo section, to screen the British films made
during the past year, should mean that Edinburgh sets itself up as the
market-place for our product. If that happens, more power to your elbow.
The Stanley Donen retrospective introduced some wonderfully
entertaining films to an audience which by and large could only have
seen most of them on television. It also proved that you do not need the
subject of the retrospective to be present, since Donen pulled out at
the last minute. Sorry, Stanley, but you were not really missed.
There were days when it seemed to me that the programme lacked a
really strong, central film round which the cinema-goer could arrange
his day. I know you rely on the comfort of strangers. What you get is
what the major distributors will provide, but there is a raft of major
Hollywood films out this autumn which might have been given.
Your decision to open with Ken Loach's splendid Spanish Civil War
drama, Land and Freedom, not normal opening gala fare, cannot be
faulted, although that part of the audience which had turned up so that
they could attend the opening-night party apparently had problems with
it. More fool they. Cinema is about making people think, as well as
entertaining them.
I believe, you disagree, that television films should be treated as
such, not mixed in with cinema films. This is to recognise the
self-evident truth that a film made to be watched by a handful of people
in their living room who are free to do whatever they wish while
watching is a totally different animal from one made to be watched by a
captive audience of several hundred in the dark. The structure is
different for a start.
There were some very fine TV movies on show, of which Karl Francis's
Streetlife was the cream of the crop, and I think it would be valuable
if they could be seen in their own context rather than put alongside
different beasts. Mongrels don't get shown at Crufts.
The Scene by Scene project, which allowed film-makers to take a film
and show clips from it at will to illustrate what otherwise would just
have been a celebrity lecture, is a major innovation other festivals
will copy.
Next year you might do a little more to promote the short films,
especially by ensuring that people like me write about them. The power
of the press is what I am on about. Good reviews from a wide range of
critics can give an aspiring film-maker's career a boost. Maybe a prize
or two, if some philanthropist can be found, would also help.
I look forward to coming back next year. By then you should be master
of all you survey.
Yours ever -- William Russell.

GERMAN baritone Thomas Quasthoff is one of the most remarkable singers
of the day; or, more specifically, he has one of the most remarkable and
distinctive voices on the scene today.
In his biography he makes no reference to his disability --
thalidomide -- but if there have been vicissitudes for him to overcome
en route to a concert career, then he has swept them aside,
triumphantly. The voice that emerges from his diminutive frame is
surprising for its sheer size: he can wield enormous vocal power --
though he keeps it strictly in check.
The most striking feature of the Quasthoff voice is its beauty. As he
demonstrated consistently yesterday throughout a highly sensitive
account of Schumann's song cycle, Dichterliebe.
Every note -- even in impassioned or ardent songs, where many
vocalists resort to declamation -- is sung, with a rich, warm,
honey-like tone; there is not a rough edge in sight.
All of it amounted to a highly expressive and moving version of
Schumann's masterpiece, marred only by some indecisive, overpedalled
playing by pianist Peter Langehein.
Quasthoff himself was a joy to hear, ravishing in songs by Brahms and
supremely characterful in a short set by Hugo Wolf.

* My wife is six years younger than me and will be working up to
retirement age. I am approaching retirement and will get the state
pension. Will this be at the rate for a married man or will I only be
due the single pension because she works?
* Assuming your national insurance contribution record is complete you
will be entitled to the full basic pension of #58.85 a week plus any
earnings related pension. You will also get a payment in respect of your
wife of #35.25 a week provided she makes less than #45.45. Earnings over
this are deducted pound-for-pound from the increase to your pension.
This continues until she also retires. If she then receives a pension in
her own right, the amount will be deducted from the spouse increase paid
to you.

* I've just come back from holiday and I was angry that some people
had paid much less for the same package, with the same hotel, food,
everything, because they made a late booking. I deliberately made an
early one to take advantage of a discount that was then being offered.
But the discount these late bookers received was much more. I certainly
won't be booking with the same company again. A marketing ploy which
alienates customers cannot be a good one so why did it do it? I wrote to
complain but haven't had an answer yet. It seems sharp practice to me.
* This is all part of the rough and tumble of the market. There is no
reason why the tour operator cannot change his or her prices as demand
fluctuates just like any other business from the supermarket to the
plumber, so you won't get much sympathy from the company. You may be
sure it is well aware it risks alienating customers and has made a
judgment that the extra revenue it will receive from discounting is
worth it. In fact, late season discounting is a feature of the travel
industry and many holidaymakers make full use of the practice.
Early booking discounts are a good ploy because the discount is offset
by early receipts of deposits, while late discounting to almost any
price is worth doing if the seat on the aircraft would otherwise be
empty.
It could be argued that you paid a higher price to be sure of the
holiday of your choice, while the risk the late booker took was
reflected in the lower price. Late discounts will be immediately
reversed should demand suddenly pick up, because of a change in the
weather for example. At the end of the day, you pay your money and you
take your choice.
* I am getting bemused by the sheer number of corporate bond PEPs
flooding on to the market and it has occurred to me that I could almost
as easily do it myself and save on charges. My wife could also do the
same thing to have a worthwhile portfolio. Is this a good idea and how
should I go about it? I already have a stockbroker.
* It would certainly be a good idea to do this via a self-select PEP
and it should be a little cheaper. You will only be able to use your
stockbroker if he or she is an authorised PEP manager. If this is the
case, he or she will be able to come up with a number of suitable
convertible stocks to form a portfolio, particularly given that you will
have up to #12,000 to invest between yourself and your wife.
It may, however, be cheaper to investigate a self-select PEP offered
by an execution-only stockbroker such as City Deal (01708 742288) or
YorkShare (01274 740740) where you choose your own stocks. You could
easily put together a portfolio of stocks issued by household names such
as Hanson, British Gas, Glaxo and Tesco to give a yield of more than 8%.
Stocks standing at over their par value will mean a capital loss on
redemption but this can be acceptable as long as you are aware of it.
After all, your convertible PEP is not going to represent all your
capital, at least it shouldn't.
* I am approaching age 65 and have a question on the income tax age
allowance calculation. I know that to qualify for the allowance my
income must be below a set level, but I believe that in certain
circumstances the allowance may still be due where income exceeds this
limit. Can you explain this and also confirm that payments to charities,
for example a deed of covenant to the church, are deducted when
calculating income?
* The current basic personal tax allowance is #3525, which is
increased to an age allowance of #4630 for those between 65 and 74 and
#4800 for those 75 and over. The full amount of these allowances is due
where total income for the tax year 1995/96 does not exceed #14,600.
Where income is over this limit the age allowance is reduced by one-half
of the amount of the excess. The effective maximum income for age
allowance claims is therefore #16,810 for the under 75s, and #19,360 for
those over that age. Beyond these levels only the basic personal tax
allowance is due.
Charitable payments under deed of covenant are deducted in arriving at
total income for age allowance purposes, and it is the gross amount of
the payment which is deducted. For example, a payment of #100 a year to
the church is deemed to be net of basic rate tax, and it is the gross
equivalent of #133 which is deducted from income.
* Some time ago I invested #1500 for each of my grandchildren in the
shares of Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust. I am well satisfied with
the performance of this investment, which was selected from a short list
of trusts recommended by you. I now find that I am in a position to
invest a further #1500 on behalf of my grandchildren, and wonder whether
you would still recommend Foreign &amp; Colonial.
* It is unlikely that you would ever go badly wrong by choosing to
invest in the shares of Foreign &amp; Colonial, and we would still include
them on any list of suitable investment trusts for small investors.
However, as your grandchildren already have stakes in this trust, it
would seem a good idea to choose something else on this occasion. You
could safely pick from Alliance Trust in Dundee, Martin Currie's
Scottish Eastern and Baillie Gifford's Scottish Mortgage (both
Edinburgh-based). All three have excellent records and are shrewdly
managed. As with Foreign &amp; Colonial, shares can be purchased through the
managers' investment schemes at much lower transaction costs than would
be charged by a private client stockbroker.
It is always a good idea to spread money around a bit when the
opportunity arises. It reduces risk.
* I have a holding of #10,000 of Treasury 13% 2000, which gives me a
good income. It is now worth substantially more than I paid for it, and
I wonder if I should sell it before 2000. The Government surely would
not pay me back more than it owes me.
* The Government's commitment is to repay stock at par, except in the
case of index-linked gilts and undated issues, such as War Loan which
may never be repaid. It will hope to replace your stock with a lower
coupon issue at maturity.
Treasury 13% 2000 is currently priced at about #121 per #100 nominal
of stock. Your investment is, therefore, worth #12,100. But if you hold
on to it until the redemption date in 2000 you will receive #100 for
each #100 of stock. The price will start moving back down towards the
#100 mark in anticipation of this.
The trouble is that you would lose income by switching to a lower
coupon stock with the price around #100. An obvious example is Treasury
8% 2003, currently a touch above #100. This would result in your income
before tax dropping from #1300 a year to about #960. Even so it would be
worth your while, because in capital terms you would be #2100 better
off.
You should consult a stockbroker about the timing of a switch and
about the best choice of an alternative stock, which will depend on your
circumstances. Government stocks are a very specialised area of
investment, and it is important to have good advice before taking any
firm decisions.
* I am a working woman aged 53. A few years ago, it was suggested by
my company that the workforce take out a pension scheme individually
since we do not have a group pension. I was about to do this but backed
out in the end because I thought it was too expensive. This means that I
have no company pension, but I am told that on this basis I should
automatically be in the state earnings plan which is separate from the
normal old age pension. Is this true and what does it mean?
* The State Earning Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) was introduced in
1978 to provide an additional state pension based on earnings (within
certain limits) rather than the flat benefit provided by the retirement
pension. In your case you would automatically be in SERPS if you did not
make a choice to opt out and take out your own personal pension plan,
something the Government was encouraging people to do for cost reasons.
In your age category, it would be more beneficial for you to remain in
SERPS anyway. For the actual benefits a sliding scale will operate for
those retiring between the years 2000 and 2009. Those reaching state
retirement age in or after the year 2010 will receive a pension of 20%
of their earnings (again within certain limits) instead of the 25%
originally intended. The relevant earnings to be taken into account will
be the average of lifetime earnings.

HEARD from the back of a long, beautiful, acoustically excellent and
well-lit church, Thomas Zehetmair's violin playing sounds no less
lovely, perhaps even lovelier, than from the front. He is, as the last
of his three recitals again demonstrated, the ideal Bachian, alert to
the intellectual demands of the music, responsive to its romance (a
quality only Bernard Levin would deny), and more than a match for its
intricacy.
It is, indeed, his possession of all three of these qualities that
makes him such a sterling performer. Moving from the generally dark
minor keys of his first two recitals to the radiance of E major and C
major had the startling effect he surely intended to make, at least on
those members of the audience who had followed his Bachian journey from
the beginning.
Yet to speak of ''dark'' or ''radiant'' where these works are
concerned is to simplify an experience far more multi-faceted than that,
as the rich, slowly rocking rhythms of the C major sonata's opening
movement proclaimed. Both here and in the vast succeeding fugue,
Zehetmair probed the music's harmonies with a tone quality that was
lucid but not wiry, round but not fat, but above all with a constant
delight in the work's resourcefulness and fantasy, and with a
responsiveness to the twists and turns of its baroque architecture.
Earlier he had spun airy semi-quavers in the E major partita's prelude
and gigue, and had savoured the melodic sweetness of the gavotte and wit
of the bourree. But he was right to save the sonata for last, making it
the crowning splendour of a Bach cycle heard by a large, enthralled
audience in surroundings that were like a visual reflection of the music
itself.

All evidence now suggests that more Scots are actively Roman Catholic
than actively Protestant. John Macleod asks, what caused the strange
death of Reformation Scotland?
ALIMITED monarchy, religious toleration, liberty of conscience, the
philosophy of science, universal education, social welfare provision,
the balance and division of powers . . . these were born in the
struggles of Scottish Protestantism in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. Today all the Western world takes such principles for
granted, and they are part of the glory of our history.
Yet the word ''Protestant'' today is all but an expletive: a synonym
for ''bigot'', a badge of tribal prejudice, fit only for those who howl
on the tiered seats of Ibrox. You associate it immediately with Pastor
Jack Glass, with Dr Ian Paisley and his political hoodlums, with all the
viciousness of Northern Ireland; and, if you think of Protestants en
masse, as popularly understood, you mean those who are delighted not to
be Roman Catholics and who hate the Pope.
In last year's Monklands East by-election, such old hatreds were still
evident, all the more galvanised by alleged corruption in the Labour-run
district council, and claims of partiality to the very Roman Catholic
Coatbridge. Labour's candidate in the fight, Helen Liddell, was herself
a Roman Catholic. But journalists and politicians still shun exploration
of such issues. What reality remains to religious feeling in central
Scotland? They do not know; they prefer to tip-toe away from it.
Why?
First: the Scottish chattering classes are hugely embarrassed by
sectarianism. They perceive it, quite rightly, as a social evil. In
Ulster, sectarian feeling has brought forth spectacular violence and
bloodshed. Evangelicalism, too, has been tarnished by the grotesque (and
widely publicised) character of Christianity in America. The formers of
Scottish opinion, too, have great concern for London opinion. Sectarian
problems in Scotland, then, is best ignored and minimised.
Second: the Scottish chattering classes are religiously illiterate.
They do not know their history. Few middle-class folk know anything of
the Reformers, the Solemn League and Covenant, the Westminster
Confession of Faith, the ''Killing Times'', or the Revolution
Settlements. They have never seen a copy of the Shorter Catechism. Few
have even the most elementary knowledge of the Bible. Very few of
Scotland's mediavolk attend church -- any church.
Inhibition, ignorance. One might also add plain malice. Many key
players in Scottish culture today hate Christianity and everything it
stands for. They despise Roman Catholicism, of course, for its
uncompromising stand on certain family issues. But it is embarrassing to
be anti-Catholic. It is very much easier to belittle evangelical
Christianity, especially in its historic Scottish form. Words like
''Calvanist'', ''Protestant'', and ''fundamentalist'' are reduced to
terms of abuse. (Those who fling them have not, of course, the slightest
idea of what the terms actually mean.)
Other factors distorts their outlook. One is the media-friendly nature
of Roman Catholicism itself. Roman services are colourful, scented,
musical: merry melodies, gorgeous robes, earthy priests. Roman Catholic
worship makes beautiful television. Traditional Protestant worship, with
its emphasis on plain preaching, does not.
There is, too, the general view that Roman Catholics, in Scotland,
have had a raw deal. Such thinking does not bear examination. Before the
Reformation, the Catholic Church in Scotland put dozens of Protestants
to death, afterwards, not one single Roman Catholic was martyred for his
faith. In a wider context, how did Protestants fare in the England of
Mary Tudor or the France of Catherine de Medici?
Thomas Winning's recent receipt of a Cardinal's hat was met with
glowing tributes, uncritical press and TV coverage, and became a
national celebration. Politicians of left and right take conspicuous
counsel with the man who, to all intents and purposes, is now Scotland's
pre-eminent churchman. All evidence now suggests that more Scots are
actively Roman Catholic than actively Protestant.
What caused the strange death of Reformation Scotland?
Scotland was never, at the grassroots, a solidly Reformed, Protestant,
Calvinist land. The spread of vital Christianity in Scotland has been
irregular and uneven. The Reformation had little impact on the
Highlands; the new faith took root in the cities, and especially about
Edinburgh and St Andrews. At different times, ever since, evangelical
Protestantism has fired different places.
Yet, in public polity, and in the official character of the land,
Scotland was confirmed as a solidly Protestant state from 1690, with one
Presbyterian kirk established by law and a Protestant constitution. The
Roman Catholic Church was all but obliterated from Scottish life. It
lost its hierarchy in the Reformation and, by the end of the seventeenth
century, was reduced to a scattered following, thinly priested, isolated
largely to the North-east and some glens of Inverness-shire. In so far
as there was an opposing church tradition at all to the Reformed faith,
it was that of Episcopacy, strongest in the Highlands, and main bloc of
support for the Jacobite risings.
It was this vigorous cultural Protestantism, and its fear of a Stuart
restoration, which largely drove Scotland into the Union of 1707. It was
negative nationalism, seeking common defence in a shared faith and
political culture. Ironically, the Union itself was rapidly instrumental
in weakening Presbyterianism -- by internal division. Scotland and
England were not long joined when, quite contrary to the Articles of
Union, patronage was reimposed on the Scottish Kirk. Patronage removed
the right of congregations to call their own ministers and gave the gift
of clerical livings to landlords, English style.
Patronage, in an increasingly literate and ambitious Scotland, aroused
great resentment. That resentment bred schisms from the Kirk -- the
Secession Church, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, the Relief Church.
It culminated in the dramatic ''Thirty Years Conflict'', early last
century, when the Evangelical party gained the ascendancy in the
Established Church, and fought for the overthrow of patronage. They
failed and, in 1843, the Church was rent by the Disruption.
The influence and might of the Free Church, and evangelicalism
generally, in the Scotland of 150 years ago, is hard now to visualise.
But it was an age when evangelicals sat for Scottish seats in
Parliament, when there were Free Church aristocrats and landlords, when
Hugh Miller's Witness outsold the Scotsman, when the leaders of Scottish
society -- university principals, eminent scientists, intellectuals --
were steeped in evangelical religion and dominated by vigorous, informed
Protestants.
But Presbyterianism was divided. The three main competing blocs --
Established Church, Relief Church, United Presbyterian Church -- wasted
much energy in grandiloquent foreign missions, theological institutes,
the building of grand neo-Gothic churches, and an increasing interest in
mordern, critical theology. Needless triplication of effort provoked, at
length, much happy politicking and at length ecumenical politics.
Meanwhile Scotland succumbed to ''Balmorality''. This was the height
of the Union: a golden age of Imperial prosperity. The Episcopal Church
found new favour. An anglicised Scottish nobility drifted gently into
her communion. The Tractarian movement in England -- restoring such
Roman Catholic practices as auricular confession and sacramental worship
to the Anglican culture -- infected Scotland too.
Wealthy, influential, and ambitious, Scots Presbyterians lost interest
in Reformed worship, Reformed theology, in the poor and in the inner
cities. And it was at this very time, in the nineteenth century, that
Scotland's cities swelled with a tide of new labour. Many came from the
nearby countryside; many flooded in from the Highlands. But, largely, it
was a Roman Catholic tide from Ireland.
In 1795 there were 50 Roman Catholics in Glasgow. In 1835 there were
24,000. And still they came. By 1938, according to one reckoning, a full
quarter of Glasgow's population were Roman Catholics of Irish descent.
More than 600,000 Scots now adhered to the Roman Catholic Church and
most were of Irish descent. It was a vast, ongoing mission-field which
the Scottish Presbyterians ignored -- or denounced as a social menace.
Native Roman Catholics were not happy either. The Irish were not long
many in Scotland when a power struggle surged between native and
invading factions of the Roman faith. The Irish demanded the full
panoply of the Church they knew at home: organisation by diocese, and a
hierarchy. Much against the wishes of native Roman Catholics, and their
own leadership -- Cardinal Wiseman of London, indeed, accused his Scots
brethren of crypto-Presbyterianism -- Pope Leo XIII restored a Scottish
hierarchy in 1878. Ever since it has been controlled largely by bishops
of Irish name and descent.
By now the Church of Scotland was caught up in a desperate fight
against the threat of disestablishment. Leaders of the Free and United
Presbyterian Churches led their people into ever more anglicised worship
and ever more liberal theology. As Presbyterianism wasted its energies
internally, the new Roman Catholic population bedded into a power-bloc.
It allied itself to those seeking to grant Irish Home Rule; by 1918,
Roman Catholics had built up sufficient clout and credit to demand, and
win, the unprecedented privilege of educating their own children in a
minority faith at public expense. They hold that privilege still.
What have we lost? We have lost a religious tradition which once fired
our culture and made our little country great. No-one can seriously
consider the present Church of Scotland as a force for good in the world
or a centre of real influence in the land. It is isolated from Scottish
cultural life, a coalition of ideologically diverse elements held
together only by tenuous denominationalism, and stripped of much that
the Reformers venerated -- simplicity of architecture and worship,
knowledge of Scripture, an integrated world-view of a cosmos under an
active, involved triune God.
The minority Presbyterian bodies are marginalised to the Highland
fringe. Assorted sects, cults, and independent Protestant bodies have no
impact at all. Only Episcopalians take the Episcopal Church seriously.
Many heroes of our Reformed past are forgotten. Others are
misrepresented or vilified. Some key aspects of our history are simply
inverted. The Episcopal Church today has a reputation for liberalism and
ecumenism. Few know anything of the history of the Covenanting period,
when hundreds were put to death, and hundreds more brutally tortured,
for insisting on worshipping outwith an enforced Episcopal
establishment. Such as oppressed them or sided with the forces of
absolute monarchy -- like John Graham of Claverhouse, or the Marquess of
Montrose -- are today canonised in the writings of Scott, Buchan,
Tranter, and Linklater.
There are unjust double-standards. For decades writers have rejoiced
in going to Lewis and making mock of Presbyterian practice and worship
for the popular press; but I once went to Barra, and did a similar skit
on the local Mass for the Scotsman, and very nearly lost my job. Many
delight in denouncing such Calvinist concepts as predestination. But the
Roman Catholic dogma of Purgatory, to which they condemn even faithful
Roman believers, is infinitely more absurd and cruel.
The Reformers dreamed, and did much to achieve, universally accessible
education. They also made Scripture available to all in plain Scots or
English. Scots education, wrested from the monastic tradition, skilled
men in the sciences, mathematics, geology, modern language. While the
English insisted on stuffing their people with Greek and antiquities,
Scots forged ahead in technological innovation.
There is another aspect to this. It was largely the Reformation that
made Scotland a nation-state, with an acute grasp of its distinct nature
and identity. It is hard now to understand the mediaeval concept of
''Christendom''; of belonging to a Europe in one faith and under one
Pope. Nor can we enter into the terror that Papacy struck in the heart
of kings, or how profound a darkness in the mediaeval church cast upon
learning, liberty, and progress -- the church that silenced Galileo, the
church which put a fatwa on Elizabeth Tudor.
It is ironic that, even as nationalism rekindles in our land, we are
rushing back into the European embrace, and -- in very recent decades --
cast off much of our own distinctive culture. Temperance, our historic
regard for the Sabbath, our longstanding antipathy to every form of
gambling: these have been legislated out of existence. And yet, even in
our sophisticated and electronic age, we turn more and more to
superstition.
Superstition, the granting of supernatural powers and agencies to
natural things, is the most striking feature of Roman Catholicism, quite
absent from the Protestant world view. The veneration granted to images,
holy water, holy oil, buildings, vestments, and the Host; the place
given to dead saints for intercession and help; the absurd regard for
such pointless miracles as weeping statues -- these are as animistic,
and as savage, as the beliefs of any illiterate Polynesian.
The Protestant world view has supernatural elements: belief in an
unseen God, who has revealed Himself through inerrant Scripture, and who
gave His Son for sinners of mankind, identified by His miraculous birth,
death, and resurrection. But it is free of superstition, and founded on
Scripture alone; a church of which Christ was head and not the Pope, a
church in which all believers were priests, and in which the function of
ordained ministers was to preach in the common tongue, not to conduct
bizarre rituals in a dead language.
It stresses, above all, the concept of Christ's lordship over all
creation, and the commission on believers to explore that creation, and
to know its order, and to combat evil and ignorance and poverty on every
front. Through time Protestantism bred toleration, and the right of
every man to read Scripture for himself and to worship in his own way.
Through time Protestantism bred toleration, and the right of every man
to read Scripture for himself and to worship in his own way. Through
further time it sent men and women forth to new worlds and new
frontiers, not to pillage and plunder, but to bring the Gospel to new
lands. The Reformation, in its unfolding light, bred education,
democracy, liberty, and progress. Lands under the Roman Church
stagnated, wallowing in poverty and cruelty.
We have lost that inheritance. We are back to horoscopes, to eastern
religions, to National Lotteries and the cult of ''chance'', to the
idolatry of footballers, singers, and megastars, to the amassing of
worldly goods on easy credit. It is not, though, to the Roman fold that
we will return, nor even to the arid hopes of secular humanism, nor to
the scientists. We are on course for a new paganism in a new Europe, a
Europe of corruption and mysticism, and a sinister new age, with all its
darkness and terrors.

Thursday, August 3.
D-DAY minus one. Just a quick soundcheck. The sound technician ''can't
do a thing with'' our new #500 radio mikes. Having used them before in
many venues, we were sceptical -- would we just have to bin them? We
pace round the room edgily getting used to what comedians call ''The
Space''. The studio theatre in the Gilded Balloon may be many things,
but it ain't spacious. The hot-and-sweaty atmosphere makes it dodgy for
the average big fat bloke, so it could be a bit sticky for yours truly.
At the press launch party we meet some old mates, and a few barely
remembered faces. In general, festival comics have a bullshit-producing
tumour, a condition that leads to excessive amount of exaggerated
introspective chatter about future projects. The so-called anarchist
surrealists are the worst -- they've usually got their entire career
worked out. After a few beers, it was time for the best thing to come
out of Edinburgh -- the train back to Glasgow.
Friday, 4th.
I LEAVE work for three weeks off. In the worst start possible, I
manage to have an argument with my wife on the way out. Good start. In
Edinburgh, everything seems too quiet for a festival -- so quiet we even
find a parking space on the Grassmarket. John's driving, so at least if
the gig's rotten we can have a few beers. We were lucky, at 25 punters
we were one of the big sellers. The crowd was quite quiet, but we got a
good round of applause at the end -- enough to justify a couple of
refreshments. No press in. Good.
Saturday 5th.
A DAY spent at the baths, and the Glasgow Transport Museum for me. Not
very radical, but it had to be done. Message on the answerphone -- Karen
Koren asking us to do the Best of Scottish Comedy tonight. I was going
to drive, but not with a late finish like this. I called Steve, and
he'll drive us for a fee (dentists are too good at haggling).
Things are still quiet, but the crowd is up on last night, and the gig
is so much better. Two very quick beers, and it's back onstage for the
Best of Scottish. Kenny Harris and John Gillick have done a great job
warming the crowd up. Ford and I haven't any great plan as to what we
should do for our 25 minutes. We walk on, and busk it, using a mixture
of old and new material. It felt brilliant -- sweaty, but brilliant.
Sunday 6th.
A QUIET day. I'll be driving, so I feel a bit inhibited. The first
Sunday is traditionally one of the quiet days, and so it turns out. You
know that attendances are all low when a paying crowd into double
figures is considered ''doing well''. The crowd is particularly placid,
and it's difficult to knock a bit of banter up when there's no feedback.
We soldier on. After the 50 minutes, I was personally glad to see the
dressing room.
Monday 7th.
IF a Fringe performance can see its way beyond the first five days,
then it'll survive. I phone the Press Office. Disaster. Two reviewers
were in last night. Oh no! We're pretty annoyed that we may have been
caught by a national newspaper on a bad night. As far as tonight's
performance goes, the tension shows. The ad-libs between us grated
slightly, and the post-gig post-mortem turned into what diplomats call a
full and frank exchange of views. We go home in subdued mood, no-one
could be bothered with beer. Punch-up time?
Tuesday 8th.
UP early, and out to get the papers. Search frantically through the
Independent. God, it's here, he's reviewed it. Relief sweeps over me.
It's not a brilliant review by any means, but it passes muster. We
resolve not to worry about any of the other reviews.
Thursday 10th.
GONE into work. Get a message to phone Ford urgently. I immediately
assume we've been slated somewhere. This time it's good news -- the play
has received what is known as critical acclaim, and it's rumoured that
it may have won an award. We'll have to wait and see. Our own show got a
good crit in the List. A good day, rounded off with a good gig.
Saturday 12th.
MINOR disaster! The first bad review. Critics, when they're telling
you your show is great are sensitive, intelligent journalists. When
they're telling you things aren't quite brilliant, they become
''blood-sucking parasites draining the arts, with the motivation being
their own peculiar form of performance envy''. There can be no doubting
that when you see someone else get slated, though, there can sometimes
be a form of satisfaction. We get over it quickly. There's no choice
really, as tonight's going to be busy.
We took the kids to see a Festival show today -- nothing fancy mind,
we got them tickets to the Mr Boom show at a converted church. Watching
him entertain almost 200 kids, I am completely spellbound. While we're
struggling to fill an 80-seater, he has a vast army of youngsters there.
After our own show tonight, we've to do the Best of Scottish. Billy
Connolly had watched the show the previous night, and Ford was almost as
disappointed as I was. The guys that he did see are still on a high. One
complains that he couldn't sleep because he was so excited. We do well,
then it's off to the bar for a couple of beers. We have to try to be
careful, as we're due on at Late and Live, the trendy haunt for the
small hours. Usually the crowd are a braying mob of inebriated students
-- precisely our crowd! Surprisingly, as we went onstage at 1.30am, we
were quite sober. We did survive, and we left with a feeling of
satisfaction at getting through three gigs in one night.
Sunday 13th.
IT happens to everyone at least once during the Festival run, and
tonight it's our turn for comedy death to visit. In the comedy world,
you know it's not going to be your night immediately you walk onstage. I
suspect the subconscious can sense the black-cloaked clown in the
corner, scythe in hand, willing you on to failure. No post-gig
post-mortems. Just silence all the way home.
Thursday 24th.
THIS is us exactly halfway through the three-week run. Last night was
a good night, helped by the mini-pub crawl and fish supper on the way
home. We've had our reviews, the crowds are good, and I could just about
get worked up about tonight's gig if I could only shake off this
hangover. It's going to be a long 10 days.
* Ford Kiernan and John Paul Leach are appearing at the Gilded Balloon
at 8.15pm daily, until September 1.

DON'T step out of line or the bogey man will get you. In the space of
30 minutes Michael Barrymore slew his, with an unrehearsed, unscripted,
bravura performance.
One of the country's biggest television stars launched into a personal
confession because, he said, he wanted to avoid becoming just another
sad, drunken, suppressed homosexual caught in a self-destructive
tailspin, another sad statistic of stars who die in seedy motel rooms.
Fine by me, if that matters.
Lifting the burden of secrecy and deceit may mean that other problems
which plague him will evaporate.
What is worrying is that the kind of tactics that dragged him out of
the closet came close to dragging him under. Why on earth should he be
forced to declare his sexuality anyway?
Why is it that at a time when tolerance or understanding of different
sexual preferences is supposed to be greater than ever before, there
should be such a voracious appetite for sexual scuttlebutt?
The shenanigans which began with a man unravelling, hounded from bar
to bedroom, involved a cruel display of lynch-law journalism, and an
equally ugly response when he lashed out at a Sun photographer, ended
with his admission on late-night radio that he never expected that it
would turn out the way it had. But say it he did, loud and clear. He is
homosexual.
There is a case for exposing hypocrisy, public utterances at variance
with private conduct. That is Outrage's justification for outing the odd
sad bishop or slippery politician, although it is a thin one. But
Michael Barrymore?
He is a popular entertainer. How can it matter to the sum of human
existence what he does with his willy?
Presumably the justification of those who set the hallooing tabloid
hounds on the long pursuit of Barrymore -- never far from tears or
unfocused rage, drowning in drink -- finally running him to ground in a
gay bar, will be a ''human interest'' defence.
Is it human, do you think, to show such a perverse interest in someone
else's sex life that you threaten to destroy them?
There appeared in yesterday's edition of the Sun an editorial of such
exquisite irony, such perfidious claptrap, it would have been hilarious
if it hadn't been so grim: ''If Michael Barrymore is gay, then most
people will say that's his affair,'' it chuntered blithely. ''But you'd
think he would try to be discreet about it for the sake of his fans and
his wife.''
For a piece of breathtaking hypocrisy, from a newspaper which has been
lurking in the shadows of Barrymore's life, like a tormenting spider in
his bath, it could not be surpassed.
Is it a kind of Holy Willy syndrome: the old prurience masquerading as
puritanism, pretending to be outraged in order to be titillated? Or has
it gone beyond that now. Is it sadism masquerading as entertainment?
For at the centre of the sort of exposure which is becoming a regular
feature of the seedier tabloids seems to be an element of cruelty, a
delight in seeing a person twist in the wind. A theatre of cruelty in
which the sexual ''offence'' is secondary to the delight taken in the
embarrassment or pain inflicted on a public figure.
What is it that's so threatening, anyway, about people of the same sex
enjoying emotional and sexual relationships? If you are happy and secure
in your sexuality, what's your problem?
It remains to be seen how much of an effect Barrymore's emotional
outpouring will have on his career and his popularity.
His audiences love his brand of eyebrow-lifting, wrist-dropping
campness. He has spoken of his faith in the tolerance of the viewing
public, which is touching. Let's hope it is well founded. His confession
may have relieved the stress of living with a lie. He now has to live
instead with an ingrained prejudice which in our culture rewards the
kind of search-and-destroy journalism that threatens to take newspaper
ethics and the victims into the same gutter.
We like to see them love and laugh and we like to see them cry: the
evidence is mounting that we are becoming addicted to scuzzy stories
which damage and sometimes ruin people's lives. And that it is the
ruination rather than the stories which we are being conditioned to
enjoy.

AT LAST some signs that television's summer hiatus -- old films, yet
''another chance to see'' programmes we've already seen too often, and,
well, more old films -- is almost over bar the shouting. In fact for the
first time in months we have actually something new to talk about.
Top of the list comes the long-awaited return to earth TV of the best
American series in the history of the universe, The X-Files (BBC2,
Monday). Mulder and Scully (David Duchovny and the beautiful Gillian
Anderson) are back and, once again, all is well with the world. But not,
it seems, with Mulder and Scully.
The new series opens with the pair's special investigations unit
officially closed down by the Feds. Our hero and heroine have been
reassigned to far more down-to-earth, not to mention mundane,
operations. Then Mulder reveals to his partner his mission in life: to
find proof that his wee sister was abducted by aliens years before.
Still in confession mode, he further admits to a major bout of
depression because, despite numerous close encounters with UFOs, he
still possesses no actual evidence that little green men exist. In fact,
whisper it, he's getting fed up in his search for the truth which (as
all X-philes know) is out there. Somewhere.
This all sounds a bit worrying and does not bode well for the coming
series. But worry not. Halfway through episode one, Mulder is summoned
to Washington and asked to investigate an apparent UFO encounter at a
remote radio telescope base in Puerto Rico. And the wee man in the
Brooks Brothers suit is off on a desperate race to beat the nasty Blue
Beret UFO retrieval team who are out to destroy any evidence of
extra-terrestrial activity.
Also returning next week (after an absence of almost 20 years) is the
wonderful Maureen Lipman in Agony Again (BBC1, Thursday) a new sitcom in
which she reprises her role as agony aunt Jane Lucas. Now Jane's moved
on from magazines to television, hosting her own problem-solving
afternoon talk show. Off-screen she still has to cope with her fearsome
Jewish mother Bea (Maria Charles) and her pitchy TV producer Debra
(Maria Charles). Watch out for young Scots actress Valerie Edmond as
Jane's timid and conscientious researcher, Catherine.
Mind you, it's not all good news on the new programmes front. Saturday
evening television continues to be as good a reason as any for going out
to the pub with the return of the dreaded Challenge Aneka, featuring the
woman who (in a recent straw poll in this office) emerged as the TV
personality most people would like to whack across the face with a
baseball bat.
Designed to make you feel warm and tickly all over, this programme is
a bit like taking too much sugar in your tea. It also comes dangerously
close, frankly, to providing free advertising on the BBC. Not for
nothing do these obscure commercial companies jump at the chance to help
when that nice Ms Rice (don't you find her so bloody patronising?)
phones them up.
And it is no better on ITV. The awful Shane Richie (of whom it has
been said ''Is there no beginning to this man's talents?'') will
challenge Aneka head-on of a Saturday evening with the
imaginatively-titled The Shane Richie Experience, described as ''a
feel-good, fast-paced, hi-energy, entertainment show''.
What it is, in fact, is a game show with a format which sounds just
about as yukkie as you can get. It features three engaged couples (with
their respective wedding guests making up the audience) competing in a
knockout competition for a sexy honeymoon prize. They are ably assisted
in the opening offering by three of the biggest names in showbiz -- Dan
Falzon, Dieter Brummer, and Ken Morley. Well, they are apparently quite
big in Neighbours, Home And Away, and Coronation Street respectively.
Meanwhile Mr Richie (the only man on earth who can make even Danny
Baker look good in the Daz adverts) will sing on stage accompanied by a
20-strong choir from Manchester, all of them dressed up as Elvis
Presley, together with the only female Elvis impersonator in Britain.
The show is described (by the bloke who made it) as ''a huge emotional
rollercoaster from start to finish''. Clearly it falls very much into
the ''haud me back'' category of popular television.
So what else is new? Well, a couple of one-offs look promising.
There's an excellent two-part comedy thriller, Runway One (BBC1, Sunday
and Monday), starring Andrew Connolly and our own Peter Capaldi as two
Irish cops on the trail of an international conspiracy involving guns,
sex, drugs, and . . . em . . . beef.
Writer Barry Devlin's script is based on a rumour that during the
Irangate affair the Yanks refuelled their planes at Shannon Airport. The
film opens with Capaldi and Connolly, two Irish Gardai on routine
patrol, discovering a half-crazed gun-toting American. They give chase
and it takes them from the wild Irish countryside all the way to Cuba
and on to New York.
Actress turned author Carrie Fisher makes her debut as a TV writer and
presenter with Carrie On Hollywood (BBC1, Thursday), the first of two
documentaries in which this former showbiz kid lifts the lid on
Tinseltown.
Ms Fisher presents an acutely observant portrayal of life -- or what
passes for it -- in Movieville, California. And she should know. Her mum
and dad were Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, Liz Taylor was her
stepmother, she was married to Paul Simon, and she starred as Princess
Leia in Star Wars. She is also a reformed alcoholic and drug addict.
''I didn't have so much a childhood as a career,'' she remarks wryly.
''By 25 I felt like a has-been. All I knew was the celebrity life. I
watched TV to see what people did in the real world.''
In Thursday's programme, Ms Fisher goes in to anthropologist mode to
examine togetherness's short shelf-life in Hollywood. She follows
people, famous and obscure, through divorce, adoption, impulse weddings,
serial marriage, and meets a mobile sperm-bank operator who serves the
needs of women who no longer want a man in their lives.
Star Wars director George Lucas talks about California's peculiarly
liberal law which allows single men like himself to adopt children. This
compulsive documentary ends on a sad note as Maurice and Cathy Under
give the full funeral treatment -- the minister, the flowers, the
tearful mourners -- to their pet dog. It could only happen in Hollywood.
Which brings us on to something which could only happen in New York.
Taxicab Confessions (BBC2, Sunday) is a candid,
fly-on-the-car-windscreen documentary about the things people say in the
back seat of a yellow cab. Recorded at nights over a four-week period in
the Big Apple, it reveals the innermost thoughts and opinions of a
series of oddball passengers, unaware that they are being filmed.
There's the off-duty cop who recounts lurid scenes of death and
destruction as if they were everyday events; a young woman who talks
about the joys of body piercing; a lesbian who tries to pull her female
cab driver; a hooker who's trying to support her kids and break her
crack habit; an ageing violin player who recounts his sexual conquests
while playing Sweet Georgia Brown; and (shades of the old Levi's advert)
a transsexual who describes in graphic detail her operation and what
it's like to have sex with a bloke.
Complementing the documentary is the first showing on British
television of Martin Scorsese's violent and controversial masterpiece
Taxi Driver (BBC2, Monday) starring Robert De Niro as the unhinged
Vietnam vet Travis Bickle (''You talkin' to me?'') and Jodie Foster as
the 12-year-old prostitute he sets out to rescue from her pimp (Harvey
Keitel). It is a disturbing, uncomfortable movie but quite brilliant
nevertheless.
This week sees the last Moving Story (ITV, Tuesday) of the current
series and there seems no guarantee that it will return. Which is a
great shame because it's one of the best contemporary dramas on
television. Could we possibly have seen the last of Bamber and
Adrenalin? Surely not.
Tuesday's episode, Canterbury Tales, is directed by whatshisname, Phil
Davis (Adrenalin himself), to whom there is a great deal more than meets
the doobery eye. Earlier this year he directed ID, a not-at-all-bad
feature film about soccer violence and racism which also starred Warren
Clarke (Bamber).
And finally this week the network pilots for two potential sitcom
series from our own BBC Scotland comedy unit. Atletico Partick (BBC1,
Monday) is the latest offering from Iain Pattison, who created Rab C,
and there's more than a passing nod to the Nesbitt sense of humour in
this funny, if a tad patchy, wee programme.
It centres on a Sunday pub league football team which hasn't won a
game since decimalisation and desperately needs a new manager.
Determined to save the club, players Jack (Gordon Kennedy) and Budd
(Jonothan Watson) turn to the once legendary Jinky Baird (Clive Russell)
and persuade him to come out of his alcohol-induced stupor to coach the
team. Off the field, Jack's wife, whose last sexual thrill was fondling
the peaches in Safeway, threatens to leave him.
Kennedy pops up again as the true-blue Tory owner of a Scottish
souvenir shop in Mac (BBC2, Friday), a new comedy written by the former
Lottery show host's Absolutely partner Jack Docherty. Docherty himself
stars as a rabid Scottish Nationalist whose extreme ''Eat The English''
views keep getting him into soapy.

ALL THAT'S sadder than little boys who grow up mean is the spectacle
of the mean little urchins who never do. Punk was urchins' music if it
was anything, but watching John ''Rotten'' Lydon and the rest of the
superannuated toe rags on Arena: Punk and The Pistols (BBC2, Sunday)
seemed infinitely depressing. After 20 years, was that it? Greying fans
of a dozen other bands, the Clash and the Buzzcocks foremost among them,
will have questioned both the structure and the premise of Paul
Tickell's piece.
Pioneering punk the Sex Pistols may have been, like the first blow in
a brawl, but it is laughable even to suggest they were the music's only
begetters, as Malcolm McLaren, their lovable rogue of a former manager
(lovable if he didn't owe you money) is wont to do. Punk was a virus, a
form of spontaneous combustion, a tidal thing. No-one ''invented'' it
any more than anyone can claim to have invented the three (four for the
pretentious) chords the early bands shared among themselves.
Nevertheless, punk and the Pistols it was, like Morecambe and Wise on
speed. The dark secret -- that more people laughed at the band than
loved them -- was shunted to one side and their competitors, not least
the vastly more adventurous Clash, were granted only a couple of clips
and the odd sneer. Lydon and McLaren, old suing partners, went through
their familiar routines and a familiar tale of alienated youth and
rock'n'roll swindles was unfolded.
It seemed odd, and strangely touching in these days when the music
industry is more industry than music, how jolly it all appeared. Some
made it, some did not, but at the time none among them -- and this may
be the only point of pop -- really believed it would last. Compare and
contrast, as the questions in the sociology essays are probably
demanding even now.
Contrast, if you prefer, Michael Moore's TV Nation (BBC2, Monday) with
attempts by his British counterparts to produce zany consumer
television. Of what can we boast? Esther Rantzen. Enough, I think, said.
Moore's talent, if talent it is, lies in the fact that he is beyond
embarrassment. He cannot be fazed, as they say, or put off. If he
decides to hire a hoodlum from the Bronx to stand for President he will
ensure that somehow, somewhere, his hoodlum from the Bronx will wind up
face to face with Bob Dole. If he decides that a bank has stiffed the
city of New York and its own employees he will not hesitate, like the
man of the people he is, to find a six-foot crime-fighting chicken
prepared to confront the bad guys in their lair.
It may be, of course, that American public life is in such a state of
decay that only such off-the-wall methods will make an impact. It may
be, too, that such nonsense is no more than the norm in American
television.
Moore, as we know from his previous work, is a man of serious purpose.
Yet when he stoops to work like this he still somehow seems a step up
from the condescending prattle of the sainted Esther.
A step in the right direction -- more of an amble, really -- was the
return of Northern Exposure, a series of inexplicable charm, for a
welcome fifth outing. Why laugh when Doctor Joel contracts ''glaccy with
male persons''. What this meant was that society's treatment of gays has
not improved such a lot; what it really showed was that when the
establishment, however defined, sets out to nail you it will use a
sledgehammer.
Corin Redgrave read from Wilde, and did so exceedingly well, while
John Sessions narrated with assurance. But once again it was left to
Owen Dudley Edwards actually to explain what the trials were all about,
and he did so in fascinating style, following the tracks of a political
plot all the way to the Cabinet. Those who thought they had heard it all
before were sadly mistaken.
The same cannot be said of those who thought, turning to Lisa Clayton
Alone Around the World (BBC2, Tuesday) that they had seen it all before.
They were dead right. One of these days the people who make
documentaries on Britain's heroes and heroines will own up to the fact
that heroism is now a career. People no longer set off up mountains or
across oceans simply for the hell of it but rather for the sponsorship,
and the book, and, come to that, the resulting TV documentary.
Notable of Clayton's piece was that she had nothing much of interest
to say about this planet of ours except when it was trying to kill her
by tossing her yacht around like a child's toy. Otherwise she came over
like a jolly schoolgirl for whom the jape is too, too much. As it was
for this reviewer.
Still, top marks to the Beeb for whizzing her around the entire globe
in 30 minutes. Perhaps they should consider giving cricket the same
treatment.

A GOOD 10 minutes into her prologue to Favourite Tunes, not for the
first time, Ailie Munro lost her way. ''What was I saying?'' she asked.
The short answer was: far too much.
The long answer: such riveting snippets as ''ballads are songs that
tell stories'', and ''songs have words and tunes''. Hold the front page.
The natives were growing restless. (A few left muttering about the
whereabouts of the songs.) The singers were champing at the bit.
Eileen Penman sang sweetly, if somewhat breathlessly, contributing a
Soldier Maid with knowing nods and winks and enthusiasm that compensated
for her early uncertainty.
Cy Lawrie, taking a night off from pulling pints, was at his rugged
best on a mournful, gravitas-laden Heir O' Linn. And Sheena Wellington,
''inviting'' audience participation with customary good-natured
bossiness, was in particularly fine voice on Binoorie, on which her
singing was clear and sincere and her hand actions during the drowning
sequence seemed peculiarly emphatic.

THE names filter out through the darkness. These are the people whose
words and gestures will resonate throughout this piece. Tawnni, Gloria,
Ruth, Jean. The men and women who spoke freely to Bill T Jones of their
lives, of their terminal illnesses, their deaths, at Survival Workshops
across America. And when their words, their gestures, their (video-ed)
faces occur on stage, it's not an offensive exploitation of pitiable
victims -- it's a celebration of spirit, a poignant and fierce
witnessing of the need to be alive.
Still/Here is choreographed in two parts. Still, is essentially a
meeting with the sorrows, fears and pain that strike in the wake of
diagnosis. The dancers dressed in cool white and blue, conjure images of
sudden arrest in the midst of general bizz. And yet, time and again, as
a figure falters, drops, there are quick arms, ready to hold and
support.
Even so, the truth is never sugared: the ultimate struggles happen
alone -- as in the abrasive solo moves of Odile Reine-Adelaide, her body
screaming out the anguish of an endangered femaleness while the voice of
folk singer Odetta shrieks out slash, poison or burn, the excoriating
litany of treatment for breast cancer which is part of Kenneth
Frazelle's sensitive and impressive score for this section.
This part, too, holds the utterly affecting monologue in which Larry
Goldhuber details the death of his mother Gloria from cancer.
Goldhuber's words are simple, they could be our very own. He doesn't
just talk of her death, but of his reactions, of the sudden spat that
flares between him and a relative -- they still haven't spoken. What an
enduring grief is left unsaid in that.
The second part, Here, moves us forward into an area where hope is
warming the scenario. Costumes here are shades of red with an occasional
bright yellow. The text is charged with a gritty resilience -- life is
too precious to let any disease win without a fight. Again Jones's
choreography, with its vivid mix of styles, accommodates the use of
mobile screens which drop in and out, holding the appropriate and tender
images of Gretchen Bender.
At no time does one feel that these images are intrusive or
gratuitous. As the piece builds to an utter affirmation of life, a
series of faces look steadily out at us -- a reminder of how the screen
can trick us, but also comfort us, with glimpses of a life that defies
mortality.

THE dark and chilling intensity of Schubert's song cycle Winterreise
(Winter Journey) brought an unexpectedly autumnal nip to the second
recital by Peter Schreier and Andras Schiff.
Happily recovered from the lingering cold which had affected his
performance of Die schone Mullerin, Schreier quickly quelled our nagging
fear that his voice might not do what his heart and brain so obviously
commanded. ''The girl spoke of love, her mother even of marriage,'' he
sang at the beginning and as he walked, rejected, out of his
girlfriend's life so as not to disturb her dreams, we travelled with him
on his lonely journey beyond the bitter end. Through major and minor, in
all shades of darkness, in all weather, and on all surfaces from ice to
stone -- where he walked, we walked.
We saw the weather vane spin on the rooftop, felt the disappointment
at the postman's empty bag, brushed the frost from our hair, ducked the
hailstones, shrank from the snarling dogs and cawing crows, scratched
our names with his on the ice and tossed away the sleepless night with
him.
When finally we dreamed of the bright flowers blossoming in May it was
only to share the bitter taste of waking to emptiness. The major-minor
poignancy of the inn, where the rooms are all taken, was only a
temporary halt in a graveyard.
The hurdy-gurdy man was waiting and, disturbingly, the journey
continued -- who knows where? That Andras Schiff managed to reflect
every colour in each song was a remarkable feat, but when ''the
fountains played limpid and clear'' the droplets fairly ran off the
keyboard.
Song recitals like these should carry a health warning: too much
despair on a Friday evening can seriously damage your weekend, but what
despair.

AT last we have some serious thought being given to the detail of the
Scottish Assembly idea which has been such a useful slogan through the
long years of Labour Opposition.
I am one who regards this idea as very dangerous and damaging both to
Scotland and the United Kingdom, so you might expect me to be glad that
the proposals so far have been so badly drawn up.
But I am not glad about this at all. The only thing I can see that
would be worse than taking away Scottish affairs from Parliament would
be to do so and pass them to a badly drafted and unstable new system.
Such a change would never survive the pressures of conflict which it
would create.
It would be a mistake to imagine that if this botched-up scheme failed
we could simply repeal it and go back to the present system. This would
be most unlikely, and very probably everyone would feel so let down
that, irrespective of the facts or Scotland's real needs, a desperate
turning to separation would be the result. This would be a disaster for
us all.
So, in spite of the problems it causes, I welcome the new readiness to
confront the enormous holes there are in the plans so far announced.
What are these holes?
First, of course, there is the question of money. It always was the
case in the real world that Parliament must control public expenditure.
It could never let a Scottish Assembly run amok, spending unlimited
money that it had no responsibility for raising.
So the idea had to come in of tax-raising powers, and the so-called
''tartan tax''. It would be hard to imagine a more unpopular idea, or
one that would be more damaging to Scottish business. Our firms, most of
whom depend on the UK market, would have to compete with rivals who did
not have to pay the tartan tax. This issue is now tearing the so-called
convention apart and I hope Tony Blair and Gordon Brown will be able to
stand firm. If they don't, their whole economic policy would be
threatened with collapse before it even started.
There is no sign yet that the convention is prepared to tackle the
problem of the role of the Scottish MPs. At present it seems to be
blandly assumed that Scottish MPs will continue to vote in Parliament on
all matters as if nothing had changed. And yet they will no longer
determine policy on Scottish issues such as housing, education and
health.
The situation is to be made worse by the probability that a Labour
majority in Parliament would not exist without Scottish Labour votes.
Perpetual controversy and conflict would be the result.
Tony Blair seems to have turned his back on the previous idea of
devolving the same subjects to assemblies in England. Although I, and
most others I suspect, do not favour such a quaint idea, at least it
would have some logic behind it. All MPs in the UK would at least be
voting on the same basis once more.
These troubles, in turn, could not fail to stir up the question of the
numbers of Scotland's MPs. I do not favour any reduction but it is very
hard to justify the present numbers in relation to those in England. We
probably have at least six more than we are due, and some put the figure
at 10 or more depending on how you calculate it.
The surprising thing is that the Labour Party are not more worried
about this, for it is they who have by far the largest numbers of
Scottish MPs to lose. Indeed, any major reduction would make it hard for
Labour ever to get a majority in Britain as a whole.
If Labour were to win a General Election they would at last have real
power in Britain. All the failures of the Labour Party to win elections
and the long years of Opposition would be behind them. Why put all this
at risk of failure by an ill-thought-out scheme designed in another age
to head off a challenge from the SNP?
Many people in Scottish business are very nervous for the future if
these assembly plans go ahead, but they would all be pleased to see
these flaws in the scheme being properly tackled. It would be so much
better to do this before the damage is done.

EVEN at the beginning you sensed he didn't get it. Lounging in an
Edinburgh hotel on a grey afternoon in October, 1988, while he tried to
assess news reports, field telephone calls, and conduct an interview,
Salman Rushdie seemed oddly serene. With a hurricane gathering, the
writer was mellifluent, relaxed, almost cocky.
India had just banned his new novel, but that was no big deal.
Indira Gandhi, the housewife-superstar herself, had sued him over a
previous book, while an indelicate sketch of Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto
(''the virgin Ironpants'') had gained publicity for another. Besides,
even as a kid in Karachi, exiled from his beloved Bombay, he had run
into trouble with the censor.
That afternoon Rushdie talked of fundamentalism. He had no wish to
upset believers -- murderous riots, in which 22 were to die, distressed
him greatly -- but he had no time for hypocrisy. He was a non-Muslim
Muslim, black in a white world, a product of Rugby and Cambridge who
dreamed in Urdu, a magic realist who had been eloquent against racism
and fundamentalism. The reaction to The Satanic Verses was no more than
he had expected.
Rushdie gave good copy, in other words; even if the newsdesk didn't
quite see it that way. Before the fatwa, before the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini leader of Twelver Shi'ism in revolutionary Iran, ordered the
death without trial of a British subject, few did. The author was not
alone in thinking it would blow over.
Born in Bombay on June 19, 1947, two months before Indian independence
and four months before partition brought forth Pakistan, Rushdie was one
of Midnight's Children, as his Booker Prize-winning novel called those
born as the dream of national self-determination came to fruition, and
as the nightmare of religious conflict was beginning.
He inherited all the contradictions of one whose ''reflex reaction'',
as he once said, is ''simultaneously Eastern and Western''. His parents
were upper-middle-class Muslims and Rushdie, with three sisters, grew up
in ''a tradition of books and story-telling''. Sent first to Bombay's
Cathedral School, he was despatched at the age of 14 to Rugby, where he
learned about race as a lonely stranger in what must have seemed a very
strange land. ''I was suddenly an Indian,'' he has said, ''and at
schoolboy level that was no fun.''
In 1964, reluctantly, his parents moved to Karachi. Having graduated
in history from King's, Cambridge, in 1968, after a period happier but
no less uneasy than his schooldays, Rushdie returned to Pakistan but did
not linger. A TV play he produced and an article he wrote were
prohibited by the government.
Back in London he struggled as an actor before working, with a good
deal more success, as an advertising copy-writer. To the glittering
prizes of fiction and the honours earned in the defence of freedom,
Rushdie can add whatever credit goes with being the man who described
Aero as ''delectabubble''. He also married an Englishwoman, Clarissa
Luard, who bore him a son, Zafar, now 16. He divorced her in 1987.
In 1975 his first novel, Grimus, arrived still-born. It was not until
1981, when London's attention began to turn to what is still,
patronisingly, known as ''Commonwealth'' literature, that he hit the
jackpot with Midnight's Children. It was in this period, too, that he
began to make a name as a critic of colonialism; a man who could write:
''Four hundred years of conquest and looting, centuries of being told
you are superior to the fuzzy-wuzzies and the wogs, leave their stain on
all of you''.
In 1983 he published Shame, telling of power struggles in Pakistan.
If history has a taste for irony it will record that the work was
named Novel of the Year by Iran's Ministry of Islamic Guidance. It
contributed to Rushdie's growing reputation but did nothing to resolve
his contradictions: Indian-born yet Oxbridge-educated, a supporter of
the Third World yet a cosmopolitan Londoner, a beneficiary of British
freedoms yet a critic of Britain's flaws, a secularist who took his
Islamic inheritance as his subject.
In 1985 he met the American writer Marianne Wiggins and in 1988 they
married, one week after he completed The Satanic Verses. In 1989 she
dedicated her novel John Dollar to ''Beloved Salman''; by 1991 she had
changed her tune. Rushdie, who in 1984 had written: ''We may not approve
of Khomeini's Iran but the revolution there was a genuine mass
movement'' was about to discover the meaning of ''prescient''.
It is easier to say what Rushdie did not do in his 547-page novel
rather than what he did. First, given that the Prophet is not held to
have been divine, he did not commit blasphemy in the Western sense. He
did not satirise Allah, nor did he insult living Muslims. Islam
recognises two sorts of blasphemy -- ta-alluh, to insult God; and kofr,
to deny Islam.
Rushdie was guilty only of the latter.
True, he had not sought to avoid trouble. Naming prostitutes after the
12 wives of the Prophet was hardly sensitive. Equally, there is a
character called Mahoun, a term of derision, who represents Mohammed.
The novel also portrays Khomeini as a man-eating demon. To call Mecca
''Jahilia'' -- ''ignorance'' in Arabic -- was not delicate.
''Verses'' is meanwhile translatable into the Islamic languages with a
term connoting all 6236 lines of the Koran, not just the two lines
tradition says were intruded by Satan. In Iran and elsewhere Rushdie
appeared to have written a novel entitled ''The Satanic Koran''.
On January 14, 1989, copies were burned in Bradford. On January 28,
8000 Muslims demonstrated in London's Hyde Park. By February the
Pakistani National Assembly had voted unanimously to condemn the book
and its author.
Bans in Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and India quickly
followed.
At first, Rushdie declined to take the controversy seriously. His
novel was merely ''a love song to our mongrel selves''. And besides, as
a non-believer, how could he blaspheme? He quoted his novel: ''Where
there is no belief there is no blasphemy.'' He still didn't get it, but
on February 14, 1989, Khomeini announced the fatwa.
In Shi'ite jurisprudence fatwas can lapse when the promulgator dies.
Secondly, fatwas are only valid for the world of Islam and not the dar
al-harb, the extra-Islamic world. Khomeini himself, for his own reasons,
had argued that maslahat, or ''interest'', the interest of the state,
could prevail over religious injunctions. None of this mattered.
Rushdie went into hiding, with $1m on his head. As Wiggins later told
one newspaper, in four months they slept in no fewer than 56 beds.
Airlines refused to carry him. Having no address, he was unable to
vote. One year after the fatwa Rushdie's publishers, Viking Penguin, had
sold one million hardback copies of The Satanic Verses and earned a
''profit'' of $3.3m while spending $4.4m on security measures. The
company received 5000 threatening letters and 25 bomb warnings. Five
explosive devices were found in Penguin shops.
Protection was extended to Rushdie amid grumbling about taxpayers
footing the bill (in reality, the writer has handed over ''large
amounts'' to the Treasury). Some seemed to suggest that living hell was,
on balance, no more than an uppity immigrant deserved. Hugh
Trevor-Roper, otherwise Lord Dacre, was typical, asking who ''would not
shed a tear if some British Muslims, deploring his manners, should
waylay (Rushdie) in a darkened street and seek to improve them''.
As for politicians, Edward Heath mourned the loss of ''masses of
trade'' for the sake of a ''wretched book''. Geoffrey Howe, meantime,
promised to ''explore the possibility of taking necessary steps under
British law to resolve the problem created by the publication of this
book''.
Norman Tebbit excelled himself, stating: ''His public life has been a
record of despicable acts of betrayal of his upbringing, religion,
adopted home and nationality. Now he betrays even his own sneers at the
British establishment as he cowers under the protection of a government,
a police force, and a society he once denounced as racist and
undemocratic.''
Speaking for men of God, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said he
''understood'' the Muslim reactions since The Satanic Verses ''contained
an outrageous slur on the Prophet''. Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits
attacked Rushdie's affront to religion generally. Cardinal John J.
O'Connor of New York urged Catholics not ''to dignify the publication of
this work''.
In June, 1989, Khomeini's death brought hope. The campaign in
Rushdie's defence was gathering pace, the ayatollah's theological
arguments were under fire, and governments were beginning to understand
that Iran was practising a new sort of terrorism. Yet in the battles
between hard-liners and moderates in Tehran, the Rushdie affair was too
valuable to discard.
Then, early in 1991, Rushdie announced he had embraced Islam.
Writing in the New York Times, to the dismay of supporters like Tariq
Ali, who promptly deserted him, he said: ''I do not agree with any
statement in my novel The Satanic Verses uttered by any of the
characters who insults the prophet Mohammed, or casts aspersions upon
Islam, or upon the authenticity of the Holy Koran, or who rejects the
divinity of Allah''.
In fact, Rushdie had turned for help to Egyptian clerics, not least
because the mullahs of Cairo had opposed Khomeini's death sentence on
grounds of Islamic law. The head of Cairo's Supreme Council of Scholars
of Islamic Affairs attested in London to his conversion. Nevertheless,
Radio Tehran dismissed it immediately. The bounty went up to $2m, plus
expenses.
In July of 1991 Ettore Capriolo, an Italian translator, was knifed by
an Iranian demanding Rushdie's address. In August Hitoshi Igarashi,
Rushdie's Japanese translator, was stabbed to death. Penguin backed down
over a paperback, leaving it to an anonymous ''consortium'' to produce
the edition, while British diplomats returned to Tehran. It was business
as usual.
That year Wiggins and Rushdie parted. Salman was ''beloved'' no more
and she told the press, in a bitter farewell: ''All of us who love him,
who were devoted to him, who were friends of his, wish that the man had
been as great as the event. That's the secret everyone is trying to keep
hidden. He is not. He's not the bravest man in the world but will do
anything to save his life.''
It is life, the tiny details, that he has forfeited. For years he did
not see his son and his existence was ''telephonic''. His guards became
his ''extended family'' and the effort just to keep his cause in the
public mind often appeared too much. As Saleem Sinai, the protagonist of
Midnight's Children, put it, he had ''become mysteriously handcuffed to
history''.
Today the pressure is less. He attends book launches and parties and
sometimes he makes public appearances. In May, indeed, he appeared on
the Letterman Show and next month The Moor's Last Sigh, ''the big, fat
novel'' he has talked about since 1992, will be published.
Yet Rushdie remains a prisoner, hostage to his art, captive of the two
cultures which made him. ''Is speech free or is it not?'' Iran asked;
the West has yet to answer.

THE consortium hoping to take control of Partick Thistle confirmed
yesterday that, by the end of next week, a firm bid would be made for
the majority shareholding held by club chairman Jim Oliver.
The consortium yesterday would not disclose what value they placed on
the shareholding. Mr Oliver is understood to be asking #2.25m for his
500,000-plus shares.
The club has a total shareholding of around 700,000.
A financial review of Scottish clubs for the 1993-94 season, published
earlier this week by accountants Price Waterhouse, revealed that Thistle
made a profit of #394,000 and had a turnover of #1.7m. The club had bank
borrowings of #811,000 during the same period.
Four members of the consortium discussed their latest move over a
''working lunch'' in Glasgow yesterday in one of the six Indian
restaurants owned by Mr Charan Gill, one of the group behind the
takeover.
As well as Mr Gill, other consortium members at the lunch included Mr
George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead; Mr Ron McKay, a
journalist; and Mr Imran Muneer, editor of the Scottish Asian Voice
newspaper.
The consortium, which Mr Galloway said had ''between four and eight
members,'' also includes Mr Maq Rasul, the owner of the Global video
chain.
Mr Galloway said other discussions involving ''fugitive consortium
members'' had broken up at 3am yesterday and would continue over the
weekend. They also met a ''football analyst'' yesterday.
Mr McKay said: ''We expect that an offer will be in place for the
majority shareholding held by Mr Oliver by the end of next week.
''We have an idea of what we believe the price should be and believe
this is a fair price. We intend to offer Mr Oliver and the other board
members continued involvement in the club. If he doesn't want that, that
will be the end of it as far as we are concerned.''
The consortium had been encouraged by the ''overwhelming support'' for
the venture shown by Thistle fans through the media.
Mr Galloway added that it would be ''nice'' if this could be reflected
at today's premier division match between Partick and Hibs at Firhill
which several consortium members would attend, although he said he had
no desire that present board members should be barracked in any way.
The MP said he believed the consortium could tap into the latent
support of about 25,000 who claimed to be supporters but who seldom
attended home matches, which have average gates of about 6000.
Asked how the consortium could improve matters, he said: ''We can
certainly provide access to cash for players which I think it can be
safely assumed by the record of the past three years that Partick
Thistle's current board cannot.
''And we can provide a shot in the arm, Asian capital, Asian
entrepreneurship, and Asian interest in the sport, including through the
gates.''
Mr Gill, who owns three bars and a frozen food factory in Glasgow as
well as the restaurants, said: ''We will just have to wait and see what
happens from here.''
He has maintained that his business partners were interested only in
outright ownership of Thistle, not just investing in it, and said a bid
to buy the club was not just a financial proposition but an attempt to
put something back into the community.
Mr Oliver was on a pre-arranged golfing break in England and was not
available for comment. On Thursday he had told The Herald he planned to
be at the club's helm for another four years at least.
Club secretary Robert Reid repeated that no approaches had been made
to the club concerning any take-over bid.

With the world's stockpiles of spent uranium fuel rods rapidly
reaching capacity, Dounreay is being proposed as a reprocessing site for
the nuclear nations' waste, as David Ross discovers
THE prospect of Dounreay establishing itself as the world's nuclear
dustbin was being talked up again yesterday with reports that the
Caithness plant has been in contact with the Hahn Meitner Institute in
Berlin which is currently frustrated by the delay in America accepting
its spent nuclear fuel.
Dounreay is willing to accept 52 of the total of 150 German fuel rods
for reprocessing, but this would only make economic sense to the
Caithness plant if the 52 are followed by hundreds, or perhaps
thousands, of other rods. The fact is that there are 15,000 such rods
out there, and foreign governments are anxiously searching for a home
for them. They would accept anything, even a short-term let, as long as
it is furth of their own shores.
This represents the legacy left by post-war Western governments'
attempts to employ nuclear power for peaceful purposes. In particular,
since the 1950s America has supplied nuclear technology to ''friendly''
countries, but only if they undertook not to develop nuclear weapons.
This meant that highly enriched uranium (HEU) was sent out to about 43
countries across Europe, and further afield, for 20 years for use in
research reactors.
This continued until 1978 when the Carter administration became
concerned at the proliferation of such weapons-grade material. A new
policy was developed, ''reduced enrichment research and test
programme'', which was designed to persuade reactor operators to convert
to low-enriched uranium (LEU), which could not be used in weapons
production. Unfortunately, however, the LEU was more expensive and less
efficient.
To help the programme, America said that if the reactors did convert
to LEU, they could send their HEU fuel back to the US. This policy,
however, lapsed in 1988 and since then research reactors have been
stockpiling their waste waiting for a new option. Now they are running
out of capacity and face the very real prospect of having to close.
Before America would take any more fuel back, an environmental impact
statement (EIS) would have to be prepared. But reprocessing at Dounreay
was not seen as the answer. Indeed it was viewed as undermining its
non-proliferation policy because the reprocessing leaves radioactive
waste plus weapons-grade material which can be used again. As recently
as 1993, the US Department of Energy offered the Belgian research
reactor operators SCK-CEN some $500,000 not to proceed with a
reprocessing contract at Dounreay.
The DoE then successfully persuaded Congress to allow the waste from
six European research reactors into America before the EIS was
completed. It specifically warned that otherwise ''it would encourage
reprocessing, thus risking the uncontrolled proliferation and
distribution of the HEU . . .''
Official American attitudes to reprocessing at Dounreay were to
undergo a fairly radical change, partly because of continued domestic
resistance to the waste coming into America, not least from Carroll
Campbell, the governor of South Carolina where the military
nuclear-complex of Savannah River is located.
In addition, our own Department of Trade and Industry had been
lobbying American counterparts to send HEU to Dounreay for reprocessing.
The DTI has always denied this but The Herald obtained a letter dated
May 19, 1994 from Dr Derek Pooley, chief executive of the UK Atomic
Energy Authority's government division to Dr Timothy Walker, head of the
atomic energy division at the DTI.
In it Dr Pooley refers to telephone conversations with Dr Ken Bulmahn
and Alex Murray who were working on the EIS. Dr Pooley wrote: ''I was
somewhat surprised to find out that neither . . . knew anything about
your suggesting to the US DoE that it made sense for the British at
Dounreay to deal with spent European MTR (Material Testing Reactor)
fuel, leaving the Americans to handle fuel where there was a real
proliferation threat.''
Dr Pooley also made clear that a year ago the Americans had ''not
seriously considered the Dounreay option at all''. But the idea
certainly grew on them, and earlier this year the DoE launched a major
public consultation procedure asking American citizens their view.
Basically, did they want the waste to come to America or go to Dounreay
for reprocessing, or a mixture of both?
The consultation lasted 60 days and ended on July 20. The Scottish
people have not been consulted, but since then Highland Regional
Council's director of law and administration, Harold Farquhar, has
written to the DoE warning that no waste should be shipped to Dounreay
until the serious problems of radioactive contamination currently facing
the plant have been remedied.
Even then, importation of foreign nuclear waste for reprocessing would
become a source of serious political conflict, Mr Farquhar warned.
That may prove to be an understatement. Certainly the next scheduled
meeting of the Dounreay/Highland region liaison committee next month
promises to be a pretty frank affair.

British television does not rate very highly with Janet Street-Porter.
Entertainments writer Allan Laing heard her explain why, in no uncertain
terms, when she delivered the McTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh
Television Festival
THERE may not have been managerial blood on the walls of St Cuthbert's
Church last night -- but it was not for the want of trying on the part
of the redoubtable Janet Street-Porter as she delivered the Edinburgh
Television Festival's annual McTaggart Lecture.
The former high-profile BBC executive and now managing director of the
L!VETV cable channel launched a ferocious onslaught on the suits who run
the British television industry, slamming them for killing creativity
and, well, for taking all the fun out of the business.
No one was safe. The BBC, ITV, even Channel Four -- they were lined up
to a man (''Why are they always men?'' she asked) and shot between the
eyes by Ms Street-Porter's machine-gun rhetoric.
We had, she said, entered a frighteningly arid period in British
television. A terminal blight had hit the industry, stunting its growth
and severely restricting its development. And what was the blight? It
was management -- the dreaded four Ms . . . male, middle class, middle
aged and mediocre. Britain had always led the world in a number of areas
-- and crummy management was one of them.
''TV isn't fun any more and fun is where ideas breed. Fun is the
fertiliser the ideas factory needs. Today people have lost respect for
television and -- far more damagingly, it has lost respect for itself,''
she said.
Her theme was the crisis facing the industry. It was going nowhere.
The talent was leaving, frustrated and fed up. Morale had never been
lower. Ground-breaking ideas were not getting on to the screen.
Management could be as hand-picked and highly-trained as you like, but
what was it going to be running in 2010? Nothing, unless things changed.
British TV was doomed. It had been ruined by regulation, its
structures were historical and unhelpful, and everyone had forgotten
that television was about talent. The industry was the worst performer
of all the creative businesses. One of the reasons why it performed
worse than, for example, the record industry was the fact that, though
they both were driven by creative talent, the TV industry was ''better
educated and more middle class.''
''Many of the dynamic ideas that made Britain a cultural force have
come from working class people. From music to fashion to computers. Many
of the top people in TV management have never worked outside the system
in which they started and some not even for another employer.
''How can they respond to the pulsating disparate mass, the hothouse
of ideas in a multi-cultural British society, if they all talk in one
accent which was polished at the same universities, and all end up
shopping in the same delicatessens? No wonder the programmes they
commission are all starting to look and feel the same -- vets,
hospitals, detectives,'' she said.
The inefficiencies and failures of British TV started at the top a
long time ago, and it was the talent which was now paying the price for
years of managerial inadequacies and mistakes. In the past it was run by
''a Masonic men's club.'' Now it was business school graduates and
accountants.
''British TV managers are alone in the world's media and entertainment
industry. They are the only gang anywhere who have chosen not to
acknowledge that TV is talent-driven. That it can only survive as a
creative business. media and entertainment businesses everywhere else in
the world make the machine serve the talent whereas we make the talent
serve the machine.
''TV is not a very complicated business. There's the audience on one
side, the talent on the other, and the money in the middle. The task is
to apply the right money to the right talent to make the audience happy.
Because of the way the business is structured now, there is no sense of
partnership. My experience (as head of Independent Production for BBC
Entertainment) brought home to me that all relationships are defined by
being a buyer or a seller. The 'relationship with talent' is reduced to
a constant series of arguments over money. Everything has become a
transaction,'' she added.
So where did it all go wrong? It started, argued Ms Street-Porter,
when ITV bosses decided to separate broadcasting from production, a
classic case of ''corporate thinking'' winning over common sense.
''Network Centre'' (the London-based commissioning body for ITV
programming) sounded more like a sinister John Le Carre idea than a term
to inspire creative talent. As for the BBC, well, it threw the baby out
with the bathwater when the notion of ''objectives'' replaced the notion
of ''ideas''.
Successful media companies had a culture of confidence which nourished
and defined their employees as they worked together with the same set of
beliefs. Granada used to have it -- but it had been smeared too thinly
from Manchester to London's South Bank; London Weekend had been
ethnically cleansed out of existence; and the BBC's was still there but
it had become Bosnian in its defeated and defeatist outlook. Channel
Four's, meanwhile, was still very much intact but it was stuck in a
Sixties timewarp. Once upon a time companies had identities. Now they
only had cashflows as their owners cared less and less about creativity.
The other main problem with British TV was its structure; the way it
responded to legislators and not talent, to corporations and not
creativity. The BBC still focused on internal British political issues
instead of global commercial opportunities (which it had to do in order
to survive).
ITV's regional structure reinforced an inward-looking rather than
outward-looking mentality. Channel Four's constitution allowed it to
undertake almost any commercial venture but it had chosen to do nothing
''and stick to its knitting''.
''TV is losing its audience. Some are inevitably going to the
satellite and cable channels but, more worryingly, many are leaving TV
behind and not coming back -- and these are the most valuable audiences
who are deserting. The young ones and those over 50 who have the highest
disposable income. People are just getting out of the habit of watching
TV and once they have gone you will never get them back,
''TV needs to innovate now more than ever and that is exactly what it
is not doing. Any new innovation is judged quickly and crudely on the
reaction of a mass audience in the first couple of weeks. Having been
set an impossible task it is dispensed with in favour of another formula
show when it fails. ITV is not the home of creativity,'' she added.
But there was a tiny light at the end of the tunnel. A new market was
emerging, destined to become a multi-billion dollar business and it gave
British TV its first -- and possibly last -- chance to be a global
player.
''It's perfect for Britain because it isn't entertainment, which is
already dominated by the US and Japan. It is, in the widest sense of the
word, education or, as I call it, exposition which includes all forms of
learning, training, leisure and lifestyle material, hobby-related
programming as well as education itself.
''The market is definitely emerging, both online and in physical
products. People disagree about when it will arrive, but all agree that
when it does it will be gigantic. The opportunities are as much creative
as commercial. We are truly in the age of the Internet,'' she said.
However, though the UK had all the skills to become the Open
University of the planet, Ms Street-Porter doubted whether we had the
management capable of grasping the opportunity. The BBC, she said, was
in danger of becoming ''the Clark's Shoes of the multi-media world,''
something that your mum would buy for you, but which you'd never choose
for yourself. Yet this multi-media opportunity could make it a huge
world-wide information provider.
Finally, Ms Street-Porter addressed the problem of the scandalous
under-representation of women in television's corridors of power. The
two most powerful and influential people in American television were
Oprah Winfrey and Roseanne Barr. They were huge business.
Here there was a long and distinguished list of talented women -- like
Denise O'Donoghue, Verity Lambert, and Lynda La Plante -- who made
programmes which were watched by millions. But, when you looked at who
commissioned them -- there were fewer women than you could count on the
fingers of one hand.
''Does managing entertainment require testosterone over and above any
other talent? Does understanding what makes a good gameshow need a lot
of jangling of coins in the pocket and rounds of golf with the lads? Is
dealing with creative stars from Lenny Henry to Michael Barrymore to
Jennifer Saunders a task which requires a willy? Why not ask the talent?
You might get some interesting answers,'' she concluded.

SHOPPING around for the best value car or house insurance premium is
second nature to many of us. And the trend seems to be spreading into
the world of life insurance.
Of course, if you have a long-term, investment-type life insurance
policy, such as an endowment designed to repay your mortgage or life
cover that lasts until you die, it is very dangerous to cash in or
surrender the plan early. In the first few years you could get back less
than you've paid in, and may still be offered poor surrender values well
into the life of the policy.
But when it comes to pure protection policies, it is well worth
considering a change of company. The most basic type of protection
insurance is a ''term'' policy where there is no surrender value, so you
may have nothing to lose and a lot to gain by cashing in and starting
again. The cost of these policies soared in the mid-eighties when
insurance companies panicked about Aids-related claims. But in recent
years premiums have come down as they reassess the Aids risks and vye
with each other for business to make up for the slump in endowment and
pension sales.
If you have taken out term insurance within the past decade and have
still to hit 40 -- particularly if it was taken out through a bank or
building society -- there could be big savings to be made by starting
afresh. You may also find newer policies offer a wider range of extras
than previously available.
With a term policy your family receives a lump sum or a regular
tax-free income if you die before a specified age. There is no
investment growth to look forward to -- you simply pay a certain premium
in return for a guaranteed payout. If you survive past that age the
policy just lapses -- there is no return. That may sound harsh until you
look at the levels of premiums involved. A 30-year old, non-smoking male
can buy #100,000 of insurance for 10 years for less than #10 a month, a
fraction of the cost of cover through investment-type insurance.
If you do decide to start again your premium may be higher than before
because you are older, although age-related increases are not too
significant until you get to around 40. But with big falls in premiums
you could still be better off switching to a lower cost company.
It is also important to remember that you will have to make a fresh
application, even if you are staying with the same one. And if you have
run into health problems in the meantime the premiums could be much
higher -- if you are accepted at all. The easiest option is to ask an
independent financial adviser to scour the market to find the best value
policy for your needs.
1 You may also be able to cut the premiums quite dramatically if you
have given up smoking for more than year -- costs can be halved by
taking out a new policy. Also if you are the right weight for your
height, a moderate drinker and come from a healthy family background you
could qualify for lower premiums. The sort of job you do may be taken
into the equation too, with accountants, solicitors and teachers paying
less than roofers, scaffolders and divers.
If you are saving a lot of money by a switch, it could be worth paying
an extra 10% to 15% to give yourself the option of either converting
your term policy to a longer investment-type plan or renewing it for a
further term without having to answer any more medical questions.
Another way to make big inroads into the cost of life insurance is to
claim tax relief on the premiums. You may remember that tax relief for
new ordinary life policies was abolished in 1984. But, if you are
eligible to take out a personal pension plan -- and anyone who is
working, earning and not a member of a company scheme is -- you are also
eligible to take out term insurance and claim full relief at your top
rate of tax on the premiums.
These special pension term policies cost about the same as ordinary
ones, but the availability of tax relief at up to 40% cuts the premiums
substantially. The problem at the moment is that if you lose your job
you lose the ability to contribute. Without earnings you won't be able
to claim tax relief, but, to add insult to injury, insurance companies
insist you start a brand new policy at the rates applicable to your age
and state of health then.

<HEADLINE>Rates of academic interest.   Choosing the right bank account is an important task facing new students.</HEADLINE>

BY now this year's crop of students will be looking forward to their
new life at college or university with a mixture of excitement and
apprehension. Apart from finding out about academic life, though, they
will have to learn fast about the hard facts of financial life.
Choosing a bank account is the first step. All the banks offer special
student accounts in the hope these new recruits will remain life-long
customers. A sign of the times is that one of the most important points
of comparison between these accounts nowadays is the size of their
interest-free overdraft facilities.
Student debt is becoming increasingly common, although according to
the Scottish banks students here are less likely to get into debt than
those in other parts of the UK. Research conducted by Barclays Bank
earlier this year in England and Wales found that on average students
there expected to be in debt to the tune of #2293 by the time they
finished their studies.
Noreen O'Donnell, the Royal Bank of Scotland's manager for student
services, says Scottish students appear to be more debt averse. ''This
may be because they are more likely to continue living at home while
they are studying than students in other parts of the UK.''
After an initial period of resistance, more students also appear to be
turning to the Student Loan Company when they need extra money to top up
their grants rather than running up debts with their banks. In the
coming academic year students living at home will be able to borrow up
to #1065 a year (#780 in their final year) under the Student Loan
Scheme. Those living away from home can apply for loans of up to #1385 a
year (#1010 in their final year), with extra if they study in London.
Repayment of these loans plus interest normally starts on April 1
following completion of their course. The interest rate is adjusted
annually in line with the Retail Price Index. This year's rate has not
yet been fixed, but with inflation slightly up it is likely to be
somewhat higher than last year's 2.3%.
All student bank accounts nowadays offer interest-free overdraft
facilities. There is little to choose between the Scottish banks
initially in this respect. All offer a basic #500 interest-free
facility, though at the Royal Bank it can rise to #750 in the final
year. The TSB offers a tiered overdraft, increasing to #600 in the
second year of the course and #700 in the third. Students should note,
though, that these facilities are not automatic -- they have to be
agreed in advance with the bank. This is important because if they go
into the red without asking they will have to pay the same punative
unauthorised overdraft rates as everyone else -- currently around 30%
plus fees.
Although banks are likely to consider any student requests for
overdrafts sympathetically, they will be keen to find out how and when
they intend to repay what are supposed to act only as temporary stopgaps
-- say, at the end of the term -- before they agree to the facility.
Students who have some savings, or who plan to work during vacations
to top up their grants and want to make the most of this money, may be
more concerned about the interest they will earn when they are in
credit. The Bank of Scotland is currently the most generous in this
regard, paying students 4.75% on credit balances. Next come the Royal
Bank and the TSB, which both pay 3.5%, while the Clydesdale offers a
miserly 0.2%.
It is on interest payments that the Scottish banks (with the exception
of the Clydesdale) score over their English counterparts. In the past
the latter have tried to attract students with a variety of freebies.
Nowadays though they give mainly cash incentives to open accounts with
them instead. Midland and Lloyds, for example, credit new student
accounts with #30, while Barclays and NatWest give #20. TSB is one of
the only banks that still gives freebies. It hands out 10 #2-off movie
vouchers to new student customers and also gives #10 to those who use
its credit card at least three times.
Commission-free travellers' cheques and foreign currency are a
standard feature of student accounts nowadays. Mature students may be
more interested in the Bank of Scotland's student mortgage scheme
though. Applications for up to 100% of valuation will be considered
provided the maximum loan does not exceed #80,000. The only drawback is
that parents must guarantee 20% of the mortgage.
Whichever bank students choose, they should always keep a weather eye
on what the opposition is offering. The building societies are becoming
increasingly competitive in the current account market, but until now
only the Halifax has introduced a special version of its accounts for
students. This pays 4.25% on credit balances and offers an interest-free
overdraft that can increase to #1000 during the student's course. It
also charges the lowest rates on unauthorised overdrafts.

PROFESSIONAL investors in the UK have mainly been wary of Wall Street
for almost a year now. Wall Street, of course, has powered on regardless
hitting new all-time records and rising almost 20% in sterling terms
amid talk of a soft landing for the US economy, low inflation and low
interest rates as far as the eye can see.
The latest survey of fund managers carried out for broker Smith New
Court this month shows the cautious mood persisting. A balance of 41% of
respondents were bullish about Japan on a three-month view -- a major
swing from bearishness in July -- but a balance of 15% were bearish
about the US, almost the same as in July. The UK and continental Europe
were both smiled on with just in excess of 20% bullish.
Wall Street's performance has been impressive and although nothing,
not even the Scottish summer sunshine goes on forever, the broker's
strategy team is positive about the outlook for American shares while
expecting the key Standard &amp; Poors 500 index to rise by less than other
major markets.
Some investors like to keep a proportion of their assets in the US
which they see as a market which should not be ignored. Others see scope
for further advances there anyway. For them, Charles Cade who follows
investment trusts for Smith New Court, argues that seven investment
trusts specialising in the US currently offer ''a very cheap way to gain
US exposure''.
Looking at the US and Japan you find the classic illustration of the
importance of recognising the difference between an investment trust and
an equivalent unit trust. US investment trust prices stand at discounts
to their asset backing, while specialists in Japan are generally at a
premium particularly if you take warrants into account. As unit trusts
are priced on an asset basis it follows that it is cheaper to look at
investment trusts if you want to get into America, while considering
unit trusts if you feel that Japan has at last got its problems under
control -- a proposition not universally accepted -- and is on a
decisive recovery trend.
Mr Cade points out that bearish views about the US have resulted in a
steady widening of the discounts for the specialist trusts. So without
arguing a particular case for America he now feels the trusts offer
''outstanding value for investors who wish to maintain some US
exposure''.
It is not exactly a ''heads you win tails you don't lose'' scenario,
but there is at least the possibility that if or when Wall Street has a
set back the discount would take part of the strain and the trusts'
share prices would not necessarily follow the market all the way down
percentage point by percentage point. A unit trust would, of course,
suffer the same fall as the shares in which it is invested. Even more
optimistically, if sentiment changed towards the US that would be
another reason for the discount to narrow.
The two biggest trusts, American Trust and Fleming American, were at
the time of Mr Cade's scrutiny standing at discounts of 12.7% and 10.7%
respectively. Average discounts for them have been 8.75% and 6.13% and a
year ago there was little or no discount on either.
But the size of a discount is not the only thing to think about. Mr
Cade stresses: ''The nature of the investments will also influence how a
fund performs relative to the US market.'' In a useful analysis he says
the current portfolios of Foreign &amp; Colonial US Smaller Companies,
Fleming American and American Trust are ''relatively defensive'', while
Govett American Smaller Companies has ''an aggressive sector stance''.
As a group, the US investment trusts are heavily overweight in smaller
companies. Only American Trust and Fleming American have focussed on
larger concerns, having 82% and 60% respectively of their assets
invested in S&amp;P 500 companies.
As it happens, larger companies have out-performed smaller ones since
the interest rate cycle turned early last year. However, most fund
managers the broker spoke to were ''positive about the relative
prospects for smaller companies and believed they now look attractive on
a valuation basis,'' says the note. ''There are signs that a rally in
smaller companies may already be underway.''
The biggest discount is on American Opportunity, previously named
Leveraged Opportunity, which invests in a relatively small number,
currently 20, of highly geared stocks -- ''stub'' equities resulting
from such events as leveraged re-capitalisations or buy-outs. It aims
for high capital growth by taking potentially high risk investments. Its
discount is more than 18%.
North Atlantic Smaller Companies, discount around 11%, specialises in
unquoted companies and illiquid stocks which it feels offer value.
Almost 30% of its assets are in the UK and continental Europe. The
broker comments: ''It takes big bets and has high stock specific risk.''
It owns 29% of American Opportunity and both trusts are managed by JO
Hambro.
Govett American Smaller Companies has a discount of 17% and
specialises in those with niche situations in growing markets. Currently
it is more than a third invested in technology and telecom stocks. F&amp;C
Smaller Companies trust, meanwhile, is run ''using a value style with an
emphasis on minimising the downside risk in each holding''. This has
meant it has avoided such areas as technology but has managed to
out-perform its benchmark index. It has a package discount of 7.1%
having been at a premium much of the time since its launch in March
1993. At 37p its warrant is seen as '' very cheap''.
The US Smaller Companies Trust also has a ''cheap'' warrant at 69p.
The trust has generally traded at a package premium but is currently at
a 9.1% discount. Management is carried out by Boston-based Wellington
Management, which focuses on quality growth companies capitalised at
under at $2000m.
American Trust, in the Edinburgh Fund Managers stable, has a
concentrated portfolio of large and middle-sized companies with no
technology stocks, which it believes are over-valued.
Fleming American, with its moderately defensive stance, ''should fare
comparatively well if the market is flat or falling'' but will
''probably out-perform in a rising market''.
For what it is worth, most UK managers (who have been wrong so far)
believe a ''correction'' is due for Wall Street ''in the near future''.

SCOTLAND'S independent school sector gave itself a pat on the back
yesterday, after turning in another batch of high pass rates in this
year's Higher, Certificate of Sixth Year Studies, and A-level
examinations.
Mrs Judith Sischy, director of the Scottish Council of Independent
Schools, said the results reflected the hard work and commitment of
pupils and staff in private secondaries, where annual fees can be
between #1840 and #7875 for day pupils, and from #7782 to #11,730 for
boarders.
Most fifth year pupils sat four or more Highers, and the average pass
rate was 85%. More than a third achieved A bands. Independent schools
educate 4% of Scotland's pupils.
Mrs Sischy said: ''In many cases there will be success stories far
above the average.''
But the council and heads cautioned against reading too much into the
raw results, while one of Scotland's leading educational researchers, Dr
Brian Boyd, warned that they made no contribution to the key debate
about measuring the value schools add to pupils and their achievement.
Dr Boyd, associate director of the Quality in Education Centre at
Strathclyde University, Glasgow, said: ''It is very difficult to know
from these results whether a school is making a significant impact, or
doing better or worse than you would expect it to.''
Mrs Sischy, however, said: ''I would maintain we do work very hard on
the intake, and probably would score very highly on value added. What we
do best is not just stretching the most able. We also stretch the middle
ability range. That is what value added is about.
''Although it does not show in the tables, the high level of success
we achieve implies that we do provide added value.''
The High School of Glasgow and Hutchesons' Grammar in the city, said
to be the two Scottish independent schools with the most demanding
selection procedures, had the highest average of A passes at Higher in
fifth year.
Mr Brian Lockhart, acting rector of Glasgow High, said: ''Our 94% pass
rate in fifth year is about the same as we have achieved in recent
years. Consistently good results and the number of A passes confirm that
we are providing quality.
''It is our policy to present all pupils in fifth year for Highers,
and that means these results are a true reflection of the school.''
Another school which did particularly well in the number of As
achieved in fifth year, St George's School for Girls in Edinburgh, is
finding that Scottish courses and qualifications are growing in
popularity over English GCSE exams.
St George's head, Dr Judith McClure, said: ''We have about 80% of our
students now doing Highers because they very much like the range you can
get from them. The problem with A Levels is that they are two-year
courses and are quite narrowly-based.''
As in the state sector, there are fewer single-sex schools in the
private sector, but Dr McClure described St George's as ''flourishing
and full''. She said: ''In girls' schools you gather together a lot of
well-motivated girls, the whole school is devoted to them, and they are
likely to do better, as our results confirm.''
Mr Keith Pearson, head of George Heriot's, in Edinburgh, said the
school's results would probably not be as strong as last year's, but he
added: ''Equally, I think they will be pleasing over the piece.''
Mrs Sischy said: ''The tables do not tell you how to make comparisons
with other schools. Exam results are a pointer. They do not tell you
about the raw material coming into the school, or the school itself.''
Dr Boyd said: ''Independent schools have favourable staff pupil
ratios, 30% to 40% higher than mainstream state schools. You would be
hard put not to get very good results in these circumstances.
''There are certain things independent schools do very well. They have
an ethos of achievement, and the best of these schools are very good at
promoting it. But when you focus on exam results you need to be wary
about whether schools are being selective internally, with youngsters
who do not keep up being discarded. That would be very negative.''

THE strength of the yen has undermined the performance Ballie Gifford
Shin Nippon, the #38m investment trust which specialises in smaller
Japanese companies.
In the six months to July 31, the trust's net asset value per share
fell by 10.6% to 132.6p. The second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
where the shares of smaller companies are traded, lost 13.2% of its
value in local terms, but after adjustment for sterling's decline
against the yen the fall was limited to 3.2%.
Over the last two years Shin Nippon has been hedging about half of its
portfolio against yen weakness by forward sales of yen. Initially this
produced a small profit, but in the latest six months it was the main
factor in the trust's underperformance against the sterling-adjusted
second section index.
The Tokyo stock market has been under a cloud as the strength of the
yen has slowed down the long awaited recovery in the economy after
Japan's worst recession since the Second World War.
The stocks in which Shin Nippon invests have been especially
vulnerable since smaller companies are mainly dependent on the
performance of the domestic economy and the section section of the Tokyo
market has underperformed the first.
Mr George Veitch, who manages the fund, is more optimistic now. Since
the end of July the yen has weakened significantly on the back of
concerted action to boost the dollar by leading central banks. This has
enhanced the prospects for the Japanese economy and its corporate
sector, in Baillie Gifford's view.
Since the end of July net asset value has made up sume lost ground
with a rise of 3.2%. Shin Nippon hopes to exploit this with the use of
gearing. Around 9% of shareholers' funds have been borrowed.
The loss per shares fell from 0.5p to 0.07p. Once again there is no
interim dividend.

EXAM results are by no means the only factor which identifies the
quality of a school. However, fifth-year Higher passes at band A are
often taken as a benchmark.
On that basis, Hutchesons' Grammar School in Glasgow, with 207 pupils
gaining 607 band A passes, has surpassed all other schools in the
independent sector.
''This is better than we have ever done,'' said headmaster David Ward.
''In the past, our most able pupils have achieved highly but we have
been working to ensure that those not quite so able do not undervalue
themselves.
''For that reason, our Standard Grade results are also outstanding.
Our pupils are focused on performing well in a competitive world -- we
have made them aware of the value of good qualifications and of the need
not to accept second best.''
The school accepts pupils, after written tests and interviews, into
primaries 1 and 5 and the first year of secondary school, when around
100 are admitted.
Its popularity is such that tests can be pitched at a demanding level.
This stiff entry requirement brings its own reward in pupil commitment.
''Exam results are an important element of preparation for life,''
said David Ward, ''but they won't get you into places on their own
nowadays. All young people, especially the less gifted, must bring other
qualities as well.''

ONE of the country's best-known firms of architects, SBT Keppie, has
been bought over by its Glasgow-based directors, to bring the
prestigious practice back into Scottish ownership.
Dating back to 1854, famous names such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh,
John Honeyman and John Keppie, have all been associated with the firm.
Following the successful merger with Guildford-based Scott Brownrigg
and Turner six years ago, the formerly-named Keppie Henderson will now
be known as Keppie Design Limited, after the buy-out by Scots directors
Peter Scott, David Stark, David Collin and Peter Sassoon.
The practice was established by John Honeyman, famous for his
ecclesiastical work, in the mid-19th century. By 1872, he had designed
the city's Ca d'oro building in Gordon Street. In 1889, John Keppie
became a partner.
But it was in 1902 that the firm's association with Mackintosh began
and in the years to follow, output was dominated by his major projects
including the Glasgow School of Art, the Glasgow Herald building,
Martyrs Public School, St Cuthbert's and Queens Cross Church, Scotland
Street Public School, Hill House in Helensburgh, and The Willow Tea
Rooms.
There are few towns in Scotland that do not have an important building
designed by the partnership. In Glasgow alone, 14 of the 84 properties
to feature in the Doors Open Day next month are attributable to the
Keppie stable.
The new company, based from converted church premises at 160 West
Regent Street, has appointed Peter Scott as chairman.
Confirming the development yesterday, he said: ''The directors of the
new firm regard themselves as custodians of a legacy which encompasses a
huge range of talent and experience, and believe that the diversity of
their skills, interests and personalities is one of their great
assets.''
With a current workload in Glasgow and Edinburgh which ranges from new
hospitals, offices, retail, educational and industrial buildings to
restoration, conservation and interior design projects, the breadth of
the firm's base is significant.
The directors have between them considerable experience overseas as is
reflected in the presence of Harare, Dublin, and Johannesburg on the new
letterhead.

THE continuing procession of building societies towards a stock-market
listing gives the remaining mutual societies a unique opportunity to
challenge the major players, Skipton Building Society's chief executive
claims.
John Goodfellow, a Glaswegian, believes the pressure on the massive
Halifax/Leeds operation and Abbey National to produce profits gives the
smaller players the opportunity to undercut their interest rate margins.
Abbey, which already has a stock-market listing, must service hefty
dividend payouts. The enlarged Halifax, which will float by 1997, will
soon have to do the same.
However, there is no such pressure on the mutuals and Mr Goodfellow
sees no rationale for an interest rate margin as wide as the current
2.3%.
He believes the gap between the interest rate paid to savers and that
charged to borrowers could easily be cut to 1.25%, thus reducing
homeowners' mortgage payments.
Mr Goodfellow said: ''The strategy (of mutuals) should be
customer-first and therefore we shouldn't be making margins that we
don't particularly need.
''It (borrowing) should be cheaper in mutuals than it is in plcs
because we don't have that dividend pressure but that is not happening
at the moment.''
If mutuals were to unite in the move towards lower margins, they could
put pressure on their publicly-quoted counterparts.
The mutual sector has recently seen the departure of Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, which has been taken over by ''big four'' bank Lloyds.
National &amp; Provincial, which is being acquired by Abbey, will soon
relinquish its mutual status.
Major mutual players Alliance &amp; Leicester, Nationwide, and Woolwich
could be considered ripe for a move to plc status, with Northern Rock
and Birmingham Midshires cited by industry insiders as the other
possible candidates for a switch.
Mr Goodfellow, who was visiting Skipton's recently-opened Glasgow
branch yesterday, would also like to see an end to heavily-discounted
mortgages for new customers.
He would prefer homeowners to take a longer-term, rather than a
short-term view, so existing borrowers do not end up subsidising new
customers' mortgages.
Obviously, a unilateral move away from short-term discounts on new
mortgages would be suicidal in terms of new business.
Mr Goodfellow said: ''The market pragmatism is that I can't stop
discounting straight away because I won't get any new business.''
However, he believes mutuals should be working for the benefit of all
their customers, rather than for a small number of new borrowers.
Skipton, the UK's 14th-largest building society, is understood to have
had tentative bid approaches from banks and others.
Mr Goodfellow, while supporting the fight for mutuality, admits a
society could ''never say never'' if a bidder was to come up with a
''crazy price''.
His North Yorkshire-based society, which was recently praised by Prime
Minister John Major in the House of Commons for being the first to offer
free unemployment cover in response to the Government's decision to
reduce income support for mortgage interest payments, is looking to open
branches in Aberdeen and Tayside.
It currently has a presence in Edinburgh, North Berwick, Perth, and
Glasgow.

ASK abroad what sums up Scotland and you might get the answer: tartan,
heather, Loch Lomond or perhaps even Sir Harry Lauder, still fondly
remembered 45 years after his death. Sir Harry's story is soon to be
heard on Radio 2 in a celebration of his life in words and song, Roamin'
in the Gloamin'.
The programme's Edinburgh-based producer, Mike Shaw, explains: ''Like
most of my generation in Scotland I am aware of the intellectual
ambivalence to the so called 'Lauder legacy'.
''People will admit that some of the songs are immortal -- my
11-year-old knows the words already -- but what about that Brigadoon
stick and heather image? That's an argument that has run many times
before, and will doubtless run again. My interest developed from another
source, my contact with American broadcasters.''
This interest sparked off a letter published in newspapers all over
Scotland to elicit stories about Sir Harry that would build up a fuller
picture. The response was phenomenal. The Sir Harry Lauder grapevine was
in full flow and letters arrived from all parts of Scotland, England and
even abroad.
Sir Harry's story is itself a remarkable one, a real-life rags to
riches epic.
Harry Lauder was born in Portobello; the family moved to Musselburgh
then to England, where his father died at the age of 32. Harry was 11 at
this time and the family then came back to Arbroath to be near his
mother's people. Let others take up the tale:
Archie Foley (Sir Harry Lauder Society)
HIS mother moved the family up to Arbroath in 1881-1882 and Harry
became a part-timer in a flax mill. He would work one day and go to
school the next. He worked a 12-hour day for two shillings a week and as
the oldest in the family they needed his contributions.
Early in his career he did a tour with McKenzie Murdock round
Scotland. He thought he was going to make a lot of money but in fact
they each lost #100 and for the following tour they doubled their
budget; I think he learned you have to make your self known.
He went down to London in 1900 to take the big step.He's a good
example of overnight success which he prepared for about 10-15 years.
The initial success came not doing the Scottish material for which he
is remembered now, but doing Irish stuff. He thought at first he
couldn't get by doing Scottish material in England and only when called
for an encore and had run out of Irish jokes and songs did he turn to
Scottish material.
Greta Fraser (Sir Harry's great-niece)
HE was in lots of ways a humble man, but not as regards his work. He
knew his own value, he knew he was good but as an ordinary man sitting
at the fireplace he was a quiet, modest and God-fearing man. He lived by
the principle if you can't say good, say nothing.
Betty Lauder Hamilton (great-niece)
THERE was no television and no radio all over America that joined the
States together. Uncle Harry had to have a gimmick . . . he was a very
clever man. He told me as a child: ''People remember you if you are mean
and they talk about you''.
So he set up this idea of himself being mean. Also he publicised
himself. Aunt Greta said she would be sitting in a hotel lounge and she
would hear him being paged. Of course, in those days they walked round
with a placard with your name on it and she would say: ''You're not
answering Harry, why?'' He would say: ''I paid him to do that and I've
paid them in six or seven other hotels, so people will say 'Who is that
Harry Lauder?' ''
Bill Henderson (met Sir Harry as a child)
MY father was a game keeper and asked me to carry Sir Harry Lauder's
cartridge bag. Anyway, I carried Sir Harry's bag all day and at night we
had to hand them back. The normal thing was when you handed the bag back
you got a tip from the owner, which used to be half a crown . . . my tip
was ''Thanks very much laddie'' . . . and that was it!''
Joe O'Brien (saw Sir Harry as a child)
HARRY Lauder was supposed to be coming to open the YMCA, which is
quite close to where I live in Blantyre, so we all hung around until the
motor turned up. It was a big black motor like a limousine you might
say. There weren't many motors going round like that in those days . . .
in fact there weren't many motors at all.
When he tried to get out they were all grabbing him and trying to pull
at him. He was getting frustrated . . . but you know what you were like
when you were kids, you just didn't think about those things. Then he
says: ''If you all stand against that wall I'll give you all a penny''.
So we stood against the wall and he just flew out the door and jumped in
to the YMCA and that was the end of that. We never saw him again from
that day to this.
AT home too Lauder was a star and was on friendly terms with royalty
of the day.
Gordon Irving (journalist)
THE Prince of Wales who was later to become the Duke of Windsor came
to the Hippodrome Theatre in London. Harry stopped in the middle of his
patter and looked straight at the royal box and fixed his eye on the
Prince, who was an eligible bachelor at that time. He said, looking up
at the royal box: ''I'm telling you sir, a bonny Scots lassie is the
finest thing a man can find on this earth . . . a man might dae worse.''
Then Harry asked for requests and the prince called out: ''Give us I
Love a Lassie''. Harry looked right up at the prince and said: ''I know
you do sir, but who is she?'' and that was with his famous chuckle . . .
everyone collapsed with laughter.
SIR HARRY was also friend to many stars and they regularly visited his
house Lauder Hall in Strathaven. His great-niece, Betty Lauder Hamilton
has particular memories about a parrot the family had for years and a
visit by Irving Berlin.
Betty Lauder Hamilton
THEY went upstairs to chat and Aunt Greta gave me semolina to give to
the bird. Here was Irving Berlin who couldn't sing, singing, and Uncle
Harry was playing the piano badly because he just worked with one finger
when he was composing. The duet was horrendous . . . the parrot gave
them the biggest raspberry I've ever heard.
Gordon Irving
HE built his mansion on the moors at Strathaven outside Glasgow and
enjoyed his retirement.
When the stars came to Glasgow I met most of them. He would say to
invite them out and I would have the job of bringing them out in his
later days. I've taken people like Bruce Forsyth and Morecambe and Wise
but his great friends were well known -- Bob Hope, Laurel and Hardy and
many others. They wanted to meet the man in his own surroundings.
One of them was Danny Kaye. Danny wanted to play Harry in a movie. His
problem was he was too tall and no-one had the money to make a Lauder
film.
Betty Lauder Hamilton
DANNY Kaye definitely sticks out in my memory because he wanted to
play Uncle Harry in a film. He came the first time to the house.
Uncle Harry had gone to see him at the Empire and thought he was
wonderful because he was completely different, he sat on the side of the
stage talking to the audience. Aunt Greta phoned me in Aberdeen and
said, come back from your holiday early and meet him, he's wonderful.
Uncle Harry died quite soon after that and Danny came with his wife to
visit this time. Sometimes you get cynical about playing up to big stars
. . . but when I met him I thought he was really sincere because he said
to Aunt Greta: ''Can I go into Harry's room?'' and he spent a bit of
time in the room Harry died in . . . he was quite different to some of
the people that came.
Betty Lauder Hamilton
I HAVE a book which is full of people he helped. It tells you all the
people who asked him for money, help of some kind or concert. He never
stopped giving, he didn't give to just one thing: the Erskine Hospital,
Caledonia School, Salvation Army, Relief to the Destitute and Sick, The
Royal Society for the Blind . . ..
Jimmy Black (A fan of Sir Harry who corresponded with the star when he
was a boy)
LAUDER was a wonderful performer. He had a wonderful voice, he was a
funny man, his timing was brilliant. He had such a stage presence and it
was wonderful to sit in an audience and anticipate Lauder coming on. You
could feel the change in the atmosphere when he took the stage.
ROAMIN' in the Gloamin' brings together the stories and the music of
Sir Harry Lauder and will be presented by Jimmy Logan, who has himself
played Lauder on the stage. ''The programme is self-consciously a
celebration of Sir Harry's life,'' enthuses Mike Shaw.
''It is clear the overwhelming majority of people who saw him
worshipped him. He was an outstanding showman, but lovable? To a family
yes. To others? I'm not sure what anyone else has the right to expect.
''He came through as single-minded, generous (he donated heavily to
charity), quiet (after all he lost his only son in the First World War
and his wife died not long afterwards) but acutely aware of his own
worth.''
When Mike Shaw initially started researching Sir Harry he was a bit
sceptical about the authenticity of his international success. ''He was
a genuinely successful international artist, making 22 world tours. He
was also reputed to be a megastar in the USA, the Beatles of his time,
without any of the modern hype to help him along.
''But I also wondered if this was post-Lauder mythology. What came
through in my researches was that he had been every bit as successful as
was claimed.''
Shaws confirms that in his day Sir Harry was an incredible self
publicist: ''He invented marketing light years ahead of Branson and the
modern crop . . . he worked hard to make sure people talked about and
remembered him and meanness was a great tool. And it must have worked as
it is still remembered today.''

<HEADLINE>Bridge to Bute 'only way to combat high ferry fares'</HEADLINE>

A BRIDGE linking Bute with the mainland may be the only answer to
combat high ferry fares and a lack of late-night services, a Government
sponsored survey has revealed.
The survey, carried out by Argyll and the Islands Enterprise, is
critical of the island's ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne for failing
to provide a competitive service and leaving islanders stranded during
the winter after its early evening crossing.
Business groups are preparing to stage a public meeting to tell CalMac
to reappraise its service or risk hastening the demise of Bute's
economy.
Most Bute residents want to keep their special island status but 55%
of the 3000 who responded to the Lec survey said they would welcome a
permanent road link to span the Kyles of Bute to Colintraive on the
Cowal peninsula rather than continue facing high fares.
The third of a mile crossing between Rhubodaich on Bute and
Colintraive is one of the most costly ferry crossings by distance in
Europe at 70p per person and #5.20 for a car.
Travellers have also complained about charges for the half-hour
crossing across the Clyde from Rothesay to Wemyss Bay.
CalMac charges #2.55 per person and #9.10 for a car of less than four
metres long for this monopoly route, which is significantly higher than
the #2.10 per person and #5.70 for any car using its crossing between
Dunoon and Gourock, where it faces competition from Western Ferries.
The survey, which was commissioned by the Bute Transport Users Group,
showed that 71% of islanders wished to see a fast ferry/transport link
to Glasgow with 85% calling for reduced total travel time between the
island and the city.
On existing sailings, 24% welcomed the increased summer timetable but
wanted these extended to winter services. Other improvements requested
were late-night sailings, especially at weekends, special visitors
tickets, driver's fare included in the car price, and secure parking for
vehicles at terminals.
Further demands included the charging of cars at a single rate instead
of by length, less disparity of charges between the Rothesay and Dunoon
routes, a better range of concessionary and reduced fares, and
improvements to CalMac staff attitudes.
Dunoon-based Database Direct (Scotland) Research Division, authors of
the survey, claimed the views of the islanders were compounded by the
fact that in the absence of competition CalMac decisions were simplified
to maximise profits or minimise losses.
Mr Jim Lyle, president of Bute Merchants' Association, said: ''This
survey is a damning endictment of its service to this island. A bridge
would seem to many to be the only alternative to the problems we face.''
Mr Ray Dalton, chairman of Bute Transport Users Group, said the survey
was instigated to add weight to a campaign to improve the island's ferry
service.
''It costs an average family in a car #30 to come here, so the effect
on day trippers alone is obvious, while fares are prohibitive to
companies operating on the island,'' he said.
Mr Dalton said a public meeting would be called to decide how to lobby
both the Government and the ferry company.
However, a spokesman for CalMac said the options of a competing
service or a bridge were ''ridiculous'' and defended his company's
pricing policy. He claimed CalMac had never received complaints about
staff attitude.
He said options of 10 journey tickets which offer up to a #7.20 saving
on the normal single fares on the Wemyss Bay service and short break
returns of #3.70 proved the company was committed to providing
concessions.

BOBBY Murdoch, one of the Lisbon Lions who helped Celtic lift the
European Cup in 1967, has scored another historic victory by winning his
off-field battle to prove that an ankle injury he suffered in 1962 was
an industrial accident.
The decision by the Medical Appeal Tribunal, which has immense
ramifications for football, means Mr Murdoch can now sue his former
employers, Celtic, for compensation. It also opens the floodgates for
countless other injured footballers whose careers have been similarly
blighted to seek financial redress from their former clubs.
The way is also intriguingly paved for players such as Paul Elliott,
another former Celtic player, who lost a high-profile damages action
against Dean Saunders in the High Court in London for an injury that
ended his career, to take a different road for compensation.
For Mr Murdoch, the decision means he will receive thousands of pounds
in payments from the Department of Social Security which will be
backdated for 33 years.
Mr Murdoch said yesterday at his home in Rutherglen: ''I'm delighted
to have won. I now intend to raise an action against Celtic Football
Club and their insurers.
''I still love the club and have no wish to harm them but they were my
employers and their insurance company must be held liable. It might also
help other footballers.''
The injury on which Mr Murdoch based his case followed an accidental
clash with Hearts goalkeeper Gordon Marshall, the father of the current
Celtic keeper. Mr Murdoch was taken off on a stretcher and was out for
three weeks with torn ligaments. After the injury, he said he had
''missed a hell of a lot of games''.
He left Celtic in 1973 to join Middlesbrough as a player-coach, where
he stayed for nine years. He has not worked since then because of the
effects of the ankle injury, which he said philosophically was ''just
one of those things''.
Mr Murdoch was helped to fight his case by Mr Peter Mullen, who runs
Glencoats Training and Advisory Service in Paisley.
Mr Mullen, who became involved after hearing of Mr Murdoch's plight
when sharing a table with him at a boxing match, said: ''This is a major
breakthrough. Mr Murdoch has won back payment from the DSS but more
importantly the green light for a much bigger claim against the
insurers.
''This will open the floodgates for hundreds of footballers who have
received injuries.''
Mr Mullen said he would now be championing the case of another former
Celtic player, John McCluskey, who had been injured playing a European
tie for the Parkhead club.
Mr Mullen said: ''The incident happened in 1976 when John was 17. Not
long after the incident, he was given a #2000 pay-off and he hasn't
worked since. His case is now in the hands of the DSS.''
Mr Murdoch's lawyer, Mr Terence Ruddy, of Peter McCann &amp; Co
Solicitors, of Glasgow, said: ''We are delighted with the result. This
is a historic victory and means we can go ahead with our claim against
Celtic's insurers, as it has been proved it was an industrial injury.
''This is the first of its kind and will open up a new chapter of
claims. We do have other people involved but we cannot disclose their
names without their permission.''
Mr Ruddy said the DSS had not arrived at a final assessment about the
money due to Mr Murdoch. ''Even if it had, we could not disclose the
amount,'' he said.
Mr Ruddy's feelings about the victory were echoed by Tony Higgins,
secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association, which
Bobby Murdoch helped found.
He said: ''We too are delighted. This decision means a lot of
footballers in similar circumstances will be able to pursue claims.
''A hell of a lot of ex-players like Bobby Murdoch can relate back to
a specific injury after which they were never quite the same.''
Mr Higgins added that it was his ''guestimate'' that at least five
players retire each season because of a specific injury.
Celtic declined to comment. However, it is believed that they
understand Mr Murdoch's position. Mr Murdoch is still a popular figure
at the club and was a guest at the recent friendly against Newcastle
United.

THE rival Scottish nurses' union, set up eight weeks ago, has
recruited 500 members and yesterday appointed a former Royal College of
Nursing board member as an honorary figurehead.
Miss Elizabeth McLaren, OBE, trained as a nurse in the 1940s and held
the post of RCN board secretary for 25 years. She said she thought
Scotland's 30,000 nurses faced a tougher time now than ever before and
needed to be represented by a wholly Scottish union, the Independent
Federation of Nursing in Scotland.
Speaking in Glasgow, she said she had spent most of her career as a
general nurse in the city's Victoria Hospital, retiring in 1988.
She added that, although in her day she worked a 72-hour week, nurses
were now under enormous stress and strain.
She said she was impressed with the aims and attitude of the IFNS and
believed it had been a courageous step for new members to break away
from the RCN and Unison.
The new union offers a low subscription rate but has not been
recognised by the majority of health care trusts.

IT was sheer devilment that prompted me. An encounter with one of the
doyens of Scottish nationalism had led to reflections on the
Enlightenment and suchlike manifestations of North British civilisation.
But had my companion ever listened to Nightline on Scot FM?
If you, too, haven't a Scottie McClue what I'm talking about then
you're not one of the nightly audience of some 364,000 (many of them
surely serial addicts) to the live chat programme. The bunneted,
mittened one who lurks under the moniker of Scottie must be feeling the
heat these days but the patter is as trenchant as ever.
His debating proposition on Tuesday was the discouragement of thieving
by chopping miscreants' hands off. A Swiftian solution that did not
rouse his callers, who seemed more concerned with his earlier
castigation of fatties on the beach. A favourite topic for Scottie is
feckless single mothers, about whom he talks with a singular lack of
finesse. On the other hand he responded sympathetically to a responsible
single parent, trying to raise her child on a nightmare housing estate.
Another caller, fearing her house would be burnt down if she stood as
a court witness, was reminded of her duty as a citizen. An underworld of
deprivation, gallus humour, and odd-ballery is revealed in Nightline.
It's an antidote to middle-class complacency -- and intermittently
funny, occasionally moving. It may even be, help ma boab, the authentic
voice of contemporary Scotland.
Gourock scultor extraordinaire George Wyllie is himself no mean hewer
of words. The straw-engine, paper-boat man was in good form as he
wandered through the centre of Glasgow for Radio Scotland's Cityscape.
His starting point was Central Station.
He extolled that railway-age temple, the Finnieston crane, and Clyde
bridges -- ''all this strong, structural, engineering energy!'' -- and
was equally at ease chatting up a hawker at the Barrows and seeking a
traditional teashop. No mention, though, of those old dispensers of
afternoon tea and art, Craig's tearooms. And surely cakes crowned the
top tier, not the bottom, of the Glasgow cake stand. Still, an
affectionate picture in sound and one that avoided facile nostalgia.
THE Loch Ness Monster has been overtaken by the Festival Monster as a
subject to occupy southern media persons in slack summertime. Even that
quintessential Londoner Derek Jameson got in on the Edinburgh act this
week with his wife on Radio 2. His blustering amiability does nothing
for this North Brit but he does represent ordinary mainstream values,
gave a plug for Jimmy Logan, and the names of youthful jazz musicians to
please their mums.
Tuning in to the two previous programmes on Radio 2 that evening, one
might have thought oneself missing a digit. The Sexton's Tale and The
Year of the Bonnie Prince could both have sat happily on Radio 3
(compliment or condemnation, depending on one's viewpoint). The former
concerned the exhumation of Elizabeth Siddal -- inspirer of
pre-Raphaelite art and lust -- to retrieve poems tucked into her hair by
Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The grand romantic gesture turned ghoulish. It
would have salved curiosity to hear something of the salvaged verse. The
moral is, as with journalism, always to keep blacks.
The Year of the Bonnie Prince was a gem of a programme, encapsuling
the story of the '45 uprising in an hour. Donald Campbell's script, with
its three main characters -- the Prince himself, a Jacobite, and a
Hanoverian -- was taut and ironic. But it was the melding of this with
songs of the period that gave it its impact. Little vignettes -- of the
prince surrounded by admiring women in Edinburgh after Prestonpans, or
as barefooted fugitive with dirty shirt and long red beard (the Stewart
heritage?) -- will remain in the mind. And, ah, those songs, from the
rumbustious Johnny Cope to the elegiac Wae Is Me for Charlie. The
musical efflorescence that followed the '45 was an extraordinary
phenomenon. Beauty from tragedy, with a vengeance.

* STATUS is a state of mind but in Hollywood your account is measured
in dollars and cents. Make that millions of dollars and lots of change.
Now, the town that shot itself where it really hurts -- the corporate
wallet -- is in a panic over star salaries. It's like a Monopoly game
run amok.
This summer the salary till jingled like this: Jim Carrey was paid
$20m by Columbia Pictures to star in Cable Guy; Universal then followed
up with another $20m for him to make Liar, Liar.
Sylvester Stallone, who must have brass implants in his thick neck,
has signed a three-picture deal from Savoy Pictures.
And Columbia Pictures have just signed a two-film deal worth #10m to
Alicia Silverstone. Alicia who? She 18 years old and stars in the teen
comedy Clueless, which is at present an enormous success in America.
''When I heard that she was getting $5m a picture, I thought 'this is
crazy','' said one studio executive asking the questions everyone is
wondering about.
''What does that mean Meg Ryan gets for her next film?''
He should not get stressed. Sources at Columbia insist that the deal
will only bring the teenager $8m for the two films. It is, of course,
all absurd and out of proportion.
Hollywood has watched with a mixture of fascination and dread as the
huge fees paid to A-list actors have climbed into double figures. There
are now serious concerns.
The megabuck salaries are being driven by a combination of forces
ranging from the booming international market in American films and the
simple reason that only a handful of actors can swell the box office on
their names alone. But if Stallone gets $20m a pop and Jim Carrey, a
comparative newcomer to the A-list following The Mask, Ace Ventura, and
most recently Batman Forever, gets the same it sets a standard against
which all other salaries are judged.
What do you pay Tom Cruise? Or Michael Douglas? Columbia chairman Mark
Canton made the Carrey deal. And also the arrangement with Alicia
Silverstone. ''He's ruining the business,'' said a rival studio boss,
adding; ''It's so irresponsible. The Silverstone deal was the nail in
the coffin.''
Cynics might suggest his displeasure was more with losing out on
Carrey and Silverstone than on the business science of the pacts. Canton
is unrepentant: ''We do not do business here by throwing things against
the wall. Silverstone will star in Excess Baggage which will cost in the
$16m range to make. Clueless is going to do $60m in business. If I can
make the next Alicia Silverstone movie for $16m, I'm doing my
business.''
Columbia strongly defends its Silverstone agreement, and especially
executive Barry Josephson who was in charge of it: ''We saw she had
great comedic talent. Everyone here was highly impressed with what she
did and we think she has a great future.
''She has a young audience, which is great because they go to a lot of
movies.''
There, of course, is the clue. The youth market is the core of the
film industry today. No studio wants to lose out on a potential teenaged
superstar.''
The thinking now is that if you have an A-list star it will cost at
least $70m to make a film. That is if she or he sits in a room and
talks. Add some action and cost goes immediately to more than $100m.

THREE members of a gang who tortured and raped a schoolgirl as a
revenge punishment after she had stolen a purse were described as
barbaric at the Old Bailey yesterday.
The Common Serjeant of London, Judge Neil Denison, told them: ''You in
effect sought revenge and took the law into your own hands and subjected
that young woman to a day of torture, for that is what it was --
torture, sexual violence, degradation, and humiliation. Your conduct can
only be described as barbaric.''
He sentenced the youngest, Nicola Wilson, 17, to three and a half
years' detention, describing her as the ringleader. Johnny Wilson (no
relation), 19, was sentenced to three years' detention and Stephen
Dixon, 21, was jailed for three years.
Only the fourth member of the gang, 21-year-old Nicola Planter, who
admitted the attack but took no part in the rape of the victim, escaped
detention. The mother of a four-year-old daughter, she was given a
two-year probation order and 100 hours' community service.
The court heard how the terrified schoolgirl, who is now 17, was
subjected to a catalogue of sadistic violence during her ordeal last
September.
Mr Francis Sheridan, prosecuting, said the gang set out to rubbish and
humiliate her for stealing a purse containing #130 belonging to Johnny
Wilson's mother. They forced their way into her home in Peckham,
south-east London, stripped her, whipped her with a belt, kicked her to
the ground, and made her dance naked between beatings.
She was burned with a cigarette and forced to hold the lit end in her
mouth. She was also ordered to drink one defendant's urine and was
beaten with a bamboo cane.
Mr Sheridan said the two women tried to outdo one another in the
cruelty they could inflict. He said Nicola Wilson was the most vicious.
The majority of the violence was carried out in the hallway of the
block of flats in front of a jeering crowd who laughed at the girl's
plight and her screams of terror.
Later, she was taken to Johnny Wilson's flat, where she was stripped
again, blindfolded, and ordered to lie on the floor where she was
sexually abused by both boys, while Nicola Wilson egged them on and
afterwards subjected the terrified girl to a separate sex attack.
The schoolgirl finally escaped through an unlocked door after she was
ordered to do the washing-up and alerted a neighbour to her ordeal.
Nicola Wilson, of Carlton Grove, Peckham, was convicted of aiding and
abetting rape and indecent assault and admitted during the trial causing
actual bodily harm and forced imprisonment.
Johnny Wilson, of Clifton Crescent, Peckham, and Dixon, of Adams
Avenue, Northampton, were convicted of rape, attempted rape, and forced
imprisonment. Planter, of Bells Garden Estate, Peckham, admitted causing
actual bodily harm.
The gang, described in court as coming from disadvantaged backgrounds
but who had tried to improve their positions in life, had been convicted
earlier this month but were remanded until yesterday for reports.

.
A FRENCHMAN flew to the defence of a suspect batch of Scottish cheese
yesterday.
Mr Jean Jacques Devoyod, 64, was giving evidence at the trial in which
Clydesdale district is seeking an order to destroy #27,000 of Lanark
blue cheese which is allegedly contaminated with listeria.
Tests allegedly revealed 44 batches were highly affected, but Mr
Devoyod told Lanark Sheriff Court that having studied farmer Humphrey
Errington's methods of making Lanark blue, he thought the risks of
listeria contamination were extremely low.
Mr Devoyod, now retired, said the high levels of listeria allegedly
found by Scottish Agricultural College technicians were
''unexplainable''.
Through an interpreter, Mr Devoyod explained he had devoted his life
as a microbiologist to studying raw and pasteurised milk in the
production of cheeses. Until 1993 he had been director of a branch of
France's National Dairy Research Laboratory which he had founded.
His speciality was the investigation into bacteria growth in
farmhouse-made Roquefort blue cheese.
Mr Devoyod said: ''Mr Errington makes his cheese in a very similar way
to that of traditionally-made Roquefort. Three main points in that
manufacture have an undesirable effect on bacteria.
''The raw milk contains antibodies which inhibit bacteria growth for a
time.
''Lactic material in the unpasteurised milk also produces acids which
reduce bacterial growth.
''And salt, the first ever known antiseptic, added to the cheese
inhibits bacteria growth.''
He said listeria would not multiply at 4C or below. The court had
heard Mr Errington, when giving evidence on how his Lanark blue was
made, say his cheese was stored at -2C.
In July, tests on raw milk taken from some of Mr Errington's 440 ewes
at his farm at Dunsyre, Lanarkshire, showed low levels of listeria.
Mr Devoyod said that taking into account the manufacturing processes
he had seen at the farm, he did not accept there could be such a high
growth of the bacteria.
The case continues.

A #71,000-A-YEAR official at the centre of a row over a council post
last night defended his appointment, saying he was the best candidate
for the job.
Mr David McKendrick was appointed social work director for shadow
authority North Lanarkshire, despite being almost 64.
He is due to retire in a year, just five months after the new council
becomes operational.
Mr McKendrick's move from his former post as a social work divisional
manager in Glasgow for Strathclyde region meant a #28,000 pay rise.
However, following the appointment, Mr Ian Gilmour, social work depute
director with Strathclyde region -- who was an unsuccessful applicant
for the new job -- has lodged a formal complaint about the selection
process. He claims a junior member of his staff -- who is a councillor
-- was on the interviewing panel.
Now the union Unison has called for the Scottish Staff Commission to
investigate.
Mr McKendrick said last night: ''I believe the interviews were
conducted fairly and that the best candidate was given the job.
''I assume the interviewing panel acted in the best interests of the
North Lanarkshire Council in making this appointment.''
Mr McKendrick, a former Labour councillor, added: ''I would expect to
retire next year, unless any approach to me is made by the council. But
that is a matter which is entirely up to them.''
Mr Mark Irvine, of Unison, said: ''We have written to the Scottish
Staff Commission over this appointment.
''At the moment, the authority seems to be hiding behind the fact that
guidelines over interviewing panels were issued after this interview.''
North Lanarkshire Council said the selection of Mr McKendrick was
carried out by proper procedures.

ANTI-nuclear campaigners from the Highlands are preparing to travel to
the US to lobby the American Government in a bid to dissuade it from
sending up to 15,000 rods of spent nuclear fuel from around the world to
Dounreay for reprocessing.
The Caithness plant will reprocess the 52 nuclear fuel rods from
Germany, which have been the subject of a court battle in the US, only
if it is awarded contracts for far greater consignments of spent nuclear
fuel -- and there are at least 15,000 rods awaiting shipment.
These are currently stored at research reactors around the world which
are rapidly running out of space.
Speculation grew yesterday that Dounrey was already in advanced
negotiations with the Hahn Meitner Institute in Berlin. This followed a
court action in the US to prevent the German waste going to South
Carolina.
However, the US Government has overruled the state and is seeking the
return of the fuel to America, its place of origin, and has approached
the institute, which is also considering the Dounreay option.
The UK Government has ruled that the plant cannot use the Prototype
Fast Reactor to reprocess such contracts until it has completed its own
programme, at the end of the century.
That means the work would need to be done in its Materials Testing
Reactor, which is well over 30 years old and which has been in care and
mainteance for the past year. The expense of preparing it for
reprocessing work would not be justified for just 52 rods.
The Atomic Energy Authority's spokesman at Dounreay, Mr Ian Shepherd,
told the Herald yesterday: ''We would only take material which we can
reprocess and then return the waste to the country of origin, so we
would need other contracts for the MTR.''
However, Mrs Lorraine Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, said
it was vital that this material did not go to the Highlands for
reprocessing. ''It will be the thin end of the wedge,'' she said.

THE new City of Edinburgh Council has accused the Scottish Office of
not paying enough towards the transitional costs of local government
reorganisation this year.
Labour's finance spokesman Councillor Brian Weddell said yesterday
that a report by the director of finance had identified a #1.8m
shortfall in spending in the shadow year.
The new unitary council estimates total expenditure of #4m on such
areas as members' allowances, information technology, and creating a
corporate identity.
Scottish Office grant for all 29 councils to help pay transitional
costs this year is #36m. Edinburgh gets a total of #2.1m.
Councillor Weddell said it was imperative that if the new councils
were to succeed, their transitional programme was fully funded.
He said the council would pursue the matter through the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities.

In Victorian times, they flocked to the banks of the Kelvin for the
health-giving waters near the Halfpenny Bridge. Could the bubbling fount
flow again? Eileen Goodchild investigates the possibilities.
THE cavalier attitude frequently taken by developers and corporations
towards beauty spots and other places of interest and importance to
ordinary people has sadly resulted in the disappearance of a once
much-loved wishing well, a favourite rendezvous for Victorian
Sunday-afternoon promenaders. A couple of verses from the popular Ballad
of Kelvingrove set the scene:-
Let us wander by the mill
Bonnie Lassie O.
To the cave beneath the rill,
Bonnie Lassie O.
Where the glens rebound the call
Of the roaring water's fall
Thro' the mountain's rocky hall,
Bonnie Lassie O.
O Kelvin banks are fair
Bonnie Lassie O,
When in summer we are there
Bonnie Lassie O.
Where the May-pink's crimson plume
Throws a soft but sweet perfume
Round the yellow banks of broom
Bonnie Lassie O.
Thomas Lyle c1820
A couple of years ago the Corries made a recording of it, but very few
of their fans know that it describes an actual spring at Kirklee, close
to the Kelvin, just off Ford Road and only about 10 yards from the
entrance to the ''Halfpenny'' Bridge which was washed away by recent
floods.
The spring was part of the estate of Kelvinside. The house stood on
the Maryhill side of the river (where Botanic Crescent is today). The
estate's policies included the woodlands on both sides of the river and
the river banks as far as Belmont. A right-of-way crossed the estate. It
ran more or less alongside the river from North Woodlands, passing the
two mills, the Woodside Mill and the Garrioch Mill which stood just
below Kelvinside House. It crossed the river by the ford which is just
below Kirklee Bridge, and proceded via Bellshaugh and Balgray Hill to
Dawsholm. From there it continued on to Aberfoyle and Drymen.
Drovers used it, mule trains carrying sacks of grain and meal used it,
the locals used it, and so did courting couples, who, said one
eye-witness, an octogenarian writing to the Evening Citizen in 1932,
went there to drink the water. Rob Roy travelled along it, led his
cattle across the ford and knew the spring. Access was always open and a
laird of Kelvinside, a Dr Thomas Latham (who died in 1807), paid to have
a rustic wooden bridge supported on stone pillars slung across the river
so that visitors could reach the spring without paddling. The Halfpenny
Bridge which replaced it utilised the same pillars.
The spring, hidden in a dark cavity overhung with trees, appealed
strongly to the Romantic mood of the age. The bank which towered above
the river was split by a deep fissure. A spring, heavily laced with
iron, gushed from the rock at the back of the fissure and was collected
in a smooth hollow or well at the bottom. This is the scene that the
water colourist Thomas Fairbairn painted when he set up his easel by the
spring in 1846. Fairbairn also wrote a description of the spring and
explained that the spring and the well were shaped by three trees, a
plane and two ash trees. And so he called it ''The Three Trees Well''.
Later, someone changed the caption on the painting so that it read ''The
Pear Tree Well'' thus confusing a group of trees with a famous pear tree
that belonged to the Glasgow Bakers. And that was a pity because the
pear tree was the object of a quaint custom which should not be
forgotten either.
The people in the painting, there are half-a-dozen of them, are
enjoying their outing. In the distance, two wander down the bank. Two
ladies sit by the fissure, and a quick-witted urchin, a small girl,
sells a can of water to a male visitor. In a lithographer's copy, the
child is shown deep inside the fissure handing up the can of water.
A series of letters appeared 60 or more years ago in the Evening
Citizen, discussing this spring. Old George Sutherland from Hillhead
said that when he was a youngster in 1859/60 the spring was a popular
resort for Glaswegians. On Sunday afternoons it acted like a magnet. The
local kids, with their eye on the main chance (he, of course, was one of
them) filled cans with its magic, cure-all dream water and sold this
liquid to the visitors, charging a penny (or more often a halfpenny) for
a quick swig out of the ''tinny''!
Fairbairn also painted Latham's rustic bridge and the cottage
(somewhat derelict in appearance) that stood close by. A later artist,
David Small, explained that at one time the cottager sold ''mild''
refrshments to the visitors.
The spring had its dark side. Superstitious people threw money into
the pool and the local lads fought furiously for the loot after the
visitors had left. The practice of throwing money in continued after the
spring was lost, only people tossed the money into the river from the
Halfpenny Bridge, so I have been told by someone who did so as a child.
At a date unspecified, an exceedingly unpleasant murder occurred near
the spring. The victim, a young, heavily pregnant woman was never
identified. She seems to have been butchered and for some time
afterwards the place was referred to as the ''Khyber Pass''.
When, around 1895/6, the railway was built through Kirklee and the
Botanic Gardens the fissure was filled in and the spring conduited, to
the great regret of the people who knew it. In 1896 a Mr Fleming
organised a protest group who pleaded for the site to be preserved. They
were ignored, largely because the water was badly polluted. The
correspondents of the Evening Citizen all regretted its disappearance
and felt strongly that at least the site should have a memorial.
Its location is now a mystery. The maps that show it are unreliable
and lack detail. The people who knew it all agreed that it stood below
Kirklee Station, it was about 10 yards from the entrance to the
Halfpenny Bridge, just off Ford Road by the back entrance to the Botanic
Gardens on land that the Gardens had recently acquired. A conduit pipe,
they said, was inserted into the railway embankment wall. Since then the
railway bridge which carried the tracks across Ford Road to the tunnel
entrance in the Gardens has been dismantled and much of the wall has
disappeared.
Is it dry or is the water that can be heard running at the bottom of a
mysterious shaft or ''stank'' at the rear entrance of the Botanic
Gardens, quite close to the entrance of the collapsed bridge? This shaft
connects up to a dry outfall, a Victorian looking structure under the
bridge. The Parks Department managers disclaim it. The Central Sewerage
Division managers are quite certain that it is nothing to do with them
either. The spring, they say, was never included in their remit.
I am satisfied that no sewage goes into the river at that point. I am
told that once a year it is inspected, so someone, somewhere, knows
something about it. There are old mine workings there, Kirklee Station
was built above one of the seams. This could explain the origin of the
spring, its iron content and the existence of the shaft, which is
probably checked for build-ups of methane gas. If it is the spring it
would be nice to have it back when/if the bridge is replaced, which I
understand will happen when Strathclyde light railway is built, making
use of the tunnel.

To many people, the Caribbean sounds like the ultimate holiday with
coconut trees swaying gently in the wind, miles of golden, deserted
beaches, and crystal-clear waters to dive into. Ken Smith investigates
if it is still the paradise of old.
IT WAS the Italian silk sheets that finally came between film star Tom
Cruise and hotel executive Lisa Porta, sadly ensuring that they would
never become the best of friends.
Lisa was in charge of helping Hollywood movie-makers create The Firm,
starring Cruise, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Grand Cayman, the largest
of the three Cayman Islands.
The Caymans. Almost 500 miles away from America, down, and to the left
of Cuba, the three dots on the map always had that cachet of romantic
and memorable holidaymaking for the discerning.
Hard-headed businessmen know it for something else -- its stability as
a British Crown Colony has helped make it the largest island banking
centre in the world with 560 banks and more than 31,000 registered
companies -- more companies than there are people.
It was here that writer John Grisham had the main character in his
book fleeing from Mafia killers, and it was here that Tom Cruise was
playing the character, only off-screen he was fleeing from the press.
Said Porta: ''I ended up with a sheaf of faxes as high as my desk when
dealing with Tom Cruise's office. We offered him and his family a villa
to live in during filming. But his office wanted a list of every single
thing in the villa. Then they wanted changes which we tried to
accommodate.
''But when it came to objecting to our sheets, saying that only
Italian silk would do, we had to say no. Eventually they hired a private
villa.
''Gene Hackman did stay here though with his wife. They were a lovely
couple. She's a concert pianist, and played our hotel piano.''
Hollywood stars, playing the piano under the stars. Sounds idyllic.
But it's an idyll preserved only with some stringent controls.
Although there are only about 30,000 Cayman islanders, the Governor,
appointed by the Queen, and his executive council, keep entry
qualifications beyond the reach of most -- unless you have the money.
There is very little unemployment, and no income tax, incidentally. It
took years for an American hotel chain to get permission to build there
because there were simply not enough Caymanians looking for a job to
work there.
Work permits are issued to Brits, Jamaicans, Irish, and Americans
mainly to fill the jobs, but after even six years of working there, you
will not get a renewal and will have to leave.
The only ones who can stay are those rich enough to buy a house
costing at least #100,000 and with enough income to support themselves
for two years. Paradise at a price.
Public begging or trying to sell goods on the beaches is illegal,
making sunbathing particularly hassle-free. With so few residents, and
with an average household income of $68,000, thefts and muggings are
minimal. There is poverty. It just seems to be hidden away more than on
other islands.
Grand Cayman, the largest of the three, is only 22 miles long and
eight miles wide. But it's what's around it that the visitors come for.
Some of the most unpolluted clear sea waters in the world. A diver's
paradise. Visibility can often exceed 100 ft.
The diving is superb for serious divers, but even for mere snorkellers
there are memorable treats.
Sting Ray City is a bay beside a coral reef where the water is only
10ft deep. About 20 sting rays, like giant floating kites, swim slowly
around the tourist boats attracted by bits of squid. Incredibly
friendly, they will allow you to swim with them, cuddle and stroke them.
For those that don't like getting their feet wet, there are submarine
trips. You sit at large portholes, and the sub takes you down about 90ft
where you watch the coral, hoping for the marine life to swim past.
As if that wasn't a sufficient way to get out of your depth, one
American hired divers to take a banner down while he was on board with
his girlfriend, and they unfurled it at the porthole with a message
asking her to marry him. Couldn't imagine John Mills doing that in We
Dive At Dawn.
Kathryn Leggatt, after leaving the islands at the age of seven to go
to school in England, and then college in America, returned to become
Customer Services Manager for Atlantis Submarines.
''I know some people think the island is too small and can't stand
living here. But I always wanted to return, although my brother is
farming at Hawick. He always wanted to be a farmer, and there's little
chance of doing that here,'' she says.
Curiously, while one brother is in rugby-mad Hawick, another helps run
the Cayman Rugby Club. Only problem is there is no other team on the
island. Their motto is: ''We're not fed up playing with ourselves,''
says Kathryn.
They did go to Cuba once on hearing of a rugby club there, but the
standard was not good, so they spent the week coaching the enthusiastic
youngsters, and donated most of their kit to the impoverished Cubans.
''If any club would like to visit us, we would certainly be
interested,'' she adds.
So the diving is excellent, the climate is perpetual summer, and empty
beaches can easily be found. Drawbacks? Food and drink can be a bit
expensive as most have to be imported. It doesn't even have its own
brewery.
And then there are the cruise-ships. For the newly wed and the nearly
dead as they say. Lit up at night like Blackpool trams, they queue up
every day to disgorge hundreds of day-trippers.
It's the constant dilemma of tourism. Become popular and you threaten
to destroy the thing that made you popular in the first place --
although Cayman is still full of deserted areas to qualify for the
description of unspoilt for many years yet.
For the past 18 years, a John Denver-style crooner calling himself the
Barefoot Man has played guitar almost every night at the Holiday Inn on
Seven Mile Beach. He's good. Holidaymakers buy his tapes by the thousand
although I suspect they don't sound so good during a wet weekend in
Salford.
But Barefoot Man now has itchy feet. He says that the island has grown
too fast. ''The bottom line for the Cayman economy is tourism,'' he
says.
''People want quiet stretches of white sandy beach, and when that no
longer exists in Cayman we are in deep trouble.''
He is thinking of moving to a more deserted location in the Caribbean.
Lilian and Ian Ross are from Glasgow. Ian works in the financial
sector, part of the expat community which, despite the hot weather, will
still hold Burns Suppers and St Andrew's Nights.
Says Lilian: ''Cayman has changed in the past few years. People have
to work incredibly long hours here. It's just expected of you.
''Is it paradise? Perhaps not,'' she says then adds after a pause,
''But where is these days?''
KEN Smith travelled to the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands with Kuoni
Travel of Dorking, Surrey, who have inclusive packages to both countries
with direct flights from London Gatwick on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Prices vary, but Kuoni's Caribbean brochure offers seven nights at
Treasure Island, Grand Cayman, including flights for #699 in September.
A week in the Bahamas at the Nassau Beach hotel costs #681 in
September.
More expensive all inclusive holidays which include meals, drinks and
watersports are also available. Kuoni's brochures are available from
most travel agents.

Ken Smith finds a Caribbean have which, though perhaps a little frayed
at the edges, still harbours delicious surprises among its 700 islands.
BUSINESS tycoon Al at the next table has the florid complexion,
stressed look, and rolls of chin fat of an obvious heart-attack
candidate. Only he has already had them. Two heart attacks, in fact.
But the hospital staff kept his heart pumping. So he generously
invited the raucous Emergency Room team down from New York for a
sybaritic thank-you at the Ocean Club -- the most exclusive hotel on
Paradise Island, a bridge away from Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas.
As dinner is served, Al turns maudlin, gets to his feet, pleads for
silence, and thanks them for saving his life. ''I've got news for you
Al,'' shouts back one of the New Yorkers. ''You didn't survive them.
You're in heaven.''
Which is what the Ministry of Tourism would like every visitor to
think when visiting the Bahamas -- a scattering of 700 tiny islands as
if carelessly tossed by God into the sea between Florida and Cuba.
But the Bahamians know that even if it is heaven, it's becoming
frayed. After 10 years of indifferent service and little investment,
they now acknowledge that you cannot assume the tourists will always
roll up by cruise ship and plane, to buy the T-shirts, swim in the sea,
and burn their white skins.
There are two types of tourists in the Bahamas. The Americans, and the
rest of the world. That's not to denigrate the Americans. It's just that
America is only 50 miles away. They go to the Bahamas for long weekends
the same way Brits take last-minute holidays to Majorca. They don't see
it as any big deal.
So they go to Cable Beach at Nassau and Paradise Island -- it used to
be Hog Island, but the hoteliers didn't like the name. So if the
Scottish Tourist Board thinks Mull is too dull, perhaps it could follow
suit.
The Americans gamble at the casinos, sit at the pool, take the
occasional boat ride. If they come by cruise ship, and thousands do
every day, they circle Nassau's small shopping area stocking up on
T-shirts, jewellery, and perfume. It can be, just a shade, tacky.
Fortunately the Europeans are more adventurous. Even if they do stay
at Cable Beach, they will explore the other islands more. A Bahamian
will take you to a deserted island for $15 by motorboat, and for a few
hours you can pretend to be Robinson Crusoe, even to the extent of
casting anxious glances at the water, wondering if he will remember to
return for you. Others travel further by boat or local plane to the
beautiful, but less developed, islands such as Eleuthera with its pink
sand beaches, or the Exumas, with the clearest water imaginable.
The trade winds blow almost constantly, giving the Bahamas a warm,
agreeable climate, which varies little year-round, although September to
May is best. Even the sudden short downpours are dismissed as ''liquid
sun''.
Away from the towns, the beaches are deserted, the sea life
magnificent, and the water itself shimmers with all shades of blue as
you snorkel among blue parrotfish, yellowtailed snappers, and black
groupers. Sit back in the shade with a can of the local Kilik beer, and
you eventually mutter that this is paradise.
But the Caribbean isn't all paradise. Across the sea, Jamaica's
Kingston, for example, can be a violent town where young people drifting
in from the countryside seeking jobs and finding none, see monied
tourists as tempting targets for robbery. Elsewhere, in Antigua, a
British tourist was shot and seriously injured during a recent robbery.
In the Bahamas there are worries about the drug trade which uses the
islands as a stopover between Colombia and America. Prime Minister
Hubert Ingraham believes the eighties were the worst time, when drug
trafficking brought ready money which in turn, he says, led to
self-interest and the erosion of traditional family life.
But he's shrewd. Instead of panicking, he insisted not so much on more
police officers, but on better trained officers. To fight the culture of
easy money, he is attempting to instil in people a better sense of
tradition, family, and respect for their own Bahamian culture.
Culture can be a difficult area, though. The original Indians who
settled in the Bahamas were wiped out by slavery and disease. Most of
the present islanders are descendants of the slaves brought over by
British Loyalists who fled from the American Revolution. But the
Scottish and English influence in this Commonwealth country is still
strong, and the cultures intertwine.
Go along to Prince George Wharf in Nassau and ask for Henry Higgins.
It's a name that sounds like an English professor. But Henry is proud of
his African roots. His main work is with Junkanoo, the two-day street
carnival at Christmas and New Year where the islanders parade all night
carrying huge gaudy floats created from paper and wire to the constant
beat of African rhythms and Caribbean calypso.
''It takes about six months to make a large float. The rule is that
only one person can carry a float at any one time yet they can weigh up
to 200 pounds. You carry it as far as you can, then someone else takes
over. I find that a little drop of brandy helps,'' he says.
Those not carrying the floats are either dancing, blowing whistles,
beating drums, or ringing home-made cow-bells. Sleep is not an option on
these nights.
Aware that visitors see little of the real Bahamas, the Government is
keen to push its People-to-People programme. You phone the tourist
office in advance and they match you up with a local who will perhaps
cook you a meal at home, take you to church, or just show you around.
''Visitors can meet anyone from a Member of Parliament to a straw
vendor, to a maid in a hotel,'' says Priscilla Williams, the programme's
manager.
''What do you do for a living?'' I asked the little old lady sitting
next to me on one such visit to a Bahamian household. ''My husband's the
Governor-General,'' she said simply.
Outside influences cannot be stopped, though. For Sol Kerzner has
arrived. The son of Russian immigrants to South Africa, Sol built the
spectacular, or horrific, depending on your view, Sun City in South
Africa.
He has now taken over three hotels on Paradise Island and created
Atlantis. Not cheaply either. Some $125m has been poured into a
wonderland around the refurbished hotels with pools of sharks, 40
waterfalls, underground grottoes, rope bridges like an Indiana Jones
film, 35,000 pounds of tropical fish, man-made coral, and three million
gallons of water recycled four times a day.
He simply believes it will become one of the most sought-after resorts
in the world. Enjoying the diversity of a foreign country without having
to leave the grounds of your hotel may make the true traveller feel
slightly uneasy, but it will be a success. Sol is not the kind of man
who throws money away.
So if paradise outside is becoming frayed, simply spend the money to
create an artificial paradise which people can visit at a price. The
world is becoming a series of themelands, but for the more adventurous
there are still many unspoilt islands in the Bahamas. God obviously knew
what He was doing when He made 700 of them.

Iain White dons his bathing suit and follows in the footsteps of the
Victorian gentry to the great spa towns of Britain.
I GAZED suspiciously at the evil-smelling liquid clouding the glass in
front of me. ''The best way to take it sir, is to hold your nose and
swallow it down in one go . . .'' said the attendant with a knowing
smile. I gulped it down. It had smelled of rotten eggs but tasted more
like rotten socks. I had been assured it was very good for me, for I was
following in the tradition of ''taking the waters'' -- once a standard
medical practice throughout fashionable Georgian society.
The origins of these spa waters go back beyond Roman times when
mineral springs and holy wells associated with local myths were
attributed with healing properties. The Tudors started the habit of
imbibing these liquids for health purposes, but it was not until the
eighteenth century that towns were transformed into fashionable watering
places where the elite could gather to gossip, gamble, and flirt while
taking the waters.
Spa towns flourished and became the haunts of royalty, gentry, and the
literary set as they flocked to see and be seen. Nowadays, spa towns are
often associated with visions of bathchairs and gouty old colonels.
So what has happened to these genteel, gracious places with their
seemingly eccentric habits of bathing in brine, mud or peat? The British
Spas Federation (BSF) can account for 12 member towns. Armed with a
bathing suit and a strong constitution, I went in search of the healing
waters.
My first stop was Harrogate, Yorkshire which for decades was renowned
as one of the world's great spas. It owes its entire existence to the
health- giving properties of more than a hundred ferrous and sulphur
springs which each contain unique mineral combinations. In the early
days the waters bubbled to the surface uncontrolled, and the population
collected them as best they could. Fears of disease and concern that
leprous people would ''. . . wash their soores and cleanse their
besmeared clougs . . .'' led to the erection of four well heads around
1772.
In 1842 the Royal Pump Room was constructed to allow the genteel
Victorian clientele a degree of privacy from the poorer classes who were
left to share a public pump outside the building which is still in
operation today. At the turn of the century the Royal Baths superceded
this, and within a short time it was to become one of the largest
hydrotherapy establishments in the world.
Every year wealthy visitors flocked to the town not only to take the
waters but to join in the 'Harrogate Season.' This unofficially came
between the end of the rigorous 'London Season' and the start of grouse
shooting and was an ideal stopping-off spot for the privileged on their
way north to Scotland.
It was said that at times there could have been a meeting of the
Cabinet in the Pump Room because so many members of the Government
visited Harrogate during the season. Kings, emperors, and maharajas were
regular visitors in its heyday and it reached its zenith when in 1911
the Queens of Britain, Russia, and Portugal all stayed in the little
town.
With the introduction of the NHS in 1948, Harrogate looked set for
decline but a new conference centre now brings in the odern hordes who
come for business rather than pleasure. The waters can still be taken
here, as my shattered taste-buds evidenced, and Harrogate still provides
an opportunity to sample the elegance of this rich spa heritage.
The original Turkish Baths, opened in 1897, are still doing business
in the most majestic and ostentatious surroundings of The Royal Baths
Assembly Rooms. Here you can experience the wonderful indulgence of the
past amid opulent mahogany cubicles and mosaic floors.
Harrogate has its eyes on the future too, for sitting as it does on
the world's largest concentration of spring waters, it has hopes of
marketing a brand of water which is palatable as well as health-giving
in a bid to revive its position as a leading spa town.
The City of Bath hardly hardly needs to look forward, for its
attraction lies firmly in its historical past. It owes its name and fame
to the only hot springs in the British Isles. Ranking as one Britain's
top 10 tourist cities, it is perhaps the best known spa town in the
country.
Designated as an International World Heritage site, it shares the
distinction with only two other cities, Rome and Florence. The city has
almost 5000 listed buildings. The centrepiece is the Roman Baths. The
thermal waters still bubble up in profusion from an underground spring
at the rate of a million litres per day and at a constant 46.5 degrees
centigrade.
But the spa facilities have not been in operation since 1978 when a
health scare led to the suspension of their use. Many of the buildings
are closed including the Old Street Bath and the Beau Street Bath; for
many of the millions of tourists who annually visit the city, the lack
of spa facilities comes as a surprise and disappointment.
European visitors find this particularly bewildering for on the
continent there is an established spa culture which has moved on with
the changing times. In France, Switzerland, and Germany such
establishments are marketed as health and leisure resorts and are
extremely popular. Conference centres and business tourism are tied in
with hotels, restaurants and casinos to lure people into the towns (to
some extent this is happening at Harrogate).
In Baden-Baden more than half the overnight visitors to the town
indulge themselves by taking the waters and in Hungary, Budapest has a
remarkable 15 spas.
To the north of Bath is Cheltenham, to which the rich and famous once
descended seeking the promise of a cure for anything from constipation
to gout. Its haughty elegance is reflected in the broad promenade of
grand Regency houses which sweeps through the town.
Spa facilities are thin on the ground as the beautiful, domed pump
room now serves as a concert hall; while it is still possible to sample
the only naturally alkaline water in England here, there is little else
related to the town's former function. Most visitors come for the famous
racecourse where the three-day National Hunt Festival is held every
March.
On to Royal Leamington Spa and Royal Tunbridge Wells, which share more
than a Royal prefix. Both offer elegant gardens and parks ablaze with
floral colour and smart shops overflowing with quality goods. But
neither offers spa facilities beyond a taste of their waters. Indeed the
rabid commercialism of the nineties has made its first inroad in wealthy
Tunbridge.
It seems the privatisation of water knows no boundaries for at the
Chalybeate Spring in the elegant Pantilles you will find costumed
'Dippers' who will serve you a glass of the iron-bearing mineral water
for a fee, 30 pence.
Charged up by your ferrous dram you can then visit the feature 'A day
at the wells' which traces the town's heritage by taking you back to the
spa's Georgian heyday. Sadly, this is the nearest you will get to
experiencing the real thing.
A trip to the spa town of Llandrindod Wells in Wales revealed much to
offer the visitor. A week-long Victorian festival recreates the era of
the town's great days as a spa resort, but again little remains of the
functioning spa save the ubiquitious pump room from which four different
mineral waters may be taken. There are plans to revive its popularity by
building a high-tech hydrotherapy treatment centre and proposals to
bottle the water.
On the other side of England in the beautiful Lincolnshire Wolds is
Woodhall Spa, perhaps the most anomalous of these spa towns. Engineers
discovered water rich in iodine and bromide containing many healing
properties while searching for coal in 1811; nowadays it is not even
possible to get a glass of this water.
In the Derbyshire Peak District there are two spa towns close to each
other where I was, at last, able to dip my toes in the healing waters.
Buxton developed as a Roman health resort on the site of prolific warm
mineral springs and can number among its many distinguished visitors
Mary Queen of Scots, who was allowed by her captors to come here to
treat her rheumatism.
The town flourished as the ''Bath of the North'' in the eighteenth
century and today you can still enjoy its outstandingly beautiful
architecture.
Buxton Spring Water, bottled in the town, can be sampled freely at the
fountain in the crescent, and although the thermal baths were closed in
1972, the Indoor Spa Water Swimming Pool is there for visitors to enjoy
the mineral properties of the waters.
Down the road in the Derbyshire Dales is the inland resort of Matlock
Bath nicknamed ''Little Switzerland''. Baths were contructed here to
take advantage of the naturally occuring thermal springs; this
fashionable spa town was patronised by those seeking tranquility amid
spectacular surroundings.
Today the visitor can take the warm waters from the Victorian pump
within the Tourist Information Centre and bathe in the spa waters of the
plunge and outdoor pools of the New Bath Hotel, which is built on the
site of a thermal spring.
A visit to Worcestershire revealed two more spa towns whose approach
to their spa heritage show a marked difference. Situated among the
wonderful hills of south-west Worcestershire, Malvern is famous for its
invigorating air and its pure water. The water which has a centuries-old
reputation for its restorative qualities is bottled and widely
available. Indeed the Queen is believed to take it with her on her
travels for morning tea. Yet although the well-houses of the Holy Well
and Ann's Well have survived, there are no facilities to indulge your
body in the medicinal waters of this ''Metropolis of the Water Cure''.
Droitwich Spa developed as a fashionable resort towards the end of
last century but this relatively late start has not hindered its
popularity. It's one of the few spa towns which actually offers spa
treatments today. Indeed Droitwich is unique among the spa towns of
Britain because of the extraordinary brine content of its water.
Unlike most of its rivals it can boast recent major developments
including the Spa Brine Baths, built in 1985. The natural brine contains
2.5 pounds of salt per gallon, 10 times stronger than seawater and
rivalled only by the Dead Sea. In 1992 a further #2.5m extension was
opened; bathers can experience the therapeutic and remedial benefits of
weightless floating.
Watered down to seawater strength the brine is also used in the
''Lido'' pool where visitors can swim in the only inland, outdoor
saltwater swimming pool.
Here in Scotland there has always been a profusion of healthy waters
and spas could be found at Innerleithen, Pitkeathly, Bridge of Earn, and
Moffat. But by far the most successful and popular has always been the
small village of Strathpeffer in the Highlands. Sleeper trains once
brought the fashionably unhealthy, with their attendants, 600 miles
north to savour the healing waters and immerse themselves in the world's
first peat baths.
Amid the elaborate profusion of balconies and turrets of the Gothic
villas, an elegant bath house with glazed verandas dominated the square.
Today the village is a period-piece of oppulent Victorian and
Edwardian architecture nestling somewhat incongruously among the
majestic hills above Dingwall. Tourists still stop to admire the village
whose original fabric stands complete, save for one thing . . . . the
spa facilities.
The magnificent baths were pulled down and the railway fell foul of
the Beeching cuts. The original pump room with its magnificent interior
remains boarded up and disintegrating, while the once grand Spa Pavilion
sits decaying amid the undergrowth of weeds.
Strathpeffer was the twelfth member of the BSF but its recent
withdrawal from the federation seems to encapsulate the many problems
experienced by these resorts. While attractive new octagonal pump rooms
were built with their help to allow visitors to continue tasting the
highly sulphurous waters, the decline of the village as a spa town has
continued.
Ian MacCrae, chairman of Ross and Cromarty Tourist Board, feels the
BSF have been intransigent and he is critical of the private ownership
of the spa buildings which has hampered their development. The pavilion
and pump room have been owned by both Mecca and Rank who seem more
interested in promoting their hotel investments than offering healing
waters.
They are believed to be negotiating with Highland Region to sell them
the spa buildings and grounds and offload the responsibility. The
village is caught in the midst of these internal wrangles. As the delays
and uncertainties continue it may be that Strathpeffer will end up
having to consign its active spa status to the past.
The new marketing director of the BSF, Linda Cluckie, is optimistic
that development of spa facilities can be encouraged in a bid to compete
with those on the continent. She has pledged to create an environment
where private development of spa treatment centres can be encouraged.
Under consideration are large-scale investments at Bath, Llandrindod
Wells, and Royal Leamington Spa.
But health farms and hotels are beginning to make inroads into this
market and down on the Ayrshire coast there is a relatively new upstart
with no spa heritage which is competing hard with the ageing Victorian
spa towns.
Turnberry Hotel opened its spa facilities in 1991 and is providing all
the activities and treatments once associated with its illustrious
ancestors. Set above the smooth manicured greens of its famous golf
links, the purpose-built spa provides up to 25 treatments including
hydrotherapy baths, full body algae wraps, mud masks, aromatherapy, jet
douches, skin care, massage, and anti-stress treatments.
Among the steam rooms, bio-saunas, solarium, and swimming pool you
will find qualified therapists who will cater for all your health needs.
As images of bathchairs and gouty old colonels recede there is a further
irony. The one thing you will not find among all this state-of-the-art
health technology is a glass of spa water.

Nothing is left to the luck of the draw in the children's books
market. It's all carefully mapped out, as Jennifer Cunningham discovers.
BACK to school and the bookshops are full of reference and text books.
In an increasingly discriminating market for children's non-fiction,
publishers competing with CD-ROM and the Internet are going for
illustration in a big way.
Latest in the See Through History series from Hamlyn are Houses and
Homes by Tim Wood and Submarines and Ships by Richard Humble (both
#8.99). Both operate on the ''short history of'' model: a race through
the subject with a stop at significant moments along the way, offering
the possibility of random dipping or poring over detail.
Submarines and Ships ranges from rafts and coracles to nuclear-powered
super carriers. Special treatment en route is given to a Roman merchant
ship, Chinese super-junk, the first successful submarine and the French
transatlantic liner, the Normandie, by way of a double-sided plastic
page with external view on one side and internal cross-section on the
other. It is cleverly done, allowing the relevant text to be read with
both illustrations.
The same see-through technique is used in Houses and Homes for the
astonishing palace of the Assyrian warrior king, Sargon II, built of mud
bricks, the great Loire chateau of Chambord, a Mayan wattle and daub
house, and a weaver's cottage in a brick terrace. Both offer an
exhilarating gallop through a large subject balanced the fascination of
fine detail and the possibility of new discoveries at each re-reading.
More scrapbook in style, but equally well-researched and lavishly
illustrated with a wealth of archive material and photographs, are two
in Hamlyn's Daily Life series. Laura Wilson has chosen to tackle both
Daily Life in a Victorian House (#4.99 paperback) and Daily Life in a
Wartime House (#9.99 hardback) from the point of view of a particular
family in a particular house.
This is social history in a very friendly format: food features very
thoroughly, the lives of children are documented, and quotations from
members of the families are used deftly.
The raft of Oxford reference books ranges ever wider, but the latest
lexicographical sprog, a new edition of their Junior Dictionary, has the
family virtues of simple definition illustrated by contextual usage.
Extra clarity for young users is achieved by printing the stem word in
red, with plurals and other forms also listed with each part of speech
named. Despite the principle of simplicity, the entries stretch to 6000,
including such modernisms as camcorder, childminder, and user-friendly
(but not byte).
Penguin Classics have proved a hit with young readers, in spite of
small liguistic difficulties, perhaps simply showing how classic they
are. Among the latest titles (all under #4 for large print paperbacks)
are What Katy Did Next, The Family from One End Street, Little Men, and
The Mysterious Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. All these (even Katy) have
a fascination for both boys and girls: a testament to the power of the
narrative.
Children's longing for adventure remains universal. The treatment
varies from fantasy to documentary. Scales, the friendly dragon, both
helps and needs help from Sam and his friends who move effortlessly
between the Magic Mountain and Mrs Green's classroom in the space of a
playtime. June Counsel's Dragon in Top Class (#2.99, Corgi Yearling)
offers younger readers a jolly good story as well as an artful weave of
science and magic. ''I expect it's magic when we don't know and science
when we do,'' concludes the unflappable Mrs Green.
Not all teachers are so benign. This year's winner of the Carnegie
Medal, Theresa Breslin, has moved into new territory with Alien Force
(Dutton, #9.99). Jodie has arrived in a Scottish primary school from the
planet Dijan, his mission to save the earth from destruction by an alien
force, which turns out to be his class teacher. It is a sparely-written
exploration of feelings of belonging, strangeness, and friendship for
younger readers.
These are the themes of the moment, encompassing, for older readers,
family relationships and even political activism. No Turning Back
(Viking, #10.99) has both. At 12, Sipho escapes from his drunken,
bullying stepfather, by running away to become one of Johannesburg's
street children. Beverley Naidoo chronicles life on the streets -- a
chance mixture of harassment and kindness for Sipho and his friends. No
happy-ever-after fairy tale, this is a moving tale of the new South
Africa, ending with the possibility of reconciliation but no promises.
Reconciliation between two parts of herself, between herself and her
mother, is the theme of Lizzie's Leaving by Joan Lingard (Hamish
Hamilton, #9.99). When 15-year-old Lizzie leaves the chaotic family home
for her father's calm, comfortable house, she discovers that the grass
is not as green as it seems. An absorbing book for anyone whose family
extends to steps and halves, this shrewdly-observed tale is told in the
upbeat idiom of today's teenagers which gives it instant cred.
The embarrassing and endearing nature of families is celebrated in A
Fine Summer Knight by Jan Mark (Viking, #10.99). Lonely and confined to
a strictly-limited neighbourhood by the terror lurking in every parent's
mind, Grace Thompson spies a knight in shining armour through a
telescope. He turns out to be both a real and metaphorical one, whose
niece, Dizzy, is as much in need of a friend as Grace. Together they
solve not only the problem of their loneliness but several impinging on
their eccentric families. Jan Mark has crafted a gentle but memorable
and joyful tale.
The laudable aim of the Scottish Children's Press is to publish in
Scots for young readers. The first two offerings are narrative versions
of two well-known rhymes, Aiken Drum and Kitty Bairdie (both #4.95).
Retold by Anne Forsyth in a straightforward style -- more pawky than
mawkish -- and illustrated in traditional nursery-rhyme fashion by
Dianne Sutherland. Aimed at younger readers, they are books for reading
aloud.

There may be a certain familiarity with the authors and illustrators
who, despite increasing competition, dominate the children's book
market. Anne Johnstone argues, however, that this does not diminish a
creative bonanza.
THE children's book scene is like the world of tennis. Many new names
compete for a space on your bookshelf but when you come to weigh up
seriously what's on offer, the same authors and illustrators seem to
rise to the top of the pile again and again. A trawl through recent
publications produces an impressive group of top seeds on the kids
circuit: Rod Campbell, Eric Carle, Sarah Garland, Hilda Offen, Korky
Paul, and Michael Foreman. And there are some good veteran doubles too:
John Yeoman and wacky illustrator Quentin Blake, for instance. Here's a
selection for the under-eights, including both old hands and some
relative newcomers.
First the hardbacks. Little Bird (Campbell Books, #5.99), for ages two
to six, satisfies all the requirements for a first-class book for
two-year-olds. It has a clear simple story with a nice rhythm and shape
to it and, though not a board book, it has tough tear-resistant pages.
There's a touch of pathos and a nice surprise at the end.
Over On The Farm by Christopher Gunson (Doubleday #8.99) for
two-to-six-year-olds is based on a traditional counting rhyme and makes
nice use of colour and texture in its depictions of owls blinking, foxes
rustling, pigs snuggling and the like.
The Very Lonely Firefly by Eric Carle (Hamish Hamilton, #12.99) for
three-to-seven-year-olds. This seems an awful lot for what is basically
a variation of the 25-year-old classic The Very Hungry Caterpillar, even
if the batteries are renewable! But there's something very appealing
about Carle's bright collage pictures and small children readily
identify with his lonely vulnerable insects roaming through a world full
of big menacing creatures.
Grandma's Shoes by Libby Hathorn (Viking, #9.99) for
five-to-nine-year-olds. ''Who could ever step into such a woman's
shoes?'' people ask at an old lady's funeral. Her granddaughter, bereft
at her loss, takes the comment literally and decides to try. She starts
to find healing in the discovery that people live on not only in their
possessions but also in dreams, images, memories, and the skills and
gifts they have passed on in their lifetimes. A beautiful book which
could play an important role in helping a child adjust to such a loss.
Making Masks for Children by Gillian Chapman and Pam Robson (Macdonald
Young Books Ltd, #8.99) for ages five and up. Help your kids turn
themselves into circus clowns, medieval knights, or even ancient gods
with this imaginative, easy-to-follow project book which draws on
mask-making traditions from around the world.
New paperbacks: Going to Playschool, Doing the Washing, Having a
Picnic, and Coming to Tea by Sarah Garland (Puffin, #3.99 each) for the
two-to-four-year-olds. A reissue of those authentic and funny depictions
of the ups and downs of life with small children. Amid the chaos and
exhaustion Garland never loses sight of the joy.
Elephant Pie by Hilda Offen (Puffin, #3.99) for
three-to-six-year-olds. The crocodile tears turn to a flood when Mrs
Elephant confuses mustard with custard for Mrs Snipper-Snapper's
birthday party. Delightfully messy and full of surprises.
There's a Bear in the Bath by Nanette Newman (Puffin, #4.99) for
three-to-seven-year-olds. The bear who invites himself to Liza's house
to tea doesn't like porridge. But he does like coffee, crosswords,
dancing the tango, and drinking shampoo! The humour is well matched by
Michael Foreman's zany illustrations.
The Singing Tortoise and Other Animal Folk Tales by John Yeoman and
Quentin Blake (Gollancz, #4.99) for five-to-10-year-olds. From the
brilliant duo who brought us Featherbrains and The Family Album, here is
a good value-for-money set of folk tales in which animals use their
native cunning to get their own back on humans and each other.
The Toad Prince by Linda Jennings (Macdonald Young Books, #3.50) for
ages six to eight turns the princess and bullfrog story on its head.
Aimed at fluent readers.
The Rascally Cake by Jeanne Willis and Korky Paul (Puffin, #4.99) for
four-to-eight-year-olds. Paul's brilliantly witty and richly detailed
illustrations are perfect for this truly revolting rhyming moral tale of
gluttony and revenge.

TODAY I'm not going to be nice about Wemyss Ware. Where does it all
come from? Is it constantly being re-cycled in salerooms? How long is
its vogue going to last?
It is in force again at the most social-event sale of the year,
Sotheby's annual two-day bonanza at Gleneagles Hotel on Monday and
Tuesday.
For the Monday sale, the auctioneers have managed to amass 170 lots of
Wemyss Ware and it seems like they have all been seen before -- pigs
painted with roses; jam pots decorated with strawberries; cats covered
with clovers; flower-slop buckets (who uses one of them today?); match
holders; mugs and two-handed cups all bearing the characteristic Wemyss
designs. They are not losing value yet anyway because prices range from
#150 for an inkpot to about #6000 for a vase catalogued as rare because
it is painted with a melange of flowers, possibly by artist Karl Nekola.
Sotheby's Gleneagles sale is very much a country-house type,
''hunting, shooting and fishing set'', event. Pictures tend to depict
couthy gamekeepers pointing out animals or birds waiting to be killed to
aristocratic-looking gents: grazing stags in suitably remote scenery or
romanticised cottage interiors. No squalor, no real poverty, just pride
in humble circumstances sort of thing.
What is much more interesting is the selection of sporting bronzes
which Sotheby's have collected for this sale. There are always one or
two at the Gleneagles sale but this year more than 600 have been
gathered together, to be sold on Tuesday.
All date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and some of the
best examples are by French sculptors who made a speciality of animalier
bronzes.
Two of the most attractive are a pair of donkeys, both saddled and one
wearing panniers. They are by Alfred Barye and Auguste-Nicolas Cain.
Barye died in 1882 and Cain in 1894. Sotheby's have estimated the
donkeys at between #1500 and #2000 each.
Donkeys are very much in evidence in the sale because there is
another, more expensive one, on offer by Isidore Jules Bonheur
(1827-1901), brother of the painter Rosa. Of a bad-tempered looking
little donkey taking a kick at nothing, it is a humorous, lively study
which justifies its high estimate at around #6000. One of the regrets of
my life is that I did not buy a Bonheur bronze of a racehorse and jockey
that was auctioned in Tweedmouth auction rooms a few years ago for about
#2500. On today's prices that had to be a bargain and even now bronzes
do not seem to have reached their maximum potential. They are an
up-and-coming market.
Other examples of work by French sculptors are horses by Pierre-Jules
Mene; dogs by Christophe Fratin and Jean Joire; and stags by
Antoine-Louis Barye. A French artist who specialised in birds was Jules
Moigniez, and a very vigorous bronze by him of a pheasant fleeing from a
lizard is estimated at between #2000 and #3000.
While the French made a speciality of animal bronzes, there are other
notable ones in the sale by sculptors of different nationalities,
notably Barney Seale, RA, a British sculptor who died in 1957. Sotheby's
catalogue his dog study as the head of a Scots terrier but it looks more
like an Airedale to me. The price is between #700 and #1000.
Perhaps the most awe-inspiring of the bronzes is a vase by Christophe
Fratin. It is covered in animal figures, particularly horses, and around
the foot and stem is an amazing profusion of animals, birds, and fish.
Vases such as this were made by sculptors to show off their skill and
they were often exhibited at international exhibitions. Sotheby's expect
this fine example to fetch a price in the region of #7000.
The pictures are to be sold in two sessions on Tuesday evening and
among them are examples of the big names of Scottish art -- Peploe,
Hornel, Ferguson, et al -- carrying more reasonable estimates than they
have Borne in past years. The market for them has not yet seen a
resurgence. However, a really big price is expected for the charmed name
of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whose pale lemon-coloured Winter Rose,
painted in 1916 at his studio in Hans Place, London, carries an estimate
of #20,000 to #30,000.
MARKET NEWS
* LOVERS of Glasgow with a bit of spare money in their pockets might
be interested to know that a painting of Broomielaw Bridge in 1882 by
Pollok Sinclair Nisbet, a pupil of Horatio McCulloch, is to be sold at
Phillips in Edinburgh on September 1. The painting has been sent for
auction by Nisbet's grandson and the estimate is around #2000.

Boys will be girls in the modelling world, so where does that leave
the women? Anvar Khan attempts to find out who's who in the cosmetics
world.
TRANSVESTITES take good care of their looks. They are always
well-groomed, more plastic, glam and camp than Joan Collins. It makes
sense, then, that Mac cosmetics have recruited cross-dresser Ru Paul, to
launch their new range. Supermodels Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer,
have made it easy for the transvestite to infiltrate the modelling
world. They have the long, muscular proportions of a slim athletic man.
But even in the world of role-swapping, there is hypocrisy.
''Women do not have to dress up in men's clothes anymore,'' says
Domenic Szabo, senior vice-president of Estee Lauder, ''to show that
they are serious and have power.'' Oh, excuse moi. Trust Domenic to
think that the fight for equality can be reduced to a mere change of
clothes. And here's me thinking that if I borrowed my boyfriend's
four-piece I'd get an instant promotion. Who are these women who wear
men's clothes anyway? The Mrs Magoos of this world who wandered into the
wrong department?
Cross-dressing is obviously passe. But just for women. I mean, let's
talk about the economic power the glamour puss has when he's really a
man.

* THE Beauty Box is in receipt of a press release regarding Formula
One talent David Coulthard. He's modelling a brand of trousers by
Savane, and the reason he looks so happy is because he's just chosen
their No 1 pair of wrinkle-free trousers. With these, he can just wash
and go, there's no need for ironing due to their ''unique 2000
crease-free formula''. We very much like the black and white pix of
David leaning leisurely against his motor, he looks so cool and relaxed.
But he has peace of mind, doesn't he? The Beauty Box doesn't mind being
sent portfolios of square-jawed hunks, but when they are highlighted
wearing ''crease-free'' slacks, their mystique, for some reason, just
seems to go.
* The Savane range is available from House of Fraser, Debenhams and
good independent menswear stockists.

The name's a joke but this restuarant is serious about Italian food,
finds Conrad Wilson.
VITO CROLLA, one of the longest-established sources of classy Italian
cooking in Scotland, opened the first Edinburgh restaurant bearing his
name some 20 years ago in Fountainbridge. The brown and silver decor was
by Ron Mackinven.
His second Edinburgh restaurant was Vito's Spaghetti House -- which
was not a spaghetti house at all -- in Frederick Street. This time the
thrust was modern Mediterranean, with ceramic goblets, scrubbed stone
floors, and good seafood. The short-lived Flamingo in Alva Street came
next, followed by the more durable Mr V's, overlooking its own West End
courtyard, where you could eat out of doors on rare warm days.
But now Vito has moved again, this time to Hanover Street, where he
presides over La Dolce Vito, its androgynous name spelt out -- to make
sure you don't miss the joke -- in bold, gleaming letters that catch the
lunchtime sun. Inside, there are further types of ambiguity. The gaudy
entrance area shouts caffe-bar, but this is clearly not the point of the
place. Two stairways lead off -- one up, one down. The first takes you
to a spacious, mock-classical, somewhat formal room, plainly intended
for serious eating, the other to what was once a disco, whose intentions
seem not yet fully defined.
Even the main room, with its pillars and its pink ceiling, seems
dual-purpose. On the one hand there are pizzas and pastas; on the other,
things more ambitious. Vito is a proprietor whose tastes reflect the
times. Mr V's was quite expensive, but with some attractive and original
dishes. La Dolce Vito has settled for more orthodox fare, neither
expensive or cheap, with 10 pasta dishes and a standard Italian
interplay of veal, chicken, steak, and seafood.
The #7.50 two-course lunch is good value, with filetto di merluzzo
livornese (cod in a tomato sauce) and pollo dragonella (chicken with
tarragon) as recent options, quite effectively cooked, though the
accompanying saute potatoes and broccoli seemed rather to have been
lying around -- they were very dried up. But the place, like all Vito's
places, has a certain buzz about it, and the wine list, covering the
entire peninsula, follows some of the new Italian fashions, with a
chardonnay from the Alto Adige, a top-line Corvo from Sicily, and an
Illuminati from the Abruzzi. Since the mark-ups look fairly steep you
may prefer to stick to the reliable house Settesoli.
London trends in Italian cooking are proving slow to reach Scotland.
Not many restaurants place bottles of virgin olive-oil on your table,
and the places that do -- such as the Glasgow and Edinburgh branches of
the Malmaison -- are mostly not Italian. But Silvio's does put good
olive-oil where it belongs: over its wonderful roasted vegetable
antipasti. This excellent Calabrian restaurant, run by Silvio Praino on
the edge of the Water of Leith, has indeed assimilated most of the new
trends into a menu that respects Italian tradition and serves everything
with flair.
Its set lunch at under #10 allows you to choose two dishes from the a
la carte menu -- a generous policy that lets you sample tonno siciliano
(fresh tuna steak with capers, olives, and tomatoes), fettine calabrese
(thin slices of sirloin with oregano, garlic, and lemon), and scampi al
prosciutto (prawns wrapped in Parma ham, with sage and garlic). The
wines steer sufficiently clear of cliche to include Lungarotti's
well-made red Torgiano from Umbria, though the glory of this list lies
in Silvio's obsession with Barolo, of which he has a comprehensive
array, dating back decades.
Bruno Raffaelli, too, offers wine high above the Edinburgh Italian
norm at his smart and very comfortable restaurant near the West End.
Though tradition remains the theme of the Tuscan menu, little
innovations have been allowed to creep in, most of them successful. Thus
the spinach cake -- for long one of the restaurant's most triumphant
starters -- is now rivalled by the insalata contadina, a sumptuously
inviting mixture of salad leaves and pine nuts in an excellent dressing.
Even more sumptuous, to the point of overwhelming the taste buds, is
the razor-thin carpaccio with entruffeled olive-oil. Visually, too, it
lives up to its name. But old-established veal dishes -- well-cut chops
and shin bones -- rightly retain their place on the menu, and are cooked
attentively enough to justify their presence.

Silvio's, 54 The Shore, Leith (Tel: 0131 553 3557).

THE rural cosiness and old charm of the North Yorkshire town of Masham
is well-equipped for a role on the small screen. And with just a morsel
of imagination the young Mr Herriot might be seen driving through its
streets of stone-built houses to the market square where the inviting
aroma of the White Bear public house awaits to reward his efforts of the
day.
The small town is home of Theakston. And from its stable comes some of
the country's most popular beers. Old Peculier, mild, best, and XB find
favour with many drinkers. Old Peculier is best known and its rich,
fruity complex taste is highly respected. Its spelling with an ''e'' is
no mistake and originates from the Norman French when peculier didn't
mean peculiar but particular.
Behind the naming of XB there also lies a tale. When head brewer Hugh
Curley had completed his brew, perhaps one of the most popular bitters
in Britain, he was still without a name for it. The bright boys in
marketing had been asked to put on their thinking caps but had come up
with nothing. The beer was barrelled and ready to go to the pubs, but
what was it to be called?
With still no inspired thoughts and time running out a decision was
imperative. The barrels had to be marked before they left the brewery
but the only stencils lying around were those of the letters B and X.
And so with masterly composition from the combination of letters X and B
there was christened a Theakston beer.
Masham has chosen to be pronounced Mas-ham and has thus given itself a
gentle touch as well as a little bit of class. The Theakston family took
over a brewpub in the village in 1827 and for 50 years the operation was
so contained until demands were such that expansion followed in the
shape of a brewery in 1875.
Although sales success continued, not a lot happened until after the
First World War when Theakston bought the neighbouring Lightfoot
Brewery. Legend has it that this takeover was not done purely in the
interests of business but more as one which would enhance team strength.
Each year Lightfoot brewery cricket team would win the local brewers'
league giving the Theakston lads a severe hiding on the way to glory.
Much irritated by this constant humiliation, Theakston could take defeat
no more and bought Lightfoot thus acquiring a fine pool of cricketers as
part of the bargain.
The company has since been taken over by Scottish and Newcastle but
the Masham brewery has been preserved and brewing continues today using
equipment which has been around when the brewery was founded. But the
story at Masham is much the same as that of many breweries and equipment
used by brewers seems to enjoy a long working life. When humans are well
into retirement, brewery plant such as the mill, with 75 years on the
clock, will be expected to do at least the same again.
The cast-iron mash tun for instance was original to the brewery but
was perhaps not new when it was installed. It is clad in oak and for the
duration of the mash the operator is required to be seated as the
controls and gauges are low set.
Last year almost 25,000 persons were entertained at the visitor centre
which has been created out of former stables. The history of brewing is
shown by video presentation and still photography and artefacts from the
industry add to the show. The skill of the cooper is not forgotten and
his craft plays a major part in the documentary.
Lightfoot is the latest brew from Theakston and Hugh Curley, its
creator, rates it as a light flowery summer beer with good hop aroma. It
certainly has the Theakston taste and may well be around for longer than
the summer.

GUS Macdonald, Managing Director of Scottish Television, is a member
of the Government's Defence Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee,
Chairman of the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival, Vice-President of the
Royal Television Society and Honorary Joint President of BAFTA Scotland
and Visiting Professor of Media and Film Studies at Stirling University.
He lives in Glasgow with his wife Teen. They have two daughters and two
grandchildren.
* THE worst bit of the job is being desk-bound most days or jammed in
cars or on planes. I exercise a few mornings a week in an attempt to
stay fit before a breakfast of fruit and porridge as part of an external
campaign to slim down a stone to ideal weight. I get into Scottish
Television around 8.15am.
I'll have mid-morning coffee then work through most lunch-hours with a
sandwich, apple, and mineral water at my desk. I rarely eat out but have
in-house lunches one or two days a week for guests or staff which are
done more cheaply and tastily by Peter Gilpin, excellent chef recently
returned to Scotland after running the only Scottish restaurant in North
London. There's more fancy food in the line of duty than my drab palate
deserves.
The ITV federal system demands at least a day or two a week in London.
I own a large collection of plastic toothpicks from half-edible
in-flight trays. If business dinners are avoidable, I watch television
at my daughter's house where I stay with minimal microwaved snacks or
occasionally foray out to the extraordinary range of restaurants around
her Islington home.
Dinner at home in Glasgow is usually fish or chicken (seldom red meat)
courtesy of M &amp; S Lite with unlikely fruit-flavoured waters. I'm still
working to overcome the tribal aversion to green vegetables and the
Scots genetic urge for puddings is a constant threat. When eating out
socially, gastroporn menus seem more comical than mouth-watering.
I believe that if baked beans, corn flakes, and ice-cream were
discovered for the first time in a lost Andean valley, a fortune would
be made selling them to food pseuds. My wife, Teen, and I usually graze
off Chinese, Italian, Greek or Indian around Byres Road or Cowcaddens.
I'm impressed that so many Scottish men now seem more interested in
food than football -- an undeniable progress of a sort -- but confess to
barely being able to boil an egg (which would pack too much cholesterol
anyway). Hot chocolate and so to bed to dream of Harry Ramsden's or deep
fried pizza.

I DON'T remember eating courgettes as a child. My earliest
recollections of courgettes was when, in my mid-teen years, my mother
started to grow them on our return from living in Rome.
The very mention of the word ''courgette'' brings to my mind the
vision of the interior of our airing cupboard, with the shelves full not
of ironed clothes in neat piles, but of rows of tiny pots containing
germinating courgettes.
As my mother is never happier than when she is in her garden, where
everything seems to grow for her with minimum trouble and in
proliferation (unlike me -- I can't even grow mint, a plant which takes
over most people's gardens), we were soon inundated with courgettes. Our
daily diet included courgettes at least once.
My mother, who is an extremely good cook, soon had to become inventive
in her quest for uses for this abundance of courgettes. Inded, a number
of recipes we use with courgettes now in the kitchen here at Kinloch
originated in my mother's kitchen.
These days you don't have to grow your own courgettes. They are widely
and plentifully available to us all, but they do vary so much in quality
and size. I avoid the large and yellowing courgettes, preferring
courgettes as small as possible and vividly green. They should be firm
of texture, too -- if they feel at all flabby, move on!
If you do grow your own, you will have the large, pale orange flowers
which are delicious dipped into batter and deep fried. If you pick the
courgettes when they are finger small, you can dip the whole thing,
courgette and flower, into batter and deep fry the lot. If you don't
want to make a batter, just dip the vegetable into first flour then
beaten egg -- I realise this sounds the wrong way round, but I assure
you it isn't, very lightly dampen the vegetable first -- then deep fry
them.
My favourite way of serving courgettes as a vegetable accompaniment is
to slice them into the thinnest strips -- this is only possible done on
a mandolin -- then shallow fry them in good olive oil with very finely
chopped garlic, salt and pepper. They take a very brief time to cook,
providing you cook them in wide saute pan -- only about one minute for
courgettes for six. We started to cook courgettes like this several
years ago, and call them Spaghetti Courgettes on the menu. They go so
well with meat, chicken and fish of all types.
The one way not to cook courgettes is in water. They contain so much
water themselves, and simmering them in water renders them water-logged
and most unpleasant in texture -- you get a squelch as you bite a piece.
Courgettes are best of all sauteed, I think. They are an ideal part of a
stir-fried vegetable mixture. They are so versatile in that they go very
well with a number of other vegetables and flavours. They make most
delicious cool summer soups, combined with lime, or with mint, or with
dill, whichever you prefer, but with all three a really good stock
(chicken, for my taste) is essential.
Courgettes go extremely well with mushrooms, and just as well with
tomato and garlic, as in the recipe today for Courgettes a la Grecque.
If you cook them with mushrooms the best way is to saute the chopped or
strips of courgette until they are as cooked as you like -- in olive oil
-- then remove them from the saute pan and cook the sliced mushrooms
till they are almost crisp, which greatly improves their flavour.
Replace the courgettes in the saute pan and stir in soya sauce and
double cream; season well with pepper -- no need for more salt, the soya
sauce will be sufficiently salty for most tastes -- and simmer the
contents of the pan gently for 2-3 minutes before serving.
Courgettes cooked like this can be a first course, or they can be a
more elaborate vegetable accompaniment to dress up a simple main course
such as grilled steak, chops or chicken.
Courgettes belong in ratatouille, that delicious stew of vegetables
which has been brought down in its image by the purveyors of fast foods
who manage to render their version of ratatouille revolting. I think
there are two reasons for this -- they undercook the chunks of
aubergine, and overcook the tomatoes they will include with their other
ingredients. I have always understood that tomatoes shouldn't be found
in a correctly made ratatouille, just onions, garlic, peppers,
courgettes and aubergines. It is certainly much nicer made like this,
without tomatoes, even though I love tomatoes. But more about them in a
few weeks' time!
If you do serve courgettes as a first course, either in the mushroom
soya sauce and cream recipe, or a la Grecque, be sure to have warm
bread, white, brown or granary to accompany it.
COURGETTES A LA GRECQUE
Serves 6
This is good served hot or cold.
5 tablespoons olive oil -- extra virgin if possible
2 large onions, red onions if possible, skinned and sliced very thinly
8-10 small courgettes
1 large juicy clove of garlic (leave it out if you prefer)
1 lb tomatoes
salt, freshly ground black pepper, torn up basil leaves
Chop the ends off the courgettes, wipe them and slice them about
[1/2]cm thick. Skin the tomatoes, cut each in half and scoop out the
seeds. Slice each half into thin strips. Skin and chop the garlic
finely.
Heat the oil in a heavy saute pan and cook the onions over a moderate
heat until they are really soft -- about five minutes, stirring from
time to time. Add the courgettes, and cook until they are soft, stir in
the sliced tomatoes and the chopped garlic and cook for a further few
minutes.
Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the torn-up basil leaves just
before you serve, or, if it is to be served cold, when it is cool.

DEPEND upon it, Sir; most marriages would be as happy or happier if
they were made by the Lord Chancellor without reference to the parties
involved -- Dr Johnson.
They say for every boy and girl/ There's just one love in this whole
world/ And I've found mine . . . -- Pat Boone, Young Love.
NOW there's a heavyweight philosophical boxing match for you, ladies
and gentlemen. In the blue corner: Dictionary Sam, the Lichfield Lion.
In the other blue corner: Polite Pat, the Chastity Kid. Are our loves
written in the stars? Were they meant to be? Or would anyone of the
preferred gender and ordinary number of heads have done at a pinch?
The side of this battle to which you, as referee, would give the duke
will at least partly determine how much you enjoy veteran Hollywood
journeyman Norman Jewison's daffy romantic comedy Only You (rental, cert
PG), whose central conceit is that dippy young heroine Faith Corvatch
(Marisa Tomei) who has known since she was 11 the name of the man she
was destined to marry: Damon Bradley.
How does she know? A ouija board told her so. Then three years later a
gipsy fortune teller -- spooky! -- confirmed her fate. But she got tired
of waiting for Dame to turn up, and 11 years later finds herself engaged
to a pediatrist called Dwayne with all the romantic charm of the feet to
which he ministers. Then fate steps in with the revelation that Dwayne
has an old chum called . . . well, what do you think, readers?
Rumpelstiltskin?
Only he's on his way to Venice at the time, so Faith has to rush away
from her wedding-dress fitting with her wedding dress still half-fitted
-- as one does -- and hop the first plane to Venice in search of the Man
of Destiny. A screwball-comedy chase around Venice and Rome follows
before a chance meeting and a lost shoe -- the subtlety of the symbolism
is simply killing -- throws her into the arms of the real Damon Bradley
(Robert Downey Jr).
But is he really? And if not, who is? And does it matter much anyway?
The point is, it was meant to be. You might reckon it's all a shade
tough on old Dwayne, left back home with the feet, but something tells
Couch Potato he's going to be all right too.
Everyone's going to be all right, in fact -- which, after all, is the
difference between cinema and life. If the latter is getting you down a
tad these days, this frothy and foolish feelgood movie could be just the
break you need.
Couch Potato's recollection from his Saturday matinee years is that
the two movie spin-offs from the Dr Who TV series -- Dr Who And The
Daleks (1965) and Daleks -- Invasion Earth 2150AD (1966) -- were rather
a disappointment at the time. They were so unfrightening compared to the
original -- and who was this Peter Cushing bloke, anyway?
The combination of middle-aged nostalgia and the post-modernist
aesthetic, however, makes Dalekmania (Lumiere, retail, #10.99) quite a
wistful experience. Clips from the original movies, interviews with such
members of the casts as survive, snippets from the unfinished third film
in the series, the utterly bizarre movie trailers, and a memory-jogging
exhibition of Dalek toys and memorabilia left us feeling as though we'd
just blown a month's pocket money at once on TV21 comics (anyone else
remember TV21?), Fry's Turkish Delight, and Orange Mivvis. Sad, really,
but that's the way we are. Couch Potato wears his anorak with pride.

Summer was casual about his affections, but became serious at the
wrong time, writes Macella Evaristi.
SUMMER -- that beautiful boy on the balcony -- was eager for the
season to begin. He looked down, pleasantly aware of his own eyelids,
and surveyed some white-fleshed ones who had newly alighted on his
territory.
Spring has long given up hope of him and had finally sought
consolation (at the same time gaining a solid engagement ring) with a
nice man who had taken her off to a temperate suburb and cooled her down
with faithful kisses and calamine lotion.
Spring now had a part-time job as an agony aunt -- her pseudonym was
Pollyanna Petal -- and she would never agonise again. Twice a week she
gave good advice to the lovelorn, who mostly ignored her suggestions,
then she would go rushing home to marinade her security.
Summer groaned a bit at the thought of her, but his erection had as
much to do with the shape of his own bare forearm with its elbow
bracelet of rolled cotton shirt, his inhalation of garlicky fish smells
coming from the windows on all sides of him, and the sight of the
hillside neon lights switching on to the evening as . . . as it was to
do with . . . but he had forgotten her name already.
He sipped his cassis which immediately darkened into dense red wine,
for his mouth was a miracle he rolled his tongue around. Across the
street the fruitmongers and their assistants were pulling inside the
boxes and trestles which all day had stood offering themselves to
customers and flies: a few perfect nectarines bumped to the pavement and
rolled away into the mulch of trodden grapes and marrow pulp. The owner
cursed at the profit loss and Summer grinned: immediately behind his
white teeth saliva gathered in a little pool.
He decided to take a walk before dinner. When he stepped out, a young
couple stood at the gates before him. They were 17, pretty as foals, and
clasping hands: the boy was saying something to make the girl laugh and
she raised the back of her free hand to make herself stop. The boy
insisted on continuing the story, but as Summer walked past quite
unseen, the boy dropped the girl's hand and wrapped his arm around her
waist, then she took her hand from her lips and placed it first on his
shoulder, then on his neck.
They stopped laughing, Summer whistled softly, and night fell.
In the cafe, although he had been completely entranced by his own
whistling, he now wanted to be served up some melody instead so he
snapped his fingers for some music.
There should have been a huge cacophony but no -- the old poet behind
his newspaper only heard Satie which brought him back to one crazy July
in war time Europe: a once-hippie barrister tapped his feet to a song
called Let's Go To San Francisco, and a sadly peeling manic depressive
hummed the De Profundis which he associated with all four seasons of the
year.
Inside the restaurant, Summer's first words to her were ''is anyone
sitting here'' which was rather banal, as Summer knew. But for him the
supreme cliche involved any reference to other seasons. Christmas
carols, for instance, made his brown skin pale with disdain while the
''Seasons of mist and mellow fruitfulness'' made him laugh out loud and
then spout aliterative crudities for hours.
''Is anyone sitting here?'' he said to her again. She had freckles he
intended to join up personally. Summer did tend to chat up rather lazily
because such was the power of his eyes, presence, lustre and natural
aftershave that, really, poetry would have been a waste of bed space.
Besides, the shape of his lips did strange things to his sentences:
their beauty made a physical translation of everything he said. Sort of
moronic into Mallarme.
Usually. But not this time. Automatically undaunted he repeated the
same question once again. She looked at him and lay down her book.
''I'm eating alone,'' she said flatly, ''which is what I want to do.
Thank you if you were being concerned for me, less thanks if you thought
. . . there are plenty of free tables. Goodnight.''
Summer smiled and thought ''how delicious, there she is at last. A
game for the season, munching independently stabbing at her frites''.
She looked away and giggled at something in her book, the title of
which he couldn't see. ''Of course,'' he replied. ''I only wondered. And
because I know there is nothing worse than eating while praying those
unwanted stares from the other side of the room have stopped -- I'll go
somewhere else.''
And with that he left. When he was back on the street he peeped
through the window at her and she was smiling. Summer, of course,
couldn't tell if it was anything to do with him. He went for a swim then
wandered home. He was in bed before he remembered the neon lights but he
couldn't be bothered getting up. Now this was an extraordinary evening
for him, the Seigneur of Sensuality -- how he laughed at the thought of
saving himself for her, or anybody, or anything.
In June she did allow him her company but not in the way he had
expected. When he raced her to the boat, a ploy which had never before
failed because of the body angle he used to lift himself onboard, she
teased him like a little brother. She swam towards him, not competing,
and appraised his ascent coolly. Her black hair floated behind her like
some chic oil slick and she called out laughing ''what are you like?''
Her name was Antonia but though he invented some name for himself, she
never used it. Quite soon he'd forgotten it himself.
With the concentration of a determined cad, he stripped himself of
anything which might have been construed as gigolo behaviour.
He peeled her grapes from his finest vineyard (she giggled) and he
commanded the swallows to surround their picnics like halos. Summer set
up scenarios which would make the most convinced celibate turn heavy as
Dionysus and melt like mozzarella. At the same time all besotted and
gauche-sounding he said his girlfriend Polly had run off with a barmaid.
She kissed him on the cheek.
My this is fun, he thought unsurely.
In July they danced, the sun had made strange burnished streaks in her
dark hair but when he brushed his cheek against her head, her hand kept
his hips from pressing too firmly against her own.
Other couples moving to the music while watching them gradually
disappeared: down to the sea's edge or into the darkest corners of the
piazza or hand-in-hand into a hotel.
Summer's appearance had changed. It was as if Antonia, by kissing the
side of his amazing face, had hollowed his cheek and heightened his
bones. Like a beach boy returned from military service, his shoulders
had broadened. Summer looked more delineated and determined: his
silhouette had somehow come into its own.
The game had become a serious challenge.
No one could remember a July like this: people declared it unbearable,
but although siestas lengthened, nobody left. Summer was doing his
magician stuff: he was hypnotising this world.
Businessmen took to writing home to their bosses, conglomerates and
companies, to say that they were not coming back. The Financial Times
tanned from pink to sepia.
Moguls opened small, dark unprofitable bars, padding around in flip
flops, reading Asterix.
Everyone discovered the deepest secrets of his pal in the adjacent
deckchair: no postcards were sent anymore, no-one could remember the
names of their neighbours back home, and anyway the stamps melted in
their own glue and slithered down over wrongly-guessed addresses.
Summer surveyed all this and put his hand around Antonia's waist, her
hand felt for the nape of his neck.
By August he had kissed her 13 times and she no longer mocked him when
he curved his knife around a white peach and sliced the crescents into
her glass.
A teenage girl watching him remarked aloud, ''my what a distinguished
handsome man'', but he didn't hear her. He had fallen in love, and
standing on the balcony with Antonia he told her the truth of his
identity. She listened and smiled at him, and stroked the fine sheen of
silver on his thick hair. ''I am Summer, Antonia.''
''Autumn'', she said.
''No -- look out there! How can you doubt it?''
''I meant I am Autumn. Have to go.''
So he took her hand and walked her to the edge of the shore, kissed
her face and bright auburn hair and said goodbye.
Waiting on his bed for him was her book: a brand new edition of Keats.

A NEW CD release from Ronnie Scott's Jazz House label has stirred some
memories for me -- and no doubt for others who were fortunate enough to
hear the great Ben Webster on his frequent London visits in the sixties.
The tenor saxophonist crossed the Atlantic for the first time in l964
and the following year he settled into a permanent European base, first
in Amsterdam and then in Copenhagen.
The album, recorded live at Ronnie Scott's was made around the same
time as I first encountered Webster in less than happy circumstances.
In contrast to the tender way he caresses a ballad, Ben was often a
roaring, roistering, partying man whose excesses were often caused by a
fair amount of Four Roses, his favourite bourbon.
It was at Ronnie's that I went to see Ben Webster for the first time.
Except that Webster was in no condition to play. He had obviously been
drinking during the day, probably with his friend Turner.
The night was rescued by the impromptu appearance of Turner. Webster
fell upon his old buddy and I can still remember as he dragged Big Joe
on to the tiny bandstand the singer murmuring: ''The blind leadin' the
blind, a world of trouble.''
It wasn't, of course. Turner sang superbly with the rhythm section as
Ben sat at a table shouting for encore after encore.
Later I was to hear Webster play often, lavishing all his feelings
into the songs which became indelibly connected with him. And, once, I
saw the other side of Benjamin Francis Webster, the polite, quiet man
who lived in Amsterdam between gigs which were scattered across the
Continent.
By this time he had fallen into a pattern of coming to London where
Henry, the doorman-cum-bouncer at Ronnie's would look after him, keep
him out of trouble, and get him to his gigs on time. When I was going to
Amsterdam it was Henry who suggested I call Ben and who also told me to
arrive at his apartment with a bottle of Four Roses.
Typically the morning was spent listening to Ben's tapes, not of other
tenor players, not of any other saxophonists at all, but to piano
players. Stride piano players.
Webster liked to mess around on piano himself and he had his idols --
Willie ''The Lion'' Smith, James P Johnson, Fats Waller, Donald Lambert,
and Art Tatum among them.
He listened to them constantly and while he did so he would talk of
his early days in New York, and the first time he met The Lion.
''I was just a kid,'' he would grin, ''and I went up to the Rhythm
Club in Harlem where Willie and the other piano players would be.
Sometimes James P would be there or Fats. And there were others, Donald
Lambert would sometimes arrive and then he would disappear back to New
Jersey where he lived. Or we would hear Willie Gant or Stephan ''The
Beetle'' Henderson.''
The new CD -- and there is another recent release on Storyville which
finds Webster in tandem with Buck Clayton and a European rhythm section
-- is a typical in-person performance from the man who was the first
tenor saxophonist to be featured in the Duke Ellington Orchestra.
There are three numbers from Duke, In A Mellotone, C Jam Blues and
Perdido, some of the ballads which were staples in his repertoire in his
European days -- Over The Rainbow and My Romance are lovingly handled
with that lush massive tone heard at its best.
Oh, and to round things off there is a short interview with Ben when
you can hear those soft Mid West tones praise his British associates and
tell how even then, at the height of his powers, he was still ready to
listen to the younger men coming up.
Fortunately some of them listened to Webster which is why we can hear
echoes of him in Scott Hamilton's ballad playing today . . .

Heather Reid, BBC Meteorologist, tells ANN DONALD about her reading
matter.
* BELIEVE it or not I've just finished reading a weather book called
Scotland's Weather which was compiled and edited by Andrew Martin. And
it was really very good. It's an anthology of various texts about
Scottish weather -- so most of it is people like Burns, Shakespeare and
even Queen Victoria waxing lyrical about storms and snow in Scotland.
I like historical books, especially those that concentrate on the two
world wars or the Russian Revolution. I've just read Hatred and Contempt
by Peter Rawlinson. It's a courtroom drama centring around a guy who
fought for the Yugoslav army during the Second World War. But it also
brings in historical things -- the internal struggles between the
Royalists and the Communists and the rise of Tito.
I started reading Chaos by James Gleich because the first few chapters
are all about weather and weather systems being chaotic. I've got a
degree in Physics and I studied a fair bit of mathematics -- but I got a
bit stuck halfway through because it tended to get a bit intense on the
maths side. Every now and then when I'm feeling intellectual I'll read a
chapter.
I have also just a read Newtonian Casino by Thomas Bass which was all
about gambling and whether you can actually predict winning
combinations. Despite the heavy computer speak and maths I found it to
be a very entertaining book.

MAPPLETHORPE: A BIOGRAPHY by Patricia Morrisroe. Macmillan, #20 .
THERE are two informed views of photography. One, it is a fine art as
imaginative as painting. The other, it is a boring matter of pressing
the right buttons -- Larkin described it as ''disappointing''. Robert
Mapplethorpe appeared to press all the wrong buttons as a drug addict
and homosexual who suffered from Aids but he was widely regarded as the
finest and flashiest studio photographer of his time (1946-1989).
A mate of Andy Warhol, Mapplethorpe was infamous for the 15 odd
minutes it took him to shoot the ''X Portfolio'' for The Perfect Moment
exhibition that caused so much controversy in the US. These 13 studies
of sadomasochistic men were condemned as repulsively crude by some
senators and acclaimed as pleasingly rude by some art buffs. Ironically,
Mapplethorpe was too sick to attend the opening of The Perfect Moment at
the end of 1988 so could not fully enjoy his fame -- or fortune
($500,000 worth of photographs sold in one month) -- and we learn from
Patricia Morrisroe's biography that ''Mapplethorpe equated publicity
with life itself''.
Life itself was a bizarre adventure for Mapplethorpe who told
Morrisroe, in one of 16 interviews, he was ''a sex demon''. Brought up
in Floral Park, Queens, Mapplethorpe was dominated by his engineering
father and disturbed by his religiously houseproud mother. He was also
dominated and disturbed by his Catholic faith as a friend recalled:
''Robert . . . seemed to believe in all that devil stuff''.
He was a young devil in his own way or so he said. As a teenager he
became obsessed by pornography but was too young to buy the sealed
magazines he saw on the news-stands. So he stole a gay magazine from a
blind newsdealer, or so he said. And the newsdealer, so Morrisroe says,
threatened to report him to the cops when he returned to steal another
gay magazine: ''He couldn't imagine what would have happened to him if
the police had called his father with the news that his son had been
arrested for stealing gay pornography. He vowed to end his flirtation
with homosexuality.'' That sounds like a likely story and not just
because it rather too neatly links pornography with photography.
I mean, whoever saw a blind newsdealer? How did the man know what he
sold or what Mapplethorpe stole from him? Morrisroe does not ask these
questions but believes Mapplethorpe always told the truth. She first met
him in 1983 and eagerly agreed to write his biography. She decided he
was ''extremely candid about things most people keep secret''. But
Mapplethorpe was not most people. He was, by her own admission, addicted
to publicity and I suspect he never let the truth get in the way of a
good story.
Or bad story. Like the one about his pet monkey Scratch: ''Of all the
stories connected to a photographer, the monkey saga remains one of the
strangest''. As a student at Pratt Institute, so the story goes,
Mapplethorpe shared a studio with Scratch but neglected to feed him.
Scratch died of starvation but Mapplethorpe immortalised him in a
project for his Nature Structure class: ''Mapplethorpe had beheaded
Scratch with a kitchen knife, and after boiling away the flesh, he
transformed the skull into a musical instrument of such beauty that it
was one of the few times at Pratt that he received an A for his work.''
If Mapplethorpe really did starve an animal to death he was worse than
an animal. If he invented the saga of starvation then he made a monkey
of all who believed him.
Many prats at Pratt believed Mapplethorpe had decapitated the monkey
while it was still alive while others believed he had eaten the animal's
flesh in a voodoo cult ritual. Mapplethorpe encouraged the rumours in an
early effort to make an ugly exhibition of himself. He wanted to appear
as a monster and did his worst to offend others. He went to live in what
another described as a ''psychedelic Animal House''. He apparently
killed cockroaches with relish: ''Visitors recalled seeing bugs impaled
on safety pins and dangling from tiny nooses made of dental floss''. But
the visitors were all drugged out of their minds so could have been
seeing things. Such as bugs impaled on safety pins.
Mapplethorpe first started doing drugs seriously in 1966 when his
personal life became a nightmare on a daily basis. He took LSD,
marijuana, amphetamines, Quaaludes, MDA, cocaine, and amyl nitrate. He
was convinced drugs enchanced his creativity and would never take a
photograph without first getting stoned. This much we can believe from
the evidence of his art which is nothing if not nightmarish for all its
superficial compositional clarity. On the evidence of his life he based
this clarity on confusion.
Gay as the day was long, Mapplethorpe's most positive relationship was
with Patti Smith, the female rock singer he met in 1967. She too was
confused. Confused about her sexual identity as she proved in a poem she
confusingly called ''Female''. It goes like this: ''female. feel male.
Ever since I felt the need to/choose I'd choose male. I felt boy rythums
when I/was in knee pants . . . Every feminine gesture I affected from my
mother/humiliated me.'' Mapplethorpe could connect with another oddball.
He even told his parents he was married but though his mother believed
him, his old man knew better.
His most negative relationship was with Sam Wagstaff, an art collector
searching for ''someone to spoil''. After Wagstaff died -- officially of
pneumonia but allegedly of Aids -- Mapplethorpe went on a rampage,
insulting and abusing black men (Wagstaff was white). ''Mapplethorpe,''
writes Morrisroe, ''blamed a black man for infecting him with the Aids
virus, but given his boast of having had sex with an estimated thousand
men, he couldn't possibly know for sure''.
All we can know for sure is that Mapplethorpe trivialised his talent
and that Morrisroe takes him too seriously as ''a master''. He was
technically a fine photographer but aesthetically his work leaves a lot
to be desired.

The Black Book by Orhan Pamuk. Translated by Guneli Gun. Faber,
#14.99.
ON the face of it, The Black Book is a thriller, a mystery novel with
a search at the centre, a book about something loved and lost; and
though these elements are present, it is as difficult to summarise as it
is to classify.
It is filled with mysteries, the sort of book that defies
categorisation; a book that uses one genre as a springboard into
another, that mingles ideas and styles in a wholly original way, making
it easy to slip through the web of publishers, publicists, reviewers,
and readers. In places it effects the same device of cyclical unfinished
storytelling as the Arabian Nights used invention as a source of
discovery and leaves evidence of its inquiries on every page.
Galip is a lawyer who lives and works in Istanbul. He comes home to
find his wife is missing. Ruya's 19-word note gives no indication as to
where or why she has gone. His cousin, Jelal, Ruya's half-brother, is
also missing. He is a journalist whose unsigned newspaper columns are
widely read.
At first Galip does pretty much which the genre demands. He puts his
life on hold and lies to his family. Being convinced the pair are
together, he walks around, visits friends, and generally tries to elicit
information without becoming alarmist. He tells his family Ruya is
unwell, then says she's on holiday; in the meantime, he studies Jelal's
columns for clues.
The columns are reproduced in alternate chapters, acting as coda to
what has gone before, and a trailer for what is to come, immersing us in
Galip's quest while offering beautiful evocations and atmospheric cameos
of Istanbul. A couple of these pieces are beautifully crafted short
stories.
The first is prompted by a news item that the water level of the
Bosporus is falling, turning it into ''a pitch-black swamp in which the
mud-caked skeletons of galleons will gleam like the luminous teeth of
ghosts''. Jelal imagines the accumulated rubbish of previous
civilisations being eventually exposed on the seabed.
In one of these columns, a barber asks, ''Do you have any trouble
being yourself?'' This becomes the book's main concern, forcing Galip to
recognise that he is simply imitating the protagonist in a detective
story, which is his wife's favourite fiction. Earlier, he suggests that
''. . . the only detective novel worth reading would be one in which the
writer himself didn't know the identity of the murderer''.
All along small secrets have been shared, details planted as clues,
some of great significance, others simply to authenticate the
surroundings, or give atmosphere. Not only does this tie the novel to
Istanbul, giving it both a wonderful sense of place and atmosphere, but
subtly exposes and explores the city's cultural and historical dual
identity, both Eastern and Western, Muslim and Christian, a place at the
crossroads.
Galip pursues the couple to Jelal's empty flat. By living there,
wearing Jelal's clothes, and reading his correspondence, his own
identity is undermined. When Jelal's editor becomes impatient for copy,
Galip obliges. With everything in doubt, he comes to believe in a theory
of parallel universes and is drawn to a mystical belief that faces are
comprised of signs and letters which can be read.
In the first chapter we've been told Ruya's name means ''dream'',
Galip is ''Victor'' and Jelal means ''Fury'', a simple device that
indicates the threat of collapse existed before Ruya disappeared.
Finally, Pamuk intervenes as author, addressing the reader directly as
darkness falls. This follows Jelal's final piece, the story of Prince
Osman Jelalettin who struggled to be himself throughout his life. Pamuk
offers a range of possibilities, plausible scenarios of death and
collapse, turning the mystery novel on its head, making it as much a
source of investigation as entertainment.

PRINCE EDWARD: A BIOGRAPHY by Ingrid Seward. Century. Hardback,
#16.99.
INGRID SEWARD, wife of a prominent gossip columnist and for 11 years
editor of a magazine called Majesty, is the author of various books on
the House of Windsor. Yet such titles as Diana: Portrait of a Princess
and Royal Children of the Twentieth Century scarcely suggest a writer of
substance. And it is hard to see why the Queen's youngest child, barely
30 years old and unremarkable save for his maternity, justifies a whole
book. King George V's fourth son George, father of the present Duke of
Kent -- he died in a wartime air-crash in Sutherland -- was a much more
interesting fellow, but has yet to find a biographer at all.
Close examination of this vacuous volume bears out the impression.
Despite its weighty feel, you quickly notice the large print, the broad
margins, the thick paper. And the text, on reading, is desperately
padded. Much chronicling of the Prince of Wales is pillaged for pages on
Gordonstoun and Cambridge. The book is infuriatingly perverse in
chronology, with few major incidents or career-steps being narrated in
sequence. Excerpts from the subject's very dull speeches eke out the
wordage.
Prince Edward Anthony Richard Louis has four name claims to interest.
He is the youngest child of the Sovereign. He is her only child to
remain unmarried and, as a result has often (and unjustly) been deemed
homosexual. He originated in the memorably awful It's a Royal Knockout
fiasco of 1987, which raised a million pounds for charity, but made
fools of the younger royals in the process and ended in Edward scrapping
with reporters. And, dramatically repudiating a planned military career,
he has devoted his talents to the entertainment industry.
For those with an interest in this sort of thing, the book is not
without intimate detail. It is, after all, based on several interviews
with the subject and appears to emerge with his blessing. The Prince
appeared as Mole in Toad of Toad Hall in a preparatory school play in
1975, and Seward reproduces very bad colour photographs. He lost his
virginity to a Balmoral housemaid in 1982, but no photographs were taken
on this occasion. He despises the Duchess of York and the Princess of
Wales, and a whole chapter is devoted to demolition of their character.
Prince Edward loves the theatre. He has rather a temper. He is patron
of some 20 organisations, including the Scottish Badminton Union and
Haddo House Hall Arts Trust, Aberdeen. His relationship with Sophie
Rhys-Jones has survived, despite intensive press interest, and the
couple openly cohabit, even in his various royal apartments. They have
no immediate plans for marriage and, accordingly, there is no prospect
of Edward's elevation to a dukedom. In any event, he prefers to be known
as plain Edward Windsor. His family are rich and dysfunctional. They
communicate by memo, even when they are under the same roof, and have
many quaint habits. They are often appallingly rude to weekend guests
and delight in practical jokes.
If books of this kind are to be done at all, they should be accurate;
this volume contains elementary errors of fact. Edward Windsor may have
taken a Christian name from his first cousin, but Richard was not in
1964 Duke of Gloucester; his father Henry was, and had still a decade to
live. Edward is ''not the first son of a reigning monarch in all of
British history'' to take a job outside the services. The last Duke of
Kent, more than 60 years ago, worked in the Foreign Office as a civil
servant. And there is no such place as ''Ballanter'', even in the toy
Highlands of Deeside.
Despite yourself you come to have a certain affection for the subject.
He learned much from the ''Knockout'' fiasco, and did not repeat the
mistake. Prince Edward's decision to quit the Royal Marines, after only
a few months of vicious training, showed reserves of moral courage not
notable in the Windsor line. (His mother and grandmother were furious;
his father, remarkably, was most supportive.) Edward can laugh at
himself. When news of his employment at the Really Useful Theatre
Company was mocked in the tabloids in such headlines as ''Royal
Teaboy'', the Prince turned up for his first working day solemnly
clutching a box of Brooke Bond.
Edward emerges from this book with a certain dignity: a man of
determined independence, eager to stand on his own merits. Ingrid
Seward, by contrast, tries to blend her creepy-Crawfie banalities with
much prurient tittle-tattle. Dimbleby she ain't, and books of this sort
but prove that the market for royal marshmallow is, for truth, in
advanced recession.

WHIT by Iain Banks. Little Brown, #15.99
IAIN Banks knows what it is to be a chosen one. In 1983 his first
novel The Wasp Factory was evidently plucked from a publisher's reject
pile by an editor looking for something to read. The notoriety it
attracted established Banks as one of the most succcessful novelists of
his generation. At the same time this industrious Scottish writer who is
based in Fife produces admired science fiction under the name Iain S
Banks.
In Whit, his new novel, Isis, the teenage narrator, is the one chosen
to succeed her grandfather Salvador as leader of a sect installed in a
mansion house called High Easter Offerance ''in a loop of the river
Forth a number of miles upstream from the town of Stirling''. The
blessed Isis is given a task: to go out into the world and persuade her
cousin Morag to come to the four-yearly Festival of Love as guest of
honour.
This story, which is set in 1995, sounds like science fiction, except
that Isis doesn't travel by spacecraft. In her quest for Morag she spins
down the river Forth in the inner tube of a tyre, using a trenching tool
as a paddle. In her kitbag she carries a hallowed cream belonging to the
community, and a copy of Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress.
Does Banks intend us to read Whit as an allegory, the tale of an
innocent young woman, unfamiliar with television and drugs, who faces
corruption in our modern world through exposure to videos and reefers in
her quest for cousin Morag, believed to be a gifted musician, but who is
known as Fusillada DeBauch the porn queen?
Whit (subtitled Isis among the Unshaved, a take-off of Blavatsky's
Isis Unveiled, the occult work by the discredited sect leader who
influenced Yeats, among many others) is a satire on the bizarre sects of
the late twentieth century.
The Scottish sect in Banks's novel was established by a man washed
ashore at Luskentyre on the island of Harris in a storm in September
1948, where two Gaelic-speaking Asian female traders in an old van
brought the human flotsam back to life by covering him with lard and
tea.
He slept with both of them simultaneously and founded a sect, calling
himself His Holiness the Blessed Salvador-Uranos Odin etc of Luskentyre,
moving his community to the mainland, where he receives supplicants on
six double beds pushed together in the mansion above the Forth.
Central to the story is the forthcoming carnal Festival of Love, where
Isis, who is her grandfather's heir-elect as head of the sect, expects
to be deflowered and probably become pregant, so that the sect can have
future members.
This entertaining novel abounds in jokes, including the culinary
treats of black pudding bhaji and saag crowdie paneer. But Banks has a
serious purpose in scrutinising the hypocrisy of such a sect, with the
old lecher Salvador trying to seduce his granddaughter Isis, and Morag
the porn queen turning out to be a good sport in another way.
There are echoes of the abuse and double dealing of the Waco tragedy
in Whit, a timely reminder of the damage that such sects can perpetrate
while being tolerated as eccentric.
Whit is a Pilgrim's Progress in reverse. The world which Isis races
through in the company of many crazy characters, including her granny in
cowboy boots, is seen to be stable; it's the sect that's out of step.
The hallowed cream turns out to be Sloan's Linament, and it's discovered
that the Blessed Salvador had another life before he assumed the white
robes and the right to deflower.
I will not spoil the reader's enjoyment of this story by revealing the
ending, but Isis certainly receives an education in the outside world.
What's going to happen in the mansion above the loop of the Forth?
Perhaps Banks will give us a sequel.

Images of Glasgow. Compiled by Robert Jeffrey and Ian Watson. Breedon
Books, #12.99.
A WEE difficulty with any book about the Second City is what to call
the damned thing, and they usually end up with boring catch-alls. My
last book was titled City of Glasgow. I wanted to name it ''As Everyone
Here Can See'' after the line in Will Fyfe's song but the publishers
thought the title too obscure.
It is generally publishers who are obscure and not writers. There is
in fact only one writer in this latest photofest about the Dear Green
thingmy. Images of Glasgow is compiled by Robert Jeffrey and Ian Watson,
culled from the photo libraries of The Herald and Evening Times, and
part sponsored by them.
The intro is by fellow scribe Jack Webster, a North-east man from Maud
who has spent most of his lifetime in a splendid, if douce, little
suburb on the outskirts of this grimy city, Netherlee. Webster
introduces some of the history. What he can't do -- and who could? -- is
portray Glasgow as pictures can, for if ever there was a city and a
culture which needs described in pictures it is this strange mixture of
Lilliput and Brobdingnag. Describing Glasgow in words is a bit like
trying to explain a spiral staircase without using your hands. So
pictures will have to do it.
And this book is pictures, in black and white, the way Glasgow should
be seen. They date from very early days right up until now. Frankly, in
much the same way that I find it hard to really bother about Bosnia and
far-off lands, the foreign land of before the Great War and the pictures
of my city of that time rather bore me. The best bits are when I
remembered the best bits: when I was there. Some of it I have forgotten.
This book remembered me.
The photographs have been taken from the Outram photo archives (few
people know that, outside of the Radio Times/Hulton Picture library, The
Herald photograph archives are the best in Europe) and brought me back
to a childhood which I yet think of, not in rose colours, but in the
grim smog of 1950s austerity.
Here is a photograph of the Parly Road. I remember it well. I was
brought up in Townhead, the Parly Road, Dobbie's Loan, the fire-station
in Ingram Street. A photograph is there of the Cheapside Street whisky
warehouse fire when 19 firemen died fighting the fire. Most of them came
from the Ingram Street fire-station where the firemen and their families
lived. I knew every family and the sons and daughters had gone to school
with me. The photograph brought all that back. Crying in the Barony at
the funeral service, a hard time.
But cheery photos as well. Sometimes black and white is cheery after
all. The Locarno back in the days when girls had sticky-out dresses and
peep-toe heels and perfectly-seamed nylons and the boys dressed like
Jack Buchanan for the big scene starring Rita Hayworth. Glasgow ever had
notions of style above its station. Talking of stations, we have photos
of the massive crowds in St Enoch's where we went off to the Clyde
resorts, and the old Abbotsinch airport where you arrived by coach to
look at the Airies, the big silver birds. Ach, it brings it all back.
Most of it is good; some of it isn't. The ragged schoolchildren, 50 in
a class, the fetid reek of the back courts: don't ever let anybody tell
you how grand the old tenements were. They could have been, of course.
Since refurbishment of the remaining tenemental properties they are now.
But they weren't then: they were shite. And the ordure was heaped up in
the evil-smelling air-raid shelters and wash-houses. Don't listen to
fond memories from the aged.
All the same, talking of refurbished tenements. There is a today
photie in this book of my own property. You can even see my house. I
should be in this book myself, writing the foreword if it comes to that
too.
I've missed out so much of what this book has done to me, in bringing
back memories. The wonderfully atmospheric photograph of the Whiteinch
ferry brought back more of the bleakness of my youth than any movie
could. Leafing through the pages I started to remember my father with a
vividness I only find in my dreams and snatched at that.
The photographs go up until today of course but they go back to the
today of when my father must have been me as a child. It gets you like
that, this book. A pity there aren't more snaps, you think; a pity you
aren't there, back again. A sweet, sad, book. One of the subscribers to
this tome is called Jack Bookless. Well, he isn't now, or shouldn't be.
Neither should you be. Go get it.

* IT began as an exciting if not particularly daunting request. Cull
the picture files of The Herald and Evening Times for images of Glasgow
to be published in a glossy hardback in the run-up to the city's term as
UK City of Architecture and Design 1999.
The approach to the printer's deadline brought the dawning realisation
that to do the job properly would be more difficult than had first
seemed.
The Herald/Times archive held in Albion Street contains around six
million photographs. From this incredible hoard of history a selection
of around 400 was required.
Research into books of a similar nature showed many to be bland
collections of postcardish views of streets and buildings that had
fallen to bulldozers and developers.
Bland Glasgow is not. Along with Ian Watson, the information
technology specialist who looks after the archive, I decided that our
images of Glasgow would reflect the character, the humour, the
tragedies, the triumphs as well as the often beautiful and
underestimated fabric of this great European city.
Clydesiders at work in the yards and steelworks, nights at the
Dennistoun Palais de Danse, the Locarno, and the Albert, the great panto
stars and comedians, acclaimed drama in the Gorbals, bloodsoaked
victories in the boxing ring, triumphs in Europe for the old firm of
Rangers and Celtic, great liners and warships sailing into maritime
history and the Victorian magnificence of the city itself . . .
unforgettable images by the thousand fought for attention.
In the end what emerged is a sort of Glasgow family album created by
the skill and dedication of generations of staff photographers. An album
that any Clydesider can dip into again and again and find images that
pull at emotions and memories.
* Images of Glasgow will be published next week by Breedon Books at
#12.99. It is available in good bookshops, and also at The Herald
offices, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP -- or by post from the Reader
Offers Department at the same address, for #15.99 including post and
packing.

NAPOLEON AND JOSEPHINE: AN IMPROBABLE MARRIAGE
by Evangeline Bruce (Weidenfeld, #25)
THE subtitle gets it right. Why should a dour, ambitious, but as yet
almost penniless hitman for Paul Barras and the Directory in 1795 have
married a sexually promiscuous but impoverished Creole from Martinique,
six years his senior?
Partly because each was deceived about the character of the other.
Napoleon Bonaparte thought the 32-year-old Marie-Joseph-Rose Tascher de
la Pagerie (whom he immediately renamed Josephine) had money and was
aristocratic creme de la creme; Josephine thought Napoleon had money and
was the coming man.
Actually in a sense he was. In 1795 he was Barras's protege and Barras
appointed him commander in chief of the Army of Italy as a kind of
wedding present. He did this to get rid of his mistress Josephine, with
whom he was bored. Once Napoleon went to Italy in 1796 his career as
conqueror began and there was no looking back. But were the newly-weds
truly grateful to Barras? Not a bit of it. After his 18 Brumaire coup in
1799 Napoleon banished Barras from France.
Josephine was the sort of woman who would have been described in
pre-PC days as ''delightfully feminine''. A notorious grande horizontale
and spendthrift, she had lovers by the truckload before and after her
marriage to Bonaparte, including Napoleon's great rival General Hoche,
who died young. Her expenditure on clothes and other fripperies became
legendary. It need hardly be added that Josephine ran up bills
regardless of whether she had the money to pay them, and Evangeline
Bruce's pages are full of scenes in which an incredulous Napoleon
scrutinises astronomical bills from dressmakers and milliners. Usually,
after a violent tantrum, he would order the debt liquidated at once.
It was said of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers that he gave her class
and she gave him sex. Something of the same sort happened with Napoleon
and Josephine. Her hold on his affections was always primarily sexual.
He began by being a sexual obsessive but his ardour cooled when he
finally learned of her habitual infidelities. Josephine carried on a
torrid affair with an army captain called Hippolyte Charles virtually
from the moment she and Bonaparte married.
During most of the legendary 18 months of Napoleon's Italian campaign
in 1796-97, she and Charles were cohabiting, and they resumed the
arrangement when Napoleon was in Egypt during 1798-99. Finally
Napoleon's aide Androche Junot blurted out the truth, which everyone but
Napoleon already knew. An incredulous Bonaparte sought verification from
his other generals and implemented his own version of ''shoot the
messenger'': Junot was the only one of his close friends who was not
promoted to marshal in 1804.
Such was Josephine's sexual hold on Napoleon that she was able to
effect a reconciliation when the victorious general returned to France
in 1799. But the original spell was broken. Thenceforth Napoleon himself
took mistresses. He was no longer in love with Josephine but, until the
day he divorced her, he continued to be fond of her and to indulge her
spendthrift ways. The need to secure the imperial dynasty with an heir
which Josephine could not provide (though she had two children from a
previous marriage) led Napoleon in 1809 to divorce her in favour of the
Austrian princess Marie-Louise, who quickly produced the desired heir.
Sexual desire stalks Evangeline Bruce's pages. Both Napoleon's wives,
as well as his sister Pauline, were either nymphomaniacs or as close as
makes no difference. Yet this does not mean that Bruce's book is a
non-fictional bodice-ripper. In fact I had not expected it to be nearly
as good as it is. She has researched widely, in the French national
archives, in Poland and in the Swedish royal archives, and in so doing
sheds new light on a number of events on which it might have been
thought the last word had been said, for instance Napoleon's early
romance with Desiree Clary. The author takes a very sympathetic view of
Josephine but will not allow the benefit of any doubts to Napoleon. Her
black view of a demonic, unscrupulous tyrant recalls the famous portrait
by Taine.
Bruce writes extremely well and has a thorough grasp of Napoleonic
history which makes her volume one of the best of the recent avalanche
of books on one of the most intriguing men in history. If Bruce's
Napoleon is not entirely convincing, she certainly paints a most
persuasive picture of Josephine. The case for the hedonistic
animal-loving Creole empress has never been better put.

GILES RADICE: The New Germans (235pp. #16.50. Michael Joseph)
GILES Radice, the Labour MP, has certainly been bitten by some German
bug. This book is essentially conceived as a blast against the view of
certain Tories, the view that leopards never change their spots and that
beneath the almost soporific normality of the modern Federal Republic
demons still lurk.
Unlike Mrs Thatcher or the late Nicholas Ridley, Radice speaks with a
voice of sweet reason, matching the dulcet tones of the Germans he
consults and quotes. It is very much an official picture he presents,
the picture that might be built up from the Goethe-Institut, Inter
Nationes, and the inevitable Konigswinter conferences -- rather as if a
German were to write about us solely from listening to the BBC World
Service or to conversations at his local British Council's cocktail
parties.
In fact Radice shows remarkably little curiosity about anyone except
the great and good. It is not clear from his text whether he actually
speaks German, or is capable of talking to those not brought to talk to
him. He scarcely mentions the Bild-Zeitung, for example, the organ of
the German working man, a counterpart to the Sun just as remarkable for
its unashamed chauvinism (which still, I hasten to add, falls very far
short of anything that could be called Nazi). But it always used to
tickle me to probe Bild readers, such as taxi-drivers, and hear them say
the equivalent, auf deutsch, of ''Now that Mrs Thatcher, she's a woman I
admire . . .''
Nor does Radice even say much of Der Spiegel which, during the 30
years that I have been reading it, has adopted a consistently sneering
tone towards Britain for her supposedly effete decadence. The atmosphere
between the British and the Germans is still a little too disturbed for
us to be able to needle each other with quite the relish that the
British and the French do. But a certain amount of needle is all the
same there, and I have often asked myself why.
I cannot believe it is just a matter, as Radice claims, of some among
us failing to realise that not just one but two generations have grown
up since 1945, that nobody under the age of 60 can have the faintest
recollection of Hitler's regime. Of course these new Germans are
entirely democratic and peaceful in their outlook, probably more
democratic and peaceful than their British equivalents.
But when I am visited now by the children of German friends with whom
I went to university, I still find them, well, nice enough, but a bit
humourless, a bit intense, a bit dogmatic, a bit irrational, just as the
old Germans were, and a bit put out when they come up against a
different frame of mind. That is why I think Radice has written a
superficial book.

IN its coarse coloured-postcard way old Rothesay was up to the oxters
in thespians. But names with stardust on them failed to daze. Visiting
summer mummers and jesters were allowed to promenade along the prom as
they pleased. By day they were just folk. Only at night did they become
bright lights and big shots. Even then Bute naturalised them.
When Charlie Kemble, Davie Willis, Tommy Morgan, Robert Wilson -- even
May Moxon's dancing ladies -- appeared at the Winter Gardens, they took
on island guise. They appeared under the title of Rothesay Entertainers.
An even more exotic adopted incomer was Edmund Kean, leading player of
the British stage, Shakespearian hero, and soak.
How Kean sought conspicuous obscurity on Bute remains an isle secret.
Better than 150 years since he died, Rothesay respects his privacy
still. He stays a romantic spectre. His ghost is unexploited.
Yet in Edmund Kean on Bute lie the makings of an extraordinary and
gaudy pageant.
His debauched antics were at times too much for London to take. He
upset New York. Boston was not big enough for him. Yet Rothesay
accommodated him no bother. Islanders took him as they found him.
If their big-name visitor wanted to play the part of an eccentric
laird, it was fine by them. If they found some of his capers absurd, not
a word of them reached the mainland. His biographers -- all five of them
-- skimp his island years for lack of priapic titbits to work on. For
his neighbours held their tongues.
His ostentatious whims were put up with agreeably. Mr Kean paid his
bills. He provided jobs. His hospitality was generous.
Nor were his ways their ways. For instance, there was a wild Irish
woman whom he introduced as Mrs Kean, although he must have realised
that they all knew she was not his wife. They had met the real Mrs Kean.
She had spent a whole summer among them. And despite the wretched abuse
that Mary Kean spread about her wandering husband, Bute declined to take
sides.
It enjoyed the excitement -- and perhaps the glamour -- that he
imported to the island. With fireworks nights and big dinner parties he
brought carnival and fun. Any history of Scotland's holiday business
would have to give him a more profound and pioneering role, even a
significant one. Really he was Rothesay's first tourist.
He made an unlikely seaside holidaymaker. Like Lord Attenborough, a
more recent island incomer, he had international stardom. He bestrode
the British stage, and let nobody forget it. ''The throne is mine,'' he
declaimed. ''No man in the profession can rob me of the character of the
first English actor.''
Yet in one way he resembled a working man down to Rothesay for the
fair. Sometimes he arrived drunk, and stayed that way. He had sought
comfort in a bottle, or several, after bad nights when audiences in
Glasgow and Greenock had heartily booed him. Once he still wore the
costume of Richard III. Gout made changing painful, although rumour said
a syphilis disorder was more his trouble.
He spent his final seven years on a steady diet of drinking himself to
death.
It was years before his long bout began to tell on him in l824, that
he created a Bute refuge from his furious fame. On the shore of Loch Fad
he built his house, Woodend. A mile-long driveway was laid to its front
door. When neighbours questioned the cost of the road-making, he
explained that a one-night appearance in Dublin would see to the cost.
He added a lodge-house because he wanted a full cast of retainers.
Almost memorially, he erected an elaborate gate, with four white busts
atop its pillars. On the central pedestals Kean shares pole position
with Shakespeare, while playwright Philip Massinger and actor David
Garrick take the outside posts.
On still evenings when moonlight gently illuminated the ghostly
effigies, simple islanders were afraid to pass that way through the
trees. Now that the driveway is rough and weather-worn and the trees
shaggier, it can still at night seem a less than heavenly gate.
How Edmund Kean found Bute remains unexplained. His career had hit a
rough patch. His name was no longer enough to fill Drury Lane. He had
taken to touring, but public disapproval of his drunkenness and
debauchery travelled with him. He toyed with going to America. Instead,
for a retreat, he helped design five-bedroom Woodend set on 20 acres.
Bute had drawn him to it with a promise of idyllic solitude. Between
theatrical triumphs he wanted a place to settle to some plain living and
quiet thinking. So he told himself. Ideally, he would have preferred a
Scottish castle.
He even thought of establishing his own tartan economy, keeping in
Scotland the takings from his appearances in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
Dundee. His dream could have come from fond reading of the novels of
Walter Scott.
Scott, however, was not a fan. He miscalled Kean for a ranter -- ''a
copper-laced two-penny tearmouth, rendered mad by conceit and success,''
quoth he.
Snobbishness generated some of the bad opinion about Kean. Born
illegitimate, he had a waif's childhood. Without a formal education, he
learned to sing and dance and fence. Aged l5, he joined a troupe of
strolling players. After l0 years of learning his business, he became an
overnight succcess playing Shylock at Drury Lane.
Kean replaced the grand, statuesque, declamatory acting of the time
with a style all his own. On stage he was lithe and lyrical. Although
small, he had the hard bright energy of lightning. Off stage he was a
wild handful.
Bitchy theatre gossip is likely to have exaggerated his capers. Even
so, they must have been remarkable indeed. He could act when so drunk he
had to be dressed and pushed on to the stage. When he was sued for
adultery by a City bigwig, the douce theatre-going public took to
sniffing at his low behaviour. Some of the stiffer newspapers campaigned
against him -- ''that obscene little personage'' was one of their
friendlier descriptions.
Such a reputation does not seem to have plagued his Bute landing. Here
he was on a self-sufficient, almost feudal, industrious -- busy about
textiles, shipbuilding, and herring fishing -- Scotch community that was
church-going.
When at Woodend, Kean was wont to spent the Sabbath morning in bed,
perhaps rising to fish a little on the loch if the afternoon was fair.
When he went about his policies, he favoured a comic kind of lairdly
plaid suit. Usually he had a bottle in his hand.
Once (so Drury Lane whisperers insisted) his custom was to arrive at a
theatre so far gone in drink as to be nigh speechless. ''Give me bread
and cheese and a couple of whores,'' he cried and went on with the show.
His concession to Rothesay's sensibilities was to bring his own whore
with him. She was the redoubtable Ophelia Benjamin, usually described as
Irish and Jewish, a great lively bully of a lady. She terrified even
Kean's low-life London confreres. For its part, Bute was content to
record that she was bonnie.
In the island's trim and scholarly Bute Museum is the only handy
chronicle of the great thespian's occasional stays in his Scottish home.
His life and Rothesay times are circumspectly outlined in the (l908)
Proceedings of the Buteshire Natural History Society.
Murdoch Mackenzie, a society member, had the modern museum idea of
searching for any surviving islanders who had memories of the exotic
resident at Woodend for a learned paper he wrote. Treasure was found in
a Mrs McFie, by then 86, a daughter of Kean's gardener who had been
brought up in the lodge-house. She had not been in awe of the frightful
Ophelia.
''You know (she remembered) that Kean and his wife had a separation,
and when he cast out with the people in London he came to Woodend with
an awfu' bonnie woman.''
As a child Mrs McFie had not been put off by Kean's drinking. She told
the society's researcher: ''I min' Kean liked a wee drop, and he always
cam' into the lodge for it every time he passed out or in the gate.''
About half the island turned up for a fireworks display when the busts
on the estate's gate were unveiled. In l829 on his birthday --
unofficial because his mother had never told him the date -- he saluted
the occasion with a celebratory series of rounds from his brass
blunderbuss.
Soon afterwards, although only in his forties, he looked an old man.
Spinkly-legged, pot-bellied, he tottered rather than walked. Crumbling
physique made Rothesay too far away for him to travel. He was reduced to
managing a small theatre outside London. He was too broke to retire. Yet
he held on to Woodend until the end.
When in l834, the year after his death, house and contents were sold,
the auction was in Glasgow. Whether any bargain hunters attended from
the island seems not to be known. Bute keeps a Kean silence. If there
are more holiday souvenirs or local memories, Rothesay keeps them to
itself.

IN SOME streets they stand out like beacons. The cold metal
windowpanes are gone, replaced by neat PVC-bordered double glazing. The
roughcast on the walls is transformed from a dingy brown or grey to a
sparkling white or even a daring wha's-like-us pink. The dull,
paint-peeled door that for years matched the rest on the row has been
swopped for a hardwood portal with flashy bevelled glass and a brassy
knocker.
The former council house, now owner-occupied; public sector homes gone
private. Dunrentin over the door and a wrought-iron name sign on the
wall. It is just over 15 years since the first tenants were given the
right to buy. Today, former council and housing association properties
are big on the market as the ex-tenants sell on to move onwards and
upwards on the property owning social scale.
According to the Scottish Office, since 1979 when the law was changed
to give renters the option to buy at often huge discounts, more than a
quarter of a million houses have come off hire and swelled the ranks of
private houses. Since the sell-off, an estimated 8% have been
''churned'' back on the market and now, because of market pressures in
an age of uncertainty, they are proving highly marketable as buyers look
for value for money and discover that when councils built, they actually
built bigger and better and more longer-lasting than some private
developers. In their estates, the roads are often wider and well
surfaced (by another local authority) and well lit and planned.
It has become an occasional social pastime these days to spot the
owners among the renters. It is rarely difficult. Basically, buyers
stake their claim and then stamp their identity, showing they are a cut
above the rest. In many cases they will be the first of their
generation, possibly the first in their known family history to step off
the rental never-ever and take on a mortgage on the never-never.
Now some of the houses that were put up by councils and associations
including the ''Scottish Special'' back in the fifties and sixties are
being sold for substantial sums.
As estate agent Colvil Johnston, managing director of Slater Hogg and
Howison, says: ''Many buyers now consider the post-war ex-public sector
house as very good value for money. The tenants bought at a good price
because of the discounts and now as they move on, their properties are
selling again and again''.
Some facts: Between 1979 and 1993 almost a quarter of all local
authority houses were sold under the right to buy. Each sale took an
average of 8.2 months to process although some councils, like Aberdeen,
dragged heels for almost 17 months and Dumbarton, Kyle and Carrick, and
Western Isles showed a similar reluctance. If the sales to tenants of
Scottish Homes and New Town Development Corporations are added in, the
total percentage of public sector stock rises to 26.6.
Bargain prices in the best areas.
THE scale of discounts on the purchase price varies from property to
property and the length of tenancy. Tenants qualify for Right to Buy
after two years' tenancy, which doesn't need to be continuous, and the
discount on a house after two years is 32% of the market value and then
1% discount a year for each additional year up to a maximum of 60%.
Tenants who live in a flat also qualify for discounts after two years
but the starting discount is 44% of the market value which increases 2%
every year up to a maximum of 70% after 15 years or more as a tenant.
The average price paid by tenants across Scotland for Scottish Homes
houses/flats after the discount is #15,400 based on district valuations
which vary from #18,000 to #69,000.
The figures up until 1993 in Scotland show that more than a quarter of
a million houses were bought out of public landlord control. One year
later, the figure had soared to 304,789 with another 900 converted from
rent to mortgage. By last year almost half a million people had applied
to own or convert to mortgage. Approximately one in 15 of all Scots
bought a public sector house in a quiet but enormous social revolution.
Almost one in 11 of the entire population has put in an application.
Of the bought houses, 8%, some 24,000, have been re-sold, swelling the
market by a substantial amount of property.
A former Edinburgh Corporation house was reported to have gone on the
market last year and traded for close to #80,000. Prices of upwards of
#50,000 for three-bedroom semis are not uncommon.
Scottish Homes say that the most attractive areas on their books
include Paisley, Erskine, and Aberdeen. What might come as a surprise is
that Bellshill is hugely popular. In the Carnbroe estate, 145 of the 155
houses have been sold. In Cambuslang, the SH buy-up is about 78%.
Now, while a conventional, privately built house can command a higher
price than its equivalent ex-rental, former council and agency homes
have soared in price by up to 30% in what has been a relatively stagnant
market. In new towns Irvine, Glenrothes, and East Kilbride they are
apparently selling faster than company-built.
Part of the reason is that the huge discounts allowed people to get on
the property slope. While private buyers pay the full market value, Mr
Tenant's mortgage tends to be only a few pounds a week more than his
previous rent. While he had to wait years for a council painter, his
home is now his castle, his responsibility, and basically his. Or hers.
The double-glazing adds value. So does the car-port, the garage. A new
door gives number 10 Glebe Street the edge on number 12 next door.
Colvil Johnston says: ''It is less common to find such a refit or
refurbishment in a house of the same age built in the private sector.
When many of the council houses were built after the clearance of the
slums in the fifties and sixties, the council specifications were
particularly high and the properties were better built by comparison to
those put up by some of the larger mass builders of the seventies. The
rooms tend also to be larger.
''As a result, they have lasted well and they have certain built-in
advantages of design, construction, not to mention the discounts. They
do offer value for money. The value depends also very much on the
locality. In Glenrothes, a three-bedroom flat will sell for about
#30,000 and that's very good value for money. In East Kilbride, some
three-bedroom semis were nudging over the #50,000 mark and in
Cumbernauld they are over #40,000.''
Enclaves within estates do better than others, as do particular
estates with ''good'' names. After the war, particular schemes were
designed with upmarket houses for skilled tradesmen vital for local
economies, and despite being rented they were always a cut above the
rest.
May Storrie, the new president of the National Association of Estate
Agents, says: ''Council houses in particular areas are keeping their
value and doing very well because people do spend time and money on
improvements and because the houses themselves are of good quality.''
Paisley estate agent Graham Miller said that ex-council properties are
easily keeping their value. An average three-bedroom house is selling
for #38,000-#46,000.
''The houses do sell very well indeed, especially in good areas of the
suburbs. I can confidently expect a sale in less than 10 weeks while the
average house sale is about five months.''
At Glasgow University Professor Duncan McLelland, director of the
Centre for Housing Research and Urban Studies, confirmed that estimates
suggest that so far about 8% of public sector houses have gone back on
the market so far. That percentage is certain to rise rapidly and
substantially.
''There has been no research on the topic in Scotland,'' he says,
''but a recent study by the Department of the Environment in England
suggests that the better quality housing stock was bought in the first
place.
''Also in Scotland, prices have not fallen as they have in England.
The initial purchase price was set at the district valuation and there
is evidence to suggest that many homes were undervalued in the eighties.
Added to that the good discounts and the people who first bought under
the right to buy benefited greatly.''
It's ours and we love it.
NORA McKenzie and her husband Alistair bought their council house in
Glasgow's Knightswood seven years ago. Anyone taking the shortcut to get
west of Glasgow will have seen their house because, as Nora agrees, it's
a landmark.
The McKenzies' house stands out from the crowd on Alderman Road. It is
an ex-corporation house and Alistair has virtually customised it. ''I
love this house,'' Nora says with the pride she obviously has in
something that's bought and paid for. ''I'll die here.''
The care that's been lavished on No 521 is obvious from a distance.
It's the McKenzies' hobby, their interest, virtually their life. If ever
a terrace house was a castle, this is it.
The roughcast brick is stone clad, bracketed by tongue-and-groove wood
panelling. There are awnings over the doors and windows festooned with
flowers in hanging baskets. The windows have French-style decorative
shutters. The living-room window itself has been dispensed with and
replaced by a patio door that leads into the garden. At the rear of the
house another doorway has been cut in the wall, giving access through
the back of the house, via a new conservatory, to the pretty garden
that's been well paved and laid out. The entire three-bedroom house has
been double-glazed in leaded glass. The kitchen is ultra-modern, the
rooms are filled with ornaments, collection of which is Nora's other
hobby.
''It wasn't easy,'' she confides, and she's not talking about the
work. ''I kept on at Alistair for two years before he agreed to buy the
place. That was seven years ago and it's the best move we ever made.
''I grew up here and when I got married, I moved to Drumchapel. All I
ever wanted to do was come back here and when I got this house, about 20
years ago, I knew it was mine. I just wanted to own it from the day I
moved in. I had a real feeling about it.
''We've done a lot of work, Alistair has. I'm the gaffer and he does
it all, and he's awfully good. If you own your own place, you can do
what you like to it, and our house is our pride and joy, and as you can
see, we've spent a fortune on it. All money well spent, though. We don't
go on holiday, but we don't need it. I spend my holidays in the garden
or in the conservatory. If I was away I'd only miss my house.''
The McKenzies paid Glasgow District Council #11,000 for their pride
and joy.
''With the conservatory, our four-apartment is probably worth about
#58,000 now, but money's not the object. We're not selling.
''The first thing we did when we bought it was put in the double
glazing. Since then it's been like the Forth Bridge, but it's been a
labour of love. It's nice to make your mark on a place, and with the
door through to the back, I've got complete privacy.
''I think we were the first among the neighbours to buy, but lots of
neighbours have bought since. Once you get a place of your own, you can
do what you want. It doesn't belong to somebody else and you don't have
to have the paint peeling off the door to give it a lick of paint. You
take pride in it, because it's yours.
''I suppose plenty of people do their place up because they want to
sell it, but that's not us. We've done it because it's ours and we love
it.''

HAVING spent the last three columns on the Isle of Lewis Chess
Festival, I return this week to the 102nd Scottish Championships in
Hawick. The annual championships remain the flagship congress in the
Scottish chess calendar, although the entries in Hawick were
unfortunately affected by Stornoway. There was only one week between the
events which made it difficult for players to get time off to play in
both.
Hawick was nevertheless a successful event. Generously sponsored,
particularly by Roxburgh District Council and Pickfords, but also by
Scottish Borders Enterprise and local businesses, the championships took
place in the town's splendid Teviotdale Leisure Centre. As a competitor
myself, I can confirm that playing in Hawick was a delight.
I have previously reported that the three joint winners of the 102nd
Scottish Championship title, Stephen Mannion, Colin McNab and John Shaw,
all exhibited a ruthless ability to punish their opponents' errors. This
marked them out from the rest of the field, all of whom lost at least
one game, while the winners remained undefeated.
This may not always have led to the most exciting chess, although, of
the three winners, Mannion ran one or two close calls enroute to the
title. It was, however, not only effective but instructive. Here is a
fine example of how to exploit the small advantage of the bishop pair in
a game won by John Shaw.
White: D Kilgour
Black: J Shaw
Scottish Championship, Hawick 1995
Philidor's Defence
1 e4 d6 2 d4 Nf6 3 Nc3 e5 4 Nf3 Nbd7 5 Bc4 Be7 6 h3 c6 7 a4 0-0 8
dxe5!?
This strange decision puts no pressure on Black. Although not an
unsound move, it allows Black to complete his development without
difficulty. Better was 8 0-0, maintaining tension in the centre and a
slight space advantage.
8 . . . dxe5 9 Qe2 Qc7 10 0-0 Nc5 11 Bg5 Ne6 12 Bxe6 Bxe6 13 Nh4 h6 14
Bxf6?
Having already parted with one of his bishops for a knight, White
should not so readily exchange his second bishop for Black's remaining
knight. The bishop pair do have good prospects in this position. Better
was 14 Bd2.
14 . . . Bxf6 15 Nf5 Kh7 16 Qf3 Rad8 17 Nd1 Rd7 18 Nde3 Qd8 19 Rad1
g6!
Black begins a gradual process of undermining White's knights with
suitable pawn moves. This is the classic way to build up a plus with the
bishop pair.
20 Rxd7 Bxd7 21 Nd6 Be7 22 Ndc4 f6 23 Rd1 Qc7 24 h4 h5 25 Rd3 Be6 26
Qd1 Rd8 27 Rxd8 Qxd8 28 Bxd8 29 g3 Bc7 30 Kf1 f5 31 Nd2 Kg7 32 Ke2 Kf6
33 f3?
For his part, the defending side must be careful where he puts his
pawns against the bishop pair. The bishops always work best against two
knights where they can obtain pawn majorities on the flanks and
(ultimately) passed pawns. This now follows by force after Black's next
move. Better was 33 exf5 gxf5 34 b3.
33 . . . f4 34 gxf4 exf4 35 Nd1 Be5 36 b3 Ke7 37 Nf2 Bf6 38 Nd3 Bxh4
39 Nxf4 Bf7 40 Ng2 Bf6 41 f4 g5 42 fxg5?
Black's bishops are gaining perceptibly in force. But even here it may
still have been possible to play for a containing blockade with 42 e5
Bg7 43 fxg5 Bxe5 44 Nf3 followed by Ngh4.
42 . . . Bxg5 43 Nf3 Kf6!
Now with an active king in support of his menacing bishops and h-pawn,
Black is probably winning. If 44 Nxg5 Kxg5 follwed by . . . h4 should
win, or if 44 Ngh4 Bxh4 45 Nxh4 Kg5 with advantage.
44 Ne3 Bf4 45 Ng2 Bg3 46 Ke3 Be6 47 Nf4 Bg4 48 Ne2 Bc7 49 Neg1?!
This move disables White's knights and loses instantly. But his
knights are gradually running out of decent squares anyway and White
must constantly avoid king and pawn endgames because Black's h-pawn will
then be a decisive advantage, e.g. if 49 Nf4 Bxf4+ 50 Kxf4 Bxf3 51 Kxf3
Ke5 and wins.
49 . . . Bb6+ 50 Kf4 Bxg1 51 Nxg1 a5 52 c3 c5 53 Ke3 Ke5 54 Kd3 Kf4 55
Kc4 Ke3 White resigns.

Hawick can be obtained from Simon Kellet, 2/2 233 Leith Walk, Edinburgh

LAST week a French policeman shot at a car being driven by Bosnian
refugees through a roadblock on the Franco-Italian border, killing an
eight-year-old boy on the back seat. It was not, therefore, the most
tactful time for the Minister of the Interior, Jean-Louis Debre, to
present a series of stringent measures to the government against illegal
immigrants.
At its first weekly meeting on Wednesday since the shorter than usual
summer holidays, the cabinet was told by Mr Debre that stepping up the
fight against clandestines had to be a major priority. The argument is
certain to placate many areas of public opinion to whom President
Jacques Chirac has also made, on innumerable occasions, the far more
difficult and still unkept promise of reducing unemployment. And, so
far, Mr Debre's measures have produced hardly more than a murmur of
protest. Only the president of the League for Human Rights, Henri
Leclerc, has accused the government of finding easy scapegoats in the
persons of clandestine immigrants and dodging fundamental and underlying
social problems.
''The present climate surrounding foreigners is a victory for the
ideas of Mr Le Pen,'' Mr Leclerc told Le Monde.
France, and Paris especially, does have a population of foreigners,
mainly young and predominantly North African Arab, who float without
residence or work papers between lowly-paid moonlight jobs, principally
in the building trade and catering, and minor delinquency --
prostitution, often masculine, petty theft and drugs.
Clandestines live in a paranoid world of assumed names, without
papers, or the more prosperous with fake ID bought for around #1000 from
counterfeiters who operate near Pigalle. They live in fear of police
checks and of gangland betrayal. Alcoholism is a common feature. So are
illicit drugs. Flight, whether from poverty and domestic misery or
unresolved psychological conflict, spurred by the prospect of work with
unscrupulous and exploitative employers, is the motivation which brings
them here.
Many such young men are given three-month sentences and a lot more for
subsequent offences, when caught by police without valid papers. Once
released, they are in theory expelled from the country. But in practice
most stay on.
At present 45,000 people are arrested in France every year for being
without valid work and residence papers. Ten thousand or so are
expelled. Last week Mr Debre pledged to double the number of expulsions
and to use chartered planes, instead of scheduled flights, to get people
out.
The first government use of a chartered plane, back in 1986, to expel
101 Malians provoked an uproar and newspaper headlines. Last week Mr
Debre's tough new resolutions attracted only minimum attention. And in
July 43 people from Zaire and 51 Romanians were sent home in chartered
planes.
The Interior Minister also intends to lean more heavily on African
governments to obtain their co-operation in identifying clandestines. He
wants to reinforce collaboration between police and the judiciary to
prevent clogging up prisons with clandestines, although how is not
evident. Last of all is the plan to tackle the economic heart of the
matter by clamping down on firms that employ immigrants, cheaply and
illegally.
Mr Leclerc, of the League of Human Rights, said that increasing the
number of charter flights would not reduce illegal immigration. Just as
taping clandestines' legs together, as police did in July, would not add
to the dignity of the operation.
''The government wants to make people believe that clandestines are
the real problem. The real problem is, in fact, social division and
exclusion which above all affects French people and immigrants who are
in a perfectly legal situation.''

Colombo, Friday,
SRI Lankan police have detained 15 soldiers and policemen for
questioning over the discovery of badly decomposed bodies of young males
in lakes and waterways close to the capital Colombo.
Five trucks believed used in the transport of the bodies have been
seized and are being searched for evidence at the Welikada police
station, just outside Colombo.
More than 20 bodies have been found since May, most of them in the
Bolgoda lake, south of Colombo, with some of the victims having been
starved and tortured before they were killed, police said.
Earlier this month three badly decomposed bodies were fished out of
the Diyawanna Oya, a lake surrounding Sri Lanka's parliament near
Colombo, bringing the number of bodies found there to five.
President Chandrika Kumaratunga's office said in a statement last week
that the government was ''deeply concerned'' about the discovery of the
bodies and had ordered an investigation under the supervision of police
chief W. Rajaguru.
The appearance of the bodies triggered grisly memories of a Sinhalese
youth uprising from 1988-90 in the south and centre of the country that
was brutally crushed by the government. Bodies dumped on roads or washed
up on beaches were a common sight.--Reuter.

El Paso, Friday,
A DEBT collecting company that used death threats while mercilessly
hounding a couple over a #1250 credit-card bill has been ordered to pay
them more than #7m.
''They literally scared the hell out of this poor lady,'' said
Marianne Driscol's lawyer, Noel Gage, in El Paso, Texas. ''She cracked,
they broke her, they literally broke her.''
A state jury ruled that Household Credit Services of Salinas,
California, and the now-defunct Allied Adjustment Bureau violated the
state Debt Collection Practices Act. The law prohibits debt collectors
from threatening violence or making harassing or obscene calls.
''It's outrageous,'' said Household's lawyer, Robert Skipworth, adding
that the company would appeal. Household must pay the entire amount
since Allied has folded.
Collection agents made numerous profanity-laced calls to Mrs Driscol's
home and office in 1991 and 1992, made at least one death threat, and
phoned in a bomb threat to her place of work, according to the lawsuit.
Household did not dispute the complaints, but said that Allied was an
independent contractor doing things on its own in breach of its
contract.
Allied never responded to the lawsuit and offered no defence at the
trial.--AP.

A CERAMIC artist has a recipe for solving South Africa's chronic
shortage of cheap housing -- take a pile of clay bricks, arrange in the
form of a house, and cook till hard.
Thijs Nel today completed the second phase of a three-roomed prototype
house, blasting the interior with three burners that generate about
1000C and cure the clay bricks into ceramic.
He said: ''With decent housing you improve the quality of life and
reduce crime. These houses will be cool in summer and warm in winter
because of the 16in thick walls.''
The only expenses were wages for three unskilled labourers and the
fuel used for the burners.--Reuter.

Washington, Friday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has decided that his wife, Hillary, should
attend the international women's conference in Beijing next month.
The main obstacle was lifted on Thursday when China released the
Chinese-American dissident, Harry Wu, who had been arrested in China
last June.
He arrived safely in San Francisco last night. The State Department
has denied that there was any deal between the two governments to the
effect that Mrs Clinton would attend the conference in exchange for Mr
Wu's release, but the denial deserves to be treated with some
scepticism.
Mrs Clinton made no bones about her desire to go to Beijing for the
conference, which opens on September 4, and China wanted her to attend.
Republicans in Congress strongly oppose her going, on the grounds that
it might appear to condone China's lamentable record on human rights.
Harry Wu's friends and his wife also insisted that she could not go to
Beijing as long as he was in jail. Mrs Clinton always said that the
conference was about women, not about China, and very much wanted to
make a speech on women's issues, but concluded, or the president
concluded, that she could not go while Mr Wu remained in custody.
Mr Wu had spent 19 years in Chinese prisons already in the 1960s and
70s. He came to America afterwards, and became an American citizen.
It seems the Chinese concluded that it was more to their interest to
have Mrs Clinton attend the conference than to incarcerate Mr Wu. He was
tried and sentenced to 15 years for spying on Thursday, and immediately
expelled.
Meanwhile, the Vatican has nominated an American woman law professor
from Harvard, Mary Ann Glendon, to lead its delegation.
At the last women's conference, in Cairo in 1985, the Vatican
delegation was headed by an archbishop.

SYDNEY: A student who fired a starter's pistol at the Prince of Wales
last year has been sentenced to 500 hours of community. District Court
Judge Angela Karpin, who rejected a prosecution call to imprison David
Kang, 24, said he had suffered substantially as a consequence of his
actions. She said Kang had been mentally depressed at the time.
The incident happened in a Sydney park on January 26, 1994, during a
ceremony to mark Australia's national day. Kang was arrested seconds
after he ran from a crowd, fired the harmless pistol repeatedly into the
air, then lunged on to a stage where the Prince was standing. The Prince
was not harmed. Defence lawyers said their client had wanted to protest
against the detention of dozens of Cambodian boat people by immigration
authorities.

Rubavu, Rwanda, Friday,
THE first Rwandan refugees to return voluntarily from Zaire today were
met at home villages by cheers and tears of joy after more than a year
in exile.
But a Rwandan official warned that a major problem for many would be
that their homes were now occupied by other families.
After reaching a transit camp in Rwanda, about 30 men among those who
crossed today were stopped by Rwandan soldiers and questioned about
whether they were involved in last year's genocide.
It was unclear if they were arrested or how long they were detained at
the transit camp at Nkamera, 12 miles from the Gisenyi border crossing
point from Zaire to northwest Rwanda.
On UN trucks and buses, nearly 200 refugees drove over the same border
they fled across in chaos with an estimated one million other Hutu
refugees in the last stages of the civil war in July last year.
At Nkamera they were separated into men, women, and children in a
registration and screening process while UN aid workers handed out food
to tide them over for the first days in their homeland.
Aid workers, expecting more returnees, were building new shelters at
the transit camp as the first batch went through.
But some aid workers disagreed with the UN programme being called a
voluntary repatriation, saying those who went back had little choice
after their camps were ransacked during the forced expulsion of some
15,000 refugees this week by Zairean troops.
''After people were told to come down from the hills they found their
shelters destroyed and had nowhere to go and decided to return to
Rwanda,'' said UN refugee agency field officer Alberto Chys.
''Is this a voluntary repatriation? I would not say so,'' he added.
The returnees were then divided by their home communes and listened to
Rwandan radio stations stressing the return was voluntary and
encouraging more to come while they waited for the ride home.
They then boarded the buses and trucks again and drove around the
Rubavu region as local residents cheered and waved.
At their home villages, they unloaded their few belongings and were
welcomed by local residents with tears, hugs, and kisses -- and by
soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA).
''The problem that many of the people are going to find is that their
houses are occupied. They are not prepared for this,'' said Eugene
Rundana, an official with Rwanda's rehabilitation ministry.
Standing in her home village, one of the returnees said she was afraid
to go back but now she was happy with her reception.
She said refugees in eastern Zaire were afraid they would be killed by
the RPA. She named officers in the defeated Hutu government army in
exile who warned them not to go back.
Up to an estimated one million Tutsis and Hutu moderates were
slaughtered in last year's genocide by Hutu government troops and
militiamen who then fled with refugees into exile.
The Rwandan government has promised all returnees will be given back
homes and property if they can prove they owned them.
Hundreds of thousands of Tutsi refugees who fled Rwanda as long ago as
the 1950s returned to the country after the RPA victory last year and
many took over abandoned Hutu homes and businesses.
But also following a Tutsi exodus, especially in 1959, some Hutus
simply moved into what had been Tutsi-owned homes and businesses, making
it difficult now to decide who has the right to them.--Reuter.

Nairobi, Friday
WOMEN were as guilty as men in last year's ethnic slaughter in Rwanda,
but many are getting away with murder because of society's image of
females as innocent bystanders, a human rights group said today.
African Rights said women and girls, including government officials,
domestic servants, teachers, nurses, and nuns took part in the killings.
''They excelled as cheerleaders of the genocide, singing and ululating
the killers into action. They entered churches, schools, football
stadiums, and hospitals to finish off the wounded, hacking women,
children, and even men to death,'' the London-based group said in its
report.
At least a half-million ethnic Tutsis died in the bloodbath blamed on
the Hutu majority, which ran Rwanda's government and military until
being driven out by a Tutsi-led rebel army in July 1994.
The report said thousands of female killers had already returned to
Rwanda, taking advantage of the blanket protective cover of their
''innocence''.
Female killers living in exile have found jobs in aid agencies,
hospitals, and schools, the report said. One woman accused of
involvement in genocide was Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, a former Rwandan
cabinet minister in charge of women and family affairs.
African Rights said she now is in charge of social services in a
refugee camp in Bukavu. Two nuns who led killers to their victims and
referred to Tutsis as ''dirt'' are being sheltered in a Belgian
monastery, it said.
African Rights said women joined the killings for the same reason as
men: they were persuaded by a massive Hutu government campaign that
urged men, women, and children to hunt down Tutsis and make their
country ethnically pure.
African Rights said current moves to repatriate Rwandan refugees from
camps in Zaire underscore the need to address the role of women in the
April-June 1994 killings. Most returnees are women.
Of the few refugees voluntarily returning to Rwanda from Zaire under a
UN repatriation programme today, nearly all were women.
The first to return were met at home villages by cheers and tears of
joy after more than a year in exile.
But a Rwandan official warned that a major problem for many would be
that their homes were now occupied by other families.
After reaching a transit camp in Rwanda, about 30 men among those who

Cairo, Friday
IRAQ has handed over to United Nations officials materials which could
be used to manufacture components for a nuclear weapons programme,
diplomatic and nuclear agency sources said yesterday.
A source at the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said
Iraqi government officials handed over an unspecified number of metal
parts which they said belonged to Baghdad's nuclear arms programme.
The materials were believed to be high-quality steel parts suitable
for making a missile or a centrifuge system for enriching uranium, the
key to building a nuclear bomb.
The Iraqis claimed the materials had been hidden by Iraqi defector
Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan, Saddam's son-in-law, who fled
to Jordan earlier this month.
These ''chilling'' disclosures about Iraq's weapons programmes mean
the Security Council still is a long way from lifting sanctions against
Baghdad, the US ambassador to the UN, Madeleine Albright, said.
She said new information disclosed to the council showed Iraq planned
to deploy a nuclear weapon by April 1991, and had armed missile warheads
with biological agents.
Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN special commission in charge of
scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said Baghdad's biological
warfare programme was Iraq's ''secret weapon'' to fend off US attacks
after it invaded Kuwait. However, the US threatened dire reprisals,
which Iraq took seriously.
Ekeus said Iraq had filled 191 bombs, artillery shells and missiles
with germs and other biological agents. They included anthrax, the
deadly toxin botulinim, and aflatoxin, a cancer-causing agent.
Meanwhile, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has said he is ready to
grant Saddam Hussein political asylum if the move would spare bloodshed
and end suffering among the Iraqi people.
It was the first such public offer made since Saddam's two
sons-in-law, including Hussein Kamel, the mastermind of Iraq's military
industries, defected to Jordan with their families on August 8.
Mubarak said he had already made the offer privately to King Hussein
of Jordan a week before Hussein Kamel defected. There has been no
indication the Iraqi leader is seeking asylum.
The Egyptian leader said in an interview with the London-based
al-Hayat newspaper that he renewed the offer.
''I asked King Hussein about Iraq and he told me that the situation
was very difficult. I proposed that if President Saddam liked to come
here I would accept him as a political refugee to solve the problem of
the Iraqi people,'' Mubarak said.
Hussein Kamel also gave interviews today saying he was working to oust
Saddam soon and asked Arabs to help get rid of him. ''We have a strong
base among the special guards, the army and society.''
He reiterated that Saddam had provisionally planned a new attack on
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for August 31.
Asked if Saddam's ousting was imminent, he said: ''God willing,
definitely it will be soon, and on this we depend on the support of the
Iraqi society.--Reuter.

PRINCE Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones yesterday joined the royal holiday
party at Balmoral amid speculation that the couple are to announce their
engagement.
They joined a large gathering of royal family members, who are to pose
for an official family photograph tomorrow.
It was predicted that the Queen would set the seal on the romance by
allowing PR executive Miss Rhys-Jones to be in the picture.
Her parents, Christopher and Mary Rhys-Jones, are believed to have
been invited to join the party at Balmoral, which will also include
Prince Charles, Princes William and Harry, Princess Anne, and her
husband Tim Laurence.
Staff on the Deeside estate were convinced that Miss Rhys-Jones's
presence at such a high-profile event meant she was destined for a royal
future.
One said: ''This photo session has been arranged for a long time. I
doubt if Sophie is coming all the way here just to watch. We all think
there is some significance in the fact she is here at all. I hope so
because she is a delightful young lady.''
However, another Balmoral source suggested an engagement announcement
would not take place this weekend -- but may not be a long way off.
The couple flew to Aberdeen Airport last night, then drove the 50
miles to the royal family's Scottish retreat.
The official photograph is to be taken by Logan Sangster of Deeside
Photographics.
One senior member of the family not due at Balmoral is the Duke of
York, who is on holiday with his estranged wife amid rumours that a
reconciliation is on the cards.

A COUNCIL plan to sell off publicly-owned business parks was given the
go-ahead yesterday when three judges in the Court of Session refused an
appeal by Falkirk Council.
The judges also refused Falkirk leave to take an immediate appeal to
the House of Lords.
The planned sale of Callendar Business Park in Falkirk and Central
Park in Larbert has been agreed between Labour-controlled Central
Regional Council and John Laing Property Ventures Ltd.
The sell-off is opposed by Falkirk Council who on April 1 1996 will
take over the functions of the current district authority. If the
business parks are disposed of before September 1 this year, Central
region does not need the consent of the new authority.
Falkirk asked Lord Osborne for an order banning Central from disposing
of the business parks for the purpose of operating them as a joint
venture before September 1.
After a four-day hearing at the Court of Session last week, Lord
Osborne decided to refuse to grant a court order to Falkirk to block the
sell-off.
Yesterday, after a two-day appeal at the Court of Session, Lord
Allanbridge, sitting with Lords Coulsfield and Murray, said they were
''clearly and unanimously'' satisfied that Lord Osborne had reached the
correct decision.

THE widow of Flower of Scotland composer Roy Williamson has re-married
in a mystical ceremony in the Highlands.
There was no dinner dance at the wedding of the former wife of The
Corries singer . . . guests just squatted round a camp fire, played
guitars, and sang until the early hours of the morning.
Nor was there a place round the campfire for Roy Williamson's singing
partner Ronnie Browne.
Nicki Fraser, 38, wore an Indian-style tassled dress and green top.
Simon Fraser, 45, was dressed in a blue silk shirt and blue dress
trousers, and the minister donned a loosely fitting light blue smock.
The vows were adapted to include the line: ''We promise to be
everything we can be to each other in our Karmic lives.''
The wedding took place in Simon's renovated art studio at Kirkhill,
near Inverness, which used to be a byre.
There were no posh hotels for the guests either, which included
Nicki's Dutch family, as a campsite was set up at the back of the
studio.
Guests did not bring presents but they were asked to bring something,
like food or even money, to help pay for the entertainment after the
wedding ceremony.
Invitations to the wedding asked people to come along to the ''White
Eagle Style'' wedding.
There was no honeymoon either, as the couple are still staying in the
Inverness area.
Nicki and Simon have been seeing each other for about three or four
years and are firm believers in Karma which is a Hindu and Buddhism
belief that actions in this life will lead to rewards or punishments in
the next. The White Eagle religion is based on the North American Indian
culture.
Roy Williamson, who latterly lived in Forres, Moray, died of a brain
tumour on August 12, 1990.

FIREFIGHTERS on Merseyside are set to strike through the night for the
second time, this weekend, despite the tragic death of a student in a
bedsit blaze during their first walk-out.
Army and RAF fire crews won praise for the way they tackled the fire
in Grove Park, Toxteth, Liverpool, early yesterday, although the county
fire chief admitted that their Green Goddesses reached the scene three
minutes later than a fire engine would have been expected to arrive.
The firefighters, in dispute over working extra shifts to cover for 20
job cuts by cash-strapped Merseyside Fire Authority, had launched their
third nine-hour strike at midnight, after two earlier daytime strikes
had passed without serious incident.
When police received a 999 alert that fire was sweeping the top flat
of the three-storey semi-detached house at 4.38am, it took eight minutes
for the first two Green Goddesses and an RAF fire rescue unit to reach
the scene from a territorial army base in Mather Avenue, Allerton.
Had firefighters been on duty, it should have taken five minutes for
the first crew to reach the scene from Toxteth's High Park Street fire
station. A second pump would have arrived in eight minutes.
However, Merseyside's chief fire officer, Mr Andrew Best, said the
issue of whether the man who died could have been saved by his
firefighters was ''a very speculative question''.
Up to six people were evacuated from the flats and received treatment
for shock and smoke inhalation. A further Green Goddess and two more
fire rescue units were sent to the scene, and the fire was brought under
control in 25 to 30 minutes.
It was then that the body of Mr Mark Shuttleworth, 25, who had
graduated in July from the city's John Moores University with a first in
Fine Art, was recovered from the top flat.
Mr Best said: ''There is no doubt from the investigation to date,
which is still on-going, that this was a very serious fire that was ably
tackled by the Army and RAF, who made extreme, valiant efforts in their
firefighting and rescue techniques.''
Neighbour Miss Terry Harrison, 23, who suffered burns to her foot as
she fled the fire, said Mr Shuttleworth and his girlfriend, who survived
the blaze, had been celebrating into the early hours, singing and
drinking.
She said she recalled awakening to a pungent smell of smoke. ''I got
on the phone and called the fire brigade and then we got dressed and got
out. It just went black everywhere, and the smoke started billowing as
we opened the door.
''Their door was open and their flat was just engulfed in black smoke
and flames. I didn't know anyone was in there at the time.''
Fire Brigade Union national executive member, Mr Mike Lawson,
confirmed that the action would continue, with the next nine-hour
walk-out set for midnight tonight.
''Our resolve remains the same because the action is designed to stop
the very thing that has happened being a regular event, because the fire
authority is cutting the service to the bone,'' he said.

THE signalling system over a large part of the Central Scotland line,
where 10 potentially fatal failures were recorded during a rewiring
project, still relies upon a manually-operated system of pulleys that
have roots in the 1870s.
Staff in boxes at Carmuirs East, Dunblane, Grangemouth, and Larbert
junctions continue to haul levers to alter signals, with wires
stretching as far as half-a-mile, according to sources.
Although some electrically-operated signals are also in use, it is
understood that a modernisation scheme planned in the late 1980s fell by
the wayside because of lack of funds.
The confidential Railtrack project into the rewiring scheme admits
that recommendations following the Clapham and Newton disasters -- in
which 39 died -- were not applied.
The failures ''would have been prevented'' had the recommendations
been applied to the project.

THE vicar at the centre of a sex scandal was seeking psychiatric help
last night as he was barred from acting as a Church of England minister.
Mr Chris Brain was being taken from a secret Derbyshire address to
Cheadle Royal Hospital, in Manchester, where he is expected to be a
patient for at least two weeks.
The move came as the Archbishop of York, Dr John Habgood, wrote to Mr
Brain, informing him of his decision, and amid further allegations
against his Sheffield-based ''rave'' church.
The Right Rev Roy Arnold, Sheffield diocese communications officer,
said: ''Mr Brain is going as a voluntary patient after receiving various
forms of help this week.''
Journalists are understood to be camped outside Mr Brain's house,
where he has been in hiding since details of activities during his New
Age cult-style Nine O'Clock Services emerged earlier this week.
Yesterday's letter from the archbishop bars Mr Brain from ministering
anywhere in the Church of England.
The Bishop of Sheffield, the Right Rev David Lunn, has already banned
him from practising in the diocese.
The diocese is currently examining the full legal implications of the
allegations against the 38-year-old priest. It is claimed he sexually
and psychologically abused dozens of women who were Nine O'Clock
Services members.
Mr Arnold said it was possible that Mr Brain might be tried by a
consistory court -- a move which could lead to his being suspended from
Holy Orders, more commonly known as being defrocked.
This is more serious than a bar from the ministry and can be carried
out only by the church's legal courts.
Mr Arnold added that the accounts of the NOS had been shown to be in
order. Church officials had found nothing to report to the police.

HUNDREDS of signalling jobs are being shed under British Rail's
break-up for sale, despite growing public alarm over passengers' safety.
Despite 10 serious signal failures being recorded on just one stretch
of Scottish track, Signalling Control UK -- one of two businesses set up
as part of BR's privatisation -- has slashed staff by 140, about 15% of
its workforce.
The firm's main rival, Interlogic Control Engineering, had already
shed 180 jobs prior to the SCUK job losses, blamed on a huge slump in
orders from Railtrack, now responsible for infrastructure including
signals.
Labour yesterday called for an inquiry into Railtrack's safety
procedures following a leaked report of a ''botched'' rewiring project
which led to the 10 failures between October and March on the
Glasgow-Stirling-Perth line.
The report admitted that instead of a signal giving an automatic stop,
it gave the all-clear -- dubbed a ''wrong-side failure,'' and widely
regarded as the ultimate safety hazard.
It also disclosed that recommendations of inquiry reports into the
Clapham and Newton disasters, in which 39 people died, had been ignored.
The disturbing revelations come only two weeks after a leaked report
from a Railtrack safety manager spoke of flawed safety procedures within
his company. Taken with this week's postponement of the sale of
InterCity West Coast rail route, the Government's overall rail
privatisation plans have been seriously dented.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour's Scottish transport spokesman, said
yesterday he believed there was a direct link between signalling
problems and two key issues -- a chronic shortage of investment in
infrastructure, and a rapid loss of jobs in the industry.
He alleged that Railtrack seemed more concerned about selling itself
off than with safety.
Mr McLeish said: ''Rail safety does not appear to be safe within
Railtrack.
''It is now up to the Health and Safety Executive to launch a major
inquiry into signalling the length and breadth of Scotland.''
Mr Dick King, Scottish secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs'
Association, backed the call for an inquiry.
Mr King also questioned Railtrack's powers to validate the safety of
maintenance units within BR's Infrastructure Services being broken up
for sale. He asked: ''How can it be trusted to provide such safety
assurances when its own staff appear to be suspect?''
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher also demanded the Railway
Inspectorate carry out a comprehensive review of Railtrack's safety
record.
He said its ''abysmal'' safety performance was a direct consequence of
privatisation, with the unified management structure being fragmented
and ''cost-cutting considerations being placed ahead of safety''.
Railtrack's report into the rewiring project on the Central Scotland
line found that the signal failures would have been prevented if the
Newton and Clapham recommendations had been followed.
No collisions resulted from the failures because the line, with an
average four trains an hour, was empty at the time.
Railtrack yesterday acknowledged the incidents were serious and said
the report was ''very critical and pulling no punches''.
However, a spokesman insisted: ''The failures did not occur when any
trains were running and at no time were any trains in danger.''
Cutting costs on safety was denied: ''It's rubbish to say that. There
is no way we would cut safety for commercial gain.''

TRIBUTE was paid yesterday to the quality of entries at this year's
Ayr Flower Show despite the most difficult growing season in 20 years.
Show manager Pat Gibbs said: ''I have the highest regard for every
person who made an entry . The heat and dry conditions have made rose
and carnation growing exceptionally difficult but begonias have
flourished. Full marks to everyone.''
As judging closed last night in the main categories, the winners were:
Andrew Heatlie, of Selkirk, with six sweet pea classes; James Douglas
Semple, of Mount Vernon, with seven dahlia class wins; Andrew Moore, of
Glassford, with seven gladioli and three carnation winners; John
Johnstone, of Prestwick, with 11 wins in geraniums; John Smith, of
Kilwinning, with seven fuchsia wins.
Daniel Sinclair won 13 classes in cacti, Hector Mackenzie of Oban was
named Master Gardener, while Doris and Robert Telfer from Broughty Ferry
dominated wine making and John Kennedy of Maybole won 14 fruit and
vegetable classes. John Hamilton of Ochiltree won 12 pansy classes.
The British begonia championships were won by Alex Johnstone while
Louise and Nicola Rowan of Coylton won 10 children's classes and Kenneth
Kelly of Saltcoats provided the best hanging basket ever seen at Ayr.

<TEXT>
PLANS by Strathclyde Regional Council to rebuild the seawall at Oban,
which dates back to the 1880s, have been criticised by three national
heritage bodies, although local opinion appears to back the scheme.
Just one local person has objected to the work, which is being
supported by district council planners and the town's community council.
The most severe criticism has come from the Scottish Civic Trust,
which has attacked plans to demolish the existing sea-wall parapet. In a
letter to Argyll and Bute District Council, the trust said it would be
''unacceptable to effect so great a change on this important area of the
town''.
It said that a portion of work which had already been carried out by
Strathclyde, before it was notified that parts of the wall had been
given listed building status, ''leaves us in serious doubt over the
likely success of the proposal''.
The Government's Historic Scotland agency, which made the listed
building designation, also objected, claiming the work would be ''a loss
to the Victorian character of Oban''. Objections have also been made by
the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland.
However, the regional council defended its plans, saying the new
parapet would ''lend a warmer and livelier tone to the harbourside'' and
improve coastal protection. District council planning officials and Oban
Community Council have also given the plans their backing.
The matter will be discussed at a meeting of the district council's
planning committee next week.

TRUANCY is showing no signs of reducing in Scottish schools, according
to the findings of a new education survey.
Three out of five pupils questioned in the survey of school leavers in
1993 admitted to have truanted, although half said they only ''skipped a
lesson here and there''.
However, nearly nine percent had done so for ''several days at a
time'' and for ''a few weeks at a time''.
The Scottish School Leavers Survey says the proportion of truants
during their fourth year among 1993 leavers was almost identical to the
previous year.
On a more positive front, the survey discloses Scottish education is
continuing to produce pupils who are achieving better qualifications,
almost half those who left school that year remaining in full-time
education.
Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson, who announced the
findings yesterday, said he was encouraged by the qualifications level.
''Almost half of the school leavers were in full-time education the
following October, with 23% of these having started a degree course. The
level of qualifications are steadily improving, giving pupils more
options to plan their future.''
The survey was carried out for the Government by Social and Community
Planning Research.

<HEADLINE>Three projects share #1.2m award.  Lottery boost for Scottish film industry</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ALLAN LAING, ENTERTAINMENTS WRITER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976699639</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Arts Council last night announced details of the first
National Lottery grant for the Scottish film industry, with the bulk of
the #1.2m award going to just one ambitious project -- the most
expensive feature film in Scottish cinema history.
Poor Things, an adaptation of an award-winning novel by Glasgow writer
Alasdair Gray, will receive #1m towards its massive #6.5m production
budget. It will be shot with an all-star cast in Scotland, London,
Morocco, and Paris.
The small change will go to two other films, both destined initially
for the television screen:
Transition, a #250,000 documentary being made jointly for two
Glasgow-based independents, Phoenix Films and Wark Clements, for Channel
4, is to get #135,507.
The Ring of Truth, a #160,000 film by another Glasgow company, Lomond
Television, and co-funded by BBC Scotland, will receive #92,099. It is
based on a screenplay by the late Bill Douglas, one of Scotland's
foremost film makers.
Announcing the awards in Edinburgh, Mr Bill Brown, chairman of the
SAC, said: ''The lottery committee of the SAC has done an excellent job.
The guiding principle has been and will continue to be to spread the
money widely, both geographically and to benefit as many people as
possible.
''Awards to film makers fulfil these criteria very well as film is
probably one of the most accessible art forms. Some of Scotland's most
creative talents are working in film with a string of successes on both
cinema and television screens and we are very pleased to give this level
of financial support.''
The Scottish Film Production Fund director, Eddie Dick, welcomed the
announcement and predicted that there would be more grants to follow
later this year.
This was only the first award, he said, and the SFPF would be
returning to the SAC's lottery committee as early as the end of
September with another series of projects that his organisation
considered worthy of funding.
Mr Douglas Connell, chairman of the lottery committee, confirmed that
it would be considering more film applications later in the year -- but
that only ''quality projects'' would succeed.
He also revealed that, although potential commercial success was not
among the criteria, the committee would be quite happy if the films made
money. There is a built-in clause for the fund to enjoy a financial
return on the profits.
The SAC is the first arts council in Britain to identify specific film
projects which will benefit from the lottery fund. England has announced
that its film industry is to receive over the next five years #70m for
film making and #10m for promotion -- but exactly where the money is to
go has still to be decided.
The first three Scottish films are recognised as entirely worthy
projects which would find it difficult to obtain finance without the
lottery cash. They are also particularly Scottish in their nature.
Poor Things, described as a ''wildly comic and ingenious tale'' that
retells the Pygmalion story, will be produced by Parallel Pictures. It
will be produced by Iain Brown and Bill Chamberlain and directed by Scot
Sandy Johnson, whose work includes the BBC drama series Roughnecks.
Mr Brown said they had initially intended some years ago to make a
film of Gray's novel Lanark but it had proved to be extremely difficult
to adapt for the screen. The lottery cash, he added, would provide
''very solid ground'' on which to build the remaining part of the
budget. Filming would begin next summer.
In its own way, the Transition documentary is every bit as ambitious.
Film maker Andy Mackinnon plans to instal permanent cameras at a number
of secret locations in Scotland and, using a time-lapse filming
technique, to record the changes to each area over the next five years.
The final 90-minute documentary will be shown on Channel 4 at the turn
of the century.
His partner in the project, Ms Kirsty Wark, confirmed that, like Poor
Things, they would never have been able to tackle the project without
the lottery cash. Though the film is intended for TV, the producers hope
that it will eventually receive cinema screenings.
The Ring of Truth, ''an amusing and enthralling allegory about the
cycle of life and death'', will be produced by Alastair Scott and
directed by Richard Downes, both experienced television programme
makers. It is co-funded, not only by BBC Scotland, who will transmit it,
but also by Strathclyde University, Glasgow District Council, and the
British Film Institute. It too will be filmed in Glasgow.
Welcoming the grants, Scottish Office Arts Minister Lord Lindsay said:
''This will be a significant boost for the industry and will no doubt
encourage others to develop film projects and to apply for lottery
support.''

ONE of the two Martello towers in Orkney built to ward off marauding
French ships during the Napoleonic wars was handed over to Historic
Scotland yesterday.
The present owner, Mr John Cload, who has lived in the house formerly
used as officers' rooms next to the tower at Hackness on Hoy since 1922,
will continue to live there and act as caretaker.
Mr Grame Munro, director of Historic Scotland, which has looked after
the monument since 1975, said it was an exceptional example of military
architecture.
Hackness never saw a shot fired in anger, except during gun drill by
the Orkney Volunteer Artillery and was out of date by the First World
War. It has a twin tower on the north side of the anchorage at Crock
Ness.

THE first lesson of a six-week tour by Scottish Education Minister
Raymond Robertson to persuade schools of the virtues of self-governing
status fell on deaf ears yesterday at the last institution at which the
Minister taught.
Mr Robertson described talks with the head teacher at Dumbarton
Academy, Mr Jim MacKenzie, and Mr Hendry Morrison, parents'
representative, as ''cordial and upfront'' but left no nearer to
convincing them of his department's flagship policy.
On Thursday, Mr MacKenzie declared his school had ''no interest'' in
opting out.
The Minister, backed by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, is
visiting primary and secondary schools around Scotland to discover the
reasons behind the reluctance of parents and heads to opt out.
Of Scotland's 2400 local authority schools, only Dornoch Academy in
Sutherland has achieved self-governing status.
Mr Robertson described his purpose as ''fact-finding'' and denied
there was an element of door-to-door salesmanship about the exercise. He
said: ''I am not in the business of co-ercing anyone to seek
self-governing status. I passionately believe in parental choice and
today spelled out the advantages of the policy.
''If at the end of the day, schools still decide against
self-governing status that is not a problem but I want parents to be in
full possession of the facts.''
Mr Robertson said he had started his tour at Dumbarton because his
teaching experience there helped him appreciate the schools' perspective
and allowed him to ''touch base'' with his former career.
He received a detailed statement of the academy's opposition to the
policy. Mr MacKenzie explained the move might jeopardise support
services which the school receives from Strathclyde Regional Council and
lose him access to ''invaluable'' advice from local authority
colleagues.
Of Mr Robertson's visit, he added: ''I put my views frankly and openly
and he laid his cards on the table. There was nothing the Minister said
which would make me change my opinion.''
Mr Morrison, chairman of the parents' association, said: ''In the
past, when opting out was brought up, there was no great enthusiasm
among the parents and there was nothing said today which will alter
that.''
He also said there were doubts over the additional facilities from the
local authority under opting out.
Mr Roberston promised the question of maintaining educational support
service levels under self-governing status would be given special
scrutiny.

THE chief executive of South Ayrshire Hospitals NHS Trust is preparing
to pay 1000 of his staff a 3% pay rise -- despite the continuing battle
for a national pay deal.
Mr Donald McNeill has called on union leaders to ''release the
gridlock'' of national pay bargaining and allow him to pay all health
workers in South Ayrshire the rise backdated to April.
It is the intention of the trust to pay the money to all employees on
local pay contracts from next month.
Mr McNeill's announcement, made on the day the trust published its
third annual report, angered union leaders, who have made it clear that
industrial action is an option to achieve a national pay award.
He said: ''It is clear to me that the trade unions in London are in
gridlock over their insistence on a national pay deal. We are appealing
to them to break that gridlock and allow us to pay what we believe is a
very reasonable pay award.
''We owe it to the 1000 staff at all levels who have committed
themselves to the trust to pay this rise, and that is what will be done
from September.''
The other 1000 staff working for the trust, including three quarters
of the nursing staff, are tied to Whitley Council scales of pay and
conditions and must wait for a national settlement. They will also have
3% backdated in South Ayrshire, believed to be the first trust in
Britain to implement a local pay rise, once the dispute is settled.

IN football parlance they were gutted, sick as parrots -- five men who
thought they had achieved a dream by sharing a #2.3m pools win but never
received their cheque because their syndicate coupon was never forwarded
to Littlewoods by their agent.
For years, the five friends had placed their wager, changing their
numbers, and always dreaming the impossible dream.
Suddenly, one day last September, it happened. It was secured by a
winning line of their two columns of carefully written Xs on an eight
from eleven selection. The final result which they thought earned them
the jackpot was the final box at the bottom of the list -- the game
between Morton and Brechin, which gave them the maximim number of points
and a first dividend with a telephone claim required to confirm it.
Unfortunately, when ScottishPower worker Gordon Turner called
Liverpool, the company could not find their coupon.
His colleague, Mr John Ferguson, 43, from Dunipace, summed up the
reaction of his friends.
He, Mr Kelly, and Mr Syme are cable jointers, often working up to
their knees in winter mud, helped by Mr McVean and Mr Gordon Turner, as
labourers.
They thought those days were over, amid ambitions of new cars, better
houses, and security for the rest of their lives, because they would
have won just under #500,000 each.
Now, they are consulting their Glasgow lawyers over an impending civil
action, pursuing the money they insist they won fairly, having handed
over the loose change they made up between themselves for their weekly
stake.
Mr Turner was the man who always placed the bet, and while Mr Ferguson
never even knew the collector, he was happy to hand over his share every
month.
It was not until three days after the results were announced that the
truth began to sink in.
Mr Ferguson went to work and asked: ''Gordon -- am I working this
week?''
The reply from Mr Turner was: ''Well, maybe not, but don't get too
excited, because there is a problem. They can't find the coupon.''
When the reality of their loss emerged, the men were understandably
angry.
''The first reaction was of being gutted -- pure anger and rage at
Baxter, and disbelief that this had happened.
''We felt angry at being betrayed,'' said Mr Ferguson.
He said that within hours of the results being announced, the men had
made plans on how they would spend their win.
By nature, Mr Ferguson says he is a cautious man but looked forward to
enjoying the share of his win, with a lifestyle he could only have
imagined.
He and his friends are bitter.
''Littlewoods are selling dreams to the working man but they only
delivered a nightmare to me,'' he said.
Mr Ferguson said: ''Driving out with my wife, if I saw a car I liked,
she said that the only chance of buying it would be in winning the
pools.
''All we have had was the big build-up for the big letdown. This was a
psychological schock to us all at the time.''

<TEXT>
A BOARD member of a major Scottish NHS trust has been criticised by an
industrial tribunal, which called into question her ''objectivity and
detachment''.
Mrs Sue Williams, who is also regional director of nursing for the
Greater Glasgow Community and Mental Services NHS Trust, had given
evidence before the tribunal in an unfair dismissal case involving a
nursing assistant at Gartnavel Royal Hospital.
She chaired the appeals committee which heard the case of Mr Daniel
Martin, of Summerhill Road, Drumchapel, Glasgow, the nursing assistant
who was accused of assaulting, shouting, and swearing at, and wrapping
an 83-year-old senile male patient in a blanket to restrain him.
However, as Mrs Williams was in the middle of being cross-examined
about alleged procedural irregularities at the unsuccessful appeal
hearing, she became agitated, stood up and in no uncertain terms
declared she was leaving the tribunal hearing.
It took the combined efforts of a lawyer acting for Greater Glasgow
Health Board, the tribunal chairman, and Mr Martin's lawyer to persuade
Mrs Williams to sit down and resume giving evidence.
In a written decision dismissing Mr Martin's unfair dismissal claim,
Mr William Courtney, the tribunal chairman, said of the appeal hearing:
''If we have a comment to make on this aspect of the case, it is in
regard to Mrs Williams' own evidence.
''She is a regional director of nursing, a leading member of a
profession for which there is great public regard.
''She is no doubt a person of importance in her sphere.
''That, however, could not adequately account for her increasing
resentment at the perfectly proper line of cross-examination directed to
the adequacy of the appeal procedure.
''In particular, it could not excuse her abrupt announcement in the
course of her evidence that she was leaving.
''Happily she thought better of this and concluded her evidence.
''Her actions, however, in the course of giving evidence were not such
as to impress us with her objectivity and detachment as chairman of an
appeal committee.''
Mr Martin had been employed as a nursing assistant for almost eight
years at Gartnavel Royal Hospital before his dismissal in November 1993.
The appeal hearing did not take place until March this year, which was
after Mr Martin's trial for assault at which he was found not guilty.

FORMER Celtic and Scotland footballer Gerry Creaney was taken to court
by Portsmouth City Council yesterday, over the non-payment of one year's
council tax for his rented #200,000 home.
Creaney, 25, now a striker with First Division Portsmouth, where he
earns #2000 per week, could face an arrestment of his wages over the
outstanding #800, after magistrates made a liability order in favour of
the council.
A spokesman said: ''There are several options open to us in a case
like this, and one of them is an attachment of earnings order, which
allows us to collect the money owed to us directly from the wages of the
person concerned.''
If Creaney does not pay up, another course of action could entail a
visit to his marina home by bailiffs to seize goods to the value of
#800.
The #1.5m rated Creaney, who is expected to play for Portsmouth
against Reading today, was not available for comment last night.

A HARD-UP student cheated five members of a pools syndicate out of a
#2.3m fortune, a court heard yesterday.
Cameron Baxter, 27, pocketed the #5 stake money he had collected from
five ScottishPower workers instead of handing it over to Littlewoods.
The syndicate had the only winning line that week and would have won a
jackpot of more than #2.3m.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice-Clerk, will sentence Baxter at the High
Court in Glasgow on September 14 after he has studied background
reports.
The members of the Stirling syndicate -- Mr Gordon Turner, Mr John
Ferguson, Mr Donald McVean, Mr Richard Syme, and Mr Owen Kelly -- are
now considering taking legal proceedings against Littlewoods Pools.
Their lawyer, Mr Cameron Fyfe, said yesterday: ''My clients have
already indicated that they would consider taking civil proceedings
against the pools company once criminal proceedings against Mr Baxter
have been concluded.''
Yesterday at the High Court in Edinburgh, Baxter, of Wallace Street,
Stirling, admitted forming a fraudulent scheme to obtain football pools
stake money and to appropriate it to his own use.
While acting as a pools collector between July 24 and September 10
last year, Baxter pretended to various people in Stirling that he would
forward pools coupons and stake money on their behalf.
He induced them to hand over completed coupons and stake money
totalling #216, embezzled the cash and failed to deliver the stakes and
coupons to Littlewoods.
He thus deprived Mr Turner's syndicate of the #2.3m they would have
won.
Yesterday, Mr Donald Mackay, QC, Solicitor General, told Lord Ross
that Baxter was a student on a grant who stayed at home with his
parents.
For about three years before this offence came to light he was a
self-employed football pools agent with Littlewoods, for which he
received 12.5% of the stake money he collected.
Baxter called at Mr Turner's home at Cultenhove Road, St Ninians,
Stirling, on Thursday, September 8, last year to collect the coupon
which Mr Turner filled in every week on behalf of himself and his
workmates. He also collected the #5 stake money.
When he checked his coupon the following Monday, Mr Turner realised
that the syndicate had a possible winning line. He contacted Littlewoods
to make a claim but when the pools company searched for his coupon in
Glasgow, no trace of the coupon could be found.
When a Littlewoods investigator called on Baxter on September 13, the
accused, in the presence of his parents, admitted that he had been
withholding the syndicate's stake money for a number of weeks.
Baxter explained that he was short of cash because he was not
receiving his student grant during the summer recess.
He then left the room and returned to hand over a coupon in the name
of the Turner syndicate.
When that coupon was checked by Littlewoods staff it confirmed that it
did contain a winning line of 22 and a half points.
The Solicitor General continued: ''Littlewoods were also in a position
to confirm that had that coupon been received timeously it was the only
coupon that particular week with that number of points.
''Had it been received, Littlewoods would have paid out a jackpot win
and the sum the syndicate would have received was #2,318,311.''
Police investigations disclosed that over a six-week period Baxter had
received stake money from customers but failed to pass on the money and
coupons to Littlewoods.
Later the five men in the syndicate and their wives revealed that they
have been saving hard to raise the #35,000 needed to launch an action
against the pools giant in the civil court.
Syndicate member John Ferguson's wife, Mary, of John Davidson Drive,
Dunipace, Stirlingshire, said: ''Everyone was devastated when they
discovered the coupon had not been put on. At first, we thought all our
problems had been solved. Then bang. . . we had nothing.''
A Littlewoods spokeswoman said last night: ''Collectors are not
employed by Littlewoods. They are the agents of the client, not
Littlewoods.''
Around 70,000 people collect 300m Littlewoods coupons in the UK each
year.

A CLIMBER died last night after falling on Buchaille Etive Mor in
Glencoe.
Northern Constabulary police, who co-ordinated the rescue operation,
would not release the man's name until relatives had been informed.
Members of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team and an RAF Lossiemouth rescue
helicopter were involved in the search.
Last night, the climber's body was being taken off the mountain. It
will be taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness for a post-mortem
examination.
Meanwhile, hope was fading last night for a 46-year-old sailboarder
missing in the Solway Firth.
The man, believed to be a holidaymaker and inexperienced in the sport,
was spotted in difficulties two miles offshore in rough seas.
A spokesman for Liverpool Coastguard, which co-ordinated the search,
said he understood the man had been warned not to go out because
conditions were difficult. He had been surfing on his own.
The search in the area off Sandhead in Luce Bay, about 10 miles south
of Stranraer, last night involved a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter from
HMS Gannet at Prestwick, lifeboats from Portpatrick, Port William and
Stranraer, and 25 auxiliary coastguards.
The wind was about Force 5 when the man disappeared and there were
showers and a freshening wind.
A spokesman for Liverpool Coastguard said: ''If he is not found
quickly then we cannot hold out much hope although the search goes on.
We are hoping that he may have reached shore and so we have brought in
coastguard teams from Stranraer, Isle of Whithorn and Drummore.''

A MURDER trial ended in fury at the High Court in Airdrie yesterday,
after the accused was freed because of a lack of evidence.
Mr John McLean was formally acquitted of the charge of murdering Mr
Stephen Todd by stabbing him in the heart.
Last night, Mr Todd's widow Yvonne, 28, was at home with their four
sons, twins Sean and Stephen, 10, Scott, 7, and Martin, 5, trying to
come to terms with the outcome of the case.
Mr Todd's father Willie, 59, said: ''My son is dead and it has left my
four grandsons without a dad.
''It looks like no-one is going to be punished for this terrible
murder. My son did not stab himself in the heart.''
As the charges were formally dropped, there were shouts from the
victim's family in the public benches and police officers had to
intervene.
Mr Todd, 31, from Easterhouse Road, Easterhouse, Glasgow, died outside
a house in Abbotsford Drive, Hamilton, in April, where he had gone for a
drinking session with six other men.
The jury had been told that the accused had previously threatened to
''cut out his heart and liver'', because of a grudge dating back to an
earlier court case.
Yesterday, however, on the second day of the trial, the charge was
dropped by the Advocate-depute. Mr McLean, 22, was acquitted because the
libel was withdrawn.
He had denied the murder charge and another charge of breaching bail
conditions. His advocate, Mr Donald Findlay, QC, argued that the threat
claim had been made up by Mr Todd's brother William, 32, who gave
evidence during the trial.
Later, at her home in Whistleberry Crescent, Hamilton, Mr Todd's
mother Isobel, 53, said: ''I am devastated that my son could be killed
like this and no-one brought to justice. My grandsons are still asking
for their daddy.''

<HEADLINE>Labour urges Forsyth to rethink on water takeover</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976699649</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday urged Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to look
again at the Government's planned removal of water and sewerage services
from local authority control.
Depute Shadow Scottish Secretary John McFall said Mr Forsyth should
overturn the plan before Scots started having to ''pay for the
mistakes'' of the three new water authorities which will take over the
services in April next year.
His call came in the wake of the announcement by the West of Scotland
Water Authority that water charges were likely to rise by up to 15% next
year, and coincided with the release of a Labour survey claiming that
the private water companies south of the Border had cut investment in
supply by 20% in the last year.
Mr McFall said: ''In England and Wales, average water charges have
increased 77% while the private companies' investment in water supply
has decreased.
''In the past in Scotland, people have paid less for water because of
local authority investment. The local authorities have shown over the
years that they have been able to deliver clean, safe water in an
efficient and comparatively cheaper way than in England and Wales.
''If Forsyth listens to the people of Scotland, this exercise should
lead him to the conclusion that, in Scotland, public control through
local authorities with democratic accountability is the cheapest way to
deliver water.''
He urged the Scottish Secretary: ''Give back control of water to
elected local authorities before it is too late, and the people of
Scotland have to pay for the mistakes of the water quangos.''
All three of Scotland's water authorities face massive capital
spending programmes to meet stringent new EU and UK standards.
On Thursday, it emerged during the first meeting of the West of
Scotland Water Authority that charges in its area would probably
increase by between 10% and 15% next year and continue to rise over five
years at least, to help pay for the required improvements.
The East of Scotland authority has also indicated that charges will
have to rise but has not yet said by how much.
Charges are also expected to go up in the North of Scotland but Mr
David Chalmers, head of transfer administration for that water
authority, stressed yesterday that no decision had been taken yet by the
board.
The survey released by the Labour Party in London yesterday suggested
that the private water companies south of the Border were breaking
promises to the industry regulator by cutting investment in water
supplies in every region of England, in one case by as much as 41%.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said firms were trying to justify
higher prices on the basis of rising investment when, in fact,
investment was falling and customers' money was paying for record
profits and soaring directors' pay.
Labour said its figures showed that water companies had cut investment
in water supply by 20% in the last year and 30% over two years.
Investment in water and sewerage had fallen by #400m over the past year,
it claimed.
The firms were quick to hit back. Wessex said it had trebled its
investment this year to #13.5m. Thames said it had a five-year
investment programme agreed with the regulator, the Office of Water
Services,and many projects were being completed ahead of time. Southern
dismissed the allegations as nonsense.
Meanwhile, Yorkshire Water yesterday unveiled plans to supply
customers on a rota basis if the present drought gets worse.

DETECTIVES investigating the murder of Edinburgh woman Deirdre Kivlin,
whose decomposed body was found down a drain last week, have revealed
details of missing jewellery and a handbag which could be vital clues in
the hunt for her killer.
The 24-year-old was known to be fond of jewellery and eight pieces
belonging to her have still not been recovered in the murder
investigation.
The missing jewellery consists of a pearl necklace with half pearls on
a flat gold coloured backing, a Belcher gold coloured chain, and a thin,
16in gold-coloured chain with a heart-shaped locket.
A gold-plated three-bar gate bracelet with a padlock fastening and
safety chain, a necklace made up of three chains pleated together, and
three rings, one with a dark blue sapphire type stone, are missing.
Also missing is her black leather-look clutch bag which, police say,
would normally contain a plastic type wallet, a BT chargecard, lottery
tickets, a packet of Silk Cut cigarettes, and a disposable cigarette
lighter.

AN AIR-SEA rescue off the Ayrshire coast early yesterday saved eight
crew members of a French yacht competing in the Teacher's Round Britain
race.
A helicopter from HMS Gannet in Prestwick airlifted the five men and
three women from rocks near Turnberry Point. Largs and Girvan lifeboat
crews helped in the rescue.
An inquiry into the incident is under way. But back at the Scottish
race headquarters in Rothesay -- the end of the second leg of the
2100-mile Teacher's Round Britain Challenge -- the skipper of the yacht,
the Belle Helene, denied he had put his crew in any danger.
The boat, one of two French yachts competing in the five nations race,
got into difficulties when a force eight gale got up. According to
skipper Mr Jean Philipe Saliou, 27, a heavy squall hit her as she
rounded a buoy four miles offshore.
Mr Saliou, who said he had not made an error of judgment, added: ''We
were rounding one of the marker buoys between Ailsa Craig and Girvan,
about four miles offshore, with all our sails up. Just as we altered
course a huge squall hit us. The boat lost steerage and began drifting
towards the shore.
''By the time we had the spinnaker down and reefed in the mainsail, we
hit the rocks and had to send out emergency distress flares and a Mayday
call to the coastguard.
''There was no panic on board and we all managed to scramble off and
on to the rocks in safety. It was a superb rescue by the emergency
services and we thank them immensely.''
Race director Mr Alan Green, of the Royal Ocean Racing Club, said that
until an inquiry had taken place there was no indication whether any
disciplinary action would be taken against the skipper.

TWO tartan terrorists were jailed at the High Court in Stirling
yesterday for their part in a conspiracy to drive English people out of
Scotland with a campaign of threats and hoax letter bombs.
The plot was allegedly masterminded from Dublin by Adam Busby, the
exiled head of the Scottish National Liberation Army.
Terence Webber -- already serving a sentence of eight years in England
for an offence of rape -- was jailed for a further three years.
A jury of nine men and six women took just over an hour to find him
guilty of conspiracy to further the aims of the Scottish National
Liberation Army and the extreme nationalist group Flame and intending to
coerce the Government into granting independence for Scotland.
They convicted him of plotting to issue threats to kill, endanger life
and cause serious damage to property, and to dispatch hoax explosive
devices, all between January 1 and September 9, 1994.
They cleared him of actual participation in the hoax bombing of
Aberdeen Sheriff Court last September. They found, however, that he had
handled two walkie talkie radios and a battery charger used in the court
bomb hoax.
The verdict was unanimous. The judge, Lord McCluskey, ordered his
sentence to start on his release from his current sentence -- against
which Webber is appealing.
Kevin Paton, a former van driver, was jailed for 18 months after
admitting mailing hoax letter bombs and letters warning the English-born
Labour MP for Clydebank Tony Worthington to leave Scotland in 30 days or
die. Paton, 27, of Charles Gardens, Inverurie, had admitted trying to
further the aims of Flame during April 1994, but denied involvement with
the SNLA.
Lord McCluskey told Paton that there was no way he could have been
certain that the hoax letter bombs contained marzipan and not plastic
explosive. The court was told that bombs were mailed to Paton by the
SNLA chief in Dublin Adam Busby.
Paton, the judge said, had taken a ''huge risk'' by posting the
devices which could have been real bombs. Paton who had been on bail
until the sentence working as a site foreman in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and
Lerwick, looked shocked as the implications of the sentence sank in.
Webber, who was led away in handcuffs, told reporters cockily: ''Make
sure you spell my name right.''
It was by chance that Webber's criminal activities led to his
involvement in tartan terrorism and it was also by sheer chance that his
criminal activities led to his arrest and imprisonment.
Webber, a relatively articulate criminal, was inspired to fight to
''free Scotland from the shackles of Westminster'' when he shared a
prison cell with convicted terrorist Andrew McIntosh.
He was caught when, just seven hours after a hoax bomb had been placed
outside Aberdeen Sheriff Court, police raided his flat in the city's
Union Grove looking for stolen jewellery and an officer spotted
materials similar to those which had been used in the construction of
the device.
The court was told that Webber and Darren Brown, who had been in the
Aberdeen flat with him, were taken to Grampian Police headquarters in
Queen Street where a picture began to emerge of how the hoax bomb had
been planted.
Webber claimed that it was Brown who, wearing gloves, had constructed
the device out of toilet roll centres taped together, wiring, a Brillo
pad, chrome piping from a shower, a gas cannister, a dimmer switch, and
other bits and pieces in the first floor flat in Union Grove, Aberdeen,
which they had rented only a few days earlier.
He allegedly said that it was Brown who planted the device outside the
Sheriff Court in Union Street and he then used a walkie talkie, stolen
from industrial premises at Whitecairns outside Aberdeen some weeks
before to radio to Webber.
The court heard that Webber then telephoned the Samaritans and
newspapers to alert them of the device and it was he who had made the
telephone calls, because Brown has such a pronounced stutter. Brown, who
was released on bail, subsequently disappeared and his whereabouts are
unknown.
Webber's former cellmate, McIntosh was jailed for 12 years in December
1993, after being found guilty of conspiring to further the aims of the
Scottish National Liberation Army by criminal means by attempting to
coerce the Government to set up a separate government in Scotland.
He had sent three letter bombs and placed hoax bombs at the
headquarters of four Aberdeen-based oil companies and had posted hoax
letter bombs in Glasgow and Dundee.
Immediately after McIntosh's conviction, Adam Busby, the SNLA chief in
Dublin, sent out a communique pledging to escalate the armed struggle.
He suggested that the arms found in McIntosh's house were only a small
part of the cache in the North-east and there was plentiful ammunition.
He also claimed that there was a whole unit of the SNLA in the
North-east and they were actively recruiting.
It was Busby who was said to have sent Kevin Paton the hoax letter
bombs and threatening letters, which he then forwarded.
As well as the letter sent to the Labour MP Tony Worthington , hoax
letter bombs were also sent to people who had condemned the anti-English
activities of Scottish Watch and Settler Watch.
On the fourth day of the trial at Stirling, Paton changed his plea to
guilty of conspiring with another man, who had earlier been said to be
Busby, to further the cause of the group called Flame.
He also admitted posting hoax letter bombs with the intention of
driving the English out of Scotland and to intimidate those who spoke
out against extreme anti-English views, and to coerce advertisers not to
advertise properties for sale south of the Border.
His plea of not guilty to any involvement with the SNLA was accepted.
Busby, who lives in Dublin, would like the public to believe that the
SNLA is a well organised and thriving paramilitary group.
It seems more likely that Busby is skilful in persuading one of two
impressionable extremists to carry out sporadic campaigns which gain a
great deal of the publicity on which he thrives, and it is entirely
possible that Busby himself is the entire core of the SNLA.
His occasional foot soldiers, however, are not as good at retaining
their liberty as they are at carrying out their disruptive activities.
Busby bragged even after McIntosh was jailed that he would not have to
wait for long for attempts to free him.
Freelance journalist Andrew Scott is the co-author of the book
Britain's Secret War, which analysed the tartan terrorism of the 1980s
and he has maintained an interest in the subject. He said it was
important to differentiate between the SNLA and Flame, the anti-English
group to which Paton was allied.
He said that the SNLA first came to prominence in 1980 but by 1986
appeared to have disappeared. In 1993 McIntosh's trial thrust the SNLA
back into the limelight and then early in 1994, David Dinsmore, of
Falkirk, was sentenced to 240 hours' community service for sending a
letter bomb to the Earl of Mansfield at Scone Palace in May 1983.
Dinsmore fled to Ireland in 1983 with Busby and they both spent eight
months in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin, before being released after
extradition attempts failed. Dinsmore then remained on the run in Europe
and South America until he finally handed himself in to a bemused
British Consulate in Rio de Janeiro.
The Consulate asked him to give them a fortnight to sort out what
would happen and he was then returned to Scotland.
''With the exception of McIntosh's offences the majority of the
previous action has been in Central Scotland and especially West Central
Scotland,'' said Mr Scott.
''Flame, however, has definitely a North-east Scotland orientation and
arose directly from Settler Watch and perhaps also Scotland Watch which
were also orientated in the North-east. I think Flame is probably the
organisation which has been directly involved in the Stirling trial.''

ONE of Scotland's fastest-growing companies is to boost its workforce
by 250, with recruitment beginning at once.
Fullarton Computer Industries already employs around 1700 at nine
sites in Ayrshire and makes parts for the world's leading computer
manufacturers.
From small beginnings in Kilwinning, the company has grown to become a
leading supplier of terminal housings, keyboards, and other computer
parts to markets throughout the world.
It has already started to advertise for new employees in a variety of
manufacturing areas and is hopeful that the recruitment drive will be
completed within a matter of weeks.
Mr Alistair McKillop, personnel director for FCI, said: ''This is
great news for the company and has been brought about by increased
demand from our customers throughout the world.
''We are determined to meet that demand and will not be left behind in
the race for business.''

<HEADLINE>Final fire fight as troops leave Gorazde to Nato</HEADLINE>

THE British Army was last night evacuating its soldiers from the
UN-protected safe haven of Gorazde in Bosnia following an overnight fire
fight that left two intruders dead and one wounded.
One soldier from the Royal Welch Fusiliers on guard duty is believed
to have accounted for all three casualties following a failed assault on
the base.
He opened fire after the intruders attempted to push through a
perimeter fence, just hours before the British troops were about to pull
out.
The soldier shouted two challenges before a flare was sent up. They
shot at him, and he then opened fire.
UN spokesman Aleksander Ivanko described the attack as an ''act of
banditry''.
United Nations officials said the attack on the British would make it
harder to recruit a group of about 20 unarmed UN military observers
(UNMOs) who are scheduled to remain in the enclave once the British
troops leave.
''This (residual force) is entirely dependent upon troop contributing
nations coming forward to constitute an UNMO team,'' said UN spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Vernon.
''In light of what happened last night, clearly a far greater
disincentive has been put in their way to achieve that.''
Despite promises that Gorazde would remain a UN safe area, the
Fusiliers yesterday had withdrawn half their force of roughly 170 men
with the remainder to leave within the next three days.
They are taking their 39 Saxon armoured vehicles.
By last night, 87 UN personnel remained in Gorazde, including two
Ukrainians, four Norwegians and four UN military observers.
The previous night's attack on the base -- in all probability an
attempt to steal petrol or ammunition -- had not hampered the
withdrawal, the Ministry of Defence insisted.
The decision to push ahead with the withdrawal of UK troops from
Gorazde is seen as a serious blow to Bosnian Muslims.
They fear promises made at the recent London conference that Gorazde
would not be allowed to fall into Bosnian Serb hands might come to
nothing.
The UN conference had promised massive air strikes should this safe
haven come under attack.
According to the Ministry, the initial decision that the UK would not
replace the troops in the enclave was taken by Mr Malcolm Rifkind when
he was Secretary of State for Defence. It said that ruling had
subsequently been endorsed by his successor, Mr Michael Portillo.
On the incident at the base, the MoD said up to five individuals had
been involved. They wore a mixture of Bosnian army uniforms and civilian
clothes.
The attack was being being investigated by civilian and Bosnian
military police, an official said.
''It is possible they were just a small group of local hoods chancing
their arm to see what they could steal,'' an MoD spokesman said.
The Foreign Office said it ''deplored'' the attack, and said that in
the time left before they pulled out, the Fusiliers would mount a
''robust'' fightback against any further incursion.
''We expect the Bosnian Government to condemn it as well,'' said an
official from the Foreign Office.
Meanwhile, many Bosnian and even some UN officials are sceptical about
the willingness of the international community to use Nato air power to
protect Gorazde.
They point to the neighbouring havens of Srebrenica and Zepa which
were overrun by Serb forces in July while Nato did virtually nothing.
However, Lt-Col Vernon said: ''The method by which Gorazde will be
protected is by extensive use of Nato air power in a completely
different concept than has hitherto been the case. The main onus of the
new air planning is to hit wide, hard, extensively and
non-proportionately into very deep zones of action.''
The commitment to protect Gorazde has also been undermined by
persistent rumours that the new American peace plan involves the
Sarajevo Government surrendering the enclave to the Serbs in exchange
for territory around the capital.
Both Sarajevo and Washington deny it, but analysts question how peace
can be achieved if an island of Muslim territory survives in a sea of
Serb-held, ethnically cleansed, eastern Bosnia.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey told the Washington Post:
''This is a slow process of trying to undress Bosnia with dignity.
That's where we are. It's up to us to make the best of it.''
In an effort to reassure Muslims, in Bonn yesterday the German
Government told representatives of eight Islamic states about the West's
efforts to bring peace to Bosnia.
The Foreign Ministry's political director, Mr Wolfgang Ischinger,
briefed officials from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference's
(OIC) contact group on Bosnia.
It said the meeting was part of a Franco-German effort to strengthen
ties between the OIC group and the Contact Group of Britain, France,
Germany, Russia and the United States.
Both contact groups planned to meet at expert level in the next few
days, a statement said, adding that a meeting at Foreign Minister level
was also under consideration.
The Islamic states represented were Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Morocco,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Turkey.

A SCOTTISH rowing champion collapsed on the finish line at the World
Rowing Championships in Finland yesterday from an exercise-induced
asthma attack as he became a triple gold medallist.
Peter Haining, 33, became the first man to win the world lightweight
single sculls title three times in a row.
However, the sculler had to be lifted out of his boat by rescue
services and given oxygen before being transferred to the medical room.
The medal ceremony went on without him.
It was only later that Haining was able to explain his distress.
As an asthmatic, he normally uses an inhaler to clear his lungs 10
minutes before his normal scheduled race time. Yesterday, he
accidentally dropped the inhaler while climbing into his boat.
His coach, Miles Forbes Thomas, realised the problem as soon as
Haining had left the staging and asked another finalist, American
sculler James Martinez, to give Haining the inhaler on the way to the
start. Although Martinez took the inhaler, he failed to pass it on.
Meanwhile, the British team passed Haining another inhaler at the
starting line but although he asked for a delay, the Scot was not given
enough time for the inhaler to take effect.
''I knew it was going to hurt and I could feel my lungs burning with
400m to go. I just concentrated on keeping it going to the line,'' he
said later.
He added: ''I suffer from sports-induced asthma, so when I push myself
it causes problems.''
Haining led the race the whole way into a strong headwind. Martinez,
the American, finished out of the medals.
Later, the Scot revealed that he had been inspired to make his
record-breaking win by a fax sent by another Scottish champion sculler,
Rorie Henderson, who quoted the text from the Scottish runner Eric
Liddell's gravestone: ''They shall mount up with wings as eagles and
they shall run and not be weary.''

<HEADLINE>Opening for Forsyth on Skye bridge</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth will open the #23m Skye toll
bridge, breaking the tradition in which members of the royal family
perform such ceremonies.
Mr Forsyth will ''supervise'' the opening in ''mid-October'' which
will be performed by a local primary pupil who will have won a
competition organised by the bridge builders Miller/Dywidag. However,
the Minister's involvement in the ceremony will anger many islanders.
The Government decided some time ago that its flagship of private
sector road building should be opened by a Conservative Minister rather
than a member of the royal family.
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said last night that she had no idea
if a member of the royal family had been asked to perform the ceremony.
''You will have to ask those who are organising it,'' she added.
When asked why Mr Forsyth had been chosen, a Scottish Office spokesman
said: ''Because he was invited by the bridge builders.''
A spokeswoman for Miller Dywidag and the Skye Bridge Company, which
will operate the bridge and collect the highest tolls in Europe of more
than #5, agreed: ''We did invite Mr Forsyth. As long as I have been
associated with the project it was always going to be a ministerial
opening.
''It has been a Scottish Office show from the start. They would have
decided if they wanted a member of the royal family.
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, last
night said:''There is a very limited number of people who could perform
the ceremony without the words sticking in their throats. But I am sure
Mr Forsyth will have no difficulty in justifying the imposition of this
high toll bridge on the people of Skye.''
She added: ''He is always going on about the extra taxes that other
parties are proposing in their policies, so maybe he could tell us why
he is so much in favour of the extra taxes that everybody here will have
to pay.''
It is traditional for major bridge projects to be opened by a member
of the royal family: for example, the Forth road bridge was opened by
the Queen; the Tay road, Kingston, Kessock, and Dornoch bridges were all
opened by the Queen Mother and the Erskine bridge was opened by the then
Princess Anne in 1971.

Belfast.
THE latest move by the Government to bolster the peace process in
Northern Ireland has been derided by both sides, but for opposite
reasons.
Around 100 prisoners, serving sentences for terrorist offences, are
expected to be released within a year and many more could also be set
free long before their jail terms are complete.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew announced his plans
yesterday in a keynote speech at Queen's University, Belfast, which
reviewed almost one year of peace in Ulster.
However, Unionists reacted angrily, claiming more unwarranted
concessions were being given to terrorists: Sinn Fein said the release
of prisoners was ''too little, too late''.
The IRA ceasefire will be one year old next Friday, and the Government
was hoping yesterday's proposals would help to sustain the Ulster peace
into a second year.
However, the crucial issue of decommissioning terrorist weapons
remains unresolved, and significantly no reference was made in Sir
Patrick's speech to an international commission to oversee a reduction
in weaponry.
The omission underlines differences which still exist between the
British and Irish governments on this issue. Though Ulster Unionists are
critical about the release of prisoners, they are also relieved the
Government is refusing to concede that political talks involving Sinn
Fein can take place without agreement on decommissioning.
Sir Patrick stood firm on demanding that there had to be a start on
the decommissioning of IRA weapons before doors would be opened.
He said the Government was not seeking a surrender by the IRA in the
handing over of weapons: it was not a question of ''victory or defeat''.
However, he said nothing was more calculated to undermine confidence
in a talks process than the fear that one side or the other, if it did
not get its own way at the negotiating table, would resort to force of
arms.
There was one glimmer of hope on the arms issue. The Combined Loyalist
Military Command (CLMC), the umbrella group for loyalist paramilitaries,
indicated last night it would decommission its weapons if the IRA did.
On the prisons issue, Sir Patrick said he was not proposing an
amnesty, nor was it ''an emptying of the jails''. He said the
legislation he envisaged would carry a condition that those released
early must remain of good behaviour until two-thirds of their sentences
had elapsed, or they could be recalled to jail.
But the main deadlock still exists between the Government and Sinn
Fein and Sir Patrick gave no sign yesterday of any breakthrough.
It now seems unlikely that the arms matter will be resolved before the
anniversary, if at all, although London and Dublin are still searching
for an agreement which they would hope to reveal when Mr Major and Irish
Prime Minister John Bruton hold a summit meeting early next month.
Sir Patrick's move yesterday was an attempt to break the negotiating
logjam by restoring the 50% remission to terrorists who had been
convicted since it was reduced in 1989 to 33%.
More than 1000 are serving sentences for terrorist offences in Ulster
jails: 498 republicans and 544 loyalists. Those responsible for the very
worst atrocities are not included in the remission scheme.
Among the 100 prisoners involved in the early release scheme will be
as many loyalists as republicans. However, the move falls far short of
the general amnesty which both loyalist and republican groups are
seeking in the future.
Sinn Fein party chairman, Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, claimed the prison
concession would still leave two-thirds of republican prisoners in jail
in the year 2000.
The Ulster Unionist party security spokesman, Mr Ken Maginnis, said
Government policy seemed to be a series of short-term tactics designed
to do no more than achieve a temporary extension of the ceasefire.
Democratic Unionist party spokesman, former Belfast Lord Mayor Sammy
Wilson, said Sir Patrick could not hide the fact that he had made
another surrender to IRA demands and given terrorists an amnesty by the
back door.
The fringe loyalist political parties gave a broad welcome to the
announcement as a first step in the right direction.
Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam welcomed the remission
increase but said she had written to the Government seeking an assurance
that should violence resume those let out would be recalled to jail.
Sir Patrick also announced a review of policing in Ulster and of the
emergency legislation which has been in existence for more than 20
years.

SCOTTISH Office Minister George Kynoch has cleared the Morrison Group,
whose chairman Fraser Morrison also chairs Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, of any suggestion that it has had an improper advantage over
proposals to build the new North of Scotland Water Authority
headquarters in Inverness.
In a statement issued late last night, Mr Kynoch said that ''the
factual reports'' he had commissioned into the circumstances surrounding
the decision to locate the authority in Inverness confirmed that
Morrison Development had ''no inside track''.
His inquiry, launched on Wednesday, followed a report by The Herald
detailing claims that the Morrison Group knew what was in the brief for
the #2m-plus contract to establish the new authority in Inverness before
it was sent out to competitors.
It was claimed that when the new water authority, chaired by Mr John
Robertson, the Highland Health Board chairman and an HIE member since
1991, approached HIE for appropriate firms to discuss the HQ's coming to
Inverness, the only name suggested was Morrison.
Mr Kynoch last night expressed his ''complete confidence'' in both Mr
Morrison and Mr Robertson, and said he deplored any attempts to
denigrate them.
Earlier this week Labour's industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said
conflict of interest was inherent in Mr Morrison's chairmanship of HIE
and Mr Robertson's chairmanship of the water authority and his
membership of the HIE board. He called for an inquiry and for the two
men to consider resigning.
The Herald's report on Wednesday said that it was understood that HIE
had made a presentation to the water authority exclusively promoting
Morrison and that as a result Morrison Development was able to lodge a
planning application at Inverness division planning office on August 11
which fitted the water authority's brief, right down to car parking
spaces and a three-car garage.
That application was for a site owned by Morrison and near to Highland
Regional Council's water and sewerage department.
It was also claimed that other Highland competitors did not receive
the brief or the invitation to tender until August 14 and were told to
submit proposals by August 16.
The decision to locate in Inverness, and not elsewhere in the
authority's area, was announced on August 8 when the authority first
met.
Last night Mr Kynoch said it was clear from the reports he had
commissioned that ''standing procedures to prevent conflicts of interest
operated in the HIE to ensure that Mr Fraser Morrison, as chairman of
HIE, and other board members had no knowledge of HIE's dealings with the
water authority or Morrison Development''.
He said that the first approaches to Morrison Development had been
made by Highland Regional Council to develop indicative costings to help
the water authority reach a decision on the comparative costings and
benefits of an Inverness headquarters location compared with others in
the Highlands and elsewhere.
Similar requests for indicative costings had also gone to developers
in Grampian and Tayside, said Mr Kynoch.
''The reports show that there was no question of Morrison's having an
inside track. The water authority will decide at its September meeting
when to go to formal tender and open competition. It will be for
Morrison Development to decide whether they wish to tender.
''I have every confidence that both Highlands and Islands Enterprise
and the North of Scotland Water Authority have acted properly in the
highly competitive business of considering the claims of various
locations for the headquarters development.
''I deplore the attempts to denigrate Mr Fraser Morrison, who is a
distinguished, hard-working and successful chairman of HIE, and Mr John
Robertson, the chairman of the North of Scotland Water Authority, who
has a similarly distinguished record of public service in the Highlands.
I have complete confidence in them both,'' he added.
When The Herald read Mr Kynoch's statement to Mr Morrison last night,
he said he was ''very pleased''. He added: ''Obviously, it is what I had
anticipated would be the outcome.''
Mr Wilson last night expressed surprise at the speed with which Mr
Kynoch's investigation had been completed, and said he would be pressing
for a fuller inquiry.
