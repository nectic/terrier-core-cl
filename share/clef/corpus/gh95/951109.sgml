STOW College's vocational training is partly funded by the European
Social Fund through the Strathclyde European Partnership. This fund
allows the college to assist the nemployed inclding the educationally
disadvantaged to find new routes to permanent employment, ths
contributing to the regeneration of the West of Scotland economy.
The college aims to provide its students with training relevant to the
European job market, and the European Dimension has been introduced into
the curriculum. All full-time students are encouraged to study a foreign
language, and links have been established with similar institutions in
France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy and Finland. Computing and
electrical students have worked on exchange projects with their
counterparts in France and Denmark, with funding from the the european
Lingua action programme.
Staff from Stow and its partner colleges in Europe have made a number
of reciprocal visits. And there has been collaboration on a number of
projects, as well as exchange visits by both staff and students. It
seems a workmanlike way of achieving breadth and understanding of the
training and marketplace which exists in the wider European community,
and which may open up jobs in the future.
In a competitive marketplace, Stow College must keep the edge on its
own development through the creation of different courses, tailored to
meet the needs of employers of today. Within the Engineering School, an
interesting example has been the Music Technology course, offered with
or without electronics, depending on the qualification, which ranges
from National Certificate through Higher National Certificate, or Higher
National Diploma, to an ordinary BSc in third year, the degree validated
by Glasgow Caledonian University.
The destinations of those who successfully complete these courses may
be the music recording business or perhaps programme production with,
for example, the BBC, explains Professor Snaith. ''Or,'' he says, ''many
may finish up in the recording business, or in large or small studios
anywhere in the land. The course mushroomed from very modest beginnings
through the development of the HNC, and it grew at that time very much
in association with the Royal Scottish Academy.
''We provided and still do, electronics teaching to their students,
and we get instruction in musical notation from the Academy for our
music students. We also get assistance from the BBC and the Royal
Concert Hall.''
In the very changed sphere of engineering, where Stow has always been
well respected, the college has retained teaching of this broad
discipline, bringing to it the new challenges of today. Alongside the
Mechanical and Civil engineering sits the more frequently required
Electrical and Electronic engineering; employers' needs are constantly
listened to, and training courses designed to meet their requirements.
In the past few years there has been significant growth in the number
of stdents entering the management and computing fields. Science too has
experienced an upsurge in interest in the medical sciences area.
''Our board of governors,'' says Professor Snaith, ''is made up very
largely of industrial and commercial people, because they know what
their industries require in training terms, and are absolutely on top of
modern requirements. They will guide us as to where we ought to be
going.''
Depute principal, Bob McGrory, sums up by saying: ''We want Stow
College to be a really friendly and welcoming place where students
receive a quality learning experience in a quality environment which
will assist them to fulfil their potential.

TODAY'S private hospitals might be described as simply continuing a
tradition which goes back to long before thoughts of a National Health
Service.
At that time, health care was provided, in the main, by either local
authority hospitals, private nursing homes or voluntary hospitals. The
latter were financed by collections or donations or by contributory
schemes which entitled subscribers to their services.
In Glasgow, the Royal Infirmary, which opened in l794, was the only
voluntary hospital in the city until the Western Infirmary was
established in l874, followed by the Victoria Infirmary in l890.
The city's first private hospital, in the present meaning of the word,
was Bon Secours, which opened in l960. Today the list of Scottish
private hospitals or NHS hospitals with a dedicated private unit is
around thirty-strong in a network stretching from Aberdeen and Edinburgh
to Stirling and Ayrshire.
A statistical breakdown of the private sector's contribution to UK
health and hospital services claims that there are now over 22O private
acute hospitals which can provide more than ll,000 beds.
Today about l8% of all non-emergency surgery is carried out in the
private sector, including 20% of all heart surgery and 30% of hip
replacements.
Other services available in the private sector include health
screening services for both men and women as part of a long list which
includes sports injury clinics, plastic surgery and orthopaedics.
Numerous diagnostic, medical and surgical procedures can also be carried
out.

FRANCHISE manager for Land Rover and Jaguar, Motherwell is Gordon
McMillan, who operates from the custom-built Knowetop showroom opened in
the late 80s. There the Solihull-built machines rub shoulders with their
near-neighbours from Coventry.
''The marques sit well together,'' he says. ''There is a certain
amount of crossover, with one member of a family driving Land Rover
while another has a Jaguar.''
The well-publicised economic situation prevailing in the former steel
centre hasn't had the expected adverse effect on either product.
''What we are seeing here now is that many successful small businesses
have been established in the area and their principals are drawn to the
vehicles we sell,'' said Gordon.
''They tend to cover high mileages on business and look for both
comfort and reliability.
''When the Range Rover changed in 1994 there were some who professed
not to like it, but it took just a few weeks before they conceded that
the changes had been for the better and that the car was even better
value than before.''
A unique piece of British motoring history will draw to a close with
the Range Rover Classic Anniversary Final Edition.
Just 25 will be built, all based on the Vogue SE, each individually
numbered and carrying a commemoration plaque on its facia.
Powered by the 3.9 litre V8 petrol engine developing 181 bhp, the
Anniversary model is finished in Oxford blue metallic paintwork, with
chrome bumpers and distinctive badging on the front wings.
Interiors are finished in beige with leather seat facings and have
been topped off with a superior stereo radio system with CD player.
Priced at #40,000 the Classic is designed in extrovert style, with
special body graphics, part leather trim, dished alloy wheels and white
lettered 235 tyres -- and you can have it in both 2.5 diesel and 3.9 V8
petrol versions.
''On a long journey, with four or five people on board, stress is kept
to an absolute minimum. This is what sets Range Rover and Land Rover
apart from other modes of transport. And then, of course, you have its
tremendous off-road capability as and when required.''
But don't forget the Defender. As Gordon points out: the vehicle that
has sold over 1.5 million units world wide is still the toughest and
most affordable of rugged workhorses.

Annual capital growth for Scottish property investment slowed to 1.4%
during the year to October 1995 - down from 1.5% the previous month,
according to the Richard Ellis Scottish Monthly Index which is prepared
exclusively for The Herald. With the retail and industrial sectors
producing 3.4% and 0.9% annual capital growth respectively (results
which are very similar to last month's rates), the slower rate of growth
is solely attributable to the office sector which saw capital growth
reduce from 0.6% to 0.3%.
There was no rental growth during the month in the office and retail
sectors, but industrial rental values increased marginally by 0.2%. In
annual terms all three sectors continued to show positive rental growth
of 0.7% for industrials, 0.2% for offices and 1.2% for shops.
No significant shifts in yields were seen during this month and All
Property total returns stand at 0.9%, with movements in returns in all
three sectors. Due to office annual capital growth declining, this
sector produced a reduced total return of 8.1% t o the end of October.
Marginal movements were seen in industrial from 10.2% to 10.1% and
retail from 9.4% to 9.5%.

James Currie traces Taggarts' roots from a small cycle shop to one of
Scotland's largest car dealerships.
DESCRIBING any organisation as the oldest of its kind in the country
is a process fraught with danger as, no matter how extensive the
research, it will inevitably be contradicted as soon as it appears in
print.
So no such claims will be made for the Taggarts Motor Group, which is
about to commence its 100th year of trading. It is safe to say, however,
that in Scotland perhaps only two motor dealerships are older -- and not
by much -- so there is ample reason for celebration at the group's
Motherwell headquarters.
The car itself was only in its infancy when Taggarts was formed. Karl
Benz had built his first working version in 1885, with near neighbour
Gottleib Daimler following suit a year later.
Just three years before Taggarts opened its doors, Henry Ford had
assembled the first American petrol-driven car, an initiative followed
up by a 37-year-old Scots-American Andrew Winton, who produced the first
large American passenger cars in 1897.
Ford was later to become chief engineer at the Detroit Automobile
Company, which only managed to sell five cars in the space of two years
and then went spectacularly bankrupt. He became involved in the rescue
package, secured a significant slice of its stock, which he subsequently
sold before setting up his own company and went on to pioneer the mass
production techniques credited with making the industry what it is
today.
Elsewhere people were preoccupied with other matters. And 1896 saw the
founding of the Canadian Red Cross, Madagascar was declared a French
colony and the city of Miami consisted of just three houses.
We were also seeing our first automobile accidents. In the state of
Ohio, just two motor cars were registered -- and somehow or other they
managed to collide. In this country Queen Victoria had been on the
throne for 56 years and the Marquess of Salisbury was Prime Minister.
It was a time of massive social and industrial change. Britain was at
the height of her powers as a world force, a country where massive
private wealth contrasted sharply with the grim conditions endured by
the vast majority of the population. Even having a ''good'' job was not
enough to guarantee an escape from the shackles of poverty.
Whether coincidentally or directly influenced by it, Britain's
standard of living slowly began to improve with the spread of the motor
car.
Famous names were born. In 1895 The first Wolesley car was built by
the curiously named Wolesley Sheep Shearing Company, whose designer,
Australian-born Herbert Austin, gave it a two-cylinder opposed
air-cooled engine.
The first Austin didn't break cover until 1905, beaten to the
showrooms by the Lanchester Engine Company's offering. It was the first
British-built four-wheel gasoline-powered vehicle and it featured
epicyclic gearing, worm drive and pneumatic tyres. The relentless
process of technical innovation and refinement was already under way.
This is what attracted James Taggart and his friend, Robert McMillan,
into business. Like so many who subsequently became motor traders, they
started with a cycle shop, in this instance at the lower end of
Motherwell's Brandon Street.
As the business expanded, they moved twice. On each occasion it was
further up the hill until they settled on its crest, at Knowetop.
Robert McMillan stayed on for just four years before emigrating to
South Africa and being replaced by Alex Taggart. The name of the
business changed to Taggart Brothers and motor cycle franchises joined
the existing cycle agencies.
In fact it wasn't until 1904 that the brothers took a serious interest
in cars, purchasing a used single-cylinder Argyll. It was joined by a
two-cylinder Simms, a three-cylinder Calthorpe and then a four-cylinder
St Vincent, an Aster-engined tourer built by William McLean, of North
Street in Glasgow.
Oddly enough it wasn't until two years later that the brothers
recorded their first sale, a 10hp Humber to a gentleman by the name of
Alex Stirling. Until then they had hired out their stock, but the
business quickly prospered until in 1910 a piece of adjacent ground at
Knowetop was leased and a garage built on the site.
Tom Taggart joined his brothers that same year and the first major
contracts were signed, Taggarts taking on agencies for Arrol-Johnston
and Darracq.
Like all of their contemporaries in the trade, the Taggart brothers
had their attention diverted by the Great War, switching to Government
contracts.
In 1919 new showrooms and a workshop were added and Taggarts secured a
dealership to sell Austin and Rover cars in Lanarkshire. It was an
opportune time to restructure as a private limited company.
This required an injection of fresh capital, provided by a group of
Johnstone businessmen headed by the machine tool manufacturer, Sir
William B Lang. A period of expansion followed, with a showroom being
opened in Glasgow's Bothwell Street. Other city premises were
established in the Broomielaw and Kilbirnie Street. The company even
acquired a new name, North British Motor Traders Limited.
The period between the wars was one of solid progress. North British
Motor Traders became Glasgow dealers for Singer and Armstrong-Siddeley.
But it was never easy. At that time most motorists (and motor cars),
were unable to cope with severe winter weather, so their vehicles went
into hibernation throughout the months from November until March. A drop
in sales, together with little demand for parts or repairs put extra
stresses on the structure of the business, but James Taggart somehow or
other managed to find something for his skilled workforce to do, rather
than pay them off to cut costs.
Then came the Second World War and once again peace-time work was
shelved as the company threw itself into a variety of War Office
projects, including the manufacture of tank plates and parts for Bailey
bridges. There was no shortage of work now, with the garage on double
shift working as it served as a repair depot for Army vehicles.
Another period of expansion followed the cessation of hostilities.
Commercial vehicle business was added to that of private cars and
established in Motherwell under John Clark, a motor engineer who had
served in the Royal Air Force.
A rationalisation process in Glasgow saw the Bothwell Street showroom
being given up (but there were plans to re-establish it at a later
date), and the Blue Line service station in Pollokshaws Road being taken
over as the main depot for Armstrong-Siddeley and Singer.
Although spare parts were still being sold from the Broomielaw,
business proved to be better in Lanarkshire than in the city until, in
1954, a decision was taken to pull out of Glasgow and consolidate the
company's position in Lanarkshire.
It had previously (1935), undergone another name change, to Taggarts
(Motherwell) Limited. A subsidiary company, Taggarts (Glasgow) Limited
was taken over by Armstrong-Siddeley and the money Taggarts received
from the sale was ploughed into the purchase of the house and grounds
adjoining the Knowetop garage. James C Taggart personally designed
extensive additions to the showrooms and offices and these were
officially opened in July 1959 by Mr Jim Penrose, sales director for the
Austin Motor Company.
Sadly neither James nor Tom Taggart were there to see all of their
plans come to fruition. James had died in 1955, Tom in 1958 and the
links with the founding family were stretched again when James C Taggart
died in 1966, a few days after the company was appointed Austin
distributors for Lanarkshire.
At this point in the story it is worth pointing out that Tom Taggart
was rather more than a skilled motor engineer. He was also an inventor
with a number of patents to his credit, principally connected with his
work on carburettors, adjustable windscreen joints -- and even a
collapsible caravan which could be carried on a car roof.
Taggarts had operated for a number of years as main dealers under
Carlaw (Cars) Ltd. Austin held a massive share of the UK market,
frequently hitting 40% of all new car sales in this country, so
switching from main dealer to distributor was an important and exciting
development.
Sales increased steadily, leading to the opening of a new showroom at
Knowetop. The offices were again extended and the former Knowetop House
became an integral part of the headquarters building.
The whole of the share capital of Murray Garage (East Kilbride)
Limited was acquired that same year and the company became retail
dealers for Daimler cars.
By 1968 Carluke Motors was taken over. This was a key move as until
then the company had no dealer representation in that part of the county
and it was followed into the group by West End Garage, Airdrie, formerly
R&amp;W Allan Limited, an established business that had been allowed to run
down. It became Taggarts (Airdrie) Ltd.
The history of Taggarts' first 75 years concluded with the directors
laying plans for yet more acquisitions and expansion, notably in East
Kilbride. Now firmly established as one of the most important companies
of its type in the West of Scotland -- and with 330 people on the
payroll -- it held distributorships for Austin, Wolseley and MG.
Given the structure of the UK motor industry in the seventies, the
perceived strength of this grouping provided the perfect launchpad from
which to do all of this and more.
But in a volatile industry about to enter a lengthy period of
increased competition, lower margins and higher customer expectations, a
shift in direction would soon be required -- and some of the people who
would see this through over the next 25 years had already joined the
staff.
At your service: a fleet of break-down wagons and support vehicles
line up at the Motherwell depot in years gone by.

In this eight-page supplement, James Currie looks at 100 years of
motoring with Taggarts.
ALTHOUGH it took some time for Taggarts and Daimler to be drawn
together, both companies found themselves in celebratory mood this month
-- and for exactly the same reason.
Daimler, Britain's oldest surviving car marque, is just about to
celebrate its 100th birthday.Formed in January 1896, it produced the
very first cars for sale in the UK, with a two-cylinder, 6 hp engine
claimed to be capable of 12mph on level ground.
The Century commemorative edition, launched this month, is rather more
capable. Based on the Daimler Double Six, it can be identified by its
chromed Turbine alloys, chrome body side mouldings and discreet
gold-on-black badging on its front wings, bootlid and wheels.
Daimlers have always been a byword for luxury and this one is no
exception. Lots of deep leather, polished wood, lambswool rugs and a
massively specified Harman Kardon Premium audio system are a small part
of the inventory. Just 200 Century models are to be built.
Sixty years ago, on September 24, 1935, 33-year-old William Lyons,
founder and sole owner of SS Cars, took the wraps off the SS Jaguar
2.5-litre and a legend was born. The asking price was just #385, and the
policy of ''more for less'', one of Jaguar's most effective marketing
weapons, was introduced.
Jaguar sales hit an all-time record in Germany in July. Exports to
Europe's biggest luxury car market jumped by 343%, giving the
British-based manufacturer its best month since exports to Germany
started in 1930.
Worldwide sales in July were up 68% over 1994 figures. The biggest
market for the car is the United States, where sales have improved by
30% over the first seven months of the year.
Brian Herlihy is general manager Glasgow Jaguar at Taggarts, Maryhill
Road, and he agrees that positive progress is being made.
''We have been delighted with the quality of the cars we are selling
which, without any doubt, is more than a match for those produced by the
other top manufacturers in this market sector.
''Jaguar was one of the first manufacturers to extend its warranty to
60,000 miles and now this can be extended right up to 100,000 miles.
This in itself reflects the confidence both manufacturer and dealers
have.''
Any vehicles that do come in for fettling are well looked after by a
service team who describe themselves as Jaguar enthusiasts first and
foremost. Incidentally, the department must boast the highest percentage
in the country of master technicians among its staff.
Brian and his staff are inviting owners of rival marques to drop off
their cars during the Scottish Motor Show at the SECC.
''They can have them valeted here, and we will chauffeur drive them to
the Show in a Jaguar, free of charge,'' he said.
With an XJS replacement due next year, the already healthy sales graph
looks like continuing.
''But take a look at the outgoing model,'' says Brian, ''and consider
that it has been, albeit with significant underbonnet changes, around
for almost 20 years and it still turns heads.

ONE of the best-known names in the Scottish Motor Trade, Taggarts of
Motherwell, is about to step into its second century of trading, and it
is currently finishing work on a #1.5m rebuilding programme by way of
celebration.
Two new showrooms, housing Renault and Rover, are now operational at
Motherwell. Work is under way on an adjacent site to create a group
bodyshop and a two-storey service and parts facility.
When all of this is finished, owners JN Holdings will have one of the
most up-to-date, streamlined and efficient group of franchises in
Scotland.
Taggarts has come a long way since it was founded by James Taggart and
his friend, Robert McMillan, a hundred years ago.
Both were engineers to trade, but McMillan had also been president of
Motherwell Cycling Club, so he was sure that if the partners opened a
cycle shop in the town it would be well supported.
He was proved correct, and although he left for South Africa before
the business really took off, the foundations had been well and truly
laid and a remarkable story was about to unfold.
It is chronicled in this supplement, together with an appraisal of
where the company stands today in an exciting, highly competitive and
demanding business environment.
As chairman and managing director Joe Nimmo says: ''It is gratifying
to consider yourself a part of the Scottish motor industry's history --
and challenging to be its custodian.''

RENAULT was the first new franchise secured under chairman Joe Nimmo's
stewardship of Taggarts. This month the dealership moves from
old-fashioned premises in Bellshill to a bright new showroom at Knowetop
in Motherwell.
The shift, according to franchise manager, Jim Doran will be of
benefit to customers and staff.
He points out that the new premises are only a few miles away,
minimising any initial inconvenience to the former, but the greatly
improved benefits offered by the new facilities will enable him to
provide customers with a better, more efficient service.
Certainly Renault is on something of a roll at the moment. Its
ever-popular Clio took 3% of the total UK market during the vital August
registration period, notching up more than 12,000 orders.
And such has been the stampede for the special edition Clio Oasis that
Renault has churned out an extra 4000 models to meet a huge order book.
Two of the stars of the Scottish Motor Show will be the Renault Megane
and Sport Spider.
The Megane is the long-awaited replacement for the 19 series, which
didn't quite achieve the same success in this country as it did on the
Continent, where it took up permanent residence in the best-seller's
table.
On display will be versions of the Megane five-door hatchback and
two-door coupe, the first two models to go on sale here next spring.
Later we will get a saloon, Monospace people carrier, and cabriolet to
complete the line-up.
Renault say the Megane represents a new concept in family car design.
Although all models will share the same nose, from that point backwards
each will have a unique style and shape, appealing to a very different
target audience.
What the designers have intended is a range that will repeat the way
in which the Clio brought large car comfort and refinement to the small
car sector. The Megane is packaged to do the same, with levels of
comfort, quietness and refinement that will break new ground in its
class.
The Megane is distinguished by a whole range of innovative touches,
including ''intelligent'' windscreen wipers which automatically slow
down when the car decelerates and a rear wiper which turns on when
reverse gear is selected.
For the driving enthusiast, the arrival of the Sport Spider will
generate the same kind of excitement that greeted Rover's MGF.
The Spider is a true driver's car with its light, aluminium chassis
and composite material panels meaning the engine can get on with the job
of whisking the car up to its top speed of 130mph quicker than most
supercars.
That trusty Clio Williams 2-litre engine provides all this energy for
a vehicle that has been described as ''virtually a single-seater car for
two'', reminiscent of former racing roadsters.
On the mainstream front the French giant's hopes of competing with
powerful contenders from Ford, Vauxhall and Citroen rest on the Laguna
Estate, a vehicle which earlier this year made a surprise appearance at
Barcelona as a concept car.
''If the Megane comes up to expectations -- and we believe it will --
then this model could account for around 30% of our Renault sales,
competing as it will be against the Escort and Astra, two older and less
flexible designs.''

HIBERNIAN'S premier division match against Partick Thistle was called
off 15 minutes after the scheduled kick-off time last night, when an
electrical fault caused chaos at Easter Road.
Several hundred spectators were in the ground when the fault occurred,
and many more stayed outside in queues while stadium staff tried to keep
hopes for the match alive.
However, although the floodlights were operating perfectly when those
who had paid departed, a decision on safety grounds was taken to hold
the match over in case the fault developed again.
''We had hoped there would have been another chance to try and rectify
things, but with eight to nine thousand people outside, the police were
clearly getting concerned,'' said chairman Douglas Cromb.
No date has yet been fixed but it is likely to be confirmed with the
Scottish League today that Thistle will return to Easter Road on
Wednesday, November 22.
* THE Celtic v Manchester United testimonial match for Paul McStay has
been rearranged for Tuesday, December 12.
The game was originally scheduled for the following evening, but has
been brought forward because of England's friendly with Portugal at
Wembley the next evening.

* JACK Charlton has invoked the FIFA five-day rule for the first time
in his 10 years as the Republic of Ireland's manager to ensure that his
squad is not deprived of more top players for next Wednesday's crucial
European Championship qualifier in Portugal.
As a result, seven players are banned from turning out for their clubs
this weekend. Those affected are Motherwell forward Tommy Coyne, Celtic
goalkeeper Pat Bonner, Marseille striker Tony Cascarino, Portsmouth
midfielder Alan McLoughlin, Sheffield United goalkeeper Alan Kelly,
Crystal Palace midfielder Ray Houghton, and Norwich midfielder Mick
Milligan.
''I don't like doing this, but with all the injuries we have at the
minute, I have no other option,'' said Charlton.

WHEN Land Rover moved out of Maryhill Road, Nissan moved in, the
reasoning being that a volume franchise was needed to cover the market
under the adjacent Jaguar marque.
It was a move that had the rest of the Scottish motor trade scratching
its head in wonderment, but the past few years have shown it to be a
shrewd assessment of the prevailing market.
Franchise manager Douglas Robertson says the strength of Nissan lies
in the depth and versatility of the range.
''We've got people carriers, pick-ups, light commercials, 4x4s,
saloons, hatchbacks and everything else in between. The range satisfies
all the requirements of our target customers, and this has been
reflected in the sales figures we are achieving,'' he said.
Keeping in touch with customers is given a very high priority at the
dealership, hence this month's fashion show, complete with showroom
catwalk. An Almera launch was held at Firhill, and the dealership is
pairing with Scottish Auto Trader to provide a Micra as a choice of
prize in a simple show quiz.
The car will be displayed on the Auto Trader stand, so get your
intellect in gear -- we are told it is a simple question -- and try your
luck!
Meanwhile Douglas will be happily contemplating an increase in
business generated by the all-new Almera, which is in the Glasgow
showroom now.
A departure from the company's established ''softly, softly'' image,
the car is pitched directly at younger buyers and features some
impressive hand-me-downs from the flagship QX range.
This means sparkling handling and an excellent ride courtesy of
QX-style multi-link beam rear suspension.
The first cars to be sold here are the three and five-door versions. A
saloon, together with a ''hot'' GTi, are due next year.
The Almera undercuts its principal rivals, the Ford Escort and
Vauxhall Astra, quite significantly. At just #9795 the entry level
five-door Equation cuts #700 off the price of the Escort 1.4 Encore and
Astra 1.4 Merit. It also beats the Peugeot 306 1.4 XN by #400.
A more detailed look at the price list shows that even the
range-topping five-door Almera SRi and SLX are pitched at just #12,395
-- tremendous value for cars with an outstanding specification.
Tailored exclusively for the European market, it takes the place of
the Sunny as Nissan's challenger to the established market leaders, the
Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra.
Taking anything off that duo -- and the redoubtable VW Golf -- has to
be a tall order, but Nissan insists it has not replaced one car with a
restyled, rehashed mixture as before.
In other words this is an all-new vehicle, from the heavily restyled
rear end to the familiar snout. You get a choice of three engines and
five trim levels. The engines are 1.4 and 1.6 litre petrol units, plus a
2.0 litre diesel, and all of them can shift as well as returning
impressively economical fuel figures.
But as Douglas points out, even the Almera will have its work cut out
to beat the little Micra in the popularity stakes.
''For a small car it is incredibly quiet, efficient and economical,''
he said. ''But the fact that there is so much headroom and possibly the
best access of any car in its class means it has become the favourite
model among Motability purchasers. We have been amazed by the number who
have placed orders recently.''
''We've got people carriers, pick-ups, light commercials, 4x4s,
saloons, hatchbacks and everything
else in between''

THE six-week ban imposed on Boroughmuir captain Peter Wright means
that he will miss not only Scotland's Test match against Western Samoa
on Saturday week, but will play no further part in his club's
premiership campaign.
The 27-year-old British Lion was sent off by international referee Ken
McCartney during Boroughmuir's clash with Gala 12 days ago. Wright was
accused of verbally abusing the referee, and the severity of the
sentence has surprised many observers.
Even within the Scotland hierarchy there must have been confidence of
sorts that Wright would be able to take his place in the line-up to play
the Samoans. The tight-head prop slot was kept vacant with the
nomination A N Other, and Wright had been training with the Scotland
squad since his dismissal.
Wright appeared before the SRU disciplinary panel -- Graham Young,
Lorne Crerar, Alan Hosie, and Charlie Ritchie -- on Tuesday night and
learned of his sentence when he telephoned Murrayfield yesterday
morning.
''I'm devastated,'' said Wright. ''I expected a maximum sentence of
four weeks and hoped that I would get two. That would have allowed me to
play against the Samoans.
''Surprise would be an understatement about the length of the
sentence. I don't want to say anything that would get me into more
trouble with the union -- I've learned my lesson -- but when you see the
kind of sentences that players get for violent play, I am certainly
surprised to get six weeks for speaking to the referee.''
Missing the Samoan game also will hit Wright in the wallet. Players
can expect an appearance fee of around #2000 under the terms of the new
contract, therefore Wright's ill-considered remarks to McCartney carry a
monetary sanction as well.
This, though, was the last thing on Wright's mind. ''I'm just sorry
about letting everybody down, and missing the rest of the league season
is, from my point of view as club captain, just as bad as missing the
international.
''My remarks to the referee were made in the heat of the moment, and I
bitterly regret them. However, you have to take lessons from things like
this and I have to make sure that nothing like this happens again.''
The prop, sent off twice as a junior, declined to speculate on
whether, because he was a high-profile player, he had been made a
scapegoat with his sentence a lesson for others.
''Bruce Hay, our director of rugby, reckons that I've been made a
scapegoat, but that's not for me to say. I just want to put this behind
me now,'' he said.
Because of the special circumstances surrounding the Wright affair --
coming as it did on the eve of selection for the national side -- the
SRU has deviated from precedent and issued a statement confirming the
player's sentence.
Hitherto, disciplinary matters had been kept a closely-guarded secret
by Murrayfield. A statement from SRU chief executive Bill Hogg declared
that the sentence reflected the fact that the sending-off was for
''misconduct'' for which the player had apologised and had accepted the
referee's report.
''The disciplinary panel's decision was reached following a full
appraisal of the facts, and having heard the player and the referee.''
* EDINBURGH coach Ian Barnes said that Western Samoa's Veli Patu
should have been sent off for a straight-arm tackle, after which Duncan
Macrae had to leave the field injured during the capital side's 22-35
defeat by the tourists at Inverleith yesterday.
Barnes said he was not surprised by the intensity of the Samoan
tackling but added: ''The boy should have been off for that one on
Duncan.''

TAGGARTS has for many years been a distributor of light commercial
vehicles. These originally carried Austin badges, changing over the
years as Austin/Morris became BMC, BLMC, British Leyland and eventually
Leyland DAF.
That would be sufficient to keep any sign painter in regular
employment, but when Leyland DAF eventually toppled into the financial
abyss, what emerged from the ashes was a new, British owned and managed
company, LDV.
But through all of this, the vans kept rolling out of Taggarts at
Motherwell. Major customers include local and regional authorities, in
addition to hundreds of business users, all of whom stayed with the
product during its most turbulent times, simply because it was perceived
as the best on the market for their needs.
Now the dust has settled and LDV has become fully established, demand
is growing. Orders for vans, Lutons, dropsiders and tippers are
processed. Specialist equipment such as tail lifts or specific body
designs can be fitted by local specialists and the finished article
turned over to the customer as quickly as -- or in some cases faster
than -- city centre suppliers.
Commercial vehicle sales manager Andy Cullen says the LDV vehicles
sell because they are reliable, easy to maintain, fuel efficient and
adaptable to an incredible variety of purposes.

AS those of you who watch Friday Sportscene will see, I am just back
from Leeds and have had my eyes opened completely as far as rugby league
goes.
Leeds beat the mighty Wigan last week and so, when I watched them
train, the session I saw them do was one after a victory. It was
awesome. They were awesome. There was a buzz about their rugby and a
movement to it that few sports will be able to match.
''When I first came down to rugby league I remember going into the
Widnes dressing room and being hit by the smell of sweat,'' said Ally
Tait, former Scottish union player, after training. ''I thought to
myself at the time that these lads must do some work together. The
amount of weights the top boys do is incredible.''
Leeds have just spent #40,000 on a set of weights recommended to them
by an American expert, and that word of Tait's kept coming back to haunt
me as I watched the Leeds boys go at it. All you heard them say was:
''Good work . . . good work,'' as they pulled sledges around, passed the
ball with lightning speed, and sent tackle bags back 10 yards each hit.
I saw one pass dropped. The guy who dropped it was treated like a leper
and sent to an imaginary sin bin.
The Leeds coach is Dean Bell, the former Wigan and New Zealand player,
who has given the Leeds boys the tools to finally beat his former team.
''I think union has to change its rules,'' he said bluntly. ''These
blokes you see here don't do any stamina work as such. It is all
explosive work, power, and speed.
''I am amazed that your union boys still work with stamina sessions,
when you consider that there is much more running in league than there
is in union. You are light years behind us as far as the work for the
preparation of players is concerned.'' It was that word work again.
And here's the point to this piece. The Leeds fitness coach tells me
that Ally Tait's nickname is: ''The Winner.'' He has been so competitive
over the years, even in training, that they know the man's worth. He is
first in everything. They value him.
They all nudge and wink at Leeds, because they know that Ally Tait has
recorded on video all of the great sessions he has taken part in during
his time at rugby league.
He will now know as much about how to train top-class players for a
physical contact sport as anyone in Britain. I think rugby union must
now step in and bring him into our game. Whatever it costs. He would
show our players how to work.
''Can I have a copy of the tape of the session?'' asked Ally as I
left. Sure, Ally, but not before Jim Telfer and Roy Laidlaw get a wee
keek.
* THE West of Scotland referees' dinner at the end of last week was a
whistling success, I hear. David Leslie, a first-division ref, told the
gathered throng why he had taken up the gentle art of ruining matches by
blowing his whistle. It turns out that he was once sent off twice in the
same game.
In the first half, Leslie was ejected from the proceedings for
punching an opponent. He was playing for Hamilton against Uddingston, he
says, and simply lost the rag.
Not content with staying on the sidelines he came back on the pitch
with the oranges at half-time and then decided to stay. The referee then
spotted him punching another opponent and sent him off the pitch.
Concerned that Hamilton would now be down to 13 men after having sent
off two players, the referee counted the team and found 14 men still on
the pitch. He called the Hamilton captain for an explanation, whereupon
the Hamilton captain, lying through his teeth, confessed to having taken
the field with 16 men.
The moral of the story, according to Leslie, is to count the players
at the start of the game. The moral of the story for me is to get Leslie
on your side if a punch-up breaks out during the game.
* GHK, the venue for the referees' dinner, is a famous graveyard for
speakers.
Iain Anderson, broadcaster and rugby man, was once interrupted by the
audience singing Rolf Harris' ''Two Little Boys'' with one voice in the
middle of his speech when he had chanced to mention something about his
childhood.
Alas, the same fate befell current SRU president Ian Todd at the
referees' dinner when he happened to say that, in his opinion, rugby
should be targeting youngster lads, and signing up boys . . . cue for a
song and the utter destruction of the SRU leader's talk.
''It was just like old times,'' one GHK insider told the Diary. ''I
had a tear in my eye and it took me back to Iain Anderson's speech. If
only these things could happen more often these days.''
It started, the Diary is told, at the match sponsor's table.

EVERTON and Scotland striker Duncan Ferguson yesterday lost his appeal
against the 12-match ban imposed by the SFA for head-butting John McStay
of Raith Rovers in April, 1994, when he was with Rangers.
The decision by the three-man tribunal, which sat for two hours 45
minutes at Hampden, means that Ferguson, currently serving a three-month
jail sentence for the same offence, will not be available for the
English club until their league game with Arsenal at Highbury on January
20.
There had been a feeling in football circles that the tribunal would
take his prison sentence into consideration and either cut back or erase
his sentence, but by a 2-1 majority, the committee stood by the SFA
sentence, which had been held in abeyance until the prolonged court
action was settled.
The presumption is that the vote against the decision was taken by the
player's union representative, Desmond Farrell, who is national
secretary of the GMB, the parent body of the Scottish Professional
Footballers' Association.
The other members of the independent tribunal were MP Menzies
Campbell, QC, and Bill Dickie, president of the SFA.
Yule Craig, chairman of the disciplinary committee which first banned
Ferguson, and Tony Higgins, secretary of the SPFA, offered evidence on
each side to the tribunal.
Ferguson, who had already served one game of his suspension when with
Rangers, will miss two more games before he gets out of Barlinnie on
November 24, but will then have a further nine to go, taking him over
the Christmas and New Year period into late January.
Higgins admitted he was very disappointed at the verdict and added:
''Duncan will be devastated at the news. He has been desperate to get
back to playing and I had thought that the tribunal would have used some
compassion in this situation.
''At the very least, we had hoped they would have back-dated his
suspension to the date he began his jail sentence. He has been, in
effect, punished twice for the same offence.''
The decision will be transmitted to the English FA immediately, and it
will be a formality that they will follow FIFA rules and apply the
sanction in the south.
Higgins does not believe there is any further avenue that can be
explored to reduce the punishment, but said that until he and Everton
had seen the written judgment, which is expected to be available in a
few days, he would prefer to wait and see what could be done next.
''It is up to them now,'' said Higgins.
And Everton chairman Peter Johnson did not mince his words after
having heard the news.
Johnson, who visited Ferguson in jail along with Goodison Park manager
Joe Royle earlier this week, said: ''It is very unfair and unjust. I
feel we have been punished twice.
''To serve six weeks inside Barlinnie Prison is a sentence in itself
and I know because I visited there this week.
''We are very disappointed by this decision. Even muggers do not get
punished twice.''
Ferguson was transferred for in excess of #4m to the Liverpool team
more than a year ago while his court case was pending. He has since won
an FA Cup final medal with Everton and has become a big favourite with
the Merseyside fans.
The statement, read out by the SFA deputy chief executive, Bill
Richardson, said that although the appeal was rejected by a majority,
the decision to impose the sentence immediately was unanimous.
Under the tribunal remit, the suspension could have been reserved
until then player was released from prison.

AT any given time, Taggarts will have around 150 used cars in stock.
Hardly surprising, given that in the motor trade there are many used
vehicles sold for every new one to arrive on the streets, so the
retailing of pre-owned units is a vital function within any well
structured dealership.
Each car offered for sale is valued on the basis of make, age,
mileage, number of previous owners, service history and general
condition.
Anything not coming up to a very high standard is released into the
trade. Those cars selected to be offered for sale are categorised still
further, being given Red Tag or Select.
These are simple enough to comprehend: Taggarts Select cars are those
priced at #6000 and over, while Red Tag vehicles are those deemed
retailable, with an acceptable mileage and priced under #5995.
Taggarts Select comes with a standard 12 months warranty, extendable
to 24 months for an extra premium, with Red Tag cars warranted for three
months, again extendable.
Regardless how it is to be classified, any car which is to be offered
for sale has to undergo a thorough 40-point safety check before being
put on display.
A new innovation is a mileage verification procedure which will mean
cars will not be able to slip into the system courtesy of a false
reading on their milometer.
Again there is a 14-day exchange/money back guarantee on all Red Tag
cars, 30 days exchange on Select, if a customer is not happy with his or
her purchase.
The company's advice on how to pick out a really good car from the
many thousands on offer? Concentrate on one owner, low (genuine) mileage
vehicles with a comprehensive service history from a reputable source.
Today's cars are remarkably reliable, so by following this simple
procedure it is unlikely that anything will go wrong.

TAGGARTS' association with Rover has lasted longer than its links with
any other marque. It remains one of the group's bedrock franchises, and
as if to underline this, a new showroom has been built at Motherwell,
designed to complement Rover's new image as a quality product operating
in a niche market.
Franchise manager John Gillespie has been with the company for more
than 20 years, and says he is ''very impressed'' with the improvement in
the Rover range, especially in recent years.
''When I first started out in the trade all of the profit was in new
cars, with service and parts supply playing a minor role,'' he recalls.
''Today everything has changed, due to increased competition in the
showrooms and immeasurably better products.
''What he have to work hardest at now is supplying customers with the
best cars, at the keenest prices, and keeping them running at peak
efficiency.
''A tremendous effort has gone into the ''customer satisfaction''
aspect of the business and we are delighted that, in the new Rover
range, we have products with which to accomplish this.''
And there are more on the way. A contender for top billing spot at
this week's Scottish Motor Show is the new Rover 200.
Radically different to anything previously produced by the company,
the newcomer will be available in a full line-up of three and five-door
cars from day one.
Its arrival follows the introduction of the 400 earlier this year, but
unlike the previous 200/400 series cars, the single platform has been
dispensed with and what we are now being offered are two completely
different ranges.
Rover says the 200 has been designed to offer a mixture of class and
prestige with verve and flair, extending the company's appeal across a
wider customer spectrum.
Better still, the 200 isn't going to be expensive. Prices are
reportedly in the #10,000-#15,000 range.
Four specification levels, four different versions of the K-series
petrol engine, plus two L-series diesels make up the initial package.
A sporting three-door derivative, the 200vi, features the very latest
1.8 litre K-series VVC power plant originally developed for the new MGF,
drivers who travel more sedately can opt for the high efficiency
automatic CVT (continuously variable transmission) model.
Rover says the 200 will appeal because of its low, sporting stance and
aggressive profile, suggestive of performance and quality.
The interior? Pure Rover, which means a splendidly designed and laid
out cockpit, plenty of elbow room and lots of those little wood and
bright metal details that set Rover apart from the herd.
''The 200 series marks one of the most momentous stages in the
development of the company's range,'' said chief executive John Towers.
''Everyone can see how good it looks; very soon they will find that
the driving experience and the in-depth engineering it provides fully
match its visual appeal.''
Towers says Rover has moved away from its traditional mass market
base, (it outsold Ford in Britain 16 years ago), and has opted to become
established in a ''more select'' position.
Product affairs manager, Denis Chick said: ''Our market share is
completely in line with our international strategy to move upmarket,
away from volume, and to be a premium player.
''We will be quite happy with 9% which is where a premium player
should be.'' Rover's other newcomer, the 400 series saloon , goes on
sale from next spring. It will complete the 400 range, which is seen as
vital to Rover's bid to strengthen its hand in the medium sector of the
market.
The cars will be sold with 1.6 and 2-litre petrol engines versions,
with the option of a 2.0 litre diesel.
Although interiors are similar to existing five-door models, Rover
says the four-door configuration provides a more rounded and distinctive
style at the rear, giving the car more of a powerful road presence than
the hatchback.
''Cars such as these demonstrate the very real commitment to quality
and innovation that reigns at Rover nowadays, and we are certain that
our customers will be just as impressed with them as we are,'' said Mr
Gillespie.
''There are no truly bad cars on the market today and the success of
any product leans heavily on what happens to customers after they have
made their selection. To me, customer satisfaction simply means being
able to say ''yes''. Today's Rovers make this very easy.''

Kilmarnock 0, Rangers 2
THE players of Kilmarnock will trudge into work at Rugby Park this
morning convinced they are living in a world totally devoid of justice.
Their young goalkeeper, Colin Meldrum, will require more consoling than
most.
The keeper, who has not yet turned 20, made a couple of marvellous
saves and his play was generally solid as he stood between Rangers and a
goal or two when they were dominant in the first half.
However, just before half-time the Ibrox side's passes began to go
astray and Kilmarnock grew in confidence. The second half belonged to
them and they were worth a win which would have helped them enter the
winter months which can make or break even the strongest teams.
Paul Gascoigne played an influential role in the first half even
though the English internationalist had to hold on to the ball longer
than he would have preferred. The trouble was few Rangers players were
able to read his intentions.
On one or two occasions he had to make the runs himself and when he
did so Kilmarnock's defenders backed off in panic. However, they
survived this traumatic period mainly due to the excellence of Meldrum,
who was standing in for the suspended Dragoje Lekovic.
Rangers fans among the 14,823 crowd expected to see their players
increase the pace in the second half, but Kilmarnock decided not to
allow the opposition as much space as they had enjoyed during much of
the first 45 minutes. As a direct consequence, Rangers then started to
hit more wayward passes and with Gascoigne becoming anonymous there was
no one to take control and settle them down.
Sensing the possibility of victory the Rugby Park side began to
threaten Colin Scott's goal regularly, but the young Rangers 'keeper,
who is deputising for the injured Andy Goram, made some excellent saves.
Nevertheless, it always seemed as though Kilmarnock would achieve the
breakthrough and they should have done when first John Henry and then
Gary Holt, who took over in the first half when Tom Brown pulled a thigh
muscle, had chances to score. Scott made a remarkable double save and
Rangers survived to score two late goals and claim maximum points.
Their first was scored in 87 minutes when Alan McLaren stabbed the
ball home and a minute from the end Oleg Salenko scored the second.
''I still can't believe that this has happened,'' said Kilmarnock
manager Alex Totten. ''To have gone so long in the game only to lose is
very hard to take. In fact, it's diabolical.''
Rangers manager Walter Smith, who had spent much of the game either
squirming in his centre stand seat or looking animated in the dug-out,
was understandably relieved. ''I am pleased my players didn't stop and
were always looking to score even though the game was running against
them,'' he said.
Two Rangers' players, Ally McCoist and Gascoigne, were booked. The
former was cautioned late in the game after he had pulled the jersey of
Ally Mitchell and the latter was punished after he had shouted at the
referee.
Gascoigne's caution was his fifth in the season -- one of these
bookings he received in a cup tie -- and the midfield player will have
to tread carefully if he doesn't want to face a suspension. Gascoigne
was named in Terry Venable's England squad for the friendly
international against Switzerland next midweek and he will meet up with
the other members today.
However, Smith added that the player will return to Ibrox on Friday
night and he will play for Rangers against Aberdeen the following day
before returning to the England squad on Sunday.
KILMARNOCK -- Meldrum, MacPherson, Black, Henry, Whitworth, Anderson,
Mitchell, Connor, Wright, Brown, McKee. Substitutes -- Reilly, Holt,
Geddes.
RANGERS -- Scott, Cleland, Bollan, Gough, McLaren, Petric, Durrant,
Gascoigne, McCoist, Salenko, Ferguson. Substitutes -- Mikhailichenko,
Murray, Brown.
Referee -- A Huett (Edinburgh).

PETER Nicol yesterday lost in four games to Finland's Sami Elopuro in
the second round of the World Open in Cyprus. The Scottish champion, who
has dropped four places to No.8 in the world following a disappointing
start to the season, went out 13-15, 17-15, 15-7, 15-8 to a player
ranked seven places lower.
The crucial point came at the end of the second game, when Nicol,
having held game balls at 14-12, slipped 15-16 behind and then suffered
a knock in the face when he collided with Elopuro's backswing. After
more than a minute's break, he returned to lose the next point and the
game.
In the women's grand prix, Scotland's Senga Macfie also went out,
beaten 9-1, 9-1, 9-1 by former British champion Sue Wright.

Edinburgh 22,
Western Samoa 35
EDINBURGH tested the water against the South Sea islanders at
Inverleith yesterday and found it hot enough but not uncomfortably so.
The tourists were 4-1 to the good on the try count, but this young and
not particularly physical Edinburgh side, sticking to a restricted game
plan tailored to preventing major midfield confrontation, exposed any
number of Samoan weaknesses such as speed to the breakdown and in the
lineout.
On yesterday's performance, the Samoans looked far short of the World
Cup quarter-finalists that they are, but as coach Bryan Williams
confided later, this had been a typical tour opener with flaws aplenty
that will have to be ironed out.
The Samoans are well used to post-match interrogation on their robust
tackling technique, and were called upon again yesterday to explain, in
particular, what appeared to have been the fore-arm smash by Veli Patu
which led to a groggy Duncan Macrae departing seven minutes from the
end.
Williams, as coaches do, said he hadn't seen the incident, adding that
hard, offensive tackling was part of the Samoans' repertoire. Hard yes,
dangerous no. If Patu had been at fault, he said, then he would be
spoken to.
It would be a mistake, though, to dwell too long on this unfortunate
aspect of the Samoans' game. For long enough Edinburgh were right up
there, in many cases belying their tender years, competing toe-to-toe
with the islanders. Just as Barnes said, superior technique was the key
to Edinburgh's plucky performance.
Edinburgh were kept in the game by the boot of Ally Donaldson, the
Currie fly-half kicking five penalty goals and converting Darren Burns'
sixth minute try. It was significant, though, that on virtually every
occasion Edinburgh scored, the Samoans replied with a try.
Just how much they had in reserve will be better answered at Hawick on
Sunday, when they play Scotland A.
Edinburgh went into the lead after six minutes through that Burns try,
which was preceded by his own priceless, line-out take and a high ball
from Graeme Beveridge. Donaldson converted and put Edinburgh 10 points
to the good with a penalty goal after 23 minutes.
Edinburgh had by far the better of the early exchanges and all of 26
minutes had gone before the Samoans got themselves into a scoring
position, Patu kicking a penalty from far out and then scoring a try.
Burnes converted and the sides were level.
The Samoan hooker, Tala Leiasamaivo, sneaked a soft try at the front
of a lineout on the Edinburgh line to put the tourists in front but,
once again, Edinburgh came back with another Donaldson penalty goal
before Patu had a try, converted by Burnes, to give the Samoans a 13-22
lead at the interval.
Edinburgh came back within reach of the visitors with two Donaldson
penalty goals shortly after the turn. Burnes and Donaldson traded
penalties to make it 22-25 and Edinburgh were still in with a shout.
However, a try by Lima and Patu's third put a gloss on the Samoan
performance which, perhaps, it did not deserve, Edinburgh manager Rob
Flockhart declaring that, considering the fact that on Saturday night,
the capital selectors -- with half the 40-strong squad unavailable for
one reason or another -- had been burning the midnight oil in order to
get a team on the pitch, had not done badly.
''I'm proud of the way that our boys played,'' said Flockhart. ''You
know the problems we've faced in the build-up to the game. This is a
young side and it augurs well for the district championship next
month.''

The new post has been set up to look after the game's administration
on a full-time basis for an initial three-year period. It will replace
many of the functions currently undertaken by Alister MacIntyre, the
association's part-time secretary/treasurer.
A move to have MacIntyre's job up-graded to full-time failed at last
weekend's meeting of the game's ruling body, and it is understood that
MacIntyre is currently being retained on a short-term basis until the
outcome of the job application procedure has been decided.

ENGLAND
ENGLAND midfielder Robert Lee sent Newcastle eight points clear at the
top of the FA Carling Premiership last night as Kevin Keegan's men
heaped more misery on beleaguered defending champions Blackburn.
Lee's thirteenth-minute strike was the only goal of a match marred as
a spectacle by heavy rain that poured down on St James' Park.
It meant an unhappy return to his Tyneside roots for Alan Shearer, who
could do nothing to ease the pressure on Rovers manager Ray Harford as
his side again looked a mere shadow of the outfit that romped to the
title last term.
A manager who enjoyed a much happier night in the north-east was Bryan
Robson after leading his Middlesbrough side to a 2-0 Coca-Cola Cup
third-round replay victory over Crystal Palace in his first competitive
match for six months.
The former England captain was forced into action with his side
ravaged by injuries and the absence on international duty of Brazilian
star Juninho.
But Robson led by example and had a hand in the opening goal scored by
Craig Hignett, who netted his seventh of the season after just eight
minutes before limping off to compound Boro's injury worries.
Norway's Jan-Aage Fjortoft wrapped up the win 14 minutes from time.
Yugoslav midfielder Sasa Curcic kept last season's beaten finalists
Bolton on the Wembley trail by grabbing their winner in a 3-2 triumph at
Leicester.
Curcic, playing only his third game for the club, netted with 11
minutes remaining after the Foxes had twice cancelled out Bolton leads.
John McGinlay (39) opened the scoring only for Mark Robins (50) to
level and, after Dutch midfielder Richard Sneekes (61) had restored
Wanderers' advantage, Iwan Roberts (66) put Leicester back on terms with
his eighth goal of the season. Revised draw for the fourth round of the
Englisnh Coca-Cola Cup is:
Aston Villa v Queen's Park Rangers, Arsenal v Sheffield Wednesday,
Wolves v Coventry, Reading v Southampton, Norwich v Bolton, Leeds v
Blackburn, Liverpool v Newcastle, Middlesbrough v Birmingham City (ties
to be played week commencing 27th November).

Celtic 0, Raith Rovers 0
THEY might claim they did everything bar score, but Celtic cannot
expect their fans to give much space to that plea when title rivals
Rangers sped a further two points clear of them at the top of the
premier division.
Prospective champions have to be able to cope with packed defences,
even one as well organised as that of Rovers.
The Fife team, determined to shut their back door after having lost
five goals against Kilmarnock at the weekend, did not make much pretence
about their intentions and maybe that was understandable.
The onus, therefore, was on Celtic to find the key, but as the minutes
raced past, the home lot became less and less imaginative.
Neither side seemed to get their engines revved up very quickly or
maybe it was the crowd who were needing a kick start. Whatever, the game
was low key for a while, with only a Paul McStay shot over the bar to
liven things up until a fine move between Simon Donnelly and Jackie
McNamara ended in a perfectly weighted pass in front of Brian
McLaughlin, whose shot was much too high.
The little forward did redeem himself with a penetrating run past a
posse of defenders into the penalty area before he was halted, and when
John Collins tried a right-foot shot from 20 yards that slid past a
post, the Parkhead players seemed to be getting into top gear.
There was further evidence when a clever piece of interplay between
Tosh McKinlay, Collins, and Pierre Van Hooydonk ended with the striker's
header being held by Scott Thomson.
Rovers had scarcely made an attacking contribution, but nearly took
the lead after 25 minutes when Shaun Dennis headed on a Davie Kirkwood
free kick to Stevie Crawford, who turned and seemed certain to score
from close range until Gordon Marshall stuck out a hand and somehow
squeezed the ball away for a corner.
Celtic replied quickly, with Andreas Thom breaking into the opposite
penalty box and claiming a spot-kick when he was downed by Dennis, but
it looked a weak case to me and the referee agreed.
John Hughes messed up a pass-back, and it needed a late interception
by Marshall to deflect Crawford from the danger zone.
McNamara, who was as impressive as anybody on the field, tried a
right-foot effort of his own that was not far away, but again Raith came
back with a well-constructed attack that needed a dive at Crawford's
feet by Marshall to keep them out.
There was some smart play by both teams but not a lot of penetration
at the right moment.
Julian Broddle was fortunate to escape a booking for a scything tackle
on McNamara. From the free kick, Thom knocked the ball past, like most
of the shots of the first-half.
Raith carried on where they left off, making it as difficult as
possible for Celtic's attackers, but Dennis was lucky not to be booked
for one tackle on Donnelly.
Ronnie Coyle was the first to be shown a yellow card after he downed
Tommy Boyd, a sign that, at last, referee Ian Taylor's patience was
exhausted, further illustrated by the booking of Jim McInally.
Rovers tried to bring relief by putting on Ally Graham for Colin
Cameron, but manager Jimmy Nicholl would not have been enamoured by the
next rash move of Crawford, a back-heel at Collins, which earned him a
booking.
In 69 minutes, Celtic replaced avn Hooydonk with Andy Walker.
The referee then took the name of another Raith man, deservedly too,
after Dennis tripped Boyd. The Rovers goal was now leading a charmed
life but it hardly seemed possible it could survive. But they did it,
even if Kirkwood became the fifth man to be booked.
''It was disappointing not to win,'' said Tommy Burns, the Celtic
manager, ''but the players gave their all and it can be very frustrating
mounting attack after attack, but Raith defended in numbers and did it
well.''
But if Burns was unhappy, his counterpart, Jimmy Nicholl was more
relieved. ''There are times when you have to get what you can and I know
it wasn't pretty and no doubt frustrating for Celtic supporters. But
after Saturday all we wanted was a determined effort.''
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, McNamara, Hughes, Collins,
Donnelly, McStay, Van Hooydonk, Thom, McLaughlin. Substitutes -- Walker,
Bonner, Gray.
RAITH ROVERS -- Thomson, Kirkwood, Broddle, Coyle, Dennis, Sinclair,
McInally, Cameron, Crawford, Lennon, Dair. Substitutes -- Graham,
Wilson, Raeside.

ENGLAND'S blueprint for the future of the professional game with its
radical proposals for the Five Nations' tournament to be played in May
received, at best, a lukewarm response from the home nation partners
yesterday.
The plan to switch the competition from the depths of winter, and to
be played on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays in May, is contained in a
report from the Rugby Football Union Commission which was set up in the
aftermath of the IB decision to scrap amateurism and chaired by RFU
secretary Tony Hallett.
Much of the commission's 52-page report concerns the development of
the English game -- transfer fees, registration, European Cup,
Anglo-Welsh competitions, streamlining the Twickenham bureaucracy -- but
for the Five Nations' plan to be accepted the RFU will require the
backing of the other participants.
Last night, it seemed that Twickenham has much work to do if the May
proposals are to become a reality.
Scottish Rugby Union chief executive Bill Hogg said: ''We are happy
with what we've got. The Five Nations' Championship has already been put
back two weeks to bring it out of January. If the competition were held
in May then it would affect our tour and presumably those of other
countries as well.
''The next discussion will be about bringing the Five Nations out of
its February slot. But as far as we are concerned any decisions that are
made about the Five Nations' Championship being held at any particular
time of the year are joint decisions.''
Even RFU president Bill Bishop raised doubts over the feasibility of
switching the championship to May. ''We've been trying to move it to
later in the season for some time. But I'm surprised that the Commission
has gone as far as they have. I must stress this is only a report. The
committee may well not accept it.
''We would have to get the agreement of other nations, which may not
be easy. It may not be possible. Quite a bit of talking needs to be
done.''
Philip Browne, secretary-treasurer of the Irish Rugby Football Union,
said the proposal had its attractions. However, he added: ''Here in
Ireland, such a move would also have some disadvantages at that time of
the year. For instance, the National Hurling League is at its height in
May.''
In France, May is the traditional month for the climax of the club
season and there will undoubtedly be opposition from that quarter as
well.
The Welsh Rugby Union has reacted with scepticism to the proposal. WRU
secretary Edward Jones said: ''I don't think the idea of using the whole
of May for the Five Nations' is feasible.''
The report means that Rob Andrew's hopes of an early debut for new
club Newcastle have been dashed. The controversial 120-day qualification
ruling ruling will stay in place for this term but be changed to seven
days from next season.
Andrew's batch of Newcastle signings -- including himself -- will
still be inactive until the new year. Newcastle owner Sir John Hall has
repeatedly threatened litigation against Twickenham if the four-month
stand down is not lifted.
As a consequence of the qualification period being reduced to seven
days next year and 30 days in non-national leagues, there will be an
immediate passage back from rugby league.
Restrictions on players from Wales, Scotland and Ireland in English
league matches are abolished.

Aberdeen 3, Falkirk 1
ABERDEEN, in search of the ruthless streak their manager Roy Aitken is
demanding, were able to play only a spectators' role in their opening
goal against bottom of the league Falkirk. After just three minutes,
keeper Tony Parks blundered when he sent a clearance ricocheting off
Billy Dodds, who was an unsuspecting accomplice.
Although he will claim the goal, scored with his stomach, Dodds, his
team-mates, the 11,500 spectators, and Parks were astonished as the ball
bounced back over the keeper's head and rolled into the net.
In fact, at the end of the night only one of the four goals was a
clear-cut affair in a game which Aberdeen won comfortably.
Aberdeen went straight into the attack and in just two minutes Duncan
Shearer was vainly claiming a penalty after a slightly too dramatic fall
in the box. Two minutes later came the Parks blunder, and a minute later
Aberdeen almost had a second. Joe Miller sent a high ball forward to the
edge of the box and, after winning the ball with his head, Shearer
turned and volleyed just wide.
As Aberdeen kept Falkirk pinned in their box Dodds was next to have an
opportunity. Miller's corner from the right fell to him in front of
goal, but Parks dived bravely to smother his shot.
David Weir saved Falkirk in 20 minutes, when Stephen Glass chipped the
ball over keeper Parks as he left his line to try to clear a Eoin Jess
cross. However, Weir raced in and headed the ball off the line for a
corner.
Four minutes later, Miller secured Aberdeen's second goal as a result
of a superb cross from Glass. Miller, right at the back post, was left
simply to stick up a foot and tap the ball in.
Falkirk's first real threat came from Mo Johnston in 33 minutes, when
his chip shot, which Snelders seemed relaxed about, clipped the top of
the bar.
In 36 minutes, another Aberdeen player sent the ball into the net with
his body, but this time Brian Grant put it into his own net. Weir
crossed from the right and a tranfixed Aberdeen defence left Paul
McGrillen to shoot and the ball went in off Grant.
When the teams came out for the second half Scott Thomson had replaced
Glass. The substitute almost scored after 53 minutes, but shot just wide
from a Shearer pass. A minute later he had a second near miss, when he
blasted the ball over the bar.
In 58 minutes, Jamie McGowan maintained the pattern of the evening
when he got in the way of a Paul Bernard drive and deflected it into his
own net to give Aberdeen their third goal.
Peter Hetherston replaced Dodds after 75 minutes and Jess moved
forward, but the action moved to the other end and Snelders failed to
hold a powerful 25-yard shot from Scott McKenzie, but John Inglis
managed to clear.
Falkirk replaced McGrillen with Colin McDonald in 78 minutes, and two
minutes later Johnston forced Snelders to push his 30-yard shot wide for
a corner.
It resulted in an unwarranted penalty appeal by Falkirk and Stuart
Munro earned a yellow card for his complaints.
Later, the Falkirk manager slammed his players for their slipshod
performance. ''We made a terrible start and that opening goal was really
diabolical. It was the last thing we wanted to do, as they had just come
off two defeats. If we had not lost the goal, then they could have got a
bit edgy, but we never gave ourselves that chance,'' said Falkirk
manager John Lambie.
Aitken said: ''I was delighted with the result and it will help us to
sustain the challenge we want to. But, ironically, we have played better
than that recently and ended up losing games.''
ABERDEEN -- Snelders, McKimmie, Glass, Grant, Inglis, Smith, Miller,
Shearer, Bernard, Dodds, Jess. Substitutes -- Hetherston, Stillie,
Thomson.
FALKIRK -- Parks, Weir, Munro, Clark, McLaughlin, McKenzie, Johnston,
McGowan, McGrillen, Johnston, Hagen. Substitutes -- McDonald, Napier,
Lamont.
Referee -- A Waddell (Edinburgh).

MEAT wholesalers and livestock auctioneers were at odds yesterday over
plans to pass on to farmers the increased costs faced by the meat
companies in disposing of offal under the Government's anti-BSE control
measurers.
The wholesalers have called for financial support from the European
Disease Eradication fund, but in the meantime they have declared that
from Monday some companies will deduct #3.50 from the price paid for
animals.
John Scott, president of the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers,
said the meat industry should not be asked to pay for a problem which
was not of its making.
However, Willie Blair, president of the Institute of Auctioneers and
Appraisers in Scotland, said auctioneers had no authority to make
deductions from payments, other than the statutory ones currently in
force.

<HEADLINE>Labour backs call for radical CAP reform</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS, FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975470765</RECORDNO>

THE need for a radical reform of Europe's Common Agricultural Policy
was emphasised by the Labour Party's agricultural spokesman, Dr Gavin
Strang, when he addressed the Scottish Agricultural College's Outlook
for Agriculture conference yesterday.
''The fact that most sectors of British farming are securing higher
returns at present should not obscure the need for CAP reform,'' he
said. ''World grain prices have risen dramatically this year and EU
intervention stocks are low, but this would not justify postponing CAP
reform. Far from it; this is surely the best time to secure changes
which bring European agriculture closer to the market place.''
Dr Strang said the European Commission had already announced that it
was to produce plans for a reform of CAP to meet the challenge of
enlargement. ''We have to ensure that these changes are in the interests
of British farming,'' he said.
''We must ensure that the past excesses of CAP are not repeated. We
want to see an end to state intervention and export subsidies that can
create the scandal of food mountains, drive prices up and lead to the
dumping of cheap food on world markets.
''We want to see a total reappraisal of the objectives and operation
of the CAP, putting support for agriculture alongside wider investment
in rural areas, to stimulate new jobs and new investment to benefit the
whole rural economy and environment.
''Agriculture justifies support but the CAP as it operates now is not
the way to do it. Farm support must be uncoupled from production, going
directly to those farms which need and deserve assistance.''
Dr Strang forecast that the establishment of a devolved Scottish
parliament would have major implications for agriculture in Scotland. A
Scottish parliament was likely to take a greater interest than
Westminster in areas such as crofting legislation and land use.
''I would guess that one of the consequences in relation to farming is
that there will be more representation of rural areas leading to a
bigger clout for farming and rural policies,'' he said.
At the same time, he conceded, the British vote in the council of
agricultural ministers would be cast by the British government on behalf
of the British people, although a representative of the Scottish
parliament would probably be a member of the British delegation.
Allan Buckwell, professor of agricultural economics at Wye College,
University of London -- and a member of the think-tank which produced a
report on CAP reform for the then UK Agriculture Minister William
Waldegrave -- took up the theme that CAP could not survive in its
present format.
He argued, however, that the pressures of international commitments
and future enlargement of the Union would build up gradually. They might
not be revealed fully until the middle of the next decade. ''In these
circumstances, given the history of CAP decision making, the most
compelling prediction is that nothing much will change this side of the
next millenium,'' he said.
The preferred avenues of change, he suggested, should be through a
market-orientated policy to develop the competitiveness of farming; a
socio-structural policy to develop rural areas and an environmental
policy to safeguard and enhance the countryside.

WALKING along the road with Bill McLaren and Jim Fleming, Scotland's
No.1 referee, we speculated on what the score might be. A difference of
about 30 points we experts agreed, in the tourists' favour of course.
When Edinburgh led 10-0 deep into the first half, you could hear the
sound of words being eaten.
But not the crowd. Our capital city must provide the quietest
spectators in the universe. There were about 3000 of them at Inverleith
-- you would not have heard them behind a held-up newspaper.
My first impression was the ring of steel provided by the Rock Steady
security firm. Has there been an outbreak of non-payers sneaking into
rugby grounds that I have missed? Then, after the pipe band and the
Primary 7 kids of Stewart's/Melville going through their paces, the
teams took centre stage.
Mr To'o Vaega led the Haka for the Western Samoans. The Edinburgh
players ignored the whole event, standing instead in the kind of circle
the wagons used to form in cowboy films.
Thus, having avoided being spellbound, the home side were able to
score a quite splendid try. Darren Burns, of Boroughmuir, burst away
from a lineout and scattered Samoans. This was not in the script, and a
stunned crowd received the touchdown in almost tumultuous silence.
Cameron Glasgow, he who comes near but so far from a first cap,
spilled a pass, a wag threatening to unveil a banner reading: ''the
selectors were right,'' but the Herioter redeemed himself with a
try-saving tackle.
Talking of tackles brings us onto the topic which will follow the
Samoans wherever they go. They hit opposing players hard but,
controversially, high, and the Edinburgh doctor must have looked at a
few bruised necks.
Brian Lima almost removed Paddy Haslett's head. It gave Edinburgh a
penalty which Ally Donaldson kicked; it must have given young Haslett a
whale of a headache.
Bryan Williams, the tourists' coach, a decent guy, defends his players
against the deliberately dangerous tackle charge. ''They don't hold back
-- they launch themselves at the ball-carrier and are also trying to
smother at the same time. But I do not condone any straight-arm stuff.''
Fair enough, Bryan, but let me tell you like it is; your highly
talented full back, Veli Patu, should have been sent to the pavilion for
the assault on Duncan Macrae, who was led away not knowing whether it
was Wednesday or Friday.
Referees more strict than Gareth Simmonds will not hesitate to take
action, and that will do no good for the image of Western Samoan rugby.
The tourists started to gell -- some of them had not played for 8
weeks -- and they had a 22-13 lead at the break.
Edinburgh, fielding probably their youngest side, refused to fold. The
jumpers, Burns and Scott Murray, were as good as anything the Samoans
had on offer, Graham Dall was underlining his promise as a future
internationalist open-side, and the wee scrum half, Gordon Beveridge, is
a real find.
Donaldson, good old Super-Ally, kept them in the hunt, banging over
penalties at regular intervals. But the visitors had an extra gear which
they slipped into whenever they looked like being caught.
Pat Lam is class and we will read much more of Vatu and Lima,
hopefully for the right reasons.
Rob Flockhart, the Edinburgh manager, was proud of the way his lot had
performed. So was skipper Ally. ''These young lads have no nerves, they
just went for it.''
I thought they did well, too, but have to observe that it was a rather
passionless occasion; a raucus heckler, a burst of song, a well-endowed
streaker would have done wonders.
In the primary match, a young lad named James Thompson scored three
tries and two conversions making it a most happy day for grandfather
McLaren. Nice little mover, Bill.

FURTHER encouragement of start-up companies is required if Scotland's
economy is to continue catching up with the rest of the UK, NatWest
chief economist David Kern will tell business people in Edinburgh today.
However, highlighting the replacement of Scotland's traditional
manufacturing base with new areas of excellence such as electronics and
chemicals, Mr Kern believes there is scope for growing optimism.
He considers the Scottish economy is adapting to reduced reliance on
oil and gas, and coping with restructuring in the defence sector.
He will also point to the country's impressive record as far as
exports and inward investment are concerned.
However, he will tell the Scottish business community that there is a
clear need for further encouragement of home-grown start-ups, with small
and medium-sized businesses remaining crucial to job creation.
He told The Herald yesterday: ''It is not so much a question of
hand-outs but a question of creating an environment where small
businesses and start-ups can survive.''
In this month's Budget, he would like to see 100% capital allowances
introduced for smaller investment projects, to relieve the tax burden on
growing companies.
He believes it is also necessary to increase the threshold for VAT
registration significantly, to prevent ''micro'' companies becoming
tangled up in red tape.
Mr Kern -- while pointing out that projected Scottish gross domestic
product growth of 2.3% per annum during the rest of the decade is adrift
of a rate of 2.6% forecast for the UK as a whole -- believes Scotland
can match the national average growth rate during the early years of the
next decade if structural change continues.

AS nuclear electricity staff pack their files in readiness for a move
into a brand new headquarters building, Edinburgh Park is reaching
critical mass. The completion of the spec-built Lochside Court building,
which will be occupied by the UK's new nuclear generating company, and
the rapid progress on other schemes means that by early next year the
business park will be humming with activity.
The scaffolding has just come off the 30,000sq ft open plan Lochside
Court and staff will start to move in on December 15 -- following
closely behind the recent move by John Menzies Retail staff into a
neighbouring purpose-built HQ.
British Energy, the holding company for Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear
Electric which will be privatised next year, chose the speculatively
built Lochside Court because of its accessibility to the M8 and the
availability of 165 car parking spaces.
''The city centre was an obvious alternative, but it did not have
these attributes,'' says Hugh Rutherford of Ryden, which acts as British
Energy's property agent. ''In general, British Energy wanted a location
which reflects the status of the newly privatised company -- and
Edinburgh Park was considered to be the only true office business park
in Scotland.''
The rental paid is understood to be around #15 per sq ft. ICL's
40,000sq ft building on the park is expected to reach completion next
month, while Scottish Equitable's 305,000sq ft scheme should be ready by
March, 1996.
But Edinburgh Park faces competition from the west of Scotland. With
the completion of a speculative 36,500sq ft building, Strathclyde
Business Park in Bellshill has also reached a landmark. The
headquarters-style building stands on a landscaped campus next to the
Mercury and Lanarkshire Development Agency HQs. The scheme, which is
called New Alderston House, is a joint project by Morrison Developments
Ltd, HF Developments Ltd, and Lanarkshire Development Agency. The
scheme's 145 parking spaces are proving to be a key attraction.
''We are receiving strong interest from a number of blue chip
companies looking outwith the city centre market,'' says John Costello
of letting agents Montagu Evans.
''With the advent of new communications technology, it is becoming
less important for companies to be based near their clients, and
progressive firms are quick to realise the benefits of accessible,
high-quality offices in an attractive parkland setting.
''It is also more cost effective for firms with a large mobile
workforce to be located close to the motorway network, rather than
having to negotiate the rush-hour traffic in Glasgow or Edinburgh.''
John Costello would prefer to see the building used as a headquarters
location for a sole tenant, but says that leases of individual floors
may be considered by the developers if there is a strong demand from
tenants seeking around 12,000 sq ft.
A recently completed phase of four smaller office pavilions at the
park, ranging from 6,500sq ft to 9,500sq ft has already attracted two
occupiers.

THE OECD confirmed yesterday that it was revising down its forecast
for economic growth in 1995, mainly due to slower growth in Japan.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development now expects
growth of 2.25% in the OECD area compared to 2.7% forecast in June,
Joseph Stiglitz, head of the OECD's Economic Policy Committee, said.
The Paris-based think tank also said it expected slightly slower
growth next year than the 2.7% forecast in June. ''The impact of the
yen's further appreciation is a major reason for our downward revision
this year,'' OECD economist Kumiharu Shigehara told a news conference.
OECD secretary-general Jean-Claude Paye warned in September that the
organisation could revise down its growth forecasts to 2.25% for 1995.
Shigehara repeated comments he first made in October that growth in
Japan was expected to be about one percentage point lower this year than
the 1.3% forecast in June, mainly due to the impact of the rise in the
yen on Japanese exports.
Stiglitz said that high interest rates and erratic currency
fluctuations had also slowed economies in Europe, but declined to give
specific forecasts. -- Reuter.

OUTPUT from Scotland's production and construction industries grew
faster than in the UK as whole in the April-June quarter, according to
new figures from the Scottish Office, writes ALF YOUNG, Economics
Editor.
But, on a year-on-year basis, Scottish output, including
manufacturing, has underperformed the UK since the summer of 1994.
Within Scottish manufacturing, growth in output from the electronics
sector has continued to sparkle, although not quite as brightly as
before. Excluding its contribution, the rest of Scottish manufacturing
output has been on a downward trend since 1990.
The latest index of production and construction shows total Scottish
output up 1.5% in the second quarter compared with the first. There was
no change in UK output over the same period.
In manufacturing, which accounts for two-thirds of the index, the
latest quarter-on-quarter rise in Scotland is 1.2%, compared with a 0.5%
increase in the UK as a whole.
But comparing output growth over the past four quarters with the
previous four gives a very different picture. Total Scottish production
and construction output grew 1.4% compared with 3.7% in the UK as a
whole. Scottish manufacturing output grew 3.6% year-on-year compared
with a 4.1% rise in the UK.
Electrical and instrument engineering (a proxy for the electronics
sector in Scotland) grew by 2% quarter-on-quarter and 18% year-on-year
compared with 0% and 10% respectively for the UK as a whole.
Six manufacturing sectors recorded output growth over the quarter
while five experienced declines. Drinks (6%) and chemicals and man-made
fibres (5%) showed the biggest rises. Refined petroleum products and
nuclear products (down 12%) suffered the biggest fall.
George Kynoch, Scottish Industry Minister, welcomed the figures as
''good news for the Scottish economy''. He said they were indicative of
further strength in economic recovery across many sectors.
The latest index is the first to be published on the basis of the
Government's new standard industrial classification, SIC92. The main
sectoral impact is to halve the weight given to mechanical engineering
and double the weight given to metal and metal products.

THIRD-quarter results from BAT Industries show another strong
performance, with profits rising by a fifth to #659m.
This takes the nine-month total to #1813m, an increase of 22%. Tobacco
remained the powerhouse, raising its contribution by a third to #1207m,
though financial services were 18% ahead at #730m.
Tobacco volume was 20% up, with production almost reaching 500 billion
cigarettes. This partly reflected the acquisition of American Brands and
like-for-like growth was 10%. BAT's share of the global market has risen
from 10[1/2]% to 12%.
Marketing spend was up and the group is concentrating on its major
international brands. It is also paying attention to costs and aims to
squeeze more efficiency out of its operations over the next few years.
Brown &amp; Williamson in the US scored with an 60% jump in profits,
helped by American Brands, which boosted its market share to 18%. Price
pressures have eased a little and an increase was pushed through in
June.
BAT is confident the latest attempt to bring tobacco within the
jurisdiction of the Food &amp; Drug Administration will fail. It has been
cheered by a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada that restrictions
in tobacco advertising would be counter to freedom of speech.
Brazil continued its strong recovery and a higher share of a growing
market was obtained by Souza Cruz. BAT's brands increased their share of
East European markets, though these are largely static. Real growth is
coming from the Far East, with Indo-China notably strong.
In financial services, Eagle Star did well, increasing its
contribution significantly to #185m on the back of doubled investment
returns. Underwriting losses increased from #26m to #38m, reflecting
softening rates, though the company is trying to lead the motor market
higher with a 3[1/2]% premium rise. The direct insurance company made
progress, raising its customer base by 5%.
Allied Dunbar made 13% less at #108m owing to the very difficult
conditions in the life and pensions industry, though it gained market
share. Sales of investment products tumbled 45%, life premiums were down
4% and pensions 10%. Integration of the Save &amp; Prosper sales force has
been completed and sales lately have begun to improve.

the current year. According to Acquisitions Monthly, that compares with
the 1350 takeovers completed in the same period last year. During
January and September, EU takeovers were worth #42bn compared with
#37.5bn for the whole of 1994. French companies were the most active

THE latest contestant in the utility beauty parade is South Wales
Electricity (Swalec). Welsh Water said yesterday that it was
contemplating a bid for the company, the bulk of whose business comes
from industry.
The water company said that in the current circumstances it envisaged
any such offer would be ''around the mid-morning price today of 1020p
per share''.
Such a price excludes the value of its National Grid shareholding. The
statement was made in response to a request from the Stock Exchange
Takeover Panel.
The company said it had yet to make a decision ''on whether, and if so
when, to make any proposals to the board of South Wales Electricity''.
Swalec's shares, which were already up on bid speculation, raced ahead
70p to 1058p. Welsh Water's shares dropped 30p to 724p.
In the absence of any formal bid, Swalec advised its shareholders to
take no action. The two companies have already had in-depth merger
discussions following privatisation in 1990.
At one stage, Welsh Water held a 15% stake in Swalec but this was sold
when the latter cancelled the talks in 1991.
Swalec remains one of only five independent regional electricity
companies. Only a week ago it announced that Peter Morgan, former
director of the Institute of Directors, would succeed Wynford Evans as
chairman from January 1.
If Welsh Water does decide to bid it will be following in the
footsteps of North West Water whose #1800m bid for Norweb, creating
Britain's first multi-utility, has gone unconditional.
However, there are some City analysts who believe North West Water has
overpaid despite the likelihood that it will derive significant
operational and tax savings from the merger.
The bid speculation surrounding Swalec comes just days after Seeboard,
the regional electricity company serving much of South-east England,
agreed to be taken over by the Texan utility company Central &amp; South
West Corporation, for #1600m.
Houston Industries, CSW's former US partner in its aborted bid for
Norweb, remains on the lookout to acquire an electricity company.
London, East Midlands, Yorkshire and Northern also currently remain
independent.

Artists face the challenge of making Glasgow alive in our minds. Minty
Donald welcomes a forum which will focus on the way ahead
DUNCAN THAW, artist-protagonist of Alasdair Gray's novel, Lanark,
proclaimed: ''Imaginatively, Glasgow exists as a music-hall song and a
few bad novels. That's all we've given to the world outside. That's all
we've given to ourselves.'' Thus he unwittingly provided the cue for
tonight's discussion at Tramway, the latest in the series of debates
held in conjunction with The Herald, and, on this occasion, hosted by
TAG Theatre Company, whose adaptation of the novel is currently at the
Citizens'.
Such a plea for artists to use the city in order for it to live in the
imagination of its inhabitants and the world at large is a thrown
gauntlet. It was made sometime around the end of the fifties: a time
before the rise to international prominence of a whole stream of
Glaswegian image-makers. Gray himself numbers among writers such as
Kelman, Leonard and Lochead, and alongside painters like Currie,
Campbell, Howson et al, the so-called ''New Glasgow Boys''.
Whether they, and perhaps more importantly, the current crop of
artists and culture shapers engaging with the city, will allow us to
''imagine Glasgow'' and how we choose to do so provide the focus of
tonight's debate.
Under the somewhat dauntingly expansive title, Imagining Glasgow, the
debate brings together Kevin Kane of Glasgow Development Agency,
architect David Page, Emma Davie of performance company Clanjamfrie, and
Hillhead High School pupils Michael Sweeney and Shona O'Donnell to lead
off an open forum, chaired by Keith Bruce, arts editor of The Herald.
Artist, Rodney Smith, will be on hand, responding visually to the
''imaginings''.
Such a diverse assortment of panelists promises to offer an aptly
varied range of responses. After all, a city is a large and complex
phenomenon. It cannot -- and perhaps this is especially true of the
fragmented, disjointed, sprawling character of Glasgow -- be pinned down
to a single identity.
For myself -- born, bred, educated and employed (or unemployed) in the
city for most of my life -- I have a mass of images and experiences,
some lived, some filtered through the rosy or darkly clouded glass of
nostalgia, some inherited from my parents, grand-parents and friends;
but, most importantly in terms of tonight's debate, many shaped by the
visions of the city's own image-makers, who seem to me, in contrast to
Thaw's view, abundant and self-reflective.
So, who are these image-makers, and what are they giving to the city's
imaginative life?
At the Citizens' Theatre, TAG Theatre Company's adaptation of Lanark
is currently finishing its tour. It offers Glasgow as a
pseudo-Expressionist vision of hell. A dehumanised, bureacratic
post-industrial society heading towards self-destruction. But through
it, runs a strong thread of warmth, humour and hope.
On a different scale and in a different medium, photographer Roger
Palmer, an ''incomer'' marking his 10th anniversary in the city, mounts
an exhibition of black-and-white photos of the city's coat of arms
(arguably the earliest example of Glasgow's ''imaginings'') at Glasgow
School of Art. On one wall, he displays his version of the city's motto:
''Here's the fish that never swam. Here's the bird that never flew.
Here's the bell that never rang. Here's the tree that never grew.''
Throwing into sharp focus the recurring self-denegrating theme in
Glasgow's imagery, our badge of civic pride comes complete with a
self-mocking and undermining caption. Just what does it say about a city
that describes its civic emblem through a series of negatives?
BUT that's only half the picture. If the negativity embodied in the
coat of arms is one face of Glasgow, the flipside must be the fatuous Mr
Happy; a cartoon image of a yellow Smartie with legs, declaring:
''Glasgow's Miles Better!''
While Roger Palmer choses to site his work, with its close ties to St
Mungo, in the art school (which he playfully describes as ''the secular
temple of the city, the cathedral of St Mack''), Glasgow-based company
Clanjamfrie are entering the city's historical and religious heart with
an outdoor performance, Satellite, in the cathedral precinct in
December.
''We're not sure we like the idea of 'imagining' Glasgow,'' Emma Davie
tentatively suggests. ''What we want to do is look imaginatively at
what's around us; to see the magic in the everday life of the city.''
Clanjamfrie's fallen angels will stalk the streets of Glasgow,
witnessing and wondering at the minutiae of city living. Inevitably, no
glance, however cursory, at images of Glasgow can avoid its tenacious
macho identity.
The words ''Glasgow'' and ''hard man'' are stil inextricably linked.
Arguably, however, its currently most visible manifestation appears in
the person of local anti-hero, Rab C Nesbit -- Gregor Fisher's
incarnation of the Glasgwegian who'll headbutt you then buy you a pint.
A peculiarly contradictory face for the city to be presenting on
national television.
Whether we agree with them or not (and if there is a unifying
principle running through the imaginings of Glasgow, it's the principle
of contrast and paradox), Glasgow's artists are not idle in dreaming
about and reflecting on their city. Tonight's debate will hopefully
throw up a plethora of visions, but will, I'm prepared to wager, reach
no coherent conclusions.
What it should do is inspire and excite, encouraging artists and
others alike to live imaginatively in their city, to see its
magnificence and potential, and to hold a vision of its flourishing, for
all its inhabitants. But then, when it comes to imagining Glasgow, I'm a
shameless optimist.

SCOTLAND'S first foreign exchange currency dealer has opened an office
in Glasgow, and already the company has plans for expansion to
Edinburgh.
Charles Chan, managing director of Forex (Scotland), said yesterday
that since starting business in September the company has filled 11
trader positions and planned to hire an additional 14 trainees in the
near future.
In addition, Mr Chan and his partners, operations director James Ha
and marketing director Sam Ho, are intent on opening another office with
20 additional staff in Edinburgh some time next year.
Mr Chan said he and his partners decided to start their business in
Glasgow because there were no other currency dealers in Scotland.
''When we looked at it, there was nothing in Glasgow,'' he said.
''Glasgow is a European city, and foreign currency is required in every
European city. So, we decided to go for it.''
The company deals in all major currencies, he said, and has lined up
both corporate and private clients. Forex handles hedging for corporate
clients while serving private customers primarily in the area of margin
trading.
Victoria McCallum began training with Forex in August and has been
handling foreign exchange trading since the business opened in
September. After studying law and then working in the insurance
industry, she decided to join Forex because it was a fledgling company
in a challenging field.
''I really liked the enthusiasm, because it was a new company and the
first foreign exchange in Scotland,'' she said. ''Plus there was the
training that was offered. To get into this kind of field can be very
difficult.''
Mr Chan said successful applicants received two weeks free training
and were then tested. If they passed, they continued their employment
with the company.
So far, only 11 have been hired from 169 applicants. ''The process is
very selective,'' he said, ''but we have staff from all over, and with
all different backgrounds. Money is just a simple thing -- everybody
likes it.''
Forex is prepared to hire people who do not have a background in
foreign exchange. Mr Chan said this allowed him and his partners to
train them and shape the company as they saw fit.
''We went to build company,'' he said, ''so we built it from
scratch.''

ANDREW Teare, currently chief executive of English China Clays (ECC),
is to replace Michael Gifford as chief executive of Rank Organisation
next spring.
Mr Gifford has been one of the longest serving chief executives of a
FTSE company, joining Rank in 1983. However, his gruff manner
disconcerted many in the City.
He had already informed the board of his plan to retire at the age of
60. Mr Teare is to join as a non-executive on January 1. Commenting on
his replacement, Mr Gifford said he was ''an experienced and talented
chief executive and Rank is fortunate to get him''.
ECC said it was sorry to see Mr Teare go, particularly as it was about
to reap the benefits of the changes he had brought about including the
strengthening of the group's finances. A successor is to be appointed
before his departure.
Mr Teare's entire career has been spent in the building materials
industry. He was appointed chief executive of ECC in 1990. He was
previously managing director of the Rugby group and his earlier career
was spent at Turner &amp; Newall and Cement Roadstone in Dublin. Aged 53, Mr
Teare is a graduate from London University. He is a non-executive
director at NFC and Prudential Corporation.
He joins Rank at an interesting time. Parts of the business, such as
bingo, are facing competitive pressure from the National Lottery and
Instants scratch cards. However, some City analysts believe that Rank,
whose interests include Butlins, the Odeon cinema chain, Warner holidays
and Hard Rock cafes, is well placed to benefit from a rise in consumer
spending next year.
Rank shares were bouyed up 7p to 427p after the news but ECC fell 16p
to 334p.

FRANKFURT has lost the battle to replace London as Europe's leading
financial centre and must develop niche strengths to attract and keep
more foreign banks, a report by the state of Hesse central bank said
yesterday.
Despite widespread hopes during the eighties that Germany's banking
capital could overtake London as a financial centre, ''London's lead has
continued to strengthen for a number of reasons,'' the report said.
''Alongside its natural advantages such as time zone and language, the
economic logic of the market favours London because in a limited
geographical area a single trade centre for internationally traded
products is considered to be optimum.''
The report betrayed the growing resignation to London's pre-eminence
as a financial centre as well as resentment at what is seen as domestic
banks' desertion of their own turf.
Market-leader Deutsche Bank's decision late last year to concentrate
its investment banking activities in London was viewed as a slap in the
face for Bonn authorities.
Nonetheless, more major German banks are following suit, with Dresdner
Bank this summer opting to take over the UK investment bank Kleinwort
Benson. -- Reuter

THE world's biggest drugs group, Glaxo Wellcome, yesterday confirmed
that it would shed 1800 research jobs as a result of the #9000m merger
between Glaxo and Wellcome.
Research and development staff numbers across the group worldwide will
fall from 11,500 to 9700 by the end of this year.
The losses will come as some of the old Wellcome research centres are
shut down. The biggest of these was the Wellcome base at Beckenham,
Kent, which would close within the next three years, said a spokesman.
Glaxo Wellcome intended to spend #1200m on researching new drugs in
1996, it revealed at a briefing at its new #700m medicines research base
in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.
The drugs giant had set itself a target of bringing three new
medicines a year to the market from 2000 and to increase productivity
three-fold.
''The depth and breadth of Glaxo Wellcome's portfolio, together with
the underlying strength of the products introduced since 1990, gives us
every confidence in the company's future prospects,'' said chief
executive Sir Richard Sykes.
Areas of research earmarked prominently include anti-virals,
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurosciences.
Meanwhile, Glaxo received initial approval by US regulators for a new
anti-Aids product.

HIGHER education contributes millions of pounds and thousands of jobs
to the Scottish economy, a major survey will show.
Its findings will be used by the commissioning body, the Committee of
Scottish Higher Education Principals, to argue for more funds for the
hard-pressed sector, which has suffered long-term grant and tuition fee
cuts.
The study will be published later this month and the principals hope
it will finally nail the lie that universities and HE colleges are
costly ivory towers which are a drain on resources.
The research will show for the first time that the opposite is the
case, with institutions boosting the economy throughout Scotland.
Of more than #700m worth of public funding which Scottish HE
institutions receive each year, about #200m goes straight back to the
Treasury in tax and national insurance contributions.
The remaining #500m goes into lecturers' pay packets and other areas
which have a beneficial impact on the economy.
The study also gives details of the knock-on effect higher education
jobs have on employment outside the sector.
Researchers used a recognised formula to show that more than one job
is created in the economy for each one in higher education, highlighting
the fact that universities also provide an important business service.
The principal of Edinburgh University, Sir Stewart Sutherland, said
the institution's 5000 posts were responsible for at least another 6300
in the general economy.
He said: ''As we ply our trade we create work and a livelihood for a
very significant proportion of the population.''
He and his colleagues hope Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and the
Scottish Higher Education Funding Council will take the sector's
economic impact into account when they fight their corner with the
Treasury.
Sir Stewart said higher education was, at one level, a business and if
the levels of investment it attracted into Scotland were not protected
the business would falter and the spin-off benefits would be lost.
New figures confirm Edinburgh University's position as a leading
importer of students. Last year Edinburgh and St Andrews were the only
Scottish universities with less than half their full-time students from
Scotland -- 42% and 38% respectively.
But Sir Stewart warned that long-term cuts in public funding could
lead to fewer course options being offered.
''If the alternative is reducing the quality of education we provide
then maybe that is the lesser of two evils,'' he said.
In common with other institutions, Edinburgh's slice of the funding
cake was getting thinner, and unless matters improved action might be
necessary to maintain standards, he said.

Lucy Lockhart reports on the shift from traditional mechanical
engineering to meet the changing needs of employers in the new
millennium.
SHARP-EYED travellers on Glasgow's M8 will have noticed a
transformation on the main facade of Stow College, with the addition of
a splendid new glass-canopied rotunda entrance.
The lofty red brick building -- the city's oldest purpose-built
further education college -- has been undergoing a systematic
refurbishment programme over several years, as it has moved from a major
role in traditional engineering skills training to meet the very
different needs of the Scottish economy in the 90s and into the next
millennium.
''Our business is to make sure that local industry is highly
competitive, world leading and that the training which it needs is
absolutely appropriate,'' explains Professor David Snaith, Principal of
Stow College for the past 12 years.
''Using 1930s milling machines is a very useful skill and a very good
training, but being able to work effectively with computer-assisted
design and computer-assisted manufacture is what is important now, and
this is why we have been changing over the laboratories, changing the
workshops, changing the technique.''
Today, Stow has three main Schools: Engineering, Management and
General Education, and Science and Computing.
Stow's new profile-raising architectural embellishment then, is the
outward manifestation of many major changes within the college, as it
strives in its highly competitive marketplace, to achieve what the
Principal calls ''a friendly look, a place which appeals to people.
''We wanted the foyer to look more welcoming. Before the new entrance
was added, it looked like a rather old engineering works, very austere
indeed.''
Professor Snaith explains that the changes ''have mainly come to
fruition since the college became an incorporated body two-and-a-half
years ago, together with all the other further education colleges in
Scotland. This allowed us to decide where our money would be spent; to
make money by way of offering our services to industry and commerce, and
to purpose-designed training programmes which would meet specifically,
the needs of industry.''
The new entrance with its central, receptionist-manned inquiries desk,
sets the tone for the whole college. It is welcoming and attractive,
light and airy, appealing to students, staff and employers alike, and is
the most publicly noticeable feature of the major refurbishment
programme which has been ongoing throughout the college in recent years.
The aim has been to improve the aesthetic appearance and to utilise
outmoded space and turn it to useful purpose.
The net result of all this has been refurbished classrooms with
lowered ceilings, carpeted floors and curtained windows, walls painted
in tasteful pastel emulsion; extensively modified laboratory and
workshop facilities made appropriate to the needs of the present where
the emphasis is largely on computer-assisted learning, computer-assisted
manufacture, computer-assisted design, computing, on-line
instrumentation and so on.
''What we are doing,'' says Professor Snaith, ''is getting the
academic work into the most useful and effective form. Simultaneously,
we are getting the labs and workshops into modern, student-friendly and
practical shape, and giving ourselves the facility for further extension
and alteration so that the building is a place where students can feel
comfortable.''
On the third floor, the former assembly hall has been converted to a
Flexible Learning unit which was opened last year. Its purpose is to
give learning assistance to full-time, part-time, open and/or distance
learning students. It has been divided into different areas to meet the
various needs of students, and a suite of computers can be accessed
using an appointment scheme, making it easier for students to plan their
time and activity. Part of the funding for The Flex, as it is known,
came from the European Regional Development Fund.
The college has also been building up its student guidance services,
as part of an all-embracing package to its 1850 ll-time equivalent
students. There is awareness that many of those who study at Stow -- in
common with other academic establishments -- face financial problems.
College secretary Peter Rea points out: ''We have installed a
computerised information package which our stdents find valuable in that
it provides information on fnding, budgeting and related matters. We are
always improving and we do try to help students as best we can,
lecturers have a very caring attitude towards them.
''We care about our students, and we try to give them the best that we
can in order that they will meet the requirements of the outside world
with an employer.''

Latest figures paint mixed picture on current growth and future
prospects
UK output has risen at its slowest rate for two years and production
actually fell in the past four months in Scotland and North-west
England, according to the findings of the November Regional Trends
Survey jointly produced by the Confederation of British Industry and
Business Strategies.
Many manufacturers remain cautious about export orders for the coming
four months with growth expectations weaker than at any time in the last
two years. However, in Scotland, while orders have risen moderately over
the past four months, they are expected to increase much faster in the
next four months, reflecting rapid growth in export orders.
Although output did fall, a large increase is now projected. Even so,
employment levels in Scotland are thought likely to continue declining.
Estimates based on the survey show a decline in manufacturing employment
to 296,000 in the final quarter of 1995, down 3% on a year ago.
The survey shows that differences in overall demand in areas
throughout the UK are largely a reflection of varying export
performances.
Demand expectations in Scotland are much stronger than in the UK as a
whole with exports, once again, playing a key role and optimism showing
a further rise. Optimism about the general business situation in
Scotland has also increased, but is much less than for export prospects.
It is the second consecutive CBI/BSL survey, though, that has reported
a fall in output over the preceding four months in Scotland. This
reflects not only a weaker orders position but also the need to run down
stocks of finished goods further. As a result, more firms are working
below full capacity than at any time since April 1993. Nevertheless,
output is forecast to increase substantially over the coming four
months, in line with the expected pick-up in demand.
The hiatus in output growth has resulted in a sharp decline in the
proportion of firms expecting either capacity constraints or shortages
of skilled labour to occur, the CBI said. A larger proportion of firms
in Scotland are working below capacity than in any other part of the UK
except the North of England.
For the last two surveys the rate at which average costs have been
increasing in Scotland is reported to have been lower than in the UK. A
slower rate of increase is expected to continue over the next four
months. But in contrast average domestic selling prices seem to be
rising faster in this survey, increasing at a rate a little above the
UK's. With a small rise in export prices, this suggests that margins may
be under less pressure than in the last survey.
On investment, planned capital expenditure on plant and machinery over
the next 12 months is ''strongly positive''.
These investment intentions are the strongest since April 1988 with
increasing efficiency now the over-riding motive. Firms are increasingly
confident -- possibly reflecting past investment in plant capacity
coming on stream -- of meeting expected demand, even though demand
itself is projected to rise sharply in the short term. The results also
suggest that planned expenditure on product and process innovation and
on training and retraining continues to be very positive, pointing to
large increases in actual spending over the next year.
For the UK as a whole, the need to increase efficiency is once again
the most important reason for planned investment, having been displaced
in July by the need to expand capacity in East Anglia and by replacement
of existing capacity in the North of England.
At the UK level uncertainty about demand is again the factor most
limiting investment over the year ahead, having been exceeded in July by
inadequate net returns. Demand uncertainty is cited most by firms in the
North of England, the South-east, the North-west and the West Midlands.

The MoD is expected to announce an award within the next six weeks.
GEC's Yarrow yard has already won orders for nine Type 23s.
In the first six months of the year Vosper increased its profits by

D W SMITH'S suggestion that some form of National Service would in
some way contribute to improving the behavioural patterns of young
people today is singularly unconvincing (November 4).
Does he not realise that during the years we had compulsory military
National Service the vast majority of those called up were already
enjoying the advantages of a sound grounding in wholesome discipline and
acceptable behaviour?
Such attributes were initially founded by caring parents, later
buttressed by schoolteachers who had the power to impose the rules, and
consequently by society as a whole.
The malaise, as he describes it, did not start with the cessation of
National Service. It started during the 1960s when the Home Secretary of
the then Government repeatedly advised the nation, ad nauseam, that the
permissive society was the civilised society and that the civilised
society was the free society.
The children of the permissive sixties are the parents of today's
lumpen adolescents, the vast majority of whom appear to be outwith
anyone's control, be they parents, teachers, police, or any other
authority.
Compulsory National Service? Your average teenager today would simply
refuse to go, then where would you be? Of those who did answer the call,
many would spend most of their time in what used to be called the
glasshouses, or what I now understand are called schools of correction.
Besides, the Armed Services do not want such young people -- young
people who have been denied parental love and guidance which is their
birthright and all because of the permissive society into which their
parents and consequently they were born.
Would your correspondent's proposed conscription apply to the female
of the species? The behaviour of our young women is every bit as bad as
that of our young men and often clearly worse.
It was not always thus and that could not be credited to National
Service since the Act which introduced it did not apply to women.

WHAAT Fettle returns to Kelso, his favourite racecourse, today for the
feature race, the Middlemas Licensed Trade Wholesalers Handicap Chase,
attempting to win over the Border track for the eighth time.
Owned by Mackinnon Mills of Langholm, the 10-year-old has already been
earmarked by trainer Gordon Richards as this season's Grand National
horse.
Whaat Fettle carries top weight and will have to be at his best to
hold off Mary Reveley's Bayrouge, who won three on the trot last season
but unseated Peter Niven at Kempton a month ago.
Emerald Storm, an impressive winner for Peter Monteith at the last
meeting here, is not without a chance. Tony Dobbin, who rode him then,
is claimed to ride Whaat Fettle, but Tom Jenks will be an able
substitute.
Another contender is Lucinda Russell's Fiveleigh Builds, beaten a head
by Ninfa at Carlisle after having won at Perth and Hexham.
The Mackinnon Novices' Chase should also produce an exciting finish.
The top three, Uron V, Gale Ahead, and Addington Boy, have all been
succcessful recently and will be difficult to separate. An interesting
'dark horse' is Lucinda Russell's Rocket Run, bought by her father in
Ireland, where he did well in point-to-points.
It is Scottish Sports Aid Charity day, which will be marked by the
presentation of a cheque for #1000 to promising 800 metres runner
Michael Combe of Jedburgh.

IN July of this year, during one of his last graduation addresses as
Principal of Glasgow University, Sir William Kerr Fraser spoke of how
students, in response to a recent survey, had rated a career in politics
very low in terms of contribution to society -- lower than, say, lawyers
or dentists or airmen.
To the audience of new arts graduates (of which I was one) and their
families, Sir William's comments came as no surprise: he was speaking,
after all, in the week following the Conservative Party leadership
contest, and in the midst of yet another rank scandal in the controversy
over executive pay. We were, though, in good spirits, an audience rather
used to bad news.
But it would be a mistake, even in this period of ingrained cynicism
towards politics and politicians, to pass over findings of the sort Sir
William reported as mere expressions of apathy or malaise. They are more
worrisome than that.
Contrary to tabloid wisdom, people -- particularly young poeple --
rarely tire of politics: the act of debate comes as naturally to us as
language. What exhausts and dispirits us are the workings of political
mechanism, which amounts to a suppression of the actual business of
politics by the very machinery meant to facilitate it. In the evasions,
chicanery, and forked-tongues of our elected representatives we see all
the device of politics and none of the matter. And as the business of
government becomes more a matter of electability and less a matter of
policy, this disenchantment is likely to increase.
The very conspicuous recent reprehension of Clare Short is important
for reasons that transcend the particular issue over which she was
rebuked. As Brian Meek has argued in these pages, whatever your opinion
on legalising cannabis, the fact is that Tony Blair, by silencing Ms
Short, has ensured that the debate continues to be conducted in the
poorest intellectual terms. Blair's tactic, though Mr Meek might not
concede this, is a familiar one to observers of Conservative Party
conferences. There, one can see many of the most pressingly complex
issues facing our society -- immigration, crime, nationality, Europe --
brutally simplified and polarised, reduced to gratifyingly moralistic
debates between staunch rights and iniquitous wrongs, between white and
black, elect and reprobate, us and them.
Tony Blair, happy to partake in this intellectual reductionism,
stifled the debate on cannabis to sustain the aura of his own
electability. He may have benefited in the opinion polls, but he does so
at a cost to our democracy.
Clare Short suffered because she dared to challenge the false,
moralistic simplicity of the drugs debate. Her error was to suggest, in
the light of chief constables' recent reports, that the drug problem in
Britain was now beyond enforcement of law, that perhaps the simple
pieties upon which the debate had for so long turned were inadequate and
that other solutions must now be intelligently scrutinised.
It would have been a good debate to have had. But alas, it was
intolerable to New Labour whose fidelity is to the ambition for
government, not to productive or effective political inquiry. Insensible
of this, Clare Short committed the sin (odd for an old-fashioned
conviction politician) of over-refinement.
To be fair, popularity is the basis of Tony Blair's job description;
and, of course, in Britain the way to be popular is to be simple. But
can I be alone in feeling that the recent actions of New Labour have
contributed significantly to the erosion of our already much decayed
political process? We have been robbed, in the first place, of a genuine
alternative to the Tories. But more importantly, by playing the Tory
way, Mr Blair has helped to debase further the very crucial democratic
practices of inquiry and debate.
In the past few months we have seen and heard so many remarkable
things from New Labour: there was the praise of Thatcherism; the
personal courting of Rupert Murdoch (the moment of embrace so revolting,
one assumes, that it was conducted off-camera); Jack Straw ingratiating
himself to Middle England with an attack on the homeless, penniless, and
destitute -- surely the disgrace of the decade for a so-called social
democratic party.
And then, this summer, the spectacle of poor old Roy Hattersley, that
mild darling of the Kinnock eighties, lost somewhere out in left field
for defending the principle of centrally funded comprehensive schooling.
Irrespective of party persuasion, do we not feel that the resignation of
so many core principles and the suppression of dissent by a major party
marks a surrender of a sort that is damaging to our democracy?
The ominous event in all this, I would suggest, was Mr Blair's
Antipodean sojourn. It is a nippy irony indeed that, subsequent to the
courting of Rupert Murdoch, Tony Blair should find himself forcefully
silencing a woman who has suffered disgracefully on the pages of the
tabloid press. The Murdoch world-view (God forbid that it should stretch
that far) is an eminently bankable combination of simple-mindedness and
moral censoriousness -- for so long the very basis of Tory popularity.
That the Labour leader should be prepared to flirt with such an outlook
tells us a great deal about the way he sees his politics these days.
The widespread degradation of principles and of quality debate in this
country is a symptom of the obsession with electability -- an obsession
to which Tony Blair and New Labour have shown themselves in thrall.
While this continues, we the electorate are the losers.
The poet Emily Dickinson once wrote that ''the truth in circuit
lies''. To make the personal political for a moment, we might say that
our democracy too depends upon on our energy and willingness to pursue
the paths and byways of the controversies we live by. Vital issues are
intricate, not simplistic. We do not need our politicians to know all
the answers: but we do need them to want to know.

WITHOUT doubt the people of Skye are better off today than they were
before the opening of their beautiful new bridge. Movement between the
island and the mainland is now so much easier and speedier and the cost
has remained substantially the same.
Why then are they so ungrateful? Do they seriously believe that any
Government, whether Labour, Conservative or SNP, would have delivered a
bridge financed wholly from the public purse? And why do they feel so
justified in their assumption that the general taxpayer should subsidise
them?
They are the beneficiaries of this new bridge. Surely they can accept
their good fortune and pay their dues graciously.

NO doubt many in the central belt and other parts of Scotland will
consider recent events at the Isle of Skye toll bridge to be a little
local difficulty, something which need not concern them unduly. However,
I would ask that they give a little further consideration to the matter.
We on Skye are protesting about the introduction of private funding of
public roads and, with the highest tolls in Europe, its adverse effects
on our economy.
If the principle of private funding and high tolls is allowed to go
unchallenged, it is reasonable to assume that the Government will
continue with this policy on public roads in other parts of the country.
Where next? The A1 Edinburgh-Newcastle? The European Commissioner for
Transport, Neil Kinnock, has recently announced that there will be no
European money for that before the next century.
Or maybe the A96 Inverness-Aberdeen? The Government has consistently
refused to find money to upgrade it despite high accident rates.
Or maybe some accident blackspot near a village where a child has to
cross the road to get to school? There may be a bargain rate of #1.99 a
mile instead of #2.44 a mile if it's simply a road and not a bridge.
This will be helpful if there is no alternative route.

IT would be all too easy for us, the largest organisation representing
small businesses with many members in the tourist industry, to have
jumped in on the back of your tourism articles and made, possibly, a
biased comment.
We decided to wait and see what reaction there would be from your
readers, those directly involved in tourism, and the public.
We congratulate The Herald for having commissioned Jill Crawshaw and
published her provocative accounts of her trip to Scotland. You deserve
further congratulation for having published the correspondence that this
has provoked, much of which condemned yourselves for having published
these articles, in our opinion quite unjustifiably.
Unfortunately the letters have been largely predictable. Many have
rushed to defend Scotland's tourism and a few even insult Jill Crawshaw
as a bigoted middle-class Englishwoman. She was a guest in our country
and we have to accept that she was being brutally honest in an attempt
to tell us where we are going wrong.
Others have condemned Scottish tourism as shoddy and ill-led. It is
not. There is much for which we can be proud. The leadership of the
Scottish Tourist Board is realistic and open-minded. Unfortunately the
articles appear to have pushed the STB into a corner and the defensive
letter by Ian Grant, chairman (November 3), has not seriously addressed
the problems raised. On the other hand, the article by Derek Reid, the
STB's chief executive, is rather more conciliatory and appears to accept
the fact that all is not as it should be (November 7). However he still
adopts a defensive role. That is unfortunate.
We in the Federation of Small Businesses represent possibly as many as
3000 businesses in the tourist business. We also represent many people
who take breaks (be it a hard-earned week, a weekend, or just a day off)
in Scotland. We see both sides of this argument.
We are also aware that tourism in Scotland contributes over #2000m of
income into the economy. It is therefore a very important industry.
You are to be praised for publishing the articles and provoking this
essential argument. We advocate a more positive response to it and as a
first step we intend meeting the STB to discuss how best we can improve
matters to the benefit of the visitor (such as Jill Crawshaw) and the
tourist industry alike.

I CAME to Scotland from Belgium for the first time as a tourist in
1983 as a passenger on a tour during a rainy week in October.
It was love at first sight. After living here for 11 years now and
working in a seasonal hotel on Skye every summer I am still positive.
I can fully agree with Jill Crawshaw on one point only: money. The
prices for food and accommodation are too high. They alone keep a lot of
interested potential customers away. Those who can afford to come are
often spoiled after staying in swish high-class hotels around the world.
Yet, in my experience, the majority go home with a favourable impression
and do come back.
People in Scotland and in the Highlands and Islands in particular, are
among the most friendly, helpful and courteous anywhere. Where in
today's world can a lone tourist walk along the beach after dinner and
enjoy the sunset without fear for his or her safety?

Catriona Stevens examines the exemplary record of a leading Scottish
academic institution.
IT'S Saturday morning at Dollar Academy. Various pretty young women in
army camouflage emerge from the dining-hall beside the school gates and
disappear across the green acres devoted to hockey later in the day. The
Combined Cadet Force is, like most things in Dollar, co-educational. Two
small boys in short trousers and navy blazers are throwing sticks into
the branches of a large chestnut tree in an effort to dislodge conkers.
Their blazer badges, with ship emblem, proclaim in Latin that they carry
the fortunes of youth. The chestnuts fall.
There are other great trees in the grounds, though probably none as
old as the school itself, founded in 1818 through the legacy of London
ship-owner Captain John McNabb. The pillared, classical facade of the
main school building -- designed by William Playfair of Edinburgh New
Town fame -- looks its handsome best in the early autumn sunshine.
To the west lie the rugby pitches, for Dollar is a mighty name in
school rugby. And, above the campus and playing fields, the Ochils --
now a ginger patchwork of dried bracken -- rear their humps and hollows.
It's a spectacularly lovely setting for schooldays.
In the range of Scottish, and indeed British, schools there is nowhere
quite like Dollar. Once a direct-grant school but now in the independent
sector, it continues to flourish in its 177th year. Success has dictated
physical expansion in the 90s. Today Lord Younger will open the new
building which bears his name. Financed by an appeal involving parents,
former pupils, and the wider Dollar community, the block contains eight
mathematics classrooms and the business studies and computing
departments. Like the adjacent music building (opened by another eminent
Scot, the late Sir Alexander Gibson), it has been designed by architect
Colin Ross.
Mr Ross had the challenge of creating contemporary buildings to
complement Playfair's grand original. Bravely, he has shunned pastiche
and, with this latest building -- which backs on the science block -- he
has created a companionable quadrangle. The aluminium roofs of his two
buildings won't please everyone aesthetically; but the material is
durable, the soundproofing good. With a network of some 85 computers in
the new building and adjacent technology department, the Dollar young
have every chance to be electronically proficient.
Dollar can claim, among other distinctions, to be the oldest
co-educational boarding school in the country -- drawing its young
residents from all round the globe. Once they might have been the
children of empire builders (the tea-planter, railbuilding connection
was strong in India), or young Africans from the continent that Scottish
missionaries did so much to explore, even scions of the Ethiopian royal
house. The school was originally a Church of Scotland foundation but
welcomes children of all denominations and faiths.
John Robertson -- who became Dollar's twelfth rector last year after
seven years as deputy -- discerns three strands among today's boarders.
There are Scots from the cities or inaccessible parts of the country.
There are youngsters from elsewhere in the UK and mainland Europe,
especially France and Germany -- though last year's intake included a
Spanish boy (''who became a naturalised Scot!'') and a Hungarian girl.
Dollar looks forward to developing its East European links.
The third group of boarders -- including children of expatriates --
comes from even farther afield: from the US, Canada, and South America;
a large number from the Persian Gulf; and a handful from Hong Kong.
Dollar's internationalism has deep roots.
Dollar Academy has always also been a day school. Because of its
strategic site, pupils come from all points of the compass -- Edinburgh,
Dunfermline, Kircaldy to the east, Stirling and Alloa to the west,
Falkirk to the south, and Perth to the north, to make up its roll of
1100.
Developments in communications have meant that pupils travel from
further afield than 20 or 25 years ago, when, says Mr Robertson -- with
just a touch of exaggeration -- the journey from Edinburgh or Glasgow
''was something akin to a polar expedition''. This has of course
affected boarding numbers, as has the general decline in numbers
throughout the UK.
Dollar currently has some 150 boarders. There are three girls' houses
and three for boys -- all, like the main school, handsome stone
buildings surrounded by gardens. Dollar views the shrinking in boarding
numbers as an opportunity to improve quality, and Mr Robertson points
with quiet pride to the ''marvellous pilot inspection'' carried out by
HM inspectors last year on boarding accommodation and life. ''In my
view,'' says John Robertson, ''Dollar owes its unique quality to the
fact we do have as many boarders.'' Academically, Dollar is always
comfortably among the top 10 Scottish schools, offering a wide, liberal
education even-handedly to its boy and girl pupils in the best Scottish
tradition. Some 80% of its pupils go on to degree courses in Scotland,
elsewhere in the UK, or increasingly abroad. Good academic results are
seen in Dollar as the bedrock on which everything else depends.
Currently there are just two more boys than girls on the school role. A
more significant statistic may be that in the most recent Higher Physics
exam, 79% of the boys passed with grades A to C, and 84% of the girls.
With a staff of more than 90, emerging talent has a very good chance
of being noticed. ''There is no forcefeeding at Dollar,'' says the
rector, ''but extensive opportunity for all. The really talented are not
quite taken for granted but it's almost expected of them. What's
marvellous is to see someone who has not seemed particularly skilled
find a niche.''
Dollar's alumni range from Sir James Dewar, inventor of the vacuum
flask, and Lord Heyworth, a former chief of Unilever, to Craig McMurdo
of the pop group That Swing Thang and broadcaster Derek Jamieson's wife
Ellen. John Cameron, a former president of the National Farmers' Union
of Scotland and steam engine enthusiast, is the present chairman of the
governors.
The Playfair building acquired a third floor when it was revamped
after a fire in 1961. Beyond its bronze doors lies the classically
proportioned library, very much a working environment for senior pupils.
Dollar's art department is also in the Playfair building. Its summer
exhibitions overflow with creativity. The stairway to the rector's study
is always decorated with pupils' artwork. At the moment this includes
bold panels by an Australian pupil who has woven Ned Kelly and his
coal-scuttle helmet into her theme.
Dollar's music building with its practice rooms and splendid
glass-fronted auditorium has stimulated music-making in the school since
its completion in 1991. Last autumn the senior choir and orchestra gave
a spirited performance of Haydn's Nelson Mass in the Church of the Holy
Rude, Stirling. In 1997 Dollar's young musicians will tour Argentina and
Chile. The Nelson Mass has been especially requested by the Chileans.
Each year a drama production and a musical are also mounted.
Dollar children have recently won distinction in competitions as
diverse as mathematics problem-solving and linoleum design. Dollar's
rugby prowess is marked by the fact that its 1st XV is the only Scottish
side invited to the St Joseph's rugby tournament for schools at Ipswich.
Mothers faced with their sons' muddied white strips might wish the
school played in less vulnerable gear, but ''the silent white machine of
Dollar'' can be an intimidating sight.
The combined cadet force -- there is no compulsion to join -- has some
200 boys and girls enrolled and enjoys strong links with the Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders. Separate boys' and girls' teams were recently
judged top in a Highland cadet tactical competition.

TO suggest as you did that visitors who make repeat visits to Scotland
are little short of a miracle is complete nonsense as consistently
Scotland attracts a very high level of visitors (80%) on repeat visits.
Scottish tourism must surely therefore, be responsible for millions of
miracles every year.
The criticisms of heritage displays and the assertions that they
represent bad investments are also unfair. As part of a major effort to
expand and improve the range of indoor visitor attractions over the past
decade, a variety of agencies and individuals have worked timelessly to
restore historic buildings and imaginatively present aspects of
Scotland's rich and diverse heritage.

The youngsters of Dollar are encouraged to think of others. Every two
years, the whole school population, from five to 18, takes to the Ochils
on a sponsored walk, raising some #20,000 each time.
Local charities such as Struan House for autistic children benefit, as
do a range of others from Sir Malcolm Sargent's Cancer Fund for Children
to the National Asthma Campaign.
A pupil-run charities committee runs discos, dances, competitions, and
all sorts of activities to raise funds. Though there is staff guidance,
''pupils are given enormous responsibilities,'' says the rector. A
tins-and-packets campaign for the local elderly is a seasonal
undertaking.
''It's easy to push the noblesse oblige button,'' says Mr Robertson,
''but many pupils are astonished at how much real work is required.''

MR Arthur Scargill asks a question. Can socialists of his sort
continue to exist, let alone try to be active, within the new Labour
Party? Although his boats are not yet burned it seems clear that he
believes the answer to the question must be negative. He threatened to
leave the Labour Party after the resounding defeat of his attempts to
resuscitate Clause 4 at last month's Labour Party conference and it
seems clear that the five weeks since that event have hardened his
resolve. Whether his proposals for a Socialist Labour Party can be
launched successfully are quite a different matter. His arguments for
establishing the new party, set down as they are in a historical
framework, are logical within a radical socialist perspective and will
undoubtedly appeal to like-minded left-wingers. He believes that New
Labour is not a socialist party, being now almost indistinguishable from
the Liberal Democrats, and that Labour's new rules will make it
impossible to promote genuine socialism. From an objective point of view
this is nonsense but there is no doubt in denying that a number of
disaffected Labour Party members might agree with it.
For that reason Mr Scargill and his putative party must be taken
seriously, particularly as he has shrewdly identified groups formed to
fight the poll tax and motorway building, animal rights campaigners, and
anti-nuclear lobbies as the voices of true protest, with the unspoken
but obvious thought that they would be ideal recruits for his new party.
It is not clear what this would mean for New Labour and Mr Blair. It is
obvious that a number of left-wingers might leave the Labour Party to
join Mr Scargill in the SLP but it is impossible to estimate what effect
this might have on individual constituencies or national organisation.
The aim of fighting every seat is surely unrealistic unless the SLP has
access to funds which are not obvious at the moment. More probably Mr
Blair and the Labour modernisers would heave a sigh of relief at the
departure of Mr Scargill and his supporters. A thorn would be removed
from New Labour flesh and Mr Blair could present his party to the
electorate shorn of the bogeymen and women who have deterred voters in
the past. Mr Scargill is at least a fighter, and in the cause of
political pluralism we should regard his new party with the greatest
interest.

WE do the Scottish tourist industry a great disservice in promoting

Without rain our scenery would be rather different, and there are

So let us promote the fact that the early summer is a good time to

ON reading Julie Davidson's criticism of the Scottish Tourist Board I
find I had anticipated her strategy: tell tourists the truth about our
varied weather, prepare them for the worst.
We had visitors from New York State in our merry month of May. We
booked them for a few days in Skye. All the way I warned them of the
inclemency of our weather, to expect mist and rain.
They were grieviously disappointed. Each day the sun shone brighter
than it had done the day before.

I AM very sorry that some viewers were disappointed that Reporting
Scotland did not provide live coverage of the whole ceremony to
inaugurate the Lockerbie Memorial Cairn at Arlington National Cemetery.
In fact, we never intended to do so; nor did we say we would.
Our outside broadcast team in Washington -- a producer, a cameraman,
and Jackie Bird -- did excellent work but technical constraints made it
impossible to sustain open-ended live coverage. We made it clear that we
would be showing edited highlights on Sunday.
We expected to be able to include President Clinton's arrival, and
did. However, the President did not start speaking until well after 7.30
pm and the whole ceremony did not finish until after 8pm.
The disappointment felt by viewers is a matter of great regret to us.
However, I hope they did appreciate BBC Scotland's coverage of the
issues surrounding the ceremony and the build-up to the event. We were
the only Scottish broadcaster to commit to this level of coverage.

WHEN ideology meets reality there is often a nasty crunching sound.
Thus we have a modest Navy which has had its maintenance support cut
from under it by the application of political ideology, competition, and
looming privatisation. The issue is the refitting and servicing of
Trident submarines and the culprit is the policy of competition between
defence contractors which was forced on Rosyth, Devonport, and a
reluctant Navy in the early 1980s and which has proved subsequently to
be an unworkable shambles.
The theory seemed fine, but then theories often do. If Rosyth and
Devonport could be jostled towards privatisation and then required to
compete against one another for the refitting work there would be
savings for the Government and benefits for private contractors: so ran
the theory, but reality has intruded painfully.
Trident refitting should have been carried out at Rosyth but the
Ministry of Defence held a competition which was won by Devonport. It is
likely the political requirements of the Government in southern England
were involved, but even allowing for that the decision was a nonsense.
This has been proved with the realisation that Devonport cannot
modernise itself sufficiently for the task without incurring huge
expense.
Should the work be shifted back to Rosyth? Not a bit of it; that would
be too politically embarrassing. The Government is now in an almighty
mess with the Ministry of Defence unwilling to let the private company
which runs Devonport modernise the dockyard for Trident, as we said in
this newspaper six months ago, and the enthusiastic privatiser, Michael
Portillo, faced with the prospect of either subsidising the costs of the
private Devonport company or abandoning the privatisation altogether.
No doubt a dubious compromise will be found, especially as southern
England is an even more sensitive issue for the Tories so near to an
election, but there is a stark truth which Mr Portillo will be unwilling
to acknowledge. If the Navy is too small to allow successful competition
for its business between two companies, it is therefore necessary for
the refitting work to be directed by the Government to the best
dockyard. That dockyard is Rosyth, as the Scottish Chambers of Commerce
has sensibly indicated.

THE slowdown in activity in the second and third quarters to just
below its trend rate has allowed the Bank of England to trim its
inflation forecasts. The central projection is within a whisker of its
2.5% target, enough of an improvement to let the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street off the hook over interest rates.
The inflation report notes that stockbuilding contributed 0.75% to
gross domestic product in the second quarter, but more detailed figures
on the economy's performance in the third quarter are needed to assess
how much destocking subsequently took place.
The sharp fall in manufacturing output in September, reported on
Monday, suggests extensive destocking over a wide front, especially in
clothing and footwear.
The immediate outlook for activity is clouded by fears over the extent
of the destocking that will be needed to redress the earlier involuntary
build-up as demand fell away.
The Bank is in little doubt that sooner or later the pace of activity
will pick up as consumption recovers from the impact of two years of
personal tax hikes equivalent to 2.25% of personal disposable incomes.
The report says that consumption has adjusted to the tighter fiscal
regime and is likely to return to growth at around its trend rate over
the next year or so.
Export volumes should be boosted by sterling's depreciation earlier in
the year and by the speedy recovery of the US economy from its mid-cycle
blip.
On the other hand, investment is likely to be held back by low demand
for commercial buildings and growth in public spending is expected to
fall.
Even so the betting is that the economy will bounce back next year.
The trouble is that further weakness meantime on the back of continued
destocking could persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer to cut
interest rates early next year.
Though the Bank does not express an opinion on whether such a rate cut
would be justified, the impression is that the Old Lady's preference
would be for rates to remain on hold.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke should be wary of defying advice he gets
from the Bank against a rate cut. The danger is that it would start to
take effect when the economy was beginning to pick up naturally and any
Budget tax cuts were feeding through to disposable incomes. A wrong
decision would have to be reversed.
The Confederation of British Industry for one has been careful to
qualify any support it has lent to the case for lower rates by insisting
that any cut would have to be sustainable.

NORTHERN Uproar, in support, were flagged-up as stroppy, snotty and
frighteningly young. The last bit is true. Even if you don't know the
band, you will know their Rollercoaster single -- a New Wave classic,
echoing a time before these guys were born. They receive a warm response
for energy and ambition.
Enter the Charlatans, to the sound of This Will Be Our Year by the
Zombies, Tim miming energetically. Here is a scary thought: the
Charlatans as Argent, to a tribal beat. Except that instead of urging us
to hold our heads up and leaving it at that, they actually managed to
levitate a large part of the audience.
How do they manage this while keeping their own feet firmly on the
ground? As usual, by maintaining that big rolling swagger. One of their
best songs, Just Lookin' comes early in the set. They chuck in The Only
One . . . halfway through, where others would hold the all-time
favourite back for the encore. They know what we want from the past and
they know that the new album is the berries.
Without preaching or making any kind of political statement the
Charlatans make an entire audience feel good about themselves. This is
not supplying opium to the people, but giving a glimpse of how things
could be. Therefore the Charlatans are a political band.

HAVING spent all my political life supporting law and order I now face
a day in court for refusing to pay the scandalous toll charges on the
Skye bridge.
These tolls, which range from #8.60 return for a car (in winter) to
#75 return for a coach (in summer), to travel over a short bridge
crossing are an absolute disgrace and grossly disadvantage people who
live on the island.
These people already pay far more for their fuel than those on the
mainland and consequently more in VAT to the Government. They pay #135
road tax, the same as everyone else, yet are denied access to the
national road network without having to pay a minimum of #8.60 every
time they require to leave Skye.
The tolls are a national issue of great importance as if the
Government succeeds in establishing these tolls they will be used in the
future to justify charges for access to other areas of our country.
The people of Skye are willing to pay a similar charge to those
currently levied on the Forth and Erskine bridges. They are not being
militant but merely seek fair and equitable treatment. They deserve the
support of the Scottish people.

THE leaked suggestion that #1000m of social security money could be
axed to provide tax cuts in the Budget has not been denied by Mr Peter
Lilley. We will find out in three weeks, according to the Social
Security Secretary, when the Budget announcement gives details of how
Chancellor Clarke will seek to shape the nation's economy in the period
before the General Election. This is not heartening news, especially for
the young receiving housing benefit, those receiving industrial injury
benefit, and that perennial target of misplaced Tory ire, the lone
parent.
Mr Lilley's body language and his perpetually uneasy mien tell us
nothing, but we can safely assume the leak is either substantially true,
or is possibly the sort of manipulated leak which will lead us to expect
the worst and therefore be happily surprised when the reality turns out
to be less shocking. These are murky waters, but they are crystal clear
compared with the muddy policy ponds in which Ministers are currently
paddling. There is little disagreement that social security policy needs
reform. It needs to be shaped, not cut; crafted, not hewn with a blunt
axe. It requires, above all, some serious thinking about what we need
and what we can afford and a recognition that the result must work for,
and with the efforts of, individuals and families.
The Government accepts with enthusiasm the requirement for reform but
it approaches the task in quite the wrong way. Instead of properly
analysing need, the ability of the state to pay, and the overriding
principle of lessening social distress, the Government begins its
assessment with the balance sheet. Worse, we can be sure that cutting
the budget will be done solely to provide tax cuts -- which may be sound
Tory policy but which has not been proved to appeal to the general
public. Recent studies have shown, in contrast, that many citizens would
forego tax cuts, which experience shows can be nullified by indirect tax
rises, to preserve public services including social security.
A serious debate on this issue is needed and it should precede, not
follow, cuts in the budget. Whatever Mr Lilley might claim, there has
been insufficient debate. If he wishes help we might suggest the burden
of aid be directed to the unemployed and children who have replaced the
elderly as the most vulnerable element in society.

MARY BRENNAN reveals an ambitious live arts project for Edinburgh
THE following statements won't form part of Forced Entertainment's
litany of self-confessed guilts when they present Speak Bitterness at
Edinburgh's Assembly Rooms tonight -- ''We only ever went there during
the Fringe''. ''We didn't believe the place was open any other time . .
.'' But they may well be heard, muttered in accents of excuse, by
members of the public who don't include the George Street venue on their
personal map of places to go.
It's a problem which Simon Robson hopes to tackle head on with
Assembly Alive!, a three-week season of music, dance, comedy, poetry and
live art. Looking around at what was on offer, Robson decided that
Edinburgh was already well served in terms of theatre. ''It seemed silly
to try and compete with the established theatres by bringing in more
plays -- so I looked for a gap.
''And of course, there's very little live art comes into the city,
even during the Fringe. And it's a particular enthusiasm of mine so I
thought -- here's a really good opportunity to introduce an Edinburgh
audience to work that's at the cutting edge of performance-making.''
For Tim Etchells, of Forced Entertainment, the question of future
interest in their work has been heavily shadowed by the recent lack of
support and understanding shown by the Arts Council. Last winter, just
as the company was chalking up a decade of radical, exploratory work --
much of it exposing the fragmented nature of our present society -- it
had the plug pulled on funding. Despite consistently enthusiastic
responses from audiences, critics, programmers and colleagues in the
field, the Arts Council's Drama Panel apparently found the work wanting
. . .
After a vigorous campaign of protest from venues and individuals
across Britain there was a reprieve of sorts: funding was given for the
project now touring as Speak Bitterness. And no, it is not a diatribe
against funders. It is a carefully crafted outpouring of guilt.
Seven people confess to everything. Etchells recalls a quotation from
Michael Hare on the horror of Vietnam. ''It's about his realisation that
we are as responsible for everything we see, as for everything we do.
And that's at the core of Speak Bitterness.
''People take on the guilt for things they haven't done, as if they
feel the need to shoulder the weight of blame for humanity. But the
performers don't ever give an opinion, they're not judgemental. They
just confide these things to the audience. And it can be something
really trivial -- like 'We never had the right trainers'. Or horrendous,
like 'We burned people's faces off with a blowtorch'.
''But the listeners don't know if it's true. Audiences end up laughing
because some of it is very funny. But it's also very pointed -- and it
does bring people up short,'' Etchells says.
Will it bring the Arts Council up short? Etchells laughs rather
cheerlessly. ''It's probably one of the least 'theatrical' pieces we've
done. Even if we think it's one of the strongest.'' What besets Forced
Entertainment is, in a way, not unlike what Simon Robson is combating
with his Assembly Alive! season -- the hard-set nature of
preconceptions.
Forced Entertainment is funded by a division labelled ''drama'' and
yet very little that they devise would fit naturally between the covers
of a French's acting edition.
''It's not work that fits easily into niches,'' says Simon Robson.
''And that's why I think it's appropriate for this particular season. I
want Edinburgh to look again at what the Assembly Rooms represents
within the city and realise that it isn't just a building that comes
alive for the Fringe and doesn't do anything else for the rest of the
year. It's my hope that, in the future, we'll be able to mount
programmes of interesting, challenging work twice yearly in April and
November,'' he says.
Assembly Alive! is now underway. Forced Entertainment present Speak
Bitterness from tonight until Saturday, heading up a season of live art
that also includes performances from XpressMunich, Donna Rutherford &amp;
Co, Wreckless Sleepers and Elysian Fields Productions. There's comedy,
writers events, club nights, music and dance -- look out for Matthew
Hawkins with Great Moments of Purcell and Blow on Novembery 19.
In all, a very bright and energetic programme which augurs well for
the future of the Assembly Rooms as a city central venue with a finger
on the pulse of comtemporary culture.

TWO senior Government Ministers thought to be in the firing line from
Sir Richard Scott's arms-to-Iraq inquiry have escaped virtually
unscathed, it was reported last night.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who
signed Public Interest Immunity certificates -- the so-called ''gagging
orders'' -- in the Matrix Churchill trial, receive little or no
criticism in Sir Richard's draft report, according to a BBC report.
It claimed Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell -- responsible for
advising Ministers they had to sign the certificates -- would instead
bear the brunt of the criticism.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine was also said to have been
cleared by Sir Richard.
It had been expected that he would receive little criticism, after
strongly resisting pressure to sign a PII certificate.
If the draft findings are confirmed in Sir Richard's final report, it
is likely to leave only Sir Nicholas and Treasury Chief Secretary
William Waldegrave of the present Government facing criticism.
That would come as a huge relief to John Major, who could have been
facing the prospect of enforced ministerial resignations.
Sir Richard was reported to be ''sympathetic'' to the dilemma faced by
Ministers when they were informed by their officials that it was their
duty in to claim PII for private Whitehall papers, according to BBC TV's
Nine O'Clock News.
Mr Heseltine, then Trade and Industry Secretary, Mr Clarke, then Home
Secretary, Mr Rifkind, then Defence Secretary, and Tristan Garel-Jones,
then Foreign Office Minister and now retired from Government, signed PII
certificates seeking to withhold thousands of Whitehall documents from
the three Matrix Churchill defendants.
They were cleared in November 1992 when the prosecution collapsed
after the trial judge refused to accept the certificates and ordered the
documents to be disclosed.
The BBC report made no mention of former Trade Secretary -- now Social
Security Secretary -- Peter Lilley and former Home Secretary Kenneth
Baker, who both signed PII certificates for the committal proceedings in
the Matrix Churchill case.
They also issued PII claims seeking to withhold evidence in the Ordtec
arms-to-Iraq case -- which ended on Tuesday with the acquittal of the
four defendants by the Court of Appeal.
Sir Nicholas, in his evidence to the Scott inquiry, argued that the
Ministers had an absolute duty in law to claim PII for official
documents regardless of whether they thought disclosure would be
damaging to the national interest.
However his position was badly undermined by Mr Heseltine, who told
the inquiry that he had not wanted to issue a PII certificate because he
believed the papers were essential for the Matrix Churchill defence.
It would now seem much of the criticism in Sir Richard's final report
-- expected early next year -- is going to be aimed at officials and at
ministers who are no longer in office.
Leaked extracts of his draft report have already criticised former
ministers Alan Clark and Lord Trefgarne, together with Mr Waldegrave,
for covertly relaxing guidelines on defence sales to Iraq.

TREASURY plans to cut more than #1bn from the welfare budget would
have a ''devastating'' impact on services and cause the Tories serious
political damage, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley has warned in a
letter obtained by the Labour Party.
Mr Lilley, who yesterday refused to comment on the leak, has appealed
to Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave to spare his #90bn
budget. The cuts, he said in the letter, fill him ''with despair'' and
would make the service ''more chaotic''.
The letter, written last month and released by Labour yesterday,
confirms the strains imposed on Government departments by the
Chancellor's determination to squeeze spending in order to fund tax
cuts.
Meanwhile, under proposals unveiled last night by Shadow Chancellor
Gordon Brown, Labour would require thousands of unemployed young people
to join new work and training schemes or face a drastic cut in benefits.
Mr Lilley, whose budget takes up the lion's share of Government
expenditure, told Mr Waldegrave in the letter: ''Your proposed
settlement on running costs fills me with despair. The impact on
operations will be devastating.''
He details Treasury proposals to force savings by cutting housing
benefit for under-25s and industrial injuries benefit, and in particular
expresses grave concern at the prospect of cuts to his department's
running costs.
''Quite apart from the political fall-out as service becomes more
chaotic, I am convinced -- for reasons I've explained -- that we would
be cutting off our noses to spite our faces,'' he said.
He goes on to warn of dire political consequences: the cuts would
require primary legislation which, with the Tories' ''shrinking
majority'', could prove ''too great a risk at this stage in the
Parliament''.
Refusing to comment on the letter, Mr Lilley said yesterday on BBC
Radio: ''You can make whatever assumptions you like and I will prove
them right or wrong in three weeks' time, when I announce what we are
doing in the next sector-by-sector stage of reform of social security.''
However, his Labour shadow, Mr Chris Smith, said the letter confirmed
the Government's ''lurch to the right''.
At a Westminster news conference, he said: ''If the proposed
administrative cutbacks at the department fill even Peter Lilley with
despair, then we are looking at a very right-wing extremist agenda.''
Negotiations between Mr Waldegrave and his Cabinet colleagues in this
year's public spending round were completed last week, with suggestions
that the Treasury has obtained the savings it wanted to meet the
Government's overall expenditure target and provide leeway for tax cuts
in the Chancellor's Budget on November 28.
In the letter, Mr Lilley complains that the Cabinet public expenditure
committee -- called EDX -- has rejected some of his advice for a ''least
worst'' scenario and imposed cuts which would require full-scale
legislation.
The Treasury's demands for cuts in housing and injuries benefits come
in addition to an agreed programme of savings, including a crackdown on
fraud, with #400m to go next year, rising to #1bn in three years.
The #5.20-a-week lone parent premium would be abolished for all new
claimants and frozen for existing ones. The one- parent benefit paid to
single mothers also would be frozen.
Mr Smith said: ''It is clear that he has given in to Treasury demands
which will mean that the battle against fraud will be substantially
weakened''
Ms Liz Lynne, Liberal Democrat Social Services spokesman, warned that
the cuts would increase homelessness. ''It won't be cost-effective for a
start, it will create a lot more homelessness.
Meanwhile, Mr Brown pledged that a Labour government would introduce
the ''welfare for work'' scheme for the under-25s in its first Budget as
part of a radical overhaul of the welfare state.
Mr Brown, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, said that a life
on permanent benefit would no longer be an option for out-of-work 18 to
25-year-olds.
However, he denied that Labour was simply trying to outdo the Tory
right by introducing its own version of a workfare scheme.
He said that Labour's proposals would put the responsibility firmly on
to young people to look for jobs and to improve their skills.
''They have a clear responsibility, in return for new opportunities
which we will provide, to choose from the opportunities for work that
are available and make the best efforts to develop the skills that are
necessary,'' he said.
''With our new opportunities, continuing for ever on benefit cannot
and will not be an option.''
Full details of Labour's ''New Deal'' for the under 25s will be
unveiled today at a joint news conference with Shadow Education and
Employment secretary David Blunkett.
Under the proposals, the 18 to 25s who have been jobless for longer
than six months will be given a month to accept a place on a scheme
involving private employers, the voluntary sector, a new environmental
or full-time education.
If they do not take one of the places on offer, they will lose 40% of
their income support payments.

DETAILED plans for a redevelopment of Ardrossan Harbour, aimed at
improving the environment and amenity of the Ayrshire town have been
lodged with the local council.
As disclosed in The Herald earlier this year, Clydeport wants to spend
#12.5m on a 310-berth marina, 190 flats, and a restaurant and bar
complex.
The proposals have been lodged with Cunninghame District Council and
outline planning permission has been sought.
Mr David Hunt, managing director of Clydeport, said: ''Although we are
at a preliminary stage, we believe these proposals will radically
improve both the appearance and amenity of the harbour area.''
Mr Hunt emphasised that passenger ferry services and the fishing fleet
would continue to operate as normal.

A SHERIFF yesterday ordered a couple to hand their grandson back to
their daughter after a court custody dispute, in which it was claimed
the young mother's home was the ''haunt of criminals and drug addicts''.
However, there is to be a ''time-share'' arrangement: the sheriff gave
interim custody to Ms Elaine Maxwell, 21, from 9am to 5pm each day. Then
she has to hand over her son Craig to her parents Richard, 52, and Helen
Maxwell, 51, who look after him at night.
Mr and Mrs Maxwell vowed: ''We will fight to get him back.''
At Falkirk Sheriff Court, the Maxwells asked for custody of
16-month-old Craig, whom they claimed they had looked after since he was
born.
Their daughter told the court her parents had snatched her son from
her home last month and asked the court to order them to hand him back.
Mr Steve Stirling, lawyer for Mr and Mrs Maxwell, of Redding, Falkirk,
admitted: ''The grandparents were invited to Elaine's house. They took
the child away. There was no force used.''
He said they were ''fearful for the safety'' of Craig and claimed
their daughter's home was a ''tip'' and the ''haunt of criminals and
drug addicts''.
Ms Karen Sherriff, lawyer for the daughter, said: ''My client has
never abused drugs or alcohol.''
She said Ms Elaine Maxwell had lived with her parents from the start
of her pregnancy and after Craig's birth on June 30, 1994. The lawyer
said she later formed a relationship with a Mr Roy McKie and they set up
home together in a council house nearby.
She took her son with her to their new home but just two days later,
on October 3, her parents took the child away, said the lawyer.
Sheriff Albert Sheehan said: ''At the moment, the mother is the sole
person who is entitled to custody of the child until it is decided that
some other person has that right.''
He added: ''It is important that the bond between natural mother and
child be maintained.''
The sheriff stressed it was vital the child's welfare came first. He
ordered an immediate investigation into the case by the Reporter to the
Children's Panel and warned: ''It may be that his report would mean that
the child does not go to either party.''
He added: ''The Reporter will investigate and if there is a danger to
the child he will take the child to a place of safety.''
The sheriff ordered the child time-sharing arrangement until the case
is decided at another hearing later this month.
After the hearing, the baby was back home with the mother for the
first time since his grandparents took him away last month.
Ms Maxwell said later: ''I'm delighted to hold my baby again. I went
to my parents' house around the corner and collected him this morning. I
just want him here with me all the time.
''I understand that my mum and dad dote on Craig. I appreciate how
they cared for me when I was pregnant and due to become an unmarried
mum. And I know what they did for Craig and me after the birth.
''But I'm his mother and I'm more than capable of looking after him.''
She added: ''I can't forget that night my parents came to my home.
Craig was lying sleeping. My dad just picked him up and took him away
from me. I was heartbroken.
''They would not give him back so I had to resort to legal action.
''It was a nightmare when Craig wasn't here.''
She went on: ''Now I've got him some of the time. But I will fight to
get him all of the time.
''I love and cherish the boy.''
Mr McKie, 21, said: ''I love the boy just as if he were my own. We
will both make sure he never comes to any harm.''
At the hearing, Mr Stirling said: ''She abuses alcohol and drugs. Her
paramour, Roy McKie, has four pages of previous criminal convictions. He
also abuses alcohol and drugs.
''The grandparents have never stopped Elaine from having access to the
child. There was an arrangement made through the social work department
and she only turned up once.''
The lawyer added: ''She doesn't want to take the child for his
welfare. She wants to say to her parents -- 'Ha! Ha! I've got him
back!'.''
Mr Stirling said the home was 'like a tip. There is neither a cooker
nor a cot''.
Mrs Sherriff replied: ''My client has never abused drugs or alcohol.
McKie would admit he has convictions but none since he has been residing
with my client, and none relating to children.''
Mr Richard Maxwell said at his home yesterday: ''We took the child
away from our daughter in an act of desperation.''
He added: ''We will do everything in our power to get Craig out of
that house and back with us.''
Mrs Maxwell said: ''Everything we have ever done has been in the best
interests of our grandson. We will go back to court to try to win
custody.
''We want him back so badly, to give him all the love in the world and
to keep him safe. He has been happy and safe with us.
''We just want his happiness and safety to continue, in our home.
''But we would be content if Craig were taken into care and away from
that house.''
The ''time-share'' arrangement will be reviewed by Sheriff Sheehan.

YOU can have a partridge in a pear tree this Christmas, or seven swans
a swimming, but six geese-a-laying might prove a little difficult, even
for Santa.
Because of the summer heatwave, the goose will be in short supply this
year, with some commercial breeders saying their flocks are down by as
much as 25%.
For centuries, the goose was the traditional Christmas bird in Britain
until it was eclipsed by the turkey in the post-war years.
However, in recent years, it has been enjoying a strong revival among
consumers, until the heatwave intervened to knock the stuffing out of
the old saying of what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
Mr John Adlard, chairman of the British Goose Producers' Association,
said: ''The poor old ganders were so hot they just didn't want to
perform. Like the birds and the bees, they mate only in spring time.
''The ganders would tell the goose, 'It's too hot -- come back
tomorrow' but the hot weather went on for about six weeks solid. There
was nothing we could do.
''If they don't want to do it they won't do it, so we ended up with
more infertile eggs.''
He added that ''there wasn't much grass about, which they like to eat
a lot of, and that meant a lot of the geese just weren't laying. That
means we've been left with fewer eggs and fewer that are fertile.''
Mr Adlard said his farm had planned to produce about 120,000 goslings
to supply Christmas goose producers but had ended up with just over
80,000.
''There are about 90 breeders in the association and many of them are
reporting a similar downturn.''
The result will be fewer birds and consequently a higher price for the
Christmas table next month.
You could plump for three French hens, or, if you have a particularly
big party to feed, 10 lords-a-leaping.

THE Conservative Party's director of communications, Mr Hugh Colver,
resigned yesterday after only six months in the job. A Labour spokesman
said he had ''suffered from the fact that it is now almost impossible to
sell the Tories to the wider world''.
The resignation is another blow to Tory morale, as Mr Colver said he
had decided that his talents were not suitable for handling the run-up
to the next General Election, although that was the job he was
originally hired to do.
Mr Colver, 50, was previously chief public relations officer at the
Ministry of Defence and was well known in Scotland, where he served as
the MoD press officer at Faslane submarine base. He had also been acting
director of communications for British Aerospace.
Tory party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney said he had tried
unsuccessfully to persaude Mr Colver to stay and disagreed with him that
he was not the man for the job.
Mr Colver's departure partly reflects a battle for control of Tory
policy presentation between Dr Mawhinney and Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine. As director, he was caught in the middle, although he
appeared out of sympathy with Dr Mawhinney's hard- nosed approach to
political issues and there were rumours of disagreements between them at
October's party conference.
At Westminster, Mr Colver found himself in a role with which several
journalists thought he was uncomfortable. As journalists emerged from
the press gallery from watching the twice-weekly confrontations between
Mr Major and Mr Blair, Labour's spin doctors Alastair Campbell and David
Hill provided instant interpretation, as did Mr Colver's predecessor Tim
Collins, who will take over temporarily again until a successor is
found.
Mr Colver seemed less happy with providing ''spin'' and, given current
tensions over presentation, he may have preferred to jump before he was
pushed, although he told Dr Mawhinney that, on his appointment, he had
decided to consider his position at the end of six months.
Mr Campbell, quick to put a Labour spin on another Tory discomfiture,
said: ''The real question is who is in charge of the Tory campaign --
Heseltine or Mawhinney?''
Dr Mawhinney, who became chairman in July, announced a major shakeup
at Conservative Central Office designed to boost the press relations
team. Three journalists are recruited -- Ms Sheila Gunn, the Times
political diarist, to liaise with lobby journalists; Mr Paul Hooper, who
was with the Sun for eleven years, and Ms Ceri Evans, a producer on BBC
Network Television becomes chief broadcasting officer.
Mr Alex Aitken, a press officer, becomes chief press officer while the
head of news, Ms Vanessa Ford, another successful member of the last
election campaign team, becomes head of Dr Mawhinney's office.

James Traynor warns of danger in satellite and cable TV's ever-growing
influence on major sport -- and urges a switch-off before it's too late.
REPORTS that BSkyB were close to completing a deal which would give
the satellite television company the right to broadcast the Five Nations
Championship were being denied yesterday. The fact is, however, no
popular sport and therefore the people who watch these sports, are safe
from the threat from above. Money talks louder than any voice of reason
in sport and, when it comes to finance, no-one can compete with BSkyB.
Both the BBC and ITV find it difficult to compete with the money
offered by their rivals and increasingly are finding themselves to be
little more than bit-part players. Soon, they may even be no more than
viewers themselves.
The Financial Times reported yesterday that BSkyB were close to
clinching a deal, but Bob Weighill, honorary secretary of the Five
Nations Championship committee, later stated that he had no knowledge of
any deal and added that he was ''astonished'' by the reports.
However, Weighill should be prepared to be surprised again. BSkyB have
never attempted to disguise their desire to buy up major sport and
sooner rather than later rugby union will have to decide whether or not
they wish to take the #100m -- the sum mentioned for a five-year deal --
in these times when their sport is entering the realm of
professionalism.
Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation
who control BSkyB, has a portfolio which includes a number of
prestigious events. Indeed, the organisation already has a 10-year
agreement to cover an annual rugby union tournament involving South
Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, and they have created their own
international super league for rugby league clubs.
Only by subscribing to the satellite company or cable television can
viewers now see Premiership matches, the major boxing contests, and the
Ryder Cup, and it would be comforting if rugby union had the nerve and
the vision to resist an offer to fall into line and consequently under
the control of programme schedulers.
Someone at some point has to stand up and say: ''Enough. We have a
responsibility to the people and we are not for sale.''
Football, certainly south of the Border, failed to do so and were won
over completely when they heard the rustle of bank notes. More than 100
English matches are shown live annually and, no matter what anyone says,
that cannot be good for a sport which struggles to persuade enough
youngsters to play.
The FA send out agents to entice children into coaching schemes while
at the same time the deal with BSkyB encourages those same kids to sit
at home wide-eyed in front of the television. It makes no long-term
sense and even the financial benefits will not make up for the damage
which could be caused.
Television people insist it is not their goal to empty football
grounds, but that is a contradiction because the aim of any such company
surely is to keep people at home. Viewers now mean subscribers and the
greater the number of those the higher will be the advertising rates.
The wellbeing of sport is not uppermost in the minds of television
executives, who basically want people to tune in to their programmes and
whatever has to be done will be done to make certain more do exactly
that.
That is why football matches now kick off at peculiar times and are
moved to non-traditional days. The needs and habits of supporters, who
really are the lifeblood of the game regardless of how old-fashioned and
cliched that may sound, are of little or no consequence.
There is a real and powerful danger that a company like BSkyB could
finish up owning the rights to show every popular sporting event -- not
even Wimbledon will be safe when their contract with the BBC expires in
a few years time -- and what or who could then prevent that company from
increasing the rates to join their nation of TV watchers?
It is not every sports fan who is able, or who can afford, to attend
events and there is a fundamental wrong in denying these people the
opportunity to watch on terrestrial television. Basic though the belief
may be, sport belongs to the people, all of the people, and not just
those who have dishes stuck to the sides of their homes or cables
running under their garden paths.
BSkyB, who appear to have limitless funding, are difficult to resist
when they decide to go for a particular sport or event, although
Scottish football has not sold out quite to the extent of their English
counterparts who now find themselves quarrelling over a new television
deal. The FA are trying to broker a deal worth #117m over five years and
are pressing the Football League clubs to accept while the elite, the
Premiership clubs, make a counter proposal.
It is a new world, but not necessarily a brave one although the SFA at
least have been trying to hold live television at bay. They are into a
three-year deal worth #10.5m, but the paucity of this fee should be
measured against the association's determination to restrict the number
of live matches shown.
They allow only 16 per season and are not entirely convinced that
BSkyB's money, or any other television company's for that matter, is
worth it. They are conscious of the dangers inherent in selling too many
matches, but one has to wonder whether if the Scottish product had as
much appeal as the English game the authorities would be able to resist
more than #100m.
Also, once BSkyB's millions are accepted sport very quickly becomes
dependent on that income and the satellite company's influence over
sport grows stronger. So far as I can see, it is happening all too
quickly and any sinister aspects are not being considered properly.
Major sport, while it still has some kind of say in its own future,
should switch off before it is too late.
There should have been a national debate by now, yet the only time MPs
have shown any concern about the increasing power of satellite
television was when it was suggested Coronation Street might be bought
up. MPs were outraged yet they were unconcerned that the Ryder Cup was
sold off.
You now, when you think of it all in those terms perhaps it is already
too late.

Anne Johnstone examines the implications of further reductions in
benefit payments.
HOW much can you cut from a benefit cheque of #78 for a mother and
child before people starve or freeze? Margaret Proudfoot isn't likely to
bump into Peter Lilley, but if she did that's the question the
23-year-old Glasgow lone parent would put to the Social Security
Secretary.
Yesterday's claim by the Labour Party that the Government plans to cut
a further #1000m a year from the social security budget to finance tax
cuts did nothing for her fragile nerves. The claim is based on a leaked
letter from Mr Lilley to Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave,
which suggests several benefits are in the firing line. They include two
payments made to single parents and housing benefit for the under-25s as
well as cuts in industrial injuries benefit.
What would be the implications of such cuts for someone in Margaret
Proudfoot's position? Margaret is 23. She shares her two-apartment
council flat in Millerston with two-year-old Declan.
Her weekly income is #77.90 a week out of which she has to pay nearly
#10 towards housing costs, plus fuel and a small debt to a catalogue
company for children's clothes. She also receives housing benefit. She's
currently undertaking a course in budgeting organised by the charity One
Plus but it's hard to see how she could make her meagre income go any
further.
''I'm already at rock bottom. I've nothing left to cut. I don't drink,
smoke, or go out. I buy food from the cheapest shops and we eat loads of
pasta. If they cut my money I can't think what I'd do. I'd have to get
Declan's clothes in charity shops.
''I'd love to go back to my job as a telephonist but can't afford the
childcare. If one-parent benefit is frozen, it would make it even harder
for people like me to get back to work. I don't understand this
Government. They're not going to stop couples breaking up by attacking
lone parents.''
Such cuts would have massive implications for the Scottish economy.
Each year around 20,000 Scots collect over #30m in industrial injuries
disablement benefit; 149,000 lone parents receive nearly #49m in
one-parent benefit (payable to all single parents); in addition around
94,000 single parents on income support qualify for a total of #25.5m in
lone-parent premiums. The total comes to around #105m a year.
If the leaks are correct, Mr Lilley has already agreed to abolish the
lone-parent premium for new claimants and freeze it at #5.20 for the
rest; one-parent benefit, currently worth #6.30, would also be frozen;
and it is thought that cuts of up to 75% are in line for industrial
injuries benefit, worth an average of #29 a week in Scotland. So that
#105m certainly wouldn't disappear immediately but would be slowly
eroded over time.
Calculations about housing benefit are more complicated because the
Government doesn't release separate figures for the under-25s but in
round terms we could be talking about another #100m a year in Scotland.
In total around 553,000 Scots receive an average of nearly #26 a week,
so the annual expenditure on housing benefit for all age groups is about
#742m.
Cutting the social security budget sounds easy when Government
ministers are raising cheers at the Tory Party conference. Achieving it,
without causing a massive backlash, isn't so easy.
For example, Conservative social-policy thinker David Willetts has
advocated abolishing any special status for single parents. Single
mothers would have to register as unemployed when their child reached
five. However, this would add a million to the unemployment figures.
One-parent benefit currently costs the taxpayer #312m a year and is
payable to all lone parents, regardless of income. Its prime purpose is
to act as a ladder to help single parents climb out of dependency back
into work. Paul Johnson, of the independent Institute for Fiscal
Studies, says tinkering with this benefit would ''barking mad''. He
claims it would damage work incentives and ''fly in the face of
everything the Conservatives have said before''.
Welfare experts have claimed that much of the supposed saving would be
lost in increased income support payments to parents who decided to stay
at home.
The abolition of lone-parent premium would increase the poverty of
some of the poorest and most vulnerable families. Scotland has 132,000
lone parents. About 40% live on less than #100 a week, compared with
just 2% of two-parent families.
''If other sections of the community were vilified in this way there
would be an outcry. At the end of the day the proposed measures are an
attack on the welfare of children,'' said John Findlay, director of One
Plus.
Industrial injuries disablement benefit has been targeted for cuts for
some time. This is the benefit paid to top up the wages of those whose
earning capacity has been cut by an injury at work.
The Adam Smith Institute has proposed that it should become the
liability of employers, with the state gradually withdrawing. Employers
could receive rebates on National Insurance contributions in return.
David Willetts argues that forcing firms to insure to pay such benefits
would encourage employers to improve workplace safety.
But in the short term such a scheme could cost the Government more
rather than less because of the need to honour existing commitments at
the same time as paying national insurance rebates or other incentives
to employers.
Housing benefit has been targeted already for extensive pruning by
cutting back on the categories eligible for help with housing costs.
Between 1988 and last year the housing-benefit bill doubled, largely
because of the Government's decision in 1987 to switch housing subsidy
from bricks and mortar to individuals, while introducing market rents.
The move achieved the objective of stimulating the private-rented sector
but resulted in rocketing social housing rents with knock-on effects on
the housing benefit budget.
Now attention appears to be focused on claimants under 25. In future
they could be pressured to live in bedsits or hostels, rather than
self-contained flats, by restricting housing benefit payments to the
cost of shared accommodation. According to the leaked letter, this could
produce savings of #65m a year by 1999.
Ceridwen Roberts, director of the Family Policy Studies Centre, said
yesterday she was very concerned about the effect of such a change on a
young person's ability to leave home and form a family. ''The proposal
assumes all under-25s can meet their own housing costs or rely on their
parents. Both assumptions are dubious. I'm afraid this would lead to an
increase in homelessness,'' she said.
As Lilley recognises in his letter, unpopular social security reforms
might be difficult to push through the Commons, given the Government's
shrinking majority. It won't stop him trying. Yesterday, he described
his priorities as to focus the budget on those most in need and make
sure that the total did not outstrip the nation's ability to pay.
Margaret Proudfoot sees it another way: ''They're trying to make the
rich richer and forget about the folk on the bottom line.''

IN the vicinity of Barrowland last night touts were asking #25 for
tickets for the first of Weller's two sold-out nights at the venue, a
remarkable turnaround considering his low currency a mere six years ago
when such dealers were unheard of at Style Council concerts.
It didn't take long to discover why a Weller ticket is now a hot item.
From the opening Changing Man it was obvious that he has rediscovered
his fire for live performance, and that rather than trying to do
ambitious things badly he now chooses to do the basics well.
The band are as tight a live outfit as you are likely to find, the
singer's voice considerably stronger and more soulful than during his
white soul phase of 1986.
The outcome is that he has a new audience.
As the proficiency and perspiration triumphed over inspired moments
during the proceedings, it seems fair to conclude that most people are
celebrating the fact that Weller's solo material is solid rather than
spectacular.
However, there were several high points, in particular singles like
Hung Up, Into Tomorrow, and Sunflower have all grown in stature with
repeated performance, making the more routine material from Stanley Road
pale by comparison.
The five-song acoustic interlude invited the ''Clapton for his
generation'' claims, but with songs as good as Man of Great Promise and
Foot of the Mountain, this differed from the blatant career resurrection
tactics of his elders.
Weller is currently performing at a career peak, and that his
song-writing no longer scales such heights on a regular basis is almost
forgivable. For his very reliability, tonight's touts can expect another
good evening.

Jennifer Cunningham looks at proposals designed to create a more
peaceful society.
TWO years ago, in the shock waves which followed the murder of James
Bulger and the subsequent conviction of two 10-year-olds, there was near
panic over an apparent increase in the level of violence by children.
Today a call for a sea-change in culture to promote actively
non-violence throughout the country by everyone, from government
departments to voluntary organisations, is made by the Commission on
Children and Violence, set up by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation in
the wake of that appalling murder.
Chaired by Sir William Utting, former chief inspector of social
services in England and Wales, the 17-member commission has produced a
raft of recommendations. They include increasing the tax on alcohol, a
more rigorous application of the 9pm watershed on television, a ban on
boxing, more leave for both mothers and fathers of young children, and a
tighter firearms law.
Two aspects of their widespread deliberations, the effects of screen
violence and the age of criminal responsibility, take on particular
significance considering the age of the boys convicted of the murder of
James Bulger and the references during the trial to scenes from a
violent video.
The commission discussed violent images at great length, according to
its sole Scottish member, Kathleen Marshall, a former director of the
Scottish Child Law Centre, now Gulbenkian Fellow in Children's Rights at
Glasgow University's Centre for the Study of the Child and Society.
''There are two separate strands in relation to violent images. One
was the concern that exposure to these does nothing positive for
children and the other was to what extent it was responsible for violent
behaviour. The research shows that children who already have firmly
established values and who see such images with an accompanying critique
from an adult, are unlikely to copy the violence they have seen,'' she
says.
The commission says neither the quantity nor quality of children's
television is sufficiently monitored or regulated, and calls for a
Children's Television Council to be established, in which children
should participate.
They call for the 9pm watershed on television to be rigorously
observed on all channels and all videos and discs to be packaged in a
way which ensures that basic information about classification and
violent content is clear and accessible and printed on the video and
disc as well as the package.
More ambitiously, they want everyone involved in media which is
accessible to children to recognise the potential for ''non-violent
conflict resolution and discouraging inter-personal violence''. They
suggest that soaps could develop a pro-social role and challenge macho
images.
The age of criminal responsibility, currently eight in Scotland and 10
in the rest of the UK, is now out of line with many other countries.
Those where it has recently been raised include Canada (from seven to
12), Israel (nine to 13), Norway (14 to 15), Cuba (12 to 16), and
Romania (14 to 18). The UN committee on the rights of the child has
already suggested that 12 is too low and the commission recommends that
it should be increased to a minimum of 14 throughout the UK.
The commission concludes: ''Children who act violently, like those who
act violently to children, are immediately responsible for their actions
. . . But the general acceptance of the concept of individual
responsibility for violence does not mean that juvenile offenders should
be tried as adults. The process must be one they can understand and
respect. Nor does it mean that once regarded as responsible, young
people should face retribution. It is for these reasons that the
commission proposes raising the age of criminal responsibility.''
Most people, however, will be more affected by the community safety
strategy the commission wants to see, involving everyone from the
Cabinet to schoolchildren, bringing together the collective wisdom of
scattered crime prevention, child protection panels, family support
centres and society at large.
The rejection of all inter-personal violence would mean an end to the
physical punishment of children. The commission calls for an end to the
defence of reasonable chastisement in both criminal and civil
proceedings, a measure which recently failed to be included in the
Children Scotland Act.
Support for the commission's call for a culture of non-violence came
from Niall Coggans, senior lecturer in pharmaceutical sciences at
Strathclyde University. In a new study on alcohol and aggression in
young people, he also says that rather than blame alcohol for violence,
society should be addressing ways in which violence can be minimised or
halted. ''If young people grow up in an atmosphere where aggressive
behaviour is the norm, it usually means that if intoxicated with
alcohol, they are more likely to express that aggression.''

HEARD in a context of music by Henze, Hindemith, Lutoslawski, and
Sculthorpe, Bach's solo cello suites can sound startlingly modern.
Perhaps to emphasise this, Lowri Blake yesterday played the baroque
items in her skilfully devised recital between the modern ones, thereby
demonstrating that Bach was the more demanding to play and the more
challenging to interpret.
Replacing at short notice an indisposed William Conway, this talented
young cellist (whose teachers have included Jacqueline Du Pre) made much
of these striking juxtapositions. If Bach's C major suite contained the
odd rasp, squeak, or other small mishap, it also received a finely
judged and flexibly phrased performance, relishing the rich sonorities
of the sarabande and the grinding rhythms of the final gigue.
In comparison, Henze's spidery Serenade sounded like Bach reduced to a
sort of modern musical shorthand, each movement a microscopic dance
filled with the tiniest rustles and gestures. Like Lutoslawski's equally
laconic Sacher Variation -- a poised little tribute to the Swiss
conductor Paul Sacher -- it was articulated with a sharpness that caught
every fragile detail and every delicate change of colour.
Peter Sculthorpe's Threnody, a compressed memorial to a musical
friend, offered similar small refinements, its changing moods perfectly
controlled. Three more bits of Bach, and three movements from
Hindemith's chunky and firmly wrought cello sonata, Op 25 No 3 were
likewise presented with impressive definition.

SOMETIMES an unexpected performance can shine like a good deed in a
naughty world. I had hurried along to the Assembly Alive! season
expecting to see some sort of collaborative project between Scottish and
Romanian dancemakers and musicians. I was, I promise you, keen. But
instead I found the slot given over to an entire programme by Contemp
Dance Company -- a facet of the Jewish State Theatre of Romania, formed
after the revolution in 1990, that filled me with piquant memories of
other days when contemporary dance was still young in this land and
costumes were an imaginative realm beyond the daily dullard stretch of
the unitard.
Ah me . . . It was just so hard to keep from smiling and nodding in
happy recognition as piece by piece this able and attractive young group
explored some of the familiar, fundamental approaches and developments
within modern dance -- albeit adding in their own energies, their own
humour and experiences. It's hard to escape thoughts of political
isolation, of constraint and the urge for freedom when the dance is
offering images of wracked solitude.
Costuming really mattered in this performance, not least in the final
work, Life as a Journey, where four tempestuous women pursued the same
elusive black, flouncy frock -- retained in the controlling grasp of the
lone man -- through a series of feisty, visceral flamenco-esque dances
that would have had Cristina Hoyos arching her back in hot envy.
Founder/choreographer Adina Cezar and her dancers seem so delighted to
be free to move as the mood takes them that no subject, no sound score,
no ambitious costume would surprise me if I were lucky enough to catch
sight of them again.

BONN: The final decision on extraditing former Barings Bank trader
Nicholas Leeson to Singapore is in the hands of the German Foreign
Ministry and a decision is expected by the end of next week, a
prosecutor said yesterday. Leeson, 28, was arrested in March at
Frankfurt airport as he tried to fly home to Britain from Singapore,
where he was Barings' general manager of futures trading. The bank
collapsed on February 27 after Leeson lost #880m in failed speculations.

David Ross senses a new mood in the Highlands as crofters meet in the
wake of Michael Forsyth's offer to transfer control to local trusts.
THE Scottish Crofters Union 10th annual conference and general
meeting, which opens this afternoon at Newtonmore, looks certain to be
the most important yet, given the Secretary of State's unexpected and
rather hurried entry into the debate over land reform, and the news
today that he has been persuaded to give the people of Laggan their
forest.
The news from Laggan, Mr Forsyth's offer to transfer control of the
1400 Scottish Office owned crofts to local crofting trusts, and his call
for private landowners to follow his example, are already exciting
Highland opinion.
They will also focus attention at a conference which, despite being
the direct descendant of the nineteenth-century Highland Land League
gatherings, has in the past attracted an unexpected breadth of speakers:
from the Prince of Wales to Lord Sanderson of Bowden.
It was the latter, as a Scottish Office minister, who addressed the
1989 SCU conference in Benbecula, claiming common cause with the
crofters: ''For what it's worth the only far-reaching land reforms in
the Highlands this century, the land acquisition and land settlement
measures of the 1920s, were the work of a Conservative or
Conservative-dominated administration. I stress that the principles of
my party and Government, are also, I believe, the aspirations and wishes
of the crofting community.''
He then further took everybody's breath away by announcing that the
Government was considering doing what Mr Forsyth is now proposing,
handing over the crofting estates owned by the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries to community trusts.
Subsequently the Government confirmed this and also that it would
launch a pilot project on the largest DAFS estate, Skye, and Raasay.
There was heated debate as considerable local opposition to the scheme
emerged, largely because DAFS had been a good and enlightened landlord.
With the official confirmation that the status quo was an option, the
plan foundered.
What the rest of Scotland, who for the previous 30 years had been
encouraged to see the Highland crofters as a land-hungry people
desperate to get out from under the heel of their landlords and take
control of their own destiny, thought of this is not clear.
Again this time Mr Forsyth has made it clear that nobody will be
forced to take over from the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department (SOAFD). So will anything be different, apart from the
cosmetic change in the department's name?
It is beginning to look likely. There is a different atmosphere now in
the Highlands. We have had Assynt, where the crofters snatched their
lands back from the market that had let them down so badly in the past,
and all with the clear support of the people of Scotland. Where once
there was decay, forestry schemes and hydro power are the talk in Assynt
now.
We have had Borve and Annishader, where the crofters quietly
negotiated their land for a more realistic price. We have the 60
crofters at Melness almost certainly joining them courtesy of their
Nottinghamshire-based absentee landlord, and there is always talk of
others.
But we have also had the island of Harris almost tear itself apart
over Lingerbay and the few crumbs that may be tossed from the corporate
table, and all in the knowledge that had the islanders accepted Lord
Leverhulme's offer of the land in South Harris in the 1920s it is they
who would be at the multi-million pound feast.
Many Highland people are viewing things a bit differently now, and
Laggan can only reinforce that. The shift in opinion will be confirmed
this afternoon when the results of a survey of 400 SCU members are
presented to the Newtonmore conference. More than half of those polled
now support the ideas of community control and ownership of their land,
which represents a significant change in opinion since Lord Sanderson's
days.
Without pre-empting the survey results, SCU acting-president Alistair
MacIver explains why there has been a mixed response to Mr Forsyth's
announcement within the crofting community. ''There is some caution but
also a welcome for any move towards giving communities more control.
SOAFD are good landlords, but there are good private landlords as well
as bad ones. Even the good landlords tend to let things just drift
along, but if the communities have control it gives them far greater
opportunities for development, and every opportunity means investment
within the communities.''
But for the crofters to have a genuine chance of developing and
investing in their communities, Mr Forsyth's offer, and anybody else's,
must include mineral and sporting rights. That is what they have in
Assynt.
The White Paper promised for the New Year is eagerly awaited to see
how far Mr Forsyth is willing to go. Will he surprise? Probably, for a
Tory Secretary of State who exhorts private landlords to follow his
example and give over some of their land, thereby implicitly criticising
their stewardship of it, is a politician in a great hurry.

Bill Mooney, RUC detective; born October 22, 1929, died November 3,
1995.
THE Northern Ireland detective who brought the notorious Shankill
''butchers'' to justice has died. The former Royal Ulster Constabulary
chief superintendent Bill Mooney was responsible for leading some of the
biggest murder hunts in British police history.
He headed the Regional Crime Squad which had major successes in
catching and putting behind bars large numbers of Republican and
Loyalist terrorists during the mid-seventies.
As the province's top detective he solved the murders of two Fermanagh
farmers by soldiers from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1972.
One of his achievements was to solve, after a 12-year investigation,
the disappearance of the German industrialist and honorary German consul
to Northern Ireland, Thomas Niedermayer, who was kidnapped by the
Provisional IRA in 1973. Mooney eventually discovered that the German
had died of a heart attack before his captors had time to demand a
ransom. Other famous cases he was involved in included the firebomb
attack on La Mon house.
Mr Mooney was the first head of the RUC's ''A'' Squad, set up more
than 20 years ago by the then Chief Constable, Sir Kenneth Newman, to
deal exclusively with anti-terrorist crime. He later became head of
crime operations in the province.
Mr Mooney, who originally trained as a shipwright, was 66 and lived in
Belfast. He was awarded the MBE in 1977 and retired in June 1983, after
recovering from a serious car accident the previous year. He had two
sons and four daughters by his first marriage. His first wife
predeceased him and he is survived by his second.

Michael Strathern, nationalist and crofter; born September 26, 1919,
died October 28, 1995.
An appreciation by JOHN MACLEOD
MICHAEL Strathern looked like a caricature of hielandism and, at first
glance, you could dismiss him as an ageing crank. With magnificent
beard, Balmoral bonnet, and slow teasing brogue, he could have adorned
the set of some Jacobite epic. In truth, Strathern was a highly gifted
man. Literate, articulate, an ardent nationalist, his passing has left a
hole in more hearts than he might have supposed.
Born in Glasgow in 1919, the son of a United Free minister, Strathern
spent his childhood in Gourock, then Dundee, before following a career
at sea. It was after war service, in India, that he was inflamed with
two abiding passions -- nationalism and pacificism. His heart thrilled
to the liberation of India from the British Empire. But he was sickened
by the atrocities he witnessed in the wild weeks about partition. Men
like Gandhi, who advocated non-violent protest, impressed him greatly.
Strathern joined the Scottish National Party long before it was
fashionable, where senior figures still remember him with affection. At
meetings of the national council he acted rather as the party's
conscience, rising to speak on any matter that troubled his keen sense
of ethics. He was also something of an authority on crofting matters;
but he was, like most of that SNP generation, a man who beat a hardcore
independence drum, with no time for the sops of devolution.
In the fifties Michael Stathern quit the Merchant Navy, worked in
poultry-farming for a while, then sought a west coast patch for himself
-- ''I wanted to grow my own potatoes! -- finally acquiring the
delightful Elderberry smallholding in Benderloch, Argyllshire. And he
married Lorna McLachlan, whose death in January of this year was a blow
from which he did not recover.
In the seventies, as nationalism boomed, Strathern served briefly as
an SNP local councillor. But it was in the eighties that he achieved new
prominence -- and ended up furth of the SNP. He became active in Siol
nan Gaidheal, a rather wild grouping of SNP enthusiasts formed in the
wake of the 1979 disaster. And he played a major role in their
victorious campaign to stop nuclear dumping in the Glen Etive hills.
But, in 1982, SNG -- and all other fringe groupings -- were proscribed
by the party. Those who refused to abandon them were expelled, and
Strathern was one of the casualties. SNG was later revived, and
Strathern served as honorary president, in the hope that the
organisation would now be cultural rather than extremist. It seems not
to have lived up to his standards; in any event, it fell apart, and he
repudiated it before he died.
Michael Strathern was latterly best known for his ceaseless endeavours
to get to the bottom of the strange death of Willie McRae, the senior
nationalist who was found shot and dying in his car in April 1985.
Strathern knew McRae well -- they appear to have met in India -- and
pressed tirelessly for answers.
He could never accept any possibility of suicide. Convinced that McRae
had been murdered by some arm of the secret state, he persuaded Winnie
Ewing to take up the cause. Strathern even founded the ''Willie McRae
Society'', with its Justice Blinded logo, and was quick to help any
journalist probing the mystery.
''He was a prophetic figure,'' former SNP leader Billy Wolfe recalled
yesterday, ''with booming voice, biblical beard . . . a man quick to
apply Christian standards to any matter before the Scottish National
Party. A great patriot.''
But Michael Strathern was also great company: wise, erudite, and very,
very funny. I met him only once, on a lovely August day at Elderberry. I
left feeling I had met one of life's rare and great originals.
His house boasted a mighty flagpole, on which he hoisted the Saltire
as often as possible. He also gleefully showed me, on parting, a mighty
chunk of red cast iron, lying on his ground. It was a piece of the
infamous Gilmerton pillar-box, blown up by nationalists 40 years ago for
its hated E II R cipher. The Royal Mail never used the offensive marque
in Scotland again. With men like Michael Strathern about, they wouldn't
dare.
Michael Strathern is survived by his son Lachlan.

Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel; born Jerusalem, March 1,
1922, died Tel Aviv, November 4, 1995.
An appreciation by YORAM LEVY
I WAS having dinner with my wife and children. The television set in
the corner provided a mumbling background to family talk. Suddenly
something the newscaster said filtered through the chatter.
''Rabin has been shot,'' I shouted.
I ran to the short-wave radio, my vital link with home. I needed to
hear every word of the terrible news in my native Hebrew.
Moments later -- it seemed an eternity -- I heard the tragic
announcement: Prime Minister Rabin is dead . . . Even as a hardened
journalist who has witnessed many tragedies in Israel I could not keep
back the tears.
Nearly a week has gone by and I still cannot believe what has
happened. On that fateful Saturday evening I desperately wanted to be in
Israel with my friends and newspaper colleagues to share to the full the
emotions of the disaster in my country's turbulent history. The most I
could do was telephone round all our Israeli friends in Scotland to find
the support we so desperately needed.
I have been seconded to Scotland for a couple of years to live among
the Jewish community and help in educational work. So my next instinct
was to make quick calls to the local leaders to discuss the effects. It
was quickly evident there was a palpable upsurge of feeling for my
country in its hour of trauma. There was some comfort in the fact that
the whole world appeared to share our shock.
I was 12 years old when the Six-Day War of 1967 broke out. The most
popular song then was ''Nasser is waiting for Rabin''. This had been
clearly composed to lighten public morale and we children all knew it by
heart. The war made Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin a national hero. Years
went by and Rabin became the first Sabra (Israeli-born) Prime Minister
and the first to speak Hebrew without a foreign accent, in fact one of
us.
Unlike other politicans in Israel, Rabin insisted on a sharp
distinction between his public role and his private life. To the
outsider he displayed no emotion. Very reserved, his bass voice and
monotonous mode of speech did not reveal his thoughts or feelings. He
rarely laughed, smoked far too many cigarettes and did not refuse a
drink when offered.
To keep fit he played tennis with his wife and his few close friends.
''Leah usually plays against me so that we don't fight,'' he said. He
was in fact a strong family man. In the last talk show in which he
appeared, Rabin was asked whether he took any time off. ''As Prime
Minister, no,'' he said bluntly.
From the day he became Premier for the second time, three years ago,
he devoted his energies to the peace process, sacrificing first his
military career and ultimately and sadly, his life. The toughest
decisions, his aides admitted, were by himself alone. In the same
interview he admitted there were no friends with whom he could speak
intimately.
Using the authority of his army experience, he attempted doggedly to
convince public opinion in Israel that the only road to permanent peace
in the Middle East led through compromise. ''We do not withdraw. We give
up for the sake of peace,'' he said.
The opposition escalated attacks on his political course in the
crudest terms: ''Rabin is a traitor,'' screamed hundreds of right-wing
extremists after every terrorist bomb. They did not desist from
slandering the man who devoted half his life to the Israel Defence
Force. But Rabin swallowed the insults. The writing was on the wall for
an evil outcome but unhappily the silent majority -- and even his own
government -- chose to ignore it.
Like a Greek tragedy, only his murder brought the Israeli public to
coming closer to accepting his vision. Only then more than 1,000,000 --
a fifth of the population of the entire state -- went up to Jerusalem in
the course of 36 hours to pay tribute to their late leader. I cannot
recall any scenes of mourning which even approached what I have seen and
heard since last Saturday.
Israelis like myself cannot grasp how a Jewish law student could come
to kill his own Prime Minister in cold blood, apparently only because he
could not agree with Rabin's peace equation.
I believe that the two shots which killed Yitzhak Rabin in Tel Aviv at
last woke that silent majority who claimed to believe in peace as the
only course for the future of Israel.

RETAILING
EDINBURGH-based Scottish Midland Co-operative Society (Scotmid)
boosted interim food retailing turnover by 12% to #65m, in spite of
intense competition in the sector, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Set against the backdrop of last week's news from supermarket group J
Sainsbury and deep-discounter Kwik Save of drops in their like-for-like
sales, Scotmid appears to be bearing up well.
In the 32 weeks to September 9, Scotmid had the same number of food
stores as in the corresponding period of its previous financial year.
Therefore, even after food price inflation is taken into account,
like-for-like volume sales were convincingly ahead.
Commercial services manager Hollis Smallman attributed Scotmid's
success to its ongoing store refurbishment programme, which is radically
changing the look of its stores across Central Scotland.
Total interim turnover at Scotmid, which also has draperies, a travel
agency operation, and a funeral business, was up 17% at #90m. The
co-operative society's trading surplus was up 40% at #1.77m.
Semi Chem, an Ayrshire-based family business which was acquired by
Scotmid in May, contributed more than #4m to Scotmid's turnover and
#255,000 to its trading surplus. Since the acquisition of the toiletries
retailer, Scotmid has added another three outlets to the 24 which it
took over.
Scotmid, which has 53 food stores across Central Scotland, is moving
northwards with the opening of a new superstore in Dundee. Eleven of the
53 outlets it operates at present are superstore size.
The group employs more than 2500 people.

INVESTMENT TRUST
SARACEN Value Trust, launched last year by former Scottish Amicable
fund managers, convincingly out-performed its benchmark index in the six
months to end-September, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Its net asset value leapt 21.5% to 106.7p during the first half,
outstripping a 15.3% advance in the FTSE Small Cap index (excluding
investment trusts).
Saracen is managed by Glasgow-based SFM Investment Managers, which was
set up by former Scottish Amicable Investment Managers (SAIM) director
Jim Fisher and another ex-ScotAm employee, David Campbell.
They have since been joined by Ernie McKnight, another former director
of SAIM, and fund manager Steven Barton, who also worked for Scottish
Amicable at one stage.
Mr Fisher believes the outlook for smaller companies is good, with
some of the benefits of cost-cutting still to feed through.
He also expects speedy growth in dividends from smaller companies
which have built up cash piles but are unable to justify major capital
expenditure on the basis of the projected return.
During the six months to end-September, Saracen's portfolio benefited
from the general strength of the UK stock market and a particularly
strong showing by smaller companies.
Saracen's #29.5m 'C' share issue, the proceeds of which were quickly
invested after they were received at the end of July, was well-timed.
The fund, which invests in UK quoted companies with market
capitalisations of between #40m and #300m, now has shareholders' funds
of more than #70m.
Although the halfway dividend of 0.6p is the same as the payout for
Saracen's initial interim accounting period from March to September last
year, the trust presented it as a significant increase because last
year's ''first half'' was in fact a seven-month period.

Washington
TODAY was a good day for the Democrats as General Colin Powell
announced that he would not be standing in next year's presidential
election. He was the only Republican who showed any sign of being able
to beat President Bill Clinton.
Furthermore, the Democrats did well in elections in various parts of
the country yesterday, holding on to the governorship of Kentucky,
despite a strong onslaught by the Republicans, and keeping control of
the Virginia state assembly.
A Democratic candidate did well -- but lost -- in the governor's race
in Mississippi, but Democrats won every other position there, as usual.
It seems that the Republican tide has crested, for the moment, and there
is hope for the battered liberals of the Democratic party after all.
Also, obviously, the general's decision was an immense relief for the
various candidates running for the Republican nomination.
The party will now be spared a savage fight between conservatives and
moderates and can choose between the various conservative candidates --
and the odds are still most strongly in favour of Senator Bob Dole.
The only trouble with the party's prospects is that Senator Dole runs
consistently 10 or more points behind the president in the polls.
Conventional wisdom was that General Powell would have a tough fight to
win the Republican nomination, but would then stand an excellent chance
of winning the election.
Conversely, Dole looks set to coast to victory in the series of
primaries that begins next February, but will then stand little chance
of defeating the president.
Powell's departure also simplifies the choice for the American
electorate. Do they really want to continue down the revolutionary road
marked out by Newt Gingrich and his fellow extremists?
Dole, let alone the other potential Republican nominees, especially
Senator Phil Gramm, will support the ''Contract with America' in all its
ideological purity, while President Clinton will offer a centrist,
liberal alternative.
It will be a matter of ''A choice, not an echo,' to revive the old
slogan offered by Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964, the year the modern
conservative movement was born.
What is more, people will be able to vote on a real party programme.
Usually, the parties put out a mish-mash of platitude and faint hopes
that no-one every reads or remembers. But next year, Americans will be
able to judge the first two years of the Gingrich model of government,
and vote whether they want to carry it through to the end.
General Powell would not have allowed them that choice. He is a
centrist, a moderate, far more like Mr Clinton than Senator Dole. Of
course, he may be offered the vice-presidential nomination in due
course, and stand next in line for the nomination in 2000. But that's a
long way off.
Now that the Powell digression has been concluded, the previous
questions return to demand answers: will Ross Perot run again and will
Newt Gingrich take the plunge?
Perot has set up his own political party which has already mustered
enough support to get on the ballot in California and will doubtless
manage the same feat in every other state. At this stage, he does not
appear to have the same popularity he enjoyed in 1992, when he won 19%
of the vote. But that could easily change if popular dissatisfaction
with a Clinton-Dole race increases.
Clinton won in 1992 because Perot took so many votes from President
George Bush, so he doubtless hopes that the Texan billionaire will stand
again -- and the Republicans dread the prospect.
As for Speaker Gingrich, he says that he is 90% against running, but
that could change. People will tell him that Senators Dole and Gramm,
let alone the other Republican candidates, stand no chance of beating
Clinton. Vanity will tell him that he alone among Republicans has the
authority, intellect, energy and luck to reach the White House.
He could yet take the plunge -- but it will have to be soon. He would
need to raise a great deal of money very quickly to have any hope
against the Dole and Gramm machines. But he has never lacked
self-confidence, and ambition and vanity are whispering in his ear.
He is very ambitious, and very vain.
Other people might argue that he is too abrasive, too much a bully and
too short-tempered to appeal to the American people.
There are also skeletons in his closet that he ought to consider
before exposing himself to the merciless light of presidential politics.
The Democrats have made some sort of a comeback, largely because of
the unpopularity of the budget-cutting measures proposed by the
Republicans, and the odds are that they will hold the White House next
year, whether or not Gingrich enters the race. But that's not enough,
yet, to win them Congress. So look for another five years, at least, of
ferocious partisan politics, and gridlock, in Washington.

comedy, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. A collection
of cheap laughs, it makes the Australian tale of three drag queens
travelling across the Outback, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, a film
for which I had little time, seem positively masterly.
If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery it can also, in the
wrong hands, be a gross insult and Ms Keedron's are surprisingly not the
right hands for what is a blatant rip-off. Her credentials as the
director of Oranges are the Only Fruit which looked at sexual deviancy
with tact and understanding suggested it would be otherwise. She
elicited fine performances from the players involved, but their material
was worth doing whereas Douglas Carter Beane's script is not.
Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo (Butch to the core
fellas, my dears) play New York drag queens who set off by Cadillac for
Hollywood and stardom. Vida (Swayze) is a fairy godmother type who
spreads stardust and happiness wherever she goes, and Noxeema (Snipes,
overacting hideously) is an eye-rolling screamer who does the same. Chi
Chi (Leguizamo) is a strident Puerto Rican rent boy whose behaviour
makes Rita Moreno at her camp worst look as if she were on Valium, whom
they decided to train in the art of being a drag queen, as if, on the
evidence of our eyes, they knew how.
After encountering a homophobic policeman (Chris Penn), their car
breaks down and they are stranded in a small backwater township where
everybody is clearly needing their eyes tested, since they take the trio
for real women. Vida rescues a battered wife (Stockard Channing, gives a
touching performance which belongs in a different film) by slugging the
husband -- would that it were so easy.
Noxeema helps a catatonic old lady talk again by sharing her interest
in old movies, and Chi Chi, whose bizarre behaviour nearly gets her
raped by the local louts, learns to give. She surrenders the local nice
boy, possibly the village idiot, who has fallen for her, to his true
love, after teaching the little girl about makeup.
Male stars dragging up in the cinema is nothing new, but seldom has it
been done so badly. The film avoids any suggestion that the trio have
any sexuality, something Priscilla, for all its faults, did not do.
The film's treatment of drag queens who are, after all, under the
slap, people, is contemptible and vulgar.

BANK OF ENGLAND QUARTERLY REPORT
THE Bank of England has sought to justify its change of heart on
interest rates two months after the Governor, Eddie George, said he was
no longer pressing the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, for
an increase.
The latest quarterly inflation report concludes that underlying
inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, will be ''a
fraction above'' 2.5% in two years, and that the balance of risks to its
central forecast, previously mainly on the upside, are now more evenly
spread.
The Bank's economics director, Mervyn King, said: ''The probability of
hitting the inflation target is higher. The risks are now evenly
balanced. That is why our advice on interest rates changed in September
to wait and see.''
He also said that the likelihood of just missing the 2.5% target was
not an argument for changing rates. The balance of risks should
determine policy.
If rates were half a percent higher the outlook would be below 2.5%,
he added, and then asked if this would be a justification for cutting
them.
The Bank does not deal in specific inflation forecasts. Graphics
charts it published suggested that inflation would be around 2.6% in two
years against a 2.75% outcome in the August report.
The report noted that the economy had weakened, but forecast that
growth would pick up again next year in line with an increase in
personal consumption. ''It doesn't strike me that the economy is moving
into a recession,'' said Mr King.
The report said that sterling's depreciation earlier in the year led
to an increase in import prices and hence in the prices of domestic
goods and services.
''Most of the first-round impact of the depreciation on the retail
price level has probably come through by now, but this still has the
effect of pushing up the 12-month inflation rate for some months to come
-- leading to a peak in annual RPIX (underlying) inflation around the
middle of next year.''
Inflation seems likely to peak at around 3.5%. Thereafter it is
expected to fall ''towards, but remaining just above, 2.5%''.
Underlying inflation rose from 2.8% in June to 3.1% in September on
the back of increases in seasonal food prices, which the Bank thinks
should unwind over the next year. If seasonal food prices are excluded
inflation would have dropped to 2.7%.
The Bank expects inflation to increase slightly in October, partly
because discounting of non-seasonal food prices and other special
factors last autumn is unlikely to be repeated. Inflation is expected to
remain higher in November before falling back in December.
The report said that the uncertainties in the outlook are more evenly
distributed around the central projection than earlier in the year.
''Consequently although not the most likely outcome, there is now a
somewhat greater chance that inflation will be below 2.5% in two years
time.
''Earlier the main risk to the inflation outlook was that second-round
effects of higher import prices would push up inflation. So far there
have been only limited signs of that. But the risk has not
disappeared.''
The probability of weaker demand and output in the short term had
risen, the Bank claimed. Nevertheless, an acceleration of demand was
quite possible, particularly in the light of the behaviour of broad
money, close to the top of its 3% to 9% target range.
As well as its concerns over the money supply and a pickup in demand,
the Bank is worried lest earnings growth accelerates more than expected.
''The uncertainties surrounding the central projection have increased
since the August report, and the range of possible outcomes is wider.
''Achieving the inflation target in two years time is by no means
assured. It will depend on how the present uncertainties are resolved
over the coming months.''
Goldman Sachs's David Walton said the inflation report indicated the
Bank's continued preference for unchanged monetary policy given that
underlying inflation is still expected to be slightly above the 2.5%
target two years from now.
''However, the Bank's assessment of the risks is now much more evenly
balanced and so its advice could easily change in coming months (in
either direction) depending on economic developments,'' he added.
''The report may initially dampen expectations of a base rate cut in
December, although it should not really change prospects for a small cut
by next spring, especially as the economy could be very soft over this
period.''

William Russell views two giants who are never out of their depth, and
finds a lavish study of a castrati singer slightly lacking.
MEN dominate the screen this week. In Tony Scott's immaculately
constructed post Cold War thriller, Crimson Tide, two of Hollywood's
finest actors, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington, battle for supremacy
as the commander and second-in-command of a stranded nuclear submarine.
Hackman's role as Commander Ramsey, the hard-bitten boss of the US
Alabama, fits him like a glove. Watch the relish with which he spits out
his lines, announcing amid a cloud of cigar smoke that he only trusts
air he can see, or lets his beloved Jack Russell, the character's sole
concession to human feelings, leave its calling card all over the
submarine.
The end of the Cold War seemed to put paid to this sort of thriller,
once a Hollywood staple, but real life has stepped into rescue the
genre. Crimson Tide is also not a million miles removed from the
splendid 1963 film, The Bedford Incident, which starred Sydney Poitier,
ignoring his colour as is that of Washington here, and Richard Widmark.
That too involved a similar clash of wills. This movie has adroitly
reinvented the familiar, while exploiting the new ingredient, the
political instability in Eastern Europe.
Current events in Russia caused by President Yeltsin's ill health have
lent added topicality, making the dilemma the two men face genuine, not
just a writer's invention.
A renegade Russian nationalist has apparently seized control of a
former Soviet nuclear base. The Alabama, cruising off Russian waters, is
ordered by Washington to destroy the base, provided this is actually the
case. But if the Russian government have already seen the rebels off,
such intervention would start the Third World War.
The vital instructions are coming through when the Alabama's
communications system fails. Ramsey insists they fire their missiles,
Hunter (Washington) that they must wait until communications are
restored and the message is complete.
The ensuing battle of wills is a no-holds-barred affair in which Scott
exploits the claustrophobic confines of the submarine to the full, just
as he did the cramped spaces of the military aircraft in Top Gun and the
motor-racing cars in Days of Thunder.
Hackman, giving full rein to Ramsey's macho flamboyance, suggests both
a volcano of man, someone on the verge of an emotional explosion, and
one of tremendous personal authority. For his part, Washington uses an
ice-cool, slightly priggish demeanour to create the necessary
counterbalance to this monster. Hunter is a man who will not simply go
by the book. He has to think a decision through to its logical
conclusion.
The result demonstrates what star acting is about, but the film is
more than just an acting duel. The tension is nerve-rackingly conveyed,
and the moral dilemma the two men confront genuine. Scott has done
nothing better.
Men who are less than men are the subject of Gerard Corbiau's award
winning Farinelli, a lavishly photographed, very sloppily devised life
of the most famous of all castrati singers, Carlo Broschi.
Born in Naples in 1705, Carlo (Stefano Dionisi) was one of the sex
symbols of the age, because castrati, while ill-equipped for the task,
exerted amazing sexual power over women. They were the pop stars of the
time.
His older brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso) was a composer who wrote
several operas for him and the brothers travel Europe together giving
performances on stage and of. In bed, Riccardo finishes what Carlo can
only begin.
Farinelli was a contemporary of Handel (Jeroen Krabbe), and the film
tells of the rivalry between Drury Lane, where Handel's works were
staged, and the Nobles' Theatre, where Farinelli performed.
The opera sequences are sumptuously staged and ravishingly sung, some
impression of what a castrato singer sounded like being provided by
electronically morphing the voices of a counter-tenor and a soprano. The
handsome Dionisi's lip-synching is poor, so the result sounds infinitely
more convincing than it looks.

THERE are just four months left before we must say goodbye to old and
trusted friends, loyal retainers who have spent our money in good times
and in bad, who have never taken a bus when a chauffeur-driven limo was
available, who travelled the globe to promote our interests and their
expenses. It is farewell to the regional councils.
Throughout Scotland there is a profound feeling of shock at the loss.
A so-long Strathclyde march, with wee Tommy Clarke at its head, will
arrive at Downing Street next Tuesday to ask the Prime Minister to think
again.
''Even at this late hour,'' declared TC, ''the catastrophe can be
avoided.'' He added he had sent Mr Major several postcards on the
subject.
However, should the noble campaign fail to succeed, the elected
members of Strathclyde are, as we revealed in this journal yesterday,
ready and more than willing to make sure they go out with a heid-bang. A
plan has been drawn up to spend #500,000 to mark the demise of the
council.
Among the fun-filled events under consideration is the preparation of
a final report including anecdotes from councillors and officials. Wow
-- won't that be a best-seller! ''So I said to big Willie at the social
work sub: 'That's goin' to cost a million quid, by the way.'
''And he replied: 'Oh, you don't want the full service, then?' We
laughed till the tears ran down the ratepayers' faces.
''Then there was the time we lost Charlie in Peking . . .''
There will be commemorative events for councillors, officials,
representatives of the community, businesses, and others who have given
support to the regional council over the years. Or, to put it more
simply, a series of parties.
Next come the gifts. Substantial ones, mind you, none of those plastic
ballpoints with a picture of the chief executive on them, we are talking
class here.
Let's think -- apart from passport holders what do the councillors
need most? How about pensions, a Strathclyde endowment scheme which pays
retrospective special responsibility allowances to all former members.
For life.
Or perhaps we could create an annual Strathclyde holiday fund for
deserving citizens, former officials who have had to live in the real
world, so that they could have a wee sail doon the water each spring.
Yes, the Mediterranean.
The Bob Gould Story, a 25-part television series charting the career
of the great man himself, will be broadcast nightly on BBC Scotland. Mel
Gibson has agreed to play the title role.
News of the Strathclyde farewell bonanza has spread through the
country like the Asian 'flu. A spokesman for Lothian region insisted
late last might that they would not be overshadowed. ''We have been the
biggest spenders in the country, topping the table every year for rates,
poll tax, and council tax. There is no way we are giving up the no 1
spot.''
The official confirmed that, even as we spoke, a high-powered team of
councillors and officials was working on plans for the final days. ''The
Labour group has retired to a luxury hotel in Athens to consider
practically nothing else.''
Among the ideas being considered is a plan to ask Parliament to
re-name Edinburgh as Lothian, to have an annual holiday called Lothian
day, and to erect a statue of convener Eric Milligan on Calton Hill.
''Persons have been approached for donations,'' admitted the
spokesperson.
Also under review is the proposed building of a liner named ''The
Pride of Lothian'', the purchase of a new council Ferrari, and the
twinning of Lothian with Bermuda and the Jimmy Cook islands. The Queen,
President Clinton, and Boris Yeltsin (health permitting) will attend the
final banquet to be held at Murrayfield which will be roofed for the
occasion.
The spokesperson was asked, quite unfairly in my view, by hostile and
probing hacks from the media, whether, in view of the council's
projected #8m deficit and resolve to slash budgets for services such as
social work and education, this was really the best time to be spending
huge sums on hospitality? ''Everyone knows this whole reorganisation of
local government was a cynical attempt by the Tory Government to
undermine the status of Labour authorities. If they did not want us to
have farewell parties they should never have abolished us in the first
place.
''The public will see through their little game.''
The spokesperson stressed that he or she, no-one is permitted to ask
which, was a non-political official only trying to serve the citizenry.
At a specially-convened meeting of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities a row broke out when district councils complained they were
being left out of the celebrations. ''We are going out of business as
well,'' pointed out their leaders.
''People are really upset to see the end of such fine authorities as
Monklands and Motherwell. They want their share of the jollies.''
Unfortunately no-one from Motherwell could be present at the meeting as
the elected members were all abroad.
Mr Clarke, tipped by many for high office in a future government not
led by Tony Blair, said this was another matter he would take up with
the PM. ''It is high time we ended this Tory sleaze.''
* NEWS FLASH: The average council tax increase in Scotland next year
is likely to be 15%.

Tel Aviv
ISRAELI police today took the head of the shadowy Jewish militant
group Eyal to court as a third suspect in connection with the
assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, witnesses said.
Army radio said Avishai Raviv appeared at the remand hearing in Tel
Aviv magistrates' court on charges of conspiracy and failure to prevent
murder.
The confessed assassin, Yigal Amir, 25, and his brother Hagai, 27,
both arrested on Saturday, have already been remanded in custody.
Raviv is a philosophy student at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv
where Amir studied law.
A fellow student of Amir's at the religious university told Israel
Radio shortly after Rabin's assassination on Saturday that he believed
Amir had links to the group
Amir has said he killed Rabin because he handed over land to the
Palestinians under a peace deal.
Israel's government today ordered a state commission of inquiry to
focus on the assassination but not on the wider issue of right-wing
Jewish extremism.
A preliminary investigation by the Shin Bet secret police presented to
the cabinet revealed glaring secrutity gaps which cost Rabin his life.
It also highlighted a lack of intelligence on the killer and the
extremist Jewish settler groups he frequented.
Police are investigating whether the Amir brothers were part of a
wider extreme right-wing conspiracy to assassinate the prime minister
after a peace rally in Tel Aviv.
Police are questioning ''a large number of people -- acquaintances,
friends, relatives,'' police spokesman Eric Bar-Chen said.
Rabin's assassination was the first of an Israeli leader in the
47-year history of the security-conscious country. The gunman fired
three shots, killing Rabin and wounding a security guard, at point-blank
range.
Security sources said last month that security around the 73-year-old
Rabin had been beefed up following public outbursts in which he was
heckled, attacked and called a traitor by right-wingers opposed to his
peace deals with the PLO.
Amir's family sent a letter to Rabin's widow Leah yesterday asking
forgiveness.
Bar-Ilan University, which has condemned the killing, said its student
union would hold a memorial evening of song and prayer for the slain
prime minister.
The university, which has an international reputation for scholarship,
said a condolence book had been opened on campus for the signature of
its 17,000 students. The book will be presented to Rabin's family.
At today's court hearing, police representative Nissim Daoudi alleged
Raviv had conspired to murder Rabin and failed to prevent his killing.
He handed the judge secret evidence that was not disclosed in court.
''I have presented the court with several pieces of evidence that link
the suspect with the crime and contradict the suspect's claim of a
political arrest,'' Daoudi told the court.
Raviv denied the charges. He acknowledged he had heard Yigal Amir talk
about the idea of killing Rabin, but said he had not taken it seriously.
''Remarks were made but nobody took him seriously . . . Words are one
thing and actions are another. According to Jewish law, murder is
forbidden,'' he said.
He accused police of using Rabin's murder as a pretext to persecute
right-wing activists.
He told the court he was attending a nearby demonstration at the time
of the shooting. He said Amir, whom he called ''Yigal'', had been due to
attend but did not show up.
''Eyal is a legal movement and I am now the head of Eyal, which stands
for the Land of Israel, the People of Israel according to the Torah
(Bible) of Israel.
''All the security officials know the movement is legal and no-one has
ever proven anything against us. I deny the accusations,'' Raviv said.
He was remanded in custody for a week.
Earlier, the head of the protection branch of the Shin Bet secret
police resigned after a preliminary inquiry revealed glaring security
gaps, cabinet officials said,
Three lower-ranking officials were suspended.
Acting prime minister Shimon Peres ordered a state commission of
inquiry after the cabinet reviewed a report by the head of the Shin Bet,
known only by the Hebrew initial of his name, Kaf. All Shin Bet names
are barred from publication.
The report pointed to an enormous security lapse and also to a lack of
intelligence on the killer and extremist jewish groups.
''As a result of the faulty planning and operation and primarily as a
result of not correcting breaches, the murderer succeeded to approach
the prime minister at a fatal proximity,'' the report said.
* Foreign Secretary Malcom Rifkind said after talks with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus today that the Syrian leader wanted
to see a quick breakthrough in peace talks with Israel.

I ACTED . . . on God's orders . . . So said Yigal Amir after shooting
Yitzhak Rabin three times in the back. The man who shot Gandhi did it on
behalf of God. Christian knights who massacred millions of Muslims in
the crusades did it for God.
Does God only speak to homicidal maniacs? If He really wanted to do in
a bloke He could pulverside him with a thunderbolt and make His point
much more effectively. Deploying hit men smacks of the Mafia. More
Godfather than God.
I don't believe God speaks to those who say he does. I bet He doesn't
even speak to Michael Heseltine, but then neither do I. Those who claim
God speaks to them are probably hallucinating nutters. Dangerous
punters.
If you believe you're an avenging agent of God then you're above and
beyond man-made laws. Answerable to no mere earthlings. Kill and get
retrospective backing from you know who. Self-indulgence on the cosmic
scale. A licence to kill. A formula for disaster.
Religious fundamentalism is a madness. The Christian fundamentalists
are ecclesiastical fascists, a bigger threat to American democracy than
Stalin ever was. Islamic fundamentalists have done great damage to
Islam, a religion of genuine intellectual and cultural merit, and now
threaten to tear apart the Muslim world. Jewish fundamentalists are a
bigger danger to Israel than Islamic fundamentalists. They tear asunder
the culture they purport to serve.
Real peace in the Middle East will be secured when religious fanatics
are ideologically dispersed, not by governmental decrees, for they don't
work in the long term, but by pursuing them, relentlessly, in open
debate. Give their idiocies nowhere to hide, in an atmosphere of
rational discourse. Let the world laugh at their ludicrous posturings,
even while we recoil at their atrocities. Set to right the wrongs on
which they feed. In a loving, rational world there will be no room for
fundamentalism. We and God can then relax and have a bit of a giggle.
It was in the sixties. I was at Euston station seeing off my wife and
three-year-old daughter. They were going home to Glasgow. It was a
fortnight to Christmas. I would join them for the festivities. There was
a little old lady sitting by the window, knitting away, dressed like
Miss Marple.
That night I phoned Joan. The journey had been uneventful except for
an incident concerning the little old lady. Our daughter had undressed
her doll and would dress it again as per usual. The old lady complained
about the doll's nudity, it outraged her sensitivities. She moved to
another compartment so that her eyes would not be offended by a naked
doll, which was devoid of all sexual paraphernalia. The little old lady
with her air of respectability obviously had a mind like a sewer.
I've been photographed in the bare scud at the water's edge on the
beach at Ayr. I was two at the time, and round my midriff hung a wee
life belt which coincidentally covered my wee willie.
I've watched kids without clothes playing by beach or swimming pool.
Mums and dads swoop on them, throw them in the air, cuddle and kiss
them. These are heart-warming scenes of innocence and love. Humankind at
its best.
Babes at bath time can be enchanting. Gurgling with contentment in the
safe hands of their parents. People want to capture these scenes for the
family album and do so with the camera or the video camera.
Today in our society there are too many people like that little old
lady in the train. The human organs which create life become objects of
shame while the instruments by which life was destroyed are hailed as
symbols of glorious manhood. In our parks and squares are statues of
mass murderers in military garb holding their weapons and of naked Greek
gods with fig leaves where there willies should be.
No wonder we have so many sexual weirdos, and the worst are those who
prey on children, the paedophiles. Children above all must be protected,
let the police and the judicial process have all the powers they need to
put these people where they belong, in custodial psychiatric care.
But the police must act with judgment or they will introduce in some
people's minds an element of guilt or fear about healthy and innocent
relations between adult and child, parents and their babes. Julia
Sommerville and her partner have been through hell. They took
photographs of her child in the bath. He took the negatives to Boots
where an employee of Kodak developed them.
He later went to pick up the photos and was grabbed by the police, and
so was she. Their names have been splattered in newspapers, television,
and radio news bulletins. The developer has been interviewed by the Sun.
The couple haven't yet been charged. It is now likely that they will not
be charged, presumably on the grounds there is no charge to answer.
I love my family. Everyone loves their family. I show my love for my
family, not everyone does. One of my daughters brought home some school
friends. I came in from work and as usual kissed my wife and daughters,
and was introduced to my daughter's friends.
One of the little girls told my daughter that her daddy had never
kissed her. I found that very sad. One of the negative aspects of our
culture is that men should not express openly their affections or ever
greet, which is considered unmanly. To hell with that. I cry when Lassie
gets lost. ET's return to his own people, with the help of his wee pals
down here, had me bubbling.
Children need to be loved. They need to know they're loved. At the
funeral of Yitzhak Rabin his granddaughter said, ''Great men have
already eulogised you but no-one has felt, like I have, the caress of
your warm and soft hands, or your warm embrace which was reserved for us
alone and your half smile which always told me so much.''
I was moved by the love of this young lass for her grandfather, and
his love for her. It is what life is about, or should be.

PARIS: France is to award 1355 surviving First World War veterans the
Legion of Honour on Saturday, the 77th anniversary of the end of the
war, minister for veterans Pierre Pasquini said. He said the youngest
veteran was 94 and the oldest was 107. They would receive the awards in
ceremonies in town halls across the country. Another 300 to 400 veterans
of the 1914-1918 war had been traced and they would receive the award
after their records, scattered over the years, had been checked.

IT happened one morning. Poring over the newspapers in the office,
head in hands, fingers idly fidgeting in the scalp, and it fell out.
Right on to a page of the Financial Times. I poked it, disbelieving,
hoping it was a stray blob of ink. But it moved, it jumped. It hopped
from a headline to become a shifting plook on the nose of Jacques
Chirac. It was a louse.
The rational reaction to such a moment is to head, calmly, for the
chemist's for a family pack of insecticide. The instinctive response is
very different. First you utter one of those contained pressure-cooker
screams, the sort you give when you've just got the baby to sleep and
step back on to a piece of Lego, then you leg it to hide in the
lavatory.
There is no shame to head lice infestation. No, no, it happens
nowadays in the very best of families. Havers. You can't scrub away
years of conditioning, the ritual of the bone comb that was to Saturday
nights in the sixties what Anthea Turner and the lottery draw is today.
Only your chance of hitting the jackpot, with a brace of nits, was
higher. Juke Box Jury was followed by Dixon of Dock Green and the
malicious rake of the bone comb.
So I sat there, smile fixed like the work of an amateur embalmer, and
wondered what to do. You should tell everyone in the office immediately,
the small, still voice of reason squeaked. Should you hell, smirked the
craven impulse to keep quiet and the sly urge to slope off home for a
delousing session.
When your early life instils the sense that to let Senga borrow your
comb after gym is only mildly more injurious to health than swallowing a
gallon of arsenic while leaping off the Scott Monument with a gun in
your mouth, no amount of soothing public health education helps budge
the horror.
Then, anything, anything, was better than a shaven, shiny-skull
hairdo, and the ignominy of being handed the sealed brown envelope after
a visit from the nit nurse.
STRANGE how we've gone all over sentimental about nit nurses since
they disappeared from schools. Ours were a bunch of hatchet-faced
sadists, but maybe we were particularly unlucky. Maybe they had to use
up a stray squad of wall-eyed women with pursed lips and bosoms like
stuffed bolsters whose training in counter-intelligence techniques with
which to flay the Gestapo had been found a better use.
Of course, it's different now. We have lifted the burden of secrecy
and deceit and taught this generation of children that it's cool to be
deloused. Let's make it into a game, I thought.
They were not to know, as I did, because I went to the library with my
hood up to find out -- that the lice live close to the scalp and feed on
blood which they suck, that the mating female lays between six and eight
eggs every 24 hours, that the eggs glued tightly to hairs close to the
scalp hatch in about seven days to become adults in 10 days and that
their lifespan is up to 60 days. Because they were not to be frightened.
It may be that we went wrong somewhere in trying to strike the right
balance. You know how they save up revelations of family intimacies for
moments of exquisite inappropriateness? Like when you're in a bakers'
queue of frosty- faced New Town ladies and they demand to know at that
precise moment how exactly the seed met the egg that made them a baby?
Only this time it was different: Mum, can we play Hunt the Nits again
tonight, oh please mum, . . . mum why are you grinning so horribly, why
are we walking backwards, stealthily, out of the shop, mu-um?
Of course I was responsible and informed the school immediately, well
quite immediately, or nearly immediately after the delousing. The head
teacher was understanding itself: ''Of course there's absolutely nothing
to be ashamed of and thank you for confe . . . er, being responsible,''
she said, somehow managing not to glance significantly at the row of
livid scalps.
I fear, though, that in eradicating shame, well nearly, we may have
taken things too far. Ours were nearly sick with excitement last week
waiting for Bug-Buster Day, a recent inventive school campaign to
eradicate head lice with a pink comb and a lot of fun. And all that
happy-clappy positivism has left them slightly confused. Oh mum, don't
kill them, mum.
I do hope you're not scratching. Hysterical lice syndrome, involving
the frantic urge to scratch, which cannot be assuaged by even the most
assiduous inspection of the contents of the bone comb, afflicts even the
most level-headed people. As any of my colleagues will tell you.

Jeddah
FORMER Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, in comments published today, said he
doubted he would be invited to return to the country he brutally ruled
for eight years at the cost of an estimated half a million lives.
Asked whether he would return to Uganda if granted amnesty, the former
president said: ''It would be ridiculous for the people who keep calling
me a buffoon and a dictator to invite me back.''
Amin, 67, told the state-run New Vision daily from his home in exile
in the Saudi port city of Jeddah that he did not regret his decision to
expel all 70,000 ethnic Asians from Uganda in 1972.
The expulsion, with 90 days' notice, ruined Uganda's economy which is
still struggling to recover. Amin said the move had been popular with
ordinary Ugandans, who took over Asian-owned businesses, and argued that
current President Yoweri Museveni only asked the Asians back to please
former colonial power Britain.
Amin seized power in 1971 from President Milton Obote and was
responsible for the brutal murders of many top politicians,
intellectuals and religious leaders who criticised him. An estimated
500,000 people were killed during his rule.
He has lived in quiet exile since he was ousted by exiled Ugandans and
Tanzanian troops in 1979. It was his first interview with a Ugandan
paper in three years.
Amin denied any connection with the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF)
guerrilla group.
Museveni says the WNBF, first heard of last May and led by Amin's
former information minister Colonel Juma Oris, was backed by the former
dictator and has bases in both Sudan and Zaire.
New Vision said Amin rarely leaves Saudi Arabia and his last trip was
to Nigeria, Gabon and Zaire in the early 1990s.--Reuter.

Lagos
NIGERIA'S ruling military council today confirmed death sentences on
nine activists from the Ogoni minority area, a member of the council
said.
The nine, including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, president of the Movement
for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples (Mosop), were found guilty last week
by a tribunal of the murder of four pro-government chiefs in the
oil-producing area.
''This is a case of murder and we accepted in totality the
pronouncement and the verdict of the tribunal and that is that those who
were convicted should die by hanging,'' said Brigadier-General Sam Malu
after the military council's meeting at Abuja
He did not say when the sentences would be carried out.
''The PRC (Provisional Ruling Council) unanimously agreed and accepted
the verdict of the tribunal,'' Malu said.
He added: ''We have gone through the papers in detail and we are
completely satisfied with both the constitution of the tribunal, the
outcome and the whole conduct of the tribunal.''
Nigeria has been under international pressure to commute the death
sentences, and faces a threat of economic sanctions by the Commonwealth
when the heads of state of the group meet in New Zealand from Friday.
Asked if clemency had now been ruled out, Malu replied: ''This is a
case of murder.''
The swift confirmation of the death sentences by Nigeria's generals
will put more pressure on leaders of the Commonwealth to take action
against General Sani Abacha's government.
Earlier this month, Abacha commuted death sentences on some of 40
Nigerian officers and civilians tried on coup plot charges, including
former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo.
The Ogoni case has also focused attention on environmental concerns
for Nigeria's oil-producing areas.
The Mosop group has campaigned for self-determination for the 500,000
Ogoni people and for the protection of their land, where Shell is the
major oil producer.
Author Saro-Wiwa held political office in previous military
governments in Nigeria and has won environmental awards from foreign
organisations for his Ogoni campaign.
Human rights group Amnesty International has declared him and the
other Ogoni leaders prisoners of conscience.
The Nigerian unit of giant oil firm Shell said it regretted
confirmation of the death sentences on the activists in the volatile
Ogoni area where it pumps crude oil but said it could not interfere in
the affair.--Reuter.
Shell produces half of Nigeria's roughly two million barrels per day
of crude oil output but has suspended operations in Ogoniland since 1993
following civil disturbances there.--Reuter.

Sweetwater, Florida
MARYLING Flores and Christian Davila were teenage sweethearts,
forbidden by her mother from dating.
The pain of separation was so deep, they wrote in parting notes, that
they chose to end their lives together.
Two bodies found floating in a canal in Sweetwater, Florida, were
those of Maryling and Christian, fellow students at Ruben Dario middle
school in northwest Dade County.
Neither knew how to swim.
''We don't suspect any foul play,'' said detective Ramon Quintero, a
friend of the Flores family. ''The mother of the girl did not want the
boy seeing her daughter.''
Christian was 14, Maryling 13.
''It's a Romeo and Juliet story,'' said Quintero. ''This is as sad a
case as you can find.''
Family members told police the teenagers ran away from their homes
early on Sunday morning, carrying little money and no extra clothes.
Both left behind suicide notes.
''I can't go on living. I've lost my Maryling. That's something that
hurts me very deep inside in my heart,'' Christian wrote in his note to
his family.
Maryling's note was left on her family's kitchen counter.
''You'll never be able to understand the love between me and
Christian,'' she wrote to her parents. ''I feel that without him I can't
live.''--AP.

SCOTTISHPOWER produced a reasonable set of first-half figures
yesterday, but reserved comment on the performance of its newly acquired
regional electricity company Manweb until January.
Pre-tax profits rose 3.9% to #127.7m during the six months to
September 30, coming in at the lower end of most forecasts.
But ScottishPower pleased the City with a generous 13.6% increase in
the interim dividend to 5.17p and the promise of a full-year payout of
15.5p.
Turnover rose 6% to #776.9m during the first half of the year, but
most of the increase came from non-electricity business, in particular
ScottishPower's chain of electrical retail stores.
Profit growth was pared back from 5.6% at the operating level by the
cost of launching the successful #1130m bid for Manweb in July.
ScottishPower had spent #205.6m on the bid by the end of September,
mostly on buying Manweb shares in the open market.
But Manweb did not fall to it until mid-October and the full impact of
the acquisition will only be felt during the second half of the
financial year.
ScottishPower will outline its restructuring plans for Manweb at a
briefing for City analysts on January 18.
Chairman Murray Stuart said the second half of the year had begun
''satisfactorily'' and the group was on course to achieve full-year
results ''in line with our expectations''.
However, some analysts cut their full-year profit forecasts. Bill
McCall of broker Tilney in Edinburgh reduced his from #409m to #390m,
but Kevin Lapwood at Smith New Court in London held his forecast
unchanged at #363m. ScottishPower made a pre-tax profit of #375.3m in
1994-95.
But the overall impression of the results was positive and its shares
advanced 5[1/2]p to 361p.
Chief executive Ian Robinson declined to reveal what measures would be
implemented to cut costs and boost efficiency at Manweb, which
distributes electricity in Merseyside and North Wales.
But he said the need for hefty staff cuts had been reduced by the
decision of Manweb's previous management to shed 850 employees in August
and September, while it was still fighting ScottishPower's takeover bid.
The Chester-based utility currently has 3300 employees.
ScottishPower's immediate priority is to absorb Manweb, which should
be earnings enhancing in the 1996-97 financial year.
But Mr Robinson hinted that it would soon be back on the acquisition
trail. This time the target is likely to be an electricity company in
the US, Australia or India. ''I think within the next six months we will
have refined our thinking on this a bit,'' he said.
ScottishPower dropped plans to bid for the privatisation of
Australia's United Energy four months ago in order to go for Manweb. But
Mr Robinson said international expansion was ''one of the key areas''
for ScottishPower's future development.
Despite North West Water's agreed bid for Norweb and news yesterday
that Welsh Water is contemplating a bid for South Wales Electricity, Mr
Robinson said ScottishPower had ''no plans at present'' to develop links
with a UK water company.
However, the company still has expansion plans on the domestic front.
In particular, it aims to boost its electricity sales to England and
Northern Ireland as soon as new trunk power lines are built.
ScottishPower currently has surplus generating capacity for which
there is no immediate outlet.
Mr Robinson said he expected the Government to give final approval for
upgrading the interconnector between Scotland and England in the first
quarter of next year. This should enable the company to double its
electricity exports to England to 2200 megawatts by 1997, boosting its
share of the English and Welsh power supply market to around 10%.
He anticipates Government approval for the construction of a separate
250 megawatt undersea power link between Scotland and Northern Ireland
by the middle of next year. This should be operational by 1999.
He played down news of lower profits from electricity generation
during the first half of this year as a result of tighter market
competition. He said profits made from electricity generation could not
be viewed separately from those made in electricity supply, which is
currently the more profitable side of the business.
The purchase of Manweb, which buys in virtually all the electricity it
distributes, should help ScottishPower as a group to achieve a more even
balance in earnings between supply and generation.

Brussels
THE United States and Russia today announced agreement on a plan for
Russian forces to take part in a multinational force to police any
peacekeeping agreement in Bosnia.
American defence secretary William Perry and Russian defence minister
Pavel Grachev told reporters that the Russian troops would not serve
under Nato military command despite previous demands by the alliance
that all troops in the force be under the control of Nato.
''This plan preserves (Nato) unity of command, but does not require
Russian forces to be under Nato command,'' Perry said.
Both ministers said at a news conference in Brussels that the question
of ''political control'' had not been settled but that experts had been
instructed to work further on the plan. Perry said he would present
details to other Nato defence officials later.
''All the conditions of Russia have been met. Our forces will
contribute . . . but Russian forces will not come under Nato command,''
Grachev said. He added that a Russian general who would serve as a
deputy to the operation's overall commander, US General George Joulwan,
would give all orders to Russian troops.
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton spoke by telephone today with
American journalist David Rohde after the newsman was freed from a
Bosnian Serb prison, the White House said.
''He (Clinton) had a short conversation with him, just to say we're
glad he'd been released,'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry told
reporters.
McCurry said Clinton also told Rohde that most Americans ''are very
grateful for the courageous reporting he'd brought to the subject of
atrocities in Bosnia''.
McCurry said Rohde told Clinton he was grateful for all that had been
done to secure his release.
The phone call was placed to Rohde at the US embassy in Belgrade.
Rohde was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment after being accused of
entering Bosnian Serb territory with false papers on October 29. He was
released after being pardoned by ''president'' Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb press bureau said.
Sources close to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said Milosevic
had intervened with the Bosnian Serbs to secure Rohde's
release.--Reuter.

Los Angeles
PLAYBOY model Anna Nicole Smith was recovering in hospital in Los
Angeles today after a mystery collapse.
She is likely to miss out on a starring role in a #7m lager commercial
which will revolutionise British TV advertising.
She was due to film one of six commercials for Miller Pilsner in
London on Friday but now seems unlikely to make it.
He agent Tony Angellotti said: ''Anna Nicole Smith was admitted late
yesterday to a Los Angeles area hospital following an adverse reaction
to a prescription medication.
''According to her doctor, however, Ms Smith's condition is not in any
way the result of a drug overdose as was erroneously reported by a local
television station.
''Ms Smith has recently been suffering from a medical problem for
which she had had been taking a prescription medication.''
The 27-year-old model is embroiled in a legal battle for the #400m
fortune left behind by her 90-year-old tycoon husband J Howard Marshall
who died after 13 months of marriage.
She had been due to record the commercial with New York comedian Rob
Pruitt.PA/Reuter.

Moscow
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin, recovering in hospital after a mild
heart attack, took his first major decision since he was rushed to
hospital last month by removing his central bank chief today.
''Boris Yeltsin looks very well and is being kept informed about
events in Russia and abroad,'' Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav
Mikhailov told Itar-Tass news agency.
A statement from Yeltsin's press office said separately that acting
central bank head Tatyana Paramonova had been replaced temporarily by
her first deputy chairman Alexander Khandruyev.
Paramonova, unpopular with many commercial bankers, failed twice to
win confirmation in her post by the State Duma lower house of
parliament.
Mikhailov, Moscow's top negotiator with separatists in the breakaway
region of Chechnya, visited Yeltsin and said the 64-year-old leader's
blood pressure was ''absolutely normal''.
The two discussed the situation in Chechnya, and Tass quoted Yeltsin
as saying the government had created favourable conditions for a
peaceful settlement in the southern region.--Reuter.

Auckland
PRIME Minister John Major arrived in New Zealand late today for a
Commonwealthsummit where he is expected to face criticism for supporting
French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
Major, previously reluctant to be drawn into the testing row, last
month lent clear support to French President Jacques Chirac in comments
which angered the New Zealand and Australian governments in particular.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, a vocal opponent of testing,
was expected to raise the issue at bilateral talks with Major tomorrow.
Several thousand people turned out for a ''Major Outrage''
demonstration in Auckland, featuring a giant Greenpeace effigy of Major
and Chirac snuggling up in bed together with a bomb.
France has staged three nuclear tests in the South Pacific since
September as part of a series planned before Paris signs an
international test ban treaty.
Pacific nations oppose the tests on political and environmental
grounds, although Paris insists they are safe and necessary to maintain
the reliability of its nuclear arsenal.
The 52-nation Commonwealth conference opens its biennial summit on
Friday.
The Prime Minister was unbowed over his stance on the nuclear testing
row.
Mr Major was asked for his reaction to protests at his support for
President Chirac's nuclear tests in the region.
''I don't remotely feel as though my back is against the wall on that,
or any other issue,'' he said.
''We know what the feelings are and Britain's position is well
understood.
''No-one is in any doubt about my position. I have said it many times
and I have no regrets.''
Mr Major said Britain had worked very hard for a comprehensive test
ban treaty.
He said it probably would not have happened without Britain's
influence but the decision to carry out tests was for France.
''I understand well people's feelings about it, but that is a decision
for France.
''I am not going to join in general condemnation and I am not going to
change my mind.
''Taking decisions like that is not easy. I doubt President Chirac
took it willingly or easily.''
Meanwhile, the son of a minority rights activist sentenced to hang in
military-ruled Nigeria said today he had won a pledge from New Zealand's
prime minister to raise his father's plight at the Commonwealth summit.
Ken Wiwa, son of condemned writer and activist Ken Saro- Wiwa, said Mr
Bolger made the commitment at a short meeting with him in Auckland.
''We went in to talk specifically about the possibility of raising
this issue of clemency for my father on a humanitarian level,'' Wiwa,
26, told Reuters.
''He (Bolger) said he would make that commitment at the conference.''
Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists in Ogoniland, a
volatile oil-producing region of southeast Nigeria, were sentenced to
death last month for the murder of four pro-government leaders last
year.
The verdicts, after what human rights groups condemned as a political
show trial, have drawn international condemnation. Amnesty International
is among those campaigning on Saro-Wiwa's behalf.
Earlier, Wiwa called on Commonwealth leaders to expel Nigeria at a
joint news conference with exiled Nigerian writer and Nobel prize winner
Wole Soyinka.
''Otherwise . . I accuse them of complicity with the Nigerian
authorities in the human rights abuses in Nigeria,'' Wiwa said.
''It's the only hope my father has now. If the Commonwealth doesn't
say anything, he will be executed.''
Wiwa said Bolger had made no commitment on the issue of sanctions or
expelling Nigeria.
''That's for the Commonwealth to determine, the leaders to determine,
not myself as chair,'' Bolger said.
But he told reporters: ''Any person would be touched talking to a
young man whose father has just been condemned to death.''
Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha has drawn frequent
international condemnation over human rights, and last month's promise
to restore democracy within three years drew only a cautious welcome
from the world community.
Soyinka said each successive outrage by Abacha was designed to eclipse
the memory of the last.
''This demented despot will continue to throw at us yet more poisoned
bait,'' he said.
''Believe me, in another few weeks, there will be yet another atrocity
committed by Abacha's regime, deliberately manufactured, structured, to
obliterate the memory of Ken Saro-Wiwa if we do not wake up to this
pattern of inhuman outrages.''
Abacha, who failed to attend the 50th anniversary of the United
Nations or a recent meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, is not expected
to turn up for the Auckland summit.--Reuter.

Britain has the world's highest breast cancer mortality rate. Tyler
Roberts meets those in the front line of the fight against the disease.
THERE are few diseases which receive the coverage of breast cancer.
But then statistics are shocking: one in 12 women get breast cancer;
over 30,000 women are diagnosed with the disease every year, 300 of
those women die every week. Britain has the highest mortality rate in
the world with roughly six times more instances; it's the leading cause
of death in women aged between 35 and 54. One or two cases in 400 will
be men. And the numbers of cases are increasing from year to year.
It's little wonder then that last month's Breast Cancer Awareness
Month has seen women unite with the launch of the UK National Breast
Cancer Coalition, lobbying for improvements in research, treatment and
aftercare. Headed up by broadcaster Nancy Roberts, diagnosed with breast
cancer four years ago, the coalition follows recent proposals from the
Department of Health and the House of Commons Health Select Committee
recommending radical improvements and a reorganised national cancer
service.
But while the public knowledge of the disease has clearly increased,
the barrage of information currently available can throw up as many
questions and fears, as answers. With breast cancer a woman faces the
sexual and psychological effects as well as the physical. For years a
taboo subject, the post-Pill generation are tackling the issue head on,
the buzz-words changing to recovery, support and awareness.
BACUP (British Association of Cancer United Patients) is one such
support organisation, set up 10 years ago by Vicki Clement Jones, a
doctor diagnosed as having ovarian cancer in her early 30s. The Scottish
office opened in Glasgow last February, offering counselling to patients
and their families with advice from diet to hair loss to complementary
therapies. Co-ordinator Jenny Whelan, a former chemotherapy nurse,
understands the need for an informative and enabling voice.
''There are no easy answers to why some women get breast cancer, but
although the word still sounds like a death sentence, the truth is that
treatments and early diagnosis now mean that many more are cured.''
Edinburgh is recognised as having one of the best breast cancer
centres in Britain. The Western General Hospital not only offers a
comprehensive range of treatments but an invaluable care and information
service. Women are provided with taped recordings of their initial
diagnosis, a simple yet breakthrough idea, diagnosis being an optimum
occasion to gain information but the worst time to remember a word of
it.
The hospital's Reach for Recovery group is made up of women who have
all dealt with the disease and, in turn, offer their advice to patients.
Next year sees the opening of the Maggie Keswick Jencks Cancer Caring
Centre (founded by Jencks, a believer that the fear of dying should not
obliterate the joy of living, following diagnosis of terminal cancer)
will open in the grounds of the Western, offering a place to retreat,
think and talk.
Dr Mike Digson, consultant surgeon in breast cancer at the Western
General, advocates the need for early diagnosis and preaches for a
greater understanding of the choices women have in treatment. ''Cancer
comes in different forms handled in different ways. The mortality rate
has decreased by 11% since 1990 despite the fact that incidences are
increasing. That's treatment-related although women have to appreciate
how to look after themselves.
''There's no single reason; there's the hormonal link with oestrogen
(the cause of male breast cancer as the balance between male and female
hormones alters in older men, which can upset the breast area and create
the climate to let the cancer grow); it's a social trend to have
children later but this increases the risk factor in women; there's a
link with prolonged use of the Pill or HRT and with our diet and fat
intake. Eat vitamin-rich foods, do more exercise, take everything in
moderation, and reduce your chances.''
Breast screening is one of the most touted and yet controversial
methods of detection in that it is thought to have saved the lives of
nearly a quarter of the 26,000 detected since screening was introduced
five years ago, controversial in its price tag of #27 million per annum.
The Government allocates just #3 million a year on research.
It is known that screening does not work successfully on
pre-menopausal women or women on HRT as the breast density makes
possible lumps difficult to detect, medical advice being
self-examination and awareness of body changes. And there's an upper age
limit, with screening offered up until 65, although the mortality rate
increases with age.
Suzanne Witherspoon of the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign hopes that
increased public awareness of the disease might kick-start the
Government into action. Two-thirds of cancer research funding is done by
charities and most support groups are made up of volunteers. The SBCC
National Postcard campaign, launched on June 6, offers women the chance
to voice their anger and frustration by sending pre-printed cards
demanding financial commitment to No 10.
Witherspoon explains: ''recent reports say that there's a lot of
progress being made in the laboratories with drugs and new combinations
of chemotherapy, but there needs to be more political will and finance
in order for it to be translated into better clinical care. It depends
where you're treated; if it's a breast cancer unit you'll probably have
the psychological back-up, but many are still treated by general
surgeons and sent home.''
Although figures vary throughout the country, the standards of
treatment have radically improved. Nine out of 10 lumps discovered are
benign.
Anne MacKay, aged 52, discovered she had breast cancer 12 years ago.
Anne now works with Scottish Breast Cancer Care.
''The lump was discovered by accident: I took up the invitation to a
cervical smear at a Well Woman Clinic and it just happened that they
were also doing breast screenings.
''Surprisingly the operation wasn't painful as there was no muscle
removed. Unlike now, I wasn't given any psychological preparation and it
hit me four days later when I first saw the wound. It wasn't as bad as
I'd expected which said a lot for the surgical expertise. I went for a
prosthesis fitting -- I'd done my homework although I'd never seen one
-- and took a friend to judge the shape that worked for me. My need at
that time was to meet with someone who had survived and got through it.
''Eighteen months later I was back in hospital, only now I was
visiting pre and post-operative patients and telling them how it would
feel. It's a personal growth experience; your lifestyle changes. It's
all right to feel scared and ask questions. That's called survival.''

Geneva
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today the amount of
oil Iraq is allowed to sell under a special Security Council resolution
could be increased in negotiations with Baghdad.
But after a meeting in Geneva with a senior Iraqi official, he said
Iraq still rejected UN supervision of any oil sale and was not yet
willing to discuss implementing the resolution.
''They are not yet ready to negotiate on the basis of resolution
986,'' Boutros-Ghali told reporters.
Iraq has been under a stringent economic embargo since its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait and relief workers are increasingly concerned about
the health of its population.
Under resolution 986 passed in April, Iraq would be allowed to sell $2
billion worth of oil over six months to pay for badly needed
humanitarian supplies, food and medicine. About a third of the proceeds
would go to a UN fund to compensate the victims of its aggression
against Kuwait.
But Iraq has argued that allowing the UN to control its oil sales
would amount to a violation of its sovereignty.
Boutros-Ghali, who has been asked by the Security Council to push the
issue with Iraq, held a 15-minute meeting with Iraqi ambassador Barazan
al-Tikrit, half-brother of President Saddam Hussein and a presidential
adviser with cabinet rank.
He said Barazan agreed to pass on to Baghdad a renewed appeal that it
accept the resolution and begin negotiations on its implementation --
but so far there was no movement.
Boutros-Ghali said the resolution gave him no flexibility to make
concessions to Iraq, but its implementation would have to be negotiated
with the Iraqi government.
In those negotiations, the total amount of oil to be sold could be
increased.
''I'm limited by the resolution. The resolution is very strict. We can
discuss the quantity. We can discuss certain technical points but I am
limited by the resolution,'' Boutros-Ghali said.
''The quantity of oil can be discussed certainly . . . We can really
obtain from the Security Council an augmentation of the quantity.''
It was not clear if the offer to Iraq of a chance to sell a greater
amount of oil was an attempt to encourage them to accept the resolution.
Boutros-Ghali said the idea was ''not new''.--Reuter.

KAY CARMICHAEL explains how poetry can help people who have suffered
mental illness describe the reality of their lives.
WHEN Tony Blair said that those colleagues who do not share his view
of the world need a therapist, he was reflecting an ancient prejudice.
People who do not think like us, are mad. They need to be ''treated'';
they need to be made like ''us''.
Many attempts have been made to change people who see the world
differently from the majority. These have ranged from immersing them in
cold water, to blasting their brains with electricity or cutting bits
out. Today's methods start with chemical therapy, particularly for the
poor. You can face the awfulness of poverty and hopelessness more easily
if you're filled with tranquillisers -- that is until you find you've
become dependent on them and experience a different kind of hell.
This is not to say that true and intolerable mental distress does not
need help of a skilled and specialist nature. But too often that help is
insensitive and crude. People with widely varying degrees of mental
illness have found themselves more rather than less damaged by the
treatments offered.
Some of these call themselves survivors, by which they mean that they
have survived the mental health system of this country. They are
reclaiming the right to feel and describe the reality of their lives. To
help them do this a series of survivors' poetry workshops is being held
in Glasgow this autumn and two poetry performances are planned.
Professional writers and performers are involved in these workshops
and performances, some of whom say that they too are survivors. These
ventures are being funded jointly by the Glasgow Association for Mental
Health and the Scottish Arts Council.
Scotland pioneered the use of the arts as therapy in Crichton Royal
Hospital in Dumfries in 1832.
In other Scottish mental hospitals, Joyce Laing, the most innovative
art therapist in Britain, has discovered troves of paintings and other
artistic endeavours dating back many years.
Now Dr Francis McGree, who is researching the history of psychiatry in
Scotland, has found another treasure trove of poems written by patients,
many of which were placed in the files as evidence of their madness.
There is a distinguished list of poets who are known to have endured
periods of madness or serious eccentricity. William Blake saw visions
and could be found sitting naked with his wife in their garden and
talking to God.
But the survivors' poetry workshops and performances are not about
therapy, though that can result when people revalue their experiences.
Sometimes a period of mental distress can trigger a hitherto unknown
capacity to write poetry or prose.
An American Glaswegian, Larry Butler, himself a survivor, gave these
capacities a chance to flower. He began the poetry workshops with mental
health survivors. The members are not only writing; they are also
performing.
Their first public reading took place in the Kelvingrove Art Galleries
as part of the Out of Mind, Out of Sight exhibition on the history of
psychiatry in Scotland.
Their words express not only their pain and alienation, but also their
courage and their humour. A Lanarkshire woman, who cannot admit to her
neighbour that she was in a mental hospital because she knows his views
on mad people, speaks for many:
You might pass me in the street
And think, a wee woman with two sticks
And you would never know
Of all that I've been through
A childhood full of trauma
A marriage been and gone
The struggle of three kids to raise
And juggling pennies different ways
The time you spend in there
Has been traumatised once more
And while your children are in care
They're traumatised too . . .
Once out of hospital she still faces many problems:
But my mind is free. YES, FREE!
So when you pass me in the street
A wee woman with two sticks
Is not all you see, you see
As Scots we have had the constant experience of being told that the
natural language of our city streets, small towns and villages is not a
''cultured'' way of speaking.
The majority of people who encounter our mental health institutions
are most at ease in their local tongue but they have to be persuaded
that they won't be ridiculed if they write as they speak.
We need to hear that authentic voice, not only in carefully rhyming
lines but in the rawness of the experience of the homeless, the hostel
dwellers, those who are sent to prison because our mental hospitals
don't want them, the unemployed, the excluded.
The goal for the future is to organise not only poetry workshops,
readings and performances but also music, visual arts, publishing and
recording. All these groups will be led by survivors.
As our world becomes drearier, more debased, we should be valuing more
highly those who can extend our vision of the human spirit and its
resurrection. It was Shakespeare who said that, ''the lunatic, the
lover, and the poet are of imagination all compact''. We need all three.
* Poetry performances will be held at the Centre for Contemporary Arts
in Glasgow at 7.30pm on Saturday first and Saturday, December 9. For

Association for Mental Health, 15-23 Cadogan Street, Glasgow G2 6QQ.

A century ago X-ray technology began to save lives. JOE DONNELLY
celebrates its advances.
WHO knows what is in the hearts of men? A century ago, only God had
that privilege. To an extent, that all changed by accident when on
November 8, 1895, a German physicist working in his lab with cathode-ray
tubes did something that defied belief and changed history.
Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen saw the bones within his wife's hand. Quite by
accident, between a fluorescent tube and a glass container through which
an electrical current was flowing, the X-ray was discovered.
This first glimpse inside the human body, a live human body, and
without catastrophic surgery, laid the foundations for all of today's
diagnostic and therapeutic radiology, and all the scanning which has
become a familiar and vital part of medicine.
Within only days of the discovery, Roentgen had a picture of the bones
in his wife's hand, complete with the opaque shadow of her ring. Doctors
saw the potential immediately.
A few years after Roentgen's discovery, Marie Curie discovered radium
and the new technology made its first huge advance. The radioactive
material played a vital role in the development of radiation oncology
and the use of natural radiation for cancer treatments.
Dentists daily use X-rays to determine root treatment, and despite
administrative breakdowns, X-rays scan thousands of women daily for
breast cancer. They have saved further thousands of lives because of
early detection.
In the seventies, the technology took another major leap forward when
British scientist Godfrey Hounsfield developed a method of getting
internal images in three dimensions.
His Computerised Axial Tomography, or CAT scans involved a whole
series of X-rays taken from various angles and digitally imaged into
slices which could be computerised to show complete internal organs and
bone structures.
The correct interpretation of the CAT images can also save doctors
valuable time when they are dealing with critically injured patients.
The CAT scan development caused the whole human imaging technology to
accelerate. Within years, thousands of hospitals were using Hounsfield's
system and like Roentgen, he won the Nobel prize.
Because X-rays in quantity can be harmful, however, and because axial
tomography, while a huge advance on two-dimensional imaging, cannot give
really clear pictures of soft tissues, the next stage had to be MRI
scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging, which was proposed within a few
years of the CAT scans and finally developed in 1980.
MRI uses powerful magnets to exploit an electromagnetic phenomenon.
Hydrogen atoms line up in identifiable patterns in a magnetic field and
when subjected to radio waves, they send back a signal which can be
picked up, identified and used to build a sharp image of the body's
interior.
The great advantage is that magnetic resonance imaging allows doctors,
particularly neurologists, to study very soft tissues, such as nerves
and brain matter.
MRI scan has the further advantage that different parts of the body
can be clearly identified because of the varying amounts of hydrogen
they contain. Since most of the body is made up of water, which is part
hydrogen, nerves, brain, bone and muscle all show up in different
colours, in real-time on screens.
The next stage, taking scanning a huge leap forward, came with the
development of Positron Emission Tomography, the PET scan, which uses
positrons, known by physicists as the opposite of electrons, tiny
antimatter particles.
When positrons encounter electrons, they destroy each other, giving
off rays which can be detected by computer to build up an image. The
system is vital again for neurologists because they can detect
substances caused by cerebral activity, chemicals produced by thought
patterns, showing the actual workings of the human brain.
Radiology is now progressing at an astounding rate with more
developments in the past 15 years than during its 100-year history.
Current trends in nuclear medicine are aimed at stopping an illness
before it starts.
The new era in nuclear medicine is allowing physicians to detect
disease at a cellular level by labelling its smallest molecules -- the
peptides or building blocks, antibodies, or receptors on the cell
surface.
Being able to detect diseases at the molecular level, before they
become full-blown illnesses, means earlier diagnosis and treatment.
For example, radiologists can now inject tracer agents designed to
find individual cancer cells. That makes it possible to find and treat
cancer in its very early stages.
There is another method of scanning, which most mothers these days
will have experienced. Ultrasound, the imaging technique used to get a
picture of an unborn baby is used in maternity units all over the world.
But for Roentgen's discovery, even this method of scanning the inside of
human beings would probably not have been discovered and gone on to save
countless infant lives.

MULTI--millionaire foot-
ball club and newspaper owner David Sullivan plans to launch his own
political party in a challenge to a Labour council.
Mr Sullivan, owner of Birmingham City FC, is ''seriously considering''
putting forward a Birmingham City Party candidate in each of the 39
council wards in Birmingham -- the largest single local authority in the
country.
He confirmed yesterday that he would back at least one candidate and
hoped to have set up the new political party by the New Year.
The move comes after Mr Sullivan revealed plans for a merger between
his first division football club and the city's Moseley rugby club.
He plans to let Moseley play at the St Andrew's football ground and
sell their Reddings ground for development.
Mr Sullivan said the city council's failure to back his investment in
Birmingham City and anticipation of planning problems with the Moseley
merger had forced him to enter the local political arena.
''I think it will put a lot of fun into the local elections and
encourage a much bigger turnout. It would be very good for the community
and society but whether we would win, only time will tell,'' he said.
Mr Sullivan said: ''We are so fed up with the lack of support from the
council. We would attract Labour voters and smash a huge hole in the
Labour vote in Birmingham.''
He added: ''I believe I could do just as good a job as the council.''
Mr Sullivan, who lives in Essex, would not say if he himself would
stand for election.
Birmingham Labour council's leader, Ms Theresa Stewart, said: ''If he
is going to campaign on the very narrow programme of Birmingham City,
then I think he is unlikely to get much support. If he broadens his
programme to include the issues that people are concerned about, like
schools, libraries, and roads, I would be interested in seeing how he
gets on.''
The Conservative group leader, Ms Anne Underwood, said: ''I would be
surprised if he was being serious but good luck to him if he wants to
have a go.''

As the NUM president founds a new organisation, Herald writers look at
his future and past.
ARTHUR Scargill has seldom seen eye to eye for long with any of the
several political parties he has dallied with since joining the Young
Communist League as a teenage collier. It is not surprising then that he
should be seeking to set up his own.
He claims to have written first to the Labour Party and that he turned
to the YCL after Labour ignored his advances.
Young Arthur went on to serve on the YCL executive for a while but
after about six years fell out with the Communist Party apparently
because he was unhappy with the party's disciplined approach and because
he deduced that membership might hinder his plans to win power and
influence within the National Union of Mineworkers.
After a brief sojourn in the Co-operative Party, Mr Scargill
eventually joined the Labour Party in the mid sixties, soon after Labour
returned to Government under Mr Harold Wilson.
This deft switch of allegiance was to prove crucial in his bid to lead
the NUM, for while Scargill was steadily challenging to unseat
Scotland's Mr Mick McGahey as the left's presidential candidate to
succeed Mr Joe Gormley, the wily right-winger deliberately stayed on
until Mr McGahey was barred from standing on age grounds.
Mr Gormley mistakenly felt that the younger Scargill would mellow with
the job and prove more adaptable than the hard-bitten Communist McGahey.
His handling of the bitter year-long pit strike of 1984-5, especially
his refusal to ballot NUM members and condemn violence by some pickets,
brought Mr Scargill into conflict with Labour leader Neil Kinnock. The
two fell out spectacularly on television and at Labour Party conferences
and relations deteriorated from then on.
His abrasive style and uncanny knack of raising awkward issues, and
doing it well, similarly brought the fiery Yorkshireman into conflict
with the TUC and subsequent Labour leadership teams headed by the late
Mr John Smith and particularly Mr Tony Blair's current team of
modernisers.
Scargill epitomizes everything that the modernisers want to get away
from as they pursue their arms-length relationship with the unions which
they maintain is essential if Labour is to triumph at the forthcoming
General Election.
However, in the run-up to the election, he had already been isolated
and been rendered virtually harmless by a combination of plummeting
membership -- the NUM has dwindled from some 200,000 to below 10,000
since its defeat the 84-5 strike -- and desertion by former allies
desperate not to rock Labour's election boat.
His latest and possibly last effective act of defiance was at Labour's
special conference in April, where he made a good but vain case for
retaining the controversial Clause 4 demands for wholesale
nationalisation.
Clause 4 was ditched by a resounding 2-1 vote but, undeterred, Mr
Scargill went to law claiming that in using a special conference Labour
was breaching its own rules. He subsequently won an out-of-court
agreement allowing him to raise the issue at the October annual
conference.
That was to be his undoing, however, for despite his best efforts he
saw the Blair camp's revised Clause 4 endorsed by a massive 9-1 as even
Unison and the Transport and General Workers Union were won over to the
futility of refighting old battles especially with an election around
the corner.
His few allies included the Rail, Maritime, and Transport union and
the locodrivers' union Aslef, both of whom could hardly be expected to
agree a softer line on privatisation at a time when their industry is
actually in the process of being privatised.
It was in the wake of that crushing defeat and the humiliation of
coming a poor last in his latest abortive bid to get on the party
national executive, that Scargill threatened to quit Labour and the
seeds of his proposed new Socialist Labour Party were sown.
Although there have been some mutterings among trade union leaders
about Labour distancing itself from the unions, they still see the
return of a Labour Government as the overriding priority.
None has even hinted at seeking to disaffiliate their unions out of
Labour and indeed it is most unlikely that Scargill could even carry the
depleted NUM with him should he seek to do so.
Meanwhile, many see Scargill's standing as so low that his association
with a proposed new Socialist Labour Party might just ensure that it
never gets off the ground in any meaningful way.
Certainly, Labour leaders will shed no tears if Mr Scargill does quit
the party. It seems that even his days as a bogey man foil for the
leader are over.

MAY Day next year has been set as the launch date for a new Socialist
Labour Party, which miners' leader Arthur Scargill believes has become
both vital and inevitable because of the drift to the right of Labour
under the leadership of Tony Blair.
The case he put to a meeting in London last weekend was contained in a
discussion paper entitled Future Strategy for the Left, looking at the
consequences of the scrapping of Clause 4 and moves at last month's
Labour conference to concentrate power in the hands of the leadership.
He claimed the commitment to common ownership dated back long before
the drafting of the clause in 1918 to the beliefs of trade unions and
socialist groupings which pre-dated the party itself. Early affiliates
had included the Communist Party, as well as the Co-operative movement
and trade unions.
Early ''modernisers'' re-fashioned the party as a ''broad church,''
not to accommodate the left, but to allow in non-socialists, he argued.
These same forces then expelled the Communist Party from affiliation
and over the years attempted to weaken the trade union link, to the
point where ''we have seen the current party leadership systematically
dismantle Labour's commitment to socialism -- a process in which the
spin doctors merely put a media gloss on the machinations of the
leadership''.
Nobody should have been surprised by the announcement by Mr Blair a
year ago of his intention, in defiance of a conference vote, to scrap
Clause 4. ''Here was a party leader blatantly acting contrary to the
constitution -- an offence which has been used to expel numerous good
party members,'' he said.
''Yet many leading left figures in the Parliamentary Labour Party and
in the trade unions failed to see the implications of what was taking
place,'' wrote Mr Scargill, adding: ''They believe it is still possible
to reverse the 'setbacks' suffered as a result of Blair's destruction of
Clause 4 and abandonment of fundamental socialist policies.''
Organisational changes have seen the introduction of one member-one
vote, the reduction of the trade union block vote, the drafting of new
rules and the replacement of the commitment to public ownership with the
acceptance of the free market.
On nationalisation, the minimum wage, unemployment, health, education,
Europe, nuclear arms and anti-trade union laws, Labour was no longer a
socialist party, he said.
''Labour is now almost indistinguishable from the Democratic Party in
the United States, Germany's Social Democratic Party or, nearer home,
the Liberal Democrats.''
He called Labour's new rules ''an unmitigated disaster'' which will
make it impossible for members to campaign for socialism, and will give
the leadership a mechanism to submit endless blocking amendments to
prevent future change.
''Today we have a sanitised Labour Party which Blair has admitted
should be called Social Democratic,'' he claims. ''Socialists faced with
this new situation must decide what to do. Do we meekly accept New
Labour? Do we passively concede that the party has abandoned socialism
and any commitment to common ownership?''
Why, he asks, did Labour supporters bother to fight the Gang of Four
who founded the SDP? ''Do we, and others who feel as we do, stay in a
party which has been and is being 'politically cleansed'?
''Or do we leave and start to build a Socialist Labour Party that
represents the principles, values, hopes, and dreams which gave birth
nearly a century ago to what has, sadly, now become New Labour?''
He said some highly respected comrades would insist people should stay
in the party and fight, but this failed to recognise constitional
changes barring such action. Others would argue that nothing should
jeopardise the efforts to beat the Tories, but this argument had been
used for almost a century.
Socialists now face the same dilemma as forebears who broke with the
Liberals. ''If history was to repeat itself, nobody could be genuinely
surprised,'' he said. ''Can we continue to exist -- let alone try to be
active -- within such a party? I believe the case for such a Socialist
Labour Party is now overwhelming.''
He argued that the SLP should be class-based, with a simple
constitution and structure. This, he claimed, in an imaginative
suggestion for a hard left grouping, would end ''internal wranglings and
sectarian arguments.''
It should be set up with:
* A discussion meeting to draft a party constitution and structure,
ensuring that members and affiliates had control over the leadership.
* A launch on May Day next year, as a day with international
significance for the Labour movement.
* A commitment to fight every Parliamentary seat in Britain.
''We do not have the luxury of time,'' he wrote. ''Sooner rather than
later a Socialist Labour Party will be born.''
He added: ''We therefore have to decide if we are prepared to carry on
supporting a Labour Party which now embraces capitalism and the 'free
market' or take a decisive step towards establishing a party capable of
not only resisting capitalism's attacks but of fundamentally changing
society -- in other words, establish a Socialist Labour Party.''

DISILLUSION with the political process among young people has become
accepted as a frightening truism by those in the traditional parties, as
they lament the fact and look at ways of winning back the missing youth.
The success of the green movement is both a signal of what has gone
wrong with conventional party politics today and an indicator of what
might be, and this is reflected in Arthur Scargill's blueprint for a new
party of the left.
''Today,'' he writes, ''radical opposition in Britain is symbolised
not by the Labour and trade union movement but by the groupings such as
those which defeated the poll tax, the anti-motorway and animal rights
bodies, Greenpeace and other anti-nuclear campaigners, and those
fighting against opencast mining.''
While the latter might reflect his own interests in the mining
industry, there is no doubt that he has a point in the way that other
single-issue campaigns have succeeded in energising young people in a
way which the normal divides of left and right have not.
He clearly hopes to strike a chord with young voters that it has been
the actions of these pressure groups that have been successful in
changing unpopular decisions by Government and large multi-national
corporations rather than conventional party politics.
The poll tax was defeated because a mass campaign of non-payment,
against Labour Party policy, made it unworkable. Brent Spar is not now
lying on the bed of the Atlantic because Greenpeace activists occupied
it.
And while anti-motorway protests may not have prevented the laying of
a single yard of tarmac, they have forced a much more widespread debate
on a whole range of issues which might otherwise have gone unexplored.
The Labour Party would beg to differ, having poured money over the
last two years into building its new Young Labour wing, which,
significantly, took over from the Young Socialists, who were effectively
closed down as a perceived political embarrassment to the leadership.
The Conservatives have dug an even deeper pit for themselves, running
down their student and youth wings but not committing the resources to
putting anything else in its place.
Meanwhile, young people are attracted instead to specific issues
rather than broad politics.
A youngster may choose to become a vegetarian; refuse to pay the poll
tax; fight against social injustice through a poverty or homelessness
group; resist a motorway being built through woodland; campaign against
live animals being transported or foxes being hunted; oppose nuclear
weapons or power; fight against water privatisation; struggle against
racism and sexism; become involved in gay rights; or become involved in
the abortion debate.
Often individual young people are involved in several of these issues
at once and no party card fits all the bills. The concept of such a
''rainbow coalition'' emerged as an idea in US politics some years ago,
but the expected translation into Democratic Party activism failed to
materialise.
As Britain's mainstream political parties converge on a consensual or
even conservative view on many issues, the idea is that a genuinely
radical alternative stance would win support among naturally radical
young people.
It is also widely accepted that proportional representation -- planned
for a Scottish parliament, mooted for Westminster -- gives smaller, more
radical parties a chance of election, and therefore makes it more
logical and perhaps even more honest to stand as an individual party
rather than as merely a grouping within a larger party.
The Scargill document -- in referring to poll tax, anti-roads and
other environmental issues -- comes very close to being a blueprint for
an existing model. Scottish Militant Labour already has made these
struggles its chosen battleground.
Since breaking cover three years ago and becoming an open political
party in its own right -- as opposed to being a Trotskyite grouping
advancing by entering the Labour Party clandestinely -- SML has had some
limited electoral success and has forged its own identity.

FIVE Greenpeace protesters were fined yesterday for breach of the
peace while campaigning against the planned dumping of the Brent Spar by
Shell earlier this year.
The five, one Englishman and four Germans, had admitted taking part in
a demonstration involving the sea tug Smit Singapore before it was due
to leave Aberdeen Harbour in June to help tow the redundant oil
installation to its dumping site in the Atlantic.
Two divers were spotted late at night in the water near the tug by a
crew member who called police when he saw they had flotation buoys.
Meanwhile, the three other protesters boarded the tug. One of them
chained himself to the bottom of the 50ft mast while his colleagues
scaled it and chained themselves above deck level.
Depute-fiscal Andrew Grant told the court that it was later discovered
a rope had been tied around one of the tug's propellers and the buoys
had been chained around the metal gangway.
The divers -- Germans, Oliver Sommer, 28, and Arnd Petry, 25 -- were
each fined #75 by Sheriff Alexander Pollock. The other Germans, Heike
Staudigl, 27, and Thomas Prax, 33, and Englishman James Sanlino, 37,
were each fined #50.
The protesters were described by their lawyer, Mr Tony Longino, as
students who ''felt they had a moral obligation to intervene and
pressurise against the action of the multi-national company concerned.''
He added: ''The accused believed the plan to dump the Brent Spar would
damage the environment.''
They had been excused from attending the hearing at Aberdeen Sheriff
Court yesterday when not guilty pleas from seven other campaigners were
accepted by the court.
Mr Longino emphasised it had been a peaceful protest which had not
resulted in any damage to the vessel.

<HEADLINE>Michael Jackson in harmony with Sony after #65m music merger</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

MICHAEL Jackson is thought to have received around #65m in a deal
merging his music publishing company with that of his record label Sony.
The deal creates one of the world's biggest publishing companies.
Representatives of both Jackson and the label will sit on the board of
the new venture, Sony/ATV Publishing.
Among the songs which Jackson has the rights to are more than 250
Beatles hits, and some of Elvis Presley's back catalogue.
Jackson was said to have paid #30m -- outbidding Paul McCartney -- for
the rights to the Beatles songs a decade ago.
Last night, the former Beatle received one of Britain's highest
musical accolades when he became the first pop artiste to be made a
Fellow of the in London -- for distinguished services to music.
Jackson's deal with Sony follows hard on the heels of searing
criticism by McCartney and the two other remaining Beatles, who claimed
he was ''cheapening'' their work by allowing some songs to be used in TV
commercials.
George Harrison was quoted as saying: ''Unless we do something about
it, every Beatles song is going to end up advertising bras and pork
pies.''
McCartney alleged Jackson, with whom he recorded two singles in the
1980s, had ''cheapened'' the songs released.
Jackson's multi-million pound deal fuelled speculation that two years
of law suits and falling sales have left the star strapped for cash.
Details about his personal fortune are notoriously difficult to obtain
but it has been estimated at #600m. His wife Lisa-Marie is a
multi-millionairess in her own right, having inherited #135m from her
father, Elvis Presley.
It is not known how badly the repercussions of child-abuse allegations
made in 1993 by 13-year-old Jordan Chandler have impacted on the Jackson
bank balance.
Jackson called off a world tour at a cost of #5.2m after the
allegations, and lost a #10m sponsorship deal with Pepsi-Cola.
However, his comeback album, HIStory -- recorded and produced at a
cost of #30m with another #20m spent on promotion -- failed to repeat
his earlier triumphs.
Despite selling 300,000 copies in its first week on sale in the UK and
800,000 in three weeks in the US, HIStory quickly tumbled down the
charts, and has so far achieved eight million sales worldwide.
That compares with 45 million copies of Thriller -- which is the
best-selling LP yet and earned him #100m -- 25 million sales of Bad, 20
million of Dangerous, and 15 million of Off The Wall.
Now it is being rumoured that Lisa-Marie is considering a divorce, and
a pay-off of up to #15m.
Music business finance expert Cliff Dane said the details of the Sony
deal would have to be studied before it could be decided whether Jackson
had got a good price.
He said: ''I would value the publishing rights of the Beatles songs
alone at between #150m to #200m. If Jackson had sold them outright for
#65m it would have been a very low sum.''
In London, more than 300 guests attended the Royal College of Music
ceremony, led by the Prince of Wales, president of the college, in its
concert hall.
McCartney, accompanied by wife Linda, wore the gold-trimmed gown to
which he is now entitled.
As he left the college, he said he appreciated an honour which he
never dreamed of receiving.
''For a scruff from Liverpool, it isn't too bad!''
He said of reports that he had been trying to learn musical notation
now he was writing classical-style music: ''I've decided it's too late
for that now.''

<HEADLINE>Scotland's 'shameful export'. Youngsters heading south in vain bid to find a place to stay</HEADLINE>

AN increasing proportion of young Scots who seek the bright lights of
London are going there to find a place to live, according to a new
report.
The Shelter campaign for the homeless says this is a glaring
indictment of housing provision in Scotland. Ms Kate Caskie, depute
director of Shelter Scotland, said: ''This is a powerful report which
demands action. How much longer must the fruitless trek south continue
before action is taken here in Scotland to help these young people?
''We hear a lot about exports from the Scottish economy. This report
reveals the most shameful export: that of disadvantaged young Scots on
to the streets of London.''
The survey, When The Bright Lights Go Out, was conducted by Shelter
Scotland and the Church of Scotland's Borderline project, which provides
help for young homeless Scots in London, and covered about 100 young
people in the winter of 1994-95. Results were compared with those of a
similar study five years ago.
The latest research shows that young Scots still go to London in the
hope of finding work but almost a third of those surveyed said they had
gone looking for somewhere to stay, a reason cited by a negligible
proportion in the 1990 study.
The report says the increasing gap between rich and poor, attacks on
benefits, and low wages combined to form ''a cocktail which increases
homelessness'', and urges the development of policies directed at the
overall problems as well as specific initiatives, in Scotland and in
London.
It says there is very little evidence that the effects of changes in
one policy area on other policy areas were taken into account and that,
in particular, reduction in wage protection and continued benefit cuts
had had a disastrous effect.
The survey found that the profile of young homeless Scots in London
was similar to that found in the earlier research. Seven out of eight
young homeless in the study were male, more than half came from Glasgow
or an adjacent district, only one in 10 had stayed on at school beyond
16 or had qualifications above Standard Grade, and half had been in
local authority care as children.
Borderline director Dennys Campbell said: ''We are concerned about the
number of care-leavers making their way to London. There has to be a
comprehensive advice and information package targeted at this vulnerable
group to make them aware of the realities of living in London and
adequately prepare them for any such move.''
He urged that the Returning Home Initiative -- a project linking
Shelter, Borderline, and other advice agencies in London with some
Scottish local authorities -- be revitalised and extended.
At the annual meeting of Borderline in London tonight, speakers will
include Mr John McAllion, Labour's Scottish housing spokesman.
Yesterday, he blamed Government policy for the fact that young Scots
were going to London to seek accommodation.
He said: ''It is an accumulation of the results of a number of
different Government policies which, inevitably, has produced this
exodus of youngsters finding there is no place for them here and
thinking they can find a place in London.''
Scottish Office Housing Minister Raymond Robertson said he was
concerned about young Scots who became homeless in London and about
young people leaving care. Legislation had been introduced to give local
authorities new powers to provide aftercare for these people, up to age
21.
Mr Robertson added that many causes of homelessness were outside
Scottish Office control, for example family disputes.
''Nevertheless, we can and do support efforts to tackle homelessness
when it occurs.''
Local housing authorities had received about #29m in extra capital
allocation for homelessness projects from 1991 to 1994, and more than
#400,000 had been provided to voluntary bodies this year.

THE HCI independent hospital in Clydebank has recruited a new chief
executive from one of its principal rivals, BUPA Hospitals Ltd.
Mr Mike Hall, 41, has been responsible for the 29 BUPA hospitals in
the UK and one in Ireland, with an overall annual turnover of #250m.
HCI has been without a chief executive since Mr Jim Wiczai stood down
when the original HCI company went into receivership a year ago.
Mr Hall said he was looking forward to joining HCI, ''a world-class
facility with a very promising future''.
The announcement of Mr Hall's appointment follows the signing of a
major contract with an Algerian social insurance agency last week,
thought to be worth #3m and expected to bring in 250 patients over the
next year.
However, a BBC Scotland Frontline documentary tonight is expected to
question the hospital's viability, even following its acquisition by the
Abu Dhabi Investment Company.

THE sex offenders' treatment programme at Peterhead Prison received
favourable comment from Mr Clive Fairweather, Chief Inspector of Prisons
for Scotland, yesterday.
Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Fairweather said he had looked at the
programme while inspecting the prison and ''left with some hope it is
probably worth doing and continuing''.
''Over all, I think it is probably worth pursuing,'' he added.
He said he could not say the prisoners taking part would not offend
again but all had wanted to take part in the course and all had been
changed in some way.
He reached the conclusion there had to be a national strategy for sex
offenders in prisons.
The Peterhead programme, which runs for a year and began three years
ago, caters for 200.
A report on the programme has been made to the Secretary of State for
Scotland and is expected to be published in a few months' time.
Mr Fairweather was speaking during a lecture on child sexual abusers
given to the Scottish branch of the Howard League for Penal Reform by
Professor Lorraine Waterhouse, head of the social work department at
Edinburgh University.
Prof Waterhouse carried out a study on abusers for the Scottish Office
which was published recently.

A MOTOR cycling magazine is offering readers a year's free
subscription if they are caught speeding at more than 140mph, it was
revealed yesterday.
Traffic police and road-safety campaigners branded Streetfighter
magazine ''horrific and irresponsible''.
However, Mr Steven Myatt, chairman of Manchester-based publishers
Myatt McFarlane, defended the idea, claiming: ''The people who read this
magazine want to drive at 140mph. We are not encouraging it.''
The December issue of the monthly publication offers a free
three-month subscription to bikers trapped at 100-120mph, six months to
those caught between 120mph and 140mph, and free copies for a year to
those charged at more than 140mph.
Mr Myatt, also a keen motor cyclist, added: ''I do not see anything
wrong with speeding, because limits are largely advisory.''
Police said anything which glamorised speed was extremely
irresponsible.
Superintendant Alistair McLuckie, of Strathclyde Police traffic
department, added: ''This is the most despicable piece of journalism I
have ever read.''
He added: ''Any publication which purports to be sensible should be
working towards the general goal of improving road safety.''
* Earlier this year in Strathclyde, a motorcyclist was fined #700,
banned for a year and ordered to resit his test after being caught
driving at 155mph.

FEARS are growing for the safety of a Scottish woman and her Canadian
boyfriend who set off to sail round the world but have not been heard of
for the past 10 weeks.
A coastguard official at the marine search and rescue co-ordination
centre in Falmouth for all inquiries outside north-west Europe, has
expressed fears that the couple may have died in a severe storm.
Ms Sarah Heald and Mr Dave Ostlere, both 34, set off from Fionnphort
in Mull in their 28ft yacht, Mugwump, in August and called at southern
Ireland before heading for the Portuguese island of Madeira on August
31. The voyage was expected to take three weeks.
Coastguard officials were alerted last month when Ms Heald's mother,
Heather, who runs the Bruach Mhor Guest House in Fionnphort, expressed
concern that she had not heard from her daughter or her partner since
they left Ireland.
Mrs Heald said yesterday: ''We are very worried. We just hope they
have been blown off course and are unable to contact us, and that they
are safe and well.''
Mr Ostlere's sister has flown to Madeira to try to trace the couple
who spent the past year preparing their yacht for the ''voyage of a
lifetime''. They had lived in Fionnphort, on and off, for several years
and spent much of the summer there.
Mr Tony Andrews, district controller at HM Coastguard, Falmouth, said
yesterday that coastguard officials learned of the couple's trip only
six weeks after they left southern Ireland.
He said checks made since, over a two-week period in Madeira, the
Canaries, ports in France, and mainland Portugal and Spain, had failed
to trace the couple or their yacht.
Radio broadcasts to shipping in the area also had been unsuccessful in
contacting them, he said. The search has now been stood down.
The coastguard official said a severe storm passed through the area of
the Atlantic where the couple were scheduled to cross on September 6 and
7.
Mr Andrews added: ''Our suspicions are that this may have caused
problems to the Mugwump and that the couple may have perished. No-one
has seen the vessel or heard from it and no wreckage has been sited.''
It is understood the couple had not planned their route beyond Madeira
although it is believed they intended to cross the Atlantic after
visiting the island.
Ms Heald had said before setting off that the couple hoped to pay for
their voyage by doing casual work in various ports and possibly by
writing articles about their experiences of the trip.
The couple met in Australia while travelling several years ago. Mr
Ostlere, a chef, returned to Scotland with his girlfriend.

Larnaca
A COURT trying three British soldiers accused of killing a Danish
woman today admitted as evidence bloodstains on their clothes and car.
It rejected defence contentions that the arrest of the three, and the
way the evidence was discovered, were unlawful because police did not
read the soldiers their rights when their car was stopped at a
roadblock.
The three-judge court ruled that the arresting police officer was
entitled to detain the soldiers in September 1994 during a general alert
for three men in a car who had kidnapped tour guide Louise Jensen, 25.
Presiding Judge Takis Eliades said the arresting officer ''had every
right to stop and arrest the accused on the valid suspicion they had
committed a flagrant crime''.
The court rejected a defence claim that the police had no right to
arrest the soldiers when they refused to produce identity papers after
being stopped at the roadblock.
The three soldiers -- Privates Alan Ford, 27, of Birmingham, Justin
Fowler, 27, of Falmouth, Cornwall, and Jeff Parnell, 25, of Oldbury,
west Midlands -- all have pleaded innocent to charges of manslaughter,
kidnapping and conspiracy to rape.--AP.

A SPECTACULAR #2.7m National Rivers Centre beside the Clyde was given
the go-ahead last night. The #2.7m centre could create up to 170 jobs
and attract more than 100,000 tourists in its first year.
The Scottish Wildlife Trust -- which is behind the scheme -- says the
centre, near Larkhall, Lanarkshire, will be the first of its kind in the
UK and will attract even greater numbers of visitors in successive
years.
Hamilton District Council gave the plans the green light up last night
and councillor James Daisley, chairman of the development advice
committee, said: ''I think it is a marvellous opportunity and will
enhance the whole Clyde Valley. It will constitute a substantial
investment in Lanarkshire and there are potential major benefits to the
district.''
He said he hoped objections to the scheme by Scottish Natural Heritage
and Strathclyde Regional Council, who say the plan contravenes Green
Belt policy, could be overcome by negotiation.
Visitors to the 12-acre site will follow the course of a river through
the complex and watch it wind along a Scottish landscape. They will
encounter different wildlife, sites and sounds -- even some pollution --
on the way.
The trust hope the scheme will qualify for a #1m slice of Lottery cash
from the Millennium Commission. Lanarkshire Development Agency and the
European Regional Development Agency will also contribute.
Project architect John Finlay said: ''It is a very exciting project
for all involved. We are really hoping it will herald a new start for
visitors' centres and educational projects in Scotland.''
Mr David Wilson, western regional officer for the Scottish Wildlife
Trust, said: ''We are delighted that we have been given permission for
this very exciting project and by the encouraging words of the
council.''
The centre is to be constructed on stilts -- in case of flooding.

STRATHCLYDE'S Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, pledged
yesterday there would be ''no junkets'' to mark the demise of the
regional council next April.
Councillors questioned details of a report in The Herald yesterday of
plans for a possible #500,000 spending on various commemorative events
and projects. ''If there is to be a final fling, could opposition groups
be consulted first,'' asked Liberal Democrat leader, Dr Christopher
Mason.
Councillor Gould said the final expenditure throughout the region
could be #500,000 or even #1m, but added: ''There will be no junkets. We
would certainly want to look at possible ways and means of recognising
the council's service to the community. We would want to consult all
parties, and would be pleased to have their suggestions.''
A confidential report outlining the commemorative initiatives,
including the establishment of a #250,000 trust to fund an annual award
for public service, caused deep divisions at a private meeting of the
ruling Labour group.
Sources indicated that some members ''went ballistic'' over the
spending proposals, which they considered grotesquely ill-advised when
the council had been struggling to sustain essential services in the
face of Government cutbacks.
Suggestions submitted by officials included preparation of a final
report, including anecdotes from councillors and officials, at a cost of
between #20/#25,000, and commemorative events throughout the region.
A Scottish Office spokesman commented: ''At a time when resources are
tight, it is bizarre that taxpayers' money should be used in this way.''

DEAR, dear. Fergus McCann upset, Rangers miffed, the League
dismissive, and Pat Lally somewhere up in the higher reaches of dudgeon.
Channel Four's controversial documentary, Football, Faith, and Flutes
can't be all bad.
Of course, it is an old and well-established fact that sectarianism
plays no part in Old Firm rivalry. Those chants conveying all best
wishes to the Pope and the Queen are just a bit of fun.
As for those featured ''in a drunken state'' in the Wark Clements
production due for transmission on Saturday, they are clearly, as Mr
McCann has pointed out, no part of the mainstream. Another old and
well-established fact of Scottish football is that no fan ever touches a
drop.
Strictly as a service to readers, however, your Diarist thought it
best to sneak a look at the film in hopes of discovering what all the
fuss was about. Can it be true that Mr McCann's ''social institution
promoting health, well-being and social integration'' has been
caricatured, like its counterpart at Ibrox? Well, one gentlemen in a
striking blue ensemble bearing the motto ''McEwan's'' (believed to be a
reference to a popular vitamin supplement) does offer the philosophical
insight, ''I'd prefer to have 11 great players that were Protestants
playing for the blue jersey. It's tradition.''
Another, stylish in green and white leisurewear, avers that both clubs
are faith-specific businesses, adding (and perhaps provoking Mr McCann
somewhat): ''I don't think Fergus McCann or whoever was in charge would
sign a lot of Protestants.''
There follows some shaky theology (''Hing um! He is Satan! The Pope is
Satan as far as ah'm concerned!'') interspersed with scenes in what
appear to be gentlemen's clubs, where there is much singing of songs to
do with being off to Dublin and the correct wearing of sashes, and where
no-one at all is in any way intoxicated.
Experienced observers of the football scene will, it goes without
saying, recognise none of this -- hence the refusal of Rangers and
Celtic even to believe it exists.
PS: All this publicity came as a complete surprise to Channel Four's
press office, of course. This must be why they placed a strict embargo
on coverage that expired, purely coincidentally, just exactly at the
time Mr McCann was due to explode.
The real Scotland
JILL CRAWSHAW can say what she likes -- we at the Diary know that the
Scottish tourist industry continues to flourish and grow, with new and
tasteful ideas shooting down the pipeline even as we write.
Take Highland Mysteryworld, described by the Scottish Tourist Board as
''a new development for 1996 which claims to break the mould of typical
visitor attractions''. Just which mould they have in mind isn't entirely
clear, since this development on the shores of Loch Leven is billed as
featuring delights such as ''the Astromyth Theatre'', hosted by no less
than the Brahan Seer himself.
Then there's the ''Roots of Rannoch, a sensory exploration of the
ancient forest''; the ''Clootie Well, the magical, mossy home of the Wee
Folk''; the Viking Foodship; and (but of course) the Mysteryworld Mall
taking ''care of your souvenir shopping list''.
It is not for us to pre-judge this latest contribution to Scottish
culture. We note only that Highland Mysteryworld is sub-titled ''A
Journey Beyond Belief''.
Occasional
mouthpiece
TERRIFIC news from Keir Hardie House, where the Scottish Labour Party
has at last found itself a press officer acceptable to London in this
new age of Christian family values, Union flags, Trident, and funny
substances never knowingly inhaled.
The lucky lad is one Angus Macleod, a recruit believed to have at
least one link with newspapers, though not, perhaps, of the appropriate
party. Mr Macleod is down to work on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.
So who's praying the General Election isn't held on a Thursday, then?
Labour link?
(Do not quote this story.  This article is subject to legal action.   RBJ
13/11/95)
TALKING of Labour -- and we talk of little else -- mutterings from the
other parties come our way over alleged connections between the People's
Party and the BBC in Scotland.
Who, we are asked rhetorically, is giving secret media training to
Labour people? Is Tim Luckhurst, ''Editor News Programmes'', the same
Tim Luckhurst who was once a researcher for Donald Dewar? Is Angus
Peetz, appointed by Luckhurst to run Reporting Scotland's Edinburgh
operation, not the very man who worked for George Foulkes MP? And by the
way, was the position now occupied by Mr Peetz ever advertised?
Below base line
TASTEFUL, tasteful, tasteful. Yes, we're talking about the music
industry, where good taste is ever the arbiter, or so we deduce from an
advertisement for Migration, a new album by one Nitin Sawhney.
''Have you ever been attacked by an Asian?'' inquires the droll
headline. Then, in altogether smaller type, ''(musically that is . .
.)''.
This was almost as witty and clever, we felt, as the spread for B&amp;W
loudspeakers featuring a large picture of Elvis Presley, who is believed
to be dead.
''Eighteen years after being laid to rest in a box, he's brought back
to life in two,'' it says. Unlike the copy, no?
A century down
the road
LITTLE known fact of the week: next year is the motor car's 100th
birthday, or so the industry would have you believe as it prepares to
celebrate a century of environmental devastation, horrific road
accidents, and revolting string-backed gloves.
The Buick company of Flint, Michigan, is first on the case, offering
special models in a largely pathetic attempt to tie the centenary
celebrations to the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympic Games. But
in a breathless press release exploring this dubious proposition, the
firm also delves into its roots.
Not a lot of people know this, as the saying has it, but the
automotive giant was in fact founded by a man from Arbroath, one David
Dunbar Buick, in 1903. In the finest traditions of Scottish
entrepreneurship, however, he ceded the company to William C ''Billy''
Durant in the space of a year, thus paving the way for General Motors.
There's a plaque in Arbroath, apparently, recording the boy's
flirtation with fame. On reflection, though, it's probably as well he
didn't hang on longer. After all, what might the world have made of the
Buick Smokie?
* FINALLY, just remember: if you're out when Jehovah's Witnesses call,
it isn't the end of the world.

A MAJOR crackdown on drivers in West Lothian is to begin tomorrow in
an attempt to tackle one of the worst accident rates in Scotland.
It will involve additional police patrols from Lothian and Borders
police, operating on a 24-hour basis, stopping and spot-checking drivers
from the outskirts of Edinburgh to the Lanarkshire boundary.
West Lothian is bucking the national trend on accident rates and is
the worst area in the Lothian and Borders area, with one in 10 drivers
breathalysed proving positive.
Thirteen people have died in road accidents this year, compared to
nine in 1994, although branch traffic commander Superintendent Jim Pryde
said yesterday he could offer no explanation as to why the area should
have such a poor record in its accident statistics.
He said: ''The accident scene is not only the worst in the force area
but is proving to be one of the grimmest in Scotland.''
The campaign, which precedes the Scottish Office Christmas and New
Year campaign with advice on drink driving, will run until next year.
Mr Pryde warned: ''West Lothian is one of the worst areas in Britain
and we are starting a hard-hitting police operation.''
Asked why the area should be faring worse than others, he replied:
''We do not know why.''
He suggested that the higher accident rate may be caused by the growth
in the population and an increase in the number of people travelling
into the area.
He said police would be having talks with the licensed trade, taxi
drivers, and health boards in the area in an effort to emphasise the
importance of driving safety.
The Government launched a campaign aimed at reducing accidents
throughout Britain's roads but Mr Pryde said casualty figures in the
area showed no respite, standing at 9% over the 1994 figure.
Operating under the codename Trawl -- tactics to reduce accidents in
West Lothian -- he said the drinking driver featured significantly in
accidents and drugs were also known to have an influence.

A SCOTTISH NHS Trust whose chief executive resigned in the wake of a
cash crisis, has appointed a replacement on a part-time, temporary
basis.
Mr Howard Waldner, Dundee Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust's deputy chief
executive, will take over the running of the Highland Communities NHS
Trust after the shock departure of Mr St John Hattersley earlier this
week.
Mr Waldner is there only until the cash-strapped trust can find a
replacement for the chief executive, a fact that has not been lost on
Unison's spokesman, Mr Ken MacMillan.
He said: ''This man apparently has a background in personnel, which
will obviously be helpful in the current climate of job insecurity.
''It will take time and effort to get this trust on an even keel but I
am not convinced that a temporary chief executive on a three-day week
will find it that easy.''
He added: ''As a union, we are willing to co-operate with anyone as
long as they have the right attitude.''
Dundee Teaching Hospitals has agreed to free Mr Waldner for three days
a week to take over the Highland trust's day to day responsibilities.
Mr Hattersley resigned from his #57,000 a year job on Monday after it
became clear that a no-confidence ballot of more than 2000 trust staff
was going against him.
The new appointment comes as the trust attempts to offset a budget
shortfall of #1.8m.
There were plans to cut 80 nursing and health workers jobs and close
two wards for elderly patients in two of the trust's 17 hospitals as
part of a cost-cutting exercise.
However, it is hoped that will not now be necessary and a new recovery
plan is being negotiated.
The Highland Communities NHS Trust sacked its finance director
Alistair Christie in August. He had previously been suspended after
allegations of sexual harrassment of two female office staff.
During his suspension, it was revealed that he had failed to claim #1m
worth of cash due to the trust from Highland Health Board. Auditors
later discovered a further budget shortfall of #800,000.

TWO brothers who raided the home of Scottish businessman James Miller
were jailed yesterday.
Peter Marshall, 27, was sentenced to three years imprisonment at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court and his brother Pat, 25, was sentenced to two
years.
A jury found them guilty of breaking into Mr Miller's home in the
Murrayfield area of Edinburgh on July 10 and stealing watches,
jewellery, and other items, valued at #6000.
Mr Miller, head of the Miller Group construction empire, told the jury
he helped to chase an intruder in the grounds of his home.
He said he and his wife, Iris, had been getting ready to go out in the
evening when they realised that someone was in their house.
The Marshalls denied the housebreaking charge. Peter Marshallalso
denied resisting arrest two days later and making threats to an officer.
He was convicted of both those charges.
Depute-fiscal Margaret Graham said each of the brothers had previous
convictions for housebreaking.

<HEADLINE>Curbs on pollution from vehicles would be toughest in the world. UK set for hard line on killer exhausts</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975470882</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN looks set to take a world lead in curbing levels of pollution
from motor vehicles.
The Government is considering tough action to tackle particulates --
tiny specks of dust -- which are said to kill up to 10,000 people in
Britain a year.
It is to adopt the strict standard for particulate concentration in
the atmosphere recommended by two committees of experts as a
''benchmark'' for policy and could include it as a target in the new Air
Quality Strategy being prepared under the Environment Act.
A standard of 50 micrograms of particulates per cubic metre of air
over a 24-hour period would be the toughest limit in the world -- three
times stricter than in the US.
The move was welcomed by the AA, anti-pollution campaigners, and the
British Lung Foundation.
The experts said there was strong evidence that particulates could
worsen the condition of people with respiratory and heart disease -- in
some cases causing premature death. However, there was no evidence that
healthy individuals were at risk.
Particulates are produced from a variety of sources but most
significantly by motor vehicles and fossil-fueled power stations. Diesel
exhausts are the biggest single source, producing 49,000 tonnes of the
particles each year.
A press briefing at the Department of Environment heard that up to 80
billion particles were breathed in by Britons every day.
Professor Stephen Holgate, chairman of the Committee on the Medical
Effects of Air Pollutants, said: ''Evidence gathered from a range of
well-conducted epidemiological studies in the United States and Europe
really does indicate that there are notable health risks associated with
particles in the concentrations that are encountered in the environment.
''Overall it is suggested from our studies and our review of the
literature that the particle air pollutant aggravates on-going acute
events, namely chest infections, asthma, and ischaemic heart disease.''
Professor Anthony Seaton, chairman of the other committee involved --
the Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) -- said it had been
known since the 1950s that particulates could be hazardous.
However, he added: ''What was a surprise was that the evidence
suggests even at the very much lower levels in Britain nowadays, health
effects are detectable.''
Friends of the Earth has calculated that, based on American figures,
about 10,000 people die each year in Britain as a result of breathing
particulates.
Details of Government action to reduce vehicle emissions in urban
areas are due to be outlined in its Air Quality Strategy and could
include new powers for local authorities.
Local traffic management measures might include steps to direct
traffic away from pollution blackspots and to control the speed, volume,
and type of traffic using particular routes.
The Government said it would also play an active part in pressing for
a Europe-wide, cost-effective package of vehicle and fuel standards.
The AA said it would be happy with lower pollution levels as long as
they were realistic. ''We could live with a figure of 50 microgrammes,''
said a spokesman.
While welcoming any improvement in pollution standards, the RAC said
much could be done under existing regulations to crack down on gross
polluters.
''You don't need new standards to stop the black-smoke-belching
vehicles that still drive around,'' said RAC head of public policy, Mr
Jeremy Vanke.
''The particulate problem is not just down to diesels. However,
diesels, while giving off few carbon dioxide fumes, are much worse for
particulates.''
Mr Tim Brown, a spokesman for the National Society for Clean Air,
said: ''We would welcome any toughening of standards but the Government
must realise that even a low level of particulates represents a serious
risk to health.''
Dr Malcolm Green, president of the British Lung Foundation, said: ''It
is good news that the Government is considering a tough standard to
protect the nation's health. It is vital that the quality of our air
improves.''
* LEVELS of air pollution in Scotland are said to be lower than
elsewhere in the UK but exceed recommended standards during winter
periods.
Scottish Office Environment Minister, Lord Lindsay, said the
Government regarded this as unacceptable and would continue to promote
measures to reduce levels of pollutants.

WESTERN Isles MP Calum Macdonald last night called on community-owned
crofting estates to form a united front and press the Government for the
#2m worth of assistance they have been willing to give private estate
owners.
Speaking on the eve of the Scottish Crofters Union annual conference
which opens in Newtonmore this afternoon, Mr Macdonald said he had
written to representatives of the three community estates in the
Highlands -- Assynt, Stornoway, and Borve.
He had pointed out that the Scottish Landowners Federation, which
vociferously lobbies for and represents large private owners, had
managed to win a tax concession worth #2m a year when the Government was
persuaded last year to abolish rates on sporting estates.
''If the Government can afford a tax giveaway of #2m per annum to
private landowners, why can't they invest a similar sum each year in the
community estates?''
Mr Macdonald said it was important to build on the growing support for
community land ownership in the Highlands: ''An important factor in this
will be if the existing community-owned estates can get together and
form a united lobby, both to encourage other communities to take the
same step and to press the relevant authorities -- the Scottish Office,
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Scottish Natural Heritage, etc -- to
provide political, practical, and financial support.
''What is needed is a Community Land Association to counter and rival
the private Landowners Federation, and to ensure that the united voice
of the community owned estates is heard clearly in the corridors of
power.''
* BENBECULA crofter Neil MacPherson has been chosen as Crofter of the
Year and will receive his award and a cheque for #500 at the Scottish
Crofters Union annual dinner in Newtonmore tonight.
The award is organised jointly by the SCU and the Royal Bank of
Scotland. It looks for good standards of husbandry, good management and
development of the croft, diversification, and community involvement.
It was in this last area, according to the SCU statement, that Mr
MacPherson drew ahead of the seven other contenders: ''He is a committee
member of the local marketing group, organising the pens at sales; he is
a board member and assistant grader of Uist Calf Producers; he is
vice-president of South Uist and Benbecula Agricultural Society; he is
on the local SCU branch committee; he is township clerk.
''Neil is always in great demand in his locality for fencing and
shearing, and dips most of the township's sheep, as well as flocks
outside the township. He is often approached for advice and assistance
on all aspects of crofting and always is ready to help.''

<TEXT>
A POLICEMAN yesterday told how he came face-to-face with a man armed
with a double-barrelled sawn-off shotgun.
Another witness earlier told the High Court in Edinburgh that the man
was known as Hawk.
Constable Neil Stewart, 29, said the gun was pointed at him and added:
''I was looking down the barrels of it.''
Minutes earlier, the officer had become upset and clutched his head in
the witness box as he gave evidence at the trial of Mr Brian Martin.
Trial judge Lord Gill adjourned the court briefly before Mr Stewart
resumed giving evidence.
The court heard that police had gone to the Craigie Bar, in Ballingry,
Fife, on Saturday, October 29 last year after receiving information that
Mr Martin, wanted for interview, was in the pub.
Mr Martin, 38, described as a prisoner, denies a series of armed
robberies and assaulting police officers by presenting a shotgun at
them.
Mr Stewart said he was stationed outside the pub in Ballingry with
another officer, Constable John Hughes, while an inspector and a
sergeant went into the bar for Mr Martin.
Mr Stewart said that after the senior officers entered the pub there
was ''a commotion''. Through the windows he could see people getting to
their feet and running.
Martin emerged from the pub with two women behind him. He began to run
but lost his footing and staggered.
Mr Hughes shouted at him to stop but Mr Martin spun round to face him
and his long leather jacket opened to reveal a shotgun. The weapon,
which was attached to a piece of string looped over his shoulder, swung
up, said Mr Stewart.
He added: ''He cradled the barrels of the gun with his left hand and
put his other hand on the trigger. He shouted at me: 'Back off. F***ing
back off or I will shoot you'.''
Mr Stewart said he was about 3ft away and put his hands up: ''I
shouted to him it was OK, it was OK. Go.''
Mr Martin ran off and Mr Stewart radioed a warning to colleagues
before chasing him but the fleeing man escaped in the darkness.
Mr Stewart said that, following the incident, he suffered shock and
was off work for 51 days.
The court earlier heard farm contractor Mr Thomas Connelly, 50,
describe an armed raid at his then home in Fife on September 25, 1992,
involving four masked men.
He said his wife had come into the office at Bankson Cottages,
Glencraig, where his business was based, and let out a scream.
Two men appeared, one armed with a sawn-off shotgun and the other with
a knife. The gun was put at Mr Connelly's back and he and his
brother-in-law Brian McHale were directed to the office.
Mr Connelly, an agricultural contractor, said he had collected wages
for employees from a bank in Lochgelly that day.
Inside the office, he found his wife Janette being forced to her
knees. Wages clerk Jessie Herd was tied to a chair as was a family
friend, Ms Mary Dow.
The man who he believed was the leader of the gang was screaming:
''Where is the money? Where is the money?'' They were told it was in the
car in the yard and one of them went outside and got a bag containing
#8500. They then fled.
Mr Connelly was asked if he was able to recognise any of the robbers
despite them being masked and replied: ''Yes. Brian Martin.''
He said that Mr Martin had been beside filing cabinets in the office.
''He never moved. He never spoke.''
Mr Connelly said he had known Mr Martin since he left school and had
once employed him. He added that his height and stoop were distinctive.
Defence counsel Rita Rae QC questioned Mr Connelly over his
identification of Mr Martin and asked if he had mentioned it to his
wife. He said: ''I probably said to her that was Hawk standing in the
corner.''
He added that Mr Martin had always been known to him as Hawk. Mr
Connelly conceded under cross-examination that he could be wrong about
his identification of Mr Martin.
Mrs Connelly, 38, told the court Mr Martin was in her sister's class
at school. She said she recognised one of the four men as Mr Martin and
identified him in court.
Mr Martin also denies assaulting and robbing Joseph Campbell and
Catherine Campbell of #2000 on November 6 last year in Fife and
assaulting and robbing staff at a branch of the Yorkshire Building
Society in Oban on November 24 last year of #4639.
The trial continues.

A MAN who pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide was
jailed yesterday for four years at the High Court in Glasgow.
The court heard that William McLean had lost control the night he met
Mr Richard Edment, 42, believing that he had indecently assaulted a
little girl he knew.
McLean, 30, confronted Mr Edment -- who was with his wife and two
children -- in the Market Place, Carluke, Lanarkshire, on July 21. He
shouted ''Beast!'' and punched Mr Edment on the stomach and kicked him
on the neck when he fell.
Mr William Dunlop, prosecuting, said Mr Edment's wife Isabella tried
to help him while their children Isobel and Scott, both l2, ran for
help. Mr Edment died within minutes.
McLean, of Miller Street, Carluke, admitted killing Mr Edment of
Honeybank Crescent, Carluke, with one punch and one kick.
Mr Dunlop said a post- mortem examination showed no mark on the
deceased but the cause of death was a blow of up to moderate force to
the neck which had caused bleeding in the skull.
When McLean heard Mr Edment had died, he had gone to the police and
told them: ''I didn't want this to happen to him.''
Judge Lord MacLean said he accepted the accused had not meant to kill
the man and had since shown contrition and remorse. However, because of
his action, a man had died and children had lost their father.
As he jailed McLean, a woman in the public benches sobbed: ''He didn't
touch the wee girl. There's no evidence.''
Mr Dunlop said that, several weeks earlier, it had been alleged that
Mr Edment went into a six-year-old girl's bedroom and indecently touched
her. Police investigated and sent a report to the procurator fiscal.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, said the tragedy happened the first
time McLean saw the deceased since hearing of the incident with the
little girl.
The kick to the side of Mr Edment's neck had landed on the most
vulnerable part. There was no great force in the kick and if it had
landed a little way from this particular spot it would not have resulted
in death.
Mr Findlay added that McLean's contrition and remorse were genuine.

GLASGOW architects Cooper Cromar yesterday were named as the winners
of the competition to design housing for a pivotal site in the
redevelopment of the city's Gorbals area.
The development, to be built by Scottish Homes and a private
developer, is on land owned by Glasgow Development Agency around McNeill
Street and between Ballater Street and the River Clyde.
Of 169 applications, 60 entries were submitted and the short leet of
six, comprising four from Glasgow practices and two from London, was
judged by a panel including GDA chief executive Stuart Gulliver, Glasgow
city planning chief Michael Hayes, Mr Raymond Young of Scottish Homes,
and Ms Chris Ramsden of Gorbals Umbrella Group, representing residents.
The Cooper Cromar plan has 124 houses and a number of nautical
details. Its north entrance from a footbridge over the river will be
marked by an imposing archway.

FOUR new Acts consolidating Scottish criminal law procedure for the
first time since 1975 were given the Royal Assent yesterday.
Together they tidy up a raft of separate legislation and amendments
introduced over the last 20 years.
They fit alongside the new Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act, which
includes measures due to be implemented next year on tightening up
access to bail, increasing consistency in sentencing and improving
efficiency of the courts, saving unnecessary attendance by police and
other witnesses.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said: ''The
consolidation has simplified the presentation of the legislation, making
it easier to use and access. This will be welcome to all those who use
the criminal courts.''
The four new pieces of legislation are: The Criminal Procedure
(Scotland) Act, The Criminal Law Consolidation (Scotland) Act, The
Criminal Procedure Consequential Provisions (Scotland) Act, and The
Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act.
Lord James said the effect of the measures on confiscation would be to
curb drug traffickers and deprive ''lifestyle'' criminals of their
profits from crime.
''Unless these offenders can prove otherwise, all their assets will be
assumed to come from crime and a confiscation order for their value can
be made. Crime must not and will not pay,'' he added.
* THE Statute Law (Repeals) Act also become law yesterday, wiping out
nearly 500 outdated and useless acts and statutory provisions. It
implements recommendations earlier this year by the Law Commissions of
Scotland and England.
Gone now is the power dating from 1698 to try governors of plantations
and colonies for their crimes in England and away too are a number of
obsolete enactments by local authorities in Glasgow, Warwickshire, and
Nottinghmanshire.
A total of 4300 pieces of legislation have been removed over the last
30 years, prompting Mr Justice Brooke, chairman of the English Law
Commission to remark: ''The task is a bit like painting the Forth
Bridge. If ever we finished it, there would be plenty of new candidates
which would have sprung up in the place of those we have cut down.''

THOUSANDS of epilepsy sufferers may have been put at risk or had their
driving licences suspended because of attempts to put them on to cheaper
medicines.
A survey has shown that nearly one in three patients switched to
different versions of the same drug have suffered increased side effects
and potentially ''catastrophic'' seizures, the British Epilepsy
Association said yesterday.
The problems were found to occur after switches from ''generic'' to
brand medicines as well as the other way round, indicating that the
problems arose from the change itself rather than the merits of one drug
over another. Nevertheless, the findings are likely to renew controversy
over substituting brand-name medicines with cheaper generic
alternatives.
Doctors who have substituted one drug for another without seeking the
patient's informed consent could face legal action.
The study involved 1343 people with epilepsy among 40 general
practices in Yorkshire, all of whom took one or more of the three most
widely used drugs -- carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and phenytoin.
A total of 251 had been switched between different brands in the past
two years and, of these, 74 (29.5%) had reported ill effects. Problems
included increased side effects, more frequent seizures, and sudden
''breakthrough'' fits following a seizure-free period.
Dr Pamela Crawford, consultant neurologist at Bootham Park Hospital,
York, who led the research, said epilepsy medication had to be dosed
very carefully.
This was necessary to achieve blood levels high enough to control
seizures effectively but not so high that they caused unacceptable side
effects.
British Epilepsy Association spokesman Sue Blake said: ''It has been
fairly common for doctors to switch drugs like this. They are saving
money but the drugs themselves are not uniform.''
Dr Rod Duncan, a consultant neurologist and epilepsy expert at
Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, said: ''Switching drugs can be a
problem, especially with phenytoin. The point is not whether you use one
or the other but in maintaining consistency in the rate at which the
drug is taken up.
''It might be all right if you are using the same generic drug all the
time but I have had to write in the past to pharmacists who were
dispensing one generic one week and another one the next.''

FOOTBALL fans splashed out #225,000 at a sale of soccer memorabilia in
Glasgow yesterday, booting previous auction records into touch.
The sale, the largest of its kind in the UK, had been expected by
auctioneers Christie's to fetch around #100,000 but the total was
swelled by fierce bidding for caps and medals belonging to players whose
careers span almost the entire history of the professional game.
Most prominent of the contemporary names was former Rangers, Spurs,
and England defender Graham Roberts. International medals, caps, and
jerseys belonging to the player, including Scottish Championship, UEFA
Cup, and FA Cup winners' medals, fetched #16,094.
Lisbon Lion Jimmy Johnstone sold three medals, including the Scottish
Cup medal he won in 1972 when Celtic beat Hibernian 6-1, which fetched
#1950.
The buyer, Celtic director William Haughey, is to display the
collection in a museum planned for the redeveloped Celtic Park. They
will be shown alongside more than 20 items associated with Johnstone's
fellow Lion, Tommy Gemmell, including his European Cup winners' medal,
which Mr Haughey bought at a similar auction last year.
The most expensive item was the Sheriff of London Shield, bought for
#29,900 by a telephone bidder. The trophy, 5ft tall and made of silver,
copper, and oak, was a forerunner to the English FA Charity Shield. It
was shared by Queen's Park and Aston Villa in 1899, the only time a
Scottish side appeared in the final, and was displayed in the People's
Palace in Glasgow that year.
Also sold, for more than #8000, was a collection of caps, shirts, and
medals belonging to 1950s Hearts star Ian Crawford.

IN a series of major legal changes announced yesterday, Lord Rodger of
Earlsferry QC, the Lord Advocate, was appointed a judge to succeed Lord
Allanbridge, who retired last week.
Lord Rodger's elevation at the age of 51 means the promotion to Lord
Advocate of the current Solicitor-General, Mr Donald Mackay, QC, after
just six months in the number two post. Mr Mackay, 49, also received a
life peerage to enable him to represent the Government in the Lords.
The new Solicitor-General will be the advocate, Mr Paul Cullen, 38,
who was appointed a Queen's Counsel yesterday immediately before the
official announcement of the new appointments.
Officially, judges in Scotland are appointed by the Queen acting on
the advice of Government Ministers but, in effect, the Lord Advocate,
head of the prosecution system, can nominate himself to the High Court
and Court of Session Bench.
Although Lord Rodger's outstanding ability as a lawyer is beyond
question, his promotion will call the whole judicial appointments system
into question.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth expressed his confidence in the new
Crown Office team yesterday when he said: ''Donald Mackay will make a
first-class Lord Advocate and Paul Cullen's experience as an
Advocate-depute will equip him well for the task of Solicitor-General.
''I am sure they will make a very effective team as Scotland's Law
Officers.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson acknowledged that Lord
Rodger had been a ''quite outstanding'' Lord Advocate and would make a
first-class judge.
However, he added that the appointment could be said to look like
''jobs for the boys''.
He said: ''It leaves a bad taste in the mouth because nobody knows
what the criterion for appointments is. We are currently looking at ways
that are more open and more accountable.''
Labour is considering whether a better system would be to set up a
Ministry of Justice for Scotland, with judicial posts being advertised
and candidates scrutinised by a judicial appointments board.
Lord Rodger, who became Lord Advocate in April 1992, comes from an
academic background and is one of the country's most respected academic
lawyers. His father was professor of psychological medicine at Glasgow
University from 1948 until 1973.
Lord Rodger himself was educated at Kelvinside Academy and read arts
and law at Glasgow University.
In 1970, he was appointed to a fellowship in law at New College,
Oxford, and seemed set for an academic career as a Roman Law scholar. To
the surprise of his colleagues, he resigned his fellowship in 1972 and
became a member of the Faculty of Advocates two years later.
He spent three years as Solicitor-General from 1989 when Lord Fraser
of Carmyllie was Lord Advocate.
He was elected to the Fellowship of the British Academy in 1991 and in
June this year Glasgow University conferred on him the honorary degree
of Doctor of Laws.
As Lord Advocate, he presided over a number of important changes in
the criminal justice system, including the introduction of the right of
the prosecution to appeal against sentences it thinks are too soft.
Recently, Lord Rodger appeared in person at the Court of Criminal
Appeal to argue that sentences of four years imposed for a brutal
assault outside a Glasgow night club were too lenient. After watching a
security video of the incident, the appeal judges agreed and increased
the sentences to seven years.
He also has had to defend the prosecution system against persistent
claims of Government underfunding.
In 1993, in an article written for The Herald, Lord Rodger said:
''Doubtless in an ideal world we would all like more resources but
taxpayers have a right to expect that all the existing money is spent as
efficiently as possible before they are asked to pay more for the
prosecution of crime.
''That means first creating the conditions in which the prosecution
system can work more efficiently.''
With that in mind, the Crown Office has been conducting a wide-ranging
review of the criminal justice system. One of the aims has been to cut
down the amount of time wasted by police and civilian witnesses waiting
to give evidence in cases which do not go ahead.
Lord Rodger pointed out that in 1992, 80.5% of summary cases set down
for trial on a given day did not proceed to trial.
* Lord Rodger was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1974 and
became a QC in 1985. He was an Advocate-depute between 1985 and 1988,
Solicitor-General for Scotland from 1988 to 1992 and has been Lord
Advocate since then.
He was the last undergraduate at Glasgow University to obtain a double
first in Scots law and Civil law.
Lord Rodger is held in high regard as an international jurist and is
believed to be the only British law officer to have taken part in
proceedings before the International Court of Justice, the European
Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, and the European
Commission of Human Rights.
* Donald Sage Mackay, a son of the manse, was educated at George
Watson's College, before graduating from the Universities of Edinburgh
and Virginia. He qualified as a solicitor in 1971 and practised for five
years.
Married with a son and two daughters, Mr Mackay was called to the
Scottish Bar in 1976, prosecuted as an Advocate-depute from 1982 to 1985
and was appointed Solicitor-General for Scotland in May this year. He
was also a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board from 1989
to 1995.
Mr Mackay, the brother of BBC journalist Alan Mackay, appeared at the
Orkney sex abuse inquiry and attacked press reports which described the
hearing as a ''gravy train'' for lawyers.
* At 38, Paul Benedict Cullen, is one of the youngest men to become
Solicitor-General. The son of a surgeon, Mr Cullen was educated at St
Augustine's High School in Edinburgh and graduated with an honours law
degree from Edinburgh University.
Mr Cullen was called to the Scottish Bar in 1982 after serving his
legal apprenticeship by devilling under Mr Alan Rodger QC, as he then
was.
He served as an Advocate-depute from 1992 to 1994 and prosecuted in
the case of Alastair Thompson, jailed for a minimum of 20 years for
murdering a homosexual man in Dundee then dumping parts of his body in
bin bags.
Mr Cullen is married to a solicitor and has three children.

<HEADLINE>Trident dispute is new boost for Rosyth. MoD turns on Devonport docks plan</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAIN WILSON, CHIEF REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

PRESSURE mounted on the Government yesterday to make another
embarrassing U-turn and reverse its decision that an English rather than
Scottish dockyard should carry out Trident submarine refit contracts.
Ministry of Defence officials are now recommending that plans to
modernise Devonport dockyard to meet nuclear safety requirements for
refits, should not be handled by DML, the private company which runs the
Plymouth yard.
The officials, furious that upgrading could cost as much as #500m over
five years -- compared with DML's original #236m quote -- argue that the
MoD should now complete the work itself.
But if that happens, the Government would probably have to cancel
plans to privatise the yard -- yet another severe political
embarrassment.
The latest crisis is an important boost for Rosyth dockyard in Fife,
whose bid to repair the nuclear missile submarines was just #10m higher
than Devonport's original bid. Rosyth, therefore, would now look a much
better option.
However, Herald readers will not be surprised that Rosyth is back in
the frame for the work, which is worth more than #5000m.
An exclusive report in April revealed Devonport could not obtain a
safety licence from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, while the
Fife yard, run by Babcock Thorn, was on target to meet requirements.
It was disclosed that the limestone and slate rock structure beneath
Devonport posed major problems for a dry dock which would have to be
able to withstand a small earthquake to fufil regulations.
The Government subsequently admitted in May that safety standards
meant existing docks had to be strengthened. It also conceded that at
least two nuclear hunter-killer submarines would require to be refitted
at Rosyth -- a report originally dismissed as ''utter nonsense'' by the
MoD.
Rosyth has faced being relegated to surface warship refits since the
massive outcry two years ago when the Government announced all nuclear
repair work in Fife was being axed, despite 30 years' experience.
However, the Scottish yard has fitted seismic arrester blocks -- giant
shock absorbers -- at its proposed Trident drydock, which is built on
solid bedrock.
The MoD recommendations give Defence Secretary Michael Portillo a
serious dilemma. Either he presses ahead with the decision to privatise
Devonport which his own officials cannot justify, or pulls back which
would be politically damaging.
The dilemma is compounded by a General Election due within 18 months
because the south-west of England is important for the Conservative
Party which faces a strong Liberal Democrat challenge there. Uncertainty
is such that a decision has been put back until next week.
Scottish Chambers of Commerce, which has more than 8000 members, added
to the pressure yesterday. It called on the Government to reverse its
decision to give the work to DML.
The chambers' acting director general, Mr Peter Dunn, did not mince
words -- describing the events leading to the Devonport award as a
fiasco, with ''purely political'' motives which made ''no economic or
strategic sense''.
He said the award went to the so-called lowest bidder despite repeated
pleas for the financial implications to be reviewed, and added: ''A
change of decision to bring it north makes sense in light of the
economic and technical difficulties facing Devonport. No other
alternative should be considered.''
There have been suggestions that Britain could have the Trident fleet
refitted in the United States after 1999.
Trade unions described the latest embarrassments as ''an utter fiasco,
with Ministerial and managerial mismanagement on a grand scale in what
has now become the modern Navy Lark.''
MoD industrial trades union chairman Jack Dromey said: ''It is
Ministers who must now shoulder the blame for disarray and a financial
scandal.''
SNP spokesman Colin Campbell said the full costs of the ''blatant
political decision'' to transfer work from Rosyth to Devonport were
becoming apparent, and added: ''The whole sorry saga simply underlines
the anti-Scottish bias of the Tories and indeed the Union.''
An MoD spokesman said: ''We are in lengthy and detailed negotiations
with DML on the contract. There is no change to the decision to locate
and build new nuclear refit facilities at Devonport.''

MONKLANDS District Council ''drove the proverbial horse and cart
through every possible tenet of good industrial relations'' when it
dismissed a painter, an industrial tribunal ruled yesterday.
The Glasgow tribunal said that Mr Michael Mitchell, of Coatbridge, had
been sacked unfairly and ordered the council to give him his job back by
December 1 and pay him #7790 compensation.
In their findings, the tribunal said the council's conduct at a
meeting leading to Mr Mitchell's dismissal was ''little short of
disgraceful''.
It was ''rather courageous'' of the council's solicitor, Mrs Marina
Dempsie, to attempt to argue that the council had acted reasonably, the
tribunal said. ''It seemed to us that they were consumed with an
indecent haste to push the applicant out the door.''
The ruling is the second time in the past 18 months that the council
has fallen foul of an industrial tribunal.
Mr Mitchell, 31, of Lavelle Drive, Coatbridge, was sacked by the
council last March for incapacity due to ill health after he was off
sick with unstable blood pressure.
The tribunal heard that he did not have a good attendance record. He
was off for four months between September last year and January, then
again for a further week in January/February.
The council obtained a medical report which showed he was suffering
from unstable blood pressure. His medication had been changed several
times but he still was not able to return to work.
Another doctor examined him on behalf of the council. He concluded
that Mr Mitchell was definitely at risk at heights and if there was no
ground level painting work he was unfit through incapacity. The report
did not indicate if the condition was temporary or permanent or how long
it could be expected to last.
The council claimed officials contacted other departments to see if
there were any other vacancies for Mr Mitchell before he was dismissed.
None was considered suitable.
However, the tribunal heard that there were posts he could at least
have been interviewed for as concierge, litter picker,
gardener/labourer, and cleaner/caretaker.
Mrs Karen Ashe, a personnel officer who was involved in the meetings,
admitted she knew about these vacancies but did not draw them to the
attention of Mr Mitchell or his superior, Mr Patrick McNeilly, assistant
building services manager.
The tribunal heard that the council had a policy of redeployment
wherever possible. At the time of Mr Mitchell's dismissal, there were 10
or 11 painters who did ground work and did not have to climb ladders.
Before he was dismissed, Mr Mitchell's representative asked Mr
McNeilly to consider him for concierge vacancies in the housing
department but Mr McNeily failed to do so.
A request to continue the meeting for further investigation into a
possible date for Mr Mitchell's return to work and to consider him for
other vacancies was also refused.
In their findings, the tribunal said the inquiry into his medical
condition was far from adequate. The council had no information about
how long the condition was likely to last, whether there had been any
recent improvement or deterioration, and had no information on what
other jobs Mr Mitchell could or could not do.
The tribunal ordered reinstatement despite Mr McNeilly's claims that
it was really not practical to employ a painter whose ability to climb
ladders was in doubt.
Mr Mitchell declined to comment until he had spoken to his union
representative.
A council spokesman said last night that all interested parties would
discuss the tribunal's findings next week.

A DRIVER who knocked down a woman on a remote country road bundled her
into his car boot because he thought she was dead, it was claimed
yesterday.
Mrs Donna Hayes, a waitress, said she was knocked unconscious as she
walked to her job at a Suffolk public house and woke up in pitch
darkness in the boot.
She banged on the lid to attract attention and claimed that when the
motorist opened it he told her: ''I thought I had killed you so I put
you in there.''
Mrs Hayes, a mother of three, said: ''He was shocked. He didn't say
what he intended to do with me after the accident. I imagine he
panicked.''
Suffolk police confirmed they had questioned a 28-year-old man in
connection with the incident. He was released on bail pending further
inquiries.
Mrs Hayes, of Wangford, near Beccles, Suffolk, needed hospital
treatment for a dislocated shoulder and a blow on the head.
The incident took place last month. The details have only just
emerged.
She is reported as saying she ''thought it was a practical joke''.
She said: ''I cannot remember being hit. I had no panic, no fear and
at the time I didn't feel any pain. I was dazed and thought I was
dreaming.''
She said the motorist agreed to drive her home and as she drifted in
and out of consciousness in the passenger seat of his Vauxhall Chevette
she noticed the windscreen was shattered.
''I asked him if I did that and he said 'Yes','' Mrs Hayes told the
Eastern Daily Press.

A BBC TV documentary last night claimed Scottish landowners are
receiving millions of pounds of public cash in ''money-for-nothing''
deals with a Government agency.
The Labour Party joined the row by attacking the ''secrecy''
surrounding payments made by Scottish Natural Heritage in compensation
for profits lost on estates designated Sites of Special Scientific
Interest.
BBC1's Here and Now programme, shown at 7.30pm last night, stated that
by the turn of the century #100m will have been paid out to British
landowners by SNH and its southern counterpart, English Nature.
It heard claims that the system was being ''worked'' by the landed to
milk off extra cash.
Sir William Wilkinson, former chairman of the Nature Conservancy
Council, called for the system to be made fully publicly accountable.
Here and Now highlighted cases including Mr John Grant, laird of
Rothiemurchus Estate, near Aviemore, who received #230,000 not to fell
trees on his land, and also gets #70,000 a year not to increase fishing.
A spokesman for Rothiemurchus Estate said: ''BBC programme-makers have
failed to understand that public money is used to protect sensitive
areas like the Cairngorms, whether or not they are in private
ownership.''
An SNH spokeswoman said only 15% of payments were made to prevent land
use pressures on SSSI land. The remaining 85% was spent on positive land
improvements.
However, Labour's Scottish Environment Spokeswoman, Ms Helen Liddell,
said: ''Secrecy is not in the best interests of anyone, particularly
when public money is involved.''
Former Tory MP Lord Kimball, laird of Altnaharra Estate in Sutherland
until 1992, admitted working the system. He said: ''It was an
opportunity not to be missed.''

A SCOTS MP has accused Government departments of a cover-up over the
controversial gas pipeline being laid near the Beauforts Dyke munitions
dump.
The strongest attack yet by Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock
and Doon Valley, comes after it emerged that the Ministry of Defence was
unhappy with the route of the pipeline and made its views known to the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Health and Safety Executive.
Despite the reservations of the MoD, the route was approved with only
minor alterations. In recent weeks evidence has emerged that the
pipelaying work has contributed to the washing ashore of thousands of
phosphorous sticks.
The Ministry of Defence was reluctant to discuss in detail its
observations, but a spokeswoman confirmed that officials made certain
information available during the consultation period and that changes in
the route were advised.
She added: ''We made information available on the Beauforts Dyke
dumping ground and what was dumped there and made certain comments to
the DTI and Health and Safety Executive. Certain changes were made to
the original plan and we were not involved further.''
The DTI confirmed that other departments had been consulted but would
give no details of what had been put forwards by individual departments.
Mr Foulkes, who last night repeated his demands for immediate
cessation of commercial activities in the area at a public meeting in
Dumfries, reacted angrily to the disclosure of the MoD reservations.
He said: ''I am furious that despite various meetings in recent weeks
with Ministers at different levels in many departments my colleagues and
I were never informed that there had been what the Ministry of Defence
calls ''certain comments' made about the route of the British Gas
pipeline.
''The MoD was the department best informed about what lies in the area
and if they were not happy with the route then it should never have gone
ahead. It amounts to a cover up if information of this importance is not
made available.''

TWO doctors who carried out a life-saving operation using a
coathanger, a bottle of mineral water, and a roll of tape were honoured
at an awards ceremony in London yesterday.
Professor Angus Wallace and Dr Tom Wong saved the life of a passenger
on a flight from Hong Kong to London.
At the Radar (Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation)
People of the Year ceremony at the Hilton Hotel, Professor Wallace said
he had received a letter from Health Minister Gerry Malone jokingly
asking if the technique could be adapted for use in the NHS as a
cost-cutting measure.
Professor Wallace, of Nottingham University, said he had also had
discussions with British Airways to improve medical provisions on board
planes.
Also at the ceremony was Mr Jim Ballard, husband of Everest heroine
Alison Hargreaves.
He was collecting a Person of the Year award from the Princess Royal
on behalf of his late wife.
Mr Ballard, of Fort William, refused to comment on reports that the
couple were on the verge of divorce before her death.
1 He said: ''I will not comment on these reports but nothing I read in
the newspapers surprises me anymore.
''Nothing can detract from the fact that Alison is getting this award.
I'm very proud.''

THE GMB union will today challenge the Government in the High Court in
a move which it hopes will see Board of Trade President Ian Lang in the
dock to answer charges of backsliding over worker representation.
The union is seeking leave for a judicial review aimed at forcing the
Government to comply with European Court rulings over the rights of
workers' representatives to be consulted over planned redundancies or
sell-offs.
General secretary John Edmonds said yesterday that the Government was
trying to get away from its obligations by introducing a ''watered-down
cop-out''.
''They cannot be allowed to ignore the European Court and must stop
their 'take their bat and ball home' approach. Laws are laws and must be
obeyed,'' he said, adding that the fact that Mr Lang did not like it was
''neither here nor there''.
''He must comply and our action will ensure he is forced to do so.''
The European Court ruled in June 1994 that the UK was not implementing
the 1977 Acquired Rights and 1975 Collective Redundancies Directives.

THE Crown Office has rejected a fresh appeal from Libya to the
families of the victims of the 1988 bombing of PanAm Flight 103 over
Lockerbie to back a League of Arab States proposal to try two Libyan
suspects in The Hague.
In a quarter-page advertisement in yesterday's editions of the
Washington Post, Libya urged the families to pressure their governments
to accept the proposal for ''a fair trial of the two suspects by
Scottish judges, under Scottish law, at the seat of the International
Court of Justice in The Hague.''
The appeal was welcomed by Dr Jim Swire of the UK relatives group,
which has always supported the idea of a trial in a neutral country or
The Hague.
Dr Swire, whose daughter died in the incident, said: ''This piece of
advertising is in line with our position. The British and American
governments maintain that the Libyans are only bluffing but we would
argue, go ahead set up a trial and call their bluff.''
The advert also claimed President Clinton had confirmed the two
suspects could not get a fair trial by calling the two men criminals in
his speech at Arlington Cemetery.

A COUPLE have started prison sentences over a plot to cover up their
son's role in a fatal hit-and-run crash in which a mother-of-two died.
David Hawker, 49, a former stockbroker, and his wife Maureen, 50, told
police their car had been stolen during a shopping trip.
Their student son had abandoned it at the crash scene and hid in a
hedge for four hours to avoid police.
Jeffrey Hawker, 23, was given a three-and-a-half year prison sentence
after admitting causing death by dangerous driving. He was also banned
from driving for five years.
His father was jailed for nine months for conspiracy to pervert the
course of justice and his mother for three months.
Father and son were thought to be beginning their sentences together
in Norwich prison, while the mother was in Bulwood Hall, Essex.
Ipswich Crown Court had been told that Jeffrey Hawker, a student at
the University of East Anglia, had apparently fallen asleep while
driving his father's car on near Thwaite, Suffolk in June last year.
Hawker's car veered across the road, causing another driver to swerve,
before running head-on into the car of 44-year-old Patricia Johnson, and
her husband Michael, of Dereham, Norfolk.
Mrs Johnson, who was asleep in the passenger seat, died. Her husband
was seriously injured.
The next morning Hawker went home to Bexleyheath, Kent, where the plot
was hatched to conceal his involvement. Later he had a row with his
father and gave himself up.
The court heard his parents had told police their car had been stolen
on the day of the accident during a shopping trip to Norwich. Both
signed statements to that effect.
Defence barristers claimed they had not known anyone had been killed
when they decided to protect their son.

AN INDIAN surgeon working at Ayr Hospital has avoided a deportation
order because of a national shortage of urologists.
Mr Chandra Balachandran had originally received a letter from the Home
Office telling him to leave the country as his work permit had been
denied by the Department of Employment, following the completion of his
post-graduate training.
He arrived in Britain in 1990 as a student with his wife Ajitha,
daughter Yakshmi, 17, and son Gautham, 15, both pupils at Kyle Academy
in Ayr where the family lives.
In 1993 he took up a post at Ballochmyle Hospital, Mauchline, and
started his present job as a staff grade urologist at Ayr Hospital in
March 1994.
Mr Balachandran, 44, said yesterday: ''I was absolutely shocked when I
received the letter from the Home Office, particularly because it stated
that I had no right to appeal against the decision.
''My wife and children were upset too, as they had settled very well
into our new home in Ayr and were very happy here. Our children are at a
crucial stage in their education. This was another important reason for
us to stay in Ayr.''
The application for a work permit was made by South Ayrshire Hospitals
NHS Trust. When it was refused, the surgeon's case was taken up by
Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, Mr George Foulkes.
Mr Foulkes said: ''I welcome the sensible decision by the Home Office
to allow Mr Balachandran and his family to stay in Ayrshire. Good
quality doctors can only benefit the people of Ayrshire.''
The Trust chairman, Mr Douglas Brown, added: ''Mr Balachandran is a
very talented surgeon and it would have been a great loss to the Trust
and the people we serve if he had been forced to leave Ayr because of a
bureaucratic muddle.
''Furthermore, there is a great national shortage of specialists in
urology and we need surgeons with skills like those of Mr
Balachandran.''
A spokeswoman for the Department of Employment said she could not
discuss individual cases. But she added: ''One of the criteria we would
look at would be areas where there is a skills shortage.''

<HEADLINE>Forsyth claims Scots do well on UK spending. Lib Dems in clash with SNP</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth last night issued his strongest
defence so far of Government spending in Scotland -- as the Scottish
Liberal Democrats and the SNP argued over what they would do in power.
In a blunt statement issued at Westminster, Mr Forsyth said the fact
was that the UK Government spends substantially more in Scotland than
people pay in taxes, whether or not North Sea Oil revenues are included.
Mr Forsyth said that figures for 1993-94 clearly showed that Scotland
had 10% of UK Government expenditure but, excluding North Sea Oil
revenues, it only had 8.9% of taxation.
Even including oil revenues, he claimed that Government spending per
head was #5550 in Scotland, compared with #4780 in the UK.
Mr Forsyth's comments came after one of the toughest Cabinet spending
battles for years, in which he has tried to secure the Scottish budget.
He said last night: ''One area where taxation in Scotland is higher is
local authority taxation where, despite the much higher level of
Government grant in Scotland, local authority expenditure is so high
that it hits Scottish taxpayers.''
He said that a ''lot of nonsense'' had been bandied about on how much
the Scottish taxpayer pays.
His remarks came as the SNP and the Scottish Liberal Democrats clashed
yesterday over Scotland's political future.
The Liberal Democrats produced an ''Alternative Queen's Speech for
Scotland,'' making clear that 1p of the 3p tax-varying powers available
to a Scottish parliament should be allocated to education.
Party leader Paddy Ashdown denied that his party's plans might mean
Scots having to pay twice for education from income tax rises -- once
from the Scottish parliament and once from Westminster.
If the Scots decided to levy extra income tax for education over and
above a UK income tax increase, that would be up to them, but it was ''a
very clear split, depending on where responsibilities lie.''
The SNP, who will produce a fully-costed shadow Scottish budget on
Monday, said that the Liberal Demorats were Labour's shadow in the
Scottish Constitutional Convention, and had difficulty in putting clear
blue water between themselves and Labour.
Both parties held Westminster news conferences at which it was
acknowledged that the next General Election could take place next
spring, and that the Government was running out of steam.
The Liberal Democrats, in what they said was a policy statement for
the five years after the election, said there would be investment in
training and education, tighter controls on quangos -- with the
abolition, for example, of Scottish Homes -- and curbs on pollution.
All of this depends on the setting up of a Scottish parliament, on
which a deal has been struck in negotiation with Labour to have 129
members democratically elected by a system of proportional
representation.
Scottish Liberal Democrats' leader Jim Wallace said his party's
programme was designed to invest in people, clean up the mess in
politics and build for the long term.
The centrepiece of the legislative programme would be a Bill to
establish a Scottish parliament.
Mr Wallace said: ''At the top of our agenda for Scotland are measures
to improve Scottish education and tackle pollution. These two issues
affect every Scot, and Scottish Liberal Democrats are the only party who
will say how we will fund extra investment in education -- and say what
we will do with it.
''We would introduce legislation for a 10-year Government strategy to
tackle pollution through taxation, better public transport and promotion
of renewable energy.''
For the SNP, party leader Alex Salmond said the Liberal Democrats had
held on to seats in Scotland because of the personalities involved -- he
named Sir David Steel and Sir Russell Johnston -- but it was clear that
they could not differentiate themselves from Labour.
On tax, he widened the attack with a claim that Mr Forsyth was quick
to scaremonger, but never had said anything about the extra tax Scots
already were paying within the Union.
He claimed Scottish Office figures showed Scotland contributing 9.3%
of the UK's tax receipts in 1993/94, compared with the 8.8% of the
population. He said this represented #10 a week for every taxpayer in
Scotland.
Mr Salmond said: ''Business rates are higher in Scotland, and Scots
pay more council tax for homes of the same value compared to England.''
He said that the figures gave the lie to the myth that Scotland was a
subsidised nation.
In a further attack on the Liberal Democrats Mr Forysth said last
night that Mr Wallace had let the cat out of the bag.
He said: ''Before the scheme for a tax-raising parliament has even
been formally launched George Robertson's Liberal partners in the
Constitutional Convention are already lusting to tax the Scottish people
at a higher rate than the rest of the UK.''

BUSINESS leaders have called on Labour to clarify its economic
policies and reassure them that the party would be a friend to business
in Government.
Labour leader Tony Blair is due to address the Confederation of
British Industry's annual conference in Birmingham next week.
In a pre-conference interview, CBI director-general Adair Turner urged
Mr Blair to use the speech to confirm New Labour's ''pro-business,
pro-market economic approach''.
''We want a speech giving as much detail as possible about their
inflation target and their plans for taxation,'' Mr Turner said.
''We want him to increase the level of confidence that the Labour
Party will listen to the needs of business.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has decided to let the people of
Laggan take over the 3500-acre Strathmashie Forest and run it as
Britain's first community forest, The Herald has learned.
According to political sources he is having to overcome stiff
opposition from the Forestry Commission, which is reported to be using
every trick in the book, and some very influential friends, to frustrate
what will be the boldest move yet in his campaign to allow local
Highland communities to take control of their land.
His decision on Laggan can only help to persuade those who have
doubted the depth of Mr Forsyth's commitment to far-reaching rural
reform.
It follows his offer last month to pass control of Scottish
Office-owned crofting estates to local crofting trusts and his call to
private landlords to follow this example.
Most assumed this would be progressed before there was any move on
forestry, not least because of the apparently entrenched position of the
Forestry Commission, which has so far resisted any significant sales of
its 1[1/2] million acres in Scotland to local communities, preferring to
deal with the commercial sector.
However, Mr Forsyth has now been persuaded by the four-year campaign
fought by the local community that the only way to prevent the complete
depopulation of Laggan is to take over the forest and run it for the
community.
One thousand people lived in and around Laggan, nearly 700 of them
Gaelic speakers, at the beginning of the century. Now there are 200,
with just two native Gaelic speakers. The Forestry Commission once
supported more than 30 families, but now it provides no local full-time
employment.
Mr Roy Tylden-Wright, co-owner of neighbouring Cluny estate, who has
been one of those involved in the broad-based campaign, did not want to
discuss the details of a recent meeting with Mr Forsyth, but could not
disguise his feelings when The Herald contacted him yesterday.
He said: ''It was very positive. We are now looking at a range of
options, from raising money for the outright purchase of the forest for
about #750,000, a price agreed by two valuations, to a system of
contract management whereby the commission would get a share of the
value of the timber crop. There is an extraordinary feeling of optimism
here.''
He said that their plans to develop the forest for recreational and
sporting use and to introduce value-added products, combined with more
traditional activity, would mean 10 to 12 jobs.
''Ten to 12 jobs may sound ridiculously few in the context of the
central belt, but they could make a huge difference here,'' he said
yesterday.

<HEADLINE>Blueprint for breakaway from Labour. Scargill plan for left-wing rebel party</HEADLINE>

A NEW left-wing party, a breakaway from Labour, has been proposed by
Mr Arthur Scargill.
The miners' leader believes it could fill the vacuum on the left
created by the move towards the centre ground of British politics under
the leadership of Mr Tony Blair.
The Herald has learned that Mr Scargill put his proposal for the
Socialist Labour Party to a meeting in London last weekend. He argued
that the new organisation could tap into those young people who
increasingly by-pass conventional politics to take direct action on
issues such as the poll tax and the environment.
Such a split in the Labour Party would be the first since the
disillusioned Gang of Four on the right broke away in 1981 to create the
Social Democratic Party.
Mr Scargill has proposed that this offshoot from the left should be
ready to launch as early as May Day next year, and be prepared to
contest every parliamentary seat in Britain.
It is understood that a subsequent meeting was held in Glasgow earlier
this week to report back on the London summit and canvass support for
the breakaway party.
Sources close to Mr Blair were sanguine about the prospect last night,
believing Mr Scargill is a spent force on the left and suspecting the
idea will do little more than flush out opponents of party
modernisation, making it easier to deal with them.
The small gathering of left-wing activists, believed to number around
40, met to ponder their future within New Labour, which they see as
increasingly dominated by Mr Blair's determined assault on the political
middle ground.
Mr Scargill surprised those present by turning up with a
fully-developed nine-page document, entitled ''Future Strategy for the
Left'', outlining plans for the creation of the new Socialist Labour
Party.
This called Labour's new rules ''an unmitigated disaster'' which would
make it impossible for members to campaign for socialism in the future,
and would give the leadership a veto on any return to original
principles.
''Labour is now almost indistinguishable from the Democratic Party in
the United States. Germany's Social Democratic Party or, nearer home,
the Liberal Democrats,'' he said.
''Today we have a sanitised Labour Party which Blair has admitted
should be called Social Democratic. Socialists faced with this new
situation must decide what to do.
''Do we meekly accept New Labour? Do we passively concede that the
party has abandoned socialism and any commitment to common ownership?''
His answer was to argue: ''We do not have the luxury of time. Sooner
rather than later a Socialist Labour Party will be born.''
He added: ''We therefore have to decide if we are prepared to carry on
supporting a Labour Party which now embraces capitalism and the 'free
market' or take a decisive step towards establishing a party capable of
not only resisting capitalism's attacks but of fundamentally changing
society -- in other words, establish a Socialist Labour Party.''
Among those present on Saturday are understood to have been
individuals on the left of the RMT, the rail, maritime and transport
union, of which Labour deputy leader John Prescott is a member, the
English teaching union the NUT, the public sector Unison and the
construction union, UCATT.
They travelled to London from Scotland, as well as Manchester,
Newcastle and Sheffield.
Mr Scargill has been a thorn in the side of successive Labour leaders
and has stuck steadfastly to his left-wing principles as the party has
''modernised'' to the right.
He threatened to leave Labour, of which he has been a member for
almost 30 years, immediately following his humiliating defeat at last
month's annual party conference when his efforts to revive Labour's
traditional Clause 4 commitment to common ownership were swept aside by
a landslide majority of almost 90%.
In the five weeks since that stark demonstration of his dwindling
influence within the Labour Party, he has drawn up his own blueprint for
this rival Socialist Labour Party.
A spokesperson for Mr Scargill said last night that it was a
discussion paper drawn up by Mr Scargill as a disaffected member of the
Labour Party and not as president of the National Union of Mineworkers.
She emphasised that he was ''not breaking any rules''.
He and many other party members had been placed in a dilemma by Labour
ditching its socialist aims including its commitment to public ownership
and Mr Scargill felt it was now time for people like him to discuss
whether they wished to remain with Labour.
Last night Mr Allan Green of the Scottish Socialist Movement said Mr
Scargill recognised the autonomy of Scotland and envisaged parallel
developments north and south of the Border.
He said: ''For some time now we have been organising socialist forums
that examine options on the way forward and co-ordinating campaigning
activity. For example, during the summer a forum in Glasgow heard a
suggestion for a Scottish Socialist Alliance to form a slate to stand
for the first elections, held under PR, to a Scottish Parliament.''

<TEXT>
A VINEYARD owner who opened fire on two intruders trying to steal wine
from his bonded warehouse was cleared by a jury yesterday.
Mr Jon Pritchett, 60, was found not guilty at Maidstone Crown Court of
wounding Steven Gilbert and Charles O'Hara with intent to cause grievous
bodily harm.
The two men had broken into his warehouse, containing #12,000 worth of
wine, at his home in Crouch Lane, St Mary's Platt, near Borough Green,
Kent, on December 1 last year.
Mr Pritchett, who had fired four shots from his 12-bore shotgun, two
of which struck Gilbert and O'Hara, said after the case: ''I feel great
now it is all over.''
Judge Mr Justice Newman had told the vineyard owner after the verdicts
were announced: ''For those of us who have heard the detail of this case
and for those who might misunderstand the result, I think one thing is
plain.
''The events of this particular night caused you great trauma, such
trauma that you suffered a speech impediment for some time. I think the
general lesson that results in this case is the severe consequences of
what you did and the consequences on you.''
Mr Pritchett's solicitor, Mr Ted Hubbard, said after the hearing:
''This case should not have been brought to court.
''Someone in authority in the Crown Prosecution Service should have
had a little more understanding of the problems of two criminals being
involved and putting a decent, well-behaved citizen under stress,
particularly in the delay between the incident and Mr Pritchett being
charged and between the charges and the trial. But justice has been
done.''
Mr Pritchett, who has two married sons, has since stopped producing
wine at his vineyard.
Shortly before the shooting, he was made redundant from his job as a
loss adjuster.
Mr Hubbard added: ''This is a man who has had one unfortunate event
after another.''
In evidence, Mr Pritchett had denied that he intended to hit the two
men the night he opened fire.
In a stammer, which developed after the incident, he told the jury:
''Standing there in the dark, I was a terrified man. I decided I was
going to frighten them. I wanted them off my premises.''
After being hit, one of the burglars O'Hara, 36, fell from the roof
screaming: ''Help me, I'm dying.''
The other, Gilbert, 31, was shot as he tried to clamber over a barbed
wire fence into some woods to safety.
Gilbert suffered nerve damage to his left arm while O'Hara, who
refused to go to court to give evidence, was peppered by shot on his
chest and back.
Unemployed builder Gilbert, of Kenward Road, Yalding, Kent, said he
and O'Hara went to the warehouse to steal some wine.
Both men had been drinking heavily and climbed in through a hole in
the roof and saw the wine.
Gilbert told the court: ''I saw Charlie put his head up through the
hole. There was a shot fired at him. There was loads of blood on my left
side. I am still full of pellets.''
Mr Brian Leech, defending, said in his final speech to the jury:
''This is not a case of a man being a vigilante walking the streets. It
was someone asleep and dragged out of bed by someone else.''
Mr Justice Newman had told the jury that they had to be sure Mr
Pritchett intended to cause the two men serious bodily harm.
''It is the defence case that he had no such intention,'' he said.
''He said he acted as he did to frighten them, to stop them stealing his
wine, and frighten them away from his property and him.
''If you find he acted in this way, you acquit him,'' the judge had
said.
At the end of the trial, the Crown offered no evidence on a charge of
possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.
The vineyard owner had always denied that charge and a not guilty
verdict was formally entered by the court.

THE Princess Royal's son may have played his way into the Scottish
schools under-18 rugby squad after an outstanding trial performance
yesterday.
Peter Phillips, 17, impressed selectors when he scored a first-rate
try to cap a memorable match.
He was on trial at Murrayfield with five fellow pupils from
Gordonstoun for the international series, starting next month.
There were 37 boys taking part and around 20 schools were represented.
If successful, he would be the first member of the royal family to
play rugby for Scotland.
Internationalist Scott Hastings said: ''Peter's played very well. The
fact he's scored a try sums up his performance.''
The boy had been described by SRU secretary Bill Hogg as ''an
outstanding prospect'' when he saw him play recently.
His housemaster, Mr Ben Goss, said he was very proud of the way the
royal youngster and the other Gordonstoun boys performed.
He said: ''They played their hearts out and they were magnificent.''
All the schools will be notified of the squad by tomorrow. The panel
of five selectors will choose 22 boys to represent Scotland in matches
against France, England, Ireland, and Wales.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Princess Royal, as patron of
the Scottish Rugby Union, was a big fan of the game.
Meanwhile, there has been a lukewarm response to an English proposal
to switch the Five Nations championships to consecutive weekends in May.

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH local authority is calling for an urgent re-examination of
building regulations on the fitting of windows following the findings of
a fatal accident inquiry into the death of a toddler.
East Lothian District Council also wants national standards against
which the effectiveness of window catches can be tested. It is urging
the Scottish Office to set new safety guidelines.
It has also set up a team of specialist officers to look at issues
relating to window safety and is implementing immediately a series of
measures that includes fitting new window catches.
The inquiry, which lasted 19 days over a five-month period, was into
the death of 21-month-old Ewan Smith of Moir Crescent, Musselburgh, who
died on June 9 last year, two days after falling 30ft from a
second-storey emergency window in his council-owned home.
It is believed the toddler was attracted by the jingles of an
ice-cream van, climbed on to the window sill from a bed, accidentally
overcame the latch and a restrictor catch of the window, and plunged to
the ground.
In a 114-page written determination issued last week, Sheriff George
Presslie called for child safety devices to be mandatory on all windows
above ground-floor level.
Councillor Norman Murray, chairman of East Lothian District Council's
housing committee, said yesterday: ''The sheriff's findings on the
circumstances of this terrible accident will have an impact on every
council and every landlord in Scotland.
''We will now be seeking an urgent meeting with Scottish Office
Ministers to press the case for a thorough and urgent examination of
relevant building regulations and the wider issue of window safety.''
Mr Murray added that the current regulations were contradictory.
Among the urgent measures being taken by the council are the fitting
of new restrictor catches, of a type suggested by Sheriff Presslie, on
emergency access windows.

A FRENCH court decision ordering British Airways to pay a total of #3m
in damages to 61 Gulf War hostages seized after their plane landed in
Kuwait has raised questions over why similiar court actions in Britain
failed.
Last night, Scottish passenger David Banks, one of six British
passengers aboard the BA Boeing 747 flight from London to Kuala Lumpur
who attempted to sue the airline after being held as part of Saddam
Hussein's human shield, demanded to know why the British Government had
not forced BA to settle compensation claims in the UK.
In common with the British passengers, the French had argued during a
hearing in a Paris civil court, that the flight, with 364 passengers on
board, was delayed at Heathrow so that 15 SAS commandos could board.
They also argued that the flight had then landed in Kuwait, hours after
the Iraqi invasion began, allowing the troops to disembark.
The French court ruled that BA was fully responsible and awarded each
passenger between 400,000 and 600,000 francs as well 1.17m francs to the
French Government for state compensation paid to ex-hostages.
The ruling outraged BA which described it as ''astonishing'' and
pledged to seek an appeal. The airline reiterated its claim that the
delay in London was for air conditioning repairs and that the Kuwait
stopover was routine.
However, the move gives fresh hope to those whose action was thrown
out by the Court of Appeal and to a group of 11 English passengers whose
claims were rejected by the English Court of Appeal.
Mr Banks, a consultant engineer from Banchory, had been on a business
trip to Kuala Lumpur. When the airport was closed, he was seized and
held prisoner for four months, first in Kuwait and then in Iraq. He and
five other British passengers lost their case before Lord Marnoch at the
Court of Session, in December 1993, and a subsequent appeal.
At the time, Lord Marnoch said BA was not responsible because under
the 1929 Warsaw Convention an airline was liable only if a passenger was
killed, wounded or an accident took place on board an aircraft.
Last night, Mr Banks said the French ruling raised questions about the
Court of Session and Court of Appeal judgments and said the group's
financial backers, Aberdeen-based Quantum Claims, had already begun
moves to lodge an appeal with the House of Lords.
''I was very interested in the result that came forward this morning
because in the very early stage the American people who were claiming
got an early settlement, now we've got the French. I find it very
interesting that the French are being compensated so why shouldn't the
British be?''

THE 80 residents of the remote Scoraig Peninsula in Wester Ross are
delighted with a new car park that has been built for them, despite it
being on the opposite side of a sea loch.
The people of Scoraig park their vehicles at Badluarach, near
Dundonnell, on the south side of Loch Broom, and rely on small boats to
ferry themselves and their goods to and from their community, which has
no road access.
Until recently, they were faced with a haphazard system of parking
near Badluarach jetty, often on grass verges and passing places.
Following land reclamation works, a 30- space car park has been
created. A storage area has been provided for materials such as hay,
straw, and fuel before they are ferried across. The beach at Badluarach
has also been dredged to allow boats to land more easily.

LOTHIAN Regional Council yesterday agreed spending curbs to avoid
passing on debts of #8m to its four successor authorities.
Its finance committee approved tighter controls on all departments and
a range of capital transfers to ensure an even balance sheet when the
council is wound up next April.
Committee chairman Councillor Brian Weddell said it was too early to
say where any cuts might bite.
''We are trying to make painless savings in the next five months and
avoid direct impact on services to the public,'' he said, ''but we may
have hard decisions to make in the future.
''The #8m projected deficit is obviously a cause for concern and it
would be a very unfortunate legacy for the successor councils. Every
local authority is going to be facing huge difficulties next year in
setting its budget and we do not wish to add to them.''
Finance director James Clark said transfers of capital would meet some
of the shortfall. It would not be possible to clear the deficit by
savings alone without signifcant service changes.
The committee heard that all departments would be drawing up lists of
savings. Education, the largest spender in Lothian's total budget of
#680m, faces the biggest deficit of #3.4m and the police service one of
#1.3m.
Social work also faces a projected #2.6m deficit. Half of this is due
to increased demands on services including residential and nursing home
places which the Department of Social Security can no longer meet.
* Leaders from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are due to
meet Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth tomorrow to voice fears over
Budget cuts affecting councils.

MORALE among Britain's nurses has fallen to such an extent that nearly
two-thirds have considered leaving the NHS over the past year and fewer
than one in 10 would definitely recommend nursing or midwifery as a
career.
These are the central findings of a major survey of nurses' opinion
carried out by Gallup and published today by Unison to coincide with a
meeting with the Nurses and Midwives Pay Review Body at which Unison
will press the case for an award of at least 8% to attract new recruits
and retain existing staff.
The survey shows a steep increase in the numbers considering leaving
nursing -- up to 62% compared with 59% in 1994 and 47% a year earlier.
Main reasons given for dissatisfaction include the changing nature of
the NHS, feeling undervalued, staff shortages, having to compromise on
standards of care, and managers' treatment of staff.

London remains a mecca for homeless Scots because, as Margaret Vaughan
discovers, it holds out some hope of a better life.
THE thing about William is that he is everybody's idea of the born
loser except his own.
He was only 18 months old when his drunken, loutish dad picked him out
of his high chair and hurled him across the room, where he lay hurt and
crying for his mother to pick him up but she couldn't because if she had
she'd have felt the back of her husband's hand across her face. He did
it a lot.
So the worn-out woman ran away with her six children to this refuge
place in Fife but there were nervous breakdowns and tries at stabbing
and slashing herself and the family ended up in care and residential
schools, all of them, while she tried to pick up the pieces of a broken
life.
The other thing about William is that for all the brutality, the pain,
the enduring, dispiriting, impoverishment of his life, he doesn't give
up.
William went to London in July. He'd left the same residential school
where he'd been since he was 10, the same one his big brother graduated
from, and where his wee brother is now in his final year, and he headed
down south. His big sister was working in a pub. He was 17 and there was
nothing up here for him -- nothing. He heard it was good down there.
He wanted to work. So he got a job as a labourer and that was fine but
then he started getting ripped off. He worked harder and harder and the
wages just got smaller all the time. He was kipping on the floor of the
brother of his sister's boyfriend but then he had to come home on a
message. He had to bring his sister's dog back to Fife.
When he went back down, there was nowhere to stay and he and his big
brother were kipping out in the streets, at the Temple. It was just a
couple of nights. Then they went to this Borderline, a church place,
looking for a bed and they gave them a place at a hostel in Lewisham.
It's not much, like, but he's hoping to get work again. He's sure it's
there, you just have to look hard to find it.
He wants the money to get his big sister home. See, his mum's back in
hospital and his sister needs to get home but she doesn't have the cash.
William's going to get a job and take care of them, all of them.
He thinks if he can just get all his family down there, to London,
they'll be all right, because there's a lot doing. There's the markets,
his mum would love them, and there's all the shops, and he just keeps
wondering why she stabs herself and if they were all together in London
he thinks it would be fine again.
He loves his family and he's angry that he gave his mother a hard time
when he was growing up and the guilt eats him up. He wants to make it
all better.
London's not been bad to him. He's just got to get a handle on it,
find a job and that, and a house. When his brother gets out of the
school, and his wee sister's old enough to leave the carers she's with,
maybe they can all be together again, a family like, and then it'll be
all right.
The main thing about William is that, right now, he still cares. He
hasn't given up.

THE former bookkeeper of the Western Meeting Club, owner of Ayr
Racecourse, is being sued for the recovery of more than #100,000 which,
it is alleged, he failed to lodge in the club's account at the Bank of
Scotland.
A writ against Mr William Carey further alleges loss or damage to the
club caused by his breach of contract. The club is seeking court leave
for the power of arrest over his assets.
Mr Carey, of Kilkerran Drive, Troon, denies the allegations and has
instructed his solicitors to defend the action.
Mr Carey left his former job after discrepancies were discovered in
the club's accounts. Investigations are being carried out by Strathclyde
Police and an independent report is being prepared by Coopers and
Lybrand.

(Do not quote this article.  The driver was wrongly identified.  RBJ
13/11/95).  TWO undercover drug squad detectives gave
evidence from behind a
screen about an alleged #27,750 ecstasy operation yesterday.
A judge ruled last week that they could do so to protect their
identities and future drugs operations.
They gave evidence at the High Court in Glasgow under the names Mr
Vitorio Salesi and Mr Martin Clark, and no-one except the judge,
lawyers, and the jury were allowed to see them. A six-panelled screen
covered in black cloth shielded them from public view.
On trial are Mr Steven Coan, 24, Mr Brian Smith, 30, Mr James MacLean,
20, and Mr John McDonald, 26.
They deny that between July 1 and 19 this year they were concerned in
the supply of ecstasy in the Marriott Hotel on Argyle Street, Glasgow.
Mr MacLean and Mr McDonald also deny possessing a sawn-off shotgun.
At the start of yesterday's proceedings, Lord Weir instructed the jury
not to speculate about the reasons behind the presence of the screen and
not to allow it to affect their conclusions about the evidence.
Both officers told Mr Scott Brady, prosecuting, they had been brought
to Scotland from England for the drugs operation.
Mr Salesi said he was instructed by the Edinburgh operations team to
meet a man called Steve in the Marriott Hotel, Glasgow, and portray
himself as a drug dealer wanting to buy ecstasy tablets.
He introduced himself to Steve, who he identified in court as Mr Coan,
and they talked about a 5000-tablet deal.
Mr Salesi said he ''haggled'' over the price and eventually agreed to
pay #4.75 a tablet, bringing the total to #27,750.
He was shown six tablets as a sample and they discussed testing the
drugs in a car to determine that they were genuine.
Present during the first meeting was another man called Robbie. Mr
Salesi said Robbie was also an undercover policeman.
Mr Salesi claimed that during another meeting in the hotel the next
day he told Steve to make the drugs available by 4pm, or the deal was
off. At 3.45pm, he alleged, Steve phoned him to say the ''gear'' was on
its way in five minutes.
At 4.15pm, Mr Salesi arrived with a small rucksack and said he was in
a position to go ahead with the exchange.
Mr Salesi said he told Steve: ''Let's get on with it,'' and took him
first to the male toilets to see the contents of the rucksack and to
search Steve for a concealed weapon.
Mr Salesi said he then took Steve up to his hotel room, where another
undercover police officer, Mr Martin Clark, was waiting.
An attache case containing the #27,750 was put on the bed and opened,
and Steve, Mr Salesi said, began to count the notes.
Steve then left with Mr Clark to test the drugs in a car which was
waiting outside.
When defence counsel Mr Donald Findlay QC tried to ask Mr Salesi about
his rank and police service, Lord Weir rebuked him.
Mr Clark, the other undercover officer told how he was taken to a car
parked near the hotel where the drugs were being kept.
He identified the accused Mr James MacLean as a passenger and Mr John
McDonald as possibly being the driver.
(The driver, John McDonald, was wrongly identified.  Do not quote this
article.  RBJ 13/11/95).  Mr Clark said he was given a
knife to cut open five packages of pills
and took two from each for testing before the cash was to be handed
over.
The trial continues.
