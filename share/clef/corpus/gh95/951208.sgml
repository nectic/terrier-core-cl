A SUCCESSFUL businessman whose life was said to have been ruined by a
long-running dispute with a number of lawyers yesterday escaped punishment for
arming himself with a hammer and smashing up equipment in his solicitor's
office.
Iain McIntyre, 44, of Corsebar Road, Paisley, was given an absolute discharge
after pleading guilty to breach of the peace.
Glasgow Sheriff Court was told Mr McIntyre had been involved in a 10-year
dispute with two law firms: Wright and Crawford, of Glasgow Road, Paisley; and
MacRoberts, of Bath Street, Glasgow.
Mr McIntyre alleges lawyers' incompetence has cost him his housebuilding
business, his health, and his home. He is claiming #2.75m damages for loss and
legal fees.
The court heard that, in a moment of ``temporary insanity'', Mr McIntyre went
into the offices of Grant &amp; Co in West Regent Street, Glasgow, smashed a
telephone and fax machine, then locked himself in a room and tried to cut his
wrists.
Grant &amp; Co were helping Mr McIntyre with his claims but, in December last year,
he became ``overwhelmed by the hopelessnes and helplessness'' of his situation.
The court heard he may have thought the firm was distancing itself from his
case. He brandished the hammer and smashed equipment, causing #150 damage, as
staff ran from the office and telephoned police. He was arrested and remanded
in custody over New Year until January 6.
Mr George More, defending, blamed the incompetence and negligence of previous
lawyers for pushing Mr McIntyre to the brink of insanity.
``He has lost his business and the conduct of the lawyers has affected his
health, it could even be said, ruined his life. It was a cry for help,'' Mr
More said.
Mr McIntyre had been a property developer who lost his busines after a
conveyancing error by a partner at his first lawyers, Wright and Crawford. The
second firm he employed, MacRoberts, was also negligent, it was alleged, though
Grant &amp; Co fought ``vigorously'' on his behalf.
Sheriff George Crozier said he had decided to grant an absolute discharge
because Mr McIntyre had already spent one week in custody for his first
offence, a written apology to Grant &amp; Co had been accepted, and he had promised
to pay for the damage.
After studying articles from The Herald and medical reports, Sheriff Crozier
said: ``This is an extremely worrying case. Obviously the accused has been
sadly wronged and lost a tremendous amount of money, indeed has been ruined,
because of negligence in drawing up his title deeds.''
The sheriff added: ``Looking at all the reports and history before me, I do
agree he was under extreme strain and stress at the time this happened. This
does not excuse the remedy he took but it does make it more understandable. I
hope this good citizen will not be in trouble again.''
After the case, Mr McIntyre said he was delighted at the sheriff's sympathetic
decision.
Mr McIntyre is still involved in four Court of Session actions against law
firms. The Law Society of Scotland declined to comment because of those
forthcoming actions.
Mr Hugh Grant, senior partner of Grant &amp; Co, said after the hearing that Mr
McIntyre had been forgiven and the compensation money would be donated to
Children in Need.

SEVERAL Government Ministers have become victims of car or mobile phone cloning
in the past 18 months it was disclosed last night. The illegal practice, by
which numbers are obtained and then transferred to other mobile phones so calls
can be made free of charge and billed to the original owner, is prevalent in
central London. A series of written replies to Labour's Brian Donohoe
(Cunnnghame South) gave the extent of cloning in Government departments. It was
said to have happened once to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth - when he was
serving as a Home Office Minister.

THE unstinting service of five of Scotland's leading sports volunteers was
recognised last night in a ceremony at Murrayfield, Edinburgh, where Raymond
Robertson, the Scottish Office Minister with responsibility for sport, made the
Scottish Sports Council National Service to Sport presentations.
Anne Gulland has served Scottish and UK hockey for almost 50 years, and steps
down after 19 years as treasurer of GB women following next year's Olympics.
Mac Henderson was a Scottish junior badminton internationalist in the early
1950s, played in the 1966 Commonwealth Games, and is still on the management
board of the Scottish Badminton Union of which he has been treasurer for the
past 12 years. Dennis Carmichael, honorary president of the Scottish Lawn
Tennis Association is the only Scot to become chairman of the LTA (1978), while
Jack Richmond and George Stewart have given notable service to shinty and
skiing respectively.

<HEADLINE>Back to basics BICC writes  off #78m in Clarke sale</HEADLINE>

CABLES and construction group BICC is writing off a total of #78m on the sale
of its Clarke Homes housebuilding activities following upon the strategic
decision to return much more to its core activities.
The buyer is the highly regarded Westbury which is paying #60.7m cash. That is
being funded by a rights issue to raise #32.2m net and the remainder is coming
from bank borrowings.
Shareholders are being offered one new share at 150p for every three held.
Market reaction was to knock 6p off the existing shares to 176p while BICC was
down 2p - both falls being on relatively small turnover.
The move will be welcomed by the housebuilding industry, which is anxious to
rationalise the number of participants.
BICC bought Clarke in 1987 for #51m for a company with assets of #7m.
At its peak, it was building 1200 houses but, like the vast majority of the
small to medium size housebuilders, numbers dropped considerably during the
recession and in 1994 it achieved a build of 600 units. The majority were in
the Midlands and the South of England and some in Scotland.
Last year, the loss was some #3m and in the first half of the current year, it
was trading at near breakeven.
Clarke owns some 2228 plots with planning consent. Its aquisition will require
a #1.7m provision against Westbury's current year profits which the City
estimates will rise from #12.6m to around #16m and be one of the few
housebuilders to show an improvement over the preceding year's trading.

A FEW weeks ago Scottish Nuclear asked me to write an article for its staff
newspaper outlining my views on the proposed privatisation of the industry.
The ideal, which I found perfectly acceptable, was that it would then have the
right to reply which would be appended to my article. That was fine by me. The
article was written and receipt acknowledged, without any hint of a problem. I
heard nothing more.
Yesterday I found out that Scottish Nuclear had reneged on that arrangement.
The article was not published. I have looked at it again and it does not seem
so defective in style, syntax, or content as to merit that treatment. So here,
for a wider audience, are some of the arguments if not the article.
We know, of course, that nuclear privatisation has nothing to do with Britain's
energy needs or, indeed, of public finances. As with railways, the decision to
privatise is purely a political one, driven by the urgent desire to raise more
money next year for last-gasp tax cuts.
As the Financial Times put it: ``Privatisation is to be shaped by political
pressures and the interests of future shareholders, not by the needs of
electricity consumers.'' Indeed, it is uncharacteristically frank to put a ``Mr
Robb'' in charge of a privatisation exercise. (I didn't even include that line
in the article for Scottish Nuclear!)
I did, however, gently remind Robin Jeffrey, formerly chief executive of
Scottish Nuclear, that as recently as April of this year, he stated: ``Let's be
absolutely clear. The creation of a single UK nuclear company is a proposal
which has little or nothing going for it. It would mean less competition in the
generating industry.''
Indeed it would. The giveaway is in the name - British Energy - selected for
the new company (which has so little going for it) of which Robin Jeffrey is
now, of course, deputy chairman to John Robb.
That name is intended, we know, as confirmation that the people who have been
placed by Ministers in the privileged position of running the company have no
intention of restricting their activities to nuclear generation.
But it is also a slap in the face to the men and women who have devoted so much
commitment to establishing a successful civil nuclear industry in this country.
Now the architects of privatisation dare not speak its name, as they organise
their share options and rub their hands at the prospect of joining the more
lucrative dash for gas.
I did try to tell the Scottish Nuclear workforce about a conference on nuclear
privatisation which I spoke at in London. Just as I arrived, the previous
speaker was being congratulated by the chairman - a former Tory MP - for the
most effective presentation he had heard in support of nuclear privatisation.
But the speaker in question was not a Government Minister or even a ``British
Energy'' director. He was the man from Greenpeace and his enthusiasm for
privatisation was based entirely on the belief that this was the quickest
possible way of killing off the entire nuclear generation industry.
For a whole range of reasons - including, I would argue, environmental ones - I
do not think that is a very good idea. But the logic is clear. Left to its own
commercial devices, ``British Energy'' will soon lose interest in nuclear
generation, which will slowly wither on the vine.
Where will that leave my constituents at Hunterston and their successors? I do
not think it was unreasonable for me to alert the Scottish Nuclear workforce to
the reasons why Greenpeace is the unlikely (but perfectly logical) cheer leader
for nuclear privatisation.
And where would an ``eight nuclear power stations for the price of one''
sell-off leave the taxpayer? For starters there is plenty evidence buried in
the small print of last week's public expenditure proposals that the costs of
nuclear privatisation to the Treasury are soaring almost as fast as those of
the proposed rail sell-off.
We're talking billions of additional public spending in each case, to
facilitate two utterly unwanted privatisations - and this at a time when axes
of Thatcherite proportions are being wielded in so many areas of useful public
expenditure.
This, of course, is only for starters. The costs of Magnox decommissioning -
which would, naturally, be left for the taxpayer to bear - are certainly
massive but still undefinable.
I am sorry that Scottish Nuclear - or was it British Energy? - decided that
this and other arguments against privatisation, from someone who has supported
the company and the industry as a member of Parliament, were not deemed
suitable reading for employees and their families. One might have thought that,
given the last word, it might have had a little more self-confidence in its
case.
And I don't know if British Energy will carry on the engaging Scottish Nuclear
custom of hosting a Burns Supper at the Caledonian Club in London. But if so, I
recommend a reading of one of the poet's sharpest verses:
Here's freedom to him who would
read;
Here's freedom to him who would
write;
There's none ever feared that the
truth should be heard,
But him that the truth would
indict.

Report urges more
action on policy
THE Scottish farming industry should be organising itself now to put forward
proposals for the re-shaping of the Common Agriculture Policy in Europe,
according to the Trustee Savings Bank's latest analysis of agriculture in
Scotland.
Donald MacRae, the bank's agricultural adviser, welcomes the National Farmers'
Union of Scotland decision to get involved in the CAP debate. ``This has come
not a moment too soon, given the speed and scale of the turn-round in
Brussels,'' he said.
``The major thrust of the reform can be identified now. Less support will be
linked directly to production and increasing amounts will be paid for
environmental reasons. Compliance with environmental standards such as levels
of inputs applied, stocking densities, and measures of agricultural intensity
will have to be devised.
``The sooner the industry in Scotland puts its case on these matters the
better. It is strategically more powerful to have an input to the formation of
policy now than attempt to change decisions after they have been taken.''
One obvious dilemma for the Scottish industry is identified. Given the larger
size of the Scottish farm, policies constructed for the average European farm,
with support skewed towards environmental and social measures paid to
small-scale farmers, would, initially, leave Scottish and UK farmers at a
disadvantage.
Mr MacRae is convinced, however, that the competitive advanatage of superior
farm size will eventually persist and benefit British farmers.
One area of disadvantage is the UK and Scottish farmers' attitude to
co-operation, which is less positive than in some EU countries. About 30% of
Scottish agricultural output is sold co-operatively, compared to up to 90% for
some products in Europe.
``The difference is more than skin-deep,'' he said. ``Co-ops in European
countries concentrate on adding value after the produce has left the farm. This
is in direct contrast to Scotland where many co-ops still concentrate on a
supply of agricultural inputs. The potential for the future is in adding value
through processing agricultural products.'' One result of the lacklustre
approach to co-operation is that UK farmers have little market power compared
to multiple retailers who are among the biggest and most powerful in Europe.
Matching the market power of the multiples is not immediately feasible, he
concedes. ``However, there is little disagreement that co-op mergers are
required to give the market size capable of delivering buying and selling power
in the food industry. The day of the transnational co-operative is in the
offing.''
The analysis looks at the world scene and points to the aggressive American
stance on food exports compared to an unambitious approach from the EU. Part of
the blame may be laid at the door of the quota system, it is suggested. ``A
rational analysis of quotas concludes that they solve problems short-term, but
impose increasing economic costs medium to long-term.''

MITSUBISHI's vehicle division offers the biggest range and number of individual
products imaginable, from 550cc city runabouts to 22-litre trucks. But while
several of its rivals set up factories in the UK to tap into the European
market, Mitsubishi seemed to be lagging behind.
However, it took a different route into Europe, collaborating with Volvo and
the Dutch government in a joint-venture factory at Born near Maastricht. The
Carisma, built there and already on sale on the Continent, has arrived in this
country as the first-ever Mitsubishi not brought in from Japan.
This is a well-proportioned five-door hatchback. Bearing in mind that it is a
properly roomy car, with better rear-seat legroom and headroom than many of its
Far Eastern rivals, as well as good equipment levels, the prices are very
reasonable.
The 1.6 GL manual, with Mitsubishi's own 88bhp 16-valve engine and a Renault
gearbox, costs #10,999. The top price is #15,349 for the 1.8-litre GLS, powered
by a 114bhp engine linked to the Mitsubishi four-speed automatic transmission
which, as in the Galant, adjusts itself to a certain extent to the driver's
technique and the type of road being travelled.
As usual, the basic specification in each version can be enhanced by asking for
the extra-cost Diamond option pack. That designation has always seemed rather
twee, but it is quite justifiable, bearing in mind that Mitsubishi means
``three diamonds'', which is what the marque badge displays.
While many manufacturers try to convince you of how inexpensive their cars are,
when judged on a ``whole life'' basis, Mitsubishi has some quite convincing
independent figures to help put its case. Within the last month, the EMMOX
survey for fleet managers has shown the Carisma as likely to be the cheapest
car in its class to run.
EMMOX takes into account not just original price, insurance ratings, servicing
charges and warranty arrangements, but also likely residual values. Mitsubishis
are strongly placed here, since the controlled-supply situation means that
demand rarely runs in advance of what stock is available. The importers must
have a fair idea of how to run their business, because Mitsubishi claims
customer loyalty levels around 80 per cent.
Short familiarisation runs in Perthshire last week suggested that the various
models of Carisma have meaty mid-range performance, handling and ride qualities
which are better for the typical owner than some magazine reports suggest, and
a higher-than-expected level of wind noise, although it may be the reduction of
mechanical noise which brings up the wind whistle.

ROBERT FIELDS is Glasgow's top rock geezer. How can you tell? Because when we
meet, Robert is in public possession of tight leather trousers and a Little
Angels tour jacket - within the hours of daylight! Nay, at 11 o'clock on a
Tuesday morning!
Robert is also inordinately proud of the fact that Lee Kerslake, late of
riffmeisters Uriah Heep, is his son's godfather. Additionally, Robert bears
more than a passing resemblance to one of his top rock-geezer mates, Ozzy
Osbourne.
Most tellingly, Robert is a master of the pithy, all-purpose lingo of
rock'n'roll. ``No boomph,'' he will say apropos of this band or another. Other
acts are variously deemed ``not dangerous'' or ``too safe''. Of his eight years
as a roadie with the aforementioned Uriah Heep, he has a major philosophical
conclusion. ``Earplugs were for wimps!'' Robert shouts deafly.
These days the erstwhile welder from Springburn is making a PR noise for the
new improved Cathouse. After five successful years by the Clyde, the Glasgow
rock venue has relocated to more central premises in Union Street. On three
floors formerly occupied by such long-gone clubs as Viva and Vamps, the
Cathouse is owned by Donald McLeod and Michael Pagliocca, the partnership who
so splendidly reinvented another Glasgow venue, the Garage.
Despite its success, though, the only healthy-looking thing about the old
Cathouse was the light which shone brightly above the door of the men's lavvy.
In contrast, the new Cathouse is more stylishly grungy.
As well as in decor, money has been invested in an in-house sound system. ``As
we've our own PA, there's no cost to us in giving gigs to young local bands who
are desperate to play,'' says Robert, ever keen to encourage Scottish music at
a grassroots level.
This concern extends to free admissions for organised parties of 15 or more.
``We want the Cathouse to be a proper club, not just a weekend disco. But we're
also aware that people hear the name Cathouse and just think `Oh aye, rock',
when rock covers a number of sins. On our dance-floor, for instance, you'll
hear Bryan Adams, Def Leppard, the Kinks, and the Beatles, alongside more
modern brain-damage metal.
``And as well as gigs by Pearl Jam, the old Cathouse staged the Bhundu Boys, an
all-girl ceilidh band, the Average White Band, the Lemonheads.'' It also made
its mark on rock history as the site of an Oasis live B-side, I Am The Walrus.
Robert continues to make his own mark on Scottish rock history as promoter at
the Bruce Hotel, East Kilbride, an out-of-the-way gig with a Britain-wide
reputation.
Oh aye, the Cathouse: not too safe, not too dangerous, plenty of boomph. Robert
Fields? Welding people together with the force of rock. Top geezer.
n Forthcoming Cathouse highlights include Luna (December 14) and Jayne County
(December 18).

AT six locations stretching from Aberdeen to Stranraer, 42 teams take to the
ice this weekend, aiming to qualify for the next stage of the season's premier
domestic event, the Maccallan Scottish champion-ships.
The Aberdeen line-up includes the Perth team of Warwick, David, and Peter
Smith, and lead player David Hay who, following their latest victory in last
week's Edinburgh International, are among the favourites to take the title
overall next year.
They open their campaign this evening against John Jo Kenny, who made it all
the way to the national finals in Perth last season.
Tom Brewster, the current world junior champion, leads the line-up on his home
ice in Lockerbie, while at Murrayfield, the Scottish champion of two seasons
ago, Colin Hamilton, is in action against Alex MacGregor this evening.
The top teams from last year's national finals have been exempted from
participation at this stage of the championships this year, but even without
the likes of European champion Hammy McMillan and defending Scottish champion
Gordon Muirhead, there is still the prospect of keen competition and quality
play over the weekend to come.

<HEADLINE>MP calls for dairy industry  to hire fraud investigators</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>26</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974995466</RECORDNO>

LEADERS of Britain's dairy farmers were yesterday urged to employ investigative
journalists to prove EU fraud in the milk sector of Mediterranean countries.
The advice to the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers came from Dale
Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, during a Commons select committee
meeting on the British dairy industry and the CAP dairy regime.
In evidence to the committee, the association said that in addition to the
technical and economic problems of the regime and quota restrictions, there
were further distortions caused by certain countries' actions.
``What has angered producers is that dairy producers have tried to produce to
their quota ceiling. Unless, and until a quota regime can be enforced on an
equitable basis across the European Union, it will be those countries with a
more regulated farming structure who will continue to be penalised.''
Mr Campbell-Savours asked if the association had been able to establish the
scale of the fraud. Dr Robert Bruce, chairman of the association's board, said
he was not aware of any work in this area.
William Powell, Conservative MP for Corby, asked why the association had not
done anything about this itself. Dr Bruce said it was a question of resources,
suggesting that European farmers' unions pursue the matter.
Pressing the point, Mr Campbell-Savours said it seemed as though nobody wanted
to do anything about the issue and turn a blind eye.
``Maybe we should have investigative journalists in Europe paid for by the
RABDF to establish that this is going on and its scale. The regime is being
subverted by fraud but good old Britain plays the game.''
The MPs turned to the potential policing role of doorstep delivery people.
President Lord Rayleigh - whose Essex-based business employs 400 people -
pointed out their importance in watching for neighbourhood crime. ``They are
the eyes and ears of the police when everyone else is asleep,'' he said.
Chairman Sir Gerry Wiggin, Conservative MP for Western-super-Mare, asked how
many reports of criminal activity the delivery people had given. Lord Rayleigh
said he had no information on this but would compile a report for submission.
The association, the Country Landowners' Federation, and the Tenant Farmers'
Assocation all agreed that milk quotas introduced in 1984 had led to the
ossification of the dairy industry but had largely protected farmers' incomes.
This had resulted in a substantial re-investment programme on farms to cope
with the lean years expected ahead.

AMERICAN Clay Devers and Australian Jeff Senior yesterday shot bogey-free six
under par rounds of 66 to share the lead after the first round of the Western
Vietnam Open.
In Vietnam's first ever professional tournament, they led by one stroke from
Taiwan's Lin Keng-chi.
``My driving helped me get past most of the trouble spots on the fairways,''
said Devers, winner of last week's Malaysian PGA championship.
Senior attributed his low score to a fine putting performance on the front
nine. ``I putted well before the turn, but had a little trouble reading the
grain coming in,'' he said.
66 - C Devers (USA), J Senior (Australia). 67 - L Keng-chi (Taiwan). 68 - D
Boulet (Hong Kong). 69 - S Taylor (USA), D Mijovic (Canada), B Ruangkit
(Thailand), Y Sone (Japan), A Sophon (Thailand).

JOHN Fife's place as Scottish rally championship co-ordinator (see first page)
has been taken by Anne Parker, herself from a rallying family. The series
continues in its unique situation as the only motor-sport championship of its
kind in Britain which, although sponsored, is run entirely by the car clubs
organising the individual events.
The 1996 championship begins with the Snowman Rally on February 10 at
Inverness. The Valentine Rally in Fife and the Trossachs follows on March 9,
and the third-round Granite City Rally on March 30 at Aberdeen is also a
counter in the British national championship.
Argyll provides the forest stages for the Weldex Rally on May 4, and the
international-status Perth Scottish Rally will be a two-day event on May 31 and
June 1.
On July 6, the Jim Clark Memorial Rally in Berwickshire may use closed public
roads. August 17 is the date of the McRae Motorsport Stages Rally in the Tweed
Valley, and the championship finishes with the successor event to the Ayr-based
Weir Toyota Stages Rally on September 21.
Competitors count their best seven scores from the eight rounds. There are 12
subsidiary classes for cars of various engine capacities and stages of
preparation. Additional categories include Juniors, who are drivers under 25 at
the start of the year, and Challengers, drivers of any age who have not
previously finished more than three times in the top ten of a Scottish
championship event.
New for 1996 is a championship for 1300cc cars running on nominated control
tyres. They tackle six events and count five scores.
Fuller details are available from Anne Parker at 1 Strand Court, Auchterarder,
Perthshire PH3 1JE.
More immediate events:
q Sunday: Machars Car Club runs its final 1995 cross-country vehicle trial at
Penkiln Farm, north of Garlieston in Wigtownshire, starting at 10.30. These 4x4
events attract drivers who use off-road vehicles for work and go motor-sporting
with them at weekends, as well as enthusiasts who have built up competition
specials. Peter Vance has already clinched the club 4x4 championship with a
Suzuki, but there are also Lada Nivas, Daihatsus, Subarus and wild devices like
a four-wheel steer Land Rover with a Mini body! Drivers come over from Ireland
to take part.
q Sunday: Closing event of the MG Car Club season is the traditional Old Year
Trial at Bonaly, in the Pentlands foothills. The site will be signposted from
Bonaly Road above Colinton. MGs and other makes of car will take part, and it
is worth noting that anyone wanting to compete can take up a 1996 club
competition licence on the spot, because the licence year runs for 13 months
from December 1. Runs at the first observed hill start at 11.15.

THE Mitsubishi Carisma 1.8-litre GLS is the first car to come as standard with
a Philips Routefinder, writes ROSS FINLAY. This intriguing little gadget is a
demountable electronic navigator.
If you select the starting and finishing points of a planned journey, it will
mull things over - passing the time by showing a little car pottering across
the screen - then come up with navigational instructions for the most direct
route.
These include details like an accurate overall distance, mileages to all the
quoted intermediate points, where any motorway service areas are, and an idea
of how long the journey is likely to take. If you would rather follow an
indirect route, you can avoid motorways or miss out specific locations on the
way.
I happened to be near Braco in Perthshire when I tried it first. Close by on
the directory were Bracora and Bracorina, beside Loch Morar; so this is by no
means just a big-built-up-area device.
The instructions go from junction to junction, stating road numbers where they
exist, and ``local route'' elsewhere. On my imaginary jaunt to Bracora, all the
main junctions were clearly given, while a hotel, the White Corries ski centre
and the Ballachulish bridge were added as checks.
Obviously, the Routefinder is something to be glanced at rather than studied at
length in heavy traffic, and there is a built-in light which I thought was much
too feeble in the dark.

ESCOM, the German computer company which has a factory in Irvine, opened three
more computer shops in Scotland yesterday.
The retail outlets in Glasgow, Dundee, and and Inverness are in addition to two
existing shops in Glasgow. Escom has rapidly expanded its UK retail network
this year.
Following the purchase of the Rumbelow chain in March and the opening of 100
new stores in May, it now operates over 200 shops. A further 50 concessions in
out-of-town Office World shops are due to open in February.
Escom hopes to raise its share of the UK personal computer market to 10% next
year from an estimated 7% at present. Its factory in Irvine opened in 1993 and
employs 300 people.

EUROPEAN Union transport ministers last night gave their final blessing to a
new EU driving licence.
The plastic, credit-card sized licence will replace Britain's bulky paper
document for those who wish to make the change - there is no compulsion - from
July 1, next year.
All other EU member states agreed that the new card would carry a photograph of
the holder but Britain won a derogation on this until the year 2001.
The progress of the debate on a ``compact driving licence'' in Europe has
become entangled with the internal debate in the British Government over the
question of identity cards.
The Home Office is currently considering whether to introduce compulsory ID
cards to combat crime, street disorder, football hooliganism, and illegal
immigration. The idea is opposed by the civil liberties lobby.
Options being considered range from doing nothing to making ID cards compulsory
as they are in some other EU countries already. Britain won its derogation
because it wanted to keep its options on a dual-purpose licence/ID card open.
The licence in other EU member states will not routinely show the nationality
of the holder. It will show merely the country of issue. Britain's will have
the letters UK or GB printed inside the EU's circle of stars.
Mr Neil Kinnock, European Transport Commissioner, resisted the British move. He
has insisted that the harmonised EU licence is not an ID card but Commission
officials said later there had been no major dispute on the issue.

A voice of the sixties which is still being heard brings a certain decadence to
Edinburgh tonight.
MARIANNE Faithfull's media-minders request that interviewers concentrate on her
work in the here-and-now, forsaking reruns of salacious old headlines - Naked
Girl In Rolling Stones' Country-Cottage Drugs Party Shocker - and ancient
questions pertaining to her long-ago role as Lorde Micke of Jagger's blonde
rocke-chicke courtesan.
I fret slightly, pondering whether this is akin to being magically granted an
audience with Cleopatra on two conditions. No queries about Cleo's boyfriend,
Tony What's-His-Face. And please ignore the fact that Cleo's holding yon deadly
snake-thingie to her bosom.
Actually, there's no need to retread oft-tramped lines of inquiry about
swinging-sixties London and Sussex drug-busts. For Marianne herself last year
honestly bared everything there is to bare about her life as Mick's main
squeeze in her autobiography, Faithfull (published by Michael Joseph, #15.99).
It's all there. Early pop stardom. Sexy rompings. Odd leisure-time activities
involving chocolate confectionery (not). Heroin addiction. Artistic rebirth.
A rattling yarn, but somewhat lacking till you've heard bits of it phrased in
that primeval voice of Marianne's, a sinuous mixture of gravel and honey. Last
week I heard those deep, dark tones down the phone. Yum yum.
I'm in Glasgow. Marianne is reclining on a hotel bed in Berlin. Initial
pleasantries having been exchanged, there is a hiatus. Marianne must finish
dismissing a man from her room - hey, no, nothing like that, mucky pup! It's
just the waiter who's appeared, bearing Marianne's mid-morning tea on a tray.
A grandmother who's three weeks short of being 49, Marianne views her
autobiography as ``me old-age pension, dear''. I inform her of her PRs' desire
to obscure her past. She offers reassurance: ``You must ask whatever comes into
your heart or head.''
Music is always in Marianne's heart and head, so we'll start with that,
beginning with Marianne's sole British performance of An Evening In The Weimar
Republic, tonight in Edinburgh's Queen's Hall. Next spring the show should
visit Glasgow. Long-term, Marianne hopes for an Edinburgh Festival berth. So
please explain the ongoing Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill-Marianne Faithfull
three-way tango.
``I was asked to do a weekend of decadent twentieth-century composers,''
Marianne says, before That Voice breaks into a breathy, giggly confession. ``It
was lovely.''
Don't get the wrong idea. They were New York's Brooklyn Academy, the opera
house in which Laurie Anderson got her performing start. Mahler and Hindemith
were two of the alleged twentieth-century decadents. The Brooklyn Philharmonic
handled them. Marianne provided her own well-established Weimar Cabaret, based
on Brecht and Weill.
Hang about, though. Marianne Faithfull and twentieth-century decadence . . . if
I were a lesser man, I might impute a certain tabloid sleaziness.
``Ah, but it's not the MTV definition of decadence. The Nazis and the
Bolsheviks both denounced the art of the Weimar Republic as decadent because it
was Jewish. It was the intellectual flowering of mixed European races, and
therefore racially and ideologically impure.
``And when we hear the word decadent today we're meant to think of evil, but
the Weimar Republic's art wasn't evil. And I don't choose to perform it because
it's decadent and evil, and so therefore I must be decadent and evil.''
A chance invitation led Marianne to sing The Soldier's Wife's Song on a Kurt
Weill tribute album 10 years ago. In turn, that led to her performing The Seven
Deadly Sins, Weill's little operetta for his main squeeze, Lotte Lenya.
Gradually Marianne found that Weill's music was her past, her heritage. For
Marianne Faithfull's family heritage is not the straight
blonde-English-rose-aristo bloodline you might imagine.
``My mother and grandmother were both Jewish, from Vienna, Austro-Hungary, the
decadent Hapsburg Empire. My mother was a little dancer in pre-war Berlin, part
of the corps de ballet, working under Max Rhinehardt, and curtseying `Good
morning, Mr Weill,' as Weill went past.
``She would dance in clubs in the evening, professionally, with a partner. But
then she had to go back to Vienna when the Nazis came to power. And I remember
that she used to whistle The Alabama Song as she cooked when I was a child.''
And you were somehow drawn to the doominess of the pre-war era in which Weill
composed? Music for a lost generation, swept away by the Holocaust . . .
``With hindsight, there's the notion of Weltzschmerz. And a vague idea that the
music survived even though some of its audience didn't. But Weill wasn't
Jewish. And Weill and Lotte Lenya went to America and had a happy life, writing
Broadway musicals, so it wasn't all tragedy.
``And the audiences for his music weren't exclusively Jewish. In fact, Weill's
work was funny, witty, ironic, written by a man who was fascinated by the US
and by jazz, by syncopation.
``So much so that he wasn't considered as serious a composer as Schoenberg.
Using a brass section, jazz rhythms, and orchestration hadn't been done before.
Weill's was merely dance music. The Threepenny Opera was judged a light work.
``Plus What Became Of The Soldier's Wife was written as an anti-war song in
1943 when Brecht and Weill were both in Santa Monica, hating it, and hearing
news of the siege of Stalingrad and feeling tremendous sadness for the deaths
of millions of their countrymen, not just Jews but ordinary soldiers, not
big-cheese Nazis . . . I say all this in my show, actually. It's evident that
both my parents were teachers.''
And you have lectured on music, too.
``I did three years of summer schools, giving songwriting seminars at a school
of meditation in Boulder, Colorado, run by Allen Ginsberg. I still have the
laminated pass which says that I am a professor at the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics. I'm very proud of that. But I think rather than me
teaching, meditation meant I learned. I learned tolerance, compassion,
acceptance of other people's idiocies. And my own.''
Learned rock academics are reaching more fully-rounded verdicts on your solo
career, it seems, too. According to one such you are a demi-monde chanteuse
with a Gauloise-rich, uningratiating voice and an intelligence which few had
suspected.
``God! They've rethought their shit since the last time I looked in one of
those music encyclopaedias! The older ones write as though I'm going to be dead
any minute. I'm seen as the twit, the victim, when I'm no more a victim than
anyone else.
``But `uningratiating' is interesting. As for the rest, it's a back-handed sort
of compliment . . . pretty women can only be whores and fools. An intelligence
few had suspected . . . but I suppose I never did give much away, did I?''
Of course, Marianne Faithfull hasn't always coped quite so airily with
slighting criticism. ``When I was younger, I coped not very well. It hurt me
terribly. To the point of being suicidal. But as you get older, you take the
bull by the horns. `I'll assume you think this because you don't know me. I'll
let you know me, and then see what you think.' ''
Does Marianne Faithfull have any regrets?
``Not really. I wish I hadn't done heroin. I could have done without that.
There are things about my character I'd change. I'd like to be more loving . .
. to show the people I love that I love them. And I wish I'd been a better
mother to Nicholas, although I have a good relationship with him now. Better
than I could have wished for.
``He's forgiven me. I haven't. Yet. But I hope I can . . . I will. Yes.''

<TEXT>
THE Bank of France cut its key intervention rate yesterday and gave a boost to
financial markets and the economy that were sagging because of a two-week
strike of transport and other public service workers.
After a meeting of its monetary policy council, the bank reduced the
intervention rate, which sets a floor to money market rates, to 4.70% from
4.80%.
The decision pleased financial markets, where traders had feared authorities
might raise rates to defend the franc against weakness caused by the crippling
anti-austerity strikes.
The CAC-40 share market index rose 12.05 to close at 1846.80. Bonds also turned
positive while the franc remained steady.
Economists were surprised by the move but they said it was an economically
justified vote of support for the conservative French government's fiscal
policies. The size of the cut made it more of a symbol than anything else, they
said, but emphasised it was a powerful symbol.

The Governor of the Bank of England outlines his reasons for the Chancellor to
tread carefully
BANK of England Governor Eddie George warned MPs yesterday that there was a
great deal of uncertainty about whether or not the Government was on course to
hit its sub-2.5% inflation target.
But he conceded that the outlook had improved since May, when he unsuccessfully
tried to persuade Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to increase rates.
``I would have to say that the uncertainty is as great now as I can remember
for some time,'' Mr George told the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee.
In the City, this was seen as an indication that he would advise the Chancellor
not to cut rates on Wednesday.
Mr Clarke's upbeat assessment of the economy - which he predicted in November's
Budget would grow by 3% next year - suggests he will agree with Mr George's
advice.
Mr George cited three reasons why uncertainty about inflation had increased
since May. He said there was a danger of pay rises taking off if the benchmark
Ford deal, in which the unions are asking for a 10% increase, was successful.
That would be a ``very serious development,'' he said.
Mr George said there was also continued concern about the weakness of the
pound, which pushes up import costs.
Worries remained about the strength of M4, the broad measure of the money
supply, which includes cash in circulation and bank and building society
deposits. It is currently hovering near the top of its 3% to 9% monitoring
range.
Earlier, Mr George agreed that Mr Clarke's decision to reject his advice in May
had had a ``happy outcome'' in the short run but said it had had a cost for the
economy in the long term. By being seen not to err on the side of caution,
suspicions about the UK's lack of commitment to price stability had been fanned.
This was reflected in the weakness of the pound on the foreign exchanges and
higher rates of return demanded by investors for buying government bonds.
Matthew Carrington, Conservative MP for Fulham, asked about the Treasury's
prediction that growth in the G7 countries - the world's leading industrial
nations - would drop from 3% to 2.5% next year.
He said: ``This is quite a significant drop when we are expecting our growth
rate to pick up.''
Mr George replied: ``It certainly is another issue, another considerable area
of uncertainty.''
He added that the G7 forecast was a sensible assumption to make but said it
would be a surprise for the British economy to go up while the G7 economies
went down in the long term.
Mr George also claimed the domestic housing market would improve, but suggested
that houses would never again be the worthwhile financial investment they were
a decade ago.
He said: ``For decades housing was not just somewhere where people lived, it
was a financial investment and in fact for most people it was the biggest and
best financial investment they made in their lives.
``In terms of the perception of houses as a financial asset, I think that is
changing.
And he added: ``People are less likely to buy houses as a financial investment
rather than as somewhere which provides housing services.''

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S gross domestic product stagnated in the third quarter of 1995 while
unemployment surged in November, figures out yesterday showed.
The data prompted economists to call on the country's powerful Bundesbank to
cut interest rates and stimulate the economy.
German GDP was unchanged in the third quarter of 1995 from the second and was
1.5% higher than the same quarter of 1994, the Federal Statistics Office said.
The year-on-year rise was the weakest since the fourth quarter of 1993. In the
second quarter, GDP had risen 1% from the previous quarter and was 2.2% up from
the second quarter of 1994.
The office said the weakness in third-quarter GDP was largely due to weak
capital investment and construction. Stockbuilding by firms was strong.
The ministry described the figures as representing a ``clear slowdown'' in the
economy blaming the strong rise in the value of the mark earlier this year,
high wage rounds in the spring and higher taxes.
The ministry said pan-German growth for 1995 would probably only be around 2%
as the Council of Economic Advisers, known as the ``Five Wise Men'' forecast
recently.
Unemployment rose by 42,000 after seasonal adjustment in November to over 3.7
million, its fourth rise in a row, the Federal Labour Office said. The rise was
much worse than economists had expected.
The jobless rate rose by 1% to 9.7% in October. The Office said seasonally
adjusted west German unemployment rose by 23,000 to 2.62 million while in the
east, unemployment rose 19,000 to 1.1 million.
The number of part-time workers in Germany rose to 211,000 from 179,000 in
October while vacancies fell to 273,000 from 289,000 a month earlier.
Economists said taken together, the data showed the economy was weaker than
believed and appealed to the Bundesbank to cut rates.
``Lower rates would be the most important support for the economy in 1996,''
said Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Frankfurt's Dresdner Bank.
He said this would stimulate the economy more effectively than next January's
tax cuts.
``The case for a discount rate cut is almost unanswerable,'' said Julian Jessop
of HSBC Markets in London.
Mr Jessop said the sharp fall in capital investment in the third quarter was in
line with ``gloomy business surveys'' and a recent dip in capacity
utilisation.-Reuter

THE spectre of Linford Christie and Colin Jackson bickering about money and
declining to compete in important British meetings cast a shadow over a
revolutionary initiative launched yesterday by the Scottish Athletics
Federation.
The SAF unveiled 25 athletes being put under contract as part of a new athlete
and coach support programme designed to increase the number of Scots in British
teams, and improve the status of Scots in UK rankings at all levels.
Members of the so-called performance management group will be eligible for
grants for warm weather and altitude training, medical support, and advice on
sports science, psychology, physiology, and nutrition.
The Scottish Sports Council has provided #35,000 to look after the squad, and a
further #12,000 for scientific back-up.
The council invested a substantial sum in preparing the Commonwealth Games
squad, but concludes that in future, this will be a better way of using their
funds.
SAF has been faster off the mark than their UK counterparts. The British
federation is still attempting to sign up their main athletes to prevent the
friction which kept Olympic sprint champion Christie out of major UK meetings
last summer, and led to a damaging split with world hurdles record-holder
Jackson.
BAF's failure to resolve their contractual problems has put the signing of the
Scots on hold.
``Scots law is different from English, but the two sets of contracts have to be
compatible,'' explained Jim Scott, chairman of the Scottish performance
management group which will be managed by national coach Andy Vince.
Vince believes the project should prevent the national vest, being stigmatised,
in recent years, as he put it: ``as almost a free gift from a Cornflakes
packet.''
In return for being given a share of what, after all, is public money, the
squad will be expected to support promotional initiatives (like come-and-try
days), grass-roots development programmes, and marketing opportunities for
sponsors.
More importantly, SAF expects them to participate in national championships and
be available for matches where these do not conflict with UK interests. They
will also be expected to sign a code of conduct similar to that adopted in golf
and tennis.
``If they break the code, there will be repercussions,'' said Scott, who, as
SAF treasurer is acutely aware of the need for the best athletes at
championships to secure sponsorship. He insisted SAF will be reasonable over
other commitments: ``There is no question of forcing athletes to compete.''
As Europa Cup 400 metres champion Neef acknowledged: ``We'd just have a sudden
cold, or an illness.''
The only athlete among the 25 likely to be offered a BAF contract, Neef added:
``I don't see any conflict of interest, and if SAF is going to deliver these
benefits, I see nothing wrong in them asking us for something in return.''
Yvonne Murray, Liz McColgan, Tom McKean, Brian Whittle, and Tom Hanlon, the
most successful Scots of recent years, were left out on the basis that it is a
development initiative. More curious is the omission of UK marathon
international, Karen Macleod.
Olympic contender Macleod was furious. Fourth in the last Commonwealth marathon
alone should have got her on the squad, she believes. So, too, should selection
by Britain for the last world and European championships, as might being ranked
second in Britain to McColgan at the half marathon this year.
Her husband and coach, John Davies, said last night: ``Karen finished second in
the UK 10,000m road championships, to Vikki McPherson - who is in the squad -
then ran 40 seconds faster the following week - all while recovering fom injury.
``Her performances were achieved before the selection meeting on October 17.
These people are obviously totally out of touch, and we are clearly wasting our
time. Karen has spent a lot on treatment of a foot injury. It would have been
nice to be recognised.''
Great Britain international walkers Martin Bell and Verity Snook may also feel
they have grounds for complaint, as aleady indicated by road and track runner
Glen Stewart.
Vince promised the system will operate ``like a revolving door'' with constant
reassessment. This not only puts pressure on the individuals to deliver, but on
the whole squad.
The Sports Council is unlikely to continue backing the programme if objectives
are not met, though Vince believes that with the average age of squad members
being 21, the long-term benefits will not be fully apparent for six years.
Squad:
Women: Mel Neef, Allison Curbishley (400 metres), Lorna Jackson and Joanne
Walker (javelin), Sinead Dudgeon (200m), Allison Grey (shot), Vikki McPherson
(10,000m), Aileen McGillivary (100m), Ruth Irvine (long/triple jumps).
Men: Ken Campbell, Ross Baillie (110m hurdles), Ally Donaldson, Des Roache,
Andy Young (800m), Charles Robertson-Adams, Barry Middleton (400m hurdles),
Duncan Mathieson, Jamie Quarry (decathlon/long jump), Stephan Hayward (shot),
Darren Ritchie (long jump), Doug Walker, Ian Mackie (200m), Chris Robison
(10,000m/cross-country), R Quinn (cross-contry), T Murray (cross-country/hill
running).

FOR the third time in 11 years the Ryder Cup team has won the Association of
Golf Writers' Trophy, awarded annually ``to the person or persons, born or
resident in Europe, who have made the outstanding contribution to golf during
the preceding 12 months.''
The achievement of the 12-man side, captained by Bernard Gallacher for the
third and last time, in becoming only the second in the history of the match to
beat the United States on their own soil, gained overwhelming recognition
despite the strong credentials of several other candidates who helped to make
the 1995 season one of the most exceptional on record.
Yet, in face of the unique feat of Sweden's Annika Sorenstam of leading the
women's professional money lists on both sides of the Atlantic; Colin
Montgomerie's third successive year as winner of the European order of merit;
and Britain and Ireland's defeat of the United States in the Walker Cup match,
the Oak Hill triumph attracted almost 70% of the votes cast by the AGW
membership.
Yesterday, in expressing his appreciation, Gallacher, who will receive the
trophy at the Association's annual dinner during next year's Open Championship
at Royal Lytham and St Annes, said: ``I hope all the players can be there
because it was a real team effort that enabled us to bring the cup home. But
I'm so delighted I can hand the cup on to my successor, as Tony Jacklin handed
it to me.
``Some people are saying that it was a greater achievement than the 1987 win at
Muirfield Village. All I would say is that they were both great because eight
years ago we broke the duck on their patch and this year because we came from
behind in the singles, where in the past the Americans have been at their
strongest.''
q WITH American golf ``all shook up'' by this season's loss of both Ryder and
Walker Cups, it was perhaps not surprising that more people watched the
practice workouts of Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus than the actual play of
the regular but duller tour pros like Tom Kite, Payne Stewart, and Lee Janzen
at the Diners Club matches in Palm Springs, California, yesterday, writes John
Ball.
Nicklaus, now 55, has always maintained that a great deal more of the kind of
matchplay here would benefit the USA's international performances, as it did in
his college and Walker Cup days. He and Palmer (66) take on last year's senior
winners Ray Floyd and Dave Eichelberger today.
Meanwhile, Kite, 46 tomorrow, played beautifully to give himself and Billy
Andrade a one-hole lead after six holes against Fred Funk and Blaine
McCallister.
Last year's winners Jeff Maggert and Jim McGovern were two down after 10 to
Kirk Triplett and Steve Stricker while in the most entertaining match the
former US Open champions Stewart and Janzen were all square after five against
Paul Azinger and Phil Mickelson.
Britain's Laura Davies tees off today with her friend Mardi Lunn and her big
hitting will illicit the usual cries of approval from American spectators who
love to watch this female John Daly.
q LEADING first round scores in the Daikyo Open in Onnason yesterday (Japanese
unless noted):
66 - T Sugihara, H Hamano.
67 - B Watts (USA), N Serizawa, H Meshiai, T Nakamura.

DARIUS Guppy, disgraced friend of Earl Spencer, was freed on bail yesterday
after being given leave to appeal against a jail term for refusing to pay
compensation for a bogus gems robbery.
Mr Justice May, at the High Court, allowed bail on condition of a #200,000
surety and that he stay at his home address.
Mr Spenser Hilliard, Guppy's counsel, said after the hearing that Guppy had
finished his five-year sentence for staging the bogus robbery but was now
appealing against a three-year sentence for failing to comply with a
compensation order.
In April, Guppy lost his appeal against the five-year sentence but fines of
#539,000 were cut to #227,000 and converted into a compensation order in favour
of Lloyd's insurers who were defrauded when they paid up #1.8m for the bogus
gems robbery.
Guppy was told to pay the money within three months or serve the extra three
years.
Guppy, 30, of Notting Hill, was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court in March
1993 for conspiracies to defraud, steal, and commit false accounting and VAT
offences.
In 1990, the Old Etonian who was best man to Earl Spencer at his wedding,
conned insurers for compensation after faking an armed robbery of a #1.8m
jewellery collection in a New York hotel room. His business associate, Benedict
Marsh, was jailed for five years and similarly fined.
They paid Peter Risdon, an acquaintance, #10,000 to stage a bogus raid,
stealing gems from their hotel safe and leaving them tied up on their beds.
Last April, the judge said he believed Guppy still had access to ``ill-gotten
gains''.

IN some ways Dundee has been a deprived area with regards to the availability
of international standard sporting facilities but that will change dramatically
with the input of #1!sm of lottery money towards the redevelopment of the
Maryfield complex.
The Tayside centre is set to become the envy of hockey enthusiasts all over
Scotland for, apart from the building of two new artificial pitches, it will
also have an indoor arena.
Stephen Cumming, the Midlands secretary, now sees a bright future for the sport
in the area. ``With Dundee being the central city of Scotland it gives us a
great opportunity of attracting some of the major international tournaments,''
he pointed out.
As Maryfield will be the only facility in Scotland with two artificial pitches
on site, Dundee must now be favourite to become the centre for hockey in
Scotland.
Peffermill, in Edinburgh, has long been the principle contender for that honour
but, as there are no plans for an indoor facility at the complex, Maryfield
looks a much better bet.
The main interest in the men's indoor league this weekend will be focused on
the Bells Sport Centre in Perth where the second division will hold centre
stage.
Clydesdale presently occupy pole position but Stepps look menacing in second
place.

THE first meeting of the season between defending champions Edinburgh Ladies
and Western Klick Photopoint in the indoor league at Meadowbank tomorrow could,
if history repeats itself, have a vital bearing on the destination of the
trophy.
The winners of the opening encounter have always gone one to lift the title.
But the situation may be a little clouded as neither side is able to put out
its recognised side.
Great Britain restrictions have deprived Edinburgh of two of their key players,
Diane Renilson and Pauline Robertson. Western's Susan MacDonald is also out for
the same reason, while examinations also cost them Gail Crawford.
On this occasion, however, Western appear to have the upper hand. They will
have Wendy Fraser directing operations but, equally important, they have Ellen
Murray and Sheena McKelvie in brilliant form.
The form of Hyndland in the opening series of games was disappointing but,
according to Sharon Duncan, who is playing the best hockey of her career,
``that was only a temporary setback''.
Bonagrass Grove finished second last weekend at the Montrouge tournament in
Paris but their aspirations could rest on the outcome of their matches against
Edinburgh Ladies and Western.

There's more to shop-assisting than meets the eye, especially over the festive
period, finds Joan Grady
GOOD Christian men rejoice . . . but retail workers are shaking in their shoes.
The Christmas shopping season is revving up to full throttle, and with spending
expected to be very similar to last year's, the sense of dread emanating from
High Street stores is almost tangible.
Not from the retailers, however. A survey carried out by management consultants
Touche Ross of more than 100 top UK retailers and 1430 consumers shows that
retailers are expecting a Christmas spending rise of 6%. Consumers don't quite
agree.
``There are many mismatches between what consumers say they will do and what
retailers are predicting,'' says Touche Ross partner Ralph Adams.
``Contrary to the forecasts of the retailers, most consumers expect to spend
the same or only slightly more than last year. The average expected spending
increase is only 1%.''
Retailers also think more consumers will be shopping in out-of-town centres and
from catalogues, while consumers are convinced their shopping patterns will not
change - which might bring a sigh of relief from the bosses; but how do staff
cope with the extra pressures Christmas brings?
It has long been thought that working in retail takes only the minimum of
training. New staff are thrown in at the deep end and expected to pick up the
system of an operation which has been functioning effectively for the best part
of a century in half-an-hour.
Knowing how a store works takes time - and ladies fashion retailer Jaeger gives
its staff that time to learn the ropes before asking them to cope with the
extra pressures of busy seasons.
``We don't take on Christmas staff,'' says branch manager Wilma Allardice. ``We
have a permanent part-time worker who comes in as and when we need her.
Temporary staff just don't give the customer what Jaeger is all about.
``We do a lot of on-the-job training, and try to build up mentally to busy
periods - then we're halfway prepared. We know it's going to be a long, hard
slog through December, but we also know that we just have to get through it.''
Preparation does improve staff performance. Many retail staff are not prepared,
and are therefore taken aback by their first experience of Christmas shopping
from the other side of the counter.
They need to know a lot more than how to wield a broom, hang up fallen clothes
or punch figures into a cash register. Jaeger's commitment to training takes
all members of staff to London twice a year.
``Every six months we take all our girls down to London to learn about the
company,'' says Mrs Allardice. ``They learn about our products and stock - they
have to. It's a particular kind of selling, a very involved selling, and they
have to know what they're doing.''
Marks &amp; Spencer favours the more traditional approach. It provides on-the-job,
in-house training under the watchful eye of a more experienced supervisor.
Staff take part in an induction day, which involves getting around the store,
fire and safety rules, cash training, and basic customer service.
Staff do not receive extra training for Christmas, but there is a support
network if things get too much.
``Christmas is definitely our busiest time of the year, and the staff are under
pressure,'' says Sue Sadler, corporate press officer. ``We have personnel and
medical teams if the stress gets too much.
``The majority of our staff have already experienced it, however, and will know
how to cope and help our new members. There's no additional training.''
In my first job - part-time seasonal staff for a well-known retail outlet,
training was minimal but everything was fine - until the Christmas crowds
started rolling in.
The ensuing melee, which lasted throughout December and January, was
overwhelming. Even with four working at each till, the queues were enormous. If
you think those customer service queues look frightening when you're waiting in
them, you should see them from the other side.
Apart from making life easier for staff, training also improves customer
service. While The Disney Store's HQ in London thought it ``wouldn't be
interested in divulging that sort of information'',  a little tweety bird tells
me its American-style training is rigorous. Staff must know where to be, when
to be there, and what to do when they get there. Not a lot of fun, but being on
top of the job makes both the working and shopping experiences a great deal
easier for everyone.

<HEADLINE>Flexible labour `is costing real jobs'</HEADLINE>

A DAMNING indictment of employment practices in the nineties, with permanent
full-time jobs being steadily phased out in favour of part-time and temporary
work, mainly to the detriment of employees, has emerged from new studies
commissioned by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
The growth in the so-called flexible labour market has many advantages for
employers but few for employees, particularly women, whose experience of
flexible working tends to involve being low-paid with few chances of promotion
or training.
EOC researchers found that the use of part-time and temporary workers had
increased ``substantially'' in the past five years, with women doing most of
the jobs.
Part-time work traditionally has been seen as helping women to combine home and
employment. However, research by Industrial Relations Services for the EOC
found that employers now tend to use part-time workers for commercial rather
than equal-opportunity reasons and that temporary and casual jobs are growing
at the expense of permanent posts.
Two out of five women of working age have a part-time job compared to one in 10
men, with much of the work being low paid.
Around 390,000 women - 4% of the total - have two part-time jobs, according to
the report.
In higher-status jobs the ``long hours culture'' prevented women from gaining
promotion, forcing them to work long hours for low pay to make ends meet. Even
when women do win promotion, the status of their managerial role is often
downgraded from that previously carried out by men.
Ms Kamlesh Bahl, the commission's chairwoman, said flexible working should be
good news for everyone trying to combine work and family responsibilities.
``However, we realise that flexibility also has its downside and we want to
find ways of overcoming this. We want to see equality of opportunity in
business strategies so that every business can make better use of all its human
resources to remain competitive. Equality has to be at the heart of the
workplace agenda.''

AM I alone in being horrified at the deliberate destruction of the beef trade
in the name of consumer protection?
The media wheel out bizarre specialists periodically to air their own
far-fetched theories about BSE and the dangers to humans thereof along with
unproven links with CJD, all glorying in the limelight of creating a story.
A clutch of fearful women profess to ``be done with beef for good'' because it
might harm their kids.
But has anyone pointed out to those same women that smoking, especially in
pregnancy, and passive smoking will definitely harm their kids; alcohol
dependency will harm the family; unprotected casual sex can lead to HIV
infection; and a diet ``rich'' in sweets, Cokes, chocolates, and ice-cream will
not only rot their their teeth but ultimately their guts as well?
Earnest do-gooders proclaim that 30 CJD deaths in two or three years are quite
intolerable while 50,000 dead and injured on the roads are quite acceptable,
but no-one suggests banning the motor-car!
Where are the NFU in all this while local authorities and private schools ban
the use of beef? Is it beyond them to promote a balanced view and get this
whole wretched business in perspective? Talk about fiddling while Rome burns!
Just the simple fact that red meat, especially beef, is one of the richest
sources of dietary iron readily available and easily assimilated by a child's
digestive system, needs to be given far more publicity.
There is a question of balance and probabilities. Every single scaremonger and
``Concerned parent of Bearsden'' will definitely be indulging in something
potentially more harmful than beef.
Renewing my subscription to the NFU in these circumstances is clearly an act of
faith, even if divorced from business sense.

I READ your report (December 4) of the transfer of Strathmashie forest to
community control and the hands of the people of Laggan, with delight and
relief.
As a very callow young forester, I had the privilege of starting Strathmashie
in 1952, and recall vividly the expectations we had for it, and what it could
do for the district. Within a few years we had built a dozen houses (though in
the wrong site - they should have been added to the village) and employed over
20 men with planting and maintenance work.
That was just to be a beginning. We had great visions of when we started
producing timber from thinnings, and the expansion of labour demands that would
entail.
I go back there occasionally. Laggan was a magical place for me, and still is.
Above all, I wanted to see the thinnings start, and during one visit, met the
last survivor of ``the good old days''.
He confirmed that thinning had actually started, but then said: ``Mr Carlaw,
don't go to see it, it will break your heart''.
He was right. It looked as though the forest had been shelled. If that was
thinning, God save forestry. From having a resident forester and staff, not one
of the forestry houses holds a forestry worker in it. Not one man is now
employed at Strathmashie.
Supervision is I believe from Aviemore, and I can only guess at how frequent
and close this is, but if someone tells me it's non-existent, that will be no
surprise.
I do not blame the Forestry Commission for this dereliction, they can only
pander to the standards of this ostensibly Conservative Government, who have
not the slightest interest in anything other than the destruction of State
forestry.
When I think of the esprit de corps, the unpaid hours of work we all cheerfuly
put in, and how all this effort is nullified by a bunch of political
prostitutes masquerading as a Government, I could weep.
It will be interesting to see whether a financial arrangement can be made,
which will allow Laggan to assume control of the forest, but the idea of
Michael Forsyth changing into the regalia of Santa Claus stretches my
incredulity to breaking point.

SINGULARLY the most significant problem currently affecting British beef
consumption is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or ``mad-cow'' disease
as it has become more colloquially known.
Continually the Department of Health and the Chief Medical Officer have
persisted with the view that BSE cannot be transmitted to humans through the
consumption of beef. From where have they derived this evidence and what
scientific basis do they have for making this statement?
The problem with BSE and other TSEs (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies)
is that the molecular mechanism of transmission still remains relatively
obscure and, as yet, the link between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)
is unclear.
Recent advances in molecular biology have started to ``unlock'' the elusive
nature of BSE and its transmission, albeit this work is at an early stage.
Research at the University of California, San Francisco, has identified
specialised proteins, known as ``prions'', which are thought to act
co-operatively with other proteins in the mechanisms associated with
transmission of BSE. If this work is correct then the basis of transmission may
finally be elucidated at some point in the future.
Clearly CJD is a matter of concern to the public; at the moment the scientific
fraternity knows much about the pathology of the disease but comparatively
little about its transmission.
Furthermore, since BSE and CJD are caused by what are thought to be ``slow''
viruses, it is difficult to estimate the time- course over which the first
outward manifestations of the disease may become evident, if it is transmitted
from cattle to humans.
Unquestionably, BSE and CJD pose numerous questions as to their origin and
transmission. Is there a hereditary basis to CJD? Do environmental factors play
a role in these neurodegenerative diseases? Is transmission from cattle to
humans the major route of transmission?
Since these pertinent scientific questions still remain largely unanswered
maybe the Department of Health would consider funding further research in these
fields instead of squandering money on full-page public health warnings in
national broadsheets.

I WAS amazed that unnamed members of the CBI in Scotland were given so much
publicity (December 6) without ``coming out'', until I reflected on the
situation.
Given that the tide of public opinion has swung firmly in favour of
constitutional change, and many business people are now finding the confidence
to support change, it is perhaps inevitable that we should see such an
attempted retrogressive coup at CBI Scotland.
However, their efforts and their methods are worthy of close scrutiny by the
Scottish people, and we should present them with a list of questions, in
keeping with their plans for Tony Blair. These could include:-
Do they view Scotland as some kind of Kazakhstan dependent on ``Mother
England''?
Do they wish to continue to subordinate Scotland's relationship with Europe
downstream of Westminster?
Do the business concepts of down-sizing, focus, empowerment, and management
buy-outs not apply to something as important as a nation?
Will they be entirely happy, once their names are known, about continuing
scrutiny of their personal and corporate motivation?
Will they accept a lower priority on grants from a Scottish government given
their latent tendency to ``quit Scotland``?
My own view is that this is an attempt to blackmail the aspirations of the
Scottish people, and as such it should be faced down. Scotland with increasing
power to determine our economic future in Europe will attract replacements for
any withdrawals, and will be able to generate a ``can-do'' self-help confident
culture that will energise business and individuals.
It will be interesting to see if the Scottish Council of the CBI can handle
this attempt to railroad policy, and whether the ``leading companies'' and
their spokespersons deign to name themselves.
Indeed it will be interesting to see if CBI Scotland starts to plan for a time
when, in line with the creation of a devolved Scottish parliament, it creates
the Confederation of Scottish Industry.

AS the managing director of a medium-size management company I am becoming
increasingly concerned about the implications of the minimum wage with regard
to small businesses.
I fail to understand how the introduction of a minimum wage will lead to
anything other than a huge increase in unemployment levels, particularly among
the young.
For any company to be competitive, it must keep a tight rein on the amount of
money it pays its staff. The one common factor with most companies which pay
salaries above the market rate is that sooner or later they go bust, thus
placing all their employees on the dole.
It is not for Government to dictate what a particular job function may or may
not be worth. Someone's wage is not a reflection of their worth, it is a
reflection of the financial return they generate, directly or indirectly, for
the company that employs them.
Someone of similar ability in a different job to which they are better suited
may earn twice as much.
John Prescott calls for full employment, which is a sentiment we all support in
theory. The trouble is we live in the real world where we have to find
practical solutions to everyday problems.
The Labour Party's solution to unemployment is to introduce the minimum wage at
a yet to be determined level. If this is the solution why is it that countries
which have already tried John Prescott's solution of the minimum wage have
unemployment levels so much higher than our own?
In Britain the unemployment level is 8.3% of the population, in Scotland 8.1%,
yet in Belgium, France, and Spain the unemployment levels are 14.9%, 11.4%, and
22.7% respectively, all of them merrily putting into practice Mr Prescott's
solution of the minimum wage.
The Labour Party should re-examine its policies on employment, drop the minimum
wage, and come up with a practical solution that will create jobs and
investment similar to the 3300 new jobs created in Lanarkshire by the Taiwanese
company Chunghwa.

BUS deregulation throughout the country has proved not to be the panacea for
the travelling public for whom it was intended.
Now that the police are calling for stricter limits on potential drunk drivers
and encouraging them to use public transport over the festive period, ask
yourself some questions about the bus company you travel with.
Do they provide a service outwith normal working hours? Will they be there to
bring you home from your party night? Do they exist only to exploit the popular
market? Do they exploit their employees by paying low wages with little
training and few career opportunities? Can the local community and particularly
the elderly depend on them? Is your safety their priority?
What is needed is a properly funded, regulated public transport system that
answers all these questions satisfactorily.

IN my recent letter I shared some of my experiences while travelling on the
InterCity West Coast line, particularly the failure of the system to ensure
connections following the splitting up of the whole network into smaller
companies.
Weary of the misadventures on the West Coast line, my wife and I transferred
our custom on an experimental basis to the long-distance coach services from
Glasgow provided by National Express. We have been most impressed with the
service.
Out of 14 journeys over the last eight months we have had punctual arrivals in
all but two; the coaches are clean and comfortable; pleasant staff in general;
service a little slower than the train but at a fraction of the price - and no
cancellations.
The service seems to work. A glib analyst might suggest this is because it is
privatised, but it is more fundamental than that. It is because National
Express operates a single, unified network covering the whole of England and
Wales, and, in association with Scottish Citylink, the extremes of Scotland as
well.

IN response to the letter headed Air monopoly to Amsterdam (December 6), I
believe that the author should consider the facts.
The Scotland to Amsterdam route is currently one of the most important European
routes for business travellers to and from Scotland.
With an investment that is unmatched by any other domestic carrier, Air UK has
provided this service since the company's inception in 1980. Services are now
operated daily from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow airports.
Far from operating a monopoly as suggested by J D McLaren, Air UK has faced
intense competition since its inception and its successful operation is based
on both a highly efficient and quality conscious service.
More and more passengers are also choosing to fly to and from Scotland to
Amsterdam Schiphol due to our interline link with KLM - a European business
partnership which allows our customers to connect to KLM's ``wave'' system of
flights to over 150 worldwide destinations.
The lack of competition is not due to monopoly conditions but rather the
inability of any operator, to date, to provide a better service on these routes.

HAVING passed many people sporting the red ribbon to mark empathy for Aids
sufferers and later having watched television on which almost every person also
wore the red ribbon, it came as a breath of fresh air to read J P Leach's
article in which he blew the cool air of proportion on political correctness
(December 2).
Of course people who have Aids suffer, but for the population in general
avoiding unprotected homosexual sex and sharing needles if taking drugs will
protect them.
Involved as I am with people who have Marfan's Syndrome, with higher death
figures than Aids, I wonder often how to grab public awareness for a syndrome
which can also be passed on in the womb but which does not allow the sufferers
the luxury of avoiding it through lifestyle.

THE cautious and slightly jaded responses by both the SNP and Labour to the
community ownership initiative by the Secretary of State over Strathmashie
Forest are understandable if regrettable (December 5).
It seems that in the hurry to mitigate any potential political gains which
might be made, these parties have forgotten the immense boost this initiative
will give to both the confidence and economic security of people in this
fragile place.
The crisis of living in sparsely populated areas with the constant reality of
economic sustainability and environmental fragility seems to have been lost in
the welter of complaint against what is a bold, timely and imaginative move.
The impact of the 15 jobs, the securing of local forestry skills and competence
and the celebration of hope this will give to the people of Laggan will be
enormous.
It would seem too early for electioneering and too congruent to the Secretary
of State's oft-declared position on power decentralisation to be called
anything else other than welcome.
For the people of Laggan this is their Millennium Forest: and I suspect it
hasn't come a moment too early for them.

A NIGERIAN yesterday won a last-minute reprieve from being deported from
Britain.
Solicitors representing Mr Ade Onibiyo, 19, were granted five working days to
seek leave to move for judicial review of the decision to expel him.
Home Office Minister Ann Widdecombe said any application for judicial review
would be contested. Mr Onibiyo's removal has been rescheduled for December 14.
Campaigners have argued that Mr Onibiyo will be in serious danger if he is
returned to Nigeria. His 53-year-old father, Abdul, was deported to Lagos in
October and has not been in contact with his wife and five children since.
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth for executing nine activists,
including dissident writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, last month.
The country will be expelled in two years unless there are major human rights
improvements.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S economy is likely to grow less than 2% next year after four years of
negligible growth, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) said today.
The Paris-based think tank predicted in an economic survey of Japan that gross
domestic product (GDP) would grow 1.8% in calendar 1996 after estimated growth
of 0.3% this year.
It revised downward its June forecasts of 2.3% growth in 1996 and 1.3% in 1995,
citing the yen's sharp rally in earlier this year as a factor in an ``aborted
recovery''. ``The economy is experiencing an exceptionally long period of
depressed activity, as hopes of a recovery, evident in 1994, did not fully
materialise,'' said the report.
Tokyo was not happy with the forecasts, saying that the OECD appeared to have
underestimated the stimulative effect of a government economic package
announced in September.
Japan will set a growth target of more than 2% for the business year starting
next April, government sources said.-Reuter

Planning a festive
party? `Bring on the the experts' is the theme as corporate hospitality
becomes big business at this time of year, says Francis Shennan
IT'S party time and, for companies, throwing a bad Christmas party is worse
than no party at all. Used properly, the right social occasion can help to
build or cement relationships with customers, suppliers or staff.
But just as no other part of business relationships would be entrusted to
amateurs, entertaining guests is increasingly entrusted to professionals. No
matter how professional the managing director's secretary is, it does not make
her a good party-giver, regardless of her private life.
Helping people to relax, to mix, to enjoy themselves is a skill and the more
important the people the more essential it is to achieve. Hence the growth of
the corporate hospitality industry.
The image of the industry is still largely one of the marquees arranged around
a sporting event like the camp of a marauding army, filled with executives
being filled in turn with food and drink. The potential for those with the
locations to host events was quickly spotted.
Hotels, conference centres, universities and colleges, football clubs, even
buildings such as Glasgow's Museum of Transport, can earn income from corporate
hospitality. But location is not enough. Guests need to be entertained, and the
corporate entertainment business grew accordingly.
``It's building up: I have a lot more people booked this year than last year,''
says Alison Low, who started Premier Leisure Scotland Ltd five years ago.
She books the Strathclyde Suite at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and then
organises evenings for companies such as ScottishPower, Scottish Mutual,
Scottish Prudential and Scottish Provincial. ``The majority of people I have
coming along are people who would otherwise be booked into a hotel,'' she says.
Her evenings, attended by up to 330 people, include a three-course dinner,
disco, ceilidh band and entertainment casino provided by Top Hat (see separate
story).
``There is something for everyone,'' she says. ``The thing about the casino is
that guests get to meet people. They are all from different places and they get
to meet and talk over the tables.''
Corporate entertainers and organisers have to understand the business needs of
their clients. The entertainment must be professional yet must not intrude too
much into the opportunities for guests to meet and talk.
``They want flexible entertainment which will not overshadow the opportunity to
network,'' says Dusty the Magician, also known as Bill Miller, senior events
consultant for The Entertainment Company which provides entertainment to all
Scotland's major five-and four-star hotels.
``The last thing clients want to feel is that they are coming there for a hard
sell. Magic is a wonderful medium because it is so flexible. It can be a
two-minute or a 20-minute show. People like a laugh and I use magic as a
vehicle for all-round entertainment.
``You can tailor the act to a customer's product or message. The cards which I
make reappear in a guest's pocket can carry a message like `The Magic of Esso'
or `Texaco Takes a Trick'.''
He performs close-up magic at small dinner parties, cocktail receptions and
larger functions, as well as with Top Hat Casinos where he often sets up his
Bunco Booth. Two years ago he became the first Scot to be named Close-up
Magician of the Year by the International Brotherhood of Magicians.
``I tend to find I would treble the amount of work I do at this time of year,''
he says. ``Companies are going for fewer guests and a bigger spend. Clients are
deciding that, rather than 100 people, they will have 20 guests and spend the
money on their 20 best customers or staff.''
Entertainment is also becoming a Scottish export. ``We are exporting our
services south of the border. Companies like Scottish Equitable and Scottish
Life, which we have done work for in Scotland, will take me down to Birmingham
or London for functions there.''

CORPORATE entertainment might be fun for the customer but it is a serious
business for the leading companies. Top Hat Casinos was one of the firms
selected to compete in the latest series of Scottish Television's Business
Game, alongside computer equipment manufacturers and sophisticated engineering
firms.
The West Lothian-based business describes itself as ``The Entertainment
Casino'', for its function is to entertain its clients' guests. It uses only
fun money, which can be specially printed with the client's logo.
Yet all its staff are casino-trained and its equipment - roulette, blackjack
and dice tables down to chips which can cost 50p each - is full-size, genuine
casino equipment. It adds to the problems of transportation, even in the firm's
specially-equipped and liveried van, but it ensures guests enjoy the authentic
feel of a casino. And the use of fun money does little to dampen the enthusiasm
of the players. Guests are given a set amount of fun money when they arrive and
try to increase their stake. At the end of the evening, the client presents
prizes to those who have won the most.
Charities use Top Hat Casinos for fund-raising. Guests still compete for prizes
but in this case they buy the fun money. At no time do casino staff members
handle real money.
Casinos can be themed to include Western nights, gangster nights and Las Vegas
nights, complete with Elvis and Frank Sinatra lookalikes - and soundalikes, of
course.
``Our clients include major companies, such as J&amp;B Whisky and upmarket car
distributorships,'' says Top Hat's owner and founder, Marion Young. ``The
venues where we appear include the best hotels such as Gleneagles, the Hilton,
and the Moat House.
``So our standards of professionalism have to be at least as high as theirs. We
have been chosen by these clients to entertain their personally-invited guests
so in a way we are representing that company.
``We have first-hand knowledge of most of the major locations but in the case
of a new one, we will reconnoitre entrances and exits to ensure that all our
staff and equipment are in place on time and that we get our tables out without
any disturbance to guests.

<HEADLINE>Prisons paralysis Pressure for an alternative to remand</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>20</PAGE>
<ARTICLETYPE>Leader</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>974995497</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE recently-retired prisons inspector for England, Judge Stephen Tumim, in an
interview with this newspaper last week, said most people he had encountered
behind bars were uneducated, socially inadequate young men and that, prison
being fundamentally about cutting the crime rate, we should be throwing at them
education, in all its forms. But when the jails are chronically overcrowded, as
they are in Scotland, that goal becomes impossible to attain. We literally pour
money down a bottomless prisons pit because reoffending cannot properly be
addressed. An even worse feature of the overcrowding is that so much of it is
caused by untried remandees, 60% of whom will be judged innocent or given a
non-custodial sentence. It remains an affront that they receive the worst deal
of all our numerous Scottish prisoners.
It is not a new problem but one which seems to have caused a paralysis in our
judicial and social systems. At the centre of this is the conundrum that the
Government is genuinely worried about having too many people on remand, while
at the same time, because of its own love affair with prison, is forced to
respond over-strongly to concerns such as the level of reoffending on bail.
There has been considerable pressure from a frustrated police service over
this, which is understandable.
Bail has undoubtedly become less attractive to a judiciary who were not noted
for views informed by liberality in the first place. Crime rates in Scotland
are also falling, with more effective policing playing a part, and that has
consequences for the prisons. The other element in the chain, which also has
the effect of swelling the prison remand population, is the question of fine
default, and here it does not appear that the judiciary is solely to blame.
Successive Scottish Ministers seem to have dragged their feet over the
provision of an alternative and their attitude is still that they want more
proof that the diversion schemes work before further resources are committed.
But how much more proof do they need? The highly-reputable reform body, SACRO,
says Scotland urgently requires a shift of focus away from remands in custody
towards community-based facilities to support people on bail and reduce the
risk of their reoffending. Over 80% do not offend on bail and we should target
the resources towards supporting the minority who do. Their own programmes are
known successes. We also know of the real dangers in the hardening of
attitudes; the families of three young women who died in Cornton Vale Prison
have told us about that and we know that self-harm and attempted suicides are
over-represented among remands.
The Scottish Office should now signal a more positive attitude towards bail
hostels, fine supervision, and other community-based support systems. There is
also scope for a genuinely innovative approach to actual remand which would
require some change in the law. At the moment most remandees, more than 1000
prisoners in any single day, sit around doing nothing, because neither work nor
education is compulsory. The system is therefore clogged by idle, bored, and
traumatised people, around 15,000 of them a year, for whom nothing can be done.
They often appear to be there, not because they represent any real danger to
the public, but because they are a persistent nuisance. For all the wrong
reasons the Government continues to ignore its own oft-repeated dictum that
prison should be for those from whom society needs physical protection. The
pressure for change is mounting.

STAFF training also benefits the retailer. While most consumers in the Touche
Ross survey put customer service sixth on the list of their shopping
priorities, few would return to any shop which did not serve them well.
Fashion retail chain French Connection bases much of its training on this
principle. ``We believe if we train our staff to improve their product
knowledge it improves their customer service as well,'' says store manager
Laura Clink at Glasgow's Union Street store.
``This hopefully also boosts customer loyalty. If our customers feel they've
been treated well and are pleased with the results they are more likely to come
back and shop here again.''
Laura and her team train every Saturday morning. Topics are not always centred
around product - there are too many other elements to the job. ``We all sit
down and discuss the day's training topic,'' she says. ``It could be customer
service, till procedures, administration, filing in the office, or new staff
incentive schemes.
``We run different incentives where staff get prizes for performing well.
Prizes can be anything from a free meal to additional discounts on
merchanise.'' The few weeks leading up to Christmas will see the store become
progressively busier as people flock to the shops to buy their presents and
party outfits. Over the next three Saturdays Laura will prepare her team for
the Christmas rush by recapping all customer service training. She'll be
getting them ready for the difficult business of remaining calm and collected
in the face of stressed shoppers.
``We want our customers to leave the shop feeling as though they've been well
looked after,'' she says. ``If we don't recap on training we can't be fully
efficient - and we want to make sure we keep our customers happy.''

.ON Sunday, in the quietness of a cemetery in Stirling two women linked
inextricably by grief and love will stand together in silent prayer. One will
be remembering the man she was going to marry, the other the son she brought up
to be a scientist. The murder of Dr Michael Meenaghan, a 33-year-old Oxford
biochemist gunned down in his own home in the university city exactly a year
ago remains unsolved. Police investigations into the killing all but closed in
June, although a #10,000 reward for information is still on offer.
Colin Dexter, creator of Inspector Morse, plans to use this town-and-gown
slaying as the background to a future mystery plot. All that though, is
meaningless to the mother who shared his past, and the lover who planned to
share his future. Their shared grief has helped them cope with tragedy; their
new-found affection for each other will help them face an uncertain future.
It took only a single blast from a 12-bore sawn-off shotgun to kill the 6ft
5in biochemist. Known to all his friends as Spike, he died from severe wounds
to his upper chest. Here Pat Meenaghan and Denise Holt speak about the tragedy
that has brought them so close together.
DETECTIVE Chief Inspector Morse would have long since resolved it, but real
life isn't like that. The worst thing for Pat Meenaghan and Denise Holt is that
they might never know.
On Sunday they will attend mass, go to the cemetery, place flowers on the
grave, and wonder at the terrible twist of fate that has brought them together.
People witnessing this scene at St Thomas's in Stirling might think they are
mother and daughter.
The relationship they have developed is everything that Denise had hoped for
when Michael was alive and when they were planning marriage. But Pat and Denise
never met before Michael's funeral.
Now Pat thinks they could not be closer. Photographs of Denise's children are
displayed proudly on the wall of her living room, just above the shelf that
carries her son's bound doctorate thesis. ``She is just like a daughter to me.''
Pat didn't even know that Denise existed and that her only son was planning to
put his house in Oxford on the market so that he could move in with Denise,
already married twice and the mother of three children.
``Had he told me that he was going to marry a woman who had already been
married twice with three children, I would have shown him the door,'' said Mrs
Meenaghan. She might have grey hair, she might be a woman suffering from
angina, and she might now be widowed and on her own, but Pat Meenaghan is not a
woman to be trifled with.
Michael had warned Denise: ``Don't cross my mum. She would eat you alive.''
Nevertheless he had worked out a plan to break the news about his love for
Denise gently to his mother last Christmas. He also had it worked out that
within not many more weeks he would have prepared Denise's three children for a
new life. ``I'll talk them round and we will be married within six months,'' he
said.
The day before the murder had been special for Denise and Spike. It was the
anniversary of the first time they had made love.
Michael was a Guardian reader, proud of his Scottish working class background.
At the same time he was soppy. To him Denise was Maisie. It had begun as an
insult, but thereafter it became a pet name. On Valentine's day he had put a
message in the Guardian: ``Maisie - Will you love me until I am dead? -
Michael.''
That last night together he argued over a topical story that had made
headlines. He insisted it was perfectly all right for someone to use a shotgun
to protect his property.
They parted in their usual manner at three o'clock in the morning. Michael
closed his front door and each of them pressed hands against the glass pane. On
other times they pressed noses against the glass, more often than not with
Virus, the cat Denise had bought Michael for company, on his shoulder.
They were to meet in Birmingham at 8pm that night to attend a folk-rock gig in
a pub. She went shopping that afternoon but suddenly at 4.15pm felt ill. ``It
was as if I could not breathe. I had to get out of the shop. Fifteen minutes
later I felt better.''
Spike was shot just before 4.30pm.
Of course he didn't turn up at their meeting place that evening, so she went on
to the gig alone, thinking eventually he would turn up.
All evening she made frantic telephone calls. She knew perfectly well that if
his car had broken down he would get a message to her. ``I must have tried 15
times to get him on the phone. I even put a call through to his lab. I knew
something was wrong...... seriously wrong.'' So she headed for Oxford.
Denise added: ``I turned into the street and all I could see was the blazing
lights coming from his house. I knew then it was even more serious than my
worst nightmare...... Michael never put more than one light on in the house.
Then I saw the police van.''
The officer guarding the door would not let her past. He appeared shocked and
did not want to look into her eyes. ``There has been a terrible shooting,' he
said.
``Please don't tell me he is dead.''
Denise grasped his face between her hands, forcing him to look into her eyes,
and said: ``Let me breathe into him. Let me touch him. I can make him alive
again.''
``No you can't,'' the policeman said gently. Later Denise was to learn that
officer's name was Andrew.
Such is the nature of murder inquiries that Denise immediately became a suspect
and was taken to a police station for most of the night.
``You cannot imagine the horror,'' she said. ``At one moment you have been told
your fella has been murdered and then you are in this room whith a total
stranger who is dressed in white paper overalls to prevent contamination and
you are being swabbed about the face to see if there is powder residue.''
Eventually she was driven home to Birmingham, but the police investigation into
her life had just begun. They look at everything, bank statements, telephone
bills, correspondence, and they speak to everyone a suspect has been in contact
with, no matter the distress it might cause.
Although the investigation is now closed, and Denise has long since been
eliminated as a suspect, the police still retain her love letters in case they
might eventually prove to be evidence. She and Spike wrote three or four times
a week, even though they were seeing each other all the time. He sent flowers
and they spoke constantly on the telephone. ``My phone bill was #300 a
quarter,'' she said.
However, there was one letter the police did not get. ``That was the best
one...... `I want you as my wife...... mother to my children...... the first
thing I see in the morning...... the last thing at night......'.''
By this time Mrs Meenaghan was also in Oxford. She had been told of her son's
death by two Stirling policeman who came to her at 8am on Sunday.
She didn't believe it at first, but eventually was telling neighbours:
``Someone's killed my Michael. They have murdered my Michael.''
Despite the valium she still remembers being asked by Oxford police if she
would meet Denise. ``I wanted to know `Who is this Denise anyway?','' said Mrs
Meenaghan. There was no meeting between the two women in Oxford. They did not
meet until the night before the funeral, when Michael's body was taken into
church.
First Denise wrote to Pat Meenaghan. ``It was a lovely letter. I have it
here,'' says Pat. ``I never thought I would meet the lassie, but I did think it
was brave of her to write.''
Denise recalls: ``I had to let her know about our relationship. Then I
telephoned her. I could not go to the funeral without her knowing who I was and
there was no way I was not going.
``On the phone she gave me a right bollocking. She ranted a lot, but we spoke
for two hours. She was grief stricken, but I understood.''
Pat doesn't recall this. ``I don't remember the phone calls. I was not in this
world. I was just hollow inside.''
When Denise travelled north for the funeral she took with her the Caithness
Crystal won at Perth a few months earlier by a mixed volleyball team she and
Spike had played in.
``There were all these people I didn't know,'' said Denise. ``How could he be
the love of my life and I his and I didn't know them. They must have been
looking at me and saying: `Who is that?'.''
Denise remembers Pat and herself nodding at each other. Pat is sure she shook
Denise's hand. Later Denise was invited home for tea and sandwiches. ``It was
my fella's funeral,'' said Denise. ``I was not going to be a guest, so I went
into the kitchen and made tea.''
Next day her flowers to Michael responded to his Valentine's Day message in the
Guardian. ``Michael - Beyond death, Maisie.''
When Denise made it known that she would be returning to visit the grave in a
few week's time, Pat insisted that she stay with her. ``But don't come back
greetin','' she added.
``She was brilliant she did everything she could,'' said Denise. ``She showed
me his baby pictures and there he was in his dad's arms. That's how I imagine
them now.''
She visits his grave every two months or so, but tries not to look at his name
on the gravestone. ``That's something I have noticed,'' says Pat.
The two woman are constantly on the phone to each other. ``He has been dead for
a year, but my telephone bill is just as big,'' said Denise.
``At first I wanted to be with Pat because she was the closest thing to him.
Now I really love her.''
Detective Superintendent David Blair, a quietly spoken Ulsterman who has spent
most of his life in England and who has 30 years' experience with Thames Valley
Police behind him, was in charge of the case. He admitted: ``I don't know where
the answer lies.
``Serious crimes do go unresolved, but there are not many where you don't form
ideas on how it might have happened. Every member of my team to a man say they
don't know who it was and they don't know why.''
The investigation was energetically and enthusiastically pursued, but one by
one each lead was eliminated.
``We reached the stage we could not legitimately carry the investigation on,''
he said.
``I am tempted to think this might have been a one off job,'' he added. ``It
could be there was no intention to kill. A shotgun fired into a darkened room,
with only one shot fired, does not guarantee success.''
However, he still holds that if it been a professional hit the killer would
have gone to the front door and fired at point-blank range when his knock was
answered.
He does not rule out the drugged-up burglar scenario, whereby a crazed gunman
fired off a shot when disturbed. It did hold some water, given the
extraordinary circumstances of the case, he said. However, burglars do not
normally carry shotguns. ``With every theory in this case, there is something
to knock it down,'' Mr Blair adds.
In June he travelled to Birmingham and to Stirling to let Denise and Pat know
that the investigation was being wound down, and no longer would be pursued
actively.
So how does he feel?
``Disappointed,'' Mr Blair said before adding: ``All the more so because we
cannot tell his family and his loved ones the reason why. If nothing else, they
deserve to know that.''

ABERDEEN'S Claire Waddell is set to face her first serious challenge of the
season when she defends the Scottish championship at Heriot-Watt University
next week.
The Stirling University student has had it all her own way on the domestic
front this season, but has had to settle for a share of the top seeding with
London-based Senga Macfie in the national event.
Waddell scored a shock win over world No.20 Macfie in last year's final, and
has since gone on to help Scotland win a bronze medal at this year's European
championship and maintain an unbeaten record at home.
Macfie, who also suffered a surprise defeat, from Alison Bowie, on her Scottish
championship debut two years ago, has had an up-and-down season on the world
circuit recently. But she did show form with a win over New Zealand's Phillipa
Beans in the Cyprus International last month, and is desperate to make it third
time lucky in Scotland.
Martin Heath, top seed in the men's event, gave world No.2 Rodney Eyles a scare
before going out of the Mahindra International Challenge in Bombay by 8-15,
15-11, 13-15, 15-12, 15-9.
In the same tournament, Peter Nicol, who will not be defending the Scottish
title, defeated Egyptian Ahmed Barada, a former Scottish Junior Open champion,
15-11, 10-15, 15-3, 11-15, 15-8.

ONE of the great aims of devolution is to give Scotland a measure of modern,
accountable government; to remove, if you like, the democratic deficit. Yet if
democracy is to be brought to the governance of Scottish affairs it should be a
grown-up democracy, not a nappied affair which must grow whiskers before it can
be treated like an adult, nor one which cannot change its mind in the course of
time if circumstances warrant. Tony Blair's remarkable interview in this
newspaper appears to point to a vision of a Scottish Assembly which must seek a
mandate before each term for the revenue-raising powers which will make it
worth while. In the absolute sense there is nothing wrong with this. Any party
seeking the support of the electorate should be prepared to set out its views
and intentions as far as the latter can be ascertained in advance. In this Mr
Blair is returning to his familiar theme of the tax promises made by the Tory
Government and subsequently broken.
Yet he appears to wish to take this particular line of thinking further. He
seems intent on launching his party into the first election for a Scottish
Assembly with a manifesto which will not advocate a tax increase. Moreover, in
line with his detestation of promises made and broken, the logical inference of
this is that a Labour administration leading a Scottish Assembly and elected on
a no-tax-raising platform would not raise taxes during the term of the
Assembly, no matter what happens. We can sympathise with Mr Blair's intentions
here. Undoubtedly he wants to consign Michael Forsyth's ``Tartan Tax'' campaign
to the region of tabloid ghouls and hobgoblins which it should rightly inhabit,
yet in doing so he has indicated his unease with the success of Mr Forsyth's
propaganda, and in an important sense he has surrendered some of the initiative
to his opponent.
Other things will follow from Mr Blair's latest thoughts. If a Labour
administration is elected on the basis already described and leads, perhaps in
coalition, a Scottish Assembly it will find itself in hideous difficulties if a
need should arise suddenly to raise or lower taxes. This could be envisaged in
the context of a crisis in Scottish education which might necessitate urgent
revenue. Under Mr Blair's plan the only thing that the Labour administration
could do in these circumstances would be to fall on its sword, dissolve the
Assembly, and call a fresh election with a platform seeking raised (or in other
circumstances, lowered) taxes. This is certainly direct democracy, but so
direct that it would be painful. Presumably Mr Blair does not intend that the
Westminster Parliament should adopt these rules. How would Chancellor Brown
react if he had to call a General Election every time he wished to raise or
lower taxes?
At first glance Mr Blair is not trying to redraft the proposals of the
Constitutional Convention; he is saying merely that his party will behave in a
certain way. Yet the effect of this, given Labour's popularity in Scotland, is
effectively to alter the manner in which any Assembly will function. In this
respect his views are bound to be seen as taking the entire affair backwards,
and they will undoubtedly infuriate the many allies who worked with Labour on
the formation of the proposals for an Assembly. What Mr Blair is proposing is
certainly clever. He hopes it will demolish the ``Tartan Tax'' offensive; and
it will probably help him convince those English Labour MPs who harbour doubts
about devolution. He is entitled to do it because he commits nobody other than
his own party, yet it is disruptive and regressive and ultimately unhelpful.

SOMEWHERE out there, there must be an employer who can use my educational
qualifications and my willingness to work. If only someone would give me the
chance to show what I can do . . .
That's the theme which runs through the thoughts of every unemployed graduate.
And yes, out there, there are employers keen to find people who are well
qualified, are eager to work - and who already have relevant work experience.
This problem of matching people and jobs is being tackled with enthusiam,
commitment and a great deal of success by the Vista Graduate Gateway Programme.
Vista is the training department of Asset, which stands for Ardrossan,
Saltcoats, Stevenson Enterprise Trust, and it is supported by Enterprise
Ayrshire.
Based in Stevenson, it is open to all graduates - from HNC to PhD, and from
theology to astrophysics - and it now welcomes graduates from Glasgow as well
as those living in Ayrshire.
The secret of the scheme's 83% success rate lies in its specialist training
courses leading to 26-week job placements in the field of the graduate's
choice. This gives them the all-important work experience and a very real
chance to prove themselves in a business environment and enhance their
understanding of business philosophy and practice.
Senior training officer Irene Innes lays great store by the way Vista takes
graduates in one at a time and not as part of a course intake.
``We believe we offer a great deal to unemployed graduates at a low point in
their lives, and we are very conscious of the importance of dealing with them
as individuals,'' she says.
On the other hand, what draws many graduates to the programme is the
recognition that they are not alone in the struggle to find a suitable job and
the club-style companionship of others in a similar plight.
While placements are being sought and arranged, the graduates are offered
courses in four modules - management, quality control, self-investment, and
health and safety.
They are given guidance on career choices, the compilation of CVs, and inteview
techniques.
Mrs Innes says: ``When we started eight years ago it was quite tricky finding
companies to co-operate with placements. We have now broken that barrier and
companies are coming to me and asking to be kept in mind if a graduate wants to
work in their field.''
It was seeing her grandfather's name in an advertisement in The Herald that led
Karen Begg to her new job as an administration officer with Quarriers.
She is working on the James Shield Project, which last week opened a hostel for
homeless young people in the Gorbals. The project is named after a former Lord
Provost of Glasgow who, by chance, had the same name as her grandfather.
Karen, an honours Bachelor of Education graduate, had decided to diversify from
a teaching career and, realising the difficulty of finding another job, joined
Graduate Gateway.
She was successful in finding a placement with Craigie College where she gained
experience in administration and the European desk.
Karen says: ``I really enjoy working as a member of a team, and I'm certain I
would not have got this job without the placement experience.''
Sean Davey knew of Graduate Gateway because his older sister Angela, an English
graduate, found a job through Asset and is now working with the Scottish Office.
Having gained an HND in computing, Sean recognised that his lack of relevant
experience was a distinct disadvantage in finding a job and he was very keen to
obtain a work experience placement in the IT field.
He says he found the Gateway courses on management skills, health and safety,
and quality control most valuable, and he was delighted to be given a placement
with SAZTEC, a data capture company in Ardrossan.
Sean's computing skills matched the needs of the company and he was allocated
responsible tasks within the IT department. The outcome was the offer of a
full-time post, which he started on November 1.
Sean's methodical and realistic approach to his job search paid off and his
abilities are now being used to full effect.
Fiona Murray, an honours BSc graduate, was about to buy a property in Fife when
the company she worked for went out of business. On returning to her home base
in Irvine, she found it very difficult to find a new job and became very
demotivated.
``I was at the end of my tether and had decided to head south to take a job
pulling pints,'' she says. ``I was being told that I was over-qualified,
lacking experience, or too old at 27. If it hadn't been for Graduate Gateway, I
would have fallen through the net. It was my one and only chance of a proper
job.''
On joining the Gateway programme Fiona took time to talk through her career
options and decided to apply for a placement which would allow her to use her
knowledge of multimedia and which would also provide her with experience in
training.
She found such a placement with Ayrshire ITec. She proved to be an excellent
worker and the company did not want to lose her skills at the end of the
placement, so now she has a full-time job.
Fiona says: ``If a lot more graduates were aware of the Graduate Gateway
programme it would make the world a much better place for them.''

MARTIN Currie's Scottish Eastern Investment Trust has borrowed 4.65 billion yen
(#30m) to buy more Japanese shares, particularly in the resurgent electrical
and retail sectors.
The two-year loan carries an interest rate of just over 1% and will help
Scottish Eastern to boost Japanese equities to 12% of its #790m investment
portfolio from 9% at present.
``This move is consistent with our positive view of the Japanese stock
market,'' said Martin Currie director Eric McAuslan.
``We are forecasting annual economic growth to reach 2.5% in the next fiscal
year and we look for big substantial growth from Japanese equities in 1996.''
The new loan raises Scottish Eastern's borrowings to 19% of net assets from
14%.

FRENCH side UC Paris have had their perparations for this weekend's European
Confederation Cup in Glasgow thrown into chaos by the French public transport
strike.
The French, who include the legendary Alain Fabiani in their ranks, finally
arrived in Glasgow yesterday - 21 hours after setting out for the airport. They
had planned to fly straight to Glasgow, but had to stay overnight in Birmingham
on Wednesday.
Paris open the tournament at the Kelvin Hall against Croatians Osijec tonight
at 5pm with Scottish champions City of Glasgow Ragazzi facing Balkancar Sofia
at 7.30.

<TEXT>
A MAN who was told erroneously that his wife was dying of cancer, is now
demanding an explanation from the hospital that issued the prognosis.
Mr Alex MacMillan kept the harrowing news to himself for a fortnight, before
telling his two daughters. Two days later, he was told the prognosis had been a
mistake.
Directors of Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride say an inquiry will be held
into the family's claim that Mrs MacMillan, 44, was wrongly diagnosed as being
close to death.
Mr MacMillan, 44, told yesterday how he struggled to come to terms with the
news that his wife could be dead within three months.
He said he had yet to receive an explanation for the error.
``Janette underwent a life-saving operation three years ago after she was
diagnosed as having breast cancer,'' said Mr MacMillan.
``Recently though, she was suffering a new pain and an ovarian cyst was
diagnosed.
``She received treatment at Hairmyres and at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow.
``I got a phone call asking that I go to Hairmyres. I was taken to an office
alone and told by a doctor that he believed the cancer had spread to her
stomach.
``He said they could operate but that, at worst, Janette only had about three
months to live.
``I was absolutely devastated.''
Following the news, Mr MacMillan, from Comely Bank, Hamilton, Lanarkshire,
tried to gather his thoughts.
After almost two weeks, he told daughters Sandra, 25, and Yvonne, 22.
``It was a terrible shock for them,'' he said.
``We decided not to tell Janette. How do you tell someone, even your wife, news
like that?''
Two days after Mr MacMillan told his daughters the prognosis, Stobhill Hospital
informed him that Mrs MacMillan was in the clear. The cyst was not malignant
and could be treated.
This diagnosis was confirmed later by Hairmyres Hospital.
Mr MacMillan, a foreman with Scottish Power, said: ``It was only then that I
told Janette what had been going on.
``At first she thought I was joking. But soon she realised it was no joke.''
Mrs MacMillan said: ``It wasn't as if I was prepared for anything like this to
happen because I thought I was in the clear. So when I was told about it, I
just went into shock.''
Now the family have asked the hospital for an explanation.
Mrs MacMillan is back at work in a clothing factory after hospital treatment.
Last night, the assistant director of administration at Hairmyres, Mr John
Gray, said an inquiry was under way.
``We have already had a meeting with Mr and Mrs MacMillan,'' Mr Gray said.
``This is clearly a very complex case.
``The investigation will examine from top to toe the circumstances surrounding
this. Once it is completed, we will contact the family with our findings.''
Hamilton MP George Robertson said: ``It is a very distressing story and I'm
looking into it.''

GLASGOW has rejoined the race for Millenium Commission millions in the hope of
resurrecting the plan for a #55m national indoor arena at Glasgow Green.
The city, having been ruled out of the first round of projects, was put on the
so-called B list but has been encouraged by a commission invitation to resubmit
plans which concentrate on the 12,000-capacity multi-purpose national indoor
stadium and concert centre as part of a #78m East End refurbishment programme.
Glasgow, UK city of architecture in 1999, has staged an international design
competition, and from eight short-listed entries two options have been chosen:
one by Arup Associates of London, the other by an Edinburgh company, RMJM. The
pair will pitch directly against one another if and when Millenium approval is
granted.
The two designs were selected by a panel chaired by Sir Norman Foster, and
included city councillors.
``The two schemes were very different in their approach and appearance,'' said
Sir Norman. ``But both address the problems of large-scale events in terms of
people movements, servicing, and performers, with each creating an identifiable
image from a distance on the skyline.''
The Millenium Commission's verdict is expected in January and the winning arena
design would then be announced in May. Glasgow is still awaiting Millenium news
on the Hampden Project, and for a development at Pacific Quay which includes
the establishment of a Science Museum.
The indoor stadium would be built at Fleshers' Haugh, on the site of the Fifty
Pitches whose links with the past would be preserved by the establishment of a
football centre of excellence.
``A tremendous amount of time and effort has gone into our resubmitted bid for
this truly world-class arena,'' said Mr Chris Purslow, Glasgow's city
architect. ``If the bid is successful, the proposals will see the regeneration
of an important site adjacent to Glasgow Green and the provision of top-class
facilities for international events.''
It would also be used as an entertainment and concert venue and have the
facility to provide managed workspace for arts and crafts, dance, sound
studios, and community space in response to local demand.
The overall project includes a watersport centre, upgraded walking and cycle
routes, and model boating centre. There would be a play village for families,
wheels area for go-karts, bikes, and skateboards, and an indoor soft-play area.
The parks will hold horticultural displays of international quality and there
is the promise of all-year-round colour, a scented garden, and thistle maze.
There will be replanting of 80% of tree stock, tree-lined boulevards, piazzas,
and fountains.
Councillor Colin McNicol, convener of the parks and recreation committee,
described the overall project as ``the most outstanding urban parkland renewal
initiative ever undertaken in Europe''.

BEEF is to remain on the menu for most Scottish school dinners, despite the
current concern over BSE.
The Scottish Local Authority Caterers' Association last night dissociated
itself from the views of its English counterpart, LACA, which called for
poultry substitutes to be used for hamburgers and sausages.
SLACA chairman, Mr Munro Anderson, said although the association was aware of
public concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy, it had not made any
recommendations to withdraw meat or meat-related dishes from menus.
His organisation represents all 12 regional and islands councils.
``Some local authority caterers are concerned that the English view is being
attributed to Scotland as well. This is not the case,'' Mr Anderson said.
The response was welcomed by the Meat and Livestock Commission.
Its general manager in Scotland, Mr Alistair Donaldson, said principal bovine
offals from the brain, tonsils, and spine had been destroyed since 1988.
Mr Donaldson called on scientists who had expressed misgivings to bring forward
evidence to the independent committee looking at BSE.
However, Hutcheson's Grammar School in Glasgow and Daniel Stewart's and
Melville College in Edinburgh yesterday joined the list of private schools
excluding hamburgers and sausages from their menus.
Further details also emerged yesterday of investigations into false
declarations on BSE cattle.
Farmers, hauliers, and dealers have to certify that cattle for sale have been
not on premises where BSE had been reported for the previous six years.
Strathclyde region is investigating six alleged contraventions of the Trade
Descriptions Act. Lothian region's trading standards office said it was
investigating seven such cases.

CONSIDER this. If the Scots were once 90-minute patriots, in the football
analogy coined by Jim Sillars in his memorably bitter sound-bite, have they
become 210-minute patriots in the wake of the Braveheart movie?
A political concentration span the length of a Hollywood film and a level of
commitment to match, from bravehearts to fainthearts - these have been the easy
accusations about the Scottish electorate following the peaks and troughs of
SNP support in recent months. But was there ever a Mel Gibson factor in
Scottish politics?
Labour has been on more than 50% support in 11 of our 12 System Three polls
this year and only once, in October, did it drop below. Its 46% rating then
coincided with the SNP surging to the psychologically important 30% level and
suddenly, for the first time since his assumption of power, Labour leader Tony
Blair appeared vulnerable.
But did that level of support relate to SNP popularity in its own right, or was
it fuelled by a perceived dip in belief in New Labour's seemingly inevitable
path to Westminster power? It happened, after all, in the wake of a period when
the press believed Mr Blair was ``wobbling'' on Scottish devolution and his
holiday in Italy seemed to have left Labour short of its customary iron
discipline.
In other words, do voters switch support to the SNP because they believe in
independence in Europe, or do they do so at times because they lose faith in
Labour's ability to oust the Conservatives after 16 years in office?
Certainly the SNP was on a spectacular high two months ago. The talk was of an
end to the Blair honeymoon, of having the Labour leader ``in its sights'', and
a confident belief in having cranked up support to a new level. Then the
16-point gap opened up to 29 points last month, and to 36 points this week.
Having hit 57% for the third time this year - a level bettered only once in 21
years of Herald polling when it hit 58% in April 1984 - Labour now appears to
be in an unassailable position. But is this based on its Scottish performance
and the popularity of its constitutional plans, or is it because of a growing
belief that southern voters will definitely propel Tony Blair to number 10?
The SNP has in the past ridiculed this ``one last chance'' approach by habitual
Labour voters, but it is difficult to dismiss. A couple of months ago, at the
time of the 16-point gap between Labour and the SNP, chatting to a friend and
veteran trade unionist who could be considered Labour to his bootstraps, I
asked how things stood.
``If Labour doesn't win the next General Election, or if it wins and fails to
deliver the Scottish parliament in full, as promised, I will tear up my card
and join the SNP,'' he replied.
At the level of a certain kind of party activist, Labour and SNP remain
anathema to each other, even although all political logic would dictate that
the overlap in their views is extraordinary. To use the old jibe, there are
indeed some ``tartan Tories'' in the SNP, but there are also some very
conservative politicians inside the Labour Party and some ultra-Unionists,
although they are keeping relatively quiet for the time being.
The SNP's Fergus Ewing and David McCarthy would certainly bill themselves as
pro-business and they got a hard time from their party's left at annual
conference. But one-time Labour left-winger Michael Connarty recently attacked
the SNP for its policy on opposing council house sales, a press release that
brought a double-take from this observer.
Labour condemned as ``opportunism'' the SNP motion in the Commons to lower VAT
on domestic fuel earlier this year, and then moved precisely the same motion in
the House last week.
If you accept the Conservative point that both Labour and the SNP are
effectively socialist parties, then on average in our polls this year something
like 77% of those prepared to state their opinion were socialists, while the
party of government can muster just 12% and the Liberal Democrats have bumped
along at under 10%.
If the gargantuan efforts of the Scottish Secretary over the past four months
do not begin to bear fruit soon, we may be forced to conclude that they never
will.
But ordinary voters don't see things in such clear ideological terms or reflect
such simple party demarcation lines. They are resistant to being corralled into
the limited and mutually exclusive ground of manifestos.
Some vote SNP but want devolution. There are Labour supporters who want
eventual independence. There are some Conservatives who are by no means
Unionists. Most Liberal Democrats probably want and understand the concept of
federation, but their party is too often doomed by its political subtlety,
making fine points in a rough world.
The Scottish political landscape is a place where there is a desire for greater
self-determination, for an expression of Scottishness. Michael Forsyth is
trying to tap into that, but his efforts may be too little, too late.
It is interesting to ponder what might have been achieved if his initiatives
had come at the time of the original Taking Stock proposals of his predecessor.
When he picks up his broadsword and lays into the ``tartan tax'' he is trying
to chop down devolution, but his subliminal message may actually be harming the
SNP.
For their part, the nationalists do not have much room to manoeuvre. The St
Andrew's day debate forced them to restate their position on independence in
Europe, and they spent the month churning out no fewer than four major policy
documents. Whether they strike out on the high road or the low road to
independence, it becomes increasingly clear that they are not entirely masters
of their own fate.
MR Blair dominates the British political scene as a Prime Minister in waiting.
If his inner circle continues ruthlessly to crush potentially damaging policy
debate, to ditch hostages to electoral fortune, and to sit in wait to ambush
the Government at the next election, there seems to be little that any of the
other parties can do about it.
If Labour does falter in the battle for middle England, the Tories will pounce,
but in that event the likely beneficiary north of the Border seems far more
likely to be the SNP. It could be argued that what both the Tories and SNP now
need to regain the political initiative is a Labour government, but don't
expect Messrs Forsyth or Salmond to admit that in public.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard is ``minded not'' to refer the case of the
Bridgewater Four back to Court of Appeal but no final decision has been taken,
the Home Office said last night.
It said Mr Howard had notified the solicitors of the men of his ``provisional
conclusions'' and they now had opportunity to respond.
Michael Hickey, 33, Vincent Hickey, 41, and James Robinson, 61, have protested
their innocence since they were convicted in February 1979 of murdering
newspaper delivery boy Carl Bridgewater.
Carl, 13, was shot dead when he interrupted a burglary at Yew Tree Farm, near
Stourbridge, West Midlands, in 1978.
The confession of the fourth accused, Patrick Molloy, who was convicted of
manslaughter, was crucial to the convictions.
Molloy died in 1981, claiming he had been forced into making the confession.
The men's case was previously referred back to the Court of Appeal in 1987. The
court dismissed the appeal in March 1989.
A further request for another referral was rejected by the then Home Secretary,
Mr Kenneth Clarke, in February 1993. Mr Clarke said he had no doubts that the
convictions were safe.

THREE judges have severely criticised the Crown for placing inaccurate and
misleading information before them in support of a plea that a one-year
sentence imposed on a sex offender was too lenient.
The Advocate-depute who appeared at the Court of Criminal Appeal apologised for
the wrong information which had been placed before it by the Crown.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, stated that the mistakes were highly
regrettable.
He added: ``Whilst the court is obviously prepared to accept the apologies
offered by the Advocate-depute, it is to be hoped that the court is never asked
again by the Lord Advocate to consider a note of appeal at his instance which
is so inaccurate and misleading.''
The Crown appealed against three concurrent one-year sentences imposed by Lord
Morison on Alexander Ross, 39, who was found guilty after trial at the High
Court in Aberdeen on three charges of lewd and indecent behaviour towards two
girls aged four and six.
Ross, from Alness in Easter Ross, also had been charged with rape but that
charge was withdrawn by the Crown without any evidence being led.
The Lord Advocate claimed the one-year sentence was unduly lenient having
regard to the grossly indecent nature of the sexual abuse and the age of the
victims.
In his report to the appeal court, Lord Morison pointed out that the Crown's
grounds of appeal appeared to be based on the mistaken belief that three, not
two victims, had been involved and that there had been continuous and grossly
indecent abuse for 13 years, which was also untrue.
Lord Morison added: ``I consider it regrettable that Ross, who has been
subjected to the ordeal of a charge of rape in support of which the Crown led
no evidence, should now be subjected to a further period of uncertainty arising
from an appeal which appears to me to be based on an erroneous view of the
offences for which he was sentenced.''
The Lord Justice Clerk said Lord Morison had obviously attached considerable
weight to the fact that the accused had been subjected to the ordeal of a rape
charge in support of which no evidence had been led.
When Ross had been fully committed for trial in June 1994, the Crown petition
made no reference to rape and the first time he became aware that rape was
being alleged was when the indictment was served on him last May.
Statements had then been taken from both the alleged victim and her mother and
they had said nothing to support a charge of rape. A medical examination of the
child also showed nothing untoward.
Lord Ross added: ``In our opinion, when considering sentence in this case, the
trial judge was fully entitled to have regard to the fact that Ross had for a
time faced a very serious charge of raping a young child in respect of which
the Crown led no evidence at all.''
Looking at the indecency offences, the appeal court took the view that the
concurrent one-year sentences could not be described as unduly lenient.
The trial judge himself had observed that it might well have been suggested
that he should have made one of the sentences consecutive but the Lord Advocate
had not suggested that Lord Morison was wrong to make all the sentences
concurrent.
The appeal court refused the Crown appeal.

THE Chrysler Corporation, under pressure from billionaire Kirk Kerkorian to
share more of its cash with shareholders, said yesterday it had approved its
fifth dividend increase in two years.
Chrysler said its directors, at their regular monthly meeting, raised the
quarterly common stock dividend by 20% to 60 cents a share, up from 50 cents.
It is payable on January 12 of next year, to shareholders of record on December
15.
Chairman Robert Eaton also said the company had completed the first $1000m
share repurchase programme announced in December 1994 and was buying shares
under the second $1000m programme announced in September this year.
It expected to complete the second repurchase programme, subject to market
conditions, by the end of 1996.
Chrysler has increased its quarterly dividend by 300% from 15 cents a share in
December 1993. During 1995, Chrysler has returned about $1700m to shareholders
in higher dividends and share buy-backs.
``Being able to sustain our dividend throughout a business cycle is one of the
board's key decision factors in determining when an increase is merited and as
we look ahead, we feel this payout rate meets those criteria,'' Mr Eaton said.

TWO 27-year-old men were detained by Strathclyde Police in the Anniesland area
of Glasgow following a major drugs operation yesterday.
Police recovered drugs with an estimated street value of #800,000 - about 100
kilos of cannabis and four kilos of a white powder thought to be amphetamine or
cocaine.
Meanwhile, Chief Constable Leslie Sharp is expected to give his verdict on the
force's 90-day Operation Eagle anti-drugs campaign at a Strathclyde Police
seminar in Glasgow today.
The campaign has seen a total of 6000 people arrested and more than 30,000
schoolchildren given anti-drugs awareness talks in an effort to stamp out the
drug trade.

THE RUN-UP to Christmas is the most important trading period for retailers, but
the signs are that Christmas cheer is slow in coming to the High Street with
consumers still careful with their spending.
This, coupled with rising raw material costs and the low level of inflation,
make it difficult for retailers to grow their profits significantly.
However, Great Universal Stores, the catalogue shopping, stores and finance
group, beat City expectations at the interim stage, with profits up 4.7% to
#237.5m. Sales and profits advanced in all its geographic territories. Despite
the encouraging performance, the group said that, given the volatile trading
background, ``the challenges ahead should not be underestimated''.
Within the operating divisions, the mail order shopping business suffered from
lower orders as a result of the very hot summer. Profits dipped by #2.8m to
#93.6m. New interactive methods of shopping are being monitored and tested.
Burberrys and Scotch House made higher profits in all its sectors and recorded
increased productivity in its products and manufacturing division following new
investment. Profit rose from #21.2m to #26.9m on sales up 21%.
The collection of golf wear has been well received and additional lines are to
be added. This high growth luxury consumer brand is viewed in the City as a
significant source of value for the group.
Overseas retailing also performed strongly, with improved sales and profits.
Elsewhere, property rental income rose by 6% to #31.5m. The portfolio consists
of 1065 properties, of which 80% are occupied by the retail trade, including
three shopping centres comprising 173 units. The occupancy level remains high
at 98.5%.
Profits from financial activities and information services grew by just under
#4m to #66.5m.
Lower interest receivable of #43.8m versus #46.3m, reflects the payment in
March of a special dividend of #301.7m. The group's balance sheet remains very
strong with a virtually ungeared balance sheet. There was positive underlying
cash flow from trading activities.
The sleepy secretive image of GUS could be changed in the not too distant
future. Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale is swapping his executive chairmanship of
Next for that of GUS, of which he is currently a non-executive director, after
the retirement of Lord Wolfson of Marylebone next September.
News of the move prompted speculation among some City analysts of a possible
future link between GUS and Next which has tended to outperform almost all its
retail rivals in recent years. In addition to its High Street outlets, Next
operates a very successful mail order business and has a younger more affluent
customer profile than GUS home shopping business.
GUS shares responded to the results and succession statement by jumping 18p to
632p after touching 648!sp earlier.

<TEXT>
ANOTHER shake-up in the world of fund management took place yesterday when
Allied Irish Bank bought the John Govett Group for #101m cash from the
long-established Govett &amp; Company.
They had tried to buy the Duff &amp; Phelps investment management business in the
US but ran into complex legal difficulties and counter claims. That depressed
the Govett share price and it has now decided that its activities in this
sphere would be better served under new ownership.
AIB is effectively buying 75% of the newly formed John Govett Holdings, with
management having 20% and Govett Oriental Investment Trust having the remaining
5%.
Part of the problem in selling off the division was how to retain the existing
management through incentives. The one-fifth stake should satisfy that
requirement.
John Govett manages #3000m of funds and has an outstanding record in the
emerging markets of the Far East. AIB is doing the deal very cheaply, paying
only 3.7% of funds under management and on a price earnings ratio of 10.7. That
is much less than Commerzbank paid for Jupiter Tyndall.
The rump of Govett, which is almost entirely US oriented, will continue under
the name of London Pacific Group, with #2900m of funds under management. Its
shares bounced 22p off the year's low to close at 242p, compared with a 1995
high of 377p.

A POLICEMAN was fined #750 yesterday for behaving indecently in front of school
children aged between seven and 11.
Perth Sheriff Court heard that Constable Brian Murphy, 24, of Tayside Police,
posed on his doorstep nude and sometimes in bra and panties.
In evidence, Murphy admitted that he twice ``flashed'' at his then live-in
fiancee as she left the house in the morning. He denied targeting children.
Rejecting his evidence, Sheriff John McInnes found him guilty of indecently
exposing himself on various occasions last April and May as well as causing
fear and alarm and disturbing the peace by appearing in women's underclothes
during the same period.
Sheriff McInnes said the children who gave evidence - mainly girls - were
credible witnesses.
Allowing Murphy two months to pay the fine, the sheriff said he accepted that
any lasting harm to the children ``is probably likely to be slight, if that''.
Murphy, previously an army bandsman, joined the police three years ago and had
been at Pitlochry since November of last year.
He was on counter duty at Pitlochry police station when a mother walked in to
report that her two daughters had seen a man behaving indecently outside a
house.
Murphy retorted: ``That's my house. It cannot be.''

JOHNSTON Press yesterday received Government clearance to buy the W&amp;J Linney
group of local newspapers in the Midlands.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said the Edinburgh-based newspaper
group could go ahead with the #20m purchase. Linney owns 11 titles in the
Mansfield and Worksop areas of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Nine are free
publications and two are paid for.
The DTI was able to nod through the acquisition without a reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission because the newspapers concerned have a daily
paid-for circulation of less that 50,000.
Johnston Press, which owns 81 other local publications, mostly in Yorkshire and
Derbyshire, agreed to purchase the Linney group on November 13.
n Ashanti, the mining group split off from Lonrho, yesterday made an #80m
agreed takeover bid for Cluff Resources. After the deal, worth 105p a share,
Ashanti claimed it would be the biggest gold mining and exploration group in
Africa below the Sahara. Ashanti launched the bid after buying a 26.6% stake in
Cluff from Hutchison Whampoa at 105p.

A FORMER matron of a nursing home which was at the centre of allegations
concerning mistreatment of patients has lodged a claim for unfair dismissal.
Mrs Margaret Walker, of Stonedyke Crescent, Carluke, claims she was dismissed
unfairly from Orchard House Nursing Home in Crossford, Lanarkshire. Her claim
is expected to be heard by a Glasgow tribunal in January.
The home was the subject of an investigation by Lanarkshire Health Board
earlier this year which made certain recommendations about its future running.
Mrs Walker was matron at the home, owned by Raymond and Margaret Baigent, for
more than six years.
A television documentary earlier this year claimed to expose controversial
standards of care for the elderly.
Last year, nurse Adele Bryson took her constructive dismissal claim against the
home to a tribunal. She resigned, claiming her authority had been undermined,
when Mrs Walker ordered staff to clean a patient's room.
However, the tribunal ruled she had no grounds to consider herself unfairly
dismissed as she was involving herself in matters which were nothing to do with
her.
At the tribunal, Ms Bryson claimed no action was taken when she alleged a
resident had been sexually harassed by a male employee and on another occasion
when a nurse allegedly hit a patient.
She also claimed that staff had to provide toiletries for residents.
Mrs Walker's unfair dismissal claim is scheduled to be heard on January 11 and
12.

THE #527m takeover by Greenalls of Boddington has placed the pubs to hotels
group in an ideal position for future growth, said chairman and chief executive
Andrew Thomas.
He added that the Boddingtons purchase was a major step in the evolution of
Greenalls, which now runs the UK's biggest independent pub chain.
Shares in the Warrington based group fell 6p to 534p despite pre-tax profits
rising from #74.8 to #101m in line with City expectations. The total dividend
payout goes up from 13.1p to 14.2p.
Boddingtons brought in not only 458 good quality pubs, also leisure hotels and
the UK's biggest independent drinks wholesale business.
A close review of its pubs operations had led the group to sell 69 pubs as well
as a number of other properties.

THE other evening I heard a woman make an astonishing statement on the Nine o'
Clock News. She has decided to keep her children off school because somewhere
in her neighbourhood (although not in the school) there has been a meningitis
death. ``It was one death too many,'' said this mother, slick with the sound
bite which even the most amateur television commentator has learned to perfect.
``It should never have happened.''
It should never have happened: the meningitis virus, its sometimes fatal
consequences, the outrageous anarchy of infectious disease should never have
happened. The authorities should never have let it happen. Someone is to blame.
In that woman's petulant voice I heard the ultimate surrender to the dependency
culture.
Cradle-to-grave care is the least of our expectations. What we demand, these
days, is a risk-free environment and we expect ``the authorities'' to provide
it. The authorities, meantime, are hoist with their own petard.
In their diverse political, bureaucratic, and scientific manifestations they
are the authors of a mad manifesto which offers to protect us from everything.
They have encouraged the giddy idea that none of life's natural hazards can be
left to chance. They have aspired to be masters of an imperfect universe and
the consequences of their prophylactic zeal crosses the spectrum from the
persecution of Humphrey Errington to the panic over meat pies and hamburgers.
Once, the task of public health officials was to introduce the standards of
good housewifery to the catering and food production industries. Today they
bring the criteria of the hypochondriac, whose ability to assess risk is
crippled by neurosis. From the necessary introduction of simple, sensible
directives on health, hygiene, and safety we have reached a stage where
environmental health officers prohibit restaurateurs from serving soft-boiled
eggs without first warning customers they risk salmonella poisoning.
This is the mindset which has almost ruined Humphrey Errington, who was able to
show, with the help of a gifted legal team and some disinterested expert
evidence, that the type of listeria found in batches of Lanark Blue is very
rarely associated with disease. The bug-hunters of Clydesdale District Council
seem to have been hunting the wrong bug, which didn't stop them pursuing it, in
the view of the sheriff who found the cheese innocent, in a ``combative and
confrontational manner''.
But the bug-hunters are more messenger than mastermind and the messengers
aren't the only ones who should be shot. Media melodrama, not new evidence, has
fed the latest frenzy over beef, BSE, and the food chain. Against Government
advice schools and caterering groups have been stampeded into eliminating an
important source of protein and minerals from their menus, some of which may be
nutritionally defective at the best of times.
I'm the last person in the world to place childlike trust in the soundness of
government advice. I believe, too, that there are good reasons for avoiding
processed pies, sausages, and beefburgers of the mass-produced supermarket
variety. They don't taste nice and they're full of chemicals.
But I have some sympathy for the Government's no-win position on BSE. Its
scientists can't prove a negative; they can't prove that there is no
transmitted link between mad cow disease and its neurologically devastating
human version, any more than they can prove, at the moment, that there is one.
When you can't prove a negative you can't slap a cast-iron guarantee on the
rumps of the nation's cattle and pronounce beef safe. You can only affirm your
belief that it's safe, and that hint of qualification is enough to feed the
media appetite for sensation and the public appetite for alarm.
Their latest bout of shared hysteria began to mount when the news broke that
four cattle farmers had died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. World in Action
simmered the doubts and don't-knows of the scientific community, and the Sunday
Times stirred this stew of speculative reporting by taking the orders of a
random bunch of scientists, half of whom had gone off meat products.
One or two journalists did try to balance this diet of conjecture with some
facts. In the Times, Simon Jenkins pointed out that in the same year that four
farmers died of CJD 46 non-farmers also died of the disease, and some of them
were vegetarian; that European countries which have had no BSE-infected cattle
have recorded just as many cases of CJD as Britain; and that most experts
accept that the incidence of CJD has been more or less constant for years.
But more important than the facts, which are admittedly incomplete, is the
perception. Here we detect the importunacy, the sheer bloody impertinence of
another risk which has had the temerity to defile the sterile landscape of our
risk-free environment.
Public-health policies, scientific and medical advances have had unaccountable
benefits. Generations of parents live free of nightmares which haunted their
own parents. Our mistake is to imagine that the elimination of some diseases
leads progressively to the elimination of all; the culture of viruses and
bacteria is every bit as robust, inventive, and adaptable as our own.
But the more we believe in the pristine possibility of a risk-free environment
the more we surrender our own capacity for assessing risk; and the more we look
for someone to point the finger at and say, ``It shouldn't have happened.''
There is, surely, a middle ground to be found between the passive dependants on
Huxley's brave new world and the defiant Savage, who chose the right to be
unhappy over the right to be comfortable - who claimed God, poetry, danger,
freedom, goodness, and sin along with ``the right to catch typhoid''.
Until we have more information about BSE I've found the middle ground in the
premises of my butcher, who knows the provenance of all his beef and makes his
own succulent Cambridge sausages.

TELL me about virtual reality, because I don't understand anything about it at
all. A couple of years back Lesley Riddoch of the BBC, and now back there,
joined a Scottish newspaper. A fortnight before she went to that place in North
Bridge, Edinburgh, she wrote for this blatt and claimed that she had no belief
in any sort of new technology and in fact composed whatever she did on an old
stand-up typewriter. Once pitched into the glittering full-time world of print
journalism she learned new technology in seconds, the way one does when you get
to be a deputy executive editor or whatever title takes a newspaper's fancy.
It is then, with an array of Jean Muir dresses and word-processing terminals,
that one gets to grasp the significance of how useful new technology is,
especially the usefulness of a dashed good salary. That is a reality, the
salary. At the Scotsman, Lesley's situation turned out to be merely virtual and
she ended up leaving. For the best bit about virtual reality is that it isn't
reality at all. It is nearly reality. It is almost reality. It could just be
reality. But it isn't reality.
The truly wonderful thing about all technology is when it works and is useful,
like the wheel, or the spinning jenny, or the steam engine. When it makes
changes, just for the better like. Forty years ago, when I was a boy of 12, I
heard all about the new things which could only create misery such as
unemployment throughout the world. We had visionaries then too. Later, in the
1960s, Harold Wilson went on about the new order of things. Anthony Wedgwood
Benn went on so much about the white-hot heat of technology that he burnt
himself out with the white-hot heat of it.
But today we have even more advances on Benn. A Mr Leeson was so hellbent on
virtual reality in Singapore that his reality cost his bank millions. For that
is the problem with virtual reality, isn't it? That it isn't virtual at all. It
is a chimera. In fact, to use rather a rude word, virtual reality is nothing
other, really, than something like a wank: it is not the real thing at all,
though it might do at a pinch.
I am sorry - no I'm not - about a rude word if readers object to it. Frankly
most sensible people would object to the deleterious results of new technology
in the past century or so since the Industrial Revolution and particularly in
the past decade or so, than would object to the vernacular for onanism.
Virtual reality, in the guise of television for instance, has had the effect of
an especially brutal reality. Fred West was especially addicted to virtual
anything except decency. That collection of royal strumpets are horribly fond
of such realities as a quarter of a million quids worth of ice and the
virtualness of drooping and coy glances to cameras while visiting the realities
of dying people. If anybody out there is barking enough to give any money at
all to a Princess of Wales Hospice when the adultress who allows the charity
concerned to bear her name spends more on her pants than it costs to keep an
old and dying person for a week, then you have only virtual reality to blame.
And just this week we discover that calculators are to be banned for
11-year-olds in their maths exams because the aids weren't good for them. In
fact they allowed the young persons to know nothing and learn less. Because it
was virtual reality and its very concept. Technology can do it all for you and
you don't have to think about it, old son. As it happens, calculators could
very well have helped me to pass my arithmetic tests. What they couldn't have
done was help me at all to count, which rather, well, counts. Spell-checks in
computers can tell you how to spell words properly but they can't tell you why
they are spelled so.
There is a band called Boys Own, from Ireland, who have a record out now, a
repro of the old Cat Stevens's song Mathew and Son. I seem to remember that the
B-side was a major smash and was called Moonshadow. Wet, Wet, Wet are another
musical combo. They brought out an old Troggs number. Twenty years back there
was a group called Mud which recorded a wheen of Buddy Holly songs. None of the
foregoing was as good as the original.
A wee while back Kirsty McColl recorded a Kinks song, Days. She was great at
it. I will tell you why. She was singing with reality, and nothing bloody
virtual about it. Kirsty is an accomplished singer-songwriter who has all the
reality of talent and a background (her dad was, of course, Ewan McColl, the
folk-singer), and her talent is virtue and not virtual. Sounds a bit
old-fashioned that. Right.

RETAILERS last month saw the largest rise in the volume of sales since April,
according to the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey.
The CBI said the underlying three-month trend suggested that sales volumes
remained on an upward path. But shopkeepers still regarded the level of sales
as below average for the time of year, though to their least extent for six
months.
``As we enter the critical pre-Christmas period, there are genuine signs of a
turn-round in retailers' fortunes,'' said Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI
Distributive Trades Survey Panel.
The survey follows data showing a near 13% increase in new car sales in
November and figures earlier in the week suggesting that the housing market may
be poised to recover after the fourth consecutive monthly rise in prices.
It is likely to be viewed in the City as weakening the argument for an early
interest rate cut to boost growth.
However, Mr Eperon considered the absence of a cut would restrict the recovery.
He said: ``Unless there is a cut in interest rates, we won't see a revival in
consumer confidence that the Chancellor and everyone is looking for.''
Ideally retailers would like a cut following the regular monthly meeting of the
Chancellor and the Bank of England Governor next Wednesday, as this would be in
time for the Christmas sales rush.
But Governor Eddie George is likely call for caution, pointing to the CBI
survey finding that price increases last month were the highest since May 1993,
with the trend expected to continue in December.
Mr Eperon said that intense competition would limit the extent of price rises
for shoppers.
The survey showed that most retailing sectors experienced some growth in sales
compared with a year ago.
The largest increases came in booksellers and stationers followed by grocers
and clothing retailers, while chemists, confectioners, furniture and carpet
stores saw the largest reductions in sales growth. Only specialist food
retailers saw an actual reduction in sales.
According to the survey, 50% of retailers reported that sales were up last
month compared with November 1994 while 27% said they were down.
INTERIM results from GEC pushed the shares up 12.5p to 314p, despite being
towards the lower end of expectations. This was because extra development costs
had been charged to defence profits.
Profits were 6% higher at #402m in the six months to September, helped by a
contribution from VSEL and a #13m rise in interest income to #83m. The interim
dividend is raised 5% to 3.1p.
Group net cash fell by #223m to #1200m, reflecting the VSEL acquisition. Cash
held in joint-ventures was also lower, down #194m to #1280m.
Electronic systems, the defence division which includes the key GEC-Marconi
business, was only marginally ahead at #80m, reflecting the development
provisions.
The defence interests have been increased by VSEL, which added a
submarine-building facility to the existing Yarrow yard, where heavy
redundancies are threatened. Finance director David Newlands said that both
yards needed new customers to flesh out current and expected orders.
The recent order for Yarrow's Clyde yard of three offshore patrol vessels from
Brunei had helped and he added: ``There are several orders in the UK we hope to
win, but we have to supplement these with exports.''
VSEL and other acquisitions boosted the division's order book by 22% to #6090m.
The development provisions relate to a number of large defence contracts on
which negotiations have yet to be concluded. Analysts believe the provisions
may be recouped in the contract terms.
The contribution from the GEC-Alsthom power systems operation dipped slightly
to #76m as margins were affected by competition. Its order book also fell a
little. However, group orders rose 15% to #13.8bn.
Telecommunications profits were ahead at #62m against #54m and office equipment
and printing was up sharply to #22m.
GEC points out that it is making strenuous efforts to win more business
overseas and to open up new markets for its products. Over 70% of sales are
outside the UK and exports from the UK amount to 17% of turnover, which was
only marginally up on balance at #4886m. But the UK remains the most important
profit centre, generating almost half total profits.
The group sees good opportunities in the Middle East and the fast-growing
Asia-Pacific region. It is one of the players in Britain's export successes in
the region where the UK has a trade surplus.
``The South-east Asian markets are the ones that are strong and we are still
putting a tremendous amount of effort in there,'' said Mr Newlands.

IT must be the chill winds of puritanism sweeping through the House of Commons
now that Lord Nolan and his committee have decreed strict rules on what our MPs
may or may not accept in the course of their duties.
Safeway, the supermarket people, had a festive reception for MPs who turned up,
as they do, to find out how things are going in the world of food retailing. As
they left, after their research into the above-mentioned subject, each MP was
offered a Safeway goodie bag.
In previous years this bag contained a substantial selection of Safeway's
finest produce. (The Safeway cava Spanish sparkling wine, we notice by the way,
is on offer again this year at the astonishingly attractive price of #3.99 a
bottle. We mention this not to tout for free samples but as a service to
readers.)
But this year it was a poor harvest for the MPs. The bag contained nothing more
than a tin of baked beans, Safeway's own brand.
q ON the same subject, we notice Asda is offering a boxed set of matched tie
and boxer shorts. Look out, girls, for a certain pretty pathetic chat-up line
at the office party.
State of emergency
OUR heart goes out to the folk of the South of England as they try to cope with
a bit of snow. It is obviously emergency stations - the London Evening Standard
reported ``snowdrifts three inches deep''. Or as the Diary's London office
tells us: ``We're heel-deep in snow but we hope to get by without calling out
the Hampstead mountain rescue team.''
Foreign accent
TALES from the Foreign Office: The scene is a church in Vienna (yes, Austria -
The Herald Diary spans the globe) where the British ambassador is visiting a
church bazaar. The ambassador overhears an ex-pat Brit holding a conversation
and joins in with the words: ``I didn't know you spoke Hungarian.'' The ex-pat
wasn't. He is Welsh and was speaking English. In a Welsh accent, as the Welsh
do. We tell you this only because it speaks volumes about his knowledge of both
the country next to Austria and the country next to England.
Mad Max
THE Times obituary of American sodjer General Maxwell Thurman tells us he was
known as Mad Max and his ``style of command could be aggressive in the
extreme''. He was responsible, although not personally, for the deaths of
thousands of Panamanians when he was sent in to sort out that chap Noriega. The
obit ends ``Maxwell Thurman leaves no survivors''. You bet.
Pilgrims' progress
THE queue of supernumerary Wise Men lengthens outside the stable at Bethlehem.
To explain, we asked readers as part of their Christmas homework to nominate
people in the public eye to join the three kings in their homage to the baby
Jesus and to suggest what gift they might bring.
In return we offered gifts of bottles of Langs Supreme whisky and the Langs
first-footing kit. The kit consists of a miniature, a daud of shortbread, a
lump of coal, a pinch of salt, and the words of Auld Lang Syne - in short
everything you need fora perfect Hogmanay except a phone message to say your
in-laws' car has broken down and they can't make it to your New Year party.
John Brown of East Kilbride nominates the Rev Ian Paisley who would bring a
mobile phone with free connection to the Orange network. Billy Nimmo of
Stewarton thinks that Mystic Meg could arrive bearing a lottery ticket and
offering to read the newborn's star signs.
Bill Hunter of Uddingston thinks that the Duchess of York might turn up. She
wouldn't bring a gift but would offer the services of her lady-in-waiting, Jane
Dunne-Butler, to keep an eye on the gold, frankincense and myrrh.
Michael Bruce of Millbrix Avenue in Glasgow says that no pilgrimmage to the
stable would be the same without Jim McLean of Dundee United, bearing an S form
for the lad to sign. Mr McLean would beat Rangers to this promising signing
because the Ibrox scout was too busy asking Joseph what school he had the boy
down for.
Swan song
BEING such a jolly lot, Strathclyde region councillors are wont to get together
around Christmas time and have a bit of a sing-along. Some of us thought that
they did this all year the round, but never mind.
Strathclyde's tribunes will gather for their last-ever Christmas sing-along at
the end of this month and it is a fund-raiser for charity. And which good cause
has been chosen by the regional councillors who will suffer feelings of loss
when Strathclyde closes in April? The Cruse Bereavement Counselling Group.
Ys decision
FOR those of you whose imagination on the Christmas-present front is limited,
can we suggest you buy a loved one a pair of underpants or a vest. The
difference is that these particular items are very artistic. (Not that the St
Michael variety aren't, to let you understand.)
They are to be found framed at the Christmas exhibition at the Glasgow Print
Studio. They are the work of one Morna Simpson who specialises in multi-media
art which can consist of a bit of painting, sculpture, and a bit of fabric.
Morna's multi-media underwear comes in a touch more expensive than M&amp;S at #170
each for the semmit and drawers.

IN THE beginning there was the life. Now, the marketing. Sinatra at 80 is not
just a fine excuse for a lavish worldwide birthday party but for looking back -
His Way - through a library of books and compilations of his work. It involves
fans in a massive investment of time and money.
Just one collection, the extraordinary Frank Sinatra: The Complete Reprise
Studio Recordings, requires 24-hours non-stop to listen to it all. The
suggested retail price is $499. Overflowing with 450 songs the set is the most
lavish and revealing of all the albums to be released to celebrate Tuesday's
landmark birthday.
It is a mark of the devotion of Sinatra fans that such an expensive item -
certainly for most Christmas stockings - is selling briskly in America. Then
again, Sinatra is the most American of creations. Where else could that skinny
kid from Hoboken, New Jersey, go on to be the most acclaimed singer ever in pop
music? He became the consummate balladeer, saloon singer and big band vocalist
who dazzled with the sophistication of his phrasing but still gave intimacy and
warmth to his music. There were highs and lows but Sinatra was always Sinatra.
Mix in the rainbow of rumours, every one more colourful than the next, of a
horse's head in a movie producer's bed (supposedly to win his Oscar winning
role as Maggio in From Here to Eternity) and Mafia connections, of booze and
broads and feuds, of a Runyonesque life with sharp edges, and we get some
understanding of why Sinatra, at 80, has caused such a fanfare.
How, you wonder, did he get this far after all the years of indulgence but, of
course, that's all part of the legend of Ol' Blue Eyes.
His eldest daughter Nancy is now 55 and her book Frank Sinatra, An American
Legend (Virgin Books, #25) is structured around a couple of decades of talking
to her father and compiling a unique set of photographs. Of his three children
(Frank Junior is 51, Tina 47) she is the closest - literally.
They live less than a mile from each other in Beverly Hills and talk almost
every day. Sinatra has not given an interview in 20 years. As I recall it was
to a writer from Esquire magazine. The interview was to take place before a
Sinatra concert in California. The Esquire man arrived early for his meeting.
Even the public relations people had public relations people. Then, the great
man strolled in and the interview began with Sinatra smiling and saying: ``Hey,
buddy, nice to see you.'' That's also how it ended.
So, to describe Nancy Sinatra as her father's mouthpiece is accurate. He has
never confronted the allegations including Mob links and cruelty to women in
Kitty Kelley's 1986 best-selling attack His Way. He tried to stop publication
but that only added to the notoriety and put on sales.
His daughter sees her book as having ``taken up the gauntlet''. She says her
father who in recent public appearances has seemed confused and lost is pleased
that she is fighting in his corner.
``I wanted to make a straight record, tell the truth about my father's life. I
know he's been aching to do it but to get into a pissing contest with that
woman would have just sold more books and wouldn't accomplish anything. There
isn't anything in my book that isn't true. If I can't prove it I take it out.
If I just print the fluffy stuff, the benefits, the times he helped people's
suffering, it would be a whitewash, and what would be the point of that?''
So she confronts the Mafia and the misogyny. Of course, her father worked for
gangsters in nightclubs and Las Vegas - as did every other entertainer. Women?
She doesn't like the word ``womaniser'' but admits it fits. Kitty Kelley's
collection of half a century of Sinatra stories she dismisses giving as an
example: ``There's a story about my father being sued for breach of promise in
the early days yet nobody ever mentions that the woman turned out to have been
already married. What upsets me about these stories is once they are out there
they get endlessly repeated.''
Despite this if you turn to books by others, most recently Shirley MacLaine's
Thank Your Lucky Stars, you get a picture of Sinatra as a bully, of a man who
liked to hang out with mobsters and who, latterly, would enjoy to drink
expensive wine and then harangue the hoodlums at his table. Nancy Sinatra's
truth does not have to be questioned - just the perception of it.
It's a good, intriguing catalogue - a historical item for Sinatra devotees - of
the life and times of Sinatra. You just feel his FBI files - started in 1941 by
J Edgar Hoover who believed Ol' Blue Eyes was a Red, a Communist - would be
even more intriguing.
Nancy Sinatra says she's seen the files: ``They're just allegations that prove
nothing.'' One allegation was that he acted as a ``bagman'' delivering a
suitcase of money to Mafia kingpin ``Lucky'' Luciano in Havana.
That was yesterday. Today Nancy Sinatra says her father still misses
performing. ``He is still physically strong enough to do it. His health is
quite good. He does have this problem with a pinched nerve in his neck which
affects his facial expression. A couple of times he has been photographed in
that kind of pain which is unfortunate.''
He still enjoys a drink but now it's a cocktail before dinner that usually is
never finished. He does get through his glass of vintage red wine with the
meal. He gave up smoking 10 years ago but is back on the Camels again. ``I'm
nearly 80, so what the hell?'' his daughter quotes him but adds: ``He takes a
couple of puffs outside, never inside the house, and I wonder if he really
enjoys it.''
Surprisingly, she says her father is not as rich as we might think. ``He's
given most of it away over the years. I'm not a princess and I'm not an
heiress. He didn't set up trust funds for my brother, sister and me. He figured
we'd handle things on our own and instead gave it to people who were in need of
it. He took very good care of my mother always, still does.''
She says she cried for a week when her father married Barbara Marx in 1976. She
wanted him to remarry her mother Nancy. ``I will always wish that my parents
had remarried. It was more than a child's wild fantasy. At one time it became a
probability because they were spending a lot of time together just prior to
Barbara and Dad becoming engaged.''
Barbara Marx, now 65, turned out to be the longest serving wife of the man so
classically dubbed St Francis of Assisi with a shoulder holster. The
entertainer who is part myth, monster and marvel now suffers from
microangiopathy of the brain which springs sudden attacks of dizziness,
confusion and often long periods of memory loss. His wife has supported him
through it.
He can still be bad mannered, bad tempered and bad news but those around the
self-styled ``saloon singer'' believe he should put his feet up. Nancy and Tina
- who produced a memorable television biography of her father - sincerely want
him to stop appearing in public.
Today's image is of a man who has lost it. He's collapsed on stage, he's
forgotten the lines of some of his most famous songs. His daughters do not wish
him to continue to be a mumbling embarrassment.
They feel his fans want to remember him as the legend who went from bobbysoxers
to broads, who met The Mob and The Kennedys, who fought feuds, enjoyed insults
and indulged in boozy, brawling behaviour. As the man who when he played Las
Vegas the neon billboards just proclaimed ``He's Here''. For gamblers the
Nevada town was where luck and Sinatra competed for absolute deity.
``Frank is an old man now and most of the people around him are concerned about
his health,'' said a close associate before adding: ``Barbara felt that having
engagements and recordings kept him active - gave him something to get out of
bed for. But now he's 80 - and showing it - they just want him happy and
content.''
Family friends and associates paint a curious picture of Sinatra today. ``He's
mellowed,'' says one. That is countered by another: ``He's a real mean
bastard.'' And you must recall that in the swinging days some of his close
friends called him The Monster.
Sinatra has always been acutely aware of his mortality. Many of his family from
his mother Dolly to friends like Sammy Davis Junior, Peter Lawford, songwriters
Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Huesen with whom he used to have regular Monday night
poker games, and Jackie Kennedy Onassis whom he wanted to marry have gone. When
he gave charity lectures his closing line was always: ``I hope you all live to
be 400-years-old and the last voice you hear is mine.''
``Frank is now obsessed with dying - with it all ending,'' I was told by a
Sinatra watcher. Sinatra himself tells Nancy in her book: ``You gotta love
living, baby. Dying's a pain in the arse.''
Before he sold up in Palm Springs estate he kept a lighted Christmas tree at
the front of what he called ``The Compound'' 365 days a year explaining: ``An
extra Christmas never hurt anybody.''
A close friend explained today's Sinatra: ``He's had a rough, tough life and
you are talking a classic burning the candle at both ends personality. We just
want him to take care of himself - to enjoy the September of his days. He's
sung about them often enough.
``But he does have an opinion on how he wants to run his life - and let's
everyone know it.
``He enjoys staying home now. He likes to have familiar things and people
around him. It's strange but I think he gets a little scared with strangers and
strange places. It's hard to imagine but that's how it is. He is now a man of
routine. He likes his comforts and his place.''
Our perception of him is as a breaker of hearts and legs but there is the
saintly side - he's given more than $250m to charity. Today he doesn't even
bother wearing someone else's hair - the toupees are still shampooed every
evening - and Hawaiian shirts which just about disguise the girth.
The overwhelming image from talking to those who know Sinatra at 80 is that he
is a cranky, conservative old man who lives remembering old scores and even
recalling to start new ones. There have been many long, hot days of egomania
but he has never sought sympathy. If anything it was his voice which has aged
gracefully. But he can no longer with ease fly people to the moon or invite
luck to be a lady this or that particular night.
Over the years the myths have multiplied and how much is fact or fascinating
fiction only he knows. One thing is certain and that's that there would require
much polish - more than Nancy Sinatra has provided - to wipe away the tarnish.
Barbara Sinatra has been working at it since she became his fourth wife on July
12, 1976. It's not been easy. She was 44 when she married Sinatra. A former Las
Vegas showgirl and former wife of Marx brother Zeppo and the single mother of a
grown up son from a teenaged married life has been tough and then pleasantly
indulgent. She was not some ingenue on long, shapely legs. She knew what she
wanted from being Mrs Francis Albert Sinatra.
She mellowed him faster than a crate of his favourite Jack Daniels bourbon. She
advised. She controlled. She talked him out of playing a Mafia Don in Godfather
3.
Her influence has been much more than any other of Sinatra's women including
the love of his life Ava Gardner, his first wife Nancy, Mia Farrow and lovers
like Lauren Bacall, Natalie Wood, Juliet Prowse and Gloria Vanderbilt. Nancy
Sinatra says: ``There has been so much garbage written about my father it is
time to turn it around. When you consider what he has done he deserves better
treatment than he has received.'' But that's a daughter talking.
Most of us would accept Sinatra as an extraordinary mix of heel and hero. There
are the stories of constant, callous womanising, his heartless treatment of his
first wife Nancy when she was in hospital after giving birth to Frank Junior,
insulting behaviour to Natalie Wood during their affair, his arranged abortion
for Elizabeth Taylor, cruelty to Mia Farrow, his affair with Lauren Bacall as
Humphrey Bogart lay dying of cancer, and his subsequent six-year campaign of
silence against her when she told the world they were engaged.
And of the third Nancy in his life - Nancy Reagan - of whom he said before she
even scented the White House: ``A dope with fat ankles who could never make it
as an actress.''
Despite the lurid tales he has for decades been on record and film one of the
century's most popular entertainers.
The image today is of an 80-year-old man who fervently believed he could call
as well as sing any tune.
And as Sinatra-mania soars to a crescendo he probably still does.
The world's favourite crooner turns 80 on Tuesday but, as Douglas Thompson
explains, even an older, mellow Frank Sinatra has maintained an everlasting
romance with his fans

A BITTER attack was launched yesterday on Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
after he confirmed that responsibility for awarding further education student
bursaries was being transferred from councils to colleges in April.
Councillor Rosemary McKenna, president of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, said she would no longer believe anything Mr Forsyth said about
consultation until she saw it happening.
``We can only say that the Secretary of State speaks with forked tongue,'' she
said.
Mr Forsyth agreed last month to consult on the future of bursary disbursements
after Cosla expressed its concern about his plans. However, Mrs McKenna said
Cosla had heard nothing more until yesterday, when the Scottish Office
confirmed that the transfer was going ahead.
The 43 colleges have been removed from local government control and Mr Forsyth
said that adding bursaries to their other services would enable them to
``deliver an attractive, integrated approach to students''.
The resources which central Government will allocate to local government in
1996-7 will be reduced by about #50m - the value of bursaries.

RETAILERS last month saw the largest rise in the volume of sales since April,
according to the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey.
The CBI said the underlying three-month trend suggested that sales volumes
remained on an upward path. But shopkeepers still regarded the level of sales
as below average for the time of year, though to their least extent for six
months.
``As we enter the critical pre-Christmas period, there are genuine signs of a
turn-round in retailers' fortunes,'' said Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI
Distributive Trades Survey Panel.
The survey follows data showing a near 13% increase in new car sales in
November and figures earlier in the week suggesting that the housing market may
be poised to recover after the fourth consecutive monthly rise in prices.
It is likely to be viewed in the City as weakening the argument for an early
interest rate cut to boost growth.
However, Mr Eperon considered the absence of a cut would restrict the recovery.
He said: ``Unless there is a cut in interest rates, we won't see a revival in
consumer confidence that the Chancellor and everyone is looking for.''
Ideally retailers would like a cut following the regular monthly meeting of the
Chancellor and the Bank of England Governor next Wednesday, as this would be in
time for the Christmas sales rush.
But Governor Eddie George is likely call for caution, pointing to the CBI
survey finding that price increases last month were the highest since May 1993,
with the trend expected to continue in December.
Mr Eperon said that intense competition would limit the extent of price rises
for shoppers.
The survey showed that most retailing sectors experienced some growth in sales
compared with a year ago.
The largest increases came in booksellers and stationers followed by grocers
and clothing retailers, while chemists, confectioners, furniture and carpet
stores saw the largest reductions in sales growth. Only specialist food
retailers saw an actual reduction in sales.
According to the survey, 50% of retailers reported that sales were up last
month compared with November 1994 while 27% said they were down.

<TEXT>
WORLD oil prices continued to rise yesterday, pushed higher by icy weather
across Europe and also due to hit the United States.
North Sea Brent crude, the world oil-price benchmark, hit a five-month high of
$17.75 a barrel on the London futures market, before slipping later as traders
pocketed profits from the rise. By London closing, Brent had softened to $17.58.
``We've had a bit of a shock over the last few days (with the weather) and it's
given oil a very healthy helping hand,'' said Alistair Harris of London brokers
Mees Pierson.
Private US forecaster Weather Services Corp said cold weather would lift
heating demand well above normal levels in the key energy-consuming northeast
and midwest United States early next week, and in Europe over the weekend.
``My only worry is we're going up so sharply before the cold weather actually
begins (in the US),'' said Ahmed al-Awa of London brokers Prudential-Bache.
The resurgent threat of an oil workers' strike in Venezuela, a key supplier to
the US, gave further support to prices, traders said.
Talks between workers and state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) on
pay broke off on Wednesday without reaching an agreement and union leaders have
now renewed strike calls.
Oil's rise came in the teeth of record world oil output in November shown in
monthly data released yesterday by the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
The IEA said a recovery in Mexican production after October's hurricane damage
together with increases from the North Sea and elsewhere, pushed world oil
supply up by 1.41 million barrels per day in November to a record 71.7 million
bpd.

TORY MP David Ashby's wife told the High Court in London yesterday of an
occasion in which she was in no doubt that he was admitting to her that he was
homosexual.
Mrs Silvana Ashby, who separated from the MP in 1993, said their sex life had
not been satisfactory, and his indifference had progressed to verbal and
physical abuse.
When Mr Ashby returned from America in 1992, where he had visited his
homosexual brother, Brian, and his partner, he said he could not stand to stay
with her any more.
When he told her that October that he would be moving out when his new flat was
ready, she insisted he tell her why. ``He said `I have got to tell you
something. I have changed.' He started to cry.''
Asked what he meant, he said: ``I had an encounter many years ago. Then I put
it out of my mind, and now I can't.''
She also started to cry, put her arms round him, and asked what she could do.
``I said: `If you have changed once, you can change again'. He said: `It is not
as easy as that'.''
Mrs Ashby said: ``I was in no doubt that he was telling me he was homosexual.''
Mr Ashby, 55, is claiming damages over allegations that he shared a double bed
with a man friend during a holiday in Goa at the end of 1993.
Times Newspapers and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil deny libel. They
accept that Mr Ashby did not holiday with a man in Goa, but assert that he was,
and is, having an affair with 32-year-old Dr Ciaran Kilduff.
The hearing continues.

<HEADLINE>Gascoigne is now a liability Luxury Rangers cannot afford</HEADLINE>

PAUL Gascoigne arrived in Glasgow making it clear he admired and respected
Rangers' manager Walter Smith, but words are cheap especially in professional
football where the glib comment and blatant lie are common currency. So far as
I can see Gascoigne, a troubled soul it has to be said, has done nothing to
help his manager or his club, whose disapppointing Champions' League campaign
ended in failure.
Of course, if you regard increases in the sales of club merchandise as the most
important measure of a footballer's worth then Gascoigne probably has been a
success already. There is little doubt either that his presence has helped
create interest and sell tickets, but it is important to remember it isn't
enough for a footballer merely to be there. No matter how many strips, posters
or T-shirts are sold players must give something back on the pitch.
Despite what appears to be the common belief in some boardrooms, there is more
to football than paying out transfer fees on ``big names.'' Surely there has to
be some kind of return because the only thing that matters is performances on
the pitch, and no matter who wears the strips the patience of fans grows thin
when players who arrive, usually after their over-blown reputations, fail to
carry their weight.
Gascoigne is such a player. He has played well only sporadically and even those
supporters who were content to go along with Smith, who insisted Gascoigne
required time to regain full fitness after the various injury problems which
have dogged his career, are questioning football's John McEnroe.
Rangers' most controversial player and McEnroe were similar in that neither
could control his emotions yet each was blessed with sporting genius. McEnroe,
however, was able to demonstrate his superior skills more often than Gascoigne
and that is the most damning truth about the footballer.
Despite chairman David Murray's apparent backing for the player, Gascoigne
simply cannot be relied upon to perform at or near his best on a regular basis
and to my mind that makes him a  liability to a club which longs to operate
among the elite. He is a luxury they can't afford.
In recent premier division matches the midfield player has looked good, playing
with vision and thought way beyond just about everyone else. Also, in the first
half of the Champions' League match against Borussia Dortmund the other night
he threatened to have a great influence on the midfield, but it is at these
very times, moments when we begin to believe in the real Gascoigne, that he
loses it.
Having already been booked for a first-half foul on Andreas Moller the Rangers
player felt aggrieved when Spanish referee Manuel Diaz Vega didn't award a
penalty, apparently for handball, to Rangers. Gascoigne's mouth went into
overdrive.
The referee had no option but to send him off for the first time in his Rangers
career even if it was suggested afterwards Diaz Vega had forgotten he had
already booked Gascoigne. The story from Dortmund goes that the official would
have decided against brandishing a second yellow card if he had remembered
about the earlier punishment, but the fact is that the Spaniard did what some
referees in Scotland should have done long ago.
Gascoigne faces an automatic one-game ban when Rangers next play in Europe, but
he could face a stiffer penalty because he was also booked in one of the games
against Steaua Bucharest. ``The case will be considered by the control and
disciplinary committee on January 11 and it is possible the ban will be more
than one match,'' said a UEFA committee member.
Although Smith has spoken to Gascoigne about the dismissal and the player's
failure to curb his temper he would not say what action, if any, the club will
take, but the manager must be at his wit's end. Fining a player of Gascoigne's
wealth wouldn't mean a great deal and even if it was decided to put him under
house arrest for a few weeks there would be no guarantees. The extremely
fragile nature of Gascoigne's temperament and the complexities which must exist
within the mind of someone in command of so much talent and at the same time
stupidity make him unpredictable and volatile.
Rangers might find that changing SFA policy would be easier than changing
Gascoigne, who appears destined to be torn between greatness and disgrace. It
is a pity, but so far he has been more trouble than he is worth to the Ibrox
club and the Scottish game in general.
There is no substitute for skill, but when it is contained within an enigma
surrounded by question marks the chances are it will all end in tears. Rangers
might have to release Gascoigne just as Lazio did and we must fear the worst
for the player, who will sit out his club's next two premier division matches
because of suspension.
Rangers, in the meantime, could learn from their humbling experience in the
Champions' League and it is still Smith's intention to introduce a couple of
new players, Mikkel Beck and Jardel, but the notion is to move soon so that the
newcomers would have almost half a season in which to bed into the Ibrox
set-up. Then, and provided Smith's side win their eighth successive
championship, Rangers might be better equipped next time around.

A SCOTTISH development side, managed by former Scotland and British Lions
wing-threequarter Roger Baird and coached by Glasgow Academicals' New Zealand
coach Kevin Greene, is to be created to bridge the gap between under-21 level
and the A-team set-up, writes Derek Douglas.
The new squad, which will be created early next year, will have its first
representative outing against New South Wales at Netherdale on February 11.
Baird has been appointed manager and chairman of selectors with George Blackie,
on the SRU general committee, as convener. Greene will be assisted by
Boroughmuir coach Henry Edwards, who will look after the forwards. National
squad co-ordinator Roy Laidlaw will assist with technical administration.
The development squad will initially number more than 21 players and the SRU
plan to have a warm-up game before the NSW fixture.
Yesterday, SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer said: ``The development squad will
provide players with a further bridge to make that all-important transition in
fitness, technique, and commitment between under-age, club, and district rugby
and the higher standards needed at international level.
``It will also act as a means of encouraging talented players to remain in the
game, by providing them with both first-class training and incentive - and one
clear encouragement is the prospect of significant fixtures both home and away,
giving our emerging players additional exposure to top-flight rugby,'' he said.
q FORMER All Black Colin Meads has been sacked as manager of New Zealand, who
have named Ross Cooper and Gordon Hunter as selectors alongside new coach John
Hart.
One of the newly chosen pair will become assistant coach to Hart, who was named
as successor to Laurie Mains yesterday.
Meads is replaced by Mike Banks, a hotelier who has been a member of the New
Zealand Rugby Football Union council for only two years. Banks was a full back
for the Manawatu provincial team in the late 1970s.

THE road to Hampden begins in earnest tomorrow when the first round of the
Tennents Scottish Cup gets underway, and bringing an intellectual touch to the
competition this year are the boys from Glasgow University.
It is more likely that they will display a budding Bamber Gascoigne rather than
a Paul when they take on East of Scotland side Spartans in Glasgow in the first
round proper, but they do take their football seriously.
And, as this is the university football club's centenary year, they aim to make
it extra special with a decent cup run.
Mind you, tradition is all against that happening. It is 20 years since the
students last appeared in the competition proper. They did survive the first
round by virtue of a bye, but, in the second round after holding Albion Rovers
to a 1-1 draw at Cliftonhill, they went down by the only goal of the game in
the replay.
A bye also shot them into the second round in the 1970-71 season, but they lost
2-1 to Clachnacuddin in Inverness.
Two years before that, they did manage to get into the hat with the big boys
again, having been given a bye, then winning a second round preliminary tie
against St Cuthbert Wanderers. In the first round proper, they were paired with
Kilmarnock at Rugby Park and lost 6-0.
But, here they are again, as hopeful as ever of making their mark, if not an
impact.
Said manager Donnie Ferguson: ``The club was formed in 1877, but was defunct in
the 1880s and was not re-formed until 1895. That's why we celebrate our
centenary this year.
``Our big problem in the cup is that the qualifying section starts when the
students are still on holiday, but this year, they came back from all parts to
play. That brought us our success in getting through to this first round.''
For two of the players, defeat will mean the last time they turn out for the
side. The players are all students, and when they leave university, they leave
the team.
Defenders Robbie Mitchell and Steve Duffy, who have both started work, are
allowed to continue for the cup run as they were involved in the earlier ties.
Meantime, Eamonn Bannon will have a double interest in tomorrow's first round.
The former Hearts and Dundee United winger will be in the Stenhousemuir side
which faces Arbroath in the opening round, but he will also want to know the
result of the tie between Glasgow University and Spartans as soon as he comes
off the pitch.
Spartans manager Sam Lynch explained: ``After Eamonn left Hearts, he came along
to our training sessions. Originally, it was to keep himself ticking over, but
he soon got involved in doing a bit of coaching. He is very thoughtful about
the game, and his help is appreciated.''
Spartans, from the East of Scotland League, include former Hibernian and
Partick Thistle striker Paul McGovern and central defender Mark Thomson, who
had a spell with Meadowbank.
Added Lynch: ``We are looking forward to the visit to     Glasgow. The
incentive for both teams is to get through to meet East fife in the next round.
``We have watched University, and they are a good side. It will be a fairly
open game.''
q COVENTRY City manager Ron Atkinson will have to play a waiting game if he
wants to sign Dave McPherson from Hearts.
Atkinson has been in touch with the Tynecastle side over the future of
McPherson but the former Scotland defender is out of action until Christmas
because of a groin injury.
Coventry's defence has been leaking goals at an alarming rate recently and
Atkinson wants a new man in place before tomorrow's clash with Blackburn Rovers
at Highfield Road.
But with McPherson sidelined, he will now have to decide whether to hang fire
until McPherson is fit, or look elsewhere.

THE English and Welsh unions will receive their clubs' blueprint of the way
ahead for club rugby following a meeting in Bristol yesterday.
Three representatives from each of the limited companies set up to serve the
interests of the 12 clubs in the Heineken League first division and 10 Courage
League clubs have thrashed out plans for the future competitive structure of
non-representative rugby.
The Welsh delegates will report back to their clubs at a meeting next week and
are expected to present their plans to the WRU before Christmas.
In a joint statement, the groups said: ``Representatives of First Division
Rugby Limited and English First Division Rugby Limited had a very wide-ranging,
constructive meeting in Bristol today and will be seeking approval next week
from all their fellow representatives for the domestic, Anglo-Welsh, and
European rugby structure discussed at the meeting.''
Among their list of demands to the governing bodies will be a greater share of
TV and sponsorship deals and bigger representation on decision-making bodies.
q RUGBY league is set to become faster and more attractive as a result of four
rule changes which will come into force from Monday in all Rugby Football
League matches.
The changes, which have been given the go-ahead by the Rugby League Council,
are: No striking at the play-the-ball; the ball must be played backwards at the
play-the-ball; scrums will be taken 20 metres from touch instead of 10; the
scoring team will restart play after a score.
RFL chief executive Maurice Lindsay said: ``Our aim is to make the game of
rugby league as exciting and thrilling as possible for our supporters. We
believe that these new moves will do exactly that.
``The two new play-the-ball rules tidy up this area of the game, while the 20m
scrum opens up a wide range of attacking options and the change in the restart
of play will ensure excitement right up to the final hooter.''
Played yesterday
Bank of Scotland Scottish Schools Cup. First round - Queen Victoria 23,
Galashiels Academy 10; Edinburgh Academy 20, Gordonstoun 24.

THERE are about 20 million contributors, pensioners, and deferred members in UK
pension schemes. Very few give the administration of their schemes much thought.
Like most other people, when I started paying contributions my concerns were
confined to the additional income after retirement, which would make old age
more bearable. As a shop steward at Rosyth Dockyard in 1983, I became involved
in the development of Labour's Alternative Economic Strategy manifesto. Within
the manifesto was a proposal that those who contributed to the scheme should
become more involved in its operations and investment policies.
My interest was rekindled on reading an article in the Financial Times in March
1990. Among the mass of figures and jargon, something stood out. Between 1979
and 1989, the percentage of pension funds invested overseas had risen from 6%
to 24%. The European Federation for Retirement Provision estimates that by 1993
this had risen to 31.2%. To that can be added about 8% which is invested in
other European Union member states. Or, in other words, with up to #500bn now
in the funds' coffers, nearly #200bn of pension fund assets are overseas.
What would that money do if it was invested in Britain?
Two years ago, I published a pamphlet entitled ``So whose pension funds are
they, anyway?'' This looked at the issues of investment policy and
accountability to members. Earlier this year, we began to update that leaflet,
and decided to look at the involvement of pension funds in privatised companies.
Now we have published a new pamphlet - ``Global Village Economics'' - which
ties in the operation of the financial institutions to the European Union's
approach to unemployment, and global trade and capital movement. It contains
the results of a study of UK pension funds, including the top 50 by market
value, and all the local authority funds. It is, I believe, the first to look
at how much money the various funds have invested in privatised industries.
I am not opposed to money being invested overseas, although I would prefer it
if such investments were influenced by considerations such as workers getting
decent pay and conditions, the environment not being degraded, fair trade, and
human rights.
The problem is that, individually and as a nation, we have very little control
of this money. It could ruin us, and perhaps the European Union too, or it
could lead our economy to recovery. While Westminster politicians are
scrambling around for a billion or two with which to perform economic miracles,
pension funds have all that money invested abroad.
Even the money which remains here in the UK is not being used in the best
long-term interests of the British people. Look at the role of the funds in the
British Gas debacle, and the way financial institutions have lobbied to push up
water bills. Profits are more important than service, delivery, and public
opinion. That's the way the system is set up.
Local authority funds are particularly significant, because I believe that
their accountability should extend not only to the members of the scheme, but
also to the public. While there are restrictions on the operation of pension
funds, such as investing for the best return regardless of any other
consideration, there is no legal bar to publicising how funds are invested.
Perhaps a wider knowledge of their activities will bring demands for changes in
how they are administered.
UK pension funds are major shareholders in former public utilities, although
this is not immediately obvious from annual reports of the privatised
companies. Financial institutions are probably majority shareholders in most of
the privatised sector. Individual shareholders are a shrinking minority.
The survey results suggest that local authority funds have #4.5bn invested in
privatised companies, and that the total for all funds is over #40bn. Such
companies account for up to 12% of pension funds' investment, with over #9bn in
various electricity companies, about #6.5bn in BP, over #6bn in BT, nearly #5bn
in British Gas, and about #4.5bn in water companies.
Just think about that the next time you hear a report of a massive pay rise or
share-options deal for a privatised company executive or chairperson. Or the
next time a water company announces massive profits after cutting off consumers.
The pamphlet also examines the growth of European Union unemployment (now more
than 20 million people), proposals to tackle this with a European recovery
plan, and the problems which such a plan would face because of the freedom of
capital movement enjoyed by pension funds and other financial institutions.
Such programmes could be fatally undermined by the lack of democratic control
of the financial institutions. There should be a radical rethink of our
economic structures to counter this.
Other problems also have a bearing on our ability to tackle unemployment.
Maastricht's convergence criteria cannot be met without disastrous economic
consequences. France is now experiencing the pain which this will involve.
Maastricht demands severe cutbacks in the welfare state.
Gatt ignores social and environmental issues, and severely diminishes the
ability of the EU's member states to control their own economies. Agreements
similar to Gatt are now being sought on foreign direct investment. However,
even Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, is now experiencing problems
with investment moving overseas. Social and environmental clauses should be
incorporated into any new international economic agreement.
Next year's Inter Governmental Conference would be a superb opportunity for all
this to be debated, but I must admit to being pessimistic about the chances of
this happening. They will probably end up debating the Conservative Party's
anti-social tendencies once again.
Labour should not fall into this trap. We must develop an alternative to this
mad system of unfettered capitalism. If that means formulating policy which
extends accountability of these funds to people then we should not shy away
from it. It may, however, prove too much like common ownership for some
sections of the party.

TRUST the bar treasurer to hit the jackpot when a drinks prize is up for grabs!
As the race for Herald Selector Rugby's prizes intensifies, Jock Henderson,
from Crailing, near Jedburgh, has captured the November prize of #500 and a
case of champagne by just a single point - the narrowest winning margin to date
in the competition.
The chase for the overall prize of a trip for two to New Zealand, to see
Scotland play the All Blacks, is even closer. The leading two contenders are
absolutely deadlocked, according to the organisers, Scottish Rugby magazine.
Mr Henderson, a Jed-Forest supporter, who looks after the bar finances at
Riverside, might have won more conclusively but for injuries, notably to
Heriot's regular kicker, Cameron Glasgow, and his own club's international
scrum half, Gary Armstrong.
Armstrong's absence also curtailed the potential of Jock's other selection from
his own club - Ronnie Kirkpatrick, who normally feeds off Armstrong to telling
effect. This season, Jed's two flankers have been the more profitable back row
men.
Ironically, eight Jed players reached double figures during November.
Like his father before him, Jock, an accountant, played for the club for the
best part of 20 years: ``though with no distinction - I was a rather slow
front-row forward,'' he confesses. His winning team for November was:
Gavin Hastings (Watsonians); Kenny Logan (Stirling County), Scott Hastings
(Watsonians), Graham Shiel (Melrose), Cammy Glasgow (Heriot's); George
Breckenridge (GHK), Gary Armstrong (Jed-Forest); Peter Wright (Boroughmuir),
Kevin McKenzie (Stirling County), Alan Kittle (Stewart's-Melville, now
Watsonians), Stewart Campbell (Dundee HS FP), Jeremy Richardson (Edinburgh
Academicals), Bruce Ward (Currie), Ronnie Kirkpatrick (Jed-Forest), Murray
Wallace (GHK).
Selectors of last month's 10 leading teams were:
J Henderson (Jedburgh) 218 points; 2, D Harvey (Kilmacolm) 217; 3 equal, C
Lyall (Pollockshields) and R Harvey (Bearsden) both 211; 5 equal, A Peel
(Alloa) and J Scott (Irvine) both 207; 7, R Henry (Helmsdale), 205; 8, E
Donaldson (Balerno), 203; 9 equal, I McNair (Perth) and J Niven (Dumbarton)
both 202.
Neither Mr Henderson, nor any of the contending teams or the November award, is
in the immediate running for outright victory, but the stage is set for a
nail-biting conclusion when the final postponed matches are played a week on
Saturday.
At the end of November the overall lead was shared by Mr D MacGregor
(Lochgoilhead) and Mr N Anderson (Edinburgh), on 711 points. Ally Donaldson,
the Currie stand-off who heads Selector Rugby's points table, has his own
personal team in sixth place, four points behind that of his wife, Elaine. Her
eighth place in the November rankings was achieved with a different XV from
that chasing the overall prize. Just 40 points cover the leading 10 contenders:
1 equal, D MacGregor (Lochgoilhead) and N Anderson (Edinburgh) 711; 3, K
Murdoch (Troon) 700; 4, W Kinross (Tillicoultry) 692; 5, E Donaldson (Balerno)
684; 6, A Donaldson (Balerno) 680; 7, D B McNicol (Stenhousemuir) 675; 8, M
Liddle (Tillicoultry) 673; 9 equal, D Beckwith (Troon) and L Greer (Glasgow)
671.

IT was a visibly confident Tony Blair who set out the task facing Labour in the
run-up to the next election: to counter Tory ``lies'' about devolution and
speak the truth of a New Union for Britain built on a Scottish parliament in
Edinburgh with tax-raising powers.
Although he made clear Labour will not tamper with the standard rate of tax in
Scotland - and will say so in its manifesto for the new parliament - there will
be no dilution of Labour's commitment to home rule. Devolution as envisaged by
the Constitutional Convention was a logical solution to the problem -
acknowledged by Michael Forsyth - that change to the way Scotland is governed
is necessary.
In a detailed interview, in which he spoke with ease on both the principle and
the complexities of devolution, the Labour leader said the party would defend
its corner with vigour against Tory propaganda. The briefing folder prepared by
his staff remained unopened on the coffee table as Tony Blair described his
personal, uncluttered vision of constitutional reform, and called on voters -
and the business community - to believe Labour policy rather than Tory lies.
Michael Forsyth, by his words and St Andrew's Day reforms, had conceded the
argument that change is necessary, he said. Labour offered the best solution
for making accountable the Scottish Office, with its 15,000 civil servants
providing services across nine Government departments, run by
Westminster-controlled politicians.
``The purpose of devolution is to get from a situation in which you have a
Scottish Office and a vast bureaucracy around it that isn't directly
accountable to the situation where local services are delivered by a body that
is directly accountable,'' he said.
The Scottish Secretary has lost the argument and admitted the need for change,
he said. ``He has been forced to admit that the status quo no longer holds. I
think that was a strategic move of enormous importance because from that moment
on the issue is no longer whether there's change but what type of change.'' And
on that question, as on others, the public will recognise that the Tories are
``disastrously wrong for Scotland''.
But with Mr Forsyth and Tory Central Office gearing up their campaign to
preserve the Union against change, Tony Blair understands that it remains up to
Labour to make the case for devolution and the Convention's plan for a Scottish
parliament.
``What we do from now is we counter the lies, we speak the truth, we make the
case, and we make it not just to the ordinary citizens of Scotland who get a
better democratic deal, but to business to show how they will get a better deal
for business.''
On the detailed workings of a Scottish parliament, Mr Blair appears to accept
the risks of strains between Edinburgh and Westminster as an unavoidable - and
above all manageable - by-product of reform. Having to arbitrate between a
Scottish parliament demanding the scope to pay for its ambitions, and a
Chancellor Gordon Brown struggling to impose restraint on the public finances,
is clearly tomorrow's problem.
``There can always be tensions between different parts of constitutional
government,'' he said. It all boils down to a process of negotiation, like the
annual debate with the Treasury over Scottish Office funding. ``I can't really
believe these things are insuperable or beyond the wit of individuals to
resolve, in the same way that they have, of course, to be resolved now.''
On the timing for implementation of a Sottish parliament, he had no answer.
There is a difference of opinion developing between various Scottish Labour
politicians: some believe it can be done quickly, arguing that once the
legislation is in place the parliament could take over the running of the
Scottish Office within a year. Others see several years of hard legislative
slog just to get the change on the books, and even longer to prepare the
parliament.
It would be foolish to announce a date for when the first ``order, order'' will
echo over Calton Hill, he said, ``but it is a priority, we believe in it. I
really don't think there can be any doubt that we believe in it.''
Any suspicion that might exist that Mr Blair has not engaged intellectually
with the question of Scotland's future was dispelled by the clarity with which
he addressed the issue. Those around him say he has gone out of his way to
inform himself, and to open the debate within the party to take in not just his
Scottish colleagues but those south of the Border as well.
Although he has shown courage in allowing Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson to define the policy unhindered, it is clear he is now a driving
force behind it.
But he was also sufficiently aware of the dangers posed to any English
politician entering the closed, labyrinthine world of Scottish politics to
tread carefully. ``One of the things that is always curious when you discuss
this, is that the slightest word or nuance is taken as meaning far more than it
ever should. The Labour Party commitment is clear, that we will legislate in
the first year of a Labour government.''
The new slogan was unveiled at the end. We had been joined in his office
beneath Big Ben by Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair's redoubtable press secretary,
who slipped a note to his leader. A smile crossed his face and moments later
came: ``I believe it is, if you like, New Labour, New Union.'' We chuckled at
first, but the potency was obvious.
``There is a New Union that can help bind the United Kingdom together against
the forces of destruction, those for separatism, which would be a disaster for
Scotland, and do nothing, no change, which would increasingly play into the
hand of those that want separation. A New Union is what Scotland and what
Britain needs for a new century.''
Turning the screw on 'lie machine'.
MR Blair returned repeatedly to what he described as the Tory lie machine and
the work of its chief propagandist, Michael Forsyth. But he admitted the
``tartan tax'' label had had an effect, and promised Labour would ``come out of
its corner fighting'' on the issue.
The ``tartan tax'', the Scottish Secretary's claim that a vote for devolution
means a vote for a 3p increase in income tax, was a myth designed to terrorise
the voters.
``It is rubbish, absolute utter rubbish,'' he said. ``The Tory lie that should
be nailed is this idea that the Scottish parliament means that your taxes go
up. It means nothing of the sort. Taxes only go up if people vote for it, and
that's up to Scots. That's the essence of devolution.''
The Labour leader rejected any suggestion that Labour was vulnerable on the
issue. By declaring that Labour would not include a tax increase in its first
manifesto for a Scottish parliament, he moved to cut off Mr Forsyth's most
potent campaign weapon.
``The fact is there has been a huge campaign of disinformation that requires to
be corrected, and it's part of our job. The longer this debate goes on the
better for us,'' he said, adding: ``I would concede that the moment this type
of lie is stated there is a need to counter it very strongly.''
The Tories have visibly moved up a gear since the leadership election and the
summer reshuffle.
The double act of Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and party chairman
Brian Mawhinney has imposed a tougher, more brutal approach to the day-to-day
of Westminister politics.
With Labour on 57% in Scotland, both parties know that the only way for the
party to go is down. A long, nasty General Election campaign has begun.
``This Government is desperate. They have shut down the business of government.
What you have in its place is a Conservative party propaganda machine. All the
forces of government are used to that end,'' Mr Blair said.
Revelations that Central Office had used Home Office files to discredit asylum
seekers, and that the Government was imposing an inquiry into an opt-out debate
in his Sedgefield constituency, were proof of how government has been abandoned
in favour of politics.
The same was true in Scotland. ``The way that Mr Forsyth operates in Scotland,
he's not a Government Minister, he's a propagandist for the Conservative Party
and that propaganda is designed primarily to get up and running the same
machine that was in existence before the last election. I call it the Tory lie
machine.''
In 1992 the Tories took on devolution and Labour was ill-equipped to counter
the attack. This the party has seen it coming and is prepared.
On the ``tartan tax'', as on the wider question of devolution, Mr Blair is
obviously confident: ``I think it's a very good idea, when you have a good
argument, to show a bit of backbone and get it across.
``I think we should come out of our corner fighting.''
Labour's campaign organisation is more efficient than it was in 1992, and
capable of taking the fight to the Tories. But for the Tories too high a
reliance on ``the lie'' could have disastrous consequences, Mr Blair suggested.
``They are taking a very big risk with what they're doing, because, if they
lose the next election and there is a Labour government, the gap between the
lies they told and the reality is going to be used against them for a very long
period.''
Serving the community
MR Blair is dismissive of the suggestion that he could alienate business
leaders if Labour carries through its promise to start dismantling large areas
of the quango state, where many of these same people serve.
The Labour leader insists they can still be involved, through advisory bodies
and committees.
He said: ``They can be involved directly making representations. And they can,
if they wish, offer themselves for election.'' He also reserves the right to
retain certain appointed bodies, on which business people could serve.
Advocate of change courts business
MR Blair's confidence that he can persuade the business community to give
Labour a fair hearing is undented by talk of firms quitting a devolved Scotland
in droves or the reported power struggle within CBI Scotland over its recent
agnostic line on constitutional change.
On the CBI manoeuvres, he says ``I hope they're not just playing politics with
us. We know the Conservative Party will be very active and it will have certain
supporters in business. What I find with the Conservative Party nowadays is
that it tends to behave a bit like an opposition.''
On Wednesday evening the Labour leader spoke to an overflow meeting of the
CBI's London region. There, he says, he found ``massive support'' for the
creation of one strategic authority to govern London. ``They have seen the
consequences of a whole lot of small unitary authorities being unable to deal
with big strategic problems.''
And he believes that is part of a wider process. ``I'm bound to say that the
CBI at UK level have actually made movement towards greater regional government
in England, precisely because they recognise the strength of the arguments for
bodies with whom business can properly do business.''
Demonstrating relaxed assurance, Mr Blair went on to set out his own approach
to persuading business Labour means what it says. ``I want to move beyond the
stage where I'm simply reassuring business that it isn't going to be damaged by
Labour. That reassurance is important because of the past, because of the
historical feelings of business and because, to be blunt about it, the Labour
Party went through a stage in the late seventies and early eighties when some
of its attitudes and some of its people were anti-business. It was wrong and
foolish. And we were right to change it.''
According to Mr Blair, what business and government now need to agree are the
``key public interest objectives'' they can achieve by working together. He
lists education and skills, infrastructure, harnessing new technology,
developing the regions and the inner cities, and playing a leading role in
Europe.
``These are all areas where Labour has a lot to offer business. I would say a
great deal more to offer than a Conservative Party that has this ideological
split between those who believe there is a role for government and those who
believe there isn't.''
The Labour leader is keen to emphasise those areas of public/private
collaboration which successfully generate major projects. ``The place I'll be
speaking in in Edinburgh (the new International Conference Centre) is a perfect
example. These things are now part and parcel of everyday life.''
As the party's City spokesman Alistair Darling found recently at an investment
bankers' dinner in Edinburgh, Labour's intention to sign up for the social
chapter of the Maastricht Treaty and its commitment to a national minimum wage
generates even more heat among some sections of the business community than a
tax-raising Scottish parliament.
In his own meetings with business people, Mr Blair has felt some of that same
heat. But, again, given a year or more before the next election, he is
confident a rational case for both can be sold, even to the business community.
``The Tories say the minimum wage is going to lose millions of jobs. That
signing up for the social chapter means no one will ever come to Britain again.
Let's deal in facts,'' says the Labour leader. ``Japan, the United States, and
every other country in Europe has a minimum wage. The issue is what level it's
to be set at.''
So what will that final rate be? The #4.15 an hour some unions are advocating?
Or a lower figure? Can he even offer the formula which will be used? The Labour
Party, he points out, deliberately changed its minimum wage policy to ensure
the rate would only be set after consultation with business and industry.
``We want to make sure it is introduced in such a way that it does not have an
adverse effect,'' he adds.
``My answer to those who say: Why won't you tell us the level it'll be set at,
is this: the very thing we're offering you is what you should be asking for.
Namely the chance to have an influence in the process of setting it.''
Business, he believes, is ignoring the positive benefits minimum wage
legislation could bring. It would, he argues, help legitimate businesses fight
against unfair competition from firms paying extremely low levels of pay. It
would also help the Exchequer, and could reduce the tax burden on everyone.
``We are currently spending in this country upwards of #2500m subsidising low
pay through the benefits system.
`` As part of a new benefit, welfare package a minimum wage is a very sensible
element and it's being used as such by other countries.
On the social chapter, the Labour leader is again at pains to dispel what he
believes are Tory myths. ``The Tory lie machine says the social chapter is a
huge raft of detailed social legislation which comes in holus bolus if you sign
up. It is not. It is a set of principles.''
He points to one of the first pieces of legislation initiated under the chapter
provisions - the parental leave directive. ``In my view, the idea that this is
some appalling thing that no business can ever contemplate is wrong. Most
sensible businesses are trying to do something like this already.''
There is, he argues, no inconsistency between having decent minimum standards
at the workplace and an efficient economy.
Pledge on the cost of an Assembly
``TAXES only go up if the people vote for them,'' the leader of the opposition
insisted yesterday, on the eve of his meeting business tour of Scotland.
``There will be no tax raised at all unless the party goes into an election
promising it and succeeds. We have no plans to do that, never mind anyone
else.''
Tony Blair and his senior colleagues are well aware of the political damage
being inflicted on the Labour case for devolution by Michael Forsyth's tartan
tax campaign of recent months.
There have been clear rumblings of discontent among some in the Scottish
business community about the disincentive effects of having higher rates of
personal taxation in Scotland. Having set out his stall, promoting Labour as
the real pro-business party, Blair needs to counter that tartan tax assault.
On the eve of the latest Blair visit to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Stirling, there
were reports of a revolt within the Scottish CBI to get the organisation to
adopt a more overtly anti-home rule - and, by implication, anti-Labour -
stance. Just as in the 1992 election, Labour tax plans are threatening to
rebound on the party.
Mr Blair's solution, repeated several times in an exclusive extended interview
with The Herald, is to subject the Scottish parliament's discretionary power to
raise or lower basic rate income tax by up to 3p in the pound to a democratic
mandate at each Assembly election.
He is not, he insists, issuing some new constitutional prescription for a home
rule parliament in Edinburgh. ``I'm simply saying that the idea that, if you
have a Scottish parliament, the taxes go up 3p . . .is rubbish, it's absolute
and utter rubbish.
``We would accept as a political obligation that, if we intended to raise tax,
we would say so when we fought the election.''
Mr Blair is sticking to an old Labour theme that devolution is about making
government in Scotland and its attendant bureaucracy more accountable to the
democratic process. Why, he asks, is it wrong to give an Edinburgh Assembly
some tax discretion, when local councils raise some of their revenue through
council tax? He argues that, once established, an Assembly would be good for
Scottish business.
But he will also use his Scottish tour to drive home this new message that
Labour is responsible on tax and will only use the Edinburgh Assembly's tax
powers with the electorate's prior consent. That pledge, given the reluctance
of the electorate to vote for higher taxes, could mean putting the Assembly's
discretionary taxation power on a very back burner over a very low heat.
On the cost of the proposed Assembly - another major issue for some Scottish
businesses who see that cost being passed on to them - Mr Blair is emphatic
that the Assembly will have no power to raise corporate taxes.
``As for the cost, the budget for a Scottish parliament will come out of the
existing Scottish budget. The bureaucracy is there. We have 15,000 civil
servants in Scotland, covering nine different government departments. I think
any rational debate about this leads inevitably to the conclusion that there
should be substantial change. The only question then is whether we have the
best proposals and I think we have,'' he says.
``I understand the concerns businesses will have because businesses on the
whole in my experience of them don't much like change. All I ask them to do is
look at the facts, not the myths peddled by the Conservatives. I believe they
have a lot to gain from Scottish devolution in terms of more accountable
government and one strategic body where a lot of their economic concerns can be
dealt with.''

IT was one of the most horrific cases of cruelty animal inspectors had ever
come across. Shot five times with an air rifle and used as a football by the
two youths who had picked it up, the hedgehog was eventually thrown on to a
bonfire to die. It was discovered severely burned and injured but still alive
the following day, when it was put down by a vet.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals tried to prosecute
but was forced to withdraw the charges, because, under British law at the
moment, it is not an offence to commit acts of appalling cruelty against many
wild mammals.
Now there are fresh hopes that legislation could be in place next year to
outlaw such practices after Labour announced it plans to reintroduce the Wild
Mammals (Protection) Bill.
The Bill, originally championed by Dumbarton MP John McFall, was earlier
dropped on a technicality after a constant stream of amendments, complaints,
and delays. Animal campaigners say it was effectively sabotaged.
In its original form, the Bill was designed to outlaw all hunting with hounds
or the snaring of wild mammals. Following pressure from the bloodsports lobby,
it was eventually watered down to making it a criminal offence to
``intentionally and cruelly kick, beat, nail or otherwise impale, burn, crush
or drown any wild animal.'' It was approved by the Commons by 253 votes to nil
last March and a variety of amendments were applied when it went through the
House of Lords. Earlier this month, however, Ministers refused to give it the
couple of seconds it needed and it ran out of time.
Yesterday Alan Meale, Labour MP for Mansfield, announced that he was to
re-introduce the Bill after winning parliamentary time at No.2 on the private
members ballot.
However, field sports officials say Mr Meale wants to push ahead with the Bill
as it stood before the Lords' amendments and they are implacably opposed to it
in that form.
British Field Sports Society spokeswoman Janet George said the wording of the
Bill left the way open for prosecution of farmers and sportsmen going about
their regular business. For example, a gardener using a mole trap might be
prosecuted or a farmer burning stubble and animals caught in the stubble could
be prosecuted.
``We were happy with the way that it came back to the Commons with all the
amendments agreed from all sides in the House of Lords,'' said Ms George. ``The
fact that Mr Meale has refused to use that amended version indicates something
more than a desire to bring in an animal welfare measure.''
Mr McFall said yesterday he was delighted that the Bill would be pushed forward
again but had been disgusted at its failure last time round.
``The frustrations were immense, because we managed to get it through the
Commons, the Lords, and back to the Commons and it needed two seconds of
parliamentary time but the leader of the House Tony Newton didn't allow it. I
had an opportunity to put it forward next year as what is called a back to the
chair Bill, however, I felt that it could still be hijacked by opponents,
therefore, when Alan Meale came up as No.2 in the private members ballot, it
was a golden opportunity.''
Mr McFall said he thinks the Bill had been tripped up initially ``because I
think that some people in the hunting fraternity are implicitly opposed to
providing any protection for wild mammals, just in case it gets to them.
Frankly that's a situation that is inexplicable to almost everyone.
``If we find people voting against this, I think not only their political but
their personal reputation will be at stake, because my Bill did clear the House
of Commons unanimously and this is it coming back in the same form.''
At the headquarters of the RSPCA, spokeswoman Sue Atkinson said they were
delighted that the Bill was being given a second chance.
``This time I think it stands a really good chance, we are very optimistic that
it will get enough time to go through. It really is a disgraceful situation at
the moment. If you had a pet fox and you kicked it, you could be prosecuted,
but you could kick a wild fox to death if you wanted to and it's still
completely legal.
``If we get calls our staff are often forced to say to someone who has a gang
kicking a rabbit to death outside their door, there's nothing we can do.''
Apart from the hedgehog mentioned earlier, the RSPCA were also powerless to act
in the case of a Muntjac deer which was attacked by four dogs which had been
set on it by a man and a boy. A woman passerby took the seriously injured
animal to a vet where it was put down, but, although she provided a clear
description of the man and his car registration number, no action could be
taken.
In a separate incident, six youths in Merseyside battered a wild rabbit to
death in front of witnesses, who testified that they had seen the thugs
throwing a coat over the screaming animal and kicking and beating it with
sticks. Veterinary reports showed the rabbit died after its skull was totally
crushed. The RSPCA did secure a conviction initially but it was quashed after
an appeal to the High Court.

WHEN Lord Wheatley produced his report following the disaster at Ibrox Stadium
in 1971, it was apparent that there was an urgent need to implement a wide
range of spectator safety measures at our football grounds. Authorities and
individual football clubs acknowledged the need for this work and appealed to
Government for help in meeting the financial implications.
The Football Grounds Improvement Trust was formed in 1975, following the launch
of the Spot-the-Ball competition, as an initiative by the pools companies, led
by Littlewoods, and the then Football League secretary, Alan Hardaker. With a
budget of less than #300,000 per annum in the first few years, the initial
grants were, of necessity, of modest amounts.
The first major grant to come to Scotland was to Dumbarton FC towards the cost
of building the facility which to this day is the main grandstand, housing the
spectating area, changing facilities, offices, and boardroom of the club.
One of the last public acts of Alan Hardaker was to open this stand, and a
plaque commemorating the event can be seen when entering the building. Hardaker
died suddenly shortly afterwards, and one of my first tasks as a newly
appointed trustee, in 1979, was to plead the Dumbarton case as no formal offer
of grant had been made. Eventually the merits of the argument succeeded, but it
was a fair old battle.
Scotland had not been represented on the Trust at its formation, but the shrewd
League President, Tom Lauchlan, and Greenock Morton boss, Hal Stewart, had the
foresight to see the potential, and campaigned for direct representation.
The Trust blossomed, income rose to more than #6million per annum, and the
percentage of grant support rose to 75%. Following the disasters at Bradford
and Hillsbrough, the Government appointed Lord Justice Taylor to head an
inquiry into safety and the standard of provisions for spectators.
The Taylor Report, as the final document became known, produced the most
far-reaching and stringent standards ever demanded for sports grounds, not only
in this country, but worldwide.
The implementation of Taylor necessitated major funding, and again Government
helped by providing a rebate in the pools' betting duty. In an agreement with
the pools companies, the Football Trust was charged with the responsibility of
structuring a grant-aid scheme to assist clubs to meet Taylor and encourage the
building of new stadia throughout the country.
Eight new grounds have been built: three in Scotland - Stirling Albion, Clyde
(at Cumbernauld) and Livingston - and five in England - Middlesbrough,
Millwall, Northampton, Chester, and the impressive Huddersfield Stadium which
has just won the RIBA award as the best new building of the year.
Several new grounds are planned, notably Falkirk, Clydebank, East Fife,
Hamilton, Airdrieonians and Inverness in Scotland, and Sunderland, Southampton,
Bolton, Reading, and Oxford in England.
Substantial support has been extended to Scotland's national stadium extending
to more than #10million to date. Some #23 million has been awarded in grants to
projects in Scotland, costing in excess of #82million. Almost all grounds in
the premier division have built new stands, grant aided by the Football Trust.
The introduction of closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance equipment at
grounds - pioneered and largely funded by the Trust - has proven the single,
most important measure in the campaign against football hooliganism in Scotland.
The Trust has now provided support for the upgrading of systems and the total
grant aid made available for CCTV at Scottish clubs now runs at more than
#1million. Support has also been extended to the development of women's
football in Scotland.
The future is clouded due to the serious impact on the funds transferring to
the Trust from the pools companies.
The introduction of the National Lottery, and its domination of the long-odds
betting market, has had a serious effect of the Trust's income. The pools are
the game's largest source of external funding (around #45million a year) and
football has been the country's largest lottery loser by far.
Almost all the Trust's resources depend on the prosperity of the pools
companies and on the generosity of the Government. The 35% decline in our
income has forced a reassessment of grant aid policy. Future efforts must be
concentrated on the core activities of Taylor-related work and in helping areas
ineligible for lottery funding.
Football needs the pools to be able to compete successfully against the
lottery, and trustees are supporting all steps to ensure that fair competition
is secured.
It is essential that income is sufficient to implement Taylor throughout the
leagues and that the Trust can continue to make its vital contribution to
Scottish football at every level.

BLUE Circle is yet another major company rueing the heady days of the 1980s
when diversification from mundane core activities was all the rage.
In this case, the cement giant bought both Armitage Shanks and Birmid Qualcast
and then went on an ill-fated European tour three years ago - the Celius
heating business in France, bought for #206m was not its most sage acquisition.
In September, chief executive Keith Orrell-Jones said that there would be a
fundamental review of the activity, named ``creation of cost effective centres
of excellence'' although the hit will be a #55m charge against this year's
profits.
The plan is to produce in the lowest cost territory for the particular product,
which means Potterton boilers will remain in the UK while oil fired boilers
will be concentrated in France.
Certainly something had to be done. In the first half, the division made losses
of #1m on turnover of #290m and capital employed totalling some #600m.
The bathrooms side has been a somewhat happier story although that is carrying
an #8m exceptional charge for its reorganisation. It is good, high margin stuff
which will benefit even more from the #40m to be spent over the next three
years.
Finance director James Loudon dismissed a suggestion that all this was simply
the sprucing up of the two activities prior to a flotation. He said that the
costs savings next year would be #25m, a sizable improvement on the current
year's likely group pre-tax outturn expected to be around #270m. The write-down
of #63m in all will be substantially met by a #55m profit on a landfill sale.
BCI has partially met City demands for the heating division, but it should
think again on a sale as its performance in cement has been faultless and why
dilute that.

Nowhere man: Swansea's Flowers is caught by two Castres defenders during the
European Cup quarter-final tie which turned ugly.
THE top 10 clubs in Scotland are to stage a summit meeting in an effort to
thrash out a consensus on whether clubs or districts will represent Scotland in
next year's European Cup competition.
The initiative for the meeting - to take place at Meggetland on Wednesday - has
come from defending champions Stirling County who have made no secret of the
fact that they back clubs in the European tournament which is currently
underway but which awaits the appearance of representatives from Scotland and
England next season.
The tournament, which will climax in a final at Cardiff Arms Park on January 7,
has been backed by ITV and sponsors Heineken to the tune of #20m for the first
three years.
The 12 teams taking part this season are each expected to bank at least
#100,000 on top of their gate receipts.
It is against that backdrop, with ambitious sides viewing the Euro cash as a
means of bankrolling their future in the professional game, that some clubs are
contesting the Scottish Rugby Union stance that district sides should represent
Scotland.
Coincidentally, this week Stirling County have been awarded #236,000 from the
national lottery to part finance a major ground development at Bridgehaugh. The
cash will be used to construct a sports hall, gymnasium, and upgrade
floodlighting. The project forms part of a wider #900,000 scheme that includes
refurbishment and extension to stand facilities.
The drive for club representation, although currently spearheaded by Stirling
County, is also backed by Watsonians and Melrose whose director of rugby Keith
Robertson delivered a pro-clubs presentation to a meeting of the South District
earlier this week. Others are still undecided but some are vehemently opposed.
SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer is a staunch advocate of the district route,
for the reason that he considers that only district combines would be strong
enough to compete. The fear, too, is that if three, or perhaps four, Scottish
clubs flew the saltire in Europe then they would act as a magnet for the
country's top players, creating an imbalance in the domestic game.
Stirling County president Bill Gibson has invited fellow presidents from
Melrose, Watsonians, Boroughmuir, Hawick, Heriot's FP, Edinburgh Academicals,
and Gala, plus promoted Jed-Forest and Currie, to the meeting which represents
a powerful caucus but it is by no means certain that the pro-clubs lobby will
prove victorious.
In any event the final decision rests not with them but with the SRU general
committee which will reach a decision once final fixture dates for next
season's are known.
Yesterday, Gibson said: ``The European situation has to be sorted out, and
soon. What we don't want is for the SRU to spring a decision on us without
notice.
``The game is changing dramatically and we have, for instance, sponsors to
consider and we have to know the way ahead quickly. I can see the reasons for
the SRU wanting districts in Europe but it is quite obvious to everybody that
the district championship isn't working just now.
``If the SRU has something to put in its place then they should be telling us
about it now. We want it to be clubs in Europe and others agree with us.
Hopefully, we can make a case for it with the other top clubs in Scotland but,
above all, we have to get clear guidance on what is happening on Europe and,
just as important, with what the league set-up next season is going to be.
``With sponsors to think of we can't wait for a decision until the SRU agm and
it is encumbent on the SRU to consult the clubs that will be most affected -
and that must be the top 10 clubs in the country - before they reach any
decision,'' he said.

FRENCH side Castres are facing a ban from the European Cup tournament after
their quarter-final with Swansea on Tuesday night when Scottish referee Chuck
Muir and touch-judges Andrew Clift and Rob Dickson were forced to call for
police protection, writes Derek Douglas.
The SRU is now awaiting a report from Muir and yesterday Scottish International
Board representative Alan Hosie said that the affair would be raised as a
matter of urgency with the tournament organisers.
Hosie, a former international referee, added that the scenes which disfigured
the Swansea game - won 22-10 by the Welshmen - appeared to be a sad vindication
of the fears he had voiced when the game turned professional three months ago.
``I'm on record as saying that the mix of money and the physical contact
aspects of rugby were a recipe for trouble. It frightened me then and it
frightens me now. I hope it turns out that my voice in the wilderness was a
stupid one but, one assumes, that the Castres players were being paid win
bonuses on Tuesday night. There was a lot at stake financially and initial
reports seem to indicate that mayhem ruled,'' he said.
Yesterday, Muir was maintaining a discrete silence other than to confirm that
he would be submitting a report to the SRU. However, eye witnesses spoke of
appalling scenes as players fought with each other and a Frenchman was sent off.
Later, Muir and his Scottish touch-judges were escorted off the pitch by police
and the constabularly was on hand, too, outside the officials' dressing-room
and at the after-match reception.
The European tournament, which is run under the banner of the Five Nations'
committee, but operated for tax purposes from Dublin under the stewardship of
IRFU administrators Tom Kiernan and Ken Reid, is in its first season and due to
be expanded next year with teams from Scotland and England taking part.

DUNCAN Ferguson repaid the faith shown in him by both his club and his adoring
fans with two second-half goals in Everton Reserves' 5-0 victory over Newcastle
Reserves last night.
The 23-year-old striker showed no ill-effects following his absence from
football including a 44-day spell at Barlinnie Prison and proved he has worked
hard to maintain and rebuild his fitness.
Despite the sub-zero temperature, 10,432 spectators were at Goodison Park for
his return to action, in a blue shirt. He was given a rapturous welcome by the
fans, accompanied by a rapidly assembled band of pipes and drums, for the
Pontins' League fixture.
Ferguson looked sharp in his first outing since August. After Vinnie Samways
scored twice and Mark Grugel added a third, it was Ferguson's first goal three
minutes after the interval that warmed the home crowd. Showing neat control
after collecting a cross from the right, Ferguson fired low into the corner of
the net from the edge of the area and calmly received the applause of his team
mates.
Ferguson, proving his stamina has been unaffected, scored his second seven
minutes from time. Manager Joe Royle must be tempted to pitch him into Monday's
live Sky fixture against West Ham United.

<HEADLINE>Juppe misses Franco-German summit to deal with escalating crisis at home Mediator called in to break strikes</HEADLINE>

Paris, Thursday
FRENCH Prime Minister Alain Juppe moved to break the deadlock in a crippling
14-day rail strike by naming a mediator today as hundreds of thousands of
public service strikers marched to demand an end to welfare reforms.
The strike has swelled into the worst labour crisis in a decade involving
electricity, gas, post, and telephone workers, and spread today to most of the
nation's one million teachers and some Air France and Air Inter state airline
staff.
Juppe cancelled plans to attend a Franco-German summit and chaired emergency
ministerial talks before appointing veteran economist Jean Matteoli, head of
the consultative Economic and Social Council, to mediate in the SNCF state
railway dispute.
``The government is putting in place everywhere the means for a real
consultation with all trade unions and professional organisations. The Prime
Minister has asked ministers to report to him on progress in this work at the
end of this week,'' government spokesman Alain Lamassoure told reporters.
However he again refused to use the term ``negotiations'', saying Labour
Minister Jacques Barrot would hold ``far-reaching discussions'' with trade
union leaders from Saturday.
Nor did he respond to an appeal by a key strike leader, Marc Blondel of Force
Ouvriere, for personal talks with Juppe instead of ``phoney consultations''
with junior ministers.
Rail unions said they would meet Matteoli but reaffirmed their demands that the
state contract, a government plan to streamline the heavily indebted railways,
must be dropped before they will return to work.
Juppe's office earlier denied rumours on German financial markets that the
premier had resigned in the crisis over austerity plans to prepare France for
European monetary union.
Civil Service Minister Dominique Perben said: ``The actual principle of reform
is absolutely non-negotiable.''
His ministry provided statistical proof that the strike was gaining ground. It
said 36.7% of the 2.2 million civil servants were on strike, compared to only
10% on Tuesday.
Snow and plunging temperatures in the Paris region added to the misery of
hundreds of thousands who walked to work or joined traffic jams that clogged a
total 210 miles of approach roads to the capital.
The transport mayhem intensified when stoppages by firefighters and Air France
and Air Inter cabin staff restricted flights at the two Paris airports, while
stoppages by some air traffic controllers added to the disruption.
Incoming flights were delayed by up to 90 minutes and departures by two to
three hours.
In Calais, striking railmen stopped Channel Tunnel trains to London and
Brussels for three hours by occupying a signal box.
Huge crowds joined protest marches in provincial cities, with some
demonstrators hanging or burning effigies of Juppe. Police said 40,000 turned
out in Toulouse, 35,000 in Bordeaux and Rouen, 30,000 in Marseilles and
Grenoble, 20,000 in Nice, 15,000 in Le Mans, Nantes, and Lyons.
In Paris, a crowd estimated by police at 16,000 and up to 60,000 by the
organisers marched through the Latin Quarter - a symbolic rallying point since
the May 1968 student-worker revolt - past the National Assembly, where MPs were
debating a law allowing Juppe to impose key welfare reforms by decree.
The Bank of France, some of whose staff joined the strike, gave the government
a small boost by shaving its key interest rate by 0.10% to 4.7%.
The unions, however, resisted efforts by Juppe to drive a wedge between rival
labour leaders and separate the health overhaul from the rail reform and the
issue of public service pensions.-Reuter.

Nairobi, Thursday
THREE Kenyan High Court Assessors have returned a unanimous guilty verdict
against three men charged with the rape and murder of Briton Caron Winter.
Under Kenyan law, while the Assessors verdict is regarded as crucial, the trial
judge is not bound to agree with their decision.
Yusuf Rashid Wamasoro, alias ``Toto'', James Washikomba, and Alexander
Eshikavale had earlier denied raping and murdering the 31-year-old housewife
after forcing their way into the Winters' home in June last year.
If convicted of charge all three face a mandatory death sentence.
The prosecution alleged the men took turns raping Caron Winter before hacking
her to death. Her 11-month-old baby survived unharmed.
Husband Adam Winter was beaten unconscious by the attackers after surprising
them when he returned home for lunch.
Judge Samuel Bosire ordered the accused to remain in Kamiti maximum security
jail until he delivers a final verdict on December 13.

FOREIGN &amp; Colonial, the world's first investment trust, will finally ascend to
the FTSE 100 index later this month.
It will be the only conventional investment trust represented in the top
flight, which is already home to venture capital group 3i.
London-based Foreign &amp; Colonial's move into the Footsie is part of one of the
largest shake-ups of the Footsie since the index was established in 1984.
The first of the changes, decided by the FTSE Actuaries UK Indices Committee,
will occur on Monday.
Troubled international trading group Inchcape, which has slipped to 131st in
the UK market capitalisation league, will be replaced by the newly-floated
National Grid.
The power transmission group will be about the 50th-largest Footsie constituent.
A week later, printing, paper and packaging group Arjo Wiggins Appleton,
currency printer De La Rue, speciality retailer Sears, London Electricity, and
Midlands Electricity will be relegated to the FTSE Mid-250 index.
They will be replaced by Foreign &amp; Colonial, glass company Pilkington, the
revitalised Burton retailing group, catalogue stores group Argos, and
specialist engineering company Smiths Industries.
The changes find two former spin-offs from BAT Industries going in opposite
directions. Argos is on the way up, while Anglo-French company Arjo Wiggins
Appleton, which has plants in Aberdeen and Fort William, falls into the Mid-250.
Investment trusts are not a common sight in the top 100, with previous member
Globe Investment Trust having been taken over by the Coal Board pension fund.
Founded in 1868, Foreign &amp; Colonial is now an #1800m fund. It is somewhat
unusual in that it is more than 50%-owned by private shareholders.
Michael Hart, who has served the ``international general'' investment trust for
41 years and been its manager since 1969, has seen Foreign &amp; Colonial's efforts
to reach the Footsie delayed by the raft of privatisations in recent years.
He said yesterday: ``Obviously we are very pleased. It is something we had been
hoping would happen eventually.
The move into the Footsie should have a positive impact on Foreign &amp; Colonial's
share price because the stock will find its way into the portfolios of index
tracking funds.
Mr Hart said: ``The fact that we are now in the Footsie means that a lot more
people are going to have to take note of us. The index trackers are obviously
going to be interested and that certainly has implications for the share
price.''
He added that Foreign &amp; Colonial's objective back in 1868, to give the small
investor the same advantages as the large capitalist, remained the same 127
years later.
Inchcape's move into the Mid-250 will displace Renfrew-based engineering group
Howden, now a lowly 413th in the market capitalisation league.
Other changes at the bottom end of the Mid-250 will see the departure of
Glasgow-registered clothing group William Baird.
Shares in those companies exiting the Footsie were generally weaker, while the
prospective entrants hardened. Argos added 10p to 571p, with Inchcape off 6p on
211p.
q Expro, the offshore services group, has won over #5m of new contracts to
gather data from offshore wells in the North Sea.
The Reading-based company signed a three-year contract with Elf Enterprise
Caledonia and a two-year contract with Kerr McGee Oil to test offshore wells
and gather data from instruments lowered into them.
Expro's main operational base in the UK is in Aberdeen.

FROM the road Quarrier's Village, once the Orphan Homes of Scotland, looks
unscathed by the years. The spire of Mount Zion church, the children's
cathedral, dominates the dip in the land west of Bridge of Weir. The stone
villas that once housed more than 30,000 destitute orphans from across Scotland
stand in pristine condition. The very air seems to have a tranquil, timeless
quality.
But walk through the village built in 1871 by William Quarrier, child beggar
from Greenock turned successful businessman and social pioneer, and the private
cars parked outside the former children's cottages are testimony to a dramatic
revision in this famous West of Scotland charity's ethos and approach.
Many of the homes that sheltered children under the care of a house mother and
father have been sold to private buyers along with some of the surrounding
land. Apart from a nationally renowned Epilepsy Centre, which provides
accommodation for up to 100 people, there are only two residential homes and a
respite centre for people with learning disabilities left in this
picture-postcard haven, 12 miles away from the problems of Glasgow.
But a century and a quarter later William Quarrier's vision of social justice
has not been dissipated with the orphans whose numbers dwindled in the 1970s
and 80s from a peak in the 1930s, but been reshaped and refocused.
Over the past three years Quarrier's has been in the process of a quiet
revolution. Tomorrow it launches what it hopes will be a high-profile,
year-long, fundraising campaign including numerous sponsored events, a Pro-am
golf match and the creation of a William Quarrier rose to mark its 125th
anniversary in 1996. At a dignitary-studded lunch in the centre of Glasgow its
chairman, Sir Graham Hills, will appeal for #250,000 to plough into new
homeless projects in Glasgow and signal the start of a renewed effort to raise
public awareness of the charity and redefine its image.
Strolling along the broad avenues which curve through the village the charity's
director, Gerald Lee, acknowledges that the process of change is a painful one
for an institution with an obvious pride in its past. Unlike organisations like
Barnardo's he says the charity was slow to embrace the changes in childcare in
the 1970s which saw the creation of small, specialist homes and community based
care for those disadvantaged groups falling through the statutory social work
net. In the 1980s Quarrier's found itself with its head buried in the sand.
Lee joined Quarrier's three years ago with a social services background and a
zeal to provide the best professional care possible. As he talked about the
charity's projects, which range from a support service to people with
disabilities in Glasgow's Drumchapel housing scheme to a residential school for
children with serious behavioural problems, he said the reality is that
charities must operate like businesses, competing both for public, private, and
now lottery funding as well as local authority sanction to run services.
With residents in the charity's projects described as ``discerning services
users'', there has been considerable effort made to introduce staff development
programmes and improve the level of expertise. Lee says with the advent of care
in the community Quarrier's faces the dual challenge of working with the
statutory authorities to plug the gaps as well as fighting to set its own
agenda.
It is a challenge that Lee says is now being met. While other agencies have
found that the ``community'' is not all it is cracked up to be - one recent
study describing the not-in-my-backyard culture as one characterised by
hostility and in some cases violence - Lee says Quarrier's community based
projects have escaped such resentment. He points to the award-winning Larkfield
Family Centre in Greenock which offers family and child-care support and the
rural youth project in Argyll, both of which have attracted only praise.
However, the main thrust of Quarrier's work this year has been in the
homelessness field taking the organisation full circle and back tackling the
problems on the streets of Glasgow. Last Friday the organisation opened a
long-stay housing project in the South Side of Glasgow to accommodate 39 young
people aged between 18 and 25 for up to two years. Based in a converted church
leased from the city council, the James Shield project allows residents to live
independently but offers 24-hour advice and support if needed.
In February Quarrier's also took over the running of Glasgow City Council's
Stopover project after urban aid funding ran out. The project has an open-door
policy providing emergency accommodation for those deemed too problematic by
other hostels in the city. Lee is keen to hold it up as an example of
Quarrier's future direction.
It is hard to find fault. Yesterday the Pollokshaws Road hostel witnessed its
usual comings and goings. A guy with a rucksack left with his mate and a
confident ``see ya''. A girl arrived at the door with a small shiny green
rucksack and a couple of carrier bags in her arms saying she has an
appointment. If she's lucky she might get a place. The hostel could be filled
three times over with 73% of referrals having to be turned down on grounds of
space.
Answering questions in a polite, quiet voice, David Steele, 23, describes the
series of traumatic circumstances which led him to an 11-week stay at the
hostel. In May he left his home in Kilmarnock after his father died. Initially
he went to live with his older sister but she has now gone to Manchester
leaving David to drift to Glasgow. He tells of a night in a city centre hostel
which left him feeling frightened ``because of the drugs''.
He misses his father and would like, one day, his own house, but he is full of
praise for his ``keyworker'' who sorted out a more permanent home. Glad to feel
safe and having made some friends he has just moved 100 yards down the road to
his own self-catering room in the James Shield project.
He is a Quarrier's success. Others leave Stopover to a more uncertain future
but the project's leader, Ian Hughes, is clear that the charity's approach is
one of the better solutions to the city's homeless problem, offering safety to
some of the most vulnerable young people.

CHIEF Minister goes in the pursuit of big money at Cheltenham tomorrow when he
takes on some of the finest hurdlers in the country in the #35,000 Bonusphoto
Bula Hurdle.
His participation was confirmed yesterday by Invergowrie trainer Tom Dyer after
it was learned that the favourite, Large Action, runner-up in the Champion
Hurdle and last year's winner of the Bula, had suffered a serious leg injury
and will not run again this season.
``We were intending to run the Chief anyway because he is in great form at
present, but the unfortunate injury to Oliver Sherwood's star, makes it even
more necessary that we should get involved,'' he explained.
Chief Minister has already earned #11,000 this season by taking on top company.
He was third to Lonesome Train, giving loads of weight, in a valuable handicap
at Cheltenham in mid-November and two weeks later finished a half-length second
to Padre Mio in the Grade Two #30,000 Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle, when
15-8 favourite.
Tomorrow, he races against Atours, Mysilv, and Mole Board, who all ran in the
Champion Hurdle, and Morley Street, the 1991 champion, who is making a comeback
from ``retirement''.
``He is in such good fettle just now we must try him against those guys.
"We realise that Mysilv and Atours will be difficult to beat but we are
definitely not going to Cheltenham to be last,'' said the Invergowrie trainer.
``My horse is improving and he will give them all a race.''
Front-running Mysilv is guaranteed to set a strong pace and if Chief Minister
comes with his normal late burst it could be between the Scottish horse and the
fast-finishing Atours.
Jockey Peter Hobbs will be partnering Chief Minister for the last time as he
retires in January. Dyer has not yet decided on a replacement.
Owned by Berwick businessman Graham Shiel, the son of Rainbow Quest has won
more than #47,000 in hurdle races and gave Dyer his biggest successs in May
when successful in the Swinton Hurdle at Haydock, beating Eurolink The Lad by
three lengths.

<TEXT>
THE Scottish FA has unveiled a new approach in the hope that managers will be
involved less in after-match comments which lead them into trouble. And
although two premier division managers have been fined, they do not need to
take out the cheque books just yet. The fines have been suspended subject to
the managers not committing the same type of offence over the next 12 months.
Raith Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl has been fined #400 by the general purposes
committee because of his criticism of Celtic after a match between the clubs on
August 31. Motherwell's Alex McLeish has been fined #100 because he criticised
the referee after the meeting with Falkirk on September 23. In addition McLeish
was also censured because of his after-match comments about the referee who
took charge of the European tie against Mypa.
Kilmarnock`s Alex Totten was severely censured because of comments following
the match against Rangers on August 26, and Airdrie's Alex MacDonald was also
censured for his comments following a match against Dundee on October 28.
Players warned were:
Peter Grant (Celtic) for criticism of Raith Rovers (after game on August 31); a
second appearance meant a censure for criticism of the referee against Hearts
(September 23). Wayne Foster (Partick Thistle) for after match comments v
Hearts (September 16)
q THE SFA yesterday received an appeal from Dumbarton against the five-match
ban imposed on keeper Ian McFarlane who was given two red cards for the one
incident involving Airdrie striker Jim McIntyre. It means that McFarlane will
have to sit out eight matches.
Meanwhile, McFarlane is now free to play while the appeal is heard.

FOOD service and private healthcare group Compass turned in a robust
performance in the year to October, helped by better-than-expected trading in
its US operations.
Profits in the US business rose by 23%, benefiting from a combination of
factors including the elimination of loss-making contracts and improved cost
control.
UK catering profits rose by 13.5% to #32.5m and margins improved to 7.1%
despite a move into lower margin publiic sector catering.
The group's portfolio of UK foodservice brands, some owned and others
franchised, includes Burger King, Pizza Hut, Upper Crust and Cafe Select,
operating within UK railway stations. Its UK catering businesses include
Travellers Fare, primarily at UK railway stations and Letheby &amp; Christopher,
the social, sporting and corporate caterer.
Profits also rose in Europe, but margins were squeezed. This was because of a
large contract renewal in Norway at slightly reduced margins and the full-year
impact of two small acquisitions operating at lower margins.
Given the strong growth potential in its catering operations worldwide, it is
not surprising that Compass has decided to sell its healthcare business. This
consists of 15 acute care private hospitals and two nursing homes mostly in
southern England, making Compass the UK's fourth largest provider of acute care.
No figures were disclosed for the healthcare business' performance, but in 1994
it increased profits by 10% to #14.4m, with turnover up by a similar amount to
#66.7m. Negotiations are taking place on the sale of the business, which
increased its annual sales and profits and is expected to fetch around #180m.
The proceeds will be used to make bolt-on acquisitions, although Compass is
already the largest European-owned catering group and the third largest
foodservice group in the world.
Commenting on the full year performance Compass' chief executive Francis MacKay
said he had great confidence in being able to achieve continued growth. The
confident trading statement saw Compass shares add 4!sp to 450!sp.

KEVIN McKenzie, Stirling County's international hooker, returns to rugby
tomorrow.
The Scottish champions have recalled him for the regional league match against
Kilmarnock at Bridgehaugh, his first game since he damaged knee ligaments in
the premiership game against Melrose at the Greenyards nine weeks ago.
McKenzie, though, is among only a handful of first-choice players in the team.
County, like other senior clubs, have been denuded by district calls for the
start of the new phase in Scottish rugby, the regional leagues which will
decided the seeding positions in the cup competition.
It is, however, the opportunity for younger players to come through. Grant
Macfarlane, the former Scottish Schools cap who made his debut for Glasgow in
the under-21 district championship win over North and Midlands on Wednesday,
has been enlisted by West of Scotland to replace Guy Perrett against Ayr at
Millbrae, and a more recent schools international player, Andrew Dall is to
make his debut for Heriot's against Gordonians in Aberdeen.

ABERDEEN will hand their supporters an early Christmas present with free
entrance to Pittodrie when their abandoned game against Kilmarnock is replayed
next Wednesday night. A power cut forced the police to call off the fixture
after 57 minutes at Pittodrie on Wednesday night.
The sides were level at 1-1 so neither team suffers and Aberdeen have decided
there should be no financial penalty either. Chairman Ian Donald said:
``Despite the fact that Wednesday's power failure was totally out of the club's
control, we feel that the additional game offers the club the opportunity to
thank the fans for the tremendous support they have shown over past few
months.''
Kilmarnock's board of directors already have agreed to pay for their
supporters' bus fares for the long trek in midweek.
Meanwhile, Aberdeen defender Brian Irvine will complete a miraculous recovery
tomorrow when he starts his first game for Aberdeen since his multiple
sclerosis was diagnosed seven months ago.
The defender will return against Motherwell at Pittodrie to prove he has won a
fight against the odds. Irvine came off the bench on Wednesday night against
Kilmarnock to replace John Inglis, but the floodlight failure limited his
appearance to a matter of seconds.
Dutch keeper Theo Snelders is fit to return against Motherwell, but striker
Scott Booth is again out.
Manager Roy Aitken said yesterday: ``Brian has waited patiently for his chance
which looks as if it will come on Saturday. Inglis has damaged a hamstring, and
I'm sure Brian will relish the opportunity to complete his comeback.''

IBROX has been chosen to host this season's European Cup-winners' Cup final on
May 8, according to an unconfirmed report by the the Italian news agency ANSA.
The last European final to be staged in Scotland was Dundee United v
Gothenburg, a UEFA Cup two-legged final in 1987, and the last time Scotland was
used for a neutral-venue European final was the 1976 European Cup, when Bayern
Munich beat St Etienne of France at Hampden Park.
Ibrox is on an approved UEFA list of 16 possible venues for major finals. Work
is currently under way on seating the corners of the stand to take the capacity
to above 50,000. That work is scheduled to be completed by the end of the
season.
The Dutch city of Rotterdam is reported to be the back-up host venue for the
final.
ANSA also reported that UEFA had decided on Rome's Olympic Stadium as the
location for the European Cup final on May 22.
UEFA have not yet officially confirmed the venues. Both decisions would be
subject to ratification by UEFA's executive committee when it meets in
Birmingham next Friday.

McGhee went to ground after he angered Leicester by rejecting a huge increase
in salary and walked out along with No.2 Colin Lee and coach Mike Hickman. The
silence from Molineux was deafening and Wolves may delay an announcement until
after Sunday's trip to Luton.
``If he goes to Wolves I hope they get relegated,'' said Leicester captain
Steve Walsh. ``All the players are upset. They want to prove to Mark that what
he's done is wrong. We feel that what's happened is a disgrace.''
McGhee turned down a king's ransom, apparently for Wolves' gold. Leicester
chairman Martin George even questioned his own sanity after offering to
catapult McGhee into the ranks of England's top five best-paid managers.
The 38-year-old Scot is believed to have been offered an extra #1000 a week to
stay at Filbert Street.
George applied for a High Court injunction in an attempt to stop Brian Little
joining Aston Villa a year ago. Now another court battle looms.
q THE European Court of Justice will announce their final decision on the
Jean-Marc Bosman transfer system case in Brussels next Friday, according to a
court official.
The transfer market faces collapse if the court follows the recommendation in
September by one of their chief legal advisers, court advocate general Carl
Otto Lenz, that they should declare the system and its limits on foreign
players illegal.
Such a verdict could wipe fortunes off the value of big name clubs like
Manchester United and Liverpool, rendering their star assets worthless, while
ruining smaller ones.
Belgian Bosman argues professional footballers in European Union countries are
entitled to the same freedom of movement enjoyed by other workers. His case
started in 1990 when a transfer from Belgium's FC Liege to Dunkirk in France
was blocked by Liege.
Yesterday's results
Premier Reserve League - Hearts 5, Rangers 1.
BP Youth Cup - Partick Thistle 0, Aberdeen 2 (Derek Young, Darren Young).

WIMBLEDON champion Pete Sampras pulled out of the Grand Slam Cup in Munich last
night because of a knee injury - dashing German fans' hopes of a final showdown
between the American world No.1 and local hero Boris Becker.
Sampras, who was forced to withdraw from his quarter-final against Goran
Ivanisevic today because of a knee injury, will now need intensive treatment to
be fit for next month's Australian Open.
``Today, I woke up and I could not stretch the knee,'' said Sampras. ``I have
just had a test and there is fluid behind the knee.
``I'll go home to try to rest, recover, and do all I can to get fit. I didn't
want the year to end like this.''
Becker, who won the ATP Tour world championship last month, now has a superb
chance to pick up the most lucrative prize in the game.
Playing just 10 minutes' drive from his Munich home, the German had few
problems reaching the semi-finals, cruising past Zimbabwe's Byron Black.
Becker clinched the first-set tie-break 7-1 thanks to some superb serving, and
with an early break in the second set, raced to victory in 76 minutes by 7-6,
6-1.
He will now face America's Todd Martin, who reached the last four after Andrei
Medvedev retired hurt from their quarter-final with the score at 6-3, 3-6, 4-0,
in favour of the American.

MUNICH: A woman customer escaped unhurt from an armed man who was holding three
other people hostage in a Munich bank yesterday.
A police spokesman said the hostage taker had broken off negotiations. ``We are
now at a critical moment,'' he said.
The man had earlier released one captive who had heart trouble, but demanded
DM4m (#1.8m) for the safe return of the others.
Police said the man, who was believed to be armed with a handgun, was also
demanding a car in return for the hostages' release. Officers sealed off the
area and surrounded the building in Munich city centre.-Reuter.

LA Bonne Auberge, the bar and brasserie on the ground floor of Glasgow's newly
opened Holiday Inn Garden Court Hotel has much to offer end of the year
revellers with Christmas in the offing and New Year not far behind. There is a
three courses, coffee and mints lunch and dinner menu for #15.95 from Monday
December 11 until Sunday, December 24. There is also a slap-up five-course
dinner with a glass of champagne to bring in the New Year for #39.95 on
Hogmanay.
A special room rate of #25 per person, sharing, inclusive of full Scottish
breakfast is available on that celebratory occasion. The complete Hogmanay and
after experience inclusive of dinner, bed and breakfast can be booked for
#61.50 per head. Telephone 0141 427 4706 for reservations.
Maurice Taylor is no stranger to the culinary arts, having toiled at the Tour
d'Argent in Paris as the duck waiter, a pressing task. His love of good food is
reflected in his choice of head chef Gerard Sharkey to take charge of the
kitchen brigade. The brigadier Gerard has worked in some of the city's top
restaurants and hotels and has won three gold medals, one silver, and one
bronze in national competitions.
The philosophy behind La Bonne Auberge is quite simply to offer diners with a
cosmopolitan taste the opportunity to sample authentic French dishes at
reasonable prices in truly European surroundings. To this end the menu offers
starters such as French onion soup scented with port and terrine of roast ham
and chicken on a celeriac and snow pea salad with honey and ginger dressing and
main courses such as sauteed wood pigeon with creamed spinach in a light pastry
case on red wine essence and char-grilled calf liver with mustard and garlic
sauce plus polenta and rosemary.
The wine list is moderately priced and carefully selected with the old and the
new worlds represented. France, Germany, Italy and Spain vie with Australia,
California, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa for thirst attention. Nautilus
Cuvee Marlboro, a brut sparkler from the Antipodes, is well worth a try.

Washington, Thursday
THE House Ethics Committee has recommended the appointment of a special counsel
to look into the dealings of the Speaker, Newt Gingrich.
He was charged with violating the rules in nine matters, but only one is to be
referred to the counsel. The Speaker claims this amounts to vindication.
The committee vindicated him on three questions, found that he had violated the
rules in three others but recommended that no action be taken, and declined to
consider the other two.
The counsel will consider the allegation that Mr Gingrich used money
contributed to a political action committee called GOPAC to subsidise a course
he tought at a small college in Georgia. That would amount to diverting
political money to his personal use.
The independent counsel may decide that his remit is too narrow, and ask the
House to expand it to cover other matters.
That is what happened to an earlier Speaker, Jim Wright. He was eventually
forced to resign after Newt Gingrich, then a relatively junior back bencher,
persuaded the House to appoint a special counsel to look into a book deal. He
widened his investigation and eventually brought the Speaker down.
The matters on which Mr was cleared included his acceptance of a #3m book
advance from HarperCollins. The committee said this had the appearance of
selling his office for money but, because he renounced the advance when a
public outcry ensued, the appearance never became real.

THE Holiday Inn Garden Court at 161 West Nile Street is Glasgow's newest hotel.
Situated diagonally across from the city's Royal Concert Hall and within sight
of the Pavilion, it opened its doors at the beginning of the week in the heart
of aptly entitled Theatreland, giving the famous Holiday Inn name back to the
West of Scotland.
Owner/entrepreneur Maurice Taylor, who rose from being a summer night porter at
Turnberry to become a well-known local millionaire hotelier, is the man
responsible for the #4m, 80-bedroom, prestige project franchise operation which
brings twenty-first century standards to the world of today.
By skilful use of advance technology, the new Glasgow hotel is the first
Holiday Inn in Britain to have an interface with the corporate headquarters in
Atlanta, Georgia, via a satellite link in the car park.
At any one time the state of room availability is known throughout the network.
Internally, staff - at the touch of a button - can communicate information or
see problems as soon as they arise on a television monitor, leading to better
and more efficient service.
General manager Tony Wright is the ideal person to have in charge. He has
abundant experience of the hotel trade, has travelled extensively abroad
picking up management tips along the way and, most important, has worked for
Holiday Inns in the UK.
A year ago he was senior duty manager at the Holiday Inn, Heathrow, and before
coming to Glasgow was at the world's first Holiday Inn Garden Court in
Warrington. His help during the planning stages has proved invaluable.
It is no secret that Maurice Taylor is a Francophile with an eye for good
design. From the outside the Holiday Inn Garden Court, with its blond sandstone
facade, imposing clock tower and royal blue canopies above every ground floor
window, looks continental.
It would not be out of place on the Rue de Rivoli, but is built in fact on the
site of the nineteenth-century Bell's Quarry.
Through the hotel doors there is very much an Auld Alliance feel to the stylish
open-plan interior. Mr Taylor, Ron McCulloch, and his senior designer Claire
Kinna, have effected a European fin de siecle look in keeping with Glasgow's
art nouveau past.
The top of the reception desk is covered in black Ballachulish slate, a
technicolor, Tiffany-style cupola catches the eye in the entrance hall, and
metal work in the manner of Belgium's Victor Horta by Andy Scott contributes to
the imaginative EC concept.
Scottish firms and craftsmen were used wherever possible. Balfour Beattie,
Paisley, were the main contractors who brought the hotel in ahead of time - it
was not due to open until the New Year.
The principle architects were Glasgow's Cobban &amp; Lironi, furniture was
specially commissioned from Robert Morris Furnishings, of Castlemilk, and all
toilet pods were manufactured by Farquhar of Huntly, Aberdeenshire. Toilet pods
are essential to fast-track building where all bathroom and toilet facilities
come ready assembled in one piece.
In keeping with today's health-conscious trends, the top floor is the only
designated smoking floor. The remaining three are smoke free, with smoke
detectors and fire alarms in every room. All rooms are furnished and fitted to
Holiday Inn's exacting standards, including wall-hanging frames for unfolded
executive suit carriers and a special socket for laptop PC users.
Every room is equipped with trouser presses and hairdryers but rooms on the
third floor contain irons and ironing boards as well - a must for business
travellers.
Limed green oak and rag-rubbed aquamarine wallpaper have been used to pleasing
effect.
Direct dial telephones, remote control colour televisions with satellite and
in-house movies, and tea and coffee making facilities are standard. There is
only one price per room. The accommodation tarriff is #58.75 for a single,
double or twin room, with a #45 Friday to Sunday weekend rate inclusive of full
Scottish breakfasts.
There are facilities for the disabled. To cater for the important small
conference, commercial presentation and seminar market, the ground floor
Montmartre and Pigalle eating rooms are available, complete with Holiday Inn's
custom designed survival kits for organisers who may have left something
essential at home.
Prices for daily delegates are based on a minimum of 10 persons.
La Bonne Auberge brasserie and bar is a revival of Maurice Taylor's first wine
bar and restaurant which he opened in 1975 in the Park area of town.
From that period, the original metal sculpture of a Sommelier bearing a goblet
filled tray and the French Tricolour stand invitingly at the entrance.

WASHINGTON: Catherine Hamill, the nine-year-old who won President Bill
Clinton's heart during his visit to Northern Ireland last week, received a
red-carpet welcome to the White House last night, where she joined him in
lighting the Christmas tree.
Catherine moved the president by speaking in Belfast of the death her father in
the troubles. However when asked how she liked being in the limelight, she
said: ``I'm sick of it,'' adding that she was keen to go back to school.
Army kills Hutus
BUJUMBURA: Twenty-six people were killed when the Tutsi-led army attacked rebel
Hutu strongholds in Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, on Wednesday. More than
100,000 people have died in ethnic violence in the past two years in Burundi,
whose volatile ethnic make-up is similar to that which led to civil war and
genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.
Mubarak wins
CAIRO: The Egyptian ruling party won an overwhelming parliamentary majority in
violent and dirty elections in which at least 28 people were killed and armed
thugs roamed the countryside. The National Democratic Party of President Hosni
Mubarak won 317 of the 444 seats at stake in the two rounds of voting, which
opposition parties claim were rigged.
Plane crashes
MOSCOW: The search resumes today for a Russian plane which crashed with 97
people on board while flying from Sakhalin Island to the far eastern town of
Khabarovsk. It disappeared from radar screens on Wednesday, reviving concern
about air safety in the former Soviet Union.
Leader to speak
ATHENS: Ailing Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will be able to speak
for the first time in 11 days after a tracheotomy operation, his spokesman
said. Papandreou, 76, who has been in hospital since November 20 with lung and
kidney failure, has been kept alive on life-support systems. His ability to
speak will influence calls to elect a new leader.
Peak crumbles
PLYMOUTH: Rocks began to tumble from the rumbling volcano on the Caribbean
island of Montserrat yesterday and residents were warned to stay out of danger
zones. Last week some 4000 residents were evacuated as the growing lava dome
threatened rock slides and lava flows.
Polls policed
MOSCOW: Thousands of armed police will fan out across cities in Russia next
week at the start of a huge security operation to prevent violence disrupting
the December 17 election. Security has been stepped up because of the Chechen
confict and an upsurge in bombings, hijacks, and contract killings.
Blast kills 10
GENEVA: At least 10 people, including two United Nations guards, were killed
and 30 injured yesterday when a fuel tanker exploded in northern Iraq. The two
dead guards, a Pole and a Filipino, were helping to patrol Kurdish areas.

JACK Russell found himself back in the old routine as England's leading batsmen
again surrendered their wickets all too easily. On Monday, Russell kept Mike
Atherton company for four-and-a-half hours while the second Test was saved
against the odds.
And yesterday, the Gloucestershire wicketkeeper breathed new life into another
England innings that was disintegrating though lack of care and attention.
Three hours of diligence on a slow, low pitch brought 45 unbeaten runs which
led the tourists to a more respectable 263 for eight against Boland.
With Atherton resting after his Johannesburg heroics, the opening pairing of
Alec Stewart and Robin Smith made a useful start before they and England's top
order were prised out.
Stewart, Smith, Graham Thorpe, Graeme Hick, and Mike Watkinson all made decent
starts but were then out. In fact, the only front-line batsman who failed to
reach double figures was, almost inevitably, John Crawley,who looks certain to
replace Mark Ramprakash when the Test series resumes in Durban next week.

Pasadena, Thursday
A PROBE from the spacecraft Galileo successfully entered the atmosphere of the
planet Jupiter today to embark on a journey to the beginning of time.
The Galileo control room burst into joyful clapping as a technician yelled:
``We got it'', confirming that Galileo had linked up with the space probe as it
entered the Jovian atmosphere.
The announcement was followed by cries of ``All right''.
Torrance Johnson, a scientist who has been with the project since it started in
1977, said: ``This is a fantastic achievement just in the complexity of the
engineering; the probe flying on its own, slamming itself into the atmosphere,
protecting itself with its heat shield, and then phoning home.''
Johnson called it a ``major step closer to the beginning of time''.
Jupiter contains the same gases as the Sun and scientists hope data sent by the
probe to its mother ship will help them to learn how the solar system began and
subsequently evolved.
After a 2.3-billion-mile journey, the unmanned probe was the first space
vehicle to enter the giant planet's turbulent atmosphere.
For 75 minutes, Galileo will transmit data back to Earth which should vastly
increase our knowledge about one of the strangest places in the solar system.
Mission controllers had to manoeuvre the cone-shaped, 746lb probe into
Jupiter's atmosphere at exactly the right angle.
If they had failed, the craft would have been bounced into oblivion or
destroyed in a fireball.
Atmospheric physicist Professor Fred Taylor, head of the only British
scientific team involved in the #1bn mission, was watching events closely. He
is waiting to receive information from the spacecraft relayed to Oxford
University from the mission control centre in Pasadena, California.
Professor Taylor said: ``Jupiter is a closed book at the moment. Galileo should
tell us much more than we have been able to learn from telescopes and other
spacecraft that have flown past the planet.''
Professor Taylor will be studying Jupiter's strange atmospheric bands and the
giant red spot which can be seen from the Earth.
He will also be looking at the 300mph Jovian winds, as well as the planet's
raging hurricanes - some of them bigger than the Earth - and terrifying
lightning storms.

Baden-Baden, Thursday
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac warned today
that individual European Union members should not be allowed to block others on
the path to further integration.
In a letter to the EU summit next week in Madrid, the two said their countries
remained committed to forming a single EU currency ``according to the agreed
timetable and the meeting of the agreed criteria''.
The letter, issued at the end of their six-monthly summit, said: ``We want all
members to be able to take equal part in the progress of European integration
in the expanded Union.
``But the occasional problems of a partner in keeping pace should not be
allowed to limit the Union's capacity to act and make progress.''
Germany and France, whose summmits often set the tone for further EU policy,
therefore wanted a clause written into the EU treaty saying groups of members
could agree to further integration ``within the institutional framework of the
Union''.
The letter, a clear signal to countries like Britain which have opposed many
suggestions from Bonn and Paris for further integration, also listed four goals
for the Intergovernmental Conference opening next year to review the Maastricht
Treaty.
They were a better co-ordinated EU foreign and security policy, common
guidelines on asylum and immigration, introduction of qualified majority voting
in the EU, and a greater role for the European and national parliaments in
communty decision-making.-Reuter.

MARKET fears that major provisions would hit GEC's results proved unfounded and
analysts were generally satisfied with the figures. Not that the trading
position is exercising minds at present.
GEC is such a monolith and its businesses deal in such long, long timescales
that it takes a lot to shift it from its stately progress.
What interests the market is the management succession. At the end of the
1993/94 financial year, Lord Weinstock, the legendary managing director,
announced he was extending his tenure by two years. So far, no likely successor
has emerged but it is clear that chairman Lord Prior is considering a
short-list and that an announcement will be made next spring.
Assuming someone of sufficient stature is appointed, Lord Weinstock's successor
is likely to take quite a different view of the business. The group has never
captured the imagination of the City which sees it as worthy,
ultra-conservatively managed and dull.
Shareholders can await the outcome with equanimity. The prospect of change will
maintain interest in the shares which are worth their current level on trading
grounds alone.

ROVER has provided a few surprises in its new 200, writes ROSS FINLAY. While
the previous model shared the same platform as the 400, from now on each of the
two ranges has its own individual base. As a result, the 200 is smaller than
some people were expecting; and Rover is quite open about the fact that, as
with several of its cars, this one is in the showrooms at a premium price.
Well-rounded three- or five-door bodywork gives the new model a deliberately
sporting appearance, and continues the theme of using a ``family'' grille at
the front. This looks really good on the 800, but as the cars are scaled down
the grille is less able to play a strong part in the styling. On the 200, it is
all but overwhelmed by the air intake under the bumper.
Rover's exterior finish is among the best in the industry, and the 200 is
another model with a well-presented interior. The company takes great pains
over its trim patterns and materials. Velour upholstery is used in some
versions, while leather is an option at the top of the range.
On the mechanical front, the 200 has an unexpectedly wide choice of engines.
There are four types of the K-series unit, from 8-valve and 16-valve versions
of the 1.4-litre, to a 16-valve 1.6 and - available later - the 1.8-litre VVC
which was first used in the MGF. Rover is also pushing its own series turbo
diesel engine, which is available in the 200, either in 105bhp form with
electronic control, an intercooler and exhaust gas recirculation, or in a
simpler and lower-cost specification giving 86bhp.
Whatever the power unit installed, all the 200 models have advanced engine
mounting systems as part of the campaign against noise and vibration. The
suspension design is also sophisticated, and the intention is to present this
as an enthusiastic driver's car, with good stability at high cornering speeds.
Appearing when it does, the 200 raises questions about whether its design was
influenced by Honda or by BMW. The answer, firmly given, is neither. It was
planned without any Honda input or mechanical parts, and the project was
already well under way when the company changed ownership.
All 12 versions of the new car can be ordered now, although availability of the
various models is a phased-in affair. Prices start at #9995 for the three-door
214i. The top-rated petrol version is the five-door 216SLi at #13,895. Turbo
diesel prices go from #10,495 to #13,295, while the VVC-engined 200vi, for
later delivery, is expected to cost around #15,000.

UNIGATE has sold its 29% stake in the Nutricia baby foods business in Holland
for #332m and a touch above its expectations when the intention to sell was
announced on November 15.
The deal was done through a bookbuilding exercise organised by SBC Warburg and
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett. They sold the stock to institutions at 120 guilders
compared with the 117 guilders after the offer announcement.
Unigate now has some #200m net cash which will almost certainly be used to make
acquisitions under the guiding hand of Ian Martin.
Mr Martin became chairman earlier this year, having previously worked for Grand
Metropolitan where he excelled in aquisitions such as Pillsbury which brought
Burger King into the group. There were also some disposals.
His Glenisla corporate finance company helped organise the Kohlberg, Kravis
Roberts #205m purchase of the Reed Regional Newspapers and it is believed that
Dundee-born Mr Martin is now looking to acquire a prestige, quality title.

THE latest Rover is the baby of a long, distinguished line. For, as well as
being the repository of a remarkable number of dormant marque names - Austin,
Morris, Riley, Wolseley, Standard, Triumph and the rest - Rover was very nearly
the pioneering British car manufacturer.
John Starley, maker of Rover cycles, built the first car in Coventry, later the
heartland of the British motor industry. Although it was a three-wheeled
electric affair rather than a four-wheeled petrol design, it was neater than
many of the square-rigged efforts then seen on the Continent. Thanks to the
stuffiness of the British authorities, Starley took his car to Deauville in
France for testing. It managed about eight miles per hour, very fair going for
1888, but he decided not to put it into production. His real interest was in
Rover cycles. Three years after his death in 1901, Starley and Co decided to
make the move into cars, and transferred the Rover name to them.
Early Rover cars were small ones of six or eight horsepower, though a 20hp job
won the 1907 Tourist Trophy. By the start of the Thirties, Rover was building
cars like the Light Six Sportsman's Saloon which hit the headlines by beating
the famous Blue Train from St Raphael to Calais.
Rover later specialised in distinguished-looking saloons. Then came an
astonishing diversion into gas turbine power, when Rover-BRM turbine cars raced
at Le Mans, although they needed drivers like Graham Hill to deal with the
colossal throttle lag.
And yet another surprise move followed - into rallying . . . first with the
Three-litre, better known as a government chauffeurs' car, then with a team of
too-hard-to-tune 2000s.
After a series of mergers in the Sixties, Rover found itself a minor component
of British Leyland. Under that regime, its individuality was crushed. It must
amuse old Solihull hands that when the modern, much better organised group
decided to rechristen itself, it chose the marque with the Norse galley badge.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry completed his fifteenth successive victory in a
ranking tournament last night, reaching the semi-finals of the German Open in
Frankfurt with a 5-3 win against Rod Lawler.
Hendry, who has lost only one match this season, in the semi-finals of the
Thailand Open, took a 4-1 lead with breaks of 85, 67 and 51 - but still had a
fight on his hands.
Lawler narrowed the gap to 4-3 with runs of 44 and 77, but while Hendry
continued to give him chances, the 24-year-old world No.40 failed to force the
decider.
Hendry will meet Ken Doherty or Mark Bennett for a place in the final.
John Higgins earlier had booked his place in the semi-finals with a 5-4 victory
over Darren Morgan. The 20-year-old world No.11, now provisionally No.2 behind
Hendry, coasted to a 3-1 interval lead, helped by breaks of 82, 60 and 44. But
Morgan gradually warmed up to pinch the fifth frame on the black.
Higgins won the next and, with a 4-2 advantage, appeared set for a semi-final
showdown tomorrow with Alan McManus or David Roe. But Morgan fought back to 4-4
with breaks of 103 and 75. Morgan, though, missed a vital long blue in the
final frame and his opponent cleared up with 43.
q THE Belgian Masters, scheduled for next week, has been cancelled after
last-minute talks failed to bring about a compromise, following the omission of
two players in the top eight, James Wattana and Alan McManus.

AT THE recent Scottish rally championship awards night, while David Gillanders
collected the main trophy as the 1995 champion, John Fife retired after 15
years as the championship co-ordinator, having helped to guide the 40-year-old
series through some of its finest seasons.
He will continue to report on events and contribute to the development of the
sport through the Scottish Motorsport Federation.
A true enthusiast who manages to conceal a businesslike and thoughtful approach
behind ebullient and sometimes pyrotechnic behaviour, John Fife drifted into
rallying almost by accident. His first competitions were grass-track races with
a Riley 1.5-engined Austin Metropolitan, of which people still ask: ``A what?''
Seeing the light, he moved on to an Austin-Healey 100/4 and later a 3000. With
these he started speed hill climbing and circuit racing, taking part in the
last climb at Rest and be Thankful and being blown off into the weeds by an AC
Cobra at Croft.
However, working with Shell and later with White Horse, he spent part of the
1970s involved with the oil company's sponsorship of the Scottish rally
championship, then helping to promote the works-supported White Horse team with
which Waugh's Avenger won its class in the British championship.
He started co-driving in rallies during that time, in a Colt Lancer driven by
his friend John Cleland, very much in the spotlight as winner of this year's
British Touring Car Championship. They also shared a course-opening car on one
rally in the Borders.
John Fife has admired three Scottish champions above all others - Drew
Gallacher, whose confidence and control at the wheel of the Wylies Escort meant
``there was nobody to touch him''; Ken Wood, who stayed faithful to BL
products, rallying at first a Mini and then a Triumph Dolomite Sprint, before
winning championships in three different cars, a Triumph TR7 V8, a Rover 3500,
and a Metro 6R4; and . . .
John's third driving hero is someone he knew in the days before the lad had his
own licence, when they were both part of a group which took trials bikes to an
unofficial off-road site near Braidwood.
John pretended he had persuaded his own bike up a steep banking. The youngster
decided to tackle it too. Despite some spoof Fife advice about technique, he
displayed incredible balance, and throttle control, forcing his bike to the top
of a banking which John had never actually got near to climbing.
Seeing this, John told himself: ``That kid's something special''. And so Colin
McRae, Scotland's first World Rally Champion, has turned out to be.

ST JOHNSTONE yesterday paid Austrians FC Tirol #100,000 for midfield man Attila
Sekerleoglu, and manager Paul Sturrock wants to splash out another six-figure
fee on Coventry City winger, Leigh Jenkinson, in time to make it a double debut
in the Tayside derby with Dundee United at McDiarmid Park tomorrow.
Sturrock went straight from signing the Austrian into fresh talks with
Jenkinson and Saints hope that part of the twin signing will be completed
today. The Perth manager admits bringing in foreigners - Sekerleoglu is
believed to be the first Austrian to arrive in Scottish football - is always a
gamble. But he believes this one will pay handsome dividends.
The new Saint admitted he knows little about Scottish football, despite having
played for Austria Vienna against Hearts in a European tie several years ago.

YUGOSLAVIA today rebuffed warnings by France of possible retaliation unless two
French pilots downed by Bosnian Serbs three months ago were freed, calling the
threats unacceptable and counterproductive.
The Foreign Ministry in Belgrade was responding to yesterday's warning by
French President Jacques Chirac to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic that he
would ``draw all the appropriate conclusions'' if the two were not freed
rapidly.
However French officials made clear the fate of the pilots would not affect
next Thursday's signing in Paris of the Bosnia peace deal agreed in Dayton,
Ohio, in which Milosevic will be taking part.
Advance units of Nato troops who will enforce the deal are already in Bosnia to
prepare for the arrival of 60,000 due to pour in once the deal is signed.
And European and north American foreign ministers were meeting in Budapest
today to approve a plan for elections in Bosnia, a crucial pillar of the peace
deal dividing the country into Muslim-Croat and Serb halves.
Earlier today France hinted it might strike at the captors of the airmen shot
down during Nato air strikes against Bosnian Serbs in August, though giving no
direct indication that it knew who was holding them or where they were.
``The pilots must be freed immediately. If they are not, the consequences . . .
will strike those who are responsible for their detention and those who have
not respected their commitments,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt.
French Foreign Ministry sources said the word ``strike'' was a veiled threat of
force aimed partly at Milosevic, who has said he felt a personal responsibility
for the two airmen.
The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry issued a statement rejecting ``all tendentious
interpretations of the incident involving the two French pilots and attempts to
misuse it in order to exert pressure on, and make threats against, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia''.
``The fact that efforts so far have not yielded the expected results do not in
any way bring into question Yugoslavia's sincere interest and readiness to
clear up this case,'' the ministry said.
The last official word on the pilots was on October 18, when Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic said they had been captured and taken to hospital but
were later kidnapped by an unknown group, an explanation French officials
described as ``grotesque''.
Nato staged three abortive rescue missions for the two in September.
The French magazine VSD reported today that French secret services had located
the two near the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale, near Sarajevo, in a private
property owned by an officer close to Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko
Mladic.-Reuter.

BIRMINGHAM'S Robert McCracken will make a first defence of his Commonwealth
middleweight title against Worcester's Paul Busby next month.
Unbeaten McCracken, who won the vacant crown by beating Canada's Fitzgerald
Bruney last month, will face Busby at the Aston Villa Leisure Centre on January
31.
Telford's European middleweight champion, Richie Woodhall, will make a defence
of his title on the same bill, but his opponent is not yet known.
Woodhall's manager Mickey Duff currently is in talks with German champion
Salvador Yanez, Russian title-holder Alexander Zaitsey, and French champion
Hassine Cherifi.
Duff said: ``This will be a great night of boxing with both Robert and Richie
on the bill.
``I'm sure that we will not have any trouble selling out the show and I hope to
be able to announce soon who Richie will be fighting.''
q FORMER British super-featherweight champion Floyd Havard will restore his
links with promoter Frank Warren in a deal that could see him once again fight
for a world crown.
The 30-year-old Swansea fighter launched his professional career a decade ago
under Warren's guidance and fought for the IBF title last year.
He was beaten in six rounds by Puerto Rican John-John Molina in Cardiff but
hopes that a new seven-fight agreement with Warren will carry him to a world
title shot next summer.

CELTIC, who are beginning to sense they could finally end Rangers' domination
of the premier division championship, were believed to have had talks yesterday
with Morten Wieghorst, who has not hidden his desire to take his career on to a
higher level.
Dundee manager Jim Duffy confirmed last night: ``There has been an inquiry from
Parkhead today for the player. At this stage it hasn't gone any further and we
will have to see what develops.''
The Danish internationalist has been operating with Dundee on a month-to-month
basis while hoping to secure a transfer and the prospect of a move to Celtic is
bound to excite him.
It is my understanding that Celtic, who were linked with another of Dundee's
players, Neil McCann, might offer a cash sum plus one of their emerging
players. A transfer fee and a new player represents a powerful lure to Dundee's
Jim Duffy, who has known for some time he would not be able to hold on to
Wieghorst.
The 24-year-old midfield player, who signed from Lyngby three years ago for
#220,000, is regarded as one of the most composed and gifted footballers
currently playing outside the premier division, but it just might be that Burns
has in mind a different role for the 6ft 3in player. Celtic already possess the
top division's most fluently effective midfield with players like Paul McStay,
John Collins, Peter Grant, and Phil O'Donnell, and Wieghorst might be deployed
in a deeper role at Celtic Park.
Celtic have missed the composure of Brian O'Neil, who has been unavailable
because of injury for a considerable period, originally a midfield player
himself who was dropped back and started to emerge as an influential defender.
Wieghorst is not the fastest midfield performer and Burns, who yesterday helped
launch a Christmas video for fans, ``The Celtic A-Z'', might just have
identified the potential value in having him play central defence.
The transfer may hinge on where Wieghorst believes he can best be utilised, but
Celtic offer a major opportunity and greater exposure which could only benefit
his international career.
Burns' side are pressing Rangers, who could lose the services briefly of Alan
McLaren who has been summoned to appear before the SFA, in pursuit of the title
and hope to make up further ground tomorrow when they play Hibernian at Easter
Road. The Edinburgh side will be without the suspended Michael O'Neill, but
Mickey Weir is ready to resume active duty.
Hibs have had serious problems because of injuries and suspensions this season
and manager, Alex Miller, suffered again yesterday when he learned strker
Gareth Evans will miss the Boxing Day game against Partick Thistle because of a
one-match ban. Evans was booked in a reserve game against Motherwell at Easter
Road last week and he has gone over the disciplinary threshold.
Another striker, Kevin Harper, has a shoulder injury and defenders Graham
Mitchell, Willie Miller, and David Farrell also are casualties.
McLaren and Aberdeen's Billy Dodds are to face the SFA's disciplinary committee
in the new year to discuss their parts in an incident during a recent match at
Ibrox. The committee have already suspended John Brown and Paul Gascoigne for
their behaviour during the same match, parts of which became the subjects of a
police investigation.
McLaren and Dodds were not dealt with because the disciplinary committee were
informed they had been cautioned by the police, but the case was subsequently
dropped. ``We await confirmation from the procurator fiscal's office and when
that is received we will call the two players in, probably to the next arranged
meeting of the committee on January 22,'' said an SFA spokesman.

LEAVING Paisley, ears still tingling with the sound of weans laughing and
cheering, and telling each other what the best bits were ..... and Ofpants -
the official pantomime watchdog - stayed strangely silent. A sneaky squint at
the checklist - curiouser and curiouser...... It was blank. No ticks, no
crosses. No coded hieroglyphs in the margins. Nary a comment. Nothing.
Surely Ofpants couldn't have been indifferent to Babes in the Magic Wood? PACE
hadn't, somehow, gone beyond the pale of panto by daring to do away with the
old Robin Hood and Maid Marion scenario that so often loses babes - and
audiences - in Sherwood Forest? Had they?
A weird sound, a kind of snough - part snuffle, part cough - suggested
something had got up Ofpants' nose. Deep sighs. What was it with the watchdog?
Finally, a kind of broken muttering. ``That tiny stage ..... so much
imagination! Fresh jokes. Fresh JOKES.''
Something suspiciously like a tear glistened in that habitually
hard-to-hoodwink eye. In truth, Ofpants had been left speechless by Babes in
the Magic Wood. And for all the very best reasons.
Without recourse to big bucks or big names, this home-grown show - written and
directed by David Wallace, who also straps on a bustle and plays Dame -
celebrates all the brashness, warmth, hilarity, and conflict of traditional
panto in a way that is wholeheartedly gleeful and yet touchingly innocent.
And my, but it involves absolutely everybody. The garrulous, helpful hawkeye in
the audience quickly becomes a regular part of the action while, on-stage,
dozens of on-the-ball members of Paisley Youth Theatre sing, dance, and speak
up as cheery residents of Toytown or spooky tree people from the evil Queen's
domain.
Wallace, meanwhile, and his professional team of five add their own special
stamp - delivering discernible characters, not just punchlines. A sudden
movement caught my attention - Ofpants was scribbling this line. ``Paisley's
panto takes the biscuit - and that's official.''

A MALE dancer with Scottish Ballet has been charged in connection with an
alleged behind-the-scenes attack on a 25-year-old ballerina.
He is accused of punching Catarina Lappin in a backstage row during a
performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream in Edinburgh's Festival Theatre on
October 6.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police, who were asked to investigate last
month, yesterday said a report had gone to the procurator-fiscal at Edinburgh.
``A 33-year-old man has now been charged in connection with this alleged
incident,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for Scottish Ballet said the company was unable to comment
because it was now a police matter.
The company, which is currently staging its Christmas production Peter Pan at
the Festival Theatre, is thought to have conducted its own investigation into
the incident after a complaint by Ms Lappin.

A MOTHER whose daughter was seriously injured by bull bars fitted to a vehicle
has joined a Labour campaign to outlaw them.
Mrs Sharon Moule, of Essex, who has been nursing her daughter, Victoria, said:
``Children are most at risk and I am demanding immediate action in Parliament
to tackle this problem.''
``Victoria was very badly injured and is still having hospital treatment. She
had head injuries, lost her vision and had to have facial surgery. The bars
pushed a piece of bone out of her pelvis. They should be banned.''
Shadow Consumer Minister Nigel Griffiths and Labour MP Paul Flynn launched the
latest phase of their campaign at the Commons.
Last year, 35 people were killed and 1145 injured in accidents involving
vehicles fitted with bars, originally used in Australia to protect against
kangaroos.
Mr Griffiths said: ``Moves to get the bars banned have the support of the RAC,
the AA, Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and coroners dealing with
victims.''
The Government said last April it was powerless to ban bull bars, but the MPs
believe it is ignoring the advice of EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock
that  immediate steps could be taken in the UK to ban bars being added to cars
and those which come fitted to imported vehicles.

THE possibility of a conflict of interest involving a Scottish Office civil
servant seconded to a bank involved in a bid for the contract to build the new
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary was raised with Ministers yesterday.
Mr William Moyes, a Grade 5 officer who was head of the Purchasing Strategy
Division in the NHS management executive, has been on secondment to the British
Linen Bank since October 1994. The bank is involved in the Laing consortium,
which in May announced a #100m bid for the ERI contract, also being sought by
two other consortia.
Mr John McAllion, Labour's Scottish health spokesman, said he was alerted to Mr
Moyes's secondment by a report in The Herald and tabled a parlimentary question
about it. However, it was when he recently attended a Private Finance
Initiative seminar in Stirling and heard Mr Moyes introduced as the bank's
infrastructure finance spokesman that he became seriously concerned about a
possible conflict of interest.
He said: ``The latest Budget Report makes it clear that under the Private
Finance Initiative the public sector contracts to buy services and not assets.
Why then has the senior Scottish Office expert in purchasing health services
been seconded to just one bank involved in one consortium bidding for PFI
projects?''
He said the Scottish Health Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, should clear
up any doubts surrounding Mr Moyes' current position. ``We are therefore
calling on him to give an absolute assurance that there is no conflict of
interests and that Civil Service expertise is not being misused to promote the
commercial interests of one particular private consortium.''
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said there was no conflict of interest. Mr Moyes
had been seconded in the usual way.
She said: ``We understand the British Linen Bank is advising a number of
consortia bidding for a variety of projects in the UK. The purchasing process
for these projects is strictly defined by EC directives. The Scottish Office is
not involved in determining which consortia are chosen to bid for particular
contracts. This is a matter for the relevant NHS trusts and health boards.
Final decisions by Ministers will be taken on the advice of civil servants in
the usual way. Mr Moyes will not be involved in these.''

A WONDERFULLY elegant restaurant has emerged at 141 Elderslie Street where once
there was a strictly vegetarian Indian establishment. Ivory's - like the Ashoka
across the road, which incorporates a vegetarian menu - is owned by the Purewal
family, and Bashee Sumal is the proprietress. Strictly non-Indian, Ivory's
offers fine European cuisine served in the most sophisticated yet relaxed
surroundings. Here indeed is the place to forget life's cares, to celebrate a
special anniversary or occasion, to have a leisurely escapist lunch - or a
Christmas party, as it's that time of year.
The decor and ambience at Ivory's is unique and intimate.
Warm marbled walls, subdued baize, intriguing artifacts and gilded napkin
rings, the warmth of Mandarin slate on the floor and lovely low-key paintings
set the scene for a memorable night out.
But the proof of the pudding of course is in the eating.
Ivory's menus are seductive and varied but not alarmingly extensive. So you can
be sure that every dish is freshly prepared using the finest of local produce.
The menu changes monthly too and there's a tantalising lunch menu for the
leisured classes as well as a mouthwatering selection of dishes for dinner.
Pan-fried Monkfish on a bed of Seaweed served with a ginger shallot cream is my
healthy choice for a special treat, but it's hard to resist the Supreme of
Pheasant, pheasant supreme filled with salmon mousse and wrapped in a lattice
pastry.
Scotch smoked salmon with oat-cakes and a dill and horseradish cream serve as a
perfect starter for my taste, but there's always a chef's home-made soup for
the homely inclined or a Seafood Pancake - seafood wrapped in filo pastry
served on a lobster sauce.
Ivory's Christmas lunch menu is refreshingly imaginative.
Yes, you can have Norfolk turkey, served with sage and chestnut stuffing,
chipolata and cranberry sauce, but there's a Delice of Trout stuffed with Prawn
Farci too, or Roast Gigot of Lamb with traditional mint sauce, or Medallions of
Pork topped with Stilton and served with a red wine glaze.
Vegetarians will find tasty and sophisticated dishes to tempt their palates at
Ivory's and for habitual curry-eaters who are looking for a relaxing,
less-piquant European alternative to eating out in town (parking no problem in
the evenings) where better than Ivory's?

<TEXT>
SENIOR dentists at Glasgow Dental Hospital and School have taken the unusual
step of passing a vote of no confidence in the trust's chief executive.
Concern among the 45 consultants and other permanent staff came to a head at a
monthly meeting of the hospital's division of dentistry last night when the
dentists passed by a large majority a vote of no confidence in chief executive
Dr Doreen Steele.
The move is unusual because, although consultants in any NHS trust might
complain about management, they rarely take matters as far as a formal motion
of this nature.
A total of 48 of the 52 dentists who were eligible to take part cast their
votes at the meeting and, of those, 34 favoured the vote of no confidence while
five were against it and nine abstained.
It is believed that the vote may be only about the third of its type among
staff at any NHS trust in Britain.
The hospital became an NHS trust in April, under the chairmanship of Sir James
Armour, retired Vice-Principal of Glasgow University, but dissatisfaction goes
back about a year.
There are about 60 senior staff in the dental division, including 15
consultants employed by the NHS and 30 honorary consultants employed by Glasgow
University.
Their complaints include allegations of a ``confrontational'' management style
and that clinicians are not being involved sufficiently in policy-making.
One of the dentists who attended last night's meeting said afterwards: ``It was
quite a sombre meeting and no-one really wanted to take such action but it was
inevitable.
``I was not surprised by the vote. What was surprising is that the senior staff
have been so patient since Dr Steele has been in office. The surprise is that
we didn't do something before now.''
He added that the dentists believe the matter should now be considered
carefully by the board.
``They can hardly ignore it. I think the consultants would hope that the board
would consider radically changing their policies or radically changing the
chief executive. That would be the most sensible course of action to take.''
Dr Steele, who has been chief executive since the hospital became a trust and
was formerly general manager, did not attend the meeting and could not be
contacted last night.

SOCIAL Security Secretary Peter Lilley yesterday failed in his bid to stop an
86-year-old widow in a private home getting #50 a week in attendance allowance
from his department.
The Court of Appeal said that Mrs Vera Steane was entitled to the cash while in
the care of the home because it was formerly run by the council. The ruling
opens the way for thousands of similar claims.
Her representative, Mr Peter Pilgrem, the Legal Services manager at Newport
County Hall on the Isle of Wight, said: ``Anyone living in private residential
homes for the elderly which were once run by the local authority can now claim
the allowance.''
Mrs Steane lives at Elmdon, a residential home on the Isle of Wight, which was
originally run by the local council. On May 10, 1991, it was leased to
Islecare, a private charity, under council privatisation plans.
The Secretary of State held that although she had transferred to a private home
and was no longer in supported council accommodation, the local authority was
still liable for any income support, not central Government.
Yesterday, Lord Justice Aldous, sitting with Lord Justice Hirst and Mr Justice
Forbes, dismissed Mr Lilley's appeal and the other judges agreed. They granted
leave for the case to go to the House of Lords because of its importance as a
precedent.
A legal expert said the case was an important breakthrough for local
authorities which had privatised their residential homes, since it allowed them
to shift care costs to central Government.

GOOD news for Glasgow gourmets is that the well-loved Ashoka has risen
phoenix-like from the ashes and has recently reopened under the careful eye of
new owners, the Purewals, a Glasgow family who are dedicated to re-establishing
the restaurant and restoring it to its former glories and beyond.
The Purewal family have had a long and fruitful association with Indian cuisine
in Glasgow. They used to own several famous Indian restaurants in the city. The
superb Creme de la Creme, Europe's largest and finest Indian restaurant is
theirs, and the vegetarian Ashoka of Elderslie Street has metamorphosed into a
wonderfully elegant European restaurant under their new and imaginative
ownership.
For the non-carnivorous or health-conscious who may have regretted the demise
of an exclusively vegetarian Indian restaurant there is good news. The Ashoka
has incorporated a vegetarian menu into its extensive  la carte, which covers
the finest and most imaginative Indian food to be had in the city.
The restaurant is transformed. Gone are the dark soft-furnishings and the
gloomy regimented tables, and in their place is a freshness and lightness of
decor which makes dining there a special occasion. Warm yellows complement the
specially commissioned murals of mountain scenes by Dai and Jenny Vaughan,
Tiffany glass windows enhance the dreariest drizzle of a Glasgow December, and
floors are of beautiful, richly textured Mandarin slate.
The Ashoka can seat a surprisingly large number on its two floors, but the
Purewals have cut down a little on tables to make for a more spacious and
elegant eating experience. For those offices who have not yet fixed a venue for
the annual jamboree, the Ashoka is a splendid bet and Parminder Purewal is
willing to accommodate eleventh-hour bookings. Christmas lunch or dinner at the
Ashoka is a tempting option too for those who can't face the strains and
stresses of a home entertainment. Otherwise, for shoppers or workers, the
Ashoka is open seven days a week from noon until midnight except on Sundays
when the restaurant is open from five until midnight.
For the curious, by the way, Ashoka was an Emperor of India c274-232BC. He was
converted to Buddhism by a miracle and became its ``nursing father'', as
Constantine was of Christianity.

Stirling and
Ayr in the
Grand tour
THE new roving Scottish Grand Committee is to meet next month in the Stirling
constituency of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, and in another Tory
marginal, Ayr, at Labour's suggestion, writes Stuart Trotter.
The Opposition has decided that the committee of all Scotland's MPs which Mr
Forsyth proposed should meet at more venues in Scotland, should move into
vulnerable Tory areas.
The Ayr visit will be an evidence-taking session before MPs begin detailed
consideration of a Bill giving local authorities more powers over the holding
of rave parties.

A WOMAN who went to a police station to collect her husband was told she
couldn't see him as he'd just been pronounced dead, a court heard yesterday.
Mrs Irene Low, 61, of Dubbieside, Methil, Fife, made the claim at a fatal
accident inquiry at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court.
Sheriff William Christie heard that a large crack was found in Mr David Low's
skull after his death at Levenmouth police station on March 26.
The previous evening, the couple each had a sherry and Mr Low, 53, went for a
walk.
Shortly after 3am, Mrs Low was roused by a neighour, who said her husband had
been found lying in the road. Mrs Low telephoned the police station and was
told he had been examined by a doctor and was alright.
At the station the next morning, ``I began to get a bit suspicious and asked
what was wrong but they didn't say,'' Mrs Low said. ``I asked if I was getting
to see Dave and a policeman said, `No, I am sorry, he's just been pronounced
dead'.''
Asked if his death had shocked her, she replied, ``yes, he went out for a walk
and never came back.''
Publican, Mr John Band, 54, a former schoolmate of the dead man, said Mr Low
had arrived at his tavern on the evening of March 25 and consumed, at most, six
drinks before leaving about 2.30am.
Mr John Rhines, 51, said he was driving friends home when they saw Mr Low lying
unconscious at the side of the road.
One of his passengers, barmaid Ms Lorraine Morrison, 37, said she noticed the
back of Mr Low's head was covered in what appeared to be dried blood.
Police arrived minutes later and collected Mr Low.
Tayside Detective Chief Superintendent James Letham, 50, who carried out an
independent investigation, said a surveillance film of the police station
interior showed a doctor spent just 23 seconds in Mr Low's cell.
However, Kirkcaldy pathologist Dr Muhammed Nawroz, 44, who performed the
post-mortem examination said there was no chance of Mr Low's survival even if
he had received immediate treatment.
Dr Nawroz said Mr Low had suffered an extensive brain haemorrhage which ``would
be in keeping with him falling on a hard surface'' and unlikely to have been
caused by a car. He said Mr Low had 272mg of alcohol in his blood.
The doctor said he would not have expected a lay person to detect the severity
of Mr Low's injuries.
The inquiry continues today.

A MAN wielding a knife who held up a shopkeeper weeks after completing a
sentence for assault and robbery was jailed for six years yesterday.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, told Michael Carr that such offences were
becoming far too common and the courts had do what they could to protect
shopkeepers.
Carr, 23, admitted assaulting Mr Steven Lyon, 28, in the shop at Angle Park
Terrace, Edinburgh, on September 26 this year by menacing him with a knife. He
forced him to open the cash register, demanded money, and robbed the shopkeeper
of #285.
Mr Craig Scott, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh that Carr, of
Lomax Road, Queenslie, Glasgow, had a criminal record stretching back to 1987.
In September 1992 he had been sentenced to four years for assault and robbery
and had been released in July this year.
The shopkeeper was able to give police a fairly detailed description and Carr
was arrested two days after the incident.
The Advocate-depute explained that the incident had had a significant impact on
Mr Lyon, who was now considerably more anxious about the chances of a further
hold-up in his shop.
Mr William McVicar, defence counsel, said that the accused had spent much of
his life in custody. At the completion of his last sentence in July he had been
put out on the streets with no idea of what to do with himself.

LABOUR yesterday unveiled plans for a football task force designed to tackle
hooliganism and restore the sport's tarnished image.
The party wants to clean up a sport which it says has suffered from thuggery by
far-right extremists and appalling behaviour by supporters and players.
Labour also set out to crack down on financial scandals, bungs, allegations of
match-fixing and drugs use by players.
The party's Charter for Football also would address issues such as escalating
ticket prices, restrictive TV coverage and the precarious financial position of
small, lower league clubs.
COMPUTERS all over Britain are set to fail in just over five years because of a
technical hitch, the Prime Minister was told yesterday. Tory David Atkinson, MP
for Bournemouth East, said it was because computers were not programmed to
recognise the double-zero of the year 2000. This would have ``immense
consequences'' for British business and government departments, Mr Atkinson
said.
THE Government yesterday announced plans to reform the ancient system of
military justice, including a greater say for Service members on whether cases
should be heard by a court-martial or a commanding officer. Armed Forces
Minister Nicholas Soames said in a written reply that the changes would be
introduced in the Armed Forces Bill, currently going through Parliament.
UNDER-AGE smokers are netting the Treasury an estimated #100m in tax every
year, the Government disclosed last night. The figure was based on the results
of surveys by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in four years since
1990.

A HIGH Court judge will decide today whether rail franchise director Roger
Salmon should sign over the first three franchises next week or restart the
tendering process from scratch, thereby delaying and perhaps even derailing the
privatisation programme.
Mr Justice Macpherson yesterday heard allegations that minimum services allowed
under rail privatisation were set so low that they were ``in defiance of
guarantees given to Parliament''.
In a legal challenge that could throw the Government's sell-off plans into
confusion, Mr Nigel Pleming QC, for the Save Our Railways pressure group, told
the court that instructions from former Transport Secretary John MacGregor,
aimed at safeguarding service levels based on existing timetables, had not been
obeyed by Mr Salmon.
The challenge centres on the first tranche of franchises covering the Great
Western, South West Trains, and the London, Tilbury, and Southend, due to be
finalised next week, and the second batch, including InterCity East Coast,
Network SouthCentral, Midland Main Line, and Gatwick Express.
Mr Pleming told the judge the director had acted outside his discretion and in
breach of his duty under the 1993 Railways Act, the aim of which was to put the
publicly-owned railways and railway services into private ownership.
In March last year, Mr MacGregor had published a document stating that: ``For
the initial letting of the franchises, your minimum service levels for railway
passenger services is to be based on that provided by BR immediately prior to
franchising.''
This was in line with guarantees given to Parliament over minimum services,
said Mr Pleming. In defiance of those guarantees, Mr Salmon had unlawfully set
passenger service requirements that effectively ``diminished the level of
service'' that could be guaranteed.
Mr Salmon had acted as if he could ``pick and choose'' existing services and
there was a very vague approach to which services were to be protected and
which were not.
Mr Jeremy Sullivan QC, for the franchise director, said the scheme's opponents
had misinterpreted the situation.
Their argument largely rested on the interpretation of the instruction
requiring minimum service levels to be ``based on'' that provided by BR prior
to franchising.
He said: ``On the ordinary interpretation of the words `x is to be based on y'
they don't mean `x is to be the same as y' or `x is to be the same as y with
minor variations'.''
When read as a whole, the emphasis of the guidelines and instructions given to
Mr Salmon was on getting value for money and on flexibility to encourage
commercial initiative.
Mr Sullivan said that if assurances were given to Parliament which were not
carried through, that was a matter for Parliament and not the courts.
Mr Sullivan stressed that the passenger service requirement (PSR) laid down by
Mr Salmon was not intended to reflect the service level which was actually
going to be provided by a franchisee. The majority of those currently tendering
for franchises were offering to provide service levels above the PSR, he said.
Mr Justice Macpherson, announcing he would give his judgment at 2pm today,
said: ``It is no easier for a judge when argument on both sides is so good.''

Carole Woddis explores the string of Scottish hits at London's Bush Theatre
WELL, we hardly need wait for the Sunday papers. David Harrower's Knives in
Hens has, like Mike Cullen's The Cut, Chris Hannan's Evil Doers and The Baby,
and the ubiquitous Trainspotting, made the journey to London's Bush Theatre to
be greeted with something close to rapture.
Michael Billington in the Guardian declared it a ``remarkable theatrical
debut''. The Independent called it ``a first play of unusual assurance, wit,
and intelligence'', while the Times's Benedict Nightingale, though describing
it as ``dour and difficult,'' found it ``a genuinely original evening that
raises questions about the nature of language, God, and civilisation itself''.
True, Nick Curtis, of the Evening Standard, struck a carping note. But even he
had to admit that: ``Harrower's play is a debut of rare promise.'' Meanwhile,
in its very first week Harrower's play jumped straight to number one in Time
Out's prestigious Critics' Choice.
All of which makes an interesting contrast with the reception meted out to the
Tron's Dumbstruck and Wildcat's Bedfellows - Scottish imports which earned some
of the worst crits of 1995.
So what is it about the Bush? Why do they seem to have had the midas touch
where others have failed? Ian Brown of the Traverse puts it very simply:
``Dominic Dromgoole, the Bush's current artistic director, has good taste. He's
got a good eye and knows things that will work well for him.''
Dromgoole puts it another way. ``You know when it's quality writing; you can
practically smell it. The same is true of Irish writing.'' Dromgoole
acknowledges they've drawn heavily on the Traverse and their system of
nurturing writers but, he maintains, the Bush's success with Scottish plays is
not due to any intrinsically pro-Scottish policy decision.
``We've picked these plays primarily because we think they're the finest
writers; they're all in their funny ways specific to their own situations
rather than trying to be Scottish.''
There is, however, one other aspect to be mentioned in connection with the
Bush's string of Scottish successes. As Brown says: ``It's got to be work that
travels. Comedy is so much harder.''
That's a view shared by Nick Kent whose Tricycle Theatre suffered a mauling
with Bedfellows. ``I love theatre that's visceral and engages with the
community. I saw a review of Bedfellows in the Sunday Times and thought it
would fit into ours. But it seems the minute you take something out of its own
community, you divorce it from its roots. It gets judged in a different
context, and more harshly, so that what started out as an excuse for a hooley
takes on instead more of a shrieking, village-hall type of piece.
``The plays that go down well in London now are from a younger age group -
exactly the same as the Irish syndrome, 19 to 28-year-olds. Angry,
rock-oriented. There's an audience for that. But when you bring something
political, it doesn't seem enormously relevant to us. If you're political, you
can get your head round it. But most of our audiences don't seem to want to be
bothered.
``The Cut and Trainspotting are much more to do with young people, universal
issues they can relate to. They draw the crowds.''
Call English audiences lazy if you like - and I've heard similar excuses for a
whole range of plays - the answer is surely that the magic elements which make
a play gell with audiences are part talent, part quality, and part the
zeitgeist of the moment. The best playwrights seem able to externalise and give
shape to all of them.

THE Prime Minister will use next week's Euro-summit to press the United
Kingdom's case for less rhetoric and more action from Brussels, Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told the Commons last night.
He was speaking during a debate on Europe which once again exposed divisions on
both sides of the House on the issue, and brought a warning from Tory former
Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath that the Government should not set out a
defined position before talks took place.
The Prime Minister, at Question Time, gave a firm commitment that at next
year's summit on Europe's future he will oppose the extension of qualified
majority voting, ``massive'' new powers for the European Parliament and signing
up to the Social Chapter.
He confirmed that the Government was considering bringing out a White Paper on
Europe, but insisted its policies on these areas were firm and would not change.
Mr Major first clashed on the issue with Labour leader Tony Blair and was then
told by veteran Tory Euro-sceptic Teddy Taylor (Southend East) that a White
Paper would ``draw to the public's attention to the ever-widening gulf between
the Government and Opposition, which, under its present leadership, is destined
to surrender more of our liberty and our power and our jobs to Brussels.''
Mr Major replied: ``That does seem to be clear in many of the speeches of
Labour MPs, though not universally, for they seem to sing a different tune on
some occasions.''
The Government was considering the desirability of a White Paper, but had made
clear on a number of occasions that there were some areas which certainly would
be opposed in the negotiations.
EU leaders meet in Madrid on Friday and Saturday of next week, when the likely
agenda for next year's ``Maastricht II'' inter-governmental conference will be
discussed.
Mr Rifkind told the House: ``At Madrid, our Prime Minister will again reinforce
the message that we want progress on enhancing competitiveness, improving the
quality and reducing the quantity of legislation, and deregulating labour
markets to make them more responsive, creating jobs and reducing unemployment.''
Claiming that the battle was being won, Mr Rifkind said: ``We want less
rhetoric, more action, and we will continue to push strongly for this.''
The Foreign Secretary clashed repeatedly with his Labour Shadow Robin Cook, who
claimed that Euro-sceptics were dictating the Government's European policy.
``The Euro-sceptics are in charge,'' he said. ``There is now no hoop too tight
through which Ministers will not slim down their beliefs in order to squeeze
through.''
He reaffirmed Labour's commitment to a single currency when conditions were
right, stating: ``The test of convergence for the single currency has to be the
convergence of the real economy - industry, jobs, productivity, output - not
just the financial criteria the Government signed up to in the Maastricht
Treaty.''
Sir Edward warned both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary that saying
``this is in our interest and that's that'' was not negotiation.
The former Premier, who took Britain into the Common Market, drew scornful
cries from Tory Euro-sceptics when he spoke in favour of Britain signing the
Social Chapter and introducing a minimum wage, and pressed for a single
currency to be introduced as quickly as possible.
Pro-European Tory ex-Minister Edwina Currie (Derbyshire South), who was
defeated in her bid to become an MEP at the last Euro-elections, told the House
she hoped Britain would be ``courageous'' enough to join a single currency when
the time came.
For the Liberal Democrats, European Affairs spokesman Charles Kennedy said:
``This is a broken-backed Government and a terminally split Tory Party over
Europe. We can expect them to wrap themselves in the flag - the Union flag - as
the election approaches. They will fight an increasingly chauvinistic
campaign.''
q The Prime Minister told MPs that Britain is ``profoundly dissatisfied'' with
some decisions taken by the European Commission of Human Rights but will not
withdraw from it.
Instead, the Government is to take up the question with the commission and deal
with it ``in some way in the future'', he said.

IF you had turned up for this Messiah expecting the customary massed host of
singers and full-blown orchestra then you would be forgiven for being initially
a little taken aback. With only 20 singers on stage, no apparent soloists, and
a 15-piece orchestra, it might well have looked like this was to be a pocket
version of Handel's seasonal evergreen.
Not so. Those previously acquainted with this performance by the John Currie
Singers will know how effective these small resources can be, any doubting
Thomas surely instantly reassured by the bright, lucid textures of the overture
and the commanding opening recitative from Dennis Haggerty. Establishing the
pattern for the performance, Haggerty stepped forward from the twin ranks of
the choir and delivered his aria, returned, to be followed in rotation by nine
of his colleagues, thus sharing round the solo slots.
All produced highly expressive singing, allowed lots of air space by the
sympathetic support of the orchestra under John Currie's very positive
direction. Capitalising on the opportunity for tightness of ensemble playing
that such small numbers bring, he drove the work forward at a cracking pace
without ever losing articulation. And what a performance he got in those
legendary choruses - crisp entries, clean notes, huge surges of power, and
razor-sharp finishes.
This was a radiant Messiah, and despite the non-stop commitment from the choir
throughout the evening they still had plenty in reserve to deliver a stirring
final chorus that shimmered gloriously.

THERE was no evidence, said the Prime Minister, reading his brief carefully,
that eating meat gave humans mad cow disease.
``Oh, I don't know,'' chirruped the irrepressible Mr Tony Banks (Newham North
West - Lab.). ``Look at the Cabinet.'' The meat-eaters on the Treasury Bench
did their best to look in complete possession of their faculties.
Mr Jimmy Hood (Clydesdale - Lab.) had something of a forensic triumph when,
after accusing Mr Major of being ``decisively indecisive,'' the man obliged by
admitting that the Cabinet could not yet decide whether to produce a White
Paper on how its sees the future in Europe. With Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr
Michael Portillo involved, one sees the difficulty.
Sir Peter Tapsell (Lindsey East - Con.) spoke grandly of the disorders across
the Channel as a grim warning of what happens when you try to shackle your
economy to a single European currency. He did this rather in the manner of a
Whig aristo reflecting on the early stages of the French Revolution.
Mr Major is, of course, too nice to relish the sight of another EU government
in even worse trouble than his own. He stood by Messrs Chirac and Juppe and
blamed their troubles, as doubtless they are doing, on the incapacity of their
socialist predecessors.
Mr Juppe is beginning to resemble the unfortunate royal minister Necker, but
may be comforted by the thought that Necker did not go to the guillotine.
Mr Blair, who cannot be paying attention to the observations of his Shadow
Foreign Secretary, Mr Robin Cook, made much of the Tory Party being split
between those who are keen on Europe and those who, if Sir Teddy and Bill Cash
will forgive the understatement, are not keen.
Mr Banks, who is working up to becoming a sort of Mother Teresa of the animal
kingdom, then cast politics to the four winds and begged Mr Major to join him
in urging people not to buy puppies for Christmas presents unless the pups were
going to be a lifelong commitment. Mr Major agreed. It was certainly easier
than steering a decisively indecisive course on the single currency.
We passed from one majority passion of the British public - animals - to
another - the Princess of Wales. The princess may see the way the political
wind is blowing or she may just have been furthering her campaign to become
queen of our hearts.
However, she had shared a platform with a Labour spokesman and several
organisations who are not great admirers of the Government's housing and
benefits policies. Her remarks were along the ``something must be done'' lines
which her husband's predecessor as Prince of Wales patented in the valleys.
It was not difficult for Mr John McFall (Dumbarton - Lab.) to couple this with
an attack on the indadequacy of Government policies for the homeless. Ministers
are thought to be a bit peeved at the company Diana was keeping on that
platform. However, one of his Ministers, Mr Nicholas Soames, having recently
shown the unwisdom of being rude about the beautiful princess, Mr Major simply
replied that the Government had cut the numbers sleeping in the streets
substantially and hoped to eliminate them - in the sense of finding them beds
with roofs over them - soon.
He inferred that there was a bit of a cult about sleeping rough among some
young people and implied that, like human sacrifice and liberal governments, it
could soon be a thing of the past.

AND Lo! the season of festive music is upon us with the Scottish Early Music
Consort joining the Choir from St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral, Edinburgh, in
their attempt to bring a little stardust to a decidedly jaded City Hall. Tinsel
decorations draped the stage and auditorium but all the sparkle came from the
singing of the 12 adult lay clerks and 16 young boys and girls - aged eight to
13 - who make up the St Mary's Choir. In two cantatas from Bach's Christmas
Oratorio their diction was clear, they blended well, and the younger members
particularly, sang with an unassuming ease that was a delight to both watch and
hear. The choir even provided three soloists, Adrian Stones, Andrew Arthur, and
Nick Hall to stand in for the indisposed Fiona Milne.
The other soloists Alan Watt, Stuart Patterson, and Mhairi Lawson were all in
good voice, even if Miss Lawson tended to being swamped by the orchestral
accompaniment from the Baroque Orchestra of the SEMC.
The lighter side of the concert comprised three carols, some audience
participation in an up-beat reprise of Good Christmas Men Rejoice, and the
fiendish Concerto for Two Trumpets by Vivaldi. Robert Baxter and Alexander
McGrattan coped manfully on their valveless baroque instruments but were
upstaged by some brilliant lip work from the trumpet of Christopher Dicken in
the closing Bach cantata.
Gregory Squire generally directed with an even hand and tried hard to inject an
air of levity. The good-sized audience seemed well pleased, remaining sanguine
in the face of some awkward longeurs between numbers.

A GIRL of three has become the youngest person to have pioneering surgery to
stop cancer treatment making her infertile.
Harriet Selka, who has a rare kidney cancer, had part of her ovary removed so
that it would not be damaged by radiotherapy.
The tiny section of tissue has been deep frozen and will be replaced after the
treatment is finished, possibly in 20 years.
Harriet, of Thurstonland, Huddersfield, is one of a handful of people to have
undergone the procedure.
It has been devised by a team led by Professor Roger Gosden, professor of
reproductive biology at Leeds General Infirmary, which is also about to begin
similar trials on males.
In the past, only adult male cancer patients have been able to retain their
fertility, by donating sperm before treatment.
Professor Gosden nows plans to help boys who have not reached puberty by
removing and freezing the cells in the testicles that manufacture sperm and
replacing them after treatment.
Harriet developed a form of cancer known as Wilm's tumour in July last year and
had one of her kidneys removed. She had the piece of her left ovary removed in
October and is now in remission from the cancer.
Her mother Elizabeth said: ``What Professor Gosden is doing is wonderful and if
it proves successful and he helps children that would otherwise be sterile to
have children themselves, it will be a compensatory bonus for what they've gone
through.''

THIS one-off rehearsed reading of Andrew Dallmeyer's new play kicks off the
Tron Theatre's admirable short season of New Scottish Writing, and will be
followed by a rehearsed extract on Friday of the company's next musical,
Stiff!, written by and starring Forbes Masson. On Saturday Michael Boyd will
direct a work-in-progress presentation of The Love We Find Ourselves, written
by Penetrator author Anthony Neilson.
Previous Tron Theatre Company successes have evolved from work-in-progress
presentations, such as The Trick is To Keep Breathing, The Steamie, and The Cut
but it is more difficult to discern potential from the rehearsed-reading
format. Dallmeyer's play has so many physical and visual gags that it clearly
needs a theatrical framework to realise the comedy.
All the same, this reading lacked the focus and energy necessary to suggest
that the piece could be successfully developed. Dallmeyer is an accomplished
wordsmith and the script packs an ebullient enough punch but the premise - a
young Muslim Glaswegian joke shop manager, Tariq Azid, bears a strong physical
resemblance to a controversial author Solomon Rashdie (sic) and is subject to
violent attacks because of this mistaken identity - is less imaginative than
the various vivid characterisations. The parallels to Salman Rushdie are too
dated and tired to have any satirical bite and the dramatic debate about Muslim
fundamentalism lacks sophistication.
Particularly unconvincing is Azid's abrupt nervous breakdown and sudden plunge
into the delusion that he is in fact Rushdie. Dallmeyer is a master of the pun
and parody - with a very witty spoof on Rushdie's literary style - but the
cohesion of the play was unconvincing.

A SHERIFF forfeited a would-be cowboy's gun yesterday during an appearance in
Paisley Sheriff Court.
The court heard that Andrew ``Big Clint'' Henderson, 43, of Foxbar, was
practicing his cross-belly draw in front of friends in his living room when the
gun accidentally discharged.
The party of Wild West lovers had been due to visit the Outlaw Gunslingers'
Club in Glasgow when Henderson's revolver became snagged in the waistband of
his trousers and went off.
Ambulance men found Henderson sprawled on the floor with flash burns to his
inside leg. Police became involved because a firearm had inflicted the injury.
The replica handgun had been ``radically altered'', with the blocked-off barrel
opened up to allow flame to shoot out whenever it fired blanks, the court
heard. After being shown photographs of Henderson dressed in his cowboy gear,
Sheriff Robert McCallum ordered the firearm be forfeited but said, in the
circumstances, he was prepared to admonish the accused.
As he left the court, Mr Henderson said: ``I've been a member of the club for
six years. I love the clubs and have been all over the country, but I guess my
shootin' days are over now.''

I'm sure that the majority present last night at the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra's 60th birthday concert will disagree, but neither the structure nor
overall content of the programme, it seemed to me, did the SSO justice.
Arguably the programme was too long, containing one modern work too many.
Certainly, with the two substantial and recently composed works hard up against
one another, then followed by a lacklustre version of Elgar's Enigma
Variations, it made for a vast and sprawling second half.
Additionally, neither of the contemporary pieces - both conducted with clarity
and expertise by Martyn Brabbins - was a display piece for the orchestra, nor a
major piece in its own right. Thea Musgrave's Journey Through a Japanese
Landscape, a stylised essay featuring Evelyn Glennie on marimba, was -
especially for this composer - a rather rambling piece, only revealing
Musgrave's typically muscular and brilliantly hectic pacing in its second
movement.
And Iain Hamilton's The Transit of Jupiter (commissioned for the occasion)
seemed, despite moments of great atmosphere - music for a film, perhaps -
terribly old-fashioned and lacking in direction: music redolent of the late
sixties in its abstract, intellectual manner. Something by one of the young
bloods, with a bit more of a wallop, would have shown the SSO at strength.
And, though conductor Jerzy Maksymiuk's accompaniment to pianist Dmitri
Alexeev's near-demented, bat-out-of-hell version of Rachmaninov's Paganini
Variations was edge-of-the-seat stuff, Elgar's Enigma Variations - turgidly
unfolded - just didn't seem the Polish conductor's piece. Surely some of his
incandescent Sibelius would have been more appropriate.
Overall, less of an event than it could and should have been.

NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew was accused yesterday of
``disinterested neutrality'' about the Province's place in the Union compared
with the position taken by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who said last
week that the Government ``stood four-square behind the Union.''
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble also criticised Sir Patrick's co-operation
``with a foreign government that is subject to a constitutional imperative to
destroy that Union.''
Sir Patrick said that Irish Prime Minister John Bruton had announced plans for
a referendum to renounce the republic's territorial claims over Northern
Ireland.
The Government had made clear that there would be no change in the Province's
status unless the people of Northern Ireland wanted it, and both he and the
Prime Minister had made it clear time and time again ``that we are very much in
support of the Union.''.
He insisted that security force weapons would not be considered by the
independent international commission headed by American Senator George Mitchell
which is to examine how illegally held arms can be decommissioned.
He was replying to Tory Lady Olga Maitland, who the Senator's appearance on a
BBC Newsnight programme, saying: ``Mr Mitchell laughed and said he would be
perfectly happy to look at Government weapons. Surely this is clearly not what
we had in mind.''

A LEADING Thatcherite accused the Princess of Wales of trying to dodge the
``oblivion of divorce'' by manufacturing a new role for herself.
Sir Bernard Ingham, a former No 10 press secretary, condemned her as an
``elaborate confection sculpted by spin doctors''.
Writing in the Daily Express, he said: ``I cannot see any possible objection to
the princess ruining her beauty sleep by visiting the sick, the depressed, and
the dying. But . . . I draw the line at her claiming she has a special line to
people's hearts.''
He also suggested the princess's media exposure might please the palace:
``Another interview, another yard of rope. Sooner or later she will hang
herself.''

THE future of strategic rail projects in the West of Scotland, including the
#79m CrossRail project in Glasgow city centre, are doubly threatened by rail
privatisation and local government reorganisation.
The warning came yesterday from Strathclyde's transport official, Councillor
Charles Gordon, who fears that the severe charging regime adopted by Railtrack,
which now owns all railway infrastructure, could spell the end for strategic
investment.
He argued that situation could be exacerbated in April when Strathclyde region,
which ploughs an annual subsidy of more than #30m into the network, is replaced
by 12 unitary authorities who might find the scale of investment required quite
daunting.
Mr Gordon did not know anyone who found the terms of Railtrack investment
attractive. For example, the cost of CrossRail, which would link Glasgow's
North and South electric services, had doubled from an original Strathclyde
estimate of around #39m. Similarly the proposed reopening the Larkhall line in
Lanarkshire had burgeoned from a Strathclyde estimate of #7m to a Railtrack
estimate of #13m.
He said he was concerned that members of the new Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Executive, which after April 1 would comprise delegates from the 12
unitary authorities replacing the regional council, would look twice at huge
projects like CrossRail.
Meanwhile, a High Court judge will decide today whether rail franchise director
Roger Salmon should sign over the first three franchises next week or restart
the tendering process from scratch, thereby delaying and perhaps even derailing
privatisation.
Mr Justice Macpherson yesterday heard allegations that minimum services allowed
under rail privatisation were set so low that they were ``in defiance of
guarantees given to Parliament''.
In a legal challenge that could throw the Government's sell-off plans into
confusion, Mr Nigel Pleming QC, for the Save Our Railways pressure group, told
the court that instructions from former Transport Secretary John MacGregor,
aimed at safeguarding service levels based on existing timetables, had not been
obeyed by Mr Salmon.
In March last year, Mr MacGregor had published a document stating entitled
Objectives, Instructions, and Guidance for the Franchising Director, which
stated that: ``For the initial letting of the franchises, your minimum service
levels for railway passenger services is to be based on that provided by BR
immediately prior to franchising.''
This was in line with guarantees given to Parliament over minimum services,
said Mr Pleming. In defiance of those guarantees, Mr Salmon had unlawfully set
passenger service requirements that effectively ``diminished the level of
service'' that could be guaranteed.
Mr Jeremy Sullivan QC, for the franchise director, said the scheme's opponents
had misinterpreted the situation.
Their argument largely rested on the interpretation of the instruction
requiring minimum service levels to be ``based on'' that provided by BR prior
to franchising.
He said: ``On the ordinary interpretation of the words `x is to be based on y'
they don't mean `x is to be the same as y' or `x is to be the same as y with
minor variations'.''

<HEADLINE>Tory anger at princess's charity plea Major faces Commons questions after call to defend young homeless</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

THE Princess of Wales was criticised by Tory MPs last night after delivering a
passionate plea on behalf of homeless young people who are forced to beg and
resort to prostitution.
She angered them by sharing a platform with Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw
and making a speech which they saw as critical of Government policies towards
the homeless.
The Prime Minister was forced to defend the Government's approach at Commons
Question Time as the princess's outspoken intervention won Labour praise.
The princess's appearance at a meeting in London of the housing charity,
Centrepoint, came less than 48 hours after Mr Major's audience with the Queen
on Tuesday.
The princess wants to carve a niche for herself as a goodwill ambassador for
Britain and Mr Major is believed to think she can play a valuable role.
During her Panorama interview last month, the princess said she wanted a
meaningful role as the nation's ``queen of hearts''.
However, last night, Conservative politicians warned that she had blotted her
copybook by becoming ensnared in politics, appearing beside Mr Straw and
applauding his speech.
Tory MP Anthony Steen said: ``The fact that she shared a platform with Jack
Straw shows, unfortunately, how vulnerable she is to the influence of those who
want to exploit her unique position for party political ends.''
Former Minister Neil Hamilton said: ``She was very ill-advised. Jack Straw used
it as a political platform to attack the Government.''
Tory MP Harry Greenway claimed: ``She has been duped by a socialist speech
writer. She has done herself enormous damage with her friends and with
everybody else. She has made a serious error in appearing on a platform with
Jack Straw.''
In a hard-hitting and heartfelt speech, the princess appealed for homeless and
vulnerable young people to be given a better chance in life.
``We, as part of society, must ensure that young people - who are our future -
are given the chance they deserve,'' she said. She was appalled at the dangers
homeless young people faced on the streets and how vulnerable they were to
exploitation.
The princess cited ``16 and 17-year-olds who resort to begging - or worse,
prostitution - to get money in order to eat.''
``It is truly tragic to see the total waste of so many young lives - of so much
potential.''
Centrepoint insisted last night that the princess had not known Mr Straw was to
be at the event when she accepted the invitation.
A spokesman said Home Secretary Michael Howard had been its guest last year and
it was the Opposition's turn this year. The spokesman said: ``The princess has
been our patron since 1991 and since then she has been a regular visitor to all
our projects, sometimes on an informal basis.''
Centrepoint is angry at Government moves in the Budget to cut housing benefit
for young people under 25 and has warned that this would lead to more homeless
young people.
The leader of the Commons, Mr Tony Newton, moved to play down the row, saying:
``Members of the royal family have frequently shared platforms with members of
the Government.''
However, Mr Major was forced to respond after the princess's comments were
seized on at Commons questions by Labour's John McFall, who said she had
``highlighted the inadequacies of the present system'' for homeless youngsters.
The Prime Minister said: ``The Government has been dealing with this problem in
a comprehensive fashion for some time and has made remarkable improvements over
the last few years.
``The Government is providing around 5000 places in permanent and temporary
accommodation for people who otherwise would sleep rough.
``There has been a remarkable reduction in the number of people sleeping rough.
Plans to eliminate that entirely continue and I look forward to that day being
reached.
``We are fully committed to ensuring there is no necessity for some people to
sleep rough and we very much hope that the culture that has grown up among some
people of doing so is a culture that can change and be broken.''
q The Duchess of York said yesterday that she had dropped the idea of a
Christmas skiing holiday in Switzerland this year - so that her daughters could
spend more time with their father. The decision, which the duchess mentioned
during a charity engagement at Dorking, Surrey, adds to the prospect of a big
royal family get-together over the traditional Christmas break at Sandringham.

THREE men found shot dead on an isolated farm track could have been the victims
of a gangland ambush, police said last night.
The men were known criminals and appeared to have been lured to the area before
being ``executed''. The killings bore the hallmarks of a gangland vendetta,
possibly involving drugs.
Their bodies were discovered in Workhouse Lane, in Essex, by a farmer and a
friend as they went to feed pheasants.
Each man had been shot through the head at point-blank range.
All were from Essex and were identified as Patrick Tate, 37, of Gordon Road,
Basildon; Craig Rolfe, 26, of Calshot Avenue, Chafford Hundred, Grays; and
Anthony Tucker, 38, of High Road, Fobbing.
They were shot as they sat in a Range Rover in a tree-lined track, 300 yards
off a busy main road near Rettendon. Police have not ruled out the possibility
it was a ``professional hit''.
Detective Superintendent Ivan Dibley said: ``They are known to us as criminals
and certain lines of inquiry are taking place with that knowledge.''
The vehicle was parked in a spot popular with courting couples from Rettendon,
four miles from the home of schoolgirl Leah Betts who died last month after
taking one ecstasy tablet on her 18th birthday.
Over the past 20 years, criminals from the East End of London have been moving
into the Essex area, now believed to be a base for leading drug dealers.
Police believe it likely the victims drove there for a pre-arranged meeting.
A hole had been blasted through a window of the Range Rover, indicating that
the first person to die was shot by someone standing outside the vehicle.
Speaking at White House Farm near to where the bodies were found, Mr Dibley
added: ``I would say that whoever made an arrangement for this vehicle to be at
this isolated location, for whatever reason these three people drove down here,
I would say that they had some local knowledge of that lane.''
Home Office pathologist, Dr Paula Lannas, and a ballistics expert were called
in.
Mr Kenneth Jiggins, 47, a bricklayer, said he and Mr Peter Theobald, of White
House Farm, found the bodies.
He said the Range Rover was parked in front of a locked gate they needed to
pass through to get to the pheasants.
Mr Jiggins said: ``It was certainly not a shotgun that was involved. I would
think it would have to have been a rifle or a handgun.''
Police could not confirm that only one person was involved in the shootings.

LABOUR is not planning to raise taxes in the first term of a Scottish
parliament, Mr Tony Blair said yesterday, in a move designed to kill off the
electoral threat posed by the Tory ``tartan tax'' campaign.
The Labour leader also promised his party would not use the parliament's
discretionary tax powers unless the plans had been put first to the Scottish
electorate. ``Taxes will only go up if the people vote for them.''
However, he made clear he was not issuing a ``new constitutional prescription''
for the devolved parliament. The power to vary income tax, up or down, by 3p in
the pound, will be in the legislation for the assembly introduced in the first
year of a Labour government.
But he does expect Labour to put any proposed tax change to the Scottish
electorate. ``Parties that are going to raise tax have a political obligation:
if we intended to raise tax we would say so when we called the election,'' he
said.
In an exclusive interview with The Herald on the eve of his two-day visit to
Scotland, Mr Blair went on: ``There will be no tax raised at all unless the
party goes into an election promising it and succeeds. We have no plans to do
that, never mind anyone else.''
Taking stock - with evident confidence - of Labour's home rule plans, Mr Blair
offered the prospect of New Labour delivering a New Union with the rest of the
United Kingdom. ``A New Union is what Scotland and what Britain needs for a new
century.''
Mr Blair returned repeatedly to the ``tartan tax'' charge that the ``Tory lie
machine'' was attempting to pin on Labour. He claimed the whole Tory Government
had abandoned policy in favour of propaganda, and said Labour would ``come out
of its corner fighting'' against it.
``What we do from now is we counter the lies, we speak the truth, we make the
case, and we make it not just to the ordinary citizens of Scotland who get a
better democratic deal but we make it to business to show how they will get a
better deal,'' he said.
Of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth he said: ``He's not a Government
Minister, he's a propagandist for the Conservative Party, and that propaganda
is designed primarily to get up and running the same machine that was in
existence before the last election. I call it the Tory lie machine.''
Clearly the biggest ``lie'' that Mr Blair feels he must confront is Mr
Forsyth's claim a Scottish assembly today would mean a 3p in the pound rise in
income tax for every Scot tomorrow. ``The Tory lie that should be nailed is
this idea that the Scottish parliament means that your tax goes up. The
Scottish parliament means nothing of the sort. Taxes only go up if the people
vote for them,'' he said.
However, the Tories were last night sticking to their tartan tax claim. Mr
Major was reported as saying Scottish firms would be hit by higher wage demands
as a result of such a tax.
Mr Blair also accused the Scottish Secretary of abandoning support for the
constitutional status quo. ``He has been forced to admit that the status quo no
longer holds. I think that was a strategic move of enormous importance because
from that moment on the issue is no longer whether there's change but what type
of change.''
There is no doubt Mr Forsyth's tartan tax campaign has stung Labour. Mr Blair's
apparent determination to resist any devolved tax change before the first
assembly elections and his stated belief that any subsequent change should be
put to the electorate first confirms that impact.
As part of his national campaign to persuade business and industry of New
Labour's electability, Mr Blair arrives in Edinburgh today to address the
Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce. Tonight he will speak before a business audience
at a gala dinner in Glasgow.
Even before his arrival, the SNP had joined in the attack. Its chief executive,
Mr Michael Russell, claimed that by limiting the powers of the Scottish
parliament Labour would turn it into a ``pushover''.

THE local authority that lost its legal bid to destroy #27,000 worth of Lanark
Blue cheese was yesterday unrepentant, despite coming in for serious criticism
from the presiding sheriff.
Clydesdale District Council said Government guidelines had been followed to
protect consumers and it was regrettable that the court had not decided in its
favour.
The director of environmental health, Mr Duncan McDougall, said his staff would
continue to monitor cheese produced by Mr Humphrey Errington, of Dunsyre,
reputedly a favourite with the royal family.
Mr McDougall added: ``We will do this as a matter of routine as we would with
any other food manufacturer in our area.''
When asked about the costs now facing the council, estimated at up to #350,000,
he said: ``The councillors have all been given a copy of the sheriff's judgment
and will discuss it at the next full meeting (December 20).''
He would not comment further about Sheriff John Douglas Allan's criticism of
the department's handling of the case and his description of it as ``dogmatic,
confrontational, and combative''.
Earlier this week, the sheriff refused to grant Clydesdale an order to destroy
several tonnes of the deep-frozen cheese and declared the cheese was fit to eat.
The council claimed tests revealed the cheese was riddled with the food bug
listeria monocytogenes.
Clydesdale's food officers may find their hands are tied in future if they
discover other food products with the same listeria because of legal precedent
set by the Lanark Blue judgment.
Mr Errington said he was taking legal advice about suing the council for his
#120,000 costs in the Lanark Sheriff Court case.
He is also considering making a complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman
alleging maladministration by the council.
q The BBC could face legal action after breaking a sheriff's embargo forbidding
publication of his written judgment in the Lanark Blue cheese case.
BBC Scotland's Reporting Scotland programme on Wednesday evening carried
details of Sheriff Allan's ruling, despite a covering letter written by him
banning its use before midnight that night.
A spokesman for the BBC remained defiant about reporting the judgment.
He said the judgment was dated December 5 and therefore became a public
document at that time.

LABORATORY tests have invalidated the theory that cot deaths are caused by
toxic gases from plastic or fireproof mattress covers.
Scientists from the Public Health Laboratory Service in Bristol examined
mattresses involved in 23 sudden infant deaths and found only one trace of the
fungus suspected of producing the gases.
Their published report suggests the chemist who came up with the theory may
have mistaken bacteria commonly found in the environment for the fungus.
The chemist's theory and a television report last year fanned public fear about
the mattresses and worried parents worldwide, an editorial in the scientific
journal Lancet said.

ALL secondary school pupils should take part in more than one of the many forms
of dance, a report on physical education teaching and learning recommends. The
report from the Scottish Office schools inspectorate - endorsed by Scottish
Office Education Minister Raymond Robertson - says all pupils should have a
grounding in Scottish dancing.
It advises that teachers should make opportunities available for curricular and
extra-curricular sporting and dance activities to all secondary pupils.
It also urges teachers to recognise the potential of school sport for nurturing

Pupils can now take Standard Grade and Higher courses in PE and Mr Robertson
said sports helped schools identify their ethos, the characteristics which made
them effective.
``Physical education has a vital contribution to make to improving the nation's

<HEADLINE>UNITED THEY STAND Herald poll puts Scots businesses to the test on devolution</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE
CBI Scotland is to take a public stance on whether a Scottish Parliament will
be good or bad - following pressure from prominent members to
drop its neutral course on devolution.
Its views will be formally expressed once all political parties are questioned
on constitutional change, and after widespread consultation of the membership.
No timescale was given, but chairman Andrew Cubie insisted last night: ``If,
after the process is completed, we are satisfied the implications are
detrimental to business, we will say so.'' However, he confirmed any action
will fall short of an outright political campaign.
Mr Cubie, who stressed CBI Scotland was apolitical, was adamant that harmony
within the organisation was now ``absolute''.
The decision to evaluate the effects of a Scottish parliament on business,
competitiveness, and inward investment came within hours of yesterday's Herald
report that many top businessmen are furious at CBI Scotland's ``weak and
timid'' stance on devolution.
Several threatened to withdraw from the organisation unless arguments against
a
tax raising assembly, in particular, were taken on board by the organisation.
Mr Cubie emerged from the Scottish Council's monthly meeting to declare:
``There is no split.'' Director Iain McMillan added: ``We have been in touch
with leading members and they are at ease with the way we are progressing.''
Today, an exclusive Herald poll reveals that not one of the 25 top performing
companies in Scotland has declared they will move elsewhere.
The poll strips their anonymity over attitudes to a Scottish parliament. It
has
been claimed that up to 15 leading companies would ``quit Scotland'' if the
promised Labour-Liberal Democrat parliament with tax raising powers came to
pass.
But these firms have never been named - and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce
has dismissed talk of companies pulling out if devolution was introduced as
``pure humbug.''
However, CBI Scotland is now acting over an alleged clamour among prominent
members to drop its ``bland, neutral'' line.
In a statement, it said political parties would be questioned on their
proposals for ``the governance of Scotland;'' effects of change will be
evaluated, and members' consulted.
``All these contributions will be benchmarked against the clearly-defined CBI
objectives and, at the appropriate time, a CBI statement will be contributed
to
the debate.''
Labour and the Liberal-Democrats, architects of an assembly with tax raising
powers, believe the warnings of revolt were stage managed by members who also
support the Tory Party and the Union.
However, the so-called rebels will also be happy because the CBI must now take
a firm line on devolution. They include members of the Tory Party, whose
leadership is urging businessmen to protect the Union.
Mr Bill Hughes, chairman of Grampian Holdings, yesterday confirmed his board
will consider withdrawing from the CBI unless business interests are
represented. He was confident the organisation will not now ``chicken out''
over devolution.
Lord Goold, chairman of building group McTaggart and Mickel, earlier confirmed
his board will withdraw CBI subscriptions unless its neutral stance was
abandoned.
The Herald's straw poll, which insisted a veil of secrecy be lifted, produced
many a bullish response - but not one public declaration that Scotland would
be
abandoned for pastures new.
Scottish and Newcastle and the Weir Group were the most antagonistic of all
towards a tax-raising Assembly.
Lord Weir, chairman of the Weir Group, said the proposals for a Scottish
parliament were poorly thought out and a recipe for rancour and dissension.

t
A SENIOR doctor, the second this week, has announced his resignation from a NHS
management post in protest at policies which he claims are starving the
hospital service of funds.
Mr Christopher Adams, a consultant neurosurgeon at the Radcliffe Infirmary in
Oxford, describes in the British Medical Journal how he quit as head of his
department when his unit was forced to drop clinical standards to meet the
demands being made on it.
They found themselves having to perform ``day case'' brain surgery, carrying
out craniotomies before returning patients in waiting ambulances to their
referring hospitals because there were not enough beds at the Radcliffe.
His comments follow the resignation on Wednesday of Professor Richard Olver as
vice-chairman of Tayside Health Board in protest at the management style of the
board and the draining of resources from the hospital service.
Yesterday, Professor Olver, 54, said: ``The gap between rhetoric and reality
has become too much for me.
``(Health) spending in the UK is less as a proportion of GDP than almost any
other developed country.''
Meanwhile, the second doctor to resign, Mr Adams, said his unit had been
penalised for being one of the most efficient in the NHS, increasing the number
of neurosurgical procedures from 600 in 1972 to 2500 last year.
It was the cheapest in the country - with an average cost of #1994 per case
compared with #3124 for England as a whole - with no waiting list.
However, the facilities available put them well below the generally recognised
minimum levels for safe neurosurgery. They were, as he put it, hyperefficient.
However, instead of being given more resources, they were asked to make annual
efficiency savings of 3% demanded by the Department of Health.
This was used to reduce the price to purchasers, which resulted in more
patients being referred. Income from private patients, which the surgeons had
hoped would be spent on expansion of their department to meet the growing
demands, was used instead to meet the 3% savings.
``We have had to introduce waiting lists, morale has slumped, and the service
deteriorated. If we had gone on like this, we would have ended up as an
emergency-only service,'' he said. Eventually the consultants had to relieve
the pressure the only way they could, by stopping private work.

<HEADLINE>Dounreay faces prosecution for workers' contamination</HEADLINE>

A GOVERNMENT regulatory body is preparing a report for the procurator-fiscal in
Wick that could lead to Dounreay being prosecuted following the radiation
contamination last summer of five workers employed by a private contractor to
help clear up the plant's controversial low-level nuclear waste pits.
Last week HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate reported to the Dounreay local
liaison committee that it was investigating the case of two men who had
received radiation doses of up to 10 times those normally expected for Dounreay
workers. It said it was taking matters further and conceded that prosecution
was possible.
Shortly afterwards the number of men involved was revised upwards to four, and
it emerged yesterday that there was a fifth man. But a Dounreay spokesman said
yesterday that while a fifth man had been surveyed, the dose he received was
well below the level of concern.
A spokesman for the NII, however, told The Herald last night: ``I have been
informed by our site inspector at Dounreay that there is a fifth man and we
will be citing him in the report we are currently preparing for the fiscal,
because although the dosage is very low, our concerns have been over the
management of the project rather than the dose levels.''
The procurator-fiscal in Wick, Mr Alasdair MacDonald, said yesterday that the
NII had alerted him to its investigations.
The five men concerned all worked for Thurso-based Probabilistic Risk
Assessment, one of the first companies hired under compulsory competitive
tendering to work with nuclear waste at the plant.
They were employed to help with the remedial work going on at the plant's
low-level waste pits, recovering old drums that had been left to rust and
compacting them for disposal within new drums.
Dounreay this week issued a statement to its workforce confirming that four men
had ingested radioactive dust: ``Of the four employees of Probabilistic Risk
Assessment, one had an intake resulting in a whole-body radiation dose of about
10mSv. The remaining three had significantly lower intakes and radiation doses.
``To put this into context, the legal maximum annual whole-body radiation dose
is 50mSv. The self-imposed UKAEA limit is 20mSv; and the range of dose to
Dounreay radiation workers in recent years has been 1-10mSv.
``Dounreay's own investigation into the incidents is nearing completion. It
will be trying to answer three main questions:
Was the radiation dose to the men, during the course of their work, being
properly measured and speedily assessed and acted upon?
Were those responsible for maintaining a safe working environment adequately
monitoring the job? Was the equipment provided for such things as ventilation,
handling and protective clothing adequate for the job?''
The Caithness plant is also drawing up plans for the removal of 4500 tonnes of
topsoil from around the top of the waste shaft, which suffered an explosion in
1977 and has often been suggested as a possible source of the spots of
radioactive contamination found around the plant in the past 18 months.
Meanwhile management has also written to Greenpeace taking issue with a news
release stating that if Dounreay wins a contract to reprocess foreign research
reactor fuel, waste would stay at Dounreay while vitrified waste from
Sellafield was sent back to America.
The Atomic Energy Authority spokesman at Dounreay, Mr Ian Shepherd, wrote
saying they had misunderstood the position. Substitution could only take place,
he told Greenpeace, if a national nuclear waste repository had been established.

A YOUTH who sold ecstasy and was allowed his freedom by one of Scotland's
leading judges began a four-year sentence yesterday after a successful Crown
appeal.
Three judges in the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled Lord McCluskey had been
wrong to defer sentence for two years on 19-year-old Paul Lee.
Lee had been caught after selling ecstasy outside an Ayrshire disco.
About a month before Lee's arrest, someone had died at the disco after taking
ecstasy.
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, stressed that the court had a duty to the
public to impose a custodial sentence in a case such as this.
Dealing with the deferred sentence, Lord Hope said: ``It is contrary to the
sentencing policy which this court has felt itself obliged to follow in the
public interest to deter and punish those who engage in the supply to others of
class A drugs, especially to young people frequenting a disco.
``This is the only way the court can fulfil its responsibility to the public in
these cases.
``It must be brought home to those who engage in this activity for their own
gain, or who may be tempted to do so, that it is an activity which may bring
about a risk of serious damage and even death to those who consume those drugs.
``It follows that the court has to deal severely with these cases and normally
a custodial sentence will be inevitable.''
Lee, of Greenhill Crescent, Paisley, appeared at the High Court in Kilmarnock
in September this year and admitted being concerned in the supply of ecstasy on
January 22.
The court was told police went to the Metro disco in Saltcoats after an
anonymous tip-off and caught Lee after he ran away. He had #590 in cash and 19
ecstasy tablets on him. He admitted he had been selling the tablets at #10
each. Lord McCluskey decided to defer sentence on Lee, a first offender, for
two years. Mr Paul McBride, for the Crown, yesterday argued that it was
inappropriate to defer sentence in a case like this.
Mr McBride said that in his report to the appeal court Lord McCluskey had
stated that deterrent sentences had no significant effect on crime levels and
that rehabilitation was not realistic in the Scottish penal system.
The judge said he was aware that Young Offenders' Insitutions had a very high
rate of re-offending.
Mr McBride submitted that Lord McCluskey had produced a series of observations
about custodial sentences and appeared to be suggesting that such sentences
should never be imposed.
Lord Hope promised a considered response in due course to the comments Lord
McCluskey had made in his report to the appeal court.
The appeal court had made it clear that severe sentences would normally be
imposed unless there were strong mitigating features.
Mr Martin Jones, defence counsel, argued that Lord McCluskey had not ruled out
the possibility of a custodial sentence, but postponed that question by
deferring sentence on a young first offender who had a job and appreciated how
foolish he had been.

THE secret of retaining mental agility in old age is daily mental exercise,
such as listening to news bulletins, doing puzzles, and filling in forms, a
medical expert said yesterday.
Dr David Weeks of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, a clinical neuro psychologist,
writes in the magazine She that another factor is having friends of all ages.
He has studied the habits of 3500 men and women who looked between 12 to 14
years younger than their age.
People of advancing years, while feeling younger, admitted to testing
themselves intellectually, and retaining a sense of fun and curiosity.
In contrast, he said, those who believed that growing old meant losing mental
agility were more likely to see their prophesy come true.
Dr Weeks also observed that many people living longer and looking younger were
spurred into changing their lifestyle after losing someone close.

THE governor of Barlinnie prison in Glasgow has ordered an inquiry into how two
prisoners were able to escape while returning from a supervised visit to a
local swimming pool.
The two men, who are not considered to be dangerous to members of the public,
managed to slip away from guards yards from the prison gates.
Steven Naylor, 23, and a second man who cannot be named for legal reasons, were
both low risk, D-category prisoners who carried out domestic duties at the
maximum security jail.
They were in a group of about six other prisoners allowed the use of the
swimming pool at nearby Smithycroft Secondary School.
After finishing a supervised closed session at the pool on Wednesday night, the
two men ran off.
A spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service said the guards followed
instructions not to chase escapers and radioed for help.
``The prison governor has ordered an investigation into the circumstances of
the escape,'' said the spokesman.
Naylor, from Airdrie, was given a three-and-a-half year sentence at the town's
Sheriff Court in November last year.
The other man was a convicted prisoner facing outstanding charges. Strathclyde
Police have been informed and are investigating.

DARIUS Guppy, disgraced friend of Earl Spencer, was freed on bail yesterday
after being given leave to appeal against a jail term for refusing to pay
compensation for a bogus gems robbery.
Mr Justice May, at the High Court, allowed bail on condition of a #200,000
surety and that he stay at his home address.
Mr Spenser Hilliard, Guppy's counsel, said after the hearing that Guppy had
finished his five-year sentence for staging the bogus robbery but was now
appealing against a three-year sentence for failing to comply with a
compensation order.
In April, Guppy lost his appeal against the five-year sentence but fines of
#539,000 were cut to #227,000 and converted into a compensation order in
favour
of Lloyd's insurers who were defrauded when they paid up #1.8m for the bogus
gems robbery.
Guppy was told to pay the money within three months or serve the extra three
years.
Guppy, 30, of Notting Hill, was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court in March
1993 for conspiracies to defraud, steal, and commit false accounting and VAT
offences.
In 1990, the Old Etonian who was best man to Earl Spencer at his wedding,
conned insurers for compensation after faking an armed robbery of a #1.8m
jewellery collection in a New York hotel room. His business associate,
Benedict
Marsh, was jailed for five years and similarly fined.
They paid Peter Risdon, an acquaintance, #10,000 to stage a bogus raid,
stealing gems from their hotel safe and leaving them tied up on their beds.
Last April, the judge said he believed Guppy still had access to ``ill-gotten
gains''

<TEXT>
PLANS to improve piers and harbours in the Highlands and Islands have been
threatened by the Scottish Office, a Highland councillor claimed.
In a letter from the Scottish Office, the council has been told that harbour
grants under the Fisheries Act 1955 have been stopped, and unless applications
were in before November 28, no further money would be granted under this
scheme.
According to North-West Sutherland councillor Francis Keith, this will have
serious effects on projects throughout the North.
``In Kinlochbervie, we were planning to deepen the entrance to the harbour at a
total cost of #750,000,'' he said.
``The withdrawal of the grant means we cannot go ahead. That means we cannot
induce foreign fishing vessels to land at Kinlochbervie, and that is serious.''
The effects could be wider. There are fears that ERDF funding for piers could
also be affected.
``This could also affect some transport piers,'' said Councillor Keith. ``It
will be of concern to all the harbour trusts around the coast.''
The position is equally serious in the Western Isles. According to Mr Duncan
MacInnes, secretary of the Western Isles Fishermen's Association, a study that
has been under way on fishery piers will now be useless and deterioration of
facilities is inevitable.

THE IRA said last night it would not surrender its weapons.
The announcement came hours after it was confirmed the international
commission, set up to examine ways of decommissioning terrorist weapons, was to
have its first meeting in New York at the weekend, with sessions in Belfast and
Dublin next week.
In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA said there was ``no question'' of it
meeting ``the ludicrous demand for a surrender of IRA weapons either through
the front door or the back door''.
It added: ``British bad faith and Unionist intransigence has raised a huge
question mark over the potential of the twin-track approach.''
The ``twin track'' policy of a commission to look at arms and exploratory talks
between the British and Irish governments with the local political parties was
agreed by Mr Major and Irish Premier John Bruton on the eve of the visit by
President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE>City plans for GPs' medical night centres New network designed to cope with increasing out-of-hours workload</HEADLINE>

A NETWORK of overnight medical centres where patients can be seen by GPs is
expected to be up and running in Greater Glasgow early in the New Year.
It will be the first development in the UK on such a scale - covering more than
900,000 patients - since the Government put up #45m to meet the cost as part of
the out-of-hours settlement with GPs earlier this year.
There are expected to be six or seven centres spread around the city, each
manned by two doctors and support staff.
However Dr Kenneth Harden, chairman of the Glasgow Local Medical Committee,
said yesterday that patients for whom it was clinically necessary would still
be able to get a home visit.
These would be provided by the existing deputising services used by many
practices, or by GPs who had opted to continue doing their own night calls. The
LMC is also negotiating with the Scottish Ambulance Service to provide
transport for patients who would have difficulty reaching one of the centres.
This would use the Patient Transport Service ambulances which provide
non-emergency transport during the day, and lie unused at night.
Dr Harden said the out-of-hours workload had doubled over the past four years,
and GPs had been finding it increasingly difficult to provide a high-quality
service.
It was not intended as a substitute for hospital accident departments, which
had X-ray and other facilities for dealing with trauma.
``It will clearly not be a drop-in centre. The telephone number will be
publicised and people will be expected to phone in first. We hope it will not
be abused - if people come in with non-urgent things then urgent cases may not
get the care they need when they need it,'' he said.
The centres will not be new-build but will be located in existing premises -
Stobhill Hospital and Victoria Infirmary have expressed an interest in
accommodating them and it is intended to locate one in Drumchapel.
Scotland's share of the #45m is #4.9m, of which Greater Glasgow gets #877,000.
The service has to be in place by April next year to benefit from the money and
a similar sum will be available the following year.
``We hope it will be ongoing,'' said Dr Harden.
The money will be used to staff the centres and pay for the patient transfer
service and communications support - including a fax link so that GPs will know
the following morning what had been happening to their patients through the
night.
However, the salary of the doctors themselves will be met by GPs subscribing to
the overnight centres, since they are still responsible for their patients.
Dr Barbara West, the LMC secretary, said research had shown that one centre for
50,000 patients - the ratio previously favoured - was not a very efficient use
of resources, and that one per 150,000 would be the most efficient.
``There is a real recruitment crisis in general practice and one of the reasons
cited by young doctors is the need to be on call at night and do their job
during the day.
``Having looked at the workload we think that each could be safely and
effectively staffed by two doctors and a nurse, with trained telephone
operators and a security presence. Research has shown that in an area of
150,000 people, night calls before midnight average 10 every hour, and after
midnight 2.5 per hour,'' she said.
Mr Danny Crawford, chief officer of Glasgow Local Health Council, said: ``We
would want to be assured that this does not mean a reduction in cover for the
public out-of-hours. When this was first mooted it was in the context of
possible acute hospital closures. I hope that is off the agenda.'

A MAN accused of drugging and murdering a secretary was seen with her on a
street videotape hours earlier, a court heard yesterday.
Constable William Wilson, 46, said Mr Richard Karling, 43, was filmed meeting
33-year-old Miss Dorothy Niven.
The tape, screened at the High Court in Glasgow, allegedly showed Miss Niven
being helped from the Pancake Place restaurant, in Union Street, by a woman an
hour later. Next day, she was found dead in bed.
Mr Karling, of Bellview Crescent, Ayr, denies that on June 27 last, in the
Pancake Place, he administered Temazepam to Miss Niven, and took her in a taxi
to her home in Busby, where he forced her face into a pillow and murdered her.
He has lodged special defences of incrimination and alibi.
Miss Lyn Harley, 31, of Cochrane Street, Bellshill, said she worked beside Miss
Niven at the Students' Loan Company. She said Miss Niven told her she had taken
out an interdict against Mr Karling, to prevent him from following and phoning
her after they split up.
Paramedics told Mr William Totten, prosecuting, they were called to the house
at Busby on the afternoon of June 28 and were met by Mr Karling.
Mr Douglas Shepherd, 36, said the woman was face-down on the bed and had been
dead for some time. He said: ``Her neck was bent back at an unnatural angle.''
Mr Alexander Lochrie, 37, said Mr Karling told him he had been Miss Niven's
boyfriend for seven years and that she was a diabetic.
He said Mr Karling told him the woman had become ill at a restaurant the
previous day.
The trial continues.

SCOTLAND'S top performing company, Standard Life, depicted at the last election
as active campaigners against devolution, is adamant its position was much
mis-reported. But clearly concerns still exist. These are the responses from
the leading 25 firms, in running order, on being asked their views on the
formation of a Scottish parliament:
Standard Life: In recent months has spoken to all political parties and told
them again of the sensitivities of the financial services sector in particular
to constitutional change.
``We think there is now a greater understanding of our continuing concerns on
the impact of devolution - especially in terms of the likely ensuing
uncertainty - on our business,'' said Mr Scott Bell, group managing director.
2. Royal Bank of Scotland: No comment.
3. Scottish Widows: ``Our stance is clear. Our over-riding priority is to
protect the interests of policyholders.
``Any assessment of the impact of constitutional change is bound to be
hypothetical at the present time. However, if it were to come about, with a
consequent impact on policyholders' investments, we would respond to the
situation accordingly.
``In terms of future growth, we recognise our main market will continue to be
England for a long time. We believe our contribution to the economy of Scotland
is important, and trust constitutional change would not result in that
situation being jeopardised.
``In the meantime, we must recognise that uncertainty in our long term business
is undesirable both for existing clients and prospective ones.''
4. General Accident: Awaiting details of the form a Scottish Parliament will
take, the firm pointed out it operates under a range of political systems and
Governments in over 40 countries.
``However, the company recognises shareholders' interests are paramount and
therefore if any future Scottish constitution meant that General Accident was
disadvantaged against its competitors based in England, the board would need to
review the position.''
5. ScottishPower: ``We will clearly work with any system set up by a democratic
elected Government. However, we would emphasise the over-riding need for any
new system to avoid harming the competitive ability of Scottish-based companies
by imposing any extra tax burden.''
6. Bank of Scotland: No comment.
7. United Distillers: No comment.
8. Scottish Amicable: ``Our interests are those of our shareholders. We are
keeping close contact with all the parties to ensure their interests are
understood,'' said head of strategic marketing Brendan Llewellyn.
``In particular it is important to us that the personal and corporate taxation
regime does not disadvantage Scottish based companies trading in   the UK.''
9. Scottish and Newcastle: See report opposite.
10. Scottish Equitable: ``If anything happened that jeopardised our existing or
new customers, we would take whatever action necessary to protect our
position,'' said marketing director Graeme Dumble. ``Our success in the last 10
years is based on taking a pragmatic business view. We must satisfy customer
requirements, and if any moves in terms of the Scottish situation called that
into question then we would take action . . .
``It would cause concern if some of our English-based competitors saw
advantages by knocking us for not being English-based.
``Such a perception from our customer base would be a big issue for us. It
would not do to be put at a disadvantage in an already competitive market. We
have a responsibility to staff, customers, and shareholders to protect their
position.''
11. Scottish Provident: ``We see real value in having some Scottish affairs
debated and decided by Scots who, as I understand it, would be represented by
some form of proportional representation.
``However, there is one area where we have reservations,'' said group managing
director David Woods. ``It would be of concern if the parliament has powers to
raise tax, or to alter rates of tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK.
``This could be used by our competitors to damage our business. Most of our
competitors are based outside Scotland, as are the majority of our customers -
some 85%-90%.
``Whether real or not, these competitors could say to people: `Why put your
money with a Scottish company over a period of 20-25 years when the tax raising
powers could be different in five years' time?'.
``But I think Scottish life companies have an established record in particular
in producing good returns to all their policyholders in England as well as
Scotland.
``It is up to the industry in Scotland to make proper representations to those
who are elected. No-one would want to take actions that would precipitate the
demise of a strong Scottish industry, and one of the biggest employers.''
12. Scottish Hydro-Electric: ``This is essentially a matter for the Scottish
people, but from a business point of view Hydro-Electric would certainly not
want to be disadvantaged from having its headquarters in Scotland.''
13. Seagram Distillers: No comment.
14. Scottish Life: Following talks with Labour's economics spokesman Alistair
Darling, the company is ``much more relaxed about the devolution proposals than
four years ago, when many questions remained unanswered.''
Mr Jim Gilchrist, director and general manager, sales and marketing, added:
``Our conversations suggest there will be no corporate tax implications.
Provided there is no effect on our business, there is no reason to take a
negative attitude.''
15. Clydesdale Bank: Devolution will be good, if there is a clear financial
advantage to Scotland and puts more money into the pockets of Scots, according
to a spokesman. But that argument had not been made as yet.
16. Christian Salvesen: No comment.
17. John Menzies: No comment.
18. Compaq: No comment.
19. Scottish Nuclear: ``We have been watching the situation with interest . . .
we share some of the concerns which have been raised, but need to fully
understand the implications of change for our business before arising at any
decision.''
20. Weir Group: ``The proposals are poorly thought out; will produce very
difficult political consequences, and are objectionable on many grounds,''
declared Lord Weir, chairman.
Politically, they neither addressed the question of why Scottish MPs should
have a say in English domestic legislation while English MPs have none in
Scottish legislation.
Nor did they address why - with a significant transfer of political power to
Edinburgh - disproportionate Scottish representation in Westminster can
continue to be justified.
``In this situation, it is hard to see why English MPs will continue to agree
to the favourable financial treatment Scotland currently enjoys.
``All this will be a recipe for rancour and dissension, particularly if
different parties are in power in Edinburgh and Westminster, and may be the
start of the `slippery slope' towards independence and to minor country status.
``In financial terms, the Tartan Tax will not go up or down as Mr Blair
pretends. It will go up. We will be expensively overgoverned as a consequence,
and overgoverned by people who still hold to the tradition that extra
expenditure is the answer to all public ills.
``Scotland will be a less attractive place both for companies with
international businesses and for investors from abroad.''
21. Allied Distillers: ``We support bringing decision making closer to the
people. We also hope a Scottish parliament would bring a greater understanding
of our industry's needs in terms of competition worldwide. The downside would
be an additional tax on the people. We would want it to benefit Scotland,
rather than fund a new legislature,'' said trades relations director John
Campbell.
22. TSB: ``It is not our policy to take positions on specific political issues.
If legislation was proposed we would consider the Bill very carefully. The
impact on taxation would be the important element.''
23. Scottish Mutual Assurance: ``We have safeguarded 1000 jobs, created 300
more, and are extremely happy where we are,'' said director of strategy Ian
Gilmore.
``As a result of speaking to politicians, we are quite confident we have
nothing to fear. We understand there is no intention of pursuing corporate tax
raising powers.''
24. Cummins Engine Company: ``A key role for the proposed Scottish parliament
should be to further develop the large investment in Scottish industry from
leading multinational companies, helping to create an attractive and successful
business environment.''
25. Low and Bonar: No comment.

Customer service supervisor, David Parker, said: ``The eye was found in the
London-Inverness train and was claimed later. But the wooden leg, which was
actually left propped up against the station concourse seats, has never been

THE CHAIRMAN of Scotland's biggest manufacturing company has warned a Scottish
parliament with tax raising powers will damage individual businesses and, above
all, inward investment.
Sir Alick Rankin, of S &amp; N, fears an opportunity to make Scotland wealthier,
more successful - and a more attractive place in which to work and live - will
be missed because of the threats to personal taxation.
Sir Alick also suspects the policies of a Labour-inspired solution to
devolution will result in a manifesto not only leading to higher taxes but
increased public expenditure, higher interest rates, and inflation.
He also spoke of the brewing and leisure group's concerns over the firm's
ability to continue a recruitment strategy which for many years has brought
high quality, skilled executives to the head office and subsidiary companies in
Scotland.
But he stressed the company, which employs 51,000, is intensely proud of being
Scottish and would never be a party to irresponsible threats to move operations
outwith Scotland, should home rule materialise.
``That is not our way. The voters will decide these matters,'' he said. ``But
we will argue for what is in the interests of business and enterprise in
Scotland.'' In response to our poll question on company attitudes to the
formation of a Scottish parliament, Sir Alick said:
``Like many other businesses, our general viewpoint is related to concerns
surrounding personal taxation threats which we believe to be damaging to
businesses and above all to inward investment.
``In that context, it seems to me that if there is to be a Scottish parliament
or devolution, it is an opportunity to make Scotland wealthier, more successful
- rather than an opportunity to make it as less attractive place in which to
live and work.
``If policies of a Labour-inspired solution to devolution result in a manifesto
which threatens higher taxation, an opportunity will have been lost to make
Scottish more prosperous.
``S &amp; N has for years been recruiting high quality, skilled executives into
Scotland to manage the policy strategy, functions and services.
``These people, recruited from England and Western Europe, will be unlikely to
come and relocate in Scotland under circumstances threatened by the
devolutionary situation. It is just not sensible to believe they would live and
work here.
``This company would be unlikely to find the same high calibre and quality of
external advisers locally, and would have to look for these advisers and
services from south of the Border, probably London. I am talking about advisers
and skills - corporate finance, legal, marketing, advertising, consultancy,
press relations, corporate affairs.
``I believe inward investment would be seriously disadvantaged after past
decades of successfully persuading foreign companies into Scotland. I believe
that Scotland would be a second line opportunity under these circumstances.
They would go to the North-east of England, Ireland, and other countries, in
particular if they wish to have a European Community base.
``Scotland, under better taxation circumstances, would be an obvious
opportunity for them. I think this would be damaged.''
Sir Alick went on: ``We in industry have clear memories of the very high burden
of local authority tax which it paid through the business rate in past years.
``I believe the politicians in a Scottish parliament would often be the same
people who were councillors in these local authorities which believed in heavy
taxation of business. I fear their memories would be short.
``All too often industrial companies paid out three times the local authority
rate as was paid in England.''
``In more general terms, I am nervous that the philosophies of wealth creation
and free enterprise will come a poor second to the inclination to increase
public expenditure; operate on higher interest rates, and under circumstances -
inevitably - of higher inflation.
``In general, industry needs more deregulation, less intervention from
parliaments, and fewer tiers of Government - not more.
``We are not in favour of the break-up of the Union and of the UK into what
would be inevitably smaller and less influential entities. These are issues
which big companies do face.''

OPPONENTS laid down an ``unwelcome'' mat last night for the arrival of Labour
leader Tony Blair in Scotland today, with a barrage of questions and criticisms
of his taxation and devolution plans.
Scottish Conservative chairman Sir Michael Hirst led the fray, writing to Mr
Blair with a series of questions about the ``tartan tax''; the Scottish Liberal
Democrats accused Labour of being spineless on tax cuts; and the SNP
highlighted Mr Blair's ``Tory'' views on education, taxes, and VAT on fuel.
SNP leader Alex Salmond also challenged Mr Blair over his refusal to answer a
series of letters on the issue of the sovereignty of the Scottish people and
the Claim of Right signed by Labour MPs, which contrasted with the traditional
view of Westminster sovereignty and proved that ``on the Scottish question, New
Labour can't be trusted an inch''.
Last night Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson countered criticisms of
the decision to abstain on Conservative tax cuts this week. ``Labour did not
oppose the tax cuts because we believe that after enduring Tory tax increases
amounting to over #800 since 1992, families have had enough of this burden.
``Labour did not support the tax cut because it would not have been our
priority - that would have been to reduce VAT on fuel. As for the Conservative
letter, this is a pretty desperate spoiling tactic from Sir Michael Hirst,
designed to upstage Tony Blair's visit.''
Sir Michael was joined by Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch in asking Mr
Blair:
q How would the leader of a Scottish parliament compete with a Welsh Secretary
for inward investment if there was an income tax differential?
q How did he justify a regressive tax which would hit the lower paid harder?
q How would he resolve the ``administrative nightmare'' for companies trading
and those working on both sides of the Border?
q Having backtracked on English assemblies, would he now reconsider the
``tartan tax''?
SLD leader Jim Wallace, addressing his party executive in Perth today, will
deliver an attack on Labour's ``spineless connivance in Tory tax cuts''. He
said Monday's Scottish Grand Committee meeting in Edinburgh would be a
``charade showing more clearly than ever how little say the Scottish people
have in determining Scotland's political priorities.''
He asks: ``How can Labour be trusted to promote education in Government when
they are so spineless in its defence in opposition?'' and adds: ``By sitting on
the fence on the Government's shameless tax bribes, Labour has done itself and
the people of Scotland a disservice.``
Mr Salmond said: ``Blair comes to Scotland with a policy platform which is
virtually identical to the Tories. On social policy, economic policy,
education, and training, it's becoming increasingly hard to tell the
difference. Scotland needs an alternative to the Tories, not a substitute.''

<HEADLINE>A74 upgrade and M6 link by millennium Forsyth seeks private #190m for work</HEADLINE>

FOUR consortia are to be asked to tender for a #190m private finance project to
upgrade the A74 to motorway by the year 2000 and complete the M6 Border link.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said yesterday the Road Management Group, UK
Highways, Border Highways, and Autolink Concessionaires would soon be
approached to bid for the ``vital and innovative project''.
The announcement was welcomed by the AA. A spokesman said: ``It appears that
the Government will keep its promise of completing the A74 to motorway by the
year 2000. It is also sensible that they have included the missing link south
of the Border.
``We are happy to see private finance schemes. It is early days but we are
hopeful that they will work well. The sooner the decision is made the better.''
Mr Forsyth said there were two significant construction schemes in the contract
as well as the operation and maintenance of the motorway from Carlisle to
Millbank.
The construction elements are the 18-mile section in Scotland from Paddy's
Rickle Bridge to Cleuchbrae and the upgrading of 5!s miles of the A74 in
England between the Border and Carlisle (Junction 44). Work should start
towards the end of 1996.
Mr Forsyth said: ``Private finance has found a way to ensure that these vital
schemes are taken forward together in the fastest possible timetable.
``The M6/A74 is Scotland's principal export route and therefore of key
importance to all sectors of our economy. Its upgrade has been the strategic
priority of our trunk road programme for the past decade.
``I am also delighted to welcome the agreement between the Scottish Office and
the Department of Transport which will allow the upgrading of the section
immediately south of the Scottish Border to be included in the tender
competition.
``This itself is another innovation and is made possible by the use of private
finance. Each department will pay its share of the total costs.''
The contract will take the form of design, build, finance, and operate and will
be the first time a DBFO contract has been used in Scotland.
In a DBFO contract, the contractor undertakes the design and construction of
the road and to raise the finance, and takes responsibility for the operation
and maintenance of the new road for the contract period.
In return, the contractor receives periodic payments or ``shadow tolls'' from
the Government based on traffic levels.
The group members of the four consortia are:
q Road Management Group - Amec, Brown and Root, Alfred McAlpine, Dragados, and
Morrison;
q UK Highways - John Laing, Tarmac, Welsh Water, and Transroute International;
q Border Highways - BICC, Trafalgar House Corporate Developments, and Connect
Roads;
q Autolink Concessionaires - Amey Holdings, Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, and Taylor
Woodrow Civil Engineering Ltd.
Meanwhile, Mr Forsyth has given approval for the 5.3km dual carriageway A96
Blackburn by-pass to ease congestion in the Grampian town.
Mr Forsyth said: ``The A96 remains one of the Government's highest priorities.
I expect to confirm the start date for construction at an early opportunity.''
The decision follows the public inquiry held in April, 1994.
q A public exhibition of the proposals for the M6 between Carlisle and Guards
Mill will be held at the Metal Bridge Inn, Blackford, Carlisle, on Friday,
December 15, and Saturday, December 16.

THE Crown Office and Scotland's top police officers are set to meet and discuss
when criminal law should be applied to footballers involved in on-field
incidents, it emerged yesterday.
The planned talks between Crown Office officials and representatives of the
Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) could result in the
formation of a comprehensive legal strategy towards such incidents, covering
all professional and amateur sports.
The news came a day after the Crown Office confirmed that four Rangers and
Aberdeen footballers were not to be prosecuted following police investigations
into incidents during a match between the clubs in Glasgow last month.
The talks move was revealed in a reply from the Lord Advocate, Donald Mackay,
Scotland's most senior law officer, to Labour MP Brian Wilson, who has been
pressing for guidelines to be issued to procurators fiscal.
Mr Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North and parliamentary adviser to the Scottish
Professional Footballers Association, had stressed the urgent need for
consistency of approach among procurators fiscal and criticised as
``unhelpful'' the view that any action which might be an offence if committed
in the street could also result in prosecution if it took place on the football
field.
In his reply, the recently-appointed Lord Advocate said it was likely that
discussions would take place ``in the near future'' between Crown Office
officials and representatives of ACPOS.
Mr Wilson welcomed the Lord Advocate's response as an indication that ``serious
thought'' was being given to the issue of how far criminal law should be used
in matters previously thought to be for football itself.
He said: ``We need an end to this lottery, in which a fiscal watches a game
which happens to be on television and decides to order a police investigation.''
The secretary of the Scottish PFA, Mr Tony Higgins, also welcomed the Lord
Advocate's intention to consider how the law should be applied to all sports.
He said: ``We will be very happy to be involved in his consultations but I
would urge him to move quickly.''
q.Mr Dennis Canavan MP, convener of the all-party Scottish Sports Committee in
the House of Commons, is also due to meet the Lord Advocate and Solicitor
General Paul Cullen on Tuesday, along with a delegation from the committee, to
discuss the role of procurators fiscal in sporting events.

FORMER Hibs chairman Kenny Waugh was fined #25,000 yesterday for a five-year
tax fraud.
He admitted the #80,000 fraud, which involved giving his employees tax-free
bonuses for five years.
The former Edinburgh bookmaker earlier had pled guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff
Court to defrauding the Inland Revenue of #80,000 between August 1987 and
August 1992.
Sheriff Iain Macphail told Waugh that such a deliberate and persistent fraud
would normally mean jail. However, there were a number of mitigating factors,
including Waugh's age and poor health and the fact that the case has been
hanging over him for three years.
The sheriff said he also took into account the fact that Waugh, 58, was a first
offender and that he had always admitted the fraud.
He allowed Waugh six months to pay the fine and afterwards Waugh, who is
retired, said: ``Naturally, I am glad it is all over. As the sheriff pointed
out, the delay of three years and two months was tremendous stress.''
Mr Gordon Jackson QC, defending, told Sheriff Macphail that Waugh had not
benefited from the fraud himself but depute-fiscal Neil Allan said the Crown
took issue with that. Mr Allan said he failed to make the tax deductions, so it
was up to him to come up with the money.
``By his deliberate and calculated fraudulent actions he avoided a personal
liability to pay #80,000,'' he added.
Mr Jackson said that it would have been different if Waugh had made the
deductions and kept the cash but he did not make deductions and never actually
had the money.
At an earlier hearing, depute-fiscal Vicky Roger told the sheriff that the
fraud was very simple.
Waugh, of Glenlockhart Bank, Edinburgh, had a system whereby most of his
betting shop employees got an untaxed bonus each week.
``Normal wages were taxed under PAYE but no deductions were made from the cash
supplements,'' said Miss Roger.
Waugh started his business in 1963 and built it up into a successful firm.
During the time of the offence, he had between 11 and 17 branches and employed
a fairly large number of people.
Waugh got into the way of giving bonuses. If a betting shop had a good week,
the manager could take a bonus himself and pay one to other staff.
When it started it was not regular but, said Mr Jackson, it went on for so long
that it started to feel like an entitlement.
Waugh had to take 18 months off because of a serious illness and, during that
time, his managers continued to pay the bonuses.
Mr Jackson produced a letter to prove that Waugh had repaid the #80,000 to the
Inland Revenue.
``He has paid #80,000 because he `bunged' his employees over this period,'' he
said.
Mr Jackson added that the Inland Revenue was likely to seek more cash to cover
interest.
``They will be back for their final pounds of flesh,'' he said.
Mr Jackson described Waugh as a ``well-kent face'' in Edinburgh and said he had
played his part in the community and organised sporting charity events.
He now found himself branded as someone who had defrauded the taxman.
``It was not a man lining his pockets,'' said Mr Jackson.

NO harm putting a penny in the old man's hat, but a seasonal suggestion that
``lucky'' 5p coins should be buried inside Christmas puddings hasn't gone down
well with safety watchdogs.
The old tradition went the way of the sixpence when the ``tanner'' was phased
out years ago - and, with no shortage of foreign objects swallowed by kids,
doctors weren't sorry.
``Reviving the custom now with such a small coin could put children at risk of
choking,'' a Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) spokeswoman
warned yesterday, after a supermarket chain cooked up the idea. Children's
hospitals contacted by Check-Out backed the experts' advice to play it safe.
Other tips from RoSPA for an accident-free Christmas: Don't hang balloons or
paper chains near a light fitting or cards beside a fire; never use Christmas
tree lights outdoors, check they are to British Safety Standard BS4647, with a
kitemark; keep toys well away from old folks to prevent falls, and banish
children from the kitchen!
n DOG and bone = phone, so it's perhaps not surprising that BT has linked up
with PAL to offer customers free calls in exchange for special labels.
A dog guzzling one can of PAL a day for a month (the same offer applies to cats
eating Kit e kat) will earn its owner some 2!s hours' worth of free calls, BT
is telling customers this month.
While not looking a gift in the mouth, Check-Out has ascertained that if you're
calling long distance at peak times your canine credit will run out in just 15
minutes. The 2!s hours mentioned by BT refers to their local weekend rate and
translating the fine print, the cash value is #1.50.
Meantime, after we reported that Edinburgh greengrocer Yousaf Hussein had
challenged BT's claim that a banana costs more than some of their 10-minute
bargain calls - at the time he was selling bananas at 5p a pound - BT are now
making the comparison with a carrot. Watch this space!

When it comes to sweet nothings Scotland leads the way as JANE SCOTT discovers
when a new chocolate bar is tested and found tasteful north of the Border
GUTFILL, indulgence and snack. You are what you eat, and the chocolate
industry, ever ready with a term to describe why we will pick a Mars over a
Flake or a Kit Kat in the sweetie shop, has us labelled as clearly as the
ingredients on a wrapper.
The UK chocolate snack bar market - or countline market, as the industry knows
it - is huge, and shows no sign of slimming down. In fact we buy more chocky
bars every year, literally defying the recession by indulging ourselves on an
annual 10.6kg of chocolate each. Much of this is in countline form, by far the
most important part of the UK confectionery market.
Competition is fierce, and chocolate manufacturers are bracing themselves for
the #2m launch in January of Siesta, a new wafer bar from Terry's of Chocolate
Orange fame.
Siesta was tried out in Scotland, where we revealed our legendary sweet tooth
and bought the bar in droves, making the marketing men very excited indeed.
Scotland is, apparently, the classic area for testing out new brands; Cadbury's
Time Out was first tasted here, as was Caramel.
As well as eating more sweets than anywhere else in the country, the reach of
our commercial TV stations allows advertising to pinpoint us directly, after
which we nip out, buy the bar and eat it in Scotland; rogue Siestas do not end
up in Bath, for example.
Siesta craftily panders to the traditional British tastes. We are a great
biscuit-eating nation (hence the wafer) and we love all things covered in
chocolate (the bar wears, naturally, a chocolate overcoat).
But the killer blow is the chocolate orange cream filling in the middle; we
have a deep and lasting love affair with orangey chocolate, seen as exotic
before the war when confectionery stars like Club biscuits and the Jaffa Cake
were launched, all but unobtainable during the bleak years of rationing and
finally an indulgence to be encouraged with the rise of advertising in the
fifties.
Its ingredients slot the bar right into the snack category of the countline
market, says Terry's Suchard marketing manager Dean Sanders.
``There seem to be three major ways of eating countlines,'' he says. ``One of
these is to combat hunger and to fill you up. We call it gutfill. It's a useful
term, and those are the heavier bars like Mars or Snickers.
``Those we call the indulgent bars are the soak-in-the-bath type. It's more a
sort of emotional comment than a physical need, brands like Flake and Caramel
or the Chocolate Orange bar.
``And then the final sort, which is the biggest market in the UK, are the snack
countlines, which are the ones that really fit with modern lifestyles, a
snatched break at the office or during the day, some sense of escapism from
where you are, but not an indulgent, luxurious break.''
The classic is Kit Kat, launched in 1935 and the biggest confectionery brand
with annual sales of nearly #215m. More than 6,000,000 of the bars are
manufactured each day, and the Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat slogan, so
important to the brand's success, was first aired in 1957.
The snack and wafer market is growing at about 7% a year as people work longer
hours and mealtimes become less of an institution. This is set to grow further
before the end of the century with the numbers of five to 14-year-olds swelling
by 3% (chocolate companies rely for a huge proportion of their sales on parents
packing a snack in the lunchbox).
A bar with the right ingredients can therefore establish itself quickly among
the big players, with Cadbury's Time Out, for example (a chunk of Flake between
wafers and covered with the obligatory chocolate) only four years old and yet
ranking at No 5 in the snacklist behind Kit Kat, Twix, Penguin and Club with
annual sales of #45m.
Richard Frost of Cadbury says the launch was vital in a market where the
company had no effective stake: ``At the end of the day the world doesn't
actually need another chocolate bar, so you have to try and work out what might
be the things that would tempt people to try something different.
Keen to make the most of a growing market, the big players are extending their
existing brands. In recent years traditional chocolate bars Aero, Dairy Milk or
Galaxy have come out in snack bar size to appeal to the on-the-hoof snacker,
while Cadbury is now promoting its pocket-pack chocolate.
The fill-you-up quality of a Mars bar keeps it a best-seller (3,000,000 are
made every day) but the parent company recently reformulated the recipe,
introducing ``a slightly lighter, smoother nougat'', equating with society's
hunger for lighter snacks.
THE market is also set to change at the top end as British tastes become more
educated about chocolate, much as they did with wine. We traditionally like our
chocolate bars milky, laced with caramel and fairly low in cocoa solids, much
to the disgust of continental chocoholics, who prefer a finer, sweeter taste.
We may see posher (and more expensive) continental bars like Ritter Sport
become more commonplace.
As competition becomes fiercer, however, predicts Sanders of Terry's Suchard,
we will see lesser-known brands of snack bar withdrawn from the market as the
cost of advertising outweighs the sales.
The British public, he says, is not so keen on experimenting with new tastes as
it is in munching through the old ones repackaged; in recent years the major
chocolate manufacturers have extended classic sweets like Mars, Twix, Kit Kat,
Yorkie, et al into ice cream, mini bars, giant bars and drinks.
These ``powerbrands'' will dominate into the next century, further entrenching
our growing habit of snacking on chocolate. And quite right too, says Sanders.
``I think the manufacturers of chocolate should recognise the magic and mystery
of chocolate. It's not just a food. It is something far more important.''

Merry gizmos to one and all as Joe Donnelly look for a
sanity clause
WE HAVE searched long and hard, as the festive times approach at lightspeed, to
find the kind of gifts that adequately reflect our scientific and technological
heritage and the amazing advances achieved in the past 12 months.
It was not easy. It seems that the wonders of science are worthless unless they
can be converted into gadgets and knick-knacks. We browsed some of the major
retailers to get a taste of what will be filling our stockings. From the looks
of some of it, the best thing to be in stockings are feet.
The Science Museum's are not all connected to a science. Some are mere curios,
and others are just gimmicks. The reader must decide into which category fall
their Spherical Dice. They're said to work just like the cubic ones which, in
our misspent youth, always acted as if they were spherical, especially when
cash wagers were involved. These are dice which really do roll, but they
apparently obey the laws of probabilities, so you'll probably still lose -
#5.99 for three.
The museum does have a handy thing for those poor souls who can't programme the
video timer and forget which button does what on a digital watch. It's a
magic-touch watch which doesn't have a fiddly little winder adjustment system.
To adjust it you press the watch face itself. Simple enough for anybody whose
had a few, comes home five hours late and needs a scapegoat for #19.95.
Or how about the ultimate gift for crossword addicts in the microchip age? This
is an electronic crossword puzzler, a hand-held device, much like the
cryptographer's version of Sega mega drive, which ensures that puzzle fans are
never without a fix. It is programmed with 30,000 clues to make up a virtual
infinity of puzzles at the touch of a button. For those without any kind of
life, this is a snip at just short of #100 at the Science Museum.
In a similar vein, and a very similar price, the museum offers a hand-held
bridge game, obviously for people who can't find three others to play with, or
form a rubber, or whatever bridgists do.
Much more interesting, and this is for real children, is a pack of paper
gliders from a Japanese designer, which come in some very unorthodox designs,
but includes a paper version of the Stealth bomber. This little kit comes in at
#16.95, complete with a 65-page flight manual. Interesting, and it gets the
kids to actually make something which works.
We also liked the Reva wave machine, which is an interesting little liquid
sculpture which recreates the rhythmic and graceful motions of a wave as it
tilts gently from side to side. So says the brochure advertising this gizmo for
#39.
Over in the Gadget Shop, they seem to have the scientific edge with a data-link
watch which can download information from a personal computer. It is not an
absolute must to have phone numbers, schedules and appointments right there on
your wrist and readable at the highly improbable depth of 300ft below the
surface, but it's a gadget and it's got a microchip and that's good enough. It
also glows in the dark, so what more could you want for #120?
For really sad people, there's a motorised lottery selector which will, for
just under a tenner (battery not supplied) choose your random numbers. Sounds
like throwing good money after the millions going straight into London cultural
institutions. The sellers have the nerve to ask buyers to let them know if they
win. As Groucho said, there is no sanity clause.
For fun with real science we have to go to the States where the Brainstorms
company will flog an Ecosphere, which is a sealed glass ball containing water,
air, and some organics like shrimps and algae.
All it needs to be self-sustaining is light. The algae convert the light to
energy, the tiny shrimps and snails feed on it, expel what the algae needs to
live on, and so on. It's a mutually dependent little world of existence, and
one which every child should experience.
Brainstorms also offer a lifelike severed hand which police in several states
want to ban, they're so fed up with being called out to suspected mutilations.
Those Yanks have actually brought out a full-body suit for dogs. As if dressing
a pooch up in a polyester romper suit is not sufficient canine embarrassment,
this thing comes in a doggie skeleton pattern. So if you lose the torso kit, at
least you know what the inside of a Rottweiller looks like. Ah, the wonders of
science.
Some of the scientific innovations look like real fun. We like the talking
camera from Polaroid, a gadget which will take an instant photie and save you
the bother of saying ``Say Cheese''.
The 636 Talking Camera has a single-chip voice playback feature which lets you
either use one of three built-in jokey messages, or record their own for
playback just before the birdie is watched. Polaroid say their garrulous
picture box will ``surreptitiously record singing in the shower and then play
it back to the `Performing Diva' while capturing a priceless photo''. The whole
kit comes complete with film for #39.99.
For the real kids, the ones jammed up against games consoles, Nintendo Game
Boy, arguably the most successful hand-held game machine on the planet, comes
in a new range to supplement the state-of-the-art classic grey. The new
machines come now in a range of colours, including a transparent version which
lets players see the internal works.
Whatever the colour, the new-tint machines play Donkey Kong Land and Mario's
Picross. They're selling from between #40 and #60.
NEC have just developed a compact pocket-sized player for full-colour motion
video and audio. In fact it's tiny and the company boast that their Silicon
View is a breakthrough technology in real-time playback from data stored on a
credit card-size memory card.
It has no moving parts and is completely solid state which allows functions
including random access. This, however, is a present for Christmas future, as
it's yet to hit the market, but it will be here soon.
For future anorak wearers who want to major in conversational Klingon, how
about a range of accessories which transforms a PC into a Star Trek control
centre? There's a sculpted ``monitor mask'' which makes the screen look like
something out of a James T Kirk nightmare. The Multimedia disk holder is in the
shape of a shuttle craft and the mouse is in the form of a phaser.
Brainworks, the suppliers, say the whole kit is available from toy stores, at
#80 for the keyboard to #17 for the phasermouse.
Older kids like us might prefer something a little less ostentatious, like the
Amstrad Infopad, selling at about #400 and described as a pocket-sized personal
communicator. It's a little hi-tech gadget which integrates computing and comms
technologies across Europe.
This personal Info centre offers all the facilities needed by the mobile
computer user in one package. A credit card-style adapter will interface to
send faxes or hook up to the Internet. It receives information broadcast by a
pager, so it can be constantly updated for the travelling suit. It is, of
course, a personal organiser to boot.
As new technology heads for miniaturisation, the ecologically minded benefit
too. Here's a hi-tech set of binoculars that easily fits into a pocket. Small,
in this case, is beautiful, yet these little spyglasses have a huge
magnification of up to nine times, and they're as neat as opera glasses. Much
handier, at #100 upwards, than the big heavy field glasses the other
birdwatchers use.
There's a host of scientific reading matter on the shelves this year. As the
Internet is on such a roll, Paul Glister's Internet Navigator, at #20, is
probably the ideal bible for the beginner, and a handy ready reckoner for the
converted. It's got more than 700 pages of web directions and connections, and
is also, easy to comprehend. A handy one which we'll keep beside the modem.
On multimedia, Maris have brought out what they claim is the ultimate desktop
planetarium. It's called Red Shift 2, sells at a penny short of #50 and to be
honest, their boast is no idle one. This little CD-Rom astronomy package is
fascinating, as well as being addictive.
It has a range of 3D animated tours of the universe in some top-class
virtual-reality simulations. We have now seen the formation of the moon,
galaxies colliding, stars exploding into novae, and we've followed comets
through space. With a soundcard, viewers can travel the universe, or skim
through 700 stunning space images to the strains of the Red Shift Suite on
synth. Those of us condemned forever to this planet can get away from it all,
for hours at an end. This is escapism at its best.
For this Christmas, we have sent our list by E-Mail, and we wait expectantly.
If there is a Santa Claus, we hope he's listening and has noted the
aforementioned. Naturally, his workshop will be at the forefront of technology
and science. We can just imagine the jolly gentleman in the red space suit, as
he passes into earth polar orbit, chuckling . . . H2O H2O H2O.
Some of the scientific innovations look like real fun
