THE Scottish Hockey Union will show its appreciation to the tremendous
service rendered to the sport by Alison Ramsay when it stages a
testimonial match for the Scotland and Great Britain player at McDiarmid
Park, Perth, on Sunday at 5pm.
Ramsay, who is the most capped women's player in the world, with 257
international appearances for Scotland (157) and Great Britain (100), is
also the finest ambassador Scotland has produced in recent years.
At the age of 36, Ramsay, a fitness fanatic, is still in peak form.
She could still command a place in the national side but took the
decision to retire last June after the finals of the European Nations
Cup in Amsterdam.
Ramsay leaves the top flight to concentrate on club hockey with
Bonagrass Grove and will also have many memories of an international
career which spanned 14 years.
The most prominent will be the bronze medal won at the Barcelona
Olympics but she has also won 15 medals from the domestic game when she
was a player with Western Klick Photopoint. She also played for them on
numerous occasions in Europe where she picked up another seven medals,
including four silver, from the European Club Championship.
The popularity of Ramsay will be reflected at Perth by the turnout of
many former colleagues in the exhibition match between a Ramsay select
and a Scottish Presidents XI. Leading the galaxy of players will be Mary
Neville, who was the captain of the British team in the memorable defeat
of Korea in Barcelona three years ago.
Unfortunately, the current British team is struggling to find the form
of its predecessors. They were beaten 2-1 by Spain in midweek despite an
equalising goal by Scot Susan MacDonald. The teams meet again tonight in
the second of the three Tests with a number of key players nursing
injuries.
Subsequently, they could encounter difficulty in levelling the series.

SCOTTISH champions City of Glasgow Ragazzi will entrust their European
progress to a 17-year-old schoolboy tonight. David Hoyle is in his sixth
year at Glasgow's Shawlands Academy but will play a key role in the
Champions' Cup first-round match with Norwegian side Batsfjord at the
Kelvin Hall.
At 6ft 8in, he is the tallest player in the Ragazzi line-up and coach
Tommy Dowens knows his strengths on and off the court -- he is a teacher
at Shawlands Academy.
''David will definitely play and there's no question he can play a key
role for us,'' said Dowens. ''Although he has no experience at this
level, he can fit into our system.''
Batsfjord include Croatian Milorad Kovac and American Harry Reed as
their professional players and have already taken the precaution of
spying on Ragazzi.
''We've watched the video of last year's European tie and it was
obvious we were too tense on court,'' said Dowens. ''We must make sure
this does not happen again.''
Ragazzi are bidding to become the first Scottish team to win a match
in Europe and Batsfjord seem to be bending over backwards to help them.
The Norwegians have agreed to play both legs in Glasgow due to the
horrendous travel problems Ragazzi would face in getting to Batsfjord
which is in the far north of Norway.
The return will be played at the Kelvin Hall on Sunday.

CIBA KELBURNE, winners of the Scottish men's league title four times
in the past six years, are presently going through a lean spell.
They have lost their last two matches but they are certainly not going
to relinquish their code of discipline to appease star players.
Gordon Moore, their captain, yesterday confirmed that striker Dougie
Wylie has been dropped from the first team for the remainder of the
season ''for failing to honour the squad's Friday night embargo.''
This is an approach which now reflects not just the attitude of the
Kelburne management but most of the country's top clubs as they try to
lift the standards. But it's a move which could have far-reaching
effects for the Paisley club.
They will be without Moore and Billy Anderson, their main
strike-force, for the visit of Insights Inverleith to Linwood tomorrow
as they are under suspension for picking up four yellow cards in the
past year.
Subsequently, former Scotland internationalist Stuart McAlpine is in
line for a recall.
Inverleith are confident of taking the three points but centre back
Kerr Thompson is taking nothing for granted.
He recalled the last meeting. ''We went down 4-3 after having led
3-0.'' But he now feels ''we are better equipped mentally for such a
game.''
Meanwhile, Jimmy Cox will be anticipating a hostile reception when he
takes Touche Ross Gordonians to Maryfield for his first game against his
old club, Menzieshill.
There is still a great cameraderie between Cox and his old team-mates
which prompted the Menzieshill coach Bruce Cuthill to say: ''We will see
how long he lasts.''
Gordonians, with their wealth of talent, should get the verdict and
kick-start their drive for the championship, particularly as
Menzieshill's John Christie is under suspension, and keep themselves
within striking distance of front-runners Grange, who are two points
ahead of Western.
Both these teams will be strongly fancied to get the verdicts in their
tussles with Pender Uddingston and Clydesdale respectively.

THE Olympic hopes of Scottish cyclist Graeme Obree received a major
spur yesterday when oil service group Scotoil announced a five-figure
sponsorship deal which will allow him the best possible preparation.
Obree overcame family tragedy, bureaucracy, and sponsorship
disappointment to win the world Professional 4000m pursuit championship
in Bogota last month and now his hopes are high for Atlanta next year.
Last season the Ayrshire cyclist was forced to race at every
opportunity to support his family but the Scotoil backing will give him
security to choose his races this season to ensure he peaks for the
Olympics and the world championships.
''I would say my prospects are pretty good,'' he said. ''There would
be no point in going if I didn't think that. There is 1000 miles of
difference between now and in February when I was on the verge of
packing it in.''
Obree was at rock bottom in February having lost his brother four
months earlier in a car accident and then being sacked from the French
team, Le Groupement, because he was unable to report for training in the
Alps because of illness.
''It was a case of flight or fight and I decided to fight,'' said
Obree, who has never looked back.
''I have been racing for 14 years and it is only now I am getting
proper backing.''
In spite of lack of sponsorship last season he won races in Greece and
Australia and took the British 4000m title in August on his way to the
world title last month.
Now, he will be able to pick and choose. ''Now, I don't need to worry
about scraping about for finance while I am doing my cycling. Scotoil
are happy for me to follow my own programme and are not insisting I ride
certain races. I can do my own thing and prepare exactly as I want to
for the Olympics. If I feel that the best preparation is not riding
races then I can do that.''
His new sponsors, the Scotoil Group, were formed only three months ago
following a multi-million pound management buy-out from ICI, led by
businessman Ian Davidson.
Davidson, himself a former racing cyclist, had his first business
success as a student when he and a partner produced tripod bicycle
stands which the British team took to the Moscow Olympics.
Now, he hopes Obree and Scotoil will together made a world-wide
impact.
They believe the sponsorship of Obree will give the group a platform
to promote further international growth.
''In this cost-reduction era, any oil service company needs to be
innovative, determined, and ambitious if it is to succeed and these are
the qualities we all recognise in Graeme Obree,'' Davidson said.
''His achievements should be properly recognised. When he set the
world one-hour record in Norway in 1993, this lad pushed cycling legends
off the list.
''We want to maximise Graeme's chances of getting to Atlanta and
bringing back the gold medal.''

ROB Andrew has quit international rugby following last night's
decision by Wasps to axe him and club captain Dean Ryan because of their
decisions to join second division Newcastle.
Within minutes of the Wasps executive committee dispensing with the
services of the two players, Andrew issued a statement ending an England
involvement which dates back to January 1985, and committed himself
fully to the ambitious north-east club, where he is to become rugby
director.
His decision means England manager Jack Rowell must find a new
stand-off to face world champions South Africa in just four weeks' time
-- and the likely candidate is Harlequins' David Pears.
Andrew's statement read: ''It is with regret that I have decided to
retire from international rugby.
''Following Wasps' decision to exclude Dean Ryan and myself from the
team for this Saturday's game, I have decided that I must remove myself
from any further speculation as to my possible inclusion in the England
team.''
Meanwhile, Wallace Mercer, the former chairman of Hearts, has scotched
rumours that Gala approached him to follow the investment lead of
Newcastle United millionaire chairman Sir John Hall.
''I don't know where these stories come from,'' said Mercer. ''Having
been involved at Hearts for 13 years I have no wish to become involved
at such a level again, in any sport.

<TEXT>
JULIAN Dicks last night claimed the English FA had punished an
innocent man after having been banned for three matches for deliberately
stamping on the head of Chelsea striker John Spencer.
The controversial West Ham full back was found guilty of violent
conduct which left the Scottish striker needing eight stitches in a
nasty wound caused by Dicks' studs.
But even though the 27-year-old Dicks maintained that the clash was
accidental, he also indicated that he would not be appealing against the
sentence handed out following a three-hour hearing.
''I don't think I'll appeal,'' said Dicks. ''If I do and lose they can
increase the number of games, but obviously I have to discuss it with
Harry Redknapp (West Ham manager) and Peter Storrie (West Ham managing
director).
''The point is, I would accept more games if they said I was not
guilty. It is the principle that concerns me. I was 99% sure I would
have won the case.''
Dicks also revealed that Robbie Hart -- the referee who issued the
defender with a yellow card after his clash with Spencer but then asked
the FA to investigate further after seeing a video re-run -- wished him
good luck before the hearing.
''The referee wished me all the best and said 'I hope you get off with
it,' '' said Dicks, who attached no blame to Spencer for not personally
attending the hearing.
He added: ''John Spencer and Chelsea Football Club have been as good
as gold, they could not have done any more. They have been really good
to me.''
Dicks, who has been booked on 54 occasions and sent-off nine times in
his career, said the guilty verdict would not force him to change his
full-blooded style of play.
He said: ''I am not going to let it affect me -- at the end of the
day, Harry Redknapp believes me, Peter Storrie believes me, the
supporters believe me and my wife and family believe me. I can't ask for
any more.''
* DUNFERMLINE'S Paul Kinnaird yesterday joined English third division
side Scarborough. No fee was involved.

Everton 0, Feyenoord 0
EVERTON preserved their long unbeaten European record but failed to
establish their prime target in an intriguing Cup-winners' Cup tie at
Goodison Park.
Their best performance of the season was not enough to dent
Feyenoord's defence and they must now go to Rotterdam in a fortnight
hoping to repeat their 1985 glory night there when they beat Austria
Vienna to win the competition.
Manager Joe Royle's personnel and tactical changes were rewarded with
a performance full of enterprise and determination -- but no goals.
It was a step in the right direction for Everton, who had won only one
of their previous seven matches. But they still left the pitch facing a
huge task to progress to the third round.
They more than matched Feyenoord's technical skills with true grit,
despite being without six first-team players.
Royle lined the team up with Earl Barrett, Craig Short, and Gary
Ablett in a triple centre-back formation with David Unsworth and Matthew
Jackson employed as raiding wing backs.
The switches -- incorporating Vinny Samways' return to midfield --
once more made Everton a threatening force yet at the end of the evening
they still owed much to veteran goalkeeper Neville Southall.
The Wales internationalist pulled off four brilliant saves from
Michael Obiku, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Rob Witschge, and Rob Maas to
deny Feyenoord a smash and grab win.
Indeed, Everton came desperately close to snatching victory with two
minutes remaining when Paul Rideout threw himself forward to meet
substitute Stuart Barlow's cross but his header went a yard over the
bar.

Paris St Germain 1 Celtic 0
THIS result in the Parc de France last night continued a week of
defeats for Scottish clubs in Europe, but Celtic emerged from this
Cup-winners' Cup, second-round, first-leg clash with their reputation
intact, and with considerable credit.
Indeed, if their giant Dutchman Pierre van Hooydonk had scored with
the simplest of chances nine minutes before half-time, things could all
have been so different.
Still, the Scottish Cup-holders left Paris with the cheers of their
supporters in the 30,000 crowd still ringing around the stadium long
after the game had finished.
In two weeks' time the same supporters, and so many others, can become
a potent weapon as the Parkhead club bid to reach the quarter-finals of
this tournament.
The French players have already indicated that they fear for their
visit to Scotland, and after this match, manager Tommy Burns insisted:
''It is going to be one hell of a night at our place.
''The people of Paris saw the passion and the fervour of our
supporters. They see what surrounds this club and that will be seen
again for the second leg.
''The fans will be very important for us. They are remarkable, quite
incredible really, and I think they knew that these players out there
gave everything for them tonight.''
On the goal miss which eventually meant so much to Celtic, Burns shook
his head and said: ''I just think that Pierre either jumped too early or
maybe even just stretched for the ball. He didn't get it properly, and
it was the best chance of the game.
''We were able to restrict them to very few chances. That is why I
believe that we have a fighting chance to reach the quarter-final now.''
The chance arrived for van Hooydonk after 36 minutes. Paul McStay
played a ball forward and Phil O'Donnell got to the byeline, where the
Paris keeper Bernarda Lama raced to tackle him.
The Celtic midfielder kept possession, turned away from Lama, and sent
the cross towards the far post where the Dutchman was unmarked. But the
giant striker headed weakly past a post and it was a moment that Celtic
lived to regret.
Afterwards van Hooydonk explained: ''I looked up and just for a moment
I was dazzled by the lights, lost the flight of the ball, and mistimed
the header. It was a great cross by Phil O'Donnell and it was a chance I
should have taken.''
It was 33 minutes before Gordon Marshall had to make his first save
and that was from a long, low ball fired in by Vincent Guerin.
The French, around this period, had two men booked, Guerin for a
tackle from behind on Collins, and Stephane Mahe for a wild challenge on
O'Donnell.
In the second half, as if relishing their escape, the French looked
more dangerous. They had more possession, and yet it was still difficult
for them to find a way into the Celtic penalty box.
In 75 minutes, Youri Djorkaeff struck the bottom of a post with one
shot which was a warning to the Scots. A moment later he scored the only
goal of the match.
Guerin broke away from John Hughes, and from the byeline cut the ball
back perfectly for the international midfielder to strike a shot
precisely and carefully beyond Marshall.
As skipper Paul McStay remarked afterwards: ''We still did not buckle
when they scored which says a lot for the team.''
Indeed, they did not. They went forward themselves, hoping against
hope to find some chink on which they could capitalise.
They failed, but it was a gallant failure, and the players and Burns
who came out on to the field to wave to the support, were told that by
those thousands who had made the journey to the city of light.
Celtic, in a disciplined performance, had just one booking -- John
Collins who disagreed with a referee's decision which went against him,
and hurled the ball away in anger.
This was a night which Burns must have savoured. Simon Donnelly
replaced Phil O'Donnell in 68 minutes but, basically, Burns had decided
to stick with the men who had begun the job. He did not risk his young
players in the atmosphere of this stadium. However, he may be ready to
do so in the return now that they have tasted a big European night.
The tie is far from over. Paris St Germain did enough to suggest that
they can score away from home -- but Celtic also showed the resilience
they possess.
Then, there are these supporters to back them. Burns is right. It is
going to be one hell of a night.
PARIS ST GERMAIN -- Lama, Cobos, Colleter, Mahe, Leguen, Djorkaeff,
Bravo, Guerin, Fournier, Rai, Loko. Substitutes -- Dieng, Allou, Llacer,
Nouma, Dutruel.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, Hughes, Grant, O'Donnell,
McStay, van Hooydonk, Thom, Collins. Substitutes -- Donnelly, Kerr,
Walker, McLaughlin, McQuilken.
Referee -- M Benko (Austria).

RUGBY Union has been forced into accepting a change to a ''New Open
Game'' in a timescale which even those who called for the end to
Shamateurism would not have believed possible less than three months
back.
If paying players to play the game, with all the questions of
contracts, registration forms, transfer fees and super clubs south of
the border was not enough, the prospect of a European Club Championship,
in 1996/97, run by the Five Nations Championship Committee, has been
thrown into the ring.
The combination of both will require fundamental restructuring of the
Scottish fixture card, yet again, and changes which could decide whether
Scottish rugby improves to keep pace with the best in the world or slide
back amongst the developing nations.
Jim Telfer, SRU Director of Rugby, along with some well kent faces on
Rugby Special, have made it clear that they see district or
representative sides being the only way Scottish teams could compete
successfully in Europe.
Jim Telfer continually cites the New Zealand, Australian, and South
African structure of provincial rugby as a standard far above that which
we produce at district level, and one to which we should aspire.
However, he also accepts that English and French club rugby is of a
much higher standard than our own, and that our district sides would
struggle to compete in the Courage League's first division.
I believe a season with too much representative rugby could be the
death knell for the game in Scotland, and not the lifeline that the SRU
predict it would be to keep us amongst the top nations in the world.
The following objectives for Scottish rugby are my own, but I am sure,
if asked, nine out of 10 enthusiasts would come up with a similar list:
* Retaining the best traditions in the Scottish game.
* Retaining our top players currently playing in Scotland.
* Bringing our exiles to play their club/district rugby in Scotland.
* Increasing the number playing the game at all levels.
* Increasing the number of players who can compete, successfully, with
the top nations in the world.
* Providing a coaching structure to improve all levels of players.
* Providing an administration to successfully develop the ''New Open
Game.''
* Producing a game which an increasing number of supporters will pay
to see.
This article cannot contain anything like enough detail to cover the
issues which should decide whether clubs or districts will compete in
Europe.
However, because of the possible format of the proposed European
competition, entering district or representative teams is, at least,
flawed and, at worst, a scenario for signalling the demise of a
strengthening Scottish club structure along with a reduction in youth
recruitment into the game.
It has been suggested that two or three Scottish teams may take part
in the competition which will take the form of four leagues of five
teams with each team playing two home and two away matches. The league
matches will take place on alternate weekends in October and November.
The winners of each league will then progress to a knockout stage with
semi-finals played during December and the final played either at the
end of the month or into the first week of January.
If district/representative teams are to compete successfully they will
require one or two warm-up games prior to the competition and in order
to maintain continuity would have to play on the weekends between the
European matches. Removing a minimum of 50 top players from the clubs
would result in the following scenario for the premier first and second
divisions:
* A maximum of five weekends available for Premier League rugby prior
to representative rugby taking over in October.
* No further Premier League rugby available until the free weekends
during the Five Nations Championship.
* Premier divisions restricted to 10 teams and nine-game leagues.
There has to be an acceptable alternative to this if clubs are not to
lose all the aspirations created from league structures which have
provided the competitive edge required to increase standards and the
number of spectators turning up to watch matches.

SCOTLAND World Cup hero Graham Thompson last night prepared to do
battle with the Cook Island tough-nuts, and declared: ''I want to be the
Gavin Hastings of rugby league.''
The 23 year old, who normally plays full-back for Watsonians Seconds,
certainly put on a real Hastings-type display on Wednesday as the Scots
stepped up their bid for the Emerging Nations world title.
He weighed in with 14 points in the 38-16 demolition of the USA to set
up a group-deciding showdown with the men from the South Seas at exotic
Castleford tonight.
He said: ''Since I was a kid, my ambition had always been to play
rugby for Scotland, but I never thought for a minute it would happen in
league instead of union.
''But now I've made it, I want to be as big a name in this code as
Gavin is in the other one.''
Thompson, who is looking for work after having graduated from Moray
House College in Edinburgh, reckons Scotland will have to be at their
very best to have any chance against the Cook Islanders.
He said: ''Russia and America were just a bunch of enthusiastic and
very fit guys who ran around for 80 minutes without much method.
''The Cook Islands are a different prospect altogther. They are a real
team of real rugby league players who have the sport in their blood.''
Scottish coach George Fairbairn won't decide his line-up until just
before kick-off.
Several players underwent treatment yesterday, although there are no
serious casualties.
Veteran Hugh Waddell said: ''Everyone is feeling the pace. Three games
in five days is a lot to ask of even the fittest folk.''
The winners of tonight's clash will go through to the final against
Ireland at Bury on Tuesday night.
The men from the South Seas are in rampant form, having topped the
half-century mark against both the USA and Russia.

DAMON Hill was on the receiving end of a double blast of criticism
from two of his fellow British drivers yesterday.
The first came from within his own Williams team as David Coulthard
slammed his defeatist attitude for conceding the title even though there
was still a mathematical possibility of overhauling Michael Schumacher.
And Martin Brundle, the most experienced British driver with 141 races
behind him, said Hill needed to use Sunday's Pacific Grand Prix to begin
to re-establish his reputation as a top racer.
Hill launches his qualifying campaign in the early hours of tomorrow
morning knowing that Schumacher needs just three points to retain the
title -- even if the Briton wins the race.
But outgoing Williams driver Coulthard blasted: ''I cannot see ever
allowing myself to give up. I do not agree with what Damon did, no
matter how disappointed you are.
''If you give up once, you always give up. In Grand Prix so many
things can happen -- as you see in other sports. There are three races
left and Michael could have three non-finishes.''
Brundle, bound for Jordan from Ligier Honda, said Hill might have to
risk further accidents to restore a reputation hit by several mistakes
this season.
''Damon has to establish himself as the No.1 driver in the Williams
team for next year and get their full support.''
Hill today again admitted that Schumacher is poised to celebrate a
second world crown, saying: ''It is only a matter of time before Michael
secures his required three points.''

BRITISH interest in the Brighton International tournament ended
yesterday at the second-round stage as Clare Wood slumped to a 6-2, 7-6
(7-4) defeat at the hands of sixth seed Helena Sukova, of the Czech
Republic.
The strong-serving Czech took advantage of Wood's early hesitancy to
build a 4-0 lead, which she comfortably translated into a first-set
victory.
But the second was much more of a contest. Although both players had
their serves broken early on, the set went to a tie-break, which was
decided when Wood netted a backhand volley.
Austria's Barbara Paulus upset eighth seed Irina Spirlea, of Romania,
7-6 (7-5), 6-4 in a dour contest which lasted nearly two hours.
Bulgarian Magdalena Maleeva reached the quarter-finals with a 1-6,
6-4, 6-1 win over Germany's Barbara Rittner.

REMEMBER Mr Lu? Sure you do. He was the little man from Taiwan in the
pork-pie hat who finished second to Lee Trevino in the Open of 1971 at
Birkdale.
As he came up the last hole, Mr Lu Liang Huan, to give him his full
moniker, bounced a shot off a specator's head. The fan recovered and so
did Lu -- he got his par 4.
The latest Mr Lu, Lu Wen-Teh actually, popped up at St Andrews
yesterday as part of the Republic of China (Taiwan) team who were taken
to the laundry by the brave boys of the home team. And this Mr Lu had a
hard time.
He scored 81 in the end, the day's highest, as he lost to Sam
Torrance's 75. But, just like his illustrious predecessor, he kept
smiling.
He is 32, and turned pro six years ago. Among his successes so far are
the Shin Fong Open, the Mercuries Cup Masters, and the Taichung Open. He
won the Taiwan order of merit last year and is known for accurate iron
play.
Lu is currently lying in equal 1010th place in the Sony world
rankings. There is a reason for this -- you cannot fall any lower than
that.
Yet for the best part of an hour, thanks to a birdie at the fifth, Lu
led Torrance, the No.1 in the Volvo European rankings. Indeed, he was
out in 38 to the broomhandle and moustache's 39.
''He is a very nice swinger of a club,'' Torrance was moved to
observe. ''He just found it a wee bit difficult to cope with the wind.''
And how.
It gusted at more than over 50mph and little Lu was swaying in it. ''I
found it very difficult to keep still on the way in, and eventually I
three-putted five times in a row. We don't have winds like these in
Taiwan,'' he said.
''Even so, I enjoyed it. It is my first time in this event and my
first look at St Andrews, so it is a big thrill. Cold, though.''
The manager of the Chinese squad, who have never actually got past the
first round in five attempts, is Mr Wen Chen. He was able to tell me
that there are more than 200 golf professionals in Taiwan and that the
game is booming in popularity.
''There could be as many as half-a-million people playing now. We have
around 50 courses and the designers have included Jack Nicklaus and
Arnold Palmer.
''It is quite expensive -- a round in my country would cost you $80.''
In fact, Wen old pal, a round here is more than that.
The Chinese take on South Africa, Ernie Els et al, today and few will
give them a hope. ''Easy win,'' joked Mr Lu, and retired, still smiling.

INSURANCE companies are clamping down on pay-outs to customers who
have been less than honest to them about personal/driving records.
Negative reactions can be expected to the discovery of non-disclosure
of things like previous speeding convictions, heavy or regular
medication, or physical disability which limits a driver's control.
And wording of proposal forms has been tightened up. Companies want to
know how many vehicles and drivers there may be in a family, and are
looking for what one broker calls ''the unmentioned 17-year-old''.
Many policies are now negotiated by telephone and that might make it
relatively easy for clients to be economical with the truth. When asked
over the phone if they have driving convictions, some may feel they can
take a deep breath and say no. It is a different matter when an
inquisitor asks across an office desk: ''Are you sure?''
While some people have been known to shop around different insurers,
perhaps modifying what they admit about their driving record or physical
condition until they are accepted, the fact that so much insurance
business is now computerised, and firms can check with each other, means
there are fewer and fewer places to hide.

BRIAN Laudrup will not be free from injury in time to play against
Juventus when the Italians come to Glasgow at the beginning of next
month, but in any case, the Dane's presence probably would have made
only a slight difference, if any.
Often Laudrup can be a tremendous player in the premier division, but
there is a whole world of difference between the Scottish game and
whatever it is Juventus are about.
Perhaps if Rangers' defence had been tighter from the beginning of
their Champions' League match on Wednesday night, the defeat might not
have been so devastating, but Juventus would have won because they are a
team, and at this level Rangers are not.
People may say that perhaps if Laudrup, Paul Gascoigne, Charlie
Miller, and Alan McLaren had all been available, the Ibrox side might
have acquitted themselves better. Maybe, but then again maybe if
Rangers' flight out of Glasgow had been delayed a couple of days, they
might have avoided defeat.
No purpose will be served by thinking about absent players. Besides,
it was of no consequence whatsover to Juventus that they had to play
without Gianluca Vialli, Attilio Lombardo, Vladimir Jogovic, and Michele
Padovano, all of them players who could influence any game, and who are
better than the players Rangers could not use.
Juventus have much better all-round players everywhere in their team,
which makes one wonder why anyone should think that by abolishing the
three-foreigner rule, Rangers will be better able to compete at the top
level. Unless they can buy a handful of the very best Italians, Germans,
French and Dutch, they will still be lacking. The fact is footballers
from these countries, and several others, do it much better than us
Scots, or Brits for that matter.
It is not only a question of superior skill either. The Italians and
others in Europe have a much greater degree of professionalism, a higher
mentality, and also a greater respect for sport when it comes to playing
football. The majority of Scottish players get serious about their work
maybe on a Thursday for Saturday, but by then the Italians are away in
their camps concentrating only on the next match.
Vialli and Paolo Sousa, for instance, stay in a most fashionable part
of Turin near the city centre, a place you wouldn't ever want to leave,
but they are never at home in the days before Juventus's games. They are
locked away from their public, and not in any danger of driving their
manager, Marcello Lippi, to distraction.
These players know how to behave like professional athletes and while
they, too, might lament the loss of their freedom, they have chosen to
be footballing superstars and accept the rewards which accompany such
status. They pay the price, small as it is, and that is why they are
always prepared mentally and physically when the time comes to play.
Surely, then, if our players can't perform like them -- the reasons
for our sub-standard football have are widely documented and it will
take at least a couple of generations before we are on the right lines
-- they can think like them. They should try at least to behave like
them by living properly and disciplining themselves to live like
athletes, and not irresponsible children with pockets full of money.
The rest of us should stop smiling at their exploits because they
aren't funny. They are not paid to act like other people, like fans
even. They are salaried to entertain by keeping their best for the
football pitch.
Club owners like David Murray and managers like Walter Smith must
start demanding more than they get from their players because attitudes
will have to change before any club can begin again to harbour hopes of
beating major European clubs on a regular basis. It is as much a matter
of mentality as talent and it would be a beginning at least if we all
realised this much.
Smith said on his return from Turin that ''there are games when you
have to hold your hands up and say you were well beaten . . . we were
well beaten,'' but while that is an honest assessment, it does little to
ease the pain of watching the champions of Scotland being made to look
less than mediocre by their counterparts from Italy.
Of course Juventus are among the top few sides in Europe, and it is
difficult to argue against Smith's belief that they are one of the two
best teams currently, with Ajax being the other. Still, the main point
must be that Rangers again have failed to perform against a European
side, and that must alarm Smith.
Rangers have looked like a team in only one of their last seven
matches against foreign opposition and that is unacceptable. AEK Athens
(over two legs,) Anorthosis Famagusta (two legs,) Steaua Bucharest
(away,) and Juventus in the Stadio Delle Alpi on Wednesday night were
matches in which the Ibrox side disappointed, and only against Borussia
Dortmund at Ibrox did they look as though they deserved to be mixing
with the elite.
Too often, too many of Rangers' players have failed to produce the
kind of form expected of highly-paid professionals. Supporters,
especially those who pay to travel abroad have been let down, and even
though few really expected Rangers to beat Juventus, the manner in which
they were beaten 4-1 exposed weaknesses.
The defence, undoubtedly undermined by the absence of McLaren,
appeared sluggish and niave, and in midfield there was an emptiness.
This, of course, meant the forwards had hardly any opportunities to
cause any damage.
The fact that Juventus had 22 shots on goal compared to Rangers' two
says everything really, and if the Turin club feel like playing at Ibrox
in the return match, they will win comfortably again.
Miller may become a talented footballer if he continues to make
progress, but while we are prepared to wait and still describe promising
players as ''youngsters'' when they are married and bringing up
families. Players like Alessandro del Piero, 21 next month, is already
on top of the world.
Smith preferred to say yesterday his players were not ''strong enough
at this level as a team,'' but he knows. He thinks deeply about his
work.
Laudrup and Gascoigne will not bridge the gap between Rangers and
Juventus and neither will Oleg Salenko, who appeared dreadfully
leaden-footed. His admirers say he is deceptive and they may be correct.
He could be even more sluggish than we think, and it is no use pointing
to anything he does in the premier division because that is not where
the real game is played.
If the contributions so far of Rangers' foreign contingent can be used
as reliable measures, then it is fair to say the Ibrox club are not
being given true value for their money. The big purchases are supposed
to help the cause abroad as well as at home and ideally the likes of
Laudrup might even be allowed to set an example to those players who
apparently don't know how their foreign equivalents behave.
Rangers lost a crucial match the other night, but if their torment is
analysed properly and the correct long-term strategy applied they might
one day become winners in the only league that actally matters.
'Too often, too many of Rangers'
players have failed to produce
the kind of form expected of
highly-paid professionals.'

THE campaign to protect the future of the Scottish hill farming
industry continued in Edinburgh yesterday when industry organisations
and principal sheep breed societies met with Scottish Office officials.
''We had a useful meeting and were able to press the hardship case of
hill farmers, particularly those in the north and north-east which have
suffered from lowed income but higher expenditure,'' said Richard Henton
of the Scottish Farmers' Union.
Delegates pressed that the present hill farming review should restore
Hill Livestock Compensatory Amounts which have been trimmed in recent
years. Current market prices were more than being overcome by increased
costs and hill farm incomes are forecast to be unsustainably low.
There will be further meetings in London next week at which MPs will
be asked to support the case for disadvantaged producers.

Paisley doctor David Sloan and his wife, Pauline, are a family at war
with uncaring authority. Here he describes their travails in a bid to
seek help for a son with major behavioural problems -- and highlights
the widespread ignorance and prejudice among the educational, medical,
and social services establishments about his condition. But he also sees
hope for the future for similar Scottish families who may be living a
private life of hell
WE realised something was amiss when our three-year-old son attacked
his mother with a kitchen knife. For him the ''terrible twos'' had never
ended. All children have temper tantrums -- but so many, so often, so
destructive?
We were living in New Zealand and went to see a child psychologist
acquaintance -- he was sympathetic but offered no answers. At
kindergarten our son was a byword for wayward behaviour: ''Don't do a
Tom'', parents would admonish their offspring.
When he went to school he was little trouble in the structured
environment but eventually we realised what his elderly teacher would
not acknowledge: he was memorising his reading book. We got a private
assessment done and, yes, he was profoundly dyslexic.
We finally got Tom on the reading recovery programme. (A renowned New
Zealand initiative which was piloted here recently but has had its
funding withdrawn by the Government.) On a flight back from job-hunting
in the UK, I got talking to an American woman whose child was
hyperactive and was on amphetamine-type medication which paradoxically
calmed him down -- but I didn't twig. We felt that Tom's temper tantrums
and dyslexia were in some way linked, but got no guidance.
Returning to Scotland on a drookit November night we took up temporary
residence in a hospital house in Greenock. The disruption, the weather,
the tiny house all exacerbated Tom's condition -- life was hell.
We relocated to a more salubrious area nearer work but our son made
short work of antagonising potential playmates and their parents -- we
were persona non grata. Almost as soon as we had touched down in
Scotland we sought to get Tom a record of needs from the education
department.
Despite being motivated in an advantaged position and forearmed with
his NZ assessment, it took over a year of struggle to get a record of
needs. Even then he would not have been put on the waiting-list for the
local reading centre and only had visits to his teacher for the centre
-- we had to dig in our heels.
Sadly, while education authorities have a legal obligation to meet the
specific learning needs of a child, they were never funded to do so.
Thus they and their educational psychologists are placed in the
invidious position of not seeking out such children and indeed
pooh-poohing any alleged problems and even putting obstruction in the
path of parents who seek the necessary education for their children with
learning disabilities.
While we were advancing on that front Tom's behaviour problems
worsened with verbal, emotional, and physical abuse of his sister and
mother. What caused extra stress was that his tantrums, albeit frequent,
were unpredictable and for no reason or a trivial one, this sensitive
humorous child would turn into what seemed like a devil incarnate.
One weekend just before his eighth birthday while I was away, Tom's
tantrums reached epic proportions leading to destruction and violence to
his sister and his (only) friend. My wife, Pauline, had to restrain him.
Help was needed urgently she decided, but from whom? We had been
referred to a Child Guidance Centre in Glasgow (Notre Dame), but after
one interview were put on a waiting-list. We sought an emergency
appointment and revealed all our difficulties to their social worker.
The following morning we were ''raided'' by the social services and
police. That's how it felt as we were interviewed by a social worker and
policewoman about the ''abuse'' of our son -- ''the Gestapo raid'' my
wife calls it and I don't think she will be the same again.
Putting us off attending, social services quickly decided at a rushed
case conference that we were guilty of ''emotional abuse'' and put Tom
on an at-risk register. We were not informed what emotional abuse was
which, along with our non-involvement in the case conference, was one of
the many breaches of their own code of practice that social work were
guilty of -- and for which we finally nailed them for in our formal
complaint to the regional director.
You must remember we had been under terrible stress as a family trying
to deal with Tom's behaviour. This added onslaught almost broke us. This
was a case of victim blaming, no help, just extra pressure and stress.
Shortly after this nightmare we had a visit from a relative who works
in child development clinics in Queensland, Australia. She quietly
observed Tom as he had yet another ''paddy'' at home or going ''ape'' on
our visit to the Burrell Collection.
Several weeks after she had gone, we received a book in the post, The
Hidden Handicap. This was the first major break for us. We saw at a
glance all our son's characteristics and problems were part and parcel
of a neurological dysfunction: attention deficit disorder (ADD) which
was well-recognised in Australia and the US. The author, Dr Gordon
Serfontein, had kids of his own with ADD. (Tragically he died shortly
afterwards in a road traffic accident but the mantle for ADD in
Australia was picked up by Dr Christopher Green, who will be visiting
Glasgow onSunday.)
Back to Tom's dyslexia, a common finding in ADD. We had seen in an
educational supplement that a school for dyslexia in Dorset had a summer
holiday programme. We were going down that way anyway, so we visited and
got Tom enrolled. The headmaster recommended we get an independent
assessment from a pyschologist in Bournemouth.
A lovely woman who was frequently an expert witness for parents who
were taking their local authorities to court over their failure to
provide their dyslexic charges with adequate provision. She spent many
hours on Tom's assessment. It confirmed the NZ findings. She was
disturbed about Tom's violence, obsessions, and his fantasies about
doing violence to his sister and mother.
Back to porridge, we found out that without proper explanation social
services had referred us to the reporter to the children's panel for our
son being ''out of parental control''.
Scots fondly hold up the children's panel system as a model for
others, but in our opinion it is a pernicious organisation that violates
basic legal and human rights. For example, after much expense and effort
we successfully appealed in the sheriff court against the children's
panel ruling. However, as is almost invariably the case, we were
referred back to the children's panel, back to the reporters who had
fought against our appeal in court, back to the panel we had protested
against! Basically we were being charged with the same ''offence''
twice.
This quasi-judicial process has a unique position to exercise harm. As
we found, its ruling cannot effectively be overturned in the court
while, on the other hand, the Ombudsman for Local Government refuses to
investigate any complaints about its conduct because of its supposed
legal stature!
These ''caring agencies'' did not help, they harmed, instead of
healing they harassed. We had to pursue a ''twin track'' approach and
for Tom's dyslexia we asked the education department for a placement in
Lendrick Muir School near Kinross, the only school in Scotland
registered specifically and solely for dyslexic pupils.
We were turned down and had to formally appeal. This was held by a
panel at the regional headquarters. The local educational psychologist
could not produce evidence of a proper assessment while we had our
independent one. Our appeal was upheld by a single vote. (The first time
in Strathclyde for dyslexia.)
Another call on our time were visits to see a child psychiatrist at
Yorkhill. These were largely unproductive as he seemed to favour the
psychoanalytic approach, to have scant regard for ADD but much for his
own self worth. We strung along with this sterile relationship until we
could get the children's panel off our back. This we finally did,
largely thanks to that excellent lawyer Paul Burns.
We later pursued formal complaints against the reporter and children's
panel for breaches in their own published code of practice. However,
despite lobbying the region, our MP and Lord Fraser of Carmylie, we got
nowhere.
Finally we found a sympathetic paediatrician who was versed in ADD and
Tom was started on Ritalin, an amphetamine-like drug that in attention
deficit disorder paradoxically calms down rather than stimulates by
normalising the balance of neurotransmitters. His behaviour improved
under its effect and a marked improvement in his attention span and
learning ability was noted at the residential school.
Attention deficit disorder is a neurological condition with a physical
and chemical basis. The frontal lobes of the brain underfunction in ADD
and are less able to control the primitive limbic system which is
responsible for our basic emotions and actions, eg anger, fight or
flight. They can't ''put on the brakes''. There is also an imbalance of
the brain's chemical ''messengers''.
Modern scanning methods show subtle but definite differences between
parts of the brain of those with ADD (and dyslexia) and the rest of us.
At least 5% of children have this problem which is often inherited and
persists into adulthood.
This is a widely accepted condition in Australia and the US with much
research over a number of years. The use of stimulant amphetamines which
paradoxically control hyperactivity dates back to 1937 and attention
deficit disorder and hyperactivity is the commonest cause of ''referal''
to child psychiatrists.
There has to be a group of overlapping conditions related to
neurological dysfunction/immaturity. By no means every dyslexic child is
hyperactive or vice-versa, and only a small proportion of children with
ADD have the more serious oppositional defiant and conduct disorders.
It's that last group who are at risk of future criminality as claimed
in the recent TV programmes and book by Anne Moir and David Jessell. By
far the greatest burdens of ADD on children and their families are
stress and discord, risk of accident and wasted potential due to
inadequate provision to help them with their behavioural and learning
difficulties. It's a tragic waste of human capital and a cause of
needless grief.
With some notable exceptions much ignorance and prejudice still remain
among the educational, medical and social services establishments. More
articles on ADD appear in women's magazines and the popular press than
in these professionals' own journals. However, parental pressure is
pushing ADD on to their agendas.
I believe we may be at a turning point in this country. A critical
mass of popular knowledge and gradual professional acceptance is
building up and I hope the visit by Dr Christopher Green from Australia
on Sunday can tip the balance and set ADD firmly as a national issue
that must be addressed.

professionals at 2.30pm on Sunday at Temple/Anniesland Parish Church

THE lovely Rouken Glen park on the outskirts of Glasgow is the
somewhat unusual but delightful setting for Cathay Cuisine, an elegant
restaurant specialising in Cantonese and Peking cookery. The attractive
stone building, which used to be a tearoom before Cathay Cuisine took
over eight years ago, can be found at the edge of the park, next to the
garden centre and the hothouses of Eastwood Butterfly Kingdom. It is
easily reached from town via the A77 and Thornliebank.
Cathay Cuisine is the perfect place to celebrate a special event such
as a birthday or anniversary, but during the run-up to Christmas there's
also a lively programme of lavish banquets and seasonal parties to suit
all tastes.
The atmosphere at Cathay Cuisine is warm, friendly and relaxed, and
the decor is restful yet sophisticated. It has the subtle, elegant,
Charles Rennie Mackintosh style, with beautifully co-ordinated carpets
and curtains, and the greatest attention to detail, down to fresh
Madonna lilies on the tables.
The same regard to detail is found in the restaurant's delightful
service. Scented hot towels are served to freshen-up after delicious
savoury morsels, beautifully prepared to appeal to both sight and taste.
Cathay Cuisine's Mixed Starter is a meal in itself -- a feast of
contrasting flavours and textures -- dainty, light-as-a-feather spring
rolls filled with delicate chicken and cream sauce; tasty, succulent
spare-ribs; chicken deep-fried with banana; chicken wings in honey
sauce; irresistibly tasty seaweed appetiser and spicy slivers of fillet
of beef are a few of the titbits on offer.
Apart from the highly popular weekend dinner dances, the Cathay
Cuisine seasonal programme starts on Tuesday with an Autumn Banquet
which promises superb food, plus entertainment from a comedian. Sunday
the 29th offers a Family Hallowe'en Party and there's an adults'
Hallowe'en Party on the 31st. November celebrations include St Andrew's
Day, when Scottish dress is optional.
It's not too soon to think about Christmas either, whether it's the
office party or a family celebration. Cathay Cuisine has a varied
Christmas and New Year dinner and lunch menu offering delicious
permutations on the oriental or the traditional Scottish theme, for
which early booking is essential.
Live music, karaoke and pipers -- not to mention Santa -- are
all-inclusive, and come February next year you can look forward to Kung
ha fa choi -- the Chinese New Year (Year of the Rat).
Cathay Cuisine is also adding Thai food to its specialist menu, making
it the only restaurant on the South Side of the city to offer this
spicier oriental taste. The new a la carte Thai menu includes delicious
hot and sour dishes using spices such as lemon grass, lime leaf, alan-ka
and coriander, with coconut milk to mellow the flavours.
And for diners who are unfamiliar with Thai food, Cathay Cuisine will
also provide tasting buffets to enable sampling of the various dishes.

Stewart Fraser sets sail with an enthusiastic crew charting a
patriotic course
THERE'S a challenge in the ship's name -- Spirit of Scotland. It has
to mean a sturdy independence of mind, compassion for others, and
thought for the future.
You get it all and more in this particular Spirit. She's a faithful
replica of a Liverpool Bay pilot schooner, built by local young people
as Spirit of Merseyside under the supervision of unemployed craftsmen,
and celebrating her tenth birthday this year.
From March 1992, she has been sponsored by Scottish Nuclear, with a
change of name and Glasgow registration. There was a recent #30,000
refit by unemployed volunteers on the Clyde. Many saw her in the Tall
Ships Race from Leith in the summer.
The idea is straightforward. The national charity, Fairbridge, with
Princess Alexandra as patron, was established to look after young people
deemed at risk -- from unemployment or homelessness, from being unwaged
or simply unwanted.
Going to sea with them on the ship was a lesson in how a caring spirit
is demonstrated, in practice rather than book-based theory. For most, it
was a first time for sailing. A 20ft bowsprit was a personal challenge.
Climbing ratlines, with baggy wrinkle at the side, was literally a heady
experience.
It's 100ft to the top of the main mast, and not much less for the
foremast. Spirit is a schooner -- the big mast is at the rear. There's a
boom on the staysail as well. But the jib flies free, right out on the
bowsprit. Then it was time to set the sails, all 2500 sq ft of it -- the
crew raring to go.
There are gaff-rigged boats still on the Clyde, not many as large as
the Spirit. She catches the eye, taking up 92ft of space to the tip of
her bowsprit, with a beam of 17ft 6in and 11ft 6in of draught. She's
old-style built, with teak decks, and pitch pine on oak frames.
More importantly, she takes four staff and dozen or so learner crew.
The bunks are basic but comfortable, and there are two heads -- one to
port, one to starboard.
Go to sea for a sail-training course, and doing your own housekeeping
includes learning how to cook in a compact galley with appliances on
bottled gas. The safety code is important -- turn off the tap when
you're finished and don't smoke below decks.
There's a six-cylinder 106 hp Volvo for any calm periods. Everyone
wanted to get the sails up, working out which bit of string moved which
spar of wood.
Up with the peak and throat halyards, get the parrel beads running
freely on the mast. A last haul on the topping lift, and that's the main
set. Same with the foresail, and then the staysail. Coming past Largs,
we set a jib for good measure, running before a good breeze, making
around eight knots.
It was all learning time for the youngsters on board. How to read a
chart, the difference between lateral and cardinal marks, how to assess
distance off, and how to steer a ship displacing 87 tons of water.
There's one steering position -- out in the open. The GPS gear, telling
position to a few yards, and the radar screen were largely ignored by
this crew who wanted to do things for themselves.
The whole course in short is part of a learning experience and
increases a spirit of independence.

ALTHOUGH in a perfect world the situation would be otherwise, it is
simply not possible for any car manufacturer to upgrade all its model
lines at the same time. There is always one range which lags a little
behind.
At Mercedes, the E-class was suffering by comparison with the smaller
yet more up to date C-class, but that has now been corrected. The latest
E-class which has just gone on sale here is the result of a #1.3billion
development programme, and if its external appearance is a shock to
traditionalists, the specification of the car is uprated in almost every
way.
Sceptics tend to believe that any improved new car is bound to be
heavier than the one it replaces. That has happened regularly since the
1920s. However, the new E-class is lighter, model for model, despite
offering better safety features and a roomier passenger cabin.
It is also more efficient aerodynamically, to the point where the
entry-level E200 has the lowest Cd figure of any production saloon in
the world. That, as much as the engine revisions and the lighter weight,
provides improved fuel consumption all the way through the range.
To people who see the new E-class for the first time, the styling,
with its four angled headlamps and almost coupe-type rear, looks like a
risk. However, the car is already on sale on the Continent. In its first
month on the market, Mercedes took 50,000 orders, and there is a
six-month waiting list in some countries, all of which shows that buyers
have accepted the new look without any qualms.
In the ''grid'' system which is usual these days, Mercedes offers the
E-class in three equipment levels named Classic, Elegance and
Avantgarde. Each is available with a choice of engines -- a two-litre, a
brand new 2.3, a 2.8 and a 3.2-litre size in pe trol units, as well as
2.5 and three-litre diesels. The 2.8 arrives in this country early next
year. Petrol and diesel engines alike have four-valve layouts.
Prices start at #23,500 for the E200 Classic and rise in stages to
#36,900 for the E320 Avantgarde. Diesel versions cost from #24,800 to
#29,600.
Traction control and dust-filtered air conditioning are among features
standard through the range, which bristles with electronic systems. Many
items of standard equipment on the new car were options on the old
E-class, something for which German manufacturers have often been
criticised.
However, there is also a fine array of extra-cost equipment for the
latest car, such as additional side-mounted airbags for the front
passenger cabin, an ultrasonic warning to help with parking in tight
spaces, and high-tech sensors which operate the wipers at speeds as
required by the rainfall.
In Mercedes terms, ESP does not mean extra-sensory perception, but
refers to an Electronic Stability Programme, available in the near
future. Essentially, this is an automatic braking system which cuts in
during situations where the driver has lost control.
From the middle of next year, the company's own auto-pilot
navigational system will also be available. Linked to a satellite global
positioning network already used by ships and aircraft, it is claimed to
be able to guide the driver to any location in Europe.

<TEXT>
WORLD champion Stephen Hendry took a swipe at the snooker authorities
after booking his place in the last 16 of the #330,000 Skoda Grand Prix
yesterday at Sunderland.
The Scot was angry after being forced to wait for 90 minutes before
finally getting his second-round match against Welshman Mark Bennett
under way.
And even a 5-2 victory -- during which Hendry again scored heavily --
failed to lift his black mood.
Hendry was scheduled to play at 2.30 but, with a couple of the morning
matches developing into marathons, he encountered a major delay.
''I think it's scandalous and I'm sure Mark felt the same way,'' fumed
Hendry.
''You get yourself psyched up then have to kick your heels. It's not
only affecting the players it's cheating the public.''
Hendry, a red hot favourite to capture his fourth grand prix title in
eight years, fell 2-1 behind before breaks of 75, 60, 58, 69 and a
closing frame clearance of 112 helped him comfortably avoid a shock
defeat.
''This result is a big relief,'' he admitted. ''I am playing really
well but by the time we started potting balls I wasn't looking forward
to the match. My concentration was terrible in the first few frames.''
Fergal O'Brien joined his Team Sweater Shop stablemate Hendry in the
televised phase of the event with an impressive 5-2 success over
Accrington-based Pakistani Shokat Ali.
O'Brien, who later described his opening four frames as ''flawless''
ran in breaks of 82, 63, 86 and 66. He now meets James Wattana, who
pulled off a great escape to edge Willie Thorne 5-4 in a nail-biting
clash.
Alan McManus, in the doldrums since he captured the Dubai Classic 13
months ago, scored his second comfortable victory of the event as he
booked a last 16 appearance by trouncing Blackpool's Andrew Cairns 5-1.
Three-times winner Steve Davis squeezed past Jason Ferguson 5-4 while
John Higgins continued the defence of his title with a 5-1 win over Neil
Foulds. Other results:
D Morgan (Wales) beat A Hamilton (England) 5-3; J Prince (N Ireland)
beat S Newbury (Wales) 5-3; P Ebdon (England) beat A Hicks (England)
5-2; J Swail (N Ireland) beat M Duffy (N Ireland) 5-1.

CRICKET
INDIA moved into a commanding position on the second day of the first
Test against New Zealand in Bangalore yesterday.
The tourists were precariously placed on 125 for five at the close, a
lead of just 42 in a match that has so far been dominated by the
bowlers.
Only Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin appeared to have mastered the
conditions with an innings of 87 as the home side earlier totalled 228
in reply to New Zealand's first innings 145.
India resumed on 81 for three, but as Azharuddin was nearing his
century New Zealand's pace bowlers fought back after lunch, led superbly
by Chris Cairns, who dismissed four batsmen in 13.4 overs -- including
Azharuddin -- giving away just eight runs.
India, in fact, lost their last six wickets for just 17 runs.
New Zealand fared no better. in their second innings, with opener
Bryan Young and Mark Greatbatch both out to medium pacer Manoj Prabhakar
for 8 and 16 respectively.
Adam Parore was next, falling to Javagal Srinath for three. Martin
Crowe hit five boundaries in his 68-minutes knock of 24 before
succumbing to Anil Kumble's spin, and Shane Thomson became Kumble's
second victim caught behind for 6 before Stephen (33no) and Cairns
(23no) led a late rally, adding 45 runs.

With better body control, the Vectra replaces the
Cavalier but keeps continuity, reports Ross Finlay
THIS being the opening week of the London Motor Show, rival
manufacturers are launching new models in the showrooms. There is always
a battle for attention on these crowded occasions.
Vauxhall did best in a Scottish context by having two Vectras, which
go on sale today, among the cars invited to be ''first across'' the Skye
Bridge at Monday's official opening. That was in company with a 1911
Prince Henry model and a 1936 BXL limousine.
Comparison with such early models is, of course, irrelevant to
consideration of the Vectra -- though this is a car with a historical
millstone round its neck, in the form of the Cavalier which it replaces.
The Vectra must be an acceptable mainstream product, like the
Cavalier. This has already made it a prime target for dismissive
comments on that TV programme which would prefer it to be something like
a five-seater Lamborghini.
Within GM Europe design, there is strong German direction from Opel,
and a British input from Vauxhall. The two nationalities respond
differently to certain stimuli. At the Vectra launch, Vauxhall personnel
were fairly comfortable with the word evolutionary, while pointing out
what a refined mid-Nineties design the new model is compared with the
Cavalier.
On the other hand, a German designer at whom the word was flung almost
staggered back, fumbling for some garlic to brandish at his attackers,
like the victim in a Dracula film.
The UK is certainly the focus of Vectra production. Vauxhall's Luton
factory can turn out 215,000 Vectras per year, and when the estate
models appear in 1996 they will all be built there.
Vauxhall initially offers the Vectra as a five-door hatchback or
four-door saloon, with six different engine specifications and five trim
and equipment levels. Prices range from #12,235 to #20,345, engines from
a 1.6-litre eight valve, via 1.6, 1.8 and two-litre 16-valve units, and
a 1.7 turbo diesel, to the top of the range 170bhp 2.5-litre V6.
In terms of price, especially when you take standard equipment levels
into account, the Vauxhall is very competitively placed. For instance,
the 1.8 LS, expected to be the biggest seller, has ABS, driver's seat
height adjustment and various other features all included in its #13,435
showroom price.
There are some interesting details on the Vectra, like the almost
lozenge-shaped door mirrors which do away with the need for twin-lens
''overtaking'' glasses, and the clock which works through the RDS system
to accept synchronising messages from the world's most accurate atomic
clock at Brunswick University in Germany.
Vauxhall's safety and security measures, and features like the
''neutral control'' which slips the transmission on the two-litre
automatic out of drive when the car stops, show that the company keeps
its eye on the development ball.
But, unless I missed something, the Vectra is still in the absurd
situation, for a mid-90s car, of having no steering wheel height
adjustment.
Shortish test runs in four different versions showed that the Vectra
provides much better body control than the Cavalier. Handling bias is
still towards understeer, and the chassis men were obviously under
instructions to go for secure handling rather than a sporting feel.
I drove to the Vectra introduction in a similarly-sized French car
with what was up till then the best ride quality in the class. That
still applies, because the Vectra is more fidgety over lumpy surfaces.
Cabin space, upholstery and trim patterns, and the whole presentation
of the car have all been perked up. A first glance at the luggage
compartment might not suggest much improvement there, but its
substantial capacity comes as much from its depth as from its length or
width.
On main and minor roads the Vectra is quieter and more controlled than
the Cavalier, which Vauxhall must hope we will all stop mentioning as a
comparison.
It is a refined, more solidly built and generally more economical car
which is certain to be regarded by many people -- whether the makers
like it or not -- as effectively the latest version of the Cavalier.

STEPHANIE Dallongeville shot a stunning six-under-par 66 yesterday to
lead after the first round of the 54-hole Spanish Open at La Manga.
She leads by two from Marie-Laure de Lorenzi, who is in a six-way tie
for second place which includes Britain's Wendy Dicks and Helen
Wadsworth. Scotland's Pam Wright is one further behind on 69.
Dallongeville, who gathered seven birdies in her round, won the
qualifying school tournament over the same course last March.
Wright, who had to pull out of the French Open with an injury last
week, had six birdies in her 69, the only problems coming when she took
three putts at the eighth then dropped another shot at the next hole.
Wright then birdied three of her next four holes before holing from 12
feet for her last birdie of the day at the sixteenth.
Sweden's Sofia Gronberg, one of the group on 68, and her English
husband moved house during the last two weeks when more than #7000 of
their belongings were stolen from a friend's garage. ''I need the money
to replace what was stolen, but worst of all our lawyer had cancelled
the insurance,'' explained Gronberg, who was troubled with whooping
cough for three months this year.
Gronberg matched par at each of the first 15 holes, birdied the next
two, then chipped in for an eagle 3 at the eighteenth. Leading scores
(British or Irish unless stated):
66 -- S Dallongeville (France).
68 -- S Gronberg (Sweden), M-L de Lorenzi (France), R Hetherington
(Australia), A Gottmo (Sweden), W Dicks, H Wadsworth.
69 -- P Wright, M Arruti (Spain), A Arruti (Spain), V Michaud
(France).
70 -- S Bennett, X Wunsch (Spain), L Freund (Belgium), L Hackney, C
Louw (S Africa), S Gustafson (Sweden), A Rogers, K Orum (Denmark), D
Dowling.
71 -- M Koch (Germany), L Lambert (Australia), R Bates (USA), B
Pestana (S Africa), G Stewart, D Booker (Australia), T Abitbol (Spain).
Other Scottish scores: 76 -- C Panton-Lewis. 78 -- L Irvine, J Forbes.
79 -- T Craik.

EUROPEAN TOUR PRE-QUALIFYING
THREE Scots will go to the final qualifying school for the European
Tour next month in Spain after Raymond Russell and Scott Henderson
topped their pre-qualifying schools and Stephen Gallacher finished
sufficiently high up in his, writes Gillian Dorricott.
Henderson, the 26-year-old assistant at Kings Links in Aberdeen, was
first at Peralada, carding a final three-under-par 69 for an impressive
total of 207.
Fellow Scot Alan Saddington was not so lucky. Having led the school
from the beginning, sharing the overnight lead with Henderson, he
notched up a disastrous 80 to blow his chances.
Russell shared victory at Emporda with Max Anglert, of Sweden, when he
slipped to a final round of 71 for a nine-under-par total. Walker Cup
player Stephen Gallacher posted a 72 to cruise home in joint seventh
place.
Leading qualifiers (*denotes amateurs):
Peralada: 207 -- S Henderson (Scotland) 70, 68, 69. 208 -- D Jones
(England) 69, 69, 70. 210 -- P Thorn (Sweden) 72, 66, 72.
Scottish non-qualifiers: 218 -- C Ronald 70, 75, 73; A Saddington 66,
72, 80. 219 -- A Hogg 71, 76, 72. 220 -- C Innes 78, 72, 70; *B Collier

* IT WAS understandable that one of the motoring weeklies captioned an
advance picture of the new Nissan Almera as a Sunny.
We were expecting a revamp of the model which has done well for Nissan
over the years, without being regarded as much more than
worthy-but-dull.
However, the Almera is a different car altogether. It is not just a
matter of the jazzier colours and more sporty image of the first models
to be available here, those features being an expression of Nissan's
sales imperative to appeal to younger buyers.
From the point of view of technical specification, passenger space,
styling, enjoyment at the wheel and highly competitive pricing, the
Almera is a car with a much more vigorous approach.
New cars are often designed with one particular rival in mind.
Nissan's own Primera was the benchmark for the Mondeo. In the case of
the Almera, the designers began by targeting the Golf, but eventually
upgraded their ride/handling requirements to try to match the Peugeot
306.
While the Micra and Primera are built in the UK, the Almera is a
Japanese product whose design team spent months co-operating with
colleagues in Europe, getting a feel for what features and suspension
characteristics would most appeal here.
The three-door has clean, sock-it-to-them styling, while the five-door
is obviously the result of somebody in the design studio reckoning that,
if the market could withstand the shock of the five-door Impreza, the
same approach was worth trying again .
Although the entry level Almera is the 1.4-litre Equation at #9295,
Nissan will be pushing hard to get the three-door 1.4-litre Si and the
five-door 1.6-litre SRi models out on the road after yesterday's
showroom launch.
These versions cost #10,495 and #12,395 respectively. If the test
cars' exterior colours of Alaska blue and loden green predominate in the
examples actually sold, you will certainly see them coming a long way
away. The more positive approach to interior styling also shows Nissan
in a far less cautious mood than it sometimes employs.
Nissan had two different locations for introducing the Almera to the
press. One was at the Amsterdam Show. With no disrespect intended, a
district where the steepest gradients are on the motorway access ramps,
and most of the road surfaces would look familiar to Stephen Hendry, is
no great testing ground.
The other was in the Yorkshire Dales, which made more sense for a
company trying to demonstrate that it has created a much livelier car
than the Sunny.
Driving around Wensleydale and Wharfedale showed a 1.4-litre
three-door Si to be quieter, friskier and noticeably better-riding than
the Sunny, and in the top level of its class, if not yet leading it.
It is simply not possible for anybody who enjoys driving to be in the
Yorkshire uplands without wanting to let it rip on their swooping,
dipping, long-view moorland roads.
In its sporting approach and level of control, the Almera showed that
the QX-style rear suspension, which it is the first smaller Nissan to
use, plus the standard anti-roll bars front and rear, are great
benefits, keeping more tyre rubber more squarely on the road.
A power output of 88bhp combined with sturdy build and fairly high
gearing allows the 1.4 to reach 60mph in about 13 seconds and go on to a
test track figure around 106mph. The 1.6-litre may have just 12bhp more,
but it feels much stronger in mid-range, as well as being able to trim
the 0-60mph time by a couple of seconds.
Potential buyers who automatically gave the Sunny the brush-off,
despite the success of company-backed competition cars like Alistair
McRae's British rally championship-winning GTi, should not treat the
Almera likewise. This is a very businesslike design even in a highly
competitive class.

ALONGSIDE Sam Torrance and Colin Montgomerie, the main players on the
Scottish side, Andrew Coltart would seem to occupy a bit part. But
yesterday in the first of the three Group matches in the Alfred Dunhill
Cup at St Andrews, Coltart emphatically upstaged his elders and betters
-- who could not have been more appreciative.
As Scotland swept aside the Republic of China 3-0, Coltart went round
the Old Course in 66, six under par and the lowest score returned in the
stiff south-west wind which gusted to 30mph. It beat Chen Liang-hsi by
seven and with Torrance's 75 winning by six and Montgomerie's 71 by
nine, the total margin was 22 strokes.
However, the most commendable victory was Ireland's, who by 3-0 and by
213 strokes to 217, beat the United States, also twice winners of the
event, for the third time in four years. In the same Group 1, Sweden
restored some order to perceived precedence with their 3-0 victory over
Canada, who 12 months ago became the least expected of the 10 winners so
far.
Coltart won all three of his games last year and in sustaining his
unblemished record improved on his previous best score over these
historic links, in July's Open Championship, by three strokes. The
25-year-old Dumfries-born professional made the settling start he
needed, three birdie 3s and a par 4 for a three-stroke lead.
Out in 32, Coltart led by seven, lost only the sixteenth, to a birdie
3, and completed an inward 34 with a pitch to eight feet for his sixth
birdie. This tournament is decided by medal matchplay, although one
silver-haired observer so far forgot himself as to ask about one player:
''Why is he holing out?''
In an outward half of 39, Torrance took three putts four times, his
upright stance dictated by his long-handled putter persistently buffeted
on the exposed greens. ''It was hard to ground the club close behind the
ball without accidentally hitting it,'' said Torrance.
His opponent, Lu Wen-teh, bogeyed seven of the inward holes to be home
in 43 to the par 36 of Torrance, who drove the home green. The Scottish
captain's victory could be important towards qualifying for Sunday's
semi-finals, for if two teams are tied on points after the group games
the country with most individual wins goes forward.
Montgomerie was seven strokes up after only six holes on Chung
Chun-hsing. By the end his left wrist was swollen, but the injury was no
impediment to success. Thus Torrance and Montgomerie, first and second
on the order of merit, cheerfully gave best to Coltart, more modestly
positioned in thirtieth place.
Although in Scotland's group South Africa beat Germany 2-1, Heinz
Peter Thul, Sven Struver, and Alexander Cejka were one up, one up, and
two up after six holes on Retief Goosen, David Frost, and Ernie Els
respectively. Frost could not retrieve his position, Els was hard
pressed to outlast his opponent, and Goosen proved his side's salvation.
Ireland simply outstayed their opponents. Lee Janzen, three behind
Darren Clarke with eight to play, squared with one of seven birdie 3s
gained at the seventeenth only to cut his last drive out of bounds.
Ronan Rafferty and Philip Walton, a tremulous hero of the Ryder Cup
singles, then also finished the stronger. At the penultimate hole
Rafferty made a 45-footer for 3 which Ben Crenshaw matched from 10 feet,
but to remain one behind. Then Walton claimed the scalp of Peter
Jacobsen with a pitch and run through the Valley of Sin to four feet.
The 68 of Michael Campbell over the course where he finished equal
third in the Open last summer, led New Zealand's 2-1 victory over Japan.
Also in Group 3, Nick Price's 67 and Mark McNulty's 69 not only helped
Zimbabwe to a 3-0 success over Wales but to the day's lowest team
aggregate of 209, seven under par.
When Greg Norman, the world's No.1, lost 72-75 to Jose Coceres,
Australia achieved victory over Argentina through US PGA champion Steve
Elkington and, most crucially, Craig Parry. Level with Vicente Fernandez
with two play, Parry made a 20-foot birdie putt at the seventeenth, and
although Fernandez holed from the same distance to birdie the last,
Parry's pitch to four feet matched him.
In the same Group 4, Ignacio Garrido's pitch to six feet for a 3 at
the last beat Howard Clark to decide the match between England and
Spain.

SCOTLAND's first ''right to die'' case will be heard at the Court of
Session next month.
Lord Cameron will hear legal arguments in the case involving Mrs Janet
Johnston, who has been in a coma for the past three years. The hearing
has been set down for November 29 and is expected to last for three
days.
Mrs Johnston, 50, of Allanton, near Shotts, is being kept alive by
means of a feeding tube and is in a persistent vegetative state with no
hope of recovery.
Law Hospital in Carluke, and Mrs Johnston's family, are agreed that
she should be allowed to die with dignity and will seek the court's
permission to withdraw the feeding system.
In the Tony Bland case in England, Mr Bland was in a persistent
vegetative state following injuries sustained at the Hillsborough
disaster and the House of Lords ruled that his artificial feeding could
be withdrawn.
The hospital trust decided to take Mrs Johnston's case to the Court of
Session because the legal position in Scotland is not clear.
Last month, the Scottish Law Commission published proposals that would
bring Scots law into line with England and free doctors from any risk of
prosecution or civil action in cases like Mrs Johnston's.
The commission recommended legislation to make it clear that there is
no absolute obligation on doctors to prolong life regardless of the
circumstances or the quality of the life.

SHIRES High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust (Shirescot) performed in
line with the All-Share Index during its third quarter to end-September.
The investment trust's 7.4% total return on net assets was only
marginally adrift of the 8.0% return on the All-Share.
During the nine months to end-September, Shirescot's fully-diluted net
asset value rose 9.1% to 149.8p.
The Glasgow Investment Managers-run trust, with shareholders' funds of
#31m and #9.9m of gearing, took dividends for the year to date to 3.75p
with the declaration of a 1.25p third interim payout.
This compares with cumulative dividends of 3.6p at the same stage last
year and Shirescot's total payout for the current 12 months should be at
least 5.7p.

ROB Andrew, who announced his decision to quit the international scene
yesterday, began his England career as a match-winning, fresh-faced
Cambridge student back in January 1985. Last June he was again England's
kicking hero when he landed a drop kick halfway across Cape Town to
defeat Australia in the World Cup quarter-finals.
Andrew is still fresh-faced, but he has changed from a white-shirted
kicking supremo to a business-suited rugby director at Newcastle, with
the result that he has lost the part-time job as Wasps stand-off.
Andrew will be criticised for deciding to quit abruptly, but he has
learnt to live with criticism. During his 70-cap career, England tried
to ease him out with more flamboyant players like Les Cusworth -- now
England's coach -- and Stuart Barnes. But Andrew always came back.
On his debut, Andrew landed a drop kick against Romania in the second
minute of the match and collected 18 of England's 22 points. In the
middle of his career he was a hit-and-miss goal-kicker and England had
to employ experts like Jonathan Webb, Simon Hodgkinson and Jonathan
Callard in that department. Geoff Cooke, England manager in March, 1994,
dropped Callard and promoted Andrew to chief goalkicker.
Since then his accuracy has won a succession of Test matches. He
hammered in all 18 points for England on his goal-kicking return in that
Paris match last year and he scored an English-record 27 points when
Carling's men beat South Africa in the first Test last year.
Against Canada he kicked 30 points to equal the World record. He
monopolised the scoring when England beat Scotland and then Argentina,
scoring 24 points each time.
He ignited the sporting nation with that drop kick against the
Wallabies, and was confidently expected to provide more of the same this
season -- high class goal-kicking, tackling beyond the call of duty and
collaboration with the forwards. But frequent linking with the backs
outside him was not his first option. Andrew has scored only two tries
for England.
He was never a running stand-off, but England simply cannot now
replace a man who has become the hub of the team. He was one of the
organisers of Grand Slams in 1991, 1992 and 1995 as well as piloting
England in the World Cup final in 1991.
He is called ''Squeaky'' by his colleagues, as in squeaky clean.
Lately, he has acquired the added tag of ''Golden Boots.''
* A CHANCE meeting between a Scot and a New Zealander in the United
States earlier this year has proved beneficial to GHK. The sequel is
that Andrew Pope has been attracted to Old Anniesland, and he has
arrived in time to help to bail GHK out of their second-row problems.
Pope -- who hails from Invercargill, which is as far as you can go in
the world from Glasgow -- met Cammy Little, the GHK scrum half, while
they were playing rugby in Colorado. When Pope arrived in London to
continue his world rugby tour, he decided that Scotland would be more
preferable to England.
GHK have promoted him to replace the injured Kenny Wilson at lock for
the premier second-division match against Currie at Malleny Park
tomorrow.
* GRAHAM Dall's run in captaincy in youth rugby continues when he
leads a Scotland under-21 team against New Zealand Rugby News XV at
Riverside Park, Jedburgh, on November 1. Teams:

<HEADLINE>Troubled conglomerate will make big provisions after posting half-time deficit of #45.6m. Trafalgar House warns of larger loss</HEADLINE>

TRAFALGAR House yesterday confirmed the City's worst fears and warned
that the overall operating loss in the second half will be considerably
larger than that in the first half of #45.6m.
It compounded the misery by adding that substantial provisions will be
made to cover the costs of restructuring chiefly at the minerals and
metals engineering subsidiaries.
City analysts are speculating that the total deficit including
provisions could be as high as #200m.
The statement was forced out of the unwilling company by the sharp
fall in the share price on Wednesday which saw a low at one point of 17p
before closing at 21p.
Chief executive Nigel Rich said no decision had been taken on the
payment of dividends on either the Ordinary or the 6[3/4]% Cumulative
Preference shares. But on the basis of information currently available
it is doubtful any payment will be made.
Fortunately the semi-annual Prefence dividend will be rolled up
against that time when cash flow will be sufficient to allow payment.
In recent weeks, support for the shares has been dribbling away but
earlier this week rumours intensified that the Jardine Matheson
controlled Hong Kong Land subsidiary which has a direct 26% stake which
can rise to 29% had lost confidence.
However, Mr Rich said Hong Kong Land had confirmed that it remains a
long-term investor and is supportive of action management is taking.
That helped the share price to recover [3/4]p to 21[3/4]p on a
turnover of just under 30 million shares worth about #6m.
The hardest-hit activities include power engineering which is being
rationalised to concentrate on lower risk manufacturing. John Brown,
although probably the world's fourth largest engineering company, has no
unique product in this sector and has run into problems at the Keadby
power station.
The Davy minerals business has had a tough time in both the UK and
France. Some of the group's heaviest reorganisation is taking place in
France especially in the Sofresid engineering operation.
The class action brought by predominantly American passengers on the
QE2 after its disasterous refit is near solution -- there was a #7.5m
provision against that in the first half.
Altogether about 1500 jobs have been lost in the year which ended on
September 30.
No-one from Trafalgar would speak yesterday about the statement on the
grounds that all the figures for the financial year have still to be
calculate and will be released on December 15.
However, there has been an improvement in the net debt position over
that in March when it totalled #248m.
That will be further helped once the #75m is received from the sale of
the Ritz Hotel to the Barclay Brothers. In addition, some peripheral an
non-core activities will be sold and these disposals are expected to be
announced soon.
Encouragingly, Mr Rich said the construction and engineering order
books have held up well and he has a clear understanding of what needs
to be done to get the group back to satisfatory profitability.
It seems that Trafalgar, and Hong Kong Land, are prepared for the long
haul of trading back to profitability. The balance sheet appears not to
be in that much difficulty while asset sales such as Ideal Homes or,
possibly more likely, the Cunard shipping interests including the QE2
could find a new home without too much difficulty even if their age may
tell against them.
It is a hazardous suggestion, but the shares may well have passed
their worst.

About 1.4 million notices were wrong, 7% of the total despatched.
Investigation, audit and reviews resulted in #6100m of tax being

THE Government will take some comfort from the September money supply
expansion of the broader measure, M4, which takes in bank and building
society lending as well as coins.
A rise of 0.4% over the month was a shade less than the market was
predicting and left the year-on-year increase at 8.2%, down from 8.5% in
the year to August. It compares with a target range of 3% to 9% but
while it is still not far off the top end, it is the first fall in the
annual rate since January.
The Treasury will be hoping that the monetary growth, which had
worried both the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England at
their monetary meeting on September 7, is now easing.
Commenting on the figures, a Treasury spokesman said: ''This data,
along with other indicators, is consistent with a low inflation outlook
and obviously will be taken into account, along with other data, in the
next monetary meeting.''
Actual M4 lending rose by #4100m in the month compared with #2200m in
August but most of this was accounted for by lending to the financial
sector which stood at #810m in September against a repayment of #866m in
August. The British Bankers' Association said there was a return to
borrowing by financial companies (in particular leasing companies) and
overall lending was fairly buoyant in September.
However, on the personal side, mortage lending was 9% down on August
while consumer credit again showed a decline from the previous month.
This lack of consumer interest is also reflected in the September
lending figures from the building societies. Gross mortgage lending
dipped from #2975m to #2725m over the month, net mortgage advances to
#614m from #750m net new commitments dropped from #2726m to #2565m.
Commenting on the lending figures, Adrian Coles, director-general of
the Building Societies Association, said: ''The figures for September
continue to present a rather gloomy picture of the housing and mortgage
market. Figures for the third quarter were no more encouraging and net
lending at its lowest level since Q1 1993.''
He pointed out, though, that the lack of confidence in the market is
at present underlined by uncertainty ahead of the Budget as prospective
purchasers wait to hear if the Chancellor will announce any measures to
help the housing market. ''A decisive move to help homeowners by
reducing the transactions costs of moving house through the removal of
stamp duty would go some way to turning hopes of a recovery in the new
year into fact,'' he added.
Meanwhile, Cornerston, Britain's largest independent chain of estate
agents, has fallen victim to the malaise still seen in much of the
housing market with the calling in of administrative receivers from
Ernst &amp; Young. Cornerstone, the subject of a management buyout from
Abbey National in 1993 when it owned 347 branches, now has 200 branches
employing 1500 people.
It had already put together a packet of measures to sell rival agents
two-thirds of its branches. However, the company was making substantial
losses at the time of the buyout and since then transaction volumes have
slumped even further.

RECEIVERSHIPS in the UK are running at their lowest level since 1989,
according to figures released yesterday by accountancy firm KPMG. There

In Scotland, there were 23 receiverships in the latest three months, a

THE Faculty of Advocates is facing a crucial vote on whether it should

There is strong opposition in the 370-strong faculty from those who
think it would be tantamount to professional suicide to offer training
in courtroom skills to solicitor-advocates, who have already taken a
substantial slice of advocates' work over the past three years.
However, a significant number of advocates feel that, by offering
training, the Bar would be seen to be acting in the public interest by
raising the standard of pleading in Scottish courts.
The divergence of views has already become clear after a vote taken
earlier this month by the faculty council on whether to recommend that
training should be made available to solicitor-advocates.
The Herald understands that the vote was divided evenly, 4-4, and that
the dean of the faculty, Mr Andrew Hardie, QC, cast his vote against the
motion on the basis that the leader of the Bar traditionally favours the
status quo. Mr Hardie is understood to feel that such an important issue
can be taken only by the members of the faculty as a whole.
The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990 allowed
solicitors with at least five years' experience in court practice to
apply for rights of audience in the higher courts, subject to passing an
exam and a training and assessment course.
So far, 78 solicitors have qualified as solicitor-advocates and appear
daily in the High Court and, to a lesser extent, the Court of Session.
Over the past two years, the faculty has been involved in setting up
an intensive training programme for its own members, taught mainly by
members of the faculty. A one-month full-time training programme in
advocacy skills for new advocates was launched at the beginning of this
month.
The course is being taught on a voluntary basis by more than 50
members of the faculty, and there is a feeling that some might be less
than enthusiastic about devoting their spare time to teaching
solicitor-advocates.
The dean of faculty told The Herald: ''There has been discussion
within the faculty about the possibility of extending our training
programme to solicitors and more particularly to solicitor-advocates.
''That discussion has arisen as a result of an apparent interest on
the part of solicitor-advocates to avail themselves of, and to have
access to, the faculty's training courses which have been developed for
the benefit of its members and those wishing to become members.
''There have been a number of internal discussion documents designed
to canvass all possible arguments.''
Mr Hardie said the faculty was ''obviously flattered'' that
solicitor-advocates recognised its teaching expertise but added: ''The
priority for the faculty's resources must be its own members and
intrants.''
He stressed that many individual members of the faculty had already
helped the Law Society with the training and assessment of solicitors
who had applied to qualify as solicitor-advocates. Others were
professors of law, lecturers and tutors at Scottish universities.

YORKSHIRE Electricity is planning to return #180m to shareholders
through a special #1 dividend and has promised to increase normal
dividends by 10% in the current financial year and in 1999-97.
The group has also confirmed that it intends to distribute the benefit
of most of its 9.2% holding in National Grid to shareholders and also to
give a discount to domestic customers.
Chief executive Malcolm Chatwin said the move was the next stage of
the group's programme of delivering value for shareholders, though the
City believes the real motive is to see off a possible predator.
Further details regarding the National Grid holding, thought to be
worth some #270m, and the customer discount will be announced shortly.
The dividend payouts are expected to raise Yorkshire's gearing to 100%
and dividend cover will come down to 1.5. Interest cover will be between
four and five times. The reduction in the group's financial strength
will be reflected in its share price so that the windfall for
shareholders will be partly offset by a lower share price. Yesterday
they dipped 15p tp 899p.
Yorkshire points out that since 1991 it has increased dividends by 15%
year-on-year and paid a special 90p dividend last January. This has
reflected the increase in profits as costs have been reduced. It plans
to make further efficiency improvements.
The group goes on to state that domestic customers have seen prices
reduced by 15.7% in real terms and it claims they have some of the
lowest bills in the country. Prices will fall further as result of the
regulator's recent review and increasing competition. Yorkshire is
obliged to reduce its price by 14% in nominal terms this financial year
and 13% next.
The group's strategy, according to Mr Chatwin, is to win profitable
market shaare in the electricity and gas supply markets and expand its
generation interests in the niche markets where it has competitive
advantage.

Mike Ingham reports on Government move to trim beef export aid as New
Zealand lamb floods in.
THE Government is trying to persuade the European Commission to
restrict subsidies on beef exports, a move that would probably not
affect cattle producers directly but might take some of the heat out of
the pork and mutton markets.
Action to make exporting less attractive is needed because strong
sales of meat to markets outside the Community and the rundown of
intervention stocks have combined to cause serious shortages and high
prices in parts of the beef trade.
Cutting subsidies might cause some embarrassment for the Government
because it has spent years encouraging the industry to develop export
markets. But meat manufacturing companies have convinced ministers that
a change in policy is essential.
The problem is most acute for firms making cooked beef products such
as pies and ready meals. These companies traditionally rely on
intervention stores of raw material, but EU stocks are nearly exhausted.
Only about 10,000 tonnes remain in store, against almost 170,000 tonnes
last autumn.
Yet Brussels continues to pay subsidies of up to #2.50 per kg to
exporters selling similar manufacturing-grade beef to markets outside
the EU.
Processing companies which have been lobbying for an end to the
subsidies point to a further contradiction in policy -- while the
Commission is funding handouts for the exports, it is simultaneously
reintroducing an emergency scheme for levy-free imports to ease the
manufacturing beef shortage.
Food Minister Angela Browning conceded the necessity of a policy
change when speaking at the British Meat Manufacturers' Association
lunch in London this week.
''The rundown of intervention stocks means manufacturers have lost a
valuable source of supply,'' the Minister said. ''I have no wish to see
those stocks build up again. But I am anxious to see a balanced beef
market.
''I agree that export subsidies should be properly targeted and that
it is not sensible to encourage, at very high cost, the export of
material for which there is strong demand within the Community.''
Mrs Browning told the manufacturers that the Government had presented
to the Commission their case for a change in the system that would make
some manufacturing grade beef flank ineligible for subsidies.
''The Commission now appears to accept the force of our argument and
we can expect a proposal in the coming weeks.''
The Minister also said she was fairly confident of securing a change
in the tendering procedures for cheap imported manufacturing beef --
another move which would tend to raise the prices of some beef, as well
as manufacturing grade mutton and pork.
A further significant point made by Mrs Browning was a restatement of
the Government's tough line against abattoir operators which do not
upgrade their plants to EU standards. Manufacturers fear unfair
competition if plants which do not meet the standards are given a
further extension of time to upgrade -- though many producers feel the
imposition of tougher standards will reduce competition for stock and
perhaps force higher marketing costs on to the livestock sector.
''We have made it clear there will be no general extension of the
deadline for those premises which have not complied,'' said Mrs
Browning. She warned that ''we shall take action to revoke the
licences'' of operators which cannot prove failure to reach the new EU
standards is due to factors outside their control.

SCOTLAND'S oil and gas industry is alive and well and has a strong
future with major spin-offs for industry and the community, a top oil
boss claimed last night.
Greg Bourne, director of BP Scotland, backed up his remarks when he
pointed out that his company had so much confidence in the in the
industry that BP would be spending between #80m and #100m annually in
upgrading their petro-chemical plant at Grangemouth.
But last night a BP spokesman at Grangemouth said: ''The expenditure
planned for Grangemouth is part of a long-term, ongoing improvement
programme.''
Mr Bourne, was delivering the annual Scottish Business Lecture, held
by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, in Glasgow.
He told his audience that Scotland's oil and gas industry had a future
well into the next century.
He said that over the last few years the yearly value of the offshore
markets to suppliers and contractors had been around #8000m to #9000m.
At the same time he gave a ray of hope to young people for the future
and said: ''There is a real value for our skilled young people in the
opportunity to stay in Scotland. This is a new and valuable option not
available to previous generations.''
He backed up his views with an array of facts and figures on how he
see the future of the oil and gas industry.
Mr Bourne said:' 'Government figures for the UK's Contintental Shelf
show there could be as much as 2075 million tonnes of oil remaining to
be produced for known discoveries.
''That's over 15 billion barrels, compared to 13 billion barrels
already produced. And they estimate total remaining oil reserves could
be as high as seven billion tonnes or over 50 billion barrels''
He added: ''The figures for gas are equally encouraging --1915 billion
cubic metres still to be developed and up to 4797 billion cubic metres
in total still to be recovered. About 982 billion cubic metres have been
produced to date.''
He pointed out that for five out of the last six years, the Scottish
economy had grown faster than the UK as a whole. He added: ''I believe
the real value lies not only in what we have achieved so far in the
North Sea but in the opportunity we have created for an even more and
productive future.''
Mr Bourne said he could easily have been speaking about the demise of
the oil and gas industry if it had not faced up to lower prices and
intense competition from new sources around the world which had involved
developing new technology, reducing operating costs in mature fields,
and the costs of bringing new fields into production.
He said: ''I believe there is real value for our country, and perhaps
other industries, in looking at how the North Sea industry achieved that
transformation.''

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
New York, Thursday -- AT&amp;T Corporation, whose massive Dundee plant
supplies 27% of the world's cash dispensers, announced yesterday that
its third-quarter net income had plunged 75% to $262m, reflecting a
previously announced charge related to its struggling computer
operation.
AT&amp;T, which has announced that it is splitting itself into three
companies, said that without the charge, it earned $1430m, or 90 cents a
share in the period.
''This quarter's charge aside, our profits reached an all-time high on
solid revenue growth,'' chairman Robert Allen said.
The company said revenues climbed 5.7% to $19.7bn from $18.65bn,
fuelled primarily by growth in long-distance and wireless services
revenues, as well as increases from financial services, microelectronics
components and business telephone systems.
AT&amp;T's Dundee plant, which employs 1400 people, comes within the
financial delivery systems division of Global Information Solutions,
which is being spun off to shareholders. Another 100 people are employed
by this division at Dalgety Bay, Fife.
The Scottish operations avoided most of the sweeping staff cuts within
Global Information Solutions.
AT&amp;T's net income in the year-ago quarter was $1050m, or 67 cents a
share.
That quarter, reflecting the merger with McCaw Cellular, included
one-time merger expenses and other non-recurring charges, which reduced
earnings by about $230m, or 15 cents per share.
The current third-quarter profits of $262m equalled 16 cents a share.
The company said a cost-cutting initiative announced previously by its
computer business, Global Information Solutions, resulted in a pre-tax
charge of $160m. -- Reuter.

SPECIALIST engineers Rubicon Group, which has about 760 Scottish
employees, is buying the Calder specialist castings to magnets company
for #94m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
In addition, is is raising #15m for general purposes.
Rubicon arose from the remains of Courtney Pope and is a major
supplier of sub-assemblies for personal computers with the Beith plant
supplying IBM and Compaq with chassis frames as does HSP Strathclyde in
Hamilton. Its Sheffield subsidiary makes ATM safes while another in
Wandsworth, south London, produces other computer components as well as
Kango hammers.
Calder is a #72m management buy-in of the specialist castings,
magnets, lead products and aluminium alloys operations of Cookson in
March 1994. That was led by Jim Cooper who with 30 others put up just
#300,000 between them and are receiving a total of #18m.
It is believed that Mr Cooper will be gain more than #3m, mostly in
the form of 1.5 million Rubicon shares which were suspended at 180p
yesterday morning ahead of the announcement. He becomes managing
director operations for the whole group and will be based at Hamilton.
Encouragingly, David Carruthers who is deputy chief executive of the
highly successful T&amp;N automotive components group will become chairman
of Rubicon in place of George Duncan who is standing down. That reflects
the strategy of becoming a niche supplier to the car industry as well as
in information technology and white goods.
Calder which achieved operating profits of #6.9m in the first half of
this year on turnover of #102m compared with #8.1m for the whole of 1994
has a strong balance sheet and is highly cash generative from the lead
sheeting and from the aluminium diecasting for the automotive industry
while significantly widening Rubicon's customer base. It will provide
outlets in France, Germany, Holland and Ireland and raise the total
workforce to 3000.
Rubicon's profits in the year to May rose 64% to #3.68m on turnover of
#56.8m.
Around 52 million new shares are being issued at 168p. Public
shareholders are being offered at total of 9.7 million shares under a
clawback arrangement on the basis of five new shares for every 12 they
currently hold.
A similar number of shares are available through intermediaries.
The Stock Exchange quotation will be restored on November 14 following
shareholder approval of the KPMG Corporate Finance inspired deal.
That is expected to be earnings enhancing above existing market
forecasts of 12.4p per share. The additional funds will be used to build
a factory in the US to supply IBM, Compaq, and Digital.

The new editor of Granta tells Gavin Bell that clarity is the key to
success
IF James Joyce had submitted Finnegan's Wake to the literary magazine
Granta, he would not have been encouraged by the response. ''I don't
think people in this office would have been leaping up and down and
saying 'let's publish it','' says Granta's new editor, Ian Jack. ''We'd
be saying 'Can we have a bit of order here, and a bit more clarity
please, Mr Joyce? Can we have some paragraphs and full stops? Can we
make the narrative stronger?' ''
An aversion to the obscurity of Joyce's prose is central to the
editorial policy of Jack, a distinguished Scots journalist who took
charge of the magazine earlier this year. Clarity of style has always
been an essential ingredient of Granta, along with a commitment to
innovative writing, and it is a tradition he intends to maintain.
''There may be a perception that we publish writing that is new in the
sense that it is unfamiliar, mainly or partly because of its
construction. But that has never been true, and it's certainly not true
now. I am a great believer in clarity. I believe good writing is a way
of looking at and describing the world. I think that is what Granta has
been good at, and what it should be good at now.''
They are the kind of sentiments one would expect from a man who has
come up through the ranks of daily journalism, rather than graduating
from the ivory towers of literature. Born of Scottish parents in
Lancashire, where his father was a mechanic in a cotton mill, Jack came
to Scotland as a child and was raised in the shadow of the Forth Bridge
at North Queensferry.
From his window, he watched ships heading out to sea and dreamed of
being a deck officer. Eventually he embarked on a more prosaic career as
a librarian, but he soon changed course to become a trainee reporter
with regional newspapers in the Herald group. At the time he was an
active member of CND, and above the fireplace of his bedsit in Glasgow
was an encouraging quotation from Camus: ''Man, on the whole, is more
good than bad''. Jack recalls: ''The early sixties were optimistic
times.''
At least in his own case, the optimism was justified. A successful
career in journalism culminated in his being appointed editor of the
Independent on Sunday in 1989, a post which he held with distinction
until moving to Granta last May.
The frustrations of producing a national newspaper with severely
limited resources, the attractions of editing a respected literary
magazine, and a desire to spend more time with his two young children,
were all factors in his decision. ''I was happy to come here, and I am
happy to be here,'' he says.
''Here'' is a small suite of offices in what looks like a converted
warehouse at the end of a lane, behind a pub, in quiet area of Islington
in north London. On the first floor, Jack emerges from behind a big,
untidy desk as a big, untidy man with a dark beard and an errant
shirt-tail flapping out of his trousers. He is a thoughtful, amiable man
with none of the shallow abrasiveness cultivated by some less-talented
newspaper editors.
He cares about good writing, and is said to be adept at getting the
best out of his contributors. Thus he is probably ideally suited to
Granta, a curious hybrid that claims to be a magazine but looks like a
book. Although it is edited and widely read in Britain, it is published
and sells most of its copies (about 100,000) in the United States.
Produced four times a year, it is a selection of the latest writing by
authors such as Julian Barnes, William Boyd, and Germaine Greer. It
featured Salman Rushdie and Milan Kundera long before they became
best-selling authors, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez before he won the Nobel
Prize.
Ian Jack is perfectly comfortable with this glittering legacy,
providing nobody calls it literature. Both he and his predecessor Bill
Buford, who has gone to edit New Yorker magazine, have a healthy
scepticism about the word ''literature'', bordering on distaste. ''It
has a kind of holy and pious sound to it, which is certainly not how I
feel about writing and books,'' he says. ''I don't have an academic
approach to it.''
What he does have is admiration for the successful formula developed
by Buford -- an eclectic collection of fiction, reportage, biography,
history, and travel writing. Applying the ''if it ain't broke, don't fix
it'' adage, he has no intention of meddling with Granta for the sake of
personal aggrandisement.
''Of course it will change, because things are organic, but the idea
of deliberately changing it, to draw attention to the fact that I am
editing it, seems to me not a very wise thing to do. It's smart and
attractive, and it's published some amazingly good writing, so why
should I change it?''
Subscribers to Granta may discern a subtle new trend, however, in the
current issue. Half of the contributors are women, writing about men.
''I don't want to sound like a humbugging feminist,'' he says, ''but it
seems to me only right that we should feature more women writers because
there are many more of them around today writing good stuff.''
A harder cutting edge on political issues is also likely to emerge in
the magazine, reflecting its new editor's left-of-centre views. ''I
think good writing tends to be oppositional, it tends to flourish when
it has something to oppose,'' he says. ''So I imagine we will become
slightly more political in a broad sense.''
Something worth opposing, in his opinion, is the free market system:
''I don't believe that it is the mechanism that will achieve global
happiness like no other. I think it will come unstuck in many ways quite
soon.'' To help it on its way, he has commissioned a piece from a
distinguished Harvard professor on the cause of famines.
Another enterprising move being considered by Jack is to produce a
''Caledonian issue'' of Granta, featuring the best of contemporary
Scottish writing.
''It's remarkable how a few gurus from Glasgow and elsewhere have
suddenly shown that you can be this thing called a writer and live in
Scotland. They seem to be all over the place now. A lot of people keep
saying to me we must do an issue of Scottish writers, and maybe we
should. The writing is certainly said to be good, and I find this
interesting.''
In the meantime, he will continue Granta's international quest for
literary clarity and wit on any subject of interest. Acolytes of Joyce
need not apply.

THE electricity bonanza rolls on with each generous handout to
shareholders from the regional companies (RECs) confirming yet again how
absurdly cheaply the industry was sold off.
Yorkshire's #450m package for shareholders is clearly designed to
dissuade a bidder through dissipating some of the gains a predator could
achieve. The group is thought to be one of the more attractive of the
regional electricity companies. However, it might do exactly the
opposite in encouraging a bidder to pounce before the special dividend
is paid around the turn of the year.
The handout still leaves some room for a higher payment should a bid
emerge though only through raising gearing above 100%. Another #200m
would leave it around 130%. These levels of gearing would be
unacceptable in a normal company but utilities with a monopoly are
special cases as they have virtually guaranteed cash flow to pay down
the extra borrowing over time.
While the share price would fall to reflect a worse financial
position, shareholders would still be gainers overall. Still, to borrow
money from the banks to hand over to shareholders remains a rum thing to
do but then the whole electricity saga has a certain Alice in Wonderland
feel about it.
Shareholders in the RECs have done well enough not to be rewarded with
the whole of the #3000m plus value of the National Grid on top of
everything else.
The Government has the means to ensure a more equitable distribution
of this windfall. It has a golden share in the Grid and could use this
to force the RECs to give at least part of the increase in the Grid's
value from its nominal #1200m worth on privatisation to customers or
even to help finance a tax cut.
Now that's an idea . . .
Fall guy
THE totally unexpected sacking of John Marshall leaves a sour taste in
the mouth and the feeling that he is nothing other than the fall guy for
the many misfortunes that have befallen John Mowlem in recent years.
Certainly the near #32m exceptional losses for the first six months
came as a major blow to investor confidence in a company which had
depended totally upon the goodwill of its bankers and an emergency #63m
rights issue in March last year after it had run up #124m of losses.
Part of the price for that support was the booting upstairs of then
chairman and chief executive Sir Philip Beck on a part time basis with
Mr Marshall being formally appointed to the executive role in August.
The final parting with the Beck family took place this June when Sir
Philip retired and was replaced by the highly respecte Laporte chairman
Ken Minton.
Yesterday's parting of the ways could be seen as his taking a decisive
strategy move. He said it is plain and simple. The sooner some
loss-making businesses go the better -- that presumably includes the
London City Airport which is up for sale but there seem to be an absence
of eager buyers.
However, Mr Minton did not appear to be supportive of the idea that
there are simply too many players in the construction industry.
Almost all can claim they have specialisations which others envy. But
these are seldom sufficient to carry the rest of the construction and
contracting activities at a time when there is simply no sign of light
on the horizon and gloomy statements that 100,000 jobs will disappear.
One of cited reasons for there not having been substantial
rationalisation and mergers has been the fierce independence of many of
the participants. But with the Becks departed, that holds little water
as far as Mowlem is concerned.
Step forward
SCOTTISH Amicable's European strategy has taken a major step forward
with the opening of a marketing and servicing office in Frankfurt with
which to attack the German life market.
Germany is the obvious country to go for as it has 80 million people
and a conservative industry which leaves room for UK expertise in more
innovative products. The main problem is that the big banks have a
strong grip on the market although financial advisers still account for
a third.
ScotAm will target the adviser market and will build up a salesforce
gradually over the next few years. The initial target is suitably
modest, with 30 to 40 broker consultants working out of five branches.
The hope is to secure up to 1% of the market.
The trend in Germany is away from conventional products towards the
greater flexibility of unit-linked plans. Clive Cowdery, managing
director of Scottish Amicable International, the Dublin-based subsidiary
which will run the operation, sees the unit-linked sector doubling in
five years.
The products will be designed and serviced from Dublin, which can be
likened to a manufacturing centre serving distribution points in Europe.
These will eventually include Greece, Italy and Spain.
This approach has been made possible by European Union rules which
allow for example a British company to sell in another and be regulated
in the UK.
Germany looks quite a low-risk venture which policyholders will be
glad to know because if it all went horribly wrong they would foot the
bill.
As it is ScotAm has invested #27m so far and expects to repay setting
up costs within five years. Only when the business is profitable will
policyholders actually benefit from the move.

CONSTRUCTION
THE popular and well-liked John Marshall has resigned as chief
executive of the John Mowlem construction and scaffolding group. He is
being succeeded by John Gains who currently heads the construction
division.
Market reaction was sympathetic with Mowlem shares dropping 8p to a
new low of 53p at one point before recovering to close 3p off at 58p.
Recently appointed chairman Ken Minton, who also heads the Laporte
chemicals group, said Mr Marshall had done some good things for Mowlem
since he was appointed in August 1994. He became a director in 1989.
However, during the past few weeks the two had had ''some good chats''
and decided that they should separate. Mr Minton added that there have
been no significant negatives since the interim statement.
That showed a swing into losses of #31.8m arising from a #14m charge
for unsuccessful litigation with Eagle Star over the construction of the
Carlton Gate property in London. The closure of the BauTec construction
business in Germany, the French contract scaffolding operations, and the
elimination of loss making parts of the engineering division altogether
cost #17.8m.
Mowlem is a significant player in the Scottish construction sector
with a presence going back 50 years. It recently bought the building
division of Scottish Homes for #2m and is building a #15m leisure centre
at Greenock.
Mr Marshall will receive compensation of just over #200,000
representing about 15 months salary.

NINETY percent of new jobs created in the UK over the year till June
were part-time, according to a study by the General, Municipal, and
Boilermakers Union.
Using Government statistics, the GMB found that 49% of the new
part-timers were women. In Scotland, job losses outweighed job creation.
The official figures show Scotland had a net loss of 19,000 jobs over
the year, with north-east England the only other region recording a 5000
deficit.
The areas with the biggest net gains were London (51,000) and the
South-west (45,000). They contributed to a UK gain of 250,000 jobs,
221,000 part-time and 121,000 filled by women part-timers.
The findings were presented to the GMB's Equal Rights Conference in
Manchester yesterday where national officer Ms Donna Covey said they
underlined the need for improvements in women's pay.

support of public services. A special train leaves Glasgow at 11pm
tonight via Edinburgh for Scottish marchers.

EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP SCOTLAND
A NEW body aimed at encouraging workers to invest in their own futures
and develop employee ownership in Scotland was yesterday launched at a
forum of business people in Glasgow.
Employee Ownership Scotland, has the backing of local authorities, the
Scottish Office, and Local Enterprise Companies, and replaces the former
Scottish Co-operatives Development Company.
Already one small firm, Glendale Knitwear, of Kirkintilloch, has
benefited from the expertise offered by EOS.
Glendale was born after Courtaulds closed its subsidiary company Glen
Alva Knitwear of Kilsyth with the loss of 80 jobs.
But two redundant employees teamed up with a designer and launched
Glendale earlier this year to provide knitwear for schools and fashions
for the Sears Group, which includes Miss Selfridge.
In December they plan to launch their own brand of knitwear at the
Clothes Show being held in Birmingham in December.
Mary Hutton, of the firm's three directors, said yesterday: ''We are
delighted with the way things have worked out and the advice we were
given by EOS. They helped us produce a business plan, raise finance and
find premises. They were certainly a great help.''
The company started trading in January and have a #500,000 order book
which will keep them busy until Christmas.
Speaking at yesterday's forum in Glasgow City Chambers Mike Finlayson,
chief executive of EOS, said: ''The concept of employee ownership in
Scotland is becoming more and more attractive as a new business
opportunity.
''This is perhaps most dramatically demonstrated in rescue bids where
employees invest in their own future by securing ownership of companies
threatened with closure.
''There is no doubt that employee ownership can help stimulate birth
rate, enourage business growth, and guarantee the continuation of
family-owned businesses for future generations.
''Scotland can learn a great deal about employee ownership from
America where there are over 10,000 employee owned companies, and from
Japan where over 90% of companies have a significant level of employee
ownership.''
But Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Council
Development and Industry, gave a word of caution and said: ''A desire to
preserve your own job is powerful and noble but it is not enough.
''Success is only likely where the workforce take over a going concern
or where like-minded individuals come together to create a new business.
''In either event, there must be a unifying commitment by all
employees to the business and its customers.''
He added: ''Employee Ownership Scotland must equip itself to advise
and support groups of employees presented with such opportunities.''

<TEXT>
EXTRA supplies of New Zealand lamb are being rushed to Britain as
importers try to rebuild stocks after several weeks of unusually strong
sales caused by the squeeze on home-killed marketings following the
drought.
But the New Zealanders insist there is no danger of the additional
tonnage undermining the trade.
Although home-killed lamb prices softened last week, they have since
picked up again and traders believe the outlook is for steady to firm
values for the rest of the year.
Although some producers were worried by the more generous access
granted to New Zealand following the Gatt farm trade deal this year, the
market has easily absorbed a tonnage much greater than in 1994.
Shipments have been up by about 15%, yet prices have risen.
The unprecedented strong trade for home-killed lamb last month led to
a spillover of demand into the imported meat market, and caused a
shortage of product. ''We were allocating, not selling,'' said one
leading importer.
Now the New Zealanders plan to boost their November shipment volume by
1500 tonnes to 6000 tonnes in a bid to restore stocks, but they say the
market will probably stay tight. ''Our exporters might not take up all
the extra space anyway,'' said an official at the New Zealand Meat
Producers' Board in London. ''We're just saying it's available if they
want it.''
With the lamb kill in New Zealand likely to be down in the new season
starting this month, British producers may actually face less
competition from imports over the next year . . . and mutton supplies
are forecast to be particularly low.
A strange political paradox means the increased access entitlement is
making the New Zealand slaughterers less determined to boost sales in
the British market.
The former quota system was renegotiated every year. This created an
incentive to ship volume right up to the permitted limit, to avoid the
danger of Brussels cutting the quota on the argument that it was bigger
than necessary.
Although the new system involves an increase in New Zealand's EU
sheepmeat quota from 205,000 tonnes, it is intended as a permanent
arrangement. This means the exporters can afford to leave British
customers short of product without risk of losing future access
entitlement.
In effect the new import regime institutionalises an incentive to go
for higher prices rather than bigger volumes . . . which is clearly to
the benefit of home producers as well, in the opinion expressed
privately by New Zealand trade officials.

BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SURVEY
SCOTTISH firms on the whole remain the most pessimistic about the
domestic economy although manufacturing export growth looks promising
for the short term, according to the latest quarterly economic survey
from the British Chambers of Commerce.
The BCC also warned yesterday that the engine of recovery is
increasingly running out of steam as economic growth continues to slow.
Particularly hard hit is the manufacturing sector, especially large
firms, which has been battered by the double blow of low demand at home
and increasing competition overseas.
BCC President Robin Geldard said that for the first time in two years
the service sector is outperforming manufacturing. Sales at home seem
stable and orders are increasing.
He warned, though, that capacity remains high by historical standards,
investment is sluggish and high levels of recruitment difficulties
suggest skills shortages persist. He said that to expand demand while
these problems persist threatens to push up inflation, and risks
interest rate rises.
''The Chancellor should refrain from stimulating demand in the
short-term, but look to the long-term to address these problems which
are barriers to greater non-inflationary growth in the economy,'' he
added.
On Scotland, where the findings of some other surveys recently have
been more bullish and less downbeat, the BCC said that having
experienced a small positive balance of manufacturing for the last two
years, Scottish manufacturers are once more in the red in terms of the
balance who have experienced positive growth.
Future prospects for domestic sales also look unfavourable with a
figure of minus 4% signifying that most manufacturing firms are not
expecting orders to increase. Again, the firms hardest hit are those
with more than 500 employees, with a negative balance of 15%.
On the service side, the balance of companies exeriencing both sales
growth and orders growth has risen from minus 1% to plus 9% although
micro-sized firms remain in the red.
While the balance of Scottish manufactuers' home sales looks negative,
the picture for the export market has been reversed. Export deliveries
are up from plus 4% to plus 15% and orders from a positive 2% to 15%.
This reflects the turnaround of fortunes for the larger businesses in
export markets.
The BCC said that while negative employment expectations in the last
quarter have been reversed, the picture is still relatively static in
manufacturing with only plus 3% expecting to increase employment in the
next quarter. On the service side, plus 5% of companies have increased
employment but this all occurred in the small firms range.
The number of Scottish companies investing has increased in the
quarter but remains below the national average for both manufacturing
and service sectors.
Scottish firms on the whole remain pessimistic about future turnover
and profit with the balance expecting both indicators to decrease rather
than increase over the next 12 months. Smaller companies are the only
grouping which have positive expectations.
For the UK, the BCC reported that there has been a levelling-off of
the downward trend in business confidence. Turnover and profitability
confidence indicators remain broadly the same as last quarter.
However, stable levels of confidence, particularly in turnover would
appear slightly inconsistent with the reality of slowing growth, chiefly
in the manufacturing sector, unless firms expect either to raise prices
or for sales to pick-up in the year ahead.

PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
SYSTEMS to beat the indices come and go but a simple one which has
stood the test of time is a high-yield method based on the old FT-30
share index.
It involves taking the 10 shares in the index with the highest yield
and then investing in the five which have the lowest share price, which
constitute the Hy5 portfolio.
These are held for a year and the selection is then recalculated. In
18 out of the past 25 years the system has beaten the FT All-Share index
and in each of the past 13 it has been ahead. The system works because
it tends to pick shares which are out of favour and so carry a higher
yield. It often happens that one year's poor performers are next year's
recovery stocks.
The system has been packaged into a guaranteed equity bond by Johnson
Fry, which has a reputation for innovative investment ideas. Investors
can choose a 100% capital guarantee and 150% participation in the Hy5
portfolio or 95% guarantee and 250% exposure, though the exposure will
vary somewhat from year to year.
However, as with other guaranteed equity bonds, this percentage of
exposure is not what it seems as it is based on average market values,
which makes a great difference.
The annual gain is calculated by taking the average of the closing
monthly prices of the shares and subtracting the share prices at the
start of the year.
So gains and losses are greatly smoothed. In the promotional leaflet
Johnson Fry gives the results of the Hy5 system for each of the past 25
years, excluding dividend income. But it does not give the smoothed
results which its bond will use. This would not be a difficult
calculation and it would enable investors to assess the product
accurately.
The system is worth considering for those of a nervous disposition.
At the end of each year the investor can decide on his investment for
the following year, taking out any gain if he wishes, and decide on the
level of participation for the subsequent year.
This locking in of annual gains is an added safety feature but
investors prepared to take on more risk and invest directly in the Hy5
shares, which can easily be identified, will receive a much better
result. They will also receive the dividend income.

Brussels
A BRITISH journalist yesterday succeeded in forcing the European
Union's secretive Council of Ministers to make public its
decision-making procedures.
Mr John Carvel, of the Guardian, took the council to the European
Court of Justice and accused Ministers of illegally refusing him access
to reports, minutes, and voting records.
The council is the most powerful law-making body in the EU although it
is not directly elected. It passes laws affecting 370 million people,
but is the only legislature in the European democracies to do so behind
closed doors.
Mr Carvel described the ruling as a ''punch on the nose of the
council''. The judgment means that documents relating to a discussion on
child labour in 1993 will be made available.
Mrs Pauline Green, British leader of the socialist group in the
European Parliament, said she would press for the issue of council
secrecy to be placed on the agenda of next year's Maastricht review
summit.
Mr Carvel's request for papers was rejected under the terms of the
council's code of conduct which decreed that documents could be withheld
''in order to protect in the institution's interests in the
confidentiality of its proceedings''.
However, the Luxembourg judges ruled the council must ''balance the
interest of the citizens in gaining access to its documents against any
interest of its own in maintaining the confidentiality of its
deliberations''.

OIL AND GAS
ABERDEEN-based Ramco Energy, which is reaping the rewards of
pioneering work in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, yesterday
announced a seven-fold increase in interim profits.
This was largely the result of payments from US company Pennzoil,
which Ramco Energy brought into the consortium which is developing the
Azeri, Chirag, and deep-water Gunashli fields in Azerbaijan.
As a result of a decision taken earlier this month, production will
begin in the second half of next year or in early 1997. Ramco Energy has
a 2.08% stake in the three fields, although it will receive only 1.19%
of ''profit oil'' in the early stages because Pennzoil is bearing its
costs.
The oil will be pumped out north, through Russia, and west, through
Georgia, to Black Sea ports. BP and Amoco each have 17% stakes in the
fields, which have reserves estimated at 4000 million barrels.
Ramco Energy, whose executive chairman Steve Remp visited Azerbaijan
in 1989, claims to have been active there before any other Western oil
company.
Financial director Steven Bertram said: ''We have good contacts so we
have opportunities to do other deals in that region. We feel we have
some competitive advantage within the former Soviet Union.''
Helped by the recognition of $1.25m (#795,000) from Pennzoil in the
accounts for the six months to end-June, half of the total payment in
the current financial year, Ramco Energy's first-half pre-tax profits
surged from #81,000 to #610,000.
Next year Pennzoil, which paid $5m (#3.1m) to Ramco last year, will
make a final contractual payment of $3m (#1.9m).
The Aberdeen-based company's interim figures also benefited from a
vastly-reduced loss at its 50%-owned Ramco Alnas associate. Ramco
Energy's share of its losses was only #9000, compared with #117,000 in
the first half of last year.
Meanwhile, Ramco Energy's oil services businesses have secured
extensions of contracts in Scotland and Japan, as well as a new contract
in Norway.
Ramco Energy, which changed its name from Ramco Oil Services in June
last year to reflect its growing involvement in exploration and
development, continues to appraise the onshore Muradhanli field in
Azerbaijan.
It is currently working alone but hopes to conclude commercial
negotiations with the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic soon.
With the Pennzoil payments guaranteeing Ramco Energy's cash flow, Mr
Remp said the company was well placed to react to future opportunities
in the former Soviet Union. The company's shares yesterday added 4p to
341p.
Ramco Energy's 1994 pre-tax profits, which were 44% ahead of its
previous best of #1.13m recorded in 1990, were more than five times
greater than in 1993 at #1.62m.

ANDY Smith, DJ with chart-topping and Mercury-winning Portishead was
taking no chances and indulging in no false modesty. First record up was
a mix of the Grade A Dummy-cut Wandering Star, which ensured that the
dancefloor stayed filled. Smith had the challenge of following the
vision of perfect funkiness that is Raw Stylus -- further evidence
(alongside the Brand New Heavies, Mother Earth, and our own Captain
Shifty, Elemental, and Elias) that the boys and girls with guitars do
not have everything their own way.
Sad to report the 10-piece groove machine that is Raw Stylus had not
really done the business door-wise in Dundee -- which some of us older
hip-shakers remember was once the funk capital of Scotland -- the
previous night. Things sure were different in Glasgow, where the big
round room of the city's newest club was a seething mass of writhing
bodies.
Dancing to da funk is necessarily less self-conscious than shimmying
to rock'n'roll and it was a foot-tapping vicarious pleasure to watch
such a good time from my gallery vantage point.
This is The Information: frontman on guitar and keys, two female
singers (one bleach-blonde crop, the other seventies big hair, both in
spray-on strides), guitar, bass, keyboards, drums, and a three-piece
horn section including a saxophonist/flautist who leaves his instruments
in a reckless heap everyone has to step over.
Current single Believe In Me (on Wired) is not their strongest song
but still well worth a listen if they cut it on vinyl as well as they do
live. Encore was a faithful reading of Bill Withers's Use Me. We could
use 'em again soon.

THE failure of Rangers against Juventus in Turin featured yesterday in
the Rosemary West murder trial.
Before the jury left Winchester Crown Court to visit 25 Cromwell
Street, Gloucester, where the bodies of nine young women and girls were
unearthed, they were told by the trial judge, Mr Justice Mantell, not to
discuss the case.
Of course they were entitled to chatter about anything else they
wished. He suggested a possible topic. ''A rather depressing performance
by Rangers last night,'' the judge observed.
A huge operation was mounted to ensure that the viewing was conducted
out of sight of prying cameras.
A large white marquee was erected at the rear of 25 Cromwell Street
and roads nearby were closed to the public, except for residents.
Police motorcycle outriders escorted the jury's coach on the 160-mile
return trip.
Press helicopters buzzed overhead. While the jury toured the covered
back garden, pop music pounded from nearby flats.
White tapes carrying the names of the dead women and girls marked the
spot of each grave uncovered by police last year.
Mrs Rosemary West pleads not guilty to 10 counts of murder, including
that of her daughter Heather, who disappeared when aged 16, and her
stepdaughter Charmaine, last seen alive in 1971, when she was eight.
Mrs West was excused from attending yesterday's view.
The jury members were in a sombre mood when they returned to
Winchester Crown Court. The proceedings were adjourned until today.

SAVING Barings from collapse would have seriously affected the British
banking industry, Bank of England Governor Eddie George said yesterday.
''I have very little doubt that our banking system is stronger than it
would have been as a result of our failing to extend our support in this
case,'' he said.
Barings, Britain's oldest merchant bank, sank in February under #890m
of trading losses.
The Governor said: ''Had we stepped in to save it, when the problem it
faced was not in any sense systemic but was specific to that particular
institution, we would, by that action, have introduced an unacceptable
degree of moral hazard into the British banking system.''
He was delivering a lecture on financial liberalisation to an audience
in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur.
Mr George said if institutions and intermediaries in the financial
sector start relying on ''lender of last resort assistance'' it would
undermine the self-discipline of borrowers and lenders alike.
He also said that Singapore's findings on the collapse of Barings was
consistent with the Bank of England's own investigations. ''I have not
read the report yet, but based on press accounts I can say that it is
consistent with our findings,'' he told reporters.
He said the Singapore government had, like the Bank, identified a
single trader and the failure of Barings management to keep adequate
checks as the main reasons for the collapse. -- Reuter.

THIS will easily ensnare you; a mind-altering concoction of sound and
visual effects, barbed unsettling choreography, sassy comic sparring and
lyrical provocative monologues from the highly accomplished Canadian
Performance Theatre Company One Yellow Rabbit.
Blake Brooker and Michael Green's diligently researched piece on the
experiences of those who claim to be abducted by aliens -- a timeous
theme in UFO-obsessed Scotland -- is playful about its subject, gently
sending up a panel of experts at a symposium on aliens -- they gravely
list the various species of alien, from Small Greys to Preying Mantas to
the absurdly depicted Big Blondes. But it does not mock but gives
poignant voice to the abductees through four quirky characterisations,
with stories related in stylised fragments.
There's lots of laughter and self-deprecation -- one character glumly
notes that the delegates at the conference are as badly dressed as those
at folk festivals, realising with depression rather than relief ''that
no matter how little you've bothered with your appearance there's always
someone worse dressed than you'' -- but the piece puts across a powerful
sense of alienation, detailing feelings of loss and longing, with
wistful evocations of childhood gleaned through a fuzz of panic and
constant sense of fear.
The script is grounded in idiosyncratic detail -- one haunted abductee
recalls the strange requests of shoppers in his all-night store: ''a
pink light bulb and high-technology toothbrush'' -- and distinguished by
a relentless curiosity, as probing as the aliens are reported to be.
The jumps from scene to scene are occasionally jarring and a cutesy
dialogue between two stuffed Polar bears is an unnecessary piece of
fluff, but this is an inventive and highly enjoyable exploration of the
unknown.

Despite few fiery or controversial debates during a week of music
industry seminars, JANE GRAHAM is convinced the spin-off will benefit
those in the business
Quite honestly, more insults flying across the tables would spice
things up
DESPITE what you might have assumed, the Ten Day Weekend festival
isn't just about beer, babes/boys and song -- there's what I could,
somewhat ominously, refer to as a ''more serious side'' to the
proceedings, and it manifests itself, twice daily, in GFT-hosted
''seminars''. These seminars, according to the blurb, feature ''some of
the most controversial and interesting personalities from within the
music industry discussing issues of relevance to everyone involved in
playing and promoting music in Glasgow''.
Each seminar consists of a panel of four or five ''experts'', who
discuss a particular proposal (such as ''has MTV changed music
television for the better?'', or ''Can a small indie label survive in
Scotland?''), and then invite the audience to offer their own questions,
advice, and criticism. Okay, it's certainly a worthy idea -- but just
how successful, in terms of useful information and fun, has it been?
Unsurprisingly, the conclusion I've come to is that, in most cases,
the pricklier the subject, the better the seminar is. Thus, talks on
legal matters and performers' rights, though well-meaning, are usually
deadly dull, and too train-spottingly detailed to be of real help to
aspiring young musicians and business people. Panelists often use terms
and references which assume a far deeper knowledge of the music industry
than most audiences possess, and consequently end up talking among
themselves over the sound of shuffling feet.
On the other hand, a debate on MTV's influence over terrestrial
''music television'' slots saw the audience pitched against the panel in
the most exciting, animated seminar of the week.
Which brings me to my first serious complaint -- despite the promises
of the press release, few of the guests have proved remotely
controversial; for the most part, panelists endlessly back each other up
and defend one another's right to his or her opinion. Quite honestly,
less of the backslapping and more insults flying across the tables and
slurs on colleagues' reputations would spice things up immeasurably.
In general, it has been left to the audience to liven up debates by
accusing guests of treachery, foul play or putting on weight, though
special mentions must be awarded to Chart Bite's Ewan McLeod for his
''good-natured'' outburst against our friend over the border, and Ian
Smith of the Musician's Union, whose vitriolic attack on the Scottish
Arts Council's Michael Rourke (whom he dubbed an ''infuriating,
irresponsible art snob'') was one of the most inspired attacks on an
individual I've heard in a long time.
It's just a pity Rourke wasn't there to respond. Then we might have
seen real fireworks.
After attending a couple of seminars, I've noted another theme, this
one more problematic (or entertaining, depending on your sense of
humour) -- almost every panel has one member who seems totally perplexed
as to the point of his or her inclusion. Monday afternoon's talk -- How
can public money be used to promote popular music? -- was somewhat
hampered by the fact that Kevin Kane of the Glasgow Development Agency
clearly knew very little about the music industry, and so continually
offered advice on obtaining help from the Scottish Film Production Fund,
which, by his own admission, was damn near irrelevant to the debate.
On Tuesday, Andrew McDonald, manager of Greenock's Whiteout, confessed
he was ''completely lost'' when asked for a general comment on the
subject he had come to discuss, and on Thursday, the BBC's Alan Campbell
described his connection to the debate as ''tenuous''. While I confess
these men's predicaments struck me as amusing at the time, in retrospect
it seems obvious that a little more research into the particular
strengths of each guest would have gone a long way.
However, a number of positive things have come out of the week's
seminars, not least overwhelming evidence that young people in Scotland
are working tremendously hard just to stay involved in the music
business. The number of audience members who revealed that they were
running their own record labels, attending music-related college courses
or playing in a band was immensely cheering, proving that Glasgow's
reputation as a hive of musical activity is not undeserved.
It has also been very interesting to note which topics are continually
revived -- it seems that the age-old arguments (indie credibility vs
major label power, the racism of national press/radio) continue to
obsess the latest generation of (potential) rock stars, label managers
and music publishers.
So although I whinge a bit about the details of the seminar week, I'm
actually very proud that it took place in Glasgow at all, and that it
was so well attended. If the lessons of this year are noted and a few
more ''explosive'' personalities are brought in to kick-start the
debates, next year's follow-up should be a real triumph.

Radio music guru Peter Easton maintains a hectic pace for the Ten Day
Weekend and finds out it really is a dog's life
MUSICIANS and animals. Like children, they are natural hazards in a
well ordered existence. Early Tuesday evening in King Tut's Wah Wah Hut,
halfway through Glasgow's Ten Day Weekend, the room is dimly lit,
containing an undercurrent of those familiar smells that never quite
leave any rock venue: beer, sweat, the tang of electrical circuits, the
mysterious contents of ancient music cases, wood, and leather. BBC
cables snake across the ceiling to the van outside, where recordings
will be made for my show, Beat Patrol on Radio Scotland and for John
Peel at Radio One.
This is the lull before A C Acoustics crunch into their sound-check.
They are volatile, frequently brilliant. Right now there are two of
them. Caz traces a fault to the brand new lead for his bass, while Mark
checks his own guitar amplifier.
A C Acoustics, are well established, Beat Patrol veterans, much
praised in the UK music press. Some of the bands taking the stage this
week contain members barely old enough to drink in the bar. The next
generation hot on the heels of the last.
Thwack, across my ankle. A coil of dog lead lands at my feet, the
canine thumps into a sitting position, ears up, looking really keen. She
obviously knows someone who works here. ''?!'' she says silently in
Labrador. ''Um, no walkies,'' is my best shot. ''!*!'' she replies and
empties her bladder stage left. My producer, Stewart and I head for the
office to report the health and safety crisis.
Steve, at the office computer, is a happy man, isolated from musicians
and dogs. Mops can be organised by telephone. His screen tells him that
advance tickets look good -- about 50 and the walk-up sales will
probably mean at least a half capacity house, the same as Monday night.
We know that elsewhere the festival has had a slowish start.
The Ten Day Weekend presents some interesting challenges to people who
find it hard to be in three places at once. The trick, as at all
festivals, is to keep moving. On Monday I was at the Tramway to review
the Bathers. (Their support, Jackie Leven declared after his first song
that he was ''desperate for a piss''. Unlike the Labrador, he was lying
to disguise the fact that he'd left the capo for his guitar backstage).
As reported here, he and the Bathers were uplifting and wonderful.
I zoomed the wee red car back to King Tuts in time to catch the Gyres,
a five-piece from Airdrie reminiscent of Oasis/Stones (as opposed to
Oasis/Beatles). They have mod haircuts and, newly signed to Sugar
Records they mean business. Paul, their manager, hustled me for a Radio
Scotland session.
Their label mates, Coast are an Aberdonian quartet of psychedelic
popsters, relocated to London. This meant that Monday's audience could
barrack them on two fronts, as the humour from the stage moved from
playful to aggressive. Coast seemed disgruntled, though ''no' bad for a
bunch of sheep-shaggers'' is praise of a sort.
I suggest to Steve and Stewart that the previous night's tension
wasn't exactly unusual for a Coast gig. Steve raises an eyebrow and says
nothing.
I go in quest of grub and meet Karen from King Tut's bar staff. She is
sitting on the stairs, working on the Christmas menu. She has spent the
day behind the bar selling tickets. On Wednesday she'll be doing
front-of-house for Camden Town heroes, Menswear, at the Plaza and on
Thursday either Sleeper at the same venue or Underworld at The Arches.
There's a lot happening: Thursday also promises Baby Kaos at the Cat
House, Spacehopper at Nice'n'Sleazy and our own rather smart Beat Patrol
bill of the Necterine No. 9, Bis and Hardbody here at Tuts. And that's
just part of it.
I dive down to the Tramway to catch former A C Acoustics guitarist,
Roger Ward and friends opening for the Bathers. Fifteen minutes past
starting time, and the audience is kept outside while the instruments
take turns to fall mysteriously silent. Eventually it happens, Cora
Bissett from Swelling Meg, sings dramatically and unrehearsed -- she was
called in to work at Cottier's Bar at the crucial moment. It is more
than fine. On Wednesday, Swelling Meg will take King Tuts by storm, Cora
transforming a beer keg into a gong by hitting it with a broom handle.
But this is still Tuesday and to start the evening at Tuts, I
introduce Urusei Yatsura, which allegedly means something in Japanese,
though no-one is sure what. The set works its way from melody to mayhem,
culminating in Fergus tossing an expensive guitar about the stage while
Graham attacks a distinctly cheaper instrument with what appears to be a
ray gun. This is what we want.
Mark Percival, one time presenter of Radio Scotland's splendid Bite
The Wax (before the cultural revolution) introduces Shriek. They are a
vivid, intense, dynamic three-piece guitar band, playing bravely through
the technical glitches. Ros Cairney can't hear her own vocals and a
strange howl affects the on-stage monitor. The crowd is delighted but in
the recording van they are wondering how much of this can be salvaged.
Finally A C Acoustics play a blinder. My dear producer persuades me to
lead the cry for an encore. (Never, never, attempt this). ''Do you want
some more? Let's get them back, etc.'' I look round: Dave and Caz hang
about helpless in the wings. Paul and Marky have disappeared. Er, that's
all folks.
''I think the crowd were on your side,'' commiserates Mark Percival,
as we pass by the Acoustics' dressing room, from which come the sounds
of discussion. ''I'm not going in there,'' he adds wisely. Nor me.

FOOD PROCESSING
FOOD processor and distributor Albert Fisher has had three years of
reorganisation and now reckons it is on track for a period of strong
growth.
Chairman Stephen Walls, unveiling a 15% rise in profits ahead of tax
and exceptionals for the year to end August along with a hike in the
dividend total, said the company now has four strong divisions in place,
providing extensive geographic coverage supported by a substantial
global sourcing capability.
Each division has strong market positions and its clearly identified
growth areas. And he points also to a strengthened management and an
operational environment which facilitates the networking of business and
divisions to enhance results.
''It is a combination of these factors which now gives the board
increasing confidence in the future,'' he said.
Fisher has continued to develop its relationship with important
customers across all its businesses, and says its strategy of focusing
investment and management on the identified growth opportunities is
starting to produce encouraging results.
The market will certainly welcome them as they emerge them but in the
meantime the share stand at 53p, down 1[1/2]p yesterday.

Rock
I FIRST saw Sleeper on ITV's The Beat, launching their career as
pedlars of dark, moody, chugging guitar rock -- so if their recent
transformation into photogenic perky popsters proves anything, it's the
success of the Britpop banner both as a lure to confused lost souls and
as a marketing device.
And Britpop has been kind to Sleeper, embracing their jaunty
''Rockney'' act with open arms and celebrating front woman Louise Wener
as one of the genre's strongest, most outspoken personalities. There may
be some doubt as to how far Wener's statements regarding sex (''women
like it'') and feminism (''it's a myth'') validate her 'Motormouth'
persona, but it must be said that she makes for one of pop's more
interesting new stars.
However, Wener's ideological agenda doesn't appear to be the first
thing on this audience's mind: the proposals she receives on stage are
less of the political than the lewd kind. But she doesn't seem to mind,
and the rest of the band (Sleeperblokes -- no-one knows their names) try
to look as though they don't either.
What surprises me most about Sleeper live is that they've retained
some of the punky edge that was ironed out in their recent recordings.
The bass-lines in particular remind me more of The Only Ones than Blur,
which can only be a healthy sign. Wener has a natural grace, and she
shares with her band members an attractive air of wilful abandon. Less
of the Elastica ''tributes'' and more of the scissor kicks and Sleeper
might just make it through the night.

MORE than 10 years ago I told you what was going to happen. Ten years
ago I told you. It was a full-page spread with a marvellous illustration
by Jim Turnbull which illustrated what I had to say. The educational
establishment was outraged by both Jim's and my illustrations. Today
they have the argument and the cartoon in technicolour. But I told you,
oh yes, I told you.
Today the teachers and the teaching unions are forever speaking of how
they cannot cope with bad little blighters of both sexes making life
hell for teachers, other pupils, the system itself.
I told you: I told you. Those years back when the bourgeois
baby-boomers said I was wrong and horribly reactionary, how the years
roll back. I was right, they agree now, and I have no sense of joy in my
rectitude. But I was right. All those years ago.
And don't tell me that it is all very well for me, since I was
ensconced in a job which makes more sense than being Ichabod Crane in
the West of Scotland in the 1980s, but without a flute. (Look up
Washington Irving for that. In fact look up any damned thing for
anything. There is hardly a reader who has the slightest knowledge of
Scripture, let alone Washington Irving.) Look up Education in the
dictionary.
Bringing up or training, especially the child. Strengthening the
powers of body and mind: culture. That's what the dictionary says. The
Brittanica has as its first item in education: ''Economics of''. So does
every government, because more is rather ludicrously spent on schooling
than it is on ensuring people have jobs. And not a groat on ensuring
civic values, apart from another massive expenditure: how to deal with
criminal delinquency, especially of a juvenile nature.
I told you years back what was happening and how it was going to get
worse. I recollect telling headmasters and above -- education officials
and such, and heedies and below -- Guidance Teachers and below. I even
told the lot of them of a class I once taught, about how things were
desperate, but none of them listened. I will tell you now of that very
class. Out of 20, seven are dead through drug-related incidents. Two of
them were murdered, one luridly so, not least because his body has never
been discovered.
I told these middle-class people from Whitecraigs and Bearsden, I told
them. Jesus I told you, and devil the bit of it: none of you listened.
You're listening now: now it's your own kids who are dying of drugs. I
told you so. And it affords me little satisfaction.
But was it not the other day I overheard a radio programme about how
simply dreadful the business of suspending or indeed expelling weans
from school was: why thae teachers were oot of order.
A wummin, a so-called mother, was giving it big licks aboot how her
weans had been treated badly. She had three weans. The two boys had been
suspended and then sent to other schools; spent most of their last years
not having any schooling. Got into trouble as a result. Her daughter had
been suspended from school, expelled, got into . . . If it hadn't
occurred to her that there was something wrong with her children, that
was as good a reason for not grasping that there was something wrong
with her for badly bringing up children.
Aye, it wis the schools that were wrang. Well it is. They put up with
these illiterate parents and their children and spend a fortune on
looking after degenerates when there are perfectly decent mums and dads
and children in despair, because the scum are destroying all before
them. You think I'm going over the top. Not at all. I have less of an
enthusiasm for my argument than I did a few years back: I'm out of the
confrontation.
Now they tell us, teachers and authorities of all kinds, that it has
got out of hand; too many children expelled, excluded, what do we do
now, things aren't what they were. When we put the weans out of school
they spend their hours vandalising, housebreaking, stealing in shops,
hurting. Often themselves. Mothers say the schools are to blame. For
years educationists said it was the schools' fault too.
''Schools aren't interesting enough,'' they said. Listen: you could
place a French tart in a suspender belt on all fours on a lab table and
most of the visigoths who cause trouble in schools would say they were
bored. Disaffected girls would rather get up the stick with a local
drugs dealer with acne than apply for a job as a nurse. I told you years
back. I said I was ringing a fireball in the night then. The fire is
raging now and you never listened.

FASCINATING and frustrating, rigid and riotous. Last night's superbly
constructed concert, with the Royal SNO conducted by Yoel Levi, had the
lot.
Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, in the hands of this orchestra, is
failsafe. A deaf director could conduct it backwards and the RSNO would
still make a job of it. In a way, last night's performance typefied what
seems to be Yoel Levi's style. Everything is very broad, very measured,
with a feel of deliberate calculation. In Prokofiev's Fifth, that means
monumental.
Levi appeared to want to construct some vast edifice in sound. He got
it straight back from the band. The effect was almost gothic (and
deafening). Real flow was sacrificed on the altar of bigness, both in
the stolid slow movement and the frustratingly underdriven finale, which
lacked the metal whir and clatter of the machine. (Splendid playing,
though.)
Similarly in Gershwin's American in Paris, which sounded very well
organised, but lacked the feel of bustling spontaneity. Raunch-free and
urbane in its bluesy sections, it was short on colour and pzazz.
Paradoxically, in a kind of role-reversal, pianist Wayne Marshall turned
Ravel's Piano Concerto inside out. Where the jazziness of Gershwin was
contained by Levi, Marshall unleashed it in Ravel.
This was amazing: iconoclastic wasn't in it. Marshall hinted at his
intentions over the microphone, when he pointed to the influence of jazz
on Ravel. Then, in a completely unorthodox (and entertaining)
performance of the concerto, which threw conventional pacing and
''classical'' playing to the winds, he played it as though it came out
of New Orleans instead of Paris. Chic to cheek, so to speak. Brilliant.

Rock
WITH 24,000 songs on the clock, and looking more like Baby Tommy from
Rug Rats than the King Edward of legend, Jimmy Somerville, after a
six-year hiatus from live performance, last night pulled into The
Garage.
It was perhaps surprising that Jimmy and the chaps chose such an
intimate venue. Well, perhaps not that surprising. For we learned that
this was the very location where our lad first pulled on a pair of
cowboy boots and ventured into the bright lights of the Glasgow night to
shake his booty and curly perm down the disco. Stadium rock just can't
handle this level of revelation.
Things have changed in the intervening period. No longer the fevered
dervish of yore, he now sways on stage with the mellifluous precision of
a mildly opiated cobra. The voice remains unchanged. While still the
same goosepimple-inducing virtual reality dive from the top of a
multi-storey car park, the songs are now delivered in laid-back mode.
From the opening number, To Love Somebody, it worked, beautifully.
During the segue from For A Friend to Smalltown Boy, poignancy dripped
from the ceiling into our pints. Made for interesting drinking.
The sound is more bruised than of old, but with a strong thread of
optimism. And, during such as Don't Leave Me This Way, the chaps did
kick some serious butt-cheek. The highlight of the night was the dub
version of Alright, possibly the best song on the latest CD, Dare To
Love. Outstanding. Jimmy Somerville, a man for all reasons.

YOUR Weekend Extra article on rural housing problems is a valuable
reminder that homelessness lurks in every part of Scotland (October 14).
The problems faced, in particular, by people living in caravans has been
highlighted by Shelter, both nationally and in the Ross of Mull, three
years ago.
We can all agree that rural Scotland faces a housing crisis just as
severe, if different in nature, as that found in the largest cities.
However, Shelter vehemently disputes the prescription offered by Noel
Faccenda, the outgoing housing convener of Argyll and Bute District
Council.
Among the welter of statistics cited by Councillor Faccenda he makes
no mention of the most obvious: the decline in affordable housing for
rent as a consequence of his own party's long period in Government.
Perhaps before we start savaging the safety net of the homelessness
legislation, as Councillor Faccenda advocates, we should look at the
effect that the right to buy has had on the Island of Mull and of the
failure by either the Government or Scottish Homes to make up for the
loss.
No statistical evidence is produced that it is the claims of homeless
people rather than the shortage of housing which is causing Sam and
Jenny Parker to have to wait so long to move from their caravan into a
secure home.
Rather than making scapegoats of homeless people, Councillor
Faccenda's energy might be better directed into persuading those holding
the purse strings into investing in the future of our rural communities.

AS one of the 600 objectors to the M74 extension, the so-called
''missing link''in Glasgow's urban box, I was invited to the hearing
called by the planning sub-committee on development control on October
11.
I watched our elected representatives getting detailed information in
opposition to this gigantic development, probably the most important
planning issue of the last 25 years. The committee did not seem to be as
attentive or interested as one would have expected, given the gravity of
the development.
Nearly five miles of elevated motorway, gouging its way across the
south-east sector of central Glasgow, gashing the communities of
Gorbals, Govanhill and Rutherglen, in the nightmarish way that more
enlightened citizens believed were abandoned in the past.
But the committee sat looking bored and dissatisfied. The chair
fumbled for sweets to suck on as he counted the allotted four minutes
each speaker in opposition was afforded.
Was it boredom that prevented more than half the committee from
attending? Or was it indifference? Only 13 out of the total 29 members
of the committee bothered to vote -- nine in favour and four against.
So much for the democratically forged policy of the Glasgow District
Labour Party, against future urban motorways, as published in the
manifesto of 1992 and 1995, on which ruling Labour councillors were
elected.
I know this because I was a delegate for many years to the now defunct
Glasgow District Labour Party, the policy forum of the outgoing district
council.
I think it lamentable and ironic that we look to the new millennium as
''The City of Architecture and Design 1999'' with the same old
destructive motorway building madness that has blighted so much of
Glasgow in the last 40 years. The city continues to be governed by
indifference and the hard-fought democratic process and policy is
civically shredded.

AGGRO will continue to break out whenever a major road project is
proposed until costs and benefits, on a similar basis for all solutions,
are presented for road and for alternatives. The extension of the M74
will receive vigorous and influential support from people and firms who
expect to benefit; it will cost them little. Those who lose out may have
to foot sizeable bills remaking their lives.
An alternative use for this money would be to fit the West Coast rail
route for the 21st century. It has not been upgraded for 20 years while
the M/A74 has had steady investment over the last 40 years.
A railway project has to pass a rigorous assessment with regard to its
ability to meet the interest charges on the capital to be committed. The
benefits to individuals, firms, and the environment are not allowed to
enter into this calculation, only savings in operating costs and
increases in revenue (very conservatively estimated).
Road schemes are justified largely by a notional value of savings in
journey time and the removal of congestion from adjacent roads. Although
the return on the capital invested is examined, it is calculated from
these notional benefits.
Once a particular road has been built there is no annual profit and
loss account by which revenue from it can be compared with outgoings.
How could there be since those who actually use this new facility do not
have to pay for it at the time of using it? They pocket the savings, and
we, the nation, pay for the capital.
Thus when making a particular journey on the new road, the user does
not have to decide whether the benefit to him is justified by its cost.
In contrast, users of the Channel Tunnel have to pay handsomely each
time they traverse it.
The creation of Railtrack means that a mechanism now exists whereby
charging traffic for the use of the rails could be put on the same basis
as that for traffic on the roads. Sweden finds it possible to do this.

FIVE Aberdeen school projects worth nearly #3m are in jeopardy because
of a hitch over funding, it was claimed yesterday by Grampian regional
convener Councillor Rhona Kemp. Grampian planned to finance the work
from the proceeds of the sale of two sites. However, councillors were
told yesterday that as both deals were dependent on planning approval,
proceeds of more than #4m were not available for re-investment.

MARY Leitch's article on Cumnock and Doon Valley and open-cast coal
workings contained some serious misconceptions about what is happening
in this district (October 12).
First, Auchinleck itself has probably had one of the highest per
capita spending allocations in the district in recent years. Industrial
projects such as the Barony Universal Factory and the new factory units
at the former Highhouse Colliery, costing over #2m, have proved to be
highly successful joint ventures entered into by the district council,
British Coal Enterprise, CADET and Enterprise Ayrshire with all units
currently being occupied.
In addition, the improved recreational facilities at Merlin Park
together with other environmental improvements have cost over #400,000.
The council is doing its best to improve the appearance of Auchinleck's
Main Street.
Secondly, in the recent finalised district-wide local plan, the
council will be taking a lead role in the improvement of the community
with the main aim of making the settlement an attractive area both for
new inward investment and as a means of improving the quality of life
for local residents.
Public involvement in the preparation of the plan has been invited at
each appropriate stage, including public meetings in Auchinleck, and Mrs
Leitch's observations would have been warmly welcomed at the appropriate
time.
Thirdly, the council fully recognises that there are considerable
reserves of coal within the district and recently, in conjunction with
consultants, prepared a minerals open-cast coaling subject plan, which
is shortly to be the subject of a public consultation exercise.
It is hoped that these policies and proposals will meet the
aspirations of mineral developers and the community alike and that a
sensible balance will be reached between the socio-economic advantages
which could be provided by such developments and the responsibility to
protect the natural environment.
With unemployment rates amongst the highest in Strathclyde (August
1995: male unemployment 16.1%, total unemployment 11.8%) the council is
under considerable pressure to grant any development which will create
jobs.
Indeed, on a recent occasion when it refused an open-cast coal
development a poll conducted by the local newspaper indicated by 105
votes to nine that jobs should take precedence over the environment and
that the council should not have refused the application. Mrs Leitch was
one of the minority of nine.
It is against this background that decisions on open-cast coal
applications are made. The planning department does not have the veto on
decisions for such developments: the decision always rests with the
district council.
Finally, with respect to the open-cast coal site operating without
consent, extraction of coal from this site stopped in the spring of 1994
and the operations that have taken place since relate entirely to the
restoration of the site. The site was one which was originally granted
consent by the Secretary of State on appeal, following refusal by the
district council.
Although the restoration works have been ongoing outwith the time
limit of the planning consent it would benefit no-one to stop operations
at this time. The site has also been the subject of a recent application
for landfill waste disposal and that application had a bearing on the
eventual restoration profile of the open-cast site. The landfill
operation has been approved by the council and a revised restoration
application has now been submitted.

WHILE I share Michael Tumelty's anguish and anger at the proposals
over the funding of Scottish Opera, I must divorce myself from his
conclusion that nothing should be done to look at the structure of the
company in particular and the arts in general.
I grew up as a child of the Welfare state but now there are all kinds
of dire warnings that education may have to be paid for, students will
increasingly have to fund their own studies, optical, health, and dental
care are increasingly becoming less accessible and more expensive to the
individual and the state pension is unlikely to retain its value.
The reason for this deterioration in the quality of life of millions
is attributed to the demands being placed on services by virtue of their
universality.
Against this kind of economic reality (which Michael Tumelty appears
to hold in some contempt) the plight of Scottish Opera, which is
important to far fewer people, seems no better nor worse than that being
faced by many other organisations and institutions.
I do not know where Michael Tumelty has been living for the last 16
years. Money has been the driving force of our society since the advent
of Thatcherism. British society today increasingly seems to know the
price of everything and the value of nothing.
Scottish Opera is just the latest casualty of such an approach. Kent
Opera was one of the most enterprising comanies, it is no more.
Opera (despite valiant efforts by such as Scottish Opera to become
more populist and youth orientated), remains an esoteric and elitist art
form.
The allegations of mismanagement in Scottish Opera need to be fully
investigated, but perhaps the most serious question concerns the
viability of many art forms. Opera is always destined to be an expensive
business, not helped by the inflated fees demanded by many soloists and
conductors. The same may be said of orchestral concerts.
If there are to be no regular increases in subsidy then these
organisations will simply have to apply rigorous reforms and tighten
their belts like everyone else has had to do.
Slimmed down administrations, shared productions, increased ticket
prices, commercial fund-raising which targets money for long-term
investment income, a donation option when purchasing tickets or buying
programmes, which have in themselves become over-elaborate affairs, and
the end of pensioner concessions which allow some very well-heeled
people who could easily afford to pay full price to attend performances
very cheaply.
Michael Tumelty should learn to enjoy such events as the excellent
Opera Gala conducted by Lazarev which he reviewed on October 6. They may
be the only way we hear opera on a regular basis in the future. As an
opera lover I would deplore it if it was so but I am also a realist and
so am reconciled to the possibility.

AT the start of her excellent Visions of Glasgow series Anne Johnstone
highlighted the continuing problem of derelict land (October 17). It is
interesting that policy in Scotland and England has evolved in very
different ways in recent years.
In Scotland the Scottish Enterprise (SE) network has tended to focus
more sharply than its predecessor, the Scottish Development Agency, on
projects which will result in direct economic benefit rather than in
more general environmental improvements. The SE budget for all its
activities is #450m in 1995/96.
In England a new agency, English Partnerships, was formed specifically
to treat derelict land. It has a budget in 1995/96 of #268m and a remit
which allows it to invest in environmental, economic, housing, and
social projects.
One of the aims of the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum is to promote
good practice in urban regeneration in Scotland. So that the contrasting
approaches to derelict land treatment in England and Scotland can be
compared, we will be holding a seminar on the topic later this year.

THERE is something truly silly brewing in the bowels of Scottish
Enterprise. The nation's quangocrats are putting together a marketing
unit to sell Scotland abroad as a land of more than just heather and
haggis. This creation is silly not just because it's called Scotland the
Brand. No, it's silly because it perpetuates this ludicrous conceit that
Scotland is there to be sold.
The sale of Scotland has been on for years. Its politicians sell us
short, the Tories are accused of selling us out, Walker's shortbread and
Johnny Walker whisky sell very well in Japan, and huge chunks of its
wilderness are for sale. A nation is in danger of being reduced to a
marketing concept.
Sitting in a corner of my kitchen is a pile of papers, pamphlets, and
glossy brochures about a foot high, which my wife is pressing me to
throw out and which I keep, more out of morbid fascination than anything
else. They are the left-overs of an intense, four-day visit to Scotland
organised by the Scottish Office for Westminster-based journalists. The
idea was to refresh the outlooks of a bunch of tired hacks whose mindset
is dominated by the fish-bowl world of parliamentary politics.
The method? Pack us in a wee happy bus and drag us around Scotland,
from Glasgow to Skye to Dundee to Edinburgh, overwhelm us with fabulous
scenery, fill us with drink, and submit us to a non-stop round of
meetings and discussions with businessmen, politicians, entrepreneurs,
and a host of snake-oil merchants funded by the public purse. We had a
marvellous time.
It was on our first stop, in the offices of Lanarkshire Enterprise,
that we were presented with the plans for Scotland, the Brand. The idea
comes from Scottish Trade International, a Scottish Enterprise offshoot
charged with improving the performance of Scottish products abroad,
worth #12billion in exports in 1993 and which STI hopes to take to #23bn
by 2000.
Scotland the Brand will consist of a small unit of people and have a
start-up budget of #300,000 when it begins operations in the next month
or so. But what they will actually do was hidden from us by the layers
of quango-speak used in the explanation. Somewhere in the mention of
Scotland's clean water, fresh air, and general environmental
wonderfulness, we were told: ''Scotland the Brand will look at how to
build on these synergies to take things forward.'' Eh?
STI's strategy was set out for us, bullet point after incomprehensible
bullet point -- strategic case for diversification; sectoral dimension;
eight priority sectors; four areas of focus; sector focus to exhibition
and mission programmes -- explaining how STI will facilitate, take
forward, strategise, provide services.
What it amounts to is an attempt to repackage Scotland's endearing
tartan image to reflect how the purity of its environment has
contributed to its success in attracting hi-tech firms. The emphasis is
distinctly Scandinavian: our unit labour costs may be higher than
Singapore's, but while you assemble those computers -- breathe that air,
taste that water.
But that was for us to deduce. English has long since been abandoned
as the preferred method of communication in this strange world of modern
business parks, strategy documents, and glossy brochures. Instead the
language is development-speak, a turgid, meaningless jargon cooked up to
mask the truth of what the LECs actually do: very little that matters.
Behind the array of statistics churned out with depressing regularity
lies an army of not-too-deep thinkers who spend their time coming up
with ways of justifying the #450m of public money they receive each
year. Even Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, has
conceded that he could do the same job for 15% less, and is prepared to
allow the Scottish Office to impose what anywhere else would be a
potentially fatal cut in funding.
Fortunately, out on the nation's fringes the culture of
development-speak has not penetrated, while the idea of gift-wrapping
Scotland and sticking a ''for sale'' sign on it is positively laughed
at. In Argyll and on Skye the representatives of the LECs we met spoke
in plain English and quietly mocked the lowland obsession with big
inward investment projects and flummed-up marketing exercises. One
senior official of Argyll and Islands Enterprise even admitted that when
he discovered that a large, 400-job project would not after all be
coming to the area, he was quite relieved.
His honesty reflects an understanding not found in the central belt,
that so much of this grandiose national selling exercise does Scotland
no favours. Inward investment may look good, create jobs, and please
Ministers, but by its nature it is impermanent and fails to address
Scotland's congenital shortage of home-grown entrepreneurs. Out on the
west coast they understand the value of small one, two, or three-man
businesses to the area's long-term economic prospects and, even better,
realise the dangers posed by an outside investor, here today, in the Far
East tomorrow.
The most convincing exponents we met of what the Scottish economy
could be were all Highlanders with little time for development
snow-jobs: Sir John Lister-Kaye of Scottish Natural Heritage; Dr Jim
Hunter, chairman of Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise; and John Noble, owner
of Loch Fyne Oysters Ltd. Each in his direct way conveyed a passion for
the reality of Scotland that did far more for the understanding of our
jaded group of political journalists than the hours of mind-numbing
waffle we heard elsewhere.
Sir John described the ''wet desert'' of the Highlands, where
deforestation and poor management have destroyed the viability of the
land. If he had his way, one sensed, the Scottish Tourist Board and the
engineers of Scotland the Brand would be banned from promoting the
beauty of our ravaged moors. Dr Hunter spoke eloquently of the role of
Gaelic in revitalising the fragile economy of the west coast. And John
Noble fed us the incredible products of his enterprise and, between
mouthfuls, made clear that quangos were no substitute for small,
home-grown enterprises. Michael Forsyth, please take note.

SO Lord Gowie thinks it ''iniquitous'' that arts funding has not been
cut as much in Scotland as in England (October 12).
Surely his unnecessary jibe that we should not receive money because
we have the good sense not to vote Tory was undermined by the further
revelations of the English Arts Council's obsession with London-based
companies in the massive grants to the Sadler's Wells Dance Theatre and
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.
No wonder the rest of England seems to be following Scotland's lead in
rejecting the Tories.
One only hopes that a Labour Government will show the good sense to
democratise the granting of Lottery money to take into account the
cultural diversity of all the people resident in these isles.

IN the debate over Scottish Opera's funding crisis several factors and
figures have been presented relating to music in Scotland. Lest it be
overlooked I should like to put the very strong case for Scotland's own
traditional music.
In 1991 the Scottish Tourist Board Festival Survey estimated economic
benefit from 35 folk festivals at #10m. There are now upwards of 60
festivals, so a significant increase in benefit must be assumed, much of
it drawn from visitors attracted to Scotland by its distinctive culture
and traditions.
Traditional music events are enjoyed throughout the length and breadth
of Scotland. From the hugely successful Folk Songs of North-east
Scotland, presented on 21 nights at the Festival Theatre during the
Edinburgh International Festival, to traditional music sung and played
at folk clubs and festivals in some of the smallest villages in Scotland
the range of presentation is vast.
This is not simply spectator participation -- workshops and tuition
classes abound, generated by a growing enthusiasm amongst all sections
of the community, young and old.
What better way can there be to stimulate self-confidence in a
national cultural identity than to have a population both knowledgeable
and proud of Scotland's musical traditions?
The Scottish Arts Council has stated one of its priority objectives to
be support for the indigenous arts of Scotland and, indeed, it does
invest around #250,000 annually in revenue grants for traditional music
and literature including the Gaelic arts. This is a modest sum. While
there can be few people in Scotland who are unaware of the existence of
Scottish Opera there are, sadly, many who are unaware of Scotland's own
musical traditions.
Those of us concerned with their promotion and presentation recognise
the importance of a plurality of music provision in Scotland -- opera,
jazz, contemporary music of all kinds, as well as Scottish traditional
music.
Scotland's culture is enriched by them all. But a more substantial
investment in Scottish traditional music would certainly refresh the
parts other music does not reach.

A FEW weeks ago, I referred in passing to the irritation of writing to
the Secretary of State for Scotland about an important, indeed
life-threatening, aspect of policy in Scotland's prisons and receiving a
reply -- not from Mr Forsyth or any other Minister but from the director
of the ''agency'' which runs our prisons.
The issues in question involved the remedial measures available to
sexual offenders while in prison; the policy on when and whether they
should be released; and the adequacy of supervision thereafter.
As it happens, there is a remarkably high level of recidivism (as in
most other categories of offending). My concerns were prompted by the
brutal murder of one of my constituents by a convicted sex offender who
had qualified for early release from Peterhead.
Now, if none of these issues qualify for acceptance of political, as
opposed to administrative, responsibility, then I think there is cause
for urgent concern. I do not want to hear on these matters of principle
and policy from an administrator but from the person to whom he must
surely be politically responsible.
It is this division between ''operational'' and policy issues which
has now been brought into sharp focus by the prisons furore in England.
And not before time.
The country will pass its own judgment, probably more efficiently than
any vote in the House of Commons, on who has been telling the truth --
Michael Howard or the sacked Director of the Prison Service south of the
Border, Derek Lewis.
But one of the clear impressions which will emerge is of the
flexibility which Ministers can now apply to so many areas of policy,
for which responsibility has been turned over to these ubiquitous
agencies.
Where they want to accept, or even boast of, their political control
they can step in and do so. But when there is a buck to be passed they
habitually say: ''That's an operational matter for the agency''
Only last week, Michael Howard -- one of the great opportunists of
contemporary politics -- was intervening spectacularly in prison policy,
with his draconian announcements at the Tory Party conference.
Without consulting anyone in the prison service, he announced measures
estimated to add 15,000 to Britain's prison population -- already the
highest in Europe -- at a cost of #700m per year.
Be in no doubt that when these great initiatives -- if they are ever
introduced -- lead to riots in the cell blocks and prisoners on the
roofs, Mr Howard or his successor would be available only to define them
as ''operational matters'' and not therefore his responsibility.
It's time for the lines to be re-drawn and the principle of
ministerial responsibility, which has been so discredited under the
Tories, revived. Otherwise we end up with nobody who is politically
accountable available to carry any can.
In another arena, it is quite absurd that the Regulators of privatised
utilities are now hidden behind, to such an extent, by Ministers who
insist on these individuals' ''independence''.
The whole fiasco of mega-profits and over-charging in these monopolies
has been allowed to develop through the weakness of a regulatory system
which Government has created but of which Ministers then wash their
hands.
But as soon as it suits their purpose this posture is abandoned. The
Electricity Regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, has eventually
felt moved to recommend referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission of a couple of takeover bids.
At this point, the ''independent'' authority of the Regulator is
simply brushed aside because it conflicts with a higher Tory dogma of
non-interventionism in boardroom battles. Mr Ian Lang therefore ignores
the Regulator and ministerial responsibility is magically re-asserted.
Ministerial accountability is an essential ingredient in Parliamentary
democracy. The Tory device of avoiding acceptance of responsibility for
the awkward questions, while always intervening where there is a dogma
to be imposed, undermines that principle on a daily basis.
If the current difficulties of Michael Howard highlight that whole
ruse and bring it into disrepute, they will have served a useful
purpose. So much the better if they also lead to his overdue eviction
from an office to which he is uniquely unsuited.

SUSPICIONS that the recent wave of terrorist bombings in Paris was the
work of Algerian Islamic terrorists have now been justified. An offshoot
of the Islamic Salvation Front, the militant Algerian grouping, has
claimed responsibility for the latest bombing. The price of its standing
down would be major shifts in French policy towards its former colony
whose military administration owes much to French diplomatic support and
financial encouragement. From the French Government's point of view,
perhaps the worst aspect of this situation is that although the
incidents are carried out for and on behalf of Algerian interests, those
engaged in them are thought to include French citizens from the North
African ghettoes in most of the country's major cities, and especially
Paris itself and Lyons. This indicates just how many Muslim Frenchmen
feel rejected by the society in which they live and of which they hope
to be part: their alienation may turn out to be the most significant and
disturbing aspect of what looks likely to be a continuing campaign, and
one which can only worsen their plight.
French policy towards Algeria seems confused. It was probably bound to
be hostile to Muslim fundamentalism; but that need not have taken any
direct shape, and indeed Mr Juppe, the present Premier, did signal a
commitment to neutrality which contradicted support for the Algerian
Army, and may even have embodied a willingness of the French Government
to accept the outcome of any future elections which produced a militant
Islamic majority. If that is so, Mr Juppe was a moderate in a government
which has ignored the possibility that the fundamentalists enjoy
majority opinion (a fact which is unclear because the Algerian Army
aborted the last elections before the votes were actually cast). The
Government has had its policy made more by Mr Charles Pasqua, a hardline
opponent of Muslim hopes for a religious overthrow of Algeria's secular
society. It is Mr Pasqua who has backed the Algerian Army consistently
these past three years. The views he represents have been accepted by
President Chirac, just as they were accepted by President Mitterrand
before him. Urban terrorism is the price metropolitan France is paying
for this stance. It is a price Mr Pasqua may not mind meeting since he
feels very strongly that French norms must impose themselves on Muslim
modes in France itself; by extension support for a secular Algeria is
easily justified.  The trouble is that such support is totally at
variance with proclamations of democracy. If the Algerian people vote in
favour of a religious state, that is their affair. It is quite
understandable that a secular body like the Army will be hostile to that
switch, but Western support for its imposed military rule must seem
misplaced, given the rule of law and the supremacy of democratic forms
common to all Western constitutions. This is the uncomfortable position
in which French policy makers have placed their own government. At the
very least the Algerian Army is not very likely to moderate its
positions, which are fiercely uncompromising towards fundamentalism,
while it enjoys such powerful foreign backing. And the fundamentalists
for their part have no direct experience of everyday administration,
which might enforce some practical moderation on them, as has already
happened in some respects in Iran.
A more positive French role would seek to reconcile the opposing
Algerian groups, though goodness knows that has become progressively
harder as atrocities multiply. Until some new departure alters French
policy, a safe prediction is that more nasty incidents will disfigure
life in Paris, and possibly other French cities. Race relations within
France will deteriorate further; and that large minority of the
population which is Muslim will feel ever more alienated.

THE subtle torturer bends minds. Manipulates. Twists the emotional and
psychological joints of the victim and turns the screw on the
imagination. This is Amnesty Week, and I'm beginning to wonder if the
personality of the international charity hasn't become warped by
association. Have years of exposure to the worst calculations of state
persecution brutalised the humane propagandists of Amnesty
International? Has the voice of the victim acquired something of the
resonance of the torturer?
During Amnesty Week there's been a series of advertisements in the UK
newspapers. They could have been worse. There were no grisly
photographs, only mug shots with messages: ''Marija cowered in a cellar,
praying the armed men would not find her. But they dragged her out and
took her away . . . Bogdan was an ordinary man who led a quiet life,
loved his wife and got on with the neighbours. Unfortunately this did
not save him from a fate worse than death.''
The real shocker was reserved for the mailshot. I opened an envelope
on Monday morning and found myself looking at the face of a Guatemalan
boy whose eyes had been gouged out, and whose tongue and ears had been
cut off. Fair enough. You can't air-brush the mortuary photographs of
murdered street children to spare the shudders of the liberal breakfast
table. We deny our humanity if we refuse to confront our inhumanity. We
must force ourselves to look into the heart of darkness.
But there was more. There was a plastic ballpoint pen attached to the
Amnesty subscription form with the caption, ''What you hold in your
hands is an instrument of torture''. A taunting challenge followed: ''GO
ON. Tear it off the page. Hold it in your hand. Feel the point. Think
about it. Stretch your imagination. Because that's what torturers around
the world do. They excel at it -- using their imagination to fashion
instruments of torture out of the most everyday things.''
The text went on to describe how the pen was used by interrogators at
the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, but I won't deploy Amnesty
tactics by repeating it. You might end up feeling as I did, which was
patronised by the gross gimmickry of the pen and its message and angrily
disinclined to make another Amnesty donation. Poor, tormented Sok
Tal-yun; you and your ilk are the ones who suffer for the marketing zeal
of your champions.
None of us likes to feel manipulated, even in the noblest cause. The
charitable impulse is a nervous creature at the best of times, with a
highly complex motor system. I'm sure there are people whose spring of
generosity is powered exclusively by the single, shining virtue of
compassion, but most of us give money to charity for a variety of
reasons; some disinterested, others less so.
In the muddier waters of our benevolence is that sense of rectitude
which makes us more comfortable with privilege. The charitable donation
is a kind of sleep-easier tax; we pay a little in order to relax a
little. In our hearts we know that the monthly standing order to Oxfam
is the least painful of commitments (why, it even allows us to ignore
most of their emergency appeals), but it's better than nothing. And if
we were Hindu, the giving of alms would legitimately bring us what we
privately, darkly, superstitiously seek -- merit in the next life. We'd
also settle for good fortune in this one.
If, however, we're less than pure in our philanthropy then the
charitable impulse is easily affronted. If we begin to feel persecuted
by the promotional clamour of the nation's multi-million charity
industry with its professional cadre of administrators, marketing
consultants, advertising directors, and PRs, then we lose the bonus of
comfort returned on our investment.
We begin to feel ''got at'' -- whether by the crude shock of an
Amnesty mailshot or the confiding intimacy of the personal appeal, the
Dear Friend letter (or better still, the Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms
We've-got-your-name-on-our-computerised-mailing-list letter) with its
invitation to ''show love''. When charities use the tools and tricks of
commercial advertising to solicit customers they risk looking more and
more like consumer products in the market-place, at the mercy of its
fickle forces. What's it to be this week? A pound for Help the Aged, a
fiver for Save the Children, or nothing at all? Once it was the
collecting tin on the corner; now it's the telephone sales pitch, the
wad of raffle tickets through the post and the #100,000 scratch card.
Does the end always justify the means? Is there desperation in the
join-'em-if-you-can't-beat-'em mentality of the Royal British Legion or
the suspect methods of the animal welfare charities denounced for
falsifying photographs? Is there integrity? Or have the charities
themselves become victims -- of the graphics and psychobabble of the
style media?
The competition from the Lottery ought to encourage charities to
cherish their supporters rather than alienate them with Lottery values.
(Do you feel you're being benevolent when you buy a Lottery ticket? I
don't. I feel I'm fantasising, and my fantasy doesn't include
loadsamoney for dance companies, much as I love ballet.) Heaven knows
there are few enough supporters around, despite the huge figures raised
by glamorous one-off telethons like Children in Need. According to a
recent survey only 13.7% of British people give more than 50p a week.
The same survey drew up league tables of communities which give
generously and communities which don't. Derbyshire was the county which
delivered both extremes: the affluent spa town of Buxton topped the
philanthropy table and the depressed mining community of Bolsover came
bottom. BBC Radio, as I remember, dispatched a reporter to Bolsover to
question its residents about their mean streak. The vox pop produced the
following exchange.
Reporter: ''Do you ever give money to charity.''
Gruff, elderly, male voice: ''No.''
Reporter: ''Why not?''
Interviewee: ''Too many people on #20,000 a year running 'em.''
The reporter had no answer to that; and neither have I.

LABOUR'S Shadow Cabinet is elected by the party's members in the House
of Commons. A Labour Cabinet in office is picked by the Prime Minister.
That distinction makes the composition of a Labour Shadow Cabinet
somewhat academic, but it hardly detracts from the feeling that the
latest Shadow Cabinet election has produced some very strange results.
It seems remarkable to outside observers that Mrs Margaret Beckett came
top: she was hardly at the forefront of the battle to establish ''new''
Labour, for at the best it was an uncertain note she sounded when
recommending the reforms of both Mr Smith and Mr Blair. Mr Tom Clarke's
re-emergence also seems somewhat peculiar, though it was poor health
which took him from his post as Shadow Scottish Secretary two years ago.
Mr Clarke's success is all the more extraordinary since other able
Scots, more favoured by Mr Blair, such as Messrs Brian Wilson, Henry
McLeish, and Alistair Darling, were passed over. It must be surprising
too that Jack Cunningham was dropped, given his actual experience of
real government. Mr Blair later showed what he thought of that
particular snub by appointing Dr Cunningham to the Shadow Cabinet
anyway; he now holds the post of Shadow National Heritage Secretary. The
truth is that is the very nature of the exercise is silly; the Labour
MPs were indulging themselves in an obscure popularity contest, rather
than composing an actual governmental team.
Mr Dewar's new role as Labour's Chief Whip has excited considerable
interest. He has invested much time and energy in social security; and,
had he been forced to change and able to choose, he would probably have
preferred to return as Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. Yet his
appointment as Chief Whip could prove inspired, especially because a
Labour Government will have serious problems implementing its devolution
pledges, particularly if it has a very small majority. Mr Dewar's long
Scottish experience and commitment to devolution will be invaluable in
this context. He has other qualities which recommend him for the job. He
is a good listener; he is a considerate man, devoid of vindictiveness
and possessed of an ability to work hard and get on well with a wide
range of people. He has moreover that combination of courage and
firmness which is essential for a good Whip. That he may not himself
quite see what a ''natural'' he could be in this role is testimony to
his modesty, though it is also an indication of how he can see beyond
mere partisanship, a good quality for a Whip to possess even if it seems
to contradict his role.
Mr Blair has now allocated responsibilities to those elected. He has
not done so with any particular flair or imagination; but he has been
constricted by the absurdities of the system, and by the frivolous
nature of the voting by some members of the parliamentary Labour Party.
Were he to be Premier, his choices could easily be very different -- and
probably would be. One of the better appointments is that of Chris
Smith, who takes over Donald Dewar's previous role in social security.
The appointments of Clare Short to the transport portfolio and Margaret
Beckett to the trade and industry remit seem less well judged.
Altogether, the events of the past 48 hours, and the hoops he has been
made to jump through by his parliamentary party, must make Mr Blair long
all the more for the realities of government. As Leader of the
Opposition, he is too often required to play at politics.

<HEADLINE>Commons row after Official Solicitor commissions author to write Frederick West book. Law officer defends sale of memoirs</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975798501</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Official Solicitor last night defended his decision to allow the
sale of memoirs by Frederick West.
West did not leave a will when he committed suicide in prison earlier
this year as he faced mass murder charges.
Official Solicitor Peter Harris, who looks after the interests of
those unable to defend their legal rights, was appointed to act as
administrator of the estate.
A statement issued on behalf of Mr Harris yesterday insisted he had an
''overriding duty to protect the financial interests of the five minor
children'' of West.
The statement came amid anger in the Commons that West's family and
others would profit from proceeds of a biography commissioned by the
Official Solicitor.
The Prime Minister agreed with Mr Douglas French, Tory MP for
Gloucester, that the sale of the memoirs was ''extremely distasteful''.
Mr Harris's statement pointed out that he had a ''watching brief'' on
behalf of the five minor children of Frederick and Rosemary West to
protect their interests in relation to press publicity.
''As administrator, it is the Official Solicitor's duty to gather in
the assets of the estate and ensure that the best value is obtained for
them in the interests of the beneficiaries.''
The statement went on: ''Part of the assets of the estate consist of
intellectual property rights in certain material.
''In order to realise the value of those rights, the Official
Solicitor has commissioned an author, Mr Geoffrey Wansell, to write a
book. In common with several other authors, Mr Wansell is attending the
trial of Mrs Rosemary West.''
The statement confirmed Mr Wansell had been allowed access to
background material, including transcripts of police interviews with
Frederick West, before he attended the trial of Mrs West.
The statement also said that West's adult children, although
beneficiaries of the estate, ''might have found it difficult to
distinguish clearly between their own financial interests and those of
the estate if any of them had been appointed to administer the estate''.
Mr French told Mr Major in the Commons that the memoirs were being
sold for #1m and he said the proceeds of any book should not go to
members of the West family, but to the families of the alleged victims.
The Prime Minister replied: ''Personally, I share your feelings about
this matter.''
Mr Major also said it was ''emphatically not the case'' that the
Government was in any way involved in the sale of the rights to West's
papers.
West, 53, was found hanged in his cell at Birmingham Prison on New
Year's day.
Book publishers Headline said last night that figures quoted in the
media for the biography deal were ''vastly inflated''.
''The amount concerned is in keeping with the level of advance any
publisher would expect to pay for an authoritative non-fiction study,''
the company said in a statement.
''It is our understanding that payments other than to the author will
be for the benefit of Frederick West's surviving children.''
Mr Wansell's book is scheduled for publication in the middle of next
year.
Headline's non-fiction publishing editor Alan Brooke said: ''There
will be a number of other books about West and the case, but I feel this
is the only one that will tell the whole story inside the mind of this
extraordinary man.''
Mr Brooke said he had not seen West's memoirs, reportedly entitled I
Only Ever Loved An Angel, which are said to run to some 100 pages.
But he had ''discussed at length'' the writings with the author and
was satisfied of their value to the biography.
Mr Brooke said that, in addition to the memoirs and the police
interviews, Mr Wansell also had also been given access to other
material, though he declined to give further details.
A string of books about the case is expected to be in bookshops after
Mrs West's trial ends.

PERUSING the application form issued by the Grand Lodge of Antient,
Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland, we were shocked to see that the
Brotherhood is not exactly PC.
It goes without saying that women are barred but also, according to an
extract from the masonic constitution and laws: ''An application for
initiation shall not be received from a person who is a deaf mute . . .
but lodges may exercise their discretion as to the initiation of
candidates who are mutilated in, or minus, a limb.
''An application shall not be considered from a person who is totally
blind except by dispensation from the Grand Master Mason, the fee for
which shall be payable by the applicant in addition to his initiation
fee.''
So the masons are deaf to those who cannot speak, levy a surcharge on
those who cannot see, and are not too keen on chaps with bits missing.
(You need all your fingers, presumably, for the handshakes.)
All this from an organisation which boasts on its application form:
''Freemasonry recognises that all men, whether Masons or not, are
Brothers by birth, endowed with the same nature, and sharing the same
hopes.''
And: ''Freemasonary champions the cause of the widow, the fatherless,
the weak and the distressed.'' Unless you're a blind, one-legged, deaf
mute.
Turin cloud
IF Walter Smith and his Rangers boys are looking for any excuses, and
we are sure they are not, for that gubbing by Juventus they should look
no further than the airline which took them to Turin.
Like most airlines, Excalibur Airways have names for each of their
airyplanes. When the Ibrox party boarded at Glasgow Airport, the gantry
was tight against the fuselage and the name was not visible.
When they deplaned in Turin it was via a set of steps and the name of
the plane was clearly to be seen. The team so beloved of the sons of
William had travelled on a plane named after Pope John Paul.
Be warned
WE are very nearly grateful to Mrs Christine Tosh of Prestwick for
sending us the information leaflet which accompanies packets of
Aumentin, an anti-biotic drug.
The section on possible side effects contains the warning: ''See your
doctor straight away if you notice your urine becoming darker or your
faeces (otherwise known as poo) becoming paler.'' Are we talking shite
here, or whit?
All about opinions
WE mentioned how computer salespersons were trying to tempt companies
with voice-activated word processors which were 96.3% accurate and could
make whole generations of audio typists redundant. But what, we asked,
would we do without the keyboard girls who make a wild guess at what the
boss is talking about, get it wrong, and bring the odd smile to the
dismal daily routine.
Stephen Walsh, for instance, has a new book out, Voices of the Old
Firm, which required a typist to transcribe hours of taped interviews
with about 100 players and fans. The typist was a lady from Surrey whose
keyboard skills far outweighed her knowledge of Glasgow football and the
nuances of the language in which it is discussed.
Thus Mr Walsh had to deal in the transcript with such phrases as ''the
Celtic fans were singing Hell Glories for St Patrick''.
Among the teams mentioned were Hibernium, Party Thistle, Borussia
Doorman, and Wisla Cracker. Then there were football grounds such as
Han-Dome, Enfield -- home of Liverpool -- and Sheffield, where Clyde
used to play.
Stephen was particularly proud of a Jock Stein quote involving Celtic
goalkeeper Denis Connaghan after the custodian of the onion-bag had
suffered the indignity of throwing the ball into his own net. Jock said
to his keeper: ''Denis, you're useless, worse than Haffey -- at least
Frank Haffey could sing.''
This appeared on the transcript as: ''Denis, you're useless, worse
than happy -- at least on the flank a happy thing.'' The lady had the
good sense to put a question mark beside this particular section.
Wings clipped
AS part of Operation Eagle, the anti-drugs campaign, Strathclyde polis
are encouraging youthful participation by issuing an Eaglet card. With
this, the weans qualify for various free offers and discounts.
We hear that a young participant was mugged in Govan and the only item
stolen was the Eaglet card, entitling the attacker to a free Big Mac.
The last act
ACTOR Jonathan Hartman has bequeathed his skull to the Royal
Shakespeare Company. A noble gesture? Yes, but he adds: ''I would
obviously like to work for the RSC while I am alive but, as they never
answer my letters, I thought I'd offer to work for them when I'm dead.
''Think of the benefits -- no lines to learn, no stage fright, and
rapturous applause every night.''
Lest we forget
READERS with long memories may recall a correspondence in the Diary on
the subject of pub quizzes and how they can lead to contention and
disharmony. Well, Assynt has risen in anger about our account of the
quiz night at the Inchnadamph Hotel.
In the two letters of complaint, the kinder words used to describe the
Diary's reportage are ''rubbish'' and ''nasty''. The folk of Assynt were
basically upset at any suggestion they might have been less than
friendly and welcoming to visitors who took part in the quiz.
We apologise to Mr and Mrs Clint, the owners of the hotel, which is
famed for its warm welcome; to Jess Thomas, organiser of the quiz which
was to raise funds for a children's play park; to Norman Macaskill, OBE,
JP, who set the local questions section; to anyone we accused of passing
the answers round in Gaelic even though Ms Thomas, who is Welsh, tells
us fewer than 5% of the population speak the language; to all the people
in Assynt whether they were at the quiz night or night.
Any chance of dousing those fiery crosses?

Brussels
A VAST backlog of claims worth millions of pounds over NHS
prescription charges awaits the Government after it lost another battle
in the European courts yesterday.
Judges at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that men
aged between 60 and 65 in Britain suffer illegal discrimination as they
have to pay for prescriptions while women over 60, their pensionable
age, get them free.
The ruling delighted Opposition politicians but enraged Tory
Euro-sceptics, with Mr John Redwood demanding that Britain return to the
days when the House of Lords was the final Court of Appeal in the United
Kingdom.
The Government has agreed to accept the court's findings. Health
Minister Gerry Malone said claims would be accepted from men over 60 who
had had to pay for their prescriptions and claim forms would be
appearing in the press.
The judges made their decision retrospective which means that the
Government faces a bill of more than #500m even before future charges
are calculated, one source estimated yesterday.
Mr Cyril Richardson, a retired lecturer with asthma, had complained to
the courts in England, and his case was referredto Luxembourg. The
Government had argued that European law did not affect NHS prescriptions
policy.
However, the judges threw out that claim and ruled: ''Although the
fact that the elderly will generally incur more prescription charges
than younger people at a time when they will normally have less
disposable income may provide some justification for exempting them from
prescription charges above a certain age, that consideration does not
require this benefit to be granted at statutory pensionable age and
therefore at different ages for men and women.''
For Mr Richardson, a 66-year-old retired town crier in Walsall, the
verdict was a personal triumph after a two-year fight which he said was
fought on principle. Around 1,400,000 men aged between 60 and 65 will
now benefit.
''I was paying about #50 a year in prescription charges but I haven't
even kept the receipts,'' said Mr Richardson, ''so I don't know if I
will be claiming the money back. My main concern was that people should
have the opportunity to redress a wrong that has been going on too
long.''
Mr Don Steele, executive director of the Association of Retired
Persons Over 50 (ARPO-50) which backed Mr Richardson said: ''It's great
news and will have an enormous effect on the lives of more than
1,000,000 men. It will mean they don't have to be afraid to go to the
doctors any more . . .
''For too long in this country we have been discriminating between men
and women over pensions, bus passes, and a lot of other things. This is
a great victory and it may lead to others.''
The European Court has already ruled that making men wait until 65 for
state pensions is not illegal discrimination provided the pensions paid
are the same as those for women who qualify at the age of 60. A
challenge on making men wait until they are 65 for a bus pass is in the
pipeline.
However, Tayside North MP Mr Bill Walker condemned the ruling on
prescriptions. He said: ''A lot of people over 60 will be delighted but
the fact is that this is another example of Europe interfering in what
should be a British decision.
''While I am confident that this particular ruling will receive a lot
of support, others will be wary of the implications. It is a
double-edged sword.''
The British Medical Association reacted by asking for a ''full
review'' of the prescription charge exemption system. A spokeswoman
said: ''The system is full of anomalies.''
She added that it was too early to say whether the ruling would affect
how frequently doctors would give prescriptions to men over 60.
The Scottish Pensioners' Forum welcomed what they called ''an end to
discrimination'' and called for the Government to equalise the
retirement age for both sexes at 60.
Administrator Ann Garscadden said: ''Our members are delighted.''
Age Concern Scotland information manager Liz Mitchell said the
decision had been overdue.
''We have been campaigning for this for a long time.'' she said.
However, she admitted that funding the ruling would create a significant
strain on the health service.

Suddenly there's a familiar face to New Labour. Geoffrey Parkhouse
explains how the Shadow Cabinet elections put the leadership in a spin
TONY BENN observed recently: ''When you get to No 10, you've climbed
there on a little ladder called 'the status quo'. And when you're there,
the status quo looks very good.'' Benn did not bother to vote in the
Shadow Cabinet elections.
Yesterday, many of his MP colleagues, who have done their time at the
Commons, were beginning to understand why. If Labour gets to power next
year the 19 winners will be Tony Blair's first Cabinet.
The result thwarted his attempts to get fresh blood first off into
Cabinet. The 19 names look very much like the status quo, while talented
fresh faces were in the list of runners-up.
Brian Wilson, Henry McLeish, Alistair Darling, Richard Caborn, Nick
Brown, Hilary Armstrong -- these are just six of the losers. Others,
like Frank Field, Jeff Rooker, and Andrew Smith, the Shadow Treasury
Secretary did not even bother to stand in the full knowledge that in
this popularity contest they had no chance.
Granny Joan Lester will be in a Labour Cabinet next year by right. So
will Defence spokesman David Clark and so will Tom Clarke, the spokesman
for Disabled. This has come of something of a shock to Blair aides who
worked very hard over the past few months to get the ''right'' people on
and the ''right'' people off. This may have been counterproductive. The
spin-doctoring arts of Peter Mandelson may have actually prevented Blair
getting the Shadow Cabinet that he wanted.
Tom Clarke, the erstwhile Scottish Secretary, now in charge of the
Disabled brief at least adds to the ecumenism of this putative first
Blair Cabinet, being the only Catholic in it. He also lobbied
assiduously, sending postcards out to colleagues (one received three in
a week) and by asking people to vote not for him but for the disabled.
He was successful in regaining a place on the Shadow Cabinet with 107
votes. Others were not. Jack Cunningham, who actually has experience as
a Minister, failed to lobby his case sufficiently at the Labour Party
conference -- he had to leave it because his local mayor died -- and at
the Commons over the past few days.
Donald Dewar was always going to get elected handsomely on to the
Shadow Cabinet because his abilities are widely recognised by friend and
foe. The parliamentary party cannot be admonished for re-electing him
(156). He has spent the past two years taking a firm grasp of the
mesmerising problems of Social Security.
Blair alone is responsible for the decision to make him chief whip --
an appointment that has puzzled the Labour Party ever since it was first
mooted a month ago. In any event, this is an exceedingly able man being
given a brand new challenge.
That's not usually the way it goes in Shadow Cabinet elections at the
Commons. People are voted on and off for a variety of reasons, some of
them very short-term ones. It is no way for the parliamentary party to
inform the nation of its opinion of the calibre of the people it wants
to see in Government after 16 years.
Yesterday Blair was striving to correct this bizarre result. On
Wednesday he was phoning colleagues to tell them that they were sacked.
Yesterday he was phoning other colleagues to bring them into the team,
albeit not into his Shadow Cabinet which is beyond his power.
A growing view within the party is that this should be the last of
these Shadow Cabinet elections and that Blair should take one more step
to reform his party and seek the power to appoint only those whom he
considers sufficiently able to serve in opposition, let alone
Government.
There are now six Scots in the Shadow Cabinet and six women. Well and
good. But the result is supposed to ''guide'' the leader in what job he
gives to whom. Margaret Beckett topped Robin Cook and Gordon Brown in
the poll and if Blair took this seriously he might feel that she ought
to be Shadow Chancellor or Shadow Foreign Secretary.
Of course he won't do this, but Beckett, by coming top of the poll,
has to be considered for a serious job and this will be shadowing Ian
Lang as President of the Board of Trade.
If Blair had felt there was someone better for this particular job,
her popularity in the parliamentary Labour Party as expressed by her 187
votes proscribes his room for manoeuvre. Is she that much more able than
Brian Wilson (88), Henry McLeish (50), Alistair Darling (67) or indeed
Jack Cunningham (100)? Tom Clarke got seven more votes than Cunningham
and this would put him in the Cabinet if there is a General Election
victory next year for Labour.
You only have to pose this question to judge that the Shadow Cabinet
election is a waste of time and effort and does Labour no service as it
gets nearer to power and to the twenty-first century.
Some Labour MPs believe that the voting was a result of Blair running
ahead of the true mood of his party. Other MPs argue that it is a sign
that Blair is running behind the mood of his party. But there are so
many reasons why people get voted on to the Shadow Cabinet that it is
not going to be as simple as that.
What has been made clear is that Blair does not need an annual Shadow
Cabinet election and this may well be the last one. If there is not a
General Election next year he may make his next big reforming news by
persuading the parliamentary Labour Party to abandon the process and
allow him to choose a team that can be presented to the country as a
complete offering of the best talent that Labour can provide.
As things stand Ron Davies (you say who? -- he is the Welsh spokesman)
comes fourth in the poll with 157 votes. David Clark, the Defence
spokesman (who?) got 141, Michael Meacher the Transport spokesman scored
121. Nobody's quite sure why.
The only MPs who conduct a ''slate'' in these elections now are the
left-wing Campaign Group. And they've got a few scores to settle against
Blair and the Shadow Cabinet election gives them an opportunity. It is a
rare chance to break the iron discipline of a power-hungry party as
evidenced at the Brighton conference a fortnight ago.
There throughout the week, in which the conference for the first time
in its history denied itself the luxury of voting against the platform
even once, there were many stiff upper lips. ''We are only doing this
because we have to'' was the buzz phrase in private. ''We cannot face
another long term in opposition.''
Behind the scenes at Brighton, throughout the summer, and at the
Commons on its return last Monday Peter ''Bobby'' Mandelson, the ace
spin doctor has been at work. He used his time as a Labour whip to serve
Blair by lobbying to get the Blair ''luvvies'' -- the women and men who
are in the New Labour mould -- promoted. Those that do not fit this
description have been lobbied against.
Yesterday there was a distinct sense that a rebellion in the secrecy
of the ballot has taken place against this heavy pressure. And so Blair
may have got an incomplete Shadow Cabinet as a result of a defiant
two-finger salute.
It may be their last chance for this kind of revolt. The Shadow
election pantomime seems doomed. But it might damage Blair's chances
were the electorate to take it seriously.

THE Equal Opportunities Commission yesterday welcomed a House of Lords
judgment which found that a company was guilty of sex discrimination
when it dismissed a woman employee when she discovered she was pregnant,
shortly after being recruited to cover for a colleague taking maternity
leave.
However, there was widespread disappointment among equal opportunities
campaigners that the court restricted itself to the facts of this case
and did not give a clear ruling on the wider issue of whether pregnancy
is considered an illness or a unique condition under UK law.
The House of Lords decision, based on a ruling of the European Court
of Justice, means that Mrs Carole Webb, of West Drayton, Middlesex, is
entitled to compensation even though she would not have got the job if
her employer had known of her pregnancy when she applied for it.
The case in question, Webb v Emo Air Cargo, first started in 1987,
when Mrs Webb, who was on an open-ended contract, was dismissed for
being pregnant.
Her claim was unsuccessful in the Industrial Tribunal, Employment
Appeal Tribunal, and the Court of Appeal on the grounds that dismissing
a pregnant woman was only unlawful when it could be shown that a man
would have been treated as unfavourably in similar circumstances.
The House of Lords referred the case to the European Court of Justice
which decided that it was a breach of European Community Law to dismiss
a woman recruited for an indefinite period on the grounds of pregnancy
even though she was replacing someone on maternity leave.
Pregnancy, they stated, should not be compared with a man's incapacity
to work for medical or other reasons. The ECJ referred the case back to
the House of Lords, whose decision was announced yesterday.
Lord Keith of Kinkel said that the only way to fit the European ruling
into UK law was to hold that, in Mrs Webb's case, her pregnancy was a
''relevant circumstance'' which led to her being treated less favourably
than a man on the ground of her sex.
Lords Griffiths, Browne-Wilkinson, Mustill, and Slynn agreed.
The case was sent back to the industrial tribunal for assessment of
compensation.
The Lords emphasised that the result might be different in the case of
a woman employed for a fixed period, or on a short-term contract, during
the whole of which her pregnancy would make her unavailable for work.
The chairwoman of the EOC, Ms Kamlesh Bahl, said: ''The EOC is pleased
that at last there is a favourable decision for Mrs Webb and a ruling
which gives pregnant women on open-ended contracts the right to
protection against dismissal.''

When the wolf's at the door do you invite him in? Bruce McKain
considers the dilemma of the Faculty of Advocates
THE arrival of that legal phenomenon, the solicitor-advocate, caused
much soul-searching in the august corridors of Parliament House, home of
the Faculty of Advocates.
Traditionally, members of the Faculty enjoyed the exlusive right to
plead in Scotland's supreme courts, the High Court and Court of Session.
Solicitors were restricted to appearing in the lower courts. That was
until 1993 when the first solicitor-advocates (no-one has yet come up
with a snappier name, or at least one that is printable) arrived on the
scene.
Mrs Thatcher apparently took the view that this new legal hybrid would
increase competition as well as provide a wider and more flexible choice
of legal representative for the public.
There are now more than 70 solicitor-advocates in Scotland, 50 with
rights of audience in the High Court, providing strong and increasing
competition for advocates, especially in the High Court in Glasgow. Not
surprisingly, solicitor advocates have not exactly been welcomed with
open arms by many members of the Bar who see them as a threat to their
bread and butter.
Even without the threat of the solicitor-advocate, the Faculty of
Advocates is nearing a membership of 400, bigger than it has ever been,
the competition for work is intense and not everyone at the Bar is
making a living. There have already been signs of tension between the
Faculty and the Law Society of Scotland, the solicitors' governing body,
particularly over the idea of ''mixed-doubles'', counsel and
solicitor-advocate being instructed to appear together for the same
client.
The idea was knocked firmly on the head by the then Dean of the
Faculty, Alan Johnston QC, a policy continued by his successor, Andrew
Hardie QC, and criticised by the Law Society as restricting choice for
clients.
Now the Faculty is facing another agonising choice, to be voted on by
a meeting of its 368 members. Should it provide training in the skills
of pleading to members of the solicitors' branch of the profession,
including solicitor-advocates?
To some, the answer is obvious. If the wolf is at the door why commit
professional suicide by inviting him in? As a recent report by the
Faculty Council put it: ''If the Faculty offers training to solicitors
in advocacy skills the Faculty would help to train its competitors.
''The view is that all or at least some of the solicitors attending
the courses will do so with the objective of acquiring skills to enable
them to displace members of Faculty from litigations, which would
otherwise be conducted solely by counsel.''
There is also a concern that the Faculty's resources will be stretched
too far with the result that its own newly-installed internal training
programme for new entrants will suffer.
To some extent the Faculty is facing a dilemma based on the fact that
solicitors are responsible for instructing the vast bulk of work carried
out by advocates. Should it treat solicitors as potential customers for
whom the welcome mat should be extended or potential competitors to be
kept at arm's-length?
There are a number of persuasive arguments in favour of the Faculty
providing training for solicitors. For one thing it would be seen as
making a generous gesture in the public interest by contributing to a
general raising of standards in the courtrooms of Scotland.
On a more mercenary level, by organising advocacy-skills programmes
for solicitors, the Faculty could also generate a substantial amount of
cash that would otherwise go elsewhere. The training exercise could also
be seen as a PR and marketing exercise for the Bar, informing its
customers, the solicitors, the services the Faculty can offer.
While some advocates oppose any immediate decision being taken on the
issue, the Council of the Faculty thinks differently. One reason for
this is the arrival of a possible competitor in training stakes -- NITA
-- which is a joint venture involving Nottingham Trent University and
the National Institute for Trial Advocacy.
NITA would like to provide advocacy skills training programmes for
solicitors in Scotland and be recognised as a centre of excellence for
that purpose. So, if the Faculty decides not to offer a training
programme for solicitors, perhaps even in co-operation with NITA, it is
likely that a training course will go ahead anyway, and it is probable
that individual members of the Bar will be asked to participate.
The Dean of Faculty takes the view that he has no power to prevent an
individual member taking part in a course of that kind. It seems that
the Faculty is caught between a rock and a hard place and there is a
marked difference of opinion about the best course of action.
However the vote turns out, it will leave many members of Faculty
distinctly unhappy.

Larnaca
A BRITISH soldier accused of killing a Danish tour guide claimed today
that a policeman hit him on the head with a rifle after he and his
companions were arrested the night the woman was kidnapped.
The testimony of Private Jeff Parnell, 24, of Oldbury, west Midlands,
was identical to earlier claims made by the other two defendants,
Privates Alan Ford, 27, of Birmingham, and Justin Fowler, 27, of
Falmouth, Cornwall.
They were the defendants' first testimonies in court since the trial
began in April after months of legal wrangling following their arrest on
the night of September 12 last year.
''Police kept asking us 'where's the girl, what have you done with the
girl,' but none of us replied and they started kicking and punching
us,'' Parnell said.
He said the three men were ordered at gunpoint to enter the police
station next to the road block where they had been stopped.
''I asked why we were at the police station? The policeman hit me on
the head with a rifle. I was hit on the right side of the head with the
barrel of the gun and fell down. He then jumped on me and continued to
hit me,'' added Parnell.
The proceedings have been stalled by a so-called ''trial within a
trial'' over the admissibility of prosecution evidence. The defence
argues that the police had acted unlawfully at the time of arrest.
All three men have pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter,
kidnapping and conspiracy to rape 23-year-old tour guide Louise Jensen
in the resort of Ayia Napa.
They were detained at a police roadblock 90 minutes after Miss
Jensen's Greek Cypriot boyfriend raised the alarm, saying she had been
abducted by three men in a car.
Police found bloodstains on the soldiers' civilian clothes, in their
car and on a shovel in the vehicle.
Jensen's naked and battered body was found in a shallow grave near
Ayia Napa two days later.
Defence lawyers argue that the soldiers' arrest by Cypriot police
after they refused to produce identify papers was unlawful because they
were not read their rights, thus making the bloodstains evidence
inadmissible.
Ford said yesterday his shoulder was dislocated when a police
interrogator wrenched his arm behind his back shortly after his arrest.
Fowler, who testified on Tuesday, also complained that he was
ill-treated by police.
The trial continues of the three, who were all serving with the Royal
Green Jackets Regiment based at the British base of Dhekelia, near Ayia
Napa, at the time of their arrest.--AP.

EMPLOYERS and employees alike may well be disappointed by yesterday's
ruling by the House of Lords in what was expected to be a landmark case.
Webb v Emo Air Cargo (UK) Ltd, it was hoped, would settle crucial issues
in sex discrimination and employment law.
In the event, there is only one clear winner -- Mrs Carole Webb -- who
has won her claim that her employers breached the Sex Discrimination
Act, 1975. For other women, there are hints that British law may now
accept that pregnancy is not an illness and is in fact a unique
condition.
It does show, however, the significance of European law over domestic
law and may also indicate that although the UK did not sign up to the
Social Chapter, European employment policy may still enter our workplace
through the backdoor of the European Court of Justice.
0 Some commentators may feel that the judges sitting in the House of
Lords have ducked the issue. Others may say, rather, that they decided
simply to rule on the particular facts of Mrs Webb's circumstances.
There is little doubt that this is a complicated case, and as one
employment law specialist, Miss Diane Nicol of the Glasgow law firm
McGrigor Donald, said yesterday: ''Difficult cases often make bad law.''
The decision, based on a ruling of the European Court of Justice,
means that Carole Webb is entitled to unlimited compensation -- the
exact amount will be decided by an industrial tribunal. Had her case
been brought on a claim of unfair dismissal, and she had won, her
compensation element would have been limited to #11,300.
Mrs Webb, of West Drayton, Middlesex, was appointed by EMO Air Cargo
(UK) Ltd as an import operations clerk in 1987. She was told the job was
available because another clerk, Valerie Stewart, would be leaving to
have a baby. Two months into a six-month training period under Mrs
Stewart, Mrs Webb found she was expecting a baby at about the same time.
The company's managing director said he had no alternative but to
dismiss her because she would not be available at the time she was
needed.
An industrial tribunal rejected her claim that her dismissal
constituted sex discrimination, ruling that the real reason for her
sacking was her anticipated inability to cover Mrs Stewart's job while
she was away.
A man who was similarly incapable of fulfilling the task for medical
or other reasons would have been dismissed in the same way, it argued.
Mrs Webb unsuccessfully challenged the ruling in the Employment Appeal
Tribunal and the Court of Appeal before taking her case to the Law
Lords.
In November 1992, the Lords referred the case to Europe to decide
whether the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act clashed with EU laws, which
stated that the principle of equal treatment between men and women
''shall mean that there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds
of sex either directly or indirectly by reference in particular to
marital or family status''.
In July last year, the European Court said a pregnant woman could not
be compared to a medically unfit man because pregnancy was not an
illness. The court pointed out that Mrs Webb, although specially
required to cover during her colleague's maternity leave, had in fact
been recruited for an indefinite period.
Therefore her dismissal for being unable to fulfil her contract during
her own maternity leave was in breach of EU laws designed to protect
pregnant women. That protection was not dependent on whether her
presence at work was essential to her employer, the court heard.
When the case returned to the House of Lords yesterday, Lord Keith of
Kinkel said the only way to fit the European ruling into UK law was to
hold that, in Mrs Webb's case, her pregnancy was a ''relevant
circumstance'' which led to her being treated less favourably than a man
on the ground of her sex.
However, he stressed that the result might be different in the case of
a woman employed for a fixed period during the whole of which her
pregnancy would make her unavailable for work, such as employment
specifically during Wimbledon fortnight or the Olympic Games.
In its own judgment, the European Court of Justice -- traditionally
viewed as pro-feminist in its rulings -- left the door open on the issue
of women employed on a temporary contract.
Miss Nicol, looking at yesterday's House of Lords judgment, said:
''They are making the distinction, which Europe made, between a woman
engaged for an indefinite period, which most workers are, as opposed to
those employed for a temporary period. They are saying that pregnancy is
a relevant circumstance but that for a woman on a temporary contract it
is not necessarily going to be a relevant circumstance, so they have
left the door open.''
She added: ''Lawyers had hoped that the House of Lords would give
employers clear guidance as to how pregnant women should be treated and
they have not done that. They have fudged the issue, possibly because
they feel that European law goes too far to help pregnant women.''
Women's legal rights have, on balance, been strengthened by the
ruling, but there are still too many grey areas. Still in the pipeline
is another case, Gillespie, awaiting a decision from the European Court
of Justice on whether it is discriminatory not to pay women full pay
during maternity leave. Let it not be forgotten, however, that it was a
European directive which gave women the right to 14 weeks' maternity
leave even within the first two years of employment, while until that
point, under UK law, she would have had to wait for two years before
acquiring those rights.

Moscow
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin, ignoring the world's television
cameras, shocked two women secretaries by pinching their backs as he
prepared for a news conference today.
He was filmed as he tweaked them between the shoulder blades in a
seemingly casual gesture that marked yet another public indiscretion by
the burly Russian leader.
Yeltsin's display of political incorrectness came amid the gilt
splendour of a state chamber at a briefing for US and Russian reporters
ahead of a visit to France and the United States.
The first woman, sitting dressed in a brown patterned blouse, jumped
with surprise as Yeltsin pinched her on the back as he passed by.
The second sat still as she was pinched, before turning and staring
back at Yeltsin. Her comment was inaudible.
Yeltsin said ''hello'' as he pinched the two women and went on to his
seat.
The Russian president, whose aides later professed to know nothing of
the incident, has a history of shocking the public and embarrassing his
hosts.
A presidential spokesman, asked about today's twin tweaking, said:''
Nobody here at the moment saw it, so we do not know what happened.''
Kremlin officials have frequently had to fend off accusations that he
has had one or two drinks too many.
He himself has denied any alcohol problems, widely reported by both
Russian and world news media.
In Berlin to mark the departure of Russian troops from Germany in
August last year, Yeltsin appeared unsteady after a champagne lunch.
Then he seized the baton to conduct a military band, astonishing
onlookers with an impromptu energetic performance.
In another highly publicised incident Yeltsin failed to get out of his
plane to meet Ireland's then-premier Albert Reynolds the following month
during a stopover at Shannon airport.
Aides said at the time he had a slight indisposition because of the
pressures of a meeting with US President Bill Clinton. Yeltsin,
disembarking in Moscow, said he had overslept.
In a rare statement last April detailing the president's state of
health, Yeltsin's spokesman said he suffers from high blood pressure
which can cause sporadic muscle weakness.
In March 1993 a halting speech from a dishevelled Yeltsin scandalised
deputies in parliament and prompted one opposition deputy to exclaim:
''The president was dead drunk. He's a sick man.''
Today he walked stiffly and spoke slowly, sprinking the occasional
non-sequitur into his speech.
But the 64-year-old president, who spent two weeks in hospital with
heart problems during the summer, did not look ill.
Yeltsin, who comes from Sverdlovsk in the Urals, central Russia, is a
former civil engineer, who became a communist politician.

Moscow
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin took a tough line today in the run-up to
Monday's US-Russian summit, blasting Nato expansion plans and announcing
the skids are under his Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, the man who has
helped forge close ties with the West.
Yeltsin used a meeting with reporters in the Kremlin to restate
Russia's resistance to joining a Bosnia peacekeeping force if it is
under Nato command.
He warned he would resist any Alliance plans to deploy nuclear arms
close to Russia's borders if it expands into eastern Europe.
Reiterating Russia's opposition to Nato expansion, he said Moscow
might have to take ''protective moves to prevent expansion'', but gave
no hint of what he meant.
''We propose a European security system which would exclude the
expansion of Nato and the presence of nuclear weapons in the countries
of eastern and central Europe,'' said Yeltsin, looking robust and in
fighting mood.
He called the presence of nuclear weapons in his backyard
''impermissible''.
''There would again be two blocs,'' he said.
Striking a more optimistic note he said he still hoped he and Clinton
would be able to keep Russian-American ties on track at their summit in
New York.
''I am sure that after the meeting with Bill Clinton we will find a
way to agree. He wants this and I want it,'' he said.
Bosnia and Nato are expected to dominate Yeltsin's first summit with
Clinton since the 64-year-old Kremlin chief had a mild heart attack in
July. The last summit was in Moscow in May.
In a move likely to cause concern in Western capitals, Yeltsin made it
clear Kozyrev will be sacked, although no replacement has yet been
named.
Kozyrev, 44, became foreign minister in 1990 and has helped build up
ties with the West. However, he has lost favour after accusations in
Moscow that he let Russia be sidelined over Bosnia.
''Kozyrev's departure will put foreign governments in a tizzy because
they will take it as a signal of a change in policy,'' a Moscow-based
Western diplomat said.
Yeltsin and Kozyrev were both due to leave today for Paris where
Yeltsin will have talks with President Jacques Chirac. He will leave on
Saturday for New York to attend the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the United Nations before Monday's summit.
The decision to sack Kozyrev, the longest-serving minister in
post-Soviet Russia, came almost off-handedly in response to a question.
Yeltsin said he remained dissatisfied with Kozyrev's work and that he
had been unable to coordinate foreign policy with other ministries.
In an extraordinary remark, he added: ''Let him work for now. But my
decision will stay.''
Kozyrev's likely removal reflects widespread discontent in Russia over
the decline in its influence since it dropped out of the superpower
ranks.
The move also provides the Kremlin with a scapegoat for foreign policy
failures in Bosnia and elsewhere in the run-up to parliamentary and
presidential elections.--AP.

Patrick Brogan writes: The United States expects that it will have to
deploy troops in Bosnia for about a year after a peace agreement comes
into effect, but President Clinton declined an invitation today to
promise that American forces would be needed for no longer than that.
At a press conference today he said that the first thing to remember
in the debate is that the presidents of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia
are coming to the US at the end of the month for ''proximity talks.''
They will gather at an air force base in Dayton, Ohio, in the solid
Midwest, far from the distractions of Washington or New York.
If they agree to an honourable peace and stick to it, the president
said, UN forces would not be needed for more than a year.

Sarajevo
SERBIAN troops today seized four miles of ground in northwest Bosnia
in an apparent breach of the week-old ceasefire.
''The Bosnian Serbs launched a two-pronged offensive north of Sanski
Most on Wednesday. They have captured about four miles of territory
south of Prijedor,'' said a military source.
A spokesman in the government army's 5th Corps confirmed the loss.
''Yes we lost some territory yesterday. The Serbs have incessantly
violated the ceasefire from the beginning,'' said the spokesman at the
Corp's headquarters at Bihac.
In a separate report the 5th Corps said in a statement: ''In the past
24 hours all defence lines were attacked by the aggressor's artillery
and infantry.
''The most intense attacks were in the Sanski Most area where the
aggressor used all available weapons in an attempt to provoke a wider
conflict.''
The government captured Sanski Most from the Serbs eight days ago,
just before the ceasefire went into force throughout Bosnia.
Artillery duels have continued north of the town every day, with each
side blaming the other for starting or provoking battles in violation of
the truce, which has largely held in the rest of the republic.
American peace envoy Richard Holbrooke said earlier that he believed
the war was tapering off despite the fighting in the northwest.
''Our understanding is that the fighting is dying down. There's still
artillery fire but I don't think there's much movement in terms of the
land lines,'' he said.
He said he had stressed to the presidents of Bosnia, Serbia, and
Croatia ''that all of us in the US government believe a ceasefire is a
ceasefire is ceasefire, and it's time for the fighting to stop and for
the talks to begin''.
Peace diplomacy received a boost when Holbrooke said Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman had promised not to try to retake the Serb-held
region of Eastern Slavonia by force while peace talks were progressing.
''President Tudjman assured us that while he retains his rights to use
whatever means he thinks are necessary to deal with the problem, there
will not be fighting in Eastern Slavonia, that he commits himself to the
search for a peaceful settlement in Croatia,'' Holbrooke said.
There had been fears that a Croatian attempt to take Eastern Slavonia
could suck in Serbia, which it borders, igniting an even more serious
Balkan war and scuttling the current peace drive.
Croatia has retaken two other regions seized by the Serbs in 1991 when
they rebelled against Zagreb's break from Yugoslavia and had threatened
to do the same in Eastern Slavonia if there was no diplomatic
breakthrough by the end of next month.
Meanwhile, French officials voiced growing fears today for the lives
of two French airmen shot down over Bosnia after Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic said they had been kidnapped from a hospital.
They said Foreign Minister Herve de Charette did not believe
Karadzic's ''grotesque'' claim and would not let the Bosnian Serbs duck
responsibility for the pilots, whose fighter-bomber was shot down near
the Bosnian Serb ''capital'' of Pale on August 29.

POSTAL workers said yesterday they would oppose Royal Mail plans to
reduce second deliveries but the prospect of industrial action receded
after talks in Edinburgh.
Branch officers of the Communication Workers' Union protested last
week at a proposal to axe 500 full-time jobs in Scotland and Northern
Ireland and said they would call for a ballot on industrial action,
probably around Christmas.
A joint statement yesterday said Royal Mail had plans to reduce
full-time jobs by about 300 by the end of March without the use of
compulsory redundancy. The CWU had noted this planned reduction but did
not accept it was necessary. The proposals would be addressed using the
normal joint negotiating process.
The joint statement said Royal Mail would review the position of all
staff with temporary contracts for longer than 12 months and would offer
substantive employment where possible.
Mr John Keggie, the CWU's divisional officer, said the outstanding
unresolved point was management plans to amalgamate second deliveries.
The union had made it clear it would campaign to defend these.

Baghdad
MORE than five years of UN economic sanctions have brought Iraq to the
brink of famine, a report warned today.
Iraq can no longer produce even half the food grain and vegetable oil
it needs, and could run out of sugar and baby milk next year, said a
study by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation released in Baghdad.
''Unless some immediate remedial action is taken to avert the present
critical food and nutritional shortage, the Iraqi population will face a
famine situation,'' said FAO official Amir Khalil.
Iraq needs #1.8 billion to import enough food to meet shortages caused
by sanctions, the report said
''The efforts of both the government and international organisations
are grossly inadequate in relation to the problems faced by the
agriculture sector of Iraq,'' it added.
After the sanctions were imposed the Baghdad regime's generous food
rations prevented a catastrophe for a few years. But rations to Iraq's
20 million people have been substantially reduced as the sanctions have
taken their toll.
During a visit to Iraq in the summer FAO officials studied children
under the age of five in one district of the capital and found that 28%
of them were stunted, 29% underweight and 12% wasted.
Infant mortality has doubled, the report said.
Dictator Saddam Hussein has repeatedly turned down a UN offer that
would allow him to sell oil on the international market and use the
money to buy food and medicine.

Brussels
BELGIUM'S parliament voted today to send Nato Secretary-General Willy
Claes to the country's highest court to answer allegations of
corruption, leaving his hold on the top Nato job dangling by a thread.
The vote, which essentially lifted Claes's immunity gained when he was
a minister, was 97 to 52 with one blank.
''The chamber has decided that there are enough indications to order a
referral of Claes to the Cour de Cassation and to enable a continuation
of the investigation,'' Raymond Langendries, president of the lower
house, said after the vote.
Claes pleaded his case before the assembly, vehemently denying any
wrong-doing in the affair that has dogged him throughout his turbulent
one-year tenure at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
''I am totally innocent. I asked at least to have the elementary right
of defence,'' a grim-faced Claes told reporters successively in Dutch,
French and English after his appearance.
He left the immediate question of his job at Nato hanging but hinted a
decision could come tomorrow. ''You'll hear more about it tomorrow,'' he
said.
He was widely expected to step down from Nato if the vote went against
him.
''It will be very difficult for Claes to remain at Nato now,'' Belgian
MP Karel van Hoorebeke, an opponent of Claes's Socialist Party, said.
Claes has repeatedly said he is innocent of allegations dating back to
when he was Belgian economic affairs minister in the late 1980s.
He is accused of knowing and having done nothing about payments
alleged to have been made by two foreign defence firms -- Italy's Agusta
and France's Dassault -- to win his Socialist Party's backing for major
contracts.
Both companies have denied wrong-doing.
Earlier, the packed meeting of the 150-member lower house also
approved a high court request to continue its investigation into the
role former defence minister Guy Coeme played in the
bribes-for-defence-orders scandal.
A newspaper poll showed 93% of Belgians thought Claes should resign
from Nato.
The United States, the biggest force in Nato, has repeatedly praised
his record at the alliance.
Three main candidates for his post have already emerged -- former
Dutch premier Ruud Lubbers, Hans van den Broek, the European Union's
external affairs commissioner and a former Dutch foreign minister, and
former Danish foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen.--Reuter.

Paris
FRANCE vowed today to reject ''blackmail'' by Algerian Muslim
extremists suspected of a spate of bomb attacks in France and denied
accusations that Paris was siding with the government in Algeria's civil
war.
''French policy is not set by external blackmail, is not determined by
threats and pressure,'' Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told the
Senate, the upper house of parliament.
Leaders of Algeria's two main secular opposition parties joined
Islamic movements today in warning Paris against giving its blessing to
a ''phoney'' presidential vote on November 16, which military ruler
Liamine Zeroual seems certain to win.
De Charette defended President Jacques Chirac's controversial plan to
meet Zeroual in New York next week.
An exiled Algerian ex-premier said the Algerian security services
could well be manipulating the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which has
claimed responsibility for the bombings in France that have killed seven
people and wounded more than 170.
''In Algeria, the security services have infiltrated several small
groups opposed to the government. We have proof that they have provoked
fratricidal armed attacks,'' Abdelhamid Brahimi told the French daily le
Figaro.
Police fear that the latest bomb, wounding 29 people aboard an
underground train in Paris on Tuesday, may be just the start of a new
wave of attacks by Algerian Muslim militants.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Doctors announce plan to cut Highland suicide rate</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975798522</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DOCTORS yesterday announced a plan to reduce the suicide rate in the
Highlands, which is the highest in the UK.
The suicide rate in the Highlands is twice that of England and is the
fourth greatest contributor to premature death.
Doctors attending a seminar in Inverness yesterday warned that the
rate was an indicator of the state of mental health in the country. More
than 100 attended the talks where they heard that higher standards of
health care for people with a mental illness would be required to reduce
the levels of suicide.
Their proposals include educating health staff, tightening the
prescribing of anti-depressant drugs, and working with voluntary
agencies.
Suicide claims approximately 40 people a year in the Highlands, with
75% of these being men between 35 and 44. Only cancer, heart disease,
and accidents cause more deaths and the suicide rate is 50% higher than
the rest of Scotland.
Mr John Robertson, chairman of Highland Health Board, said suicides
were linked to social habits and mental health and he said excessive
drinking was a major factor.
Delegates heard that about 60% of suicide victims made contact with
their GP in the month before their death. However, some of the drugs
prescribed in a bid to combat depression might contribute to suicides.
The seminar called for a reduction in the prescribing of Prozac,
Co-proxomol, and older anti-depressants.
Dr Ken Oates, of Highland Health Board, said: ''Historically in this
area this is a drug that has been issued by GPs. It is a very effective
painkiller and, when used properly, it is very safe. But there is no
doubt there is a group of patients for whom, if they are depressed and
are at risk of suicides, the drug is inappropriate.''
Mr Robertson highlighted a new education programme for primary care
staff on the subjects of depression and suicide to help early detection
and provide effective treatment.
He added that 40% of Highland suicide cases were found to have been
drinking before taking their life, with 29% known to have had a serious
alcohol problem.
Mr Robertson said rural deprivation and unemployment were contributing
factors.
The farming industry was also highlighted as a high-risk job, with 8%
of deaths related to the agricultural community.
Scotland's chief medical officer, Dr Robert Kendell, was concerned
about the alarming rise in male suicides, adding that there had been a
slow, steady reduction in female suicides, not in just the Highlands but
in Western Europe.
He added: ''In contrast, there has been a very alarming rise in male
suicides, involving men under 45. We therefore have a new phenomenon
which is getting steadily worse.''
He said the young men were predominantly poorly educated and lacking
in skills. ''Twenty years ago, these men had a guaranteed job as a
labourer or something that required just strength as a skill. There has
been a major change since then and these jobs have all but gone.''

INLAND Revenue ''ghostbusters'' raked in more than #6000m in unpaid
tax last year as a result of their investigations, according to figures
released yesterday.
The total for 1994/5, up #1600m on the previous year, included #1600m
from catching ''ghosts'' -- people not in the tax system -- and
moonlighters with an undeclared second income.
Total tax receipts were #87,300m, up 12.5% on the previous year.
Figures showed 82% of self-employed taxpayers had received the correct
tax assessment first time, while the figure for Pay As You Earn payers
was 92.3%.
While these figures were both above internal targets, said a
spokesman, the Inland Revenue was determined to improve them.
Commenting on a claim that three million people had been given the
wrong tax code, the Revenue said not all the errors were the fault of
the service and did not mean the victims were necessarily paying too
much tax.
It described a claim that these people had overpaid tax by #850m as
''grossly exaggerated''.

FRIENDS of the actor Eric Cullen yesterday urged the Lord Advocate to
bring prosecutions against two men who, they alleged, had been involved
in serious child abuse.
Journalists Bill McFarlan and Dorothy Grace Elder told a news
conference they had enlisted two former police officers to prepare a
dossier detailing offences committed by the pair, including abuse of the
actor.
They are sending their report to Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, asking him
to institute criminal proceedings against the men and to consider using
a police force other than Strathclyde to investigate.
Mr McFarlan said he believed Strathclyde officers involved in Cullen's
case had been compromised by their decision to give the media ''a
steer'' before the actor was convicted on indecency charges.
Cullen has since had his nine-month prison sentence quashed by the
Court of Appeal and has been given to three-years probation.
Mr McFarlan said the actor was now prepared to testify in court
against both alleged offenders. One is in his 60s, the other in his 40s;
one lives in Glasgow, and the other in Lanarkshire.
He said two other people were also prepared to act as witnesses
against one of the men and he believed the case against the other was
strong enough to merit prosecution.
Mr McFarlan and Ms Elder said no other details could be given, in case
it prejudiced any future trial. They also defended their campaign to
have the men prosecuted.
Mr McFarlan said: ''I believe the vast majority of Strathclyde Police
are doing their best in difficult circumstances. But I don't think that
children should be compromised because mistakes were made by the police
at an early stage.
''We are on the same side as the police but our concern now is to get
the guys in our dossier behind bars.''
Mr McFarlan added: ''I'm disillusioned by the actions of certain
officers but I would still go to a policeman tomorrow if necessary.''
Ms Elder said as many as 50,000 people in the UK may be guilty of
child abuse.
''The problem with abuse is that people bury it because of the shame.
However, this Lord Advocate has indicated that child abuse is a
priority. He sat through Eric's appeal hearing and spoke to his lawyer
later.
''We trust our file will give him the opportunity to bring the
suffering of children to an end, by calling in another force to
investigate and prosecute the abusers.''
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Police said yesterday: ''We note that
information has been passed to the Crown Office and we will await
developments.''

<RECORDNO>975798525</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SIAMESE twins Chloe and Nicole Astbury died from a rare infection
early yesterday only days after doctors discussed allowing them home
from hospital in time for Christmas.
The five-week-old baby girls died within five minutes of each other in
St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, from a bowel disease which their surgeon
said they had been ''extremely unlucky'' to develop.
The twins were recovering well from a life-saving operation to
separate their bowel and surgeons thought it was possible to eventually
carry out an operation to separate them to lead normal lives.
However, first Nicole and then Chloe contracted a condition known as
neo-natal necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) which affected their heart,
lungs, and breathing systems.
As devastated parents Brian and Melanie Astbury were being comforted
by their families, consultant paediatrician Mr Alan Dickson told how he
broke the news to them that the twins were dying.
He telephoned the couple, who also have a three-year-old son Nathan,
at their home in Denton, Manchester, at 12.45am and asked them to come
to the city centre hospital.
''When they arrived, I spoke to them in the privacy of a quiet room,
advising them we could do no more for these children and they were going
to die,'' said Mr Dickson.
''We asked them if they wanted to come and spend some time with the
babies then but they were unable to do so, such was their distress.''
The couple held the girls, who were joined by the abdomen, for a short
time after they died around 1.40am.
The NEC condition has a 25% mortality rate among babies who contract
it. Out of 250 poorly babies admitted to St Mary's each year only five
to 10 develop the disease.
Mr Dickson said Chloe and Nicole, who were born on September 14, had
suffered three strokes of bad luck in their short lives.
''It is very bad luck to be a conjoined twin in the first place,'' he
said. ''Our information from the scans was very encouraging but they
then had an operation revealing congenital problems with the gut beyond
what we could have expected.
''To come through what they came through in the first 11 days of life
only to be hit by this out of the blue is extremely bad luck.''
The condition -- which despite its name is not connected with
necrotising fasciitis, the so-called flesh-eating disease -- affects
infants who undergo stress in the early days of their lives.
Mr Dickson told a news conference at the hospital that the twins had
been ''going downhill'' on Monday and Tuesday and deteriorated further
on Wednesday.
They had been placed on ventilators, but died early yesterday morning.
''The disappointment for everyone is that these children seemed to
have got past the period of most stress and seemed to have recovered
when the condition hit them,'' the doctor said.
The parent's solicitor Ms Andrea McWatt said Mr Astbury, a 26-year-old
electrician, and his 25-year-old wife were ''devastated''.
Only two days earlier they had spoken of their hopes for the future
and their conviction that their decision not to terminate the pregnancy
was the right one.
Mr Astbury said: ''We discussed termination but we knew the girls had
all their major organs and limbs and felt it wasn't for us in this
case.''
He said: ''We didn't want to feel years down the line that we didn't
make the right decision. We wanted to give it a try.''
However, Mr and Mrs Astbury revealed earlier this week that they had
received hate mail because of their decision not to terminate the
pregnancy. They said they had thrown the letters from ''sickos'' out.
The last British Siamese twins, two girls born in Bristol in 1986 to
Pat and Andrew Parrett, shared a heart and died three-and-a-half days
after their birth.

SPECIAL Constable 2705 arrived for his first day with the Devon and
Cornwall police force yesterday, behind the wheel of his #100,000
top-of-the-range Mercedes.
Then he climbed out of the dark blue V12 S600, number plate 8NM, into
a #10,000, diesel 1800cc force Panda car -- which he will not drive
until he has passed a police driving test.
Former Grand Prix ace Nigel Mansell will attend a one-day lecture on
road safety, then take a road test with a police driving instructor.
Even then, the 42-year-old Formula One and Indycar champion, sworn in
with eight men and four women volunteers, must travel in the passenger
seat for a year.
''It is the same test everyone has to go through and I am looking
forward to it,'' said Mansell, who has served with the Isle of Man
special constabulary for eight years.
Yesterday, he was again wearing his uniform with the number 2705,
which incorporates his racing numbers 27 and 5. He completed his first
official piece of paperwork when he signed the Panda car's mileage book.
Mansell -- who survived one of the fastest ever car crashes when his
Williams F1 burst a tyre at 215 mph and smashed into a barrier at the
Paul Ricard circuit, near Marseilles, in 1985 -- swelled the ranks of
the force's 1100 specials, who were warned by Chief Constable John
Evans: ''It will sometimes be dangerous.''
He said he signed up as a special ''to put something back into
society''. He added: ''I think if we can give the children of today a
little bit of a role model from the point of view of drinking and
driving, safe driving, and the use of seat belts and no drugs, it might
go some way towards helping a number of people in the future.''
Mansell will tackle everything from co-ordinating neighbourhood watch
schemes to working with regular officers on drugs raids.

A MAN who burnt down his wife's house after discovering she had a
lover yesterday had his jail sentence cut.
Peter Pollock, 45, a social worker, had transferred the matrimonial
home in Cumnock, in Ayrshire, to his wife.
It was empty when he set fire it, causing damage of about #30,000.
Pollock, of Main Street, Auchinleck, was jailed for 18 months at Ayr
Sheriff Court for wilful fire-raising.
The Court of Appeal yesterday reduced the jail term to one-year
because of the exceptional circumstances of the case.
Lord Allanbridge, who heard the appeal with Lord Weir and Lord
Mayfield, heard that Pollock, a first offender, was a former senior care
officer in a children's home and was respected in his community.
The judges decided that although a custodial sentence was merited for
the crime, they could reduce the jail term by six months as the offence
was clearly out of character for Pollock.

A SERIOUSLY ill Bosnian teenage girl arrived in Glasgow yesterday for
urgent hospital treatment.
Jadranka Zelinovic, 15, arrived at the Royal Hospital for Sick
Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow, from Oxford, where she had spent the
night after flying from Sarajevo on Wednesday.
Looking tired and pale Jadranka was met by consultant paediatric
surgeon Mr Graham Haddock. He will oversee her treatment for ulcerative
chronic colitis, a severe inflamation of the bowel and bleeding.
1 She was accompanied by her mother, Slavica, and brother Maiden,
eight, who will stay with her at the hospital.
After X-rays and a biopsy of the colon, doctors will decide whether to
operate.
The condition causes her to lose blood and be lacking in protein.
Sufferers are left weakened and their bodies are unable to extract fully
the nutrients provided by their food.
Jadranka was brought to the UK as hospitals in Bosnia were unable to
treat her.
Mr Haddock said: ''The anxiety is that Jadranka is getting to the
stage where standard medical treatment is not working and she might
require surgery.
''Hospitals in Sarajevo cannot cope with the complications which might
arise in her case and have had problems in maintaining her nutritional
state. That is the first thing we must address.
''The condition can become life threatening, but thankfully that is
relatively rare.''
Jadranka is the third Bosnian evacuee to receive treatment at the
Glasgow hospital.

Bonn
TENNIS star Steffi Graf, who is under investigation for tax evasion,
has put her tax affairs into the hands of high-profile US consultants
Price Waterhouse, the firm said today.
Graf, who lost a #630,000-a-year sponsorship contract with the Opel
car firm this week because of concern about the management of her
finances, asked the accountants to deal with her affairs last month.
''Her request includes giving advice in tax matters including
representation before the tax authorities,'' a Price Waterhouse
statement said.
The 26-year-old multi-millionaire says her financial affairs have been
run by her father Peter and advisers since an early part of her career.
Graf says she has little knowledge of the details.
Peter Graf was jailed in August to stop him fleeing or concealing
evidence that might support allegations that he and his daughter dodged
millions of pounds in taxes.--Reuter.

THE number of killings in Scotland involving knives is on the rise
again, reversing the success of Strathclyde's Operation Blade which
reduced knife-related incidents in 1993 from the peak reached the year
before.
Stabbing was the most common method of killing in Scotland last year,
accounting for more than half of all homicides, according to Scottish
Office figures released yesterday.
They show that 58 people -- more than half of all murder and homicide
victims in 1994 -- died from stabbing attacks compared with 44 in 1993.
The rise was described as ''particularly disappointing'' by Scottish
Home Affairs Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
Recalling the success of Operation Blade, which reduced knife-related
incidents in Scotland by 37%, Lord James said: ''Considering the recent
increase in 1994, more work is still needed in this area of crime
prevention.''
He stressed: ''Those concerned must understand that the unlawful
carrying of knives or other offensive weapons will not be tolerated.''
He welcomed a drop in the total number of homicide victims -- from 117
in 1993 to 111.
However, he was concerned about increases in the homicide rates among
males aged 16 to 20 and 26 to 30, which he said were higher last year
than ever before.
''This is a senseless waste of young lives and has no place in any
civilised society,'' he said.
The statistics show that 71 of Scotland's homicide victims last year
were from Strathclyde -- 35 of them from Glasgow.
* SENIOR Scottish police officers will hold meetings across the
country next week to discuss crime following the publication of a survey
yesterday which reveals an unprecedented fear of crime in Scotland.
The poll carried out by Gallup sponsored by General Accident as part
of a nationwide initiative showed that 94% of those surveyed were
personally concerned about crime levels, with 58% afraid of being
burgled, while 47% feared being mugged.
No fewer than 600 neighbourhood watch co-ordinators, representing
thousands of Scottish households, will be involved in the series of
conferences backed by the police.
Among subjects they will discuss will be the growing problem of youth
crime which costs the country an estimated #700m annually.
Mr Ray Andrews, the insurance company's head of communications, said:
''After the excellent response of last year's meetings, which focused on
communicating change, we have decided to go straight to the heart of the
matter.''
The meetings will start in Edinburgh on Tuesday and finish in Glasgow
on Friday. The accent will be on how young people can be involved
successfully in local crime-prevention initiatives.
Gallup interviewed a national sample of 2034 adults aged over 16
during March and April this year.

Singapore
AN escaped British convict attended a symphony concert and went on a
shopping spree after committing a grisly murder suspected to be part of
an international trail of crime, Singapore prosecutors said today.
The contention was aimed at disputing John Martin Scripps' claim that
he was dazed, confused and in a state of self-enforced drunkenness most
of the time after what he called an accidental killing on March 8.
''I am putting it to you that you are lying . . . when you say you
were walking in a dream world. You were clear in your mind what you were
doing,'' prosecutor Jennifer Marie told Scripps on the fourth day of
intense cross-examination.
The questioning was due to end tomorrow, and a verdict is likely next
week.
Scripps, 35, admits killing the victim, Gerard Lowe, a South African
tourist, with whom he was sharing a hotel room.
But he says it was to defend himself from a homosexual attack by Lowe,
whose dismembered body parts were subsequently found in Singapore
harbour.
If the court accepts this version, Scripps could hope for a
manslaughter conviction, which carries a maximum punishment of life
imprisonment. But a murder conviction would send him to the gallows.
Scripps claims that a British friend, staying in another Singapore
hotel, could have chopped up the body and thrown it in the river.
He has refused to name the friend or give details, saying the mystery
man is a dangerous drug trafficker who would harm his family in England.
Prosecutor Marie accused Scripps of making up the story.
The motive for the killing was robbery, she said, as Scripps has
admitted to using Lowe's credit cards by tampering with and forging his
signature.
Using the card, he withdrew #4000 and also bought a video recorder, a
pair of hi-fi speakers, shoes, socks and a top-priced #15 ticket to the
Singapore Symphony Orchestra programme featuring Ravel, Brahms and
Tchaikovsky on March 10.
Scripps says he withdrew the money to pay off his friend and that he
does not remember buying the symphony ticket, which was found in his
bags along with a voucher signed by him. He denied attending the
concert.
Scripps was arrested on March 19 when he returned from Thailand, where
he is also charged with the murders of a 49-year-old Canadian
schoolteacher and her 23-year-old son. Their bodies also were found
chopped up.
He also has been linked to the murder of a British tourist in Cancun,
Mexico, where he set up home after escaping from British custody during
a weekend home leave in October 1994.
Scripps, who dropped out of school as a teenager, has been in trouble
with the law since the age of 15, initially over petty burglary.
When he escaped, he was serving a 13-year sentence for drug
trafficking.--AP.

ULSTER party leaders are scheduled for talks with President Clinton in
Washington within a fortnight as the drive continues to get the peace
process re-established.
The new Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble hopes to meet the
President on October 31, and SDLP leader John Hume will see Mr Clinton
in the same week.
Mr Hume, who is vital to persuading Sinn Fein and the IRA to move on
the decommissioning of weapons, yesterday spent 45 minutes with the
Prime Minister in his room at the Commons. He emerged with his colleague
Seamus Mallon in optimistic mood.
Mr Trimble was more cautious after his talks yesterday with Northern
Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew.
However, it appears that provided that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, can accept an independent international commission to study
the handing-over of weapons, the Ulster Unionists will not block a
twin-track approach to all-party talks.
London, Dublin, and Washington are all pressing for this and it is now
up to Mr Adams to persuade the IRA that it too should fall into line. A
statement from him is imminent.
All sides are slightly concerned that Mr Adams has been off the
television screens for the past three weeks, indicating that he is
having a tough time convincing his party that now is the time for a
concession.
There are fears that the Provisional IRA is still holding out against
such a move.
Nevertheless, the mood yesterday was optimistic that the log-jam in
the peace process can be broken fairly soon.
President Clinton's arrival here next month is adding additional
pressure to finding a solution. His national security adviser Anthony
Lake has had private meetings with the Ulster party leaders over the
past few days and is now trying to arrange for Mr Trimble and Mr Hume to
speak to the President personally.

Pretoria
SOUTH African police said today they shot and arrested the prime
suspect in the serial killings of at least 40 women, some of whom were
lured to their deaths by letters and telephone calls.
Moses Sithole, 31, who police say may have used his onetime job as a
youth counsellor to ensnare women whom he raped and strangled with their
underwear, was wounded when he was cornered in a rain-soaked alley in a
slum district of Johannesburg last night, police said.
Sithole attacked two undercover investigators, who had received
information that he was going to see a relative to obtain a gun, with a
hand-axe, police said.
They fired two warning shots and then shot him first in the foot and
then in the stomach when he did not stop, Police Commissioner George
Fivaz said at a news conference. He said one of the policemen was
slightly slashed on the hand.
Fivaz said Sithole was in satisfactory condition in hospital and said
after the news conference that the use of force was ''understandable
when we are dealing with an abnormal person''.
''This was a person who has been sought for many weeks for the
killings of many persons and up to now we can't determine how he may
react,'' Fivaz added, defending police who were widely criticised for
having shot dead a previous suspect in the case.
Police last week named Sithole, believed also to be an ex-convict, as
their prime suspect in the killing of at least 40 women and one boy in
three areas near Johannesburg and Pretoria.
They published his picture, a list of his six known aliases and
appealed to people not to exact mob justice if he was found.
The serial killings are part of a crime wave that is rocking South
Africa, striking fear into many ordinary citizens.
The bodies of the black women victims were found near railway
stations, in open fields and in mine dumps. Some were badly decomposed.
Fivaz confirmed press reports that the suspect had used his position
as a counsellor to entrap his victims.
''He worked as a youth counsellor . . . and used that as an avenue for
approaching people,'' Fivaz said. ''He had a very, very acceptable type
of psychological mindset when he approached people.''
Fivaz said Sithole had contacted his victims ''by sending letters and
there are also indications he made phone calls to various women''.
The commissioner did not rule out links between Sithole and the
previous suspect, David Selepe, who was killed by police who claimed he
had attacked them, while he was handcuffed, when they took him to visit
the site where one of the bodies was found.
''All indications are that he worked as a loner over the last couple
of months . . . (but) there are indications that he could be linked with
David Selepe,'' Fivaz said.
He said the suspect's identity had been determined by ''information
coming from all sectors of the community'' and added that ''there are
indications he bragged about his history''.
Sithole may well have been the man who called two Johannesburg
newspapers claiming to be the serial killer. In one of the calls the man
claimed to have killed up to 76 people.
Fivaz said precautions would be taken to ensure Sithole's safety and
said he would stand trial as soon as possible.
President Nelson Mandela had conveyed his congratulations to the
detective team for their work, Fivaz said.
A woman teacher working in a school near the area where Sithole was
captured said people were relieved.
''They should give him a punishment he'll never forget,'' said Mrs A D
Sithole, no relation to the suspect. ''It's been painful, especially for
us women.''--Reuter.

IT is not easy to buy cosmetics which have not been tested on animals,
as SSPCA campaign manager Pauline Mullen and I found out. Sales
assistants for the big cosmetic houses are not well-informed on the
issue of animal-testing. On our shopping trip, they couldn't say whether
the products they represented were cruelty-free or not. Some lied,
because official research does not support their answers.
A saleswoman may say a finished product is not animal-tested, but all
that means is that the final pot-pourri has not been applied to a
laboratory specimen. What the company miss out purposely is key
information regarding ingredients. The product may be a concoction of
animal-tested contributions and is therefore not cruelty-free at all.
Under the 1976 European Cosmetic Directive, all new ingredients and
formulas must be animal-tested. Between 1992 and 1993, the number of
animals used in the testing of cosmetic ingredients rose 77% in Britain,
from 2164 to 3741. In France, more than 22,000 animals were killed; 14
million animals worldwide die annually in tests to determine the alleged
safety of cosmetic and household products; 67% of tests are done without
anaesthetic.
In America, product manufacturers are reluctant to stop animal tests
or use cruelty-free ingredients because of the need to protect
themselves from litigation. If a person is harmed by the use of a
cosmetic, the company responsible for its manufacture can say it was
tested in every way. If a company and its suppliers become cruelty-free,
they become more vulnerable to litigation. This is important.
The new consumer climate in cosmetics is such that every whim or
vanity is catered for, but pioneering cosmetic ingredients have the
power to damage as well as improve.
According to a recent report, cosmetic companies are facing a barrage
of lawsuits from women claiming that some products have caused skin
damage. One woman received a #75,000 out-of-court settlement by Clinique
after claiming to have developed a disfiguring skin allergy through
using a cream.
The claim against Clinique related to facial swelling and blistering.
The cream was marketed as ''allergy-tested''. If Clinique, who claim to
be experts on sensitive skin, are being taken to court, what about the
products of companies with less specific claims. Are they safe?
If companies do not want to abandon animal-testing because it is their
safety net, rather than safety procedure, then they are not confident of
the overall safety of their products. Genuinely cruelty-free cosmetics
are safe cosmetics because traditional ingredients are used.
Animal-testing is a convenience, a procedure in lieu of potential
court action. Furthermore, it is impossible to gauge the suitability of
new ingredients because their virginity means they have no history.
All that can be gleaned from testing a cosmetic ingredient on an
animal is whether a rabbit provided a violent reaction to the substance.
Even if you don't care about whether animals suffer or not, to make a
stand against animal-testing ensures the safety of what is commercially
available to you. Stand up for animals and you stand up for yourself.
If animals were no longer used to simulate a human reaction to a
cosmetic, the alternative ingredients would have to be of good quality,
and the marketing of a product would not begin until it was 100%, not
99%, safe. To ensure that what you buy is cruelty-free, however, you
must be prepared to ask questions. The labelling of products is not yet
sufficient.
Mullen and I discovered that many saleswomen seemed to believe, quite
wrongly, that natural products were automatically cruelty-free.
''The product has natural ingredients'' was consistently issued as a
panacea.
The Almay assistant in Boots, told us her company preferred synthetic
rather than genuine ingredients because the natural are more likely to
produce irritation. Vegetarian-approved Beauty Without Cruelty, agree:
''Some of the most dangerous substances known to mankind are 'natural',
a new natural ingredient is as much subject to regulatory control as any
new synthetic substance.''
The Estee Lauder saleswoman, in Frasers, Edinburgh, insisted that
Estee Lauder categorically did not test its products on animals, and
produced the sweeping statement: ''All the companies don't test on
animals now.'' But firmness of delivery is no substitute for the truth.
Estee Lauder ''do not use animals in the testing of their products nor
do they have animal testing conducted on their behalf by anyone else''
said a written statement.
Their press office, however, could not confirm whether regular checks
were made on the methods employed by their suppliers, or whether Estee
Lauder, who promote ground-breaking combination formulas for the skin,
do or do not comply with the 1976 European Cosmetic Directive that all
new ingredients have to be animal-tested.
The Lancome assistant in Boots, Edinburgh, was deluded. She said that
animal testing might take place in America or Europe but wouldn't be
allowed in Britain. She also said that Lancome had been cruelty-free for
the past two years.
Lancome operate under the umbrella of L'Oreal, who provided The Herald
with a copy of their safety policy. It said: ''Tests on animals are no
longer used on L'Oreal's complete range of finished cosmetic, toiletry
and perfumery products.'' (Note use of the qualifier ''finished''.)
The statement went on: ''With regard to ingredients, these are subject
to specific legislation, which prescribes, very rigorously, the tests
that are necessary to guarantee the safety in use of new ingredients.
All companies, with no exception, can therefore only use ingredients
which have undergone, at one time or other, the compulsory safety
tests.''
If L'Oreal mean that any one product cannot be cruelty-free, because
all ingredients must be animal-tested according to the 1976 Directive,
then they are no exception. They cannot say credibly, therefore, that
they do not test on animals.
But if they are peddling the idea that all the ingredients in the
world have been animal-tested in their time, that is not true; merely a
means of undermining the whole case for cruelty-free cosmetics.
Traditional ingredients listed in the 1976 Directive are documented as
safe, and are no longer animal-tested. But even so, what about seaweed
and fruit acids and proteins before they were spin-doctored in the lab?
Did Cleopatra inject milk into rats? Did Samoan girls apply pineapple
to a pig's belly before they rubbed it on their faces? Before the
civilisation of lab culture, women used tried and human-tested means of
beauty.
Boots employ well-paid human volunteers to test products. ''We are not
cruel to animals,'' whispered the Boots No. 7 saleswoman, ''but by God
are we cruel to humans.''
In a written statement, Boots' own brand says: ''We audit and select
suppliers who are aware of our policy on animal-testing.''
The Body Shop too, keep a check on suppliers and have even withdrawn
products because an ingredient was reported to have been animal-tested
within their cut-off date of five years.
All in all, two cosmetic counters out of six gave the correct
information as to whether the products they were selling were indeed
cruelty-free. A girl who used to be a ''filler'' assistant on many of
the big-house cosmetic company counters explained to The Herald that
beauty assistants receive a basic salary and work on a commission basis.
''I was shocked by the shallowness of the response,'' said Mullen,
during the post-mortem. ''There was no effort to state company policy,
which was surprising. If animal-testing is such an important part of
buying, why don't employees have a clearer knowledge?
''Were people to believe that they could trust the label, they could
choose to boycott animal-tested products. If they lose confidence we
lose consumer power. Consumer power is the best weapon we've got to
persuade manufacturers to stop using animal-tested ingredients.''
There is talk of a new European directive, an addendum to the 1976
Act, which may ask companies to stipulate whether their products are
cruelty-free. That is, labelling should specify whether the ingredients
of a product are cruelty-free, or whether the finished product only has
not been animal-tested. This labelling would bring the issue of
animal-testing to the fore.
It is clear, however, that no-one can cruise along on the cosy
assumption that companies do not test on animals any more.
* THE SSPCA is launching a campaign to enable its members to identify
alternatives and to boycott animal-tested products. The campaign aims to
heighten public awareness of cosmetic cruelty. Call 0131-339 0222 for

* AS THE clocks go back this weekend, millions of pounds are about to
be wasted through burning ordinary light bulbs during the winter months.
An energy-saving bulb can save #10 a year -- #50 over its lifetime --
but 96% of Scots in a Gallup poll said they were in the dark about the
benefits of switching over.
In a bid to change our bulb-buying habits, a third is being lopped off
prices of the economy version, with shops displaying a Billy the
Dinosaur symbol offering it for #10, or less.
But hurry -- there are only 1.25 million to be shared out among some
25 million UK households! It's estimated that if every home in Britain
substituted one energy-saving bulb -- each lasts 10,000 hours -- for an
ordinary one, #180m a year would be sliced off the nation's lighting
bill.
Since that might also eat into power company margins, will unit prices
have to be jacked up to compensate shareholders for the loss?
Long-life bulbs with the special #5 discount are available from Asda,
B&amp;Q, BHS, Woolworths, and many other retailers. For details of the
Government's Home Energy Efficiency Scheme -- and to find out if you
qualify for a free energy-saving bulb -- call 0800 181667.
* HOMEOWNERS in Scotland can save 15% on cavity wall insulation
through a special October deal from approved installers.
The full cost of the work can be recouped in energy savings within
four years. After that, a 25% reduction in heating bills will not only
benefit the family budget but make a house more attractive to future
purchasers. Another bonus: condensation is reduced.
Installation is carried out by members of the National Cavity
Insulation Association, who inject a suitable material between the inner
and outer leaves that form the external wall. Together with captive air,
a permanent barrier to heat loss is created.
Full details from NCIA, PO Box 12, Haslemere, Surrey GU27 3AH, Tel:
01428 654011.
* DON'T be fooled by the recent mild spell -- winter coughs and colds
could be just round the corner. Now's the time to get the home medicine
chest on a germ warfare footing -- and Boots have produced a healthcare
booklet listing the bare essentials.
The checklist includes obvious items like decongestants, analgesics
and throat lozenges. But have you examined your hot water bottle lately,
is a thermometer handy, and have you an emollient cream to prevent dry
skin, a side effect of winter illness?
Carefully examine medicines that are already in the cabinet -- they
may not only be ineffective after the expiry date (on the label or box)
but actually unsafe to use.
Boots' Winter Healthcare with advice about children suffering from
colds and 'flu, keeping warm and staging a quick recovery is free at
branches throughout Scotland.
* IF you are installing a new gas fire this winter it could pay to
check out the latest range from Valor. Their coal-effect Adorn and
Visage models incorporate a special device that cuts off the gas supply
if room oxygen levels become too low.
Atmospheric sensing responds to concern about deaths from
carbon-monoxide poisoning, often caused by a blocked flue or poor
servicing.
The fuel-efficient fires costs just 10p an hour to run on their
highest 3.5kw setting, and 4p on low. They also feature a convenient
slide control that makes adjusting easier for people who find kneeling
or bending difficult.
For details, write to Valor Heating, Wood Lane, Birmingham B24 9QP,
Tel: 0121-373 8111.
* WINTER warmers: Sainsbury's have claimed the first microwavable
pizzas. Their 4[1/2]-minute Pizza To-Go comes in a special airflow
container to guarantee a crispy base. Priced from #1.85 to #2.59,
toppings include cheese and tomato, bacon and mushroom, and chicken
supreme . . . Roast, ground, and freeze-dried coffees that perk up
small-scale farmers in developing countries as well as consumers are now
at leading supermarkets in the Glasgow area. Cafe direct brand, backed
by Oxfam, is made from arabica high-altitude beans for quality and
flavour . . . Melt-in-the-mouth range of soft Madeira cakes from
McVitie's comes in lemon, orange, coconut, and banana, price 75p.

ON Sunday Dundee environmental health officers will fly out to County
Tartu in Estonia to teach ''best practice'' to the food industry, writes
JOAN GRADY.
In a joint venture with Storstroms County in Denmark and Limerick in
Ireland, Dundee District Council has won more than #40,000 of European
funding to train the public and private sector in the management of food
and food waste.
The project was developed through the European Commission's Ouverture
initiative, which is a programme to encourage inter-regional
co-operation.
''It is designed to produce co-operation between the main parts of
Europe and the central and eastern parts in the Mediterranean and
Russia,'' says Liam Meehan at the Strathclyde Ouverture Office in
Glasgow.
Dundee District Council contacted the Ouverture offices with the idea
for ''The Baltic Health Chain'' and asked if there were any other
interested parties. After examining their extensive database, Ouverture
was able to link Dundee with their partners in Ireland and Denmark.
''There has never been a project based on environmental health so we
put forward a proposal to exchange best practice,'' says Ron Gabriel,
Dundee's chief environmental health officer.
''The funding will be used to bring together the public and private
sector to run a programme which will assist Estonia in the areas of
monitoring control and education.
''We have put together a first-class team and I am sure this
partnership can give a lead to other authorities not just in Scotland
but throughout Europe.
''The district council hopes to gain a good exchange of best practice,
but also hopes to be more givers than receivers.''

It's quite a learning experience for everyone as Scottish law firms
play host to lawyers from Russia, reports Joan Grady
GLASNOST, perestroika, the collapse of communism, the arrival of
McDonalds -- the people of the former Soviet Union became have had much
to deal with in recent years. But their greatest challenge has been
adapting from a centrally-planned, state-managed economy to market-based
capitalism.
Among those most closely involved with the change are lawyers who must
help form limited liability companies, advise on raising finance, handle
the buying and selling of commercial property and write and negotiate
the contracts between firms: in short, the nuts and bolts of capitalism.
Five Russian lawyers have arrived in Scotland to spend three months
with practices in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Alexander Vinogradoff, Oleg
Mishoukov and Sergei Yeremeev are in Glasgow.
There are benefits to both them and their host firms. ''Having
Alexander in Glasgow provides us with a valuable insight into how
business and commerce operate in Russia,'' says Louise Coultas at
McGrigor Donald, one of the three Glasgow firms. ''And it provides him
with first-hand experience of how the law and legal firms are managed
here.''
The project was set up as part of the European Commission's TACIS
(Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States)
programme. TACIS approached the Law Societies of Scotland and of England
and Wales to find hosts for 22 Russian lawyers chosen for the trip to
the UK.
''It was the first of its kind trying to teach Eastern European firms
how to manage and attract clients and ethical procedures,'' says Harriet
Smith of the Law Society for England and Wales. ''I don't think they'd
learned much in the way of ethics.''
The project does not rely on any specific teaching methods -- the
visitors learn through integration and observation.''There are no formal
classes,'' says Sergei Yeremeev, a solicitor with his own Moscow firm
who is a guest of Glasgow solicitors Boyds. ''In work we are in contact
with other people and we can discuss problems with our hosts. We look at
how they deal with cases -- it's real life.''
Yeremeev and his fellow countrymen hope to build business contacts
here, and to develop relationships between the countries. ''I hope to be
helpful to British businesses, and to help Russia do business in British
ways,'' says Mishoukov, a member of a Moscow commercial law firm.
''So far there are not many British business in Russia but I hope that
will change in future. And when I go back I want to increase the
interest of Russian businesses in Scotland.''
Maclay Murray &amp; Spens have an ongoing programme of hosting
international visits -- they say it broadens their horizons. ''It's a
broadening of education, seeing what makes other countries tick,'' says
the firm's Kenneth Shand. ''It can also be useful to those of our
clients who might have interests in the country in question.
''With remote areas like Eastern Europe you feel you're doing your
best to assist the development of a new system and to form a medium to
long-term investment in that relationship.''
Tony McInnes at Boyds agrees. He sees a possibility of new
international clients arising from Yeremeev's visit, either through his
own firm or through clients who have interests in Scotland.
''There will be an advantage to Boyds when Sergei returns to Moscow,''
he says. ''If he then wants to do business in Scotland we would hope to
be of some assistance to him. We would also like to think that if any of
his clients had Scottish interests he would refer them to us.''
While Yeremeev, Mishoukov and Vinogradoff are here they are
experiencing the practice of law in a way very new to them. They think
this will help them when they return home.
''Personally I believe I'll get experience of organisation,'' says
Vinogradoff. ''My firm is a small partnership with three partners, one
secretary and an assistant. I hope the experience I get here will help
me organise the work of my firm.''
In Edinburgh Karina Sborshikova is working with Bell &amp; Scott and
Margarita Petrova is with Morton Fraser Milligan. Sborshikova is from
Perm, an industrial city about 90 miles from Moscow.
She works at a legal advice centre there but intends to open her own
law firm. ''A big benefit to law firms here is the idea of
partnership,'' she says. ''I would like to establish such a
partnership.''
Petrova has had her own firm in Moscow for a year but wants to learn
more about managing it. ''Law firms are very new in our country,'' she
says. ''We don't have the chance to learn effective management because
it is the private secret of each firm.
''Around 50-60% of the clients are foreigners who want to establish a
business in Moscow. They need further legal support in banking,
financing, arbitration, litigation and property transactions.
''Many foreigners do not know how to open businesses in Moscow. They
do not orientate themselves to our law. There are a lot of new laws and
there are special Russian conditions.''
The visitors are keen to learn more about Scottish culture, and it
didn't take long to get into the swing of things. The first thing
Vinogradoff did on arriving was buy a set of golf clubs, while Yeremeev
and Mishoukov explored Glasgow's West End.
''They seemed to settle in nicely,'' says Harriet Smith. ''Within a
week they had found Byres Road and all the best pubs and restaurants
that go with it.''

IT was mid-Victorian melodrama. The principal actors overacted, one
badly, one well. An extra tried to become a star and failed. And it was
all played out against a splendid background of boos, jeers, catcalls
and synthetic laughter.
In the best barnstorming style, the character who first appeared as
the hunted villain ended as the long-lost heir and, having been greeted
with hisses, eventually walked off to loud huzzas.
Act One was, or should have been, Howard On The Run. The Home
Secretary stood accused of exceeding his powers, telling the Commons he
hadn't exceeded them and browbeaten the former Director-General of
Prisons, Mr Derek Lewis, into instantly sacking the governor of
Parkhurst Prison from which some inmates had escaped while others,
judging by an independent report, were having such a good time that they
probably didn't want to.
The production allowed for audience participation and those sitting in
the right-hand wings proved much more adept than those sitting opposite.
They were helped by an inadequate performance by Mr Jack Straw, who soon
began to resemble Hamilton Burger, the DA you knew was always going to
be flattened by Perry Mason.
Asked if he thought Mr Lewis should have been sacked, Mr Straw
declined to answer, something which he kept stridently accusing Mr
Howard of refusing to do even after he had. Our Home Secretary in
waiting, one felt, should have had a view.
His problem was that he was basically arguing about a technicality.
Few can think the Parkhurst governor should have kept his job. Few can
doubt that Mr Lewis's own future could not have been bright after the
crushing criticism of the service he was running.
However, Mr Straw insisted that the Home Secretary put pressure on the
director-general to sack the governor. The Tories were in a ''so what?''
mood about this, feeling that, even if Hamilton Straw made the case, the
public as jury would probably see Mr Howard's anger, concern and action
to be what they would expect of a Home Secretary in those circumstances.
Argued out in a court of law, where emotions are kept on a tight rein
and where Mr Lewis would replace Mr Straw as the chief prosecuting
agent, the outcome might be different.
Mr Straw waved a minute of a meeting on the governor's future which he
said made clear that it was Mr Howard who had called for the Governor's
instant dismissal. The Tory groundlings, who might have been silenced by
this had the words been incontrovertible, decided they weren't but
recorded the Home Secretary as, pretty reasonably, wondering if the idea
of simply transferring the governor to a desk job was quite the right
response.
Mr Straw also had to navigate his way past Mr Lewis's two
on-the-record admissions, one to a Commons committee, that it was he who
made the dismissal decision. Well, Mr Howard was his boss, wasn't he,
said Mr Straw, coming close to calling his hero a liar.
Mr Howard, who throughout reminded us that he was a barrister of
quality conducting his defence with much more panache than his
assailants managed the attack, pointed out that whatever obligations the
head of an executive agency has to the Government, do not permit him to
lie to Parliament.
Ex-Tory Alan Howarth made a lamentable intervention which must have
made Labour wonder if he was such a prize, and finally Mr Tony Blair,
whose job was to be a supportive extra, nodding agreement as Mr Straw's
points hit home, found this increasingly difficult to do and joined in.
Nothing looks worse than a Front Bencher joining the colleague who is
supposed to be in charge, especially as Mr Blair got nowhere just a
little faster than Mr Straw. Mr Howard, smiling broadly, waved him
centre stage and having seen him off finished with the ''tough on
crime'' peroration that had the audience stamping and cheering in
Blackpool last week.
It proved a hit in the capital with only half those present who, as
the curtain came down, waved their programmes. The other half looked
gloomy and disappointed. They had been led to expect the play would end
with a lynching rather than a great, even if possibly temporary, escape.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair carried out a minor reshuffle of his Shadow
Cabinet yesterday, following elections that have left many MPs bitter at
what they claim was a deliberate attempt by traditionalists to embarrass
the leadership.
The senior posts have remained unchanged, with Mr Gordon Brown as
Shadow Chancellor, Mr Robin Cook as Shadow Foreign Secretary, and Mr
Jack Straw still in place as Shadow Home Secretary, despite a lacklustre
performance in yesterday's prisons debate.
However, last night Mr Blair was in the process of carrying out a
comprehensive overhaul of the middle and lower reaches of the Labour
Front Benches. At least eight Front Bench spokesmen have been dismissed,
with more expected to go.
Mr Blair has kept Hamilton MP George Robertson as Scottish Secretary
and will consult him on the replacement for Mrs Maria Fyfe, the Glasgow
Maryhill MP who resigned from the Scottish Front Bench on Wednesday.
Speculation on Mrs Fyfe's replacement centres on Paisley North MP
Irene Adams and Paisley South MP Gordon McMaster, who is currently a
Labour whip. Mr Blair is expected to consult Mr Robertson on the choice,
and other names are being canvassed.
The Labour leader's office said last night that the full Front Bench
team would not be announced until Monday. Mr Blair will be seeing MPs
over the weekend as he reshuffles his junior spokesmen.
Among the posts he has to announce will be that of Front Bench
spokesman on the European Social Chapter, industrial relations and the
minimum wage, which was described as a ''crucial assignment'' in the
run-up to the election. Candidates being suggested include Industry
spokesman Brian Wilson.
As expected, Mr Tom Clarke, MP for Monklands West, was named spokesman
for Disabled People's Rights. Although a member of the Shadow Cabinet,
Labour does not propose to create a separate ministry for the disabled,
and Mr Clarke will be forced to speak in the Commons under a variety of
departments, such as Transport, Health, and Social Security.
Mr Clarke surprised Westminster by being voted back on to the Shadow
Cabinet, where he had previously served as Shadow Scottish Secretary,
after being voted off last year on the back of what was considered a
disappointing performance in the post.
Mr Donald Dewar, MP for Glasgow Garscadden, moves from Social Security
spokesman to Labour Chief Whip, a move that gives an indication of the
importance Mr Blair attaches to the role.
Mr Dewar will face the task of managing the complexities of a Scottish
devolution Bill should Labour win the next election.
A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ''Tony sees Donald as one of the big
players. He will be deployed on the media as one of the few that can cut
across several issues. He will have a public role as well as the Chief
Whip.''
The two surprises in the list of posts are the demotion of Shadow
Transport Secretary Michael Meacher, who becomes Employment spokesman in
a junior role to Mr David Blunkett, the Shadow Education and Employment
Secretary.
Mr Meacher is understood to have resisted his move. His supporters see
the move as an attempt by party ''modernisers'' to sideline the left
wing.
Mr Meacher is replaced by Ms Clare Short, the Birmingham Ladywood MP,
who returned to the Shadow Cabinet backed by the concerted efforts of
Labour women MPs. A spokesman for Mr Blair said he had been keen to give
Ms Short a ''big job''.
Dr Jack Cunningham, the Trade and Industry spokesman who was voted off
the Shadow Cabinet, takes the Shadow Heritage Secretary job, and is
replaced by Mrs Margaret Beckett who, by virtue of coming top of the
poll with 187 votes, claimed one of the senior posts.
Dr Gavin Strang remains as Shadow Agriculture Minister after
significantly increasing his vote following his succes at improving
Labour's standing in rural areas.
Mr Blair has appointed the outgoing Chief Whip, Mr Derek Foster, as
Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He will join Deputy Leader
John Prescott to shadow Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and his
deputy, Mr Roger Freeman.
Tessa Jowell, Labour MP for Dulwich, last night was named as the
party's new spokesperson on women.The move is a big promotion for her
from her current position as a junior health spokesperson.
THE NEW LABOUR LINE-UP
TONY BLAIR'S Shadow Cabinet is now as follows:
Deputy Leader...........................John Prescott
Chief Whip..............................Donald Dewar
Defence, Disarmament and Arms Control...Dr David Clark

HOME Secretary Michael Howard last night swept to victory in the
Commons, easily surviving an Opposition assault on his handling of the
prison service as he rejected fresh calls for his resignation.
In a stormy censure debate, initiated by Labour, Mr Howard delighted
Tory MPs as he produced what the Prime Minister earlier described as
''conclusive documentary evidence'' to back his claim that he had not
intervened in the decision to remove the governor of Parkhurst prison on
the Isle of Wight.
After nearly three hours of tense debate, Labour's motion -- supported
by the Liberal Democrats -- deploring the ''unwillingness of the Home
Secretary to accept responsibility for serious operational failures of
the Prison Service'' was rejected by 280 to 231, a Government majority
of 49 (compared with its notional Commons majority of seven).
The Government's amendment ''utterly rejecting the very serious
allegations'' made against Mr Howard was then approved without a vote.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw maintained that there was
''overwhelming evidence'' of interference by Mr Howard on a day-to-day
basis in the running of the service.
Mr Major set the tone for the debate when at Question Time he gave
strong backing to the embattled Home Secretary, insisting: ''Mr Howard
richly deserves and gets my full support in his fight against crime.''
Labour leader Tony Blair brought uproar when he said Labour stood by
its charge that Mr Howard had interfered in the dismissal of Parkhurst
governor John Marriott.
In some of the most bitter exchanges between them yet, Mr Major
rejected Labour ''smears'' and demanded he apologise.
Later, as what had been seen as a make-or-break debate for Mr Howard
got under way, Mr Straw accused Mr Howard of ''following a
constitutional fiction'' in trying to separate responsibility for policy
from operational matters.
With Mr Marriott watching from the public gallery, Mr Straw told the
Home Secretary ''It's well known, not least to the press, that you you
wanted Mr Marriott's head and wanted to present it to the House that
afternoon.
Pointing to the minutes of the meeting on January 10 that decided Mr
Marriott's fate, he said: ''What these minutes show, for all the bluster
of the Tories opposite, is that Mr Howard himself raised the issue of
suspension.''
They were entirely consistent with the allegation by sacked prisons
director-general Derek Lewis ''and Mr Blair's, that Mr Howard told Mr
Lewis that he wanted Mr Marriott suspended.''
However, Mr Howard said of the meeting: ''Every decision that was made
on that afternoon was a decision of the director-general. It was the
director-general who decided exactly what happened.''
Challenged again to say if he had insisted on January 10 that Mr
Marriott should be removed from his job that day, he replied: ''No, I
didn't. The answer is no. All the decisions that were made that day,
were made by the Director General of the prison service.''
Mr Howard said: ''I am accountable and responsible for all policy
decisions relating to the service. The director-general is responsible
for day-to-day operations.''
If criticisms in this week's Learmont report on prison security had
been directed at him, ''I should not be standing at this despatch box
today''.
To further Tory cheers, Mr Howard insisted about Mr Marriott's
dismissal: ''I was entitled to be consulted by Mr Lewis about this
important matter, and I was.
''I was entitled to discuss the action which it was proposed to take,
and I did.
''I was not entitled to give instructions -- I did not.
''It was the director-general who decided that the governor should be
moved -- he was.''
He said he utterly rejected the allegations made by Mr Lewis in his
writ for unfair dismissal.
Turning on Mr Blair, he said the Opposition leader had ''demeaned his
office by allowing it to be used as a vehicle for the spleen of a bitter
man'' and added to more Tory cheers: ''He has shown himself utterly
unfit for office. He and his sidekick, Mr Straw, have shown themselves
utterly unfit for government.''
Mr Howard sat down to roars of support from his backbenchers, with
prolonged waving of Order papers.
However, he faced one note of discord from his own side when former
Prisons Minister Sir Peter Lloyd (Fareham) criticised the Home Secretary
over the sacking of Mr Lewis saying: ''In the kind of efficient prison
service this country deserves, you should have backed the
director-general and his board.''
* In a statement last night, Mr Lewis disclosed that during his
meeting with Mr Howard on January 10 Mr Howard asked him to think again
about how he proposed to deal with Mr Marriott.
Referring to the minutes of the meeting released by Mr Howard
yesterday, the statement said they ''do not record the fact that Mr
Lewis's absence in the middle of the meeting was to reconsider, at the
Home Secretary's request, his decision to move but not suspend Mr
Marriott.''
The statement said Mr Lewis would be writing to Sir Ivan Lawrence,
chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, to ask him to look again
at the affair.

A MISSING councillor has resigned from Cumnock and Doon Valley
District Council and as chairman of the Burns International Festival.
Both organisations received letters this week from Mr Eric Rowe, who
cited ''personal circumstances''.
Mr Rowe also wrote to Doonbank Nursing Home in Patna saying he would
not be returning to his job as business services manager.
The letters were posted in the South-east of England.
Councillors have shared Mr Rowe's workload since he went missing
almost a month ago, and meet on Wednesday to decide their next move.
With the council in its last year, an election looks unlikely.
Burns Festival director John Struthers said: ''The festival will be
having an executive meeting this week and a board meeting on November 1
to appoint a successor.''
He added: ''I'm obviously disappointed.''
Mr Rowe's wife, Elizabeth, was unwilling to speak about her husband.
Mr Rowe's disappearance was also discussed on Monday at a meeting of
Mauchline Labour Party, of which Mrs Rowe is chairwoman. Mr Kenny Blair,
chairman of the local community council, said: ''I feel very sorry for
Liz and the kids.''

A JUDGE will rule today on a legal bid by a group of local authorities
to block a Government proposal to put
trunk road maintenance out to tender.
The councils fear that the move by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
will lead to widespread job losses.
Seven of the councils, including Lothian, Tayside, Fife and Central --
which have banded together in consortia to compete with private firms
for the multi-million pound contracts -- went to the Court of Session
yesterday to ask for the tendering process to be suspended.
Lord Cameron heard two hours of legal argument, and will issue his
decision at 10am today, two hours before the noon deadline for
submission of bids.
Mr Neil Davidson, QC, for the local authorities, argued that the
Scottish Secretary had failed in his statutory duty to set out clear
guidelines under which bidders should operate.
Mr Davidson said: ''If there is to be fair competition between
contractors one has to know the basis on which they are being judged.''
''The process should not be allowed to proceed because no clear,
proper statement of criteria has been made.''
Mr Raymond Doherty, counsel for the Secretary of State, said the
contracts were being awarded over a five-year period, not for a fixed
amount of work but for an amount as yet unknown.
The Government had not committed itself to awarding contracts to the
lowest bidder, but to the bid that was considered to be the most
economically advantageous.
He submitted that the Secretary of State had clearly identified the
criteria and these would be applied in a uniform fashion to all bidders.
He asked Lord Cameron to dismiss the action.

WE all spend too much of our time connected by the ear to them, the
thought of life without our little plastic companions, curly tailed or
not is almost unimaginable.
The business world would founder and collapse without them, gossip
would be crippled and confined to the neighbours, and the technocrats'
notion of the ever-shrinking global village would be just another
cyber-babble outburst.
So forget the Internet, World Wide Web or whatever they are calling it
this week, it is the humble telephone which is at the heart of the
ongoing communications revolution. Millions of miles of lines and a
galaxy of interconnected satellites see to that, including all networked
and computer fax speak. The market for businesses to tap into is huge --
a fact not lost on Direct Line who in 1985 launched a new concept in
selling motor insurance over the phone. Like most bright ideas, this one
was very simple, and its success was also to prove lucrative.
An operating computer system had to be established which offered
potential customers a fast, friendly, competitive and, above all,
efficient service. The company engineered a system package based on a
series of preset questions which allowed immediate decisions to be made
over policy quotations. Once tailored by the operating company to suit
its needs, the system was ready to take on the High Street market.
With few staff and low overheads, one central office can cope with a
myriad of calls. The young company was soon successful. In 1989 Direct
Line extended operations into house insurance. By 1993 the financial
services arm was up and running offering loans to existing customers and
the following year saw the launch of Direct Line Mortgages.
In 1995 there was another first, both for Direct Line and the UK, with
the launch of Direct Line Life -- a life assurance service available
over the phone to the public.
So, having gained an important foothold in the UK market, the scene is
now set for Direct Line to build on its position by promoting its
strengths of simplicity and service. To this end, the company was
granted deposit taking status by the Bank of England which allows Direct
Line to venture into the savings market. This new savings by phone
service will be available from next month and promises to offer very
good rates of interest and the kind of efficiency and personal service
Direct Line has so obviously thrived on.
The future for the company looks exciting and it is constantly looking
at other personal finance products that can be developed to be sold over
the telephone.
It's also exciting and rewarding for the growing number of staff
required to keep the ball rolling in a direct line. The company offers a
first-class salary and benefits package, including prizes for best
achievers.
For all staff the prospects of speedy promotion and sponsorship for
Institute of Bankers exams beckons. The flat structure and open culture,
managing director Jim Spowart is frequently to be seen on the sales
floor, means a new recruit with the necessary drive, enthusiasm and
commitment can rise up through the ranks quickly. All vacancies are
advertised internally allowing every opportunity for advancement.
Coupled with expansion plans and the exceptional growth displayed by
the already established groups within the company, the need for ongoing
recruitment of tele-sales staff is a pressing one.
This is the kind of problem rival companies would give their eye teeth
for.
Much of the drive and motivation for this ongoing success has been put
down to the influence of the chief executive of the Direct Line group,
Peter Wood, and Fife-born managing director of the financial services,
Jim Spowart -- both great believers in the ''hands on'' school of
management.
With the Glasgow office open six days and nights a week (eight until
eight Monday to Friday and nine until five on Saturday) most people find
they can negotiate hours to suit them -- whether full or part-time. This
flexibility allows staff to find a shift pattern to match a wide variety
of domestic circumstances.
Recruitment is now underway at the 181-strong financial services
office in Glasgow's West Regent Street, and will continue on a drip feed
basis as demand for the various products increases.
So why not contact Direct Line today, you could be in line for a
change of career?

<HEADLINE>Key consumer safety unit faces 'drastic' cuts</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975798546</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A KEY consumer safety body which checks baby furniture, electrical
goods and fireworks faces drastic downgrading, according to leaked
Government documents published yesterday.
The revelation by the Labour Party comes just days after the
Government launched a firework safety campaign.
''This is a sinister attempt to demote consumer protection,'' Shadow
Consumer Affairs Minister Nigel Griffiths claimed.
The secret papers revealed plans ''virtually to disband'' the Consumer
Safety Unit of the Department of Trade and Industry.
The unit's existing roles include commissioning investigations into
safety issues, funding publicity campaigns to warn about dangerous goods
and maintaining a database built up over 20 years.
Under proposals in the leaked documents, the unit's staff would be
halved, to about 15, and they would be merged into a new unit which
would also cover competition policy, said Mr Griffiths.
''Big business is set to gain at the expense of consumers,'' he
claimed.
The unit's specialities would be ''farmed out'' to other parts of the
DTI.
Mr Mike Wadsley, vice-chairman of the Institute of Trading Standards
Administration, and chief trading standards officer in Essex, said the
loss would be very damaging.
''It will mean that what we do will probably be less effective because
we rely so much on a central organisation,'' he said.
A DTI spokesman confirmed department staff were currently being
consulted on the way work was organised, although he insisted there
would be no reduction in the overall staff effort dealing with consumer
safety.
''The proposals are designed to strengthen the DTI's work on consumer
and industrial safety,'' he said.
''Ministers will be announcing their decisions on the proposals during
November.''
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of the Consumers' Association, said:
''The proposals as we understand them are a severe bodyblow to the
consumer interest.''

BRITISH Gas yesterday defended its resumption of drilling on the
sea-bed between Scotland and Northern Ireland and said it was satisfied
there was no threat to public safety, despite concern that the work
could displace more explosive devices of the kind washed up on beaches
in south-west Scotland recently.
Mr Cedric Brown, the British Gas chairman, was speaking after meeting
a group of Scottish MPs earlier this week. The MPs called for a
suspension of work to construct a trench for a pipeline connecting
Scotland and Northern Ireland until a survey of the area could be
carried out.
Subcontractor Premier Transco restarted work on the Northern Ireland
side of the route yesterday afternoon after receiving the approval of
key Government departments.
The work, in which a plough is used to displace soil on the sea-bed
and allow the pipeline to drop into a trench dug for it, is expected to
take about two weeks to complete, depending on weather conditions.
Mr Brown said he told the delegation of MPs -- led by Mr George
Foulkes, the Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley -- that
British Gas took its responsibility for safety and protection of the
environment ''extremely seriously''.
He added: ''I explained that our operations are outside the designated
munitions dumping ground and stressed that we are proceeding with the
approval of the Ministry of Defence, the Health and Safety Executive,
and the Department of Trade and Industry.''
Mr Brown said he told the delegation that there was no evidence to
link recent appearances of ordnance with the pipe-laying activity of the
subcontractors 40 to 50 miles south of the area most affected.
''As with all our operations, I am satisfied that every effort is
being taken to ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the
public to operate on this basis.''
The delegation of MPs -- including Labour's Mr Brian Wilson, Mr Brian
Donohoe, and Mr Tommy Graham, Mrs Margaret Ewing of the SNP, and Tory Mr
Phil Gallie -- is concerned about safety and has warned Mr Brown and
Premier Transco that the companies would be held responsible if any of
their employees, or people in south-west Scotland, were endangered.
The environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth (Scotland) has
also criticised the resumption of drilling work on the sea-bed.
FoE spokesman George Baxter said yesterday: ''If British Gas has
approval to do the work it can do it. But if there are problems, which
seems likely given the extent of concern shown, then there will be
environmental consequences and this will be another example of hard
economic factors simply brushing the environment aside.''

RACIAL, religious, and ethnic conflict combined with hatred, murder,
and warfare have not diminished in an age of internationalism and mass
communications.
That is the view of Ms Raye Farr, director of the department of film
and video at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, who delivered the
second Lothian European Lecture in Edinburgh last night.
Her theme was the role the museum played in relation to European
history.
In a speech highly critical of a troubled political situation, she
said: ''As we stand at this historical juncture, on the cusp of a new
century, still we see on many horizons the violence of ongoing ethnic,
religious, and racial conflict, and the storms of fervent and bitter
nationalism.''
Ms Farr went on: ''There is hope arising from ceasefires, both near
and far, but ethnic cleansing is just not a story of half a century
ago.''
Evidence that the world had learned from history, she suggested, was
scant.
The Holocaust Museum, she said, served both as a memorial to the
victims of Nazi brutality and genocide half a century ago and as an
educational tool for the present.

A NINE-year-old Scots boy has died on holiday in Florida after
apparently being stung by a wasp.
Stuart Kerr, the son of Aberdeen businessman Ian Kerr and his wife
Jan, collapsed after being stung during a tour of Universal Studios.
Holidaymakers, including doctors and nurses on the scene, tried to
revive him and he was rushed to Arnold Palmer Memorial Hospital in
Orlando where it was discovered he had stopped breathing because of
anaphylactic shock -- a condition caused by the severe reaction to the
sting.
Tests are still being carried out to confirm that it was a wasp sting
which caused the allergic reaction.
Stuart, who suffered from severe asthma, was put on a life-support
machine following the tragedy on Sunday but after consultation between
doctors and his family this was switched off 24 hours later.
Mr Gordon Mackay, Mr Kerr's business partner, said Stuart's parents
had derived some comfort from the fact that his organs had been donated
to help save the lives of at least four other people.
''Stuart was a remarkable little man and he had carried an organ donor
card for some time,'' said Mr Mackay. ''The fact that as a nine-year-old
he carried a donor card says a lot about how caring Stuart was.
''He suffered severe asthma but coped admirably and led a full life.
He bore the burden of the asthma well and was passionate about sport. He
had been ski-ing since he was about two, he played rugby, and he enjoyed
swimming and karate.''
Mr Mackay, a partner in Grampian Business Products of which Mr Kerr
was co-founder and is managing director, said Florida was a favourite
holiday destination for the youngster who was a pupil at Robert Gordon's
College in Aberdeen.
He said he had been on holiday there last year with his father and had
returned this year during the October holidays with his parents and his
14-year-old sister Christine.
Dr George Russell, a consultant in medical paediatrics at the Royal
Aberdeen Children's Hospital, said yesterday that anaphylaxis was a
severe and overwhelming allergic reaction.
Instead of being confined to one area such as the skin, lungs, or nose
as with normal allergies, victims suffered a systemic reaction which
caused shock.
He said that, while fatal episodes were extremely rare, he had seen a
marked increase in the number of people who suffered from anaphylaxis in
recent years.
''I have been here for 25 years and in the last five years I have seen
more cases than probably in the previous 20,'' he said. He added it was
not clear whether the increase was because of an increasing number of
cases or simply more referrals because of publicity highlighting the
condition.
He said people suffered from anaphylactic episodes as a result of
allergies. One common cause was penicillin, although it was thought that
in the past that may have been due to impurities in the antibiotic.
Foods commonly associated with the condition are fish, and in
particular shellfish, fresh strawberries, and nuts.
Insect stings were another cause.
Dr Russell said the acute treatment for an episode was the
administration of adrenalin. People who were aware of their condition
could self administer adrenaline in the same way as diabetics injected
insulin.
Adrenalin sprays could also alleviate any swelling of the throat.

HIGHLAND Regional Council is taking legal advice over Dounreay's
controversial decision to increase the amount of foreign nuclear fuel it
reprocesses.
Councillors want to know whether the UK Atomic Energy Authority has
the relevant planning permission.
However, the planning committee was advised last month that Dounreay's
initial planning consent does allow the complex's operators to treat
foreign fuels.
Shortly before taking the decision councillors agreed to ask Dounreay
to submit a new planning application ''in order to allow full public
examination of all the implications of their proposals''.
Dounreay spokesman Mr Ian Shepherd said: ''We believe that our
planning consents are perfectly in order, but senior management will be
discussing what the practical implictions of these decisions are, if any
at all.''
The debate was sparked off by the Atomic Energy Authority's recent
decision to bid for reprocessing US-made ''A-bomb grade'' uranium fuel.
The US Government is expected to make a decision before the end of the
year.
This could mean Dounreay winning contracts worth more than #100m over
the next decade.
Councillor Alistair MacDonald, from Caithness, opposed yesterday's
moves by saying that ''the world would be a much poorer and more
dangerous place'' if Dounreay were to be barred from doing this
reprocessing work.
But SNP Councillor Dr Iain Glen, from Aviemore, said that there was
''extreme anxiety'' over this kind of re-processing in America, and
Dounreay could be asked to do the kind of work that no-one else wanted.
Later, Thurso councillor Jimmy Fry said that the decision set ''a
dangerous precedent'' for the council and it effectively meant that from
now on any planning permission could be retrospectively challenged.

SCOTLAND's tourism industry is suffering because of insufficient
Government support and a lack of aggression by the Scottish Tourist
Board in marketing the country overseas, according to the managing
director of Glasgow Airport.
Mr Donal Dowds said yesterday that Scottish Airports Ltd and other
organisations involved in tourism had ''put our money where our mouth
is'' over the years, while the Government had failed to recognise the
fundamental importance of tourism to the Scottish economy.
Speaking ahead of a major conference later this month on the
challenges facing the tourism industry, he said Scottish Airports had
recently invested #160m in its three airports -- Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
Aberdeen -- and had been centrally involved for several years in helping
the STB promote Scotland abroad.
''We have put our money where our mouth is, because tourism is
absolutely vital to us as well as everyone else,'' he said, adding that
foreign leisure travellers comprised 1.08m passengers a year to the end
of March 1995 at the three airports, making up 10.6% of the traffic.
''However, there has been a downward turn in Scottish tourism figures
and more effort is required by the Government to assist the tourist
board more vigorously in places like North America, Japan and
elsewhere.''
Mr Dowds said Scottish Airports' investment was in contrast to the
level of Government support for the STB, which he claimed last year
worked from a budget of about #11m compared with the Irish Tourist
Board's #20m.
''If we could get the Government to become much more pro-active than
they have been, to work with the Scottish Tourist Board, then I think it
would make a big difference. I also think the tourist board has to
become much more aggressive in working with the industry and making sure
that we get the message about Scotland across.''
He added: ''In a competitive world market-place, Scotland is being
starved of overseas marketing funds and is being left behind. We need
the Government to recognise the importance of tourism to Scotland and
the difficulties and the competition that we face overseas in promoting
our country.''
The Scottish Tourist Board said yesterday that its overall marketing
budget amounted to #7m, of which #2.5m was spent on overseas marketing
and #4.5m in the UK.
A spokesman said the UK figure included an additional #1.5m allocated
by the Scottish Office this year and that the overseas marketing budget
was supplemented by the British Tourist Authority's promotion of
Scotland abroad.

RELATIVES of alleged victims of the contraceptive pills cited by the
Government have welcomed the move.
Mr Wayne Ashbrook, whose sister Rachael died of a pulmonary embolism
four years ago, said he was glad the public was finally being made aware
of the risks.
''We need to raise public awareness because girls are still dying,''
he said.
Miss Ashbrook, 22, was a perfectly healthy woman for whom ''everything
was going well'' until she collapsed while on holiday with friends and
later died, said Mr Ashbrook.
She had been on the pill for only three months and was a fit,
non-smoker with no weight problems or history of thrombosis.
When a consultant told the Ashbrooks, from Chester, Cheshire, her
contraceptive could have contributed to her death, they were devastated.
''Her GP told mum if she hadn't been on the pill she would have been
alive today,'' said Mr Ashbrook, 35, who added: ''I certainly wouldn't
want my wife to use it.''
Mr John Arnold's daughter Sali also died from a pulmonary embolism
after taking a combined pill.
Ms Arnold, also 22, was a final-year biology student at Liverpool
Polytechnic, and was considered a low-risk case. She also collapsed and
died just three months after going on the pill.
Mr Arnold, from Cardiff, said he was glad the announcement would bring
the risks into the open. He suspected that deaths from the pill could be
higher than estimated.
''One of the major problems is that the pill never gets mentioned in
coroners' reports as a possible factor, so drug companies can hide
behind it,'' he said.
Mr Rachael Houghton, a solicitor representing alleged victims, said
the warning confirmed what her clients had known for years.

THE new owner of Glasgow's George Square Post Office building,
earmarked as the best possible site for a new National Gallery of
Scottish Art, is expected to be announced today.
There have been three bids for the building, believed to range between
#3m and #5m.
The plan to turn the Post Office into an art gallery has been put
together by Glasgow Development Agency on behalf of the National Gallery
Trustees and Glasgow District Council.
The other bids are from private companies, one seeking to turn the
building into a shopping centre, the other into an office block.
The Herald can reveal that a series of private talks and
behind-the-scenes meetings have been held in the past 10 days in an
attempt to secure the building for the GDA gallery plan.
The most crucial meeting was held in London last Friday and involved
two senior GDA officials, the director of the National Galleries For
Scotland, Mr Timothy Clifford, and Post Office chief executive Bill
Cockburn.
One member of the gallery team described the meeting as constructive
and said it had given the project, described as ''dead in the water''
only 10 days ago, at least a chance of success.
It is believed the Post Office executives are now sympathetic to the
gallery plan but must make sure it satisfies their own strict tendering
procedures. One of the main obstacles is that the gallery bid is likely
to be below the highest bid from the private sector.
However, senior district council sources told The Herald last night
that they remained hopeful that the GDA- led lobbying may have managed
to convince the Post Office of the importance of the project to Glasgow
and Scotland.
One senior council source said: ''The GDA-led bid isn't likely to
match the other bids cash wise but they have spelled out strongly how
important the site and the gallery will be to Glasgow and to the
country.
''Regarding the private bids, Glasgow has enough city-centre shopping
centres and office blocks. If we follow planning policy, a shopping
centre plan would be turned down because we have always opposed such
developments in George Square and where would that leave everybody?
''Having a national gallery there, however, would be great for the
city, would create jobs, and give the place a whole new buzz.''
Glasgow District Council chief executive Tom Monaghan, who only 10
days ago said he believed the gallery plan was doomed to failure, was
more up-beat yesterday.
Mr Monaghan, who did not attend last Friday's meeting in London but
who had been briefed on it, said he remained hopeful.
He said: ''At the London meeting, there was an opportunity to explain
the bid. I remain hopeful that the Post Office will come to the
conclusion that the GDA should be given the opportunity to develop.
''Ten days ago, after a meeting in Edinburgh, I did think we had lost
out. But what makes me hopeful is that the scenario at that meeting has
been subjected to further thought.''
District council leader Pat Lally said he was also hopeful that the
gallery plan had a chance of success.
A gallery spokesman said last night they had presented the merits of
their case and were awaiting the Post Office decision.
Of the other two developers, the Edinburgh-based Morrison Developments
said its architects had drawn up plans for a major office development
which it thought was in line with the existing planning approval.
The Aberdeen-based development company Jarlaw is also interested in
the building. Last night, its managing director Charlie Ferrari was
notavailable for comment.
It is believed, however, it plans to develop part of the former Post
Office as a shopping centre, with space being given over to create art
and sculpture exhibitions.
A Scottish Office spokesman said it could not comment on the gallery
site at present as it had not been contacted officially by the gallery
trustees about the site.
A spokeswoman for Royal Mail Property Holdings said the sale of the
building had been discussed at the highest level in both London and
Edinburgh. A statement would be issued today.

THE contraceptive pill revolutionised sexual behaviour when it was
introduced -- helping to put the swing into the Swinging Sixties.
It allowed women to take responsibility for birth control and had a
near total success rate.
It was invented by Professor Carl Djerassi, an American research
chemist, in an obscure laboratory in New Mexico on October 15, 1951.
It went through years of tests and became widely available in 1960. It
is still used by millions of women around the world.
However, euphoria about liberation from ''mechanical methods'' soon
started to fade as one health scare after another emerged and, in recent
years, the male condom has experienced a resurgence in popularity.
The pill is now prescribed mainly to young, healthy women and is not
recommended for heavy smokers.

THE Knoydart Foundation will not place a bid today to buy the remote
17,000-acre Knoydart Estate, it was announced last night.
A spokesman for the foundation -- made up of local people, local
authorities, environmental organisations and the West End musical
impresario Cameron Mackintosh -- said it needed more time to consider a
feasibility study into running the estate but that, if no new owner was
announced at close of bidding today, the foundation hoped to make a late
bid.
Mr Andrew Rettie, a partner in the firm of the selling agent, Strutt
and Parker, said five or six individuals were expected to bid for the
estate.
The current owners, the financially troubled jute company Titaghur,
have set an asking price of #1.5m.
More than 400 prospectuses were sent out in answer to inquiries across
Europe, the US, and Hong Kong.
The Surrey developer, Mr Philip Rhodes, who sold Knoydart to Titaghur
in 1993 because of his own financial problems, said yesterday that he
might join another consortium, involving an unnamed environmental
organisation, in a bid.
However, he added that his group might wait to see the outcome of
today's bidding before deciding on a definite course of action.
Members of the Knoydart Foundation hope that no successful bid will
emerge for Knoydart Estate when the noon deadline passes.
Mr Nigel Hawkins, representing the John Muir Trust, one of the members
of the Knoydart Foundation, said a feasibility study had been carried
out on the foundation's behalf by the Scottish Agricultural College in
Inverness.
This had looked at the future running of the estate, its local
community of around 50 people, and possible developments and employment
opportunities.
''We decided that the foundation will not be bidding to buy the estate
for the closing date but we are very interested in the estate and it may
be that the foundation may be in a position to consider purchasing the
estate at some date in the future.
''The foundation is going to be set up and established. We think there
is a place for the foundation, whoever the owners are.
''It can represent the interests of the community and wider
environmental interests and have discussions with the new owner, whoever
that might be,'' he said.
The foundation is comprised of representatives of the Knoydart
Community Association, the John Muir Trust, the Chris Brasher Trust,
Cameron Mackintosh, who owns the neighbouring North Morar Estate,
Kilchoan Estate, Nevis Estate, Highland Regional Council, Lochaber
District Council, and Lochaber Ltd, the local enterprise company.
The estate is currently running at a deficit estimated at between
#150,000 and #230,000.

VET Ryan James, found guilty of poisoning his wife with horse drugs,
won leave yesterday to appeal against his murder conviction.
James, 41, of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, was jailed for a
recommended minimum of 20 years in May.
The jury at Stafford Crown Court was told he killed his wife, Sandra,
39, the mother of his three children, to collect her #180,000 life
insurance.
The Crown claimed James could not support his wife and his mistress,
Catherine Crooks, and plotted to give the impression that his wife had
committed suicide.
Yesterday Lord Justice Roch, sitting in the Court of Appeal with Mr
Justice Forbes, said it was an ''unusual and difficult case''.
James's counsel had argued that the trial judge, Mr Justice Hidden,
did not properly present the defence case during his summing up.
Last month James married Mrs Crooks in prison.

CELEBRATIONS went on into the night in the Highland town of Golspie
yesterday after a local man won the gold at the Royal National Mod
there.
The ladies medal was lifted at the fifth attempt by a young biologist
from the Moidart peninsula.
A loud cheer rang round the packed hall at Golspie High School as it
was announced that Mr Finlay MacKay, the local Mod committee
vice-chairman, had won the coveted Men's Gold Medal.
The thirty-seven-year-old sales representative was ''absolutely
ecstatic'' to have taken the highest honour in Gaelic men's singing.
He was born in Stornoway but was brought up in Harris before moving to
Golspie.
Ms Margaret MacLellan, from Mingarry on the Moidart peninsula,
confessed to being very nervous before her winning performance but said
all her months of hard work had been worthwhile.
The 25-year-old Gael sang Cumha do Uilleam Siosal -- Lament for
William Chisholm -- a widow's sorrowful remembrance of her husband after
he was killed in the 1745 rebellion.
Ms MacLellan, who was also finalist for the Traditional Gold Pendant
and a member of the Ardnamurchan Choir, was brought up on tiny Eilean
Shona, of the west coast of Argyll and studied at Glasgow Caledonian
University.

TRADITION in any industry is a two-edged sword. It can be the
repository for unique skills built up over generations but it can, if
followed slavishly, become a stranglehold that prevents further
development, writes FRANCIS SHENNAN. The irony in Scotland is that many
traditional industries were founded on innovation and entrepreneurship.
The tweed-weaving company P &amp; J Haggart Ltd -- for instance -- was
founded in 1801 in the village of Acharn on the south side of Loch Tay.
It moved twice, eventually basing itself in Aberfeldy, where a retail
shop and tailoring business were added so that the firm carried out the
complete process from buying raw wool to selling complete suits. Indeed,
a farmer could bring his wool to the mill and receive payment for it in
the form of a suit.
Nowadays yarn made to the firm's own specifications is bought in from
outside and the finishing process of the woven cloth is carried out in
Galashiels, but the weaving, marketing and selling are still handled
from Aberfeldy.
John Simpson, who was invited in to run the firm in 1960 after having
been its accountant for 10 years, is now planning significant growth in
the manufacturing side of the business. He recently bought additional
looms from a Borders mill which closed and is looking towards export
markets.
He joined the STI Benelux mission with the object of appointing a
Dutch and Belgian agent after nationals from both countries had bought
tweeds from the Aberfeldy retail shop. He is also hoping to repeat the
success he had in winning orders from clothing manufacturers in France
which came through a French agent. That agent also managed to win an
order from Japan.

SCOTTISH National Party leader Alex Salmond yesterday forecast that
the Labour Party might not even come second in elections to a devolved
parliament in Edinburgh.
Labour would struggle hard, he said, if the first elections to such an
assembly were held at the mid-term of a Tony Blair government which had
disappointed expectations.
Mr Salmond was speaking on the eve of the full meeting of the Scottish
Constitutional Convention in Edinburgh at which the convention's newly-
published blueprint for a Scottish parliament will be endorsed.
Neither the Scottish National Party nor the Tories are members of the
convention and Mr Salmond warned that while Labour and the Liberal
Democrats were discussing their ''puppet assembly'', SNP canvassers
would be out around Scotland delivering the message that independence
was the way towards economic prosperity and social justice.
The Nationalists yesterday published a series of new campaigning
leaflets for the autumn entitled ''We're Better Off with Independence'.

ONE poignant wreath from three friends said it all: ''Tina sang she
was. Eubank thought he was. Jim Murray, we know, you're simply the
best.''
It was a sentiment reflected in the faces of the 1000 mourners who
gathered yesterday in Lanarkshire to bury Murray, the boxer who gave his
life for the sport he loved.
Under a grey sky that looked as if it had been pulled like a shroud
over his home town of Newmains, the mourners packed the church until it
was overflowing.
Murray, 25, died in hospital on Sunday after collapsing on Friday
during his challenge for the British bantamweight title in Glasgow.
The mourners yesterday included Drew Docherty, Murray's opponent in
his last fight.
Docherty, whose entire family attended the service, entered the church
by a side door, unnoticed by the 300 people gathered outside the church.
He left the same way soon after the service with his manager Tommy
Gilmour.
Among other mourners from the world of boxing were champions and
former champions including Barry McGuigan, Gary Jacobs, Paul Weir, and
Pat Clinton. Also present were Alex Morrison, Murray's manager, and
Frank Warren, co-promoter of the ill-fated fight.
Outside the church, wreaths were piled high, including one from Frank
Bruno, and one from Walter McGowan, former world flyweight champion who
was Murray's first trainer. Several floral arrangements were in the
shape of a boxing ring. One was dedicated to Our Newmains Champion. From
Murray's friends in the area, it said simply: ''You were our champion,
James. You will be greatly missed, as you were the best.''
The Church of Scotland service was conducted by the Rev Graham Duffin,
who paid tribute to Murray's dedication and sporting and personal
qualities.
He spoke of the deep sense of sadness of the mourners and an absence
of looking for blame. Murray's family have already said they do not
blame Docherty and the minister said: ''I respect them very much for all
that they have said on that.''
He recalled Murray as a youngster who had taken up boxing in his late
teens, as much to get him off the streets as anything else, and who went
on to show a real talent in his chosen sport.
''Jim was someone who gave his all for his boxing, totally committed.
He had a determination to win.''
Outside boxing, he was a young man who got on well with others, was
easy-going and popular and a loyal family man.
As Murray's coffin was carried from the church to the hearse, his
Scottish championship belt was on top of it.
After the funeral service, Murray was buried in the nearby
Cambusnethan Cemetery, where a lone piper led the cortege in to the
strains of Flower of Scotland. In a final tribute after the burial, the
piper played Scotland the Brave.

A FARMER has lodged a #17m writ against the Scottish Office for
alleged losses caused when a stretch of the M74 was built through his
land.
Mr James Wilson had previously raised a writ for #12m at Glasgow
Sheriff Court for losses he alleges he suffered when the Scottish Office
compulsorily purchased land at Kenmuir Farm, Mount Vernon, Glasgow.
He claimed a stockpile of sandstone, reclaimed from tenements
demolished in the city, was used to consolidate a stretch of the
motorway at Maryville. He was fined #450 for bringing two Shire horses
to the court to publicise his case.
In the second writ -- which brings the total claimed to #29m -- he
claims damages for sandstone which now lies buried and ''sterilised'' on
either side of the motorway.
In his battle for compensation Mr Wilson has threatened to put a toll
barrier across the M74 claiming it is built on land which he still owns.

SUPERMODEL Kate Moss is said to be furious at a poster showing her
bare bottom, being used to attract new members to the Conservative
Party.
A prospective parliamentary candidate has given his backing to the
campaign by young Tories in Cheltenham to entice new members.
Conservative students have been branded as ''sexist'' by Labour
supporters at Cheltenham's college of higher education for using the
poster of naked Moss sprawled face-down on a sofa under the slogan
''You're better off under the Conservatives''.
Tory students displayed the poster on a stall during the college's
Freshers' Week.
Moss, who is currently modelling the new designer collections in
Paris, is said to be angry and upset at being associated with the
Tories.
''I am sure that Kate would like it to be made clear that her own
political interests or persuasions are nothing to do with anyone else
but herself,'' said a spokeswoman for her London-based model agency
Storm.
''It has nothing whatsoever to do with anyone else -- especially any
political party using her without her permission.
''The picture they have used is from the campaign for the Calvin Klein
Obsession perfume and I am pretty sure that Mr Klein will be just as
annoyed and angry to hear that his advertising is being used without his
permission.''
Student Helen Newton, a helper on the Labour stall at the event, said:
''People said the poster was degrading and sexist.''
Mr John Todman, the Tories' prospective parliamentary candidate for
Cheltenham, said he could not see what all the fuss was about.
Mr Ken Buckland, chairman of the Cheltenham Conservative Association,
said later he would reprimand the Young Conservatives for using the
poster.

LABOUR stalwart Mr Bob Hughes, MP for North Aberdeen for 25 years, was
defeated last night in his bid to be prospective parliamentary candidate
for the new Aberdeen Central seat.
In a straight fight, the local constituency party chose Mr Frank
Doran, the former Aberdeen South MP, to fight the next election on their
behalf.
Last night Mr Hughes, 63, who was unavailable for comment, was
understood to be discussing with his family whether to try to contest
the new Aberdeen North constituency or to retire.
Mr Jack McConnell, the Scottish Labour Party secretary, said that the
number of votes for each candidate had not been revealed to the
constituency members but the result had been independently verified.
He said it was a close result and had attracted the highest percentage
poll of any Labour constituency in Scotland so far. It is understood
about 150 votes were cast, representing more than 90% of constituency
members.
The defeat is a bitter blow for Mr Hughes, who took Aberdeen North for
Labour in 1970 and celebrated his 25th anniversary in the seat only a
few weeks ago. His current majority is 9237.
Under boundary changes, half of the North Aberdeen constituency is
included in the new Central constituency, which looks a safe Labour
seat.
The other half comes from the existing Aberdeen South, which Mr Doran
won from Conservative Gerry Malone in 1987 but lost to Mr Raymond
Robertson in 1992.
Mr Doran said: ''I am obviously delighted at the result.'' He had been
a friend of Bob Hughes for many years and there had been no animosity
between them.
Mr Doran denied it had been a victory for New Labour over old Labour,
and said that he had fought his campaign on the promise of being a very
pro-active MP if elected.
Mr McConnell said that Mr Hughes, as the sitting MP, had the right to
be automatically considered for the short leet for Aberdeen North, if he
wished.
Mr McConnell said he expected Mr Hughes to make an announcement about
his intentions as soons as possible.
The candidate for Aberdeen South, which will have an all-women short
leet, will be decided on November 16. Aberdeen North will be decided on
January 21.

Scotland's smaller textile companies are having to look beyond
'classic' products to win the approval of international markets.
And the signs are promising, reports Francis Shennan
Most people's list of modern Scottish industries will almost certainly
miss out at least one, for it is - rightly - categorised as
''traditional''. That does not have to mean old-fashioned, however.
It employs 57,000 people directly and others in supplier companies,
and exports throughout the world. That industry is textiles.
Most of the coverage of the industry focuses on the larger groups. In
the Borders Dawson International's Pringle is probably larger than the
rest of the firms put together. Many other famous brands are owned by
international companies, such as Courtaulds which owns Lyle &amp; Scott.
However, some of the smaller companies have been proved more resilient
than the larger, more high-profile groups, mainly because they focused
more clearly on their strengths and avoided too wide a diversification.
They also provide an opportunity for managers and sales executives to
be more closely involved in multiple facets of the business. For the
executive looking for a less compartmentalised role in a company, these
firms can provide some surprising opportunities.
Working with smaller companies does not mean taking a step back in
terms of international markets or the sophistication of the equipment.
''I hate the phrase 'traditional knitwear industry','' says Danny
Millar, knitwear manager of Lochcarron of Scotland, based in Galashiels.
''We have some of the most modern machinery you could buy. The only
thing that is traditional is our commitment to quality.''
He returned last week from a Scottish Trade International mission to
Belgium and Holland with a sample order which could lead to a long-term
relationship with the Disney Corporation. The order is from a Belgian
company which sells Disney-licensed products throughout Europe.
Lochcarron will supply men's, women's and children's knitwear under a
Disney-licensed label to be embroidered with the corporation's cartoon
characters. It was soon clear from the meeting with the Belgian company
that it was not aware of the range of products Lochcarron could supply.
The company employs 168 people and already exports to the US, Canada,
and the Far East. It supplies traditional products such as regimental
ties and has Royal warrants for its tartan, but it also produces
complete fashion outfits for women.
Its range of customers could hardly be more varied, ranging from the
Dalai Lama to supermodel Naomi Campbell.
The international potential for fashionable goods from Scottish firms,
and the industry's capacity to meet the demand, was confirmed by
consultant Anne Ritchie, who also took part in the mission.
She was commissioned by three local enterprise companies -- Enterprise
Ayrshire, Borders Enterprise and Forth Valley Enterprise -- to
investigate the opportunities for knitwear and clothing in the Benelux
countries.
In 20 meetings on the five-day mission she met retailers, wholesalers,
importers and agents in Brussels, Amsterdam, and The Hague.
''The machinery, the knitting and the quality in the Scottish industry
are all good,'' she says. ''And the designers know how to design. There
are still some companies, though, making a very traditional garment.
''This is not suitable for the continental market and it is not so
suitable in the UK. The problem is some of the managements -- they are
not sufficiently aware of what is happening in the marketplace -- but
there are a number of companies taking this on board.
''It is very important, otherwise we are going to lose business; but
there is not a large amount of work that needs to be done.''
The association of Scottish firms with traditional markets can obscure
the potential in European mass markets. ''Both markets have potential in
Belgium and Holland,'' said Ritchie, ''but especially the volume sector
in the Dutch market.
''Belgium was closer to the French and Italian markets in terms of
style, the Dutch more towards the German market. But it also looked
towards London for younger fashions. The higher-value merchandise fits
in well in Belgium.
''There is some resurgence for traditional styles in the Dutch market,
but no-one wants an old-fashioned classic look. Some of our companies
are very well prepared to supply these markets.''
Even traditional luxury products need a modern approach. Claridge
Mills, of Selkirk, has long been associated with cashmere and merino
lambswool, but it also has extensive jacquard weaving facilities.
This means intricate designs such as figured patterns and pictures can
be woven, so that as well as traditional Fairisle and Argyle styles, and
scarves, wraps and throws, it can produce spectacular pictorial
blankets.
Combining the higher-value and volume markets has been the key to
success for many smaller companies and they need executives who are able
to operate in both sectors. David Watson became chief executive of
Seafield of Scotland Ltd after a management buy-out last year. It had
previously had Australian, Scottish and Yorkshire-based owners in
succession.
The Keith-based mill manufactures woollen and worsted fabrics for
jackets and accessories and in the first year after the buy-out focused
on contract weaving, especially for independent US importers, to form
the basic business.
''We manufacture products like scarves, rugs and so on,'' he says.
''We do the traditional Scottish product but we also say to customers:
'If you want to work with our design team on a particular product, we
will do that and manufacture it for you.'
''We are very happy for people who might have a problem to know we
have a weaving capacity and to ask us to do a particular job for them.''
Now it is ready to build on that and joined the Benelux trade mission
with the aim of meeting potential agents. Its autumn and winter
collection for 1996-97 has an innovative range of fabrics for both men's
and women's wear.
''There will be lots of opportunities,'' said Watson. ''You have to
have the appetite to go out and look for the work. There will always be
customers who are more comfortable working with a smaller operation.
''They find that they can walk in and discuss on a face-to-face basis
and know they will be treated as an important customer.''

THE Scotland-London air fare price war intensified further yesterday
when two of the main carriers entered the fray.
British Midland confirmed that it would offer a #58 return ticket for
some flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London, apparently as a
response to the #29 single fare to Luton, 40 minutes from London, being
charged by the new budget operator, EasyJet.
The move by British Midland, the second biggest carrier on the route,
immediately prompted third-placed Air UK to introduce a #58 fare.
Waiting in the wings is market leader British Airways, where a
spokeswoman said: ''We have no plans to match these fares but we are
watching developments.''
BA's lowest fare is #74 but if sufficient consumers defect to its
rivals it is thought likely that it will be forced to reduce its price.
British Midland's regional sales manager, Mr Stephen Craven, said its
new Diamond Deal price would be available from the onset of the
airline's winter timetable, on October 29.
Tickets are on sale now but are subject to availability and passengers
must include an overnight Saturday stay in London. Mr Craven said: ''Our
new leisure fare represents outstanding value for money.''
Similar restrictions will apply to the Air UK ticket, which will also
take effect from October 29.
EasyJet's operation will be launched from Glasgow on November 10, and
from Edinburgh two weeks later, while Ryanair will start its
Prestwick-London Stansted service next week, with a lowest return fare
of #59.
Bus travel remains the cheapest option. National Express charges #25
for a return ticket between Glasgow and London.

THE chief executive of Highland Spring yesterday attacked SNP MP
Roseanna Cunningham for the handling of a protest about rural
depopulation on the doorstep of the company's Perthshire headquarters.
Mr Joe Beeston said his employees had been extremely upset and were
very angry that the protest had been directed at Highland Spring
''rather than where it should be directed''.
His outburst followed a protest by about 30 people, led by the
Perthshire and Kinross MP Ms Cunningham, claiming that the 20,000-acre
Blackford Estate in Perthshire had been allowed to fall into decay. The
group boarded up empty windows at a tumbledown farmhouse, which they
said was typical of about 30 properties on the estate.
Highland Spring leases a 2000-acre area from Blackford Farms Ltd,
which is owned by the man who owns Highland Spring, His Excellency Mahdi
Mohammed Al Tajir, a former United Arab Emirates ambassador to Britain.
Ms Cunningham said: ''The SNP has organised this demonstration to
highlight a particularly bad example of what we know is a general
problem in rural Scotland today -- the lack of public accountability for
land use, leading to a continuing process of rural decay and
depopulation.''
She added: ''Both Highland Spring Ltd and Blackford Farms Ltd are
owned by the same man, Mr Al Tajir, proprietor of both the Blackford and
Ardoch estates and one of the richest men in the world.
''It is our understanding that there is an intention to remove the
remaining non-secure tenants from their homes on the northern flank of
the Ochils opposite Blackford and to demolish the properties.
''Other properties, recently vacated and sadly neglected, may also be
demolished and yet another estate job is in danger of being lost. It is
time to stop the rot.''
No-one was available for comment from Blackford Farms but Mr Beeston
said that on the 2000 to 3000-acre area from which Highland Spring took
its water, there were no plans to move anyone or to demolish any
building other than a long-vacant building which had been vandalised and
was therefore unsafe.
''We have created almost 200 jobs through the use of 2000 to 3000
acres and for the SNP to target Highland Spring and to make a protest
about land use in Scotland in general is very disappointing, especially
as the SNP has never approached me about its concerns. If I can use my
influence in any way, I hope to do so,'' said Mr Beeston.

A BIRTH control pill previously thought to be the safest available was
yesterday issued with a Government health warning.
The combined oral contraceptive, which is taken by 1.5 million women
in Britain, has been described as twice as likely as other types of pill
to cause blood clots in certain users.
One senior family planning doctor predicted chaos with women coming
off the pill in droves as a result of the warning. There were also
claims that the Government's action was too hasty.
The type of pill has been recommended by doctors and family planning
clinics since its introduction to Britain in the last decade. Half of
those on such contraceptives use them.
Now doctors have been advised not to prescribe them to women who are
overweight, or have varicose veins or a history of thrombosis.
The Royal College of Nursing's Scottish secretary, Ms June Andrew,
said last night that women should not panic, and continue to take any
contraceptive pill prescribed to them.
''It is more dangerous to become pregnant, and there are, of course,
other forms of contraception available, should women choose.
''If in doubt, any woman taking the contraceptive pill is free to
contact her GP, and should do so,'' she said.
The Government's Committee on Safety and Medicines issued the warning
to the public, GPs, and pharmacists after new studies apparently showed
that the contraceptive was twice as likely as other types of pill to
cause deep vein blood clots.
The warning concerned pills sold under the brand names Femodene,
Femodene ED, Minulet, Triadene, Tri-Minulet, Marvelon and Mercilon.
Other pill brands, not subject to yesterday's warning, are Ovranette,
Microgynon, Trinordiol, Lowgynon, Ovysen, Brevinor, Trinovum, Synphase,
Norimin, and Neocon.
The World Health Organisation was said to be furious that data was
taken from an unpublished study it had carried out.
Dr Ian McKee, a former member of the British Medical Association's
Scottish General Council and now an Edinburgh GP, said that he was
surprised at the way the Government had reacted, because it could
needlessly induce panic among women.
Dr Jane Davie, of the Family Planning and Well Woman Service for
Lothian, said that oral contraceptives were regarded as an excellent and
safe method of contraception.
Risk factors relating to thrombosis were very small. ''The risks
associated with an unwanted pregnancy are far greater than the risk of
continuing these pills,'' she said.
Dr Anne Szarewski senior clinical medical officer at the Margaret Pyke
Centre in London, a leading family planning clinic, said the
Government's reaction was irresponsible and premature.
''We don't even know what numbers were involved in these studies, and
small-scale studies are subject to a fair amount of bias,'' she said.
She also said that the perceived safety of the newest pills had meant
that women were put on them now who would previously have been
considered high risk and that in itself could boost the level of
thrombosis.
''When you don't know why something happens you don't leap ahead and
draw vast conclusions,'' Dr Szarewski added.
''The effect of this is going to be absolute chaos. All these women
who have been told this is the best pill to take are suddenly being
thrown completely and told they are more dangerous. Women will stop
taking the pill in droves.''
The new research appears to indicate that the risk of deep vein
thrombosis with the combined pill is six times the normal average and
double that faced by woman who use other types of pill.
However, experts were keen to stress that even that risk level
represented a ratio of only three in every 10,000 for healthy young
women -- half the natural risk of thrombosis during pregnancy.
Blood clots forming in the veins, usually in the legs, can cause
serious health problems if they break away and travel into the vessels
of the lungs. They could lead to death in rare cases.
The World Health Organisation's study emerged in July. At that stage
the findings were incomplete and inconsistent, but Government health
officials were sufficiently alarmed to urge a speeding up of another
study on the same subject under way in Europe. Its results were obtained
earlier this month.
Final confirmation that action had to be taken came after the
Committee on Safety of Medicines conducted a rapid study of its own
using information from a GP database.
The question of whether to withdraw the pills was discussed with
family planning experts but was rejected partly because there are women
who cannot tolerate any other types of contraceptive pill.
Government scientists cannot explain why the combinations pills are
less safe but are examining the theory that the risk is linked to a
reaction between the two hormones involved.
Manufacturers questioned the evidence of a problem with the
contraceptives.
Schering Health Care, of Sussex, which makes Femodene, Triadene, and
Tri-Minulet, said: ''The company is deeply concerned about actions which
could result in undue concern and anxiety in users.''
Organon Laboratories, of Cambridge, which produces Marvelon and
Mercilon, disputed the conclusions and considered the new data
''potentially flawed''.
* The Department of Health said people who wanted more information
could call the Health Information Service on freephone 0800 665544.

THE GOVERNMENT is consid-
ing handing over a quarter of a million acres of land in northern
Scotland to local ownership, it emerged last night.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who is to announce details today,
told BBC TV in Scotland: ''My opponents will call it privatisation. But
those who support it will see it as genuine devolution.''
He confirmed he is considering the transfer to local interests of
crofting land currently owned by the Scottish Office and which was taken
into state ownership after the First World War to provide work for
returning Servicemen.
Mr Forsyth said: ''If we can release the energy and enthusiasm and the
enterprise which we have seen in the Highlands, which have been
transformed in recent years by approaching policy in this way, that's
something which would benefit the whole of Scotland. And of course, it
would benefit the taxpayer.''
The plan is for the land to be transferred to local groups or trusts
but no details were given about whether it would be sold to them at
market price or by some other means.
The Tories could benefit politically. Land ownership is an emotive
issue in rural Scotland and the Opposition might have difficulty in
depicting it as a full-blooded privatisation to the highest bidder.
Hundreds of thousands of acres, particularly in the Highlands and
islands, come under the complex crofting system of agricultural tenancy.
The Scottish Office owns 95 crofting estates, amounting to 1400
holdings covering a quarter of a million acres.
This makes it Scotland's biggest crofting landlord, although there are
a total of 17,000 crofts mostly held by private landlords.
Mr Forsyth is proposing the handover of the common grazing lands owned
by the Scottish Office, and used collectively by local crofters. As they
are used collectively, they would have to be handed over to bodies
representing the local communities.
0  Mr Brian Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, challenged the wisdom of
the plan. He said: ''If Michael Forsyth believes common ownership is a
good thing he should have the guts to apply it to the vast areas of
absentee-owned crofting land under private ownership.
''The estates which he is offering are the best managed because they
are publicly owned -- by the Department of Agriculture.''

TWO civilian workers were badly injured in an explosion yesterday at a
top secret military experimental base.
The explosion happened at 11.30am on a trials range at West Freugh
airbase, about five miles from Stranraer, the Defence Evaluation and
Research Agency said.
The workers, a man and a woman, were handling a piece of ammunition
when it blew up. They were taken to the Garrick Hospital in Stranraer
then transferred by air to Glasgow.
The man is believed to have suffered 50% burns, to have two leg
fractures, and to have lost his right hand. Glasgow Royal Infirmary said
he was in a ''serious'' condition and would undergo an operation later.
The woman, who suffered less serious burns, was ''comfortable''. They
have not been named although it is believed they both come from England.

SIX FISHERMEN were winched to safety late last night in a dramatic
air-sea rescue on the shores of the Pentland Firth after a trawler
struck rocks and was pounded by heavy broken seas.
The 85ft Moray boat Solan ran aground on the north coast of Caithness
soon after leaving Scrabster harbour.
The 10-year-old Inverness-registered Solan, which had sailed to the
fishing grounds from the Caithness port at about 9pm, put out a Mayday
call 25 minutes later.
Thurso lifeboat under coxswain Billy Farquhar was launched soon
afterwards but found it impossible to get alongside the grounded vessel
because of the rough seas and ebbing tide.
Waves from a heavy swell coming in from the Atlantic were also being
whipped up by a Force Five north-westerly wind and were sweeping right
over the stranded boat's deck and hull.
Coastguards in Kirkwall, Orkney, called out the coastguard rescue
helicopter from Sumburgh Airport, Shetland, to try to lift the six-man
crew off the boat.
However, a coastguard spokesman said attempts to winch the men off by
helicopter had been hampered by bad weather and the heavy seas driving
the boat against the rocks.
A land-based coastguard team of volunteer auxiliaries was also in
place on the shoreline opposite the stricken trawler.
Just before midnight a coastguard spokesman said the helicopter had
managed to pluck the six-man crew to safety. ''They are all safe and
well and being taken to the seamen's mission in Scrabster,'' he said.
The vessel struck rocks at Murkle Point, which lies at the eastern end
of Thurso Bay, three miles from Scrabster.
Locals said the Solan had keeled over on to her side and was being
pounded by heavy seas.
She ran aground soon after high tide at a spot immediately north of
the top secret US Navy base at Murkle, near Thurso.
All the vessel's lights went out and coastguards used flares to
illuminate the scene.
The steel-hulled Solan is one of more than 30 trawlers which regularly
operate out of Scrabster, fishing in waters to the west of Orkney and
Shetland.
The vessel was built in St Monans, Fife, and is believed to be crewed
by men from Hopeman, inMoray.
* Four fishermen had to be rescued by Mallaig lifeboat from the sea
south of Skye when their boat the Nighean Don ran into bad weather.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard yesterday seemed to have rescued his
political career by rebutting point by point allegations that he had
intervened directly in the operation of prisons policy, particularly the
removal of Mr John Marriott as the governor of Parkhurst prison.
In a robust Commons performance, during a crucial debate on the
Government's handling of the Prison Service, Mr Howard hit out at Labour
claims that he should be accountable for all matters concerning the
service.
Mr Howard made clear his view that there was a distinction between
policy and operational matters. He attacked the Shadow Home Secretary,
Mr Jack Straw, for a ''cheap and tawdry attempt to make petty
party-political capital out of the difficulties of the Prison Service''.
The heated debate was marked by clashes between Mr Howard and Mr
Straw, and by interventions by Labour leader Tony Blair. Labour sought
to link Mr Howard directly to decisions which led to a damning report on
the Prison Service by Sir John Learmont, followed by the sacking of Mr
Derek Lewis as director general of the service.
All seemed well for Mr Howard until Mr Lewis afterwards gave a version
of events that conflicted in a crucial word with that recorded in
Hansard.
Central to the debate was a meeting on January 10 this year between Mr
Lewis and the Home Secretary on the removal of the governor of
Parkhurst. Labour's Dr John Reid, MP for Motherwell North, challenged Mr
Howard to say if he had insisted Mr Marriott should be removed from his
job that day.
Mr Howard insisted: ''No, I didn't. The answer is no. All the
decisions that were made that day were made by the Director General of
the Prison Service.''
He said that the distinction between policy and operations was nothing
new. It was reflected in the framework document setting up the Prison
Service as an executive agency, and if criticism in the Learmont Report
had been directed at him: ''I should not be standing at the despatch box
today''.
Mr Straw accused Mr Howard of ''following a constitutional fiction''
in trying to separate responsibility for policy from operational
matters.
Labour's motion deploring the unwillingness of the Home Secretary to
accept responsibility for serious operational failures of the prison
service was defeated by 49 votes.
Last night Mr Lewis repeated his insistence that he had been under
''considerable pressure'' from Mr Howard during their meeting on January
10 to suspend Mr Marriott.
Mr Lewis denied he had agreed to the form of words then used by Mr
Howard in his statement to the Commons announcing the suspension of Mr
Marriott.
''I asked for a change to be made to the statement but was
overruled,'' he said, adding that it was Mr Howard who overruled him.
''I asked for the word 'today' to be removed from that statement. He
(Mr Howard) declined to do so,'' Mr Lewis told BBC TV's Newsnight
programme.
He explained: ''The draft was presented to the meeting and we were
asked for our comments on it.
''I said that I would prefer the word 'today' to be removed because
the precise timing had not been determined and the Home Secretary
decided that it should stay.''
He added: ''It was part of a longer discussion which involved pressure
to influence operational decisions within the prison service.
''It was an example of a number of such instances which have occurred
over time which blur the distinction between the responsibility of the
prison service and the role of Ministers.''
He said there was an adjournment in the middle of the discussions
because Mr Howard had asked him to reconsider his decision to move Mr
Marriott rather than suspend him.
He said: ''There was pressure applied to me as director general to
change an operational decision that I had made. In the end I resisted
that pressure and the original decision remained.''
Mr Lewis said: ''The decision to move was mine. The wording was his.''
In a further embarrassment to the Government it was revealed last
night that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Mr William Waldegrave,
warned the Home Secretary that he would have no extra funds to implement
Sir John Learmont's prisons report.
