CONDITIONS do not get any easier for United Biscuits, the food group
probably best known for its McVitie's biscuits and KP crisps and snacks.
No sooner does it seem to get on top of one problem when another arises.
No wonder it is the perennial bid stock with Hanson usually mooted as
the likely buyer. But then Hanson is wheeled out as the likely predator
for any number of businesses these day.
Still it has not happened yet although United Biscuits' mixed results
for 1994 and the continuing tough outlook in some key directions would
indicate that bid expectations could still be the biggest prop for the
share price, down 2p to 337p yesterday.
Profits before tax and exceptional items were slightly lower at
#178.7m against #181.8m on group sales maintained at #3430m. At the
pre-tax level, though, profits were #133.8m after the costs of factory
closures and losses on business disposals. A final dividend of 9.8p
maintains the total at 15.3p covered by adjusted earnings per share
marginally ahead from 24.2p to 24.5p.
With high marketing spending and rising raw material costs, margins
are still under intense pressure, falling from 13.5% to 11.2% last year
and a further decline expected. The company's previous problem area,
Keebler in the US, appears to be going according to plan. Keebler's
profits and margins are ahead as restructuring continues though there is
still a long way to go.
But in dull consumer conditions, UK snackfood margins are suffering.
McVitie's UK saw its profits tumble from #83.1m to #68.7m at the
operating level on sales only a shade lower at #610.7m while KP's UK
operation dropped from #35.5m to #29.7m on slightly higher sales of
#399.5m.
The good weather last year did not help, it meant the biscuit market
fell by 2%. But packaging and raw material price rises was a major
factor. In the present competitive scene these simply could not be fully
reflected in increased selling prices -- a rather familar story. Part of
the solution, said United Buscuits, is to reduce the cost base -- the
decision to shut the Grimsby snack factory, announced in January was
part of this process.
Snackfood sales in continental Europe increased by 17% to #529m while
overall operating profits were broadly unchanged. The biscuit business
improved profits and margins in most countries across the region but the
performance of savoury snacks was mixed. KP continental Europe's profit
and margin performance suffered from a disappointing performance in
Spain.
United Biscuits does seem to be enjoying unalloyed success in its
Asia-Pacific operation, where the acquisition in 1993 of the Smith's
Snackfood Company, clear leader in the Australian salty snack market,
transformed the scale of the operations.
Another success is Ross Young's, the UK frozen and chilled food
business which achieved a 10% profit increase on sales up 3%. Ross
Young's certainly shows what can be done. A few years ago, it was a
major drag on the company and United Biscuits was contemplating
disposal.
But in general, the group is operating in a tough old world. The
chairman, Sir Robert Clarke, yesterday said the company anticipates that
trading conditions in all the group's markets and the results, will be
affected by input cost inflation, particularly in packaging, estimated
to have added #30m to costs, and rising worldwide interest rates.
The response from United Biscuits is to promise to boost its marketing
expenditure yet again though this has yet to have much impact on sales
and also puts pressure on margins, and to continue to launch a string of
new products in the UK.
There were plenty of these last year also. It remains to be seen
whether this approach will ultimately prove successful. So far they look
to have made little impact.

A bomb containing 2lbs of explosives was defused last night at a store
in the border town of Newry, County Down, by Army experts in an
operation which took several hours.
It coincided with Gerry Adams' high profile meeting with President
Clinton in Washington. The RUC said tonight that Army experts believed
the explosive was Semtex -- an explosive used by the IRA in Northern
Ireland.
The device partially exploded while it was being made safe, although
no one was hurt.

A REPORT that the Government plans to introduce education vouchers is
''absolutely without foundation,'' the Prime Minister told the Commons
yesterday.
His denial followed speculation arising from comments on Wednesday by
Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken which were taken as an
indication that vouchers are a favoured option to fund a wider nursery
system.
The issue moved up the agenda when free-market theorist Lord Skidelski
disclosed on Wednesday that he had suggested to No. 10 that they be used
to fund the entire state system.

OIL and gas services group OGC International is poised to acquire a
larger or similar-sized company, after a record-breaking 1994.
The management team at the Aberdeen-based group, which was floated in
June 1993, was so busy coping with the exceptional level of activity
that it did not have time to act on last year's examination of 110 UK
companies.
However, speaking after yesterday's news of a 15% increase in 1994
pre-tax profits to a record #12.9m, managing director John Hyslop said:
''We are looking at three fairly interesting possibilities and we may
proceed with one or even two.''
He revealed that two of the possible targets were of similar size and
one was larger, adding: ''We probably feel we can come in and turn
something around.''
OGC's total payout for the year to December is 9% higher at 5.75p,
after a final dividend of 3.9125p.
Turnover increased by 24% to a record #269.6m, boosted by OGC's
acquisition of sole ownership of AOC Australia Pty. However, on a
like-for-like basis, turnover was still up 18%.
Although chairman Richard Wilson said 1995 had started well, with a
substantial amount of work on hand, he did not expect OGC to reach the
record level of activity achieved last year. Shares lost 4p to 136p
yesterday, in a broadly unchanged sector.
In 1993, OGC envisaged a 1994 turnover of between #230m and #240m and,
with safety-related work in the wake of the Piper Alpha disaster having
tailed off, 1995 turnover is likely to be closer to this range.
Prinicipal operating subsidiary AOC International realised profits on
completion of a number of sizeable contracts during the year.
AOC is engaged in a major contract for the complete modification of
Shell's Brent Bravo platform in the North Sea, which is being converted
from oil to gas production.
The OGC subsidiary will work on the conversion of Shell's Charlie and
Delta platforms with Aberdeen-based Wood Group in the next few years.
During the year, Norwegian shipping tycoon Fred Olsen's stake in OGC
was reduced from 60% to 40%, with the acquisition of his Fairhaven
International company by Eagleville, the Olsen family interests company.
Other shareholders consequently now own 60%.
OGC's onshore business continues to develop, with the group working on
a #65m gas receiving facility at Liverpool Bay in North Wales for BHP
Petroleum.
The general outlook in Australia is good, following a major gas
discovery there.
OGC is well positioned for an acquisition, with no net gearing and net
funds of #22.9m at the year-end.

War artist, wife, mother and Irish enigma, Elizabeth Cope confides in
Clare Henry
about the nervous vision driving her complex life
GOING back to Somalia to finish the paintings she had begun there as
the first Irish war artist -- into chaos and discarded landmines -- left
Elizabeth Cope unsure and frightened because this time she knew what to
expect.
''The crying-out pain of starvation may be over but the hunger is
still there. The people in the refugee camps don't complain. They're
beyond that. With no government, things are in a state of chaos. There
are landmines everywhere. People are a law unto themselves. Even
10-year-olds carry guns. You never know who will be shot or stabbed.''
Cope is by her own admission ''of the happy school of painting. It's
too easy to be negative. I wanted to see if there was hope to be found
in Somalia. There was.''
She eagerly shows me her photos. ''Look, did you ever see such a
wonderful smile? That's Mohammed. His pelvis was crushed and he's spent
five months in a hospital hammock but he still loves life. The poorest
people are the kindest. The women are amazing; great women.''
She points to a photo (''I always ask for permission to snap them'')
of three Somali mothers in bright costumes saluting. ''One of them had
lost three sons and a husband. The salute is for all women -- and for
me.''
Unlike Britain's official Bosnian war artist, the Scot Peter Howson,
who inspired her trip, Cope's pictures do not focus on guns, blood and
guts, anger and hate, but on conciliation; on the redeeming power of
family affection and old-fashioned motherly love.
Many pictures show hospital patients at Bula Howa and at Dolo in the
Gedo region. ''Being a woman has its advantages. Men would not be
allowed in, nor would a male artist be able to paint a woman, but the
other way round, a female artist painting a man, is not so bad. I also
think a male artist would have been regarded with more suspicion.''
The children are distressing. So too the medical ignorance. ''One
six-year-old was brought in with cigarette burns all over him. His
parents had done it to exorcise the TB. Then a helper put boiling water
on them with a rag. Dreadful!
''Another child had TB and meningitis of the spine and couldn't stand.
You go to hug these children and find a bony shell of a body and the
smell of TB. But they still smile; they are lovely kids.
''There's plenty of genuine sand on the paintings! The fundamentalists
are fairly strident. At first even some children threw stones. If I'd
gone out alone before being introduced to the village elders I'd have
been torn apart.
''I'm not a studio painter. I wish I was. I like improvising; a game
of chance; the immediacy of something caught on the wing. I wait for
hours for that bit of magic. It's like fishing! I need to be in a
situation -- in a hospital or out in the desert -- for the painting to
work. It doesn't necessarily make me a better artist. I wish I could
paint slowly -- but you can only be yourself.''
We are sitting in her drawing-room. Rather I am sitting; she is a
tornado of energy, dispensing food and drink. Sandy-haired, tall, thin,
wiry, witty, she exudes action and affection; juggling career and
family.
She and her home help struggle manfully with loads of visitors, dozens
of rooms, open fires, four staircases, three children aged six to 14,
two cats and a dog. The drawing-room table was recently sold to Adam
Tatum of U2 to help pay the bills.
One of six and determined to travel, she studied first in Dublin, then
from 1972-7 in London, latterly at Chelsea School of Art, before going
to live in Madrid and Paris. Her marriage put paid to the freedom, but
like most women she would not have it otherwise.
''I do sometimes feel pulled in two. Now I'm in my forties I wish I
could focus my life better instead of running round like a headless
chicken trying to do everything at once. Even my studio is still in the
barn at our old farm.''
Despite this she exhibits a great deal, in London, the US, Brussels,
Zurich; sells well, and has done several public commissions for Dublin.
Happily she has a very supportive husband. ''Elizabeth needed to go to
Somalia, so go she must'', says Geoffrey Cope.
During my visit her study was awash with Somalian paintings pinned up
in layers: a sea of camels captured in vivid outline by the River Unsi,
tents amid red sand, a lion skin hung out to dry in Jadendowa, and many
intimate sketches of women and children: bony, wide-eyed, and beautiful.
''The nomads were so nice. Some fundamentalists wouldn't shake my hand
because I'm a woman -- so you gave them an elbow to shake!''
She lived on goat's meat. ''The day we had camel meat (it broke its
leg so they had to shoot it) I was ill so couldn't try it! The cattle
and goats are very healthy. Farmers are more inclined to feed and water
their cattle than people!
''Camels and diesel are most valuable; donkeys and women bottom of the
heap. Poor men have one wife and 12 children; if rich, more. Being
Muslim, men can have four wives. They don't count children under five;
so many die.''
During her first stay in 1994, she painted over 50 pictures. She
returned with more prepared canvas plus some presents: sewing needles
and thread, cotton bras (''I gave all mine away to the hospital typists
last time''), a small radio for one hospital, and spongy balls.
''But you're on dangerous ground. I almost caused a riot over a
football. I gave it to the children but youths ran off with it. Luckily
I had another. Yet thorns are everywhere, like steel spikes, and balls
puncture. I hope the spongy balls last longer. It's pitiful to see kids
with nothing to play with.''
Elizabeth Cope's exhibition of Somali pictures is in Dublin from March
20. After that it's planned to tour a show of work by Peter Howson,
Elizabeth Cope, and Iain McColl (who accompanied Howson to Bosnia). ''It
will be the first time three war artists have ever shown together. We
all have a very different approach to human suffering, but as Iain says,
'anguish, fear, aggression, and compassion are common to both sides'.''

<HEADLINE>Kwik-Fit expands into car insurance</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>21</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979353741</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
KWIK-FIT will announce in about two weeks time that it is going ahead
with its long awaited diversification into car insurance. Initially it
will create about 100 jobs at Tannochside Park, Lanarkshire, on the site
of an old Caterpillar factory.
Chairman Tom Farmer emphasised that Kwik-Fit is not going to be an
insurance company as such.
''Just because we sell tyres, it does not mean that we are a tyre
manufacturer,'' he said.
Instead, the company will exploit its brand name through four million
customers a year going through its depots to act as a broker for
insurance companies whose identity will be made known when the formal
go-ahead is announced.
He has been impressed by the shake-up of the insurance industry,
particularly by Direct Line, and reckons the Kwik-Fit brand name is such
that it will prove a powerful marketing tool.
The traditional business increased profit in the year to February by
15% to #29.3m -- it is the fastest reporting company in Britain with
audited results in 16 days after the reporting period.
These figures include a net #3.6m (#4.1m) contribution largely from
property sales so that the continuing operations improved 18.6% before
accounting for the #21.5m acquisition of the net 80 strong Superdrive
depots from Shell in October. That brought Kwik-Fit more into the south
of England and helped increase retail depot numbers by 100 to 726.
Superdrive made a #700,000 initial loss but should be contributing
positively to group profits by June. In addition to the Dutch
operations, which increased their profits by 46% to #6.4m, the company
is looking at expansion into Scandinavia. France and Germany, two of
Europe's biggest markets, appear to be a long way down the list.
In the UK, the biggest improvement in turnover came from the brakes
testing and replacement operations although that is a comparatively new
activity.
There was some improvement in tyres with the Centaur house brand
increasing its proportion of sales while manufacturers' price rises.
Exhausts remain relatively quiet but there should be an ratchet upward
when the higher value and margin catalytic exhausts begin to need
renewal. Total net investment was #36.5m but debt is a negligible #2.2m.
Sales in the last couple of weeks have been at record levels for no
apparent reason and sufficient to set Kwik-Fit off with a good start to
the current year. Ignoring asset sales, profits should reach #32m which
would leave the shares at 145p trading at under 12 times possible
earnings -- a little on the cheap side.
The dividend total has been boosted 16% to 4.4p with a 2.7p final for
a 3.8% yield.

Ross Finlay finds the sting in the front
PRECISELY how the new Ford Scorpio ended up looking the way it does, I
have no idea. Thinking about members of the styling team as being like
the nodders and yessers in P.G. Wodehouse's stories about a megalomaniac
Hollywood film mogul is no doubt unfair.
But it is possible that, because the idea of the front-end appearance
with its odd but advanced-type poly-ellipsoidal headlights, and ugly
grille, came from the top of the styling department, people farther down
the hierarchy tended to shut up instead of saying, ''are we sure this is
quite right?''
Anyway, here is Ford's re-worked executive saloon, also available in
estate car form to give the full Scorpio range no fewer than 26 separate
catalogued variants. At least with the saloon, the problem is that the
front end bears no logical relationship to the rest of the car, which is
otherwise an impressive looking vehicle.
Scorpio saloons come at prices from #16,600 to #26,275. The
entry-level engine is a 115bhp two-litre. Then comes a 136bhp
modification of the same unit, followed by two versions of the familiar
2.9-litre v6. These engines -- a 12-valve producing 15 0bhp and a
four-cam 24-valve whose power is boosted to no less than 210bhp -- are
assembled and, in the latter's case, tuned by Cosworth.
There is also a 2.5-litre turbo diesel which matches the entry-level
petrol car's 115bhp, but obviously has much stronger torque. In fact, it
has almost as much torque as the 24-valve Cosworth job, but at less than
half the revs.
The cars come with rising levels of equipment and trim standards
called Executive, Ghia and Ultima. When you consider that Ghia is
usually Ford's top level, the Ultima specification ought to be really
something, and it certainly is. But one particularly important feature
of the Scorpio is that it knocks most of its direct rivals into a cocked
hat in the matter of passenger space.
The rear cabin is a comfortable lounge, and that is a serious
consideration in any car which is really meant to be for executives, and
not just given that tag as a kind of kid-on.
The new fascia is a great improvement, the wood-effect facings are
reasonable, while front and rear seat passengers are given really good
support. To items like cruise control, air conditioning and memory
settings for both driver's seat and door mirrors, which are options
elsewhere in the range, but standard on the ultima, the top model adds
still more extra-cost possibilities, including that ''ruched'' leather
door trim.
Ford has done a lot of work, on projects like the Mondeo and the 1995
Escort, to cut down noise levels. The Ultima I tried was certainly far
quieter than any earlier Granada or Scorpio, especially in terms of
mechanical noise.
In matters of handling and ride the previous car was letting the
opposition romp by. Without having the time or budget for a complete
re-design, the Scorpio team have made dozens of suspension and steering
modifications. The cumulative result is a car which feels much more
comfortable on the kind of surfaces over which the old one used to
jitter, has noticeably less body roll and, while never being intended as
any kind of sports saloon, handles more securely overall.

MOTHERWELL BRIDGE, Scotland's largest private engineering group, has
won two major export orders in Russia and India against strong
international competition.
The Russian order is an engineering and project management contract
for a new petroleum products export terminal near St Petersburg in the
Gulf of Finland.
The order involves design and infrastructure work in co-operation with
a number of Russian design institutes. No value has been disclosed. The
Indian order, a turnkey contract for an ethylene storage system at the
Gandhar complex in Gujarat state, 200 miles north of Bombay, is worth
#20m.
Motherwell Bridge yesterday said it will have to increase its
technical team over a variety of disciplines to complete the work. ''We
are particularly pleased because we have been pursuing these contracts
for some time against strong international competition,'' said group
chief executive John Lumsden.

I AM convinced of Brian Wilson's good faith when he states ''I would
also hope and expect that the Labour Government of 96 and 97 is more
self confident and less in awe of the Sir Humphreys than any that has
gone before; and its determination to achieve will have been sharpened
by the long wait'' (March 10).
Unwittingly here we have a perfect example of the deep crisis in
parliamentary democracy as we approach the twenty-first century --
honourable Members' virtual blindness to their growing impotence.
Deregulation of the money markets and the communications revolution
have greatly undermined the influence Governments once had. Professor
Paul Kennedy at Yale summarises the new reaility of ''a fast-moving,
26-hour-a-day, border-crossing, profit-hunting system of international
finance in which vast sums of capital move in and out of a country''
according to their ability to make profit.
Should any prospective Government offend these new masters, capital
simply ups and goes in a twinkle of a stockbroker's eye.
All of which leads to Brian Wilson's repetition of Tony Blair's
challenge ''to say what we mean and mean what we say''. Let's examine
this.
In the document, Socialist values in a modern world, which led to the
current Clause 4 debate, Mr Blair writes, ''Democracy means the rule by
the people so that every institution in our society and economy is
accountable to those who it serves''.
Here he highlights the fundamental question of economic democracy. But
the central thrust of the whole document is to accept the logic of the
market, which by its very nature is beyond accountability. He can't have
it both ways.
In fairness it also draws attention to the role of public ownership.
But how seriously can we take this when he can't even commit himself to
renovating the railways should this be necessary?
The truth is that language has once again been kidnapped by
politicians. There is nothing modernising about the new Labour Party. It
is simply joining the neo-liberal bandwagon.
Two weeks ago the International Labour Organisation report highlighted
a third of the world's workers of 820,000,000 people as under-employed.
All around us is urgent work -- 12,000,000 people die every year from
preventable diseases.
The logic of the market is a total catastrophe for human beings. The
missing link to unite people to work is indeed the democratic control of
resources. Sadly, it is not even on the agenda.
The enemy to social justice is not some avuncular civil servant, but
the immense over-riding power of a new global market economy premised on
the pursuit of private profit. No wonder the City is now embracing the
''new'' Labour party while laughing up its sleeve.
Paul Laverty,

THE piper ordered by Lord Lovat to lead British commandos into battle
on D-Day, last night paid tribute to the ''eccentric aristocrat'' with
tremendous courage.
Lord Lovat's insistence, against all directives, that his personal
piper Bill Millin should accompany him on the landings 51 years ago is
now legendary.
A proud Scot and commander of the 1st Special Service (Commando)
Brigade, Lord Lovat ordered Mr Millin to play Highland Laddie, Blue
Bonnets over the Border, and Road to the Isles, as the highly-trained
commandos stormed their way past the German shoreline defences.
A few miles away, Major John Howard and his paratroopers holding on to
Pegasus Bridge knew reinforcements would soon be there when they heard
the skirl of the pipes.
The bridge over the Orne Canal was under heavy fire, but there was no
doubt in Lord Lovat's mind about the next move. ''He told us to walk
over -- not rush,'' said Mr Millin. ''Just before we got to the other
side, he asked me to start playing again and to keep on playing right
across the next bridge, over the River Orne.''
A week later the war ended for Lord Lovat when he was severely
wounded. ''He was a very brave chap, a good leader who led from the
front,'' said Mr Millin, of Dawlish, Devon.

GAVIN Hastings aims to celebrate his farewell appearance at Twickenham
in style.
The Scotland captain, who tomorrow wins his fifty-sixth cap, and leads
Scotland for the fifteenth time, will make a decision on his future
after the World Cup this summer, but he conceded yesterday that this is
almost certainly his last visit to the citadel of English rugby.
But with the Grand Slam showdown looming over the horizon, retirement
plans were the last thing on his mind.
''After the World Cup in South Africa, I will sit down and take stock.
I'm enjoying my rugby just now. It's magic, isn't it. I've been totally
caught up in the Five Nations' Championship and that is the only thing
on my mind.
''I don't want to be worrying just now about when I'm going to retire
and, with this huge game just around the corner, that is the only thing
on which I'm focusing,'' he said.
Hastings, who requires only three points tomorrow to break his own
Scottish record of 52 in a season, is unwilling to make any rash
predictions on the outcome of tomorrow's encounter with the Auld Enemy.
''I honestly don't know who is going to win. All that we can do is to
put in the preparation which would allow us to get a victory, and I can
assure you that we have done that.
''We all recognise that only two Scottish teams have won at Twickenham
since the war and so let's not get carried away. We are aware of the
enormity of the task which awaits us. That doesn't mean that we don't
enter the game in a confident frame of mind.
''But we are being realistic and we realise that it will require a
tremendous effort from us all.''
Tomorrow's game is given added spice -- if such a thing were possible
-- because of the personal animosity which is said to exist between the
two captains.
Hastings and Will Carling have each, to a degree, had a ''pop'' at
each other in their respective autobiographies.
The English captain had been touted to skipper the 1993 British Lions
in New Zealand, a role which eventually went to Hastings.
Yesterday the Scotland captain sought to play down whatever bad blood
exists between himself and Carling.
He declared: ''It certainly won't be a motivating force for me on
Saturday. I think the relationship between me and Will is something that
the media have picked up on.
''It isn't something that is going to concern me on Saturday and I'm
sure that it won't concern Will either.
''We get on fine. We're not the best of buddies and nobody is trying
to suggest that for a moment, but neither are we constantly at each
other's throats in the way that some people are suggesting.''
Last year at Murrayfield, after Jon Callard's dying second penalty
goal handed England a single-point victory, Hastings broke down in tears
on nationwide television.
Yesterday he said that the emotional stress he had suffered after
Callard's hammer blow would not cloud his thoughts in tomorrow's
Calcutta Cup re-run.
''It wasn't because it was England we were playing or anything like
that.''
Yesterday Hastings was unwilling to concede that win, lose, or draw
tomorrow, his rejuvenated side had already experienced a momentous
season.
''Now is not the time for looking back. Today is a time for looking
forward. We have one game to go in the Five Nations and we haven't won
anything yet. The time to talk about how well we have done in the
tournament is Sunday, not today.
''It's Saturday's game which matters now. Our wins in the previous
three games have just enabled us to get to this stage with this greatest
of all prizes at stake.
''But it has been great. I've said to the guys that I want to see
smiles on all of their faces. I've told them to enjoy the game and to
enjoy the whole weekend. It's magic and I'm certainly going to enjoy
it.''

WILL Carling yesterday looked forward to Saturday's Five Nations'
Championship decider against Scotland and predicted: ''If we play to our
potential we will win the game and the title.''
England captain Carling is still smarting from the 1990 defeat at
Murrayfield, when the Scots upset the odds to clinch the Grand Slam. But
he is confident this England side can succeed where their predecessors
failed.
''We still believe that we were good enough in 1990 to win that match,
but Scotland ended up with the Grand Slam,'' said Carling.
''This time, manager Jack Rowell says that we have to be big enough
mentally to take on the mantle of being favourites, and I am confident
that we are strong and ruthless enough to take the Grand Slam.''
Carling believes having the home backing of a sell-out Twickenham
crowd will play an important factor and said: ''We have come a long way
since 1990, but the difference between our struggles at Murrayfield five
years ago and last season is that Scotland will not have the massive
emotional support -- not that matches are won on emotion. We are viewed
with some respect in world terms now.''
But he refuses to under-estimate the Scots and admitted: ''One of
their strengths this season is their collective desire. They are a young
side who have earned their inner confidence through their results.
''They have this desire to beat England, but our determination to beat
them is as fierce as theirs.
''They don't believe their down-playing publicity. They are doing lots
of things right. That is obvious after they won in Paris and comfortably
defeated Wales.''
Carling will facing Gavin Hastings for the first time since the
Scotland captain made a dismissive reference about his participation on
the British Lions tour two years ago in his autobiography.
Nevertheless, Carling wrote to Hastings congratulating him on his
Lions' tour -- but received no reply.
''Gavin is a slow writer,'' explained Carling. ''What he said about me
was unfair, but it is no major problem. I have no axe to grind. We will
be having a few beers after the match.''

GOALKEEPERS Hans Segers and Bruce Grobbelaar both have the full
backing of their clubs and an official go-ahead from the FA -- but only
one of them will be turning out tomorrow.
Wimbledon's support for Segers will not extend to offering him his
place back in the first team.
And with Aston Villa's John Fashanu injured, of the three players
arrested by police on Tuesday, only Grobbelaar of Southampton is
expected to play tomorrow.
Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear maintained that Segers' continued
demotion had not been brought about by pressure. Segers, welcomed back
at training yesterday after having been released from a police inquiry
into match-fixing allegations, will continue to cover for his deputy of
the past six years, Neil Sullivan, against Crystal Palace.
Kinnear, who left out Segers last Saturday, said: ''It's a tactical
situation and an opportunity for the young kid to come in and do well.''
Giving the go-ahead for the players to return, FA chief executive
Graham Kelly told BBC Radio Five Live: ''They are free to play. There
are no powers under football rules that could prevent them from playing,
and I'm not so sure that there should be.''
Earlier, Southampton director of football, Lawrie McMenemy, said his
club would continue to back Grobbelaar.
Sullivan steps up after Segers missed only his fourth League game in
five years at Sheffield Wednesday last Saturday.
Kinnear said: ''I spoke to Hans at great length last night and it was
he who wanted to come in for training, like the good professional he is.
But I feel for him and his family.''
Segers himself said: ''I'm innocent -- that's what I've said all
along.''

TRACEY Craik, a former Scottish girls champion, did well in the third
round of the American Express Tour qualifying school at La Manga, Spain,
yesterday.
She battled through strong winds for a round of 73, leaving her on
16-over-par 231. She now is in the leading 45 in the event but only the
top-40 will earn their cards after today's final round.
Alongside Craik is Lindsey Irvine, making her debut as a professional.
She returned a 78 despite dropping four shots in three late holes.
But Jill Kinloch, the other Scottish player in the field, completed a
79, leaving her three strokes behind Craik and Irvine with a big hill to
climb.

ADAM Hunter, who missed the cut four times in his first five
tournaments of this season but rediscovered his form to finish equal
seventh in Morocco, yesterday was the most successful among the Scottish
contingent in defying the stormiest weather experienced for some years
on the European Tour for a score of 73, one over par, in the severely
disrupted first round of the Portuguese Open at Penha Longa.
But Sam Torrance, who correctly returned a 75, in which he dropped
four strokes over the last three holes, was subsequently disqualified
for having signed for a 4 at the fourteenth, where in fact he took 5,
confusing the figure with that at the tenth, where he took 4 but signed
for a 5, not a penal offence. Torrance blamed no-one but himself for the
mistake.
Hunter, the 31-year-old Glasgow-born professional, took almost nine
hours from his first shot to his last as a biting north wind, gusting up
to 40mph, caused balls to oscillate and even move position on the most
exposed of the greens. Play was suspended from 10.20am and resumed only
at 2pm.
The interruption was called by tournament director Andy McFee.
''Conditions on the fourth green, the highest point on the course, were
the catalyst,'' he explained. ''Play was just possible at 8am, but
eventually crossed the limit of acceptability.''
Steve Richardson, the 1991 winner, also was disqualified when he
failed to meet his starting time, despite the 40-minute warning McFee
gave. ''I was in my hotel at a business meeting,'' the Ryder Cup player
confessed.
Concentration, patience, and composure were stretched to their limits
but worse things happen at sea. Hunter is still working on swing changes
recommended by the renowned coach, David Leadbetter, during a week's
visit to Florida last November, but it was Hunter's short game,
particularly his holing out, which helped him negotiate the exacting
7000-yard course.
Using a mallet-headed club disarmingly called The Fat Lady Swings,
Hunter had only 29 putts, including five singles. He also holed a
45-foot chip for the first of three birdies, at the short fourth, where
he had resumed after the break, and survived with a bogey, the rare
penalty of an unplayable lie in a bunker at the short seventh, where his
tee-shot bunkered under the lip.
The protracted nature of the day undermined many scores as tempers and
temperament wilted towards the end. Andrew Coltart, out in a respectable
37, one over, was more than holding his own when he faced the last six
holes, almost all directly into the gale. Then, having taken three putts
from three feet at the fourteenth, Coltart incurred a two-stroke penalty
at the short seventeeth after he and one of his partners, the Australian
Mike Harwood, had played each other's ball when left with chip shots
from below the green.
Oddly, Gordon Brand Jr, who three-putted three times and four-putted
once, contradicted the pattern. Five over with three to play, Brand, no
stranger to playing well in adverse conditions, holed from 15 feet to
save par after a bunkered tee-shot at the seventeenth and pitched to
four feet at the last for his fourth birdie.
Just before play ended Yorkshire's Gordon J Brand also was
disqualified for signing for a wrong score. His 84 was the worst of the
day, but he then realised it was even worse because a penalty at the
final hole had not been added to his card.
At the end of a disjointed day the only player to have completed 18
holes in under par was the Australian Wayne Riley, who had a 71. When
play was halted for failing light more than half the field were left on
the course to resume their rounds today, when the forecast is for
similar conditions.

TRAINER Kim Bailey and his jockey Norman Williamson earned a place in
racing's record books yesterday when Master Oats found a crock of gold
under the rainbow by winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
The gelding's 15-lengths defeat of Dubacilla with Miinnehoma in third
place brought Bailey and Williamson a championship double -- they won
the Champion Hurdle with Alderbrook -- last achieved 45 years ago by
Vincent O'Brien and Aubrey Brabazon.
Bailey and Williamson, who before this week had never tasted
Cheltenham Festival success, have a long way to go before they match
O'Brien's 23 victories at the meeting. But they deserved their moment of
glory as Master Oats confirmed his rise from handicap chaser to champion
of his division.
''I can't believe what has happened,'' said Bailey. ''We haven't come
to Cheltenham with huge hopes before. But Master Oats and Alderbrook
came with every chance in the world and have done it.
''I expected to be standing outside the winners enclosure reflecting
that another year had gone by. But Master Oats is a very good horse. He
has improved unbelievably since the beginning of last season.
''I backed Alderbrook and Master Oats both at 50-1. I am not telling
you how much I have won but it will pay for a new hostel for the lads
next season.''
Master Oats ploughed through four fences during yesterday's big race,
but he was on the bridle with eight fences to jump. From there on it was
his rivals who, one by one, dropped out of contention.
Jodami, winner two years ago, made several mistakes and finished the
race in some distress. ''I didn't think he was quite right behind,''
said jockey Mark Dwyer. ''He was never travelling or jumping well. I
should have pulled him up before the last but we were in fourth spot
then.''
Meanwhile, Williamson was already celebrating, crowning his hero's
welcome with a flying leap out of the saddle. ''This is what I have
dreamt of all my life. It's a tremendous feeling. I can't believe it,''
he said.
Trainer Martin Pipe's Festival was saved from disaster when Kissair
landed the Triumph Hurdle at 16-1.

Florida
THOUGH the Nestle Invitational this week offered a showcase for the
best international golfers, it was the Americans who dominated the
first-round leaderboard. There were just two non-Americans who broke 70
yesterday, both members of the US tour -- Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, who
shot 67, and Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty, with a 68 yesterday.
The lead was held by Texas golfer Mark Brooks, who shot a 30 on Bay
Hill's back nine to finish at seven-under-par 65. Two strokes behind
were Parnevik, Billy Andrade, Rick Fehr, and Steve Stricker. The group
tied one stroke further back was more distinguished -- McNulty, Fred
Couples, Fuzzy Zoeller, Loren Roberts, and John Daly.
Aside from Parnevik, three other Europeans broke par, Nick Faldo, Ian
Woosnam, and Bernhard Langer all shooting 71.
Faldo said later that he hit a lot of good putts that finished very
close without actually dropping into the hole, but he was troubled by
the fact that he kept pushing his drives.
Colin Montgomerie made a brief appearance among the leaders after
three straight birdies from the sixth to get to three under for the
tournament. After that he would hit just one fairway, and that one not
by much.
He said afterwards: ''Pathetic. That's the general comment on that
round of golf. I just frittered it away. I haven't made a cut here in
three years, this is No.4 and I'm struggling already. Pathetic.''
The two Spaniards, Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal, as well
as Scot Sandy Lyle, all finished on 75.
For Parnevik, this is his best round of the year. Part of the reason,
he explained, was that he was first alternate into this tournament and
found out he was in on Monday night.
''This is like a bonus week for me. I'm a bit more relaxed, I guess,
and not trying to force things to happen the way I have been this
year.''
Part of the reason for Parnevik's urgency this year is that winning an
American tournament is the only way he can get into the Masters.
Leading first-round scores (American unless stated):
65 -- M Brooks.
67 -- J Parnevik (Sweden), R Fehr, S Stricker, B Andrade.
68 -- J Daly, F Zoeller, F Couples, L Roberts, M McNulty (Zimbabwe).
69 -- B Lohr, P Stewart, M McCumber, B Faxon, M Heinen, B Glasson, D
Love III.
70 -- P Jacobsen, T Lehman, D Edwards, D Forsman, J Gallagher, S
Simpson, M O'Meara, L Nelson, F Funk.
70 -- P Jacobsen, T Lehman, D Edwards, D Forsman, J Gallagher, S
Simpson, M O'Meara, L Nelson.
Other scores included:
71 -- N Faldo (England), I Woosnam (Wales), B Langer (Germany).
73 -- C Montgomerie (Scotland).
75 -- S Ballesteros (Spain), J M Olazabal (Spain), S Lyle (Scotland).
SCOTT Renfrew, of West Kilbride, was last night presented with the
Stewart Thom Scottish Trainee of the Year award at the PGA dinner in
Glasgow.
The 26-year-old, who finished top in Scotland's assistant trainee
scheme, also finished second overall in Britain. He was presented with a
cheque for #500, as was runner-up Barry Wortley, of Turnberry Hotel.

WE Scots are often accused of a tartan mentality, a kind of haggis and
pipes projection which disguises an inferiority complex.
Our defence is that we think Scotland is great, except maybe when
compared with anywhere else.
Yet, in football terms, while we are inclined to denigrate our own
lot, even when they are not so bad, we are inclined to be far more
appreciative of the game itself than many other countries where the
patriotism factor determines the interest.
That point was never better illustrated than by this week's television
coverage of the European games, when the English ITV regions presented
live pictures of two European games involving English teams on Tuesday
and Thursday, but did not cover the Paris St Germain v Barcelona
European Cup quarter-final on Wednesday.
Scottish Television not only took in the English games, which involved
Chelsea and Arsenal, but cleared the programme schedule for the European
Cup tie. They were rewarded with a wonderful game which must have
thrilled the audience. According to Gerry McNee, the Scottish Television
Sports Editor, that was 708,000, a share of 49% of the audience in the
Central Region, an amazing ratio.
McNee pointed out that per head of population, Scots not only watch
European football in greater numbers than their counterparts in England,
but for the Coca-Cola Cup tie between Manchester United and Sheffield
Wednesday, there were more Scottish viewers pro rata than English.
Scottish also achieved the remarkable feat of having News At Ten
shifted to accommodate their broadcast.
The point of it all is that Scots enjoy good football, whoever is
playing, and are not quite as obsessively introspective as some would
have us believe. The English ITV regions clearly judged that the
majority of their football loving viewers are only really motivated by
partisan entertainment and will prefer to watch a film about fear of
spiders, as they were offered on Wednesday night.
It is confirmation of an aspect of southern life which has long
annoyed some Scottish exiles who have to work hard to unearth news in
the press of football events back home. Maybe we should not be surprised
at this, since the most revered game ever played in Scotland is the Real
Madrid-Eintracht European Cup final at Hampden in 1960.
The most adored contest in England is the World Cup final win for Sir
Alf Ramsey's team in 1966. Perhaps they would say that, if we won the
World Cup, we would be the same, but the facts seem to suggest that
there are more real lovers of the old ball game north of the Border.
They were well pleased with what they saw on Wednesday in the Parc des
Princes stadium, when St Germain and Barcelona served up a memorable
contest. It was worth the effort of Scottish Television just to let us
see George Weah again. If there is a better player currently treading
the European stage, I can't wait to see him.
The Liberian, who loves America with a passion, has so many talents
that he comes very close to being the perfect footballer. If only he was
Scottish . . . but that would be chauvinistic. We are not like that.
* IT has been a good week for televised sport. Channel Four, whom so
many were waiting to criticise after they usurped the Cheltenham
Festival from BBC, has covered the meeting in admirable style. No-one
can supplant the velvet tones of Peter O'Sullevan, of course, but in
overall presentation and detail, the racing team from the fourth channel
have done a fine job.
Few of us will be any richer for the experience, but maybe a bit
wiser. Then again, maybe not.

ONE of the most nostalgic memories of the early days of men's indoor
hockey in Scotland was the 1976 final of the club championship when a
little 12-year-old, John Christie, made his debut for Menzieshill late
in the game against MIM.
At that stage, MIM were coasting to the fourth of their 14 successive
championship triumphs. Many, myself included, thought Christie's
presence was just a gimmick by the Dundee men, but we were soon to think
otherwise as the youngster caught the imagination of the Meadowbank
crowd with his trickery and skill.
Indeed, he went on to hit the target with a penalty. Unfortunately
that memory has a sad ending, for the umpire on that occasion, the late
David Simpson, disallowed the ''goal'' on a techinical point.
Christie has since gone on to become one of the finest indoor players
in the world. The sport has not produced a similar charismatic player
since, but judging by the depth of talent involved at the finals
recently of the Strathclyde branch of the National Playing Fields Indoor
Cup at Wishaw, that situation could be about to come to an end.
On view were a number of young players in the under-16 final who
looked as though they should have been wrapped up in bed when the game
got underway at around 10pm. But there was no doubting their ability.
In the match between Stepps and Dalziel High School, one young player
in particular caught the eye -- Dougie Simpson. He, too, possesses all
the hallmarks of a rare talent not just with his skill and technical
knowhow, but also with his confidence.
The 4ft 10in slip of a lad showed no inhibitions in taking on much
older and more mature opponents. Then, with five minutes of the match
remaining, and the teams level at 4-4 in an engrossing contest, the
youngster, who occasionally turns out for Stepps 3rd XI, made a further
impact.
He shot Stepps into the lead, had a hand in another goal, and then
brought the curtain down on an unforgettable evening by scoring the
concluding goal in his side's 7-4 victory.
On the night, there were no losers. Hockey was a clear winner, but the
encouraging news for the sport is, according to Gerry Ralph, chairman of
the Scottish Youth Board: ''It's fair to say that most clubs have
players of a similar potential to that of young Dougie.''
Indeed, at all youth levels, the news is that the standards are on an
upward spiral with Ralph also claiming: ''The current 12-year-olds now
possess a skill level which the under-16s had about five years ago.''
This is also borne out by Brian McCartney, the under-16s' coach who
boasts: ''All my players are now involved in senior hockey. Most of them
are in their club's first elevens.
Gavin Fraser, the coach of the under-18s, also has the satisfaction of
seeing most of his squad playing in the first division. He also derives
pleasure from the fact that ''six of my squad have actually been
approached to join the under-21 training squad.''
The face of men's hockey in Scotland has obviously undergone massive
surgery in the past few years, but if the mould is now set to produce
more players of the skill and ability of John Christie, then Scotland's
results on the international arena hopefully will soon encounter a
massive change for the better.

DUNDEE'S push for Scottish League reconstruction is running out of
steam and the club conceded last night that they need quick answers from
21 clubs if change is to be accepted and put in place in time for next
season.
The first-division side last week wrote to every club, apart from
associate members Ross County and Caley Thistle, with the aim of
gathering enough support to call an extraordinary general meeting of the
League.
The idea is to discuss a new system based on a 16-club top division,
but there would be little point in continuing if too few are of a mind
to alter the current structure. A meeting was held in Edinburgh last
Friday, when reconstruction was on the agenda, and only six clubs were
represented, which suggests a degree of apathy.
Only yesterday Rangers manager David Murray was quoted as saying
Scottish football would be considered a laughing stock if change was
made so quickly after only one season of four divisions. It is also
believed Celtic are against change, and without the Old Firm's backing,
change would be practically impossible.
Dundee claim they were encouraged by initial reaction to their note,
but managing director Nigel Squire admitted last night: ''I was sure
after the first couple of days that we would amass the 59 votes we
require to call the egm and discuss the reconstruction issue. But the
mail has dried up and I hope the clubs will be in touch soon, because a
meeting would have to be held by the end of this month in order for a
change to be implemented next season.
''We believe a change is urgently needed for the good of the game and
I hope we don't discover later that other people with the same idea have
simply neglected to reply.''
So far Dundee can muster 13 positive responses, including five
premier-division clubs, worth a total of 39 votes. Three clubs, one
premier division club included, have said no, and one other has
indicated they are as yet undecided.
It is peculiar that the Dens Park side should be so anxious for
change, because they were one of the clubs in favour of the current
set-up.
* SCOTLAND have avoided Brazil in the Toulon Under-21 International
Tournament, which will be played in June. The young Scots have been
drawn in the same group as host nation France, Mexico, and South Korea.
If they qualify, the earliest they can meet the Brazilians would be in
the semi-finals.
Scotland Under-21 manager Tommy Craig, whose side open their campaign
against Mexico on June 5, said: ''It looks like being another first-rate
event to groom our youngsters.''
''We have come up against Mexico before and they are very physical
with a question mark over their temperament. France invariably have a
quality team and it will be a high-profile match played before a big
crowd. ''South Korea should be a breath of fresh air after the very
positive showing from their senior side in the last World Cup. It should
be an open game for everyone to enjoy.  ''We are fortunate that the
nucleus of last year's side is still available. My squad will be formed
around these players with one or two additions from in-form players.''
England, the holders, have been drawn with Brazil, Malaysia, and
Angola in the other group in what has become one of the most prestigious
tournaments of it's type.

THEY CAME, they saw, they bought some of the line drawings. More than
5000 people paid a visit to the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock where
artists Peter Howson and Iain McColl staged an exhibit of war work from
Bosnia.
But no-one, as yet, has paid out the #18,000 needed to buy one of
Howson's mighty oil paintings. A number of corporate buyers have been
scouting around but have yet to make a move.
David Bett, the institute's arts and museum development officer said
the it had purchased a number of drawings from both artists, and members
of the public had snapped up several prints and pastel drawings priced
at around #250.
Bett said the show had been well-received despite its often
gut-wrenching imagery and there had been no complaints about the works
on display. ''Yes, the subject matter is quite violent, but both artists
can sometimes combine both softness and violence in their work.''
The exhibition, which contains more than 80 works and 12 large oils,
closed on March 4, and it will now tour round the UK and overseas in the
coming months, with the first date at Dundee Art Gallery on Monday.
Howson, the official UK war artist to Bosnia, had proposed a joint
show with McColl who had accompanied him through the horrors of Bosnia
with a video camera.

IT doesn't rain but it pours, it would seem these days, for Heriot
Watt University's Scottish international Susan Gilmour, who was
red-carded earlier this month against Liverpool in the British
Universities Championship, writes Joseph Dillon.
Her misdemeanour brought an automatic two-match suspension, but as she
also picked up a yellow card in that game, it took her over the points
limit, sidelining her for four games.
The absense from the students' attack of Gilmour will come as a
serious blow to the club. They are averaging only a goal a game in the
league this season, and they could yet be sucked into the play-off
scenario unless some of their junior internationalists take on greater
responsibility.
The students have two engagements this weekend and face unenviable
assignments -- taking on the top two sides in the country.
Defending champion Western Klick Photopoint are their opponents
tomorrow in the Torrie Stockbrokers National League, while Edinburgh
Ladies are also likely to punish their defence 24 hours later when they
clash in the League Cup.
Bottom club Grange are also likely to have their backs to the wall
against Bonagrass Grove but in the match of the day tomorrow, Hyndland
should get the verdict in their confrontation with Boroughmuir.

HEARTS manager Tommy McLean announced yesterday that he will not allow
himself to be considered a candidate for the vacant job at Tannadice,
where his brother, Jim, is chairman.
Speculation has mounted since the departure of Ivan Golac this week.
But yesterday, in a brief statement, the Hearts manager said: ''I feel
it is important to make it clear, especially to the Hearts supporters
who have been very supportive towards me, that I am not a candidate for
that vacancy.''
Leslie Deans, Hearts' next chairman, said: ''This is tremendous news
for all of us at Tynecastle. We hope that Tommy will be in charge of
Hearts for a very long time.''
That still remains in some doubt. McLean has been scarred by his
experiences at Motherwell, where he built a team to win the Scottish Cup
and march into Europe, and then was frustrated by directors who would
not allow him the cash to take another step onwards.
He does not wish to put himself through the same troubles at
Tynecastle.  He needs guarantees from his directors of financial
support, otherwise he might walk away at the end of the season and leave
football altogether.
* HEARTS fans attending tomorrow's match with Rangers at Tynecastle
will be given priority for the Scottish Cup semi-final tie with Airdrie
on April 8. Hearts still have around 2000 tickets left for home
supporters for tomorrow's match.
* MOTHERWELL manager Alex McLeish has targeted on-loan Ajax striker
Donny Huysen, and will watch the 23-year-old play for Haarlem at Zwolle
tonight. He could make a move before the transfer deadline on March 31.
* THE league play-offs scheduled to take place at the end of the
season have been put back by one day. The League management committee
have amended the dates to Sunday, May 21, and Thursday, May 25, as the
original dates clashed with the BFA Cup Final and European Cup Final
respectively.
* RANGERS and Celtic will meet on Sunday, March 19, in the opening
game of this season's Glasgow Cup tournament.
Since the competition switched to being played by the youth sides of
the five Glasgow clubs, Rangers, the present holders, have won it twice
and Celtic three times.
The final will be played at Hampden on Sunday, April 30, at 2pm.
Fixture list:
(Venue A -- Newlandsfield Park, Pollok. Venue B -- Petershill Park,
Springburn). All matches kick off at 2pm.
Sunday, March 19: A -- Rangers v Celtic.  B -- Queen's Park v Clyde.

Auxerre 0, Arsenal 1
(Agg: 1-2)
IAN Wright's strike after 16 minutes and a fine defensive display by
Arsenal enabled the London club to chase Chelsea into the semi-final
stage of the European Cup-winners' Cup in France last night.
Wright, dropped from the side last week, bounced back with a stunning
goal to give Arsenal a success few believed possible after they were
outplayed in a 1-1 stalemate at Highbury two weeks ago.
Auxerre defenders Franck Verlaat and Stephane Mahe collided as they
attempted to cut out a hopeful pass from Arsenal skipper Tony Adams.
Wright sent a left-foot shot that baffled keeper Fabien Cool as it
arced into a top corner.
But he was just one member of a team of heroes who all worked hard.
Wright maintained his run of scoring in every tie during the current
European campaign and he fully deserved his war dance of celebration at
the end.
However, Arsenal keeper David Seaman also deserves special mention,
playing as he was despite a cracked rib which was protected by
specially-designed strapping.
* ENGLAND midfielder David Platt was sent off as Sampdoria went
through to the semi-finals after a dramatic penalty shoot-out against
Bobby Robson's Porto.
Platt was dismissed in extra-time for a tackle from behind on
Trinidadian striker Russel Latapy. Sampdoria won 5-3 on penalties after
Roberto Mancini's goal wiped out Porto's first-leg lead.
In Spain, Real Zaragoza overturned a 1-0 deficit and beat Feyenoord of
Holland 2-0. Feyenoord's frustration boiled over in the closing minutes
and Peter Bosz and Jozsef Kiprich were sent off.

CRAIG Watkins, McMahon Kelburne's midfield driving force, has
announced that he will not be playing competitively again this season,
writes Joseph Dillon.
Watkins, a Scottish international and assistant coach of the national
under-21 squad, is severing all connections with the sport for the time
being.
Kelburne now have a problem. Apart from being six points off the pace
in the Torrie Stockbrokers National League, the Whitehaugh side will be
hosting the finals of the B division of the European club championship
in June and their prospects of success in both events must be reduced.
Watkins said yesterday: ''Commuting daily to work in Edinburgh and
trying to complete my thesis for my PhD degree means I am unable to make
the commitment to hockey which is now required to compete at the top
level.''
With Watkins absent, the pressure will now fall upon the young
shoulders of David Ralph, the former captain of the Scottish juniors.
The Loughbrough University student is back playing for the club after
having been deregistered by the English authorities when he turned out
for Kelburne during a holiday.
Kelburne have two games this weekend against Watsonians and Edinburgh
University and should pick up maximum points, as should pacesetters
Grange and MIM against Torbrex Wanderers and Insights Inverleith.

AMONG the 100 teams lining up today for the Vauxhall Rally of Wales
are seven Scottish drivers bidding for honours in this years Mobile
1/Top Gear British Championship.
The Chester-based event is the first of five rounds in the rejuvenated
series which has banned four-wheel drive, turbo- charged ''super cars''
in favour of conventional two-wheel drive, normally aspirated saloons
with engines under two litres -- a new category referred to as ''Formula
Two,'' and which has attracted seven vehicle manufacturers.
Alistair McRae of Lanark is driving a Nissan Sunny, while driving for
the French Renault team is Robbie Head from Ayr.
Castle Douglas driver Jock Armstrong debuts a Shell Scholarship Nissan
Sunny only a week after having won a Formula Two national rally in the
Lake District driving his own Peugeot 205.
Malloch Nicholl, from Dundee, driving a Ford Escort and Ayr's Tom
Coughtrie, in a Subaro Legacy, are both bidding to win the championships
in ''Production Cup,'' a category for amateur drivers.
In smaller car classes Richard More from Forfar (Astra) and Redmond
Barry from Auchterarder (Suzuki Swift) are both contenders for
championship titles.

CLIFF Thorburn claimed a third top-16 victim to reach his first major
semi-final for five years in the Kloster Thailand Open at Bangkok's
Imperial Queens Park Hotel last night.
The Canadian defeated Tony Drago 5-4 in a match lasting more than four
hours and today tackles the favourite, Ronnie O'Sullivan, for a place in
the final.
Thorburn scraped through on the pink following a 51-minute deciding
frame. He had held the lead until Drago won three frames in a row to
force the decider.
But Thorburn felt his game was never quite as sharp as it was when he
beat Steve Davis, the world No.2, in the previous round.
''I felt a little flat at the start,'' said Thorburn, who is currently
ranked No.54. ''It was nothing like as tense as I was against Steve. I
played much better in that match, but at the same time, Tony was as big
a threat. I have great admiration for him, I'm sure he will stay in the
top 16 for a long time.''
Thorburn, who had beaten world No.12 Joe Swail in the first round,
compiled breaks of 46, 40 (twice), and 36. ''I didn't score heavily and
I know I will have to against Ronnie. That's a match I'm really looking
forward to.''
Drago, the world No.16, fired in the highest break of the match, a 72
in frame six.
James Wattana, the holder, completed a 5-0 victory over Gary Wilkinson
with breaks of 67 and 76.
Wattana, who plays Mark Johnston-Allen for a place in the final, had
clinched a 52-minute opening frame on the pink. A tactical battle
followed, but the crucial frame was the third, which Wilkinson again
lost on the pink after a poor safety shot had let in Wattana.

WHAT a pity that a man of Brian Wilson's undoubted abilities should
discredit himself by perpetuating the Labour Party myth that ''Labour
alone'' has given the nation great social legislation such as the NHS
and the welfare state (March 10).
The reality is that the post-war reforms introduced by the Attlee
Government were part of the Keynesian package designed to save
capitalism from the ruin it had faced in the 1930s. They had nothing to
do with socialism and would have been introduced regardless of who won
the 1945 election.
As for the idea that the Labour Party in power is somehow different
from the Tories, the evidence from the 1970s proves the contrary. It was
Healey and Callaghan who told us that ''reduced living standards were a
price worth paying in the fight against inflation.''
At the behest of the IMF it was Labour which began the attempt to cut
back on Government spending, primary targets being public-sector wages
and housing and the introduction of the option for local authorities to
sell off their housing stock.
''Thatcherism'' simply accelerated the process begun by Labour,
unemployed became the ''Price worth paying'', and tenants were given the
''right to buy'' rather than councils the option to sell.
As for the irreversibility of the ''pillars of decency'', it is ironic
that Brian Wilson should make this claim on the very day that the courts
have legitimised the application of cost benefit analysis to health
care.
If Labour is to win the next election it must appeal to the middle and
professional classes in the South of England and if it gains power it
dare not alienate them.
Westminster's ''first past the post'' electoral system, to which
Labour is so addicted, has ensured that Labour's traditional
working-class supporters have been effectively marginalised, politically
they don't count. Regardless of who wins the next election, the ongoing
economic trends will continue as will their social consequences.

YOU carried a story about the TV commercial for Walker Crisps then you
stated that the Independent Television Commission ''does not have the
power'' to ban them (ie the adverts). It can only request that they be
withdrawn. This is not the case. The ITC has a broad range of powers
derived from the Broadcasting Act, 1990, which includes the order
immediately to withdraw a television advertisement if it seriously
breaches the ITC Code of Advertising Standards and Practice.
In the case of the Walker Crisps adverts, we are currently in
discussion with all concerned as a result of receiving 25 complaints
regarding the advertisement featuring Gary Lineker. When our discussions
are completed, we will make a decision. Meanwhile, the advert is
currently off-air because of a natural break in its media schedule.

IN her wide-ranging article on sexual harassment Jennifer Cunningham
concludes that ''the debate will go on in every workplace, but the fun
has to stop when it becomes victimisation'' (March 8).
I suggest that sexual harassment, being essentially an illicit
exercise of power, is a form of victimisation. This was certainly true
in the case of Porcelli v Strathclyde Regional Council which established
in February, 1986, that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination
under the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act.
The fact that the male-dominated regional council pursued the female
complainant to an appeal hearing in the Court of Session at ratepayers'
expense was a shameful act of corporate misogyny which was reflected in
the attitudes and testimony of the predominantly male hostile witnesses
at the initial industrial tribunal hearing in April, 1984.
That ''it is still overwhelmingly women who are the victims'' of
sexual harassment suggests that these attitudes are still around, 11
years on.

IT was perhaps symbolic that your photograph of veteran steam
locomotive William Whitelaw carried a poignant reminder of our
investment-starved ScotRail (March 10). The locomotive's plate,
''warning overhead live wires,'' was a mocking reminder of the continued
absence of electrification on the Edinburgh-Glasgow line which, in its
unimproved state, fails to operate to its full potential as Scotland's
key Intercity route.
Electrification of the line would deliver a faster, really attractive,
and more competitive service than the current noisy, vibration-ridden
diesel railcars whose end-to-end schedules are now slower than 20 years
ago, and to stay ahead of the rubber-tyred competition, now benefiting
from massive M8 investment and steadily improving roads links at both
ends.
ScotRail's meagre 23% of network improved by electrification now ranks
us as railway curiosity corner, coming nearly bottom of a 20-nation
European league table of electrified railways.
The Government's ultimate intention of a shrunken, enfeebled ScotRail
has now become clear, albeit more deviously pursued than the discredited
1960s Conservative administration which openly published its intended
contraction by Beeching closure maps.
Conservative Lord Whitelaw's plea for a railway we could be proud of
echoes a broad national consensus, with the electorate likely to insist
on a change in Government policy before irrevocable destruction takes
place.

AS people who have the good of Glasgow and Scotland at heart, we are
most concerned at the result of the Developer Competition organised by
the Glasgow Development Agency.
We understand that although the brief emphasised tourism, no official
contact was made with the Scottish Tourist Board who are reported to
regard this site as very important. The Scottish Tourist Board consider
that a study should be made of the two proposals currently in for
outline planning permission to demonstrate which will give the greatest
net benefit to Scotland in the long term.
Before any irrevocable decisions are taken, we believe that the City
Council, Glasgow Development Agency, Scottish Enterprise, and the
Scottish Office should delay procedures:
1. To enable the Scottish Tourist Board or other independent experts
to give a view on the long-term net economic benefits of the alternative
proposals;
2. To enable the result of Millennium Fund application to be known, as
this, if successful, could produce an investment of up to #50m into a
mixed development containing many of the features of the GDA proposals,
but which would also include the ''unique major tourist attraction''
which Glasgow and Scotland require.

David Belcher gets an earful from Boo Radley's Martin Carr on the
unpredictability of life, music and orange juice
SWEARIE exclamations bearing an unmistakable Scouse imprint! They are
erupting forcefully out of the phone and straight down my ear as soon as
I make early-morning contact with Martin Carr in his London hotel room.
Lawks, I splutter apologetically. Have I rudely roused from slumber or
otherwise discombobulated the chief tunesmith of Creation's current
guitar-pop contenders, the Boo Radleys?
Thankfully not. It transpires that in answering my call, the first of
many such telephonic press-interfaces arranged for that day, Martin has
knocked over his carton of orange juice, soaking the bed on which he is
currently reclining. I express the hope that he won't have to sleep in a
damp patch later that night. ''Oh no,'' says Martin in deadpan tones.
''They've put me in a room with two beds -- rock stardom, huh?''
Playful and sardonic. These are apt words for the Boo Radleys' music;
their view of life, and their rather fine upcoming fourth album,
released a week on Monday, Wake Up! These words would also seem to
describe the Boo Radleys' approach to interviews, for in their
conversations with journalists the band seem to enjoy the lazy spinning
of mazy webs of semi-truth.
Didn't they once allege that their Merseyside schooldays were scarred
by RE teachers quoting grievous amounts of Dylan in class and
threatening them with black-belt karate moves? Didn't Martin claim to
have spent most of his teens working as a whippet-breeder's assistant
and single-handedly building Liverpool's largest pile of empty
beer-cans?
And so will I get a straight answer when I ask Martin whether the
Guinness Encyclopaedia of Popular Music is correct when it states that
he was born in Thurso? I do, kind of.
''Me claiming to be Scottish depends on who I'm with. Who I'm trying
to impress. I was born there, though. Lived there for a couple of years.
My mum and dad are from Manchester, and they moved up there. Don't know
why. I think my dad was up to something very shady. I think I was
actually made at Dounreay.''
OK, OK. Sum up the Boo Radleys in the light of your last
wildly-eclectic LP, Giant Steps, and the breathy, beaty, Byrdsy,
Beatlesy, Bacharachesque vibe of the new one?
''I don't think we're any one thing at any one time. I just don't want
to repeat things. We could have gone on with the experimental side of
Giant Steps or we could have done 12 pop songs. The next LP could be
really off the wall. The one constant is loads of songs. I always have
to impress myself, and the other three -- and they're very hard to
impress.
''I'll play them new songs, and they'll all lounge about saying
'You've done that before' and 'That's not very good.' I get the melodies
first, standing in front of the telly and strumming till I get something
that's not already on a Beatles LP. I've come up with some great stuff,
and then found myself thinking: 'Oh, hang on, I've heard this
somewhere,' and I've had to spend five hours going through thousands of
my old albums.
''But then sometimes you just leave it, even though it was on a
Beatles album, but you change it a little bit, and no-one will ever
know. It's happening more often, that.''
You're in Glasgow soon. Any funny stories about previous visits?
''We supported Dinosaur Jr five years ago at Barrowland when we were
just little lads. We watched the bouncers beating kids up in front of
the stage; it made us feel sick. In fact, Tim, our bass player, had been
sick before we even went on, with nerves. He threw up all over a
bouncer.
''Anyway, we kept stopping playing, hoping the bouncers would stop
beating the kids up, but they never took any notice.''
Aside from the ongoing top-10 single success of Wake Up Boo!, your
mainstream impact hasn't equalled the left-field critical acclaim you've
been accorded: does this bother you?
''Whenever we listen to our records and shout: 'This is so obvious;
why isn't it blasting out of every radio in Britain? Weird bits -- what
weird bits?' So although it's nice to be viewed as renegades, I'd rather
have the cash and retire, thank you.''
Any pithy bit of rock'n'roll philosophy to favour us with?
''Take a sad song and make it better... that's a good way to do
things, isn't it? So despite having been told it would be a nightmare,
we went on the Lollapalooza tour across America last summer -- and it
was a nightmare, but we decided to enjoy it. Five weeks of being
stupidly hot, too hot to live, too hot to do anything but drink and fall
asleep; five weeks of playing on a small stage on the back of a truck in
a car park at two in the afternoon, and nobody knowing who we were and
being drowned out by George Clinton on the main stage.
''Oh yeah, and rock stars should always bear in mind that next year
they could just as easily be back down the mines or living in LA.''
Yon Boo Radleys appear at Glasgow's Garage on April 4, a week after
the release of Wake Up! Don't sleep in on either of these days or you'll
miss something that's rather more than playful and sardonic. Truly, the
Boo Radleys and their new album are swear-wordingly good.
City slogans
MY REQUEST for names for the Glasgow new music festival which will in
October succeed Sound City produced a mixed bag. Angela White suggested
the punsome Glistening Glasgow, while Les Burges contributes Glasgo-go
95. Showing admirable enterprise, Fiona Garrett Kerr didn't bother with
a slogan at all, instead asking me to pass on her job application and CV
to the festival's organisers.
Lorna Macintyre's Playfest has possibilities, but James Potter's
Mungo-Jungo Jamboree sadly has none. My personal favourite: N. Furrie's
Bongo Mungo! T-shirts will be despatched soonliest to all entrants.

TINY ROWLAND, Lonrho's ousted founder and former chief executive, has
come out fighting in the run up to next Friday's agm, appealing directly
to shareholders to support his appointment as president which was
originally intended before his sacking.
In a 15-page letter to shareholders, he also attacked Lonrho chief
executive Dieter Bock's record. He also explained how the two men fell
out over sales of German properties and other Lonrho assets.
Mr Rowland said his forced departure from Lonrho came when he asked
the temporary chairman to distribute the Gewog file to the board. Gewog
was a German property company which was disposed off in 1993 and which
has been the subject of allegations against Mr Bock over which he is
suing a German magazine and the Mail on Sunday.
The day before the board meeting, Mr Rowland said he was putting this
view forward ''in my mild and agreeable way over a cup of tea when Mr
Bock became incandescent with rage and ordered me from the Lonrho office
which we moved into in 1962.'' The following day he was dismissed at the
board meeting.
In his letter, Mr Rowland challenges Mr Bock to reveal details of his
finances and those of his private Atlanta property group.
Lonrho has denied that Mr Bock benefited personally from the sale of
Gewog and said that the auditors cleared the accounting treatment and
the Stock Exchange was consulted on the deal.
In his letter Mr Rowland says, ''My services to Lonrho cannot be
terminated since they come from the heart, and perhaps you will consider
recognising whatever fun and profit you have had from your shareholding
by voting for me.''
He wants shareholders to support resolutions seven and eight, which
were originally framed by the board led by Sir John Leahy and Dieter
Bock himself and require the support of 75% of the votes cast.
Lonrho's directors have since written to shareholders urging them to
vote against the resolutions. But Mr Bock is understood to be voting his
18.5% stake in favour because of a previous binding agreement.
Rowland has started a High Court action against Lonrho for unfair
dismissal.

<HEADLINE>Only body with resources to deploy. College urged to battle animal welfare lobby</HEADLINE>

A CALL for the Scottish Agricultural College to take a major part in
the farming industry's public relations battle with the animal welfare
lobby was made yesterday by the vice-convener of the Scottish
Landowners' Federation.
Mr Andrew Dingwall-Fordyce of Brucklay, Maud, argued that the college,
with an annual turnover of #41m was the only body which had the
resources to deploy in promoting agriculture and the rural economy
generally.
''I cannot believe that they cannot find #100,000 out of their budget
to promote the industry upon which their own future depends,'' he told
the annual meeting of the federation's north-east region in Aberdeen.
The college had the resources to undertake research into animal
behaviour which could be used to refute some of the arguments from the
welfare lobby who were keen to change farming completely, he said.
Professor Phillip Thomas, principal of the college who was the main
speaker at the meeting, said that the college had talked a lot to the
RSPCA and to some of the pressure groups.
''By and large the pressure groups don't want to listen,'' he said.
''They are not interested in objective scientific evaluation.'' On the
question of animal journey times, he said, there was some scientific
basis for the 15-16 hours that had been proposed. The eight hour
alternative being pushed from some quarters was a figure which had been
just plucked out of the air.
The college was very keen to have an input into Government thinking on
the animal transport issue, he said. It was, however, proud of its
independence. ''We are non-political -- that is something we have to be
very careful about. We have to stand at arm's length from the National
Farmers' Union, from the Landowners' Federation and from the Government.
Our independence is very precious to us.''
Speaking after the meeting Mr Dingwall-Fordyce said he would like to
see the college undertaking a more pro-active stance on behalf of the
industry from which it generated much of its money. They are a big
commercial enterprise and are the only organisation that can afford to
do it,'' he said. ''They can do it as subtly as they like. They do not
need to be political with a capital P but I do believe they should be
political with a small P. I suspect because they are still partly
Government funded they have to be careful about what they do.''
Some of the welfare bodies were very rich with a large income from
legacies, he said. ''If you have money you can do anything. Agriculture
cannot promote itself because we do not have the cash to do it.''

United Distillers' Kilmarnock plant, the traditional home of Johnnie
Walker whisky, yesterday played host to the first official visit to
Scotland of Mr Finn Johnsson, who joined the company as managing
director last month.
Mr Johnsson and his colleagues were in Kilmarnock for a board meeting
of parent company Guinness which is due to announce full-year results
next Thursday.
Mr Johnsson has spent most of his business career in international
consumer products with Swedish Match before becoming chief executive of
Scandinavia's leading building products group Euro AB in 1990.
''I am excited at the challenge of leading United Distillers which has
such an outstanding portfolio of international brand names selling
throughout thwe world,'' he said.

CHRISTOPHER Grieve, otherwise known as Hugh MacDiarmid, was poet,
Marxist, nationalist, free-thinker, bit of a lad, and then some. Away
from the public stage he was the kindest of blokes, but on a platform or
with pen in hand, all hell broke loose. He became a provocateur, a
disturber of the peace, an upsetter of stale and staid minds.
I sometimes cringed at his limitless belligerence, and he was on my
side. He took no prisoners, won few allies, turned the meek into
foaming-at-the-mouth enemies, and didn't give a damn. He was the
second-best-read man I've known. The best was John Ross Campbell, an old
Clydeside Red whose awesome encyclopaedic knowledge was softened by a
most amiable demeanour.
Once upon a time, Chris Grieve was a candidate in a famous by-election
in Perth and Kinross. Johnny Campbell was his by-election minder. The
Tory candidate was Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Chris was odds-on favourite to
lose his deposit, which he did with great aplomb. Each night after the
hustings Chris and Johnny retired to their hotel, drank malt whisky and
discussed the problems of the universe. From Aristotle to Zapata, and
everything in between.
0 One night they got into an argument about the merits of rugby as
opposed to football. It ended with Chris insisting that rugby was a
man's game and Johnny that football was an intelligent man's game.
For Johnny Campbell from the West of Scotland, rugby was the game of
the less-intelligent middle-class male. Ruddy-faced, baw-heided, and
big-bummed. Petty bourgeois lager louts, whose fathers probably scabbed
in the General Strike.
For Chris Grieve from Langholm, the Lang Toon o' the Scottish Borders,
it was the game of artisans and workers; fine-featured, noble-headed,
with the proportions of a Greek god, whose fathers probably didn't scab
in the General Strike.
Same game. Same rules. Two intelligent men. Roughly the same outlook
on life. Vastly different perceptions of rugby. But then sport is not,
and can never be, an island. The social ambience of rugby and every
other game is shaped and moulded by society or that sector of society
that gave it life and sustains it. A game has no class bias but people
do.
Rugby took its name from an English public school. It became part of
the public-school system. The lesser fee-paying and grammar schools took
up the game with the zeal of camp followers.
In the central belt of Scotland, where the mass of Scots live, rugby
is still a middle-class game. Glasgow High, Kelvinside, and Watsonians;
no Easterhouse Secondary or Govan Highonians. But then the only thing
that's constant is change.
This Saturday I'll be with pals in a pal's house; Glaswegians all,
fitba daft (some are just daft, and backed Scotland to win the Grand
Slam at 40-1 before we beat the French in Paris, and if that isn't daft
nothing is) horny-handed sons of Govan and less sophisticated airts and
pairts.
We'll lunch. We'll watch television as Scotland beat England at
Twickenham and get skooshed. If England fluke it, we'll get skooshed. If
it's a draw we'll only get half skooshed. We don't like draws.
We were at Murrayfield in 1990 when Scotland last won the Grand Slam.
I remember as if it was yesterday the unadulterated joy as the final
whistle blew. A few months later we were in Italy supporting Scotland in
football's World Cup.
An enthusiasm for rugby hasn't diminished our enthusiasm for football.
Only mono-minded morons can't handle more than one sporting interest.
Personally I've got a stack.
In the past many of us had no choice. It was football and nothing
else. I hadn't seen a game of rugby until my late teens when my parents
bought a television. This opened up a new world for me. I learned of the
splendour of cricket through the telly, and the consummate skills of Tom
Graveney, Tony Lock, and Jim Laker and many others. When I moved to
London in the 1960s I spent many happy days at the Oval and Lords.
Rugby took a bit longer to penetrate. It was the great Welsh teams
that first caught my interest. Their handling and running were a
revelation and I discovered that rugby could be beautiful. I'm now
hooked, and I'm not alone. There are many blokes from my background who
are now into rugby. We're happy with an atmosphere among the fans that
teems with commitment but is without verbal obscenities and the baiting
of other teams.
Women and families get involved. I've never known anything like the
tail-gating, carnival/picnic atmosphere of the car-park at Murrayfield.
No fights. No unpleasantness. It's like an alfresco Hogmanay, and
opposing fans join in the festivities.
Some may say all of this is part of rugby's middle-class heritage, but
it's good and decent and that matters more than anything else. Long may
it continue, and I wish to hell we could get it in football.
Rugby is growing and will assume an even higher media profile. Lots
more money will pour into the coffers. Murrayfield, with its vast
seating capacity and multiple executive boxes, is as amateur as Las
Vegas.
Those who planned it did so to maximise income, and we're talking
millions. That kind of money will command skills of the highest quality.
This will entail professional dedication by the athletes. Such athletes
will have to be paid. Professional rugby is inevitable, no-one can stop
it, and the rugby authorities should stop pussy-footing around and start
now by paying the international squad.
The rules of the game are far too complicated for a mass spectator
sport. A penalty is given and it's not at all clear to me which rule has
been infringed. I ask the aficionados and they don't know. Nobody knows,
except the ref, and he ain't talking.
Five points for a try has encouraged running, but penalties for what
appear to be technical offences are still too large a component of the
eventual score line. The only fighting I've seen at rugby matches has
been on the field, and some of the mayhem has been horrendous.
They might have got away with it when those viewing the GBH totalled
43 stalwarts, five dogs, and three racing pigeons out of puff and taking
a rest on top of the covered enclosure, but with millions watching it
isn't on. If the authorities don't act, the police will.
The game has spread outwith what was the British Empire. This trend
seems certain to continue; by the next century rugby will be played
throughout the world. I would love to see Scottish rugby in the
forefront of these developments. But first we have to put our own house
in order.
Rugby in Scotland needs a much bigger and wider social base. The door
is open. Saturday's game and the World Cup receive massive exposure.
When Wimbledon is on telly kids are out in droves with frayed tennis
rackets and a baldy ball. The England/West Indian Tests this summer will
inspire thousands of scratch cricket matches in our public parks.
What does a youngster do when he sees big Gavin's try in Paris? He
hasn't a rugby ball and has no access even to the most elementary rugby
facilities. The media exposure is wasted. The kid can't even fantasise
about a touchdown in the back court, and that's bad. The young must have
their dreams or the game is lost.
Strategically, Scottish rugby needs a breakthrough in Glasgow and the
West. Money has to be spent in non-rugby-playing areas. Otherwise the
game will stifle in middle-class ghettos and cosy wee clubs.
There is a political/cultural dimension. Scotland, one of the oldest
nations in the world, is part of a state which embraces a number of
other nations. One of them, England, is very much larger than the rest.
A unitary state within which a large nation lives cheek by jowl with a
much smaller nation generates tension and the elements of conflict. The
big nation, wittingly or unwittingly, threatens to engulf the identity
and culture of the small nation by sheer numbers.
The small nation has to bawl, shout, and sometimes fight, to be
allowed to be itself. In such a state the small nation must have legal
and constitutional guarantees which safeguard its national identity, and
national rights. This, I believe, is what devolution is about.
Every nation, big or small, has the right to self-determination. That
is what the last World War was supposed to be about. But in reality, big
nations have the power to claim that right, small nations don't.
Until this question is resolved relations between the nations of these
isles will be soured. Sport is involved along with everything else. When
the Scottish team and supporters sing Flower of Scotland with the words
''be a nation again'' they're making a statement and reflecting a wider
consensus that goes beyond sport.
When we used to go on our biennial trip to Wembley it was more than
just a game. Football was one of the few arenas where Scotland, as a
nation, could raise its standard. Victory was evidence that a small
nation could win against the odds and claim its rights.
We also refused to admit defeat. After the game in which we were
trounced 5-1, I was walking out of the stadium with Denis Law and Pat
Crerand. We were disconsolate or, put another way, as sick as a parrot.
Then a wee bloke shouted: ''Haw Jimmy, it was a moral victory''.
When the English and Scottish Football Associations ended the home
internationals Scottish rugby was left holding the banner with annual
jousting against the Auld Enemy.
Scottish rugby hasn't let us down. There have been epic struggles. The
victory in 1990. The narrow defeat in the semi-final of the World Cup
the following year. Then Saturday's game, and at stake the lot -- Grand
Slam, Triple Crown. One thing's for sure -- win or lose, our lads will
give everything to the cause.
Some years ago England's big game was against Wales. Now it's
different. The pits have closed. The culture of the valleys has changed.
The religion of the oval ball has declined and Wales is no longer the
rugby power of yore.
The game against Scotland is now England's big game. It's ridiculous.
When you compare resources we shouldn't be on the same park. When you
look at the level of our club game compared with theirs it doesn't make
sense. Yet in the games against France and Wales we reached new heights.
If we win it will be the greatest day in the history of Scottish
rugby. If we lose we can claim a moral victory. A draw and I'll get half
skooshed. Didn't I tell you, I don't like draws?

THE latest set of figures from specialist pub company J D Wetherspoon
will give most brewers a nasty fright.
Turnover in the half-year to January rose 54% to #31.6m while like for
like sales jumped 10% as market share was gained through the combination
of providing high-quality pubs with good beer sold at prices about 10%
below the competition -- and no music.
Chairman Tim Martin said yesterday that the beer supply agreements
with Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Courage have been extended for another
five years. But the most significant factor is that these arrangements
are priced below the current contracts that are running out -- an
indication of the over-capacity in the brewing industry.
These two companies supply about 75% of the Wetherspoon volume and so
one of the concerns about the company's future supplies of cheap beer
has been removed.
There was an increase of 14 in the number of outlets to a total of 101
with the average size dramatically increasing. Some of the pubs are as
big as 5500 sq ft.
Wetherspoon has found that profitability is significantly higher
outside the M25 particularly on freeholds while the average return on
capital employed on leasehold premises, frequently former shops, banks,
and post offices is 34%.
Chief executive Mark McQuater is hoping to open the first Wetherspoon
pub in Glasgow as soon as a suitable site can be found. The city has
definite attractions as it already contains the busiest Bass pub in
Britain.
A #50m borrowing facility has been granted by the Bank of Scotland and
the Royal Bank of Scotland at less than 1% over base rate which
underpins the group's credibility.
There is the possibility of a rights issue in perhaps a year's time.
This will help finance the business which should see overall turnover
this rise from #46.6m to about #75m. That points to pre-tax profits of
#11m which would leave the shares at 498p trading at just under 18 times
likely earnings.
This is an excellent lockaway for the medium term.
The interim dividend has been raised a quarter to 2.75p for an
on-going yield of about 2%.

<TEXT>
SCOTCH Premier Meat is looking for increased supplies of lamb for its
Edinburgh plant to meet a growing demand in both home and export
markets. Mr Stuart Gorman, general manager, said that he would be hoping
to buy between 8000 and 10,000 lambs a week from producers throughout
Scotland -- but they would have to meet the variable requirements of
different markets.
The main call would be for lambs in the 15-21kg weight range, he said.
Leanness and consistency were of paramount importance.
''The Mediterranean market is looking for lambs in the 5-10kg weight
range, while the home trade requires a 15-21kg lamb'' he said. He
emphasised the importance of farmers' selecting lambs to a tight
specification. At present abattoirs often had to purchase double the
number of lambs required to secure enough to meet a particular
specification, he told producers visiting his plant.
''The more lambs we can get which meet our specification, the more
profitably we can handle them and therefore the higher the price we can
pay the farmer,'' he said. ''The price to the farmer is diluted at
present because of the number of lambs which fail to meet our
requirements.''
Aberdeen and Northern Marts -- an associated company of Scotch premier
Meat -- has developed a new computer programme to help sheep producers
meet the requirements of the market.

MANY large corporations are keen on getting back to basics and
streamlining their businesses to focus on products in their portfolio
which have the best growth and margin prospects. Consumer products and
healthcare group Reckitt &amp; Colman is one such company. It is in what
chief executive Vernon Sankey describes as ''active negotiations'' with
prospective buyers of its UK food and drink business which includes
Colmans mustard and Robinson's barley water.
However, he refused to say whether talks with Danone, France's biggest
food group, had broken down because of Reckitt's request that jobs be
guaranteed at the Colmans Norwich site. Food and drink are no longer
seen as key parts of the group. The group's overall disposal plan
including the UK food and drink business is expected to net the group
around #400m.
To complete the break from the founding family of the mustard
business, group chairman Sir Michael Colman has said he is to retire. He
will be replaced in August by Alan Darby who was formerly with
SmithKline Beecham.
Just after the year-end, Reckitt made a major step towards achieving
its aim of becoming a global household and toiletries group with the
acquisition of L &amp; F Household in the US. This results in a roughly one
third split in Reckitt's geographic business although there is still
thought to be scope for small acquisitions in certain countries and in
product areas such as insecticides.
Last year, the company faced difficult conditions in Europe including
the UK although there was some sign of recovery in the second half. Its
presence in emerging markets in Latin America and Asia, where growth was
strong, helped to offset weaker more mature markets. Reckitt formed its
first joint venture in China.
Group sales from continuing operations were steady at #2070.8m. Profit
before tax was #160.2m compared with #256.9m in 1993. The 1994 figure is
achieved after crediting non-operating items of #29m and charging
exceptional reorganisation costs of #139.1m. If these items are excluded
taxable profits improved by 5.2%.
Within the household and toiletry division, sales were largely static
although profits rose by 4.6%. Sales of pharmaceutical products
increased 4.1% although higher spending on research and development and
marketing led to a 12% decline in the division's operating profit.
Elsewhere, its food sales remained static with the UK soft drinks
business hit by the poor weather.
Dividends, restated following the rights issue, rose by 7.6% to 18.66p
after a final shareholders' payment of 11.8p.
The current year is expected to be one of restructuring and
consolidation following the L &amp; F acquisition but Reckitt's is confident
that it can achieve synergy benefits of #40m per annum within three
years.
Reckitt and Colman shares lost 5[1/2]p to 657[1/2]p. However, the
prospect of double-digit earnings growth in 1996/97 and progressive
dividend increases could prompt a significant re-rating of the shares.

THE hapless Mr Major might have been forgiven if he had touched down,
read the newspapers, and flown back out again towards the clear blue
yonder.
Yesterday's combined efforts of Chancellor Clarke, Lord McAlpine, and
the buffoon Hanley have strongly reinforced the impression of a
Government in melt-down. So may it be. But there is another side to that
coin which requires to be watched with increasing care.
If the Tories have decided that they are going to lose, and I think
that many of them have, then the smell of scorched earth will follow
close behind. The zealots will be pursuing irreversibility while those
who are merely greedy will recognise the enhanced urgency of turning
public into private, if pockets are to be satisfactorily lined.
One can see it happening already in several areas and none more so
than on the railways. Here indeed the race to privatise is now against
time, at least as much as against public opinion. The deadline is the
date of the next General Election and the stakes are enormous.
Consider the example of the proposed Channel Tunnel Rail Link. For
almost a decade, its construction has been frustrated by the edict laid
down by Mrs Thatcher and Cecil Parkinson, when he was Transport
Secretary, that no public money must go into the Tunnel or associated
works.
This week, the list of consortia seeking to build the line was
announced. One of them has, at its head, Lord Parkinson, with those
loyal Tory funders and asset-strippers, Trafalgar House, as its
mainstay. Another is fronted by Parkinson's former Cabinet colleague,
Lord Carrington.
The rhetoric about ''no public money'' has long since been abandoned,
since that simply meant that the line would never be built. The noble
lords and their allies are now looking for at least #1billion from the
taxpayer and probably a lot more. But that is the lesser of their
expectations from the public trough.
They also want to be handed #1.8billion worth of existing assets --
the magnificent Waterloo International Terminal and brand-new Eurostar
trains which have been paid for exclusively from public funds. The
theory is that this would provide Lord Parkinson or Lord Carrington with
a ''revenue flow'' which would eventually help pay for construction of a
new line.
It is a breathtakingly audacious scheme which would leave one of these
consortia with ownership of, and gilt-edged revenue from, the new Tunnel
rail services -- without a penny having been invested by them either to
take over the existing assets or to turn a sod on the still very
hypothetical new Channel Tunnel link.
Really, it is inconceivable that anyone but the Tories would
contemplate the disposal of such public assets on this basis. But the
question is no longer whether it is a scandal, which it patently is. The
idea of them backing down in the face of public indignation is
laughable. The only question which matters is whether it can be
organised in time to beat that General Election deadline.
The same applies to the rest of the rail privatisation programme which
enjoys a derisory level of public support. Meanwhile, the pressure to
privatise Railtrack -- which was originally intended to stay in the
public sector -- has come from its chairman, Robert Horton, and a few
others who could look forward like their counterparts in the other
privatised industries to massive personal enrichment.
The vast majority of railway managers are thoroughly hostile to what
is being done, but would lose their jobs instantly if they said so.
There are inevitably a few who envisage themselves as managing directors
of newly privatised companies, awash with share options and salaries
that have doubled overnight. The principal barrier to such ambitions is
the electoral calendar.
My melt-down theory is strengthened by the Tories' frenetic efforts to
press ahead with rail privatisation, whatever the views of their own
erstwhile supporters or the potential electoral cost. That is not the
rational conduct of a Government which is still keeping its eye on the
election ball. But in terms of political spite and personal greed, it
makes quite reasonable sense.
The potential for damage in the months -- no more than 24 and probably
quite a few less -- before an election is enormous. Think seriously
about the fact that, at a time when every other European country is
expanding its Motorail network, Britain is about to abolish ours in
order to facilitate the privatisation programme.
Consider the quite wicked way in which the issue of overnight services
has been dealt with -- including the inadvertent misleading of the House
of Commons by a Scottish Office Minister, Sir Hector Monro, who
apparently did not understand his colleagues' capacity for sheer
cynicism. Like everyone else, he knows that a consultation after
services have been withdrawn is a fraud.
If this can be done to the sleepers and Motorail, on the basis of
bogus statistics and no consultation, then it can -- and will -- be done
to a lot of other services as well. I believe that this battle must be
pursued to the last pitch and through every available channel, including
the courts.
We are now looking at a Government which is characterised on every
front by arrogance, financial self-interest, and contempt towards all
who challenge its omnipotence. The knowledge that it is on the way out
will not diminish any of these hallmarks. But if it is scorched earth
they are going for, they should know that every inch of the territory
will be fought for.

BEAUTIFUL, douce Perthshire is the least likely place for a
revolution, but one is taking place there at the moment. For evidence,
look no further this morning than our System Three poll of the Perth and
Kinross political constituency. This provides the most startling
manifestation yet of the demand for political change which appears to be
widespread throughout the country. The parliamentary seat, which has yet
to be given the date for an election to find a replacement for Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn, was a marginal one at the last General Election; it
will be even more marginal come the spring. There is little doubt that a
measure of personal affection for Sir Nicholas, contrary and cussed
though he was at times, enabled the Conservatives to hold on. Now Sir
Nicholas has gone there is nothing to restrain a level of protest which
seems to be flowing as deep and strong as the Tay. It is not surprising
to find the SNP in a strong position, even if the actual level of their
support in the poll is startlingly large. Labour has also virtually
doubled its percentage support from the last General Election but the
position of the Conservatives is truly surprising. Conservative support
appears to have been cut in half and they have slumped into third
position. In terms of traditional Perthshire politics, this is quite as
revolutionary as Birnam Wood hiking up its roots and heading for
Dunsinane.
It is in the nature of politicians to take comfort from anything;
fire, flood, and tempest all have their positive aspects and we may rest
assured that Perthshire Conservatives will put a gloss on to their 20%
standing in the poll. Most likely they will focus on the fact that this
is a protest vote, pure and simple. It is true that protest votes are
normally fragile affairs, only too prone to melt away in the heat of a
General Election. Yet this protest vote is different; it is an angry,
armour-plated monster which is unlikely to be assuaged by the
conventional run of political promises. The analysis of the issues which
have fed the protest make fascinating reading. Those old favourites, the
NHS, unemployment, and education are up at the top, but a very
respectable reading on the Richter-scale of anger is recorded by anxiety
on pensions and matters relating to the elderly. This is what comes of
trifling with the affections of your bedrock supporters and it is the
stuff of which political blasted heaths are made.
The Conservatives, then, will be dished, but they deserve to be. The
SNP will be triumphant, but they do not deserve to be. This assertion
will make them howl, but the recorded opinions are plain for all to see.
Self-government was well down the list of priorities and was of equal
importance, even with SNP voters, with the matter of political change
and removing the Tories. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that
the great SNP issues are not of particular interest to the people of
Perth and Kinross, but the prospect of using the SNP as a vehicle to
remove the Tories most certainly is. Pragmatically speaking, this might
be sufficient for Mr Salmond and his candidate, but it doesn't say much
about the essential importance of the SNP's plank in the election.
Labour will be pleased and content with their performance in the poll,
but they must also be getting uneasy. It is not the three hags from the
heath who are pursuing them but (to mix our myths) a good fairy
determined to wave her wand nationally, if not in Perth and Kinross.
This excess of good fortune is profoundly disturbing, but if Kenneth
Clarke continues to tell the dismal truth about the feel-good factor,
and Lord McAlpine presses his notion of opposition being good for the
Conservative soul, Labour may yet be blessed. If this startling poll is
correct, and if it applies nationally, the Perthshire Tories will be
left with the resounding line from Lady Macbeth which runs, ''Stand not
upon the order of your going, but go at once.''

POLITICAL parties in power are generally unaware -- cocooned in
ignorance -- that any great enterprise with but one driving force is
terminally stressed and will, given time, run into the ground. Fancy
your chances on board a windjammer that, though fully rigged, carries
just a single sail into the Roaring Forties? Trust to luck on an
airliner with only one engine in place as it sets off across the
Atlantic?
Not many subscribers for such dodgy thrills, you might think, but that
is Britain today -- 55 million travellers whose future and sufficiency
is posited on the philosophy of just one driving force -- money: the
cash culture that views expenditure on the common weal as reckless
profligacy, that promotes unfettered pursuit of individual gain
regardless. Mono-culture gone mad.
Fortunately, like all dogma asserted by the denial of any possible
alternative, money mania carries within it the seed of its own
destruction. It is absolutely certain to crash, the only unknown being
when. Communism -- its leitmotiv outwardly more laudable than today's
greed -- fell apart long after it had gone rancid and passed its sell-by
date. All but the keepers of the Kremlin knew the system was on borrowed
time, and even they may have guessed.
Here and now knowledge of the ultimate -- possibly imminent --
collapse of a crass and unworkable philosophy is shared by all save the
members of Cabinet, Ministers of State, Government Whips, Tory
back-benchers and the more than adequately rewarded public-utility
princes who put it in place.
As this Government strains every nerve and sinew at Maastricht and in
Brussels to ensure that British workers have the longest hours and the
lowest pay, as our City institutions become a byword world-wide for
self-interest and sleaze, as swathes of honest folk who do their best
are told that their best is not needed in the interest of ever greater
profit-making, one wonders: whatever became of life in the round?
Where are compassion and concern, self-esteem and individual worth, a
commonality of interest? The fundamental flaw with the Tories' money
culture is that it does not have the breadth and depth to withstand the
challenges thrown up by life or satisfy aspiration and hope. If cash is
all then to have none is to be nothing.
Thus greed: a foot on the neck of one's fellow man to ladder a way to
the sunny monied uplands, total disregard for the legacy of one's
passage on the earth in the interest of short-term gain, loyalty set at
nought, self-interest rampant.
As a blueprint for the individual, a framework for national life, it
is not to be tolerated. John Major's network of dissatisfaction charters
-- 50p back if your train runs late, a two-for-the-price-of-one free
vasectomy if your operation for an in-growing toenail is unduly delayed
-- reduces life to soap coupon status.
Never mind that you are without work, your children taken to the
financial brink if they contemplate higher education, your elderly
relatives stripped of their goods as well as their dignity if they turn
to the state for succour, the rule book says you get tuppence refund and
there is a new state-managed car-boot sale on the way where you may
spend it.
Notwithstanding the smug certainties, the bland absolutes that daily
issue from government lips, the bald fact is that what was a civilised
society -- and yes, there were flaws and deficiencies -- has been
dismantled in favour of a money culture: cash galore today if you can
hack it and a bleak outlook tomorrow for the rest.
In real life -- society without charters -- it is all about relatives
and friends, neighbours and colleagues, hobbies, interests, books and
music. It is about gardens and growth, art and theatre, conversation and
reflection. Money, when it enters the equation, does so only as a means
to satisfy aspiration, not as the end in itself.
The ultimate cynicism is that the trumpeted financial benefits of our
sink-or-swim society are phoney. The workaholic ethos and climate of
fear entrenched by low wages and the likelihood of redundancy keep those
in work at their bench or desk for hours far beyond what can be
supported long-term.
Working Britain now sets off at seven in the morning and returns not
earlier than 12 hours later -- or knows the reason why. Good news for
shareholders.
But the growing incidence of nervous and mental ill-health, children
neglected in the sense that they are ''orphaned'' by the workplace,
broken homes and lost peace of mind all have a cost. Britain's business
may be leaner, is certainly meaner, could well be wealthier, but the
bill for long hours and low wages has to be picked up by the nation at
large.
How can a nation so divided -- the greedy out of their box and dancing
on the lid, the rank and file determined to resist having the clock
turned back to the time of chimney boys and phossy-jaw -- look forward
to a future of achievement and unity? The answer is not at all.
Money as a yardstick is just not sufficient -- cannot replace
commitment and community, loyalty and honest endeavour. Management says
it must be free to manage and, it seems to the struggling mass on the
receiving end of their endeavour, to enjoy obscene reward for doing so.
Management and Government alike have yet to calculate the cost. What
they appear not to know, although it is common knowledge throughout the
land, is that the day of reckoning is not a question of ''if'' -- simply
a matter of ''when''.

IT was depressing to read the Scottish Office plans for Loch Lomond
and that these amount to little more than a revamp of the existing
Regional Park Joint Committee.
Experience with Loch Lomond, and elsewhere in local government
history, has shown conclusively that joint committees depending on
voluntary co-operation between local authorities are ineffective.
Authorities have different agendas and priorities which a joint
committee has no power to co-ordinate.
A joint board, on the other hand, could be a statutory body in its own
right with planning powers and its own staff and funds. The Secretary of
State's brief to the working party which reported to him a year and a
half ago precluded such a recommendation. Nevertheless, the working
party made it clear that that is what it would have preferred.
A joint board could be a national park in all but name -- and a
national park would be set up for Loch Lomond if the wishes of the
people of Scotland or of its MPs were respected.
Indeed the Government itself is effusive in its support for national
parks in England and is currently strengthening them. Surely Loch Lomond
merits the same level of care and investment?

Vice-Chairman,

National Parks,

THE pips squeaked yesterday. Having suffered the consequences of the
Government's relentless squeeze on resources, our universities and other
higher education institutions sent out a terse yet resounding message
that enough was enough. The Committee of Scottish Higher Education
Principals focused its ire on the latest batch of efficiency gains, 3% a
year in each of the next three years in teaching, 1% in research. These
gains come on top of savage reductions in unit costs equivalent to 25%
over the past 10 years.
The pips, upon which so much of our economic and general wellbeing
depend, are in danger of being ground down to an arid powder. Yet the
Government seems to think that higher education has an endless capacity
to accommodate cuts. For that is what these efficiency gains amount to,
as Coshep has pointed out. For the Government they are the means by
which higher education does more for less. In other words, institutions
are continually to educate and train an increasingly disparate
undergraduate body with diminishing resources. There was slack in the
system, but it has long since been taken up.
Things now could not be tighter, as Professor Donald Leach, Principal
of Queen Margaret College in Edinburgh, illustrated yesterday. An
efficiency gain of 3% a year over three years is 10% compound. One way
to implement the cuts is to freeze recruitment to posts which become
vacant. In Queen Margaret's case, in other words, where the college has
10 jobs in one area today, it could have nine in three years. Obviously
implementing another round of efficiency gains -- which come on top of
inflation and are borne before recurrent funding is applied -- has
implications for jobs throughout the sector. There will be a price to
pay even if higher education teaching posts are not to go. Teachers will
simply have more work piled upon them as institutions turn more to
overseas markets for students whose recruitment will not carry a
financial penalty. That will be bad for morale, given that the workload
issue is already high on the labour relations agenda. Bigger classes,
tutorials, and labs will hardly improve the quality of teaching and
learning.
Significantly, the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council -- which
disburses public money to universities and colleges -- is pointing
teacher-training institutions in the direction of oversees recruitment.
Their funding from Government has suffered as a consequence of
controlling intakes to match supply with demand for teachers. Shefc's
stance has been interesting. The Government refused to give the council
a planning brief yet, as the impact of year-on-year funding reductions
bites, it is taking on an expanded role almost by default. Likely
changes planned for the way research is rated and rewarded -- again as a
consequence of at best standstill funding -- will make clear to
institutions that they should concentrate on what they are good at. And
for the first time they will be given indicative numbers for student
recruitment below and beyond which they will not be expected to go.
Shefc sees this as steering, but there is a thin line between that and
planning.

Alan
MacDermid, Medical Correspondent, meets two new NHS trust chairmen
with money on their minds
THE bracing winds of commerce and competition will soon blow through
two more of Scotland's cherished NHS institutions. Making money will
join casualty rescue and filling teeth for the Scottish Ambulance
Service and the Glasgow Dental Hospital and School.
They are among the fourth wave of eight new trusts, completing the 47
from which practically all NHS care in mainland Scotland, beyond family
doctor level, will be delivered after April 1.
Mr Alan Devereux, the Englishman who became a celebrity north of the
Border through his chairmanship of the Scottish Tourist Board -- he now
heads the Quality Scotland Foundation -- will chair the trust board of
the Scottish Ambulance Service.
Professor Sir James Armour, vice-principal of Glasgow University, who
led the successful fight to save the city's Vet School from closure,
will be chairman of the Dental Hospital and School.
Both acknowledge income generation as one of the key roles they will
have to take on if their charges are to be nurtured and developed in a
cost-conscious NHS.
Since his appointment Mr Devereux -- who chairs his first board
meeting today -- has regularly donned a uniform and gone out with
ambulance crews on the night shift to find out for himself what the
sharp end is like.
''I don't believe you can make judgments about the service at
headquarters unless you have experienced what it's like in the front
line,'' he said.
His board will be responsible for the biggest ambulance service in the
UK, with a #77m budget, some 1000 vehicles at 158 locations, an air
ambulance wing of four fixed-wing planes and three helicopters, and 2700
staff. Another 400 are being recruited and trained to bring an end to
single-manning.
All these vehicles have to be serviced, and Mr Devereux has this
activity earmarked as a source of income by bringing in outside custom.
''We will have to look for opportunities to create income by selling
our skills to other people, and that is one example. Another is training
-- we have had approaches from Middle Eastern countries who are
interested in training for paramedic or consultancy work.
''The kind of disasters that have happened in England -- like the
computer failure in London -- are not going to happen here. There is no
way I am going to copy anyone in England. If we have role models it will
not be English ambulance brigades; it will be a world-class service. I
believe the German service, for example, is very successful.
''I hope to make the staff an offer next week -- a package which will
treat them like professionals and give them a bit of a pay rise. We will
be one of the first trusts to offer new money at the start. It is all
part of the process of making them not rearward-looking or union-minded,
but more professional and visionary.''
To the man or woman in the street the biggest concern about ambulances
is probably how long they take to arrive.
''We are meeting our Patients' Charter targets but it is not just a
matter of how quickly you get there but how well you deal with the
situation when you arrive, how good your equipment is, how
well-integrated you are with the accident and emergency department,''
said the chairman.
One of the most radical changes could be the introduction of
criteria-based dispatching, in order to get some kind of priority into
the service.
''At the moment we have to give priority to 999 calls regardless of
how serious. Criteria response would require some kind of protocol,
where under medical supervision the controllers will ask some questions
to make an assessment of the situation.''
Sir James Armour will preside over a smaller affair -- budget #9.5m,
staff 370 -- but a service with a nostalgic ring -- dental care free at
the point of need. Since even paid-for NHS care is becoming increasingly
rare in general dental practice, the hospital is liable to become
increasingly popular.
''The numbers coming in have risen gradually over the past few years
-- I am not sure why this is happening but one wonders if it has
anything to do with the cost of dentistry,'' he said.
''I know towns in England where there is nothing but private
dentistry. If it became a real trend I am sure we would have to look at
negotiating bigger contracts to get the money we need.''
Laboratory services for other dentists and hospitals, in microbiology
and pathology, is one area that is being looked at to boost income.
Another is in training -- apart from the undergraduate and post-graduate
training of dentists, dental surgery assistants and hygienists -- the
post-graduate department has already embarked on a series of video and
CD-Rom distance-learning packages.

IN the light of current public concern over the conviction for murder
of Clegg of the ''Paras'' and the two Guardsmen, for their respective
actions in Northern Ireland and at Gibralter, may the following
questions be answered by the competent authority:
Were these soldiers on active service at the time of the incidents?
If so, why were they tried in the civil courts and not by courts
martial?
If they were not on active service, why were they armed?
It would be helpful to assessment, if the orders to these soldiers
were made public.

Kirsty Scott searches for a definition of the elusive feel-good
factor, and discovers that money may not be the answer.
WILLIAM Reid reckons Thoreau was right -- most of us are living lives
of quiet desperation. Soaked through, but stuck at his post selling
copies of the Big Issue in Glasgow's city centre, Reid, aged 24, is
bemused by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's talk of chasing the elusive
''feel-good factor''.
''Feel-good factor? What feel-good factor? I'm not feeling so good,''
he said, handing out another rain-splattered copy as a passer-by shoved
an empty burger box into the bin behind him.
Clarke's apparent admission that the feel-good factor was a long way
off caused delight among Opposition ranks and brought a swift ''he
didn't mean that'' from the Tories.
Clarke dismissed the affair as ''froth and flannel'', but the factor
which caused all the fuss has been a little less easy to label. Reid
reckons it's about people being able to feel good about themselves. For
him that would mean cash and a decent meal.
''Having enough money to go out once in a while, to a restaurant, a
cinema, or something like that -- at the moment, it's every six months
or so; getting food in my stomach say three times a day instead of
once.''
Dr Robert Rogerson, of Strathclyde University's Quality of Life
Research Group, may have some of the answers. He's been studying what
makes us feel good for eight years and will publish a guide later this
year on the best places in the UK to feel your best.
A sense of community and a sense of security are the two most
important factors mentioned by people when asked what makes them content
with their lot. After these, different generations have different
wish-lists.
''For younger people the feel-good factor is much more economic,''
said Rogerson. ''They mention having access to a job or knowing there
are jobs out there, and feeling that they are getting a reasonable wage
and able to afford housing. It doesn't have to be a four-bedroom villa
in the suburbs, just an affordable form of housing. For older people the
emphasis is very much on safety, health, and close family ties.''
Eight years ago, the Strathclyde team discovered Edinburgh was the
best place to stay for quality of life. ''Somehow I don't think it will
be the same this time,'' said Rogerson.
Scotland, however, does tend to promote a better sense of well-being
than elsewhere. ''The research we have done so far suggests Scotland
generally does very well. As a general rule, places away from the
South-east did best for most groups.''
One thing Rogerson's study has uncovered is that money itself does not
guarantee happiness.
''Our research suggests that feeling good is not just economic. That
seems to me one of the dilemmas that Kenneth Clarke is facing. Economic
well-being is not the only route to feeling good. People can feel good
without money as long as they have these other things we've talked
about.''
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond would agree. ''I think it
means more than economic prosperity. What the Government thinks is the
feel-good factor is Tory support in the opinion polls, and clearly
that's not there.
''I can tell you what the feel-bad factor is. It's uncertainty and
people are very, very uncertain, even people who are in jobs. I think
the feel-bad factor is economic uncertainty largely prompted by
Government policy. Some of it is down to economic changes, a lot of it
is promoted by the Government as a positive virtue.''
Salmond believes strengthening the NHS and building a strong education
system would give people more peace of mind, as would the establishment
of a fairer social structure.
''To borrow from the Prime Minister, if you want a Scotland at ease
with itself you have to have a socially just Scotland. To borrow from
Cromwell, to prosper Scotland needs to be a just nation.''
On a personal level, there's one thing which would assuredly bring a
smile to his face. ''An independent Scotland would make me feel
extremely good.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson agrees that a healthier
economy could not shift public morale on its own. ''People have to
believe that there is a proper recovery. They have to believe that it is
likely to be sustained;  the only way people are going to be satisfied
is if they see some long-term security for themselves.''
For the Rev David Lunan, of the Church of Scotland's Board of Social
Responsibility, a rejection of money as the be-all and end-all would do
the trick.
''I do think we have created a society which has become very
self-centred and I don't think we're made that way. I think we are made
to have a care for one another. If we neglect that we will begin not to
feel good.
''It's a consequence of the kind of society which has been
economically centred, to the detriment of the social and cultural
aspects of our life. It's interesting the Government thinks we will feel
better once there has been an economic turnaround. I would think money
does not make us happy. Lack of money makes us unhappy, but more of it
does not necessarily improve our feel-good factor.''
William Reid, meanwhile, agrees with Kenneth Clarke on one point. It
will probably be several years before there's any significant shift in
public optimism.
As he speaks, a middle-aged woman stuffs a pile of change into his
hands and refuses a copy of the magazine. ''It's OK, love, I don't need
one of those,'' she says.
''Maybe there's a little bit of feel-good factor starting to pick
up,'' says Reid, as she walks off. ''Maybe some people aren't feeling
the pinch quite so much.''

I WAS interested to read Harry Diamond's tribute to J B McLaren (March
10).
For about 35 years I and my family have known him while sailing from
Balmaha. In recent years he enjoyed telling us he had been in intensive
care 11 times but he still sailed his Leisure 17, ''June Dream'',
expertly and single-handed, arriving at the boatyard on his motorbike.
Our first recollection of Jim McLaren would be about 1960. It was
January. The water in the bay of Balmaha was ice-bound and Jim and a
fellow enthusiast were breaking the ice in order to fulfil their
ambition to sail a catamaran throughout the winter.
My elder son laughed at the spectacle and J B promptly gave him a
rollicking. Every year he was anxious to sail his boat right up to his
birthday, early in November, I believe. By that time all other boats
would be out of the water.
I wonder if it is generally known that Jim McLaren was the motoring
expert who spotted the driving potential of the very young teenage
Jackie Stewart? At the time Jackie was not old enough to hold a driving
licence . . . J B was showing a high-performance car to Jackie's older
brother who suggested his ''kid brother'' might be given a chance to
drive, ''although under-age, he's quite competent''.

TERRY Neason's voice is the most remarkable instrument. In its medium
registers, it quavers and wobbles as though not quite sure of who and
what it is and where to place itself. But as the tempo rises and her
lungs fill out, it takes on a magnificent richness and when she really
lets rip, the red-hot mother within comes gloriously to the fore -- as
in songs like Jacques Brel's Marieke and Amsterdam and the old Billy
Holiday/Jimmy Davis number Lover Man.
At such times, I'd go on hands and knees to hear her. If only she
grabbed all her material with such confidence. This compilation of songs
and poetry is London's first glimpse of one of Scotland's favourites.
The Neason phenomenon gave off mixed vibes.
It was an odd combination of the raunchy and coy and Neason seemed to
make little attempt to engage in any personal way. Maybe it was the
unwelcome atmosphere of the Lyrics Studio (hardly full) which she found
unconducive. Certainly she made little attempt to engage in any personal
way. Or maybe she was just indulging a seldom allowed melancholic side.
At any event, a tightly-packed, powerful first-half gave way to a
second dominated by a tendency to sentimentalise. Too many lachrymose
ballads, and both a eulogy to motherhood and one to old-age left an odd
taste in the mouth, not balanced even by Sondheim's classic, Send in the
Clowns or Jackie Kay's delicate ode to the fragility of dreams, Dance of
the Cherry Blossom. Overall this did not show Neason at her best.

SMALL-scale productions of Greek tragedies have their point as
Laurence Boswell's trilogy-in-miniature proves. In the past few years
we've had epic versions of Aeschylus's The Oresteia and various sized
versions of The Women of Troy, The Bacchae, Hecuba.
Boswell, befitting the scale of his resources, opts for a distinctly
personal and jauntily sceptical tone for his three Euripides plays --
Elektra, Orestes, and Iphigeneia.
All bloody actions have their consequences, but translator Kenneth
McLeish takes a very much more contemporarily cynical tone. Orestes and
Elektra may talk of honouring their father by taking his revenge -- and
Orestes may talk of pangs of conscience -- but Sara Mair Thomas and
Charles Daish's brother and sister come to seem like Greek equivalents
of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, Mickey and Mallory.
Once you start, you can't stop. Conveniently, though, just as these
princely mortals are about to despair, up pop the Gods at the end of
each section to reassure them that after a few more obstacles, all will
be well.
Mair Thomas and Daish are most moving in their agonies but the real
touchstone is Barbara Flynn's resonant Iphigeneia in the third and final
part -- a high priestess with a lightness and precision of a latter-day
boulevardier.
Played as a trilogy on Wednesdays and Saturdays throughout the run,
Boswell's swan-song production as artistic director of The Gate offers a
fascinating comment on war and fate and the absurdity of it all.

THIS impressive exhibition of oil paintings and pastels by Crawford
Adamson who was born in Edinburgh and trained at Dundee, represents a
synthesis of the traditional and the modern.
The works are big, bold and technically proficient representations of
crowd scenes, sometimes out-of-doors but more often in the slightly
seedy underworld of Toulouse-Lautrec's cafes-concerts.
The ambiguity as to time and place is heightened by the strangely
frozen quality in all of the canvases. Unseen Performance or Nightclub
suggest that his interests are not with the performers but rather with
the audience. No-one looks out of the canvas, but all are focused on
something else. The only sense of shared activity that draws his
audience together is in their watching what we cannot see. The effect is
disquieting and intriguing.
Adamson has not missed the opportunity to exploit the dramatic effects
of artificial lighting and the use of acid greens and pinks is
masterful. In La Coupole his confidence in the use of colour to create
space by the slashes of red in the centre of the composition balanced by
the touches of pale-green flickering across the viewer's flesh, is all
the more disarming in its apparent spontaneity.
The reliance on a careful study of colour and interest in anatomy is
perhaps best revealed in the preparatory sketches which are one of the
strengths of the show. Yet Adamson's commitment to a figurative
tradition is far from moribund. The works are shorn of distracting
narrative and are painterly and powerful.

FOR those of us brought up three and four decades ago on the great,
monumental versions of Bach's St Matthew Passion, John Currie's version
still comes as a cool breeze. Lengthy though it is, Currie packed it in
last night with minimal cuts in near-record time. It's logical thus to
assume that he takes it quickly.
He must, but there's no sensation of haste. Breadth is preserved, and
the sensation is of swiftness, pacy delivery, and strictly no wallowing.
The many chorales contained a clue: Currie doesn't allow phrases to
billow and sink; just momentarily settle then be gathered into the next
line. And all of this without losing the epic scale of the Passion
story.
Two complementary threads knitted together last night's performance:
the voices of the Evangelist and Christ. Jonathan Job, the Evangelist,
has a marvellous lightness of tone, if a little slender. Light and
expressive, he above all kept the thing moving with intimate, almost
conversational delivery. To which Stewart Kempster's Christ -- bronzed,
stately, sonorous and dignified -- was an ideal match.
The John Currie Singers themselves were at strength in ensemble,
tending for the most part to show strain under pressure as soloists,
though there were good contributions, notably from mezzo Colette Ruddy.
Moments of imprecision and uncertainty of pace and definition (from the
orchestra as well as choral soloists) are perhaps inevitable, but they
did occasionally threaten to undermine the confidence and continuity of
the performance.

OVERHEAD, the rain lashed hard against the Tramway roof. It seemed so
appropriate -- an extra wash of melancholy to heighten the piquant
sorrows of Adieu -- you might have imagined New Moves had commissioned
it especially. Not that Francois Raffinot's piece needs anything added
to it. It is a masterly mesh of subtle structures and patterns, full of
tiny connecting details at every level: costuming, lighting, music, and
movement.
The piece has, as a starting point, Rimbaud's poetic vision of vowels
as colours. A: black, E: red and so forth. Five vowels, five sections.
But then Raffinot introduces structural elements from two Haydn
symphonies -- Farewells and Lamentations -- by choreographing
diminution, from a quintet down to a solo against carefully condensing
arenas of light. Meanwhile, other textures are being fed in through the
music, Pascal Dusapin's gloriously anguished Medeamaterial. If this
strikes you as potentialy off-putting, an academic exercise which can
reward only a hard-thinking eagle-eyed cipher-freak, then let me
reassure you and encourage you to see the last performance tonight.
For the cleverest aspect of this exquisite work is the way Raffinot
uses this net of structures to explore and suggest our journey through
life towards death. There are partings and arrivals. One dancer
replacing another in the quintet, but the dance flowing elegantly on.
The final solo, measuring out immediate limits before surrendering
gracefully to stillness, is the best pattern for any farewell --
dignified, and entered into with ready ease.

The future of a Scots cheese hangs in the balance: is it wholesome or
dangerous? Jennifer Cunningham looks at a both sides of the dispute.
A SEMI-HARD Scottish sheep's-milk cheese is turning into a cause
celebre. Small specialist cheesemakers throughout Britain see the battle
for Lanark Blue, condemned by environmental health officers for
containing listeria, as officialdom's Waterloo.
Next Wednesday there will be a judicial review of the case between
Clydesdale District Council and Humphrey Errington, cheesemaker of
Dunsyre. The council claims that if they lose, public health will be at
risk. Errington claims that if he loses, not only will he be bankrupt,
but every small producer of farm cheese in the country will be out of
business.
Listeria is a serious illness which can be fatal and those most
vulnerable are the very young, the very old, pregnant women and others
with depressed immune systems. Lanark Blue is a much-praised new
Scottish cheese (although sheep's milk cheese was once made on most
farms in the Clyde Valley) exported to the US and Hong Kong and said to
be enjoyed by the Queen.
Specialist cheesemakers have already mobilised political allies to
insist that the UK Government applies for a derogation to an EC
directive due to come into force later this year, on the hygiene of milk
products which would allow no listeria monocytogenes, the bacteria in
question, in any food.
The directive provides for derogation of the listeria standard in
respect of cheeses made in a traditional manner (Stilton, Wensleydale
and Lanark Blue are the best-known likely victims) and the UK has said
it will apply.
Dismissed as a nation of consumers of processed, packaged
convenience-foods, belatedly the British are declaring their preference
for home-grown, home-made produce.
''It is a very snobbish assumption that good food is only bought by
the upper middle classes. It is just not true. People of every sort come
to buy our cheese and probably more working class people remember eating
real cheese from their childhood than people in Edinburgh's New Town,''
said Errington, brought up in England as the son of a senior civil
servant, but whose roots are in generations of farming on Mull.
Passionate letters of support, many including cheques: #25 from a
pensioner, #2000 from a customer he's never met, are pouring into
Oggscastle Farm, where Errington has made Lanark Blue and Dunsyre Blue
(a harder cow's milk cheese) for 10 years.
''I've just had a letter from a man in East Kilbride who comes every
three months to buy cheese. He said he likes it and so do thousands of
others, including the Queen, and suggests I appeal to her for help.''
Small-scale cheesemakers naturally exploit their farm-gate image, but
cheesemaking at Oggscastle is a sophisticated process with its own
laboratory where the milk is tested before the process begins. From the
start, Errington has employed a professional cheesemaker.
''One of the things about farmhouse cheeses is that you cannot go from
the farming side straight into the cheesemaking. If I had been feeding
hay to animals, I would have to have a sterile shower before going into
the dairy.''
When environmental health officers found listeria monocytogenes in
samples of Lanark Blue taken from Edinburgh shops, it was taken
seriously by H J Errington and Co. While the EH departments of both
Edinburgh and Clydesdale district councils sent samples for analysis, he
sent samples to an independent laboratory. The council samples all
showed contamination with listeria, while the others all tested negative
or with negligible amounts.
As a result of the independent tests, Errington decided, on January
26, to end his voluntary agreement with the Clydesdale EH department not
to distribute Lanark Blue. The following day they impounded his
remaining stock worth about #54,000 at retail prices.
In despair, Errington took the advice of colleagues in the Specialist
Cheesemakers' Association and contacted Richard North. A former
environmental health officer, Dr North came to public prominence at the
time of the salmonella scare and has since carried out research into
salmonella for his PhD. He is convinced that once again the officers who
apply the regulations have got it wrong.
He appeared as an expert witness for H J Errington and Co when
Clydesdale EH officers applied to have the cheese condemned under the
Food Safety Act. Although the hearing took place in the council chamber
before a JP, Mrs Elizabeth Wilson, the UK's recognised expert on
listeria, Dr Jim McLauchlin of the Public Health Laboratory Service, was
the expert witness for the EH Department.
Faced with being bombarded by scientific arguments, Wilson, after
excluding the press, ruled that each expert should state his case
without being questioned by the other side.
In summary, Dr McLauchlin argued that all strains of listeria are
dangerous while Dr North argued that of the 13 strains (serovariants) of
listeria monocytogenes, only three serovars: 1/2a, 1/2b and 4b, have
been responsible for almost all the illness due to listeria.
The serovar found in Lanark Blue is 3b, from which no case of illness
has ever been recorded. Only one case of illness in the UK and Ireland
has been linked with type 3.
Dr North said: ''Some strains are very virulent and others are not.
There is no readily-available test and they are content to rely on the
assumption that because it encompasses strains which are harmful, it
cannot be said to be harmless.
''It is a very dangerous precedent. What is needed is a practical risk
evaluation for serovar 3b, found in Lanark Blue. More by accident than
design we have done this by unwittingly conducting a mass experiment.
More than 63,000 portions of Lanark Blue were sold during the period in
which it was known to be affected by listeria. If it is so harmful,
surely there would be a connected case of illness by now?
''Yet no case has been associated either with this cheese or this
particular strain of listeria. Indeed the large number of people who
have consumed it without being ill amounts to evidence that Lanark Blue
does not pose a risk to health. It is incumbent on the authorities to
prove that it is. It is not sufficient to rely on an assumption.''
Conceding that not all cases of food poisoning are reported, he argues
that since the more severe the illness the more likely it is to be
reported, and a high proportion of sufferers from listeriosis are severe
cases, it seems inconceivable that there could be an epidemic of
listeriosis as a result of consumption of Lanark Blue without it coming
to the attention of the authorities.
Robert Steenson, principal environmental health officer of Clydesdale
District Council, said: ''Listeria was discovered in Lanark Blue by our
colleagues in Edinburgh District Council from a random sample of cheeses
in shops. They contacted the Scottish Office who put out a food-hazard
warning and since it is made in our district we arranged with Errington
for a withdrawal of the cheese as recommended in our code of practice.
''Neither the Food Safety Act nor the EU Dairy Products Directive
makes a distinction between different strains of listeria monocytogenes.
All we do is follow the guidance of the Public Health Laboratory Service
that if the colony count is over 1000 it is a potential hazard.''
Richard North believes the Department of Health has been caught out by
relying on the fact that the application of the listeria standard has
not caused a problem. He said: ''Listeria is common in the environment
and it commonly occurs in cheese. We need a simple test to determine
whether a particular strain is virulent. If this action is repeated
elsewhere, small cheesemakers are doomed.''

THE Government is using Scotland as a test-bed for line closures and
service cutbacks under its railway privatisation plans, rail union
leader Jimmy Knapp claimed last night.
And now a very big question mark must be raised over the future of
Scotland's rail system north of Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Speaking in East Kilbride, the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers'
general secretary said confirmation that British Rail is to axe some
sleeper and Motorail services north of the Border was ''just straws in
the wind''.
He told a packed public meeting that local authorities, trade unions,
local communities and rail users must unite to make their voices heard
before a wider programme of closures of uneconomic lines was
implemented.
''From the day the Government announced its rail privatisation plans,
we warned that they would mean poorer services and cuts in the
nationwide network,'' he said
''A large part of Scotland's railways has always been vulnerable. This
is partly because of the nature of the social railway to remote areas,
but also because the Government saw Scotland as a handy test-bed for its
privatisation experiments.''
Mr Knapp added that Tuesday's proposal by ScotRail's new director, Mr
John Ellis, for a management-employee buyout was ''quite bizarre''
against that background.
''Mr Ellis is simply carrying out the Government's remit. And the
Government itself is acting like the unscrupulous salesmen for private
pension schemes who were encouraged to con workers a few years ago.
''The outgoing BR board chairman, Sir Robert Reid, had revealed the
truth about privatisation within the past week. As a good Scot, he is
careful where he invests his money.
''If the choice is a butcher's shop or a privatised railway, Sir Bob
will put his money into the butcher's shop. And if the chairman has so
little faith in the business, then why should anyone else want to
invest?''
He said there should be no doubt that privatisation would bring line
closures as well as curtailment of services.
''BR has already carried out surveys on the cost of keeping uneconomic
rural lines open. Those with long memories will remember this is how the
Beeching cuts began in the early 1960s, '' he said.
Mr Knapp earlier planted a tree opposite East Kilbride's civic centre
in memory of John Walker, Scottish organiser of the former National
Union of Railwaymen, who died last year.

Dee Dee Cuddihy discovers that once more youngsters are paying mere
lip service to dental hygiene
TOOTHPASTE. You probably think there isn't much to be said about
toothpaste but that's where you'd be wrong. I spent almost two hours
this week discussing the current state of toothpaste with Professor Ken
Stephen of the Glasgow Dental Hospital and we only scratched the surface
of that topic, so to speak.
Why toothpaste, I hear you ask? Well, you may remember that, last
week, chocolate Easter eggs were put under the microscope in The Herald
and the consensus was that, to minimise any damage that may be done to
readers' teeth as an indirect result of that article, there should be a
follow-up investigation into toothpaste.
In fact, Professor Stephen wasn't the only person who had a lot to say
about toothpaste but as someone who has taken part in numerous
conferences on the subject, in more countries than you or I could shake
a stick at, he is an acknowledged world authority.
But before speaking to the experts, it was time to check out the
merchandise. There has been a virtual explosion of toothpastes on the
market in recent times.
In a survey Which? magazine carried out two years ago, they tested
more than 60 different types -- and that was before the new baking-soda
brands became available in this country.
It did not include an American import called Rembrandt (at #7.75, the
most expensive toothpaste I came across) or the esoteric sounding Vicco.
It costs #1.65 and is made in India from the extracts of 20 different
herbs, roots and barks including Bishop's Weed, Prickly Ash and Bedda
Nut. The manufacturers claim that Vicco is based ''on a recipe from the
ancient Ayurvedic tradition of holistic medicine''.
These days you can get lemon and strawberry-flavoured toothpastes;
toothpastes for sensitive teeth, tartar-control and plaque; toothpastes
that aren't pastes but gels and liquids; toothpastes in pump action
dispensers or with easy squeeze tops.
But most of all -- and most important of all -- you get toothpaste
with fluoride. In fact, only a fraction of the pastes currently
available do not contain fluoride. That's because numerous clinical
trials, some of them undertaken in Glasgow, have now proved beyond doubt
that fluoride does help prevent tooth decay.
Apparently it doesn't do this by forming an invisible protective
shield around healthy teeth but by remineralising the microscopic grazes
that occur every time your teeth are subjected to what Professor Stephen
refers to as an acid attack or a sugar blast.
Sadly, even foods such as bread and potatoes eventually break down
into sugars which attack the teeth. However, if the grazes are allowed
to multiply, untreated, they eventually become the cavities that are
called dental caries.
''Picture a wall being sprayed with machine-gun fire,'' suggests
Professor Stephen to illustrate how acids affect the enamel on our
teeth.
What even conservative members of the dental profession would describe
as a ''dramatic reduction'' in tooth decay over the past 20 years has
been due entirely to the use of fluoride toothpastes.
Professor Stephen says: ''A 1968-69 survey of 13-14-year-olds in
Scotland found that, on average, each youngster had between 11 and 13
teeth that were either decayed, missing or filled. The most recent study
shows that, in the same age group, the figure has dropped dramatically
to an average of only three teeth being decayed, missing or filled.''
The fluoride in the toothpaste ''miracle'' didn't happen overnight,
however. In fact, our present-day fluoride toothpastes were almost 50
years in the making and are far superior to earlier brands, the first of
which was introduced as long ago as 1955.
But the search for really effective tooth-cleaning substance goes back
much longer than half a century. According to Stuart Fischman, Clinical
and Biological Aspects of Dentifrices, a 3500-year-old Egyptian medical
manual, contained a recipe for toothpaste, representing one of the first
historical references to a dentifrice.
A mere 1000 years later, Hippocrates advised that a mixture comprising
one burnt hare's head and ditto that of three mice could be used to
clean teeth and ''give a sweet smell to the breath''.
Patently, we've come a long way from the days of pounded stag horn
(Roman) and fresh urine (used as a mouthwash in 1746).
However, Professor Stephen and his colleagues have noted a disturbing
trend in the incidence of dental decay in very young children in more
recent times. Following the ''dramatic reduction'' in teenage tooth
decay, the past five years have shown a small but steady increase in
tooth decay in Scotland's under fives.
Early reserch indicates that the blame for this may lie with neglected
dentists as well as an increase in snack eating with the teeth being
subjected to more frequent acid attacks than they can stand.
Alistair Swan, a community dental officer with the Ayrshire and Arran
Health Board was so concerned at the level of tooth decay in some
primary school children that, three months ago, he initiated a
toothbrushing scheme in three local nursery schools. The scheme has
already proved so successful that he hopes, eventually, to extend it to
every nursery school in the board's area.
SWAN says: ''In written questionnaires, older children at the primary
schools we were most concerned about always insisted that they brush
their teeth twice a day, which didn't tally with the amount of dental
decay they were finding.
''However, when the same groups of children were questioned
face-to-face in a very informal way, it turned out that 25% never
brushed their teeth at all, or only very rarely.''
Mrs Ailsa Morrant, consultant in dental public health for Greater
Glasgow and Argyll and Clyde Health Boards, says parents should be doing
all they can to encourage young children to clean their teeth thoroughly
at least once a day.
''One thorough brushing is better than a little tickle twice,'' she
advises. ''Supervise the brushing, do it for them or brush your own
teeth along with them. And if you think special children's toothpaste
will help -- there's even a brand with glitter in it now -- I'm all for
it.''
As for food and snacks, Professor Stephen advises us to choose diet
fizzy drinks, crisps (preferably plain or salt-and-vinegar because they
help stimulate saliva production) instead of sweets and to round off
meals with a small cube of Cheddar cheese which ''kicks up'' the
alkaline level in the mouth.

A TEENAGE girl yesterday told of jealous bullies forcing her out of a
top-rated school after her dancing talents were featured on a TV
programme.
Mia Barrett, 15, was happy at the St Thomas More RC High School at
North Shields, Tyne and Wear, which was recently given a Top Ten rating
by Government inspectors.
But everything changed after a Tyne-Tees Television documentary showed
her performing with a local dance troupe touring Spain last summer.
The following morning, several girls at the school conspired to attack
her.
''They got a gang of four or five together and told a friend of mine
they were going to get me,'' said Mia who wants to become a professional
ballet dancer.
She fled to her home in Whitley Bay -- and did not return to the
school for two weeks until persuaded by the head teacher.
But within an hour of being back at her desk, she was kicked by one of
her tormentors and threatened with further violence by the group of 15
and 16-year-olds.
As a result she has since stayed home ever since.
Now after six weeks away from lessons and pleas from her parents,
Colin and Mary, she has been offered a place at Whitley Bay High School.
Her mother said: ''We are in the process of arranging an interview and
hope Mia will be able to start there as soon as possible and resume her
preparations for her important exams next year.
''It would have been better if she could have stayed where she was.
There had been no problem until the bullying began.''
A North Tyneside Council spokeswoman said the girls accused of
bullying Mia had been severely reprimanded.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Office strategy document suggests councils will lose power to decide the issue Quangos to rule over water fluoridation</HEADLINE>

CHANGES which will hand control of Scotland's water to three new
authorities could lead to fluoride being added to the public water
supply, it was claimed yesterday.
A new Scottish Office document makes it clear that, in just over a
year's time, the decision on whether to add fluoride could be taken by
one Government-appointed quango on the advice of another.
From April 1, 1996, the new rules say that Scotland's 15 health boards
will make their proposals to one of the three new water authorities, all
of which are headed by Tory appointees.
Fluoride has not been added to the water supply anywhere in Scotland
because elected councillors have decided against its use, or have not
been asked to consider the issue by local health boards.
In a recent statement the Scottish Home and Health Department claimed
''the existing requirements for public consultation will remain the
same'', but there will be one crucial change.
From next year elected councils will not actually take the decision,
as they have done in the past.
The document, seen by The Herald, says: ''The Government believes that
decisions about this issue (fluoridaton) should be taken at local level
after appropriate consultation.''
It continues: ''Health boards should assess the local case . . . and
where suitable propose to the water authority, at present the local
authority, that supplies be fluoridated.''
A spokeswoman for Fife Health Board, which is due to consider
fluoridation later this year, admitted that it may consider waiting
until Fife region's powers have been removed before making any
recommendation to introduce fluoride.
A spokesman said yesterday: ''We have to decide if it would be more
productive to go to the water board than to the region.''
The whole issue has come to life again because the shifting of
responsibility for providing water, away from councils, has neatly
coincided with the drafting of the Scottish Office document, Oral Health
Strategy for Scotland.
It gives the official Home and Health Department line, which is that
''the only substance that can really affect resistance to tooth-decay at
a practical level is fluoride''.
It states that there is ''overwhelming evidence'' that adding it to
water ''confers a high level of protection from dental decay in the
population''.
Opponents say that water-fluoridation will mean take-it-or-leave-it
mass medication without public consent.
They claim that excess fluoride in the diet causes a disease called
''fluorosis'' which weakens bones and teeth. They also cite a report by
the Medical Research Council which shows there are a greater number of
hip fractures in elderly people who consume a high level of fluoride.
Members of Strathclyde and Highland regional councils refused to add
one part per million of fluoride to the water, despite pressure from
their local health boards to do so, while in Tayside and Grampian the
health boards did not press the issue.
Two years ago Highland councillors voted 19 to 2 to say ''no'', after
a publicly-funded health board campaign was actively countered by the
Highland Movement Against Water Fluoridation.
Its volunteers, headed by two retired water chiefs, Mr David Watson
and Mr Howard Forsyth, gathered a 5500-signature petition.
But, from next year, the Highland Health Board and the new North of
Scotland Water Authority -- which also takes in Tayside, Grampian and
the islands -- will share the same chairman, Mr John Robertson.
Yesterday Mr Forsyth, a former chief water engineer with Inverness
County Council, said that the next move in the fluoride issue was not
difficult to foresee. He alleged that the Government was involved in
''destroying or at least damaging local democracy'' which was leading to
a ''slide down the slippery slope to dictatorship''.
Dental decay affects proportionately more Scots than English and Welsh
people. The Scottish Office strategy intends setting new targets for
improvement and is adamant that fluoridation ''has the potential to make
a substantial impact on oral health and . . . is also the most
cost-effective way of preventing and reducing tooth decay in the
population''.
Last night a Scottish Office spokeswoman said that the existing
requirements for public consultation would remain unchanged.

SCOTTISH higher education chiefs yesterday reacted with anger and
dismay to the allocation of #491m worth of public funding to their
institutions.
They said the funding levels, to support teaching and research in 21
institutions, confirmed the bad news they had been fearing.
Professor John Arbuthnott, convener of the Committee of Scottish
Higher Education Principals, said they were especially grim for smaller
institutions and the teacher training colleges which were not attached
to universities.
He went on: ''Against forecast inflation of more than 3%, the majority
of universities and colleges will have substantially less resources than
last year but, in most cases, they will have to cope with extra student
numbers or face penalties.
''This is expansion on the cheap and will further threaten the ability
of institutions to maintain quality.''
Professor John Sizer, chief executive of the Scottish Higher Education
Funding Council, said resources made available by the Government for the
forthcoming academic year were only about 1% higher than last year's
allocations.
Set against forecast inflation of 3.25%, it was a very tough
settlement, he conceded. Higher education principals sympathised with
the council because it had little room in which to manouevre but,
individually and collectively, they called on the body to stop referring
to cuts as ''efficiency gains''.
Professor Donald Leech, Principal of Queen Margaret College in
Edinburgh, warned that so-called efficiency gains -- which require
institutions to do more with reduced resources -- could result in job
losses.
The college has experienced a funding cut compared with last year
because it ignored advice to limit increases in student numbers in line
with the Government's consolidation policy.
It has been ''fined'' #100,000 and allocated no additional funded
student places in the main funding round. He said: ''Vacancies may not
be filled, but we are hoping that growth in the international and
part-time student areas will allow us to maintain posts.''
Three teacher training institutions which have suffered because of
controls on their intakes have been allocated safety net funding to
prevent damage to their financial viability.
But in future, institutions which are ''safety netted'' two years
running will have to prepare a plan to eliminate dependency on fall-back
funding.
And six other institutions will have a total of about #1m clawed back
from their compensation grants because they did not meet the target of a
5.8% increase in the number of ''fees-only'' students to be recruited in
the year just ending.
Recurrent grant for teaching of #355m plus linked teaching grants
worth #23m will allow 2500 extra funded places across the sector, mainly
in the Government's priority areas of science, engineering, mathematics,
and computing.
The Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, which received the highest
percentage increase in funding, 4.7%, did particularly well in
recruiting students in these areas. Its relative success also reflected
the fact that it is serving the needs of the local economy, as other
North-east institutions are doing.
Institutions will receive more than #96m for research. The increase is
lower than the projected inflation rate but the council believes that
institutions can make up the shortfall.
Scotland's biggest university, Edinburgh, has received better than
average funding but its Principal, Sir Stewart Sutherland, attacked the
Government's policy, which likened ''university education to a
cost-cutting assembly belt''.

Political Editor Geoffrey Parkhouse reveals the behind- the-scenes
power play that looks like bringing the curtain down on Conservative
rule, John Major's leadership, and an accident-prone cast of Ministers
WEALTHY BACKERS TURN BACKS ON DYING GOVERNMENT AS POLL PREDICTS A
CRUSHING BY--ELECTION DEFEAT
THE plight of this Government goes well beyond back-bench grumblings
and threatens to pose a challenge to Mr John Major's leadership this
autumn. If there was a cohesive plot to do Mr Major down, it might be
simpler for him to handle. His various enemies cannot agree on a
candidate to succeed him.
The devastating factor for Mr Major is that Tory backers are already
planning to withhold their money until after Mr Blair forms a Labour
Government. The political market has already discounted for a Tory
defeat.
It is not that these backers, the wealthy men and those that can
disperse corporate finance, are against Mr Blair, as Lord Sterling,
chairman of P &amp; O, divulged to reporters aboard the Prime Minister's
plane returning from the Middle East. Businessmen have to work with any
Government that the electorate returns and the Labour leader's economic
policy, such as it is, does not alarm them at this stage.
The key element in the Government's continuing slump goes profoundly
deeper than that. When Lord Alistair McAlpine, Thatcher confidante and
former Tory deputy chairman and treasurer for all her elections,
declares the Tories need a rest to reform, he is only providing the
catalyst, not the cause, of the Tory malaise.
He told me yesterday: ''What is needed is for the Prime Minister and
all his Ministers to look in the shaving mirror each morning and say to
themselves: 'What can I do today to make the Conservative Party
Conservative again?' This means that they have to return the Government
to the Tory Party. They have to start thinking again with their guts,
instead of Whitehallese jargon which is neither acceptable to the
country at large and to the party in particular.
''I want the Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell -- a former Treasury
Minister -- to stop going around the country telling our people to
forget what they have been told by the Conservative Party for the last
30 years which is to invest in their own homes. He cannot explain how an
ordinary person can go to a bank and ask for a large sum of money to
invest in shares. What Dorrell is saying is just plain rubbish.
''I want our Government to reverse their policy on mortgage tax
relief. I want our Government to start addressing people's real concerns
about their jobs and their security in those jobs. And it goes without
saying that the Government is a 1000 yards away from understanding and
reflecting the Conservative Party's feelings about Europe. The Canadians
attempt to stop the Spanish raping their fishing grounds and what do we
do? We castigate the Canadians for doing so because our Government has
to do what it is told by Brussels.''
Lord McAlpine, who directly represents the beliefs of Mrs Margaret
Thatcher and her wing of the party, insists that Mr Major should not be
dumped by anybody else other than the British electorate. The Herald's
System Three Poll today vividly illustrates the mood of the Tories in
Perth and Kinross who are prepared even for Labour to do better than
them in the coming by-election.
System Three also indicates that, throughout the Tory base vote in
southern England, Scottish devolution is not a problem. Mr Major has
made devolution a vital quotient for the next General Election but the
Northern Ireland situation has fatally flawed this position.
In the Commons, Tory back benchers' morale slumps week by week. They
sense they are on the road to irretrievable disaster and, if the
speculation about a leadership challenge this autumn has any basis at
all, it is founded in individual desperation about how to hold their
seats.
Only Government spokesmen believe that Mr Major can turn the situation
round during a three-week General Election campaign when he is now 40%
behind in the opinion polls. Over the last month, Tory back benchers --
left, right, or centre -- have been talking only about damage limitation
and whether their party can possibly hold on to as many as 150 seats.
Each week, their Cabinet Ministers blunder. On Tuesday, party chairman
Jeremy Hanley accused Labour local authorites of corruption without
being able to specify which councils.
Yesterday, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke dug deeper into the hole that he
warned the Tories two years ago to stop digging themselves into. A
fortnight ago, he described the Consett steel works as the most
efficient in Europe, despite the fact that it has been closed for 15
years. Yesterday, he talked on radio about a nappy factory as being just
as successful when it was shut down in 1991.
It is now accepted throughout the Tory parliamentary party that such
blunders by Cabinet Ministers are the surest sign that their party needs
a rest from the burdens of government. Comparisons are being made with
the final months of the last Callaghan Labour government. This
Government is dead and the only question is now when the funeral will be
made official.
Those who address meetings in the Tory constituencies reflect this
mood precisely. Nobody blames the Prime Minister individually -- except
Lord McAlpine who declares that Mr Major has ''stuffed-up'' the party.
With hindsight, the majority Tory view is that the day that Mrs Thatcher
was dumped as Tory leader with a 93 majority in the Commons and three
election wins under her belt was the day that set the Conservatives on
the route of atonement.
The party's finances are a symbol of this disenchantment which now
seems endemic. There is a #16m debt which has no chance of being
redeemed before the next General Election, although the banks (in
particular the Royal Bank of Scotland) are still prepared to keep
central office out of the bankruptcy courts as long as they can keep
their current account in balance.
Over the past two months, I have spoken privately to wealthy Tories
who are not prepared to redeem their party's debts before a General
Election. On the Prime Minister's visit to Israel this week, I
questioned several of the 29 captains of industry on the trip about the
issue of Tory party funding.
It was as if I had expected them to put their money on a 100-1 shot in
yesterday's Cheltenham Gold Cup. These kind of men say little
specifically but if you read their eyes it tells you a lot. It confirmed
to me what has been fairly obvious over the last year or so -- industry
looks on Mr Major as a loser.
Most Tories are now getting a little wearied by the candour of their
Chancellor, Mr Clarke. When he tells the nation, as he did on Tuesday,
that the ''feel-good'' factor may not return to the British people until
way beyond the next General Election, it is seen as another indication
that Ministers are throwing their arms in the air in surrender.
One south London Tory MP put it like this yesterday. He said: ''There
will not be a leadership challenge in the autumn, no matter how badly we
do in the May local elections. And I'll tell you why -- there is no
fight, there is no spirit. There is only resignation for what is to
come. While I could never agree with Lord McAlpine in public, I can tell
you that he has put the finger precisely on our position. The mood of
the parliamentary party is one of resignation and changing the
leadership would make no difference.''
The disenchantment is spread right across the party at Westminster. A
leadership challenge could not resolve this desperate situation.
The Thatcherites and the Euro-sceptics could not accept a Heseltine or
a Clarke or a Hurd as Mr Major's successor. At the same time, other
factions could not accept a Portillo or a Lilley or a Howard as their
party leader. A leadership contest this autumn would only widen the
split and reduce the Tories' chances of holding on to as many as 150
seats at the next General Election.
There are some, of course, who think Mr Major's European policy is so
distasteful that they would like to punish him personally before a
General Election defeat. The Government Whips wander about
ineffectively, rescued only by the Jopling reforms which have reduced
the Commons more or less to a two-day chamber voting on Government
business on Mondays and Tuesday and again on Wednesdays if Mr Blair
tables a motion threatening to embarrass the Government further.
Yesterday, Lord McAlpine rejoiced in the publicity given to him for
his latest book, out next week, by the party chairman on radio and by
the Prime Minister at question time in the Commons. All Mr Major could
say about Lord McAlpine's challenge was: ''I understand that he is
promoting a book which is a work of fiction.''
Labour back bencher Dennis Skinner carried more credibility when he
warned that the Prime Minister would be ''kicked out like a dog in the
night''. Mr Skinner actually missed the point about the real state of
the Tory party which is that the Prime Minister has to survive to lose
in order that in opposition the Conservatives can reform and rebuild.

THE forthcoming Perth and Kinross by-election offers the prospect of
another slice being cut from the Conservative Government's slim majority
in Westminster. Our System Three poll conducted specifically in the
constituency underlines the Conservatives' weak position.
If the poll's figures were to be reflected on polling day, the SNP
would take the seat with a considerable 25% majority, but not over the
Conservatives -- in fact, over Labour, dramatically pushing the Tories
into third place.
The SNP can feel confident that the furore surrounding the selection
of Roseanna Cunningham as its candidate does not appear to have had an
adverse effect on its level of support, given the fieldwork for the
System Three poll took place after the wide reporting of the so-called
scandal involving Ms Cunningham. Indeed, the party's position of 48%
represents an increase of 12% on its General Election performance in
1992.
Conversely, the Conservatives' share of the potential vote stands at
20%, only half of their 1992 total, when they captured 40%. Scottish
Conservative figures were already looking towards this by-election with
grim faces and this gives them very little from which to take comfort.
The Tories' problems are compounded by the indication that they are
only heading for third place. That would be a disaster for them, in a
seat where only the Conservatives and the SNP have seriously figured
since its creation before the 1983 General Election from the two
previous seats of Kinross and West Perthshire and Perth and East
Perthshire.
Indeed, it is perhaps the Labour Party which has most to be pleased
about if this poll were turned into an actual result. Sitting at 23%,
the Labour share of the potential vote is approaching twice the size of
its share in 1992 when it could only muster 13%.
In fact, Labour has never achieved anything more than 16% in Perth and
Kinross, that figure having been reached at the 1987 General Election.
Such an increase well outstrips the increase from 1992 in Labour's
Scottish share of the potential vote as indicated in recent monthly
polls conducted by System Three.
As Labour would never have expected to win this seat, and in
circumstances where the obvious recipients of anti-Government protest
votes would be the SNP, party bosses in Keir Hardie House can perhaps
begin to think about claiming a modest success themselves.
However, the poll results must be considered in light of the fact that
no date has yet been set for the by-election and therefore the real
campaign has yet to start.
It may well be the case that if decisions about tactical voting are to
be made, they may well be made far nearer polling day. In the poll, 16%
of potential voters were still undecided. Will the campaign therefore be
the crucial time for the eventual result?
The campaign, once it does get off the ground, has been billed as a
head-to-head battle between the Union and independence, and indeed this
is a unique by-election that puts the Conservatives and SNP together as
the main combatants.
However, the message from the System Three poll in terms of issues on
the doorstep is far removed from such gladiatorial predictions. Three in
every four electors made some preference about which issues were
important in the run-up to polling day.
There appears to be bad news for those expecting a constitutional
showdown, as the most frequently cited issues were the NHS,
unemployment, and education. Far down the list came the constitutional
question. Even among potential SNP voters the constitutional issue did
not rate strongly.
This is disappointing for Alex Salmond's party which is perhaps
heading for a large, but hollow, victory. These figures certainly lend
weight to the argument that the SNP is winning votes but failing to win
converts to its cause.
This consistent problem for the SNP is more fully underlined when
potential voters in Perth and Kinross were asked which constitutional
options are favoured. Among potential SNP voters support for
independence or devolution was split right down the middle, with 46%
supporting one or the other.
In other words, Mr Salmond has yet to fully convince his own
supporters over the merits of independence. During 1994, when the SNP
gained excellent results in both the regional council elections and the
subsequent European elections, the party's mood was bolstered by a
belief that it was beginning to turn opinion positively towards
independence.
What the System Three poll suggests is that the SNP may win the battle
of Perth and Kinross but it is still some way from winning the war.
Perhaps not surprisingly, devolution features strongly as the
preferred option among both potential Labour and Liberal Democrat
voters. Even among potential Tory voters support for devolution is as
high as 40%.
In a largely rural constituency with strong traditional Conservative
Party roots, this figure makes particularly interesting reading. Even
loyal Tories may now have had enough of their party's stubborn
resistance to any form of constitutional reform.
Senior Tory figures have as good as conceded defeat in this
by-election, but are looking to capture the seat back at the next
General Election.
However, if the System Three poll becomes the actual result, it would
represent a 16% swing from the Conservatives to the SNP based on the
1992 General Election result. This is higher than the 11.5% swing the
Liberal Democrats achieved in the 1991 Kincardine and Deeside
by-election.
The Tories achieved an 11% swing in 1992 in Kincardine and Deeside and
regained the seat. If they were to lose Perth and Kinross by the margin
suggested then they would require at least a 14% swing back to regain
the seat. In other words, the Tories would need a better performance
than they managed in regaining Kincardine and Deeside.
Looking at the wider political context, there is mixed news for the
SNP and Liberal Democrats, good news for Labour, and yet further bad
news for the Conservatives.
The SNP will greet the System Three poll as pointing to a substantial
victory for the party. But however much Alex Salmond presses on the
constitutional issue it is clear that voters' concerns still lie
strongly in the day-to-day issues affecting them.
For the Liberal Democrats, a result similar to their 1992 General
Election performance is only realistic. This is simply not their
territory. Labour would do well to achieve any result beyond its General
Election result, as this would serve to underline its superiority in the
overall Scottish standings.

THE ex-girlfriend and a sister of Mr Andrew Wylie told a court
yesterday how his personality disintegrated in the months before he
killed a doctor in his Airdrie surgery.
Stirling University graduate Wylie, 33, is on trial at the High Court
in Glasgow for the alleged murder of Dr Donald MacKay.
Mr Wylie's defence counsel, Mr Gordon Jackson, has not contested the
evidence that he stabbed the doctor to death.
The jury has been told that the main question is whether Mr Wylie was
suffering at the time from a mental illness which diminished his
responsibility for the killing.
Yesterday librarian Mary Datillie, 35, of Dunbeg Avenue, Coatbridge,
who lived with Mr Wylie for three-and-a-half years, went into the
witness box after conflicting evidence from psychiatrists.
One, Dr Isobel Campbell, claimed that Mr Wylie, who is said to have
killed the doctor in revenge for the death of another sister, Ann, from
cancer, was suffering from mental illness.
Another, Dr John Baird, said Mr Wylie was not mentally ill, but a man
with a short fuse and a paranoid personality.
Yesterday Ms Datillie told the court that Mr Wylie had mood swings
during the last months of their relationship.
She added: ''I felt I was walking on eggshells. I was continually
going home at nights wondering what his moods would be like.
''He seemed to be paranoid and thought no one liked him and that
everyone was talking about him.''
Ms Datillie told Mr Jackson that Mr Wylie's mood swings began to
become more and more regular in the build up to the breakdown of their
relationship just four months before the doctor's death last October.
She told the court that, on the night before they split up, Mr Wylie
went into the street to challenge a neighbour because he thought he was
talking about him.
Later that night, Ms Datillie said she told him she couldn't cope with
the way he was, and that she was ending their relationship.
She said: ''He went into the living room and I heard a smash. He had
smashed the graduation picture of himself and me with a tennis ball.
''Then he calmly went into the kitchen and made a bowl of cornflakes.
As I cleaned up, he gave me verbal abuse and slapped me across the
face.''
Ms Datillie described how she ran out of the house and, seconds later,
how Mr Wylie smashed another neighbour's car windows with a hammer.
Earlier, Mr Wylie's sister, sales executive Mrs Ellen Rooney, 34, of
Rowanlea, Airdrie, told of her brother's grief after the death of their
sister Ann from cancer just before Christmas, 1986.
He, like the rest of the family, believed her death could have been
prevented.
Mrs Rooney said her brother got very depressed because he couldn't get
a job.
Mrs Rooney said she was so concerned with his mood swings, lack
ofconcentration, and aggressive outbursts that she wrote to their family
doctor asking if he could get psychiatric treatment.
An appointment was made, but Mr Wylie did not keep it.
The trial was adjourned until Monday.

<HEADLINE>Hospital death brings call for guidelines Sheriff urges inquiry into intensive care</HEADLINE>

A SHERIFF yesterday called for an immediate investigation into
intensive care units at hospitals all over Scotland.
Sheriff John McGowan said that national guidelines on the number of
beds available and the nurses to staff them should be issued and acted
upon as a matter of urgency.
His recommendations follow the death of Mr James McGowan, 67,a retired
miner, of Prosen Street, Tollcross, Glasgow, at Glasgow Royal Infirmary
on January 29 last year.
A fatal accident inquiry into Mr McGowan's death heard at Glasgow
Sheriff Court that, because of staff shortages, there was no intensive
care unit bed available and doctors delayed his operation. The five beds
in the Royal's ICU were occupied and there was no staff to look after
the two extra beds available.
The inquiry also heard that doctors tried for over an hour to find
another hospital with an intensive care bed available without success.
When his condition deteriorated, they had to operate, but Mr McGowan
died on the operating table.
Last night, the Scotish Office said it would study the sheriff's
findings closely and take any appropriate action that may be necessary.
In a written judgment Sheriff McGowan said the patient died from a
ruptured aneurysm in his abdominal aorta.
Mr McGowan, a widower, would have had a 20 to 30% chance of survival
if he had been operated on immediately and then given intensive care. By
the time another hospital phoned to say it had a bed, it was too late.
During the inquiry, Mr Gerald Carroll, advocate for the dead man's
family,said: ''Mr McGowan trusted in the National Health Service, two of
his daughters are nurses, and it is not acceptable that a major hospital
failed to look after him.''
Mr Carroll told the inquiry that, on the day Mr McGowan died, six
patients could not get an intensive care bed, and four of them had died.
Sheriff McGowan said doctors at the hospital had continually expressed
concern about the lack of intensive care beds and staff.
A senior vascular consultant, Mr John Pollock, told the inquiry he had
told senior management for several years that the number of intensive
care beds was inadequate.
The day Mr McGowan died, four ICU nurses were off sick, and there was
no trained staff who could be called on.
Sheriff McGowan said there was evidence that the number of special
beds was inadequate before Mr McGowan died.
He said Mr McGowan's death had brought matters to a head, and it was
to be hoped there would be no delay in carrying out his recommendations.
The sheriff said: ''Central government should fully investigate the
situation regarding intensive care beds throughout Scotland. National
guidelines should be issued and acted upon as a matter of urgency.
''It is for central government to find out how many staffed intensive
care beds are needed nationwide and to ensure that these are provided,''
he said.
Sheriff McGowan also recommended that a central point should be set up
giving the number of ICU beds available at any one time so that doctors
would not have to waste vital time phoning around.
Mr Richard Lobjoie, the instructing solicitor for the McGowan family,
said last night: ''The family is happy that the sheriff has identified
the flaws in the system and what we need now is Government action to
redress the situation.  ''Their main concern throughout has been to try
to prevent a repetition of what happened to their father.''
A spokesman for Glasgow Royal Infirmary said: ''We have received the
report and will be affording it careful consideration.''

THE release from prison of convicted killer George Beattie, who has
always maintained his innocence, was reduced to farce yesterday, with
some of his principal campaigners -- including his brother -- left
standing as he sped from the jail in a car driven by an unidentified
woman.
Campaigners for Beattie's release were quick to accuse authorities at
Edinburgh's Saughton Prison of gagging him, as he left the jail just
before 7am without talking to waiting reporters.
However, solicitor advocate Mr Joe Beltrami later said he had told his
client not to speak to the press.
Beattie's older brother Bill, 51, and broadcaster Mr Peter Hill, who
has campaigned 14 years for his release, were left in Beattie's wake as
the car left the prison. They had been expecting to pick him up and take
him to his Lanarkshire home.
In the event, he appeared at a ''safe house'' a short time after being
paroled, before holding an impromptu press conference in the company of
his brother and Mr Hill at his mother's home in Carluke.
Arriving in Carluke, Beattie, 40, told reporters: ''It's great to be
back in the fresh air,'' but declined further comment.
Beattie was sentenced to life in 1973, after being found guilty of the
murder of Lanarkshire typist Margaret McLaughlin. Following his
conviction at the age of 19, he spent 15 of the past 22 years in prison.
He was first paroled in 1986, but sent back to prison six years later
after a minor offence. In January 1994, he was released again pending an
appeal, but when the legal move failed in December, he went back to
prison again.
Beattie spent most of yesterday in the company of a team from the BBC
current affairs programme Frontline Scotland, which is planning to show
a programme on his case later this month. It is understood the programme
will include new evidence from more than two policemen who were involved
in the case.
He later travelled by car to Birmingham where he is expected to appear
today on BBC's Good Morning programme.

OFFICIALS from the Inland Revenue yesterday played their cards close
to their chest when they gave evidence to a Commons committee which is
investigating ''shamateurism'' in rugby union.
The Revenue confirmed it is looking into the payments to players in
football, rugby league and rugby union, but made clear it was not
prepared to name any individuals who are being investigated or say how
long the inquiry would take.
In a written submission to the Commons National Heritage Committee,
and in oral evidence, the officials made clear what they regarded as
legitimate expenditure.
The key is profit. If, for example, a payment did no more than
reimburse a player for expenses incurred in travelling to and from the
match, the cost of kit or medical insurance, it would not be taxable.
However, where such payments were found to be more than were needed to
reimburse the player for such expenses, the Revenue would take the view
that the player was making a profit from carrying out the sporting
activity concerned.
Labour MP John Maxton (Glasgow Cathcart) expressed concern about the
trust funds into which rugby union players and others now are allowed to
pay their earnings.
Mr Maxton raised questions over a situation in which a player was
paid, for example, #10,000 to open a supermarket. If he paid it into a
trust fund, would it be taxable and was this an area the Revenue was
looking at, he asked.
Mr John Gribbon, director of the Revenue's business profits division,
replied that this was a complex area, but he added: ''We have been well
aware of the use of trusts in sport for many years.''
Mr Maxton also asked about ''boot money,'' the long-standing practice
under which rugby players allegedly find a few hundred pounds placed in
one of their boots before they go out on to the field.
Mr Gribbon said he was unaware of any prosecutions for this, but Mr
Maxton came back: ''Do you believe it goes on?''Mr Gribbon replied:
''That is part of the inquiry at the moment.''

CONSTABLES sitting on either side of the prisoner in the dock would
need to find something else to do under an amendment to the Criminal
Justice Bill tabled by Labour yesterday.
Home Affairs spokesman John McFall wants to do away with the police
presence in Scottish courts, claiming that their presence is rarely
necessary and that their time could be better used out on the streets
fighting crime.
Under Mr McFall's amendment, police on hand to guard accused would be
discharged only with the approval of the court.
''The accused should be entitled to be seen by the jury without the
presumptive indicators of guilt that the police presence provide,'' he
said.
Mr McFall has written to all the Scottish constabularies for details
of the number of courtroom disturbances involving accused. In the past
five years, Tayside has reported one case, Grampian five, Fife one,
Dumfries and Galloway two, and Strathclyde five.
Other amendments proposed by Labour yesterday for the committee stage
of the Bill -- which begins next Tuesday -- include a measure to create
a legal quango.
Mr McFall said the Sentencing Commission for Scotland would serve to
smooth out anomalies in the sentencing of those with similar criminal
records in different parts of the country.
Appointments to the commission would be the responsibility of the
Scottish Secretary. Labour proposes that it be made up of one member of
the Faculty of Advocates, one member of the Law Society for Scotland, a
sheriff, a prison governor, and at least one representative of a
victims' organisation.
Another amendment would require the High Court and all courts of
summary jurisdiction to set up victim liaison system to keep victims
informed of the progress of a case and to provide support both during
and after a court appearance.
Mr McFall will propose that the Criminal Appeals Bill for England and
Wales be adopted for Scotland.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has appointed a committee under Professor
Stuart Sutherland, of Edinburgh University, to investigate appeals in
Scotland and report back by mid-1996.
''The chances of them reporting and having something similar to the
appeals Bill for Scotland by the next General Election is minimal.
Scotland will be at least two years behind the rest of the country on
appeals,'' he said.
HOME Secretary Michael Howard was warned yesterday against plans to
abandon the need for probation officers to be trained in social work in
a bid to attract a wider range of applicants to the service south of the
Border.
Probation officers used yesterday's face-to-face meeting with Mr
Howard at their national conference in London to emphasised their
unhappiness with the Home Office plans.
As Mr Howard entered, critics voiced strong reservations about his
green paper, unveiled on Wednesday, which intends to reform community
sentencing to give magistrates more power to decide how an offender
should be dealt with.

WE ALL have days when everything seems to go wrong. John Major just
has more of them.
He awoke yesterday to suggestions by a former party treasurer that a
spell of opposition might do the Tories good, and a press report that
senior party figures (unnamed) were planning to hand him the black spot
if Tory local election losses this spring exceed 1000 seats.
Just to complete his day, his Chancellor had suggested that the voters
might not be feeling good until the next century, which, as an election
must be held by April 1997, had cast most of the party into a great
despond.
This was all elegantly encapsulated in the Commons by Mr Dennis
Skinner, who told Mr Major he was likely to be ''kicked out like a dog
in the night''. This seemed more of a philosophical reflection on the
way Tories treat waning leaders than an indication of how the Skinners
treat the family pooch.
Mr Major gamely and correctly retorted that they had been saying that
sort of thing about him for years. He gamely, but perhaps a little more
dubiously, added that he would be here next year, the year after that,
and the year after that.
Twitted about Lord McAlpine's little fusillade, which also accused him
of ''stuffing up'' the party, Mr Major rejoined: ''I understand he is
promoting a book which is a work of fiction.''
He was replying to Labour left-winger Mr Chris Mullin who, in a
solicitous reference to Lord McAlpine's recommendation of a collective
rest cure for the Conservatives, called it ''one of the rare occasions
on which the interests of the Tory Party and the nation coincide''.
Mr Blair was firing comparatively light shot with his reminder that
next month cuts in mortgage relief and the married couple's allowance
will make the fabled average family #250 a year worse off.
As Mr Major ploughed through his litany of economic success -- economy
growing, exports up, current account in surplus, investment rising,
unemployment falling -- it was a wonder he did not give up and collapse
weeping on top of his despatch box.
For such a clutch of economic indicators all heading in the right
direction many of his predecessors would have given their eye teeth, yet
what is his reward? -- 30 points behind in the opinion polls and a
Chancellor who implies that the Sixth Cavalry will arrive only after the
Indians have massacred all the settlers.
Earlier, Mr Ashdown had slung in a low blow about the 36% increase in
the Government's entertaining bill. Given what they have been through,
Ministers might, I think, be forgiven if they emptied the drinks
cupboard frequently and kept large stocks of comfort food on hand.
Reports that Mr Michael Heseltine had been telling the party to ''keep
its nerve'' may not have cheered Mr Major all that much either. For a
more immediate concern than the electorate for the Prime Minister must
be the distinct lack of a feel- good factor among his back benchers. If
it persists, they could beat the voters to kicking him into the
political night.

GAS companies face a dramatic increase in the cost of using the St
Fergus terminal rather than English ones to land North Sea gas, SNP
leader Alex Salmond warned yesterday.
Mr Salmond claims information from Shell Oil shows that a new charging
system planned by the British Gas distribution company Transco will
discriminate against Scotland, putting jobs and future billion-pound gas
developments at risk.
''Under the new charging system drawn up by Transco, gas entering the
network at St Fergus would cost thirty times more than gas entering in
England,'' he said.
Mr Salmond is to launch a campaign to stop what he describes as the
Great Gas Robbery, and he will raise the matter at British Gas's annual
meeting in May.

THE Prime Minister yesterday categorically denied any suggestion that
Western intelligence agencies made a deal with Middle East terrorists
resulting in the Lockerbie bombing.
Mr Major insisted at Commons Question Time that the idea was ''utterly
and completely unfounded''.
He was replying to Labour's Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow), a long-standing
critic of the handling of the investigation into the December 1988
outrage in which 270 people were killed.
Mr Dalyell had asked Mr Major if light could be shed ''on the
agreement reached by Western intelligence with terrorist elements in the
Middle East about the downing of just one airliner rather than 10 or 12
in what was described as'the rain of blood'.''
The Prime Minister replied that the Lockerbie investigation was the
largest criminal investigation ever undertaken in the UK.
He said the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger or Earlsferry, had only ever
discovered credible evidence against the two Libyans accused of the
bombing.
''If concrete new evidence were brought forward, it would of course be
fully investigated.''
He told Mr Dalyell: ''The point you raise that Western intelligence
agencies would enter into a deal with terrorist groups to allow the
destruction of an aircraft is utterly and completely unfounded.
''It did not happen, and you can be assured upon that point.''
Later, in questions on next week's Commons business, Mr Dalyell called
for a ministerial statement setting out the evidence for the West's
naming of the two Libyans as chief Lockerbie suspects.
Mr Major's response to him had been ''long, courteous and
considered'', he told Commons Leader Tony Newton.
''But, in the circumstances, could there not be a statement from the
Law Officers, particularly the Crown Office in Scotland, producing what
the Prime Minister called 'concrete evidence' that these Libyans had
anything to do with it?''
He added: ''Mr Major challenges us to produce concrete evidence.
''This is very difficult, and we don't think the Crown Office is in
any better a position.
''Isn't it time they made a statement in some kind of democratic forum
as to what the basis of their evidence is?''
Mr Newton said he would reflect on Mr Dalyell's remarks.

LABOUR is hoping to provoke a fresh Tory rebellion next week by
tabling a Commons amendment attacking the Common Agricultural Policy --
prime target of the Euro-sceptics.
The new bid to expose splits in Tory ranks over Europe will come as
MPs hold their annual debate on CAP prices on Tuesday.
Shadow Agriculture Minister Dr Gavin Strang said he would be tabling
an amendment to the Government motion criticising the CAP and the
Government's alleged failure to address the need for reform.
Labour is planning to impose a strict ''three line whip'' on its MPs
-- obliging them to turn up to vote.
Britain spends about #2 bn a year on the CAP, and reform of the system
has been one of the top demands of the nine Tory Euro-rebels and of
other Euro-sceptics.
Labour will be calling for a reduction in spending on the CAP by two
thirds through ending state intervention buying of agricultural products
and an end to export subsidies.
The money saved would be used to support rural employment and
protection of the environment and wildlife habitats.
However, Dr Strang said the party supported the CAP system of direct
payments to farmers.
''We will be attacking the Government's failure to seriously address
the need for reform of the CAP over the last five to 10 years,'' he
said.
Eight of the Euro-rebels demanded total abolition of the CAP in their
mini-manifesto.
Mr John Wilkinson, rebel MP for Ruislip-Northwood, said the eight
would want to see Labour's amendment before deciding which way to vote.
''Reform is inadequate. We want repatriation of agricultural policy.
The CAP was a complete error because it has been an incubus on the
British people,'' he said.

Rome, Thursday
ITALIAN Prime Minister Lamberto Dini narrowly won a do-or-die
confidence vote today and got his emergency budget through the lower
house of parliament despite bitter opposition from his predecessor
Silvio Berlusconi.
Supporters of Dini's two-month-old government stood and applauded in
Italy's lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, as Speaker Irene Pivetti
announced he had survived the confidence vote by 315 to 309 with one
abstention.
A substantial number of the 38 MPs from the Communist Refoundation
party allowed Dini to win by voting with him despite party leadership
orders to vote against.
Dini sought the confidence vote in a move to strip away a rash of
amendments to his #8000m mini-budget. He warned that the amendments
would wreck efforts to tackle Italy's chaotic finances and plunge the
country into crisis.
Defeat would have forced him to resign and left President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro with little choice but to dissolve Parliament and order the
snap General Election that Berlusconi has been demanding since he was
forced to resign in December.
Dini, a former central banker and Treasury Minister under Berlusconi,
went on to win a vote on the budget Bill itself by 315 votes to 303. It
now goes for a final vote in the Senate, where Dini has more certain
support.
The battered lira sank to a record low of 1228 to the Deutschmark
before the start of today's debate, but strengthened later.
Media mogul Berlusconi, toppled when one of his coalition partners
walked out of his government, committed his conservative Freedom
Alliance to vote ''No'' to Dini in order to oppose to what he called a
''crime against the credibility of democratic institutions''.
Amid cheers and jeers at a stormy session marked by at least one brief
fight he said political parties he defeated in a general election a year
ago were hiding behind Dini to delay a return to the ballot box.
Dini has said he will step down once his programme is enacted. He
believes the last item, reform to the costly pensions system, could be
passed by the end of April.
The resignation then of his ''government of experts'', drawn from
outside Parliament, could clear the way for the election that most
observers believe is likely some time this year.
Umberto Bossi, the man whose Northern League felled Berlusconi, said
after the confidence vote: ''This vote has put back elections. It has
bought time to provide what the country needs, and that is
rules.''--Reuter.

From NICHOLAS POWELL in Paris
A LARGER, more efficiently run European Union based on the
''backbone'' of the Franco-German relationship was called for yesterday
by Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist candidate in the forthcoming French
presidential election.
In a speech to the Gaullist RPR party, tinged with patriotic sentiment
and respectful references to the memory of General de Gaulle, Mr Chirac
said it was necessary to ''reconcile the French with one another on
Europe and reconcile the French with Europe''.
Without saying when such expansion would be practical, Mr Chirac also
said the construction of Europe must extend to the former Eastern bloc
countries: ''It is a moral and political duty . . . and an essential
condition for peace on our continent.''
Greater harmony of national policies within Europe was necessary, Mr
Chirac said, but security and foreign policies as laid out in the Treaty
of Maastricht proved patently insufficient. Worse, the treaty, which had
been only ''a small step in the right direction'', had worsened the
divorce between ''technocratic Europe'' and its peoples.
Mr Chirac insisted on the future importance of the Franco-German
relationship within Europe, which must ''form the backbone of future
economic and monetary union''. He said his priority with Chancellor Kohl
of Germany would be to establish a common Franco-German policy for next
year's inter-governmental conference.
Mr Chirac proposed a reinforcement of the role played by the Council
of Ministers and the institution of a president, designated for three
years by the European Council.
* An opinion poll published yesterday placed Mr Chirac ahead of his
rivals in the race with 28% in first-round voting, with 21% for
Socialist Lionel Jospin and 16% for conservative Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur.

Johannesburg, Thursday
A BRITON has been charged with the murders of two black men whose
bodies were found buried on a farm used for training neo-Nazi
paramilitaries.
Tyrone Chadwick, 36, who led police to the graves on a farm near
Johannesburg last weekend, had appeared before magistrates in the town
of Heidelberg. He did not enter a plea.
The men had apparently been shot at point-blank range.
Chadwick, quoted by police as saying he was a former British soldier
who trained right-wing hit squads for the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement (AWB) and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, was arrested
with two unnamed Britons, who were freed after questioning.
Another man, who police said was an AWB member, was expected to appear
before magistrates in Heidelberg later in connection with the deaths.
Police searched the farm, where they found a military-style assault
course, a shooting range and firing trenches, but no evidence to support
reports of other bodies.
Chadwick, from Nuneaton in Warwickshire, who had lived in South Africa
for about two years, had told police he lied to a British newspaper
about the existence of more bodies on the farm.
Inkatha, a junior partner in South Africa's national unity government,
has denied any involvement in training at the farm and the AWB has not
made any public comment.
The farm's owner, Mario Res, said AWB members had trained there for
three years before the last elections.--Reuter.

Four scandals in seven years 'about average', Marseille manager tells
court
From PATRICK VIGNAL Valenciennes, Thursday
A SORDID court battle over match-rigging allegations involving
flamboyant football boss turned MP Bernard Tapie has cast a pall over
soccer's image in France.
''So that's what soccer is like?'' presiding judge Bernard Langlade
let slip recently as he listened, wide-eyed, to often tawdry testimony
on an alleged bribery scheme and the subsequent cover-up.
Tapie, former chairman of the Marseille team, former Cabinet Minister,
and a member of the French and European parliaments, is one of six on
trial for alleged bribery in a key 1993 league match between Marseille
and the Valenciennes team.
Each faces up to three years in jail if convicted of fixing the match,
the outcome of which enabled the team to go on to win the European Cup
days later.
A self-made millionaire as well as a leading figure in politics and
sports, Tapie has since been declared bankrupt in court, a ruling that
if upheld on appeal will derail his political career by barring him from
public office for five years.
In his testimony Tapie has played down the power of money in the
sport.
''It's a bit anecdotal,'' he said of trial evidence suggesting soccer
is suffering from a general malaise. ''Everything is relative. There
have been no deaths.''
While boss at Marseille, Tapie said: ''I have been implicated in four
scandals in seven years. That makes me about average.''
Marseille was demoted to the second division over the scandal.
Tapie has denied any involvement in a bribery scheme or a subsequent
cover-up, insisting that he is the innocent victim of a plot by
political foes to silence him by having him locked up.
However former Valenciennes coach Boro Primorac testified today that
Tapie had offered him cash and a new job in June 1993 if he would agree
to alter his testmony to help exonerate the Marseille chairman.
''As I left the meeting, I was shocked, I was awed. I kept my eyes on
the pavement. But I knew I was going to refuse because I was an honest
man,'' Primorac said.
Tapie, appearing ill at ease as he listened to the account, rejected
the accusation, denying later that he had even met Primorac on the day
in question.
Earlier in the trial, Jean-Pierre Bernes, the Marseille club's former
director general and a close Tapie associate, testified that Tapie
personally hatched the match-rigging scheme on his yacht six days before
Marseille won the European cup.
It was uncovered only when an envelope containing F250,000 (#33,000)
was found buried in the garden of a Valenciennes player's aunt.
Primorac also knew about the bribery, threatening to expose it unless
Marseille agreed to a counter-proposal -- to settle for a draw in the
key match rather than a win, Bernes said.
The trial, which opened on Monday, has gripped France with its
sensational charges levied by revered sporting figures.
Interest has been stoked by this week's arrest three top players in
Britain, Bruce Grobbelaar, John Fashanu, and Hans Segers, as inquiries
continue into similar allegations of bribery and match-rigging.
* Le Monde newspaper reported today that French arms makers paid
#1300m in bribes last year to secure weapons contracts abroad.
It quoted unnamed former French intelligence chiefs as saying that,
contrary to popular belief, the biggest bribes went to officials in
industrialised democratic countries rather than those in backwater Third
World dictatorships.
The report comes as controversy rages in Belgium over alleged
corruption in defence contracts involving Italian helicopters and French
electronics warfare equipment.

Washington, Thursday
SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams met President Bill Clinton for the first
time today and they had what Adams called a positive and cordial talk.
The head of the IRA's political wing has been a focus of Mr Clinton's
drive to advance the peace process in Northern Ireland. He told
reporters after the meeting that he had commended Mr Clinton for his
efforts.
The meeting, said by Mr Adams to have lasted four or five minutes,
took place at a St Patrick's Day lunch hosted by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich at which Irish Prime Minister John Bruton was guest of honour.
Mr Bruton and Mr Adams are to attend a St Patrick's Day party at the
White House tomorrow.
Mr Clinton has taken a high profile role in seeking to advance
Northern Ireland peace. After allowing Mr Adams to visit the United
States last year, he moved further last week by allowing the Sinn Fein
leader to undertake fund-raising here.
His move, popular among the politically important Irish-American
community, caused irritation in London amid press reports that the
transatlantic ''special relationship'' was dead. The Irish Government,
however, sees the moves as advancing the peace process.
At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that Mr
Clinton would have a telephone talk with Prime Minister John Major this
weekend to discuss Northern Ireland, the Middle East peace process, and
other issues.
''I don't know that they'll spend much time talking about Gerry Adams.
I mean, that will be over and done with at that point,'' said Mr
McCurry, who has previously appeared to dismiss British concerns at Mr
Clinton's Northern Ireland involvement.
Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who accompanied Mr
Adams at a news conference after the lunch, said applause erupted
spontaneously when Mr Adams and Mr Clinton shook hands.
He said Mr Clinton at one point raised his fist in the air and said:
''This is going to work.''
Although the lunch was private, the press was allowed in briefly.
Reporters heard Irish tenor Mark Forrest sing ''Danny Boy'' -- and
watched Mr Bruton and former House Speaker Thomas Foley sing quietly
along with him.
Mr Adams told reporters that Mr Clinton did not talk about the
decommissioning of IRA weapons and did not expect to discuss this at the
White House.
He said that all weapons, in the hands of the IRA, the Unionists, and
the British Army, had to be removed: ''It means a total demilitarisation
of the situation.''
He said his party was ready to enter into talks with the Government at
ministerial level but Britain had banned such contact.
''I would appeal to Mr Major . . . to start real peace talks,'' he
said.
Last night Mr Adams was the host at a #125-a-plate fundraiser in New
York expected to raise #50,000 for Sinn Fein's new Washington lobbying
office.
However, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke said Mr
Clinton had ''taken a risk'' by allowing Sinn Fein fund-raising and
warned: ''The ball is in their court now to show that they are serious
about removing the gun from the political arena in Northern
Ireland.''--Reuter.

Valenciennes, Thursday
FLAMBOYANT football boss turned MP Bernard Tapie, accused of
match-rigging as chairman of the Marseille team, today played down the
power of money in the sport.
''It's a bit anecdotal,'' he said of evidence at his trial suggesting
that soccer was suffering from a general malaise. ''Everything is
relative. There have been no deaths.''
While boss at Marseille, Tapie said: ''I have been implicated in four
scandals in seven years. That makes me about average.''
The former Cabinet Minister, a member of the French and European
parliaments, is one of six on trial for alleged bribery in a key 1993
league match between Marseille and the Valenciennes team.
Each faces up to three years in jail if convicted of fixing the match.
Marseille was demoted to the second division over the scandal.
Tapie has denied any involvement in a bribery scheme or a subsequent
cover-up, insisting that he is the innocent victim of a plot by
political foes to silence him by having him locked up.
However former Valenciennes coach Boro Primorac testified today that
Tapie had offered him cash and a new job in June 1993 if he would agree
to alter his testimony to help exonerate the Marseille chairman.
A self-made millionaire as well as a leading figure in politics and
sports, Tapie has since been declared bankrupt in court, a ruling that
if upheld on appeal will derail his political career by barring him from
public office for five years.--Reuter.

THE eldest son of Saddam Hussein, Odai, has been wounded in a Baghdad
assassination attempt, Kurdish rebels said today amid widening reports
of unrest and military moves across Iraq.
A radio station run by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of the
main Kurdish factions opposed to Saddam, said Iraq's Defence Minister,
General Ali Hassan al-Majid, survived another attack while visiting the
northern oil city of Kirkuk.
They said both assassination attempts occurred in the last 48 hours.
The radio was quoted by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency,
which is monitored in Nicosia.
Odai, 31, was apparently shot by several gunmen firing assault rifles
in a Baghdad ambush. He was in hospital with serious wounds, the radio
said.
Al-Majid, who is Saddam's cousin, was the target of a soldier who was
part of his security escort, Irna said.
Several of al-Majid's bodyguards were killed, but he escaped without a
scratch, the reports said.
There was no independent confirmation of the attacks and no word from
Baghdad.
The claims follow reports by Iraqi dissidents of unrest in Baghdad and
the trouble-plagued south since the beginning of the month.
The Patriotic Union has been clashing with Iraqi forces in the north
for two weeks.
Opposition sources said last week that there had been a coup attempt
in Baghdad earlier this month.
US State Department officials say they are keeping a close eye on
large-scale troop deployments in Iraq and say there have been signs of
mounting tension in the country.--AP.

JOHN MAJOR and President Clinton will seek to patch up their
differences during a telephone conversation this weekend -- after the
President last night shook hands with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in
Washington.
Downing Street sources sought to play down any suggestion that Mr
Major earlier had snubbed Mr Clinton by refusing to take a call, and
said that, by speaking at the weekend, the two men would be able to
''look back at the week's events''
A spokesman said: ''If you look back at the pattern of phone calls
between the two men over the past, a good proportion of them take place
over the weekend. It enables them to have rather more extensive and
relaxed talks.''
The meeting between Mr Adams and the President clearly has irritated
Downing Street, but some of the efforts by the Clinton administration to
build bridges with Britain over Mr Adams's fund-raising visit are
beginning to go down well in London.
President Clinton's tougher stand -- in which he has put pressure on
Mr Adams to start pushing the IRA to give up its weapons -- may have
helped to heal the rift over what had looked like a rather too warm
welcome for the Sinn Fein leader.
The Government moved last night to clarify the position under which
the IRA would be expected to give up its weapons if peace talks are to
continue.
During a tense session of questions in the Commons, both the Northern
Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and his senior Minister, Mr
Michael Ancram, set out out the position.
Democratic Unionist William McCrea asked if Ministers had further
concessions to make to the IRA. He said there was frustration and anger
in the Province at rewards given to ''unrepentant IRA murderers,'' but
Sir Patrick rejected the idea that concessions had been made.
He said: ''There is deep hostility among peace-loving constitutional
people in Northern Ireland -- and more widely -- to those who claim they
are committed to peace and democratic methods and refuse to give the
assurances that the Government has asked for.''
They should be prepared to ''deal seriously and constructively with
the question of getting rid of that arsenal of arms which they have and
which is appropriate only to an army and is not appropriate to those who
are concerned with peace.''
Sr Patrick added: ''Constitutional parties and politicians cannot be
expected to sit down and discuss the future structures of Northern
Ireland with those who, by implication, reserve for themselves the right
to go back to the use of arms which they have used to such devastating
and evil effect over so many years.''
Ulster Unionist Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and South Tyrone) drew ironic
laughter when he asked when two key Sinn Fein figures had cut their
links with the IRA and become democrats. He said they were Martin
McGuinness and Gerry Adams, the latter of whom now rubbed shoulders with
Mr Clinton.
Sir Patrick said: ''Only they know their true intentions. We have to
go by objective, outward and visible signs and it is those we are
calling for.''
A Labour MP said the Minister should not get bogged down in the
disarmament issue, but Sir Patrick told him: ''It is very important that
substantive progress should be made on the issue of decommissioning arms
before parties can enter into discussion with the Government on
political matters.''
Unionists renewed their assault on the UK-Irish Framework Document for
discussions on Ulster's future, dismissing it as ''fatally flawed'' and
demanding a fresh talks blueprint.
Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux called for proposals ''on which
there could be widespread agreement.''
He urged the Government to press on with talks with parties.
''This is for the simply reason, that apart from the response
initially from those whom we might refer to as the hard hacks, those who
have carefully read the document regard it as divisive and fatally
flawed.''
Mr Ancram made clear that the Government was open-minded on the
framework document and was prepared to listen to contributions from all
parties.
Home Office Minister Baroness Blatch last night criticised the US
decision to allow Mr Adams to raise cash while on his visit to the
country.
She told the Lords: ''As the American government knows, Sinn Fein
remains inextricably linked to the IRA which still maintains its
arsenal.
''It is still recruiting, targeting and training and is engaged in
intimidation and brutal punishments and beatings.
''The IRA still seeks funds to maintain these operations and the
British people will wonder why Mr Adams is now permitted to raise funds
in the US before the IRA has taken one single step to decommission its
large stock of arms.''
Earlier former Ulster SDLP leader Lord Fitt condemned President
Clinton for the ''red carpet treatment'' offered Mr Adams.
Lord Fitt, ousted in 1983 by Mr Adams as MP for Belfast West, said he
''bitterly resented'' the welcome offered by Mr Clinton.
He asked if Mr Clinton's attitude would be different if 396 American
policemen had been killed by the IRA -- the number of Royal Ulster
Constabulary men who had died with nearly 500 soldiers over the past 25
years.
DEPUTY Irish Prime Minister Dick Spring last night emphasised the need
to involve and reassure representatives of Ulster's loyalist
paramilitaries during the current peace process.
Mr Spring, who is also Ireland's Foreign Minister, said: ''As one who
has called for British Ministers to sit down with Sinn Fein, I also want
to see them prepared to negotiate on the issues -- especially the
difficult issues of prisoners and arms -- with the political
representatives of former loyalist paramilitaries.
''They, too, have a political mandate, and a major contribution to
make to the future of Northern Ireland.''
''They, too, require and need the reassurance that the future of
Northern Ireland will not be threatened by unreasonable demands from
Dublin.''

Singapore, Friday
A FILIPINA maid convicted of murdering a colleague and a four-year-old
boy was executed early today despite protests and pleas for mercy.
Flor Contemplacion, 42, was hanged at dawn at the maximum security
Changi prison.
Contemplacion was convicted last April of killing another Filipina
maid, Della Maga, and her charge, Nicholas Huang, in May 1991. Her
lawyers tried to delay the execution, claiming there was fresh evidence
to exonerate her and that the case should be reopened.
However, the Singapore government refused to make concessions and
rejected the new evidence -- testimony by another maid who knew Mrs
Contemplacion -- as false.
Contemplacion, a mother of four, claimed her confession during the
trial was forced. A murder conviction carries a mandatory death penalty
in Singapore, as does conviction for heroin possession.
Displaying unprecedented security during a hanging in Singapore, eight
policemen, including two armed with machine guns and wearing flak
jackets, stood outside the prison gates with two dogs.
Police cars and motorcycles patrolled the street in front
continuously, apparently to deter any possible protest by the estimated
75,000 Filipina maids working in Singapore.--AP

<HEADLINE>Motorist tried to stop bus before bridge crash</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979353832</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MOTORIST told a court yesterday how he made a desperate attempt to
stop a bus carrying Girl Guides from hitting a bridge.
Plumber Gary Shaw, 34, giving evidence at Glasgow Sheriff Court, said
he chased the double-decker in his car, and flashed his lights. He told
the court: ''I knew it would not get under the bridge and I tried to
stop it. I could tell the driver did not know where he was going.''
Mr Shaw, of Magnus Crescent, Simshill, Glasgow, said he had heard what
he thought was an explosion as the bus hit the bridge. ''The whole of
its roof dropped off on to the ground'', he said.
Mr Shaw and other witnesses told how they found ''a scene of carnage''
after the crash in West Street, Glasgow, on September 18 last year, in
which three Girl Guides and two pack leaders died. The bus was returning
from a Sunday outing to Butlin's, in Ayr.
He said he had seen a little girl lying injured on the roadway. She
was being attended to by someone and so he went to phone for help, but
could not face returning because he was upset and physically sickened.
In the past, more than three dozen other vehicles had been stuck under
the bridge, it was revealed yesterday. And since the tragedy another
seven accidents have been reported.
But traffic policeman Cameron Montgomery, 47, told the court that the
drivers were at fault. He said: ''It was up to them to see the signs and
obey them.'' He said it was his opinion that the two warning signs
should have been sufficient to alert drivers of the bridge clearance.
Mr Montgomery said he had seen the bus standing some distance away
from its roof. A young girl was on the road and he saw another young
Guide hanging over the upstairs of the bus, she had massive head
injuries.
Mr Montgomery said he went upstairs and found two people lying with
severe head injuries and several girls still trapped.
''There was nothing I could do for two of the injured . . . '' he
said.
He told Miss Elizabeth Munro, prosecuting, that the bus driver, Mr
Campbell Devlin, 30, had said to him: ''I think you will be looking for
me. I am the driver.''
When cautioned Mr Devlin had replied: ''I looked at the bridge and
thought I could get under it and drove through. After I hit it I drove
over and stopped at the kerb.''
The bus was 13ft 6ins high and the bridge clearance was 10ft 6ins.
Questioned by Mr David Burns, QC, defending, Mr Montgomery agreed that
there was a small gap of about nine to 12 metres between two bridges and
that a driver would have less than a second to see the second, lower
bridge.
He further agreed that the frequency of previous accidents -- 37 in
four years -- was ''rather high''.
Mr Devlin, of Rannoch Street, Cathcart, Glasgow, denies dangerous
driving and causing the deaths of Guide leaders Mrs Robina Dougall, 47,
of Boon Drive, Mrs Mary McGreskin, 39, of Drummore Road, and Guides
Catherine McKnight, 10, of Pitmilly Road, Margaret Riddick, 11, of
Bankglen Road, and Laura Cullen, 10, of Belsyde Avenue, all Drumchapel,
Glasgow.
He also denies failing to observe signs warning of the clearance
height at the railway bridge.
The court has been told that after the crash, Mr Devlin had gone to
the upper deck and had come down holding his head saying: ''Oh no, God

THE SNP will move swiftly and decisively in Perth and Kinross today to
prevent its by-election campaign being hijacked by fringe groups it
regards as advocating Scottish racism.
Candidate Roseanna Cunningham, who emigrated to Australia as a child
before returning to fight for Scots independence, is known to be enraged
by the antics of the Scotland Watch organisation, which has already
begun leafleting in the constitutency.
The organisation announced a fortnight ago that its ''spring
campaign'' would be in Perthshire and leaflets bearing the name of the
organisation above the slogan ''Vote Cunningham'' have now started to
appear to the fury of the SNP.
Party chief executive Michael Russell said last night: ''The SNP is
already planning to counter Scotland Watch with a high profile press
conference in Perth which will give backing for New Scots for
Independence and give very strong condemnation from Roseanna and myself
for this trend.''
New Scots for Independence is the grouping comprising people born
outwith Scotland who have made their life in this country and want to
see it independent. As such, anti-incomer groups such as Scotland Watch
are anathema to them.

THOSE most in need will be the biggest losers if new benefits changes
get the green light in Parliament next week, civil service unions have
claimed.
Launching a campaign opposing proposed new rules, the National Union
of Civil and Public Servants and the Civil and Public Services
Association claimed thousands of sick and disabled people could lose out
because of the changes.
Benefits paid to 18 to 24-year-olds could be cut by 20% and part-time
workers would also face missing out if the changes get the go-ahead,
they claimed.
The unions estimate 90,000 people nationwide could lose their
entitlement if the controversial job seekers allowance (JSA) replaces
unemployment benefit.
JSA, described as an agreement between the Government and job-hunting
claimants, will only be paid for six months, compared to the 12-month
period over which unemployment benefit can be claimed, and can be
suspended if staff feel little effort is being made to find work, say
the unions.
Speaking in Edinburgh, union chiefs hit out at the plans and claimed
the new allowance would give staff ''draconian powers''.
CPSA spokesman Willie Samuel said: ''Should staff decide on the
grounds of experience that JSA claimants are not actively seeking work,
they will have the power to stop benefit for two weeks. We see that as
quite a severe shift from the current way of claiming benefit and the
current way people are assessed.''
Mr John Reid, of the NUCPS, said: ''The introduction of this new
benefit will mean people are being punished for being unemployed.''
The unions fear 15,000 civil service jobs may also be under threat
over the changes.
Public leafleting, to increase awareness of the changes, started
yesterday in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow.
The unions claimed their members had been threatened with disciplinary
action if they took part in the campaign, but Mr Reid said most had
managed to get around this by distributing leaflets before going to work
and during lunchbreaks.
The Bill proposing the changes will receive its third reading in
Parliament next week.

MR David Blair, the sacked chief executive of Lochaber District
Council, last night had his appeal against dismissal unanimously
rejected by the council's four-man appeal committee.
Mr Blair, 44, was told at the end of an eight-hour hearing in Fort
William that his dismissal, passed in January, would now stand.
He was suspended on full pay in September pending the outcome of
internal investigations. These subsequently found against Mr Blair's
management of certain council projects and his conduct of
administration. It has always been stressed, however, that no financial
impropriety was involved.
The appeal committee chairman, Councillor Drew MacFarlane Slack, told
The Herald last night: ''Unfortunately one of Mr Blair's witnesses could
not attend but he was to present opinion and we felt that we should
proceed. We listened to all the evidence presented and in the end
concluded the district council had acted correctly.''
It is now open to Mr Blair to take his case to an industrial tribunal.

THE climbers found dead in a gully on Lochnagar were named yesterday
as two of Scotland's most experienced mountaineers.
The bodies of Mr Mark Sinclair, 38, the owner of an outdoor equipment
shop in Forres, and Mr Neil Main, 26, a joiner from Keith, were found
roped together on Wednesday by four other climbers. It brings the death
toll on Scotland's mountains this year to 16 with six more missing
presumed dead.
Mr Sinclair and Mr Main specialised in winter mountaineering and were
acknowledged experts. Mr Sinclair lived with his wife, Libby, in the
village of Rafford, Morayshire, and ran a mountain sports shop in nearby
Forres. Mr Main, 26, lived with his parents in Broomhill Road, Keith.
The men had set out on Wednesday morning to climb the notorious
Parallel B Gully but only hours later their bodies were found. It is
thought they fell down a cliff face near the summit of the 3786ft peak.
Moray Mountaineering Club vice-president Mr Andy Brooks said: ''They
were top-notch climbers who were in the forefront of Scottish winter
climbing.'' Until the mid-80s, Mr Sinclair was a member of the RAF
Kinloss mountain rescue team and spokesman Flight Sergeant Dave Whalley
said: ''He was a close friend and colleague and his death has shocked
and saddened us all.
Meanwhile, a search for an elderly climber who fell through a snow
cornice on Ben Wyvis, near Dingwall, was called off last night after he
walked off the mountain uninjured. Mr Brian Holland, 65, of Lambley,
Nottinghamshire, fell into Coire Na Feola while walking on a ridge near
the summit of the 3400ft mountain yesterday afternoon.

The death of one of the great figures of Scotland's military history
leads Jack Webster to pay a personal tribute.
THE dashing figure of Lord Lovat, who died yesterday aged 83, was not
only one of the heroes of the Second World War, but the very embodiment
of what the world imagines a Highland chieftain to be.
With his good looks, impressive bearing, and courage, he could have
been a storybook character. Indeed, along with his brother-in-law Sir
Fitzroy Maclean, another war hero, he would have taken his place among
the great figures in any period of military history.
As it was, his moment of greatest glory came as a commando leader in
the break-out after D-Day in 1944, when he marched courageously across a
newly-captured bridge, accompanied by two pipers, setting an example to
those who would follow.
Lord Lovat was seriously wounded, but not before his bravery had
merited a string of awards, including the Military Cross, the DSO, and
the Croix de Guerre.
At the start of the Second World War, he had taken over the family
interest as a captain in the Lovat Scouts, formed by his father in 1899
to fight in the Boer War. He went on to daring exploits in the Commandos
at Lofoten and Dieppe.
Home for the Lovats has long been Beaufort Castle at Beauly, and it
was there, as a very young man in 1933, that he succeeded his father as
Chief of the Clan Fraser of Lovat.
Born in July 1911, and raised in that Highland castle, the man who was
known as Shimi Lovat became the prize essayist at Ampleforth, and went
on to take an honours degree in history at Oxford.
After the Second World War he developed his vast Highland estates for
rearing large herds of cattle and travelled the world as a judge at
major agricultural shows.
In the 1970s, he transferred much of his 100,000-acre estate to his
eldest son Simon, which seemed the sensible thing to do in view of the
potentially crippling burden of death duties.
There were rumblings of disagreement between father and son over the
running of the estate, and Lord Lovat would make no comment in 1990,
when a large portion of the assets -- some of Scotland's best fishing
and deer forest -- was sold off to an English firm for a reported #15m.
Simon, Master of Lovat, faced with balancing family history and the
practical needs of modern survival, claimed it would have been foolish
not to have taken advantage of the soaring value of sporting estates.
Any family differences, however, paled into insignificance within two
weeks of March 1994, when Lord and Lady Lovat suffered the most
appalling double tragedy.
Their youngest son Andrew, 42, was on safari in Tanzania when he was
attacked and killed by a wounded buffalo. Lady Rosamond attended her
son's burial at the family graveyard at Eskdale, but Lord Lovat was
unable to do so. Within days the second tragedy had struck.
The 54-year-old Simon Fraser, eldest son and heir, was out riding when
he collapsed and died of a heart attack. Once again the Lovat family was
devastated. Grandson Simon, who was only 17 at the time, became the
Master of Lovat in place of his father, and now succeeds his
grandfather.
All the precautions of tax-saving presented new dilemmas, and proved
once again that the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley.
Lord Lovat, whose brother, the late Sir Hugh Fraser, was once married
to novelist Anotonia Fraser, resisted all overtures for his memoirs
until he was 67. He then applied his skills as an essayist to produce a
volume called March Past.
Among the military revelations was the fact that there had been a
rehearsal for the D-Day landings on a stretch of the Moray Firth between
Burghead and Inverness, which was so disastrous that the idea was nearly
called off.
Casting around the human scene, he found that the generosity of spirit
was declining and that self-interest was taking the place of good
manners.
Lamenting the disappearance of statesmen, he said: ''Our leaders no
longer grasp the helm, preferring the role of those celluloid ducks
which suffer rude disturbance in the waves of a child's bath, either to
capsize or be buoyantly blown off course. An age more concerned with
material values and personal advancement will inevitably breed
malcontents who belittle the old country.''
He had high praise for the mettle of many a humble human being, but
had found it true that ''the man who lets you down in a difficult
situation once, will invariably do so again''.
Lord Lovat was never a man to let anyone down. A great Scottish hero,
soldier, and gentleman, he had his own qualities tested to unbearable
limits. And the one which sustained him most of all was courage.

SCOTLAND was suffering from the ''fail mood'' factor, Scottish
National Party leaders claimed yesterday.
Referring to the Government's, and more particularly the Chancellor's,
recent problems in finding the elusive ''feel good'' factor, SNP policy
vice convener Alex Neil said the ''fail mood'' one in Scotland was a
result of the Tories' failure in national government and Labour's
failure at local council level.
Speaking in Edinburgh at the launch of the party's national manifesto,
Mr Neil said the Tories had failed in the field of education, and had
failed to create jobs and to invest in housing.
By contrast, the SNP was campaigning to build 15,000 new homes every
year for the next 10 years. It also aimed to provide a nursery school
place for every pre-school child whose parents wanted it.
Mr Neil criticised the Labour Party nationally for failing to include
a commitment to full employment in its proposed new wording for Clause 4
and for not promising to restore benefit to 16 and 17-year-olds.
He also challenged Labour to commit itself to taking water services
back into local democratic control. The SNP had made it clear this was
its policy.
SNP vice president Andrew Welsh claimed that successive Tory
governments had been hell-bent on destroying local government by
restricting its areas of decision-making, shifting services to quangos
and the private sector, and drastically curtailing the finance of local
authorities.
He added: ''But just as the Tories have been attacking Scottish local
government from above, Labour neglect has weakened it from within. Only
the SNP can provide the fresh start which Scotland so badly needs.''
The national manifesto, A Fresh Start for Scotland, was based on clear
principles which would guide the party's approach to the new councils.
Key policies included attacking crime by releasing more police for
investigation and street patrol and the retention of rural police
stations.
The SNP also wanted to see improved public transport, concessionary
travel for the elderly and disabled, and innovative schemes to tackle
fuel poverty.
* The Liberal Democrats, who are bidding to become the second largest
party in Edinburgh, yesterday put forward their plan for a new council
department of ''life-long learning''.
It would combine adult and community education previously run by the
regional council and the old district responsibilities of libraries,
museums, arts and entertainment.
In their manifesto, the Liberal Democrats say this would form a new
department and a new council committee responsible for covering
life-long learning, arts, culture, science and the community.
At a press conference yesterday, regional and district council group
leader Councillor Donald Gorrie also emphasised the party's committment
to enhance ''real local democracy'' by establishing nine area committees
for the city.
The Liberal Democrats promised that such committees would give
councillors for each area real powers over local matters such as
transport planning, including a budget.
Mr Gorrie attacked Tory policies at national level but claimed Labour
also showed signs of ''arrogance and incompetence'' in local government
because it had been in control for too long.
The party is fielding candidates in all 58 seats.
* The SNP provided the only electable alternative to Labour's
continued political dominance of Glasgow, party activists claimed
yesterday, Nic Outterside writes.
The party, which along with Labour is contesting all 83 seats in next
month's elections, launched a concerted attack on the failures of its
socialist adversaries.
It said that after 15 years in power Labour was bankrupt of policy and
had ''no ideology left''.
Mr Alex Pollock, the SNP's Glasgow press officer, claimed that the
socialists were irredeemably split and many of their ''tired old
councillors'' would be facing defeat at the hands of the Nationalists'
''high quality young contenders'' -- the party is fielding five
21-year-olds and the average age of its candidates is 37.
He predicted that infighting between supporters of Mr Pat Lally and
Mrs Jean McFadden ensured a splintering of Labour support.
Councillor Kenny Gibson claimed that Labour had experienced difficulty
in fielding candidates in all wards
He said that in 18 seats the SNP was taking on Labour in a head to
head battle.

THE LAIRD of Eigg, Keith Schellenberg, yesterday refused to confirm or
deny reports that he was considering an offer of #1.5m from an unnamed
party to buy the island.
Mr Schellenberg, 65, who bought the island 20 years ago, and then
subsequently resold it to himself, told The Herald yesterday ''I can't
make any comment about this at all. I think I would be legally
constrained not to, but I can't comment anyway.
''The island is not officially for sale at present. But these things
come up from time to time and you know I am going to have to retire
someday. At the same time I am happy just to potter away.
''I can promise you that when it comes to the time I sell I will make
myself available for public dissection by whoever wants to take a pot at
me.''
Mrs Karen Helliwell, secretary of the residents' association which
represents the 74 people living on the island, said: ''Well that's a new
one one on me. We haven't heard a whisper, but that is often the way
here.''

A REPORT that the Government plans to introduce education vouchers is
''absolutely without foundation,'' the Prime Minister told the Commons
yesterday.
His denial followed speculation arising from comments on Wednesday by
Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken which were taken as an
indication that vouchers are a favoured option to fund a wider nursery
system.
The issue moved up the agenda when free-market theorist Lord Skidelski
disclosed on Wednesday that he had suggested to No. 10 that they be used
to fund the entire state system.

A MINISTER insisted in the Commons last night that elected regional
assemblies -- which a survey published in The Herald yesterday found a
majority of people in England favour -- would ''suck up'' local power,
not increase it.
The Government-funded research found only two out of eight English
regions were against change.
Labour's Denis Canavan (Falkirk West) called for a Commons debate on
''the need to decentralise power throughout the UK''.
He said the survey showed a ''clear majority'' in England backing
elected regional assemblies.
''In Scotland, there is an overwhelming majority of Scots in favour of
a Scottish Parliament.
''Why is the Government stubbornly refusing to respond to the wishes
of the people on this matter?''
Commons Leader Tony Newton said Mr Canavan should do some more
research if he thought there really was a majority for regional
assemblies in every part of the country.
''The net result would not be an increase in local democracy, as is
often claimed. It would actually suck up power from the local
responsibilty that already exists.''

RAIL franchising director Roger Salmon has ruled that there will be no
consultation over the future of sleeper and Motorail services to
Scotland, Labour claimed last night.
In a leaked letter -- a copy of which has been seen by The Herald --
Mr Salmon says that because British Rail will cease running the services
on May 28, they will not be included in the consultations to be held
beginning in May.
Shadow transport spokesman Henry McLeish called on the Government to
''come clean'', saying Mr Salmon's decision made a mockery of
ministerial promises of a ''full and formal'' consultation.
The letter contradicts the Government's insistence that no final
decision has been taken on whether to include the axed sleepers and
Motorail in the passenger service requirements (PSRs) for a privatised
ScotRail.
The dispute has been running since December, when Mr Salmon announced
the loss-making services would not be included in the PSRs. The
resulting uproar forced Ministers to promise that the decision would be
subject to ''full and formal'' consultation.
On Wednesday BR angered railway campaigners and Ministers by
announcing that it would stop running the Fort William-London and
Glasgow-Edinburgh-Plymouth sleepers and Motorail from May 28.
In his letter Mr Salmon says that if BR took such a decision ''we
would not, in such circumstances, include these particular services in
the PSR consultation, though we would, of course, consult about our
intentions for Anglo-Scottish sleepers generally''.
The PSRs are crucial to the privatisation process. They define the
minimum level of service a private rail franchise operator will have to
promise to provide.
Mr McLeish said: ''Are we embarking upon a period of consultation or,
as is suggested in this letter from Mr Salmon, are we merely involved in
an absurd farce with the decision signed and sealed never to be
discussed?''
He promised to raise the matter in the Commons next week and seek
meetings with Mr Major and Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney.
Yesterday Mr Major appeared unaware that the man he appointed to
oversee the privatisation process has no intention to consult. Asked by
Labour MP George Foulkes about consultation during Prime Minister's
questions, Mr Major said: ''Representations can be made during
consultation on ScotRail's passenger service requirements.''
The confusion surrounding the level of consultation increased last
night when a spokesman for Mr Salmon denied the letter meant there would
be no consultation.
He said that because the sleeper trains are to be mothballed the
service could be reinstated if an ''eleventh hour'' source of cash to
pay for them was found. ''I can say categorically that Mr Salmon is
prepared to discuss and consult on services that are not included in the
PSRs,'' he said.
BR said it would save #7m annually by cutting the services. The
Department of Transport has refused to make the cash available.
Meanwhile, pressure to seek a judicial review of the decision to cut
the sleeper and Motorail services also increased yesterday with the
identification of a possible procedural error by the Government.
Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy claimed Mr Salmon has failed to
produce or publish the criteria for cutting loss-making rail services,
despite being asked to do so by the Government last year.
If so, Mr Salmon's decision announced in December to exclude Motorail
and several sleeper services from the requirements for a privatised
ScotRail could be interpreted as being in violation of the 1993 Railways
Act.
Mr Kennedy yesterday tabled a Commons question asking the Transport
Secretary to make the criteria available to MPs.
The MP also said that EU transport commissioner Neil Kinnock would be
asked if BR's decision amounts to a downgrading of the UK railway
infrastructure and links to Scotland, in contravention of the terms
under which EU Objective 1 funding has been granted to the Highlands.

IT was announced yesterday that Ms Jenny Saville has won the #12,000
City of Glasgow Lord Provost's Prize. Her painting, Plan, was the choice
of both the judges and the public.
She gained 1104 votes from the public, who voted via ballot box in
Glasgow Art Gallery or via The Herald's coupon. Among the five
runners-up, Mr Ken Currie came second in the public vote with 708 votes.
This is the third time the Provost's Prize has been presented. The first
winner was Mr David Mach in 1992, the second was Ms Alison Watt.
The public's vote was taken into account along with the secret votes
of the three judges: Ms Joanna Drew, Arts Administrator; actor Richard
Wilson, star of One Foot in the Grave; and author A S Byatt. Each judge
nominated two artists to make up the short list of six, which also
included Mr John Byrne, Mr William Crozier, Mr Stuart Miller, and Mr
Norman Adams.
The judging was run according to Goncourt rules, which is systematic
and done in stages with one artist dropping out from the running each
time.
''The public's vote swayed the whole thing because, if there was a
draw, the public's vote was taken,'' Mr Byatt told me.
''There was obviously a divergence of opinion because we each had
selected our favourites for the short list. However, I think no-one was
unhappy with the outcome.''
Agreeing, Mr Wilson said: ''It was all very dignified. And we didn't
look at each other's votes until afterwards.''
Ms Saville, 24, graduated from Glasgow school of Art in 1992. Since
then she has had an acclaimed exhibition at London's Saatchi Gallery and
a residency in the US. She now lives in London.
The picture which won the prize is a huge oil of a nude showing the
marks made by plastic surgeons before liposuction.

SCOTLAND'S most famous garden is to be uprooted and replanted on a new
site. After 16 years the BBC's Beechgrove Garden is moving from Aberdeen
city centre to a new rural site.
The garden was born and developed within the grounds of the BBC's
Beechgrove studios where, because of its limited size, many of its much
admired features have had to be dug up over and over again.
The move will see an end to advertising on the BBC -- frequently
viewers would be distracted by the adverts on the sides of buses passing
in the background.
The garden's new home is at a Grampian Regional Council nursery in
Brotherfield, a tiny village six miles west of Aberdeen.
The new garden will be more than five times the size of the existing
one and Mr Nick Ibbotson, of Tern Television, who produce the programme
for BBC Scotland, said it would open up a number of new possibilities
and be more accessible to the public.
Grampian Regional Council was so keen to ensure that the garden
remained in the area it is investing #5000 in upgrading car parking and
other improvements at the 30-acre nursery.
It would like to see it become a visitor attraction and, had the
regional council been continuing, would have looked at the possibility
of creating a mini country park at Brotherfield.
A new series of The Beechgrove Garden starts next month and will be
the final one at its original home. Throughout the summer work will be
carried out at the new garden in preparation for the move.
A BBC spokesman said the move to the new site was being based on
editorial grounds and was nothing to do with a study being carried out
into a possible move from the studios.

THE Prime Minister's virulent attacks on constitutional change are
only serving to boost support for devolved regional government in
England, the Shadow Home Secretary claimed yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw was commenting on the report in The Herald yesterday
that an independent academic survey had shown that most people in
England were in favour of a devolved assembly for their own region.
''It is very interesting material,'' said Mr Straw. ''I treat any
polls on this subject with care, but I believe this shows the failure of
John Major's assaults on our policy.''
Mr Straw has been said to be lukewarm on the subject of devolved
English regional government, but his advisers insist that they are on
schedule to produce a consultative document by June.
Yesterday, The Herald revealed that joint research by the universities
of Strathclyde and Glasgow showed a clear majority in England, 54% to
44%, in favour of devolved government, and far greater support in

PLANS to shut Montfield geriatric hospital in Shetland were condemned
yesterday when a petition signed by two thirds of the islands' voters
was delivered to Councillor Florence Grains, chairwoman of the Shetland
Health Board.
Liberal Democratic Councillor Peter Malcolmson, chairman of the
all-party Save Montfield Against Closure (SMAC) campaign, said as the
bulky file of 10,254 signatures was handed over:
''The health board has to listen to the overwhelming public opinion
against closing Montfield Hospital. And God help them if they don't.''
The petition was handed over by Mrs Carrie Hastings, a retired senior
nurse.
Councillor Grains promised to pass the information on to the health
board.
A decision on the future of the 87-bed hospital and its outpatient
unit will be taken on May 17.
The plan is to look after most of the elderly patients at home, in
district care centres and a proposed new nursing home, retaining only 10
specialist beds in Lerwick's Gilbert Bain Hospital for geriatric
patients and severely disabled people.
Protestors describe this as ''ludicrous'' in a 14-page response to the
board's consultation document, handed to Councillor Grains with the
petition.
The SMAC campaigners say the board has under-estimated the number of
patients requiring geriatric hospital care and that the change to ''Care
in the Community'' will mean old folk losing their life savings, and
possibly their homes, because of new charges for care. This is causing
many families ''worry, fear and anger'', the campaign document says.

THE Lord Advocate yesterday asked five appeal court judges to rule
that Scotland's leading judge got it wrong in a controversial decision
which signalled a radical change in the way Scotland handles alleged
miscarriages of justice.
Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, QC, argued that Lord Hope's ruling on fresh
evidence appeals was contrary to the clear wishes of Parliament.
Last month, Lord Hope, backed by Lords Allanbridge and Brand, ruled
that Alan Church, jailed for eight years for a building society robbery,
should be allowed to lead new evidence challenging video identification,
even though this could have been made available at his trial.
Under the law as it had been applied in a number of previous cases,
the fact that the evidence was available at the trial would have been
fatal to Church's appeal.
Lord Hope said that the court was prepared to hear the evidence
because Church had a ''reasonable explanation'' for not producing it at
the trial. He had been unable to afford the cost of experts to carry out
tests on the video.
However, exactly a week later, the case of Angus Elliott, jailed for
life for murdering his partner, policewoman Irene Martin, went before
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord McCluskey and Lord Morison.
Lord Ross, second in Scotland's judicial hierarchy, indicated that
some of the judges had doubts about the Church decision, and Elliott's
case was sent before a bench of five judges for the law to be clarified.
Mr Graham Bell, QC, counsel for Elliott, asked Lord Ross sitting with
Lords McCluskey, Morison, Morton and Cowie to allow Elliott to lead
additional evidence. This included a medical report which suggested that
at the time of the offence he was suffering from a mental disorder which
diminished his responsibility.
Mr Bell said that the relevant legislation was section 228(2) of the
Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. This provided that any person
might challenge any alleged miscarriage of justice including an alleged
miscarriage on the basis of additional evidence which was not available
and could not reasonably have been made available at his trial.
Lord Rodger said Parliament had attached qualifications to additional
evidence appeals by including the words ''evidence which was not
available and could not reasonably have been made available at the
trial''.
These words could not be ignored and trouble with the approach of the
court regarding Church was that it rendered these words ''wholly
redundant''.
The court will issue a written decision later.

<TEXT>
THREE Orkney families caught up in the South Ronaldsay sex abuse
allegations yesterday started legal moves to stop a BBC Scotland
production about a fictional child abuse case.
The parents are seeking legal aid so that they can consult lawyers
about ways to prevent the play from being screened.
One mother said she had written to Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of
the BBC board of governors, asking him to stop the drama from being
filmed.
The play, Flowers of the Forest, was written by Michael Eaton and
takes a fictional look at the way the social work department in a small
Highland community handles a case of suspected child abuse.
The mother, whose two children spent five weeks in care after the
South Ronaldsay allegations, said there was a real danger that the play
would bring back terrible memories.
''Of all the rights they have, they have the right to recover from
what happened to them and the right to forget about the whole thing,''
she said.
Another mother said the play was certain to reopen old wounds for her
two children.
A third mother said she had originally supported the idea, but was now
firmly opposed to the drama being screened.
But the fourth family involved in the case is backing the production.
The mother said: ''We understand that the play is about the social
work profession and the power it wields,'' she said.
''It isn't a drama-documentary about South Ronaldsay or anywhere else
in particular and it explores the serious issues raised by the
much-publicised cases in Nottingham, Rochdale, Orkney, Bishop Auckland
and Ayrshire.
''If the play shows the madness which overcame the authorities in
those cases, and the damage that was caused to families and children, it
will be valuable and could help to protect innocent families in
future.''
A BBC Scotland spokeswoman said yesterday that Flowers of the Forest
was a work of fiction and not a drama-documentary.
''While the writer has researched all the major cases, nothing is
based on any one individual case,'' she said.
She added that filming would start in the summer and that the BBC
would fight any moves to stop the play from being screened.

STRATHCLYDE Fire Brigade is in crisis and being forced to break the
law to keep operational because of cuts in Government funding, a fire
chief claimed yesterday.
Lives are being put at risk as the brigade cannibalises obsolete
equipment to maintain its outdated command control centres in the face
of a 40% cut in its capital allocation, it was claimed.
But a Government spokesman said its level of funding was adequate to
meet the brigade's requirements, and that it was up to Strathclyde
Regional Council to make better use of its allocation.
Last night, Mr John Jameson, the region's firemaster, told The Herald
that new cuts had created a ''potentially catastrophic'' situation,
adding: ''We really have to make it clear -- the public are seriously at
risk.
''The command and control equipment, which pinpoints where a fire is
and where to go, is so old it is forever breaking down. We are having to
cannibalise parts just to keep things going.
''Some of our equipment -- such as radios and communication computers
-- has been declared obsolete by the makers.''
Mr Jameson said his brigade is so short of money that it cannot
implement 70 directives already issued by the Government. ''In fact, 24
of our 31 voluntary stations are short of the statutory requirements. We
are actually breaking the law by continuing to use them.
''We need #9m to upgrade them to a legal standard, and all we have
been given is between #300,000 and #400,000 for new uniforms.''
He said that many of these stations are in remote rural areas and on
islands such as Colonsay, Coll and Jura, where response times are vital.
''What happens if there is an emergency on one of the islands we serve?
People live there and tourists visit the islands.''
Following a new 10% cut in capital allocation, the brigade is left
with a third of the #6m Mr Jameson claims it needs for upgrading work.
Yesterday the firemaster requested #300,000 of ''early consent'' from
the council to spend on upgrading the command and control centres, but
the cut in the capital allocation means the request may not succeed.
He claims the brigade's #68,843,730 revenue budget is also some #4m
short of the level needed to run a basic service and meet special
service eventualities.
''The Government seems to think we do nothing but deal with fires.
They don't realise the part the brigade plays in emergencies like
flooding or road accidents, or train or plane crashes, or rescues. We
can't operate without finance. We really are in a very high risk of a
potentially catastrophic situation.''
Mr Jameson received immediate support from the Fire Brigade Union. Its
spokesman, Mr David Patton, said it was ''great'' to have a firemaster
speak out forcefully on the issue.
''Mr Jameson is right when he says the Government takes no account of
special services which are forced to deal with things like Lockerbie,
car crashes and floods. It's people's lives we are talking about.''
Mr Jim Jennings, the convener of Strathclyde Regional Council's police
and fire committee, said the firemaster was making a number of valid
points and had the total support of the council.
''Mr Jameson takes his job very seriously and it has come to something
when he feels forced to speak out so forcefully,'' he added.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said that it was aware of the
firemaster's views, but it was up to each local authority to use its
capital allocation as it saw fit.
''The Secretary of State is committed to keeping a tight grip on
funding to maintain recovery,'' he added. ''The money allocated to
Strathclyde in previous years has been suitable to meet essential
services and its statutory requirements.''
* Hoax calls to Highlands and Islands Fire Brigade have become so
common that there is now a delay while suspicious ''fire'' alerts are
checked out.
At Dingwall Sheriff Court in Ross-shire yesterday, procurator-fiscal
David Hingston said many of the brigade members were volunteers who
''dropped everything'' when their bleepers went.
But recently there had been so many hoax calls that, when there was
any suspicion, police were being asked to check out the calls before
fire headquarters ''hit the button''.
Mr Hingston said all too often firemen found they were on a wild goose
chase and added that, apart from wasting time on hoax calls, lives were
being put at risk when the firefighters might have been needed for a
genuine emergency.
He was speaking after 17-year-old Thomas Robson, of Simpson Place,
Dingwall, admitted making a false call to fire headquarters saying there
was a blaze at Tulloch Castle Hotel in Dingwall.
The fiscal said Robson appeared to be one of those who thought it was
funny to make hoax calls when, in fact, it was ''stupid and dangerous''.
The case was continued for reports.

THE most prestigious athletics meeting in Scotland this year -- a
match between Great Britain and the USA at Meadowbank on July 27 --
faces being cancelled because of Edinburgh District Council cuts. It is
the third major athletics event to be axed in Scotland in the past few
months.
The need to make budget economies of #1.3m in the recreation
department is the city's stated reason for being unable to support the
event.
Last year, when the fixture was an international invitation meeting,
the council's support was #50,000. This year they cannot afford to give
anything.
The British Athletics Federation press officer, Mr Tony Ward,
confirmed emergency talks were going ahead between the BAF events
management officer Mr Ian Stewart, BAF treasurer Mr John Lister, and the
BBC, which has a contract to televise the meeting.
''Our criteria for staging an event of this nature are that the
stadium is suitable, that crowd support is good, and that there is the
support of the local authority,'' said Mr Ward.
''With the last of these missing, without support in cash or in kind,
it does not look viable, though it would be premature to say it is
already cancelled.''

<TEXT>
HEALTH board doctors have distributed antibiotics to up to 30
children, and a care worker was in hospital last night after a report of
meningitis at a Central region primary school.
The worker, a woman in her fifties, is a nursery assistant at
Bannockburn Primary School. She was said last night to be ''improving''
in Stirling Royal Infirmary after falling ill just more than a week ago.
Officials from Forth Valley Health Board's department of public health
medicine contacted the school after doctors confirmed the woman was
suffering from the meningococcal form of the disease, sometimes known as
''spotted fever''. She has not been named.
Forth Valley's director of public health, Dr Malcolm McWhirter, said
parents had been informed by letter, and antibiotics had been prescribed
for children considered at risk.
He said no-one else had been reported with the disease, and any danger
to children should now be over.
Sixty children attend the nursery class at Bannockburn Primary School
in two sessions, morning and afternoon. The sick woman worked with the
afternoon class.
Dr McWhirter, who said parents should not be alarmed, added:
''Practical experience has shown that, apart from the immediate family
of a sufferer and very close contacts, the risk of other cases occurring
is very low.
''There have been no further cases that the board is aware of, and the
period of risk should now be past,'' he said.
Parents have been advised to contact their GPs if they are worried. In
a statement, the health board said the symptoms of meningitis include
severe headache, neck stiffness, and fever, which may be accompanied by
vomiting or drowsiness.

FORMER RAF sergeant Graeme Grady, who was dismissed because he was

It will be the second test case involving a Ministry of Defence ban on
homosexuals and lesbians.
Last week, former RAF nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, of Leith, near
Edinburgh, was also given leave to bring a court challenge.
She and 32-year-old Mr Grady, of West Hampstead, London, have been
given permission to seek judicial review on the grounds that the armed
forces' gay ban is contrary to European anti-discrimination law.
Ms Angela Mason, executive director of Stonewall, which campaigns for
equality for gays, said: ''This really is fantastic news.
''The MoD have to respond to two cases and there will be many more in
the future.
''This ban represents a deliberate and systematic discrimination based
on offensive and unproven assumptions about the way lesbians and gay men
behave.''
Other pending cases include that of former Royal Navy rating John
Beckett, dismissed in July 1993 after confessing to being gay
Another is that of Mr Duncan Lustig-Prean, a Navy lieutenant-commander
sacked in January this year after he admitted his homosexuality to avoid
being blackmailed.

THE Scottish Home Affairs Minister, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, last
night threw the weight of the Scottish Office behind Strathclyde Police
in their efforts to control the Paisley violence.
He said: ''There is no place for this sort of behaviour in Scotland. I
will do everything to support efforts by Strathclyde Police to bring the
perpetrators to justice as soon as possible and to remove them from the
streets. I am due to meet Irene Adams, MP, and Thomas Graham, MP, next
week and my door is open to anyone who wants to help us stamp this
out.''
Mrs Adams, MP for Paisley North, had called for the meeting to ask for
more resources for police and tighter controls on drugs such as
Temazepam.
Lord Fraser is soon to receive representations from Strathclyde
Regional Council's police authority which claims it is grossly
underfunded compared to similar forces in England.
Taking projections for the next five years the allocation of capital
consent will show a shortfall of around 46% in relation to the actual
needs of the force. The Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, Mr
John Boyd, has indicated his support for the move.
Mrs Adams also appealed to the public yesterday to support police in
their bid to rid the town of its drug barons and firearms menace.
She said she was confident police knew their targets but claimed
detectives were powerless to act without vital back-up evidence to
prosecute the men of violence.
She was speaking out after an hour-long meeting with the town's
Divisional Police Commander, Mr Michael Currie.
Mrs Adams said: ''The purpose of my meeting was to seek reassurance
that we don't have gun rule here in Paisley, and there is absolutely no
doubt in my mind now that police have control of the streets.
''The drug barons are running scared -- not running the town, but
there is too much tittle-tattling on street corners by people claiming
they know who is behind these recent acts of violence.
''Police can only do so much. Without the public's co-operation, their
job is made very difficult'', she added.

THE police operation to end the gun violence in Paisley and
Renfrewshire over the past two weeks is set to come to a successful
conclusion, Chief Constable Leslie Sharp of Strathclyde Police said
yesterday. He also offered reassurance to the people of Paisley that
their streets were safe.
Mr Sharp, delivering an optimistic and upbeat annual report with
another significant fall in recorded crime, declared: ''I say quite
confidently that the police operation in Paisley will soon bring the
violence to an end. I have no doubts about that. We are very close to it
now.''
He rejected tabloid press stories that there was what amounted to a
shoot-to-kill policy by his officers in Paisley in response to at least
nine known gun incidents, this week culminating in the murder of a
31-year-old man on his own doorstep.
The violence has followed a struggle for power among criminals seeking
control of drug distribution.
Mr Sharp added: ''We are very close to closing the case and that will
come when we make a final swoop. I know we are close. The amount of
information we are getting from people in Paisley is quite significant
and it is very valuable information.''
He had made trained firearms officers available in Paisley, although
they were not routinely armed. Arms had been made available in the
division by the use of one of the force's two armed response vehicles.
Mr Sharp said that the escalation in the number of times police were
issued with firearms alarmed him. They might end up with an armed police
force which he did not want. It was necessary, however, to give officers
proper protection.
He said there would be high-profile policing on the streets of Paisley
for ''as long as it takes''.
''The streets of Paisley are safe, despite what you read. It is the
fourth biggest town in Scotland so you would expect to have some level
of crime and we know it erupts from time to time.''
***************
GUNS
Mr Sharp's report for 1994 disclosed that the intelligence led
Operation Spur removed 790 guns from the crime scene, bringing the Spur
total since January 1992, to 3399 criminal weapons seized. One technique
used by detectives since the outset of Operation Spur has been to buy
weapons from middle men, usually registered informants, in order to make
sure they were not used again by criminals.
''If we can make an arrest we will do so. If we cannot then my
detectives are authorised to 'buy' the guns to keep them out of the
wrong hands,'' he said, later emphasising that criminals were not paid
for handing over weapons.
Allied to the better security at banks and building societies, this
had the effect of reducing armed robberies in Strathclyde by a further
12.4%.
Despite newspaper reports there was no evidence of weapons coming from
Northern Ireland in the wake of the cease fire by para-militaries. He
thought this was unlikely to happen.
Their operations had, however, led to the price of criminal guns in
certain areas trebling because they were in short supply.
''If a determined criminal wants a gun he will get it fairly easily,''
Mr Sharp said, adding: ''We are awash with guns.''
The improved security of banks and building societies had pushed the
armed robbers towards other targets. Post offices had been badly hit.
The police were now working with them on improving security but this in
turn was pushing the robbers towards the filling stations and small
shops. The armed robbers were now hitting five shops to get #50 each
time.
A huge proportion of the robberies were, he believed, carried out with
replica guns or reactivated collectors' items. A cottage industry now
existed in Strathclyde converting these and that could be done in half
an hour.
''It is about time the legislators made an attempt to put some
controls on these. It should not be beyond the wit of man to devise some
controls on imitation weapons across the board,'' he said.
****************
DRUGS
It was impossible, Mr Sharp said, to escape drugs which now permeated
every aspect of crime.
For years people had ''flapped their hands'' in the belief that
nothing could be done to stem rising crime but, he said, Strathclyde's
special operations approach had shown this was not the case. In terms of
drugs something could also be done, he believed, if everyone got their
act together.
''If something can be done about drugs then something is automatically
done about crime because the two are inextricably linked,'' he said.
The drug action teams would come into being in 1995 to co-ordinate all
approaches and senior Strathclyde detectives would be involved in all
four in the region. The fall in the number of needles being issued to
injectors at Glasgow's needle exchanges indicated that the methodone
substitution programmes were already taking effect, he said. While they
could not eradicate drugs the problems could be brought down to
manageable levels.
Mr Sharp expressed dismay about the ''weakening of the perimeter'' by
the reduction in numbers of customs officers and immigration staff. This
year, he promised, would see a major push against drugs in Strathclyde,
building on the record levels of arrests and seizures.
It would include publicity, co-operation with other agencies,
high-profile stop-and-search operations, and high-profile road blocks.
''Let us have an end to academic debates on legalisation of cannabis
and other drugs. We have got to give a clear message to people that drug
taking is unnacceptable. Watch this space,'' he said.
**************
CRIME
The target of bringing down crime to the 1984 level had been missed by
a whisker, Mr Sharp said, in reporting an overall fall of 5% in reported
crime. Operation Turnkey had been instrumental in lowering domestic
housebreaking by 30%, recovering over #1.8m of stolen property.
The vast majority of people were not affected by violent crime as they
went about their everyday lives. The major reductions had been achieved
in thefts, housebreakings and car crimes which dominated the crime
statistics.
Mr Sharp said: ''I am accused of massaging the figures and there are
claims it is all a big con trick. Well that is utter nonsense. It is not
a con. Things are getting better and it is policing which is doing this.
I can say that crime is down again by 11% in the first two months of
this year but no-one seems to want to believe it.
''I still read accusations that we massage the figures. When I said
that crime was out of control some years ago people did not believe that
and I was accused of saying it to get more resources. Now when I say
that crime is going down they say I am massaging the figures because I
am under pressure from the Government.
''That is a load of nonsense. The recent reports of the Scottish Crime
Survey reveal that there has been a higher proportion of crime reported
to the police in the last three years. Anyone who does not believe that
crime is going down is living in cloud cuckoo land,'' he said.
While violent crime was rising the proportion of people touched by it
was very low. Normal people leading normal lives were untouched by it in
the main. Those people who put themselves in places and at times where
violence was going to occur or engaged in activities which attracted
crime were the victims.
Only 1% of victims could be classed as elderly, Mr Sharp said. That
had to be kept in perspective. The force detection rate of 33%, while
still low, was 3% up and the highest detection figure ever achieved.

EXCLUSIVE
THE Scottish National Party has taken a massive lead for the Perth and
Kinross by-election, according to a System Three poll for The Herald
which puts Conservatives in third place behind Labour.
A 48% share confounds those who said the SNP campaign had foundered at
the outset amid internal acrimony over the selection of candidate Ms
Roseanna Cunningham and unwarranted newspaper attention on her private
life.
For the Tories, support halved from 40% at the last election is a grim
platform for a parliamentary by-election, which appears to justify their
decision to delay the poll beyond council elections north and south of
the Border.
Their best hope of clawing back support lies in the 24% who were
undecided in our poll. The Conservative candidate, Mr John Godfrey, is
defending the majority of just over 2000, held by the late Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn, over the SNP.
For Labour, up 11 points to 23% from the last General Election, the
timing of our poll last weekend was good in terms of the Scottish
conference and Mr Tony Blair's Clause 4 victory. They will take heart
from the poll's apparent destruction of the notion of a two-horse race
between the Tories and Nationalists.
However, any Labour joy will be tempered by the fact that their
showing on 23%, added to the Conservative share of 20%, leaves the SNP
sitting on a total which is 5% greater than the combined share of the
two main challengers.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats on 9% are within two points of their
General Election performance and may find it difficult to avoid a
by-election squeeze, but they pointed out that their candidate, Mrs
Veronica Linklater, was only adopted this week.
Paradoxically, the SNP's problem will be their inexperience in
embarking on a campaign in which they are such overwhelming favourites.
To use a sporting metaphor, they prefer their more accustomed role as
Grand Slam underdogs.
Ms Cunningham said: ''No wonder the Tories are putting off the
by-election against the wishes of the people of Perth and Kinross. I am
delighted that already the SNP is so clearly in the lead with almost as
much support as the rest put together.
''But the Tories are still capable of a comeback and in both the local
election campaign and in the by-election we will not allow ourselves to
become complacent. The only vote that can knock out the Tories locally
and nationally is one for the SNP.''
Unexpectedly lying in second place, the Labour candidate, Mr Douglas
Alexander, said the poll showed the by-election was wide open and Labour
had everything to play for.
''Our ability to deliver a Scottish Parliament was always going to be
a political threat to both the Nationalists and the Tories. This poll is
a big boost for Labour's campaign.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson added: ''Before the
campaign has even started, Labour has already overtaken the Tories and
is now closing on the SNP. The people of Perth and Kinross want a real
say over their own affairs but they don't want a separate state.''
Mr Godfrey was impressively relaxed about his apparent plight
yesterday, pointing out that not only were there those who had not
decided but that the campaign had not even started yet.
''As far as I am concerned, the only poll that is going to matter is
the one on the day in question, whenever that is,'' he said. ''I will be
building up to that date. Meanwhile, we would all be as well reading
horoscopes.''
Mrs Linklater said: ''I would like to see the results of a similar
poll now that my candidature has been announced, let alone in a few
weeks, because I think we might see a very significant difference.''

THE Prime Minister yesterday rebuked former Tory party treasurer Lord
McAlpine over his suggestion that a spell in opposition would do the
party good.
Challenged about the comments in the Commons, Mr Major replied: ''I
understand that he is promoting a book which is a work of fiction.''
Mr Major was again forced to brush aside reports that his leadership
is under threat if the Tories perform disastrously, as forecast, in the
English and Scottish local government elections later this spring.
Labour left-winger Dennis Skinner told him he would be ''kicked out
like a dog in the night''. That forecast had been made about him for
several years, said Mr Major, but he would be there ''next year, the
year after that, and the year after that''.
However, Lord McAlpine's remarks, coming from one of the party's most
successful fund-raisers, were a blow to Tory morale. In a New Statesman
and Society magazine article, he wrote: ''I've nothing against the chap
personally. He's never done me any harm except stuffing up the
Conservative Party.''
In a radio interview, he said the Tories were ''in dire financial
straits and they are split over Europe''.
He said: ''I'd like to see the Conservative Party change its direction
and do the really Conservative thing and actually win.''
A spell in opposition would not be such a bad thing, he added. ''It's
a good cleansing. It does a party good. It gives it time to rethink and
re-form and become revitalised.''
Tory MPs, depressed by the suggestion from Mr Kenneth Clarke,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the ''feel-good'' factor among voters
night not arrive before the end of the nineties, too late for the next
General Election, which must come by April 1997, were further
disconcerted when Mr Clarke made a second gaffe involving industry in
the North of England.
Having praised a steelworks in Consett, County Durham, which closed 15
years ago, he hailed the performance of a nappy factory in the same town
which shut in 1991. To make a second mistake while trying to correct his
first makes the Chancellor look more accident prone.
Seeking to repair his error during an interview on BBC Radio's Five
Live show, he joked that a Consett firm had sent him a gift of crisps,
but he did not want a similar gift of nappies from the town. He was
referring to the Blue Ridge nappy factory, set up after the steel
shutdown, which has not survived.
Mr Blair sought to exploit the Government's difficulties by asking Mr
Major to confirm that next month cuts in mortgage interest and married
couples' allowances come into effect costing the average family, he
said, #250 a year.
Mr Major did so, but added that the Chancellor's policies had moved
the country into ''the most secure recovery on the most secure basis
that this country has seen for many years''.
Later Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, accused
the media of ''being obsessed with the minutiae and trivia of
government''. He said the Government could let inflation rise, see house
prices go up. ''You can have a heady couple of years and then you have
to stop it.''
But he said: ''We are not going to pander to the pressures of
short-term unpopularity.''

ONE man was killed and his brother seriously wounded by a teenage
gunman in the Maryhill area of Glasgow last night. The two brothers,
both in their 30s, were walking in Sandbank Crescent when they were shot
by the youth with what is believed to have been a shotgun.
One brother died in an ambulance and the other was last night in a
stable condition at the Western Infirmary.
The two victims had just left the Hughes Memorial Orange Hall when the
shooting happened shortly before 8pm.
A police spokeswoman said there was nothing to indicate the attack was
connected with any sectarian matter and no connection had been
established with the recent spate of shootings in the Paisley area.
The gunman is described as 6ft, very slim, and in his late teens. He
was wearing a red hooded top.
Meanwhile, police at Milngavie are appealing for witnesses following a
robbery yesterday afternoon at the National and Provincial Building
Society in Main Street when a man armed with a handgun threatened staff
and made off with a four-figure sum.
Last night's shooting in Maryhill came only hours after the chief
constable of Strathclyde, Mr Leslie Sharp, declared that a police
operation to end the gun violence in Paisley and Renfrewshire in the
last two weeks was about to come to a successful conclusion.

THE number of Lothian children referred to the children's reporter on
grounds of abuse or lack of parental care last year jumped by 18% and
there was a 27% increase in sexual abuse cases alone.
The statistics were unveiled yesterday in the annual report on the
regional children's hearing system, which points out that 43% of the
5131 referrals during 1993-94 involved youngsters who were not offenders
themselves.
However, the regional reporter, Mr Donald Stirling, states that this
does not mean that more children in Lothian are being abused or
neglected. ''It is far more likely the result of improved investigation
and referral procedures amongst child care agencies and more sensitive
public awareness of concerns for children,'' he comments.
The report shows that 1546 cases involving abuse or lack of parental
care were referred to Mr Stirling during the year.
The number involving sexual abuse was 523, compared with 411 the year
before.
Mr Stirling also refers in his report to the Government's plans for a
national reporter service, due to be implemented in April 1996, and
states that the proposals create concerns as well as opportunities.
He says that it is difficult to predict how inter-agency relationships
will work under the new set-up, but that the impact in Lothian is likely
to be minimal.

THE Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, has been asked to consider
intervening in the row over plans for the former Glasgow Garden Festival
site.
The request comes form the chairman of the Scottish Conservative
Party, Sir Michael Hirst, it was disclosed yesterday.
Sir Michael made the approach of behalf of a group of Glasgow business
leaders and artists who favour a ''more visionary'' scheme of
establishing a permanent Festival Gardens tourist attraction on the
stretch of Clydeside waterfront which fell derelict after the 1988
festival.
The Glasgow Development Agency backs a commercial scheme involving the
erection of a 300ft Millenium Tower, the construction of the city's
first hi-tech business park, and a national science centre.
Mr Lang has been asked to postpone the March 31 deadline for a
decision on the future of the site, known as Pacific Quay, until further
evaluation of an alternative Tivoli Gardens-style scheme can take place.
The gardens concept is being promoted by a new company under the name
of the Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 Ltd. The company has collected a
petition with several hundred signatures and has conducted a letter
campaign, including a missive published in today's Herald, pushing their
plan for Pacific Quay.
Mr Geoffrey Jarvis, the main proponent of the permanent festival,
urges in the letter that the city council, Scottish Enterprise, the GDA
and the Scottish Office put off any ''irrevocable'' decisions until an
analysis of the economic benefits of his scheme is completed and the
result of the company's application for support from the Millenium Fund
is announced.
Mr Jarvis also claims in the letter that the Scottish Tourist Board
wants a comparative analysis of both proposals to be carried out to
assess the greatest net benefit to the country.
His letter also states: ''We understand that although the brief
emphasised tourism, no official contact was made with the Scottish
Tourist Board.''
This brought a furious riposte yesterday from the Glasgow Development
Agency. A spokesman said: ''It is not true that the GDA has had no
official contact with the STB on the Pacific Quay proposals.''
He went on to stress that GDA officials had conducted several meetings
with senior officers of both the STB and the Greater Glasgow Tourist
Board over a long period of time when their scheme was being developed.
Privately, GDA officials admit to being frustrated over the continuing
row on the site's future.
Publically, the agency contented itself with stating: ''The idea of a
Clyde Festival Gardens has been given the fullest possible airing. The
proposals were out before 150 development companies at the initial
stages of a national competition to find the best way forward for this
important site.
''Not one of the companies considered the proposals had sufficient
viability to take them forward. We therefore believe we have tested the
market fully and consider that the proposals have no financial
viability.''
However, Mr Jarvis declared last night that insistence on the economic
details of the enterprise misunderstood the nature of the Tivoli-style
concept.
He said: ''Of course no conventional developer would touch this
scheme. That's not the point. It's an opportunity to produce an
imaginative tourist attraction in a vital area for the city and I just
don't believe people will come to visit a business park.''
One of Mr Jarvis's colleagues in the venture, Mr Mike Starbuck, also
questioned the GDA's promise of 2000 new jobs arising from their scheme.
Mr Starbuck, a retired horticulturalist, said: ''We believe those jobs
will just be sucked from other places in the city as they move offices
that are already here.''
Sir Michael Hirst could not be contacted for comment last night.

THE historic Edinburgh Royal Infirmary site may go to rack and ruin if
no private developer steps in to take it over, it was feared yesterday.
Edinburgh District Council leaders believe taking over the site may be
too big an undertaking for one company.
There are growing fears that the Scottish Office may even have to
offer the site at the Meadows to developers at a knock-down price as a
sweetener to persuade them to build its replacement.
The Herald yesterday revealed that Scottish Office Minister Lord
Fraser had killed off council hopes to take it over. It had hoped to
create a ''village'' type development there.
The council had planned to have a community-led development on the
site and lease back the infirmary to the hospital trust to run it until
it closes in six years.
A new hospital will be built in its place at Little France on the
outskirts of Edinburgh.
District council leader Lesley Hinds said she feared that the hospital
site could lie vacant for years because it may not attract interest.
The NHS trust which runs the hospital, a listed building, said
yesterday that it had heard of no approaches so far from developers
about the site.
Professor Cairns Aitken, chairman of the trust, said it was vital that
the site be developed in a way that enhances the quality of life in the
city.
Professor Aitken said: ''We are committed to that objective as best we
can. Here we have a site near the centre of town with museums and the
courts all within a mile.
''I am extremely keen that the site should be developed in the
appropriate way that strikes the balance between conservation and
development.''
Councillor Hinds said there was no guarantee whatsoever that any
company will come forward and bid for the site.
''If no company makes a bid, the site may have to be boarded up and
would go to rack and ruin.
''Even if a company did come forward with plans, you just have to look
at other places in Edinburgh to see what damage that can do.
''The grandest plan for the area may look good on paper, but may never
come to anything.
''The infirmary site may be sold off piecemeal which would be a
disaster. There have been other sites in Edinburgh where there had been
big plans, but nothing has happened and they are left untouched.
''They are gap sites that are nothing more than a series of blights on
the area. It would be a tragedy if the same thing happened for the site
around the infirmary.
''I believe the Goverment are discriminating against the council on
this issue, and did not want the site to be controlled by us.''
Councillor Hinds urged Lord Fraser to reconsider his decision for the
good of the city.
Central Edinburgh MP Alistair Darling said he would be raising the
whole issue of the future of the site in Parliament.
A statement issued by the Scottish Office said doubts over value for
money for the deal had been one of the reasons behind the decision to
reject the council plan.
The spokesman refused to say if there had been any interest from
private developers for the site.

EXECUTIVES of the company at the centre of the investigation into the
mass infection of hundreds of people in a Fife village with water-borne
germs last night admitted that it was ''unwittingly to blame''.
Almost 400 villagers in Freuchie, near Cupar, packed into their kirk
to hear Mr Clouston McIntyre, managing director of vegetable growers
Kettle Produce, say: ''Please accept my apologies. I am extremely sorry
for the mental anguish and physical distress you have been caused.''
Mr McIntyre told the meeting, organised by the local community council
and attended by an audience ranging downwards from the elderly to babes
in arms: ''I appreciate the invitation to publicly say how sorry we are
to have caused illness and distress to yourselves.''
He also told them that two members of his own family were among the
500 residents who suffered varying degrees of illness and said: ''Yes,
ultimately I am responsible.''
Mr McIntyre faced the villagers from a platform that included a range
of Fife region officials covering water, environmental health and other
departments involved in dealing with and investigating the outbreak of
illness, which began with a single complaint to water officials on
Friday, March 10.
It led to the launch yesterday of a programme of mass vaccination of
people from six months to 40 to forestall possible infection with the
virus hepatitis A.
The platform speakers drank from bottled water during the meeting
which lasted for more than two hours.
The audience heard that the outbreak began days after Kettle Produce
reconnected to the local mains supply from which it had severed its
factory. The reconnection was because of work being done on its
independent system -- supplied from a well.
The factory also returned temporarily to its former practice of taking
water from the Freuchie Burn.
The region's principal chemist, Mr Louis Purdie, said that the action
led to burn water getting into the public supply. He disclosed that the
firm had not notified officials when it had disconnected from the mains
in 1992, and again failed to inform officials when it reconnected.
Mr Alban Denton, the company's operations director, told the meeting
that investigations were still going on -- ''but clearly an imbalance of
water pressures between our supply and that of Fife Regional Council has
occurred and this has allowed burn water to mix with the mains water
supply''.
He added: ''We now realise that we have unwittingly acted as the
conduit which inadvertently allowed burn water into the mains supply.
''The situation occurred because our private water source was
undergoing repair and maintenance. There was no reason for us to suspect
that the water was anything other than potable.''
He stressed that Kettle Produce was committed to protecting the
environment.
Community council chairman Tony Cran said: ''I doubt if there has been
so much sickness in the community since the Great Plague.''
Fellow community councillor, Mr Angus Wood, a solicitor, advised
affected villagers: ''You are entitled to make a claim for damages.''
He said they could sue over pain, injury, discomfort and financial
loss, adding: ''Even for false teeth down the toilet.''
Three people were treated in hospital during the outbreak and two are
still detained.
The meeting heard that Fife region is preparing a report for the
procurator-fiscal. It was also told that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has
power to prosecute the region if it was found to be negligent or to have
failed to take proper action.
Earlier yesterday, villagers expressed anger and concern as they
trooped to an emergency clinic to receive their vaccinations against the
potential risk of infection from hepatitis A.
Fife Health Board moved swiftly after identifying the virus, and
stressed yesterday that it should not be confused with any other form of
hepatitis, stating it was preventable by immunisation.
In what its director of public health, Dr Ian Jones, said was a
precautionary measure, it was decided to organise a three-day
vaccination programme for those affected -- about half the population of
the village.
The action also included vaccination for 200 employees of Kettle
Produce.
His advice to everyone over the age of six months and under the age of
40 who drank the contaminated water between March 6 and 10 was that they
should be vaccinated.
People over 40, he explained, generally have a natural immunity to the
virus which has caused severe sickness and enteritis.
Dr Jones said that special supplies of vaccine were delivered on
Wednesday, via the Blood Transfusion Service, allowing a team of three
doctors, nurses and support staff to begin the vaccination programme.
He said: ''Since the germ is passed through drinking water, it was
felt everyone who was exposed should have the opportunity of
vaccination.
''It can cause jaundice and abdominal pain, but is much less serious
than other forms.''
Villagers arriving at their Lumsden Memorial Hall yesterday praised
the health board for taking quick action, but were angry that they and
their children had suffered severe distress and illness.
First to arrive was Mrs Rosemary Abbott with her 18-month-old son
Patrick who was affected.
She said she was pleased the vaccination programme was taking place,
adding: ''It brings home the seriousness of this. People have been very
concerned.''
Mrs Jacqueline Winter, who brought her six-month-old baby Calum,
added: ''You always presume water is safe to drink and as a mother I am
always concerned that everything should be clean. We feel very angry.''
Her sister, Ms Sally Deas, who said she had suffered from nausea and
aching limbs said: ''This should not be allowed to happen in 1995,
particularly with children involved.''

LORD Lovat, the wartime commando leader and one of Scotland's most
prominent aristocrats, died yesterday at his Highland home, his family
said.
He died ''very peacefully'' at the age of 83, said a spokesman at
Beaufort Castle, Beauly, Inverness-shire.
Lord Lovat achieved wartime fame with the Lovat Scouts, and also
served with the Scots Guards and commanded the 1st Special Service
(Commando) Brigade.
Last year, the family was struck by a double tragedy when a younger
son Andrew died in a safari accident in Tanzania, and his elder brother
Simon, the Master of Lovat, died in a fall at Beaufort Castle.
Lord Lovat is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.
His title will pass to his grandson Simon Fraser, an 18-year-old
student at Harrow.
Lord Lovat was educated at Ampleforth and in 1945, directly after the
war, was Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
He became a prominent agriculturalist and enjoyed an international
reputation as a breeder and judge of beef cattle.
''He was enormously respected and liked by everyone in the area,'' the
family spokesman said.
Among those who paid tribute were Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy,
who said the Highlands had lost ''one of the great figures of the age''.
''With his passing we reflect upon one of the great heroic figures of
the twentieth century,'' said Mr Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and
Skye.
''His integrity and inspiration will live on long after him.
''It is particularly sad that Lord Lovat did not live to witness the
50th anniversary commemorations of VE-Day, on May 8.''
During his spectacular war service, Lord Lovat even came to the notice
of Hitler. His exploits put the Fuhrer into such a fury that he
personally ordered that he be ''exterminated'', and put a price of
100,000 marks on his head.

EXCLUSIVE
RADICAL switches in strategy and operations are being planned by the
Royal Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children --
right down to a change of name.
Senior officials admitted yesterday that income has been in
''freefall'' over the past four years, partly because of its role in the
Orkney child sex abuse case.
However, they were adamant the review of priorities and changes in
direction are due only to a need to reflect its current work. One source
said: ''It has been concluded that our image, affectionally known as
'the cruelty man,' is out of synch with what we do and where we are
going.''
The name change, after 111 years, is being flagged as necessary
because the initials are ''a recipe for confusion'' with other
organisations.
It will be unveiled on March 29 and will coincide with a massive
campaign to double income within 30 months.
Annual income has fallen from #2.7m to just over #2m since Lord Clyde
criticised RSSPCC methods in interviewing the nine Orkney children taken
into care and returned home five weeks later.
The society subsequently withdrew from its investigative role in abuse
cases and has no intention of returning to that minefield in its latest
refining of services. One official said the ''dynamic new name'' will be
a powerful statement of its priorities.
Ironically, the blunt ''no cash, no care'' message coincides with
renewed publicity over the Ayrshire ritual abuse case, which also
involved RSSPCC disclosure techniques. After almost five years in care,
seven children are in the process of being reunited with their families.
In the drift from inspectorate services, the society's main focus now
will be on prevention -- by helping families in need or people to
recover from past abuses.
Five resource centres have been set up to take referrals from
statutory bodies or meet direct approaches from individuals.
Specialist services, including long-term counselling and support of
''damaged'' adults as well as children, will be offered to local
authorities for a charge.
Asked what would happen if a child made allegations of sex abuse, one
source stressed the society's involvement would go no further than
reporting it to statutory authorities.
It was conceded that, in the aftermath of the Ayrshire and Orkney
debacles, people are more nervous than ever of ''blowing the whistle''
on suspicions.
An agency has been hired to boost income with 10% of the money raised
to go on ''hard hitting, provocative campaigns'' to raise awareness of
abuse, neglect, and family problems.
The society made more than 20 people redundant in 1992 because of the
slump in donations.
The society is adamant that its need to complement the statutory child
care bodies is greater than ever, and claims one in eight Scots have
been subjected to abuse when a child.
The name change will involve technical adjustments to the royal
charter, and the initials RSSPCC will be retained below the new logo.
The official launch of the new-look organisation will take place in
Glasgow at the annual general meeting in September, expected to be
attended by it president, Princess Margaret.
