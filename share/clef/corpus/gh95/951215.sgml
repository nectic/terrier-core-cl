Are school-cost
figures too basic to be meaningful?
asks Dick Louden
EVERY statistical tome emerging from the Scottish Office these days seems to
require the statutory health warning. It applies to the annual exam results,
the attendance and absence figures - even the apparently innocuous data on
school costs. However, if statements about playing fields not being level,
about like not being compared with like, seem depressingly familiar, they
should not be ignored on that account.
Theoretically it might be possible to find two schools which are so alike in
size and age of building, in the number of pupils they cater for, and in the
type of area they serve, that the costs of running them would be almost
identical. In practice it does not happen - or, to be more exact, if total
operational costs are very similar, a detailed breakdown would be certain to
show wide variations of spending in different areas such as property costs or
supplies and services.
Indeed, the problem with published data on school costs is that, except in the
odd case, it is of little practical value to school boards and parents. This is
because expenditure on individual schools is so massively concentrated on two
areas - staffing and building costs. Typically, these amount to around 93% of a
school's budgeted expenditure and, as a result, any significant changes in
patterns of spending elsewhere in the budget have minimal impact in overall
terms.
Though Devolved School Management increases the influence that schools and
their boards can have on deciding priorities for spending, that influence is
still exercised relatively at the margin.
Education authorities have traditionally set staffing levels for their schools,
sometimes enhanced for schools serving areas of deprivation but otherwise based
on a formula which treats all schools in similar fashion. Likewise, building
costs are determined in large measure by factors such as the level of occupancy
. . .
A building with a capacity of 1500 pupils and a roll of 1400 is much more
economical to operate than it would be if it had only 700 pupils. Thus, there
are really only two ways in which schools which are proving extremely expensive
to run can be tackled. Staffing levels can be substantially reduced (an option
which neither authorities nor parents are normally ready to countenance) or
under-used buildings can be closed (just about as popular as the staffing
option).
In cases like these, the only positive impact of national reports on school
costs is to remind people that they have an uncomfortable problem.
For those who are interested in going beyond the bland general data presented
in the Scottish Office's report, there is the opportunity to look at the
detailed line-by-line analysis contained in the budget statements issued by
authorities to their schools and school boards. These at least have the virtue
of demonstrating that schools of similar size and budget often disburse their
funds in somewhat different ways, usually beyond their control.
For instance, School A, with a roll of 556 and a budget of #1,563,000, incurs
teacher costs of #1,154,000 because, situated in a relatively prosperous area,
it has no staffing supplement. Its property costs, including #67,400 for rates,
run at the relatively economical figure of #174,700, but its only offsetting
income - #38,200 from the sale of meals to pupils - is comparatively high since
most of its pupils do not qualify for free school meals.
On the other hand, School B - situated in a deprived urban area - has a roll of
568 and a budget of #1,605,000. These figures are almost identical to those
applying to School A but there the similarity ends.
School B's staffing costs, at #1,279,000, are #125,000 higher because of extra
teachers allocated under the authority's social strategy. Its property costs,
abnormally high at #410,000 as against #174,700, include #169,350 for rates,
#96,460 for contract cleaning and #54,720 for the school's contract janitorial
service. Conversely, its substantial income of #349,900 against #38,200 for
School A owes little to the sale of meals - the majority of pupils qualify for
free meals - but a great deal (around #330,000) to payments made by various
organisations for the use of school accommodation.
The lesson to be learned from this may well be that the Scottish Office should
either go the whole way or not at all. Statistics which show that similar
schools have different overall expenditure are at best glib and at worst
dangerously misleading, since they offer no explanation for the perfectly
legitimate and unavoidable reasons behind the variations.
In its introduction, the report claims to provide ``basic information on
budgeted running costs''. Therein lies its problem. Perhaps it is too basic to
be meaningful.

It can be over #9000
per pupil, reports
Education Correspondent
Barclay McBain
WHEN it comes to comparing the secondary schools with the highest and lowest
per-pupil costs in Scotland, Glasgow's miles cheaper. Holyrood Secondary in the
south side of the city, with 2001 pupils on each of whom an average of #2145
was spent, is also miles distant from the school with the highest published
per-pupil costs, Sanday Junior High in Orkney. Its running cost per pupil was
#11,334, more than five times as much as the Holyrood figure.
There are, of course, very good reasons for the huge gap in spending. Holyrood,
the biggest local authority school in Scotland, can achieve unmatched economies
of scale in the state sector. Sanday, on the other hand, had only 16 pupils
over whom to spread its costs which are, in any case, higher because several
teachers have to be flown in from the mainland.
Finbar Moynihan, Holyrood's headteacher, believes that using raw data to make
comparisons between schools - whether on examination performance or the cost of
education - is invidious. He points out that island schools like Sanday which
serve isolated populations are the souls of the community, and deserve to be
supported.
He says: ``I don't think everything is relatable to size. What does it tell
you? Not a lot. We have a good school, good teachers, good parental commitment,
and a good ethos. We are working hard on the quality of teaching and learning,
on attendance, and on improving our examination results, but we do so under
constraints.''
Overcrowding is a major problem at Holyrood. The magnet Roman Catholic
secondary runs 13 first-and second-year classes with the maximum of 33 pupils,
20 in practical classes. ``There are spin-offs in terms of the timetable. We
can place more staff in the upper school, but we are still in an expanding
situation,'' says the head.
The school's first-year intake has been set at 396 by a sheriff court ruling
and the impact is working its way through the school, expected to culminate in
a maximum roll of 2147 in two years. The pressure on accommodation should be
eased, however, by expenditure on new classrooms.
Mr Moynihan is, none the less, concerned about the roll-based points system
which allows additional promoted staff to be appointed. The extra points show
big jumps at certain roll-related stages but tail off after a school's pupil
numbers go beyond 1301, perhaps reflecting the fact that there are few
secondaries with bigger rolls - 24 with more than 1300 pupils, only two with
more than 1700, only one (Holyrood) with more than 1900.
Similarly, there are concerns about whether the formula for appointing
technical and ancillary staff actually reflects Holyrood's roll. In these
circumstances the savings linked to size can actually be a deficit.
``While some people might say I should be jumping up and down, that it is
wonderful to have the lowest per-pupil costs, I don't think it accurately
reflects what is going on in the school, and whether parents are getting value
for money,'' says Mr Moynihan.
The roll at Sanday Junior High has increased to 25 since the date on which this
year's running costs are based, but headteacher Roderick Thorne recognises that
its costs will always be among the highest. Living on an island, the Sanday
pupils can transfer to Kirkwall Grammar at the end of second or fourth year.
In 1994 all pupils took the earlier option, but this year nine out of ten
stayed on, perhaps reflecting that fact that the Sanday campus has become a
community school, with its own swimming pool and dance hall.
Staffing at Sanday is a complex business. Mr Thorne is the maths teacher, and
only two other full-time members of staff live on the island, with teachers of
technical education, RE, music and home economics all flying over from the
mainland.
A similar situation applies at North Walls Junior High, also in Orkney, which
had the highest cost of #18,444 last year. This year, however, the Scottish
Office decided not to publish costs for schools with fewer than five pupils. In
September 1994 North Walls had a roll of four, which could have given a
per-pupil cost of about #25,000.
Aided by the arrival of two new families, the roll has grown to ten. According
to head teacher Kenneth Michie, removal of the threat of closure may have
influenced the decision of one pupil to become the first to stay on into third
year.

<HEADLINE>Privatisation scheme delayed after cool reaction from banks and building societies Student loan changes dropped</HEADLINE>

THE Government's plans for privatising student loans were thrown into disarray
yesterday, with the announcement that the scheme will be delayed for a year.
Ministers had hoped that banks and building societies could be persuaded to
back a privatised scheme to be introduced next year, but Education Minister
Eric Forth said yesterday that no scheme could be brought in before October
1997 - well after the last possible date for the next General Election.
The official explanation for the delay is that banks and building societies,
which would be able to compete for the provision of loans with the Student
Loans Company, based in Glasgow, cannot get the required technology set up in
time.
However, Opposition MPs claimed that the private sector simply was not
interested and was alarmed by the weight of bad debt and the danger of
alienating students they hoped would become future customers.
Mr Bryan Davies, Labour's Higher Education spokesman, said: ``The Government
has effectively admitted that its student loans proposals are a flop. The
banks
are simply not interested.''
The announcement of the delay came on the second day of the Commons committee
stage of the Student Loans Bill, and led to immediate calls for the whole
exercise to be abandoned.
Glasgow Maryhill Labour MP Maria Fyfe, the only Scottish MP on the committee,
said last night: ``There is no point in Parliament considering this any
further
because Labour would not implement a Bill of this nature, and, following what
we have just been told, it will not come into effect until after the next
General Election. The Government's efforts to put this through have become a
shambles.''
Mr Davies said: ``Ministers should never have proceeded without first having
secured detailed agreement with the private sector. It is particularly bizarre
that when, on Tuesday morning, Labour proposed a 12-month delay in the
implementation of new arrangements with the banks, this was rejected by
Ministers. They have now performed a spectacular U-turn.''
The student loans legislation formed a key part of the Queen's Speech, but
banks and other financial institutions already had told the Government they
wanted nothing to do with it.
The Midland Bank is reported to have told the National Union of Students that
during discussions with the Department for Education and Employment it had
been
unable to resolve a number of concerns on issues such as administrative
complexity, risk identification, profitablity and customer reaction.
A spokeswoman for the department confirmed yesterday that the target date for
implementation of any scheme which could be agreed with the banks now had been
changed from October 1996 to October 1997.
She confirmed that Mr Forth told MPs the reasons cited in the committee
included the complications presented by bank mergers and difficulties over new
technology.
The spokeswoman said: ``We have listened to what the banks had to say during
consultation on the draft invitation to tender. They were concerned about
getting their scheme up and running by the beginning of the next academic
year.
We have taken account of that and are focusing efforts on getting a scheme up
and running by the following academic year.''
Asked whether any banks or building societies had committed themselves to
joining an eventual scheme, the spokeswoman said discussions were continuing.
A spokesman for the National Union of Students said: ``It was obvious that the
banks and students themselves saw the flaws in this scheme to privatise loans.
Now it is clear that the Government does as well.''

SCOTTISH Opera's cash crisis is driving its most talented musicians away from
Scotland, general director Richard Jarman told MPs yesterday, as he appealed
for lottery funds to meet running costs.
Giving evidence to the National Heritage Select Committee, Mr Jarman said the
decision to reduce Scottish Opera to part-time working would prompt artists to
seek employment elsewhere.
``Indeed, there is evidence that is happening. Key members of the organisation
are already seeking jobs elsewhere which is an extremely worrying fact,'' he
said.
Unless Parliament agreed to change the rules and allow lottery proceeds to be
used for running costs and not just building costs, opera companies around the
UK would struggle to survive. ``I find it difficult to believe that there are
going to be enough buildings to refurbish or build in Scotland. If meantime
organisations like Scottish Opera have been allowed to wither and decline, who
is going to fill those buildings?'' he said.
In written evidence to the committee, he warned: ``The result is likely to be a
downgrading of the company's staffing, a loss of artistic quality and the
draining of talent and skills away from Scotland."

POP impresario Pete Waterman could face a large damages bill after one of his
charter trains was derailed early yesterday in north London, temporarily
halting all services in and out of Euston station. No-one was hurt.
Waterman, part of the Stock, Aitken and Waterman team of music producers,
recently has become a rail buff. Earlier this year, he bought British Rail's
charter train service Special Trains and set up Waterman Railways.
A spokesman for Railtrack, which launched an inquiry, said: ``Train operating
companies can claim compensation from Railtrack if their services are
disrupted. If it turned out to be another party at fault, they might have to
pay.''

GOVERNMENT and Opposition Transport teams clashed yesterday over the likely
drain on or benefit to the public purse anticipated from the rail privatisation
programme.
Shadow Transport team Clare Short and Brian Wilson claimed that the long-term
cost to the taxpayer of selling off the rail industry would be #850m a year -
or #1600 every minute - in addition to more than #1bn of costs incurred in the
lead-in to privatisation.
However, Transport Minister John Watts dismissed these arguments as ``absurd''
and Transport Secretary Sir George Young maintained that rail privatisation
would actually provide a boost for taxpayers.
Labour published fresh analysis of the official figures, showing what the party
claims is the ``hidden cost'' to the public purse after privatisation including:
q #600m in additional subsidy paid to the 25 train operating companies by the
Office of Passenger Rail Franchising.
q #12m in additional subsidy paid to freight operators to cover track access
charges.
q #220m in higher grants paid by the Government to local authorities in
metropolitan areas to compensate them because after rail privatisation they
will be charged the full cost of using rail services by the Passenger Transport
Authorities.
q #17m to run two new ``quangos'' created to oversee the new network.
Shadow Transport Secretary Clare Short said: ``Every minute of every day,
taxpayers are going to pay #1600 extra subsidy, not for better rail services,
not for safer stations, but simply to keep the shareholders of Railtrack
happy.''
Mr Watts dismissed Labour's claims, saying that the level of subsidy would
remain ``broadly the same'' following the sell-off.
``Labour's claims about an extra #600m for the 25 train operating companies are
absolute rubbish. We fully expect that the new railways will provide better
quality of services to passengers at less cost to taxpayers,'' he said.
At a news conference in London, Mr Wilson said that Mr Major had seriously
misled the Commons earlier this week when he claimed that investment was rising
on the railways.
Mr Wilson said: ``In fact, investment in the domestic railway is currently at
its lowest level since nationalisation in 1948.''
Sir George was reacting to the July report by the all-party Commons committee
on rail finances which had concluded that privatisation would not provide
improved revenue or reduced costs.
Such an outlook was unrealistic, he said, pointing to the improvements in
efficiency and choice that would flow from privatisation.
Sir George added: ``The Government is confident that its privatisation
programme represents excellent value for money for taxpayers and passengers and
will bring significant benefits.''

A FORMER student who conducted a long-running campaign of abuse against
Aberdeen University and its officials yesterday tendered an unqualified apology.
Peter Dow also promised a judge that he would end his campaign immediately.
Last month at the Court of Session, Lord Kirkwood found Dow in contempt of
court and breach of interdict for continuing his action in defiance of court
orders.
Dow, 29, has disrupted university meetings and issued thousands of leaflets as
part of his crusade. He has likened the Principal, Professor Maxwell Irvine, to
Hitler and Stalin.
In October 1990, Dow, of Hollybank Place, Aberdeen, enrolled at Aberdeen as a
post-graduate student. The following year his dissertation was failed by the
university.
Dow started his campaign and the university obtained an interdict banning him
from distributing defamatory leaflets but the campaign continued.
Yesterday, he appeared again at the Court of Session so that Lord Kirkwood
could consider whether to impose a custodial sentence.
Lord Kirkwood said  that while Dow's conduct had been ``quite disgraceful'' he
had now tendered an unqualified apology and given a formal undertaking that he
would cease his campaign.
In the circumstances, he had decided, with some hesitation, to defer
consideration of the penalty for 12 months.

Corruption charge police officer freed
A GRAMPIAN Police officer was cleared of charges of corruption and attempting
to defeat the ends of justice, at the High Court in Aberdeen yesterday.
The jury of nine women and five men took two hours and 10 minutes to decide
that Constable Neil Cooper, 36, should go free.
He had denied throughout his 17-day trial that he failed to fulfil his duty as
a police officer by not investigating a crime committed by drug dealer Ronald
Cormack.
Cormack is currently serving a 15-year sentence imposed earlier this year for
drug and firearms offences.
It was alleged Mr Cooper, of Springdale Crescent, Aberdeen, had told him he was
to be investigated and to get rid of any firearms he had and, prior to
interviewing him, told him the questions he would be asked and advised him of
the answers he should give.
The jury unanimously found the charge not proven.
He was also charged with failing in his duty, with intent to defeat the ends of
justice, by not reporting or investigating the involvement of Cormack in a
housebreaking in which he told him he had taken part.
The jury found Mr Cooper not guilty of that charge by a majority and returned
the same verdict on the third charge, that he corruptly accepted #6000 and a
number of subsequent payments for providing Cormack with details of police
intelligence about his drug-dealing operations.
Mr Cooper, who along with three other officers still faces possible dismissal
from Grampian Police under disciplinary proceedings, showed no emotion as the
jury foreman read out the verdicts.
However, as she read out ``not guilty'' to the third charge, his wife Catriona,
34, burst into tears and other friends and family members applauded and cheered.
Afterwards, with his wife by his side as he left court, he said: ``I basically
just wish to thank my wife, my family, my friends, some close colleagues from
Grampian Police who have stuck by me through all this, and especially my legal
team for their efforts throughout my case.''
Mr Cooper said other than ``to go for a pint'', he had no plans for the future
and did not know if he would be able to resume his police career.
Yesterday, a spokesman for the Crown Office said: ``Crown counsel are giving
further consideration to the cases against the other officers.'' No decision on
internal police disciplinary proceedings will be made until all the outstanding
criminal proceedings have been completed.
Following yesterday's verdict, Grampian's deputy chief constable David Garbutt
said: ``I am more than satisfied that the actions of my senior officers in
beginning this investigation have been fully justified.''

<HEADLINE>Pressure group calls on MP to back fight against reprocessing spent US nuclear fuel Ballot rejects Dounreay plan</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROSS Highland Correspondent</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974880784</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE people of Caithness, traditionally the most pro-nuclear community in
Scotland, have voted in a referendum two to one against Dounreay accepting
contracts to reprocess spent nuclear fuel of American origin which is
stockpiled at 33 research reactors across Europe.
Friends of the Earth Scotland also published the results of a poll of 1037
voters across Scotland which showed that 94% were opposed to the plant doing
the work.
The Caithness poll was commissioned by the Caithness Against Nuclear Dumping
(Cand) group. It recorded 7091 (65.5%) opposed to foreign reprocessing; 3741
(34.5%) in favour; with only 45 spoilt papers.
Cand immediately called on Caithness and Sutherland MP Robert Maclennan, who
last month described the vote as an attempted fraud, to decide whether he was
prepared to support and fight for the clear wishes of his constituents on this
issue. Dounreay's director, Mr John Baxter, dismissed the result as a
propaganda exercise and a stunt.
The Caithness referendum is being seen as highly significant by most observers,
not least the turn-out of 52.7% which was almost 8% higher than the average
turn-out for the elections to the new Highland Council last spring.
A spokesman for the Electoral Reform Society, which conducted the poll, told
The Herald a figure of about 20% was very common in such ballots and concluded:
``There is no doubt that 50% is a fairly good response rate.''
The result means that about 35% of the existing electoral roll in Caithness
have voted against reprocessing.
Cand had to raise the #10,000 costs of the referendum from a public appeal.
Cand chairman Stephen Pottinger said yesterday: ``We are absolutely delighted
with this solid and impressive result. Our main aim was to give the people of
Caithness their say on an issue which would have a long-term impact on their
county.
``Their view is clear and their voice must be heard. Dounreay and the
Governments of the UK and US must listen to the people of the area and act
accordingly.''
Mr Pottinger, who farms in Caithness, was also scathing of those councillors
who had attacked the referendum: ``It is difficult to see how the Caithness
members of the new Highland Council can criticise the referendum when more
people voted in it than turned out for their own election. We elect them to
fight for us and that's what they should now do.''
Mrs Lorraine Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, said that for the past
two years the US Government had been consulting its public over the issue but,
here, Dounreay and the authorities had sought to keep the question of the
reprocessing contracts secret.
Mr Maclennan, however, put a different construction on the vote. ``This opinion
poll offers encouragement to those who want to see Dounreay's work continue.
Approximately two-thirds of the electorate have shown, either by not responding
or by voting in favour of reprocessing that they are not anxious about this
work.
``But the concerns of those who have registered anxieties do require to be
addressed. This is a job for the regulatory bodies, for the UK Atomic Energy
Authority and for Government Ministers. The public needs the facts; they must
all be presented fully, clearly, and openly.''
Mr Baxter, meanwhile, said: ``This so-called referendum was no more than
another propaganda exercise undertaken by Greenpeace International, albeit
fronted by Cand. We denounced it at the outset and do not accept its result.''
He added: ``Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is an activity which is very
tightly regulated and which provides valuable employment in Caithness. It would
be irresponsible for us to stop it because of this stunt.
``However, we accept that the local community is a vital stakeholder in
Dounreay and that we must be adequately open and listen to it. But a rushed
referendum is not the way to judge whether the community understands what we do
and is content with it.''

THE Accounts Commission is to investigate the financial administration of an
Ayrshire council following concern over its existing systems.
An independent financial adviser will be appointed in the coming weeks and will
``take an overview'' within Kyle and Carrick District Council, until the
handover to South Ayrshire Council on April 1, next year.
The move follows discussions involving senior council officials and the
Controller of Audit, Mr Robert Black, who was accompanied by senior colleagues.
Mr Ian Welsh, leader of the council's minority Labour group and shadow South
Ayrshire Council leader, last night expressed his concern at the decision, and
said he would be seeking further information.
He said: ``It is absolutely crucial that all steps are taken within Kyle and
Carrick District Council, by both members and officers, to ensure a smooth
transition to the new South Ayrshire Authority.
``I am concerned that the Controller of Audit has found something which he is
not satisfied with in the council's financial administration, and I will be
seeking more details from officials.''
While there is no suggestion of dishonesty and the financial probity of the
council is not in question, it is understood that the investigation will centre
on the devolvement of financial control to departments.

THE Government's bid to woo City investors for nuclear privatisation suffered a
triple whammy yesterday.
It began with an adviser to the Tory-dominated Commons Trade and Industry
Select Committee confirming he was the co-author of a study warning that
taxpayers faced an extra bill for #3000m if the sales went ahead.
It ended with Friends of the Earth insisting that issues which forced Ministers
to scrap the 1989 bid to sell the industry are ``as real and unresolved today
as they were then'' - and Labour MP Brian Wilson calling for the latest attempt
to be abandoned.
Mr Wilson's Ayrshire constitutency, Cunninghame North, includes Hunterston B
power station, which apparently would have to be offered cheaply to attract a
buyer.
Mr Gordon McKerron of Sussex University, an expert in nuclear industry
economics, yesterday acknowledged he co-authored an unpublished report lodged
with the select committee.
His study suggested that taxpayers faced an extra bill of #3000m just to meet
the Government's target sale price of #3500m.
The taxpayers' cash would go towards removing the private investors' risks by
covering the industry's long-term liabilities - in particular, decommissioning
and clean-up costs when stations reach the end of their lives.
Mr McKerron, as an adviser to the committee, declined to comment on the
findings - commissioned by Friends of the Earth and the Coalition of Opposing
Local Authorities before his Government appointment.
However, co-author Mike Sadnicki, unrestrained by such protocol, said the City
would now want many answers over liabilities before even contemplating support
for the sale.
He added that Hunterston B - along with Dungeness B, Hartlepool, and Hinkley
Point B in England - would be hard to privatise unless their prices were
depressed, because they are not competitive with other forms of power
generation.
The Hunterston station's production costs are put at 2.79p a unit above market
rates, according to the study.
Torness, Scotland's other nuclear station to be sold, would fare a little
better, despite being 2.25p a unit above market rates - thanks to a longer
productivity lifespan. It is due to operate until 2023, compared with 2011 for
Hunterston B.
The City is due to receive Government briefings in the new year, weeks before
evidence is taken, if at all, on the findings of the academics.
Mr Sadnicki said: ``Torness comes out with a small, positive net value. But
whether it is enough for investors to think it worth while is difficult to
judge.''
Dr Patrick Green, Friends of the Earth nuclear campaigner, said concerns about
decommissioning bills led the Government to scrap its attempt to sell the
industry in 1989.
He added: ``The issues that sank privatisation then are as real and unresolved
today.''
Dr Green said there was no evidence that privatisation made sense or
represented value for money.
He warned that the Government would be in breach of European laws if the
nuclear industry were sold as a result of ``subsidies'' to the private sector
from taxpayers covering the long-term clean-up bills.
Mr Wilson, a former member of the Commons committee investigating the sell-off,
said the Government should call a halt now but predicted it would press on
because it wanted privatisation proceeds next year.
He also forecast that taxpayers would be left with a huge bill while profitable
parts were sold to the private sector.

CHEATING wife Pollyanna Peate was cleared by a jury yesterday of the
manslaughter of her ageing lover, Mr Brian Phillips.
The 34-year-old mother-of-two, who carried on a 10-year affair with grandfather
Mr Phillips, 62, after rehearsals with Frodsham Silver Band in Cheshire, showed
no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict after less than 45 minutes.
However, her husband, Graham, 36, who sat in the public gallery at Chester
Crown Court throughout the trial, wept as he hugged her outside the court.
Mrs Peate refused to make any comment to newsmen and Mr Peate would say only:
``We are very relieved that it is all over and that Polly has been vindicated.''
Mrs Peate, a euphonium player, of Runcorn, had denied killing bass trombonist
Mr Phillips on the night of November 15, 1994.
The four-day trial heard that the couple regularly had sex in Mr Phillips's car
in a lovers' lane after rehearsals with the band. They kept the affair secret
from their marital partners but it had been ``an open secret'' among their
fellow musicians.
On the night Mr Phillips died, the couple had gone to the lane as usual for sex
in the back of the car and Mr Phillips had told Mrs Peate it was to be the last
time they would have sex together.
The prosecution alleged that Mrs Peate struck Mr Phillips about the head at
least four times, sparking the heart attack that killed him. However, the jury
accepted Mrs Peate's claim that she had not attacked him and that he had died
while they were making love.
She told the court: ``He died having sex. I'm sorry but that's how it happened.
I've got nothing to admit.''
Mrs Sybil Phillips met Mrs Peate when the band was performing but was unaware
of the relationship with her husband, whom she married almost 40 years ago when
she was 19.
She kept away from court during the trial but told police: ``I was totally
unaware . . . that Polly and my husband were having an affair . . . It has come
as a great shock to me.''
Mrs Peate had started the affair not long after the birth of her second child,
and told the court she loved her husband and had been happy with him, though he
had been a gambler.
When police questioned Mr Peate, he said: ``I would describe my marriage as
perfect. My wife and I get on together and I trust her implicitly.''
Mrs Peate is from the West Bromwich area. She worked for a while in a
supermarket and a pub, and later gave part-time music lessons. She and her
husband are ``born-again'' Christians.
The band appears to have been a fertile ground for extra-marital relationships.
Among the witnesses in the case were band vice-chairman Terence Hoppley and his
wife, Carolyn.
They, too, met through the band, had an affair, and set up home together in
Saltney, near Chester. Mr Phillips was best man at their wedding earlier last
year and was also godfather to their daughter.
Mrs Hoppley told police she was aware of a ``chemistry'' between Mrs Peate and
Mr Phillips and had heard her husband and Mr Phillips joke about ``going down
to the marshes''.
After Mr Phillips died during their sex session, Mrs Peate walked back into
Frodsham and called a taxi home, where her husband noticed blood on her face.
Mrs Peate told police that she had gone to bed with her husband and made love -
but claimed that she was thinking about Mr Phillips.

SHELTER Scotland yesterday claimed that its latest survey exposed the extent of
the housing crisis in Scotland.
The survey showed that, for the fourth year running, more than 40,000
households applied to councils as homeless and almost 186,000 households were
on council house waiting lists.
Despite Shelter's claims of a crisis, however, the figures showed that, in the
past two years, there had been a decline of 5% in homelessness applications to
councils. The total now stands at 40,734.
Council waiting lists have also been shortened, from 188,688 in 1994 to 185,922
this year.
The Shelter survey comes hard on the heels of the announcement by Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth of a 20% cut in housing investment next year.
Shelter's Scottish director, Ms Liz Nicholson, claimed that if the level of
investment were equal to that of 1989, an extra 27,000 houses would have been
built.
She went on: ``Mr Forsyth claims to be a listening Secretary of State. I would
like him also to go and see the misery and the human cost of homelessness.''
Commenting on the survey, Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson insisted
that waiting lists themselves were poor indicators of housing need. Many people
registered on the lists of more than one authority and sometimes failed to
cancel the registration when a home was found.

Moscow, Thursday
FIGHTING flared across Chechnya today in a bloody challenge to Moscow's attempt
to include the rebel territory in a parliamentary poll on Sunday which looks
set to bring communists back to the fore.
The clashes, the heaviest in months, grabbed the spotlight from campaigning in
the general election in which communists are expected to make the best showing
despite President Boris Yeltsin's appeals to prevent them from securing more
influence.
Yeltsin remains in a sanatorium after suffering his second mild heart attack in
four months. One of his top aides told a television interviewer that Yeltsin
would announce in February whether he would stand for re-election in June.
The Chechen rebels seized parts of the mountainous region's second town
Gudermes in an early morning raid, sparking the heaviest fighting for months in
the battle-scarred region, where voting started early for security reasons.
``They (Chechen rebels) have taken almost the entire town,'' one soldier told
Reuters outside Gudermes after firing frantically into the air to stop a car
with reporters.
Interfax news agency quoted Russia's military command as saying that the
fighting had died down in the evening.
Sniper fire continued and the rebels still held part of the town. Russian news
reports said fighting had spread to two other Chechen towns.
The clashes added weight to rebel warnings that the poll would lead to renewed
warfare in Chechnya, where Russia has failed to crush a four-year rebellion
despite heavy casualties.
It made Sunday's vote seem virtually meaningless in Chechnya and cast a shadow
over preparations for polling in the rest of the vast Russian federation, where
43 parties and thousands of candidates are competing for seats.
Russia's State ORT television said Yeltsin had recorded a television address to
be broadcast tomorrow to the nation's 104 million voters, who are spread across
11 time zones.
Yeltsin holds the most power under Russia's 1993 constitution but he has made
no secret of his concern that the communists might form the biggest party in
parliament.
Asked whether Yeltsin would run for a second five-year term in June's
presidential election, the president's top security aide, Alexander Korzhakov
said: ``The president will speak about this in February.''
``Will he or won't he. This is indeed the greatest problem,'' said the burly
Korzhakov, who is credited by some observers with wielding great influence over
the president.
``When we criticise the president, we sometimes don't think what will start if
he doesn't run. It seems to me nothing good will come of it.''
Korzhakov also obliquely criticised Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, who is in
charge of the Chechnya campaign, saying the minister was ``particularly
talented at staging parades''.
Most polls say only five or six parties will score above five percent - the
communists, Our Home is Russia, the liberal Yabloko grouping, Zhirinovsky's
party and the moderate nationalist Congress of Russian Communities, whose main
asset is a charismatic retired general, Alexander Lebed.
But opinion surveys are notoriously unreliable in Russia, and failed to predict
the success of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic
Party in the last parliamentary poll in 1993.
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin says he expects to stay in office whatever
the result, but a poor showing by his centrist Our Home is Russia bloc could
wound him politically and rule him out as a possible successor to
Yeltsin.-Reuter.

Verona, Thursday
ITALIAN officials said today that engine failure appeared to have caused the
crash of a Romanian airliner in northern Italy, which killed all 49 people on
board.
``We cannot rule out any hypothesis but it looks like there was a power loss in
one engine,'' said Francesco Caramuzza, under-secretary of state at the
interior ministry.
Weather conditions at the time of the crash last night were also being
investigated after one government official said the crew turned down an offer
by the airport to de-ice the plane before take-off.
The Banat Air Transport charter flight, bound for Timisoara and Bucharest in
Romania, crashed in a field in snowy weather shortly after take-off from
Verona's Villafranca airport.
The Russian-built twin-prop Antonov 24 burst into flames, killing the 41
passengers and eight Romanian crew. ``I heard a loud explosion, the house shook
and when I opened the door I saw hell - a huge fire in the darkness,'' said
Sergio Sambugara, who lives near the airport and whose wife alerted authorities
to the crash.
Thirty-one of the passengers were Italian, six were Romanian and four were
citizens of former Yugoslavia.
Only the tailpiece and a few other sections of the plane were recognisable
among debris strewn over a 200-yard area. The wreckage burned for most of the
night.
Victims' relatives helped doctors identify the bodies at a nearby military
base. Many were charred beyond recognition.
Local magistrate Carlo Giulio Schinaia said that by tonight eight bodies had
been identified, 14 others had not been named and the rest were identified with
``almost certainty''.
Schinaia, who is leading an investigation into the crash, told a news
conference that doctors would also conduct DNA tests on the victims to help
confirm their identities.
He said a transport ministry committee had been named to assist in the
investigation. A preliminary report on the cause was expected in two days and
weather conditions would be investigated.
``We offered to de-ice the plane, but the crew refused,'' airport director
Francesco Canfarelli told reporters. `During the same time period, an Air
France plane was de-iced twice before take-off.''
Romanian officials said they ruled out a terrorist attack.
The crash was the second major accident involving a Romanian carrier this year.
On March 31, a Tarom airlines Airbus A310 crashed just after take-off from
Bucharest's Otopeni international airport, killing all 60 passengers and crew.
q The search for an airliner that disappeared in the Russian Far East a week
ago widened today, and the region's chief administrator asked Japan and China
if they could provide any clues to its fate.
Rescue services told Russian news agencies they had drawn a blank yet again on
the eighth day of their hunt for the Khabarovsk Airlines Tupolev Tu-154 with 97
aboard. But they vowed to continue until the mystery was solved.
The search has been concentrated in a 50-mile by 125-mile corridor from the
waters of the Tatar Strait across the wooded and snow-covered mountains of the
mainland that the three-engined jet should have crossed on its hour-long flight
to Khabarovsk from Sakhalin Island.
Itar-Tass news agency quoted local officials at the Emergency Services ministry
as saying some of the most likely places for the plane to have come down had
already been surveyed two or three times from the air.
The multiple search, involving ski and foot patrols, 14 low-flying helicopters,
five fixed-wing aircraft, satellite photography and five warships, widened out
today, Interfax news agency quoted a local rescue official as saying.
Khabarovsk is only 30 miles from the Chinese frontier. A similar distance
separates Sakhalin from the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.
Ishayev said the security services believed it was highly unlikely a bomb
brought down the plane, Interfax said.
The disappearance of the plane, days after two fatal crashes in Azerbaijan in
which 50 people were killed, revived concern about air safety in the former
Soviet Union.
Yesterday, three Russian Su-27 fighters smashed into a mountain in Vietnam,
killing all four aboard as they returned from an air show in Malaysia.-Reuter.

Paris, Thursday
A THREE-WEEK public sector strike began to falter today as a limited train
service was set to resume in parts of France and key unions held out the
prospect of a return to work despite new protests set for the weekend.
Transport chaos still gripped the country after most rail workers voted to
continue their stoppage in spite of this week's retreat by Prime Minister Alain
Juppe on pensions and a plan to streamline the indebted state rail company SNCF.
But there were signs the strikes were losing momentum.
The SNCF said that limited regional rail services would resume in northern
France tomorrow as drivers from 19 of 345 SNCF work sites voted to return to
work and the FGAAC union, which represents a third of SNCF drivers, called for
stoppages to end.
The SNCF in Lille said some trains would run from 23 stations in northern
France.
``Many trains are likely to run,'' including six high-speed TGV trains between
Lille and Roissy, home to Paris's main Charles de Gaulle international airport,
it said in a statement.
Normal service also would be operated to and from Belgium.
Trade union officials said the region was unusual in that the moderate FGAAC
drivers' union held a majority in the area.
Crippling strikes have shut down the French rail system nationwide for three
weeks as workers stay away in protest at government welfare reform proposals
and an SNCF restructuring plan that unions fear would threaten jobs, service
and benefits.
According to the SNCF, assemblies at work sites including the Saint Lazare
staion in Paris, Strasbourg, Nancy and Calais voted to call off their stoppage.
The communist-led CGT union, however, would confirm only the votes at Saint
Lazare and in the Strasbourg region.
In the capital, one of 13 Metro underground rail lines resumed briefly for the
first time since the dispute began before shutting down an hour and a half
later. Six percent of buses were running, slightly more than the recent average.
Outside the transport sector, there were more signs the strikers' resolve was
weakening. Just 3% of post office workers stayed at home compared with 6% at
the end of last week and 5% of civil servants were on strike versus 20%.
Financial markets rallied. The stock market rose 2.25% and the franc
strengthened to 3.4470 to the German mark from 3.4660 yesterday.
The two unions spearheading the strikes, the independent Force Ouvriere (FO)
and the CGT, vowed to carry on. They planned a new national day of protest on
Saturday in an effort to convince Juppe to back down further.
Air traffic controllers planned limited strikes tomorrow and three doctors'
unions planned a Paris protest on Sunday.
But in a conciliatory move, FO suggested discussing terms for a return to work.
``We feel that it is necessary, if we want to show a desire for conciliation at
this meeting, to set the traditional conditions for a return to work after a
long conflict'', FO said in a letter to Juppe.
The tough talking appeared to be an attempt to squeeze more concessions out of
Juppe ahead of what could be the unions' grand finale of mass demonstrations at
the weekend.
CGT leader Louis Viannet accused the prime minister of playing for time and
underestimating the seriousness of the crisis by delaying a labour summit
proposed for December 21.
Both the CGT and FO leaders urged Juppe to move up the summit date and expand
its agenda to include his bitterly contested welfare reforms, which the prime
minister insists are not negotiable.-Reuter.

Damascus, Thursday
SYRIA has freed 1200 members and supporters of the banned Muslim Brotherhood
group and prepared to free scores of other prisoners, officials and political
sources said today.
They said the measures were made to commemorate the 25th anniversary of
President Hafez al-Assad's ``correctionist movement'', a bloodless coup which
brought him to power on November 16, 1970.
It was the biggest release of political prisoners connected to the Muslim
Brotherhood, which is banned in Syria, since the government crushed an armed
uprising led by the group in 1982.
Political sources said the amnesty also allowed Brotherhood leaders who have
been in exile to return to Syria. Presidential spokesman Joubran Kourieh told
Reuters that Assad sent today an amnesty law to parliament which should lead to
the freeing of scores more prisoners.
q Leah Rabin, widow of the murdered Israeli premier, said today Pope John Paul
had told her he acknowledged Israel's proclamation of a ``double role'' for
Jerusalem as capital of the Jewish state and of the world's three great
faiths.-Reuter.

German justice
minister resigns
BONN: German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, 44, resigned
in protest yesterday after her Free Democratic Party, junior partner in the
ruling coalition, voted to back a tough wire-tapping law.
She said she could no longer defend her party's policy credibly after a
membership referendum voted by 63 to 36% to back a constitutional amendment
that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats have been pressing for. The
change made no difference to Kohl's razor-thin 10-seat majority in parliament.
Nigeria rapped
UNITED NATIONS: A General Assembly committee yesterday overwhelmingly condemned
Nigeria's ``arbitrary execution, after a flawed judicial process,'' of writer
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists. By a vote of 98-12, with 42
abstentions, it also invited the UN Human Rights Commission to ``give urgent
attention'' to the rights situation in Nigeria.
Hong Kong talks
BEIJING: Britain and China finally sat down yesterday to discuss the ceremonies
to mark the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Diplomats accredited to the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group opened the talks in Beijing, journalists
reported from the Chinese capital.
Goose's revenge
AMSTERDAM: A hunter was taken to hospital with concussion and a broken
cheekbone after being felled by a dead goose. Anne Osinga said he did not see
the 6!slb goose which plunged 75ft after being shot by one of his companions.
``I was aiming with one eye shut,'' Amsterdam's de Telegraaf newspaper reported
the 60-year-old former headmaster as saying yesterday. The incident failed to
dent his appetite. ``I'm going to eat it with pleasure,'' he said.
1000 stranded
ROME: About 1000 motorists were stranded on a snowbound road in central Italy
yesterday after spending the night in their cars, police said. Tailbacks
stretched up to 12 miles on the main Bologna to Florence motorway and drivers
who were heading south were stuck for up to 20 hours.
Airline rescued
MADRID: EU transport commissioner Neil Kinnock yesterday bailed out
financially-crippled Iberia, Spain's national airline, by approving government
funding amounting to #535m. The move, which came despite bitter opposition from
rival airlines, will mean that the airline can be restructured.
Pilot hunt
WASHINGTON: Defence officials yesterday cautiously greeted Baghdad's
``humanitarian'' gesture in allowing a US military team into Iraq to search for
the body of an American  Navy pilot missing since the Gulf War. A team of 11 US
military experts and four civilians led by the International Committee of the
Red Cross searched a remote desert site in western Iraq.
EU protest
BRUSSELS: The European Union added its voice yesterday to the global clamour of
disapproval at the imprisonment for 14 years of Chinese human rights activist
Wei Jingsheng. Wei, 46, was sentenced in Beijing on Wednesday after being found
guilty of conspiring to pervert the government.
Flu epidemic
MOSCOW: An epidemic of influenza has sharply worsened in Moscow with more than
52,000 people falling ill in the past 24 hours and authorities have temporarily
closed the capital's schools to cope with the outbreak. The total number of flu
victims in the city since the epidemic officially broke out on November 28 is
approaching half a million.

THE estate of Jackie Kennedy Onassis is to go under the hammer in a major sale
at Sotheby's in New York.
The four-day sale in April is expected to raise about #3.2m for some 1200
items, including the desk on which President John Kennedy signed the 1963
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
Other objects offered will include a Rauschenberg portrait of the couple during
the 1960 presidential campaign and a pair of obelisks that sat in the Red Room
of the Kennedy White House.
``The sale of the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will be among the most
memorable auctions ever to take place,'' said Sotheby's president Diana Brooks.
``The objects we are selling reveal a portrait of one of the most extraordinary
women of the 20th century.''
The Kennedys' children, Caroline and John, gave thousands of items to the John
F Kennedy Library Foundation earlier this year, but the former First Lady
directed that the parts of her estate not wanted by her children should be
sold.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry into Brixton speakers</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974880795</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN inquiry is to be held into whether speakers at a demonstration incited the
violence incited the latest Brixton riot.
The announcement was made as Home Secretary Michael Howard toured the south
London community yesterday after a night of violence was sparked by the death
of a black man held in police custody.
Mr Howard also applauded police handling of the riot. He said: ``I want to pay
tribute to the courage and professionalism of the police for the way in which
they brought last night's disturbances under control.''
Mr Howard added: ``There can be no excuse whatever for the lawlessness which
took place in Brixton last night.''
Earlier, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon said that the inquiry
into the disturbances would examine whether speeches made earlier in the
evening were inflammatory, as well as looking at other offences.
Sir Paul told a news conference at Scotland Yard that the disturbances, sparked
by the death in police custody last week of 26-year-old Wayne Douglas, were a
``setback'' for the people of Brixton, though not on the scale of riots of 1981
or 1985.
``It wasn't Brixton that rioted last night, it was a small minority of thugs
and criminals who as ever look for an opportunity to embark on criminal
exercises,'' he said.
``We have established a criminal inquiry, not just into the criminal offences
on the streets, but into the inflammatory nature of the speeches made outside
the police station and we will be exploring whether criminal offences of
incitement and other offences were committed.''
Sir Paul did not refer to any of the people who addressed the crowd by name.
But one of the most outspoken of those who addressed demonstrators, Rudy
Narayan, of protest group Civil Rights UK, said he
Continued from Page 1
stood by his remarks.
Mr Narayan insisted that his speech was ``no more inflammatory than killing a
man in police custody''.
He was quoted as telling at the protest meeting ``The Brixton police are
killers'' and adding: ``And they will not understand what they have done until
one of them has been killed.''
Sir Paul said around 100 people had gathered outside Brixton police station at
about 7pm to protest about Mr Douglas's death.
``Sadly, inflammatory speeches were made at the scene, irresponsible speeches
were made at the scene, outside the police station, then without police
agreement, the crowd was unleashed on a march, a wander about into Brixton,''
he said.
He added: ``They broke through a police cordon, and within a very few minutes
after that, missiles were thrown, and quite severe violence was offered to
police.
``From that point onwards, sporadic violence and looting took place, and we
strongly believe that shots were fired, perhaps as many as three, not
necessarily at or in the direction of police, but we believe shots were fired.''
He said three police officers were injured. One had a broken collar-bone and
other injuries, another had an eye injury, and a third had injuries to his
head. At least eight or nine civilians were injured, some in the course of the
looting. Some 22 people were arrested for a variety of offences.
About 50 business premises were damaged, three public houses were attacked, and
several vehicles either turned over, set on fire, or damaged.
Sir Paul said that Wayne Douglas's death was sad but it had to be remembered
that at the time of his arrest he was wanted for criminal offences, that it was
alleged that just before his arrest he had carried out a robbery at knifepoint,
and that when he was later confronted by police, he brandished a knife at
officers.
Mr Douglas was disarmed by ``courageous officers,'' Sir Paul said.
Asked about the wisdom of using American-style long-handled batons, Sir Paul
said there was no evidence to suggest ``that this man's death is anything other
than a tragedy involving a weakness to his heart''.
Mr Douglas, 33, was restrained by officers equipped with long batons for
possession of a knife, CS gas, and cannabis. He suffered a fractured skull and
died in hospital five days later.

THE ink was barely dry on the peace treaty yesterday when sporadic violence
flared again in Bosnia, highlighting the task ahead for Nato troops.
There were explosions in districts of Sarajevo, government troops firing on a
French UN helicopter, and Croat forces clashing with pro-government Islamic
fighters.
In Paris, meanwhile, leaders from former Yugoslavia signed the Bosnian treaty,
formally ending Europe's worst conflict since the Second World War and opening
the way for thousands of Nato troops to move into the shattered country.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, and
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic signed the accord before the leaders of
major powers including US President Bill Clinton and Mr Major.
All of them pledged their support for the tough task of making the agreement a
reality, urging the warring parties to put their enmity behind them after more
than three years of war and promising military, financial, and moral support.
``I feel like a man who is drinking a bitter but useful medicine,'' said Mr
Izetbegovic.
Mr Milosevic urged Serbs in Sarajevo not to fear for their future under the
Muslim-led government and to trust the world and Yugoslavia to protect their
rights. ``I wish to use this opportunity to address especially the citizens of
Sarajevo. There is no room for fear or worry,'' he said after the signing. ``It
is clear that the war is over.'' His words were echoed by Bosnian Serb
``vice-president'' Nikola Koljevic who said he was given assurances in Paris
that those Sarajevo Serbs who wanted to stay on under Bosnian government
authority would be protected.
Some diplomats have speculated Mr Koljevic would replace Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic, an indicted war criminal who must step down from office under
the Dayton agreement.
``Seize this chance and make it work,'' Mr Clinton said. ``You can do nothing
to erase the past but you can do everything to build the future. Do not let
your children down.''
Between two and three million people have been displaced by the war and some
200,000 have been killed. No-one was killed yesterday, but violence flared
again.
A UN official reported that Bosnian government troops had fired on a French
army helicopter. Four bullets hit it.
Moments after the treaty was signed, explosions rocked two frontline areas in
snow-bound Sarajevo, where the Bosnian Serbs have been protesting in vain
against the terms of the peace deal. There were no reports of casualties.
Two rocket-propelled grenades landed near a Jewish cemetery in the city centre
where Serb and government trenches are close together.
Four more fell near a bridge marking the division between the Serb-held suburb
of Grbavica and government-held parts of the city, and a suspected mortar bomb
slammed into the roof of a house in a southern district.
Officials of the Muslim-led government said Bosnian Serb forces fired the
grenades.
Bosnian government officials also reported that Bosnian Croat militia and
Islamic mujahideen forces clashed in central Bosnia.
In a statement issued through the French Foreign Ministry, the leaders of all
the factions involved urged their forces on the ground to ``have faith in the
future''.
In recalling the horrors of the past, such as children whose playgrounds were
shelled, young girls raped, victims piled in mass graves, ethnic cleansing,
floods of refugees and starvation, Mr Clinton and others said those accused of
war crimes must be brought to justice.
Negotiated last month in Dayton, Ohio, the agreement divides Bosnia almost
equally between Serbs and a Muslim-Croat alliance but guarantees its
international borders and fragile statehood.
French President Jacques Chirac, who hosted the signing in his Elysee palace,
said it was time to ``turn the page of war''.
The three presidents from the former Yugoslavia stiffly exchanged handshakes
with one another and with the other leaders as they stood up, unsmiling, from
signing the treaty.
Mr Clinton, Mr Major, Mr Chirac, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin then signed as co-sponsors.
Mr Izetbegovic pointedly failed to applaud the speeches of his fellow leaders.
PATRICK BROGAN writes from Washington: Congress gave its half-hearted support
to Mr Clinton's Bosnia policy last night. The Senate voted to support him, with
qualifications, and the House voted not to oppose him.
The White House noted that this was the best it could get, and accepted that
very tepid measure of assent. The Senate had earlier rejected a proposal to cut
off funding, and then voted 69 to 30 to acquiesce in sending troops, under
certain conditions.
The Senate resolution provides that troops may be deployed for ``approximately
one year'' and that there should be an international effort, led by the US, to
arm, train and equip the Bosnian army. Mr Clinton has accepted these terms.

CONSUMERS should find it easier to take their telephone numbers with them when
they switch from British Telecom to rival cable firms in the wake of new rules
proposed yesterday.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission settled a dispute between BT and industry
regulator the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) by setting out a framework
for how the costs of switching the numbers should be split between the
different companies.
The MMC decided BT should bear 70% of the costs - which average out at around
#12 a time - and the new company 30%.
Both Oftel and BT were pleased by the decision.
``This is a good day for customers,'' said Oftel head Don Cruickshank. ``I am
pleased to announce that the MMC has endorsed my view that number portability
is in the public interest and that BT should not be able to recover from other
operators all its costs in bringing about portability.''
However, BT said it had been unhappy not about who paid what but because Oftel
wanted ``unfettered powers'' to decide.
``We feel it's a very fair result,'' said a spokeswoman. ``There are now firm
rules about how the costs will be apportioned...... MMC have ruled that there
will be firm rules and (Oftel) cannot just take such action as it thinks fit.''
Studies have shown that rival cable firms can offer substantial savings in
bills and Oftel argued that BT's stance was making it harder for consumers to
enjoy the benefits of competition.

CONSUMERS last night were still refusing to accept the Government's latest
attempt to reassure the public that British beef is safe to eat.
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg and various Government experts spent almost
two hours with journalists yesterday trying to demonstrate that the latest
scare over BSE, the so-called mad cow disease which has seen wholesale beef
sales reported to have plummeted by as much 25%, was unfounded.
He also insisted that the Government had not lost the confidence of the public
- even though many education authorities have taken beef products off school
menus.
Meanwhile, Scottish farmers are fighting back and have called for the National
Farmers Union to use high-profile personalities to promote beef.
Members of Dumfries and Stewartry Area of the NFU have urged the union to
commission figures such as former Scotland rugby captain Gavin Hastings to
advertise beef and, they hope, convince the public that eating it is not
dangerous.
Within hours of Mr Hogg's meeting, 200 more schools had banned beef and the
Consumers' Association said the Government had done nothing to reassure the
public.
Chief Medical Officer Kenneth Calman, Chief Veterinary Officer Keith Meldrum,
Food Minister Angela Browning, and Professor John Pattison, head of the
committee which monitors BSE for the Government, were among those called up by
Mr Hogg to give their backing to beef.
They emphasised again that there was no evidence to suggest BSE could be
transmitted to humans and said safety nets had been imposed because the parts
of cattle which might pose even the slightest theoretical risk had been banned
from the food chain.
However, their message did not convince councillors in Dorset, who decided to
take beef off menus in 200 schools.
Ms Diane McCrea, head of food and health at the Consumers' Association, said:
``This does nothing to reassure consumers who are confused about the potential
risks of BSE and worried about what they are eating,'' she said.

ROUTINE health checks aimed at galvanising people into healthy habits are
probably a waste of money, pioneers of health promotion in Glasgow are
admitting today.
A huge investigation into the effects of workplace health education and
cholesterol testing has shown small changes which would be massively outweighed
by the cost.
Now Dr Phil Hanlon, who led the investigation for Glasgow University's
department of public health, is warning that GPs face a barrage of conflicting
pressures over the next few months.
On the one side is the latest confirmation that cholesterol levels do little to
influence people's behaviour.
On the other side will be the drug companies who make the statin family of
cholesterol-reducing drugs, riding on the back of the West of Scotland Coronary
Prevention Study which demonstrated last month that one such product,
simvastatin, reduced the risk of heart attacks by a third in middle-aged men
with moderately excessive cholesterol levels.

A GRAMPIAN Police officer was cleared of charges of corruption and attempting
to defeat the ends of justice, at the High Court in Aberdeen yesterday.
The jury of nine women and five men took two hours and 10 minutes to decide
that Constable Neil Cooper, 36, should go free.
He had denied throughout his 17-day trial that he failed to fulfil his duty as
a police officer by not investigating a crime committed by drug dealer Ronald
Cormack.
Cormack is currently serving a 15-year sentence imposed earlier this year for
drug and firearms offences.
It was alleged Mr Cooper, of Springdale Crescent, Aberdeen, had told him he was
to be investigated and to get rid of any firearms he had and, prior to
interviewing him, told him the questions he would be asked and advised him of
the answers he should give.
The jury unanimously found the charge not proven.
He was also charged with failing in his duty, with intent to defeat the ends of
justice, by not reporting or investigating the involvement of Cormack in a
housebreaking in which he told him he had taken part.
The jury found Mr Cooper not guilty of that charge by a majority and returned
the same verdict on the third charge, that he corruptly accepted #6000 and a
number of subsequent payments for providing Cormack with details of police
intelligence about his drug-dealing operations.
Mr Cooper, who along with three other officers still faces possible dismissal
from Grampian Police under disciplinary proceedings, showed no emotion as the
jury foreman read out the verdicts.
However, as she read out ``not guilty'' to the third charge, his 34-year-old
wife Catriona burst into tears and other friends and family members applauded
and cheered.
After being told by Lord Macfadyen he was free to go, Mr Cooper left the dock
turning to say ``Thank you'' to the jury as he went.
Afterwards, with his wife by his side as he left court, he said: ``I basically
just wish to thank my wife, my family, my friends, some close colleagues from
Grampian Police who have stuck by me through all this, and especially my legal
team for their efforts throughout my case.
``I at no time doubted that I would be cleared of these charges and I am
relieved the jury saw the case in exactly the same manner as I saw it and that
this ordeal is finally all over after a long, long year.''
The couple have a two-year-old son Stuart, and his wife said she was simply
``relieved''. Mr Cooper said the length of time the case had been hanging over
him had imposed a tremendous strain.
Other than ``to go for a pint'', he had no plans for the future and did not
know if he would be able to resume his police career.
``I have absolutely no idea,'' he said. ``It is not in my hands at the moment.
All I have focused on up to this point in time is seeing this trial through. I
have not looked beyond today to be honest.''
Mr Cooper was arrested in January after a three-week investigation by officers
from Strathclyde Police, who were called in by Grampian's chief constable
following Cormack's arrest.
Mr Cooper and two other officers, Sergeant Hamish Moir, 36, and Constable James
Grimmer, 35, subsequently appeared in court.
At that stage, Mr Cooper and Mr Moir were alleged to have attempted to pervert
the course of justice by inciting someone to fabricate evidence.
Mr Cooper was also charged with supplying cannabis resin and attempting to
defeat the ends of justice.
Mr Grimmer appeared on a separate petition charged with reset and possessing
cannabis.
All three, along with Constable Colin Clark, who faced no charges, were
suspended on full pay, and remain so.
Yesterday, a spokesman for the Crown Office said: ``Crown counsel are giving
further consideration to the cases against the other officers.'' No decision on
internal police disciplinary proceedings will be made until all the outstanding
criminal proceedings have been completed.
Following yesterday's verdict, Grampian's deputy chief constable David Garbutt
said: ``I am more than satisfied that the actions of my senior officers in
beginning this investigation have been fully justified.
``During the past year, all staff in the organisation have had to live and work
with the unsettling effects of such an investigation and the possibility that
criminal proceedings could be taken against some of their colleagues.
``This has, understandably, affected staff morale in many areas but it is a
tribute to those staff that their efforts to provide a first-class policing
service have continued unabated and that the same period has seen many new
initiatives and innovative projects introduced in the force.
``The four officers who were subject to the initial investigation last January
remain suspended from duty pending a decision on any internal disciplinary
proceedings which may follow.
``This decision will not be made until all the outstanding criminal matters are
formally completed.''
The discipline authority for Grampian Police is the deputy chief constable and
the decision whether or not to instigate disciplinary proceedings rests with
him.

CHRISTMAS crackers seem to be a peculiarly British institution. To some of us,
they are as essential a part of the festivities as the tree and the presents.
Aficionados will have noticed a change over the years, from crackers which held
the flimsiest of hats and plastic novelties to the current trend towards more
substantial and sophisticated contents such as playing cards, tool kits, and
mulled wine mix.
We gathered together eight varieties of cracker on sale this Christmas at major
high street stores and presented them for testing to Dounja (who is from
Luxembourg and had never experienced crackers before), Bob, Graeme, Chris,
Kenny, and Mil at the Glasgow School of Art who, as product design students,
may well be the cracker creators of the future.
They gave marks out of ten for packaging, bang, joke, hat, and gift.
Woolworth's ``Gold Star'' family crackers
A dozen for #4.99, approximately 41p each, gold stars on red and green shiny
background.
A substantial looking, modern cracker, with mediocre bang and gifts: shoehorn,
card trick, plastic necklace (already broken). No jokes but dull general
knowledge questions, eg ``Who led the Labour Party before Harold Wilson?''.
Tissue hats on the thin side. Average cracker, but a bit disappointing.Score:
24 out of 50.
Woolworth's ``Poinsettia'' luxury crackers
Six for #7.99, approximately #1.33 each, gold and tartan with tartan bows.
Look nice and Christmassy, feel weighty. Rubbish bang, nice tartan hat, gifts
of shaving brush, tool kit (plastic holder already ripped), hand lotion, look
exciting but don't bear close inspection. Dreadful jokes. Reasonable
value.Score: 31 out of 50.
BHS luxury ``Starburst'' crackers
Twelve for #10, approximately 83p each, shiny gold on pink or purple.
Look and feel good, good bang, excellent designer hat, fair jokes, eg ``How do
you stop a herd of elephants from charging? Take away their credit cards''.
Good gifts, tape measure, candle, whistle, cards. Score: 35 out of 50.
House of Fraser luxury ``Mistletoe'' crackers
Twelve for #13, approximately #1.08 each, shiny mistletoe print with green
ribbons.
Traditional Christmas look, feels substantial. Good bang, more cards but in
plastic box, lovely pearl necklace, decorated tin with lid (doesn't work too
well). Traditional tissue-paper hat very boring. Good jokes. An OK cracker if a
bit dull.Score: 36 out of 50.
Boots ``Deluxe'' crackers
Six for #13, approximately #2.16 each, copper and gold foil with scroll print.
Presentation could be better. Poor bang. Excellent foil hats. Exciting gifts,
better than expected, travelling board game, velvet bag with earrings. Good to
see a drawing with the jokes. Score: 39 out of 50.
Boots ``Family'' crackers
Twelve for #10, approximately 83p each, green and red foil with pattern.
Good presentation, good bang, excellent foil hats, gifts not too exciting: more
playing cards, tool kit. Poor jokes, eg ``What's white, round, and giggles? A
tickled onion''. Score: 35 out of 50.
Marks &amp; Spencer ``Party'' crackers
Twelve for #13, approximately #1.08 each, including matching napkins and place
cards, holly pattern on white with green and gold ribbons.
Look and feel good. Matching napkins a good feature. Mediocre bang. Hat matches
cracker and napkin, equals ``holly overkill'', but nice all the same. The most
unusual gifts: keyring, false teeth paper-clip, picture frame. The best jokes
because they're visual, a bit like Gary Larson. Score: 40 out of 50.
Marks &amp; Spencer ``Children's'' crackers
Six for #10, approximately #1.66 each, snowmen and Santa characters with gold
bows and holly.
Look really nice, the best yet. Mediocre bang, old jokes - ``What waves a magic
wand and goes from Dover to Calais? A cross channel fairy'' - but children will
probably like them. Tartan hats too sophisticated for kids. Great gifts for all
the family: tiny water pistol (really works), pack of chewing gum trick, toy
car that whizzes backwards.
Score: 40 out of 50.

THE world will be unable to feed itself in the next century unless it curbs
relentless population growth and adopts new land management methods, it was
claimed yesterday.
Professor Jeff Maxwell, director of the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute in
Aberdeen, said that enough people to fill another Edinburgh are born every
three days and our capacity to provide food for them all will not be able to
keep pace.
``In fact we appear to be doing our best to reduce the long-term ability of our
planet to produce food rather than the other way round,'' he said.
Delivering a lecture at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh as part of a
series on bioscience in Scotland, he said that between six and seven million
hectares of land was lost each year because of unchecked soil erosion.
``Sadly, the list of past and present land use mistakes goes on and on,'' he
said.
Professor Maxwell said a more equitable redistribution of resources, even if
achievable, would not be enough to solve the problem in the twenty-first
century because the world's population was set to double over the next 50 or 60
years.
The gross imbalance would inevitably lead to political conflict unless
countries were able to control populations.

Madrid
MR Major arrived all guns blazing in Madrid last night for the most important
EU summit for years. He accused his EU partners of failing to understand the
full implications of forging ahead with a single currency before the majority
of member states become willing and able.
The Prime Minister, as usual in Europe these days, finds himself with few
friends on the issue.
He is known to be increasingly concerned that the pound could suffer not just
from exchange rate instability if it remains outside the planned single
currency but that there could also be a political price to pay if Britain chose
to exercise its right to opt out.
Mr Major delivered his ``look before you leap'' message on his arrival to take
part in the two-day summit which is due to hammer out final details of the
single currency programme - and give the currency a name at last.
If Chancellor Helmut Kohl has his way, Germany and hard-currency Benelux
countries will lock their exchange rates until 2002, when the new coinage will
be presented to the European public.
Mr Major fears increasingly that a small group of member states sharing one
currency might begin voting together in the EU against the interests of those
countries which choose to remain outside the new system meantime.
Britain's response to this threat is to get the ground rules laid out now, if
possible. ``If a small core of countries behaved in this way, it would be a
radical undermining of the way the European Union has always worked,'' a
British official argued.
Mr Major said: ``I think what we have to discuss in Madrid are the questions
which remain unanswered about the single currency. Many have been answered but
what has not been is what the implications will be if a small number of
countries goes ahead, and not, as was originally envisaged, a very large number
goes ahead.''
He denied his words were a tactic to put the brake on a policy to which the
Government still refuses to commit the country: ``It is not a question of
slowing down. It is a question of making sure that all the implications of
proceeding are understood. I do not believe they are.''
Mr Major went on: ``There are very many issues about the single currency which
have not been examined. If a small number of countries goes ahead, the
implications of that will not only be for those countries taking part. The
implications will apply to the rest of the EU. The ramifications are very wide
indeed. We need to examine all those ramifications.''
Tory Euro-sceptics will be pleased by the Prime Minister's stand at the summit
but nothing Mr Major says this weekend in Madrid will budge the majority from
their determination to meet the 1999 target for going ahead with the single
currency.
French President Jacques Chirac is bound to play down the long-term
implications for the currency of the deep economic crisis his country is facing
thanks to a public backlash against his government's belt-tightening measures.
The problems confronting the single currency will dominate the summit, although
there will be important talks too on next year's launch of an intergovernmental
conference to shape Europe's future.
n A deal which side-steps British objections to EU laws on parental leave for
fathers and mothers is due to be signed today in Brussels. The Government
blocked an accord between the 15 member states, triggering the use of
Maastricht provisions allowing employers and unions to negotiate social
protection measures themselves.
The deal provides a minimum of three months off work without pay to care for a
child at any period in the first eight years after birth or adoption.
The TUC predicts that pressure in the market-place will spread the benefit to
Britain.

A JUDGE was asked yesterday to order the Home Secretary to appear before a
court to answer a claim that he has committed contempt in an immigration case.
Mr Michael Howard was alleged to be in breach of an undertaking not to take
steps to remove anyone from the country until court proceeedings are concluded.
Lord Gill was told at the Court of Session that Mr Jaswinder Singh's removal
from the UK had been ordered by the Home Office and he had lost an appeal to an
adjudicator in October.
Last Friday, Mr Singh's petition for judicial review was dismissed at the Court
of Session, but, later that same day, he raised a new petition on different
grounds.
Mr Singh, of Merrygold Square, Ayr, was arrested the next day and detained at
Greenock Prison, but released on Monday this week when he was mistaken for
another Mr Jaswinder Singh who had been granted interim liberation.
Mr Andrew Hardie QC, Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, appearing for Mr Singh
explained the Home Secretary had given an undertaking that no steps would be
taken to remove from the country anyone who had a judicial review petition
before the courts until the court proceedings were completed.
Mr Hardie argued that detaining Mr Singh had been a step towards removing him
from the country. He added: ``It is, on the face of it, contempt of this court
and I would invite your lordship to ordain the Minister to appear or be
represented at this court.''
Miss Susan O'Brien, counsel for the Home Secretary, said that the nature of the
undertaking, which was regularly given in immigration cases, was that until a
judicial review had been resolved the immigration authorities would refrain
from removal or deportation.
She added, however: ``No undertaking is given to refrain from detaining a
person who may otherwise be lawfully detained.''
She explained that what had happened in this case was the authorities had been
given notice of Mr Singh's new petition, but were not aware it was the same
person who had another petition dismissed.
Miss O'Brien added: ``The first petition having been dismissed, it was assumed,
correctly in my submission, that the petitioner had reverted to the status of
illegal entrant and was liable to removal. He was detained the next day in
preparation for re-moval.'' At the Home Office in London 17 people were
employed on correspondence relating to people called Singh, and there were
about 2500 files in the immigration department in the name of Jaswinder Singh.
In the present case, after officials had established that it was the same Singh
involved in both petitions, they immediately stopped measures to have him
removed from the country.
Lord Gill will give a ruling later.

BELGRADE.
CITIZENS of Belgrade, struggling with a war-exhausted economy, welcomed the
peace signing with few apparent regrets that it ends their dream of a Greater
Serbia.
This capital of Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia means ``white city'', but the
mood
here is chiefly grey, reflecting a mixture of uncertainty and perhaps
opportunity. Trade, not war, is the new byword as the generals retreat to the
sidelines.
Nationalist slogans, evoking centuries of Serb pride, have been replaced by
catchy TV commercial jingles keyed to money-making themes: ``Marketing,
marketing!.
Belgrade has been tainted with Bosnian Serb atrocities and ethnic cleansing.
As the pan-Serb vision faded with the Paris ceremony, Belgrade's citizens
trudged through drab shopping avenues cloaked in Balkan mid-winter snow to buy
newspapers.
People, whose daily lives have been reduced to meagre levels from a
once-prosperous state, queued at kiosks to read headlines trumpeting neither
victory nor defeat, but hope.
``It is good that peace has finally been signed,'' one man said at a newstand.
``After four years of war, this is the only positive happening,'' another said.
A woman nearby strongly disagreed: ``The first mistake was that Yugoslavia
(originally) was formed of six republics, six governments with six nations. We
should have had one state with one government.''
``The biggest mistake,'' she added, ``is that Serbs are being thrown out of
Sarajevo. Serbs and Muslims will never live together.''
Foreign businessmen, bringing proposals for trade deals, are arriving daily on
flights that did not exist just a few months ago.
Serbia is contemplating a major privatisation drive to revamp a communist-era
state economy now moribund after the impact of three years of United Nations
sanctions.
In another time, perhaps, Greater Serbia will surface again as a political
goal, but for now the idea has passed.

<HEADLINE>Post Office criticised over policy on drinking at work</HEADLINE>

THE Post Office has been criticised for putting up with nightshift postal staff
drinking before coming to work and during breaks, then sacking them for
drunkenness.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow heard evidence of a culture of heavy drinking
among staff, particularly at the George Square head office.
Workers were allowed to go out drinking during their breaks as management tried
to stop drinking at the sorting office. One group of workers were caught
drinking in a locker room.
Eric Frew, sacked after having seven vodkas and a half pint of beer before and
during his shift at the sorting office, had gone to the tribunal. It ruled that
his sacking was unfair and awarded him #2428 compensation, but held him 60% to
blame.
Mr Frew, 36, of York Drive, Burnside, Glasgow, had three vodkas before his
night shift and another four along with the half pint during a 20-minute break
around midnight.
Around 6.30 next morning, a manager noticed his speech was slurred, his eyes
glazed, he was unsteady on his feet, and his sorting rate was slow.
He had a similar offence on his record which was due to expire four days later.
In its decision the tribunal said it found it strange in today's industrial
climate that the Post Office accepted workers arriving for work on the
nightshift having been drinking then allowed them to go out and drink again
during their break.
``To be so tolerant of drinking within working hours and yet to punish
drunkenness - even repeated drunkenness - so heavily was not the action of a
reasonable employer and made the whole dismissal unfair,'' the tribunal added.

AS the votes were counted in the ballot for the Labour Party's candidate in
Govan, one group of party workers knew they would be disappointed, whatever the
outcome.
To the supporters of Mrs Margaret Curran this was not a contest between left
and right, Old Labour and New, traditional trade unionism and the business face
of socialism. It was organised power bases versus community activism; a
completely new agenda versus politically acceptable reform. They knew they
hadn't a hope but they were damn well going to give it a shout.
They emerged, according to both opponents, with a lot of friends. How true
those friends will be remains to be tested.
Mrs Curran was the inspirational force behind the Scottish Labour Women's
Caucus, of which she is now convener. Active in Labour politics since her
student days, she had a break from political activity when her children, now
eight and six, were very young. She returned a few years ago with the different
perspective of the outsider to be deeply angered by the way the women were
``constantly mugged'' by the system.
For any constituency selection committee, her CV is promising. Lecturer in
community education after a solid grounding as community worker, a sterling
track record as party activist. Age 37 - oh, and mother of two primary
school-age children.
``It was tempting to leave them to it but it would have been misinterpreted. It
would have been assumed that we did not have a suitable candidate and, in the
end, it was inconceivable that we could allow these two men to go by
unchallenged,'' she said yesterday, before conceding that they knew they never
had the slightest chance of winning.
``To have contested on the basis of having an equal chance, I would have had to
have given up my job for two years and to have hardly seen my family.''
The bitterest disappointment for Mrs Curran was the number of women who said
they would not vote for her because they thought it would let the other man in.
``These were women I have shared a platform with in the campaign for 50/50
representation in a Scottish Parliament. Anyone who said they were voting for
Mike because he was the left-wing candidate could equally well have voted for
me.
``I am passionately interested in benefits, community care, and poverty, the
whole social agenda, but these are invisible issues - although to women they
are the vital ones. If we continue to legitimise men, we will reinforce the
problem that they set the agenda. The women's agenda is the world's agenda.''
For the first time in the selection process, the two main candidates produced
printed campaign leaflets, which the women's group - without even a full-time
organiser at Scottish level - had no possibility of matching. To the
disappointment of Mrs Curran and her supporters, the outside view was equally
traditional.
``The media have colluded with the male agenda that this is a political boxing
match of a couple of peacocks vying with each other,'' she said.
She added: ``People say I am a one-issue candidate but if I was only standing
on women's issues I would not be in the Labour Party. I have spoken strongly on
social policy and economic policy but I believe that if people don't take
account of the women's dimension they are only seeing half the problem.''
Real proof of her political skill, however, comes when she abandons the urgent
oratory, which is clearly second nature, for a tribute to the other contestants
as generous as it is pragmatic: ``Mike has an excellent record as a
constituency MP and Sarwar has done equally good work as a councillor and has a
vision well beyond the local.''
Whichever one was chosen, she added, she would be out canvassing for him at the
next election.
Nevertheless, there are some questions she and her supporters want answered
about qualifications for voting in selection contests and they would be
interested in the mechanisms which enabled far more than the usual number of
new members to join at the last moment.
They also have a message for party members in other constituencies: ``It is not
enough just to agree with us. More people have to put their money where their
mouth is. The Labour Party, for example, still has a lot of work to do about
how to deliver an equal number of men and women to a Scottish Parliament.
``All-women shortlists are not about feminism but about power and what women
would do with power. At a local level, women are likely to use their experience
of listening to institute a dialogue with the local community and the local
party and a feminist going into the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party would
have more effect than five male MPs.''

n GOLLY, he's still around! Despite a decade and more of political correctness,
the Robertson's golliwog is alive and well, to the chagrin of Scotland's ethnic
community.
What's even more narking right now is that the notorious symbol has reappeared
on jars of Christmas mincemeat - when we're all supposed to be celebrating
harmony and goodwill.
Even more perplexing is the fact golly is enjoying star billing with Save The
Children: the charity has allowed its name and symbol to appear on the
Robertson's label in a Christmas card promotion netting a 15p donation until
the end of this month. It also features an offer for 21 golly brooches.
``We couldn't afford to pass up the opportunity,'' a Save The Children
spokeswoman told Check-Out. ``But we're sorry to have offended anyone.''
They certainly have - including Edinburgh District councillor Philip Attridge,
who intends raising the matter with the city's race relations sub-committee.
``I'm amazed to discover this offensive doll has been resurrected. I thought it
had disappeared along with Black Sambo. I advise shoppers to buy another brand
of mincemeat.''
His outrage may be shared by Princess Anne. It can scarcely help the President
of Save the Children in her mission to Afro-Caribbean missions.
n PILLOW talk goes electronic with what's hailed as an ``incredible
breakthrough'' in personal audio.
If you're being kept awake by festive partygoers, the Sound Pillow could
certainly help you turn a deaf ear, with soothing music or a relaxation tape
gently wafting you to sleep.
A lead from the non-allergenic pillow connects via an attached jack to cassette
players, CD machines or a TV set, transmitting the sound through stereo
speakers inside the hollow fill pillow, without disturbing anyone else.
Sound Pillow costs #15.95 (including p&amp;p) from Pure-Tec, Isberg House, Kingston
Street, Hull HU1 2DB. Phone-order on 01482 860860 or see and hear it at Gadget
Shop, St Enoch Shopping Centre, Glasgow.
n BY Boxing Day it's a sad fact that thousands of powered toys, games, personal
stereos, and other Christmas goodies will be out for the count. Only the
atmosphere will be charged, with recrimination; the batteries will be exhausted
by hours of frenzied activity the previous day.
Battery Manager Ultra, which claims to be the first fully automatic recharger,
offers a solution. Developed by Innovations, who proved it was possible to
recharge ordinary batteries, the compact, stylish unit recognises a range of
different types and sizes of battery and adjusts the charging process
accordingly, handling up to four at a time. As well as huge long-term savings,
the charger is environmentally friendly, reducing problems of battery disposal.
Battery Manager Ultra is #29.95 at John Lewis, Edinburgh and Aberdeen; Tandy
and Powerstore, or phone 01793 433500 to order.
n YOU may get sympathy, but don't expect tea at the crematorium: according to
funeral plan operator Chosen Heritage, the results of its latest survey are
``far from comforting''. One in 10 crematoria surveyed had no shelter or
waiting facilities, while only one in seven provided a phone. Hot drinks?
``Wait until the wake,'' was the usual response.
While a crematorium at Sunderland gets Brownie points for laying on TV for
visitors, these grave deficiencies suggest most mourners would be well advised
to pack a shooting stick and black coffee when they pay their last respects.
n READERS receiving Christmas hamper catalogues through their letterboxes
recently may have blamed the postal strike for a delay - until they realised
they were being asked to place orders for Christmas 1996!

start paying a few pounds a week now for next year's hamper. Before signing up,

<HEADLINE>Life for man whose victim may still die Jealous chef attacked lover with hammer</HEADLINE>

A JEALOUS chef who inflicted catastrophic injuries on his lover in a brutal and
sustained hammer attack, was yesterday jailed for life for her attempted murder.
The 23-year-old victim's life is still in the balance and a surgeon has
described her injuries as the worst he has seen. Mrs Audrey Clark is paralysed
down the left side of her body and can say just two words - yes and no.
Temporary Judge Alexander Wilkinson told William Munson: ``This is a horrific
case and the attack was a murderous one of a most atrocious kind.
``I can find no way in which this case can be usefully distinguished from a
case of completed murder. You will go to prison for life.''
Munson, 33, admitted repeatedly striking Mrs Clark on the head with a hammer to
her severe injury, permanent disfigurement, permanent impairment, and the
danger of her life, and attempting to murder her.
The attack took place at their home in Linksview House, Edinburgh, on September
1 this year.
Mr Craig Scott, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh that Munson
and his victim had lived together as common law husband and wife for five years
but their relationship was a turbulent one.
There were numerous separations and, in February this year, the couple again
split up. The following month, Mrs Clark married another man.
In July, she and Munson began living together again but, by September, the
relationship had deteriorated to the extent that Mrs Clark was seeing her
husband.
On the afternoon of September 1, Munson met a friend in the street and said:
``I have done her in.'' Police forced their way into the house to find the
victim lying in a pool of blood.
Munson told police: ``I think I have murdered my girlfriend. I was smoking hash
and she started popping tablets and we started arguing. That's when I went into
the cupboard and got the hammer.''
The Advocate-depute explained that when Mrs Clark was admitted to hospital it
was obvious that she had suffered severe brain and skull injuries.
There were 18 to 20 lacerations to the skull, and during surgery at least 36
fragments of bone were found. The skull had been shattered in several places
and driven into the brain.
Mr Scott added: ``It is the consultant's view that if she survives she will
have major disabilities. He has been a neuro-surgeon for 15 years and it is the
worst kind of injury he has seen.''
Because of the severity of the attack, doctors had been unable to close the
victim's wounds properly and she would need further major plastic surgery to
reconstruct her skull.
``The surgeon indicates that her life is still in serious danger,'' Mr Scott
added. ``As he puts it, she could die any day.''
Mr Steven MacGibbon, defence counsel, described the case as exceptionally
horrific and tragic.
He said Munson was emotionally immature but added: ``He accepts and
understands, only too well, that the injuries he inflicted were appalling and
the consequences catastrophic.''
From the moment Munson met Mrs Clark he was besotted by her and was jealous of
the man she married.
``He loves Audrey and will do until the day he dies,'' added Mr MacGibbon.
During the weeks before the hammer attack, there were constant arguments and
Munson feared Mrs Clark was about to leave him again for the man she had
married in March.
``Her attitude was to taunt him and compare him unfavourably with the other
man.''
On the day of the assault, both had been smoking cannabis and she told Munson
that he would not be spending Christmas with her and their three-year-old son.
``That was the catalyst for the volcano, which had been bubbling for some time,
to erupt.''

<HEADLINE>Bitter fall-out looms for Labour over Watson-Sarwar contest for the redrawn Govan constituency Knife edge to a dead heat</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>1</EDITION>

THE big clue was the look on the face of Govan MP Michael Watson - glazed,
haggard and unsettled. And he was the winner.
For the rest, there was the wailing of Asian women on the stairs, the bristling
anger of some in the immigrant community who saw their democratic ambitions
thwarted, and the sight of the Scottish Labour Party once again fashioning a
rod to beat its own back.
An amazing dead heat in the final 245-all vote, and the banning of 52 voters
considered questionable by Glasgow party official Lesley Quinn, made an appeal
to the party's national executive committee inevitable last night.
But that appeal to Walworth Road in London by candidate Mohammed Sarwar meant
that the party would lock itself into a spiral of bad publicity. Party leader
Tony Blair will be asking why yet again his Scottish redoubt is producing the
wrong kind of headlines.
Councillor Sarwar, the millionaire owner of a cash and carry business, has been
steadily building his political profile in the West of Scotland to the point
where he had become an ideal Labour candidate for Westminster elections.
The problem was that, for reasons to do with the geography of his own support
and the availability of a seat, he was forced to focus on the new Govan
constituency, which was being sought by Mr Watson, whose Glasgow Central
constituency was being scrapped.
In stepped Pollok MP Jimmy Dunnachie to put his hat in the ring, thereby
forcing a full electoral contest betweeen himself, Mr Watson and any other
challenger. He later dropped out of the contest, but by then Councillor Sarwar
was a contender and Mr Watson had a fight on his hands.
It was a dirty campaign, by any standards, particularly those supposedly
espoused by New Labour. While mysteriously unsourced stories appeared in the
press alleging problems with Mr Sarwar's business empire, the Asian councillor
himself succeeded in commanding column inches boosting his profile.
There were two strands to the political contest assiduously fed out to the
media. One version had Councillor Sarwar as a hero among Scottish immigrants, a
self-made millionaire with a social conscience who argued for the minimum wage.
On the other hand, Michael Watson was portrayed as a bright and decent Labour
MP, the very last of the type who should be pushed aside - even to make way for
a candidate with credentials as impressive as those of Councilllor Sarwar.
By the time of yesterday's count journalists and broadcasters were in a feeding
frenzy at the City Halls in Glasgow, where it was almost impossible to get
anywhere near the stairway from which the result of the ballot was to be
announced.
In a strained atmosphere more akin to a parliamentary election result than a
simple candidate selection, there was a gasp when the figures were read out by
the Labour Party's West of Scotland organiser, Lesley Quinn. She, it was, who
had been invested with the power to scrutinise the signatures on postal voting
applications and cross-check them against membership forms.
It was her ruling that 52 of these voting forms were suspect that led to the
final knife-edge figures yesterday. That mulling-over period took several
hours, while the media presence grew and Mr Watson himself left because, he
said, he couldn't stand the tension.
Afterwards he looked queasy, not on account of anything he had done wrong, but
because of the knowledge that there will inevitably be a bitter fall-out from
such a keenly contested campaign, whatever happens to any appeal.
That process is unlikely to overturn a carefully-taken decision and, while the
Labour leadership will be unhappy about the headlines, it would be a surprise
if they intervened in the saga.
As one supporter of Mr Watson said last night: ``All it takes is one vote.''

THE Scottish public was given one of its most dramatic anti-drink driving
messages yesterday: ``A two-litre car into a bus queue has just as much effect
as a Kalashnikov.''
Chief Superintendent Sandy Forrest, head of Strathclyde Police traffic
department, said the drinking driver might as well gun the bus queue down with
a shotgun or firearm from the car window.
He called for an end to the stigma on reporting drinking friends and colleagues
and reinforced the police theme of calling a cab or taking the bus. ``We are
asking people to be more responsible, to make other arrangements to get home.
It may be inconvenient to use public transport but it is a lot less
inconvenient than losing your licence for two years or ending up in jail.''
The campaign by the eight Scottish forces was hailed yesterday, at its halfway
stage, as a big success. The secretary of the ACPO(S) traffic committee,
Assistant Chief Constable Ian Mackinnon said the fear of being caught was more
evident in this campaign than any of the previous nine.
He revealed that offender profiles had been compiled and were being used to
target particular groups in particular locations at particular times. The most
persistent drink driver is a man, aged between 25 and 29, unemployed and
driving in a built-up area between midnight and 3am on Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday nights.
Mr Mackinnon emphasised that the trend this year was encouraging, with positive
tests down by 0.8% throughout Scotland on the same period last year. One in 69
motorists tested this year was positive compared with one in 43 last year and
one in five 10 years ago when the chief constables began their crusade.
However, drivers in their 20s and 30s are not heeding the message, still
accounting for two thirds of the positive tests. Of the 98 people tested
positive after road accidents, 69% of them were aged between 20 and 30.
The high proportion of repeat offenders are also giving concern, Mr Mackinnon
said.
Of those tested positive, 71 had one or more convictions for drink driving
while nine had more than five convictions for the same offence. In the
campaign's first 20 days, while the percentage of positive tests decreased, the
number of people stopped by the police soared by 58% to 38,137.
The middle aged and elderly still show the lowest number of offenders. The
police warned drivers once again to beware the morning-after effect,
particularly transport workers, delivery drivers, and commuters who might have
visited the pub after work the previous night.
The results of drink driving were revealed dramatically by a 59-year-old woman
whose husband was killed.
Mrs Mary Chisholm's husband, Alex, 63, died after his car was hit in a crash on
the A77 near Glasgow in July. The driver of the other car tested positive for
alcohol and was jailed for five years and given a life ban at the High Court in
Kilmarnock.
The court heard that, at the time of the crash, the driver was already serving
two separate driving bans and had a string of previous convictions for driving
offences both in Scotland and England.
Mrs Chisholm, of Symington, Ayrshire, said: ``I want to forget Christmas this
year. The tree is still up in the loft and, as far as I am concerned, it might
as well stay there.
``I was horrified when I heard Alex was dead. He was a wonderful man who was
loved by his family.
``It's hard to accept he has gone. Thirty-five years is a long time together
and to have him taken away from me in such a senseless way is devastating.
``It has been a terrible blow for the grandchildren especially.''
They still talk about him all the time, they really miss their papa, especially
the two-year-old, Kevin.''
Mrs Chisholm said staff and pupils at Kirkstyle primary school, Kilmarnock,
where Mr Chisholm worked as a janitor, were also stunned by his death.
``They had been planning a retirement fund for Alex when he was due to retire
in two years' time. Instead, they made a collection and used the money to erect
a plaque to his memory in the main school hall to show their respect.''
The Chisholms had two sons and two daughters and 10 grandchildren.
The couple's son-in-law, Mr Andrew McClurg, 38, from Hurlford, Ayrshire, was a
passenger in Mr Chisholm's car and suffered long-term chest injuries when it
crashed.

<TEXT>
LORD Scarman, the octogenarian law lord who headed the inquiry into the 1981
Brixton riots, said yesterday he was ``broken-hearted'' about the most recent
outbreak of violence and that he would be making it his business to find out
the cause.
His report effectively marked a watershed in policing policy, creating a new
ethos of community police work.
What troubles some civil liberties campaigners now, however, is a feeling that
while some of Scarman's principles have been adopted and recognised as good
police practice, those implementing them are doing so in an increasingly
hostile climate, with the Government pushing what are perceived to be more
racist policies such as the asylum Bill and new stop and search laws.
Lord Scarman found that the riots over April 10 to 12 in 1981 had been sparked
by an incident involving an injured young black youth and two police officers,
which some members of the community felt was harassment, and attracted a crowd
of black youths.
In the three days of rioting, 279 policemen and 45 members of the public were
injured, 28 buildings were burned and there was widespread looting.
Lord Scarman found that the police should carry some responsibility for the
outbreak of disorder. They were, he said, partly to blame for the breakdown in
community relations, and there were instances of harassment and racial
prejudice among junior officers on Brixton streets.
Although some people who had given evidence to his inquiry had criticised
Operation Swamp 81, an intense stop and search operation designed to counteract
the ``appalling crime wave in Brixton'', Lord Scarman found that police had
been ``wise'' to continue it during days one and two of the riot.
The main recommendations of his report were: statutory consultative committees
to make the police more accountable; a better co-ordinated attack on inner-city
problems; greater independent oversight of police complaints procedure; longer
and improved police recruit training on dealing with public and preventing and
handling disorder; racially prejudiced behaviour by police to be a dismissal
offence; no reform of the Riot Act.
Other recommendations included an urgent study into ways of improving ethnic
minority recruitment into the police, a greater role for the Commission for
Racial Equality, and scrutiny of the legislation that replaced the formed
``Sus'' law (stop and search powers).
Four years later, Brixton was yet again a scene of violence, this time sparked
by an armed raid which led to the shooting of a black woman, Mrs Cherry Groce.
Part of a new police strategy, the armed raids were aimed at identifying
criminals without engaging in the mass stop-and-search exercises like Swamp
'81, but could at times be violent.
The then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd dismissed the rioting as mindless violence
by unruly criminal elements, but local clergymen blamed poor living conditions
and worsening unemployment.
Wednesday night's riots were apparently sparked by the death in police custody
of a 26-year-old black Brixton man Wayne Douglas.
Conor Foley, policy officer with the civil rights pressure group Liberty, said
yesterday that the rising number of black people who have died in custody,
coupled with allegations of mistreatment of suspected illegal immigrants, and
the virtual reintroduction of stop and search laws under the 1994 Criminal
Justice Public Order Act had heightened tensions.
A resident of Brixton, he sees the problem as lying partly in the growing
numbers of British-born blacks growing up in an increasingly racist climate.
Looking back at Lord Scarman's main recommendations, he says that statutory
consultative committees have not been set up to make the police more
accountable.
Training is better, and senior police officers are making the right noises
about racially prejudiced behaviour by police. But, the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Paul Condon's remarks about statistics showing that black youths
carry out the highest proportion of muggings damaged community relations
earlier this year and the wounds have not yet healed.
Of this Wednesday's riot, he said: ``It was very clearly politically motivated
- not a gaggle of people going out to rob and steal. It was a demonstration
caused because another person had died in police custody.''

A SCHOOLGIRL died in hospital yesterday from meningitis, three days before her
16th birthday.
Leanne Lester, a pupil at Banbury School, Oxfordshire, became ill on Monday
night at her home in Marlow Close, Banbury, and died in the town's Horton
General Hospital.
A 14-year-old boy from the same school is recovering in hospital from a less
serious form of the disease and two other pupils are reported to be suffering
similar symptoms.
Leanne's father last night claimed his daughter might have survived if her
school had acted earlier.
Mr Frank Lester, 36, believes all parents at the 1500-pupil Banbury School
should have been told of the meningitis scare on Monday as soon as the
14-year-old boy was admitted to hospital.
He said: ``I don't think sending a letter out to parents 48 hours later is
acting as quickly as possible.''
Mr Lester, who is divorced from Leanne's mother Marie, flew to Banbury from
Glasgow on Wednesday morning to be with his daughter.

WHATEVER your preference - roses and poinsettia leaves made from marzipan,
smooth royal icing, or glace fruits topping the richest of fruit mixes - the
commercial bakeries will let you have your cake and eat it.
It's worth reading the contents carefully if you have an anti-cherry contingent
or, more seriously, anyone with an allergy to nuts. Otherwise, by and large,
you get what you pay for in terms of ingredients, size, and decoration.
Skilled decorators can display their own craftsmanship on a variety of bases,
including or excluding alcohol and cherries for example. Those less deft with
the icing bag, but unable to countenance the circumference of uniform piping
around a central cluster of gold foil holly, should check their local baker for
the growing army of home bakers producing professional limited editions.
Few are as eye-catching as the picture-book scenes created by the imaginative
Shirley Lamb, who has just relinquished chairmanship of the British Sugarcraft
Guild. This year she has created cakes in the shape of a chimney, with Santa's
upturned boots waving wildly from the top, and in the form of a Christmas pud
topped with two rascally mice, one still nibbling, one replete.
Prices range from #5.99 for a four-inch chimney to #35 for a large commission.
Supermarket prices range from #1.69 for a 454gm iced fruit bar (Iceland/
Littlewoods) to #10.99 for a 1.36kg soft-iced, decorated square (Tesco).
n Shirley Lamb's cakes are available from Drymen Country Store or to order from
01786 870231.
IF the simple mince pie is more your idea of ideal festive fare, you might like
to take note of the judgments passed on seven varieties by our panel of
tasters. Six members of the cast from the Babes In The Wood panto at the King's
Theatre in Glasgow (running from December 14 to February 3) generously agreed
to give up their lunch hour to undertake the tasting. Oh yes they did!
We started off with Vivienne Carlyle (Maid Marion), Jim Byars (Friar Tuck),
Charles Kerney (the Sheriff of Nottingham - hiss, boo!), and Gordon Kane
(Cedric, the Sheriff's henchman). But Robin Hood (David Greer) and Little John
(Grant Stott) were feeling hungry too. Here's how the pies fared:
n Safeway (budget)
The cheapest in town at six for 57p, approximately 10p each. ``Look at that!
They're so thin there's hardly anything in them! Very unattractive, dry, and
lacking in mince. Hardly worth biting into.''
n Mr Kipling
Cost 89p for six, approximately 15p each. ``Oooh, that's good! Looks nice,
weighs quite a bit. Traditional flavour. Tasty pastry. He does make exceedingly
good pies.''
nCo-op, deep-filled
Cost 79p for six, approximately 13p each and recently voted tops by Egon Ronay.
``Cardboardy, tasteless, a bit stodgy. Looked tempting but didn't fulfil their
promise . . . Just like men,'' according to Maid Marion.
n Organic
from Grass Roots in Woodlands Road, Glasgow. Cost #1.89p for four,
approximately 47p each. ``Very crumbly, colour bad, not like a real mince pie
but an interesting flavour. Might be nice with custard.''
n Marks &amp; Spencer
Deep filled, 99p for six, approximately 16p each. ``The ones with wee nostrils!
Not too sweet, not too stodgy. Heavy on the fruit, light on the pastry, just
the way I like them. An impudent little pie which lived up to its
presumptions.''
n Peckhams luxury, with rum
Cost #1.79p for six, approximately 30p each. ``Looks good outside, strange
appearance inside, like caviar or something. Too sweet, don't like it.''
n Homemade (Herald reporter)
``Flying saucers coming up! Do you want us to be nice or brutally honest? A wee
bit too much pastry, but the intentions were good. The best mince pies I've
tasted made by a reporter. Ah, the coffee, and not a moment too soon.''

FIREFIGHTERS yesterday rescued a young girl's dog from a collapsed mine shaft
in a five-hour operation.
Kelly Archibald, eight, was broken-hearted after her father told her their Jack
Russell, Sammy, was trapped in a disused mine.
The family feared the dog would die but firefighters and mine rescue staff
climbed into the mine shaft and dug the dog free with their hands.
The dog had become trapped after chasing a rabbit. Kelly's father, Mr Alan
Archibald, 39, had taken him and the family's two other dogs for an afternoon
walk near their home by Cousland, Midlothian.
Mr Archibald said: ``The dogs are always chasing rabbits, so I just left them
to it, expecting them to follow me home.
``But by early evening I knew something was wrong when Sammy hadn't appeared at
the door.''
Mr Archibald went back into the wood and heard Sammy whimpering underground.
He tried to dig away the loose soil from the mine entrance but it was too dark
to see what he was doing.
The following morning, he took a shovel out to the mine and hoped he could dig
away the collapsed soil. He feared the rest of the mine would collapse on him
so called in the fire brigade.
Six firefighters arrived and, with the help of two mine rescue staff, climbed
into the tunnel and dug their way towards the dog.
Last night, Mr Archibald said: ``Everyone involved in helping rescue Sammy was
absolutely great.
``They had a very cold, very dangerous job, but nothing seemed too much for
them.''
His wife, Joyce, 42, added: ``Kelly had been sobbing her heart out when her dog
didn't come home.
``But the rescuers have really made her Christmas wish come true.''

A DECISIVE vote by miners at the troubled Monktonhall colliery in Midlothian to
accept a buy-out to save their pit is expected to be announced today.
The result of voting on an offer by Waverley Mining Finance is to be given in
Edinburgh and is expected to show that a majority of the miners favour it.
Figures for the voting were being withheld last night until an announcement
could be made on the London Stock Exchange this morning.
Acceptance of Waverley's offer means that the 158 miners will have relinquished
their 51% control of the pit and allowed Waverley to extend its shareholding
from 49% to 100%.
The result has to be put to the annual meeting of the miners at Dalkeith
tomorrow and it is expected to be given formal approval.
Waverley has offered ordinary company shares in exchange for the miners' 51%
holding.
The finance company said that if the share offer was approved, #15m would be
invested, allowing reinvestment in machinery and the opening of a new coal face
which would double production, provide 80 more jobs, and extend the pit's life
for at least 16 years.
The miners had been given three weeks to decide on the offer. Acceptance means
they cannot cash in the shares for three years.
Monktonhall was closed by British Coal in 1987 but a miners' consortium
succeeded in reopening it, only for further difficulties to arise due to a lack
of capital.
Waverley rescued Monktonhall two years ago with a package that gave it 49% of
the shares and left the miners with 51%.

A NEW drugs combination used to treat Parkinson's Disease has been linked to a
57% increase in patient deaths.
The treatment involved adding a drug called selegiline to the established
Parkinson's treatment, levodopa, in the hope of protecting against suspected
side-effects and prolonging life-span.
Instead, the UK Parkinson's Disease Research Group report in the British
Medical Journal, found 76 out of 271 patients treated with the combination were
dead after five years, compared with 44 out of 249 treated with levodopa alone.
The trial group, from 93 hospitals throughout the UK, were all
recently-diagnosed patients who had not previously been treated. The
combination seemed to offer ``no clinical benefit'' over levodopa alone in
treating early, mild Parkinson's disease.

<TEXT>
A MAN who preyed on foreign teenage boys visiting Edinburgh was jailed for 18
months yesterday.
Kevin Drumgoole, 56, met the young backpackers, offered them a place to stay,
plied them with drink, interfered with them, and videoed himself carrying out
sex acts on the teenagers, who were oblivious to what was going on.
Sheriff Richard Scott told him the court had to send a message to other people
tempted to carry out such ``atrocities''.
Defence counsel Robert Henderson QC, revealed that Drumgoole had previously run
a football team and been a swimming coach at the city's Commonwealth Pool.
``He has always been interested in youth,'' said Mr Henderson, ``and has done a
great deal of good for youth.''
Drumgoole's video tapes were found when police raided his flat looking for
child pornography. Eighteen tapes were found and, viewing them, officers came
across scenes of homosexual acts involving teenage youths who seemed to be
unconscious.
At an earlier Edinburgh Sheriff Court appearance, Drumgoole, of Milton Street,
Edinburgh, admitted seven charges involving sexual assaults on youths.
Six involved named teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17, and the seventh
covered a further 20 incidents involving unknown youths captured on video.
The charges covered more than three years, between June 1991 and August 1994.
Depute-fiscal Neil Allan described Drumgoole as ``predatory'', preying on the
young and inexperienced.
He said that in five of the charges, when the victims were traced to Germany
and Holland and interviewed, they were unaware of what had happened to them.
Sheriff Scott told Drumgoole the court had to send out a message: ``To make it
clear to any other miserable person like yourself, who is tempted to commit
atrocities of this kind, that they must not do it.''
He also imposed a nine-month supervised release order at the end of the prison
term.

A TEACHER whose dangerous driving left one man dead and four seriously injured,
was released by a sheriff yesterday, who told him he had too much to offer
society.
Mr Donald Henderson, 41, a physical education teacher at Renfrew High School,
was placed on probation for two years, ordered to carry out 240 hours community
service, banned from driving for five years, and ordered to re-sit his test.
Mr John Hannah, 56, of Sycamore Avenue, Beith, Ayrshire, died after the car in
which he was a passenger collided head-on with a car driven by Mr Henderson.
Mr Hannah had been returning home from work. His son was driving.
His widow, Nancy, 54, was stunned by the sentence yesterday and, calling for
tougher sentences, said: ``I don't want to think about that man but I did
expect him to go to jail.
``No matter how tough the sentence had been on that man, it wouldn't have
brought my husband back but if tougher sentences make careless drivers think
twice, then it's time they were introduced.''
A jury was told that the vehicle in which Mr Hannah was travelling was hidden
momentarily from view in a dip in the road at an accident blackspot and Mr
Henderson pulled out across double white lines to make an overtaking maneouvre.
Mr Henderson was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving, after
trial at Paisley Sheriff Court.
When he appeared for sentence, Sheriff David Pender said there would be nothing
to gain from sending him to prison.
He told Henderson: ``It is clear you are much more than a nine-to-five school
teacher and that you have much to offer. You have already destroyed one life
and if I was to send you to prison it would also destroy your life and the
lives of your wife and children.''
He and three others from the Renfrew Basketball Club were returning from a
match in Kilwinning on February 20 this year, when the crash happened on the
A737 west of the Roadhead roundabout near Netherbarford Farm, Lochwinnoch.
Mr Hannah, a dairy worker, died from his injuries on March 14.
Mr Henderson remained in a coma for two days in Glasgow's Southern General
Hospital, and spent a further two months in hospital recovering from head
injuries.
The court was told he had been left with physical and mental scars, although he
has been able partially to return to work.

<HEADLINE>Dirty tricks claim as councillor quits race</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974880821</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN SNP councillor said yesterday that he had pulled out of the contest to be
prospective parliamentary candidate for Tweeddale, Ettrick, and Lauderdale,
because he faced a straight choice between political ambition and personal
integrity.
Mr Willie McKay, education chairman on the new Scottish Borders Council, is
accusing local activists of a dirty tricks campaign against him.
He claimed last night: ``There are divisions in the local party. I don't mind
politics getting dirty but it was becoming very personal. I was even asked if I
was a Catholic or a Protestant. I raised the problem informally with people on
the national executive and, after a lot of thought, have decided to take no
further part in the contest.
Councillor McKay, a lecturer and former EIS convener at Borders College, has
already been through one selection process in competition with NEC member
Christine Creech, an Edinburgh solicitor who doubled the SNP vote when she
stood against Sir David Steel at the last General Election.
Mrs Creech came marginally ahead in the selection process for the party's next
candidate in the Borders seat but last weekend the NEC ruled that the contest
would have to be re-run because she did not have a clear majority.
Councillor McKay said: ``I thought long and hard and I just can't face the
infighting that going through the whole process again would involve. I will
stay a member of the SNP and represent it in local government. I will probably
have to face some sort of disciplinary action but I will accept whatever
happens.''
The SNP's Tweeddale, Ettrick, and Lauderdale convener Marshall Douglas said:
``I am extremely surprised at this development. The contest has been hard
fought up to now but there did not seem to have been any bitterness and I am
certainly unaware of any dirty tricks.''
Mrs Creech, who also fought the South of Scotland for the SNP in this year's
Euro Elections, said: ``The decision to stand down is a personal matter for
Willie McKay but, knowing the quality of the membership in the Borders, I would
be amazed if there had been anything underhand.''
At the last General Election, Mrs Creech won 5244 votes, compared with 2660 in
the previous election. Her share of the vote was up from 9% to 17%.
Her selection as prospective parliamentary candidate now seems assured, unless
a surprise contestant appears before nominations close on January 19.

<HEADLINE>Vote-rigging claims as Asian candidate loses selection contest for new seat Labour hit by race row</HEADLINE>

LABOUR was last night plunged into damaging accusations of racism, after a
selection battle in Glasgow ended with allegations of vote-rigging.
Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson emerged victorious in the contest to become his
party's prospective candidate in the new seat of Govan, but the manner of his
victory and the size of his winning margin led to immediate demands for an
appeal by supporters of one of his opponents, Councillor Mohammed Sarwar.
The Asian businessman, who had been widely tipped to become one of Britain's
first Muslim MPs, was clearly upset by the outcome, which came after 52 votes
were discounted by the party official overseeing the ballot.
``I am definitely not accepting this result,'' said Councillor Sarwar, who
represents Pollokshields on the existing Glasgow District Council and has been
elected to Pollokshields East on the new unitary authority.
``I am appealing to the national executive committee of the Labour Party. It is
extremely unfair when 52 members of the local party are declared not eligible
to vote.''
He called it an ``extremely sad situation'' that proper members of the party
were ruled out from voting, adding: ``What I am saying is that I think I was
unfairly treated.''
Mr Watson's victory involved a dead-heat with Councillor Sarwar. He won only
after a count-back procedure in which he led by just one vote, 237 to 236, in
the first ballot, which included women's caucus candidate Margaret Curran.
When the second preference votes of her supporters were redistributed the
result was a 245-vote dead heat, and under the party's voting rules the
one-vote victory in the initial ballot became conclusive.
Mr Watson was clearly discomfited by the manner of the result and the racism
allegations made by some of Mr Sarwar's supporters, but he said at the end of
the tortuous procedure: ``I wish it had been more decisive, but I am delighted
to have won. Now all I want to do is pull the constituency together.''
However, one of Mr Sarwar's supporters, constituency Labour Party vice-chairman
Mohammed Shoaib, said: ``Victory has been denied to us and we will consider
what course of action to take. Some people who have been party members for 10
years have now been thwarted.
``If victory has been denied to us by being Asian and we have been victimised,
the Labour Party should take action. I think Mohammed Sarwar did not have a
fair hearing throughout.''
He was supported by local Councillor Deirdre Gaughan, who said: ``I am in
neither camp, but when 52 people are told they were eligible to vote and are
then told their vote does not count, I am not happy.''
There appeared disquiet in the Asian community. Mr Tufail Shaheen, president of
the Islam Consul of Scotland and president of the Glasgow Central Mosque, said
that what had happened to the 52 members whose votes had been declared invalid
was ``very very wrong''.
Mr Shaheen said the Muslim community was now the second biggest in the UK with
two million members yet it did not have a single MP.
The outcome of the Govan vote had left the whole of their community ``very very
sad'' because they had thought they would have been assured of one MP when the
result was announced.
``I don't want to get involved in politics but what they have done to the 52
members is very very wrong. I don't know why they were rejected.''
He added: ``What has happened is that they don't like to see any MPs from our
community. Asians are not given any opportunities yet they are creating jobs.
``Mike Watson is my friend and a nice fellow but what has happened is bad.''
Mr Hanif Rajah, vice chair of the Pollokshaws, Strathbungo, and Langside branch
of the Labour Party, said the election had been unfair because people who are
members of the party could not cast their vote.
Mr Rajah said that he had attended branch meetings with every member who was
made ineligible to vote. ``Fifty-two members have been denied their rights and
there must be something wrong in that. Asian people have problems signing their
names but that doesn't mean to say they are fraudulent.
``I would not say it was racist. There is racism all over the country but not
in this case. It was an injustice for people with an Asian background.''
Mr Dilip Deb, a leading Asian lawyer, said that there had been nothing racist
in the vote. ``Mr Watson has been democratically elected as prospective Labour
candidate for Govan and we are sure that he will be as good an MP as Mr
Sarwar.''
The Labour Party hierarchy moved swiftly last night to endorse Mr Watson's
victory. ``The selection has been a long and time-consuming process which shows
that the Scottish Labour Party takes seriously the electorate of Govan,'' said
general secretary Jack McConnell.
``This result finalises the democratic choice of the members of the Govan
Labour Party. Everyone in the party should now accept the result and rally
behind Mike Watson to ensure a Labour victory in Govan at the next General
Election and the ending of 16 years of Tory rule.''
However, its main rivals in the seat, the SNP, also moved quickly to exploit
the situation. ``Labour's shambolic performance shows that they are unfit to
represent the people of Govan and Scotland,'' said local candidate Nicola
Sturgeon.
``The internal bitterness that the selection has generated shows that New
Labour is simply a meaningless slogan, with nothing to offer Govan or
Scotland.''

SARAJEVO.
THE end of the war brought no joy to the Serb-held Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza,
where many residents plan to flee before the district
reverts
to government rule.
As the peace accord was being signed, Ilidzans trudged wearily about their
business along snow-clogged streets under a banner which read: ``America -
thank you for peace but where should we go now?.
Nowhere has the end of the separatist Serb dream been more cruel and ironic
than in Sarajevo's northern and western suburbs, where Serbs maintained an
iron
grip throughout 43 months of war.
While a Serb republic within Bosnia will occupy 49% of the country, a
last-minute deal in peace negotiations transferred control of the Sarajevo
suburbs to a Muslim-Croat federation which will administer the other 51%.
``We fought and defended our homes with the blood of our husbands and sons and
the Muslims never defeated us,'' said 78-year-old Dragitsa Stanic.
``For us the peace is more terrible than the war. We will lose everything. We
cannot live with the Muslims. We will be refugees from the peace, not from the
war.''
As a suburb from which the long Serb siege of Sarajevo was mounted, Ilidza
boasted a far higher standard of living than the capital, for which it served
as a black market portal.
Now Ilidza is on the receiving end of the black market trade as Serb-held
Bosnia sags under international sanctions imposed to punish its war-mongering.
For Sanja, a refugee from the government-held town of Zenica, there is no
possibility of waiting for goverment authorities to take over Ilidza.
She fled to the Sarajevo suburb with her elderly parents and four sisters
early
in the war. Her twin was killed by a shell in December of 1992 and she
grieves
at the thought of having to leave the girl's grave behind when she goes.

A FOSTER carer was cleared yesterday of having left a child in a scalding bath
while answering a telephone call.
Haddington Sheriff Court heard that the two-year-old girl suffered 23% burns to
her body.
The 34-year-old mother of two, from East Lothian, who had been a foster carer
for two years before the incident, was found not guilty after Sheriff George
Presslie found no case to answer.
The woman said later: ``Thank God it is all over. These past few months have
been the worst in my life.'' She added: ``I can't put my family through this
again. I have given up fostering.''
The woman had denied causing the girl unnecessary suffering by leaving her
neglected and unattended in a bath of hot running water on August 12 and
failing to seek medical attention until August 14.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children, in Edinburgh, where surgeons assessed the extent of
the scalding.
It was claimed that parts of her legs, which had to be skin grafted, may be
scarred for life.
On the conclusion of the Crown evidence, defence solicitor Simon Collins
submitted that there was no case to answer.
Sheriff Presslie, giving his ruling, said there was no evidence to show that
the woman had set out deliberately to leave the child in a bath of hot, running
water. She had checked the water temperature, waited for a while, and seen no
steam.
Insufficient evidence had been led to show there was a potential danger of the
bath water temperature rising, how it rose, that it was likely to occur, or
that it should have been guarded against.
However, there was some evidence to show that medical care was provided for the
immediate needs of the child after she was scalded.
The carer had put the child in cold water, administered medicine with analgesic
properties and had provided plenty of liquids, he said.

A BLAZING row, a blazing gun - it was just like ``the Wild West'', a leading QC
told Stirling Sheriff Court yesterday.
As armed officers surrounded a house in the dead of night, a couple from Kansas
were led to safety from a neighbouring bed and breakfast house, and had to
spend the first night of their honeymoon in a police station.
However, the showdown happened a continent away from the Wild West, in the
King's Park area of Stirling, after one of the town's businessmen turned his
daughter's 21st birthday celebration into ``the party from hell''.
Yesterday, it ended in court, with the businessman being saddled with a #5000
fine.
The court was told that Debbie MacAulay's coming-of-age ended with armed police
surrounding the family home after her father, Brian MacAulay, 59, a private
landlord, tried to shoot his way out of a bedroom where he had been locked in
by other members of his family.
MacAulay, who was represented by Mr Donald Findlay QC, admitted repeatedly and
recklessly discharging the shotgun on September 14, through his bedroom door in
the direction of his wife Marilyn, his daughter Debbie, son Colin, and his
daughter's boyfriend, Mr Fraser McGhee. He also admitted being disorderly.
The court was told that, after going out for meal to celebrate his daughter's
birthday, the family returned to their home at Park Terrace about 11.30pm.
A row erupted over a video that was being watched and a scuffle developed, with
Mr MacAulay being ``extremely abusive'' and Mrs MacAulay slapping her husband
on his face, said depute fiscal Valerie Barber-Fleming.
The trouble escalated after Colin MacAulay pushed his father into his bedroom
and Mrs MacAulay locked the door.
MacAulay, who had banged his head and was bleeding and panicking, shouted that
he would shoot his way out.
The court was told he was very keen on guns, possessing both shotgun and
firearms certificates and owning three rifles, three shotguns, and a number of
other items.
He grabbed a shotgun that had been lying in the bedroom ready for a shooting
expedition the next day and fired it five times at the lock.
Mrs MacAulay and their son managed to escape from the house and telephone the
police, despite the fact their escape route lay past the door through which
MacAulay was shooting.
When armed officers arrived, they found MacAulay still in the bedroom and his
daughter and his son's girlfriend hysterical in the sitting room.
He was arrested without fuss after Mrs MacAulay told officers he would pose
them no threat.
Mrs Barber-Fleming said pellets from the shotgun were found in a skirting board
32ft from the peppered bedroom door.
Mr Findlay said all members of the family had been drinking and what should
have been a celebration had turned into a ``party from hell''.
He said the row over the video had developed into an unseemly squabble on all
sides and, after he was locked in his room, MacAulay panicked.
``He announced that if the family didn't unlock the door, he'd shoot the lock
off the door and that's what he did.
``The result, being like the Wild West, was quite unacceptable and potentially
dangerous. Mercifully, no-one was hurt by it,'' said Mr Findlay.
He said his client accepted it had been an irresponsible and thoroughly
unsavoury episode. Since the incident, MacAulay had been living apart from his
family. His wife now wanted him back.
He said his client's chances of being allowed to continue to hold gun licences
were remote.
The court was told the family had been out together for the first time after
the shooting on the night before the court case. It was MacAulay's birthday.
The celebration passed off without incident.
Sheriff Frederick Levine said he was satisfied with Mr Findlay's professional
assaurance that Mrs MacAulay wanted her husband back and that there was no
danger to the family.
MacAulay, said to be a man of ``substantial means'' capable of paying any
appropriate fine, was fined #5000 and ordered to pay within two weeks.
Last night, it emerged that the video that caused all the trouble was a
home-made holiday video of Colin MacAulay's girlfriend's father parascending.
At the time of the incident, police, including four specially trained firearms
officers, spent nearly four hours surrounding the MacAulay home.
They entered the house at about 4.30am and MacAulay left with them a short
while later.
Houses on both sides were evacuated. Mrs Alyson Pillinger, 35, who runs a bed
and breakfast next door to the MacAulays, said at the time that four Americans
had been staying with her, including a couple who had got married in Stirling
the previous day.
The honeymoon couple, Kathy and Steve Farkas, from Kansas, were awoken by the
police at 1.30am and had to spend the first night of their honeymoon in the
police station.
Mr MacAulay owns a number of flats and bedsits in Stirling, which he rents.
Through his solicitor, MacAulay said after the case he was glad the matter was
over and wanted to put it all behind him.

CROATIA
THEY also know war, but the smartly-dressed Christmas shoppers of the Croatian
capital of Zagreb had only shrugs and suspicion for peace deal.
``So there will be peace. I just wonder if it will hold,'' said Velko
Puntaric,
a 43-year-old employee at the National Theatre.
``Only God knows what will happen. We have to be optimists, but I do not trust
the Serbs at all,'' said Ivana Nadj, a 45-year-old housewife.
In Croatia, no one is doing anything special to celebrate in  Zagreb because
no
one knows whether the end of war in Bosnia really marks the start of peace.
There is more talk in the bustling snowy streets about the glittering
Christmas
lights, put up in trees and on lamp posts by the city council, than about the
peace deal.
Outside the sandbagged United Nations' headquarters, an impromptu monument
known as the Wall of Shame was still standing in silent reproach to
international mediators who did not stop Serbs seizing chunks of Croatia in a
1991 war.
Each brick in the wall is marked with the name of a person who went missing in
the fighting. Fresh candles and tiny bunches of flowers are still scattered
along its length.
Croatians' hesitations are rooted partly in fears their own part in the
settlement - sorting out the return of Serb-held Eastern Slavonia to their
control and sending back thousands of Croatian refugees who fled the Serbs -
has been neglected.
A separate November agreement provided for Eastern Slavonia to be reintegrated
in Croatia after a one to two-year transition under international
administration during which 90,000 Croat refugees are to regain their homes.
But implementation of the accord is stalled by US-UN. disputes over who should
provide enforcement troops.
Other Croatian lands seized by Serbs in 1991 were recaptured last summer.

An eerie calm descended over Brixton yesterday after a night of rioting took
its toll in human casualties and commercial property. William Russell walks the
not so mean streets and surveys the damage
IT was the run up to Christmas as usual yesterday afternoon in Brixton. The
strands of fairy lights suspended between the street lamps twinkled in the
afternoon gloom, and although some had gone out, victims of the previous
night's violence, the shooting stars and snowflakes attached to the lamp
standards sparkled away.
The chain stores, the inevitable High Street names, Woolworths, Boots, Marks &amp;
Spencer among them, were doing a roaring trade, as were the fast food cafes. If
there were a few boarded up windows on view, they were no more than is par for
the course in any down-at-heel shopping street in a working class area of
Britain today.
The market traders, whose stalls line the Victorian arcaded streets that curve
behind Brixton railway station, a relic of Victorian London, were peddling
their wares with vigour as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened only a
few hours before.
There were piles of cabbages and cauliflowers, oranges, and potatoes, bananas
and breadfruit, pot plants trimmed with tinsel piled in the backs of vans, and
Christmas trees lying in heaps on the pavement.
The scent of smoke in the air came not from smouldering wrecks of the burnt out
cars dragged out of the showroom and set alight in Effra Road (a familiar name
from past riots) long since removed, but from the sticks of incense a man was
peddling on the stairs leading from the tube station. Shut at the height of the
riot, it was back in business, differing only from other London underground
stations possibly in the number of security cameras in its entrance hall.
Brixton is a dodgy area at the best of times, and Wednesday night had been, if
not the worst of times, one of the bad times.
The McDonalds across the way was thronged - no worries about mad cow disease
there - and at the video store down the road which, in spite of its steel
shutters, had been looted they were repairing the broken glass and, in spite of
a depleted stock, a notice insisted it was open for business.
Some people had been lucky, others, like the recently opened Dog Star Club in
Atlantic Road had not. It was badly damaged, its expensive windows shattered,
its interior set alight, its future now in doubt.
But in spite of the apparent normality was clear something out of the ordinary
had occurred. The clue was not the number of police loitering with intent in
twos and threes at the street corners, at the zebra crossings, directing the
traffic and generally looking thoroughly fed up with their lot, but the
presence of those predators who turn up whenever disaster is in the air, who
were lying in ambush for their prey - the television companies' outside
broadcast vans with their menacing, all-seeing cameras waiting to bring the
flames and the petrol bombs and the baton charges into the living rooms of the
nation.
They were parked in a cosy little enclave, there being safety in numbers, on
the pavement opposite the red brick thirties town hall whose Christmas
greetings sign twinkled sadly.
The glass from the broken shop windows had long since been swept away, but the
boards which had been put up were not being allowed to prevent life going on.
The Midland Bank, one of several banks whose windows had been shattered, was
making the best of a bad job. Its cash dispenser was still operating through a
specially cut hole - you cannot fire bomb Mammon. Woolworth's, which like most
of the chain stores has massive steel shutters - smashed windows have happened
before in Brixton - would close at 3 pm, a notice said, while Boots, which also
boasted hefty metal grilles over its windows, admitted its customers in
carefully selected ones and twos. But that was as far as it went.
Nearby the red neon sign of the Ritzy cinema, a bourgeois enclave in this
wilderness of chain stores, seedy newsagents, and cut-price shops, shone
bravely in the gathering dusk. As usual the titles of the films on offer seemed
apallingly apt.
In the Bleak Midwinter, which it most certainly was, the wind blowing down
Brixton Road feeling as if it had come straight from the Steppes.
La Haine, or The Hate, which is a savage indictment of the violent treatment by
the Paris plain clothes police of three young French working class teenagers of
alien origin. Its account of thuggish behaviour by coppers in jeans and tank
tops seemed somehow relevant in the circumstances. Maybe everyone concerned
with Brixton's future peace should take a trip to the pictures.
And there was Apocalypse Now, except that it was clearly not the case that it
is apocalypse now in Brixton. Had it been life would not have been going on as
usual. Further down the hill towards Stockwell around Brixton police station it
got much more menacing. The streets were lined with some forty odd parked white
police vans, the riot shields over their windscreens raised, some empty, others
filled with policemen waiting their turn to go on patrol.
It was freezing. Nobody passing by wanted to talk about what had happened. They
just wanted to get on with their shopping, to return home safely and escape all
those threatening policemen and the provocative TV cameras.

<HEADLINE>System under fire as teacher is cleared</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A LEADING educational lawyer criticised prosecuting authorities last night for
dragging a dedicated teacher to court on the uncorroborated evidence of three
disruptive pupils.
Stirling Sheriff Court heard that the boys, aged eight and nine, were notorious
troublemakers at a declining primary school in Stirling.
Mr Thomas McGhee, 40, who has taught at the school for 19 years, was cleared of
assaulting the boys after a day-long trial. He had denied the charges
strenuously.
The court heard that Mr McGhee, a family man, regular churchgoer, and father of
three, had been allocated the tough primary five/six class at the beginning of
the autumn term because it needed a firm hand and had tried the patience of
many teachers.
On the second day of term, he had to tell his pupils: ``This is a classroom,
not a jungle.''
Almost immediately, he found himself at the centre of an inquiry by the family
unit of Central Scotland Police, which led to yesterday's court case.
The court heard that the children who made the allegations of assault were
among the worst behaved in the school.
An eight-year-old boy who claimed that on August 23 he had been lifted by the
chin and dragged from the classroom was so badly behaved that he once dropped
his trousers in front of one of Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools.
He had three times the previous year been excluded from school for disruptive
and attention-seeking behaviour.
Two nine-year-olds who claimed that, on August 24, Mr McGhee had banged their
heads together and thrown one of them against a wall, were disruptive and had
been fighting in class.
Colleagues gave evidence to describe Mr McGhee as a patient teacher.
Sheriff Frederick Levine said that, after hearing the evidence, he could find
no corroboration of the boys' stories.
Mr McGhee, of Buchan Drive, Dunblane, Perthshire, still faces an internal
disciplinary hearing by the education authority. He had not been suspended.
Outside the court, he said he had been deluged with messages of support.
He said: ``I'm very relieved it's all over and in a way very depressed that it
ever got to court in the first place.''
He added: ``I'm not the first and I won't be the last teacher to be involved in
this sort of thing.''
Mr Andrew Gibb, a solicitor for the EIS, Scotland's biggest teaching union, who
represented Mr McGhee in court, said he had become increasingly concerned over
the vulnerability of teachers facing false accusations.
He said teachers should in future never see a child on their own.
He said the Crown had taken no steps to test the credibility and reliability of
the evidence against Mr McGhee.
Mr Gibb said he believed procurators fiscal were being put under political
pressure to prosecute teachers.

ANALYSIS
WINSTON Churchill once described the military and diplomatic process of
peacekeeping as ``a measure designed not to get us to heaven, but simply to
keep us from descending into hell''.
It is a statement which aptly characterises the Nato-imposed ceasefire in
Yugoslavia.
The stroke of a pen may have ended the immediate conflict in Bosnia, roping
off
the warring factions behind new and artificial boundaries policed by Nato's
big guns. Whether the paper peace survives beyond the 12-month mandate of the
enforcers is an entirely different question.
The very terms of the settlement could be the seeds of a new outbreak of
bloodshed when Nato ups tent-pegs and pulls out early in 1997. In the
horse-trading for territory which followed the Muslim-Croat summer offensives,
civilians on all sides inevitably lost out.
Several hundred thousand people will now have to give up their homes as the
map
is redrawn along ethnic lines. The few who choose to remain in areas
reassigned to their former foes will have to live with the constant threat of
being caught, lonely, outnumbered and vulnerable, on the wrong side of the
divide. In a land where blood-feud has always been a way of life, that might
not be conducive to a long and comfortable existence.
Sarajevo, the focal point and poignant international symbol of the three-year
war, is the likeliest repeat flashpoint. The deal specifies that the battered
city now belongs to the Muslims.
It is not a decision calculated to endear Nato to the 70,000 Serb inhabitants
who now face the stark choice of becoming a besieged minority or refugees.
Serbia and Bosnia have agreed to recognise each other ``as sovereign,
independent states with the current international borders'', paving the way
for
the possibility of formal diplomatic relations, albeit across the gulf of a
still-tense no-man's-land. Croatia, the big winner in the three-sided
bloodbath, has stopped short of giving the Serbs that level of credence.
The 60,000-strong mainly Nato force, armed with tanks and heavy weaponry and
configured for combat rather than a police operation, will be in place within
the next two months.
That in itself is a major logistical and political achievement. While America,
Britain, and France will supply the bulk of the manpower, non-alliance
countries will also send smaller contingents to broaden the political base and
authority of the process. Russian and Czech troops will be serving under US
command for the first time.
With the armoured muscle of more than 100 US Abrams and 50 British Challenger
tanks and almost 500 Bradley and Warrior infantry fighting vehicles at its
core, the multinational Implementation Force represents a powerful deterrent.
The rules of engagement under which its men are to operate gives them more
than
adequate rights of self-defence and even offensive action if necessary.
The firepower under the IFOR banner would, in any kind of open confrontation,
leave the issue in no doubt.
However, they remain vulnerable to guerrilla tactics, particularly through the
winter now beginning. All the hi-tech Apache helicopter gunships in the world
cannot help if they are grounded by cloud or snow.
The Americans, recognising the one area where they could be made to pay an
unacceptable price in lives through hit-and-run attacks, are deploying two
National Intelligence Support Teams to keep tabs on potential rogue elements
of
the Serb, Croat and Muslim forces. Two other surveillance teams are already
in
place.
These units use satellites, unmanned drones, electronic eavesdropping and
other
clandestine techniques to collect detailed data on would-be terrorist groups
and their movements. Big Brother is already watching the most predictably
discontented individuals and units throughout the area and building up a
coherent intelligence picture for use if and when terrorist activity begins.
A major headache for the patrolling IFOR soldiers is the constant danger of
mines.
What will clearly happen, peace treaty or not, is that all of the former
protagonists will use the year-long breathing space to regroup, arm and train
effective forces of their own. The Americans have already announced that they
will offer formal military training to the Muslims to enable them to defend
themselves adequately against any future Serb or Croat aggression.
US aid of this kind was given to the Croats earlier this year to help them
build a strike force for the lighting ground offensive which recaptured much
of
the territory lost to the Serbs since 1992. It was part of the US strategy of
bringing the previously-victorious Serbs to the brink of military defeat and
to
encourage them to negotiate rather than fight.
With the lifting of the UN arms' embargo on the area, all sides will be able
to
beef up their arsenals with armour and, more dangerously, aircraft. Savage as
the three years of civil war have been, the death toll would have been
immensely higher and the results of combat more decisive if one or more of the
participants had possessed effective air power.
In the age of instability, the world is filled with nations only too happy to
provide bangs for the buck. Ironically, the coming of temporary peace may well
act as a trigger for a new arms race within the former Yugoslavia as the
precursor to a resumption of all-out war.

6.30pm According to police, the countdown to the riot began when peaceful
demonstrators against the death in custody of Wayne Douglas gathered outside
Brixton Police Station.
7pm There were 40 protesters and within an hour the number had risen to 125.
This group then moved off down Brixton Road and regathered peacefully outside
the Ritzy Cinema at the junction with Coldharbour Lane.
9pm The protest seemed to be losing steam and about a third of the protesters
had left. A group broke from the remaining demonstrators and marched back along
Brixton Road. It is unclear exactly what sparked the riot but the first reports
of violence occurred at this point, with missiles, including bottles, being
thrown at police. The larger group still outside the cinema then began to break
up and sporadic trouble flared across Brixton with shop windows being broken.
The police, fearing serious violence, donned protective riot gear and took out
shields and long batons. Mounted officers were also called in.
10pm Police were attacked, including an officer who was dragged off his
motorbike, cars were set on fire and dozens of shops were looted. Two gunshots
were reported at one point.
7am Morning breaks to reveal the full extent of the mayhem. A senior officer in
charge of the Brixton area defends police tactics. Paul Manning, the
Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner responsible for policing across
south-west London, rejects accusations from some protesters that officers were
heavy-handed. He blamed a ``small minority'' of people for the violence. He
denies the police over-reacted. ``Not at all. People were jumping in front of
moving vehicles, some people were clearly intent on not dispersing peacefully,
bottles and bricks were starting to be thrown -my officers were left with no
alternative than to take on protective gear and equipment and look to the
safety of passers-by and people using that stretch of road.''

Ian McConnell reports on the peculiar saga of Dunedin Fund Managers, which lost
senior members of staff and the confidence of significant investors
IT SEEMS surprising that something so simple as a clash of personalities could
have been allowed to fester until it resulted in the reduction of Dunedin Fund
Managers' senior staff and the loss of $590m of US funds to less volatile
investment houses.
The situation is even more astonishing when you consider Edinburgh-based
Dunedin is a subsidiary of the 300-year-old Bank of Scotland, a highly
conservative organisation not known for putting up with such nonsense.
There was no comment yesterday from the Bank of Scotland head office on why the
problems which have taken such a heavy toll on its fund-management subsidiary
were not nipped in the bud sooner.
This question was referred by The Mound to Eric Sanderson, chief executive of
Dunedin's immediate parent, British Linen Bank Group. He was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
The British Linen Bank chief executive was charged with the task of bringing
Dunedin to heel in October and his arrival on the scene was swiftly followed by
the departure of Dunedin's chairman, Hamish Leslie Melville, and its deputy
chief executive, Alan Kemp.
Even if Dunedin does manage to drag itself out of the mire - and many in the
industry believe a takeover is a more likely end to the saga - its troubles may
have tarnished the reputation of the Scottish financial community.
The problems which came so spectacularly to a head in October appear to have
started almost as soon as Mr Melville, the National Trust for Scotland chairman
who spent 15 years with Hambros Bank, took over as Dunedin chairman
three-and-a-half years ago.
His arrival was followed by the resignations of a few key members of staff and
the area where the senior people sat became known as the ``departure lounge''.
An industry source said of the departure lounge: ``That was a phrase that used
to be used when Melville first came. There were various people who went and
they all sat in the departure lounge.''
The British Linen Bank attributed the string of resignations which preceded
those of Old Etonian Mr Melville and Mr Kemp to ``clashes in management style''
among Dunedin's senior management.
When it was announced on October 30 that Mr Melville had resigned, Dunedin said
he would be leaving in two months' time. The Herald has been told he left
immediately.
Mr Melville's management style has been described as ``incredibly autocratic''.
He was unavailable to give his side of the story yesterday.
The source said: ``It wasn't so much a difference in (management) style as he
had a different style. He didn't know when to stop.''
Dunedin's troubles led to a ``depressed'' atmosphere within the office, which
developed into more open hostility.
The removal of investment director Gordon Anderson, in July, caused resentment
among Mr Anderson's colleagues.
Three months later, Nigel Barry, head of Dunedin's Pacific operation, and Peter
Tait, head of the European arm, handed in their notice. This appears to have
been the final straw for the Bank of Scotland and was swiftly followed by the
removal of Dunedin's top two.
But Dunedin's troubles were not over. Despite a trip by Mr Sanderson to the US
to reassure clients, one smaller and two major clients switched $590m (#383m)
of funds from the Edinburgh outfit.
Before the problems came to a head, Dunedin was making impressive progress on
the other side of the Atlantic, with more than one-third of its #5600m of funds
under management having come from US clients.
More money could go on the back of this month's news that six fund managers,
including Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust manager Alan Clark and Dunedin
Smaller Companies manager Neil Pirie, were leaving.
Emerging markets specialist Euan Rae was another of the six casualties, which
followed steps by Mr Sanderson to ``distinguish who among the investment staff
were committed and who were not''.
With most of the US funds thought to be on 30 days' notice, it is not clear
whether more will go, with clients likely to wait until after Christmas if they
do decide to take their money elsewhere.
The latest six to depart are rumoured to be joining Castle Rock, a new
fund-management company set up by Dunedin rebels with the backing of
Philadelphia National Bank. Mr Anderson is thought to be a key player in the
establishment of Castle Rock, and Mr Barry and Mr Tait could join him.
Where Dunedin goes from here is anybody's guess. Foreign &amp; Colonial has been
cited as a potential purchaser but said this week it had ``no plans at the
present time to get involved''.
Dunedin is likely to be attractive to other Scottish investment houses such as
Ivory &amp; Sime and Abtrust, and even partnerships such as Martin Currie are being
bandied about as possible buyers. European banks are also considered to be in
the frame for Dunedin, whose Edinburgh Investment Trust is in the top five in
the UK in terms of market capitalisation.
There is a rumour that Edinburgh Fund Managers might bid and another view that
this transaction might be in the opposite direction.
Dunedin is adamant it is neither for sale nor interested in a merger and anyone
with designs on the fund management group would have to deal with the might of
the Bank of Scotland.
But Rolly Crawford, investment trust analyst at BZW in London, said: ``I think
the Bank of Scotland have to get their cheque book out. They either have to
sell it (Dunedin) or buy people or buy another company. They can't just leave
it as it is.''
Morale at Dunedin has apparently improved since Mr Sanderson arrived and the
choice of a new executive chairman will be crucial to the future of the fund
management group.
Most industry analysts believe a takeover, if there were to be one, would not
come before the spring.

THE row over the Scottish Enterprise budget cut grew last night with an angry
exchange of letters between Labour's George Robertson and Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth.
Mr Robertson said he had found it astonishing that the Scottish Enterprise
chairman ``should be practically volunteering cuts in his own budget.''
It showed the extent ``to which Michael Forsyth will exploit his quango empire
towards his own political ends.''
Mr Forsyth replied he had been assured that the organisation could live with a
7.5% cut ``and yet maintain or improve output through increased efficiencies.''
He described as ``singularly inappropriate'' Mr Robertson's criticism of the
Scottish Enterprise chairman.

THE Tory MP who is sponsoring a Bill to harmonise daylight hours in Britain
with those in the rest of the European Union yesterday accused Scottish
Secretry Michael Forsyth, a strong opponent of the measure, of being unaware of
changing opinions on the issue in Scotland and the rest of the UK.
Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West, was responding to news that the
Cabinet had decided to remain neutral on his Bill after earlier reports that a
number of Ministers were urging that the Government should support it.
Mr Forsyth has been credited with persuading his Cabinet colleagues not to take
sides and arguing that the change would cause great anger in Scotland,
especially in northern parts where mornings would be made dark for longer.
Mr Butterfill said the decisions signalled that the Government was willing to
let the Commons have its own say on a free vote. He was confident that the Bill
would be given a second reading on January 19.
He added: `` I regret that my colleague Michael Forsyth has not awaited the
outcome of the debate. It would appear he is unaware that public opinion in
Scotland and the rest of the UK has changed dramatically since the matter was
last tested nearly thirty years ago.''
The last survey by NOP found that 62% of Scots favoured a change which would
provide an extra hour of daylight, with only 29% opposed.
Intimations of Cabinet neutrality indicate that the ``payroll vote'' of
Ministers and Parliamentary Private Secretaries will not be wheeled out
unofficially to vote down the second reading.
Mr Butterfill looks likely otherwise to receive a large majority for the Bill
on second reading and it will be for opponents to utilise the limited time
available to Private Member's Bills to prevent it reaching the Statute Book.
The Government, by convention, does not make extra time available for a
backbench MP's Bill which has run out of time, except occasionally if it is
uncontroversial or backed by an overwhelming number of MPs.

THE Conservative Party yesterday named a political editor as its champion in
the battle of the ``spin doctors'' that will dominate the run-in to the General
Election.
Charles Lewington quit as assistant editor with responsibility for politics at
the Sunday Express to take on the #70,000-a-year job and one of the toughest
challenges at Westminster.
The urbane Mr Lewington, 36, will be pitched into a head-to-head struggle with
Alastair Campbell, the tough Labour media chief and a former colleague in the
parliamentary press gallery.
Westminster observers believe the politics of the ``sound bite'' - the use of
striking phrases to generate instant media coverage - will play a greater role
than ever before in putting across the message.
Mr Lewington faces the mammoth task of hauling back the overwhelming Labour
lead in the opinion polls in a bid to secure a fifth term of office for the
Tories.
Public school-educated Mr Lewington, political editor of the Sunday Express for
four years, claimed he had no intention of joining the ranks of party ``spin
doctors'' charged with putting political gloss on news developments.
``My approach to this job will be simple. I do not consider myself to be a spin
doctor, spin doctors invent sound bites and then spin a web of deceit around
them,'' he said.
``Sound journalists are best suited to selling sound policies. I am honoured
that the Prime Minister and the party chairman have the faith in me to do just
that.''
The Prime Minister, on the way to the EU summit in Madrid, said he was
delighted to welcome Mr Lewington to Central Office.
THE Tories received some good news with a new opinion poll showing the
Chancellor's strategy for political recovery is working.
A survey by the Guardian/ICM published today shows that when people were asked
which party has the best policies to deal with the economy, Labour has slipped
from 38 to 33 and the Tories have climbed from 20 to 24, the highest rating for
nearly three years and the best since Mr Clarke became Chancellor in 1993.
However, Labour's lead in the monthly voting intention poll remains unchanged
at 17.
Conservative Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney said the poll ``demonstrates
that as people turn their attention to economic matters the Government's
policies are increasingly seen to be impressive and that Labour's sums don't
add up.''

WILL peace in the Tory Party hold until the General Election? Since the
leadership election in July there has been an uneasy and armed truce in our
party over Europe. Will war break out again?
I believe we shall be able to stick together until the General Election. Some
arguments militate against my view. There is constant sniping. This week John
Redwood published his pamphlet against a single currency in Europe.
Immediately, there came a counter-attack from Lord Howe and Sir Leon Brittan.
Wherever and whenever the issue of Europe is raised in the House of Commons, we
the Eurosceptics are present in significant numbers and always argue our case.
The Government seems to be vaguely sympathetic to us without giving us any
specific commitment.
The Euro-enthusiasts, such as Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine, may be very
influential in the Cabinet but their supporters on the present back benches are
few in number and many are unwilling to argue their corner in public.
Every day brings further criticism of the Government's lack of clarity over
Europe. This week David Howell, a Government loyalist if there ever was one,
said that our foreign policy is ``too busy running after the French and Germans
and being terrified they're going to pull some trick and we are going to be
left behind''.
His views are a clear indication of how the loyalist centre of the Tory Party
has shifted towards the Euro-sceptic wing of the party. No doubt, next week
some other long-serving loyalist will give the political ball another kick in
the direction away from Euro-federalism.
For all the signs of potential trouble, I still believe the truth will hold
until the General Election. There can be no war over mere expressions of
opinion. The House of Commons can only disagree formally with the Government on
Europe when there is a vote authorising more money to be paid to Europe or
where there is legislation transferring more power to Europe.
Only in those two circumstances need the Government press its view to a
confrontation with the Euro-sceptics.
Last year we had the vote on the extra money that was required after the
Maastricht Treaty. That vote gave rise to the expulsion of the Tory Party of
the eight so-called whipless. Now we are moving slowly towards an
inter-governmental conference. The inter-governmental conference will not be
concluded until mid-1997.
The timetable has been agreed by all the great powers of Europe. So for the
Tory Euro-sceptic there's no point in taking the argument so far as to damage
the present Government. It is by no means certain this Government will conclude
the negotiations on the IGC - for we must have a General Election before April
1997.
What, we ask, will happen if the Government is then led by Tony Blair? It is
clear an incoming Labour Government will embrace the Social Chapter. The Tory
Party is united and vocal in its opposition to all proposals that come under
this heading. It is not absolutely certain Labour would take this country into
a single currency.
However, we can say Labour is much more likely to favour a single currency than
is the Conservative Party. We, the Euro-sceptics, do not want a Labour
Government and above all we want to ensure the Tory Party is big enough and
united enough in the next Parliament to lead an effective challenge to any
Labour Government.
So what can we anticipate in the Tory Party between now and the General
Election? There will be manoeuvring and the taking-up of tactical positions.
But this is not war. The single currency is the greatest of the issues.
I expect that the present compromise by which we leave the issue open will last
until the General Election. On other issues, concessions of no great importance
will be made to the Euro-sceptic point of view.
Reluctantly, and eventually, a White Paper on the Government's negotiating
position at the IGC will be published. The Government will start to make
sceptical noises about the European Court of Justice. There will be arguments
about the extension of qualified majority voting. Then there will be a
discussion about the powers of the European parliament.

THE few people close to Stephen Wilkinson had no concept of the bizarre
workings of his mind. He shut himself away from society and developed sickening
obsessions with death and an inflated view of his creative potential.
This led to the domination of his personality by the ``dark side'' alter ego he
knew as Winston Jinks.
Wilkinson's paranoid schizophrenia dated from his teens, became accelerated at
the time of a suicide attempt at 21, and materialised horrifically when he
stormed into Nikki's classroom.
Evidence at the trial depicted him as a complex character of deep contrasts -
his reserved exterior masking an internal turmoil.
It was thought that his three unsuccessful applications for a job as a mortuary
attendant could have been his way of compensating for his inability to have
relationships with living people.
Although he left school without qualifications, and never subsequently had a
job, Wilkinson could write with a chilling eloquence. He was judged by Mensa to
have a near-genius IQ of 149.
The short novels, stories, poems, and philosophical ramblings which surfaced
after his arrest were heavily laced with death in the most macabre sense.
No-one, apparently, had seen those writings before Nikki was killed. Had they
done so, it might have been possible to avoid the outcome because his writing
contained strong hints of what was to come.
In his six-page Thought/ Confessions, written two months before his rampage at
Hall Garth Comprehensive School, Wilkinson wrote: ``. . . I shall steal the
lives of society's weakest members; those most vulnerable and those most
treasured.''
He further warned: ``I know that if I enter that (the word `that' was
underlined) building I will have crossed the Rubicon and it frightens me. I
cannot stop myself. It will be done.''

THE inaugural meeting of the Highland Rail Development Partnership took place
yesterday as the first step in a campaign to promote the Highland rail network
after years of having to defend it.
The partnership was born out of a rail conference organised by the Friends of
the Far North Line in Inverness in October. That meeting resolved that the
campaign to save the Fort William sleeper should be the last one fought in
defence of Highland rail services.
Yesterday's meeting, at the Inverness headquarters of Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, brought together representatives of ScotRail, Railtrack, the
Scottish Tourist Board, Highland Regional Council, the new Highland Council,
freight operator Transrail, HIE, local enterprise company Lochaber Ltd, and
rail campaign groups.
HIE chief executive Iain Robertson said yesterday: ``We got off to an excellent
start and the task for the partnership now will be to identify ideas and match
resources to specific schemes which can tap into resources of funding such as
local authorities, the HIE network, and the European Objective One Programme.''
The establishment of a Rail Development Officer post and the need to identify
projects had been among the principle discussion points. HIE would consider
joint-funding the proposed two-year post and would assist in drawing up a bid
for Objective One matching funds as part of a broader umbrella of potential
rail development schemes, Mr Robertson said.
The development officer would cover all lines within the Highlands as well as
feeder routes into the area from Perth, Aberdeen, and Glasgow.

THE local authority which last week lost a year-long battle to destroy #27,000
worth of Lanark Blue cheese is still considering the possibility of further
legal action, it was confirmed yesterday.
The Herald has also learned that the director of environmental health who led
Clydesdale District Council's case against cheesemaker Humphrey Errington, of
Dunsyre, had no formal environmental health qualifications.
The SNP's business spokesman, Mr Fergus Ewing, has described the disclosures as
bizarre and warned that the party will ask Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
to intervene if the council does not accept full responsibility for the matter.
Sheriff John Douglas Allan last week turned down a bid by the council to
destroy 44 batches of the cheese and criticised its methods.
Yesterday, Mr Duncan McDougall, the council's head of environmental services,
refused to rule out the possibility of further legal action.
He said: ``Our legal team are still discussing the matter. Councillors will be
appraised of the situation at an environmental health committee meeting next
Wednesday.''
Mr McDougall also confirmed that Mr Bob Russell, who led the council's case
against Mr Errington as director of housing and environmental health, did not
possess any formal environmental health qualifications.

<RECORDNO>974880847</RECORDNO>

THE House of Lords ruled yesterday that suspicion of abuse is not enough to
remove children from their parents.
Campaigners hailed the decision as a major breakthrough and said it would end
traumas such as the ``Satanic abuse'' case in Orkney where children were taken
from their families only to be returned after allegations proved unfounded.
However, social workers warned that the judgment could lead to more dangers for
youngsters, who would lose the protection of the law while allegations were
investigated.
The Lords said orders to take children into care must be based on some evidence
that the child would be vulnerable to abuse.
They were ruling on a case involving a family from Nottinghamshire, where a
teenage girl alleged her stepfather had abused her before she left home.
The local social services department asked the county court for a care order
for three younger children still at home.
However, the court, and later the Court of Appeal, turned down the application
on the grounds that the teenager's allegations were unsubstantiated.
The council took the case the House of Lords.
The Law Lords' ruling will have repercussions on how the Children's Act is
interpreted.
Ms Beth Henderson, a solicitor representing one of the parties in the case,
said the ruling made it clear that social workers could not remove children
thought to be at risk without hard facts.
She said: ``This ruling is a very important decision as it strikes a balance
between a family's rights to privacy and the need to protect children.''
Barrister Allan Levy QC, an expert on children's law who represented one of the
minors involved in the case, said: ``This is the most important ruling on the
Children's Act since it came into existence.
``It would stop cases such as the Satanic abuse case and would stop children
being removed from their families on the basis of suspicion alone.''
However, the Association of Directors of Social Services said the ruling could
put children in danger.
Former president Robin Sequiera said: ``It is a very significant judgment which
flies in the face of the role of the lower courts.''

STEPHEN Wilkinson, a paranoid schizophrenic, would have killed all 25 children
in a classroom he raided if he had not been stopped, a detective said last
night.
It was a view echoed by parents and teachers as they poured out their feelings
in the aftermath of his trial at a news conference at Cleveland Police
headquarters.
Detective Chief Inspector Brian Leonard, who led the inquiry, said: ``He wanted
to go out in style and I suspect he went in not to kill one child but to kill
them all.''
One girl died in the incident in March last year. Nikki Conroy's killer was
sent to a secure hospital for the criminally insane for the rest of his life
after his trial came to an abrupt halt yesterday.
The jury at Leeds Crown Court was directed by the judge to return a formal
verdict of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility
after four forensic psychiatrists all agreed he was severely mentally ill on
the day of the attack.
Wilkinson, 31, of Middlesbrough, Cleveland, denied murdering Nikki Conroy, 12,
but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He also
pled guilty to the attempted murders of Michelle Reeve, 13, and Emma Winter, 12.
Nikki died of multiple stab wounds and Michelle and Emma were also knifed after
revolver-wielding Wilkinson burst into their maths lesson at Hall Garth
comprehensive, Middlesbrough, and forced teacher Graham Nellist to leave.
Wilkinson was overpowered when the school's deputy head, Mr Chris Bielby, and
teaching colleague Dave Eland, alerted by Mr Nellist, stormed in. Only later
was the handgun found to be a replica.
Wilkinson, a jobless loner with a genius level IQ, had also been armed with
three knives and an axe. The court heard how more children would almost
certainly have died if the teachers had not charged in at that point.
Recommending bravery commendations for the teachers, Mrs Justice Smith said:
``By their actions they in fact prevented the tragedy from being any greater.''
There had been a burden on the defence during the trial, which began on Monday,
to satisfy the jury that Wilkinson was suffering from a mental abnormality. The
judge accepted that this had been done.
Nikki's parents, Peter and Diane, were in the public gallery. They were in a
very emotional state, with Mrs Conroy weeping and being comforted by her
husband.
The judge said to them: ``There is not a person in this court who does not
sympathise with your point of view but I do hope you will accept this decision
has not been taken lightly but with great care by the doctors, by counsel, and
by me.''
Wilkinson told psychiatrists that before the attack he sat alone drinking
whisky and it was then his ``dark side alter ego'', which he named Wilson
Jinks, took over.
He spoke of Jinks leaving the house in his body and he felt compelled to go
along too. He watched, he said, as Jinks carried out the attack.
The view that a mass killing could have happened was echoed by Mr Bielby and Mr
Eland. They charged in immediately they saw him stabbing at the children. He
had made them kneel on the floor in a line with their eyes closed.
Mr Bielby said: ``I believe he would have worked his way along the row of
children, having started at one end. I feel that was his intention - I don't
know where he would have stopped.
``As soon as we saw what was happening, there was no choice - we had to stop
him and get the children out. Anyone in that situation would have done the
same.''
The actions of the teachers, including Mr Nellist who was forced out of the
room at gunpoint by Wilkinson, were roundly praised by Nikki's parents. But Mr
Conroy said: ``I think at the time he was sane although now he is insane. I
will always believe he went into that school knowing what he was going to do.''
He added: ``I think the parents of the girls and boys who were in that class
should now think that if it wasn't for these three teachers their children
would not be here because he would have killed them all.''

A SINGLE mother of three is facing eviction after complaints from her
neighbours about noise and the behaviour of her eight-year-old son.
Mrs Maureen Shanley was taken to court by Edinburgh District Council, which
wanted her thrown out of the house at Granton View. At Edinburgh Sheriff Court
yesterday, Sheriff Andrew Lothian granted the eviction order.
The council had already been to court, in 1994, after complaints about Mrs
Shanley's son Craig. It obtained an interdict ordering Mrs Shanley not to allow
members of her household to damage neighbours' doors, windows, or gardens or to
cause disturbance.
Sheriff Lothian said yesterday that the neighbours, who previously enjoyed a
quiet life, had suffered ``far beyond what should be expected''.
He accepted that it was a difficult case as it involved young children, but
pointed out that problems had been persistent.
Sometimes the behaviour of Mrs Shanley and her family had been quite
deliberate, added the sheriff.
He rejected a suggestion from Mrs Shanley's solicitor that he should order the
council to rehouse the family. ``I would simply be asking the landlord to move
the problem somewhere else,'' he said.
Neighbours told yesterday's hearing that Craig had caused problems by kicking
his football against a gate and into gardens. They claimed he had also been
involved in spitting at younger children living nearby and throwing stones at
windows and passing cars.
Mrs Shanley, 41, said some of the claims made by her neighbours were made up
and others exaggerated.
One 73-year-old neighbour told Sheriff Andrew Lothian how another elderly man
was ``harassed and baited'' by a group of youngsters including Craig Shanley.
He ran from the group several times and swiped the man's face with his empty
jacket sleeve to the cheers of the other youngsters.
The pensioner also complained about a dog howling and barking, full-blast rave
music, and rows involving screamed abuse. He also said that Mrs Shanley had
recently tried to intimidate him.
Mrs Shanley said she had controlled her son as best she could since the
interdict was granted against her. She said he was hyperactive and accepted
that he had ongoing problems at school.
``I just think that things are blown out of all proportion,'' she said. She
denied allegations of late-night noise and of members of the family
deliberately jumping on the floor to annoy neighbours.
She described one neighbour, at the forefront of complaints against her, as a
``very sad old man'' who sat at his window all day noting the car numbers of
people who visited the Shanley house.
He had falsely accused Mrs Shanley and her elder daughter of being prostitutes
and her four-year-old daughter was ``terrified'' of him, she said.

ENGLAND soccer coach Terry Venables last night spoke of his disappointment at
losing a court battle in which a judge questioned his reliability as a witness
and cast doubt on the way he did business.
The controversial football figure, whose claim that he has been the victim of a
``conspiracy'' to damage his reputation was also rejected, was speaking
following a ruling that his London club, Scribes West, had to pay up over a
disputed bill.
In a statement issued by his solicitor, Mr Nick Trainer, Mr Venables said he
was ``disappointed'' he had been ordered to pay a proportion of the original
claim as well as a large slice of advertising executive Jeffrey Fugler's legal
bill.
``However, I feel significantly vindicated in that the claim (for #19,379.88
plus interest) was almost halved and his outrageous tactics and allegations of
dishonesty resulted in Mr Fugler being able to recover less than half the costs
he originally applied for.''
He said the comment by Mr Recorder Williams that ``forged'' invoices Mr Fugler
had disclosed ``were an April Fool's joke or created deliberately to discredit
me is very important''.
Of equal importance was the judge's concern ``at the close proximity in time''
of Mr Fugler's witness statement and its details appearing in the Daily
Telegraph.
``My QC, David Farrer, described the use of the forged invoices as blackmail
and the judge did not disagree with him,'' said Mr Venables.
He added: ``I believe that Mr Fugler will be significantly out of pocket in
this case and I wish this to be an example that I will not yield to such
disgraceful tactics.''
Mr Venables's own legal costs are thought to be in the region of #100,000.
Together with the judge's decision that he would also have to pay half of Mr
Fugler's costs and the #11,292-plus-interest portion of the businessman's
claim, add up to a final bill of nearly #160,000 for the soccer coach.
The case centred on an unpaid bill of nearly #20,000 owed for a campaign to
promote the soccer coach's then ailing club.
Mr Fugler, 43, who carried out the work, said he had received only a third of
#30,000 that should have been due to him for distributing 20,000 leaflets.
The judge, who strongly rebuked the businessman for the way he had handled part
of the affair, said because he had failed in some of his arguments his award
would be reduced.

<RECORDNO>974880852</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank led western European central banks in cutting interest rates
yesterday, cutting its main discount rates by half-of-a-percentage point.
The German central bank cut its discount and Lombard rates to 3% and 5%
respectively, the first cut since August. It also cut its key money market rate
to 3.75% from 3.98% at the same time.
The Swiss National Bank anticipated the German move, announcing a few minutes
earlier it was lowering its discount rate to 1.5% from 2.0%, effective from
today.
The Bundesbank's policy-making council held its final meeting of 1995 with many
markets undecided whether it would follow Britain's lead on Wednesday and cut
rates or wait until the new year.
The markets took the the cuts in their stride, reacting little to the changes
they had long been calling for.
The Bundesbank said it had also decided to set a wider growth target of four to
7% for its main monetary policy indicator, M3 money supply, next year, compared
with this year's four to 6% goal.
In a statement, it said money supply developments, coupled with the strength of
the mark and favourable inflation prospects gave it room to cut rates.
Weaker-than-expected third quarter growth data published last week showing
year-on-year expansion of just 1.5% had triggered a chorus of calls for it to
give the economy more breathing room by reducing the cost of borrowing.
But some analysts had said the loud calls for interest rate cuts from German
banks, politicians and labour groups might prove counter-productive, as the
fiercely independent central bank never liked to be seen to be bowing to
outside pressure.
The Belgian, Dutch, Austrian and Danish central banks swiftly followed the
German lead.
The Belgian National Bank cut its key central interest rate to 3.75% from
3.95%, effective from today.
The central bank cut its end-of-day rate to 5% from 5.2%. The discount rate was
cut to 3% from 3.5%.
Denmark's Central Bank said it cut 14-day certificates of deposit (CD) and
two-week state paper repurchase rates to 4.75% from 5%, also effective as of
today.
At the same time, the bank trimmed its discount and key deposit rates to 4.25%
from 4.75%.
The Dutch central bank said it cut its key secured loans rate to 2.75% from
3.25%, effective today.
The secured loans rate applies to commercial banks' daily borrowing at the
central bank under a three-month credit quota.
The Austrian National Bank cut its discount rate to 3% from 3.5% in line with
the moves by the other European central banks.

A BENIGN set of inflation figures yesterday gave substance to the view, shared
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England,
that the Government is on course to reduce the underlying inflation rate to
2.5% or less by early next year.
The two men were aware of the November inflation figures when they met on
Wednesday and decided to reduce interest rates by a quarter of a point to 6.5%.
The Bundesbank weighed in yesterday with half-point cuts in its discount and
Lombard rates and a 0.23% cut its repo money market. The US is expected to
reduce its Fed funds rate by a quarter point on Tuesday.
With inflationary pressures moderating and rates falling overseas, City hopes
are high that UK rates will drop by another 0.25% when Kenneth Clarke meets
Eddie George on January 17.
Adam Cole, UK economists at stockbrokers James Capel, said that smaller changes
in rates meant they could be more frequent.
The Retail Price Index was unchanged last month at 149.8 (January 1987 = 100),
and the headline rate edged down from 3.2% in October to 3.1%. The underlying
rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments, was unchanged at 2.9%. The
RPIY rate, which excludes indirect and local government taxes as well as
mortgage payments, was also unchanged at 2.4%.
The three month annualised RPIY rate has fallen to around 2% after seasonal
adjustment. Mr Cole said, ``This was the fifth consecutive monthly fall in
inflation on this basis and the significant gap opening up between annual and
shorter term measures of inflation suggests a further deceleration over the
coming months.''
The Central Statistical Office said the biggest contribution to the annual
headline rate came from motoring costs falling more steeply this November than
last.
Motoring costs fell by 0.8% last month, compared with a decline of 0.4% in
November last year. This was mainly due to steeper reductions in car prices.
Petrol prices also fell.
Other significant effects on the headline rate came from prices for food and
household goods which had smaller rises than last year and from sharper
reductions in alcohol prices than last November.
Seasonal food prices declined by 0.7% last month in contrast to a rise of 0.3%
in November last year. Non-seasonal food prices rose by 0.2% against an
increase of 0.4% in the same month last year.
Special pre-Christmas offers on alcoholic drinks reduced prices by 0.5%
compared with a drop of 0.3% last November. A rise of 0.8% in household goods
prices was lower than last year's 1% increase.
Mr Cole said: ``Inflation in several of the key High Street sectors fell back
in the month while service sector inflation remains within a whisker of its
all-time lows.
``The latter, which is relatively unaffected by the recent rise in import
prices, underlines the extent to which domestically generated inflation
pressures are all but non-existent.''
Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, estimates that the Budget measures will
take 0.2% off the underlying rate over the next two months as a result of the
non-indexation of alcohol duties in the Budget and last year's mini-Budget
measures dropping out of the annual calculation.
David Walton, Goldman's senior economist, said: ``Our forecasts show a
plateauing in inflation at close to current levels throughout 1996, falling to
below the Government's 2.5% target in the first half of 1997.
``This should enable the Chancellor to announce further base rate cuts in
coming months and we continue to expect a fall to 5.75% by the middle of next
year.''
The CSO announced that the #50 electricity rebates due to households in England
and Wales would not be treated as a price reduction. Its inclusion would have
resulted in a sharp drop in inflation next year followed by a big jump in 1997
as it dropped out of the annual comparison.

THE Archie Norman revitalisation of Asda continues with half-time profits
jumping 27.2% to #138m based on the best sales growth in the supermarket
sector. These rose 12.6% in like-for-like stores with the underlying volume
jumping 9.7% thanks in part to the increasing success of the George range of
clothing - that is now fully owned.
The City liked what he was saying yesterday and the shares initially advanced
to 109p in a flurry of analyst upgrades before closing only 1p better at
106!sp. Most revisions were around #15m to about #300m.
He dismissed speculation that he was on any Tory Party short list, telling a
press conference ``this is not a career meeting'' and that he is committed to
Asda for the next three years.
He also defended not giving #20 Christmas bonuses to some staff who had been
absent in the previous six months for whatever reason although that was partly
up to the store manager's decision. But some 95% will receive an entitlement.
He claimed 90% of Asda workers are happy in their jobs with union membership in
the past three years having declined from 72% to 19% and Asda having given the
largest pay rises in the sector, some 95% will receive an entitlement.
Asda is accepting all the vouchers, such as those from competitors loyalty
cards, until Sunday in all its 207 stores to increase quite substantially the
retailing pressure before Christmas.
Tesco has already complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about a
pilot test last week.
Last night Tesco said that it was an empty gesture and that Asda customers must
be fed up. ``Do Asda want them to stop at Tesco to qualify for cash discounts
at Asda?''
Three stores will be open for 24-hours including Edinburgh although that will
place a considerable strain on the managements.
Although thwarted at present until the Office of Fair Trading decides whether
Asda can resume selling over the counter medicaments and vitamins at discount
prices, Mr Norman is promising an alternative strategy but is saying little at
present.
The like-for-like volume gains after stripping out the additions from new
openings are appreciably higher than for Tesco and Safeway while both J
Sainsbury and Kwik Save are in decline.
That is partly due to offering the cheapest shopping basket of the big four
supermarket chains which has resulted in operating margins, although rising
0.4% to 4.7%, still well below the Sainsbury 7.8%, the Safeway 6.9% and Tesco's
6.0%.
Mr Norman said that gross margins will remain under pressure and the way
forward was through increasing efficiencies including the introduction of a
#70m information systems programme. Sales per employee rose 8% in the 28 weeks
to November 11.
Yet the advertising spend in the last six months was the lowest amongst the
majors at #6m compared with the Sainsbury figure at #16m at the other extreme.
That speaks volumes about customer acceptance.
The opening programme is for six new stores including Govan and Queensferry and
two refurbishments - Cumbernauld and Hartlepool. That is unlikely to accelerate
as a result of ever tighter planning restrictions.
Some 18 stores have so far been converted this year and there are another 80
awaiting conversion to underpin growth in the short to medium term.
The interim dividend has been increased 18% to 0.72p.

<HEADLINE>ELECTRICITY Hydro-Electric profits from an increase in sales of power to the south</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric is steadily increasing its power sales throughout the
UK, unlike most of the regional electricity companies (RECs) which rely on
efficiency gains to boost profits in a restricted local market.
An 18% increase in the volume of electricity sold to customers in England and
Wales helped Hydro-Electric boost operating profits by 10.8% to #64.8m during
the six months to September 30.
The Perth-based company sells more than a third of its electricity south of the
Border and this is its main focus for future expansion.
Pre-tax profits nearly doubled to #61.7m, but this reflects the fact that
first-half earnings were held back last year by an #18.8m exceptional charge
for the early redemption of a bond issue.
The interim dividend was raised by 9.4% to 4.75p, because Hydro-Electric is
saving its strength for several large investments.
But investors, whose expectations have been raised by the special dividends
paid out by cash-rich English RECs, were maybe expecting more. Hydro-Electric
shares fell 2p to 359p.
The company plans to build a string of new power stations in England and Wales
and it still has a slim chance of acquiring the pumped storage business which
has been demerged from National Grid.
This consists of two hydro-electric power stations in Wales which produce up to
2300 megawatts of power at peak periods.
At other times, when electricity is cheaper, they draw power from the grid to
pump water back up hill ready for the next surge in demand.
Hydro-Electric and two US power companies are due to submit their final offers
today, but the Scottish company will probably be outbid.
One American company has already indicated that it is willing to pay up to
#600m, but Hydro-Electric would upset the City if it went much over #450m.
``We aren't willing to overpay,'' said chief executive Roger Young. ``If
somebody else bids higher than us we will be sorry, but we will not be
unhappy.''
A partnership with British Gas to build a 730-megawatt gas-fired power station
at Avonmouth near Bristol looks more likely to get off the ground.
This project would demand #150m of investment from Hydro-Electric. A final
decision was expected within six months, but Mr Young said everything depends
on the outcome of negotiations on a gas supply contract.
Hydro-Electric has no ambition to buy a REC, unlike ScottishPower which spent
#1130m on buying Manweb.
But it is keen to develop a partnership with a REC in the electricity supply
business.
This could take the shape of a joint venture to sell power to domestic
consumers throughout England and Wales after the electricity market is fully
liberalised in 1998.
Hydro-Electric would generate and supply the power and the REC would look after
distribution.
However, this project been put on hold until takeover fever in the electricity
sector subsides.
``All the discussions we had been having are in the freezer at the moment while
the chaos among the RECs settles down,'' Mr Young said.
A more immediate prospect is the commissioning of Keadby gas-fired power
station near Scunthorpe on Humberside, a #250m joint venture with Norweb.
The 680-megawatt power station is 11 months late in coming on stream as a
result of problems with its US-made turbines, but Mr Young said it would be
finally commissioned ``in the next two or three days''.
Hydro-Electric and Norweb are seeking ``tens of millions of pounds'' of
compensation from the builder, Trafalgar House, because of this delay.
But Mr Young made clear they would settle for less than the #50m initially
claimed. An out-of-court settlement is expected with six weeks. Trafalgar House
will pass on the cost to General Electric, which manufactured the turbines.
Hydro-Electric is meanwhile close to clinching its biggest ever combined heat
and power project in England.
Mr Young said it should finalise the deal worth #25m to #30m within two months.
The project involves building a power station next to a large factory to supply
it with a cheap and reliable source of energy.
Hydro-Electric already operates several similar schemes south of the Border.
Although there is limited scope for increasing power sales to Hydro-Electric's
800,000 core customers in the north of Scotland, the volume of electricity sold
to them rose 3% in the first half of this year.
This mainly reflected a bounceback from the dip in electricity consumption
which took place after VAT was imposed on heating bills in 1994.

<TEXT>
LONDON Electricity, one of the few regional electricity companies that has not
yet been bid for, is suffering the impact of sharp tariff cuts imposed this
year by the regulator.
Pre-tax profits before exceptional items were little changed at #84.5m despite
a 2% increase in the volume of electricity delivered to customers.
But since #42.5m of exceptional charges for restructuring the company and
redeeming government debt were deducted from last year's interim profits, the
bottom line actually doubled.
London therefore felt able to increase the interim dividend by 21% to 11.5p. It
is also paying a 100p special dividend which was announced last month.
But the stock market was unimpressed and London shares fell 16p to 678p.
A fall in earnings from distribution had been expected after electricty
regulator Stephen Littlechild ordered London to cut its tariff for domestic
customers by 14% in real terms this year.
On a more positive note, London managed to trim distribution costs and boost
power sales to large businesses by 12%.
Unlike some other regional electricity companies (RECs) which are investing in
generation and other forms of diversification, London aims to stick closely to
its knitting as a distributor and supplier.
``London's primary objective is to be a low-cost provider of a high quality
electricity service to all its customers,'' chairman Sir Bob Reid said.

SOUTHERN Electric beat all profit forecasts yesterday, but it disappointed the
City with a lower-than-expected special dividend of 50p.
Southern shares fell 12p to 916p because the market had expected Southern to
match a 100p payout by Midlands Electricity earlier this month or even beat it.
The dividend news took the shine off a 19.7% increase in pre-tax profits to
#127.8m for the six months to September 30, which beat forecasts of #105m to
#121m.
Southern raised its interim dividend by 26% to 10.5p, but with gearing low at
12.2%, many felt a higher special payout could easily have been afforded.
Turnover decreased slightly to #732.7m as tariff cuts imposed by the regulator
took their toll, but the volume of electricity sold increased 1.2%.
Chairman Geoffery Wilson reiterated his support for a proposed merger with the
generator NationalPower.
NationalPower made an agreed #2800m bid for Southern in October, but this has
been on ice since the Government referred it to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission on November 23.
Mr Wilson said: ``We continue to believe that a combination of the two
companies would create a broadly-based energy business able to complete
strongly in the UK and overseas, so we will strongly support the case for it to
be allowed.''

IT was the Bundesbank's turn yesterday to deliver the goods. It cut its
discount and Lombard rates by a full half-point and its repo rate by 0.23%.
The Lombard and discount rates set the upper and lower band in the corridor of
interest rates. The repo rate, which often moves in very small steps, is the
closest to base rates in the UK.
So there is nothing in yesterday's move by the German central bank to suggest
that they were seeking to upstage the quarter-point reduction in UK rates on
Wednesday.
Chancellor Clarke had made a virtue out of cutting rates by less than many had
expected or thought necessary. He claimed that this brought Britain more into
line with Continental and North American practice and was appropriate now that
Britain was no longer a high-inflation country.
If the Federal Open Market Committee, which meets on Tuesday, decides to ease
US monetary policy it is expected that the Fed funds rates will be reduced by a
quarter point to 5.5%.
The global economy has largely recovered from the recession of the early
nineties, though Japan has lagged far behind the rest of the pack. Currently
most economies are suffering from a mid-cycle slow-down in activity.
Both Britain and the US had to raise interest rates to apply the brakes after
periods of hectic growth. They are now cutting them again in response to the
slowdown.
Germany on the other hand was late into the recession and one of the last to
recover from it. Subsequent growth never threatened to generate fresh
inflationary pressures and activity has slowed markedly, because of the
strength of the mark rather than a tightening of monetary policy.
The core Continental countries, whose currencies track the German mark, are in
the same boat as Germany. Britain too has suffered from the lacklustre economic
performance on the Continent. Export markets there have shrunk just when
domestic orders were weakening.
As a result inflationary pressures are abating more quickly than might have
been expected. The latest inflation figures suggest that the peak is close at
hand and that the Government's target of a 2.5% underlying rate by early 1997
can be achieved.
The Bank of England has been forced to change its tune in accordance with these
trends. In May it was demanding a rise in rates to fight inflation. By
September it said this was no longer necessary. This week it was happy to claim
it advised the Chancellor to cut rates.
The betting in the City is that there will be another threequarter-point
reductions in base rates in the new year. However, it is worth bearing in mind
that the last trough in UK rates was higher and the last peak lower than the
pundits expected.
Norman era
ASDA'S tearaway rise in like-for-like volume sales which on the latest figures
were over half as much again as Tesco and twice those of Safeway, only
underline the increasing polarisation of supermarkets with J Sainsbury seeing a
drop of 2.2% and the even worse 3.3% setback at Kwik Save.
That has led to a further round of profit estimate reductions for Sainsbury and
will undoubtedly increase institutional pressure on what was once the sector
darling to liven up its management.
Asda's concentration on superstores has so far been proved correct and there is
plenty of more organic growth to come. Archie Norman is talking happily of
5%-10% annual growth for the next three years. A large proportion of that would
seem assured thanks to the on-going store revival programme with only half the
portfolio so far treated.
That is more likely to provide impetus than the openings which are likely to be
around six stores a year with planning permissions ever more difficult to win.
However, the major Norman achievement is to boost the number of weekly
customers over three years from 4.2 million to 5.5 million as the brand changes
its image of fatigue and underinvestment into a much more user friendly
environment. Despite a cheaper shopping basket than the competition the
proportion of fresh produce continues to expand.
The purchase of the outstanding half stake in the Burwood House property
company from BAe may have helped put the group into debt. But with now control
over #340m of freehold, there is a substantial reserve asset available for sale
and lease back to provide cash for acquisition.
Asda is rising the crest of the wave at present and seems likely to increase
full year profits by a sixth to about #300m and maybe #340m for next year. But
then maturity may be starting to creep across the Asda horizon as the expansion
programme slows and Archie Norman could then be re-thinking his career as he
could be the new star in the new opposition party.
Canny move
SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric does not pay out special dividends like the English
regional electricity companies (RECs), which are still flush with cash, despite
the tariff cuts imposed upon them earlier this year.
But being a generator as well as a distributor, it undoubtedly has better
growth prospects than most power companies south of the Border.
Wisely, it is putting aside much of its cash to fund future expansion.
Hydro-Electric already gets 30% of its revenue from power sold outwith its
heartland in the north of Scotland.
This proportion will rise as it builds more power stations in England and Wales
and sets itself up to supply domestic consumers throughout the UK once the
market is liberalised in 1998.
It is worth noting that Hydro-Electric increased its volume sales of
electricity by 6% during the six months to September, with sales to England and
Wales soaring by 18%.
During the same period, London Electricity and Southern Electric, only boosted
volume sales by 1% to 2%. But then again, these RECs stick closely to their
home territory.
Nevertheless Hydro-Electric often finds it difficult to be taken seriously. It
is widely viewed as a small and marginal player on the northern fringes of the
UK.
This has kept its share price in check, but perhaps fortunately, it has also
kept predators at bay.
Lacking the size of ScottishPower, Hydro-Electric cannot afford to buy a REC.
Neither does it wish to.
But there is merit in its idea of teaming up with a REC in a joint venture to
exploit the liberalisation of the domestic supply market in just over two years
time. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

THERE was strong trading throughout almost all the businesses in the Securicor,
security, distribution, and communications group in the year to September 30.
This coupled with contributions from acquisitions enabled profits to climb by
23.3% to #99.4m.
Its Cellnet mobile phone subsidiary continued to make a considerable
contribution to the group with profits rising by 26% to #70.6m. Cellnet is
still outperforming its rivals in terms of growth in new subscribers and is
close to overtaking the market leader, Vodafone.
The strong growth in Cellnet's subscriber base was attributed to better
consumer tariffs and new value added business services. Although pre-Christmas
sales are not as strong as this time last year, marketing director Steve Rowley
expects to sign up another 80,000-100,000 new subscribers.
Options continue to be explored as to the future of the Cellnet business within
Securicor after the breakdown of disposal talks with BT earlier in the year.
This followed a veto by the DTI. The BT talks cost Securicor #1.2m.
Elsewhere in the group the distribution business which includes parcel
delivery, did well winning new business and increasing its profits from #9.6m
to #12.8m. The security division faced stiff home competition but expanding
overseas opportunities.
Securicor sold its UK alarms to BET in return for its manned guarding operation
Shorrock Guards. Overall, the alarms business lost #2.8m in the year.
The cash services business also faced pressure on margins although it continued
to win new business and continues to dominate the market. The rapid growth of
ATMs has provided extra business.
The custodial services business is said to have performed strongly and enjoyed
a successful year with the Metropolitan Court Escort and Custody contract in
London.
The Communications business, which includes the Datatrak vehicle tracking
system, made its first profit of #1.2m, helped by strong growth in its
subscriber base.
Business Services raised its profit by #300,000 to #3.2m. The recruitment
business benefited from the opening of new branches. Hotels continued to
perform well with high occupancy rates and the vehicle services business also
grew. It has recently formed a joint venture with Iveco Ford Truck for the
contract management of Iveco vans and trucks throughout the UK.
Heavy investment in the Securicor Group in recent years both organically and
via acquisitions has taken its toll on gearing which has risen from 18% to 60%.
The shares will continue to reflect speculation about the future of the Cellnet
stake. Yesterday Securicor shares dropped 5p to 1680p.

Print costs
bite at Mail
NEWSPRINT costs have taken their toll at the Daily Mail and General Trust,
publisher of the Daily Mail, London Evening Standard and Mail on Sunday,
although the group is looking for a return to growth in the current year.
In the year to October 1, DMGT's pre-tax profits fell from #92.1m to #80m
before exceptional items, and to #66.8m after exceptionals.
The pre-exceptionals decline reflected the substantial increase in newsprint
prices which, during most of the period, was not passed on to customers, and
increased investment in start-up operations. Nearly #20m more was spent on
newsprint than in the previous year.
However, the downward trend in profits is expected to be reversed in the
current year. As a sign of confidence the final dividend on the Ordinary and
`A' Ordinary shares has been lifted from 12.5p to 13.5p taking the total from
16.5p to 17.8p.
M&amp;G holds profits
INVESTMENT management group, M&amp;G has managed to hold profits in spite of a
difficult trading climate and continuing short-term uncertainty.
In the year to September profits before exceptional items came to #61.2m in the
year to September, almost exactly unchanged on 1993-94. Dividends are raised by
7% to 32p after a final of 18p.
Group revenue was marginally ahead at #78m, with a #6.3m fall in initial
charges offset by a #7.2m rise in annual fees.
M&amp;G is confident for the long-term investment outlook despite short-term
uncertainties such as the forthcoming general election. The shares slipped 8p
to 1270p, where they yield 3.1%.
Medeva post
MEDEVA, the international pharmaceutical company, has announced that Garry
Watts is to be its new finance director. Mr Watts, a partner in the accountancy
firm KPMG and head of its Health and Life Sciences practice, will join the
Medeva board on February 1. His appointment follows the departure of Dennis
Millard to join Cookson Group.
Shire floats
SHIRE Pharmaceuticals, a company specialising in the marketing, licensing and
development of prescription medicines primarily for age-related diseases of the
bone and central nervous system, is planning to float on the London Stock
Exchange. Founded in 1986, Shire concentrates on the prevention and treatment
of diseases such as Osteoporosis and Alzheimer's. A placing of the shares with
institutional investors is planned. Panmure Gordon is acting as sponsor and
stockbroker to the company.
Good start
FOOD products group Albert Fisher says it has made a satisfactory start to its
current financial year in most of its businesses despite challenging market
conditions. Speaking at the company's annual meeting, chairman Stephen Walls
said that there were clear growth opportunities in many of the company's
markets.
Widows sells
SCOTTISH Widows has sold a portfolio of eight freehold commercial properties to
Burford Holdings for #48.7m. The reversionary portfolio generates a net annual
rental income of around #3.4m and within two years the yield will increase from
7% to 8%. The major property is a building in London's Covent Garden and the
package includes office space in London and large stores in various cities.

A FAST-TRACK procedure is to be introduced to try and cut the growing backlog
of court applications for disqualification of insolvent company directors who
are considered unfit to manage.
Richard Scott, the High Court judge who announced the move yesterday, urged
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang to consider introducing an amendment to
the law, making a court hearing unnecessary when a director does not dispute
being barred for an agreed period sufficient to protect the public interest.
At present, the DTI or the Official Receiver is required under the 1986 Company
Directors' Disqualification Act to apply to the court for a disqualification

TONY Baldry, UK Minister of State for Agriculture, has given the National Sheep
Association an assurance that he will do everything possible to safeguard the
needs of the sheep industry and the auction market system when new legislation
on the transport of animals is being framed.
The National Sheep Association has asked the Minister to ensure that the new
directive proposed by Brussels should be interpreted in such a way as to
protect the UK sheep industry and traditional trading patterns, using the live
auction system.
In a meeting with the Minister, Joe Stoddart, NSA president, pointed out that
the natural, extensive system in the UK was geared to grass production. The
earliest grass production was in the south and the growth pattern moved north
and from low ground to hill.
The lamb production pattern followed that same cycle, providing a flow of lambs
to abattoirs which started in the south early in the year and moved north.
``Good, efficient, welfare-friendly transport is therefore an essential
ingredient of our business,'' he said.
In Scotland the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers has also been
expressing its concerns about the possible impact of new transport regulations.

Sheila Waddell reports on a scheme   which allows young people and companies to
work together to create worthwhile jobs
SCOTLAND's prosperity depends on the ability of companies to compete in world
markets. If they are to do so effectively, they must have access to a well
trained workforce. The Skillseekers Initiative addresses this challenge
directly by aiming to provide employers with the trained workers they require.
A development of its predecessor, the Youth Training Programme, Skillseekers
give both young people and employers a real say in the training involved, as
both parties sit down together and draw up a training plan which sets targets
to match the requirements of the workplace. It gives young people the
opportunity to train for their desired career and ensures that they receive
training towards vocational qualifications.
The Skillseekers Initiative was originally launched in Grampian Region in 1991.
Glasgow Skillseekers, developed by Glasgow Development Agency, started in April
1994. Around 3700 young people from Glasgow are currently participating in the
Skillseekers Initiative.
A glance through the latest Skillseekers training directory shows there is a
well established network of training suppliers in a broad range of fields.
These range from business administration, where young people can train to be
secretaries and receptionists, through artistic fields where there are training
opportunities for those interested in photography, graphic design and
floristry, to engineering occupations.
There are also several well known employers like Yarrow Shipbuilders, Weir
Pumps and the Royal Mail who have recognised the benefits and are now actively
involved in Skillseekers and contract directly with the GDA.
Skillseekers offers a range of benefits to employers:
lTraining is more clearly related to the needs of the workplace.
lThe opportunity to offer quality training to a recognised national industry
standard which will help employers to achieve more flexibility, greater
efficiency and increased productivity.
lYoung people who are recruited will be clear about their career choice. They
will therefore be motivated to succeed, accept responsibility and contribute to
company success.
lA direct contribution toward the cost of training young employees.
Willie Fortucci, Director of Training within Glasgow Development Agency, said:
``The success of any company depends largely on the quality and commitment of
its staff. Having a motivated workforce is a vital asset in today's business
climate. Skillseekers enables companies to recruit and develop their employees
to ensure a competitive advantage.''
All Skillseekers will work towards the achievement of vocational qualifications
(VQs) which prove that they can carry out an employer's work to recognised
Iidustry standards. VQs are designed for industry by industry, to standards set
by Lead Bodies and Industrial Training Organisations such as the Engineering
Training Authority, the Hotel and Catering Training Company and the
Construction Industry Training Board.
Skillseekers gives the employer the option of having greater control over the
management and delivery of training. As Shirley Davison, Skillseeker's
Development Executive, said: ``Employers can become involved in Skillseekers in
a number of ways. They can have a direct contract with the Glasgow Development
Agency either as an approved centre, delivering the training themselves, or by
sub contracting elements of the training. A third alternative is to appoint a
training supplier to deliver and manage the training on their behalf.
``Our Skillseekers employer team, based within the Training Directorate, can
advise on which route is best suited to meet the needs of the company.''
Where a company has opted for the direct contract route - funding, which is
reviewed annually, is based on the type of job and the level of vocational
qualifications being sought. For each Skillseeker the funding for employers
will range from #4200 and #8000 and is released when training outcomes have
been achieved.
All 16-18-year-olds leaving full time education and resident within the city of
Glasgow are eligible for Skillseekers. In addition, any of Glasgow's
16-18-year-olds who are employed but not currently working towards the
achievement of a recognised Vocational Qualification are eligible, provided an
appropriate VQ is available.
All sewn up:  Andrina Bisset, of Claremont Garments, and Joanne Adams show the
programme is tuned to employers' needs

IN today's rapidly changing world it has become increasingly important to train
people and provide them with the skills to enable them to compete and perform
at the highest level.
Both the CBI report Towards a Skills Revolution and the TUC report Skills 2000
advocated the introduction of credits for young people and led to the launch of
the Government Training Credits initiative in March 1990. This recruitment and
training initiative aimed to promote lifelong learning and provide a sound
basis for progression into employment.
Glasgow Skillseekers was developed from the credits initiative and offers an
alternative route to employment through training for young people aged 16-18.
The initiative is designed to use increased involvement of employers in the
training process to support the recruitment of young people as they enter the
labour market.
A key feature of Skillseekers is empowering young people by giving them the
support and spending power to purchase training relevant to their needs. The
main aim of the initiative is to enable young people to realise their full
potential through training and development which will increase the level and
volume of skills achieved.
Skillseekers also aims to maximise ``jobs with training'' opportunities through
the increased commitment of employers, while developing a more flexible and
responsive training market, reflecting the demands of both young people and
employers.
All young people are involved in action planning prior to leaving school. This
encourages them to assess their progress, be aware of opportunities, identify
career aims and set themselves targets to enable them to achieve their goals.
Before young people leave school they receive a vocational guidance interview
with a careers officer.
They are then issued with a Skillseekers Information Pack which includes their
personal card. This allows them to purchase approved training from employers,
colleges or training suppliers participating in Glasgow Skillseekers.
Once in employment, or training, the Skillseeker then agrees a training plan
with an employer or training supplier. This details the agreed route to
vocational qualifications, appropriate milestones (when particular skills,
competencies or targets are to be achieved) and any support required.
As each milestone is reached, young people use their Skillseekers Card to
authorise payment to the relative party for training they have received, as
detailed in their Individual Training Plan.

THE opening of Office 1 in Glasgow brings to the city one of the first
superstores of its kind, one that is dedicated to supplying all the
requirements that are demanded of the modern office. Located at 30 Finnieston
Street, at St Vincent Street, the superstore has ample off-street parking and
is within a two-minute walk of the Exhibition Centre Station.
Under the one roof, its massive 20,000 sq ft of floorspace allows the company
to display its stock in an attractive and pleasing manner. More than 5000 items
are carried, and everything from ballpoint pens to bookcases and sharpeners to
shredders can be viewed and compared.
The first Office 1 was opened in Bristol and this was followed by three others
in England. Glasgow is the fifth superstore to be opened by the group, which is
a sister company of Ofrex, which in turn comes under the umbrella of French
company, Guilbert.
Jim Duffy is manager of the new store and he outlines the company's philosophy:
``The company guarantees to offer the lowest prices. This means that if a
customer finds something that has been purchased from Office 1 at a lower price
elsewhere, and within 14 days, we will refund the difference.''
Office 1 is certainly far removed from the generally perceived idea of an
office stationery store. Everything that is part of the office is on display.
And computers, which have been a feature of the office for many years, have a
special section. Leading makes are on display, as are a large range of
associated accessories, and all at significantly reduced prices.
The store may be viewed in four main sections: stationery, printing/copying,
office furniture and technical section. There is also a small janitorial area
within the store which offers the basic requirements of the office/kitchen.
In the breakneck speed of the modern world, when orders placed are often of an
urgent nature, required immediately, Office 1 has a service that should appeal
to the local business community.
Orders placed before 1pm that are in excess of #30 enjoy a same day delivery
provided they are within G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 postcode areas. Similarly, orders
placed with Office 1 that are in excess of #30 have free next day delivery
anywhere in Scotland.
But there is much more to Office 1, as Mr Duffy explains: ``We offer our
customers a complete printing, copying, laminating and binding service. And
where required, we can send or receive faxes. Compared with our competitors our
aim is to offer a higher level of customer service.''
Loyalty is also rewarded and customers earn points when they make purchases.
Eventually the points are converted into vouchers that can be used in leading
stores.
For the out-of-town customer who is unable to visit the store, a catalogue is
available that shows a fair percentage of what the company has to offer. One
telephone call with your order and if it is more than #30 in value, the goods
will be with you the following day and at no extra charge.
Keen to provide quality service, the company is open to suggestions from its
customers, and in place around the store are suggestion slips which may help
the management identify areas where local needs have not been fully met.
Staff have been undergoing training for three weeks, an area which store
manager Jim Duffy recognises as being vital to a smooth and efficient
operation. ``It is important that our 30 staff are conversant with the stock,
and training is very much an on-going operation. Some training has also been
carried out by suppliers such as Canon who familiarise staff with their
products.''
Office 1 seems certain to revolutionise the office supply market in Scotland,
especially when savings of up to 65% on the normal retail price can be made.
And although the store will be a boom to business, it will also be a wonderland
for the public who, when faced with what masking tape to buy, will be
confronted with six options.
Perhaps it is best left to Mr Duffy to sum up: ``Our motto is that we are first
for savings, selection and service. Visit us and I'm sure you will agree.''

BUT for the French transport strikes which caused the event to be abandoned,
two Scottish world champions would have been in Monaco to receive their
trophies and the plaudits of the international motor-sport community......
While Colin McRae is the new world champion rally driver, his Glasgow-based
team-mate Derek Ringer won the FIA World Championship for Co-drivers. The two
titles do not always go in tandem, but the McRae/ Ringer partnership, seen for
the first time on the 1986 Jim Clark Memorial Rally, has been one of the most
consistent - and most exciting - in the world during the Nineties.
Derek Ringer became involved in motor-sport purely as a hobby, as a student in
the Seventies, and then as an engineer with Ferranti. He had absolutely no
thought of making it his profession. A few years later, he teamed up with
McRae, who had already competed in the West of Scotland autotest championship
when he was too young to have a licence to drive himself to the events.
In 1987 they won their class in the British national championship, and the
following year won the Scottish championship outright, as well as taking class
wins in the British national and British open series. Their cars included a
partly works-supported Peugeot 309, a Vauxhall Nova, a Ford Sierra Cosworth,
and a Nissan 240RS. McRae was already seen as very much a ``coming man''.
The next two seasons were with Ford, rallying Sierra Cosworths in the UK as
well as in Belgium, Sweden and New Zealand. In November 1990 they were sixth on
the RAC Rally, but Ford dispensed with their services for the following year.
As a result, 1991 was fairly bleak; but then they signed for the official
Subaru team run by Prodrive of Banbury.
Looking back now, Derek Ringer appreciates how Prodrive put them through a
``well structured apprenticeship'' for the really big time. Their 1994 season
culminated in a win on the RAC Rally, and this year's repeat victory won them
the world championship - or, rather, a world championship apiece.
After the RAC Rally, Ringer headed off, without McRae, for Subaru testing in
Kenya in advance of next year's Safari Rally. Soon there will be promotional
work in England and the Far East, then testing for the Swedish, followed by
official practice for that opening round of the 1996 championship in February.
Practice sessions may involve 14 hours per day in the car.
Altogether, he is pretty busy, expecting to be away from home for perhaps 200
days this year. His suggestion that ``the further up you are in this sport, the
less you actually know what's going on'' simply confirms that self-promotion is
not a priorit y for either member of the McRae/Ringer crew.
There are nine rounds in the 1996 world championship, which is a logistical
nightmare. In order, the events are held in Sweden, Kenya, Indonesia, Greece,
Argentina, Finland, Australia, Italy, and Spain.
No RAC Rally. That is not a full-scale championship event in 1996. But Prodrive
may go for the RAC hat-trick with Colin McRae and Derek Ringer, two of that
rare breed - Scottish champions of the world.

ANY Subaru customer who asked for an exact replica of Colin McRae's
fire-breathing RAC Rally-winning car would be pole-axed by the Ferrari-like
price demanded. Actually, there is not the remotest chance of an ordinary
customer being sold a brand new World Rally Championship car of any make.
However, the showroom Turbo 2000, best-seller of the Impreza range, is a
remarkably potent machine at #17,998 for the four-door and #18,499 for the
five-door. Subaru also offers an extra-cost ``Series McRae'' version, with
improvements to paintwork, interior equipment, wheels and tyres.
Looking out over a vast bonnet-top air intake, the driver controls an all-alloy
flat-four engine, complete with turbocharger and intercooler, which peaks at
208bhp. Turbo-charged engines should always be left to idle before being
switched off following a bout of hard driving, and the Subaru is one car which
displays a sticker advising this.
Despite the flat sounding beat of the engine, and the fact that it catches
light only as it approaches 3000rpm, the Impreza Turbo sprints to 60mph in an
astonishing 6.5 seconds. It will go on to a test track maximum over 140mph, but
the really impressive feature is the slingshot rolling acceleration.
Four-wheel drive comes as standard. The road car is quiet and biddable. It may
not be much of a looker, but it has the advantage of being, in contrast with
many high performers, a full-size four-adult saloon.

Best-seller of the current Ferrari range: the F355 for the enthusiast who can
spare at least #88,965
q.IF keener interest in high-performance cars is one sign of a more optimistic
economic outlook, it must be good news that Ferrari has come back to the West
of Scotland. Glenvarigill in Bearsden has been appointed the franchise-holder,
as it is in Edinburgh.
Ferraris have been officially imported since 1960. There are more than 4000 on
British roads, and 275 cars are likely to have been sold in the UK once the
1995 tally is complete.
Best-seller is the 375bhp F355, with Berlinetta, Spider or GTS-style bodywork
at prices from #88,965. These striking cars - using classic 90-degree V8 power
units, complete with four overhead camshafts, five valves per cylinder and a
mid-engined location - account for two-thirds of all Ferrari sales here.
The 456 is a V12 5.4-litre front-engined two-plus-two coupe which increases the
power play to 436bhp. Ferrari has always been keen on GT as well as out-and-out
sports cars, and the lavish specification helps to explain the #156,445 price.
Ultimate expression of Ferrari's commitment to ultra-high performance is the
F50. This 4.7-litre V12 supercar peaks at 520bhp.
While its #329,000 showroom price looks stratospheric, it is worth remembering
that Ferrari is in the performance car business for the long haul. The F50 has
rivals costing up to almost twice as much, but would you put money on their
survival till the turn of the century?
You can be sure that Ferrari will plug steadily on.

TO ASSIST readers in navigating the increasingly murky world of Westminster
politics, today's Sketch is pleased to offer, free of charge, our exclusive
guff-and-rhubarb translation service, which turns an MP's partisan question and
a Minister's predictable reply into what they really meant to say.
Mr Major is in Madrid for the Euro-summit and so left yesterday's Prime
Minister's Questions to Mr Michael Heseltine. The First Secretary of State's
current obsession is exposing Labour spin doctors, a breed he has compared to
child molesters, Nazis and Rangers football fans. (Actually he hasn't - he
merely said they were the greatest propaganda machine in British history - but
he would if he could).
Mrs Ann Taylor, deputy-deputy to Mr Tony Blair in the absence of Mr John
Prescott, took railway privatisation as her theme. She asked Mr Heseltine to
confirm privatisation will cost the public #850m a year.
An indignant Mr Heseltine said this was ``absolute rubbish'', an oft-used
Government phrase meaning ``we know, don't remind us''. The figures, published
by Labour yesterday, are drawn from Government sources.
Mr John Townend, a right-wing Tory MP, asked Mr Heseltine if the troubles of
the French were not in fact the result of their pursuit of European monetary
union. What subtitles above the Chamber would have shown was: ``the frogs are
really squirming; don't ya love it?''
First to raise events in Brixton was local Labour MP Keith Hill, who asked a
long, long question in which he outlined his sense of shock at the ``wanton
destruction and looting.''
Unrest in ethnic neighbourhoods is a tricky subject for both parties. Mr
Hill's question was, legitimately, a way of saying Labour is as resolute as the
Tories in condemning mischief.
Mr Heseltine was generous in sharing Mr Hill's condemnation and in praising
Vauxhall MP Kate Hoey (Lab.) for ``eloquently'' condeming the violence. But
there was a whiff of something else on the Tory back benches, almost an
unspeakable desire to say something that might produce a return from those
voters easily alarmed by bad news from ethnic neighbourhoods.
The moment passed and instead we turned to an increasingly popular theme for
Tory back benchers with little to do: the Union. Mr Peter Luff, Tory for
Worcester, asked Mr Heseltine to confirm that neither he nor Mr Major would
threaten the Union by introducing a Scottish parliament.
He asked; ``If you ever were tempted to such an idea, can you confirm that you
certainly wouldn't think of giving it tax-raising powers and then trying to
deceive the Scottish and British people into believing you wouldn't actually
use those powers?''
What this really meant was: ``I've just noticed that devolution seems to be a
hot issue. The whips have kindly provided me with a question to ask. Aren't I
clever?'' Mr Heseltine trotted out the usual Tory rah-rah about a tartan tax,
but it was what he wasn't saying that mattered: ``keep those questions coming,
it's the only thing we have to hurt them with''.

n.SCOTLAND'S first ``upward appraisal'' management award has been jointly won
by Gordon Brown of the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department and
Peter Finnie of the National Savings Bank.
The aim of the Prime Award was to find the country's best managers - in the
opinion of their staff. Aware of the potential value of upward appraisal to
Scottish management, the leading training organisation Eglington Management
Centre agreed to sponsor the award contest, launched in September. Six hundred
applications were received and five finalists selected by the judging panel
chaired by Peter Casebow of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The result was announced at a dinner in Edinburgh last week by Margaret Ford,
managing director of Eglington Management Centre, who said: ``The award is
important because it comes from the judges who really matter - the staff.
``The winners show that, despite all the management theory and jargon, what
counts is motivation, support and loyalty, good communication and clear
direction-management characteristics which never go out of fashion."
Brown's team of 16 in the Agricultural and Fisheries Department felt he was an
obvious choice because of the way he motivates - he is a good listener who
takes a genuine interest in them. Finnie, head of Finance and Faculties
Management at the National Savings Bank Cowglen, Glasgow is responsible for a
team of 200. His staff find him approachable and a good listener with a desire
to respond to suggestions.
They were presented with rose bowls and #15,000 of personal development and
team development training.

THE Scottish Claymores found it tough going in their inaugural World League
season, with only two wins from 10 matches. But yesterday their new general
manager, former Dallas Cowboy Mike Keller, outlined his vision to bring
gridiron success to Scotland next year.
His plans include a reduction in ticket prices, an improved team and coaching
staff, a move to involve the west coast, and a visit from National Football
League commissioner Paul Tagliabue early next year.
Keller, general manager of Sacramento Surge when they won the World Bowl in
1992, took over the Claymores after Sandy Waters returned to the USA during the
summer. Keller, who has a dynamic approach to marketing, said: ``We are putting
together a blueprint for success. I can't guarantee the World Bowl, but we'll
be in much better shape to challenge for the championship than last year. I can
promise a better job will be done.''
Ticket prices for unreserved seats are down from #20 and #15 to #10, and Keller
expects to see 15,000 fans at each home game.
He also announced a deal with Glasgow's Central Hotel being used as a base for
players and coaches, who will train at Stepps playing fields next term.
Keller hopes to give the Claymores a higher profile in the west but he added
that the team's offices would remain in Edinburgh, with the addition of a
merchandise and ticket sales shop, which will open in George Street on January
15.

KEVIN McKenzie could hardly have a more demanding return to senior rugby than
he has at Goldenacre tomorrow. Even without a senior game for more than two
months, he has been pitched straight into leading Stirling County in their bid
to beat Heriot's by at least 43 points and, thus, retain Scottish rugby's club
championship.
Injury has kept McKenzie out of action since October 7, but postponement of the
Goldenacre match has allowed him to have a hand in the championship finale.
Stirling need to win well if they are to overtake Melrose and win the
Premiership on points difference. To win by 42 points would force a play-off
with the Borderers, anything less would leave Melrose as champions for the
fifth time in seven years.
As one internationalist returns for Stirling, another drops out. John Manson
has been ruled out because he was sent off while playing for North and Midlands
against the South at Kelso on Sunday. But Stirling can still field a team
comprising 15 players who have appeared in district rugby and higher - Manson's
place goes to John Gibson, Glasgow's loose head.
Injuries have ruled out three of Heriot's representative players. Hugh Gilmour
has a stress fracture, Gordon Lawrie has bother with a spinal disc, and captain
Stuart Paul has a poisoned leg. In addition, Teri Rahui has gone home to New
Zealand - Cameron Glasgow switches to stand-off in place of the Kiwi.
Yet Heriot's have a potential trump card in their much recast back division as
Elliot Bunney, sprinter of repute, will make his league debut on the left wing.
GHK, who lost to Glasgow Southern last week in one of the few games played in
the new regional league's first series, have called on Nicky Barrett and Lyall
Gibb from Glasgow's under-19 squad as a new half-back pairing for the Old
Anniesland contest with Ayr. Graeme Ferguson will be in direct opposition to
Barrett as the visitors' stand-off.
Kilmarnock, with a home match against Glasgow Southern, have lost Malcolm Logan
for a couple of months for professional reasons. The flanker has found that,
despite the fare to fly halfway round the world, it is profitable to take on a
contract in sheep-shearing in New Zealand.
While Melrose await news from Goldenacre, they will play Selkirk at the
Greenyards. Their pack, denuded by district calls and other reasons, includes a
newcomer from Australia, Michael Doonan, a Manly flanker who has been in the
Borders since October.
q THE SRU is to call a series of meetings to debate the implications of the
recent decision to back District sides in the European Cup.
The leading clubs favouring club participation in Europe have said they will
meet early in the New Year and they have not yet discounted the possibility of
mounting an official challenge to the SRU blueprint which would mean an
extraodrinary general meeting of the Union.

THE Pantoland employment statistics show it has been a very good year for
Cinderellas, with a corresponding increase in demand for qualified Buttons and
Ugly Sisters, writes FRANCIS SHENNAN. They have been recruited for Aberdeen's
Arts Centre, Ayr's Gaiety Theatre, Dundee's Repertory Theatre, Edinburgh's
King's Theatre, and Perth Theatre.
There is also strong demand for Babes in the Wood, sometimes with a related
recruitment drive for Robin Hoods. The Babes' jobs boost has come from the
King's Theatre, Glasgow, Magnum Theatre, Irvine, the Arts Centre, Paisley, and
the Civic Theatre, Motherwell, where additional language skills may be needed
to judge from the title Weans in the Wood.
There are some employment prospects still for Sleeping Beauties, along with
wicked witches and charming princes, most notably in the Adam Smith Theatre,
Kirkcaldy, Palace Theatre, Kilmarnock, and Brunton Hall, Musselburgh.
Central Scotland remains an unemployment blackspot for Jacks, cows and giants,
with only the Eden Court Theatre, Inverness, recruiting them this year. Dick
Whittingtons and cats are having a bad year of it outside the Arts Guild,
Greenock. Snow Queens and Pinocchios, too, are in low demand outside of
Stirling's MacRobert Arts Centre (in the case of the former) and the Citizens'
Theatre, Glasgow (the latter).
In fact, if you have reached December 15 without any offers from Pantoland,
it's probably time to start trying for a summer season somewhere.

MOTORSPORT:
IF you heed omens, then a most significant one was there to be observed
yesterday, when Scottish driver Ewan Fraser took to the Donington Park track.
The 24-year-old Edinburgh man's mentor is Jackie Stewart, and like the former
Formula One champion, Fraser has arrived behind the wheel after first making a
sporting impact with his finger on the trigger of a gun.
Like Stewart before him, Fraser was Scottish national trap shooting champion in
1991 and competed internationally.
Stewart, who began shooting at 14, won the Cup de Nations in 1959 and '60 and
was reserve for the Rome Olympics that year. He did not make his first
breakthrough as a driver until three years later.
Stewart had no thoughts of projecting Fraser into the world of motor sport when
he hired him as an instructor for his Gleneagles shooting school. But Fraser,
who had worked for his father as a garage mechanic and had maintained rally
cars for customers, soon became infused with Stewart's enthusiasm.
Last year, Fraser won the Vauxhall Young Driver of the Year competition, and
yesterday he took out a Formula Vauxhall machine for the first time, with
Stewart advising him. ``Many of the factors in shooting - co-ordination, speed
of reaction, the ability to maintain concentration - are common to the two
sports,'' said three-times world grand prix champion Stewart.
For him, shooting was much more than just the first step on the sporting
highway. Dismissed academically because of what was later to be diagnosed as
dyslexia, Stewart left school early to man the pumps at the family garage in
Dumbarton.
``In shooting I was provided with something at which I could excel,'' said
Stewart, who went on to win the UK, Scottish, Irish, Welsh and English trap
titles.
``Those years were important for the formation of my thinking processes in
dealing with competition, with success and with failure. It provided the
foundation for a beginning in motor racing.''
Stewart was 24 when he made his driving breakthrough, in 1963, joining Ecurie
Ecosse. More than three decades on, Fraser, also aged 24, has turned the clock
back.

COLIN Chapman's original Lotus Elite, which went on the market in 1958,
combined very attractive lines with brilliant handling and remarkably good
performance from a Coventry-Climax engine of only 1216cc. Lotus built fewer
than 1100 examples, and something like 650 are still on the road.
Ian Scott Watson was an early customer, and it was one of his Elites which gave
Jim Clark his first-ever Lotus drive at Brands Hatch. Clark also raced an Elite
at Le Mans, where Lotus outpaced the 1300cc opposition six years in succession,
as well as winning his class in home-ground events at Bo'ness, Winfield, and
Charterhall.
One of Club Elite's Scottish members is Bill Hope, who has owned a 1960 example
for the last 13 years. He has records of the eight previous owners. Somewhere
along the line it may have done some racing, because at one time it was fitted
with twin Weber carburetters and a high-lift camshaft, although now it runs on
twin SUs.
Bill Hope saw his first Elite years ago, in a garage in Fife, and thought it
was ``absolutely marvellous''. Now that he drives one of his own, he
understands its reputation as a racing car for the road.
The light construction, with glassfibre body, means that there is a healthy
power-to-weight ratio despite the engine's modest size. With the high-lift cam,
the power comes in about 4000rpm - ``and it really rips after that''. But the
great attraction of the Elite is its handling, always a Lotus speciality.
Bill Hope's car is still the subject of an on-going restoration which has been
under way since 1982. The engine has needed liners and big-end bearings, but
little else in the way of replacements. He tackled the bodywork by spending a
couple of hours every night for two weeks, stripping down the glassfibre with a
one-inch chisel. Now the finish is excellent.
This is a car seen at events in many parts of Scotland. During the past year it
has taken part in rallies at Biggar, Stonehaven, Forres, Leven, Dalmeny House,
and elsewhere.
Until now it has been off the road in winter, but with the recent Budget
dispensation abolishing road tax for cars more than 25 years old, it may be out
and about in all weathers.
Focus on the Lotus that's
`a racing car for the road'

THE West Indies go into today's opening match of a one-day tournament against
Sri Lanka and Australia diverted by the turmoil surrounding star batsman Brian
Lara and beset by poor form.
Lara dropped out of the Australian tour after being fined for misconduct during
this year's England Test series, and the West Indies face the Sri Lankans in
Adelaide after Tuesday's humiliating one-day defeat by Australia's Cricket
Academy, who routed them for 92.
Australia, who begin their defence of the World Series title against West
Indies in Adelaide on Sunday, have dropped 34-year-old batsman David Boon for
their first three fixtures. The gritty right-hander is likely to be replaced by
Michael Bevan.
Meanwhile Boon made a confident start for Tasmania on the second day of their
Sheffield Shield match in Melbourne yesterday.
After Dean Jones had declared the Victoria innings on 430 for six, Tasmania
were 171 for one, with opener Jamie Cox not out on 75 and Boon on 23. Opener
Dene Hills made 54 in a stand of 124.

Who are
what? you
ask. The
pantomime
producers
are major
employers
of talent
at this
time of
year, says
Francis
Shennan
SETTLE down now, boys and girls, because this week we are going to talk about
pantomimes which are major employers of talent at this time of year. It's hard
to imagine such occasions of broad-humoured slapstick as serious business-but
they are, aren't they, boys and girls?
The box-office returns from British pantomimes are more than #10m, with the
biggest shows taking more than #1m each. Much of this will pay wages which can
range from #10,000 a week for top-line celebrities to #250 a week for a dancer.
A typical production will travel around different cities for seven years. By
the time different casts have been assembled, though, and new headline stars
booked, the shows manage to appear fresh and new...... but not too new. Even
so, the production cost for a new panto is around #350,000, with the music
score alone costing perhaps #5,000.
Audiences want all the traditional ingredients, in the same way that they do
not like their traditional Christmas dinner to be tampered with, although
certain liberties are tolerated.
Comedy stars Cannon and Ball are teaming up with Scottish veteran Jimmy Logan
for The Adventures of Robin Hood and the Babes in the Wood at the King's
Theatre in Glasgow. It is a traditional combining of storylines which were once
completely separate.
The storylines and the jokes will certainly be recycled, but they are always
dusted down and given a fresh coat of glitter. Recent news stories will be
quarried to give a topical flavour. What are the odds on Princess Diana's
Panorama interview cropping up?
For all that, it takes a year to plan a top panto and for a few people it is an
all-year-round business. On one industrial estate in Lincolnshire eight
carpenters are employed full-time building sets, and five seamstresses work all
year to stitch 15,000 costumes.
Despite the continuing popularity of panto it took the sponsorship business a
while to get in on the act - at least in modern times (in fact the first car to
appear on stage was as Cinderella's coach at Drury Lane in 1895, when it was
one of only 15 cars in Britain).
Cadbury's was the first major company to understand the potential for
nationwide sponsorship. Last year its panto sponsorship around the country
involved providing 250,000 chocolate bars for the dames to throw into the
audience.
This year the Scottish confectionery company Lee's, along with Clyde 2, is
sponsoring Aladdin at Glasgow's Pavilion which stars The Krankies. Forth FM is
sponsoring Cinderella at the King's in Edinburgh, which stars Jonathan Watson
as The Baron.
Even more conventional theatre companies offer seasonal fare. The Royal Lyceum
Theatre Company is presenting Merlin the Magnificent. Scottish Ballet's
seasonal production this year is Peter Pan, and next month Northern Ballet
brings A Christmas Carol to Edinburgh's Festival Theatre.
The reason, of course, is that the Christmas season is a prime market. Income
generated now will help to finance productions during the rest of the year. The
value of theatre and the performing arts to employment tends to be dismissed.
However, Glasgow City Council's Department of Performing Arts and Venues
recently published the Cultural Statistics Framework which attempted to
quantify this value. It reported annual attendances of 1.3m for the performing
arts, and that excluded popular music events.
The cultural sector as a whole employs 9000 directly and probably as many again
indirectly.
The total annual value of the sector in Glasgow alone was put at #420m and, as
a percentage of employment in the economy as a whole, was put at between 2.7%
and 2.9% for 1993. The Christmas panto season is a boom time for jobs. And for
theatrical agents it is a dream period with any name that has any celebrity
attaching to it being crammed into the cast list. The Pavilion's Aladdin has
Linda Nolan, formerly of the Nolan Sisters, in the title role, Mike Hayward who
plays Allun Morgan in Scottish Television's Take The High Road as Abanazer, and
Eunice Huthart.
And who? She is billed as the People's Champion from the Saturday evening TV
contest Gladiators, which apparently qualifies her to play the Genie of the
Ring.
Panto has disproved Andy Warhol's assertion that ``one day everyone will be
famous for 15 minutes''. At Christmas in Britain, you can be famous for seven
weeks.

CHAMPIONS Menzieshill may be without captain Johnny Christie for the final
phase of the men's indoor championship tomorrow at the Bell's Sports Centre,
Perth. The internationalist has a broken right hand and could miss the club's
remaining five matches.
Christie's prospects will depend largely on his powers of persuasion when he
reports to hospital today, hoping that the plaster will be removed.
Menzieshill's problems could boost arch-rivals MIM, who lost 5-1 when they last
met, with Christie scoring four.
Examinations rule Richard Forsyth out of Indespension Western's first two
games, while Touche Ross Gordonians' captain Richard Freeland is still
recovering after having been knocked down last weekend.
q.ANDREW Scoular, coach to the Scottish women's indoor squad, has lost another
key player, Gill Messenger, for the finals of the European Nations Cup at
Glasgow's Kelvin Hall from January 26 to 28.
Her withdrawal, because of mental and physical exhaustion, comes on the heels
of Great Britain star Pauline Robertson, who wants to concentrate on the
Atlanta Olympics.
The absence of this pair will damage Scotland's prospects of a medal, and so
the team's visit to Vienna for the Arminen tournament from January 5 to 7 will
become even more significant in Scoular's build-up plans for the Kelvin Hall.
Messenger, meanwhile, will play for Edinburgh Ladies in their league match
tomorrow at Perth against Clydesdale.

PETER Martin made a sparkling return to Test cricket in Durban before bad
weather took just a little of the shine off England's day at Kingsmead.
Lancashire fast bowler Martin grabbed three wickets to leave South Africa
reeling on 89 for five.
But then a stubborn stand of 50 between Jonty Rhodes and Brian McMillan -
followed by bad light - prevented England from strengthening their position
still further.
When play was interrupted 10 minutes after tea, the home side had steadied to
reach 139 for five. But that scoreline still represented a real triumph for the
tourists - and Martin especially.
He shared the early third Test honours with another comeback bowler - spinner
Richard Illingworth - after England had put out an attack barely recognisable
from that fielded in Johannesburg a fortnight ago.
Martin, whose last Test appearance came midway through the summer series
against West Indies, began badly yesterday morning when 17 runs were taken off
his first two overs.
But he responded admirably to dismiss Gary Kirsten (8), Daryll Cullinan (10),
and debut-maker Jacques Kallis (1) as South Africa wasted a solid 54-run
opening stand.
With Angus Fraser and Devon Malcolm both omitted and hamstring injury victim
Darren Gough on the sidelines, England retained only Dominic Cork from their
second Test bowling line-up.
For 78 minutes, there was little reason to suggest the policy might work.
Neither Cork nor Mark Ilott - back on international duty after a 28-month
absence - could shift South Africa's opening pair with the new ball as Andrew
Hudson threatened to put together a substantial score on a good-looking batting
pitch.
When Martin replaced Ilott, Hudson crashed his fourth, fifth, sixth, and
seventh deliveries through the covers. Two expensive overs from the big
Lancashire paceman left captain Mike Atherton no option but to remove his
county colleague from the attack.
Illingworth, however, provided the control England needed - beginning a superb
22-over spell spanning almost three hours which deserved even better figures
than the two for 33 he walked away with.
It was Martin, though, who produced the breakthrough which Atherton desperately
needed when brought back at the other end.
Kirsten, having contributed just eight to the half-century stand, tried to cut
a ball too close to him during Martin's second over back - and succeeded only
in edging a shoulder-high chance which Graeme Hick made look comfortable at
second slip.
Eight deliveries later, Illingworth's economy was rewarded as Hudson, whose 45
included nine boundaries, thrust forward a pad which the ball obligingly ran
up, brushed a glove, and landed gently in John Crawley's hands at silly point.
From 54 for nought, South Africa were wobbling at 56 for two, and 17 runs later
- with lunch only 10 minutes away - home skipper Hansie Cronje (8) rashly moved
down the pitch at Illingworth, dragging his attempted straight drive to Martin
at mid-on.
England refused to let their advantage slip after the interval. Illingworth,
who conceded just 13 runs from his first 14 overs, tied up one end while Martin
took advantage at the other.
Cullinan, bogged down, launched himself at a loose delivery, failed to get on
top of the shot, and drilled his cover drive into Robin Smith's hands.
Just nine deliveries later, 20-year-old Kallis pushed fatally at a ball that
left him just enough to clip the outside edge on its way through to Russell.
Rhodes and McMillan dug in before heavy rain, accompanied by thunder and
lightning, ended any hope of play resuming.
q.SHAUN Udal is ready to take out all his frustration on Pakistan A in the
three-match one-day international series, starting in Peshawar today.
The 26-year-old Hampshire off-spinner, still a World Cup contender according to
England's selectors, has endured a tough seven weeks in Pakistan.
He has played in just three of England A's first-class matches, taking only
three wickets in 66 overs, and for the past month has been counting down the
days before he sees for the first time the baby daughter born during the first
Test at Multan.
But Udal has played in all of England's past 12 limited-overs internationals -
a run that stretches back 18 months.
He said: ``I seem to be regarded more as a one-day player at the moment with
England - it was the same last winter when I was on the senior tour in
Australia.
``It has been disappointing not to have had much of an opportunity so far on
this tour, but I must knuckle down now and prove my worth in these one-day
games.
``I am hoping that I am still in with a shout for the World Cup - I am sure
Richard Illingworth is going to be one of the specialist spinners selected but
in 1987, when the World Cup was last held in India and Pakistan, England played
two spinners in every match.''
England A team manager John Emburey said: ``It's important that, having won the
Test series, we keep going and all the lads are determined to maintain our
unbeaten tour record.''

YOU better not shout, you better not cry...... this week we fly through the
working day of the most famous festive figure of all - Father Christmas himself.
The big chap in the red suit took time out of his hectic schedule to grant an
exclusive interview to one of his longest admirers. Despite a heavy workload,
he remains (of course) jolly and cheerful about his work.
``I thoroughly enjoy it,'' he said. ``The kids are great and it's lovely to see
their faces light up when they come in to the grotto.'' The grotto in question
is at Parkhead Forge and at present it's pulling in almost 400 children (and
adults) every day.
The day of our visit, being a weekday, began at 9.30am. More than 100 happy
children from local nurseries were having their Christmas outing to Santa's
beautifully presented grotto. The children were no problem, patiently waiting
their turn at the gates. The adults, on the other hand, were getting a bit
over-excited. One wonders for whose benefit it is all arranged.
My suspicions were confirmed when I spoke to Santa's helper, Sarah Jane
Morrison. Adults can be as keen to see Santa as their offspring are. In fact,
those without offspring to use as an excuse have been known to visit the grotto
by themselves. ``We get high school pupils coming in, adults on their own, all
to see Santa,'' said Sarah Jane.
``The kids are brilliant, no problem at all. Usually they wait their turn and
watch the displays, but sometimes parents get them so excited by the time they
actually meet Santa they get a bit of a fright. If they're left alone to talk
to the other children they're usually quite happy.''
Two-year-old Shannon was visiting with her childminder, Geraldine Bracelin.
``She's a bit shy,'' said Geraldine. ``I'm not sure how she'll react.''
While waiting in the queue, Shannon got over her shyness enough to tell me what
she wanted for Christmas. ``I've been very good all year,'' she said, perhaps
not surprisingly, ``and I want a Barbie doll and a Barbie car to drive her
in.'' No problem, all we've got to do is get Santa out here and...... oh, dear.
Shannon's shyness made a sudden comeback when the Big Man himself tried to give
her a Christmas cuddle. Just one of the many awkward situations a public figure
has to deal with on a daily basis.
Eventually, by dint of much coaxing and, frankly, bribery from Geraldine,
Shannon recovered enough to enter the grotto. She emerged a few minutes later,
clutching her present. ``Was that fun?'' I asked. Such a small child should not
have been able to deliver such an old-fashioned look.
Santa told me he rarely has problems with timid kiddies. Quite the reverse, in
fact. ``A much bigger problem is the kids who come in, jump into my lap and
then refuse to leave,'' he said. ``They get upset when they're told they have
to let the next visitor in.''
Usually the children are simply coaxed into leaving with a present and a big
kiss from Santa - well, it worked for me.
By 10.30am the queue was continuing to grow, and Sarah Jane told us that often
they have to turn people away. ``At the weekends people are usually still
queuing at 6pm,'' she said. ``We have to close the centre then, so a lot of
children are disappointed, but we're open right up until Christmas so there's
still plenty of time to meet him.''
How does he cope? He needs the patience of a saint - which of course he has -
but it does take a toll on his social life. Not much time for relaxing in the
evening.
Mums and dads all over the world know that Father Christmas is partial to a
drop of sherry, and the Parkhead grotto informed me that it is normally his
wont of a Saturday evening to pop down the local for a few of the same.
Not during the Christmas season, however. ``He doesn't like to go out on a
Saturday night now,'' said my informant. ``Partly because he needs a good
night's rest, but mostly because if he went out the kids could smell `sherry'
from his breath in the morning.'' Doesn't he ever get bored? ``I've been doing
this for a long time now,'' said he. ``No, I don't get bored, the children are
very entertaining. Each one has a different question and a different outlook.
It's just a lot of fun.''

WITH many leading Scots lured south to the Uncle Ben's Winter Challenge in
Sheffield, national squad members Alison Sheppard, Pauline McLean, back-stroker
Richard Hope, and butterfly specialist Cameron Black aim to prove that next
year's Olympic Games can be more than a dream when they line up in today's
Scottish Winter Championships at Ayr.
Sheppard, already a veteran of two Games at the age of 23, has entered six
events, and is eager to prove the advantage of her winter trip to Canada, where
six weeks' training in Calgary fuelled her enthusiasm for the final countdown
to the Olympic trials in March.
``I'm certain it was a huge benefit, and the highlight was finishing second in
the 50 metres free-style at the Canadian championships,'' she said. ``I was
also fourth in the 100m and both times were close to my best.''
McLean will be challenging Sheppard in the back-stroke and free-style.
In yesterday's heats, Graeme Smith, the European championship silver medallist,
made an unspectacular start to his defence of the 1500m free-style. He finished
third-fastest qualifier behind great rival Ian Wilson and Glen Hudson, but will
be hoping to come out on top in today's final.
Fraser Walker qualified for the final of the 50m back-stroke, fourth in
26.62sec, while Dundee's Katie Lawson made it through to the final of the 200m
free-style in sixth place.

It might be in the Volkswagen group now, with all the quality
improvements that implies, writes Ross Finlay; but Seat's
new Toledo TDi (above) and updated Cordoba still capture . . .
SEAT brought a batch of its 1996 model year cars to Perthshire a few days ago,
featuring the new Toledo TDi and the updated Cordoba. There has been a turbo
diesel Toledo in the Spanish manufacturer's range for a while now, but the
90bhp TDi engine shares the latest VW group technology to bring in direct
injection, an intercooler and exhaust gas recirculation, so that it has
enhanced performance, economy, flexibility, and emission control.
Always a notably roomy car for both passengers and luggage, the Toledo in its
TDi guise manages exceptional economy for a bulky 1.9. On test it has returned
76mpg at 56mph, 53 at 75 and 51mpg on the urban cycle.
With a 15bhp advantage over the less sophisticated turbo diesel engine in the
range, the TDi is noticeably quicker off its mark. It will hit 60mph in 12
seconds, and offers really meaty torque from about 1900rpm onwards.
Seat has loaded the TDi with extra equipment. Costing #12,895 as the SE and
#13,795 as the SXE (which is fitted with anti-lock braking), the latest Toledo
comes with twin airbags and even air conditioning as standard.
On the road the mid-range performance is very impressive, and the TDi will pull
heartily from speeds at which some other turbo diesels are just grumbling into
action. But this is an uprated version of a saloon designed some time ago, and
in sharpness of handling, ride quality and general ``roadability'', it hardly
matches a similar car just out of the wrapping paper.
The freshened-up Cordoba demonstrates the difference. A later design, and to my
mind very under-rated in some quarters, the Cordoba is livelier to handle, more
composed on bumpy roads, and generally more of a driver's car.
It also has a neatly designed and trimmed interior, as well as a luggage volume
which is almost unbelievable if you have tried to estimate it first of all from
a glance at the rear body lines. As with all Seats, you can see immediately
what Volkswagen has contributed to the fascia and control layout.
The Cordoba is a very nippy car on country roads, with pleasant handling and a
slick throw-across gear change. There is a wide range of performance levels,
from the 1.4-litre CLS at #8795 to the two-litre GT at #12,795 - which will
sprint to 60mph in ten seconds, can go on to more than 120mph, and has brakes,
suspension fettling, wheel and tyre sizes to suit.
As part of the VW group, Seat has greatly improved its quality-control
procedures. But models like the Cordoba show that the Barcelona cars manage to
retain a Mediterranean spirit of fun on the road.

HAMMY McMillan's defence of the European title is still on course after a 5-4
win over England in a tense quarter-final yesterday evening at the European
Championships in Grindelwald, Switzerland.
He hit for a single at the first end, and English skip Alistair Burns blanked
the second and third ends before being forced to take a single in the fourth
when McMillan played a freeze with his last stone.
In the fifth end England's second player, Andrew Hemmings, missed a take-out
and allowed McMillan to build up the head and score 2 with a draw to the button.
At the sixth end Scotland's third, Norman Brown, had a stone removed for a
hog-line offence and McMillan had a complete miss. England were able to score 2
and bring the game back level.
England's third player, Alan McDougall, caught a guard in the seventh end,
allowing the Scots to build the end and score 2 with a McMillan hit.
Hay made up for his earlier mistake with a spectacular triple take-out in the
tenth end, and, when Burns could not dislodge two Scottish stones nestling in
the house with his last stone, the Scots had victory.
McMillan now faces surprise semi-finalists Italy this evening, while the
Scottish women, led by Kirsty Hay, are in quarter-final action against Denmark
this morning. Men's quarter-final results:
Scotland 5, England 4; Norway 5, Sweden 4; Germany 5, Switzerland 7; France 4,
Italy 6.
End scores:
Scotland..1.0.0 0.2.0 2.0.0.. X - 5
England..0.0.0 1.0.2 0.0.1.. X - 4

ATHLETICS
BRITISH athletics, in attempting to defuse one row, yesterday almost certainly
lit the touch-paper for another, with the credibility of David Cropper, the
chairman of the international selection committee, at stake.
Athletes' representatives, fronted by former European 400m champion Roger Black
and Scotland's triple Commonwealth high jump medallist Geoff Parsons, welcomed
the announcement of major changes in the Olympic selection process. Yet a
misplaced English obsession with upholding tradition still threatens to prevent
the best British team going to Atlanta.
The plan presented by the British Athletic Federation, after consultation with,
and approval from leading athletes, will stop competitors making a mockery of
the AAA Championships, as did Linford Christie and Colin Jackson last summer.
However, a row is brewing over a refusal by the AAA of England to exclude
foreigners from their championships, which double as the Olympic trials.
The system of choosing the AAA winner - plus two others per event at the
selectors' discretion - has been axed.
Instead, the first two past the post will be guaranteed an Olympic place, with
just one discretionary choice if each has fulfilled the qualifying standard.
Competitors must perform in their intended Olympic event at the AAAs in
Birmingham from June 14-16.
This will eliminate the fiasco of this year's AAA event, the World Championship
trials, when 10 athletes failed to compete, claiming various injuries.
Others switched events. Christie failed to get through his 100 metres heat, yet
was resinstated to the final. World hurdles record-holder Jackson declined to
race his specialty, ran the 100m heats instead, qualified, but then withdrew
pleading injury. Less than 24 hours later he hurdled in Italy.
Tony Ward, the BAF spokesman, said: ``It's tough, but fair. If athletes have
injuries serious enough to keep them out of trials, they are unlikely to be fit
for the Olympics.'' But he added: ``The AAA have so far been unable to
acquiesce to the BAF's request that the championships be closed.''
In recent years this has conspired to keep leading British competitors out of
finals. In the 800m, for example, only heat winners qualify, and perhaps two
fastest losers. Several Kenyans have reached the final, denying UK men the
chance of running for their country.
It is clearly ludicrous to persist with this open policy when the objective is
to select Britain's best Olympic team.
The AAA of England, of which selector Cropper is chairman, has defended their
open championships. This posture is incompatible with selecting the best UK
team, and he surely must decide where his allegiance lies.

VISITORS to Barcelona often see train-loads of Seats leaving the factory
complex at Martorell. Elsewhere, European and Japanese manufacturers have
satellite Spanish factories which turn out vehicles such as the Ford Maverick,
the Nissan Terrano and Serena.
But Barcelona has always been the heart of the Spanish motor industry, which
built some spectacular and ambitious cars before the grim era of the civil war.
La Cuadra and Castro flourished briefly around the turn of the century, and in
the Twenties Elizalde was turning out an 8.1-litre straight eight.
Hispano-Suiza, succeeding Castro, was one of the genuine prestige marques of
Europe. The company took the second part of its name from the nationality of
its great Swiss designer Mark Birkigt. In the Fifties, when the nationalised
Pegaso truck company decided to go into cars, another notable (and wildly
eccentric) personality was in charge - Wilfredo Ricart. The sports Pegasos,
built in the old Hispano-Suiza factory, were among the fastest production cars
in Europe, officially timed in Belgium at speeds approaching 150mph.
There was a touch of the Salvador Dali about Ricart. In the Thirties he had
worked with Alfa Romeo, encountering a supremely unimpressed Enzo Ferrari.
Ricart wore shoes with exaggeratedly thick rubber soles. Ferrari asked him
about this, and was solemnly told that ``a great engineer's brain should not be
jolted by the inequalities of the ground, and needs to be carefully sprung''.

NOW, as you and I and all the children of the world know, there is only one
Santa, writes JOAN GRADY. However, due to      the very great demand for his
presence,     he occasionally must take on helpers. Finding the right man for
that job is no easy task.
``We do have a selection procedure to identify possible helpers,'' says Mark
Stangroom, marketing coordinator at The Forge. ``They must, of course, be jolly
and good-natured and be confident with children. It gets very hot inside that
grotto so this is not a job for someone who is likely to get impatient with the
kids.''
Training is a case of trying to give ``Santa'' the ability to handle the
unpredictable situations which crop up around children. He is encouraged to ask
them questions, to chat them about his life in Greenland, his reindeer and his
elves.
``It's an acting job, really,'' says Mr Stangroom. ``Our stand-in is John
Kirkwood, who is usually a security guard at The Forge. He's worked as a Santa
before and he has a jolly personality and an ability to interest the children.
He has children and grandchildren of his own and was the ideal candidate for
the job.''
The visit to Santa's grotto is an important part of Christmas for children but
it takes a lot of effort to keep the magic going.
``We've had a grotto every year since the centre opened eight years ago. It's
always been something of a feature and the kids love it. John has to stay very
sharp - if he's not enjoying himself it comes across to the children and that's
a major disadvantage. For four weeks of the year he needs to be very
disciplined. It's a very responsible position.''

Volleyball
BALERNO High School will host a two-a-side volleyball tournament for Under-18
and Under-15 players on Sunday. A dozen teams are expected to compete in the
event, which is sponsored by TB Mackay Energy Services.
Rugby league
RUGBY all-rounder Graham Thompson leads a Scottish rugby league team into
battle for the first time ever on home soil tonight when the national students'
side face France at Meadowbank.
Thompson, who is also Gavin Hastings' understudy at Watsonians, said: ``The
sport is taking off in a big way in Scotland. The students' team can be a
direct stepping stone to the full Scotland squad - and there will also be
places up for grabs in the line-up to play in next year's Students World Cup.''
Basketball
FOR the second time in three years, Glasgow Brightsiders have had to pull out
of Scotland's top tournament, this weekend's Edinburgh 95 at Meadowbank.
Two years ago it was injuries, this time a rearranged Scottish Cup tie means
that the Glasgow club tomorrow face City of Aberdeen Leopards in a game
postponed because of a mix-up over the tip-off time.
Brightsiders men - without potential match-winner Phil Birch, who has damaged
ankle ligaments - will be hoping for better luck than their women's team, who
travelled to Aberdeen last Saturday only to return some four hours later
without playing their national league game with Leopards - who were waiting at
a different venue.
The Boroughmuir Christmas event continues on Sunday with the play-offs and
final (4pm). Boroughmuir and holders Livingston Bulls join Edzell Enforcers in
one group, while previous winners Edinburgh Burger Kings have Strathkelvin and
Paisley.
In the competitive women's tourney, capital sides Polonia Phoenix, Team
Caledonia, Beefeater Kool Kats, and Boroughmuir Aces join unbeaten Livingston
in a round-robin.
A welcome new event arrives in the West, with Troon staging an international
invitation club event for under-17 boys over the same two days. Marr College
teacher and organiser Tom Campbell has attracted teams from Ireland, Wales, and
England as well as three from Scotland.
Delta Notre Dame, who have won Irish honours at every age from under-13 to
under-22, join Flintshire from Wales, England's North Staffs and South Cheshire
Jets, and Cumnock Team Corsa, Arbroath Musketeers, and hosts Troon.
Squash
CLAIRE Waddell faces the first serious challenge of the season when she starts
the defence of the Scottish Championship at Heriot-Watt University today.
The 20-year-old Stirling University student is unbeaten and has won three
domestic grand-prix titles this season, but shares top billing this weekend
with London-based Senga Macfie, Scotland's top player at world No.21, but yet
to win the national title.
In the men's event, Martin Heath, the world No.30, has benefited from a string
of call-offs. Peter Nicol, winner of the Mahindra International Challenge in
India earlier this week, is not defending the title he has won for the past
three years, and Stuart Cowie (injury) and Alasdair Taylor (illness) have since
dropped out as second seeds.
Newlands' Barry Sutherland, who played in last month's World Championships, is
expected to reach the final but faces a stiff semi-final against former
internationalist Graeme Sword.
NATIONAL League Div 1 - Forthill 1 (5), Aberdeen 4 (18); Bridge of Allan 5
(20), Edinburgh SC 0 (4); Adscreen NLNDS 5 (20), Hamilton 0 (1).
Badminton
THE Scottish Open Championships look set to lose their grand-prix status - in
the same year as Scotland hosts the World Championships for the first time. The
International Badminton Federation have ruled that all tournaments seeking
grand-prix status must have a prize fund of at least $30,000 from 1997. Last
month's Scottish Open had prize money of only $15,000.

NEXT year will continue to see the newspaper circulation battle hotting up, and
sponsors will continue to pour cash into football and, in some cases, clubs
will squander it as fast.
Newspapers and sports sponsors have at least one common denominator value for
money. Newspapers should be giving value, and sponsors should receive it. Yet
the circulation battle will be fought almost totally on a reactive basis.
If you have scratch cards then so will we. As one carries one promotion the
other will follow. Management in the newspaper industry cannot be so naive
that, in a shrinking market place, they are going for extremism and
sensationalism when the public simply looks for value for money and content.
Balanced topics from news through to sport, is that not what the public wants?
Honest, truthful reporting with interesting features.
Sport, now there's a thing. Most tabloids have pull-outs on Mondays with page
after page of football. Reactive again, one following the other. The coverage
is unbelievable. Some games attract 250 people and the space given to that game
is incredible, so much so that if you wanted to purchase that space for
advertising, it could cost you thousands.
Football, in this country, has fallen short of world standard and needs all the
hyping it can get, but what does it attract in the way of people each week?
Attendances from four leagues, 80,000 in total. Is that a fair average with
Rangers and Celtic contributing in the main to that figure? Perhaps 250,000
viewers at peak TV time on a Sunday afternoon, is this giving value for money?
Are the participants, that is the players and the clubs, aware of the
responsibilities to sponsors? I fear not.
The SFA, club chairmen, are urged by the media to clean up the game, in some
cases rightly so. But sponsors possibly hold the key to the disturbing elements
creeping onto the football pitch. They should be demanding that football clean
up its act, and that clubs and players meet their responsibilities.
In an equally competitive industry, knitwear, The Sweater Shop is probably the
most successful manufacturing retailer of its kind in the high streets of
Britain. They probably have the most up-to-date, state of the art plant in
Western Europe, if not the world, and as a result of their sponsorship
commitment to snooker, and Stephen Hendry in particular, a plant in Scotland
was opened three-and-a-half years ago and now employs more than 400 people.
Their sponsorship commitment was total, they expected nothing less in return.
They insisted that people such as Hendry, Dean Robertson, Dennis Taylor, etc,
give value for money to public and media alike, demanding that those stars
remember who and what they represent. If we let them down, there were stiff
penalties. Therefore we ensured they were never let down. Surely there is a
lesson to be learned by the two parties sharing a common denominator.
If football in this country, and newspapers, are serious about their future,
they have to source out questions which first they must ask themselves, and,
secondly, they must answer. If the product is not value for money in the case
of newspapers, advertising revenue will drop, and in the case of football,
sponsorship will decline.
Snooker suffered these problems in the late '80s and early '90s and had to
learn the hard way. It has been difficult, but learn we did, and our values and
responsibilities are now to the people who pay the piper.
In the end, with companies such as The Sweater Shop who have invested at grass
roots, our game is booming in Scotland. Through client and high-profile event
sponsorship, their profile has blossomed, and success is there for all to see.
I am proud to be Scottish, and it upsets me to see our national football team
branded second-rate. I do not believe it has to be that way.
Scots are ranked first, second, and sixth in the world at snooker; No.1 and 2
in Europe, at golf. That is because these sports have been prepared to adapt,
and give value for money to sponsors and public. In football, that is not the
case. These people are not prepared to change their comfortable, traditional
habits.
There is a warning here for football and newspapers, and they should take heed
before it is too late. Waste not, want not.

JACK Charlton is poised to announce his retirement as Republic of Ireland
manager early in the New Year, after exactly a decade in the job.
The 60-year-old Englishman recovered from Wednesday's Euro '96 play-off defeat
by Holland insisting he still has an open mind about his future. ``I honestly
don't know what I'm doing - I don't know whether to stick or twist,'' he said.
But he dropped a broad hint when he added: ``I would like to be in the job for
10 years, not nine years and 10 months, and that's the end of January.''
The Irish FA's chief executive, Sean Connolly, insisted: ``No-one is pushing
him to stay, and no-one pushing him to go. We believe it is a decision that has
to be Jack's alone.''
Charlton says he will wait and see what the reaction is in Ireland over the
next few weeks, enjoy his Christmas and then take a holiday in Spain. ``When I
come back, we will have a meeting with the FAI and sort out what's happening.''
But he clearly suspects his time has gone, reflecting on the lack of spare
parts for his worn-out squad and a modern passing game that has now by-passed
the Irish pressing style.
On the other hand, he is still moved by the passion of the Irish fans, who will
always revere him for taking them to the finals of two World Cups and the 1988
European Championship.
They stood in the Anfield cold and demanded his presence after the 2-0 defeat
ended his dream of finishing his reign on a more upbeat note on home soil next
summer. ``I was very moved by that,'' he admitted.
His side ran their hearts out against the world-class Dutch but, for the third
time in four major meetings, they were simply second best. The narrow gap of
Gelsenkirchen in '88 had become a yawning chasm.
For players like 37-year-old John Aldridge and 36-year-old Paul McGrath,
retirement certainly beckons, even though Charlton cannot see their successors.
``We've wrung as much as we can from Paul. He's been magnificent for us but
there is a limit,'' said the Ireland manager. ``But where do you find new
players, the players who might make you a good or reliable side?''
Minimum Irish requirements are a quick centre half to become Phil Babb's new
partner, a lively and genuine goalscorer and a fit Roy Keane.

A FIREFIGHTER yesterday relived the moment when his foot was amputated as he
fought to put out a blaze in a grain dryer.
Leading firefighter Francis Paterson told a court he had never been trained on
how to deal with such fires.
``I have never had any special training on how to fight fires in machinery,''
the retained fire officer told Peterhead Sheriff Court yesterday.
Mr Paterson, 40, of Copeman Place, Peterhead, described how he lost his footing
as he was coming out of the dryer and his right foot was caught in the
machinery.
``I slipped downwards and my foot went into the augur,'' he said.
In the first case of its kind in Scotland, a local authority is facing charges
under health and safety legislation for an accident involving a firefighter.
On trial is Grampian Regional Council which operates Grampian Fire Brigade. The
council denies failing to provide suitable training for fighting fires in grain
dryers and not preventing Mr Paterson from entering the dryer when it was
working, as a result of which he was injured.
The accident happened on August 1, 1994, when the retained unit from Peterhead
was called to a fire at East Longhill Farm, near the Aberdeenshire town.
Earlier, Mr Paterson agreed with defence counsel Gerry Monaghan that he had
been told to isolate the source of power before fighting a fire.
``Do you accept that what you did was contrary to your training? '' asked Mr
Monaghan.
``Yes'', replied Mr Paterson.

WINTER finally bit into Scottish football yesterday. The signs were all there,
with club chairmen taking sides, and the game's administrators, who have the
unenviable task of trying to follow the often peculiar logic of football
people, preparing the way for what seems now to have become an annual debate.
League reconstruction is back on the agenda.
Next week the Scottish League management committee will gather, and the main
topic of discussion will be a first-division propelled move to restructure the
leagues, even though clubs had agreed to persevere with the current set-up of
four groups of 10 clubs for five years.
This system is in only its second season and already many have deemed it a
failure. Various people have their own notions, and while it might be
comforting to believe the clamour will rise from altruism, the reality remains
that the most powerful incentive for a new shape is born from financial needs.
Some clubs, like Partick Thistle, for instance, say they can survive without
playing each of the Old Firm four times a season, but there are many more
outfits who continue to regard Rangers and Celtic as meal tickets, and would
like a slice of that action.
They want a top division of 16 or 18 clubs, and even though the Old Firm were
united yesterday in opposition to the change, the smaller clubs could carry
enough votes to have their way at Thursday's management committee meeting.
Much could depend on how they handle the subject of the Coca-Cola Cup, which
would have to be altered if a 16-club top division is given life, because the
League Cup competition is one of the most exciting of its kind. Part of the
proposal for change would involve the early stages of the cup becoming
sections, a system which was lacklustre when tried before.
The Scottish League came up with a shorter, sharper competition which has been
a resounding success, and it would be a pity to dismantle the set-up to help
tempt clubs to vote for league reconstruction. If the top division becomes one
of 16, that would guarantee clubs only 15 home matches, which would hardly be
sufficient for most of them, and one way of compensating would be to ensure
additional home matches through League Cup sections.
However, if the main division was extended to accommodate 18 clubs, the cup
competition could be left unaltered, but the chances of a reconstruction
leading to an additional eight teams in the premier division are remote. The
clubs pushing for change realise they will have to go for 16 and, even then,
they will face stiff opposition.
``I don't think this kind of main division would suit the customer,'' said
Celtic chairman Fergus McCann. ``People pay for quality, not quantity. We are
not represented on the league management committee, which itself is a
regrettable situation, but we would prefer the current set-up.
``Bringing in more clubs would lead to an increase in the number of mediocre
matches, and I'd rather see us all look at other aspects of the game, such as a
split season, which would allow more football in the summer.''
Rangers chairman David Murray, who was a main force behind the ill-fated Super
League a few years ago, pointed out his club would not support change simply
for the sake of it. Before casting a vote in favour, he would need to be
convinced change would lead to a healthier product, and he does not believe
this latest proposal means a better set-up.
``There would have to be certain criteria before we would vote for change, but
as the proposal stands, we are not in favour.
``I'm not for letting other people come to the party and take the crumbs off
the rich man's table,'' he said. ``I think these people are in danger of
changing for the wrong reasons.
``We need new equity in football, and clubs need funding by someone, or a group
of people with money, and until we have that new funding, we can't go forward.''
Murray fears also that a top division of 16 would not be an encouragement to
television. ``It would become boring,'' he said.
It is thought Hibernian and Aberdeen will vote against change also, while
Partick Thistle, Raith Rovers, Kilmarnock, Hearts, Motherwell and, possibly,
Falkirk are in favour, and with those numbers as well as the bulk of clubs
below, the chances are good that a special general meeting of the Scottish
League will be called. It would be at this meeting the real voting would be
conducted, with 75% of the votes necessary to enforce change in time for the
start of next season.
This rule was written in to protect the current set-up for a five-year term,
but if the clubs wish time to ease in a new structure, and accept the status
quo should remain throughout season 1996-97, then only two thirds of the vote
will be necessary to enforce change for the following season.
Premier division clubs each have four votes, two each in the first division,
and clubs in the second and third divisions each have only one, although it
should be remembered the two new clubs, Caley Thistle and Ross County, are
still associate members and do not have votes.
Dundee United's chairman, Jim McLean, argues that change now could be crucial
to the development of the game, stressing there are too many negative aspects
attached to a small top division of 10 clubs.
``We have all had time to look at the set-up and as far as I'm concerned, young
players are not being brought through, games are not attractive enough, and the
financial implications can be severe to some,'' he said.
``There is too much pressure on people and, while we should never try to take
the competitiveness out of our game, I have to say that if I were a player with
any ability, Scotland and England are the last places I'd want to bring my
talents.
``I can honestly say that Dundee United are not important in this. The product
is what matters most, and that product is questionable. We are playing
desperate football.''
There are no guarantees that a change will lead to better football, only
properly co-ordinated youth development work will do that.
Many argue four divisions of 10 prevents the use of young players, while others
ask for proof that three divisions of 16, 12, and 12 would be a more suitable
world.
It would be comforting to believe votes will be cast with the wellbeing of the
entire game in mind, rather than individual needs. Supporters would be wise to
proceed with a healthy degree of scepticism.

ALTHOUGH Australian Wayne Riley deservedly took a three stroke lead with his
first round score of 66, five under par, in the Johnnie Walker World
Championship in Jamaica yesterday John Daly, who won the Open Championship at
St Andrews in July, the week after Riley's victory in the Scottish Open at
Carnoustie, also commanded attention, but for very different reasons.
Daly, as always predictably unpredictable, had a score of 80 over the 6760-yard
Tryall course. Having arrived too late even for one practice round, he incurred
five penalty strokes, three from drives hit out of bounds, and two from
unplayable lies. The former US PGA champion played the first 11 holes in 11
over par and covered the last seven in two under.
Yet Daly, at the end of a day characterised by 90F heat and high humidity, as
well as a swirling Caribbean breaze, did not occupy the last of the 20 places.
That dubious distinction belonged to the Swede, Anders Forsbrand. who, having
match Daly's 43 to the turn, forged steadily backwards to be home in 40 for a
three-stroke ``lead.''
Daly's mishaps echoed those when he played in the first championship four years
ago. Then he was disqualified after having signed an incorrect card for a score
of 86, 36-50 each way.
There was controversy then when Daly was given the same prize money as was
earned by the professional occupying last place, having played all 72 holes.
Now to collect the $57,000 pittance twentieth place carries, the player must
have completed all four rounds, unless the committee decrees otherwise.
Meanwhile, at the sharp end, so to speak, Riley, aged 33, and whose victory in
the Scottish championship was his first in Europe and was one of eight last
season achieved by five players using a long-handed putter, chipped in from
30ft at the first and subsequently showed admirable control in adding five more
birdies and conceding only one stroke to par.
Remarkably, given Riley's command of awkward rather than exacting conditions,
only three other players broke par - the Fijian Vijay Singh, on 69, Riley's
partner, Loren Roberts and Fred Couples, another American Ryder Cup player on
70. Bernhard Langer led the European challenge on level par.
As is often the case in this season-ending event, some of the scoring gave
every evidence of player burn-out. When so much prize money is available to
professionals already gorged with riches it is not difficult to understand that
loss of interest and purpose can set in if matters begin to go wrong.
Thus the holder, Ernie Els, who began with two 64s last year, took 15 strokes
more and Colin Montgomerie and Sam Torrance, first and second on the 1995
European Order of Merit, had scores of 75 and 77 respectively. Nick Faldo,
watched by his new inamorata, lent respectability to his score of 74 with two
late birdies.
66 - W Riley (Aus).
69 - V Singh (Fiji).
70 - L Roberts (US), F Couples (US).
71 - B Langer (Ger).
72 - D Duval (US), P Mickelson (US), M Calcavecchia (US).
73 - A Cejka (Ger).
74 - N Faldo (GB).
75 - P Azinger (US), B Mayfair (US), L Janzen (US), C Montgomerie (GB).
77 - P Senior (Aus), S Torrance (GB).
79 - E Els (SA).
80 - J Daly (US), T Izawa (Jap).
83 - A Forsbrand (Swe).

ABERDEEN have put midfield player Peter Hetherston on the transfer list.
Pittodrie manager Roy Aitken, who will want to recoup the #200,000 paid to
Raith Rovers for Hetherston last season, said: ``He never moved his family up
here which has proved a burden and affected his form. I have come to the
conclusion that it is in the interests of both parties to make him available
for transfer.''
``Peter has done a great job here and I am sure he can still fill a major role
with another club.''
However, one man with no thoughts of leaving Pittodrie is Joe Miller, who is
convinced the club will avert an exodus of top players and build on their
Coca-Cola Cup success.
The winger is one of seven Aberdeen players out of contract at the end of the
season. But he said yesterday: ``No-one is in a hurry to leave. It is obvious
that exciting times lie ahead under Roy Aitken. We have just won a cup and have
the makings of a very good team.
``I'm sure the club will sort out the contract situation in plenty of time. I
would be happy to stay. For the most part I have been a first-team regular
under the manager and that is all I've ever wanted.
``Scoring the hat trick against Kilmarnock was a welcome change. In recent
weeks I have been trying too hard and it never happened for me.
``It has been frustrating but throughout my career I have been able to get
among the goals. That's seven now and I will be aiming to get into double
figures as soon as possible.''
Captain Stewart McKimmie, Eoin Jess, Gary Smith, Brian Grant, and keepers Theo
Snelders and Michael Watt are all out of contract at the end of the season.

I'm glad to say work and friends have been a great consolation
to me
-- DAVID JASON
This year David Jason had to cope with the tragic death of his long-time
partner, Myfanwy Talog. But now he is ready to return in a new series of A
Touch of Frost. Julia Langdon sees the actor step back into the frame
DAVID Jason does not give interviews. David Jason does not like meeting the
press and, indeed, it seems he tries to avoid being in the same building as a
journalist if at all possible. So the fact that he has at least turned up for
the press launch and screening of his new television series is a great relief
to a large bunch of harrassed-looking media executives.
And there he is: sitting in a corner of the reception, hemmed in by a gaggle of
showbiz writers and looking hideously ill at ease. He is almost literally
squirming with discomfort and it is not merely because his suit, with its very
expensive sheen, is just a little too tight.
There is something oddly disconcerting about spending two hours in a cinema
watching an actor play a chirpy Yorkshire copper who fearlessly takes on
homicidal maniacs, and then emerge to find the man himself is disconcerted by a
bunch of journos. (Although I myself jumped when I found I was standing beside
the actor who played the aforementioned maniac. ``Ugh, you!'' I said,
involuntarily).
Unreasonably, we expect actors to relate to the character with whom we identify
them, and here is poor David Jason who may be a superb actor, but cannot
disguise himself, cannot hide his own feelings, when talking about himself. It
reminded me of an occasion when I did a television programme with a famous
journalist war photographer who had spent most of the previous five years
dodging death in Beirut, and here he was sitting in the safety of a studio in
Manchester shaking with nerves at the prospect of appearing on screen.
In fact, of course, David Jason is not actually talking about himself to start
with but is, rather, talking about his character, Detective Inspector Frost,
who returns in a five-part series in January. Could he possibly be hiding?
Almost certainly.
He is smaller than you expect, balder, too, and quite tubby when he is sitting
down. The word dapper seems to apply, certainly in contrast to the the rather
rough-hewn appearance of Frost. He rattles on about how much he feels the
character of Frost has developed - echoing the press release which we all
already have in our hands - and how pleased he is with it, and with the
script-writers, and then there suddenly comes an echo of his own personal
misery and why he is radiating all this unhappiness.
The press release tells it in words that Jason himself does not, cannot, use.
``He has moved away from the sadness of his wife dying and all that heartache
and adapted more to the normal self,'' it says of Frost. And, of course, what
has happened to Jason is a ghastly mirror image of that: with the tragic death
from cancer of his own long-time partner, Myfanwy Talog, in March this year.
It is this which hangs unsaid in the air as we all struggle to try to reach the
real David Jason. There is another four-part series of A Touch of Frost being
filmed between February and August. It is very hard work and particularly
trying for Jason because he is in practically every scene. He ends up doing 12
to 14-hour days, five days a week, and has to spend every evening swotting up
the scripts. Each episode takes five weeks to film and it is all totally
concentrated effort.
``One doesn't grizzle too much at the time,'' he says, ``but after a year your
brain starts to get a bit sponge-like.''
He is uncertain about whether there will be a further series after this year.
He won't say ``never'', but his future is clearly very undecided. He is
uncertain about much which lies ahead. He has had a punishing schedule in the
last decade: four years of doing Frost, four years before that of The Darling
Buds of May. He is quite obviously fed up with being committed for a year at a
time, ``being processed'' as he calls it, and thus unable to do anything else.
His agent doesn't even tell him about half the things he's offered, he says;
there's no point, he can't do them. He couldn't do a major part in a movie; he
couldn't do a play at the National or the RSC; there was an Alan Ayckbourn he
was quite interested in - but, no, he couldn't do that, either.
What about another crack at Only Fools and Horses? ``What, on crutches, you
mean?'' he says. He sniffs. It seems to be a nervous sniff: he does it to
emphasise his jokes, to show that he is not really uncomfortable. He fiddles
with his tie. ``You have to wonder whether you can go back,'' he observes.
Someone asks if he means he might be getting on a bit for the part. ``Yeah,''
he says, ``but I'm always open to bribery, as Del-boy would say.''
This year he has found time to do a pilot for a proposed series about diving -
its working title is Around the World in 80 Dives - and he enjoyed looking for
the best diving site in the world, in the Virgin Islands and the Caribbean. He
does not, quite clearly, like any intrusion into his privacy and he volunteers
how much he appreciated going unrecognised.
``Basically the Americans don't know who you are and they don't want to have
photographs taken with their kids and their snotty-nosed dogs. It's quite
refreshing to be able to get away and not be hassled.''
A little later, when someone asks him about taking time off, he says he will be
spending some time working on his house, and then immediately erects the
barricade.
``With my guard dogs!'' he says, ``And my guns! I'm repairing the electric
fences at the moment.'' Everyone laughs, nervously.
He has a nervous laugh, too; a short little sharp bark which does not convey
much humour. He does it now when someone broaches the unmentionable, murmurs
that he has had a difficult year and asks if he has thrown himself into work in
consequence. There's a moment's silence and the questioner, attempting to ease
it, suggests that Jason might be thinking: ``I'm getting older.'' Jason
replies: ``Oh, are you?'', trying to break the tension.
He concedes there is some truth in that, but part of his cover includes
throwing questions back at his interrogators. It is, interestingly, a trick
Margaret Thatcher used to employ when she was put on the spot. ``What would you
do?'' she would ask.
Jason does it to me when I ask if he is anxious about not taking too many parts
that are vehicles for him, the star, carrying the rest of the cast. ``I beg
your pardon,'' he says, pretending to mishear, and trying rather too hard for a
laugh, ``Is it a contraceptive?'' But he has heard perfectly well because he
then answers seriously, acknowledging it is a factor, that he doesn't want to
take anything on just to keep working.
That might have been true in the past because of the classic actor's
insecurity, the deep-rooted fear that one will never work again, but maybe now
he might slow down a bit. This is a recurring theme. At one point he puts on a
silly voice of an old codger: ``Maybe now is the time that I ought to take it
easy,'' he warbles, ``because I'm getting older and need the crutches to get
about on.''
He wouldn't mind a bit more free time if only he could afford it. He addresses
this over our heads to the executive producers and denies the apparently
published suggestion that he gets #100,000 for an episode of A Touch of Frost.
``A bloody joke,'' he says.
``You're better scriptwriters than some of my blokes.'' Not true then?
``Christ, I wish it was.'' But it has been rewarding, he acknowledges.
And then, at last, someone asks how he is coping. ``It's been very, very
difficult and I'm glad to say that work and the friends I've had at Yorkshire
TV have been a great help and a great consolation for me. I don't really want
to go into great detail . . . '' he hurrumphs. ``I've had nicer years, let's
put it like that. Working so hard - well, one just had to do it; the amount of
energy and concentration needed, you know, eased the burden, as it were.''
There's another cough and a sniff and an ironic ``huh!'', and someone asks
about Christmas. ``I've always hated Christmas, anyway,'' he says miserably,
and makes some fairly banal observations about commercialism.
He endures it for a few more minutes and then a public relations person finally
rescues him. One misery, at least, is over for the time being.

MIKE Tyson is primed to seriously invest in the hurt business in Philadelphia
tomorrow, but the recipient of his formidable power game is the one
entertaining the sympathic thoughts.
``I feel sorry for the guy,'' confessed Buster Mathis Jr. ``I believe Tyson is
insecure about boxing after being off for a long time. There is pressure in his
life.
``All that money, all that fame, all that recognition, and to me he doesn't
seem happy.
``I don't envy Mike money. To me it's a curse as well as a blessing. Money and
fame can destroy a man. If I was earning $50-60m a fight, I couldn't change.
I'd be wearing the same clothes as I do now.''
Mathis Jr has a different philosophy, influenced by his father. Mathis Sen was
a top-class boxer in his day, fighting Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in the
golden heavyweight era, but died in September soon after the Tyson fight had
been signed.
``He knew the politics of the game. He couldn't read or write, but he was good
at reading people,'' added Mathis, who will not be embarrassed by a career-best
pay day of $565,000, about a tenth of Tyson's purse.
``I invest my money, I don't have a car, don't buy fancy clothes, and there's
no lady in my life. I live at home with my mom. I'm a mommy's boy, big time.
Tyson has found an opponent with the steely thread of dedication in the
unbeaten 25-year-old heavyweight, Mathis Jr, for his second comeback fight.
``I often feel when I walk into the ring that I've got to fight for my life,''
admitted Mathis.
``But some fighters perform better when they are frightened. My father used to
say: `fear is my friend'.''
Mathis comes from a religious family. His mother is a Jehovah's Witness. Mathis
senior studied the persuasion and Mathis junior learned about it while growing
up.
``I'm not a dedicated Witness. But I believe I control my own destiny,'' added
Mathis.
Mathis, already a BSc in Computer Engineering, used his time well between the
postponement on November 4 and his return to training, and passed a Real Estate
crash course.
He also took time to study the tape of Tyson's 89-second fiasco against Peter
McNeeley in August.
``It's taught me a lot. It seems Tyson missed with 80% of his punches. McNeeley
shoved him back.
``Tyson's nowhere near the fighter he was at 21. Now he's going on 30 and has
had a four-year lay-off.'' If Mathis pulls off the shock of the decade he could
take Tyson's place in the ring with Frank Bruno on March 16.

ALLY McCoist cast his mind back yesterday, with humour and affection, to his
boyhood as an athlete, and his first sporting success. Then, with more guarded
emotions, looked forward to the day he fears more than any other, when the
final whistle blows, and an illustrious football career has to end.
``I watched the World Cup draw - I think it is a great one for Scotland,'' said
the Rangers striker. ``But I have to be realistic. At my age, I have to admit I
am unlikely to be there.''
McCoist was speaking after having presented trophies to some of Scotland's
leading young school and club athletes, infusing and charming them with his
infectious enthusiasm at the TSB Thistle Awards ceremony in Edinburgh. He
confirmed, however, that his personal tape is in sight.
``I've set my stall out this season. The real goal is the European
Championships - to be involved in the finals, in England. I am not getting any
younger. It is not impossible that I will never play in another major
championships. But realistically, this is my last chance at the Europeans, and
it could be my international swan song.
``Not to have qualified for the finals, with them being in England, would have
been a disaster for Scots. I take great personal pride in having scored the
goal against Greece which was a major one in helping us qualify.''
He will be in London, working in a media role, this weekend when the European
draw takes place. ``We could do without getting Holland,'' he ventured. ``I
can't believe it took that play-off to see them through. All these youngsters
from Ajax, just 19, 20, and 21 - it's frightening. These kids will just get
better and better.''
McCoist is not averse to learning even at his advanced years. ``The Ajax youth
coach is coming to Ibrox on Sunday, and I will be going along to have a look.
We need a boot up the backside. Holland's a small country, like us, and their
methods seem to work. Maybe we should alter our ideas and methods a bit. That
could be the way ahead, to watch the likes of Ajax, and learn from their
coaches.''
It is not the lure of that elusive fiftieth cap, the entree to the Hall of
Fame, which is his motivation, just undiluted passion for the game. ``When you
speak to the guys who coach, the players who have finished, they say how great
it is still to be involved. But they admit it is no substitute for the real
thing, that there is no bigger thrill than playing.
``So I want to play as long as I can. I lost the best part of two years with
the leg-break, but that's two years I wasn't damaging ligaments and tendons.
Perhaps I can stretch it out a bit longer. I'd never say `never' to the World
Cup, but you have to face reality.
``The World Cup draw was great for us - I'm not saying it won't be difficult -
but it was magic. Look at what happened to Northern Ireland - Germany and
Portugal. Or England - Italy, Poland, Georgia, and Moldova - that section is
murder.
``Getting Sweden is another boost for us. We're one of the teams they did not
fancy. We have to be happy.''
Some might have thought McCoist's presence at an athletics ceremony out of
place - he did have European Cup 400 metres champion Melanie Neef there to keep
him right - but he confessed to modest track success of his own, before his
chemistry teacher, former Clyde manager Archie Robertson, lit his football fuse.
``I took a silver medal for 800m as a 12-year-old at Hunter High, East
Kilbride, and I used to do the Thistle Awards.''
Dismissing invitations to race Neef, who is helping make a video to launch the
twenty-fifth year of the awards, he laughed: ``Sprinting? I'm the guy who got
lapped in the 100m - and that was by a girl.'' Forty per cent of Scotland's
schools use the Thistle scheme, or Magic Mac Awards. But as Richard Ellis, head
of TSB sponsorship, says, ``that means 60% do not get the message.
``They helped develop Ally's agility, skill, speed, and strength - qualities
all sports need. We are anxious to get across the message that the awards can
be a valuable part of the curriculum. There's a preconception that they're
complicated. But they're much easier to operate for primary and secondary
schools, than in the past.
``We are trying to explain that they're valuable to the development of any
sport.'' Thistle Award winners:
Primaries - 1, Denholm (Hawick); 2, Hilton (Inverness); 3, Coldstream.
Secondaries. Male - 1, Castlehead (Paisley); 2, St Mungo's (Glasgow); 3,
Hamilton College. Female - 1, Castlehead (Paisley); 2, Wellington (Ayr); 3, St
Columba's (Kilmacolm). Atletic clubs. Male - 1, Shetland AAC; 2, Elgin AAC; 3,
Edinburgh AC. Female - 1, Shetland AAC; 2, Elgin AAC; 3, Babcock Pitreavie AAC.

<TEXT>
By ROY ROGERS
Industrial Correspondent
THE Transport and General Workers Union, one of the largest Labour Party
affiliates, will have no truck with any regional or sectoral variations for the
statutory national minimum wage a Labour Government is committed to introduce.
Nor would the TGWU favour any reduced rate for youngsters except possibly in
situations where it was linked to acceptable training programmes. Otherwise,
where young workers perform an adult job they should receive adult rates,
general secretary Bill Morris stressed yesterday.
At the same time as keeping pressure on Labour on the make-up of the statutory
minimum, the TGWU was proceeding with its industrial campaign to win a minimum
of at least #4 an hour for its members.
The biggest such deal to date involved 7000 members employed by the Ministry of
Defence although Mr Morris is hoping for a major breakthrough in forthcoming
negotiations for local authority workers. However, he concedes his union's #1m
fighting fund might have to be deployed to force employers to accept the #4 an
hour minimum.
Summing up the year, Mr Morris said membership losses appeared to have bottomed
out, with numbers rising by 300 to 902,000 in the quarter to September - the
first gain for 16 years.
Finances too were looking healthier but the TGWU was to continue running down
its Labour Party affiliation.

IT sounds like a form of masochism but Nairn County are about to issue a video
of their performances so far this season.
For just #5, County supporters can sit through the highlights - if indeed that
is the right word - of some of their side's 15 league games, during which they
have conceeded 44 goals, and been successful just three times. Sounds like fun,
doesn't it.
The man to ``blame'' is local businessman and camaraman Charlie Robertson, who
is sure the tape will prove a popular stocking filler with Nairn supporters at
Christmas.
But hold on, it would be pointless charging down to your local video store
right away with your fiver in hand because Charlie's classic will not be
available at leading stores - it could frighten the children.
An initial run of 20 tapes are up for grabs at Nairn's social club Christmas
fayre. Freddy Kreuger, eat your heart out.

IT has been 11 years since Derek Ferguson was ``coached'' through an Old Firm
match by the then Celtic midfield player Tommy Burns.
Times have changed, of course, and Ferguson, just 17 when he lined up for
Rangers against the current Celtic manager, must push that memory to the back
of his mind as Ferguson's new club, Falkirk, go to Parkhead in search of points
tomorrow.
``I remember my Old Firm debut well,'' said Ferguson. ``I was 17 and only found
out the day before when manager Jock Wallace called me into his office and told
me I was playing.
``I was in the middle of the park against Tommy Burns and I couldn't believe it
when he started giving me advice and telling me to keep things simple. For a
guy who wanted to beat me - and I was desperate to beat him - it was something.
That has always stuck in my mind.''
That December, 1984, Parkhead clash ended 1-1 - but the Falkirk player knows
his side will have to turn in a top show to achieve the same result tommorow."

ONE place where shopping hasn't lost its community spirit these days is De
Courcy's arcade, just behind Byres Road in Glasgow's West End.
Even in the season of festive cheer, the fun can go out of choosing gifts when
your purchase is just one of thousands of anonymous transactions in a busy
department store.
In Cresswell Lane, where De Courcy's has been in business for 15 years in a
converted stable, more than 20 individual traders operate within its pristine
whitewashed walls.
Choose from a selection of clothing, furniture, gifts, curios and services in
the knowledge that the personal touch has not been lost. The person you deal
with will most probably be the owner of the business, not some disinterested
sales assistant.
For the very young there's a children's bookshop, with plenty to interest and
amuse, and a new and secondhand clothes shop where you can pick up some unusual
outfits, or spot a bargain among the rails. For adults, the arcade's your
oyster.
If you're keen on handicrafts, you can either buy a sewing machine or have one
serviced, but if you prefer not to do the hard work yourself, there's a
dressmaking and alteration service. The linen and lace place has some
delightful offerings which will give your furniture a rich and classy tone, and
can be functional as well as decorative.
For the more trendy there's a selection of American clothing, and hobby
enthusiasts will be interested in the records, tapes and CDs collections, and
the computer games store. The book shop has a marvellous selection of old
comics, as well as a satisfyingly diverse range of titles. Staying with the
written word, there's a full range of printing and photocopying services.
For the home, the art section offers some exciting original works, and if you
have your own prints, there's a picture framing shop.
Good traditional furniture can be difficult to find but the arcade has both
antique and reproduction items. Advice and estimates on having furniture of
your own renovated or french polished are available.
If your home has everything, then don't despair, there's still something to
interest you. Garden pots in lots of shapes, sizes and colours may appeal.
The friendly cafe will provide a relaxing backdrop for wondering how your bank
balance is going to stand up to all this delightful shopping, but perhaps
that's best left between you and the resident clairvoyant.

<TEXT>
THE Department of Heritage yesterday owned up to asking 50p too much for next
year's television licences.
An ``administrative error'' resulted in the price of a colour licence being
announced to Parliament two weeks ago as #90.
The figure should have been #89.50, the Department said.
It said that the change would not affect the BBC's ability to provide its range
of TV and radio services.
The mistake arose because when the new figure was calculated, using the Retail
Price Index, it was rounded up to the nearest 50p instead of being rounded down.
This year, a colour licence costs #86.50.Black-and-white licences still will be
#30 after April 1.

THERE will be no attempt by the Scottish Football Association to have
alterations made to the format of the European Championship finals' draw which
takes place in Birmingham on Sunday afternoon.
Concern has been expressed in various quarters over the possibility of Scotland
being drawn in the same group as England, sparking a major invasion of London
by the Tartan Army.
So far UEFA have resisted any change to the manner in which they will conduct
the draw. Four seeds have been named, including the host nation, England, and
they each will be allocated to one of the groups. As for the remainder, it is
an open draw, although there is a possibility that this could be changed at a
UEFA meeting this morning.
Yesterday the chief executive of the SFA, Jim Farry, revealed: ``We will abide
by the rules of the tournament as to how the draw is made.
``The organising committee know how both we and the English FA feel about the
possibility of playing each other in a group game, but that is as far as
anything has gone.''
Farry has no fears about the behaviour of the international team's followers
who will cross the Border in massive numbers in the summer. He is quick to
point out that the Tartan Army were given a fair play award after their
invasion of Sweden four years ago.
So far, of course, the two associations have ducked out of staging the meetings
on the former annual basis. Trouble at Wembley and at Hampden brought them to
an end. But the SFA are looking towards a resumption of the game's oldest
international match when the refurbishment of Hampden is complete, and they are
sure to ask the English to play there in the opening game.
Meanwhile, as UEFA sit down in Birmingham for preliminary committee meetings as
the countdown to the draw begins, another major decision will be made in Europe
when the Court of Justice hands down its judgment in the case concerning the
Belgian player, Jean-Marc Bosman, who has won the first leg of his battle to
allow players complete freedom of contract.
Now he expects the court to ratify the opinion given in September by Advocate
General Carl Otto Lenz.
If the case goes as expected transfer fees will be abolished, and the current
ban on the number of foreign players who can appear for a club in European
competition may also go.

EXECUTIVES from the Scottish nuclear industry will meet in Edinburgh today  to
discuss the way towards privatisation, writes ALAN HUNTER.
This was announced yesterday by the chairman of British Energy, John Robb, as
the company moved into new headquarters on Edinburgh Park, where he emphasised
that industry health and safety standards would be maintained.
A total of 70 executives will meet, said Mr Robb, who deflected reaction to a
statement from the Scottish National Party that a referendum of local people at
Dounreay in Caithness had overwhelmingly rejected the prospect of American
nuclear waste coming to the plant.
The SNP is insisting that Scotland should not become a ``laundry'' for the
world's nuclear installations.
Chief executive Dr Robert Hawley said that re-processing was undertaken by
Sellafield, and would not be drawn on the Caithness issue.
British Energy, the holding company set up to privatise the advanced gas-cooled
reactor and pressurised water reactor assets of Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear, unveiled its new logo, aimed at symbolising a momentum of power.

AFTER 15 years at the helm of the Scottish Council Development and Industry,
Hamish Morrison is stepping down as its chief executive.
His resignation, announced yesterday at the SCDI's annual general meeting in
Glasgow, will not take effect immediately - Mr Morrison will stay on to supply
``an extra pair of hands'' while it prepares for its 26th International Forum,
which will be held at the end of March.
Alan Wilson will take over as chief executive. Mr Wilson joined in 1980 and is
currently serving as general manager and secretary.
Mr Morrison, 51, said he intended to spend the next two to three years working
as a self-employed consultant, after which he plans to start his own business
specialising in some aspect of economic development.
``The real reason for the change is that if I don't leave now, as the years go
by, it will get harder and harder to go,'' he said. ``The Scottish Council
isn't the sort of organisation that should be lumbered with the same leader
decade after decade.''
Most of Mr Morrison's remaining time with the SCDI will be devoted to preparing
for the 1996 Learning To Compete forum, which will be held in Perthshire.
One of the issues to be addressed at the forum is changing employment patterns
in Scotland.
The concern, Mr Morrison said, is that as many as 40% of Scotland's workers are
not in a permanent position with a standard labour contract. As full-time
tenured jobs have become scarcer, more and more people have had to settle for
temporary and part-time employment.
``The Scottish Council is very interested in this,'' he said. ``It is one of
the few organisations with enough breadth of represented interests to really
understand this phenomenon.''
Mr Morrison said one possible solution could be to focus more energy on
``neglected'' industries such as tourism, which have the potential to create
permanent indigenous employment. But other alternatives must also be considered
because many of Scotland's jobs are with multinational companies that are
unlikely to change their employment practices.
``I think we also need to look at changing the social security and tax systems
to help people that need to earn their living in this flexible way,'' Mr
Morrison said, ``because the people who are affected by this are becoming more
and more alienated from society.''

APPLE isn't the only computer company which started life in someone's garage.
Liam McKenna, who emerged last night as the 1995 winner of the televised
Business Game on Scottish, started in the same humble surroundings as Steven
Jobs.
But the McKenna garage, in Clarencefield near Dumfries, was not the launchpad
for some innovative approach to personal computing. Instead, the ideas first
hatched inside his lock-up helped answer a major issue nagging away at the
whole PC industry: What to with second-hand 286s nobody seems to want, or the
main manufacturers' production over-runs of last year's obsolete models?
The traditional answer is straight landfill or, at best, recovery of the memory
chips, precious metals from the circuitry and, possibly, some of the plastic
casing, followed by dumping of the remains. One estimate suggests 100,000
tonnes of electrical equipment is landfilled in the UK each year.
But landfill is about to get much more costly, thanks to Chancellor Clarke's #7
a tonne tax, announced in last month's Budget, and a growing raft of regulation
from Brussels which will prevent the more hazardous components, like
cathode-ray tubes, being dumped at all.
Rutherglen-born McKenna, who spent most of his career as an IBM executive
overseas, spotted his niche and pounced. His business - known as R.Frazier for
reasons which will be explained shortly - takes all those redundant and
obsolete computers, monitors and printers, and now telephones as well,
re-engineers them where necessary, and recycles them by selling them into those
parts of the world where the appetite for information technology is vast, but
this year's models are beyond most people's pockets.
From Vietnam and China to Zimbabwe and Colombia, he is finding ready markets
for de-badged but functional machines, by the hundred and thousand. From that
garage base, in just three years, R..Frazier has burgeoned into the former
McGeorge knitwear factory, 130,000sqft of space piled high with yesterday's
computers and phones, largely destined for new life and fresh uses all around
the globe. Only 5% of what arrives at the Irongray premises ends up as genuine
waste.
McKenna buys for as little as #20 a tonne, on the basis that he shares the
final resale profit with his suppliers. Thanks to a remarkable network of
contacts in key target markets, the fruit of more than 20 years on the Big Blue
payroll, he can turn that #20 of high-class scrap into as much as #13,500 of
resale business.
Turnover, which was less than #250,000 in the initial ``garage'' year, topped
#5m in year three and is projected at a remarkable #20m in year four. ``I
already know exactly where every pound of that will come from'' says McKenna,
with a grin. ``Of course things could go wrong, but I don't think they will.''
The inbound deals typically return between 50% and 75% of the profits to
suppliers, like BT, many of the biggest computer OEMs, and a host of large
commercial organisations re-equipping their own electronic infrastructure. ``We
make our money on the 25% to 50% we keep,'' says McKenna. ``And we're making
money. We're hugely profitable.''
R.Frazier is also expanding its operations. Last May, it opened a second
European base in Amsterdam, a joint venture with a Netherlands waste group.
Next month it will open a wholly-owned subsidiary in Malaysia. In the third
quarter of 1996, it will open another operation in New Zealand.
An associate company in the US has opened in Atlanta and San Jose, Costa Rica,
and is also looking at Austin, Texas. Some of these locations, like Penang in
Malaysia, are designed to be near the manufacturing plants, where the
production over-runs occur. Others, like New Zealand, are a conscious response
to strong resale markets, where the local culture values a functional bargain.
New Zealand, McKenna points out, is one of the biggest second-hand markets in
the world.
McKenna's career with IBM had taken him to Johannesburg, Paris, Brussels and
London. In 1991, at the age of 49, he took advantage of the restructuring
sweeping through the multinational and got himself a deal. ``I had always
wanted to get into business for myself. I had been director of marketing for
network services in Brussels. But, in a really big machine there are very few
really big cogs. When the scheme came along allowing management to depart on
good terms, I jumped at it.''
A friend in IBM had spotted an American, Randy Frazier, who had a plant in
Virginia recycling obsolete computers. ``They bought them in, sorted them and
sold them on. There was almost no re-engineering. But they were selling in very
big volumes.''
Initially, McKenna sold some of that Frazier kit from his garage. Then, with
Frazier as the only outside shareholder, using his IBM pension money, he
launched the company which won him last night's award, which is sponsored by
Bank of Scotland and Scottish Enterprise. His operation is now bigger than the
American role model.
``We decided to call it R.Frazier to give us an international image'' he says,
hinting that that's what gives a Scottish start-up the right kind of appeal to
enterprise support organisations. McKenna is far from complementary about the
way the banks treated his early appeals for modest funding support. ``We still
have no bank loans apart from on property. But, now that we're a success, they
are falling over themselves to lend us money'' he says.
One of the keys to McKenna is a two megabyte palmtop computer containing a vast
array of contacts around the world, gleaned from his years in IBM. ``It's
absolute drivel to say that you don't need to travel any more to do business.
You have to meet people across the table to strike deals.''
His own prodigious itinerary in the past year, from China and Australia to
Russia and Canada, would fell a man half his years. ``Doing business
internationally is not difficult, it's fun,'' he insists. With R.Frazier's
phenomenal growth, some of the 105 people who now work for him in Dumfries are
beginning to get their own taste of that excitement.
