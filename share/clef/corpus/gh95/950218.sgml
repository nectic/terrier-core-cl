Want to sell to the United States or get your message over to the
Japanese? Ninian Dunnett speaks to the people who specialise in raising
the profile of Scotland.
HOW does Scottish jewellery get on to a shopping channel on American
cable television, or Scottish heavy engineering into German industry, or
Scottish electronics expertise into the former Soviet Union? In the
increasingly competitive global economy, our businesses are punted
world-wide by a new breed of international Scots who fly the flag with
funding from Government agencies. While the Scottish Tourist Board
hustles the country's holiday attractions, Locate In Scotland's 90 staff
are working from offices in Stamford, Chicago, Houston, San Mateo,
Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Seoul, Munich, Zurich, and London
to persuade foreign companies of Scotland's merits as a business base.
At the same time, staff from Scottish Enterprise are travelling the
world -- often sharing the same offices -- selling our food and
textiles, electronics, software, and other goods and services. Like
Locate In Scotland's people, they are headquartered in the Scottish
Enterprise building in Glasgow's Bothwell Street.
Robert Crawford, 43, was North American director and then overall
director of Locate In Scotland before becoming the managing director of
Scottish Enterprise Operations.
R C: ''When I used to spend a lot of time in Japan, I remember in one
big company office on the wall behind the executives was a map of the
world. The irony was that this was published in Glasgow, this map, with
the Pacific Ocean in the middle, and up on the left hand corner by
Greenland and Iceland was the UK, and at the top of the UK was Scotland.
It focused my mind on what Scotland's place in the world might look like
if you're sitting in Osaka and considering investing in Europe.
''The competition is fierce, unquestionably. When an American company
recently advertised in the industrial press for a site oversees, they
got 350 applications from within the United States alone, and as many
more from countries and provinces abroad.
''We would tend to look at a company whose growth rate suggests they
are going to want to invest overseas, assess whether Scotland is going
to be competitive, and then target the executives who are likely to be
influential in their decision. When I was in the States, to get their
attention we sent out everything from a golf ball with a Scottish flag
on it to playing cards carrying statistical information about the
electronics industry in Scotland.
''Within Europe, there's no question that ourselves and the Irish are
miles ahead of everybody else in attracting American investment, which
is the most important. We have a much stronger market penetration and a
much stronger brand image than the English investment agencies --
Scotland's singular identity is a big advantage -- and we've been in
America longer. And Scotland has a very positive image; in American
history, Scots very quickly became part of the establishment in finance
and industry, and it became part of folk history that we are intelligent
and hard-working and honest. Which is profoundly helpful in our
business.''
David Taylor, 40, is the director of Scottish Trade International, the
export arm of Scottish Enterprise.
D T: ''It's much better than selling widgets, this. You actually feel
that it's a cause you're promoting -- the economic wellbeing of Scotland
-- and whichever word you use, I'm very pro-Scottish. It's the best job
in the world as far as I'm concerned.
''I reckon I've been to 20 or 30 countries in my time here; I haven't
actually counted, but I'm sure my wife has. We've hit record levels of
exports in the last year or two -- around #11 billion -- but computers,
electronics, and whisky account for just over 60% of that, and it's a
strategic issue for us to encourage companies to broaden the sector
base.
''Our research has come up with about six values associated with
Scottish products in Germany, the USA, and the Far East: quality,
integrity, authenticity, traditional, natural, and a craft-and-skill
sort of thing. And these are the sorts of images we can use to develop
co-ordinated marketing efforts. Of course we're not a Mars Bar, but we
can learn some things from brand marketing, and the interesting thing is
how far it will stretch; if you talk about 'integrity', for example,
that idea can help in terms of marketing financial services, or selling
education abroad. We're running a major campaign in Paris in March,
hopefully to demonstrate that the concept of Scotland as a brand can
work.''
Lorna Jack, 32, is the head of the food team at Scottish Enterprise,
charged with developing the food-processing sector.
L H: ''Compared to whisky, food is a much smaller picture -- #380m of
exports -- so we've got quite a way to go. We do probably one food
exhibition a month around the world, with maybe 50 companies under a
Scottish banner, and images of heather and hills and all that stuff. We
were just in Beijing, where the Chinese were quite uncertain about
smoked venison, but it's a new market, nobody really knows what the
opportunities are, or how we get in.
''There's a fair amount of travel involved, and sometimes I could give
that away. I think people sometimes think it's very glamorous travelling
to China, but when you go out there for four days and spend all your
time in an exhibition hall, you could be in Birmingham. But it's a
people-meeting job. That's the big payback for me.''

Boston boasts a fascinating combination of history and politics as
well as some amazing sights. And you can see it all, for as Tom
McConnell discovers, it's almost impossible to lose your way here.
A HEADY cocktail of history and politics makes Boston one of the most
fascinating cities in the United States: a place that saw the arrival of
some of the Pilgrim Fathers, heard the shots that sparked the American
War of Independence, and wept at the assassination of a famous son, the
35th President, John F Kennedy.
It is a city to be savoured at a leisurely pace along its unique
Freedom Trail, a red line about a foot wide painted on the sidewalk,
stretching for two-and-a-half miles from Boston Common right in the
heart of the city to Bunker Hill, across the Charles River, with its
220-foot monument commemorating the first major battle of the American
Revolution.
More so than any other major American city, Boston provides a gentle
introduction for the first-time visitor to the US. It is bold without
being brash, spectacular without being vulgar and, most important of
all, you never feel threatened as you walk around. Bostonians are cheery
and helpful, often volunteering assistance to visitors.
In addition to the red line -- a handy fail-safe if you lose your way
-- there is the ''T'', Boston's underground, one of the best if not the
best public transport systems in the States.
The four subway lines -- orange, red, blue, and green -- are easily
followed, convenient, clean, and reasonably priced. One journey costs
only 85 cents, but the best buy is undoubtedly the $18 seven-day
''tourist passport'' with unlimited travel on both subway and local
buses.
We went to Boston to visit our daughter and within hours of stepping
from the aircraft we had joined the Saturday-evening crowds in Quincy
Market Place enjoying a variety of street entertainment by jugglers on
monocycles and magicians, all of them with a slick line in patter.
Quincy Market and the adjoining 250-year-old Faneuil Hall, known as
''The Cradle of Liberty'' because of the fiery meetings held there which
helped to spawn the revolution, must be the most colourful and
atmospheric spot in the city.
It has a myriad of boutique-type handcarts offering everything from
costume jewellery to sweatshirts, and a food-hall, the likes of which
you've never seen, stacked from end to end with a tremendous variety of
mouth-watering takeaway snacks, from bagels to beef in a bun.
Add to this the surrounding department stores, open-air restaurants,
bistros and bars, multi-coloured balloons, and flowers. All this within
a few hundred yards of the centre of Boston and its harbour but
completely traffic-free.
Although jet-lagged and tired after a six-and-a-half-hour flight, we
were sufficiently captivated by the magic of the place to be drawn back
many times in the next 16 days.
Boston has a warm (sometimes oppressively humid) climate from May to
September which makes it ideal for open-air entertainment. We noticed
the Hatch Shell on the way in from the airport -- thousands of young
people were sitting on the grass enjoying a rock concert, completely
free of charge.
The Shell is a dome-shaped structure on the Esplanade, an open space
by the Charles River popular with cyclists, joggers, and roller-bladers.
It's the venue for all kinds of free concerts, almost every evening and
weekend afternoon throughout the summer.
Every inch of available space is taken up for the Fourth of July
extravaganza by the Boston Pops which ends with a fantastic fireworks'
display.
Another delight for those whose taste is for entertainment free,
spontaneous, and alfresco is Harvard Square, close to the university, on
the Cambridge side of the Charles.
It has a charm and a bustle similar to that of the Latin Quarter in
Paris or Dam Square in Amsterdam with top-class buskers competing for an
audience, back-to-back bookshops, theatres, cinemas, and museums all
packed into one square mile. At night, and especially when the students
are around, it has an atmosphere all of its own.
We found one of the best ways of getting to know Boston was to take a
trip on a trolley -- one of a fleet of quaint little tourist buses
resembling old-fashioned tramcars. You can hop on and off at any of 20
stops along the 90-minute route.
They do a pretty good job, not only stopping at all the historic
buildings and sites associated with the fight for independence, but also
at selected spots throughout the more modern parts of the city with its
cluster of handsome skyscrapers dominating the north end of the harbour
and to the west its parks, hotels, leafy avenues, elegant shopping
streets, and Victorian-style town houses.
We stopped off at Beacon Hill, an area of eighteenth and
nineteenth-century buildings, gas street-lights, cobblestones,
stained-glass windows, and narrow tree-lined side streets. Built by rich
merchants and professional men it is still the desirable place to live
and the ''real-estate'' prices prove it.
In Back Bay, an area reclaimed from the Charles over a 100 years ago
the streets are named alphabetically after English dukes and earls --
Arlington to Hereford -- but the most aristocratic of them all is not
included.
That is Newbury Street, a prince among Boston streets, eight
fashionable blocks, full of charm and style. Even a confirmed
non-shopper like myself, felt perfectly at ease exploring its art
galleries, basement boutiques, and record arcades, sandwich bars, classy
restaurants, and pavement-side cafes.
Its terraced brownstone buildings, once the homes of the rich and
privileged, are now occupied by some of the most exclusive stores in
America, mainland Europe, and the UK.
South of Newbury Street are the two tallest buildings in the city,
both with spectacular viewing decks -- the Prudential Tower with its
Skywalk, and the John Hancock Tower, a slim glass-fronted building which
sits cheek by jowl in Copley Square with the architecturally superb
nineteenth-century Trinity Church.
We chose the Hancock for no other reason than the Prudential Skywalk
was temporarily closed for renovation.
At 740 feet it is reputed to be the tallest building in New England
and from the 60th-floor observatory which we seemed to reach in a matter
of seconds there was a breathtaking perspective of the city, its
harbour, and much further afield the Berkshire Mountains, New Hampshire,
and Vermont.
For three dollars and a commentary by an architectural historian there
can be no better value -- anywhere.
Boston has many museums. We visited three: the Museum of Fine Arts,
the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the John F Kennedy Library and
Museum.
There is no denying the beauty of the priceless Renaissance and
Post-Impressionist paintings, sculptures, and tapestries in the Museum
of Fine Arts nor the magnificence of the fifteenth-century-style
Venetian palazzo and atrium which Mrs Gardner created to exhibit her
irreplaceable collection of European masterpieces and antique
furnishings.
It was, however, the John F Kennedy Library and Museum at Columbia
Point near the University of Massachusetts which left a lasting
impression. It is a striking eight-storey building, on an open site
facing the sea, built by private funds donated by millions of people and
given to the United States Government in 1979.
His life from the Democratic convention and presidential campaign in
1960 until his death in Dallas three years later is portrayed in
adjoining rooms using all the modern techniques of film, audiovision,
and video. The library administered by the National Archives includes
millions of documents, miles of film and thousands of photographs and
tapes, personal interviews and books which are available for educational
and research purposes.
Kennedy was born in the Brookline district of Boston and grew up there
and at the family home on Cape Cod. While the Senator for Massachusetts
he had a town house in Boston, and continued to have close ties with his
home city when in residence at the White House.
As you move around Boston you feel the influence of Jack Kennedy and
the Kennedy family is just as strong as that of the Puritan settlers
from England and the patriots who sowed the seeds of the revolution.

IF you see an owl flying by day it will certainly be a short-eared
owl. It will be on a moorland road or seaside links, beating its pale,
stiff wings as it rocks and yaws over the ground, hunting voles.
Sometimes one will fly very near and twist its mobile head to stare at
you with ferocious yellow eyes as it drifts past. It is not a bird you
can remain unaware of.
Yet in some years they are rare. The reason is voles: in four months
an owl can consume 2000, and if the population is low, the owls are
scarce. When vole numbers explode, the owls will raise more than one
brood.
In spite of these yellow eyes, they are hunting with their ears. Not
the short feather tufts that give them their very prosaic name, but
their real ears, extraordinarily acute and set asymmetrically on either
side of their facial disc of feathers.
This enables them to make fine judgments about the distance of their
prey by measuring the time lapse between the arrival of a mouse's squeak
at each ear.

The head of this sizeable Glasgow secondary walks the floor every day.
But this is no neurotic pacing, this is good management in action. And,
as George Hume discovers, pupils and parents are voting with their feet.
WHILE some seats of learning strive for gold-star status by employing
all that is state of the art and driven by the ubiquitous chip, at
Hyndland Secondary School in the very heart of Glasgow's red-tenement
land they simply turned back the clock to get results.
Introduced to a routine that today runs as smooth as the 08.05 from
Berne to Basle, the most formidable teaching tool ever to be unleashed
on impressionable young minds has hoist Hyndland Secondary in to that
small league of schools that everybody wants to be at -- pupils
included.
Hyndland head teacher Ken Goodwin calls his educational revolution M B
W A . . . not a minutely researched new initiative from the Scottish
Education Department but good old-fashioned factory-floor Management By
Wandering About, allowing even in these pressure-cooked times for the
head teacher of a modern school actually to be seen, every day, morning
and afternoon, by pupils and staff alike, spoken to by all, bearded by
the bold, consulted on every topic, or simply used as a pressure valve
for the safe release of steam.
According to Ken Goodwin -- steeled, he says, to cope with
disappointment by that great training ground in adversity that is the
lot of St Mirren FC supporters -- head-teachering is simply a matter of
smiling and writing one's signature: bolstered, of course, with a 7.30am
start behind his desk, two or three days a week late home from parents'
evenings and the like, 768 teenage egos to grapple with, 60 teaching
staff to manage, and, from April 1, a budget of #1.5m to administer . .
. for all of which he gets rather less than the #1817 taken home daily
by Sir Iain Vallance of BT.
Ken Goodwin's reward comes in the shape of 85% of his pupils electing
to stay on for fifth year and beyond. He says: ''Pupils here expect to
do well and are quite demanding. There is no lack of commitment to
education. The ethos is of co-operation and commitment -- pupils,
parents, and teachers. Relationships are good and that is the key. I am
not a neutral observer when it comes to Hyndland Secondary -- I am a fan
of this school.''
Also pleasing to Mr Goodwin and his staff is the desire of parents
from outwith the school's catchment area to send their children to
Hyndland Secondary. Already there are 165 placement requests for the
session that will start late this summer. With 100 children identified
as new intake pupils from the school's catchment area, and with only 110
additional desks available, there is going to be disappointment.
What draws parents from outwith the Hyndland, Govan, Yoker, Whiteinch,
Partick catchment -- itself a roll-call of Glasgow's industrial past?
Some children travel in daily from as far out as Blantyre. Other than
the general ethos of the school, a main factor, believes Mr Goodwin, is
the social mix. ''We have the sons and daughters of university
professors here as well as the sons and daughters of those who used to
be employed in just these heavy industries for which the area was
famous. It is a great mix.
''Our parents are a very strong part of the school -- always willing
to support and work to improve what we have here. We do not set out to
make a great public thing of it but I suppose we are seen to be doing
pretty well by our pupils,'' says Mr Goodwin.
Of the pupils themselves Mr Goodwin, the last Glasgow head teacher to
be appointed by the education authority alone before school governors
were given a hand in the matter, is in no doubt. ''I have been teaching
for 24 years and, now as then, the vast majority of pupils are great.
Certainly I notice greater openness and less sense of them and us. But
there is more stress on youngsters -- the amount and variety of things
they are expected to do. What we expect from youngsters is more
demanding.''
So just how does Management By Wandering About function? Ken Goodwin
has set his thoughts down on paper and circulated his self-imposed
regime for the information of senior staff. MBWA is, he says, the art of
informal monitoring which he exercises by being at the entrance of the
school as the pupils enter ''with words of welcome and encouragement'',
by being visible at the period change-overs, in the playground at
morning intervals, apparent at lunchtime, and a kent face at the school
exits at 3.30 each day.
In addition Ken Goodwin visits one class in each year group every week
to ask pupils what and how they are doing, examine jotters, homework
diaries, observe the class at work, and listen to the teacher's views on
class progress. Monthly meetings -- formal and informal -- are held with
principal teachers, at least one pupil in each year-group is tracked for
a whole schoolday at least once a session, bad news is delivered in
person, four positive statements are made every day, and daily
conversations are held with at least one pupil and one member of staff
''about nothing in particular''.
But with all that walking about, mingling and encouraging, smiling and
signing, there is no time for teaching. Modern head teachers, it seems,
are a contradiction in terms for teaching is what they virtually never
do. Ken Goodwin has been in charge at Hyndland Secondary for five years
and smiles when he ponders the few occasions when he is required to get
up in front of a class and do his stuff.
''It is a very rare and luxurious experience -- for me if not for
them,'' he says. ''There was a time in my career when I realised that it
had to be either management or teaching. There is no resentment that I
no longer have the opportunity to teach -- just a great sense of
nostalgia.''
While the hum of study sounds through Hyndland Secondary and Ken
Goodwin's peripatetic progress through corridor and class is temporarily
suspended there is no let-up. A mother and son have to be seen -- the
lad looks glum but no hint is to be had of what passed behind closed
doors -- and an official from the education department's headquarters
calls to talk briefly about April 1 when DMR takes on a life of its own
. . . help provided by an AFA. DMR and AFA? Delegated Management of
Resources is the scheme under which head teachers will be responsible
for the financial affairs of their schools, helped by an Administrative
and Financial Assistant. As they would say in the maths class -- QED.
In Hyndland Secondary's case the money that will be available to spend
on staff, buildings, resources and whatever else may be necessary will
run out at around #1.5m during the next financial year. This new
administrative burden will not, believes Ken Goodwin, take up an
inordinate amount of time. He already occasionally recites -- Buildings,
Budgets, People -- and says of DMR: ''I am looking forward to it with
neither pleasure nor anxiety.''
On the day I went back to school at Hyndland Secondary word ran
rapidly through the staff that Young Partick were at the gates --
literally. Teachers mingling in the streets was the safety course
carried through at the end of classes.Says Mr Goodwin: ''It is a wise
school that pays attention to discipline and the promotion of positive
attitudes. Our neighbours are not slow at letting us know if they have
complaints and rightly so. Obviously we want to have good relations with
our neighbours and we pay attention to what they say. Some of the staff
here are out in the streets at lunchtime . . . seeing and being seen.''
Mr Goodwin, Paisley-raised and now living with his wife, daughter, and
two sons in Dumbarton, enjoys a high turn-out of parents at the many
evenings held each term to keep in touch, report progress, and air
concerns. ''One hundred and thirty children out of 165 were represented
at a recent parents' evening -- that is 79%'', a sum quickly worked out
by the man who used to make his living teaching maths.
''The beauty of the job is that no two days are the same although I
try to impose a rhythm,'' says Mr Goodwin before setting off for a
meeting with pupil members of the Senior Council. All possible subjects
are given open forum . . . invigilators talking during prelims, the
basketball club, a passionate move to admit third-year pupils to
seniors' privileged space when the weather is cold, positive behaviour
incentives (held by some to be uncalled for), a request for help with
coffee and buns at a parents' evening (graciously given), the cost of
engaging The Ultimate Buzz to provide music at a social evening . . .
all you ever wanted to know about school life in the 1990s but never
dared to ask.
Back in what used to be referred to in Scottish schools as ''the
killing hoose'' but now simply the head teacher's office, it is time to
pay attention to an impending Industrial Awareness Day, timetabling,
work experience opportunities, prepare for a monthly union meeting with
staff, collect papers for a science department meeting later in the day,
and talk about drugs and bullying.
''Drugs: touch wood, little happens in school. But in the community?''
A shrug and a worried frown. ''As for bullying, well, that is
interesting. We have paid a lot of attention to that and, until
recently, had it as a hard-and-fast rule in our anti-bullying campaign
'don't hit back'. We were quickly told by the pupils about the real
world, that sometimes that is simply not possible, and that rule has now
been amended to 'stand up for yourself without resorting to violence'.
But, really, there is little violence: name-calling is the most common
type of bullying.''
Seventy of the schools' pupils (8%, says Mr Goodwin without resort to
a calculator) are Asians, for whom a rest and prayer room is set aside
during Ramadan. No racial tension is evident, although one young man on
the Senior Council was at pains to assure me of unrelenting daily bias
against Muslims in all sectors of the Scottish media.
A senior management team meeting is held as a prelude to lunch -- and,
apparently, no less palatable -- computers to deal with the impending
onset of financial responsibility are explained, discussed, and an order
placed. On the wall behind the headmaster's desk is the jokey slogan:
''I will act as if what I do makes a difference.'' It is a nice
one-liner but no-one at Hyndland Secondary who has met the head teacher
managing by wandering about believes a word of it.

Militant protests by Islamic students recently focused attention once
more on Afghanistan's continuing conflict. But, as a slow-moving peace
process rumbles on there, one Scots couple are still fighting -- against
leprosy and disease. The work often finds health educator Mary Dunlop
far apart from her husband Jon, programme controller and a leprosy
paramedic, but the new challenges allow Mary and their young son to play
active roles in their community.
WE HAVE settled in quite well, David aged three and I, in what is home
for the next few months. We share a room in the clinic -- bare,
mud-walled bathroom attached. The loo, a hole in the ground 100 yards
away, has stupendous views of mountains and blue skies but the sackcloth
door, full of holes, allows only an illusion of privacy. I feel rather
insecure as I enjoy privacy when answering nature's calls and my warning
cough did nothing to prevent a woman joining me as I squatted there one
day. She had felt shy to tell ''Dr'' Jawad the true nature of her
complaint and wanted me to exchange the aspirin he had prescribed for a
non-existent headache for something to cure a vaginal itch.
David plays with the village children and also makes daily social
calls -- to Agha who provides him with fresh yoghurt, to Gul Tamam who
can be counted on to fry him an egg whenever he feels peckish. He rides
horses and donkeys, feeds calves, and plays with baby goats --
ecstatically happy.
I have stopped reaching for a light switch when it becomes dark but
haven't yet mastered the subtleties of lighting the pressure lamp. I no
longer try to flush the loo.
There are 13 women in the training course. From panicking that no-one
would turn up I am now rather daunted by their high expectations. With
the exception of Ura who can read a little, all the women are illiterate
but their doubts regarding their abilities to learn and remember are
groundless. They are very clever and forget nothing -- possibly the
result of being able to recite the whole of the Koran.
Some of the local customs make one's hair stand on end. For instance,
the custom of perez, loosely translated as fasting, appears to be an
attempt to starve out the sickness. A person who is ill, even with
something as mundane as a cold, is forbidden to eat certain foods. In
practice it is often carried to extremes with nothing allowed except
weak tea and a little dry bread until the patient becomes so weak he or
she falls prey to more serious infections -- and in small children with
diarrhoea it can lead frighteningly swiftly to death.
Cooking oil which has been boiled is considered a good cure for
diarrhoea and one mother had been advised to kill a chicken to help her
sick son -- after giving him the chicken's saliva to swallow!
How do even half the children make it past their fifth birthday? Only
one woman in class has not suffered the loss of a child in infancy. Many
have had babies die from tetanus, which they call tars, meaning fear,
because the baby's pre-death spasms make them believe he is dying of
fright.
The women are enthusiastic students with a keen, sometimes bawdy,
sense of humour which forced my translator, Jawad, to disappear during a
lesson on birth spacing. This left yours truly struggling to explain,
with the aid of a broom handle, that a condom cannot be fitted correctly
if it has first been blown up like a balloon or stretched out to its
full extent and snapped like a rubber band.
Weekends at Jawad's home village are a mixture of strenuous walks in
the mountains and hours of gossip among the women. By the time we rise
on Friday morning Payish, who declares she is a lady of leisure with
grown-up sons and daughters to do the work, has fed and milked the cows,
lit the fire in the tandoor (an earthen oven sunk into the floor), and
baked bread for 12 people, fetched water from the spring and made the
tea. When she sits to talk she busily spins wool from a hank round her
wrist.
Her oldest daughter, Najiba, does the cooking, tears streaming from
her red-rimmed eyes from the smoke billowing around the kitchen. The
stove is a mud platform under which a wood fire burns. A hole in the
roof allows only some of the blinding smoke to escape. Perhaps Najiba's
reddened eyes are party caused by her recent engagement to a man she
detests. Not finding the courage to tell her father how she felt, she
agreed to the engagement and now fervently hopes that her fiance will
never return from Iran where he went to earn some money.
I committed a faux pas at lunch. David's spoon was covered in rice so
I wiped it with a tiny piece of nan before he ate his yoghurt. It would
have been all right if I had eaten the nan but I laid it to one side and
was soundly scolded by Moh'd Amir, the clinic's cook, for showing such
disrespect to the bread. Respect for bread includes never placing it
directly on the floor, never discarding it, and always wrapping it in a
cloth. To my knowledge this cloth is never washed and I was tempted to
mention that wrapping the bread in such a germ-laden rag was surely more
disrespectful to both it and the gastric systems of all who eat it but,
thoroughly embarrassed, I mumbled an apology and yelled at David to eat
his yoghurt.
I didn't, however, threaten him with the bogyman. They do have one
here but he is a she called Al Khatoon -- a dreadful creature with her
feet put on backwards and big, big eyes. Grown men will not go out on
the mountains after dark in case they catch a glimpse of Al Khatoon
sitting combing her long, black hair which reaches almost to the ground.
I was walking with Fatima along a path bordering a small stream, whose
banks are lush with alaf, fodder for the animals. There was purple
vetch, clover, cow's parsley, golden yellow trefoil all riotously
jumbled together next to huge clumps of wild mint and fragrant thyme --
like it used to be at home. Fatima pointed. ''Over there,'' she
remarked, ''lives Al Khatoon.''
''Who is she?'' I queried, thinking of recruits for the training
course. Fatima described the dangerously beautiful apparition who walks
the hills at night, luring unfortunate men to their fate. Some are
struck dumb or blind, some die. What struck me most was Fatima's quiet
conviction that Al Khatoon was fact not fantasy, not a bogyman story for
children but an example of the hazards, such as plagues of grasshoppers
destroying the crops or a high infant-mortality rate, one faces in rural
Afghanistan.
Intrigued, I asked others about Al Khatoon, discovering that nearly
everyone believed in and feared her. There are slight regional
variations in her appearance -- such as having, in one area, her eyes
positioned vertically, while in another she is endowed with enormous
breasts (Dolly Parton eat your heart out) -- with which she suffocates
her victims. Some laughed at my questions but mostly it was a shamefaced
laugh as men who knew logically that there was no Al Khatoon
uncomfortably, and unsuccessfully, tried to dismiss the
bowels-turning-to-water fear they knew if out alone after dark.
I even met a man who claimed to have seen Al Khatoon. Nothing about
this ex-mujahid, freedom fighter, now farmer, gave the impression that
he was a fanciful man. ''I was on night patrol and the commander warned
us that we were near where Al Khatoon walks. It was just after one
o'clock when I saw her; sitting on a wall combing her hair which was
long and loose. She was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen but I
turned and ran and when I looked back she had gone.''
Someone laughed. The man glared at him, looking truculent. ''It is
true. I saw her and the soldier with me saw her too. If we had taken
another step she would have seen and trapped us.''
The man will never be shaken from his belief that he witnessed, and
escaped, Al Khatoon, but before you laugh, dismissing it as
superstitious nonsense, there is a tale even stranger than the
ex-soldier's.
Jawad at the clinic told me the story. ''Ali Gul was a healthy man,
not yet 40, when he attended a funeral. The custom here is for the men
to read prayers for the dead all night by the graveside. At some point
he went to the well for water. When he returned he seemed nervous,
asking if anyone else had come from the well. No-one had been seen and
no-one else had left the grave.
''He became even more nervous, saying that when he reached the well he
thought someone was there but when he gave a greeting there was no
reply. He looked around, not seeing anyone, but convinced there was
someone or something walking beside him back to the graveside. Everyone
tried to convince him he was imagining it but he became more and more
afraid, maintaining that it was a sign that he would be the next to be
buried.
''He went home and started to complain of pains all over his body.
Someone sent for me. I examined him thoroughly but could find nothing
wrong. He died the next day.''
Although Al Khatoon only appears to men I don't mock the believers.
And since being told that she only gets people who are not afraid of her
I don't linger to star-gaze when visiting the loo after dark.
Rivalling Al Khatoon in malevolence are nasty, invisible little
creatures called djinn. Not only causing sickness, they can make the
cow's milk dry up, the dinner burn, or give a nasty jab with a sewing
needle. No mishap cannot be blamed on djinn -- unless it is the result
of the ''evil eye'' which is a different kettle of superstition all
together.
Misfortunes caused by djinn befall everyone indiscriminately; the evil
eye results from jealousy of others' good fortune. For instance, a
farmer's wife gave birth to twin boys. Sons are highly prized here, so
to get two at once was considered a real bonus. Everyone discussed how
lucky Moh'd Amir was until almost his entire, newly harvested, wheat
crop was lost in a blazing fire. This was definitely the evil eye, cast
on Moh'd Amir as a result of all the good wishes being showered on him
and his family. The fact that a hurricane lamp left forgotten on the
threshing ground had blown over was neither here nor there -- someone
had been listening jealously and turned the evil eye in his direction.
Young Zahir had spent a day cutting butta (a bush used as fuel) on the
mountain. As he struggled homeward under a load taller than himself a
neighbour remarked to his mother on what a fine, strong lad he was and,
without thinking, his proud mother agreed. Next day Zahir fell and broke
his leg. The evil eye for sure; and his mother, 20 years later, is still
not speaking to her neighbour.
The Koran contains references to djinn and what is written there is
unarguable fact. Mullahs can provide protection from them by selling
tawiz, verses from the Koran sewn into little cloth pouches which are
worn as a talisman. Almost everyone wears one -- as do many horses,
cows, even sheep.
I feared teaching that bacteria, not djinn, cause illness might be
difficult. Surprisingly, the women were receptive to the idea that
things called germs were all around us -- things which like to live in
dirty places such as the mounds of human turds outside every house,
hitching lifts on the sticky feet of flies who deposit them neatly on
the nan we eat. They nodded in agreement when told that germs are more
dangerous to the very young, the weak, and the old. They already knew of
the existence of invisible nasties -- they call them djinn and if a
foreigner wants to call them something different that is fine -- they
need to know if the foreigner had any new ideas on protection.
A description of how the judicious use of soap can mean death to
bacteria disappointed them until we tried it and saw with fascinated
horror the mucky water streaming off our hands. The women left class
discussing how to persuade their husbands to buy soap.
Difficulties arose during nutrition classes. Breast is best -- no
problems there, but not for the first three days because, they assured
me, the colostrum is harmful. So, baby starves or is given sweet black
tea or, worse, sugar and oil to ensure sweetness and strength. ''But the
colostrum from a newly calved cow is a great delicacy,'' I pointed out,
having once had the dubious pleasure of being offered this treat. ''Yes
indeed,'' came the reply, ''but we don't give it to the calf -- or to
babies.''
They agreed with demand feeding too -- well, almost. It is not allowed
when mother is drinking tea as this would over-heat her milk. Or, if the
mother has been outside when the weather is cold, hungry baby must wait
until the milk has warmed up again. Basma was the most sceptical about
my declaration that breast milk is always the same, perfectly regulated,
temperature. I finally suggested she test the milk herself. She downed
two glasses of scalding tea and a few tense moments followed as she
expressed some milk into the palm of her hand. I half expected to see
her wince as the milk gushed out, scalding hot. She tasted it. ''Oh, it
is only just warm,'' she admitted in a surprised tone. The other
students roared with laughter and that battle was won.
As for the colostrum -- well, they did admit it seemed silly for Allah
to have gone to all that trouble if it was harmful -- and David seemed
none the worse for having drunk the stuff.
When I suggested mashed potato as a suitable first weaning food there
were outraged protests. ''You can't give potatoes to babies -- their
digestion will be destroyed.'' And cooking-oil by the tablespoon is
quite all right, is it?
Not only was the potato an unfit food for infants, so too were most
vegetables, cow's milk, meat, chicken, and eggs. Eggs must never be
given to a child before it can talk or it will develop a speech defect
-- they don't need Edwina Currie to talk about rotten eggs in
Afghanistan.
My  teaching manual extols the virtue of bananas as a weaning food --
high nutritional content, ease of preparation, acceptable to all but the
most contrary of children. My students have never seen a banana. The
only fruit is dried apricots in the bazaar so we are going to mash them
up with yoghurt to try on Basma's baby.
These women, like mothers the world over, want their children to grow
up healthy and strong and they are still listening, always asking,
always wanting to know more -- even if they sometimes think the
foreigner has some pretty strange ideas about health.

THE history of that venerable Scottish institution, the pub crawl, is
a long and, I'm tempted to say, staggering one. Basically an urban
phenomenon (alcoholic hikes along wind-blasted glens between wayside
inns are not recommended without triple thermals), the crawl has lost a
bit of momentum in the past few decades, redevelopment seeing many a
couthy corner bar sent crashing under the demolisher's hammer (pause for
sob).
In my home town of Clydebank (always a drouthy burgh), for instance,
from the city boundary at Yoker to the west, there was a murderous mile
of public houses all the way to the foot of Kilbowie Road. Watering
holes such as the Cunard, the Bisley Bar, and the Seven Seas are but
memories -- some lamented, a few we're well shot of.
Perhaps the most famous crawl of the current era centres on Rose
Street in Edinburgh, tucked away discreetly behind the fancy Princes
Street shops. I suppose this promenade of pubs might be a bit twee
alongside the spit-and-sawdust establishments of yesteryear, but they
provide a challenge none the less.
One correspondent of this column who raised the topic insists that the
pub crawl must have its origins in the custom of Roman legionaries
trekking along the Antonine Wall from Grangemouth to Old Kilpatrick,
stopping off for a refreshment at each wee fort. I fear, Mr Irvine, that
you have been partaking over-liberally of the old mead of Caledon. It's
a nice idea, but I know for a fact that nobody in Duntocher gets served
wearing either club colours or battledress.
The most interesting early pub crawl account I've uncovered dates from
the late 1700s and concerns a fascinating individual, the historian
Gilbert Stuart, who spent his life slagging academics he imagined had
done him a disservice.
Although his family planned a career in law for young Gilbert, the
bold lad preferred the sort of bar that echoed to clinking glasses, good
cheer, and the companionship of sporty ladies. He saw himself as an
author, and an early effort, Historical Dissertation, concerning the
English constitution (light reading in those days), enabled him to swan
off to London for a decade.
Back in Edinburgh it became clear that he took his pleasures as
seriously as his penmanship. One story in particular illustrates the
sort of lifestyle that Stuart enjoyed and in which the mobile booze-up
figures prominently. Stuart and his mates set off on a momentous
''ramble of dissipation'' as it was quaintly styled in the eighteenth
century.
His biographer tells us: ''Accompanied by several boon companions, Dr
Stuart is said to have taken several days to travel on foot between the
Cross of Edinburgh and Musselburgh -- a distance of only six miles,
stopping at every public house by the way where decent ale could be
found.''
Apparently, Stuart's pals on this strange expedition were kept going
by his wit, but, tired and emotional, they gradually fell by the
wayside. The last of these companions began his return to Edinburgh from
the Magdalen Bridge within a mile of Musselburgh, but ''oppressed by
fumes of ale'' staggered into the pit of a steam engine and fell asleep.
We're told: ''On awakening before day he beheld the mouth of an
immense fiery furnace . . . several figures, all grim with soot and
ashes, were stirring the fire . . . while there was a terrible clanking
of chains.'' Horror-stricken, the boozer imagined he was at the Gates of
Hell. Ah, the demon drink.

Knowing what to take and what not to causes problems. But, finds
Kirsty Scott, most of us are quite clear about who we'd happily leave
behind.
WELL, would you? Have you? Could you? You did what?! According to a
recent survey, former Cabinet minister David Mellor is the least
desirable travelling companion for holidaymakers. Nearly half (43%) of
those questioned chose the ex-Heritage Secretary as the person they
would most wish to avoid journeying with.
Other undesirable travelling companions included Adam Woodyatt (Ian
Beale in EastEnders), travel presenter Judith Chalmers, and supermodel
Naomi Campbell.
The survey from the independent travel specialists STA Travel also
found that:
* 43% of holidaymakers confessed to losing their virginity while on
holiday
* 61% said they would visit a red-light district abroad -- out of
curiosity
* Nearly 75% felt five glasses of beer or wine a day was a moderate
amount to drink while away
* 10% admitted smuggling alcohol through Customs
* Nearly 40% named Calais as the most boring holiday destination
followed by Luxembourg, Detroit, and Belgium
* 19% have stopped sunbathing because of skin-cancer worries and 40%
wore high-protection suntan lotion.
* THE 1990s have become the decade of the independent traveller,
according to travel expert Simon Beeching.
Beeching, managing director of Wexas, the UK's leading travel club for
independent and business travellers, says the growth in demand for
independent holidays is set to continue this year.
''What is fuelling the continuing growth of the overseas travel market
is not package holidays. It is the people doing it themselves,'' he
said. ''Package holidays are still a huge and great value-for-money
market, but independent travel is now outstripping it.''
One of the reasons for the increase in independent travel is the fact
that we are now far more experienced, he said. ''To jump on a plane to
travel to Europe is a bit like travelling on a bus. There isn't anything
special about it. People are now prepared to travel much further
afield.''
For some travellers even trips to places such as Thailand and
Australia are no longer out of the ordinary. They want to look even
further afield and also at special-interest holidays -- dolphin-tagging
in Florida, for example.
''This is a great holiday for some people -- a change is as good as a
rest. They want something more than just lying on a beach.
''Even if they take an ordinary holiday, they are asking, 'Is there
tennis, is there windsurfing?' ''
Wexas honorary presidents include Professor David Bellamy, Clare
Francis, Robin Hanbury-Tenison -- the explorer, writer, and campaigner
for tribal peoples -- and Colonel John Blashford-Snell -- the explorer
and founder of Operation Raleigh. Blashford-Snell's favourite mode of
transport is elephants. And when he goes away he always takes a Swiss
army knife: ''It's invaluable for everything -- taking thorns out of an
elephant's foot, hacking through the jungle, opening a can of beans,
repairing things. I'd never travel without it.''

* BLACKPOOL has declared UDI and is going solo. The seaside resort has
renamed itself the Principality of Fun and has appointed Judith Chalmers
as a minister for tourism. A new ''national anthem'' has been composed
and a Charter of Fun looks forward to more bank holidays and abolition
of VAT for tourists.
The bid for independence is all tongue-in-cheek but it shows that the
town's tourist chiefs have some serious ideas about the current British
tourism scene.
The independence declaration was made from the steps of the town hall
and was inspired by a Mori poll showing that 52% of Britons now holiday
overseas. In a burst of bravura, the town council announced UDI and sent
faxes to the Queen, John Major, the UN, the EC, and even President
Clinton, informing them of the momentous decision.
The Queen was assured that Blackpool wished to remain part of the
Commonwealth; the Prime Minister was told that the resort would be
marketing itself as an overseas destination; and the UN was asked to
make ready a flagpole for the principality's new flag to fly outside its
building in New York. Blackpool asked Brussels for EC funding and
President Clinton for protection, should the fledgeling principality
come under attack. The new principality also called for all-day Sunday
pub licensing as part of its Charter.
Seventeen million visitors a year, more than go to the whole of Greece
and the Greek Islands put together, visit Blackpool every year. The
Pleasure Beach is Britain's number-one free tourist attraction and
enjoyed a record-breaking 1994 season. Blackpool Tower had a 10% rise in
visitors last summer and is planning to open throughout the winter at
weekends.
Meanwhile, Blackpool has just received the 1995 Egon Ronay Cellnet
Leisure Attraction of the Year, the first time this has been presented
to an entire town. For latest literature on Blackpool holidays write to
1 Clifton Street, Blackpool, FY1 1LY (0253 25212).
* THE recently created Tourism Development Fund is supporting five new
arts seasons in Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Southampton, and the
Yorkshire region during 1995, following the success of last year's
London Arts Season.
Backed by the English Tourist Board, these seasons will bring together
the regional tourist boards, local authorities, and arts organisations.
The plan is to add value to existing art and cultural activity during
periods where hotel occupancies are below average. Activities will be
packaged to appeal to consumers and the travel trade and will include
backstage tours, cast parties, and privileged access to events and
exhibitions.
The seasons are an important part of the 1995 Festival of Arts and
Culture and the fund is investing nearly #300,000 on the campaign. The
first projects to receive cash from the fund were last autumn's
short-breaks advertising campaign and a scheme to improve quality
standards at caravan holiday parks.

AS TOMORROW night's edition of Scottish Television's Time of Your Life
underlines, 1986 was a year scarred by global gloom of a particularly
dark hue. For one thing, the Soviet Union's malfunctioning Chernobyl
nuclear reactor cast a literally funereal pall over much of eastern and
central Europe.
For another, a state of emergency was declared amid major unrest in
the townships of South Africa. And live on TV, with terrible and graphic
immediacy, the United States space shuttle Challenger disintegrated into
smoking trails of debris shortly after take-off, killing all the
astronauts on board.
In Britain, there was much upheaval centred on the newspaper industry.
While employers preferred to speak of ''the long-term cost benefits
incurred by changes to the traditional pattern of employment'',
disenfranchised ex-employees spoke of Rupert Murdoch's theft of their
jobs.
Whatever your view, the short-term results included brutal riots in
London, outside News International's new razor-wired production plant in
Wapping, involving police and pickets. In Glasgow, meanwhile, most of
the workforce of the Daily Record were suddenly informed by their new
proprietor, Robert Maxwell, that they were surplus to requirements.
Small wonder, then, that scepticism greeted Maxwell's self-proclaimed
status as saviour of Edinburgh's boycott-riven and financially
distressed Commonwealth Games later in the summer. Also in Glasgow,
students took to the streets in sit-down protest at the imposition of
swingeing fees for higher education.
Where to look for light relief? To 1986's charts, which were enlivened
by the swaggering emergence of Love and Money with Candybar Express;
uplifted by the Communards' anthemic Hi-NRG remake of Don't Leave Me
This Way; and mildly diverted by Owen Paul's You're my Favourite Waste
of Time.
There was further joy to be derived from football, perhaps. There was
certainly widespread halloo'ing when Kenny Dalglish won his 100th
Scottish cap . . . and much disgust when Graeme Souness began his reign
as Rangers' player-manager by being sent off for hacking a lump out of
George McCluskey's leg when Rangers met Hibernian at Easter Road. Graeme
Souness, Chernobyl, mass unrest: some aspects of 1986 were plainly
destined for one another.

Forsaking the safety of the truck on safari is usually not a good
idea. But, just this once, Jill Crawshaw can't recommend it highly
enough.
IT WAS an encounter of the closest kind; out of the heat and dust of
Africa, the great bull elephant padded like a grey ghost through a
desiccated landscape. Fifty yards, 40, 30 . . . he was making tracks for
the few shrivelled green leaves of the mopan, the bush they call the
''lifesaver'', particularly apt in October, the ''suicide'' month before
the rains come.
The problem was that our little group was directly in his path, albeit
circumspectly, downwind of him. Fifteen yards . . . 10 . . . , our guide
Dean, his Winchester rifle still cradled in his arms, sensed our
apprehension, stood up, and waved the great beast away, though gently,
using the Shona diminutive ''Away zhou!'' Huge ears flapping, the
elephant pirouetted and as neatly and delicately as a ballet-dancer,
disappeared into the bush to join the other grey shadows looming on the
horizon.
''He was completely unaware of our existence, and wouldn't hurt us,''
Dean assured us. ''I could tell by his tear ducts and the lazy way he
was ambling . . . ''
After many experiences on safari in East Africa, where you are
strictly instructed never on any account to leave your vehicle, the idea
of walking into a wilderness noted for its predators seemed to defy all
normal conventions. But as Graeme Lemon and Dean McGregor, two of the
professional guides licensed to escort small groups on foot into the
rugged and isolated Matusadona National Park on the southern shores of
Lake Kariba, liked to joke: ''We've never lost one yet''.
And so for three days, and probably the most exciting and
adrenalin-producing experiences of our lives, six of us, British,
middle-aged, and only moderately fit suburbanites, set out before dawn
every morning and before sunset every evening, to explore, to note, to
watch quietly, to travel and understand just a little bit more about the
hidden wonders of Africa.
The thrill of identifying from its footprints whether an animal is
relaxed or disturbed, whether its spoor is light, and therefore fresh,
becomes immediately urgent when one is likely to encounter its owner
behind the next part of the bush. Most accidents are caused by
unescorted or ignorant tourists blundering into cantankerous water
buffalo, or by blocking the paths of the hippos on their way to and from
water.
But a walking safari isn't just about the big mammals.It's about the
unforgettable brilliance of African mornings as the mist rolls off the
red earth. It's about the birds -- tiny flying jewels, the carmine
bee-eaters, or the gaudy lilac-breasted rollers that loop the loop to
show off to their mates, the dark eagles and vultures sculpted on to the
top of the bare skeleton of a tree.
It's about the crispy bacon and eggs and the coffee waiting for us
after our three-hour walk each morning, and the gin and tonics by the
crackling log fire each evening as the sky turns silver and gold to
fiery red, then jet-black, and it's time to zip ourselves into our tents
for the night, with the low, throaty roars of the lions nearby, and the
strange and distinctive whoops of a prowling hyena.
Graeme Lemon started his walking safaris two years ago to give
tourists a taste of real Africa they could never hope to experience on
the more familiar minibus tours. They are miracles of organisation and
improvisation; a canvas bucket provides hot showers; a portable WC is
carried from the jeep to each site. A well-stocked bar is set up by the
camp-fire, while a team of cooks produce three-course meals with wine
from a makeshift stove beside the dried-up riverbed.
They're just one of a variety of holiday experiences offered in
Zimbabwe and other parts of Africa by specialist tour operator Africa
Exclusive, who will also organise horse-riding safaris or whitewater
rafting, photo tours or canoeing down the Zambezi. Because numbers and
groups are small, itineraries are tailor-made and flexible.
Unsuitable for the mass tourism of some of its neighbours, where there
are all too often too many minibuses chasing too few animals, and
lacking only a coast (which may turn out a blessing in disguise),
Zimbabwe has nevertheless a number of selling points that can make it
one of the most successful holiday destinations in Africa. Tedious
money-changing and airport procedures have already been abandoned since
I was last there three years ago; not least, visitors feel a sense of
security and welcome, all the more astonishing because it is only 15
years since the bitter struggles that accompanied the founding of this
fledgeling republic, and less than that since civil war was threatening
to tear this new country apart.
And if the sheer physical beauty of the country cannot fail to thrill,
there are other, perhaps more mundane bonuses vital for a tourist
industry. Things work -- communications and transport systems; the
standard of accommodation is high and reasonably priced; service is
pleasant, willing, and efficient. With so many African countries
tottering on the brink of chaos, in Zimbabwe there's a quiet hope for a
future in which tourism can play a major part.
The owners of one of the most enchanting small hotels I've ever
visited, John and Charlotte Ford, have demonstrated their faith and
enthusiasm for the country of their birth by selling up their house and
business in London to open up the Imba Matombo Lodge on the outskirts of
Harare.
Guests sip passion-fruit juice by the pool, gazing over the
jacaranda-lined avenues where the gauzy plains begin. And as in all the
small and friendly lodges, they organise guests' trips -- in our case to
the capital, which is gentle, unhurried, and pleasant with its wide
avenues and shaded parks, well-stocked shops and a National Gallery of
stupendous Shona sculptures.
If Harare is one of Zimbabwe's low-key assets, the Victoria Falls are
one of the genuine Wonders of the Tourist World. The sheer build-up
heightens your expectation; seen miles away from a plane, a giant cloud
of spray rises high into the sky, and a dark green stain slashes the
scorched landscape.
The statistics too are pretty giant; the falls are just over a mile
wide, with a million gallons of water pouring over them every five
seconds. When David Livingstone tried to measure their depth with a line
tied to a bullet, it ran out at 90 metres -- nearly eight metres short.
As yet, this African wonder in the natural habitat of the Victoria
Falls National Park is blessedly free of touts, hamburger stalls,
honky-tonk, even guard-rails, so that you can gaze in awe and solitude
in what is really just a simple geological fault -- but still as
humbling as when in 1855 Livingstone paddled along the Zambezi River in
a dugout canoe and named the falls after his Queen. Some may think that
the original local name, Mosioa Tunya, ''the smoke that thunders'' is
more apt.
Your first sight of the Zambezi above the falls is one of a lazy river
meandering so innocently that you feel like taking a dip, until it
suddenly plunges over the first of five stomach-churning drops. You can
actually take a drop yourself over the falls; bungee-jumping has been
introduced as an attraction, as well as whitewater rafting in the lower
rapids.
While most tour operators feature Victoria Falls and Hwange,
Zimbabwe's largest National Park, only the smaller specialists as yet
reach the magic lost world of the Matopos south of Bulawayo. The local
Matabele call it ''the place of spirits'', and Cecil Rhodes himself
chose to be buried there, describing the strange, haunting hills as
''the world in a view''.
The first leader of the Matabele people, Mzilikazi, is also buried
here, as are the 32 British soldiers, Major Alan Wilson and his patrol,
who in 1893 went after Mzilikazi's son Lobengula, who had been waging
guerrilla warfare from among the rocks and caves against the British,
after he discovered that the treaties he had made with Cecil Rhodes
provided little protection for his people and their land.
Pursuing the Matabele through the wilderness, Alan Wilson and his
Shangani patrol found themselves cut off and facing 30,000 of
Lobengula's warriors. They fought to the last man, their epitaph ''to
the brave men'' engraved on their tombs, bestowed on them by their
adversaries themselves.
Now a National Park and World Heritage site, the Matopos are a
200-square-mile natural art gallery, museum, and theatre, the primeval
jumble of bare granite outcrops. The word ''Matopo'' in the local
Ndebele language means ''bald-headed ones'', hiding-places for the
greatest concentration of black eagles and leopards in Africa, though
you'll be lucky to catch a glimpse of the latter.
This is not big-game country, though there are giraffes, baboons,
warthogs, and a profusion of antelope. There are also 50 white and 10
black rhinos in the Matopos National park, that prehistoric cumbersome
animal, slaughtered for its horns which are believed to be a powerful
aphrodisiac in powdered form. Warnings to human predators within the
park are stark: ''Poachers will be shot on sight.''
We stayed in the Matopos with Richard Peek, former ranger and curator
of the Bulawayo Natural History Museum, and his wife Bookie who have
bought and run the small Malalangwe Lodge and Game Reserve -- it means
''where the leopard sleeps'' -- with seven luxurious cottages and a main
lodge scattered among the crevices and boulders, and 6000 acres which
Richard is gradually restocking with indigenous game.
He's learned most about that from the art of the unknown and long-gone
San Bushmen, who used the walls of their caves and canvases to record
the habits of the animals they hunted, and with which they developed an
almost mystic rapport. And on one magic morning we panted up the rocks
into a huge cave to gaze in awe at the 10,000-year-old, vivid, detailed,
delicate, and intensely moving scene -- a herd of impala in all their
quivering elegance, wheeling and fleeing in unison like rippling corn, a
sinewy water buffalo, head lowered, scenting danger, a haughty giraffe,
all legs and neck.
The timelessness of Africa isn't just a cliche.

KEEN not to look as though he's blowing his own trumpet, Craig Tannoch
is palpably uneasy when I suggest that a Herald lensperson snaps him for
the paper. ''I've been trying to keep a low profile,'' Craig mutters
with an uncharacteristic pained frown. ''This will be my first
photograph in eight years.''
In marked contrast, Craig's venue, the 13th Note, has managed during
its phenomenally busy two-year lifespan to register notably on portraits
of Glaswegian nightlife. Because if it's music you want -- live or on
record, and in all its many and varied forms -- then the 13th Note in
Glassford Street is undoubtedly the bar to visit, every night of the
week. And usually you can sample its musical wares for free, or very
nearly, to boot.
Drop into the 13th Note for a nice drop o' ambient from the mystery
DJs who run Sonora in the basement on Sunday nights. If it's a Saturday
night, your pre-club choice is between the choice acid-funk jazz fusions
spun by the Watt brothers at Mo' Jazz With Attitude on the 13th Note's
ground level, or the smokily-vibed techno deployed downstairs at Mickey
House.
Soundclash features DJs who specialise in mixing up dub, reggae,
techno, and apposite chunks of movie dialogue. Club Mouth on Sunday
meanwhile offers you the chance to see the devilish handsomeness of
Radio Scotland's Mark Percival when he materialises in the flesh, in
public, to spin hot guitar-waxings -- and be aware, my excitable
darlings, that two of Mark's more lantern-jawed broadcasting colleagues,
John Cavanagh and Peter Easton, occasionally sally forth from Queen
Margaret Drive to do likewise.
Sadly, the 13th Note's regular stand-up comedy night, the Comedy
Cellar, has gone into temporary abeyance, as has Boudoir with its
frightful cache of smirk-worthy kitsch: every slipped disc from Des
O'Connor to Demis Rossos by way of Sheena Easton and Jess Conrad, and
all guaranteed to be in the worst possible taste.
But fear not, dross-loving admirers of the Rubettes, Carl Douglas's
Kung Fu Fighting, and clumsy re-interpretations of seventies hits
performed on the Hammond organ! At K-Tel, the spirit of the cheaply
flung-together compilation album lives on on the first Thursday in every
month.
Beginning on March 1, however, every Wednesday night will feature the
exquisitely-crafted neo-bop of venerable sax-idol Bobby Wishart and his
new quintet. Having recently ended his old quartet's 12-year residency
at the Halt Bar, Bobby pledges a fresh helping of jazz which will draw
on traditions ancient and modern.
His new fivesome includes trumpeter Robert Henderson and bassist James
Kilbride, both of whom Bobby discovered during the course of his labours
as musical director of Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra. Established
keyboards wizard Chick Lyall will be making his residential debut with
Bobby, while drummer George McGowan's Wishartian links stretch back
30-odd years to the Mecca big-band circuit, when the duo were together
in the Johnny Kildare Orchestra, and the Star Club, Hamburg (Alex
Harvey's Big Soul Band).
''Each week, we'll be doing older tunes such as Dizzy Gillespie's
Night in Tunisia and Monk's Round Midnight, plus newer stuff like Bob
Berg's Friday Night at the Cadillac Club. And Latin stuff. And be bop.
Re bop. The usual mix of unusual things.''
But what of Craig Tannoch? Following an undergraduate spell in Fife,
he arrived in Glasgow from his native Greenock in order to ''doss about
in bands which, apart from News From Nowhere, I'm now too embarrassed to
name''. Seeking to create something which would be useful to the band,
and provide a more steady means of income than gigs, Craig helped set up
Tower Studios, a communal warren of rehearsal rooms and demo studios.
''I'd been very unbusy before, and doing real work opened my eyes to
lots of fun things, chiefly other peoples' gigs and tons of good
bands.'' From this evolved Tower Beat at Fury Murry's, a regular series
of showcase gigs exposing local groups to visiting London record-biz
talent-spotters.
Assisted by sponsorship from McEwan's Lager, Craig's determination to
help new young bands then crystallised into his overseeing a UK-wide
demo-tape chart with an accompanying series of demo discos and live
shows in clubs and pubs from Nottingham to Newcastle, Glasgow,
Edinburgh, and Manchester. Simultaneously, Tower Studios began upgrading
its recording facilities, moving to the subterranean city-centre
nightclub site which had once housed the Shelter. As the Apollo, success
was almost instant and sustained.
''We were getting healthy crowds at the Apollo's bar every night. We
staged loads of gigs. Our recording facilities were good and well-used.
We had plans for a record label and a small cinema. We expanded across
the city to the 13th Note's present home, transforming Trader's Bar into
the Boglestone as a complementary pub venue featuring mostly
Celtic-based musics.''
Then came flame, flood, and pestilence. A fire in the building above
the Apollo was followed by fire-extinguishing torrents of water, sinking
it. ''August 31, 1992, a date that's etched into my heart. The ceilings
were down, the floors buckled. Every single piece of recording equipment
was ruined. It was a nightmare. All we managed to salvage were the
ashtrays and some sodden paperwork. It's not something I've allowed
myself to look back on.''
Within four months, though, the 13th Note was off and running.
Similarly, Craig's original Apollo partner, Calum MacLean, has so
successfully resurrected Apollo Recordings in premises directly opposite
the 13th Note that local trance-dance heroes One Dove have opted to
record their new album there, spurning a top English studio and a
big-name American producer in the process.
But what is your secret, Craig?
''Getting other people involved, especially the people who've stayed
with me, from Tower via the Apollo, and the people who've come to me
with home-made compilation tapes bearing their ideas for the various
different nights. I think we all have a reasonable taste in music, a
wide taste in music, and we appreciate the chance we've had to create a
space, and we're all pleased with it and proud of it.
''It's a good environment in which to listen to music. It isn't that
we've brought in a couple of DJs or a band to make the place look busy.
And we've avoided any banner-waving about it. We don't have any
marketing statement. Our ethos is simply do it.
''It's the same with our 100% vegan bar-menu. We don't promote it as
such. We simply say it's good, fresh, freshly-made food for all tastes.
It's not just a matter of worthy vegetables.''
All tastes, not just worthy vegetables . . . a fine motto. Put
yourself in the picture about the 13th Note and its wholesome musical
fare.
* In addition to regular Wednesday-night gigs at the 13th Note with
his own quintet, Bobby Wishart will also be at the same venue piloting
his Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra charges throughout a new season of
fortnightly Sunday-afternoon performances, starting on March 19.

TRY to buy good contemporary cutlery these days and you'll be in for a
shock. If you want reproduction Georgian tableware you'll have no
problem finding cheap, bad imitations (as well as top quality repro).
But if you want good contemporary well-designed place sets you'll have
to shop around.
''Everything we seem to do in Britain is traditional, look at
architecture,'' says David Mellor, Britain's leading cutlery designer.
Mellor's Pride cutlery has beautiful, classic simplicity to it. Designed
40 years ago when he was still a student, it is still produced today and
is one of Sheffield-based Mellor's best sellers.
According to Peter Dormer, author of Design Since 1945 (an excellent
Thames &amp; Hudson guide, priced #6.95), Pride is ''arguably the most
beautiful of post-war British tableware designs''. According to Emma
Black of InHouse, one of Scotland's main outlets for Mellor cutlery,
Pride is still tops on wedding-present lists.
As David Mellor points out, cutlery is something you use two or three
times every day and so it's worth paying a little more for something
that will last a lifetime. ''You have to have something that works well.
The last thing you want is something that looks good but is not
workable. We brought out two new designs last year, Paris and English.
Paris is a sophisticated modern version of a relatively traditional
design.''
When buying cutlery what should you bear in mind? ''Our Paris design
is a luxurious looking thing,'' says Mellor. ''It looks rich and is
particularly nice to hold.'' It's important to feel the cutlery before
you buy and consider how the knife and fork balance in the hand.
Oneida, the world's largest cutlery company, is soon to launch a
coloured-handled canteen called Palette, bringing a touch of class to
the breakfast table and ''casual dining'' (colours are quite sedate:
bottle green, navy blue, black and white). New Verdi is a new cutlery
pattern from Sant' Andrea which puts a modern art-deco spin on
traditional handle shapes.
Other good quality silverware can be found if you look around.
Alessi's Nuovo Milano range bristles with Italian brio. It's an
all-encompassing range with everything from spade-shaped gelati spoon to
dainty pastry fork -- just the thing for tasting la dolce vita.
* Sant' Andrea's New Verdi is available from leading department
stores. Oneida's Palette is launched in April (for stockists call 0895
639 452). David Mellor's cutlery is available from good kitchen shops,
department stores, and InHouse in Wilson Street, Glasgow, and Howe
Street, Edinburgh. InHouse also stocks a host of Alessi silverware
ranges.

THE only way to learn about wine is to taste it, preferably with
someone more knowledgeable than oneself, to act as a guide. To be
effective, several wines need to be tried against each other: as we used
to be instructed at school, ''contrast and compare''.
Valvona and Crolla, the Edinburgh shop specialising in Italian food
and drink, is running a third round of tutored tastings of Italian
wines. The tutor is Maureen Ashley, a Master of Wine, whose main
interest is Italian wines. Her series starts on March 13 at 6.45 for 7pm
and runs every month (except May) until November.
In that time she covers a great deal of what is the world's largest
wine producer with many astonishing new wines as well as many
long-established (and sometimes taken for granted). The cost is #12.50
per evening, which pays for between eight and 10 tastings, and is
excellent value.
The notes advertising these events include a useful plea to
participants not to smoke on the premises or use strong aftershave or
perfume, all of which are enemies of concentration on what is in the
glass.
The same firm has another clutch of three Italian tastings by Michael
Garner which also start next month (March 30, then September 28, and
November 9). The cost is higher but the wines involved are dearer, and
the value is unimpaired.
* Full details can be had from Valvona and Crolla, 19 Elm Row,
Edinburgh EH7 4AA (tel: 0131 556 6066).
The advantage of such venues is not only that they often introduce
attenders to wines never previously encountered, they also ensure the
assessment is objective and the wines directly compared so that it is
possible to taste why some are are much dearer than others. You might
not want to spend more than #x on any bottle of wine, but those who
willing do so are not necessarily mad (or rich!), just fascinated.
Tutored tastings are the way to find out whether the prices of expensive
wines are justified by their quality.
I RECENTLY had the experience of a happy tutored tasting of wines from
the Co-op at Oberkirch in Baden. The tutor was Wolfgang Stech, a young
Baden lad married to the daughter of a Scots wine lover. Wolfgang did
not claim to be a professional expert, more an ambassador for the wines
which sang for themselves. He did, however, know a lot about his subject
and tasters were able to feel and enjoy the qualities he noticed first.
He identified the various grapes and the categories into which wine made
from them is classified.
That last point is essential to understanding all German wines which
deliver increasing degrees of intensity depending on the category in
which they are placed. Frankly, wines which fall below the first quality
category are not likely to be very interesting; they are wines which
will have had to have sugar added to make them palatable. The German
vineyards are too far north for all their wines to escape this
necessity, but the best do and are wonderful, though some may still seem
too sweet (though this is exactly the sort of area where tutors can do a
lot of good!).
Wines without added sugar say Qualitatswein mit Pradikat on their
labels. Alas, there is also a lower and confusing category called
Qualitatswein bestimmter Anbaugebeite where some sugaring is permitted.
Try to avoid these and focus on the pradikat, which can be Kabinett,
Spatlese, and Auslese, for reasonably affordable wines, though great
Auslesen can get pricey, and Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese. The
latter can be very expensive and are rarely encountered because rarely
made, something which also applies to Eiswein, wine made from grapes
picked under special specified conditions of frost during the night.
To follow the ''ins'' and ''outs'' of that, try German Wines by Ian
Jameson (Faber, #17.99) and in the meantime anything from Baden might be
tried in expectation of charm and delicacy.

Jewel of Torridon
finds Hugh Ouston
contemplating an
ancestral route
IT MUST be something to do with growing old. You can't find older
company than the rocks of Torridon. The quartzite screes of the ridges
are six hundred million years old, the bedded sandstone of the corrie
walls older, and the mountains are set on a platform of gneiss two
thousand million years older still. They are among the oldest rocks in
the world. Surely they could teach us something.
Two good days in October: that is all we asked. My last two Octobers
in Torridon, the snow had lain down to the road, thick as the porridge
we had spent the morning eating in the bothy. Now, incredibly, the sun
struck the dry stones on the path under the pines as we moved up on to
the tawny flanks of Coire Mhic Nobuill. High to our left hung the
curvaceous green ridge of Beinn Alligin, the easiest of the Torridon
hills, so we had been told, the hill of the jewel.
I did not believe it. I am a cautious walker and live a long way from
serious mountains. Easiest is a relative term. But as the sharp breeze
cooled our oxters and the view into the wilderness to the north spread
like a developing sepia photograph, Beinn Alligin revealed its first
gift: a route up a corrie shaped not, as so many are in the guidebooks,
like a quaich, but like a mythical drinking horn. A wide grassy mouth
narrowed and steepened slowly and drew us in and upwards.
You can tell a lot about a mountain from the conversation on the way;
here it soon took on the reflective rhythm of the walk. Our first
Torridonian cliffs shut off the sea, but a burn held our hand until we
eased on to a wide plateau. After mercifully few false summits we were
met by the cairn of Tom na Gruagach, already over 3000 feet.
Six feet on the other side of a flask of tea, our sense of scale and
balance were deconstructed as the mountain was sliced in half and across
the chasm a sharp ridge dipped and rose. The great black gash below the
summit seemed a superfluous touch of glacial design, but the horns
looked innocent enough, three little castles on a long spur facing us.
The ridge was perfect walking. When you are feeling confident it is good
to know that paths are the expression of the aggregated wisdom of
generations of hillwalkers, that you are striding on the minds of your
ancestors.
On our right, the cliffs dropped to Toll a'Mhadaidh with an abruptness
made enjoyable by the friendlier grassy slopes streaming down on our
left. Beyond them piled horizons: the coast, the Inner Sound, Raasay,
Skye, the Minch, the Outer Islands, clouds above them. Away to the
south, the Sgurr of Eigg; far in the north, Stornoway. A landscape as
indifferent to the names we give it as the rock beneath our feet. We
could feel our heads grow with looking. Standing on the summit, the
ridge we had walked and the ridge we were to walk stretched like arms on
either side. Only the cold wind from Liathach to the east moved us on.
''How are the Horns today?'' we asked the walkers and dogs we passed,
and back came the reply, ''they're not a problem'', less convincing with
each repetition. As we picked our way down the ridge toward them we both
thought: ah well, but a dog has a leg at each corner. The sight of
living walkers ahead of us was a comfort. We began to twist upwards
through the crumbled ledges.
BUT a good route is just a foothold from a bad one, and after some
brief controversies we began to revise our opinion of paths: perhaps,
after all, they were the collective wisdom of generations of sheep and
led only to a ledge with no egress and impossibly green grass. Was it
crampons or fingernails that had made those scratches on the rock? But
always the rocks are bigger than you think, and our spidery bodies can
tread faces that our distant eyes told us were sheer. Sunshine and
company put air in the lungs, and the holds we needed were where we
needed them, though we knew we should need none.
The crest of the first and highest horn is a knobbly, airy platform
with enough room for the photos that we already knew would not do it
justice. Muriel Gray had had a helicopter and a radio mike. All we had
was a pair of ravens rocking, back-flipping, and diving, and talking
their human talk. Then down and up, down and up the same curling steps
across the rock bands to the other horns. By the time we reached the top
of the descent we were sorry they had been so easy. But then you always
go up too slow and down too quick; it's just another of the metaphors
that hillwalking throws at you.
All around the ridge we had heard the stags roaring from the glens on
either side. As we came off the end of the horns we could see one with
his parcel of hinds on a sweet fan of grass below a gully on Beinn
Dearg. The rock is bedded almost flat on the great Torridon Bens, a fact
appreciated as we dropped quickly from step to step, not embarrassed to
use the renowned six-point descent: two hands, two feet, two cheeks.
The shape of the mountain unrolled below our boots, grassy slope and
stone step alternating for a thousand feet. The evening sun shining
through the dram we shared was not more dark golden than the warm grass
on the corrie slopes. Nor did it matter that there was another thousand
feet of slope and step to go before we picked up the path to the bridge
over the Amhainn Coire Mhic Nobuil.
So the day ended as every good Scottish hillwalk does, by following a
burn and its waterfalls and rowan berries, while the jewel mountain
displayed above us the whole of our route round the horseshoe ridge. I
have never climbed a mountain so beautifully balanced for height,
length, difficulty, variety, and position. Never had the old lie seemed
so true: ''Who has the hills for a lover, will find them wondrous
kind.''

Jack Webster speaks to the writer who has spent two years living and
working in tune with the rhythms of Hugh MacDiarmid's life
THE wally-dugs are still on the shelf, beside the books and clutter of
personal effects which, in their silence, tell an eloquent tale of the
man who used to live here. Deep in the Border hills of Lanarkshire,
Brownsbank Cottage remains much as it was in the days of Hugh
MacDiarmid, Scotland's poetic giant of the twentieth century who spent
his last 27 years within these walls.
Portraits good and bad gaze down upon the man who now sits at his
desk, musing and writing and contemplating his good fortune at being
able to work in the setting of a literary hero. James Robertson,
formerly assistant manager of Waterstone's bookshop in the centre of
Glasgow, is the first writer-in-residence at MacDiarmid's old home,
which is now in the care of Biggar Museums.
It is there that Robertson sits in the poet's leather chair of an
evening, by the old peat fire, before retiring to the poet's bed, which
lies adjacent to his work-desk in the confined space of the old farm
cottage, quaint and cosy.
After MacDiarmid's death from cancer in 1978, when he was 86, his
vivacious wife Valda lived out her days at Brownsbank until 1989. Known
for dyeing her hair a startling red, Valda left her last henna sachet in
the bathroom and there it still lies as a touching memento.
Into this setting, two years ago, came James Robertson, fresh from a
long study of MacDiarmid's work and now given a breathing space of a
guaranteed income to see if he could establish himself as a full-time
writer.
''For the first two nights in the house I felt a bit uneasy,'' he
confesses. ''It was February and a lot of creatures seemed to be running
about on the roof. Yes, it was spooky. At first it gives you a shiver to
think of who has been here. With all their possessions, you feel like an
intruder moving into someone else'e home. It is impossible not to be
conscious of MacDiarmid's presence, with the pictures, the portraits,
the books. But once I settled in I found it an amazingly conducive place
for working.
''After two weeks the things on the walls faded into the background
and I fitted myself into the scene. Now I just find it a delightful
place to be.''
As his two-year tenure draws to a close, James Robertson brings out
next week a collection of his own best poems, Sound-Shadow, including a
substantial work called The Blues at Brownsbank, in which he gives
poetic hint of the experience:
Twenty Hugh MacDiarmids watch me dress,
Stir up the ashes and a stubborn glow, a flame.
I start to fit my day between the portraits, books,
His pipes, her wally dugs, the desk she built for him,
The doocot where he filed his thoughts away.
So how did James Robertson become the first holder of the Brownsbank
Writing Fellowship? It is not quite a story of the budding poet starving
in a garret, for he grew up in Bridge of Allan, son of a well-to-do
sales director who sent him to the up-market Glenalmond School in
Perthshire. By the time he reached Edinburgh University there would be a
left-wing reaction to that conservative background, including a
flirtation with the Scottish National Party, despite a suspicion of
nationalism as an ideology.
While a student of 20, Robertson flew off on an exchange visit to
Philadelphia, on the day the news of MacDiarmid's death was breaking.
''I missed the obituaries back home but his name was big enough for
write-ups in America,'' he recalls. ''I hadn't known much about him but
I did realise the importance of his passing. It was my first time out of
the country and Scotland was much in my mind.
''The devolution debate was also reaching a climax -- and we had just
had Scotland's disastrous World Cup venture in Argentina. On top of all
that, I was becoming more and more interested in literature and decided
I needed to find out more about MacDiarmid.''
So he steeped himself in the Lallans which the poet had created as a
literary language of Scotland, not the kind of tongue familiar in his
own home but one which now fascinated him.
Back home, Robertson graduated from Edinburgh University, later
returned for a doctorate (his thesis was on Walter Scott), and pursued
the ambition to be a full-time writer of fiction.
Though his poetry went into print in 1983, that would never pay the
bills so he took a part-time job at the new Waterstone's bookshop in
Edinburgh. At least he was in regular touch with literature. The
launching of Alan Bold's biography of MacDiarmid was held there in 1988
and that was the one and only time he met Valda.
The part-time job became full-time and the diligent Robertson was soon
promoted assistant manager of Waterstone's in Gordon Street, Glasgow.
''I was well-paid and enjoyed the experience but, working in a bookshop,
you become jaundiced in your view of what books are about,'' he says
now. ''You look at turnover and realise that you are buying in countless
books not on the strength of their content but on what the salesman is
telling you. Suddenly they cease to be a special thing and become a
product.
''Publishing hype makes something out of nothing and I was getting fed
up with that. I was in my thirties and it was time to do something more
positive.''
It was author Robert Crawford who encouraged Robertson to apply for
the MacDiarmid fellowship, which arose after Valda's death, when the
cottage was bought from the neighbouring farmer by the enterprising
Biggar Museums. Considering all the possibilities for preserving
MacDiarmid's home, they struck on the idea of a writer-in-residence.
Biggar Museums were joined by the Scottish Arts Council, Strathclyde
region and Clydesdale district in supporting the venture, which would
give a promising writer the chance of a home and working base, with two
years' security at #11,000 per annum.
''I expected it to go to a well-known writer and didn't think I had
any chance,'' says Robertson.
Belatedly, he made the application, gained an interview -- and, much
to his delight, landed the post of writer-in-residence at Brownsbank.
After the first year, there was a shortfall in the finances and
Waterstone's made a fitting gesture to their former employee by backing
his new post.
James Robertson, who is separated from his wife, moved out of his flat
in Shawlands, Glasgow, and into the more alien environment of rural
Scotland. There he picked up the rhythms of MacDiarmid's life, walked
those Border hills with their view of the neighbouring John Buchan
country and settled to a writer's routine. He is loudly praised for
fostering creative writing among schoolchildren in the area as well as
stimulating interest among visitors, who still manage to locate
MacDiarmid's old home, even though it is well off the beaten track.
As he prepares to hand over to 26-year-old Matthew Fitt from Dundee,
an honours graduate currently at Moray House College, Edinburgh, James
Robertson now faces the task of surviving as a writer. He has a
commission for one book and is in the midst of a novel, short stories,
and more poetry.
''The two-year residency has a logic about it,'' he says. ''It gives
someone else a chance and if you stayed too long you might go stale. I
have had a wonderful experience but it is time to go.''
How does he feel about MacDiarmid now? ''I am even more keen on his
poetry but less keen on his polemics,'' he smiles. Reluctant to give
himself a label, James Robertson would even avoid the tag of
''socialist''.
''If there is an 'ist' at all,'' he says, ''I'm now a pragmatist!''
At first it was spooky . . . It is impossible not to be conscious of
MacDiarmid's presence

CONTRACT talks between Celtic and their Scotland Under-21
internationalist Brian O'Neil have been put on hold after a breakdown in
negotiations.
Talks between manager Tommy Burns and several players whose contracts
end in the summer have been taking place on a regular basis in recent
weeks. Skipper Paul McStay, centre half Tony Mowbray, and striker
Charlie Nicholas as well as O'Neil have been involved in discussions
over fresh deals.
I understand that Burns and O'Neil had been very close to agreeing a
long- term contract which would have kept the highly talented
22-year-old at Parkhead for several seasons to come.
Now, though, the deal is in danger of collapsing after the club's
chief executive, Fergus McCann, took an interest in the proceedings.
No new contract has been signed and the delicate negotiations which
had gone so smoothly while being handled totally by Burns are under
threat.
It would be a major blow to Celtic and to the Parkhead support if they
were to lose O'Neil, who has developed this season into a central
defender of the highest class.
Earlier this week the young Celt -- once skipper of the country's
youth sides -- was named by Scotland manager Craig Brown in the B
international squad for Tuesday's game against Northern Ireland at
Easter Road.
At that time Brown indicated that O'Neil could even come into the
reckoning for the European Championship game against Russia in Moscow.
He even went on to praise him as a ''European-style defender.''
At club level, too, Burns has been quick to praise the sudden
development of O'Neil who spent last season at Parkhead being switched
from defence into attack or even midfield. Now he has settled into what
looks like his best role and has the ability to solve some of Celtic's
problems in that area.
Burns will see it as essential to have the player under contract
before predators from England move in. The Celtic manager also will see
O'Neil as part of the club's future. That is why the young man who
joined up at Parkhead four-and-a-half years ago should be handed the
kind of contract which will keep him there even longer.

HAVING a garden designed with a blend of beauty and ease of
maintenance can be tricky, writes IAN WALLS.
And no-one is better qualified to achieve this than the skilled
landscape gardener with years of experience.
Typical is Jimmy Henderson, 52, of Killearn, who has come a long way
since serving his apprenticeship under Roy Irvine, Director of Falkirk
Parks.
Roy taught a lot of youngsters what gardening and landscaping was all
about, and many proteges went on to great things in the horticultural
world.
When his time was out, Jimmy set up business on his own. After
operating out of his home in Banknock, he moved to picturesque Clachan
of Campsie.
A lot of the early landscaping work was in the mundane category of
slabbing and walling.
But design gradually crept in, and Jimmy was able to interpret what
clients wanted and come up with suitable designs.
When a farm became vacant near Killearn, he and his wife Jean decided
it was the right time to move. They set up production of many of the
trees and shrubs needed for landscaping projects.
The farmhouse was modernised and the ground around landscaped into a
design that can be easily kept, mainly by Jean.
Their son, James, went to college to obtain recognised qualifications.
In between studies, he has developed an extensive shrub and tree-growing
unit to which he hopes to return once studies are completed.
Over the years, Jimmy has built up a thriving landscape business. One
secret of his success is participation in the practical side,
supervising things closely.
He has lost count of the number of gardens he has landscaped over the
years.
Currently he is sub-contracting work for builders and has a huge
contract at Ruchazie, Glasgow, planting 4000 trees and 15,000 shrubs.
Many of these have been grown in his own nursery.
In some situations Jimmy works closely with landscape architects,
garden designers, and horticultural consultants. But he really prefers
to get on with things on his own.

AFTER five rounds of play in the Royal Bank of Scotland Scottish
Women's Curling Championships, Rhona Martin and Kirsty Hay share the
lead on four wins each at Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre.
Martin's 100% record was broken in yesterday evening's play when Hay's
team beat her by 6-4. This victory, added to wins over Marion Miller and
Claire Milne, meant that Hay was undefeated in yesterday's three rounds
of play.
Three teams are sitting on three wins and two losses -- Claire Milne,
Debbie Knox, and Carolyn Hutchison -- and go into today's play with
every chance of qualifying for tomorrow's semi-finals.
Third round -- R Martin 7, D Knox 6; S Harvey 2, M Morton 9; C Milne
7, C Hutchison 6; K Hay 6, M Miller 4. Fourth round -- Hutchison 7,
Miller 5; Milne 6, Hay 7; Harvey 5, Martin 10; Morton 4, Knox 5. Fifth
round -- Milne 11, Harvey 3; Knox 8, Miller 10; Hutchison 6, Morton 4;
Martin 4, Hay 6.
Standings after five rounds -- Hay 4 wins, 1 loss; Martin 4-1;
Hutchison 3-2; Knox 3-2; Milne 3-2; Miller 2-3; Morton 1-4; Harvey 0-5.

CELTIC captain Paul McStay may be a spectator in the Hampden stand
this afternoon for the second game in succession when the Parkhead men
face Meadowbank in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup.
Certainly, there was little to suggest a quick return for McStay as
assistant manager Billy Stark went through his playing options for the
game. Stark talked about the possible return of centre half Tony Mowbray
and full back Tosh McKinlay, among others, as he pointed out that Tom
Boyd and Jim Slavin are both suspended.
But when the talk turned to McStay and his absence last Saturday, the
Celtic second-in-command stressed: ''We were very happy with our forward
players last week and with the number of chances we created.
''At the moment, we have not finally decided on whether or not Paul
will play tomorrow. That will be discussed again in the morning.''
Already manager Tommy Burns has made it plain that the long-serving
McStay was dropped last week, and it was equally clear from his remarks
that no-one at the club was guaranteed a first-team place.
Even today as they go in against tiny Meadowbank as overwhelming 8-1
on favourites to win, that policy will not be changed. Burns and Stark
have both found themselves on the embarrassing end of cup results over
the years -- even as recently as this season in the Coca-Cola Cup final
-- and any repeat is the last thing they need.
There will not be a shock at Hampden, of course, and it is unlikely
there will be any shocks elsewhere, unless, of course, the great
unpredictables of Scottish football, cup-holders Dundee United, have one
of their off-days.
If that was to happen then Huntly, on their own ground, could give the
Tannadice men some cause for concern. United have suffered violent form
swings this season, which is why they remain in that dangerous area at
the foot of the premier division.
But United assistant manager Gordon Wallace insisted: ''We are
preparing for this tie in exactly the same way we would if we were
meeting Rangers.
''We have trained the same way, we travelled north to stay overnight
as we would for any game involving distance, and we have had Huntly
watched. They are the best team in the Highland League and we are taking
no chances.''
Huntly manager Steve Paterson reckons his players can get a goal --
but will make no forecast beyond that.
Instead, he grins and says: ''The players are really up for this game
and they believe they can do better. I'm not going to argue with them.
After all, this is the most important game of their lives and a chance
to cause one of the biggest upsets of all time.''
Like Dundee United, Aberdeen have spent the week preparing thoroughly
for their visit to Ochilview. As caretaker manager Roy Aitken underlined
earlier in the week, Stenhousemuir could have moved the tie to a bigger
ground -- but didn't.
That suggested to Aitken that the second division leaders saw their
own pitch as providing them with some kind of advantage over the men
from Pittodrie.
Certainly, it worked that way when they defeated St Johnstone in the
last round as Aitken looked on. Now the Pittodrie manager says: ''It is
vital for Aberdeen to get into the quarter-finals of the cup. The club
have always had a pedigree in this competition.
''Players are accustomed to appearing in finals and semi-finals and we
want that to continue. It will take a very good team to stop us if the
players perform to their capabilities.''
It's doubftul if even manager Terry Christie, who has transformed
Stenhousemuir since taking over, can inspire his part-timers to victory
-- even though that famous cup specialist, Adrian Sprott, once of
Hamilton, will play.
Meanwhile, at Easter Road, those one-time challengers to Rangers'
dominance in the league, Hibs and Motherwell, will meet for the fourth
time this season.
Both now admit that the cup has become their best chance of trophy
success and the game promises to be as finely balanced as their premier
division clashes have been this season already.
The first game at Fir Park was a 1-1 draw, the second in Edinburgh
ended at 2-2, and the third, back in Lanarkshire, finished 0-0.
Between them, the two sides will be parading almost half the Scotland
B squad who play Northern Ireland at the same ground on Tuesday.
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish believes that the return of his
first-choice strike-force, Dougie Arnott and Tommy Coyne, may be enough
to tip the balance in his team's favour.
But Hibs frontman Darren Jackson believes this may be the Edinburgh
side's year to take the trophy. ''That's what we want,'' he says.
''If we could win the cup then all of us would have our names written
in the Hibs history books. We could become legends.''
First, though, there is the little matter of dealing with Motherwell.
The other all-premier tie takes place on Monday, when Rangers travel
to Tynecastle. Scotland defender Alan McLaren is free of suspension
after having missed the past three games and returns to the squad, which
will again include new signings Alex Cleland and Gary Bollan.
Trevor Steven, who missed the Aberdeen game, is likely to be out again
along with long-term injury victims Andy Goram, Ally McCoist, Ian
Ferguson and Alexei Mikhailichenko.
Hearts have serious defensive worries -- Neil Berry, Willie Jamieson
and Dave McPherson are all struggling to be ready for the live TV
encounter.

The Herald's team of reviewers presents an
informed guide to your listening pleasure.
Pop/Rock Music: Compiled by David Belcher.
Live At Leeds, the Who (Polydor)
* Time for rockin' oldsters to assay those Pete Townshend-style flying
windmill leaps of yore. Where once this heavyweight memento of the Who
on-stage on February 14, 1970, had just six tracks, now it's re-released
with an extra eight. These comprise three of the band's own stage faves
(Fortune Teller, Heaven And Hell, Tattoo); three pithy singles (Happy
Jack, I Can't Explain, I'm A Boy), and two seven-minute-plus rock-opera
efforts (A Quick One, Amazing Journey). Unfortunately, on all of these
bonus tracks the level of r &amp; b falls well short of maximum. Enjoy the
LP as it was and thank the Lord for programme-able CD players.
Trance Atlantic, various (Trance Atlantic)
* Settle into yon organic electro-robo-groove -- eight parts Kraftwerk
to two parts Brian Eno -- with this hip and happening two-CD collection
of nu ambient techno-throb from San Francisco, New York, Detroit, and
Chicago. Joey Beltram, Richie Hawtin, Dan Curtin, Carl Craig, Eddie
Fowlkes, Meat Beat Manifesto, and the grizzled-but-still-groovy Genesis
P Orridge head the roster of better-kent names, but you'll enjoy
becoming accustomed to Himadri, Black Balls, Infiniti, and Born Under A
Rhyming Planet.
Classic Funk 3, various (Mastercuts)
* Sweaty, grinding, dribbly stuff mostly from the original era of
flapping satin flares and bobbing Afros, 1972-75. Linda Lewis's Sideway
Shuffle is an unexpected treat; Caledonia's primal funk overlords, the
Average White Band, lock into a righteous and melodramatic form of
pop-soul locomotion on Stop The Rain. At the collection's furthest
chronological extremes you can enjoy James Brown in 1969 pleading for
entry to love's vestibules in order to . . . ahem . . . do the popcorn,
and Nature Boys asking Who's In Town in 1988. Sho' nuff is classically
funky in heeeyuh . . .
Manna, Manna (Apollo)
* Quirkily ironic Sheffield studio-boffins Kevin Bacon and Jonathan
Quarmby, once associated with dancefloor funsters Wau Mr Modo, twiddle a
multiplicity of knobs to telling effect. It swells! It glows! It's
heavenly and nutritious! One has no wish to be repressively
Yorkshireist, but by gum if the Human League were to stop writing such
crummy lyrics, ditch the lumpy birds, and get seriously vibed-up, they'd
still only be half as good as Manna.
Pure Phase, Spiritualized Electric Mainline (Dedicated)
* Praise be that some of today's young 'uns prefer elfin fruitcake Syd
Barrett to plodding pomp-rockers Pink Floyd. This is fey; plangent;
shimmery; disaffected; introspective, and at times self-indulgent to the
point of silliness. Overall, though, it's rather brilliant.
Jazz/Folk: Rob Adams and Alison Kerr
All Men Amen, Iain Ballamy Quartet (B&amp;W)
* A CD for which ''British jazz'' should be seen as a simple
indication of source, not a handicap, because this stands comparison
with anything from anywhere. Saxophonist Ballamy and Django Bates
(piano, keyboards, and E flat horn) have been working together for 12
years, and it shows. These are musicians with their own personalities.
While drawing on musical forms from Jamaica to Jo'burg, they use them in
entirely their own way. The compositions are mature, at times quirky,
and always imaginative; the playing likewise. Try Meadow's recipe of
English pastoralism over a bullish, South African bassline, and if your
heart doesn't melt, your ears need a respray.
We Live Here, Pat Metheny Group (Geffen)
* The Group's first release since 1989 finds guitarist Metheny
successfully taking on board new technology and rhythms from America's
big-city streets as well as from her southern neighbours. From the
hip-hoppish Here To Stay through Something to Remind You's distinct nod
towards 1970s Philly Soul to Stranger In Town's urgent riffing, the mood
is invariably sunny and the musicianship always of a high order. Easy
listening, but by no means bland.
Dr A's Secret Remedies, Four Men And A Dog (Transatlantic)
* Four Men And A Dog took themselves off to Levon Helm's Woodstock
studio for this, making use of the Band's Garth Hudson (piano and
accordion) and Randy Ciarlante (drums) together with sundry chums. So
it's no surprise that some of the arrangements betray a debt to the
Band's early albums, although the singing and songwriting are some way
short of that standard. Daft ditties such as Sometimes Samba are
enjoyable on a novelty level, however, and offer essential breathing
space between the instrumentals on which Gerry O'Connor (banjo) and
fiddler Cathal Hayden are in typically devastating form.
A Piano Anthology (MCA Records)
* ABOVE-average compilation covering all the major players from the
long-dead Jelly Roll Morton through to the long-living Jay McShann
(though he wasn't born in 1890, as Butch Thompson's liner notes
suggest). The 20 tracks whiz by, and no wonder. There are some real
gems, not all of them familiar, such as the hitherto unheard takes of
Art Tatum's sumptuous Deep Purple and James P Johnson's masterpiece of
swinging stride, Riffs. They're all here: Willie the Lion Smith, Mary
Lou Williams, Earl Hines, and Bill Evans -- everyone. Next volume
please.
I'll Be Seeing You, Tommy Dorsey-Frank Sinatra (RCA)
* SAMPLES from a five-CD set, The Song Is You, featuring the young
Sinatra serving his apprenticeship with the Dorsey band between 1940 and
1942 when he still crooned angelically with the band, rather than
swinging laconically above them. One-time bobby-soxed fans of the
blue-eyed boy wonder will delight in this sepia-tinted trip down memory
lane. Yet I prefer the more world-weary, laid-back, love-cynical Sinatra
of the fifties.
Classical: Michael Tumelty
Wagneriana, Cyprien Katsaris (Sony)
* NOW here's a real curio. Piano transcriptions of bleeding chunks
from Wagner's operas are commonplace, at least in the versions made by
his wizard pianist buddy, the composer Franz Liszt. But what is not too
widely known is that everyone else who could turn his hand to
transcription was at it, too. And this collection -- spectacularly
played by pianist Cyprien Katsaris -- features some dazzlers:
arrangements out of Tannhauser, The Valkyrie, Twilight of the Gods, and
The Mastersingers, made by such near-forgotten luminaries as Joseph
Rubinstein, Heinrich Rupp, Joachim Raff, and Louis Brassin, whose
version of the Ride of the Valkyries (aka how to make two hands sound
like five) has to be heard to be believed. The real curio is the version
of the Prelude from Tristan, made by Wagner's personal friend and
champion Hans von Bulow (whose wife Wagner nicked) with a concert ending
tacked on by the old adulterer himself. A must, this disc.
Gubaidulina Piano Works, Andreas Haefliger (Sony)
* Another dazzling set of piano pieces, this one from Russia's first
lady of composition, Sofia Gubaidulina. A fascinating collection of
tough-voiced pianism. Gubaidulina dismisses her 1962 Chaconne as a
student piece. An immense crag of a composition, foundation-shaking
music, it receives a power-play performance from pianist Haefliger that
should have all strong-arm pianists rushing to get it into their
repertoire. Similarly with the gritty 1965 Sonata. Delight of the disc,
however, is the collection of  miniatures, Musical Toys: charming, tiny,
character pieces full of wit and whimsy. The other side of the iron
lady.

SCOTLAND can celebrate the 700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance and
make a little history of their own at the Parc des Princes today with
their first win in Paris for 26 years.
The magnitude of the task facing the Scottish side is on the same
scale as the allegedly beefy bank accounts held by French
internationalists. But yesterday in the French capital, the Scots were
relishing their status as rank outsiders.
The mood was best summed up by Stirling County winger Ken Logan. ''The
fact that everybody has written us off is working to our advantage,'' he
said. ''Scottish sides are never more dangerous than when we're
portrayed as no-hopers.''
The Auld Alliance theme runs strong in Paris. The Lord Provost of
Edinburgh, Norman Irons, is in town as a guest of Jacques Chirac, and
yesterday the Lothian Pipe Band gave a kilted performance in front of
the city's Hotel de Ville.
The Scottish side trained at the US Maison-Laffitte ground in the
Paris suburbs, and among the large crowd of onlookers was a party of 10
and 11-year-olds from the Royal High School FP club in Edinburgh. They
have a couple of games against USML and Racing Club de France tomorrow.
Today at the Parc des Princes the entente will not be quite so
cordiale. And should a victorious Scottish side feel like party poopers
at the Auld Alliance hooley, then they should recall that John Balliol's
signature on the contract in 1295 resulted in at least a couple of
match-turning penalties against the Scottish nation -- to whit Mary
Queen of Scots lost her head, and the Scots were turned well and truly
over at the mother and father of all scrummages, Flodden Field.
More seriously yesterday, Scotland manager Duncan Paterson was voicing
the opinion that his side were well aware of the tricolors ''backlash''
scenario.
France were soundly beaten last time out against England, and will be
looking to atone for their demise at the hands of ''perfidious Albion.''
He declared: ''Of course, France must be very disappointed,
particularly after their Test wins in New Zealand last summer. The fact
that they have left the team unchanged after Twickenham will ask
questions of their character.
''The danger of a backlash does exist but this is, after all, France
in Paris and they are still one of the world's top sides, and we will
have to be at our very best to beat them.''
The Scotland captain, Gavin Hastings, is rarely less than ebullient
and his mood in Paris was infectiously upbeat.
''I don't believe in the bogey ground theory,'' he said. ''OK, we
haven't won here for 26 years but the bottom line is that we haven't
produced the goods when we've needed to in Paris. Time and again we've
made chances and we just haven't taken them.
''What we have to do tomorrow is to create these chances and then make
sure that we take them. By and large we took our chances against Ireland
and we're looking to improve on that.''
Neither does Hastings believe that there are any particular danger men
in the French side.
''I don't believe that there are any key men within their ranks. If
there are then there are 15 of them. The French just love to play 15-man
rugby. They like nothing more than moving the ball from all areas of the
field, and if we are sloppy in our defence then they will exploit that.
The first tackles have to go in.
''They are very good at reading the game and they play what is in
front of them. If we give them the slightest opportunity then they will
make the most of them. We mustn't give them these opportunities.''
The final word must rest, fittingly, with the back. The state of
Hastings' back has become one of the longest-running melodramas of
Scottish rugby.
He did not play for his club last week on medical advice, but he has
played a full part in training over the last couple of days, and the
latest medical bulletin, straight from the horse's mouth, is as follows:
''The back is excellent. There is no problem with the back. I've
trained all the time even last week. If there was a major problem then
it would have materialised before now. The back, let me tell everybody,
is fine.''

* On the day Scotland's rugby team tackle the might of France, left
winger Kenny Logan reveals what food and drink kept him at match pitch
on the day of Scotland's recent Murrayfield triumph over Ireland.
BREAKFAST consisted of sausage, bacon, haggis, beans, and toast, at
10am. I had fresh orange juice to drink but no tea or coffee. At 12
o'clock I had the energy drink Maxim. Then about 12.30, let me think, I
had sandwiches -- chicken and cheese -- plus a wee drop of lasagne.
Often I'd have a blackcurrant lemonade with my food but that Saturday I
was drinking Maxim all the way between 12 and the kick-off at half-past
two, maybe two pints. In the middle of the match I had some Highland
Spring water. Afterwards -- though I'm not teetotal! -- I had a cup of
tea with plenty of sugar and milk and a Mars Bar. Then I celebrated with
a pint of beer -- Tennent's Special. Had nothing after that until the
meal at the Sheraton with which I drank white wine -- quite sweet. The
menu was prawns and salmon, then beef, potatoes, and veg. The dessert
was quite a fancy thing like a sponge. After that I had coffee and too
much beer. That was it for the day!
* Kenny Logan spoke to Lesley Duncan.

RECEIVED opinion has it that should either winger slip up today in the
cauldron that is Parc des Princes, then a member of the family that owns
the Foxbar Hotel in Kilmarnock will step easily into the place vacated
by Kenny Logan or Craig Joiner. Derek Stark, the 28-year-old Boroughmuir
winger, who has been called a ''Rolls Royce'' by Bill McLaren more times
than many can remember, seems, somewhat late in his career, to be
jockeying for position.
''I suppose I'm fresh,'' he said. ''People think I've not been around,
and I suppose it's true because I took a three-week break over November
and went to Florida, and played in the Dubai sevens.
''Besides which, I didn't play in the Inter Provisional matches for
Edinburgh, so I've not been noticed. Also, I am always a slow starter,
it happens every year that I don't get going until about now.''
But one flashing game for Boroughmuir in a televised league match over
Watsonians soon changed all that. There was pace, vision, and backs
moves a plenty. Once, centre Sean Lineen looked one way, the Watsonian
defence the other, and Stark roared in through some weak tackling
unsighted. Next, two searing crossfield breaks with hand-off, one ending
in Iwan Tukalo's romp for the line.
''I'm lucky to play outside Sean Lineen,'' said Stark. ''Sean is
undoubtedly one of the best centres in the country, and he tries like
mad to get the back three of the team into try-scoring situations. He
may have lost a yard of pace, but over 30 metres he'll be as fast as the
rest. I think he's more relaxed than he used to be when he was the man
in possession of the caps. After all, there are no more Sunday sessions.
It's Sean who gives me the ball. That Watsonian game did a lot for me,
and I was lucky in that it was in front of the selectors.''
Derek Stark's last cap was that fateful day two years ago when almost
everything went wrong against our English pals at Twickenham. Craig
Chalmers broke both bones in an arm, Scotland's midfield fell apart
after he was carried off in pain, and the English won at a bad-tempered
canter. Stark hardly saw the ball, well, it wasn't that kind of day.
''We went down there thinking that we could do something, but look what
happened.''
After that came the World Cup Sevens, and a groin injury that required
surgery. The inference was undoubtedly there that Stark was past his
best and starting to break down. Blame, if it could ever be, was
apportioned at Stark's door for being injured, and anyone who denies
that is lying.
He knows that the road ahead is a hard one, and one good game from
him, and one bad game from the men in possession, does not necessarily
mean promotion into the big side. ''Look at the South African game,'' he
said. ''It was a very bad day for Scotland, but Kenny Logan came out of
it well. Just because the team plays badly, or the player has one bad
game, doesn't mean that I will be in. Yes, I was delighted that they
said I had been mentioned in the selection process, but I know that it
will be a hard slog.''
Thinking back, he has never fully explained why he left Kilmarnock to
go to Ayr, and then moved from Ayr to Boroughmuir.
A quick jaunt it is not from Kilmarnock to Edinburgh's south side, no
matter the fun it must be of a wet winter's rush hour, and many rue the
fact that he left the Glasgow District at all.
He won't be drawn. All he will allude to is Bruce Hay's kindness in
not insisting that he attend every session. When I spoke to him he was
just back from training at Ayr.
''I try to go through as much as I can, certainly on the Thursday
before a big league game, but I think everyone realises that it would
involve a lot.''
So can Stark make it back in the team? At 28 he is practically a
grandfather compared to the whipper-snappers currently in possession.
Craig Joiner, with four caps, is only 20, and Kenny Logan, the Stirling
farmer with 12 caps to his name already, is only 22. These are young
men, who will hardly give up without a fight.
''Yes, they're the guys in possession, and they are very very young. I
don't remember the lads ever being so young since I've been in the
squad,'' said Stark. ''They have a great deal of responsibility for guys
so young, but I relish the challenge I can provide to them.''
He has one ambition. ''I want to be in that World Cup squad,'' he
said. ''I think I would be suited to the hard grounds, instead of
finding myself up to my elbows in mud, in the middle of February, being
tackled by props at the corner flags.''
You know, if he keeps going the way he is, he might just make it too.

THE managing director of Wallets Marts in Castle Douglas, John Stuart
and senior auctioneer John Neil are to leave the company almost
immediately, leaving the firm with only one auctioneer.
Farmers appear to have little confidence in the board of directors.
There is growing pressure on the chairman, Tom Gillespie who farms at
South Park, Borgue, near Kirkcudbright, to stand down.
Mr Gillespie was elected chairman in 1991 when the shareholders
rejected a proposal by the then board of directors for Wallets to merge
with their near neighbours in Dumfries, Thomson, Roddick and Laurie so
that the two companies could rationalise their activities in an area
where four auction firms are in direct competition.
The recent trading performance of Wallets is, in comparison with
several other Scottish marts, excellent. The accounts for the last
trading year show a profit after tax of #121,000, although this has been
boosted by the sale of property. The shareholders were paid a dividend
of 25% on their #1 shares, of which 125,000 are issued. Bank borrowings
on a total throughput of #20m stand at just #200,000 -- again
conservative by the standards of many other auction firms.
At present there are two schools of thought among farmer shareholders
as to what should happen. The first declares that the long-term
interests would be better served by linking up with one of the larger
operators in the south-west which may be what the present board has in
mind considering that its plans to share an extra auctioneer with
Carlisle-based Harrison and Hetherington Ltd.
The second approach would see several members of the old board who
were ousted in 1991 over the controversial merger plans make a comeback.
The chairman of Wallets, Tom Gillespie took a relaxed view of the
situation yesterday when he commented: ''We are not in any way seeking a
partner and people should not read anything into the fact that we will
be sharing an auctioneer with H &amp; H because we have a link with them
through the electronic auction system. There have been far too many
thoughtless comments. We intend to remain a lean and competitive
company.''

NORWEGIAN sprinter Aham Okeke, who failed a drugs test in the USA last
year, was yesterday handed a three-month ban for the second time.
A special panel of the Norwegian Sports Federation upheld an earlier
ban which Okeke, a 24-year-old student in Texas, had contested. Okeke's
lawyer said they would appeal against the new ruling.
High levels of testosterone, a male hormone which acts as a steroid in
building muscle mass, were discovered when the Nigerian-born sprinter
was subjected to an out-of-competition test last December.

Margaret Hughes wanted to eat out in style but she wanted to do it
without spending a fortune. So she went right to the top, then scaled
down her expectations ever so slightly
SOMETIMES when you eat out you just want to forget about life and
whisk yourself away for a few hours. One restaurant where you can do
this is the Rogano. The restaurant is designed in the art-deco style so
popular in the 1930s when Rogano first opened -- 60 years later you
still step through those stained-glass doors and you could be aboard a
luxury liner, leaving the rain-lashed streets of Glasgow behind you,
even if it is just for one evening.
Eating here is not cheap, but you get what you pay for and the
standard of food and service, let alone the surroundings, is very good.
However, if you wander downstairs from the main restaurant, you will
find Cafe Rogano, which is equally stylish but not as expensive. The
walls of the restaurant are adorned with black and white photographs of
fabulously stylish names and faces -- Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Cary
Grant, J F K, with witty and thought-provoking messages relating to life
and love.
The menu is varied, starters include soup, steaming shrimp dim sum,
and baked filo of brie in a cranberry sauce. I can highly recommend the
dim sum, which come with a soya dip and some chopsticks. Served in a
steamer, there were five dim sum, which I found to be too many, but at
least the kitchen is not skimping on food. The brie was strong, runny,
and bubbling hot, and complemented perfectly by the sharpness of the
cranberry sauce.
Main courses reflect the importance of good Scottish fish and seafood,
but given that good value was high on my agenda, I decided to go ''back
to basics'' and try one of the menu's more traditional dishes --
Cumberland sausage with onion gravy and mashed potatoes.
The serving was huge, two very large sausages, a mound of mashed
potato and just the right quantity of gravy. The sausage had been well
cooked, the skin had stayed intact and it had not been burned on the
outside, the potatoes were the creamy sort that you know are destroying
your resolution to be careful with your diet. If I had any complaint, it
would be that the sausage needed a little more seasoning.
However, there were no complaints about the supreme of salmon
teriyaki. The piece of fish was large and meaty and the teriyaki sauce
delicately flavoured with pineapple and ginger, which did not overwhelm
the salmon.
I cannot resist the creme brulee which emerges from this kitchen, and
it did not disappoint. Neither did the caramel and walnut tart which
came in a huge slice, sweet and nutty and definitely for those who want
to leave feeling as if they have just eaten a feast.
What I really like about Cafe Rogano is that while you are certainly
paying less than you would upstairs in Rogano, you still get the feeling
of having really treated yourself, the food is good, the atmosphere
relaxed, and the clientele mixed. It is an enjoyable and affordable
place to eat.
Another famous Glasgow restaurant is the Buttery. Like Rogano the
emphasis is firmly based on fish, seafood, and game, served in relaxed
surroundings which are almost as interesting as the food itself. With
books, pictures, and curios taking up much of the wall space, it is a
very civilised restaurant.
The Buttery is well worth many visits but again it is not cheap.
However, if you are looking for a cheaper alternative, come out of the
restaurant, turn right and walk a few yards to the Belfry.
Pews are much in evidence in this downstairs restaurant, which can be
a little dark, but the welcome and the service is very friendly. The
menu is based around good Scottish fare, with fish, seafood, beef, and
lamb featured, as well as a variety of vegetarian alternatives.
Starters include a salad of bacon, prawns, avocado, and croutons in a
raspberry vinaigrette. This was a fair-sized portion, but the dressing
was a little too oily and the croutons were a little greasy. The soup of
the day was bacon and lentil broth. I like broth to be a big, hearty
bowl full of chunky vegetables -- this was a little too thin.
However, this was probably just as well, otherwise I would never have
managed to get even halfway through my main course of fish pie. Served
in an oval-shaped dish brimming over with the fluffiest mashed potatoes
was a selection of salmon, prawns, sole, and shark in a white sauce.
This was a huge portion that could easily have been shared by two.
For dessert, I just had to try the platter of home-made ice-cream.
This comprised raspberry, rum and raisin, and gingerbread ice-cream with
a Tia Maria flavoured yoghurt. It was sensational. The steamed
gingerbread sponge with egg custard was also superb -- the gingerbread
melted in the mouth, leaving that wonderful contented feeling that comes
from having eaten something which reminds you of those idyllic puddings
of your childhood.
I went looking for value for money and I got it at the Belfry: the
food was good and the service was impeccable.
Both Cafe Rogano and the Belfry have big reputations to live up to;
undoubtedly many people will eat in these restaurants expecting the same
experience as Rogano or the Buttery. This is misguided, Cafe Rogano and
the Belfry are separate restaurants that offer less formal, but equally
enjoyable, eating experiences and are well worth a visit.
Highly recommended
* Lang Bar &amp; Restaurant, Perth Theatre, 185 High Street, Perth. Tel:
01783 39136.
Theatre restaurants in Scotland have improved over the last few years.
The Lang Bar and Restaurant at Perth Theatre is one of the better ones.
Situated upstairs from the coffee bar, the restaurant offers a good
range of dishes that feature fish, beef, chicken, and lamb. There are
also vegetarian dishes available. The last time I visited I enjoyed some
delicious rainbow trout.
The portions are satisfying and the service is very friendly. For a
quick snack the home-made soup is a treat. If you cannot make lunch, the
home-baking in the coffee-bar comes highly recommended.
* Cafe Gandolfi, 64 Albion Street, Glasgow. Tel: 041 552 6813.
Cafe Gandolfi is a busy, trendy cafe in the heart of Glasgow's
Merchant City. It has a menu which serves everything from fruit scones
to gravlax.
No matter what time of day you visit, something on the menu will suit.
If not, try one of the daily specials.
Desserts include a very good creme brulee and a pot au chocolat that
is addictive. The cafe also serves good coffee. Service is brisk but
informed and the clientele includes students, shoppers, and business
people. It is worth waiting in the inevitable queue which forms at busy
times.
* Fouters Bistro, 2a Academy Street, Ayr. Tel: 0292 261391.
Fouters Bistro has been part of Ayr's culinary scene for more than two
decades and is worth a trip down the Clyde coast.
The menu leans very heavily towards good local produce, with west
coast mussels, Scottish salmon, lamb, and beef all very popular.
Desserts have that wonderful home-made appeal, don't leave without
trying Fouters bread-and-butter pudding.
The service is very friendly and the atmosphere relaxed in this hugely
popular restaurant.

I HAVE fond memories of visiting Brodick Castle gardens on Arran,
accompanied on occasion by Lady Jean Fforde.
I was always impressed with the magnificent collection of
rhododendrons.
Only a garden with space and shade can grow such beautiful
broad-leaved specimens.
As recently as last year I went to the Ben More gardens near Dunoon,
where they have a good collection.
Hardly a month passes when I do not pop into Finlaystone gardens at
Langbank, with early flowering plants in colour even now.
I am eagerly awaiting the big splash of colour soon.
To study rhododendrons and the botanically related azaleas can be
complicated.
Things have been made a great deal more difficult by the vast range of
species, varieties, and hybrids.
In general terms, the smaller rhododendrons and azaleas thrive
admirably in the average garden.
Perhaps they do best with some shelter from east and north winds.
Perhaps, too, they can do with a bit of shade from the mid-day sun.
I have always found them to be most accommodating, and have never gone
to the lengths of localised soil improvement with leaf mould, peat, or
other lime-free organic materials.
To give of their best, this, I suppose, is what they need. Anyway, you
should avoid badly drained areas, since they are surface-rooting shrubs
with a comparatively compact root system.
When bushes do not thrive I have usually found it is a result of
dryness, too much lime on the land, and occasionally the effect of
weedkillers absorbed by surface roots.
On the whole, both rhododendrons and azaleas seem fairly resistant to
pest attack.
In recent years, however, rhododendron mildew has become somewhat of a
scourge, attacking certain varieties and proving difficult to control.
Another problem can be bud blast, caused by a fungus that will turn
bud scales black in autumn and then grey with a covering of small black
bodies.
Spraying with copper fungicide may help. While there is an imposing
list of insect pests and diseases to which rhododendrons may fall prey,
in my experience they are remarkably trouble-free.
Such problems as I have encountered were mainly nutritional upsets due
to iron deficiency because of too much calcium in the soil.
In some instances, it was sheer poverty, with plants expected to grow
in barren soil devoid of organic matter.
Picking off spent flowers is good gardening practice, and there may be
the occasional shaping required with more vigorous varieties.
One of the beauties of container-grown plants is that you can see what
you are getting if you buy them in flower.

IT is seared on our souls that Scotland have not won in Paris since
1969, Jim Telfer's black and white try et al, but when were they
successful before that? And is it really true that the Scots have never
been victorious at Parc des Princes?
Brian Simmers can certainly answer the first one. The former Glasgow
Academical fly-half, now the managing director of a chain of hotels, was
the architect of the 1967 success at Colombes by a margin of 9-8 which,
under modern scoring values, would have translated into a 12-9 win for
France.
''I was rather surprised to be there at all,'' admits Brian, ''because
for my entire senior career I had been a fly-half. Indeed, the last time
I had played at centre was at my prep school, aged nine.
''Maybe some of the selectors saw me then, because they picked me in
that position, first against Australia, whom we beat 11-5, and then for
the French match. Everyone in my family was astonished.''
Full back Stewart Wilson kicked two first-half penalties for Scotland,
France replied with a try by winger Duprat. The home team then lost
centre Maso with a leg injury, and there were no replacements in these
days.
''Even so, we were still finding it difficult to pierce their
defence,'' recalls Simmers, ''until our fly-half, Davie Chisholm,
suggested I try a dropped goal.
''Well I did, from just on the twenty-five, and it sort of wobbled
over like a sack of potatoes. They scored another try, plus a
conversion, and we hung on grimly to the finish.''
So how does Brian Simmers feel about Scotland's chances of ending the
depressing run this afternoon? ''I would love to see it, but I am not
exactly confident.
''I would like to see the Scots playing a little more expansively in
the backs. That is what we will be required to do if we are to perform
well in the World Cup.
''On the credit side, I think we may have the makings of a very good
back row. Much of our success in two Grand Slams was down to excellence
in this department -- the Calders, Beattie, Leslie, Paxton, Jeffrey, etc
-- and I like the look of the present trio.''
Before answering the second question let me take you back some 69
years to the oldest living Scot to experience a win in Paris. Jimmie
Ireland is 92, living in Polmont, still attending all Scotland's home
games and as sharp as a crease.
He played at Colombes on January 2, 1926, when Scotland were
successful by 20 points to six. The Oxford University winger Alex
Wallace scored three tries and John Bannerman, later to be a major
political figure, had another.
''We let Wallace lead the team out, even though he was not the
captain, as he was going home to Australia after the match,'' Jimmie
remembers. ''Herbert Waddell was our fly-half and he chatted away in
French to the opposition for most of the time.''
I put it to the Grand Old Man that it could not have been much of a
Hogmanay for the players. ''Many of us were teetotallers then, including
myself and Bannerman.'' Some things do change.
Scotland have never won at the new Parc des Princes, but at the old
stadium, which was knocked down and rebuilt after the Second World War
-- just like Murrayfield -- they were victorious in 1913 and 1920.
Charlie Usher, of London Scottish, played in both games.
There was a major row in the first game. The French crowd barracked
the English referee, a Mr Baxter, and he required a police escort at the
end.
The Scottish authorities were so angry at the indiscipline they
refused to play France the following year. Some things never change.
* IF you fancy Scotland to break their run of defeats in Paris,
bookmakers William Hill are offering odds of 7-2 against such an
outcome, while the French are 6-1 on, and the draw 18-1.
In Cardiff, England are 9-2 on to defeat Wales and 100-30 on to win
the championship. Wales are 3-1 to defeat the English and tou can get
16-1 the draw.

LIVING in an officially-designated ancient monument might not always
be an attractive eperience. but Keppoch House, which lies between
Cardross and Helensburgh, is an elegant exception.
While many ancient monuments are crumbling ruins, this impressive
country house dating from the Regency era offers private family
accomodation with a number of large reception rooms which are ideal for
impressive entertaining.
The main part of the house includes five bedrooms, three with en-suite
facilities. The second floor and basement could provide separate
accomodation, either for relatives or for letting purposes.
The second floor currently serves as a large flat which is totally
self-contained. The basement also has its separate access and could
offer similar accomodation, with some renovation.
The property is thought to hae been built around 1820 for a Mr.
Alexander Dunlop, on the site of an old peel tower. It retains many of
the original architectural features including ornate plaster work.
There are several large wooden carved fireplaces and a number of
polished parquet floors. The panelling in the dining room is a
particular feature of the house and came from St Annes's Church in
Belfast in 1904.
Keppoch, built in stone under a slated roof, stands within 16 acres of
grounds which offer a wide selection of mature hard and softwoods, as
well as a variety of hybrid rhodedendrons.
The accomodation includes an inner hall with a polished oak floor,
elaborate cornice and ceilings depicting thistles, fleur-de-lis and
roses; carved mahogany doors with Grecian style architraves; drawing
room with polished wooden floor and and carved Adam fireplace; walk-in
safe; boot room and kitchen/breakfast room.
The first floor has five bedrooms while the self contained second
floor flat includes five bedrooms, laundry room, former billiard room,
now a sitting room and a kitchen. The basement includes three bedrooms,
kitchen, coal-cellar and pantry.
The current owners hae been in Keppoch House for 15 years. It is
listed by Historic Scotland as a Category B building. However, there is
nothing Category B about the asking price - agents Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
are seeking an A-grade #390,000 or more.

Packet snacks may seem an easy way to start a meal but, as Catherine
Brown and illustrator Fiona Taylor discover, there are many more
interesting options which don't take much preparation
IT'S EASY to see why it happens. A busy cook's first concern is
meal-on-to-table, so bags of crisps and nuts are tipped into bowls and
offered as first-taste for virgin palates. Yet without a great deal of
extra hassle there could have been a more amusing diversion. A punchy
palate rouser, like the vivid taste of crisp ryebread spread with
mustard-flavoured butter and covered with slices of chilled gravlax
followed by short blasts of icy vodka in thimble-like glasses.
This is Finland, by the way, where they understand how to amuse jaded
appetites with piquant cold table delicacies of salted and pickled meat
and fish accompanied by strong spirit poured from bottles which have
been iced -- along with the glasses -- in the deep freeze. It not only
livens the company and provides instant inner warmth, it also give the
cook a breathing space. Think of it this way: the first course is served
with the pre-dinner drinks, rather than at the table, and the cook's
attention can focus on the rest of the meal.
In Central European countries there are other traditions of
first-tastes which have their origins in simple peasant combinations of
contrasting flavours eaten informally before the hot meal. In Romania,
between glasses of plum liqueur, you get spicy meatballs and tiny hot
sausages, salty anchovies, crisp radishes and vinegar-pickled mushrooms.
They call this mezelicuri, which is nothing more than a piquant taste of
ingredients which are an everyday part of the kitchen larder.
In a more sophisticated and time-consuming mode there are French hors
d'oeuvres. Served as a selection of appetisers, and copied throughout
the world as the first course of a more formal dinner, they were
originally part of sophisticated eighteenth-century eating -- a la
Francaise -- later to become haute cuisine. They belong to the time when
all dishes were placed on the table at once, rather than in separate
courses. Piquant side dishes were used to fill up spaces and were
placed, literally, ''outside'' the main ''works'': hors d'oeuvres stood
spatially apart, to be nibbled throughout the meal.
An everyday first-taste in France is arguably a more memorable affair.
Amuse-gueules (mouth-amusers) are prepared as part of the meal and
served informally with aperitifs. When sardines are in season they are
grilled.
Garlic toasts take no more time than pouring a drink: some slices of
stale crusty bread which has been drying out in the oven are rubbed with
a garlic clove and fruity olive-oil is dribbled over the top.
Spreading the dried-out toasts with tangy pastes will take a little
longer. So will chopping raw vegetables for crudites with piquant dips,
or making a pissaladiere (onion tart), or a deep-fried nibble along the
lines of Japanese tempura, or a flat omelette cut into squares -- but
they make a better beginning than boring than crisps and nuts.
Recipes
COURGETTE OMELETTE
The Spanish serve chunky squares of these moist, firm, flat omelettes
-- where the added flavourings totally dominate the eggs -- as tapas
with glasses of chilled fino.
Ingredients:
Half a cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) olive-oil
1 lb (500 g) sweet onions, finely sliced
Salt
1 lb (500 g) courgettes, very finely diced
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
2 garlic cloves, crushed
Freshly ground white pepper
4 (size 3) eggs, beaten
Method: Heat about two tablespoons of the oil in a deep 9-inch frying
pan and add the onions and salt. Cook uncovered over a low heat until
they are soft but uncoloured. Remove and add about another three
tablespoons of oil and then the courgettes. Salt them and cook over a
high heat for about five minutes, or until they are lightly coloured,
tossing occasionally. Chop the parsley and garlic together. Add to the
courgettes and cook for a few seconds until their scent is released. Add
the onions and mix through. Remove from the pan and add half the
remaining oil. Mix the eggs and vegetables, season with pepper, and pour
into the hot pan.
Cook over a low heat until the omelette sets but remains soft on top.
Hold a flat plate over the pan, invert. Pour the remaining oil into the
pan. Leave to heat, then slide the omelette back into the pan. Cook for
another minute then slide on to a wooden board. Cut into 1" squares and
serve tepid or cold.
BOHEMIENNE is an intensely flavoured French stew-cum-puree of
aubergines, tomatoes, and salty anchovies which is spread on garlic
crusts or toasts.
Ingredients:
6 tablespoons olive-oil
1 large onion, finely sliced
3 garlic cloves
1 lb (500 g) aubergines
1 lb (500 g) tomatoes, peeled or 1 x 200g tin of chopped tomatoes
3 fillets of salted anchovies
Salt and pepper
Method: Heat four tablespoons of the oil in a wide saute pan and cook
the onion until soft but not coloured. Add the aubergines and cook,
stirring occasionally over a medium heat until they have completely
softened. Add the tomatoes. Lower the heat and cook, stirring and
crushing occasionally until it is a thick puree (about 30 minutes).
Meantime put two tablespoons oil into another pan and add the anchovies.
Cook over a very low heat until they begin to break up when shaken.
Add with their oil to the bohemienne and mix through. Season and serve
tepid or cold spread on garlic croutons or toasts.

TAKE a novel, set in Scotland at the time of the '45, a novel that is
full of adventure and dramatic set pieces and exciting action. Take a
novel that is historically accurate yet inventive and romantic, a novel
that in the words of the critic Joy Hendry ''makes Kidnapped look Enid
Blyton-ish''.
Take a novel that is at once bright and bleak; a novel that is
beautifully written, psychologically acute, and devastating in its
portrayal of the effects of war.
Take a novel whose central character is a spy, whose plot turns on
double-crossing, duality, and deception -- a novel that in many ways
anticipates the fiction of John le Carre.
Take a novel that, supremely, is about Scotland, the Scotland of 1745
and 1746, but also the Scotland of today; a Scotland that, then and now,
is divided and confused.
Does such a novel exist?
It does, and it is called Flemington. It was written by Violet Jacob,
published in 1911, and thereafter virtually ignored until it was
republished a few weeks ago by the Association for Scottish Literary
Studies.
There are two sadnesses here. The first is that such a fine novel
should have been ignored by so many Scots for so long; the second is
that, having at last been republished, it is not more readily available.
Not that there is anything wrong with the ASLS edition; on the
contrary, it is beautifully produced, and sensitively edited by Carol
Anderson with helpful notes that are at once scholarly and accessible.
But it retails at #25, obviously beyond the means of many potential
buyers, and is not stocked by many Scottish booksellers or, indeed, by
many Scottish public libraries.
Dr Anderson, who teaches Scottish literature at Glasgow University,
confesses that she has become almost obsessed by Violet Jacob. She first
came across her work when asked to review a reprint of the writer's
short stories called The Lum Hat.
Before that, she had known of Jacob only as a minor poet writing in
Scots. Then, when she was living in Japan a few years ago, she was
asked, out of the blue, to edit Jacob's Indian letters and diaries.
These were eventually published by Canongate in 1990, and well received.
Anderson was now fully convinced of Jacob's status as a major writer,
and she persuaded the ASLS to publish Flemington, probably the best of
Jacob's five novels.
Jacob was born Violet Kennedy-Erskine in 1863 in the magnificent
William Adam-designed House of Dun (now owned by the National Trust for
Scotland) near Montrose. She married an Irishman, Arthur Jacob, and
accompanied him to India, where he served with the British Army.
After her husband's regiment left India they lived for a time in
Egypt, and then stayed on the Welsh Marches -- the setting for another
of her novels -- before returning to the family home in Angus. By now
she was writing a lot of poetry, mainly in Scots. It was published by,
among others, Hugh MacDiarmid, who of course, lived in Montrose for a
time.
Anderson said: ''Violet Jacob was quite aristocratic, a grand lady,
and MacDiarmid was a bit condescending to her, though at the same time
he approved of her. He liked her poetry but tended to dismiss her prose
work -- he had no sensitivity for historical fiction.''
Jacob may have been a toff, but she was certainly not a snob, and
lacked the rigid mindset of many Victorian ladies in the colonies.
''When she was in India she would go off exploring on her own, which was
not the done thing. She could be dry and acerbic about the British and
she really did love India in her slightly patrician way,'' Anderson
said.
''She was always an excellent observer, a painter as well as a writer.
Her writing about India is so fresh and enthusiastic it makes the
writing of E M Forster and others seem quite pallid by comparison.''
Jacob's son Harry, her only child, died at the Somme in 1916. She
never really recovered from his death, though she had many years to
live. The evening of her life was spent quietly at Kirriemuir. She died
in 1946, and is buried with her husband at Dun.
Although a few others, notably Joy Hendry, are determined that Violet
Jacob should not rest in obscurity, Carol Anderson finds herself in the
role of champion-in-chief. She is genuinely appalled at the neglect of
Jacob. Anderson will, no doubt, write a biography one day, but before
then the immediate goals must be to get Flemington out as a reasonably
priced paperback and to get the other novels published.
Meanwhile, it would be silly to divulge too much of the plot of
Flemington; there are so many twists and turns that the reader is
constantly suprised and delighted.
The novel is set mainly in Jacob's beloved Angus, although there are
some marvellous passages based in Edinburgh, including a post-Culloden
confrontation between the Duke of Cumberland and Christian Flemington,
grandmother of the book's young hero.
Jacob handles her characters superbly, with a judicious mixture of
sympathy and dry detachment; and she places them in the context of
momentous and tragic historical events with skill and precision.
There remains, hoewever, one central question: if Flemington is so
good, why has it been ignored for 80 years and more? Carol Anderson can
only point to what she calls the Scottish literary ''fixation'' with
certain writers, notably Scott, Burns, MacDiarmid, Stevenson, and Neil
Gunn. ''It is not a consipiracy exactly, but literary histories do tend
to repeat themselves. If you're left out once, you seem to be out for
good.''
She remains confident that Violet Jacob can be revived. ''I taught
Flemington to some students a year ago. It gripped them completely.
Without exception, they loved it.'' Indeed, what encourages her most is
the reaction of young people to Flemington.

THE BIRTHDAY GIRL By Stephen Leather
Hodder and Stoughton, #15.99
THE birthday girl of the title is Mersiha. She is 15, turning 16, with
long black locks. There are a dozen white hairs at the parting. They
make a head count of a symbolic, maybe literal, sort. For Mersiha is a
victim and creature of the war in Bosnia.
The book opens with the kidnap of Tony Freeman, who has gone to
Sarajevo to sell mine-disposal systems to the Serbs. Mersiha is the
brutalised 12-year-old sister of his Bosnian kidnapper. Freeman manages
against the odds to befriend her and, after his own bloody release,
rescues her from prison camp. Three years later she has become an
all-American girl in the prosperous suburbs of Baltimore. Or has she?
Can the past really be relegated to sessions with the inept psychiatrist
Dr Brown?
Thus the scene is set for Stephen Leather's latest cleverly plotted
thriller. Leather's journalistic antecedents -- the bookjacket omits to
mention his formative years on The Herald, shame on you Steve! -- are,
as always, obvious. His writing is intelligent, spare; his manipulation
of current affairs masterly.
He imagined an ingenious solution to the Irish Troubles in The
Chinaman; drew on his first-hand knowledge of the jumpiness of Hong Kong
to lend weight to The Vets. Now the contemporary issues he exploits so
shrewdly include not just the Bosnian imbroglio, but the effect of the
peace dividend on the US arms industry (bankruptcy and unemployment for
starters), and the translation of Russian thugs to America's underworld.
His duo of nasties are a kind of Chechen Kray brothers. The hapless
balloonists of the Rocky denouement are not the only people to get blown
away. Squeamish readers be warned.
Apart from the enigmatic Mersiha, the book's main character is her
adoptive father Freeman. And here Leather is breaking new ground in
making him such a decent, civilised figure in the midst of all the
mandatory sleaze. He worries genuinely about the workforce in his
family-run business (it makes mine-disposal systems rather than mines);
he's loyal to his wife; fiercely protective of his Bosnian girl, whose
reciprocated loyalty ironically triggers off much of the violence. He
himself does violence to no-one in the course of the plot. Latterly,
indeed, he spends most of his time hugging Mersiha and calling her
''pumpkin''. All this without appearing a bit of a pumpkin himself. He
comes from Scotland (where peregrine falcons apparently abound). So
perhaps his moral superiority can be credited to his Caledonian
upbringing.
Freeman's wife loves him, too, though she plays the nymphomaniac.
There's a lot of mechanical sex in the book. Leather's women are as
predatory as his men. The most chilling of the subsidiary villains is a
big blonde whose father abused her as a child.
One of the disconcerting characteristics of Leather's style is to
treat all his characters with the same factual weight. We are allowed
glimpses into the background of each -- the aforesaid blonde, the
private eye who ends up dangling in a meat refrigerator plant, the pushy
black lawyer whose faked suicide has Stephen Milligan overtones --
before they are dispatched.
The descriptions of ethnic cleansing and systematic rape in Bosnia are
crucial to the plot, but may seem to be exploiting real tragedy for
fictional effect. On the other hand, these dreadful things did happen
and that, rather than the reiteration of them, is the obscenity.
The Birthday Girl's ending -- on a cliff-top in northern Scotland --
is more sentimental than convincing. The Freemans as happy family? That
new white-hair count surely precludes it.

DREW Docherty's hopes of becoming world bantam-weight champion lay in
tatters in Cumbernauld's Tryst Centre last night when he was stopped
inside four rounds by WBO champion Alfred ''The Cobra'' Kotey.
This was only the 29-year-old British champion's second defeat in 17
contests, but Kotey, with just one loss in 21 outings, showed what a
good champion he is in his second defence.
Kotey dominated the first round with accurate jabs but Docherty
sparked into life in the following round, forcing Kotey on to his back
foot with good combinations.
The champion came out for the third prepared to trade punches and when
the Scot was caught with a long right cross to the chin, he tumbled.
He was up at five but the writing was on the wall. The bout was to
last only 50 seconds longer -- as long as it took Kotey to steady and
throw two more looping rights to the head. Docherty again thudded to the
canvas and when the count again reached five, his cornermen leapt into
the ring.
Docherty told me later: ''I gave it my best shot but it wasn't good
enough. Kotey was far too good for me and that's about all I can say. He
proved himself a great champion and I have never been hit as hard as
that. I can't remember ever being punched to the canvas in my career.
''All I want to do now is have a rest and think about my future. I
believe there is still a lot for me to achieve in the ring but I am
about to become a father next month and that is the main thing for me at
the moment.''
Kotey said: ''Drew was such a brave challenger. When I hit him the
first time and knocked him down I just didn't think he would get up, but
he did, and then tried to make a fight of it.''
Kotey's manager Mike Jacobs said: ''We have nothing but admiration for
Docherty. As Alfred said, he is one brave guy, but we firmly believe
that Kotey is the best bantam in the world and he will go on to unify
the title.''
One good moment for the Scottish fans came when Willie Quinn, the
super-middleweight from Tranent, celebrated his twenty-third birthday by
knocking out Martin Jolley in two minutes five seconds of the fifth
round -- his fifteenth win in 16 contests.
Stirling super-feather Hugh Collins also was impressive, gaining his
tenth wins in 11 contests by stopping Paul Wynn in the third. Other
results:
Light-welter -- Kevin McKenzie (Hartlepool) outpointed Alan Peacock
(Cumbernauld) six rounds. Super-feather -- Dean Pithie (Coventry) beat
Kid McAuley (Doncaster) rsc third. Super-bantam -- Spencer Oliver
(London) outpointed Des Gargano (Manchester) four rounds.

EVER since William McIlvanney slipped a volume of Camus into his
Glasgow cop Jack Laidlaw's drawer, literary detectives have had
existentialism like a bad cold. None more intensely, however, than the
nameless detective-sergeant hero of the late Derek Raymond's Factory
novels, a man much given to wintry speculations about the nature of
freedom and good and evil in the intervals between speaking severely to
murder suspects at the Department of Unexplained Deaths.
Dead Man Upright (Warner, #4.99) has him hunting down a serial killer
in London bedsit-land, driven by a bitter pity for the victims, fury at
the world that lets such things happen, and guilt for having failed to
stop it himself. Like Camus's Dr Rieux in The Plague, Raymond's
detective sees himself as a fighter in the war against death; and if
that sounds like mighty fancy talk about a detective thriller, all I can
say is that Raymond's bleak humanist vision transcends the genre.
Derek Raymond's own life -- expelled from Eton, wide experience in
smuggling and in fronting dodgy property companies, running with the bad
boys in 1960s London -- could one day make a good book, but his own
version, The Hidden Files (Warner, #5.99) isn't quite it.
The obsessive, slightly manic tone of his novels turns out to be
unfortunately close to his own voice, and too often a raffish anecdote
is derailed into an incoherent digression about murderers, the ''black
novel'', spiritualism, politics, and goodness knows what. You get the
feeling that you'd have enjoyed meeting him in a pub, but not for very
long.
T Coraghessan Boyle, however, you could talk to forever. Best known
for his dizzyingly odd short stories set against a realistic blue-collar
American background, he should become more familiar as a novelist via
the Alan Parker film of The Road To Wellville (Granta, #6.99), a benign
and breezy fantasia upon the life of Dr John Harvey Kellogg -- health
crank, inventor of the cornflake, frank foe of sex, and the Vasco da
Gama of the digestive tract.

FRANK Bruno was 25 when he made the first of his three unsuccessful
attempts to clasp his mighty hands around the richest prize in sport.
Yet, approaching his thirty-fourth birthday, Bruno ironically finds
himself better placed than ever to claim a version of a world boxing
title which could soon be ripped into three pieces.
Frank's dream may not, this time, transform itself into the nightmares
induced by Tim Witherspoon, Mike Tyson, and Lennox Lewis between July
19, 1986, and October 1, 1993.
His new promoter, Frank Warren, has guaranteed the delivery to Britain
of WBC champion Oliver McCall this summer and, buoyed by home advantage,
Bruno would be given more than a fighting chance of doing what Lennox
Lewis failed to do on that dire night at Wembley last September.
Inflicting mayhem on Puerto Rican Rodolfo Marin in the peaceful
environs of Shepton Mallet tonight is first on Bruno's agenda.
Bruno said: ''I've got to be focused on Marin, concentrated. If you
jump the gun you can come unstuck. It's crazy to think that way. Lennox
may have been thinking of the millions he was going to make for fighting
Bowe.''
Marin, 30, from Rio Piedras, won his first 17 fights, stopping 14 men,
-- eight of them in the first round -- but the opposition was light
years away from high class. Significantly, he has lost his three biggest
fights -- against Tyrell Biggs, Bowe, and the highly-ranked American
Indian Joe Hipp.
But Bruno is not deceived. ''I've seen that Hipp fight on video and I
reckon Marin won it. He's a creditable opponent with a respectable
record, and I can't pussyfoot around. I've got to show him respect . . .
a little bit.
''I've got a carrot dangling in front of me and I can't mess about,
because he's certainly not going to mess around in there.''
This will be Bruno's bow before the ITV cameras at peak-viewing time,
and his millions of fans will be wise not to be late switching on to
watch their hero.
After that, Warren says: ''Styles make fights. McCall is exactly right
for Frank. Even Lennox Lewis has said so. If ever there was a fight
Bruno could win, this is it.''
On the undercard, some seven stones down the weight-scale, Bristol's
Ross Hale defends his British light-welter title against Birmingham's
Malcom Melvin.
Victory in this mandatory defence will earn Hale outright ownership of
a Lonsdale Belt, and possibly a world shot against the only man to beat
the legendary Julio Cesar Chavez -- the fine WBA champion, Frankie
Randall.

WALTER WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity. By Neal
Gabler. Picador, #20.
AT THE height of his fame, Walter Winchell was the most powerful
journalist in the world. He was also -- and this biography makes it seem
like no coincidence -- one of the most unpleasant men ever to disgrace
his profession.
As Gabler's subtitle suggests, Winchell's contribution to culture was
not the kind for which they hand out Nobel Prizes. His transmutation in
the twenties and thirties of news into gossip, and gossip into political
power, established the American fixation with celebrity which has since
overwhelmed (witness the O J Simpson freak show) and poisoned the globe.
The man who once said ''democracy is where everybody can kick
everybody else's ass -- but you can't kick Winchell's'' would have been
well pleased. His sort of journalism, now the dominant form, reduces all
human intercourse to the theatrical (Winchell got his start in
vaudeville, after all) and renders all events, whether wars, elections,
or murders as banal morality tales. Information is the least of it;
infotainment, a word unknown to Winchell that he would have understood
perfectly, is all. Yet when it is remembered that at one time 50 million
Americans were listening to his radio broadcasts or reading his daily
columns, the scope for destructiveness is plain.
Winchell's resentments were bred in poverty. Born Walter Winschel, the
son of Russian Jewish immigrants to New York, he seems never to have
been without the grudges that later made him perfectly suited for
witch-hunting. He was poor but he was never happy, and his style of
journalism had as much to do with a craving for recognition and respect
-- with his own celebrity -- as it ever had to do with the drudgery of
facts.
His enemies, acquired like battle honours, accused Winchell of
trivialising everything he touched. But H L Mencken, another, smarter
populist, credited him with enlarging the American vernacular, of going
''on strike against the vast impersonality which, at the time of his
advent, was deadening the American newspaper into a kind of daily
Congressional Record''.
Amidst all his sins, Winchell had one virtue: he was absurdly,
triumphantly readable.
Then, as now, the US press was famously self-satisfied. The great and
the good protected their own, brandishing ''good taste'' as a weapon
much as the ''right to privacy'' is brandished today by politicians and
celebrities disinclined to justify their behaviour. Winchell blew the
conspiracy apart, granted the public its right to know, brought high
culture low, and acquired vast power for himself in the process.
Yet it was inevitable -- fittingly, given his comic-book ethics --
that such a man would be suborned in his turn. For one thing, the real
rulers of America could not afford to allow him to remain truly
independent. Equally, the contradictions of Winchell's position -- a
star writing about stars, fame's willing victim -- eventually made his
role untenable. And times change, as times do. Radio and print
surrendered to television and Winchell, to his chagrin, flopped on TV.
In the end, dumped by the Hearst press after 38 years, he was reduced to
taking out an ad in Variety begging for work.
It would be a mistake, nevertheless, to regard Winchell as a
historical curiosity. Gabler's meticulous book is as much a study of the
corrosive effects of fame, of the cult as well as the culture of
celebrity in America, as it is the study of a man. When people are
famous for being famous, and news is just another branch of show
business, one truth is as good as another, and no truth is worth
anything very much.

A NEWSLETTER from the Strathclyde group of the National Council for

Galloway are still in Scotland!
It seems a sub-committee was set up to review constituencies
countrywide and decided the group should be attached to the north west
of England.
However, commonsense prevailed after an exchange of views.
The result? Dumfries and Galloway remain where they have always been.
Welcome home, folks.

IF you have been sitting looking gloomily out at the weather, don't
get too depressed. There are some little tasks to keep your hand in.
Why not introduce some aromatic smells into the garden? First, plant a
lavender. You can get a pot-grown specimen for #5 to #6.
All you need is a fairly dry sunny spot. Make sure the lavender does
not get its wet feet.
Everything should then be well. You can even make a hedge, setting out
plants about a foot apart.
Alternatively, raise lavender from seed. Sow about March or April, in
the house.
There are several varieties, such as Munstead, which are a good choice
for the average garden.
Another aromatic plant is eucalyptus.
If you live around the coast, reasonably sheltered from nagging winds,
eucalyptus will grow well. There are some beauties around Loch Fyne.
It is a good idea to grow a succession of young plants. Keep them as
tub plants rather than outdoor specimens.
Bear in mind that a vigorous tree will get a fair height and take a
good bit of room.

MANAGING clubs who are fighting for promotion to the big time or just
to survive there means pressure. But when the top four teams in the
first division have to do battle again in the Scottish Cup's knock-out
basis, and a ''ghost'' from the past turns up on your new patch, it is
reassuring to know that the heads of the houses involved have maintained
their sanity.
Airdrie against Dunfermline at Broadwood is a match labelled as a
battle because of the so-called animosity between the clubs. They are
capable of good football, want to be winners, and both will do what
comes naturally -- go flat out for a place in the quarter-final stage
that should bring in much-needed cash. The one wish is that the skills
of both sides will come out on top.
The Fifers have Jackie McNamara suspended, and so far have had three
draws over 90 minutes with the Broadwood side, two of them goalless.
Dundee's slip has been showing recently, and coming up against Raith
Rovers, who are on a run of nine straight victories -- and the only
squad who can do the cup double this season -- is not good for the blood
pressure of either management.
Dundee have a full squad from which to choose, although manager Jim
Duffy will make changes from the side which lost in the league at Ayr,
while Raith stick by the squad from last week, although top scorer
Gordon Dalziel staked a claim to make a return after having been
dropped, by knocking in a hat trick in a reserve game.
Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten will see a few weel-kent faces when
East Fife visit Rugby Park. Totten managed the Fifers until he left to
join the premier division side at the start of the season.
He now has Mark Skilling doubtful because of injury, but Colin McKee,
who has been missing since the last round of the cup against Morton
because of an ankle injury, is back in contention.
St Johnstone want to forget the cup. Manager Paul Sturrock read the
riot act after the Perth side were beaten by Stenhousemuir. Today, in
the league, they have the chance to get that off their chests when they
face Hamilton Accies at McDiarmid Park.

ANTHONY Brannen, one of a group of young British decathletes whose
avowed aim is to delete the name of former Olympic champion Daley
Thomson from the record books, is chasing the UK indoor heptathlon mark
this weekend in Glasgow.
Brannen, the World Student Games bronze medallist who fell just 11
points short of Alex Kruger's UK best a fortnight ago, tries again in
the Scottish multi-events championships today and tomorrow at the Kelvin
Hall, where nearly 200 competitors are entered.
But Falkirk's Jamie Quarry, eighth in the Commonwealth Games decathlon
with a Scottish record, and who also set a Scottish best to snatch the
heptathlon title last year, is unlikely to defend today, following a
gastric upset.
However, Edinburgh Woollen Mill's Emma Lindsay hopes to regain the
women's pentathlon title which she won two years ago -- and surrendered
last year only by the narrowest of margins.
Her conqueror then, Sarah Damm, is absent, but Arbroath's Sarah
Ramminger, the under-20 champion who won two Scottish Universities'
titles last month, has stepped up to the senior ranks, and Lindsay will
have further competition from Fiona Watt, City of Glasgow's native
record holder in the triple jump.
* EDINBURGH Athletic Club's Karen Macleod, newly-selected by Britain
for the marathon at the World championships this year, makes a rare
competitive appearance in Scotland tomorrow when she races the
Grangemouth 10,000m round-the-houses event.

MODEL OCCUPATION: The Channel Islands under German rule. By Madeleine
Bunting
Harper Collins, #20.
MANY have wondered what a German occupation of Britain might have been
like. Some idea is given by the history of the one part of the country
that was captured and ruled by the Germans from 1940 until 1945, ''our
dear Channel Islands'' in Churchill's phrase announcing the end of the
war.
The Germans did try to make it a model occupation. Hitler was
especially keen to provide cheap propaganda for the reassurance of
mainland opinion after the invasion he planned following Dunkirk. The
German army was asked to be on its best behaviour and the islands' civil
authorities more or less collaborated with their masters to avoid an
even worse fate then defeat.
It was a generally benign experience, but it had many moments of
cruelty and the islanders were able to see the real face of Nazism in
the frightful and inhumane treatment meted out to the slave labour
(often from eastern Europe) imported to build the immense concrete
defence systems designed to frustrate any reconquest.
The mask steadily dropped with time, but many people managed civilised
relations on both sides. The price of these was mostly to the Germans'
advantage, and there is little doubt that more than the civil
authorities (but they, certainly) slipped into moral ambiguity.
Madeleine Bunting handles such matters, and others, with tact and
compassion. Her book, which depends on many interviews with survivors,
is a fine piece of work, especially in this department where her
restraint and sympathy come to be shared by her readers.
The account is full of irony, and may disguise to some extent her own
labours: for she tracked down in Russia some of the former slaves and
furnishes their personal histories, which did not end with freedom in
1946 since, on returning to their own country, they were usually seized
by the KGB and sent to the labour camps somewhat similar to those of
Alderney.
Evidence that they had not volunteered to help the Nazis, but had in
some cases served the French Resistance, was stolen from them and
confined to the KGB archives (in which Miss Bunting has also toiled)
until Glasnost.
The British demilitarised the Islands without telling anyone (the
occupation was unopposed). That was the first of many official British
boobs, and the record of the Home Office's subsequent dealings with the
islands and our own folk until their liberation is so bad that you might
think it was the Foreign Office.
There was no meaningful resistance on the Islands, and the reasons for
that are thoroughly explored here. Briefly, local opinion quickly came
to feel resistance was futile, a conclusion with which it is hard to
disagree. The Channel Islands are small and, after some modest
evacuations and the absence of more than 10,000 islanders serving in the
British armed forces, the population was almost equalled by the
invaders. By the end these totalled about 37,000 starving soldiers, who
had sometimes to be succoured by islanders. (There was not a cat or dog
left at liberation: all had been eaten.)
The mainland authorities do not come out of this account well: the
loss of some national territory seems to have unhinged their judgment,
replacing rational calculation by a sense of shame. At least in 1945 the
islanders did not suffer from avenging liberators. The shame insisted
that Britons could not have collaborated. The reality, here exposed, was
different, if complicated. What are we to think of Dolly and Willi, the
Island and German lovers who married?. Toast them, I think: it is no
small part of Madeleine Bunting's achievement to allow their love to
shine out and touch readers as much as themselves.

PRINCE Naseem Hamed is being lined up for a world-title bid in late
May, and may be forced to relinquish his European bantamweight crown.
Promoter Frank Warren confirmed yesterday that he had made a $500,000
offer to world super-bantamweight champion, Wilfredo Vasquez of Puerto
Rico, to defend his WBA version in the Sheffield boxer's home town.
The 21-year-old ring wizard has been having difficulty making the
bantam poundage and may soon concentrate his efforts at super-bantam.
But first Naseem has an important WBC international title defence
scheduled for March 4, when he faces Argentinian challenger Sergio
Liendo at the Livingston Forum.

MIM cleared their first hurdle in the European Men's Indoor Hockey Cup
at Meadowbank last night with a 6-3 victory over Irish side Avoca Mazda.
But the margin of MIM's victory did not fully reflect their
overwhelming superiority. They twice enjoyed the lead through Gavin
Markham and Jonathan Smyth, only to have their advantage nullified by
Trevor Dagg's two penalty corner conversions.
But Markham rattled in four goals in just three minutes to put the
result beyond the Dubliners.
Stockholm beat the strongly fancied St Albans 9-7, Olten scored a 5-1
victory over Raca, and Royal White Star beat the Croatians, Jedinstvo,
7-5.
Meanwhile, in the women's championship at Russelsheim in Germany,
Edinburgh Ladies were beaten 7-1 by Valdulez. Other results:
Slough 5, Victoria 3; Stade Francais 5, Inter Eurovil 11; Russelsheim
8, Brescia 1.

IF some of your conifers are looking a little brown, almost as if they
had been burned, don't worry too much.
They are almost certain to recover. The reason for their appearance is
the cold snaps we have had recently.
The leaflets are frozen then rapidly thawed by sun. This is what
causes leaf dessication and a burned look.
Cold winds may also have had a part to play. This is generally
one-sided burning. With frost, the whole conifer is affected.
There are no therapeutic measures you can take to speed up
rejuvenation.
Nature will take its own time. Your conifers should be green and
sparkling again by the spring, provided they have been well established
in the first place.

SEED prices are lower this year as a result of a quiet war that has
going on behind the scenes between the seed companies, writes Ian Walls.
A reduction in prices has been made possible by trimming operational
costs, and the person to benefit most is the gardener.
I started my career in the seed trade, but everything has changed
since I was a lad.
New varieties, pest and disease-resistance, improved germination, and
many other innovations came in.
It all has to be paid for, and prices increased over the last few
years. So it is good to see the reverse trend happening.
Speaking to a prominent garden centre manager the other day, he was
saying it was not before time.
The public were being asked to pay through the nose, as many gardeners
were not looking for the ultimate performance from seeds, just a
reasonable turn-out.
I am pleased to see some prices coming down, even if it does mean
fewer seeds in the packet.
Often, there are too many anyway. In fact, I use only about 50% on
average.
Save some money, and still get what you want. That's a good idea.

JOHN Daly moved to within one stroke of leader Peter Senior after the
second round of the Australian Masters tournament in Melbourne
yesterday.
Senior shot a three-under-par 70 at Huntingdale for a seven-under
total of 139, one ahead of compatriot Andre Stoltz and the big-hitting
Daly.
Ian Garbutt carded a second-round 73 to lie two shots adrift of the
leader along with American Tom Watson and Australian Lucas Parsons.
Daly, who unleashed one drive of 325 metres on his way to a 69, said
he was determined to make an impact after having missed the cut at the
Heineken Classic in Perth two weeks ago.
''I feel like I'm a lot different on this course,'' he said. ''I might
not be as loose or smile as much, but I'm more focused.''
Australian Ian Baker-Finch missed the cut to prolong a miserable run
of form which has prompted the former Open champion to consider quitting
the game. Leading aggregates (Australian unless stated):
139 -- P Senior 69, 70.
140 -- A Stolz 72, 68; J Daly (USA) 71, 69.
141 -- I Garbutt (Britain) 68, 73; T Watson (USA) 69, 72; L Parsons
73, 68.
142 -- P Teravainen (USA) 68, 74; R Allenby 69, 73.

O'Malley 71, 73; W Grady 72, 72; P Moss (USA) 72, 72; A Gilligan 75, 69;

PAKISTAN captain Salim Malik has been fined 50% of his match fee
(#100) for suggesting that umpire Ian Robinson had interfered with the
ball during the second day's play in the third Test against Zimbabwe on
Thursday.
Salim also was handed a two-Test suspended sentence, while opener
Aamir Sohail was given a severe reprimand for the same offence. He
escaped a fine.
The statement released by match referee Jackie Hendriks and Zimbabwe
Cricket Union chief executive Don Arnott said that the umpires --
Robinson and the Australian Steve Randell -- had reported the players
after they had suggested that the Zimbabwean Robinson: ''had wet one
side of the ball, currently in use, or interfered with it in some way.''

DUMBARTON and Clyde get on with trying to achieve the primary
objective this season, gaining promotion out of the second divison. But
six places and 10 points below the Sons, Queen of the South have not
given up of a place upstairs.
Victory at Meadowbank and then the salvaging of a point at home to
East Fife have taken Billy McLaren's team to the 28-point mark. A home
game today against Brechin City represents an excellent chance for
Queens to become thirty-somethings.
On 31 points they would be three wins clear of Meadowbank and would
have attached themselves to the long string of promotion contenders.
It would help the Dumfries cause if Dumbarton can be stopped through
Clyde winning at Boghead. With the leaders, Stenhousemuir, on cup duty,
Dumbarton manager Murdo MacLeod wants his team to move to within a point
of the top.
However, Clyde manager Alex Smith sees it differently. After a defeat
at home to Berwick he believes that his men can make amends and that the
dog-eat-dog pattern can work in Clyde's favour.
The key game in the third division is at Firs Park. If East
Stirlingshire can beat the leaders, Forfar, the promotion race could hot
up for seven clubs -- and Ross County could go top.
County, two points off the lead, have scored 11 goals in winning their
past three home games. The visitors to Dingwall are lowly Arbroath, who
ended a winless run only in midweek when they beat Queen's Park.
Montrose, five points off the lead, will expect to win when Queen's
make another visit to Angus.
Alloa, with Neil Bennett and Willie Newbigging suspended after red
cards in the 6-0 rout at Dingwall last week, will try to atone at home
to the other Highland side, Caley Thistle.
Manager Jimmy Crease has set a short-term target for Albion Rovers --
to get off the bottom rung by overhauling Arbroath. That will take a few
weeks at best and they have no easy task today, at home to Cowdenbeath.

EAST Kilbride's Craig Ronald has been too busy playing golf, against
medical advice it has to be said, to experience the full enormity of the
responsibilities of parenthood. Indeed, the 25-year-old has seen his
three-week-old daughter Taylor for precisely 15 minutes.
A windswept second-round 71 in the #250,000 Lexington South African
PGA championship qualified him two shots inside the limit for the next
two days at the Wanderers Club in mile-high Johannesburg, thus
preventing him flying home for the weekend. He is not complaining too
much, however, because his 144 total -- nine behind new leader Nic
Henning -- has guaranteed him the first cheque of his rookie season.
''I have to keep trying and I am going from here to Valencia in Spain
for next week's Mediterranean Open. Obviously I am desperate to see my
daughter again, and my wife Lorraine is trying to arrange to bring the
baby to London for the day on Monday,'' said the homesick Scot.
Yet he ought not to be playing at all. He damaged his back pulling a
weed from his driveway last October and was in such pain in Gran Canaria
last week the European Tour physiotherapist advised him to rest for at
least two weeks.
Yesterday he had 16 pars, one double bogey, and a solitary birdie as
iron hard greens and a strong wind ensured Wayne Westner's opening 62
would not be under threat, least of all by Westner himself. The
first-round leader finished with a 75 to go from three ahead of the
field to two behind Henning (66).
The putting surfaces which were criticised by US Open champion Ernie
Els, reminded Ronald of playing in winter alliances back home. Walking
on them, he said, was similar to hearing his spikes crunch through
frost. The difference here is that the temperature has rarely dropped
below 90[DEG]F.
Another Scot to survive the halfway cut was Bill Longmuir (72), also
the father of a three-week-old baby. Whereas Ronald is striving to build
a career, the 41-year-old Anglo-Scot, who twice led Open championships
after one round, is battling to rebuild his having lost his playing
privileges two seasons ago.
The best of the nine Scots was Brian Marchbank. His 69 was one of the
rare scores below the unforgiving par of 70, and Andrew Coltart picked
up three shots over the last five holes for a 72 to make the cut right
on the mark.

WHILE dahlia enthusiasts of the grow-and-show brigade flex their
muscles for another season, I had a chat with Joe Gartshore.
The secretary and treasurer of the Scottish National Chrysanthemum and
Dahlia Society had some interesting facts to report.
Commercial nurseries specialising in dahlias -- such as Joe and Isa
Cruickshanks at Ridgeview Nursery in Longridge, West Lothian -- have
been busy taking cuttings and rooting them from over-wintered tubers for
some time.
However, enthusiasts are not always so quick off the mark.
While bedding dahlias can be easily and readily produced from seed,
and provide a tremendous show at low cost, the special varieties that
win prizes are produced from cherished stock.
They are meticulously maintained in tuber form over the winter months.
This is where a lot of non-specialists come to grief.
Over-wintering can be a complicated business. The trick is in keeping
them frost-free and avoiding too-high temperatures, which shrivel up the
tubers.
These are encouraged into growth by bedding in peat, on a soil-warmed
bed or propagating case.
Cuttings are snipped off, 3-4 ins long, and trimmed below a node with
any loose growth removed.
A few years ago, cuttings were rooted in Perlite-peat mixes. Now, says
Joe, a friable mixture of gritty sand and peat is the medium.
Cuttings root fairly readily with bottom warmth. This can be seen in
the way they freshen up.
The rooted cuttings are potted on to a general mix, peat or
soil-based. I haven't found any reference on how successful young plants
are in peatless compost.
I would think they do reasonably well if you keep them well watered.
The size of pot varies. The bigger the pot, the more space plants take
up, although square pots are popular now. Somewhere between 2.5-4in pots
is about right.
It is now a question of growing on slowly, giving enough room, and
looking after needs in terms of watering and possibly even feeding.
Plants are grown in a greenhouse and kept not much lower than 50F at
night. The object is to produce strong sturdy plants and not floppy
ones. This needs careful attention to ventilation and spacing.
Dahlias are not frost-tolerant, and planting out cannot take place
until late May or early June.
Beds are usually about 4-5 ft wide. Spacing is around 2-3 ft apart,
according to type and variety. Staking is essential from the outset. Use
stout canes. Pinch and disbud plants carefully, and according to type.
Show time starts around the end of August, with local events all over
the country. The season culminates in the major show on September 5-6 at
Stirling.
Also of interest are monthly shows at Glasgow Green

PROFESSIONALS often take refuge in the comfort that anything can
happen in golf, but even their credulity was stretched when Harry
Taylor, a 40-year-old ''no-hoper'' from the Old Hickory club in
Tennessee, finished the third round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic
with a two-stroke lead over Kenny Perry, of Kentucky.
Taylor, who has had to attend the qualifying school a record 14 times
and has won his card on seven occasions, scored a 66 at Bermuda Dunes to
lead at 20-under-par 196.
Since he joined the Tour in 1986, Taylor, who helps to design clubs
for a large company, has never finished better than fifth.
Tommy Armour III, grandson of the famed Silver Scot, finished with a
69 at Indian Wells for 202. Leading scores:
196 -- H Taylor 66, 64, 66.
198 -- K Perry 63, 71, 64.

WELSH rugby legend J P R Williams yesterday predicted that Robert
Jones could celebrate joining him in the half-century club by wrecking
England's Grand Slam hopes.
Williams believes that today's Five Nations clash at Cardiff Arms Park
will be the perfect stage for the scrum-half who will become only the
third Welshman to win 50 caps.
The British Lion will emulate his legendary predecessor in the No.9
shirt, Gareth Edwards, who won 53 caps, and record-holder Williams, who
played 55 times for his country.
''It is a remarkable achievement by Robert,'' said the former full
back of Jones, who was recalled for last month's match in Paris.
Williams believes skipper and wing Ieuan Evans -- steaming towards the
half-century mark by winning cap No.49 today -- could be the man who
sets the new standard.
''It is difficult to say who will break it, but it will probably be
Ieuan. If he is fit, then he is certain to be in any Welsh side, but
Robert might not play in all the group games in South Africa.''
Williams believes Wales must stop England's rampaging back-row trio if
they are to stand any chance of recording yet another Cardiff victory.
''England have been made odds-on favourites, but I think it is going
to be very tight,'' he said. ''With the conditions tomorrow you won't
see the ball being flung out wide early on. The key for Wales really is
to stop the English back row.''
Wales will have seven changes to the side beaten 15-8 at Twickenham
last year with Mike Rayer, Ricky Evans and Mike Hall all injured, Rupert
Moon, Mark Perego and Phil Davies dropped and Scott Quinnell now in
rugby league.
England's Rory Underwood, meanwhile, will be content to leave Cardiff
today still without a try to his name in six visits -- provided England
bank the third leg of their grand slam bid.
Underwood has scored 40 tries in his record 73 caps and shown crowds
in all the European venues his finishing skills. But the Cardiff
try-line has been no-go area for him since his first trip there in 1985.
Rory Underwood and the England camp are dismissing talk that the
so-called ''Blunderwoods'' -- defensive errors in 1989 and 1993 -- cost
England victory in Cardiff.
Underwood's view of the prevailing Welsh weather is looking justified.
Yesterday England trained in vicious sleet and that appears to be the
best they can hope for today.
This means that for the second away match running England will have to
put on hold their grandiose plans to spin the ball wide and attack the
opposition down the touchlines.

IT is probably too much of an exaggeration to describe Scotland's two
recent victories as a winning streak. But compared to the nine games
which had elapsed without a taste of the sweet elixir that comes with
success they represent a mighty fine dash in the right direction.
The win over Canada in particular provided a huge fillip to the
Scotland camp which, on occasion, had seemed to be on the brink of
despair.
Against Ireland a fortnight ago the good work continued, and it will
be the second-half performance from that match that the Scots must build
on today at Parc des Princes.
France on their own turf, though, provide a much stiffer challenge
than anything which this Scotland side has faced before.
The Tricolors are still smarting from their 31-10 defeat at Twickenham
and their reselection, en masse, for today's game -- albeit with a minor
injury doubt over Grenoble lock Olivier Brouzet -- means several of them
will be playing for their places. Scotland beware.
The French are masters of the broken-play situation. Benazzi,
Cabannes, and Benetton, the three musketeers in the French back row,
will be devilish keen to wreak havoc among the Scottish midfield and the
Scottish skirmishers, Morrison, Wainwright, and Peters, will have to be
on their mettle.
Yesterday, Eric Peters of Bath, but from good Dumbarton stock,
acknowledged the threat posed by the French back row. The Scotland No.8,
who has been a revelation on his two appearances thus far, observed:
''They're a good, solid unit. Cabannes gets around the pitch well and
the other two are good at the close-quarter stuff.''
Much has been made of the speed which France possess among the backs,
but Scotland are not exactly lacking in that department either.
On both wings -- and with Gregor Townsend at centre -- Scotland are
blessed with players of exceptional pace. Scotland cannot afford to play
a game of containment, and both Craig Joiner and Kenny Logan must be
given early sight of the ball. In rugby, as on the roads, speed kills.
During a break from training yesterday, Logan observed: ''We have got
a lot of pace right across the back line.'' He added with a mischievous
smile: ''Gavin doesn't help there, of course, but even he's faster now
than he has been. We will want to be making use of that asset.''
The role played by Logan's Bridgehaugh clubmate Ian Jardine, remains
crucial to the Scottish gameplan. If he can continue to breach the
gain-line in the manner he did in the two recent Murrayfield
internationals, then the stage will be set for the speed merchants
outside him to give the French a taste of their own medicine.
As always, the battle up front will be important. The Scots must
subdue the French in the set-piece, and Damian Cronin, the Scottish
pack's Francophile-Anglo will be expected to provide a lineout lead for
Stewart Campbell, his boiler-room partner, who experi ences the volcanic
atmosphere at Parc des Princes for the first time.
France will play a running game and, often, this induces their
opponents, even if it isn't their initial instinct, to follow suit.
Dougie Morgan's side will do themselves a disservice if they do not seek
to counter France's expected champagne rugby with some special vintage
back play of their own.
Hastings, winning his fifty-fourth cap and seeking to add to his 504
international points will, one trusts, be as dependable under the high
ball as ever he was. Conversely, one would like to see Craig Chalmers
off-load a series of early ''bombs'' on France's Jean-Luc Sadourny. A
few ''guddled'' catches have a marvellously corrosive effect on Gallic
temperament.
Chalmers's half-back and club partner Bryan Redpath is a doughty wee
grafter who has now amassed seven caps. He continues to develop as an
international scrum half and, hopefully, today he will endeavour to
expand his game with some sniping runs and sneaky kicks.
Today Philippe Sella plays what may be his last game at the Parc des
Princes. The Agen centre, who wins his 105th cap, is still undecided
whether he will hang up his boots after this summer's World Cup.
He said: ''I don't know yet, but this may be my final appearance in
front of the Parc des Princes crowd. I have many happy memories of
playing there and if this is to be the last time then I want it to be a
happy memory too.''
Townsend, who is to mark the veteran Frenchman, is undaunted by his
reputation.
''I'm not overawed in the slightest. I'm defending him and Sadourny if
he comes into the line so I'll have my hands full, but it doesn't
concern me. Before Sella can do anything the French have to establish a
platform and we're aiming to deny them that,'' he declared.
Scotland have not won away from home since the 18-10 victory over
Ireland in 1992. That is a pretty grim statistic. Moreover, and as
everyone now knows, Scotland have not won in Paris since 1969. That is a
pretty gruesome twosome.
But there are others which offer more cheer. Gavin Hastings -- with 84
-- is Scotland's leading all-time points scorer against France. He is
also the Scot who has scored most points against the Tricolors in a
single match -- 18 on his Scottish debut in 1986. The Hastings
household, and the whole of Scotland, is looking for more of the same.

DESPITE current high prices, the future is not bright for Scottish
potato farmers concentrating on food production rather than seed, Mr
Charles Russell, field vegetables convener for the national Farmers
Union of Scotland, told a conference in Fife.
''I have difficulty in looking ahead to a confident future for the
ware crop,'' said Mr Russell.
''Potato growing will become concentrated in those areas of natural
advantage. Northern France is in a strong position. It is closer to
London than Scotland and can produce consistent quality ware grade
potatoes. Many parts of Eastern Europe are in a similar position.''
For Scotland the future lay in high grade seed crops or in pre-packed
bags -- a highly specialised market -- he told his audience at an arable
crops conference organised in Letham by the Scottish Agricultural
College.
In general, he said, Scotland could not grow processing potatoes to
the standards achieved in the south. This tended to rule out sales to
the large processors producing lines such as frozen chips or crisps.
Scotland had far more natural advantages for crops such as vining peas
or brocolli, he suggested. Both of these crops required a long, cool
growing season to ensure success. The East of Scotland Growers
co-operative was, he pointed out, the largest brocolli producer in
Europe. It had developed an export market and was sole supplier to two
of the largest packers of frozen food in the United Kingdom.
For farming in general the future lay in a coming together of farmers
to promote the interests of the industry, he said. The current furore
over live animal exports and veal crates should dispel any doubts about
joining the various farm quality assurance schemes.

<HEADLINE>Malt barley market is brewing up well</HEADLINE>

INCREASING thirst in South America, Eastern Europe and the booming
Asian countries will comfortably absorb any increases in malting barley
production, it was forecast yesterday.
But standards will have to be raised to ensure that there is no
''toxic beer'' scare along the lines of the Perrier water issue a few
years ago, said Mr Manfred Meyer, purchasing director for Friedrich
Wessheimer Malzfabrik, one of Europe's biggest maltings concern.
Speaking at a Home-Grown Cereals Authority seminar in Doncaster, he
predicted the international trade demand for malting barley would more
than double to 8.7m tonnes by 2004.
At the same time, improved premiums would lead to increased
competition, particularly from Australia and from the developing large
units of Eastern Europe.
However, British producers and merchants retained two key advantages:
the production of high quality malting barley and access to cheap
seaborne transport.
''For the maltsters who can receive UK malting barley by vessel or
barge, it should be an interesting alternative to Denmark or France.
Maltsters in central Germany or France do not have the option of finding
a cheap way of receiving barley by trans-shipment to train or lorry. But
main malt producers are located directly on water, therefore the market
for UK malting barley is wide open.''
He forecast price premiums over feed of #30 per tonne on pre-season
contracts with growers selling the remaining part -- perhaps half -- of
their crop on the spot market when market prices were favourable. On the
Continent, contracts were being set up to a year ahead of the next crop.
British farmers were advised to look for similar ways of reducing market
risk.
''Quality is your main bonus. Low protein and good varieties enable
you to compete with other malting barley producing areas. You should try
to create a UK brewing barley market offering barley at all seasons.''
But standards were getting tighter and not just on traditional
yardsticks such as variety, germination, moisture content and
infestation. New analytical techniques made it possible to detect
micotoxins and aflotoxins in beers down to parts per trillion.
''It is only a question of time before these new analytical methods
will be used to create either new rules or what is more likely an affair
of 'toxic beer.' This would be very dangerous for the industry --
remember Perrier -- because the cost of advertising today is higher than
the cost of malt.''

IN LESS complicated times, when it would have been politically
acceptable to call him a Head Master, Terry Christie, Head Teacher of
Musselburgh Grammar Scool, harboured ambitions which would have meant
abandoning a highly successful academic career and embracing the
guaranteed insecurity that goes with the manager's office at a major
football club.
The man whose current team, Stenhousemuir, relish the prospect of
taking on the premier side from Aberdeen in the Tennents Scottish Cup
this afternoon, admits it would have been a huge gamble, but explains it
with the cliche which could be the managers' maxim . . . ''You only live
once.''
If his cv for such a promotion is concentrated on relatively minor
teams, the performance level deserves close examination and Christie has
long been highly regarded in the corridors where these things are
discussed.
Only this week Craig Brown, Scotland's leader, described Christie as
''the best manager in the country,'' which may be a mite excessive but
does demonstrate how much impact the former Dundee, Raith Rovers and
Stirling Albion player has made among the folk close to the touchline.
When he quit playing at senior level, Christie became player-manager
of junior side Newtongrange Star, then moved on to become assistant to
Willie McFarlane at the newest club in the league at the time,
Meadowbank Thistle. He became their manager in 1980 and, but for a few
months between jobs, he has been gainfully employed in the dressing
rooms ever since.
Alongside this demanding business, for which he has not been paid
princely sums, he has fashioned a scholarly path which has taken him all
the way to the gaffer's desk in his day job. Christie, therefore, is not
a great more than a fleeting visitor to the family home where his wife,
Susan, has become well used to this nodding acquaintanceship.
A typical week for the Head Teacher when he is not head teaching goes
something like this -- Monday night: PTA or School Board meeting.
Tuesday: training at Stenhousemuir. Wednesday: night at home (or may go
out to see a player). Thursday: training. Friday: plays football from
5pm to 6pm with his pals. Feet up, glass of wine at night.
Saturday: Usually referees schools game in the morning. Match in the
afternoon. Takes Susan out for a meal in the evening.
It is a schedule which he meets with apparent enthusiasm -- and
perhaps indicates exactly how much he would have given to the task had
he been able to achieve his ambition to manage a top club.
In fact, Christie once thought he had succeeded in winning his place
among the premier team leaders back in 1987. He was touted for the job
as Hibs manager and made it to the short leet. He was interviewed by the
chairman, Kenny Waugh, and ''I came out believing I was Hibs manager,
but two days later I picked up the morning paper to discover that Alex
Miller had got the job.''
He was never to come that close again, yet when his track record with
Meadowbank is examined, it really is quite mysterious that he didn't get
a chance at the higher grade. He steered this new club to the semi-final
of the League Cup, established them as a first division team, and very
nearly took them into the premier division.
He seemed to be part of the scenery at Meadowbank, where he spent 14
years, 12 as manager. But, as so many have discovered at football clubs
over the years, that is a dangerous assumption. Christie was a director
as well as manager, and he believes it was as a board member that his
place was a hurdle in the path of the ambitions of Bill Hunter.
''Mr Hunter had come on to the board, had ambitions to be chairman,
and I was the obstacle. The club was run by founder members and
eventually they voted me off the board. I then resigned.''
Before that the politicking became rather messy and at one stage he
had taken out an interim interdict to prevent the board interfering with
his duties as manager. ''They then called extraordinary general
meetings, elected a new board, and I resigned.'' He admits he was
fighting a lost cause, but adds: ''I wanted to tilt at windmills.''
The last player he transferred was his son, Max, who went to Dundee,
but is now back playing for his dad at Stenhousemuir. Max, 23, unlike
older brother Kevin (both children of Christie's first marriage), still
lives in the family home where seven-year-old Carol reigns.
The Meadowbank saga is all behind Christie, and when he recalls the
latter days, he finishes up by saying: ''I just felt there was a
terrible injustice about it all.'' He has no animosity towards his old
club now, other than wanting to beat them, especially as his friend
Mickey Lawson is the current manager.
Apart from the Hibs job, he has had a couple of other offers during
his time. Cowdenbeath, for instance, also showed considerable interest,
but when he thought he had been given that job, he discovered once again
in the press that someone else, Andy Harrow, had been chosen.
''When I was a young manager I thought that, having taken Meadowbank
into a secure position in the first division, I would be fending off
interested clubs.'' But when he was forced out of Meadowbank he finally
found out what it was like to be out of football employment. That lasted
only a couple of months, however, and in October, 1992, he took over
Stenhousemuir, who were second bottom of the second division. He is
never one to shirk a challenge.
He was a couple of weeks in to the job when he made what he says is
his best signing, Graeme Armstrong, on a free transfer from Meadowbank
(where else?). Armstrong is assistant manager as well as the man who has
played more league games than any other player in Scottish history.
''He and I really hit it off as a team and the graph at the club has
steadily gone up. We had to wheel and deal, bring in some older players,
and now we have some good youngsters, too.'' The result is that
Stenhousemuir, top of the second division table, have reached the
highest place in their history to date.
Their defeat of St Johnstone in the last round of the cup was the best
showing by any part-time team that Christie had seen. ''We were actually
out of the cup in the first game when Adrian Sprott scored direct from a
corner in the ninety-second minute. But the second game was as well as a
part-time side could play, I think.'' He is too long in the game to
predict a similar fate for Aberdeen, but does admit that the players are
as excited about it as any he can remember.
The club striker, Miller Mathieson, an Aberdonian, has sold 50 tickets
himself, and the tie is a sell-out, with 3800 guaranteed to be present.
''I think it shows the ambition of the chairman that he refused to
take the tie away somewhere else to make money. We won't make a fortune
out of it, but we are going to have a real day out for the people of
Stenhousemuir. I hope it will be one to remember.''
A new stand is to be built this summer as the club works to hoist
itself into the nineties. A victory over Aberdeen and a quarter-final
place would do no harm to the finances or the reputation, but Christie
suspects that they might have drawn Aberdeen at the wrong time.
However it turns out, he will take Susan out for a meal tonight, and
get behind that mountain of paper at Musselburgh Grammar on Monday.

ECCENTRICS
By David Weeks and Jamie James
Weidenfeld and Nicolson, #17.99.
A DECADE or so ago I was invited to appear on a television programme
about eccentrics, presumably because the producer considered Scottish
authors oddballs. As agreed, I turned up in a pub to wait for my
audience with the star of the show. The star never showed, though the
producer did, to explain he had found a more suitable case for
television treatment: a gardener who grew only weeds. The producer made
his excuse and left me to reflect on the implications of eccentricity.
Eccentrics are not as absurd as that television producer appeared to
think. They have minds that matter and also an authentic innocence at
odds with the opportunism of calculating operators. Eccentrics would
rather make innocent exhibitions of themselves than excuses.
Some of my best friends are eccentrics, observed as off-centre by
those who go round in conventional circles. Eccentrics are delightfully
different, making poems and pictures and songs and scenes beyond the ken
of the conventional. Eccentrics can change the tune. Conventional folk
just know the score.
Conventional folk often see the eccentric as odd man, or woman, out: a
nutter who threatens the norm. David Weeks and Jamie James approach the
eccentric as a creative character who makes the mind matter. Think of
the bright light in Einstein's brain as a perfect illumination of
eccentricity.
This eccentric study was conceived, appropriately enough, in
Edinburgh, where Weeks works as a clinical psychologist (James is a
journalist). Conceived as the first scientific study of eccentricity,
for Weeks eccentrically claims his research is ''scientifically
speaking, the first word on the subject'', it is not, scientifically
speaking, possible to be entirely objective about eccentricity, since so
much is a matter of opinion. And opinions matter.
Was, for example, Lord Monboddo -- who pompously patronised Burns in
Edinburgh -- really ''an eccentric scientist''? Weeks and James describe
him as such, but Bertrand Russell, who admittedly had his eccentric
moments, admired him as an advocate of evolution, a logical fellow who
calculated that man and ape must have had a common ancestry.
Was Elspeth Buchan, the Scottish salvationist, really ''certainly
eccentric''? Weeks and James describe her as such, but Burns, a genuine
eccentric, thought her a religious fool -- a normal cultural condition
in a nation of Holy Willies.
If creativity is the key to the eccentric character, was William
McGonagall really ''a true eccentric''? Weeks and James describe him as
such on the evidence of his verse, but Hugh MacDiarmid, who had
considerable insight into eccentricity, perceptively judged McGonagall
''not a poet at all''. McGonagall was not so much an eccentric as a
professional bore who knew the score.
Genuine eccentrics are never professional bores. The genuine eccentric
is less calculating than Monboddo, more visionary than Elspeth Buchan,
less banal than McGonagall. The genuine eccentric has a genuine
innocence and need not be an Einstein to enjoy that innocence.
John Slater, content to live in a cave in the Scottish Highlands,
though it floods with sea water at high tide, once walked barefoot in
his pyjamas from Land's End to John-o'-Groats and once volunteered to
spend six months in a cage in London Zoo to raise funds for the
conservation of the panda. Weeks and James are right to honour Slater as
an eccentric.
They are wrong, however, to recognise Percy Grainger as an eccentric.
Given the authors' contention that eccentrics are not neurotic, Grainger
is an egregiously odd choice for inclusion in this book. While
Grainger's music sounds innocent enough, his mind was a coldly
calculating machine operating his neurotic nature. He wrote to a
girlfriend about his intention to abuse any children he had: ''I have
always dreamed about having children and whipping them, and to have a
sensual life with my daughters.''
Contradictions abound in this book. The authors assert that
''eccentrics are happier than the rest of us'' yet name as eccentrics
the likes of Glenn Gould, a great musician made miserable by his
irrational dread of draughts; Ludwig Wittgenstein, a great mind
tormented by doubt; Dorothy Parker, a great wit who found nothing
amusing about her experience of self-destructive drinking.
The authors maintain the fiction that eccentricity is ''utterly
harmless'', despite the demonstrable fact that eccentrics have harmed
themselves. Dylan Thomas, an innocent at large in a naughty world,
accepted the flattery of fools -- with disastrous consequences. Other,
less celebrated, eccentrics have similarly suffered by being guilty of
innocence.
Ostensibly scientific, Eccentrics actually relies on subjective
speculation and anecdotal evidence. The authors tell many diverting
tales about great eccentrics, many of them great Scots such as Sir
Thomas Urqhuart who -- so they say -- literally died laughing on hearing
of the Restoration of Charles II. It would, however, be unwise to
believe everything you read in this entertainingly eccentric and
understandably argumentative book.

MORVERN CALLAR
By Alan Warner
Cape, #9.95
A 21-YEAR-OLD supermarket assistant discovers her lover on their
kitchen floor. ''He'd cut his throat with the knife. He'd near chopped
off his hand with the meat cleaver.'' Instead of calling the police she
goes to work as usual, stacking ''the Delicious in shiny piles'', and
eventually cuts up his putrefying corpse for disposal, burying the head
and other parts on a mountain.
These, as it were, are the bare bones of Alan Warner's debut as a
novelist in Morvern Callar. According to the back blurb of this Cape
Paperback Original the location is a ''remote Highland seaport'', but in
his use of place names Warner sites his story in an easily identified
Oban.
Warner has said that his novel ''is a reaction to a lot of urban-based
male work that's still around'', and when Duncan McLean's novel Blackden
was published last autumn he argued that ''there are a lot of good folk
writing accurate stuff about city life, but nobody writing it about the
country''. Both Warner and McLean (one of the persons to whom Morvern
Callar is dedicated) seem to be establishing a modern Scottish rural
school of fiction that will complement the Glasgow school of Kelman and
others.
Kelman is in his late forties. Warner was born in Argyll in 1964. Both
he and McLean demand through their fiction that the voice of the young
generation be heard. They have an additional manifesto: they are intent
on exploding the rural myth we derive from writers like Grassic Gibbon,
in which the countryside is seen to be superior to the city in quality
of life and environment, and even in language, with its own dialects.
There is now little distinction between urban and rural life in
Scotland. Oban has been transformed from the sedate seaside resort of
buses taking tourists to hotels on the esplanade that I remember in my
youth. Morvern Callar, like her contemporaries in Glasgow, has access to
an ample supply of drugs and sex, including group sex in a genteel
suburb. Her life is no different from that of so many 21-year-olds.
She alternates between the nylon-overall existence of the superstore,
unloading the trolleys of the affluent into the boots of cars, to
putting on a dress and doing up her face to go drinking in the town bars
with friends with bizarre nicknames. She has a glittering substance
under the skin of her leg, the result of a childhood accident, but was
told it would fade in time, like her prospects in life. Her Walkman,
with the music she listens to obsessively, is her way into paradise.
There are grotesque comic elements to the way she treats the corpse of
her lover (''He couldn't object, so I lit a Silk Cut'') before she cuts
him up and puts him into her backpack for disposal on the mountain where
some of Warner's most appealing writing takes place.
Morvern not only avails herself of her dead partner's cash card: she
finds a novel on disc on his computer, puts her name to it, and gets it
published. Her later meeting with the publisher on her hectic foreign
holiday is a take-off of the pretentious literary scene.
Like Kelman with blind Sammy in How Late It Was How Late, Warner has
had to find a convincing voice to catch Morvern's stream of
consciousness. In places it sounds contorted and contrived -- ''Her from
Corran Road with all sons drowned off the boats. She bubbled till she
lost an eye. I greeted in heaves and my nose was running.'' But what
Warner may be trying to catch here are the enduring cadences of Gaelic
in west coast English.
In its use of the imagery of the times, Morvern Callar reminds me of
the works of Kerouac and other Beat Generation writers. Irvine Welsh
reinforces this intention of chronicling the unique language of a
generation, many of them high on music and drugs, when he promotes
Morvern as ''a fearlessly cool and sassy party chick . . . ''
The renewal of language in fiction is often a painful process,
especially when it is accompanied by sexual explicitness. We miss direct
speech marks, and dislike bodily functions detailed. Writers like Warner
are showing us an up-and-coming generation that we may disapprove of
because of its coloured condoms, its weird music, and in-language, but
we have to pay attention because it is the future.

ONE of America's foremost furniture designers was in Scotland last
month to introduce his latest designs, available in Scotland from Tony
Walker Interiors. John Hutton is the principal designer with the
well-known US company Donghia. Founded in 1968 by Angelo Donghia, the
company specialises in fine furniture and textiles, created by its own
teams of craftspeople.
''My furniture designs are made first for comfort and then for
style,'' says John Hutton, who has been with the company for nearly 20
years.
''I get my inspiration from things I see on my travels. I have also
studied people -- the way they sit and so on, to make sure the chairs
and sofas are in the right proportions for the greatest comfort.''
All the furniture is hand-built using traditional methods. Donghia
designs have been available via interior designers and architects in the
US for some 30 years, and have been in Europe for about three years,
where sales are already rivalling those in the US. Donghia manufactures
in Germany, Indonesia, Italy and London and has over 480 outlets in
Europe. They have a trade showroom in London and now for the first time
their furniture will be available direct to the public at Tony Walker
Home Interiors in Edinburgh.
As well as furniture, John Hutton also designs ranges of complementary
textiles, using natural fibres. ''I design about three collections of
furniture and textiles a year in the US. I'm not trying to create a
look. I'm interested in good quality design -- so people can come and
buy just one item, be it a sofa or a table lamp -- which will fit in
with what they already have in their homes. They don't have to use
Donghia fabrics -- they can buy a sofa and have it covered with their
own material.
''I spend about four months of the year travelling and get a lot of
inspiration for my designs from my own experiences and from things I see
on my travels -- for example, the latest designs, not yet available in
Europe, were inspired by a trip to the Grand Canyon,'' says John. ''One
of the motifs on an earlier textile collection was inspired by a
painting I saw in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.
''We pay great attention to three criteria: furniture must be
comfortable, it is made to last and nothing in its manufacture should
damage the environment. We use a lot of beech and white oak, but any
wood that we use, for example from Indonesia, has to be sanctioned by
the Rain Forest Alliance of America, who check to ensure that the wood
comes from peroperly managed forests.''
Donghia also use outside designers to create ranges of furnishing
fabrics to complement their furniture collections. A recent collection
resulted from a collaboration between Sherri Donghia and Italian fashion
designer Romeo Gigli.
Says Iona Hughes of Tony Walker, ''I first saw this furniture in
Cologne and thought it was just fabulous. I am delighted we are able to
present it here in Scotland.
''As you might expect for such well-designed, hand-made furniture, the
prices reflect the fact that these classic designs are made to last and
will become the heirlooms of the future.'' The Caspar armchair is from
around #1600, the Spirit sofa around #5000.
Furniture and textiles from Donghia's ''Spirit'' collection are on
view at Tony Walker Home Interiors in Edinburgh. Items from other ranges
available to order.

AMERICAN TABLOID By James Ellroy
Century, #15.99.
JAMES Ellroy writes like this. Fast. Clipped sentences. Sometimes no
verbs. Just phrases with buzz words. Grammar? Forget it, grammar's for
wimps. This is literature as, yes, literature as American tabloid.
Sensational, sexy, ugly. All the news that's hip to print. Who's
screwing who, why are they doing it, and what exactly are they up to
under those dirty motel-room sheets -- graphic detail will suffice.
Ellroy goes back in time. His killing field is the Hollywood fantasy
factory of the Forties, Fifties, and (now) the early Sixties. Not your
stars, you understand, but your broken dreamers and your
hookers-cum-starlets. And, below them, your sleazy politicians and your
goodfellas, the made men. Repeat after me: there is nobody nice in this
guy's books.
History. Ellroy is a weird man. Ellroy is a wired man. Loud, brash,
expansive, hyper. He is an alcoholic who doesn't drink any more. His
truth is even stranger than his fiction. In 1958 -- when he was 10 -- a
man picked his divorced mother up in an LA bar. Next day her body was
discovered among bushes in a sleazy white-trash area of the city. She'd
been strangled. Her killer has never been identified. As a teenager,
Ellroy drifted into a life of drugs, drink, and petty crime. He was
arrested and convicted 12 times and served a total of eight months in
jail. After an illness in 1977 he gave up booze and got a job caddying
at the Bel Air Country Club, an experience that formed the background to
his first novel, Brown's Requiem, two years later.
It wasn't great and neither was the follow-up, Clandestine. Better
were the three violent, above average, pulp-trash copsters (about an LA
detective hero, Lloyd Hopkins) that followed. And somewhere along the
line there was a disturbing first-person portrait of a psycho killer. It
was awful.
Then he got better. He started working on his LA Quartet. First came
The Black Dahlia, a noir-as-night tribute to Chandler, Hammett, et al.
Next came LA Confidential, more of the same with major developments of
the characters. And then The Big Nowhere, same as it ever was but a
classic of the genre (s'cuse the cliche but that's the thing about
cliches; they're usually true). They were hard, tough, sensational
novels about Tinseltown's underbelly. A homage to catatonia.
Then? Well, then he went off the boil and stopped making sense with
the publication last year of White Jazz, the final book in the quartet.
Here was the writer in danger of actually believing his own publicity
material. It was heavy. It was clumsy. It was too hard to handle. It was
the big man's Waterloo.
Now he's back from the edge. Back with a book that is close to
brilliant. Ellroy is a biggggg name dropper. This wonderfully complex
story mixes Bob and Jack Kennedy, J Edgar Hoover, Fidel Castro, Jack
Ruby, Howard Hughes, Jimmy Hoffa, and The Mob in the conspiracy theory
to beat all conspiracy theories into a cocked hat.
At almost 600 pages, American Tabloid is about twice as long as any
novel he's written before. But never mind the width, feel the quality.
Ellroy oozes his own distinctive style through every paragraph in this
skilfully-plotted book. It is almost as if what went before was little
more than a rehearsal for this novel.
Central to the book's success are the three principal (and fictional)
characters -- Peter Bondurant, an amoral private eye who moonlights as
Howard Hughes's fixer and Jimmy Hoffa's hitman; Kemper Boyd, an FBI
undercover specialist who finds his loyalties split when Hoover asks him
to infiltrate the young Kennedy's anti-Teamsters campaign; and Ward
Littell, a weak-willed Federal agent on a grudge trip against organised
crime. The fourth star of the book is a newspaper, the LA scandal sheet
Hush Hush.
American Tabloid, which shoots like a bullet between LA, Chicago,
Washington, and Miami, insinuates these characters into the libidinous
JFK's bid for presidential power, to the Mob's apparent involvement in
the Bay of Pigs fiasco, and on to the Dallas deathday.
Ellroy plumbs the murkiest depths in this often brutal and wildly
cynical novel about political expediency, financial greed, sexual
promiscuity, and the craving for power in the most compelling,
intriguing, and goddamned juicy period of modern American history. Pulp
fiction is an art form in this man's hands. And there will be more.
Tabloid is the first instalment in what the author describes as his
Underworld USA trilogy. The next will tackle the years immediately after
the Kennedy assassination.

THE Victorians were ultra-keen on protecting their privacy, and so the
legend of the lace curtain was born.
Cluttered, curtained rooms were mandatory for the better-off in
ninenteenth century society.
With a greater degree of privacy than families had ever known before,
and a concern with public displays of rectitude and respectability,
houses built in this era had rooms for men and women.
These were clearly separate, and male and female servants' quarters
were at opposite ends of the house.
Victorian towns grew at an explosive pace, and to screen the domestic
interior from prying eyes, lace curtains were often hung over windows.
Often these were heavily embroidered and provided with elaborate
fringes.
Partly because of this historical background, many people associate
lace curtains with dreary suburban comformity and nosy neighbours
peering out at goings on in the avenue.
Net curtains offer the advantage of being able to see out without
passers by being able to see in. For these reasons, some people do
without, or prefer using blinds to control sun and offer privacy.
But lace curtains can be used imaginatively. Although there is plenty
of advice about how to make the best of your curtains, few people choose
to be adventurous when it comes to translucent net or lace curtains
which they often see in simple, practical terms.
Lace curtains are regarded as something purely for privacy and for
preventing furnishings from fading in bright sun. Lace, however, is one
of the easiest fabrics to work with, requiring no specialist sewing
skills.
Now a new booklet, Stylish New Looks for Lace, published by DuPont,
manufacturers of Dacron TQ (a new lightweight yarn giving lace curtains
extra versatility), shows fresh ways to make more of the lace at your
windows.
Dacron TQ is a new, soft fabric which not only hangs beautifully, but
is also crease-resistant and easy to care for.
Today's trend is away from lavish curtain treatments, as exemplified
by Austrian rucked swags and tails. Most people prefer a simple look
with clean lines.
Stylish New Looks for Lace offers a number of more elaborate
arrangements for displaying lace curtains, and shows how a feature can
be made of even the least interesting window.
For instance, tie-backs, often used for ordinary heavy curtains, give
an elegant swept-back look when used with lace curtains.
The booklet also offers ideas about different ways of gathering lace
curtains so that they hang in full folds. A good tip is to use twice as
much fabric (width-wise) to ensure sufficient gathering.

FEW folk forget to draw the curtains on these long, dark and often
cold nights. The benefits of keeping heat in and cold drafts out, are
self evident.But curtains also make significant decorative features. And
by choosing warm, rich fabrics, you can create a warm, cosy atmosphere
to banish those winter blues.
If you opt for making your own curtains there is a wide variety of
heavy curtain materials to choose from, including velvet and damask or
brocade, in a huge range of colours and designs. Damask costs from
around #10.99 a yard; velvet -- an obvious choice for a heavy, luxurious
look -- is making a comeback in a range of textured designs, as well as
in the more traditional plain colours. Try John Lewis for patterned
velvets from around #15 per metre; they also stock velvets by Harris,
with self-patterned stripes, checks and spots, at #31 per metre.
For an extremely rich, sumptuous look, Ramm, Son &amp; Crocker's antique
velvet, which sells for around #69 per metre, can be gaufraged -- the
craft of imprinting designs on velvet using a heated roller. There are
eight designs to choose from, and in addition to the cost of the fabric
is a #60 setting up charge, plus #5 per metre for the gaufraging
process.
Heavy brocades and damasks also give a warm, rich touch to a room.
Warner's ''Faux Tapestry'' collection was inspired by fabrics from the
16th century, when they knew all about using material for warmth! The
designs include embroidery and crewelwork, tapestries printed on
heavyweight cotton, which keep the look of the original tapestry but
reflect the current fashion for textured cloths. Price from around
#30.70 per metre.
If you don't want a particularly heavy curtain, but need some extra
warmth, there are several ways to achieve this. Choose interlining for
added insulation. It is thicker than ordinary lining, and is sewn
between the lining and the curtain, giving added warmth as well as a
pleasing look of luxury and opulence. Interlined curtains also help to
block out sound. John Lewis stock three types ''domette'', a fine weave
interlining which comes in 122cm and 136cm widths and costs #3.55 and
#3.95 a metre.
They also have a raised interlining which resembles interfacing, which
comes in 136cm width and costs #2.75 a metre. The heaviest type of
interlining is known as ''bump'', a very loosely-woven material which
resembles cotton wool. In 122cm or 136cm widths, #2.95 or #3.25 a metre.
Material World also stock 54'' wide bump, around #3.99 a yard.
Another option is thermal lining which retains heat in winter, but
remains cool in summer. Brentfords, in Union Street, and their other
stores -- John Wilson's in Sauchiehall Street and The Linen Store in
Shandwick Place, Edinburgh -- sell ready-made detachable thermal
linings, 46'' wide and 66'' wide, in 54'', 72'' and 90'' drops. Prices
from #12.99 to #34.99 per pair. The linings come with a special header
tape, which means that you only need one set of hooks to attach the
lining to the curtain and then to the rail.
As well as making the curtains hang better, thermal lining gives added
heaviness, stops the curtains from fading and blocks out the light -- an
added bonus for children's bedrooms during the summer months! Thermal
lining material is available from most fabric shops; John Lewis stock it
in 122cm and 136cm widths, at #3.95 and #4.45 a metre. Material World
stock 54'' wide thermal lining at #5.99 per yard.
Dry-cleaning is normally recommended for curtains with interlining or
thermal linings, but Brentfords stock ready made nylon velour curtains
with permanently bonded thermal linings, which are washable. The
curtains come in three sizes -- 46'' by 54'', (#19.99 a pair) 66'' by
72'' (#43.99) and 90'' by 90'' (#70.00), in a variety of plain colours.
They also have thermal lining material, from #5.99 a yard for 54'' wide.
If you are stuck for ideas on how to achieve a particular look or
effect, a visit to an interior designer could be the answer. A designer
can advise on fabrics and styles to suit your purpose within your
budget.
''We prefer it if people give us a budget to work to -- it makes life
much easier'', says Roy Foster of Design Mongers in Glasgow. ''Here in
Glasgow, people are favouring strong colours and a more formal look,
choosing curtains with swags and tails, while in Edinburgh the look is
more informal, with a preference for simple, draped curtains.
''We use fabrics from all over the world, so people can have whatever
they want; generally in terms of quality of material, people get what
they pay for, so you will pay more for a designer fabric. You can often
achieve a similar effect with a cheaper material; for example, we
sometimes use mattress ticking material, if that is the look people
want. It is a heavy-duty, linen fabric and relatively inexpensive
compared with the designer alternative.
''For a warm look, choose tapestries, brocades or damasks, which give
an elegant finish. Velvet comes in a range of qualities and prices: the
average is about #20 per metre, but you can pay around #170 for velvets
with a design cut into the fabric, which is the top end of the market.
For warmth, we would recommend using one heavy lining: putting in
interlining can add considerably to the cost of having curtains made, as
for the best effect is should be hand-sewn, which is time-consuming.''

She writes faster than publishers can publish, if not fast enough for
her fans. But is she selling social realism or insidious nostalgia?
Carol Clewlow examines the Catherine Cookson phenomenon
CATHERINE COOKSON once told an interviewer: ''They used to say I was a
writer who became a business . . . and then an industry . . . '' The
more you pile up the statistics, and they do tend to pile up before your
eyes, the more the mountain bears out the truth of the statement.
A permanent resident of both hard and paperback best-seller lists, she
has sold an astonishing 90 million books around the world. Every day, it
is estimated, another 5800 are sold. That's 241 books an hour for the
mathematically minded.
Only an ingenue goes looking for Catherine Cookson on the library
shelves. If you're lucky, you just might catch a return deposited on a
trolley. But that's what you'd be, lucky. Cookson has been the
undisputed queen of library borrowings in this country for some years.
Currently she has 16 titles in the list of the 100 most borrowed books
released by the Public Lending Right Office, heading an elite of authors
whose loans top a million a year.
By just how much she outstrips her nearest rival the PLRO, a discreet
organisation which collects the 2p due an author for each borrowing, is
not prepared to say. What it will allow is that she is ''way out in
front'' of other pretenders to the crown like Danielle Steele and Agatha
Christie.
On her home ground of Tyneside, the setting of her best-known novels,
local libraries start taking names of borrowers for a new book four
months before publication day. In North Tyneside alone, 40 copies of
Ruthless Need, due out in April, will be bought to satisfy reader
demand. It's worth noting that such a demand, echoed countrywide, is
sufficient in itself to catapult any new novel straight into the
hardback best-seller list without so much as the purchase of one book by
a fan.
Then there's the screen adaptation of her work. Tyne Tees Television,
which has more than a little reason to be grateful for the Cookson
industry on its doorstep, has so far filmed eight of her books. The
last, The Glass Virgin, shown in January earned golden viewing figures
of 13 million for each of its three episodes. Tomorrow ITV repeats its
Emmy award-winning adaptation of The Black Velvet Gown, and there is
every reason to expect that the forthcoming The Gambling Man, which
begins a week tomorrow, will match that total.
''Writing is not only my work, it is also my hobby,'' Cookson once
said, explaining, as well as anything, her massive output. She is now 84
and despite being almost blind and bedridden from the effects of
telangiectasia -- a bleeding disease believed to be inherited from her
unknown father -- she is still composing novels via the Dictaphone she
has used since she was no longer able to write by hand.
''I am rotten from the eyebrows downwards . . . '' she is quoted as
saying in a new (unauthorised) biography. ''But as long as my mind is
active, I'll carry on.''
What makes her career in many ways the more remarkable is that she did
not start writing until her early forties. Her first novel was published
in 1950 and her next two years later. Those two years are important.
It's the only break in her writing career. Since that time she has
published at least one book every year, in most years two, quite often
three, and occasionally four.
Altogether she has written 88 books, mainly novels, but also a handful
of children's books and personal memoirs, of which the most famous is
the best-selling autobiography Our Kate, chronicling her struggle to
come to terms with the illegitimacy which she feels has thrown a shadow
over her life, and which runs like a dark seam through her work.
Such a tally of work leaves authors like myself, struggling to their
word processors every day in the limp production of one book every two
or three years, quite literally breathless. And whatever one feels about
the work itself, and I have to admit I have severe reservations about
it, it is impossible as a writer not to envy and admire this wellspring
of creativity, this unstoppable pulse, like that of some ancient bard
with the history of the tribe in his head, forever condemned to tell
stories.
In 1983, as a radio reporter, I was sent to interview Catherine
Cookson in her home in Northumberland. The occasion was the publication
of her 60th novel, Hamilton, and I asked her the obvious reporter's
question, if she had any ideas for Number 61. She looked at me like the
ingenue I was, and informed me, somewhat briskly, that not only was 61
finished and in the hands of her publishers, but 62 was there and 63 as
well.
It's impossible to dispel the image of Catherine Cookson's novels
stacking up on her publisher's desk like planes over Kennedy Airport.
She writes books faster than the publishers can print them, a fact which
alone justifies advances like the #4m or so for 10 books, which was
reportedly laid out by Transworld in 1986.
Among the reasons behind her extraordinary success, the first and most
obvious one to note is the sheer volume of her output. And while it may
sound unnervingly tautologous to say that the reason a writer sells more
books is because he or she writes more books, that actually is the
reality. More important, it's the rule of thumb by which contemporary
publishing operates.
For what any publisher requires from a writer more than anything else
is a good reader base on which to build his or her sales, something
which, aside from celebrity authors of stage and screen who are a
separate case, a first novelist cannot provide. It's the reason why
first novels are so difficult and/or expensive to launch, and why
recession-hit publishing is so chary of taking them on.
The more novels a writer produces and the more regularly, the wider
and firmer will become that base. New readers become, if you like, the
cream on the sponge; faithful fans the ever-thickening layer of sponge.
With 88 novels behind her, Catherine Cookson has a reader base to
surpass a publisher's wildest dreams. She is like a one-woman publishing
house, truly the industry she so cheerfully acknowledges. In terms of
output, a fitting comparison for her is less with a single author than
with Mills &amp; Boon which brings out regularly a set of new titles each
month.
It's an analogy which can be taken further. For the essence of the
Mills &amp; Boon philosophy is that there should be no surprises for the
reader, that the books should precisely fit the formulae laid out by the
genre. As the manager of a branch of a well-known bookselling chain said
when I asked him just what it was about Catherine Cookson's work which
made her readers buy her books with such enviable regularity: ''They
know exactly what they're going to be like.''
It's a view backed by the author herself. ''I have never
experimented'' was her brief dictated response to her biographer,
Tyneside journalist Cliff Goodwin, in answer to the written submitted
question, ''Do you still experiment in your work?''
Rather like Mills &amp; Boon, then, Catherine Cookson has, in some sense,
created her own genre, and in this she's no different from a number of
best-selling authors -- John Grisham, for instance, with his particular
form of pared-down legal thriller, or Wilbur Smith with his tales of man
against man and beast in Africa.
Indeed, there's an argument for saying that creating our own genre is
something all writers strive towards one way or another. Don't we all
want to carve out our own niche with what we hope is our distinctive
voice, and our particular preoccupation with certain facets of human
experience?
However, the what you see is what you get formula is not in itself
enough to explain Catherine Cookson's extraordinary success. Other
best-selling authors, after all, have triumphed by a similar process for
a while. Most, Barbara Cartland aside, have eventually fallen by the
wayside. Meanwhile Catherine Cookson goes on, driving metaphorical as
well as literal coach and horses through the publishing vagaries of hype
and fashion. ''She just goes on selling year in, year out,'' as my
bookseller put it.
The reason for her own success which she gave to me when I interviewed
her lay in the nature of the stories, the situations with which she
dealt, their simplicity, and universality. ''Anybody can identify with
them wherever they are,'' she said, which is surely true and explains
why she sells in 17 languages. That readers can and do identify strongly
with her heroes and heroines and the dramas they enact, is demonstrated
by the thousands of letters which she receives, and answers personally,
every year.
''A lot of things have happened to her which, although I'm younger
than her, I can identify with,'' one of her fans said on a recent BBC2
Bookworm programme. ''She was excluded from a lot of things, and because
of circumstances at school sometimes I was excluded. I was in a class of
children who had doctors and teachers for parents. We were very
working-class people so we didn't have a lot of the things they had, and
because of that we were excluded, so I know how it feels.''
This strong identification by her readers has to be one of the keys to
her success. And, again, there is nothing particularly mysterious about
that. All writers who address in some manner or other the human
condition, seek to engender that feeling in some way among their
readers. Why else would they write? Why else would they be read? What is
so unsettling for me, though, about her work, what makes the waters that
much more murky, is the precise nature of what it is her readers are
identifying with, which would appear to be alienation and rejection.
Disadvantaged birth, particularly illegitimacy, which figures in a
noticeably high proportion of her novels, coupled with intractable class
division, is the mainstay of her work, the fulcrum on which it sits. The
destinies of her characters are acted out by a succession of blameless
innocents, stalwart matriarchs, hard-working heroes, and feckless
aristocrats, all marching to the same tune -- the author's firm
doom-laden directive that, come what may, the sins of the fathers will
be visited on the children.
''When I start to read her books . . . I'm not here . . . I'm not in
my room . . . in my house . . . I'm there . . . '' another reader said
on the Bookmark programme, an earned and worthy tribute to her creative
powers.
But what has been created? A world, no more than a world, a whole dark
cosmology of historical disadvantage, as real, in the same ambiguous and
disconcerting sense, as the street of her birth, now re-created in the
local museum and drawing thousands of her fans every year.
Catherine Cookson, according to Cliff Goodwin, has been compared to
Dickens. While it is true that the world of Dickens is also one of
disadvantaged birth and divisions of wealth and class, there is at least
one important and insurmountable difference between the two.
Dickens was writing novels not only of his own time, as indeed
Catherine Cookson can be said to be doing with her novels set in
turn-of-the-century Tyneside, but more importantly in his own time.
Academics may continue to argue about the degree to which he ultimately
wished to disturb the status quo. The fact remains, however, that the
power and passion of his advocacy on behalf of the poor and
disadvantaged on the streets of London, which still set alight his pages
a century and a half later, stem directly from the fact that he was
writing in pursuit of the urgent necessity for change.
Thus it is is a very different moral kettle of fish as far as art is
concerned from Thus it was. The two serve different purposes, different
masters, something which confronts us with every new perfectly dressed,
historically accurate but essentially empty twenties, or thirties, or
forties series on the television.
Catherine Cookson has been blessed with a fine memory for detail which
she uses to good effect in many of her novels. By virtue of the date and
the circumstances of her birth, she can look back to a time and a world
in some of its darker aspects not too far removed from that of Dickens.
But that time and that world have passed, and the problems in need of
urgent attention today are different ones.
Illegitimacy -- ''having no da' '' in Our Kate's now famous words --
has disappeared as a scourge, lost beneath the tide of changing social
mores which have altered the very shape of family; cohabitation instead
of marriage, the acceptability and availability of separation and
divorce.
And while politically and economically motivated onslaughts on
single-parent families need to be treated seriously and countered with
the contempt they deserve, still the fact remains that they are not
capable of turning back that tide. Neither, by the same token, do these
families benefit by being compared, for whatever purpose, to the
prospect of being sent penniless and pregnant to the workhouse.
Similarly, the old class divides will not serve us any more. New and
infinitely more subtle divisions between the haves and the have-nots are
the ones that face us now.
The fan on the Bookworm programme may identify with Catherine Cookson
because she too remembers a time when she too had no shoes. But the
truth is that children do not run barefoot on our streets any more.
Instead they demonstrate the inequalities present in our society by
stealing the trainers they cannot buy (but which the world tells them
are theirs by right) from shops or even from other children. These are
the unhappy narratives of today's disadvantaged.
According to her biographer, Catherine Cookson is now being read as
social history. But social history sits uncomfortably in the novel when
seen through a telescope poking through the years and clamped firmly to
the author's eye. For the novelist can be a weak and spineless creature,
also an immoral one. He or she can turn a blind eye to inconvenient
truths such as this one -- that social history can easily shade into
nostalgia seduced by the wicked wiles of narrative.
It's an insidious thing, nostalgia. It creeps up on you, especially in
a world which seems increasingly fragmented and out of control;
especially perhaps on the threshold of the millennium. Without the heart
to look forward, we begin to look back, yearning for the past, for the
pleasures we believe we divine at the end of the telescope, perhaps even
in some perverted way for its privations. ''Ah yes . . . '' we say in
our own defence, struggling to put names to our fears, ''but there was
that sense of community then.''
Once a friend in a bar was witness to a long monologue of the ''we
lived in a shoe-box . . . we worked 18 hours a day'' variety. At the end
of it there was a long sigh and a sad shaking of the head. ''Ah, happy
days,'' said the speaker.
It's exactly that ambiguity which for me lies at the heart of
Catherine Cookson's work. It follows then that, for me, it must also lie
at the heart of her success.
* The Gambling Man, starring Robson Green, Sylvestra Le Touzel, and
Bernard Hill, begins on February 26. To be a Lady, the biography of
Catherine Cookson, by Cliff Goodwin, is published by Century, price
#15.99.
* Carol Clewlow is the Tyneside-based author of four acclaimed novels
including the best-selling A Woman's Guide to Adultery, which has been
serialised on television. She is currently working on adapting her
latest book, One for the Money (Michael Joseph), for the stage and will
be bringing a production of it to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe later
this year.

YOU've decided to splash out and re-design a room in your house.
You may be newly married and looking at your first home together, or
just seeking a complete new look for a room.
The problem is the same: ensuring you don't make an expensive mistake.
Laura Ashley has just extended their Home Styling Interior Design
Service -- previously available in Scotland only in Edinburgh -- to
their Glasgow and Aberdeen branches.
You can acquire, for #50, the expertise of a home stylist, who will
come to your home to help you pull together ideas for co-ordinating a
complete decorative scheme.
It may be the entire house, or just one room, but there will be a
personalised plan that follows closely the stylist's interpretation of
your tastes and requirements.
If you eventually spend #500 or more, the fee is refundable.
Faced with some specific aim, such as incorporating new wallpapers and
curtains with existing furnishings, having a professional alongside is
reassuring.
Your own individual scheme for each room will provide the
measurements, what will be needed in wallcoverings and paints, detailed
quotations, and a unique scheme board.
This might include samples of fabrics, wallcoverings, and paint
colours, plus any extra finishing touches.
Having gained your approval, the stylist orders everything and
monitors progress through to delivery.
She can also help find local craftsmen if needed.
The #50 fee covers visits within a 30-mile radius of the branch, but
fees can also be quoted for home visits to places further afield.

THE men's world indoor bowls championship became just that in Preston
yesterday when women's world indoor champion Jan Woodley and outdoor
champion Margaret Johnston both lost in their opening round matches.
Woodley produced a battling performance last night against
Cumbernauld's Hugh Duff before losing in five sets. Woodley took the
opener 7-5 and the second 7-6, but Duff opened his account with a 7-0,
three-end whitewash, added the second 7-2, and then completed his great
escape with a 7-2 win in the decider.
Earlier, Ireland's Margaret Johnston also lost by 2-7, 5-7, 7-3, 6-7
to 1992 champion Ian Schuback.
Defending champion Andy Thomson is also through to the second round
after a straight sets win over Jersey's David Le Marquand. Thomson won
7-5, 7-2, 7-1.

HAVE you been talking a lot of rot lately? If you have, you might be
able to give your woodwork a new lease of life.
If window sills and door frames have turned spongy this winter, act
soon and you may be able to arrest the decay.
The repair will cost little and take just a short while. But if you
leave it much longer you could be facing a massive job and a huge cost.
There may be a constant war against rot, and it is important to know
your enemy.
Once DRY ROT has taken hold it needs major work by professionals to
halt its spread.
It is found indoors, and the fungus that causes it spreads by sending
out pale grey strands in all directions.
It can spread at an alarming rate, and the infected timber becomes
brittle and cracks easily.
Dry rot fungus can go through masonry, so check under floorboards in
neighbouring rooms to see if it is spreading.
Treatment can involve removing sources of dampness, cutting out and
burning infected timber, and chopping off plaster to follow the fungus's
strands.
Then the areas must be treated with chemicals before making good the
affected rooms.
WET ROT is more common, and is often easier for a DIY enthusiast to
treat.
It happens in timber that has been exposed to a lot of moisture --
perhaps where rain has penetrated the joints on a window or door frame.
The best thing is to make sure it never starts in the first place.
That means regular maintenance and thorough painting.
With modern paint ''systems'', if you do the job according to the
makers' instructions, you might be able to go as long as six years in
between painting, without threatening the wood.
If the rot is too far advanced, it should be possible to do a patch
repair that will last for years.
There are several rot repair products that work well. Typically, they
will involve cutting away the worst of the rotten timber.
The spongy fibres can then be treated with a hardener that provides a
good firm base for the special wood filler.

YOU don't have to gamble on the odd ray of sunshine to brighten up
these gloomy winter days.
Any room can be transformed dramatically by bringing some garden
plants indoors.
The dependable, glowing jasmine and strident yellow Hamamelis mollis
are good examples.
Winter-loving jasmine (Jasminum nudiflorum) is one of the most
valuable garden plants for flower arranging.
From November until April its bare twigs throw out cascades of tiny
bright yellow, tubular flowers, either singly or in thick clusters.
Most people pick short twigs of its cheerful blooms to put in a small
pot with early primroses or polyanthus.
In fact, it's far better for the shrub to cut extra long branches of
the jasmine and combine them with bigger flowers in an arrangement.
For, once it has flowered, jasmine should be pruned anyway, by cutting
back all flowering shoots to within 2-3 inches of the base. Old and
woody growth on the shrub should be cut away completely.
In the summer, Jasminum nudiflorum produces its arching sprays of
small, trifoliate dark green leaves, which are ideal for giving a
graceful, curving outline in a pedestal flower display.
But for a cheering winter arrangement, combine its cheerful yellow
flowers with the creamy-edged leaves of Griselinia littoralis
''Variegata''.
This is wonderful all-year-round shrub. It is evergreen, and the
lightness of its variegated leaves brightens up the shrub border.
It positively shimmers planted in contrast to a dark green shiny leaf
such as that of the common holly.
To arrange, you will need:
Half a block of soaked oasis foam on a shallow dish; a bunch of single
yellow chrysanthemums; Jasminum nudiflorum; single leaves of Bergenia
cordifolia; Griselinia littoralis ''Variegata''; trails of small leafed
ivy.
Using sprays of griselinia, form a loosely triangular outline, also
bringing some foliage to the front to avoid a flat one-dimensional look.
Add long sprays of the winter flowering jasmine following this
outline.
It helps to imagine a central point in the centre of the bloak of
oasis and to insert the twigs so that the stems ends all radiate from
this point. Insert three or four large single bergenia leaves towards
the centre.
Remove all the leaves from the chysanths (these die before the flowers
and grow mould which curtails the life of the flowers). Shorten the
stalks, cut off some to use singly.
Insert the flowers, the same way as the jasmine, recessing the shorter
blooms so that the heads are not all on the same plane. Finally, add
short trails of small leafed ivy to the front and sides.
Hamamelis mollis (Chinese witch hazel) is another antidote to winter
gloom with its untidy clusters of spidery, lemon yellow flowers (said to
resemble witches' fingers) produced on bare stems, from mid-December to
March.
They last well indoors and are combined with snowdrops and Corylus
avellana ''Cortorta'' (the Corkscrew hazel, or Harry Lauder's walking
stick).
To make a similar display, use a small round of oasis on an oval or
kidney-shaped flat plate.
Make an outline with a contorted branch of Corylus to the back and a
shorter branch curling towards the front and to the right.
Add three or four twigs of Hamamelis following this outline. Place
small groups of snowdrops with a few of their leaves in tiny pots of
water (the plastic container in which a roll of film is packaged  is
ideal).
Conceal the pots, oasis, and base of the dish with damp moss. As
before, add trails of dark green ivy to emphasise the whiteness and
fragility of the snowdrops to break the hard outline of the rim of the
dish.

JOHN Higgins clinched his third semi-final appearance in three weeks
with a 5-2 victory that ended the Sweater Shop Open hopes of another
Scot, Euan Henderson, in Bournemouth yesterday.
Higgins, the title favourite, now meets John Parrott, and the man from
Lanarkshire had a word of warning for the defending champion.
The pair's only previous clash was in the 1993 Grand Prix in Reading,
a match Parrott won easily.
''I was inexperienced and did not really go into that match believing
I could win,'' said Higgins. ''This time will be different.''
World No.119 Henderson never really threatened to follow up earlier
victories over James Wattana and former world champions Dennis Taylor
and Terry Griffiths.
The former engineering student from Glenrothes described the first
four frames, when Higgins totalled 357 points to his 71, as ''the most
embarrassing of my career.
Earlier, Parrott's 5-2 win against McManus brought sweet revenge for
the 30-year-old Merseysider, who slumped by the same scoreline against
the Scot in last month's Charity Challenge in Birmingham.
Steve Davis had little difficulty in his match with Mick Price, the
former world champion winning 5-0.
Davis now meets Jimmy White, who also achieved a whitewash last night
against giant-killer Mark Johnston-Allen.

IN common with golf's seniors tours, competition for skiing's golden
oldies is booming in the USA and Europe.
Britain, to date, has only a small band of veteran racers, who
frequent the annual British Masters in Switzerland, while fewer still
compete at World Masters championships level.
But times change. So well subscribed is next weekend's first ever
Scottish Masters championships -- a slalom and giant slalom to be held
in Glenshee -- that there is already the possibility of an International
Masters race.
In Masters racing life begins at 30, and seems to go on until the Good
Lord decrees otherwise. For those in the 30-35 age group it is simply
the next challenge in a long running racing career, while for the
40-plus racers it is a chance to trade on the polished skills of
yesteryear, tarnished only by too many corporate lunches and not enough
skiing.
However, when corporate deals give way to the free bus pass the Brits
really reach peak form.
Of Britain's little known duo of skiing world champions James Woolgar,
reigning Masters champion in the over-70 division, has at 78 a full half
century on Edinburgh's Vaila Macdonald, the World Women's Extreme Skiing
champion.
Woolgar, from Surrey, who was Field Marshall Montgomery's right-hand
officer at Alamein, will not be racing in Glenshee next weekend. He
spends his winters travelling Europe in his camper van, racing on the
international circuit -- and spends his summers windsurfing.
Instead, the oldest competitor will be Glenshee's own 81-year-old,
David Jamieson. In the women's event, Mary Allison is ''over 70 and
under 72.''

FARMERS who send dirty cattle to abattoirs for slaughter are in danger
of having them rejected, the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers
warned yesterday. Association president, John Scott of Paisley, said the
number of dirty cattle arriving at abattoirs had been increasing.
''We have had reports from a number of members throughout Scotland of
cattle arriving with unacceptable levels of muck on the hips and
belly,'' he said. ''This is a potential health risk. We appreciate that
straw is expensive and in short supply this year, but it is the
responsibility of farmers to ensure that cattle are delivered to
abattoirs in a clean state.''

HERE'S your starter for 10 for the weekend. One of your best managers
comes to you and asks if she can take a year's career break. She wants
to help the family move house, settle the children at a new school and
generally focus inwards for a spell.
What do you do? Do you fire her (difficult under current legislation)?
Do you agree grudgingly but mentally dismiss her from your long-term
plans? Or do you grant the request positively, saying her job or
something similar will be awaiting her return and you'll help organise
cover for the period of her absence?
Score an emphatic zero if you chose the first option, one point if you
went for option two, and a dazzling 10 points if you opted for No. 3.
These days -- particularly these days -- companies that put their
people first in such sympathetic, practical ways are fast gaining that
most desired of reputations: they are considered a great place to work.
There are reasons for this trend.
Stress and pressure on employees have increased radically this past
decade. No matter the size of your company, your people are now working
longer and harder than ever before. You probably want it this way and
have so structured the business that there's a price being paid daily by
individual employees.
This is particularly so among married people, of either sex. Survey
after survey shows starkly that work-related stress is a major
contributor towards marriage breakdown. We all know the sheer
impossibility of maintaining a satisfactory balance between the demands
of home life and business. There are not enough hours in the day, the
week or the year to do justice to either.
Working mothers generally top the stress league, for obvious reasons,
and in a variety of ways ranging from suppression of career to continual
exhaustion. Fathers suffer too, of course, perhaps to the greater extent
from the unsatisfactory work-family relationship than most employers are
able or prepared to recognise.
There is now a very clear and fundamental conflict between the demands
of work in this competitive age and the natural human needs of the
family. Most employees and, I would have thought, at least 90% of
managers, suffer directly.
The only people I know to have satisfactorily resolved this conflict
have done so by taking radical steps, usually by resigning well-paid
jobs to set up businesses based at home.
If you want to hang on to good employees, it is vital to take a more
realistic view of your people's family commitments than that of your
competitors. I suspect that may not be too difficult: there are still a
remarkable number of Neanderthal managements around in Scotland that
believe the working week is too short and people have far too many
holidays.
Family-friendly personnel policies are rapdily developing in this
country as more companies come to realise their advantages in both
effectiveness and competitiveness. Indeed, in some industry sectors such
as electronics this trend is being led by the multi-nationals whose
enlightened approach is born of hard experience.
The keyword to describe such policies is ''flexibility''. It means the
ability to allow working mothers and fathers alike to structure their
jobs in a way that makes sense for them, and in turn gives them the
opportunity and the incentive to deliver for the company. It means
introducing practices such as job-sharing, term-time working,
home-working and career breaks.
Sure, it is more hassle to manage. But it should not mean more cost if
the policy is efficiently implemented. Pay, for example, can still be
based on performance, but there is more incentive all round for that
performance to be achieved in shorter working time.
These days you can either view your employees as a cost or an
opportunity. You can batter them into the ground or you can support,
encourage and develop them. Whichever option you choose will, in turn,
decide your ability to attract and retain good people.
Such people -- and let's face it, they are hardly in abundant supply
-- are already voting with their feet towards enlightened employers. I
suspect that after another couple of years of the current working
environment, it will be practically impossible for the Neanderthals to
attract anyone half-decent.
Ultimately, it is the quality of people that will determine whether
businesses succeed long term, no matter the nature of their markets or
their products.

THERE is a quiet battle going on in Scotland's football world, totally
unrelated to the scenes witnessed at Dublin's Lansdowne Park. The
contest is over who is going to heat your half-time cup of tea. Is it
going to be British Gas or CaledonianGas?
CaledonianGas has just swooped into the transfer market and scooped up
Stenhousemuir.
The second division pace-setters have signed a one-year contract with
CaledonianGas to supply fuel to Ochilview Park.
It appears the signing on fee was the promise of a 10% reduction in
their fuel bill which, said Stenhousemuir club secretary David Reid, was
normally around #1500 a year.
The #150 saving represents about 5% of an average home gate according
to Mr Reid.
Before people start to mutter ''small beer'', it should be pointed out
that Rangers, Celtic and Liverpool have all signed up with
CaledonianGas.
I wonder if it will improve the taste of the average cuppa?
Flat sale not
on the cards
IT is not every day that someone shows an interest in buying a
penthouse suite at #278,000, so Colin Cumberland, managing director of
Applecross, the Edinburgh-based building firm, was delighted when he
heard there was a serious enquiry about its penthouse flat in St
Margaret's Place in the Marchmont area of the capital.
However, the sale fell through when the prospective buyer enquired if
it was acceptable to pay the balance of #275,000 by credit card! Mr
Cumberland had to politely turn down the offer.
''It was a serious enquiry, and it was a gold card,'' he expained,
''but after the customer had paid their deposit of #3000 we would have
had to pay between 2.5% and 5% commission on the balance to the credit
card company. I think we will stick to cash, otherwise we may as well
pay estate agents to sell our flats.''
Hot properties
captured on film
TALKING of estate agents, Ian Robb of the Robb Agency has completed a
video aimed at attracting customers with the help of Ian Hogg, who is
involved with Picardy Television.
Mr Hogg gave up his links with estate agencies several years ago but
Mr Robb is delighted with his end product.
''I'm sure that Ian's knowledge of the industry helped to ensure the
video came out well. We were quite far down the road with another
company when we saw the work that Picardy produced and decided to ask
them to produce ours,'' he said.
The estate agency has produced 1000 copies of the eight-minute video,
but Ian Robb assured me that it was not available on the top shelf of
any video rental shops.
Slater Hogg and Howison, we are told, is at present in the process of
organising a video too, but no, Picardy Television is not the maker.
Switching on
to Phoneday
THREE years ago BT announced that April 16 was to be Phoneday, when we
would all have the figure one inserted after the initial 0 in our
national codes.
There are now only seven weeks to go and 40% of Scotland's businesses
have yet to carry out the work required for a smooth transition.
A BT spokeswoman admitted to Business Diary that it was concerned
about the number of companies which had not carried out the work. She
said: ''Some companies appear to think that it is a long way off.''
At present you can dial either option, for example 041 or 0141 for
Glasgow or 031 or 0131 for Edinburgh, but after April 16 only the longer
one will be accepted.
The changes mean companies have to reprogramme all equipment which
stores numbers including telephones, faxes, switchboards, databases and
security alarms.
To remind companies about the approaching date, BT is launching a TV
advertising campaign. If you want information on Phoneday you can call
BT's free helpline on 0800 010101.
Take High Road
to have a ball
FANS of Scottish Television's High Road, or indeed anyone who wants to
moan about the weather to the station's Lloyd Quinan, might like to go
along to the Scottish Bobath Association's first ever corporate ball in
the Glasgow Hilton on March 25.
The charity has some well kent faces attending, including Ann Myatt
and Sandy Morton from High Road and Barbara Rafferty who plays Jamesie's
wife Ella Cotter in Rab C Nesbit.
The Scottish Bobath Association is in the process of establishing a
centre for the treatment of children with cerebral palsy, aimed at
increasing the ability of all children to move and function in as normal
a way as possible.
A building in Knightswood in Glasgow is at present being rented, and
the charity needs to raise further funds to buy it and cover operating
costs.
A table for 10 is #400 and tickets can be obtained from Laura Marney
on 0141 226 3260.
City gets aims

THERE was an interesting exchange at the Edinburgh Financial
Discussion Group meeting earlier this week in the capital's Playfair
Library, when reference was made to the alphabet soup of City acronyms.
Stock Exchange chairman John Kemp Welch was guest speaker at the
gathering of 60 influential financers from both Edinburgh and Glasgow,
where it was pointed out that yet another acronym was making its debut
the following day when AIM was being launched.
London Stock Exchange director Miles Vardey remarked on the fact that
people were already referring to the AIM Market, forgetting the M
actually stood for Market.
One wag suggested the M could be dropped and AI introduced instead,
standing for Artificial Insemination device to boost the business
birthrate. Mr Vardey quickly interjected: ''Perhaps we'd better stick to
AIM, and forget what the letters originally stood for.''
For the uninitiated, AIM means Alternative Investment Market and is
designed to encourage smaller companies to float their shares.
Chinese group
is expanding
THE Scotland China Association has relaunched its Sine publication.
Sine is the Gaelic for China and is distributed free to members.
Janice Dickson, the association's national chairman, points out that
although it has been in existence for 20 years, the growing trade
between Scotland and China has meant more companies and other bodies are
now joining.
In the last year 10 corporate members have joined the 200 plus
individual members spread throughout Scotland.
Any firm interested in joining can contact Dale Finlayson on 0131 667
9369.
Fancy a piece of the action?
MORE than 60 jigsaw pieces were sent out this week by the Greater
Glasgow Tourist Board &amp; Convention Bureau to key associations involved
in architecture and design.
The recipients were invited to bring their piece along with them to
next week's Confex 95 in Earls Court in London to fit a giant piece into
a jigsaw to discover ''the bigger picture'' of Glasgow.
To induce them to participate, the key decision makers were promised
the ''opportunity to win an exclusive Glasgow prize''.
Business Diary can reveal that the first reward the participants will
receive will be a MUG.
However, we are assured that they will not get ''just any old mug''
but a fine bone china one complete with Charles Randak's popular Glasgow
image on the side -- the same one that the finished jigsaw will show.
I have a worrying vision of representatives from Greater Glasgow
Tourist Board frantically searching, as Confex 95 nears its end, for the
holder of the final piece of the jigsaw.
No doubt though such a disaster will not occur, and Glasgow will
continue its great success run of 1994, which saw it secure a record 222
new conferences worth more than #23m to the local economy.
Conference business is now worth in excess of #33m annually to Greater
Glasgow.

The fate of two Christians hangs in the balance in Pakistan. Steve
Bruce analyses the political and religious questions
UNLESS Pakistan's president Benazir Bhutto can summon the political
nerve to confront her mullahs, two Christians, one who was only 11 when
the offence was committed, will be executed for the blasphemy of
defacing a mosque with graffiti. While we agonise about the fate of veal
calves, the country which was one of the jewels in Queen Victoria's
imperial crown will kill two human beings for being rude about Allah.
In part this is a politics story. The generals who have run Pakistan
on and off since 1958 have played the religion card to hold together a
state which is deeply divided by language, ethnicity, and regional
interests. By promoting the Islam which unites most Pakistanis and
divides them from their India neighbours, the generals hoped to retard
the fragmentation that saw East Pakistan break away in 1971 as
Bangladesh.
But it is also a story about the authority of religion. Islam, the
majority religion of Pakistan, like the Christianity of old, is
monotheistic and exclusive. The first of the five pillars of Islam is
the profession that ''there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his
prophet''.
Unsaid but implied is: ''and anyone who says different is in
trouble''. Orthodox Muslims take the profession to be a factual
statement and not a relative ''truth'' that applies only to those who
accept it. Those who disagree are plain wrong and it would be a
disservice to the whole world, and not just to the Muslim faithful, if
they were allowed to act out their heresies.
The Christian West used to think like that. There was one God and the
one true Catholic Church did his will and it was the job of kings and
princes of the Middle Ages to support and promote that one true Church.
When, at the start of the sixteenth century, the Reformation split the
one true Church into more-than-one-and-all-still-claiming-to-be-true
Churches, the idea of church and state in cahoots was seriously damaged.
But this did not stop church leaders trying to enrol the secular power
to promote their cause.
Until the last century there were all sorts of penalty imposed on
people who refused to confirm to the state church. One infamous English
law allowed the courts to remove the children of dissenters so that they
could be raised in the right religion. And there were Puritans who
despised such weakness.
Thomas Cartwright proposed that the godless be made to attend ''the
proper place to hear sermon'' and be quizzed afterwards. Those who
persistently refused to pay attention and profit from the preaching were
to be executed.
Fortunately for the ungodly (and the hard of hearing and the stupid),
Britain was generally pretty slack about enforcing its religious laws.
In the 1650s the Quaker pioneer George Fox was regularly imprisoned, but
a century later the Methodists could pretty well do as they pleased. The
Scottish Covenanters were chased around the hills by soldiers but the
Seceders a century later were more likely to be met with scorn than with
bayonets.
The leaders of the state churches long continued to want the
government to enforce their religion but the political leaders were more
keen on keeping the peace than keeping the faith. More and more people
chose to follow different versions of the Protestant faith, then
different versions of Christianity, then different faiths, and finally
no faith at all. We made religion into a private matter, a personal
preference, a little something for the weekend.
As the constitution of the United States put it, the state had no
right either to promote any particular religion or to hinder people in
the free exercise of their religion.
We still have some survivals of the church and state era. Being an
adulterer may make Prince Charles unpopular but it will not prevent him
claiming the throne. Becoming a papist will. We allow adults to refuse
blood transfusions on religious grounds but parents may not deny such
treatments to their under-age children. And we still have laws against
blasphemy.
In the early 1970s the editor of Gay News was convicted for publishing
a poem which depicted Christ as a homosexual. But such supports for a
particular religion are insignificant when set against the laws which
prevent us from discriminating against people on religious grounds in
our public roles. I may choose my friends for their church affiliation
(or lack of it) but I cannot select my students that way.
The private/public distinction has given western European societies a
way of dealing with religious differences but at the heart of that
successful accommodation is this unstated principle; it works only so
long as no-one takes their religion too seriously. The problem for the
West is knowing what to do about religious cultures which stick to the
old notion that there is one God and all of us must do what he (or his
representatives on earth) tell us.
From inside a traditional monotheistic culture, Iran's fatwa on Salman
Rushdie or Pakistan's fatwa on Taslima Nasrin are perfectly reasonable.
Our God is a jealous God. Those who insult their maker (or his
representatives on earth) do not deserve the gift of life.
To our culture such conviction, such certainty that one knows what is
pleasing to God or even that one knows there is a God, is dreadful. But
we have no corresponding conviction, no equally solid rock on which we
can stand to denounce such inhumanity.
Although we take for granted the social harmony that results from
outlawing religious discrimination, we do not celebrate our cultural
liberalism as one of the great achievements of the modern world, to be
set alongside literacy, industry, and democracy.
Instead we allow ourselves to be hamstrung by tolerance. We do not
seem to realise that toleration cannot be extended to those who reject
its principles. We can no more declare a Christian war on Islam than we
can return the St John's Ambulance Corps to its original role as an
elite force of the Crusades.
But, if we believe that our culture is preferable to one which
executes people for being rude about religion, we need to become
standard bearers for liberal democracy and not just its passive
beneficiaries.

LAST month, before he was bundled out of the manager's chair at
Pittodrie, after one more dismal performance by his players, Aberdeen's
Willie Miller vented his frustration on a stadium door. The door lost.
No problem, said chairman Ian Donald, if a door needs fixing we have a
joiner on the board who can do it.
Donald was talking about fellow director Stewart Milne. As it happens,
44-year-old Milne is not a joiner. He started life as a time-served
electrician. Today he is chairman, managing director and majority owner
(to the tune of 84% of the action) of a group which bears his name. It
will turn over #100m this year, made #5m profit pre-tax last year, has
capital and reserves of #21m, and employs some 700 people.
The Stewart Milne Group claims to be Scotland's fourth largest house
builder, completing around 800 units a year, and is also one of the two
biggest suppliers of timber-frame housing systems in the country.
Although the group is also active in commercial and industrial
construction and in development, Milne's ambition to grow the
20-year-old business even bigger over the next five years rests
principally on these two strengths.
Having approached near saturation in the group's share of the house
building market in Grampian, Milne wants to build a lot more in
Scotland's central belt. He also has his eyes fixed firmly on the
opportunities to supply timber-frame kits to the English market, where
that particular house building technology is much less developed than it
is here in Scotland.
While more than half the new houses now being built in Scotland are of
timber-frame construction, the corresponding figure south of the Border
remains around 5%. Those of you with long memories, who can cast your
minds back to the World in Action programme on house builder Barratt,
may be surprised to discover that the initial blow that episode
delivered to timber-frame housing is still being felt today.
Milne is convinced that picture will change. He points to pending
regulations on the heat efficiency of houses which, he argues, can only
sensibly be met through the use of timber-frame technology. If you
continue to build double-skin structures of brick and block, he said,
you will just end up building the equivalent of timber framing inside
them to meet the necessary co-efficients.
''The real potential lies in England,'' he explained. ''After all it's
12 times the size of the Scottish house market.'' The group's
manufacturing centre for timber frame kits, at the Westhill Industrial
Estate in Aberdeen, currently has capacity for 2000 a year, on single
shift working. The Milne group is producing around 1500 at the moment,
so there is significant spare capacity, if the foray into England works.
Milne has three main strands to his strategy. First, the group will
target national developers, who are beginning to extend their use of
timber-frame construction. Second, the Stewart Milne Group is already
beginning to develop joint ventures with contractors working in the
housing association sector, groups such as Higgs &amp; Hill. And, third, he
is targeting specific types of development which lend themselves to the
timber-frame system, growth areas including student accommodation and
the burgeoning travel inn sector.
One early fruit of the approach is a contract to deliver 300 timber
frames in 35 weeks. In the short term, he pointed out, the strategy
carries no great capital risk. If it really bears heavy fruit in the
longer term, he may consider investing in a second greenfield production
facility further south.
Stewart Milne has no illusions about the challenges involved in
diversifying away from a local market you know like the back of your
hand. He candidly admitted that the move into the central belt, which
began three years ago, had a rocky start.
''We didn't pick the best time to do it. The market was quite
difficult; we didn't commit enough of our own time from Aberdeen, and
perhaps the calibre of some of the people we took on wasn't quite right.
But we've learned a lot since,'' he conceded.
Now there is a strong team in place, based in Edinburgh. Stewart Milne
Homes is active on five sites in the central belt at the moment, and
expects to get that up to eight or nine by the end of the year. ''Within
three or four years I would like to see a similar level of activity to
what we currently have in the north,'' he said.
All this expansionist ambition is a very long way from the Stewart
Milne Group's origins. But, while the scale of the ambition may be
vastly greater, the basic instincts which drive the man at the helm have
not altered.
Milne was born in the village of Tough in Aberdeenshire, second
youngest of five sons of a father who was 53 when he first married. ''I
got from my father the great belief that you can really make things
happen if you put in the graft,'' he said.
His father had come from a farming background and, when the
grandparents died, the farm was sold so each child could take his or her
share. ''My father was self-employed, doing drainage work and that kind
of thing around the local farms.''
For young Stewart Milne, school involved ''going through the motions''
until he could get out into the world of work. His real interest was
sport -- athletics and football.
Having served his time as an electrician with an Aberdeen firm, he set
up in business with a friend, a plumber, taking on small jobs. ''After a
year we came to the conclusion that, if we wanted to stay friends, we
should go our separate ways.''
Back on his own, he spotted a significant market opportunity. In the
early seventies, lots of Aberdeen tenements were being refurbished to
incorporate new kitchens and bathrooms. ''I looked at how other people
were tackling the work. Typically, they would move into a street and end
up taking three or four months to complete any one conversion. We geared
ourselves up to do two a week.''
Milne gathered a small team with the necessary skills around him. They
would move into a flat on the Monday morning, complete its conversion by
the Wednesday evening, and move into a second flat on the Thursday. By
Saturday evening, that job too was complete. All that was left to do was
the redecoration.
The work was mainly for private individuals, although he was also
employed by local landlords. The business grew largely through word of
mouth. Milne started taking the architectural drawings, planning
applications and the like in-house. ''We did that kind of work for three
years. The way we tackled it shaped a lot of my later thinking.''
When he started to consider building complete new houses, he was again
determined to eschew the traditional and do things his way. That's what
got him hooked on the timber-frame approach. He built a number of houses
for another Aberdeenshire entrepreneur, George Simpson, using timber
kits from one of the early innovators, Avonside.
By 1977, after visits to Weir, the Scottish market leader of the time,
as well as to England, Norway and Canada to gain experience, his
fledgling business was making its own timber-frame kits. He bought the
15-acre site of an old croft at Westhill, put the offices in the croft
house and started making the kits in the byre. The current 50,000 sq ft
facility stands on the same site today.
The Barratt/World in Action saga, he recalled, had only a temporary
impact on the market for timber-frame houses north of the Border.
Builders with a UK-wide exposure were the main victims. Indeed, the
1985/86 oil crisis had a much bigger impact on Milne's growth plans than
the earlier television coverage.
But even that ''hiccup'' was a chance to hone the group's thinking.
Construction, much of it house building for local authorities and
housing associations, saw the group through a difficult time. There was
a first restructuring at that time. The group remained profitable.
Non-executive advice was sought.
''I never thought we would fail,'' Milne said. ''Profits fell as low
as #60,000 one year, which was pretty near the bone, but we took action
early to streamline our operations and we survived.''
There was a second restructuring early last year, to get the group
into the right shape for its drive into the central belt and, on the
timber-frame side, into England. Thirty-five jobs, at every level in the
organisation, went. The group, trading through a series of businesses
all with their own names, was pulled under a single identity, the
Stewart Milne Group, with five operational divisions -- homes, north and
south; developments; construction, and timber systems.
With a highly professional team around him, including brother Hamish,
Stewart Milne is finding more time to take the strategic view and to
serve on outside bodies, such as Grampian Enterprise and the Scottish
Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets.
Although he has geographical expansion on his mind, Milne last year
floated plans for a major new village at Kingswells, west of Aberdeen,
an #80m development of 700 houses, a shopping centre, a school and
community buildings. Work on that could start by the end of this year.
That's some joiner you've got on your board, Mr Donald.

* At present I have a 25-year endowment mortgage which has nine years
left to run. Could you advise me if I can change my mortgage to a
straight repayment and cash in or auction my endowment policy. If this
is possible what is the best method?
* You will need the permission of your mortgage provider for this, but
there is no reason why the lender should not agree. Changing to a
repayment method for the final nine years could mean a considerably
larger monthly payment than you make under the current arrangements.
As for the endowment policy, you should find out its surrender value
and also consult an auctioneer of these policies such as Foster &amp;
Cranfield (telephone 0171 608 1941) and one of the market makers in
with-profits policies such as Beale Dobie (telephone 0621 951133) or
Scottish Endowment Consultants (0141 777 6559).
* I have a Guardian Royal Exchange ''maximum investment plan'' which I
started in June 1988. I pay #50 a month until May 1998, and there is
life assurance protection of #4500. Accumulation units are invested in
the managed fund, and in the statement of June 1994 the number of units
in the plan was 620.9 with a cash value of #3931.
I would welcome your views on this investment and whether I should
continue with the plan until May 1998. My suspicion is that I fell for
commission-driven advice.
* Guardian Royal Exchange's managed fund has been rather a
disappointing performer, generally yielding a below-average return in
its sector. These investment plans give a tax-free sum after 10 years
and have an element of life cover, but they are rather poor value
because of the level of charges.
If you cash in early you will suffer penalties, so it is a question of
weighing up the surrender value against a better return you would
probably obtain elsewhere, such as in a growth investment trust.
* My wife and I are both retired and aged 65 years. Our current income
is made up of #8757 from an annuity and #5000 joint state pension.
Rather than take income from other pensions which I am listing, I have
tended to supplement existing income by withdrawing capital from a
Yorkshire Building Society first postal account, currently standing at
#31,745.
In terms of immediate cash realisation, I would have access to:
#36,759 Northern Rock postal 60; #18,000 Yorkshire Premier Tessas;
#10,000 Sun Life PEPs; #2600 Scottish Amicable PEP; #13,746 Sun Life
Master Portfolio; #5145 Premium Bonds. We also have about #154,000
invested in various Sun Life pension plans, with-profits and
distribution funds, and #158,000 in other Sun Life with-profits and
distribution funds.
I would really respect your advice with any observations you would
like to make.
* You could make more use of PEPs to take advantage of their tax-free
status. Your and your wife together can invest up to #12,000 a year in
general PEPs plus a further #6000 in single company PEPs and, given your
assets, you could build up a reasonable portfolio over the next couple
of years.
You should also think about the 7.5% gross return available from the
National Savings Pensioners' Bond and how this compares with the rate
you are getting on your building society funds.
Apart from these considerations, you have a lot of money with one
company, Sun Life, and while it has a sound track record, it is a good
idea to diversify one's investments. However, it would not be worth
incurring penalties to switch some of the funds into other hands.
Generally, you have a conservative portfolio which should deliver
steady appreciation. However, it would be a mistake to delay taking an
income from the pension plans for too long, and it might be worth
investigating the new flexible annuities when they are available. They
will allow the pension fund to remain in place rather than be used to
buy a single annuity.
* Some eight years ago I was advised, considering my income and
relative youth, that I should begin to invest for at least the medium
term. I duly did so and began monthly payments into a 10-year Cornhill
savings plan (managed fund) and later into another 10-year MI Group
savings plan (also managed fund).
Last month I began to review my financial position and did some
background research into my current investments to find that the two
investments were not for 10 years but 40 years with an option to
surrender after 10 years. In other words I was sold policies four times
longer than had been asked for or sold on.
A surrender after 10 years will mean that I would, at best, get back
what had been invested and which is many thousands of pounds short of
what had been conservatively promised by the adviser. I would be most
interested in your opinion on how I should proceed.
* The Cornhill policy is probably a maximum investment plan which
carries penalties if surrender takes place before 10 years have elapsed.
But once 10 years are up it can be cashed in with no penalty and no tax
liability.
The MI policy appears to be a straightforward savings plan with some
life cover. According to the company, it can be cashed in at any time
and you receive the bid price of the units. The charges were taken at
the beginning of the plan, which have held back its performance. This
should now improve. The 40 years of your plans are a nominal period
only.
Performance figures go back 10 years for the Cornhill fund and five
years for the MI, and over these periods both have track records a
little below the average for managed funds.
As for the adviser's promises, you will have to take him to task. If
you want to pursue it further you should contact his regulatory body,
which will either be the Personal Investment Authority (telephone 0171
929 0072) or FIMBRA (0171 538 8860).
Puzzled about liability for National Insurance
* Can you please explain to me the significance of Class 4 National
Insurance contributions? I have read the Inland Revenue booklets which
are available for someone becoming self-employed, and it seems to me
that there is no benefit to be had from the payment of these
contributions.
* Payment of National Insurance contributions under Class 1, 2 or 3
will entitle you to some form of social security benefit such as
retirement pension, sickness or unemployment benefit. There are no such
benefits attaching to contributions made under Class 4, and it can be
regarded by self-employed earners as merely an additional ''tax'' on
their profits.
Class 4 contributions are charged in the annual income tax assessment
on business profits and are a percentage of part of these profits. The
current rate is 7.3% of profit between #6490 and #22,360 and, therefore,
the maximum amount which can be charged is #1158.51, or 7.3% of #15,870
which is the difference between these profit levels. No charge is levied
on profits below #6490.
For those who are both employed and self-employed, Class 4
contributions are taken into account in calculating the maximum annual
amount to be paid under all classes.
Don't forget that 50% of the amount of Class 4 contributions payable
is allowable for income tax purposes on a deduction from profits.
* I have decided to sell my house which is now much too big for my
needs and move to a smaller property. I am, however, worried about the
amount of capital gains tax which will be due and would welcome your
advice.
The house was left to me in my husband's will, and after his death I
started to let two of the rooms. I understand this is the reason capital
gains tax will be payable when I sell, but I am not sure how this will
be calculated. Is the tax simply due on the selling price as the house
was inherited and not paid for by me?
* You certainly do not have to pay tax on the full sale price, and it
is possible there will, in fact, be no capital gains liability. You will
be treated as having acquired the property at its value on the date of
your husband's death, and you will be able to find out this figure from
the solicitor who dealt with his estate.
The gain arising will be the difference between this figure, as
increased by indexation allowance (an allowance for inflation), and the
proceeds received less sale expenses.
Part of the property has been used as your private residence and,
therefore, the proportion of gain to which this refers will be exempt.
If, for example, the house has eight rooms of which two were let, then
only one-quarter of the gain is potentially liable to tax. There is also
an exemption which applies to the letting of residential property which
amounts to either #40,000 or the amount of the private residence
exemption mentioned above, whichever is the less.
If the exemptions do not fully cover the gain, then there is still the
annual capital gains exemption, currently #5800, unless this has been
used elsewhere.
Providing for the future
* I am in my middle 50s with an income, including pension, of #37,000
per annum. The company I am with at the moment is going through
difficulties and continued employment is not assured. Because of various
job changes over the last 10 years, pension prospects are not as good as
I would have liked.
We have the following savings and investments: 3510 Stakis; 3040
General Accident; 5000 Burns Stewart; 600 British Gas; 2345 Hewden
Stuart; 986 British Telecom; #2800 in Halifax sharesave account; #66,273
in N&amp;P private reserve; #13,824 in N&amp;P Tessa; #26,343 in N&amp;P PEP; #4100
in premium bonds; #20,000 in Sun Life Flexible Bond, and #10,000 in
General Accident Capital Guarantee Bond.
There is a Standard Life endowment for #35,000 (maturing 2006), a
Scottish Amicable endowment for #20,000 (maturing 2008), CIS life
assurance estimated to yield #40,000 at maturity in 2000, and a Scottish
Provident joint life inheritance tax policy for #68,960. Our mortgage is
#55,000.
The investments are in my wife's name for tax reasons, except for half
the Tessa and the PEPs.
Would you advise paying off #25,000 of our mortgage? We have not taken
up this year's PEP allowance and wondered if National Power/PowerGen
PEPs would be advisable. Any comments on our investments would be
appreciated.
* Though you are concerned about your pension arrangements and the
security of your present job, you have substantial capital of over
#175,000 at your disposal before taking account of your considerable
life assurance provision.
We would recommend that you explore ways in which to enhance your
pension provision. Your letter suggests that your current income of
#37,000 includes some pension from previous employment, which would
presumably continue if you lost your present job.
Almost half of your total capital is in building society deposits, and
it would, therefore, make sense to reduce your mortgage to #30,000,
which is the ceiling for the diminishing benefit of mortgage interest
tax relief. This would result in a substantial reduction in your monthly
payments. You could use this to improve your pension arrangements, if
possible, and/or make monthly savings in investment trust shares, which
are an ideal vehicle for capital growth.
As your resources are substantial and you are a 40% taxpayer, building
up your PEPs is attractive. The power generators are being offered on
appealing terms to small investors, but you might not get enough to
justify PEPing your holding.
You already have shares in a couple of utilities, whose long-term
prospects are clouded by the power of the regulators. So it is not wise
to go overboard with this type of investment.
Your six shareholdings are worth nearly #35,000, about 20% of your
capital. Your holding of General Accident accounts for nearly half of
this. You have #30,000 in insurance bonds, much too much for a
pedestrian investment. Even after using #25,000 of your cash to reduce

THE tax system is on the verge of its biggest revolution since PAYE
was introduced in 1944. In just over a year's time, in April 1996, a new
system of self-assessment will be launched which will radically change
the way in which more than nine million people pay their tax.
If you are self-employed, a partner, a company director, pay higher
rate tax or your tax affairs are complicated for some other reason,
these changes will affect you.
To help you get to grips with the new system, here are the main
changes in the form of a series of questions and answers.
I am a basic rate taxpayer and I pay my tax through the PAYE system. I
get a small amount of interest from my building society account. What
does self-assessment mean for me?
For you, it's business as usual. You will continue to pay tax through
the PAYE system.
I am self-employed. Does self-assessment mean that I have to work out
my own tax bill? At the moment I leave this to the Inland Revenue which
sends me a notice of assessment which I check carefully.
No, but you can if you want to. Under self-assessment you can fill in
your tax return and let the Inland Revenue work out the tax bill. This
is called Revenue calculation. Or you can work out your own tax bill.
This is called taxpayer calculation.
If you use the taxpayer calculation method, the latest date for
sending in your tax return is January 31 after the end of the tax year
it covers. If you opt to use the Revenue calculation, you must get your
tax return in four months earlier, that is by September 30.
I understand that self-assessment means you pay tax on income during
the tax year you earn it. Under the present system I can pay my tax up
to three years after earning it.
Under the present tax system, most self-employed people pay tax on
what is known as the preceding year basis. Tax is paid on the money
earned in the previous year, and if you arrange your own accounting year
so that it starts near the beginning of the tax year, say the end of
April, tax could be delayed for up to three years.
This how it works. Take the example of someone who makes up their
accounts to April 30 and who has earned #30,000 in the year to the end
of April 1994. This is the figure for income which they use when filling
in their 1995/96 tax return, which does not have to be filed until
October of 1995. The tax is finally due on January 1 and July 1, 1996.
Under self-assessment, you pay tax on a current year basis, which
effectively means you will be paying tax a year earlier than now, with
the first payment made on January 31 in the tax year it is due, and the
second one on July 31.
The tax you pay will be based on the previous year's tax bill and
there will be a balancing payment, or refund, once your actual tax bill
for the year is known. An allowance for this balancing payment or refund
is made to your next tax payment, which falls due the following January
31.
Wouldn't it be easier if I made my accounts coincide with the actual
tax year?
It would certainly be easier for the Inland Revenue, but you can still
keep your previous accounting year if you want to.
However, if you prefer the idea of paying your taxes as you go along
and dislike the confusion of the old system, you may decide to simplify
your tax affairs and make your accounts coincide with the tax year which
ends on April 5 each year.
Doesn't this mean that I am going to suffer very heavy tax bills for a
couple of years?
Yes it could. The Inland Revenue also fears that the change could mean
some profits don't get taxed at all and that one year's earnings could
disappear into the gap created by the change from a preceding year to a
current year basis.
To solve this problem, there is to be a transition year where a
combination of both methods is to be used to determine tax bills.
When is this new system being introduced?
The first full tax year to which self-assessment applies is 1997/98.
The first of a new generation of self-assessment tax forms will be sent
out in April 1997 for completion by January 31, 1998. But you will need
to be familiar with the new system during the transitional 1996/97 tax
year, when your tax bill will be partly based on your current year's
earnings, and partly on a preceding year basis.
If I work out my own tax bill, how will the Inland Revenue know if I
am telling the truth?
The Inland Revenue will carry out random spot checks. If it wants to
look at your books it can tell you at any time up to a year after the
final date for filing your tax return.

AS investors puzzle over the problem of where markets are really going
and wish they had sold out and taken the money to the building society
the moment interest rates began to move up, investment trust managers
may well be thinking about whether they should plan to buy in some of
their warrants if the rules allow them.
Of course, not all trusts have warrants, but they have been a feature
of new issues for some time and there are a lot of them about.
The attraction of warrants is that they give the holder the right to
buy the underlying share at a fixed price at some time in the future,
which usually means a fair number of years. The hope is that the trust
(or company) will do sufficiently well for its share price to rise above
the sum of the price paid in the market for the warrant and the
subscription price which must be paid to get the shares.
Looked at as long-term option money, they can give the investor an
involvement in a considerably larger number of shares for a given amount
of cash than if the money had been invested in the shares direct. In
rising markets the gearing effect can be very pleasant, although one has
to be aware that there are snakes as well as ladders in this game, and
the snakes can be pretty steep too.
It may also be worth remembering that most investment trust warrants
were issued ''free'', usually in the ratio of one warrant to five shares
when the trust was floated. They were issued because, while costing the
trust nothing other than a little paper and a printing bill, they
created some value to the initial subscribers to the shares.
Without them, the new shares would have been likely to trade at an
immediate discount simply because the launch costs would mean shares
issued at 100p would have an asset value on day one of, say, only 95p or
thereabouts. With luck, the package of shares plus warrants might even
start life with a tiny premium.
If you wanted to be critical, you could argue that a warrant in an
investment trust with a possibly limited life is not quite the same
thing as a warrant on the shares of a company such as BTR where, you
might say, they will bring in capital which can be usefully employed. In
an investment trust the warrants, assuming they are exercised, will
dilute the asset value of the existing shares.
Philip Middleton, investment trust analyst at broker Smith New Court,
makes the point in his latest Investment Trust Quarterly that they
''should be treated as a significant liability of the trust and managed
accordingly''.
He says that, in theory, trust managers could enhance shareholder
value by selling additional warrants when warrants are dear. But he
admits that, in practice, this is not a runner as trusts which do issue
warrants usually do so right up to the 20% limit, and in any case the
sector is used to warrants being ''given'' rather than sold.
Giving the industry a bit of a nudge, he points out: ''The flip side
of 'sell when dear' is 'buy when cheap'. It is this which we believe
trust managers should pay more attention to. The key point is that a
warrant can be cheap to the trust itself yet dear to warrant holders.''
As a theoretical example he says: ''Take a warrant that is due to be
exercised in a day's time where the exercise price is 100p, the stock
price is 180p, and net asset value is 200p.
''The warrant is worth 80p to warrant holders. From the company's
point of view, though, if it pays 80p per warrant it is enhancing its
net asset value. All the time the warrants are bought in at less than
the equivalent of diluted net asset value. In this situation the net
asset value is enhanced.''
He stresses that buying in ''only makes sense if the Ordinary Shares
are trading at a discount. If this is the case, the market is saying
that there is too great a number of Ordinary Shares in issue. Creating
more of the same by not buying in warrants is, in this context, akin to
delivering additional indians to General Custer.''
On the subject of discounts, looking at the investment trust sector in
general, Mr Middleton says that while they have widened ''we do not
believe that they have widened enough to make the sector cheap''.
Having recommended being ''underweight'' in the sector for some time,
he does, however, say that in response to ''the improvement in value
which we have seen over the last quarter, we are moving from being
underweight to a less extreme stance''.
He adds: ''In response to the memory of the levels at which quality
stocks could be bought in 1992,'' when he was recommending being heavily
overweight, ''we are still some way from recommending an overweight
stance''.
Reminding investors of the importance of interest rates, he comments
that while he is inclined to reduce his bet against the sector, ''unless
the world changes quickly and dramatically -- and interest rate cycles
usually last more than one year -- the down side in the sector still
clearly outweighs the potential for a re-rating.''
And until the interest rate environment improves, he says: ''There is
always the possibility of something nasty being in the woodshed.''
Among his recommendations, he believes the case for Throgmorton,
Electra and Scottish Eastern still seems very strong, as they will
benefit from resumption of out-performance by smaller companies.
And he says: ''Just about every US specialist looks cheap,'' naming
particularly American Trust and US Smaller Companies.
Closer to home, he highlights the two European privatisation trusts,
Mercury and Kleinwort. ''Both are undoubtedly cheap, even taking account
of the effect of warrants in issue.''

WITH just a few weeks left until the end of the tax year, it is an
appropriate time for those with a portfolio of stocks and shares to
review their capital gains tax postiion.
Capital gains tax is calculated on gains realised in the tax year
ended on April 5. Chargeable gains are subject to tax at rates which are
calculated as though the gain was the top slice of your income. That
means they can bear tax at 20%, 25% or, if your taxable gains when
aggregated with your taxable income exceed the basic rate band, 40%.
There is a major relief, which is that each individual has an annual
exemption of #5800 of tax-free gains. Year-end planning for capital
gains tax should concentrate on ensuring this is fully used.
Start by adding up the gains and losses you have made on transactions
in the year to date, including any gains on assets other than shares. If
you acquired your shareholding at different times, special rules exist
to identify the cost of the shares disposed of. For shares acquired
after April 6, 1982 the cost is pooled. It is increased by an adjustment
to take account of inflation, known as the indexation allowance.
At its simplest, this is calculated by applying a formula to the cost
each time there is an acquisition or disposal. The formula is RE minus
RL divided by RL. RE is the retail price index for the month in which
the acquisition or disposal takes place. RL is the retail price index
for the last occasion on which the pool was uplifted by indexation.
In a straightforward case where shares were bought in January 1990 and
sold in November 1994, the formula would give the result 145.3 minus
119.5 divided by 119.5, which is 0.216. The cost is then multiplied by
0.216, and the result is added to the cost to arrive at the allowable
deduction from the proceeds of the shares.
Different more complex rules apply where shares were acquired prior to
March 31, 1982. Then indexation is calculated by reference to the retail
price index at that date, not the acquisition date. A comparison is also
made with the gain calculated on the value of the shares at March 31,
1982, with only the smaller gain by reference to cost or March 31, 1982
value being taxed, or the smaller loss being allowed.
If there is a gain by reference to cost, and a loss by reference to
March 31, 1982 value, or vice versa, the sale is treated as giving rise
to neither gain nor loss. If, however, an election is in force for
universal rebasing of assets acquired prior to March 31, 1982 to their
value on that date, cost is completely ignored.
Your stockbroker or accountant should be able to supply you with
retail indices for the relevant dates as well as March 31, 1982 share
prices for quoted shares, but in view of the complexity of the
calculations professional help should be sought for all but the
simplest.
Once you know your gains to date, consider if they exceed the annual
exemption. If they don't there is scope to realise further tax-free
gains.
If you don't want to dispose of your shares completely, you could
consider bed and breakfasting to realise the amount of the exemption.
This involves selling shares on one day and buying them back the next.
It is not possible to do this on the same day or to buy before the sale,
as the purchase and sale would be matched together in calculating the
gain and so be ineffective. Your broker can arrange the transactions on
succeeding days so the price movement is usually minimal. Typically,
brokers will charge only a small commission on sales and none on
repurchases.
Similarly, if your gains exceed the exempt amount, a bed and breakfast
transaction can be used to crystallise losses, if any, on other shares
to bring the taxable level back down to the exempt amount. Although this
defers the gain to a later time when the bed and breakfasted shares are
ultimately sold, it may be possible to cover the gains completely by the
annual exemption of a later year.
From April 6 it will no longer be possible to create or augment a loss
by using the indexation allowance, and you should look at 1994/95 as
your last opportunity to do this. Again, professional advice should be
sought.
If you have a loss for the year to date, it can be carried forward to
future years and offset against gains in that year. The annual exemption
will, however, be lost so, again, bed and breakfasting, this time to
realise gains to the amount of the annual exemption plus loss, can be
worthwhile.
If you are lucky enough to have potential gains in excess of the
annual exemption which you wish to realise, you might consider whether
to defer this until after April 5. The advantage is that tax will not be
payable until December 1 this year instead of December 1 last. The
downside risks are that the stock market might fall or the Chancellor
might increase tax rates in his Budget.
Finally, remember that gains on gilt edged securities are free of
capital gains tax, as are gains on shares held in PEPS. If you are
taking gains it is worthwhile reinvesting the proceeds in a PEP up to
the annual limit of #6000 into a general plan and #3000 into a single
company one. At these levels you can build up a sizeable portfolio free
of capital gains tax in just a few years.

NORTHERN Electric has issued a hard-hitting defence against Trafalgar
House's #1200m bid but analysts believe the company remains doomed to
lose its independence.
The group is proposing effectively to hand back 507p per share to
shareholders, a total of #627m, and also to raise dividends for the year
to next month by a third to 33p. In each of the two following years it
forecasts increases of 13%.
However the package is not as generous as it sounds for there would be
a nearly corresponding reduction in Northern's share price. Trafalgar
claims shareholders would give back with one hand all they gained with
the other but the shares would probably fall by less than 507p in
practice.
All Trafalgar needs to do is to raise its offer a little, which it was
probably budgeting to do anyway, to clinch the deal. Northern's small
shareholders might stay loyal, at least those who are customers as well,
but they account for only 18% of the shares.
The decision as usual rests with the institutions. They have seen a
good run for their money, with the shares having more than quadrupled
since flotation, and by accepting the offer they will encourage other
bids in the sector. Failure would put other potential bidders off. The
company most often mentioned as being vulnerable is Yorkshire, with Lord
Hanson, a Yorkshireman himself, the favoured bidder.
The 507p per share package comprises a 150p per share special payout
plus a bonus issue of one new irredeemable Preference share for each
share which would carry a cash alternative of 100p. The group's holding
in National Grid would effectively be passed on to shareholders, which
is said to be worth a further 257p, based on outside forecasts. This is
on top of a one-third increase in normal dividends to 33p.
The cash for the payout would come initially from Northern's banks. It
would be financed with borrowed money which would push gearing up to a
very high 225% by March next year. The group says its strong and
predictable cash flow means this could be comfortably financed and
steadily reduced. But gearing would still be 100% by the year 2000.
On the forecast dividends, Northern shares would yield a prospective
8.6% in 1995/96 and 9.7% the year after that, on the basis of the bid
price minus 507p. The prospective yield on the shares before the bid was
about 4% so it might be thought that the shares after the bid had failed
would level out to give a similar yield.
In fact the yield would be considerably higher to compensate for the
worsened financial state of the company, which would be saddled with
much higher interest costs, and the absence of a bid premium.
Analysts considered the shares would settle at about 700p to give a
yield of nearly 6%, which would put the value of an independent Northern
at around 1200p (including the 507p). This is likely to be around the
level of a revised offer from Trafalgar. Such a move would probably
cause Northern to throw in the towel as its defence has really come down
to a question of money rather than an attack on Trafalgar's ability to
run the company.
Northern forecasts profits in the year to next month of at least
#150m, up from #129m, and promises to focus on its core business rather
than develop non-regulated activities. An ''even tighter'' rein would be
held over costs through further manpower reductions which would yield a
150% cut in real operating costs in the six years to 2000.
Capital spending in this period would be held to #360m. No further
investment would be made in electricity generation nor in gas production
and the retail side would not open more out of town sites.
It is difficult to see what more Northern could have done in its fight
to remain independent but it will almost certainly prove to have been in
vain. But shareholders should continue to wait and see what Trafalgar
will do now. Northern shares rose 19p to 1112p yesterday in
anticipation.

WELLCOME Trust, owner of a 39.5% stake in the drugs company Wellcome,
was yesterday given the go-ahead by the High Court in London to sell its
stake to rival drugs firm Glaxo.
However the court modified the original terms of the Trust's
irrevocable commitment with Glaxo so that the latest date on which the
acceptance must be submitted is now March 8. Previously the Trust had
been committed to selling to Glaxo by February 28. Court permission is
required because of the terms of the will of Sir Henry Wellcome. Both
the Trust and the company grew out of his bequests.
Glaxo is currently offering #9000m to buy Wellcome in what, if
successful, will be the UK's largest corporate takeover. Glaxo has
already spent #47m in professional fees for bankers, lawyers etc. News
of the approval pushed up Wellcome shares by 5p to 1028p while Glaxo
shares initially dropped 4p to 637p but later were unchanged at 641p.
John Robb, chairman and chief executive of Wellcome, welcomed the
decision which effectively gives him and his team a further eight days
to find a white knight prepared to top the Glaxo offer.
The Trust can terminate its irrevocable commitment with Glaxo and its
acceptance may be withdrawn if a higher bid emerges before the Glaxo
offer becomes wholly unconditional. Mr Robb is continuing to recommend
that shareholders take no action in respect of the Glaxo offer.
He believes that the company is worth more than Glaxo is offering
although not surprisingly at this stage he is not willing to name his
price. Mr Robb said that the Glaxo offer was ''very long on cost
synergies but not very persuasive in terms of revenue synergies and
building the business''. He has so far refused to see Sir Richard Sykes,
deputy chairman and chief executive of Glaxo who had initially wanted a
friendly merger.
In the past few weeks Mr Robb has been on a frantic dash around the US
and Continental Europe trying to flush out a rival bidder. Given the
scale of any rival offer he is not surprised that as yet no-one has come
forward but professes to be ''pleased with the response we have had so
far''.
Wellcome's annual report published earlier in the week showed there
are 48 million share options outstanding for Wellcome employees. If all
these become exercisable following a takeover it would bring Wellcome
directors and staff a profit of up to #200m, the equivalent of about
#11,000 each. Six Wellcome directors could make profits of up to #6m
through a variety of option schemes.

WATSON &amp; Philip yesterday said it remained on course for a current
year profits boost of up to #1m from National Lottery ticket sales, as
it issued a confident first-quarter trading statement.
At the Dundee-based convenience stores and food distribution group's
annual general meeting, chairman James Watson said the company had
started the year well and looked forward to a third year of strong
progress in shareholder value.
Shares moved up 1p to 361p after the meeting, against the backdrop of
a slightly weak market.
Watson &amp; Philip has refocused its operations, concentrating on its
rapidly expanding Alldays convenience stores chain and its Foodservice
catering supply business.
Average weekly takings at National Lottery outlets in 185 of its 395
Alldays stores have moved ahead slightly in recent weeks to #3800. The
company receives 5p for every #1 ticket sold and, taking into account
costs of 2p in the pound, net commission is 3p.
The #1m estimate does not take into account spin-off trade from the
extra custom.
Figures released this week by the British Retail Consortium showed
Lottery sales increased to a weekly average of #62.4m in January and
accounted for 2.3% of total retail sales.
Meanwhile, Foodservice sales were up 15% on the first quarter of the
previous financial year, boosted by more business from existing
customers as well as gains in market share. Gross margins moved up
slightly.
Total sales in Alldays stores were up 23%. Like-for-like sales fell 3%
because of the switch from high volume but low margin grocery lines to
more profitable goods such as newspapers, magazines, and chilled and
frozen products.
However, gross profit was up 1% on a like-for-like basis during the
first three months.
Although first-quarter sales in Watson &amp; Philip's Trademarket
cash-and-carry business were down 2%, the company said this reflected
its ''sensible'' festive trading position and gross margins were in line
with expectations.
Last month, Watson &amp; Philip reported a 26% increase in operating
profits to #16m during the year to October. Disregarding a #4.6m
exceptional charge relating to goodwill and a one-off disposal gain,
underlying pre-tax profits were up 21% at #14.2m.
Chief executive David Bremner said: ''We have opened the first three
months in line with our expectations in all parts of the group.''

THE COMPETITIVE pressures facing food retailers in the UK remain
intense. One only has to look at the figures from Argyll Group, owners
of Safeway supermarkets, for the evidence. In the 17 weeks to February
underlying sales grew by just 1.4% in existing stores with new store
openings taking the overall sales growth to 9%.
The company said that while gross margins were on an improving trend
they are ''expected to be a little below last year'' for the second half
as whole. This reflects Safeway's price cutting initiatives aimed at
encouraging customers to part with their cash.
However the current trading position is much improved on the position
which the company disclosed at the interim stage last November when
sales were down 0.8% at existing stores. The group's trading performance
recovered in December in the run-up to Christmas. ''It is pleasing to
report that this improved performance has been sustained'' said chairman
Sir Alistair Grant.
Despite fears of oversaturation in UK food retailing given the rapid
expansion of out of town stores and the growing presence of overeas
discount operators, the major supermarket groups are continuing to open
new stores. Safeway plans to open seven more stores, equivalent to
235,000 sq ft, in the remainder of the financial year to March.
UK food retailing has changed markedly in the past two years for the
good of consumers if not the companies. Pricing pressure, cost control
and improved return on investment are the key determinants of
profitability these days. Occupying third place in UK supermarket
retailing behind Sainsbury and Tesco, Argyll is on stony ground and
indeed has been mentioned as a possible bid target for the
acquisition-hungry industrial conglomerate Hanson.

THE pound was caught in the cross-fire between a strong German mark,
widely perceived to be a safe haven in times of currency turmoil, and a
weak dollar, undermined by Mexico's unresolved financial crisis.
Trading was exceptionally volatile with the dollar bouncing back after
hitting its lowest level against the Deutschmark since October 1992.
Sterling's trade weighted index was unchanged at 87.1, above its low
for the week, but against the mark the pound shed 0.63 pfennigs to
2.3457, still three pfennigs above its all-time low in February 1993. It
lost 0.11 cents to $1.5765.
The dollar jumped half a pfennig in the late afternoon, prompting
speculation that there had been low key central bank intervention in
Europe on the cross rates. But there was no official confirmation of
this.
The dollar fell to DM1.4768 in morning trade, but had recovered to
DM1.4876 by the close of European trading. It drew some solace from
better than expected US trade figures.
The deficit fell to $7340m in December from November's $10.04bn, but
the annual shortfall jumped 43% to $108.11bn.
There was intervention by central banks in Italy and Portugal to
defend the lira, which traded at an all-time low against the mark, and
the escudo. The French franc fell to a 15-month low.
The mark has gained about 2% against the pound and the lira in the
last six trading sessions and has jumped 4% against the dollar.
The pound has been in the doghouse for a fortnight as the Government's
political weakness and inflation worries have undermined sentiment.
But the dollar's plight has been greater, and this has enabled
sterling to confine its losses in international terms.
The Mexican crisis is too close for comfort, and the dollar's weakness
against the mark and the yen is in contrast to its strength against the
peso and the Canadian dollar.
American interest rates went up by half a percent at the start of the
month and there are some signs that the pace of activity has slowed.
This has led to speculation that US rates are close to their peak.  By
contrast a threatened strike over pay by German engineering workers has
led to speculation that the Bundesbank might raise rates sooner than
expected.

JUST how wrong can you get it? This week I want to share with you
several instances in which the facts were misconstrued. My catalyst was
the Rev Tom Morton, formerly of Stonelaw, who appeared at Glasgow
Presbytery to receive congratulations on having attained the golden
jubilee of his ordination -- proof that he must be at least 75 years old
(and untarnished).
His reception was proof enough of the affection in which this
gentleman minister is held, and his spry and slim physique proof that he
is still extremely active as an associate in Burnside. For many years he
has fostered the Kirk side of the Glasgow Council of Christians and Jews
and repaid his listeners with an excellent Jewish joke, told (as the
best Jewish jokes usually are) by a Jew.
It concerned a man who came back from the war seeking a suit to wear
in civvy street when he saw a sign in a tailor's shop window.
What do you think
My name is Fink
I make suits for nothing
In five days
He was duly measured and returned in five days to collect a splendid
suit. ''That will be 22 guineas,'' said the tailor. ''But what about
your sign in the window?'' replied the customer. ''It says you make
suits for nothing.'' ''Oh no,'' said the tailor with a shrug. ''You have
misread it. Look again. It says 'What do you think my name is? Fink I
make suits for nothing in five days?' ''
* AT the same Presbytery meeting, the Rev Alan Sorensen pointed out
that his local newspaper in Pollokshields had just announced that the
burnt-out shell of Sherbrooke St Gilbert's church was to be restored to
its former Victorian glory. Since he did not remember presbytery
approval having been given yet, he wondered why. This elicited a rather
testy response explaining that since insurance monies fell somewhat
short of a full restoration, the decision to rebuild in the form of the
original has yet to be taken.
Mr Sorensen cannot be blamed for taking an interest in the matter. His
own church two miles down the road in Pollok was demolished last October
and the Househillwood congregation are worshipping in the church hall
(built to utility standards in the era of Mr Fink's suits but which have
proved more durable than the dud design of the 1961 church).
Househillwood were promised money for a new church at the General
Assembly two years ago, but this was revoked following the Kirk's
financial crisis. Disaster also struck the plan to unite them with St
James's Pollok, which was voted down.
Mr Sorensen has remained remarkably cheery through all this, as
listeners to his Sunday morning Radio Clyde programme will testify,
although not all may share his sense of humour. After the recent floods,
he was heard to express sympathy for the residents of sodden Paisley and
then announce the next hymn, which happened to be Shall We Gather at the
River?
* THE prize for the most misconstrued situation of the year must
surely go to Brian McConnell, the veteran crime reporter, whose book
Holy Killers has just been published by Headline, a division of Hodder.
It purports to deal with stories of murderous clerics, priests, and
religious leaders and features on the cover a photograph of James Nelson
which appeared in this newspaper in 1983, when his conviction for
matricide was being debated in connection with his application to become
a minister of the Kirk.
On opening the book we find that while Bible John merits a chapter, Mr
Nelson occupies only a brief paragraph on page 7. Mr McConnell reveals
the reason: ''The argument we should all have an unremitting capacity
for forgiveness and that he should be admitted to the ministry was put
to the elders of the church. They refused him a dog collar but only by
43 votes to 42.''
This ''fact'' will probably cause great confusion in Chapelhall and
rumours that their minister is an impostor. It causes me to wonder
whether the only fact that can be trusted about the book is that it has
378 pages.
* MY final illustration of misconstrued facts may be apocryphal. It
concerns the Bible text ''Perfect love casteth out fear'' which appears
in the First Epistle of John, chapter four, verse 18. Wishing to send
this text as a telegram to a newlywed couple, an Aberdonian realised he
would save costs if he rendered it as ''I JOHN 4.18''. Unfortunately,
the ''I'' was missed and on turning a Bible to John 4.18 the best man
read out the words -- from Jesus's encounter at the Samarian well with
the polygamous woman -- ''Thou hast had five husbands and the one with
thee now is not thy husband . . .''

SO here it is. My first time in print. I've been asking the basic
questions, trying to get to grips with this game. Why did they ask me to
do a column? What am I going to write about? Where am I to get ideas
from? Who can I copy? More importantly, when am I going to be found out?
I've approached this like a true professional. I downed five pints of
lager, waited for a quote all day outside a grieving widow's house, and
then fabricated the entire piece with a total disregard for morals,
truth, or expenses. I forgot that Herald journalists are different. It
should have been eight pints.
As I tried to start this first column, I was analysing what made me
accept this assignment. As with most problems in Scotland, football is
to blame. Deep down, I'm only trying to compensate for being a terrible
footballer. Anyone who knows me can confirm that I completely bypassed
the ''shimmy past three men'' phase of my footballing career and
progressed straight to the skill required for the ''pub-owning,
ruddy-faced, bad cup final anecdote on TV'' phase.
This is not to say that I never ever played well. Every dog has its
day, and in 1975 I had my time with the footballing equivalent of my own
bodyweight in Bonio dog biscuits, a scrap yard full of lamp-posts, and
four bitches hanging round my tail. I was asked to help out with a trial
match at my new school as they were a man short. Luckily, I had spent
that summer practising the three skills at which all professionals
excel; passing, shooting, and clearing the nose while running.
After borrowing some kit I took my place in the centre of defence (at
primary school, fat blokes play in goal, tall fat blokes play centre
half). I can't recall exactly what colour the strip was, but some
textile expert had apparently discovered a new way of torturing man-made
fibres, ensuring that they were as comfy and warm as the average welcome
mat.
To crown the indignity, some designer had decided that it would be a
good idea to sew on an elaborate pattern of hoops and wavy lines all
because, get this, the strip was made by a company called Admiral. It
might have looked good on paper (unlikely!), but when it means that your
arms can't bend because of piping overload, then someone should have a
rethink. Despite the strip, I played magnificently.
Maybe I was sufficiently distracted by the smelly chainmail gradually
eroding the top layer of skin, but for that hour, every tackle, every
pass, every move was just perfect. Perhaps it was because the other
players were steering well clear of the big bloke with the rhino-hide
shirt complete with matching odour, but I felt great. I can still see
Paul Halfpenny's despairing reach for the ball as it roared 20 yards
into the top right hand corner for my most spectacular goal ever.
Being positive, I suppose I gained a degree of respectability among my
peers, but in the transience lay the tragedy. After my day of glory, it
was back on the lead, one chocolate drop, and no bitches. I came on as
substitute the next proper game, and played so badly that we lost a
three-goal lead. Roy of the Rovers to Roy ''Chubby'' Brown in one easy
move.
Being involved in the school team was my idea of schoolboy heaven. I
would have polished the boots to be part of the squad. I was actually so
keen I would have washed my hands, and maybe even my face. Looking back,
Mr Lawlor probably just never had the heart to drop me. I used to go
along and stand kitted out on the touchline, the rain scratching at my
bare legs, knowing I would have been allowed on only to help carry off
any badly injured players.
Being the football equivalent of the paper fire blanket didn't get me
down too much, and within a few weeks I was quite happy not to play.
This prevented me from letting the team down, and that was enough for
me. Years later my footballing career rose like a phoenix. Well,
admittedly, like one who had had a bad night, and who wanted to watch
the chart show while dozing on the couch.
At our level of university football the main selection requirement was
a talent for drinking two buckets of beer, and singing popular tunes of
the day, all amended to include references to virgins, animals, dental
students, or a combination of all three. I had found my niche in the
sporting world.
This explains why I found myself at The Herald, getting more restless
at the rate of 10 photos per second. All photographers seem to me to be
frustrated choreographers. ''Move your hand up. (Click, click.) Not that
much. (Click, click.) Now twitch your left nostril (click, click) up
towards your right ear. Perfect. (Click, click.) Stay like that and just
lift (click, click) your right ear a bit . . . (click, click). Now cross
your eyes. Hmm, can (click, click) you make it look a bit more (click,
click) . . . natural?'' I had to go through it all again, as the picture
editor couldn't accept that my head was ''a bit squinty''.
Once I'd deciphered this complicated jargon, I was pleased that it was
a postural problem, rather than a cosmetic one. At least my kisser can
be rendered less offensive by untilting it, which is a bonus really.
I've got off lightly this time. Usually, having failed to follow their
directions, the photographer will ensure that you look as though you
have contracted a severe neurological disorder. The one they're planning
to use here only makes me look fat and hungover. So I should be
grateful. The main trick to being pictured is to avoid the comedian's
''I understand the human condition'' pose. This deep, serious,
intelligent, deeply serious side, is supposed to fit in with the tears
of a clown nonsense, which as we all know is utter nonsense. Comedians
have the same emotions as everyone else: they'll laugh when they get
their gameshow, and they'll cry when they get a two-year driving ban.
But back to the point. In this column I should be asking important
questions in a thought-provoking way. Here we go.
Am I getting paid for this? . . . What do you mean? I am being
serious.
''Well Terry, did the boy done good?''
''Archie, I feel that he'll be a bit disappointed with the lack of
service from midfield . . .''
''A fair result?''
''It could be worse. A moderate start, and I'm sure the editor has
every confidence in him . . .''
''Uh-oh . . .''
''Have I said 110% yet? . . .''
* J P Leach is a clinical research fellow at the Western Infirmary. He
is also a stand-up comic. His column will appear in The Herald every
Saturday.

Graham Walker writes on Northern Ireland and the Scottish connection
and why Unionists should be encouraged to articulate a positive vision
for themselves and their troubled land
THE future of Northern Ireland hangs in the balance. The ceasefires
have been welcome but everyone in the Province knows that hard decisions
and sacrifices have to be made for them to prove permanent. Current
speculation about the framework document drawn up by the two governments
raises serious doubts about future progress.
Essentially, if the reports are accurate, the drift of the document is
towards joint authority and eventual Irish unification. If so, the stark
message to Unionists will be: the breaking of the Union is inevitable.
If the message is read as such, then many Unionists in Northern Ireland
may decide to leave. One likely destination is Scotland -- the place
they celebrate in their ethnic ''passion play'' as an ancestral
homeland. As a recent Scottish Television documentary revealed, they
would then be joining other refugees from Northern Ireland who have come
to Scotland over the course of the troubles. Scots kid themselves if
they think that Scotland has been untouched by the Ulster troubles, and
that a new diaspora from there in such circumstances would not increase
societal tensions here in the future.
Speculation about future close links between Northern Ireland and
Scotland of a progressive and mutually beneficial kind has thus to be
conducted against the tide of presumptions about the inevitability of
Irish unity and the detachment of Irish affairs from Britain. None the
less I believe such speculation is justified if only to encourage
Unionists to articulate a positive vision for themselves;
all-encompassing defeatism and despair will not of course augur well for
the prospects of a permanent peace. As I hope to show, there are sound
reasons why we should draw closer to Northern Ireland -- resolution of
the imbroglio there involves the cultivation of relationships in both
directions: from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK and to the rest
of Ireland.
Since the ceasefires in Northern Ireland there has been a greater
level of open debate across traditional divides. An example was a recent
television programme in which a Presbyterian minister, the Rev John
Dunlop, attempted to impress upon Sinn Fein representative Mitchel
McLaughlin that the Union for him meant the Scottish connection above
all else. He made it clear that he feared the breaking of the Union for
the survival of such cultural affinities.
Dunlop's point was at once a rare example of a positive defence of the
Unionist position and a rebuke to the Irish republican tendency to
equate the Union with Englishness, and with English misrule. For Irish
republicans it has always been a simple matter: the object was, and is,
''to break the connection with England''. The result of this has been to
reduce the terms of the debate to ''anti-imperialism v. loyalism''.
The political sterility of such an interpretation of the conflict has
carved arbitrary boundaries through the cultural possibilities existing
in Northern Ireland. The Scottish link, usually traced to the
plantations of the early seventeenth century, is identified almost
exclusively with the Loyalists as being part and parcel of the Union.
However, this belies the considerable Scottish associations past and
present of Catholic communities in Ulster, epitomised by the people of
the Antrim glens. The Scottish contribution to Gaelic culture in Ulster
over the centuries is also well documented. Overall, the Scottish-Ulster
relationship is one of the best illustrations of the cultural
cross-fertilisation which is a distinguishing feature of the British
Isles as a whole.
Indeed, one of the strongest arguments for the maintenance of the
Union in some form is the cultural breathing space that its broad
context supplies. A structurally reformed Union, decentralised in terms
of power and culturally pluralist and interactive, could be something
worth striving for, and Scotland's relationship with Ulster would be
central to any such project.
There is no doubt that many Scots have lost faith in the Union and
that resentments concerning Westminster abound. If, at some point in the
future, Scots choose the independence option the consequences for the
rest of the UK, and especially Northern Ireland, will be profound. For
example, will a dis-United Kingdom or a truncated Britain still be such
a focus for Ulster Protestant loyalty? This seems doubtful, given the
Scottish symbolism which adorns Loyalist imagery. Many feel that such a
development would accelerate the political rise of Ulster nationalism
and support for an independent Northern Ireland. Given the Irish
nationalist and Catholic hostility to this idea, and the divisions among
Protestants about its viability, an independent Ulster seems unlikely,
but the serious pursuit of it on the part of sufficient numbers would
have a convulsive effect on Northern Ireland society.
A Scottish breakaway would certainly place the Ulster Loyalists in a
dilemma, but the idea that they would be more disposed in this context
to negotiate a role for themselves in a new Ireland is at present
fanciful.
In any case a separate Scotland still seems a long way off.
Notwithstanding the robustly nationalist temper of Scottish politics
since the early 1980s, most Scots might still be persuaded to
acknowledge the attraction of a revamped Union if it is one in which
notions of English cultural and political dominance can be convincingly
dispelled. In bringing this about, the Scots and the Northern Irish
could pull impressively together: both peoples, from a range of
different political viewpoints, have felt marginalised, mistreated, and
misunderstood.
Among the reasons for the worsening of the Northern Ireland situation
over 25 years was the isolation to which the rest of the UK (and
Ireland) condemned the Province. The English were baffled and repelled
by what they saw as anachronistic religious hatreds. The Scots
instinctively grasped more of the essentials of the conflict. However,
largely as a defensive mechanism against similar troubles breaking out
in Scotland, Scots turned off; as the troubles wore on no distinctive
Scottish contribution to the Ulster debate was forthcoming.
At the time of the (significantly named) Anglo-Irish Agreement in
1985, Glasgow Labour MP Hugh Brown had the decency to admit as much in
the House of Commons. He said: ''I think that there should be a voice
from Scotland . . . Even in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the
Northern Ireland group, of which I have been a member for many years,
there are only a few members from Scotland who even take part in
discussions on Ireland.
''One of the things that we have to offer is that in Glasgow and the
West of Scotland we understand what a Billy and Dan situation is . . .
My contribution has some significance because in Glasgow and the West of
Scotland, even the media . . . accept that we have been muted in all the
previous deliberations on the subject.''
Brown might have added that the party to which he belonged, which had
enjoyed significant success in transcending sectarian divisions in
Scotland, refused to organise in Northern Ireland as an alternative to
the ''tribal politics'' of the Province. Encouragingly, Scottish Labour
MPs Calum MacDonald and George Foulkes have more recently been to the
fore in attempting to change this.
Questions of identity bind Scotland and Northern Ireland closer than
any other parts of the UK. There are positive and negative examples of
this: an Irish identity on the part of many people in Scotland and a
Scottish one in respect of many in Ulster; anti-Englishness in both
places. Cultural bonding occurs at all levels and often with ironic
results; when resident in the south of England I, along with an exiled
Belfast Catholic friend, once attempted to convince a group of English
friends that Ian Paisley has a good sense of humour. Even after we
recited some of the Big Man's one-liners they remained incredulous and
bemused.
Contemporary Scotland is impossible to understand without an
examination of the impact of Irish immigration, both Catholic and
Protestant, from the early nineteenth century. Instead of Olympian
hand-wringing, the Monklands affair should have alerted observers to the
way Irish issues helped to shape Scottish politics from the 1880s till
at least the 1960s.
It is not sufficiently appreciated, for example, that Catholic
community antagonism to Scottish home rule, out of fear that it would
become another Stormont, led the Labour Party, which depended on
Catholic support, in effect to drop the issue between the 1930s and
1970s. Nor is it much remembered how, conversely, anti-Irish Catholic
sentiments were identified with Scottish nationalism to a significant
degree in the 1930s and 40s.
The most powerful political force in Scotland till the 1960s, the
Unionists (Conservatives), fashioned their mass appeal out of opposition
to Irish Home Rule before the First World War, and on the basis of
Protestant religious and patriotic sentiment both Scottish and British
thereafter.
So intertwined is our history with Ulster especially that interacting
with Northern Ireland about the constitutional futures of both places
might be the only effective way Scotland has of addressing the issue of
its religious divisions and how they have shaped so much of the nation's
culture, and of ensuring that a culturally pluralist environment can be
created for the other ethnic groups in Scotland whose profile is
increasingly significant.
In terms of striving for the goals of pluralism, parity of esteem,
proper representation of different identities, and indeed power-sharing,
Scotland has much to learn from Northern Ireland. As the debate over
devolution and the form it might take revives, Scots might this time
round pay more attention to the one example of devolved government to
have taken place in the UK's history -- that of Northern Ireland between
1921 and 1972 -- if only to study the many contributory factors to its
eventual demise.
That devolution experiment was crippled by the monotony of one-party
rule and the predominance of one political issue: the constitutional
question. A devolved set-up for Scotland (on its own) may result in a
more even party political fight but there is surely a danger of it
revolving, as in Northern Ireland, around the one issue, in this case
devolution as a terminus or a pathway to full independence.
The political parties in Scotland have all had their reasons to
distance themselves from Northern Ireland and to keep constitutional
questions concerning both Scotland and Northern Ireland firmly apart.
But, increasingly, these questions do converge, as do debates on
identity, on the meaning of ''Britishness'', on matching political
opportunities with cultural diversity.
In my view a reformed Union along federal lines would best meet the
political and cultural demands of the UK. Unionism must demonstrate its
capacity to reform itself to accommodate nationalist and ethnic
diversity. In relation to Northern Ireland and Scotland, Unionism can
accommodate nationalism in a way in which the reverse is impossible.
A divided sense of identity -- Irish/British; Scottish/British -- can
be seen as a strength rather than a problem. Taking matters a stage
further I would endorse the idea of a UK federal republic which makes
me, I suppose, a Republican Unionist. The monarchy is inescapably a
symbol of an outdated and narrow sense of British identity.
Such an overhauled UK would, I believe, lead Northern Ireland
Catholics to participate positively in the affairs of the State without
feeling their Irish nationalist identity diminished. This would be even
likelier given a meaningful all-Irish dimension to Northern Ireland
affairs and increased interaction generally between the two islands.
Northern Ireland Protestants would have to accept that the price of
remaining in the Union would be the loss of an idea of Britishness which
is exclusively Protestant. Yet the security of the Union should also
lead many of them to rediscover the radical dissenting traditions of
their ancestors and to lead the way in restoring Protestantism as a
vital, positive, liberating creed. Above all else the Ulster Protestants
need to be given a way to argue a positive case for the Union which
liberates them from the ''Not-an-Inch'' mentality of their past.
Unionists can ''persuade'' for the Union instead of being ''persuaded''
that there is an ''inevitability'' about a united Ireland. They will
only effectively counter Irish Nationalism by proving themselves genuine
reformers and discarding the dead weight of the right-wing Conservative
allegiance of most of their parliamentary representatives.
As for Scotland, a reformed Union could still offer scope for the
energies of the ''civic'' strand of nationalism while nullifying the
dark currents of ''ethnic'' nationalism recently expressed by groups
such as Settler Watch.
In short, Scotland and Northern Ireland are at the heart of
contemporary constitutional debate in the UK. They should help each
other to steer that debate in a mutually beneficial direction and to
ensure that the Union truly reflects national, cultural, and regional
diversity. Their interests both lie in comprehensive, all-inclusive
constitutional reform.

AN odd, slightly smug aroma hangs over Simon Gray's new play Cell
Mates -- a distinctly awkward, stuttering, though not entirely
ungripping exploration of what has become an all too easy target, the
misconceived belief in communism.
Springing from the same fertile ground -- national betrayal -- from
which Alan Bennett forged Single Spies and A Question of Attribution
(though handled far less incisively), Gray explores the relationship
between KGM agent and English (in fact part Egyption part Dutch)
''traitor'' George Blake and the man who helped him escape from Wormwood
Scrubs and thence to Moscow -- humble house thief and aspiring Dublin
novelist Sean Bourke.
Giving it a slightly homo-erotic twist (never fully developed), Gray's
not wholly convincing psychological thriller (far more red herrings to
the square inch than is really good for it) is in one sense an exercise
in those small, inner betrayals of the human heart that grow into
institutionalised abuse. A vast picture of Lenin in this, Gray's own
production, flashes alongside Stephen Fry's urbane Blake, the two allied
by the common belief that they were working towards ''making a better
world''.
On another level, however, it appears to be a story of emotional
duplicity rooted in something far more petty and selfish -- artistic
rivalry. Blake and Rik Mayall's weasel-like Bourke both have a story to
tell. Blake, once having drawn Bourke to Moscow for a week, pulls every
ruse available to keep him there.
Fry is, well, as Fry always is -- Mayall, more animated, if with a
slightly wayward Irish accent. But then cultural identity --
particularly Irish and Russian -- is certainly up for grabs (and jokes)
on this occasion. All in all, a queer fish.

NATION shall speak peace unto nation, says the old motto of the BBC;
but in the radio world of the 1990s, it's more a matter of the nation
talking cut-price drivel to itself, 24 hours a day. This week -- St
Valentine's Day, to be precise -- saw the launch of Talk Radio UK,
Britain's first all-speech national commercial station; and on the basis
of what I've heard so far, there are just three observations worth
making.
The first is that despite all the advance publicity about
''shock-jocks'' and rude radio, most of Talk Radio UK is blandness
personified, cosy, soft-edged, and deeply familiar; it's like London's
LBC in its slacker moments, Virgin 1215 without the music, every
lightweight local radio phone-in you ever heard.
The second is that its chosen name is a laughable misnomer. This is
not so much ''Talk Radio UK'' as Talk Radio Sarf London, with every
presenter I have heard so far representing some variation on the uniform
twang of fashionable London-media cockney; and the handling of issues
demonstrates the same total absorption in the street culture and
perspectives of London and its immediate hinterland. People chunter
obsessively about the problems of English football, about Millwall (or
Miw-waw, as it comes out in estuary-speak) and the Arsenal; fair enough,
but nuffink to do, as it were, with Talk Radio for the UK.
And the third is that most of the chat I've heard so far has been no
good at all; pure radio mince, inarticulate, unoriginal, ill-informed,
and aimless. Some of the presenters -- with the honourable exception of
the agony aunt Anna Raeburn, whose sensible, knowledgeable early
afternoon show is a shade too high-powered and coherent to fit
comfortably into this context -- seem to have serious problems with the
English language, stumbling over the simplest expressions of ideas.
Few seem to have any idea how to structure a conversation, to give it
a bit of energy and point.
TOMMY BOYD, for instance -- launching his late afternoon show about
''real people, real lives, and Real Madrid'' -- interviewed a man from
William Hill the bookmaker at such meandering length that I began to
have that sinking Jean-Paul Sartre feeling of being stuck in a situation
that had no reason ever to end. And most are adopting the standard
modern-commercial-radio trick of pretending to be much dimmer than they
are, apologising or adding audible quotation marks every time they use a
word of more than two syllables, and conscientiously limiting their
vocabulary to what they imagine the audience will find familiar and
unpretentious.
Of course, it's a tragedy for us all that we live in a society so
divided and insecure that millions apparently feel alienated by displays
of articulacy in their own language. But unless Talk Radio UK gives
itself a much firmer mission to change that situation, instead of
reflecting the reactionary idea that intelligent talk is the preserve of
an elite, it could indeed find itself drifting, under sheer commercial
pressure, towards the shock-jock style of attention-grabbing hate-radio
that now dominates in the United States. Nature abhors a moral vacuum;
and airwaves full of empty talk either turn themselves towards good
ends, or risk being turned towards evil ones.
I wonder, incidentally, what the opposite of a shock-jock is?
Something, I suppose, like Jimmie Macgregor, the well-loved woolly
cardigan of Scottish broadcasting, civil to everyone, generous and
liberal in his attitudes, and angry only when confronted with serious
nastiness. This last couple of weeks, though, Jimmie has been up to
something odd on Radio Scotland. In fact in presenting what should have
been a straightforward little series on urban wildlife, called Natural
Neighbours, he seems to have invented a whole new programme format, in
which the normal radio order of things is reversed and the presenter,
instead of interviewing someone who knows more about the subject than he
does, spends half-an-hour lecturing a companion who clearly knows much
less.
Thus Jimmie stands beside a pond in Drumpellier Park, Coatbridge, or
beside the Kelvin in Glasgow, and asks his companion, ''Have you heard
of such-and-such a bird?'' This hapless straight man -- or woman -- then
answers ''No''; whereupon Jimmie holds forth fluently for some minutes
on the feathered friend in question.
To say that this format does not work is an understatement; the effect
is excruciating, reducing every word Jimmie speaks -- no matter how
interesting in itself -- to the status of an embarrassing harangue
inflicted on a captive audience. Still, never let it be said that Radio
Scotland is not doing its bit to challenge radio conventions.

IF talking tree Arnold Schwarzenegger really does have serious
ambitions of following Ronald Reagan as the second worst actor ever to
be President of the US, Couch Potato's advice would be to hurry up about
it before the paying public changes his second name to Who? Not that
James Cameron's all-action secret-agent adventure yarn True Lies
(rental, cert PG) is a duff picture, at least not when compared with
Junior or The Last Action Hero, but with every new release it becomes
clearer that Arnie will never star in, nor Cameron direct, another film
as funny, exciting, or stylish as Terminator 2.
The same thing is happening to Schwarzenegger's films as happened to
the James Bond series in the 1970s: a slide into nudge-and-wink
self-parody that destroys the audience's suspension of disbelief and
doesn't even make you laugh. Nobody goes to an Arnie movie expecting
art, insight, or food for thought, but we'd like to be allowed to lose
ourselves in it without being reminded every five minutes that it's only
a (very silly) movie.
Talking of the Bond films, True Lies actually kicks off with a direct
visual quotation from You Only Live Twice as our hero, having just left
an underwater bomb under some unspecified enemies of democracy, steps
out of his diving suit to reveal a white tux and full dinner-party rig
in which to attend a formal diplomatic engagement somewhere in Europe.
It's not all fun having a licence to kill: your diary can get really
crowded.
After that, two strands weave in and out of the narrative: the first
is a story about the fact that Arnie's wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) doesn't
know he's a secret agent; she thinks he sells computers for a living.
This leads to the best line in the movie when, finally enlightened about
hubby's day job, she asks him ''You mean you've killed people?'' and
Arnie stolidly replies: ''They were all bad people.''
Second strand and major storyline is a fairly routine
counter-terrorism plot with the usual cast of anonymous Arab baddies,
enlivened only by a wildly over-the-top performance from Art Malik as
chief baddie and -- now we're getting to the whole point of the movie --
lots of spectacular and expensive stunt work, featuring Harrier jump-jet
fighters, an exploding bridge, helicopters, and general derring-do.
Motivations are supplied by the terrorists' possession of a nuclear bomb
and, worse still, of Arnie's daughter. They shouldn't have made him
angry . . .
True Lies, despite its irritating cuteness, racism, and a general air
of being far too pleased with itself, does pass the time quite
pleasantly; but then, as the guy says in Waiting for Godot, it would
have passed anyway.
Just when British comedy seemed to be doing quite nicely for once,
with a string of high-class recent funnies including Leon The Pig
Farmer, Four Weddings And A Funeral, and Year Of The Pig, along comes a
film like Deadly Advice (retail, #15.99, cert 15) to bring us all back
to normal. Despite a script by Glenn Chandler of Taggart fame and
Blackadder director Mandie Fletcher at the helm, not to mention a classy
cast list (Jane Horrocks, Brenda Fricker, Imelda Staunton, Jonathan
Pryce, and cameo parts for Billie Whitelaw, Hywel Bennett, and John
Mills), this ill-judged and frankly rather nasty black comedy dies more
deaths than the five Great British Murderers who feature so prominently
in the storyline ever accounted for between them.
We're in the idyllically pretty kind of English country town
(Hay-on-Wye, actually) where so many people get themselves knocked off
in Agatha Christie novels, and here live sisters Jane Horrocks and
Imelda Staunton, simmering away with lust and rage in the house of their
Mother From Hell, Brenda Fricker. One day Jane, already nursing
homicidal ideas about her mum, borrows a book about famous murderers
from the library and the film takes off into fantasy as its principal
characters -- Dr Crippen, Jack the Ripper, George ''Brides in the Bath''
Smith etc -- take on a real existence as Jane's Deadly Advisers in the
delicate matter of family murder.
More sensitively handled, this clever and original gimmick could have
been the centre of a good movie, but Deadly Advice never creates the
sympathy for its principal villainess that is necessary to stop this
kind of picture toppling into bad taste, and all we feel is a certain
itchy moral discomfort. It's not without its quota of ludicrous laughs,
but it lacks heart and wastes several good performances on a story that
is little more than an extended sick joke. On the other hand, it does at
least have the virtue that at 80 minutes, its time -- like the heroine's
mother's -- is short.

While the rest of the cast of EastEnders have been celebrating the TV
soap's tenth anniversary, Caroline Paterson has been turning her talents
to Wasted, a new production of which will be staged in her native
Glasgow this month. She talks here to Sara Villiers
FROM southsider to EastEnder, Caroline Paterson has made the journey
from minding the stage door at the Citizens' Theatre to residency in
Albert Square. She has forsaken her beloved Glasgow for a sojourn in
London, to play Ruth, the Glaswegian girlfriend of Mark Fowler, in the
BBC's ratings-busting soap.
At a cappuccino bar in Soho which, with its Formica counters and
clusters of old Italians, is so defiantly unfashionable it has to be the
hippest joint in town, Paterson, 29, shows up, bubbling with excitement.
''Sorry I'm late,'' she apologises. ''It was unbelievable. Michael Aspel
appeared on set to do a This Is Your Life on Ethel. Todd Carty (Mark
Fowler) ran up and told me five minutes before it happened. I was so
excited I had to go over to Michael Aspel and shake his hand and tell
him I used to fancy him when he did Ask Aspel.''
Heads swivel slightly but people would be hard put to equate the glam
chick dressed in black leather from head to toe -- cap, jacket,
trousers, and boots -- with the dowdier Ruth. All the same, Paterson is
getting used to being clocked on the street by punters, particularly in
her home town. ''They say -- 'you're Mark's bird, aren't you?' And they
come up and shake my hand and say that it's great to see a Scottish
person in Albert Square. It's like I've won the Second World War or
something.''
She has certainly won the fight to present her Pollok tones
unmodulated on screen. ''At first I kept getting hesitant hints about my
'diction' and I just told them flat, look, Ruth is a Scot and this is
how we talk.''
It is easy to imagine Paterson coming up trumps in any argument; she
is affable and funny but clearly possesses a fiesty determination, as
evinced in a career which has seen her step on to the stage with no
previous drama training, help establish an innovative drama company,
Raindog, play Lady Macbeth at the Citizens', and win praise as a
director for her productions of Still Life, an ingenious distillation of
John Byrne's Slab Boys trilogy, and last year's Wasted, Raindog's
devised exploration of a demi-monde world of prostitutes and junkies.
She is, however, pragmatic about the fact that the public know her
face through her television work, from brief appearances on shows like
Rab C Nesbitt to the drama series Cardiac Arrest and Making Waves --
minor roles now overshadowed by the prime-time Ruth. Ironically, while
Paterson has invariably played downbeat females like the put-upon wife
of a corrupt cop in A Touch of Frost, the character of Ruth is the
dramatic equivalent of a breath of fresh air in the dank, depressed
environs of EastEnders.
While Michelle mopes, Pauline moans, and Mark succumbs to another
anxiety attack, Ruth grins cheerily and in a
let's-look-on-the-bright-side kind of way chucks a bottle of vino into
Michelle's tasteless stew and, puffing on a fag at the creche where she
works, laughingly advises fussy mum Geeta to chill out.
''I reckon I'm always smiling because I feel so incredulous that I'm
there at all,'' Paterson admits. ''I watched EastEnders when I was
unemployed and my friends just can't believe that I'm now standing there
in the Queen Vic. I like the fact that they haven't portrayed me as a
drunk, aggressive Glaswegian, and even when there are heavy scenes I
have been determined to keep it light.''
The light entertainment aspect is in stark contrast to the work which
has kept Paterson busy while the rest of the EastEnders cast have been
celebrating the soap's tenth anniversary: a new production of Wasted,
which opens at the Tron in Glasgow later this month. For the past few
weeks she has been flying up and down to Glasgow where she has been
directing rehearsals of the play, which was first seen at the Arches
Theatre last year.
Cataloguing a culture of black economy-types who have become
disenfranchised, either through necessity or choice, the work has been
acclaimed for its emotional power and its inventive use of technology,
utilising camcorders and video monitors to extend the theatrical
dialogue.
The production at the Tron will take that process a stage further.
''It's set in an old cinema and we're using a huge screen,'' explains
Paterson. ''We are going to use a lot of images and deal with stuff to
do with pornography and blue movies.''
The cinematic allusions and video images have prompted rumours that
last year's performance was a precursor to Raindog moving into film and
she admits that she would love to see Wasted filmed. Having straddled
the mediums of television and theatre throughout her career -- with one
day's television work often not only keeping the rent man at bay but
also facilitating Raindog projects -- she is rightly impatient with a
prevalent theatrical snootiness about televison work. ''Why not do
both?'' she demands. David Hayman, an early mentor in Paterson's career,
has certainly proven it is possible.
The company is currently in negotiations with BBC Scotland, which has
had its plans for a dramatisation of Jeff Torrington's Swing Hammer
Swing! shelved by London and been told to invest in more contemporaneous
drama. Wasted fulfills that brief. The Scottish Arts Council, which gave
Raindog a generous grant for a second production, was impressed that the
company pulled in young, typically theatre-resilient audiences to Wasted
last year.
''They phoned and asked how we got that audience,'' she says. ''Well
we went looking for them. We got people to go out and put leaflets in
clubs and pubs; we canvassed for that audience and it worked.''
She despairs that there is practically no theatre for young people, a
problem -- worrying for the future -- which she believes is exacerbated
by attitudes at the RSAMD in Glasgow. ''The students kept writing to us
asking for some work-experience so I wrote to the drama department and
said we could come in and do a workshop or get the students involved in
one of our productions, but I didn't even get a reply. Nothing. Not a
word.''
Having learned her craft through trial and error, she is exasperated
by this response. ''I hate seeing 17-year-olds with powdered wigs on
playing Chekov. I keep meeting young graduates who say all they ever got
to do was play old women. Why aren't they doing things relating to the
students' own age? That's what they'll be doing when they come out. The
place stinks. They don't open their doors to what is actually going on
out there.''
Her tirade is interrupted by the waiter who has flirted with her
throughout our meal, asking if she has enjoyed her food. ''I'm going to
have to flash at you,'' she tells him mock-gravely, popping open the
button of her leather jeans in a gesture of appreciation.
It's a down-to-earth gesture which is typical of her forthright style.
I tell her that the EastEnders publicity office had phoned me to ask if
I was doing an expose on her. ''Expose,'' she hoots with laughter.
''There's nothing about me worth exposing.'' Except her bellybutton of
course.

SHAKESPEARE with music? Music with Shakespeare? Like all Purcell's
stage pieces, The Fairy Queen is neither one thing nor another.
But as a piece of jumbled genius, and in a good performance,it is
blissfully entertaining, as the Scottish Chamber Orchestra's
tercentenary presentation of it confirmed last night.
The music was, of course, composed for an adaptation of A Midsummer
Night's Dream ''after the manner of an opera''.
It is no opera, but in this bright, skilful new adaptation by John
Abulafia and Nicholas Kraemer, with four solo singers, four actors, a
small chorus and orchestra, it provided a long, rich and copious
evening.
True, a concert hall was hardly the right place for it, and the work's
Purcellian magic had mostly to be simulated.
But the effort, and the clever infiltration of Shakespeare's words,
proved worth while. Given the hybrid nature of the piece, the spoken
text did sometimes form too lengthy an intrusion, and sometimes --
particularly after so beautiful an account of ''O let me ever weep'' --
it broke the spell of Purcell's glorious music.
But the acting (by Tara Shaw, Moira Young, Vincenzo Nicoli, and Simon
Roberts) involved such a hilarious doubling of parts, and the singing
(by Catherine Bott, Catherine Pierard, Michael Chance, and David Thomas)
had such style and sweetness that the sides did in the end seem quite
evenly matched.
Chance and Thomas brought marvellous relish to the Corida and Mopsa
burlesque. Kraemer drew a seductive and intelligent mix of authenticity
and practicality from the SCO, with spirited trumpet tone, warbling
recorders, and shapely strings.

BY nature we are a polite people, sometimes too polite. How many of us
are not sick of excuses being made for the ''under-privileged'' who beat
up old ladies for their pensions, run down innocent pedestrians when
they steal cars -- not joyride -- or seek to overturn the law by forming
vociferous pressure groups?
For it seems, far too often, that we are expected to apologise for
perceived crimes, the sin of admission.
How many thousands of words have been written about Dresden in the
past few days? One had to be fortunate to find balance, the admission
that there are two sides to every coin. John Linklater wrote in these
pages that ''Britain should end the long deception and admit that the
city's destruction was more a show of power than a strategic
imperative''. Deception?
Have we forgotten that there was a war on? Or that Hitler bombed the
civilians of Coventry, Clydebank, London, Rotterdam, and a thousand
towns and cities across Europe?
Have we forgotten that for five years the brave volunteers of Bomber
Command were our only means of striking back at the Nazis who occupied
Europe, and at their heartland?
While Britain and the Commonwealth and the Americans prepared for the
invasion, night after night the bombers went out. Should the
preparations for the day of reckoning have been confined to huddling by
the home fires, benefiting from powdered eggs brought across the
Atlantic by our brave merchant navy because remembering that civilians
are killed by bombs would cost us the ''moral ascendancy''?
Dresden was a joint action between British and American bombers, us by
night and the US Eighth Air Force by day. Do the Americans bare their
souls, wear sackcloth and ashes, and beat themselves publicly with birch
twigs over their part?
Harris did not order the raids. He long dreamed of demoralising the
Nazis by targeting Berlin. Again, and again, and again.
Churchill gave the order. The Prime Minister did not send out the
Americans. They supported the attacks and played a major part in them.
Perhaps our memories are too short or newspaper columnists need to
keep finding different perspectives. War is foul. War is all hell. But
when it begins, you have to win or lose.
All bombing of the innocents is a crime against humanity. It began
when the first grenade was dropped over the side of a
string-and-sealing-wax biplane. It will not end with apologies, priests,
and ministers journeying to Dresden, or to Hiroshima or Nagasaki. No
journalist deciding that those raids of February 13-15, 1945, ''must be
seen as a demonstration of the destructive capabilities of the Western
Allies in anticipation of the cold war'' will change anything.
Sherman said it: ''War is all hell.'' The Americans preserved the
Enola Gay, which dropped the first A-bomb. The military calculated that
if the weapon had not been used, as many as a million lives might have
been lost in the hand-to-hand fighting necessary to take Japan. We
rewarded Bomber Command by refusing to strike a medal to mark their
contribution to winning the war.
Let us feel regret, of course, that a single civilian died in that
war, and not forget each and every soldier, sailor, and airman as well,
but far from being apologetic half a century late, we should be ashamed
that the bones of those who made the decisions, and those who carried
them out, are being raked over.
We have survived 50 years of peace by adhering to a policy of
deterrence. That's another word for promising that our bomb is bigger
than theirs. The threat worked.
Praise God that it was never necessary to make the point.
Where will it end . . . the English saying sorry to the Scots for
Culloden? Or shall we go back further, and pillory the Bruce for
Bannockburn?
Today a different Germany leads a unified new Europe. As John
Linklater said, the politics that wasted Dresden are an ugly
anachronism, like those of 1746, 1314, 1066, and as far back in time as
we care to travel.
Let us stop talking about hidden political objectives, and allegations
that Britain has been lying for 50 years in a ''deception justified by
cant and hypocrisy'', as John Linklater summed up.
Instead we should leave in peace the memory of those who did their
best for us, as they believed at the time, as part of the six years of
sacrifice which enabled you to read your Herald this morning.
That we should take so long to admit this is our real shame.

I WAS surprised and disappointed by the report ''SNP takes a beating
for Devil's Island study trip'', referring to a visit to my country, or
more accurately our part of the European Union (February 8).
I was disappointed at two errors of fact. It was not 19 but nine MEPs
who came to Cayenne, and they were led not by Bernard Tapie but by the
president of the European Radical Alliance, Mrs Catherine Lalumiere.
I was surprised at the attitude of the British Labour Party spokesman
who attacked my colleagues for ''wasting taxpayers' money'' by coming to
French Guyana at my invitation. There were two good reasons for them to
come here.
The first is that this was a regular monthly group meeting to prepare
for the Strasbourg plenary session next week. Twice a year every group
meets somewhere in the European Union other than Brussels or Strasbourg.
Next month, for instance, the 200-strong Socialist Group is meeting in
Barcelona.
Cayenne is not in fact the most expensive location to meet in, and was
officially authorised by the conference group president of the
Parliament.
The other reason is that we are very much affected by Europe, but it
is very difficult for MEPs to appreciate our problems unless they set
foot here. I am glad that my SNP colleagues accepted the invitation to
come to Guyana, along with Canarian and French members. This went down
extremely well among the Guyanese, most of whom had never met any MEP
apart from myself.
What really astounds me is the attitude of the British Labour Party.
Does socialist solidarity extend only as far as Barcelona but not as far
as the peripheral and deprived areas of the European Union?
It is not our fault that French Guyana is classified as an integral
part of France and therefore of the European Union -- and we pay the
same taxes as the metropolitan French. Have the European socialists no
interest in coming to see how the other half lives?

ALF YOUNG'S carefully reasoned article on executive pay hits the mark.
The defence that ''it is the going rate for the job'' seems ludicrous.
If before privatisation someone's talents attract a moderate salary
and they believe they are underpaid, then they can seek another position
with a fairer salary. The decision by the Government to privatise their
organisation cannot possibly make their services many times more
valuable.
On the other hand individuals who take on the top job in an existing
company (risking their own reputation, career, or cash) and succeed in
turning it around deserve to be rewarded with a good salary and to
benefit from the increase in the value of the company through share
options.

TO be sure the bombing of Dresden just remembered was ''pour
encourager les autres'' -- to suggest, as John Linklater does, that it
was done in order to impress our Soviet quasi-allies is at best a canard
(February 13).
For most Servicemen involved in total war the taking out of Dresden
was simply another task that was deemed had to be carried out and it is
not for someone with myopic hindsight not prosecuting the war 50 years
on to pass judgment.
John Linklater seems to write knowledgably -- but what was his role in
the Second World War, or has he simply read about it in books? For sure
John Linklater has a guilt complex and to that extent I'm sorry for him,
because to feel obliged to take responsibility for something in which he
had no hand must be soul-destroying.
In his agonising over the brutal shortcomings of his fellow countrymen
he has been in noted company, for did not Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw), Philby,
Burgess, Maclean, Blunt among others seek to shrive their souls by
selling their country short for about 30 pieces of silver or whatever is
The Herald's going rate?
What Sir Winston Churchill said at the time was in effect true for
every Briton true to his/her salt -- that no German city was worth the
life of a single British Serviceman, a sentiment that most German
Servicemen would echo with situations reversed. It is a pity it had to
happen to Dresden but let the responsibility and guilt rest where they
belong.

JOHN MACLEOD makes a fundamental error when he states that Tony
Blair's proposals for tax relief on childcare costs give women a ''tax
break''. Any proposals to help fund childcare costs benefit all parents
and not just women (February 14).
They should not benefit the better off unduly either, as the cost of
such a scheme could easily be recouped through the income tax system and
thus the burden of childcare costs would be shared with the childless.
Such a policy recognises that raising the next generation is the
responsibility of us all.
Again he misses the point when he argues that children are better off
spending the day with their mothers. He would have us believe there was
once a golden age when married women did not go out to work and spent
their days in idyllic bliss with their pre-school offspring. In fact
working-class women have traditionally worked for pay, whether taking
work home or taking their children along with them or leaving them with
relatives.
Many of those who do so today do the ''double shift'' -- that is, they
go out to work in the evenings when their husbands have returned home,
all because they cannot afford the costs of childcare.
The women John Macleod knows are surely very privileged to be able to
take years out of work. But what is most pernicious in his article is
the argument that allowing young children to spend lengthy periods with
people other than their mothers will cause them psychological damage.
For his sweeping remarks he offers no evidence whatsoever.
Lastly John Macleod has completely ignored the issue of single
parents. Anyone's relationship may break down and even women -- and men
-- who are at present in apparently stable relationships may one day
find themselves the sole providers for their children. They have a right
to work as much as any childless person.
John Macleod refuses to consider any unit apart from the nuclear
family as one suitable for rearing children but in the 1990s it is folly
to look on parents as anything other than individual people.

BEFORE the last General Election I was contacted by the Labour Party's
central office in London and asked to take part in an event where arts
and entertainment figures were to give vocal and public support to the
party's attempt to wrest power from the Tories.
The gathering has subsequently been referred to as Luvvies for Labour.
Since I was not a party member I was a little surprised by this approach
but only too happy to add whatever weight I could to the organisation
most likely to reverse the series of injustices and inequalities so
fastidiously assembled in our society since 1979.
Because of a number of developments -- Neil Kinnock's determination to
defeat the sectarian class warriors in the party, John Smith's
inspirational Christian socialism, and the clearest indications yet from
the Blair/Prescott leadership of the party's competence to bring about a
practical implementation of the principles of justice and social equity
-- I have decided to join the party.
However, following your disturbing report by Stephen Fraser (February
13) of attempts by the Scottish Labour Party executive to stifle the
freedom of speech of individuals and groups concerned about ethical
questions relating to abortion, I have decided to make a simultaneous
approach to Labour for Life.
It is imperative that the principal left-of-centre party practises the
democracy it preaches. There are thousands of women and men of
left-of-centre persuasion who are perturbed by the moral and social
implications of the holocaust of the unborn.
The Labour Party should not alienate them and should feel confident
enough of its own traditions of tolerance and pluralism to accommodate
as wide and continuous a debate as possible.

FOR Jimmy Reid to pour scorn on Tony Blair and to say he's ''further
to the right than Edward Heath'' is really nonsense (February 6). What
Jimmy Reid and his chattering classes cannot accept is that the ordinary
Labour member voted as I did to elect Tony Blair as leader of the Labour
Party.
I would remind Jimmy Reid of the quote recently by Tony Blair:
''Social justice is about an alliance of the poor and the comfortable
attacking vested interest which holds all of us back in dealing with
poverty at the bottom and greed and excess at the top.''
That is what the Labour Party is talking about; that is what the
leader is taking us to tackle.
Unfortunately we now watch a so-called socialist spend his time
attacking the Labour Party when he should have learned by now he should
take any of his skills in journalism and spend them attacking the people
who are causing misery and hardship in this country and leave a
political party which does not need his help or assistance to get on
with the main job of altering society and putting the interests of
ordinary men and women to the forefront of the agenda.

I WAS dismayed to read that Julie Davidson's TV column last Saturday
was her last crit for The Herald.
Her weekly television analysis gave me the same pleasure I get
discussing TV with close friends. Her insight into the background of
productions and writers was informative and added to the viewing.
I agreed with her on many things, but even the disagreeing was
enjoyable. I now look forward to a similar relationship with Ian Bell

THE cost of restoring the Maid of the Loch to serviceable condition is
not justifiable for several reasons, not least of which is her size.
Potential passengers would require to reach the main terminal at
Balloch by car or coach. This pier and the one at Tarbet are already
served by well established ''water-bus'' type vessels marketed in
conjunction with coach tours.
For longer cruises, and a pier-to-pier service, a smaller ship like
the Countess Fiona would seem more appropriate.

JOYCE McMILLAN is always a delight to read and maintains a high
standard in radio criticism. However, she does not do justice to Radio
4's discrimination in its Book at Bedtime choice of Lawrence Whistler's
The Initials in the Heart.
As she suggests, it was a book of its time (1939-45), but when first
published in 1964 it was acclaimed as a classic for the beauty of its
prose, this being only one of its merits.
Maintaining a high standard is always a battle; it behoves all of us
to keep this, at least, in view.
Ronald Pickup's reading of the book did nothing to discourage us.

THE long closure of the Argyle Line in Glasgow has had some service
effects which, if it is to last to October, may be ameliorated by
further adjustment in service patterns, and additionally offers an
opportunity to improve the system without the constraint of trains and
passengers, which Strathclyde to its credit is seizing.
Might I suggest a couple of further ideas. First, run a shuttle train
on one track between Rutherglen and Bridgeton which could connect with a
service onwards from Rutherglen for the duration of the closure. This
could probably operate with a very basic signalling system on a
30-minute round trip to fit with other services.
Secondly, investigate the possible use of the existing undercroft and
its extension (sideways) to provide a link from Central Low Level to
either St Enoch subway or a basement/street location in Buchanan Street
along the lines of the Queen Street/Buchanan Street link.
Any materials dug out would be ferried out by rail with the flood
debris. Would a major store or arcade fund this if the new station entry
was through or past its basement?

half the story (February 17).
The Record did have a heading ''Our shame'' on Thursday's front page
about the football riot in Dublin. But this, of course, was linked to
another headline which attributed this comment to Jack Charlton.
The intro on the story reinforced this.

THE Islwyn by-election delivered its predictable outcome in
yesterday's small hours. Labour was always sure to be returned and the
Tories were always going to be crushed, but that the gap between them
would be so great is another index of the disaster the Tories continue
to court with their divisions over Europe. In previous by-elections
where an incumbent has precipitated the event by resigning for an
appointment in Brussels, a marked degree of local resentment has
manifested itself. That did not occur this time: Labour's share of a
reduced poll did fall, but by a negligible amount; whereas the Tory vote
slumped so disastrously that their candidate lost his deposit. Tories
may never hope for too much from the Welsh valleys, but the
psychological blow inflicted is inescapable. The one Labour doubt, that
the Welsh nationalists might do exceptionally well, was safely brushed
aside. On this showing Plaid Cymru is no threat to Labour's grip on
South Wales, where most of the principality's parliamentary seats are
concentrated.
The Prime Minister will be able to say to his colleagues: ''I told you
so.'' He has indeed been telling them to stop indulging in internecine
warfare: they seem unable to do so. It has almost come to the point that
any sort of utterance on Europe sows new seeds of dissension which
germinate and sprout at once. Even when the Chancellor merely states the
official policy of the Government his remarks are at once described as
unhelpful by a (junior) Cabinet colleague.
Mr Clarke is a remarkably resilient politician. He may see himself as
the man to whom his party will turn when its divisions produce the sort
of outcome nationally that Islwyn presaged yesterday. He will at least
be the man of the pro-European majority if electoral defeat ensures Mr
Major's removal. Privately, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor may
still see eye to eye on the EU, but Mr Major has to try to bind up the
wounds imposed by internal strife and of course Mr Clarke does not need
to pursue such a healing role. He might, all the same, be wiser to try
to do so. If his ambition becomes too naked, a defeated party two years
from now might reject him (as it more recently rejected Mr Heseltine) as
being unworthy of its collective trust.
The possible escape route for Mr Major -- and the large segment of
Tory MPs who, on present trends, could sink as deep as the Titanic -- is
to promote a referendum on a single currency should that vehicle
actually be proposed. It remains a hypothetical matter (though Mr
Clarke's view of its consequences if adopted seems strange). The
referendum is now being pressed by Sir Norman Fowler. It might suspend
the civil war, and even give the Tories the chance to recover, just as
they did between 1979 and 1983 when their fortunes also slumped hugely
between General Elections.

THERE are no certainties left in railway privatisation and precious
few probabilities. What there are in abundance are questions, none of
which has been graced yet by an answer. Mr Chris Green, perhaps the only
person capable of bringing sense to Scotland's railway system, has left
in disgust. Mr Green loves history, hence his new job as chief of
English Heritage. Everything we know about him suggests he loves
railways even more. The suspicion persists that his departure from
ScotRail amounts to constructive dismissal in that it became impossible
for a man of common sense and flair to continue in a position bound
round by ideology, hypocrisy, and mismanagement and in which he was
ultimately banned from giving his thoughts publicly. Commiserations
should also be extended to Mr John Ellis, who has moved to ScotRail from
Railtrack. With no slight to Mr Ellis, his appointment is a political
convenience and an organisational disgrace as he moves from a senior
position with the providers of track to the head of the body purchasing
track. In the world of real, grown-up business this would not have been
tolerated.
Nevertheless, Mr Ellis is now the man who must answer the questions.
He should begin by explaining if and how the rail services currently
funded by the Strathclyde Passenger Executive will survive
privatisation. There is some urgency about this question. Two-thirds of
ScotRail passengers are carried on Strathclyde PTE, which pays ScotRail
an annual subsidy of #112m (more than a third of ScotRail's income) to
run the services in the greater Glasgow area. Strathclyde receives most
of the money for the subsidy from the Government but the current
arrangement is only guaranteed for the next financial year. Then there
is the problem that Strathclyde region will disappear in April, 1996, to
be replaced by 12 unitary authorities. Will these authorities pay the
subsidy, or any subsidy? Will they even receive money from Government
for the subsidy?
Mr Ellis might also address the question of Mr Green's despairing
insistence that proper Government financial support for ScotRail must be
established if the service (to use an old-fashioned but resonant word)
is to be maintained at anything near its present level. Mr Green said
that the cuts in his budget of at least 5% from April would result in
the loss of 600 jobs with fewer trains and higher fares. Does Mr Ellis
agree with this? If not, what is his interpretation? It would also be
interesting, as he is a former director of Railtrack, to hear his views
on how that organisation can survive. The train operators can only lease
track if the Treasury gives the franchise director enough money to give
the operators to pay Railtrack. If this sounds crazy, rest assured it
is, but it is the system we must live with. Yet the cuts in subsidy mean
that the operators will be able to lease less track, making Railtrack 's
future doubtful. Would any sensible investor buy into this shambles? It
would be better to draw a veil over any questions on the timetable to
privatisation, for if we must suffer ghost trains in the future it is at
least logical that they have been preceded by a ghost timetable. Mr
Ellis will feel he has been unfairly treated in all this. These are
questions for the Government, he will say. That is true, but they are
also questions he must address, and publicly. Mr Green felt he could not
do this to his own satisfaction; if Mr Ellis comes to share his feelings
(and if he does not, he must tell us why not) he too must go.

* THERE'S a costume exhibition in Dundee called Second Skin. But don't
get too excited. First-year students of Duncan of Jordanstone Art
College were given two weeks to produce a piece of work which would
''bring together the elements of two and three-dimensional design''. In
other words, a piece of clothing.
The students drew upon fiction, the military, achitecture and music.
However, we have it on authority that some of the 120 pieces are
''eminently wearable''.
Fiona Duckett, 38, a student at the art college talked about her
contribution. She delved into the folklore of snakes. Her work is called
Cobra. ''The headpiece is made from wire and tissue paper. I really like
colour so it's covered with Harlequin material. The body is in padded
lycra with a tail''.
None of the garments is for sale. Students, however, do not have to
cover their production costs.
''I spent #15 in materials and used old electricity wire from a
skip,'' explains Fiona. ''There was a lot of recycling and re-using of
what people would term as rubbish''.
* Second Skin runs until March 10 in the Level 5 Exhibition area at
Jordanstone College.

It was a triangle that ended with a tragic walk in the woods,
and its small-screen dramatisation, showing on Monday,
proves truth can be more compulsive viewing than fiction
IT would be stretching the imagination to describe Kate Hardie as
classically beautiful. Indeed, there is a distinct possibility that she
looks a little like her father. The problem is that no one really knows
what her father, the former Goodie turned bird-watcher Bill Oddie, looks
like underneath his heavy-duty beard.
But there is an undeniable coquettish charm about razor-haired Hardie,
a combination of innocence and mischief in her face. She appears
vulnerable, impressionable, gullible. She seems to have the word
''victim'' stamped across her forehead.
In her relatively short screen career to date, the 27-year-old actress
has played an abused homeless teenager (in Antonia Bird's award-winning
film Safe), the long-suffering wife of East End mobster Reggie Kray (in
The Krays), and the girlfriend of transvestite psycho David Martin (in
Open Fire).
On Monday her distinguished list of television performances stretches
even further with Beyond Reason, a scorching two-hour drama from
Carlton. She portrays real-life killer Susan Christie, the mistress who
murdered the wife of her Army Captain lover in 1991. So why, as an
actress, does Kate Hardie have this thing about traumatic roles?
''I'm very attracted to heavyweight material,'' she says. ''Actually
having some sort of input into society and showing things as they are
makes acting incredibly interesting to me.
''I'd like to do some lighter work but actually I still find acting a
bit embarrassing as a job for a grown-up, so if I do something that has
a bit more power I feel more responsible.''
Beyond Reason, which cost #1.5m to make, is based on the trial
transcripts of the actual case. It is written by Lucy Gannon (Soldier
Soldier, Peak Practice) and co-stars Simon Shephard (Peak Practice,
Chancer) and Jennifer Ehle (Camomile Lawn). It is a classic case of
truth being far more compulsive viewing than fiction.
On March 27, 1991, two young women, Penny McAllister and Susan
Christie, went for a walk in Drumkeeragh Forest, County Down. Fifteen
minutes later Penny was lying dead, her throat slashed, and Susan was
running from the wood, screaming hysterically.
She claimed that they had been attacked by an unknown man who had
attempted to rape her and slain Penny. Three days later, Susan was
charged with the murder. The police had made the fatal connection. Penny
was the wife of dashing Captain Duncan McAllister, a fast-rising officer
in the Royal Corps of Signals who was on a tour of duty in Northern
Ireland, and Susan, a private in the Ulster Defence Regiment, was his
mistress.
The subsequent and highly-publicised trial ended with Susan being
sentenced to four years in prison; increased to nine years on appeal.
The most compelling aspect of the affair was the fact that it should
have happened the other way around. In crimes of passion it is usually
the mistress who is the victim, not the wife.
The seeds of tragedy had been sown two years earlier when Susan met
the ambitious and determined McAllister at a local diving club. What
happened next was little more than a casual fling to the officer but it
was a torrid and passionate love affair for the young woman.
McAllister may have been an officer but he certainly was no gentleman.
His unbecoming conduct started only two weeks after he met Susan, then
19. It was he who suggested that they become lovers. He would make love
to her on the shores of Belfast Lough and, when his wife was away, in
the bedroom of his married quarters. Once, while on a diving trip
abroad, they made love in the water while the unsuspecting Penny
sunbathed on the beach.
The affair came to a head in 1991 when McAllister told Susan he was
being posted to Germany. It was over. They would, he said, have one
final weekend together. They never did. Three days later, Penny and
Susan went for their fateful walk in the woods.
Susan Christie's five-day trial in Belfast ended with her being found
not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of
diminished responsibility.
The case raised questions about the law of homicide, sentencing
policy, military discipline and, ultimately, the human heart and mind.
How could an apparently respectable, well-brought-up young girl take the
life of a beautiful and selfless woman. And, more to the point, how
could she think that she could not only get away with it but also end up
with her victim's husband?
Writer Lucy Gannon explains: ''I gradually became intrigued by this
awful tragedy, by our ability to delude ourselves and to destroy life
for the meanest and shabbiest of reasons.
''I did not go into this project lightly. There is a responsibility to
the memory of Penny and to her family as well as to the family of Susan,
because they too are innocent of wrong doing. There is a duty to the
truth, neither to glamorise it nor to blacken any further the names
involved.''
Kate Hardie describes the film as ''a terrifying modern study of
flawed human beings''.
She goes on: ''I can't understand killing but that's because I'm
squeamish. But I can understand losing perspective and reality and
rationale so much that in a split second you've done something that your
brain is telling you you can't have done.
''I'm sure Susan Christie was an extraordinary, ambitious and
forward-thinking girl and got what she wanted in a tough, male-dominated
aggressive world.''

What make-up should a woman wear to work -- without getting the wrong
kind of attention? Anvar Khan investigates
BIMBO culture has a lot to answer for. Any woman who wants to be seen
as hard-working and career-minded must alienate herself from the soft
and the seductive. Men have one-track minds, they say, and a woman's
duty as a professional is to nudge them into a more objective direction.
''When it comes to work, very low tops and very short skirts are
out,'' says Anne Crozier, Image Consultant with Color Me Beautiful.
''Women will resent it and men will misunderstand the signals.''
Despite years of feminist fallout, men presume that the effort a woman
puts into her appearance is in equal measure to her desperation for
sexual attention. Women, too, have learned to be critical of any female
who dresses to show off her body, because career women have learnt to
conform. The price of taking part in a predominantly male world is to
regulate how much you show. To get on you must pander to the prejudice
that the more sexy a woman looks, the more intellectually inferior she
is. In order to prove one's competence, one has to appear the opposite
of a tart. A maneater is a strange point of reference. Any female, smart
and true, could run a mega-million corporation in sheer stockings and
micro-mini. Women still don't have the option of being able to look they
way they want, for fear of what men might think. This can only be a form
of repression.
Within three minutes of meeting a man or a woman for the first time,
88% of the decison to offer them a job is based on body language and how
she or he looks. Only 12% is based on what that person actually says.
The superficiality of impulse judgments is not worth arguing against.
Grown-ups dress smartly. The career-minded adopt the almost communist
facility of believing that individuality does not have to be reflected
in dress. The last vehicle for any self-expression, therefore, is the
face.
Anne Crozier says: ''I've never met a woman yet who doesn't look
younger and more attractive in make-up. The most common mistake is
wearing the wrong foundation, you should test on your jawline in
daylight and not the back of your hand. It's difficult. Stores have all
got neon megawatt strip lighting.
''Minimum make-up is blusher and lipstick. Maximum is foundation,
light eye make-up and lipstick not too dark. You could be a serial
killer but if you look nice you'll be trusted to get on with the job.
People haven't got the time to find out whether you are a caring,
sharing human being.
* AILEEN CAMERON, 26, a nursing home sister, says: ''I use a simple
cleanser, nothing perfumed, morning and night. I don't wear make-up on a
day-to-day basis. I used to wear the works, but from nursing over the
years I didn't see the point in rising at 6am and putting on a
reasonable face. It felt unhygenic.
''You know what men are like so you have to be careful about what
image you're putting out. When I wore a lot of make-up I tended to
attract the wrong type of man. If men see a woman in lots of make-up and
tight clothes in the streets they think they have a free rein to pass
comment. I don't want that kind of attention. I don't want to have to
look beautiful to catch a man. I want to be myself.
''It's more than fair to say that women still have to make a choice
about how they are seen by men.''
* LESLEY BROWN, 48, a care assistant: ''I've got radiation red cheeks
(thanks to my farming ancestors), and if I don't wear a colour to
balance them out I just glow. I look like two blobs coming towards you.
I never step outside without lipstick. I have three variations on
orangey-pink.
''In the sixties I used foundation and powder to get the pale and
interesting complexion I never had, but I was never keen on wearing
make-up on my skin because it felt as if I was clogging it up. I've
always stuck to Nivea as a moisturiser. As you get older you become more
interested in maintaining what you've got rather than piling on stuff.
Make-up can't hide ugly features.
''Ninety-nine per cent of looking young is down to your genes. My
beauty routine is very simple, I picked it up on the Richard and Judy
show. Every morning I apply a bit of oil or cream on to my face and
cover it with a moist flannel, then repeat with more cream.''
* MARGARET CROSS, a telesales supervisor: ''I take a notion for
different brands. I buy in bulk so I can spend #50 in the same month. I
go for Oriflame, Clinique, Elizabeth Arden, Estee Lauder. I work beside
young girls who don't wear any make-up. A bit of blusher and powder and
they think that's it. I want to look as good as I can. I don't have a
wrinkle. I've always looked after my skin.
''I have a routine. I moisturise and put on my night and throat cream.
Every morning I have a bath and then apply my make-up. I wouldn't buy
something because it's cheap. I like a good product. I like beauty
spots. I like a pale, creamy lipstick and Avon kohl pencil for my eyes.
''I was 14 when I started wearing making up. I would never go out
without it, not even to the shops. Make-up changes all the time but I
know how to put it on. I like to see a face well-made up.
''Once I have my make-up on it gives me lots of confidence. My
daughter says 'Oh so and so said you don't look your age' and I'll have
a laugh and say 'Oh, it gets so boring hearing that!'. Sometimes she'll
say 'Oh Mum, you go overboard'. I had so much stuff I never used I
recently had to throw it all out.''

A YEAR ago at the Paris collections the fashion pack was whipped up
with film frenzy because Robert Altman was in town making a movie about
them. With a star-studded cast of designers and models and some catwalk
footage Altman endeavoured to make Pret-a-Porter, the definitive fashion
film. Remarkably, for a project that spent 10 years in gestation and was
inspired by his first fashion show experience at Sonia Rykiel, Altman
completely misses the point.
The tissue-thin plot about the suspicious death of the powerful and
hated head of the French fashion bureaucracy is interwoven with a host
of confusing sub-plots. The editors of British Vogue (Tracey Ullman),
American Harper's Bazaar (Sally Kellerman) and Elle (Linda Hunt) are
trying to woo a star fashion photographer (Stephen Rea, doing a fair
impersonation of Steven Meisel) to their pages. His mockery of them is
his downfall. There is the American store buyer who turns out to be a
cross-dresser and the covert affair between a burly black designer
(Forest Whitaker) and an effeminate designer (Richard E Grant) whose
androgynous wife is having a grand passion with Whitaker's lover.
The fashion shows are the single thread of continuity through this
patchwork of stories, which includes Julia Roberts spending most of the
film in bed with Tim Robbins. Fortunately Altman recognised catwalk
shows as pure theatre and spliced in footage (watch out for Vivienne
Westwood's collection) from the autumn/winter 1994 collection. What was
missing were those fashion moments, which only an insider understands.
In a bid to repeat his success with The Player, Altman attempts to
lampoon the industry but failed to realise fashion is full of far
funnier follies than the script.
Ironically, our own Absolutely Fabulous is a far more sharply drawn
parody of the fashion industry than Pret-a-Porter. Sadly, the film's
cliches fall flat, lacking the wit and sophistication of the television
comedy.
Pret-a-Porter opens on March 3.

* EARLIER in this century, King Farouk of Egypt and the Shah of Persia
wore western clothing. It seemed as if it would be only a matter of time
before their subjects literally followed suit. However, this did not
happen. There has been a change in attitude towards national costume.
Today, Middle Eastern and African diplomats and politicians can be seen
in flowing robes. Dirndls are worn on the street of Innsbruk and
stetsons in Denver. In Japan, there is growing interest in the kimono.
In many countries, national dress is preferred on high days and
holidays. Just as here the kilt is worn to weddings and on formal
occasions, Breton costume or Sicilian dress is paraded on saints' days
at festivals. People at home in Peru, Lapland and much land between and
beyond, express pride of place through brilliant colours and exuberant
personal decoration.
Notable exceptions are the Amish and Mennonite communities of the
north-east United States and in Canada. Their simple garments are set
not just in place but in time. While most style, including regional
costume, continues to evolve, for religious reasons Amish clothing seems
unlikely to change.
As if in a time-warp, the Amish and the Mennonites still dress like
their ancestors, the settlers of the period 1727-1850. Women and girls
are in face-shading eighteenth-century style bonnets, plain dresses and
black stockings and shoes. Men and boys wear trousers fastened with
buttons, jackets with hooks and eyes. Married men wear beards but no
moustaches. No jewellery or patterns are allowed.
While Amish women channel their sense of colour and form into the
making of beautiful quilts, the majority of the world's population
expresses local and national identity through the wearing of
brightly-coloured embroidery, jewellery, paint, flowers, feathers, and
shells.
Anyone planning to travel rather than tour, or seeking to trace their
far-flung sartorial roots can find a world of colourfully illustrated
detail and a mine of information in World Dress by Frances Kennet
(Mitchell Beazley, #25). Much regional costume is basically peasant
dress and, like minority culture in general, it is now being accorded
increasing respect.

In the wake of the Hanger 13 fatal accident inquiry, the 50th
Rezerection rave takes place at Ingliston tonight -- and it will be as
popular as ever. Thom Dibdin leaps to the defence of the party
YOU might have thought that rave was dead. That massive parties where
thousands of youngsters dance until dawn were a thing of the past. If
they didn't die in the early nineties when the fashionable moved into
the confines of clubs, they were definitely killed by the Criminal
Justice Act.
Well, think again. Rave is not dead. It is not even resting. Neither
fashion gurus nor government ministers can dance on the grave of rave.
At least not in Scotland, where up to 5000 people travel from all over
the UK to Rezerection's all-night parties at the Royal Highland Centre,
Ingliston.
In 1991, the tabloids screamed banner headlines against the travellers
and ravers who dance to outdoor sound systems such as Spiral Tribe at
Castle Morton. Pay parties drew an increasingly fashion-conscious crowd
around the London orbital M25. Questions were asked in the House, but in
Newcastle one-time punk promoter Paul Ludford accidentally discovered
the rave scene.
''We got asked to help out at a show because of my experience with
other types of event,'' remembers Ludford. In 1992 he brought his
experience to Ingliston and has held a rave there every two months
since.
What has kept Rezerection going -- tonight's rave will be the 50th --
is not so much the music but the party atmosphere at the events.
''The attitude of people who come along to the shows hasn't changed,''
according to Ludford. ''They have the same ideals as they had five years
ago. They are there to enjoy themselves, it is not the case that they
turn up and say 'Entertain me', which I think is great.''
And the vibe is a seriously happy one. At last summer's outdoor
Rezerection, which attracted some 16,000 people, more than at any single
paying event at the Edinburgh Festival, there were no recorded acts of
violence.
Young men whom you would avoid after the pubs closed on a Saturday
night smiled and exchanged a few words as they passed by. Women stripped
to their underwear, all the better to dance and sweat, and wandered
freely through the crowd without fear of harassment. The crush at the
front of the stage and by the speakers might have been intense, but
there was still room to dance.
Nor does Rezerection attract the kind of tribal behaviour often
associated with large gatherings. Although predominantly young, ravers
come from all sections of society.
In club terms, the dress sense at Rezerection is exceedingly naff. For
the girls that's not too bad, with minimalist tops and regulation short
dresses. The boys, however, range from designerwear to the worst
excesses of white boilersuits. All accessorise with baseball hats, white
gloves, and light sticks. Not that anyone cares so long as you are
having a good time.
The downside to all this exuberant euphoria is that while people keep
coming back because of the atmosphere, what keeps them up all night is
the drugs.
Guy Kneeling has DJ'd at Rezerection since the start under the name of
Bass Generator. He is under no illusions about the importance of ecstasy
and speed to the rave scene.
''Ecstasy has been there from day one and it's still there now,'' he
says. ''Some people will probably curse us for saying it, but if it
wasn't for the drugs the scene wouldn't be anything like what it is. You
can't say to people 'stop taking them'. If they stopped taking them, the
bottom would fall out of it: you wouldn't get people jumping about for
12 hours. Some people could do it, but the majority couldn't stand the
pace.''
Ludford is equally candid about the use of controlled substances. His
attitude is that prevention is better than cure. There are strict
searches on the door at every event. Not that this can stop people
taking drugs before they go in, so a doctor, nurse, paramedic team,
ambulances, first-aiders and the drug counselling team, Crew 2000, are
in attendance.
This realistic approach means that if accidents occur, then there is
no waiting around for the emergency services to arrive. Diagnosis can be
made on the spot and treatment begun immediately.
While the party atmosphere still reigns, the music has moved on. In
the beginning it was a happy, piano sound with soaring female vocals
over a thumping 4-4 beat. This is still supplied by Scottish bands such
as Rhythmic State and Ultra-Sonic, but the popular trend is to harder,
faster beats. The house and garage music of clubs plods away at 130
beats per minute. At Rezerection, the hardcore sound of Rotterdam DJs
known as Gabber, pulses out at speeds of up to 220 beats a minute.
Since the first-open air festivals of the sixties, young people have
wanted to congregate in large numbers and enjoy the shared experience of
loud music. The Government's response to rave in the early nineties was
to try to bury it with the draconian measures contained in the Criminal
Justice Act. But with proper licensing and a responsible and realistic
attitude from all concerned, the rave phenomenon is still very much
alive. And kickin'.

THE pace of France's presidential election is quickening this weekend.
Both leading candidates, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and former
Gaullist Party leader Jacques Chirac, have finally presented their
electoral platforms, while political factors, including a glaring
corruption affair, have seriously upset Mr Balladur's popularity.
It is no longer a foregone conclusion that the premier will simply
stroll into the Elysee in May with the quiet, modest assurance which is
all part of his charm. His lead is slipping badly. According to the
latest poll, 54% of people plan to vote for Mr Balladur in second round
voting, as opposed to 46% for Mr Chirac. Late last month, however, those
figures stood respectively at 64% and 36%.
Mr Chirac, long cast as the loser, has been gaining ground, and
socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, once the most pitiful casualty of all
in the whole electoral steeplechase, suddenly looks as if he may win
through to the second round.
Last week Mr Balladur held a press conference to outline his political
platform. It should have been a high point in his campaign. However the
affable, rather worried charm he usually exudes failed to translate into
an interesting, let alone rousing performance.
Instead of galvanising his listeners, he mumbled his way for 90
minutes through a poorly presented litany of all-too-forgettable
political promises. The first big meeting of his campaign, on Thursday
outside Paris, failed, for all its slickness, to redress the balance.
Mr Chirac's supporters meanwhile, who had secretly begun to despair of
seeing their candidate in the Elysee, were pinning their hopes on a
rally in Paris last night, at which the former Gaullist leader in turn
outlined his election platform. Opponents and partisans alike considered
the performance was Mr Chirac's last chance to assert himself. ''Can
Chirac still win?'' asked the magazine L'Express this weekend.
''The man who can make Balladur lose,'' meanwhile, was the headline
the Nouvel Observateur magazine used to describe Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua, who recently deserted his old ally Mr Chirac to rally
the more promising Balladur camp. Mr Balladur may be wishing this
weekend he had not bothered. His slip in the polls is partly owing to a
complex affair of illegal telephone tapping and corruption, involving Mr
Pasqua and several top Gaullist associates.
The Prime Minister's popularity also took a tumble after he caved in,
10 days ago, to the demands of student protesters who had taken to the
streets of Paris to demonstrate against a report on university reform.
Students vote, and Mr Balladur appeared more anxious to secure their
support and avoid a public fuss than to stand his corner. Previous
examples of industrial appeasement, such as the Prime Minister's
concessions to unions in the Air France strike in 1993, were quoted by
Chirac supporters as so many cases of lack of authority, and right-wing
voters heard the message.
In deliberate contrast to Mr Balladur's reassuring but most bourgeois
persona, Mr Chirac has been charging around meeting people at street
level and proving himself a man of the people -- something he is
extremely good at. The ebullient populist of the Gaullist movement
claims that right and left are obsolete notions, and his enthusiasm,
rather than precise ideological difference, is intended to make him
stand apart from his rival.
Behind the hail-fellow-well-met facade there quivers, apparently, a
sensitive being: ''He is the sort of man who reads a book of poetry
hidden behind the cover of Playboy,'' one commentator remarked.
Watching the fortunes of the two right-wing heavyweights with evident
interest are the Communist Robert Hue and the Socialist Mr Jospin, who
will be fortunate to rake in 25% of votes between them.
Mr Hue, who had planned to rebuild his party's hopes on the ruins of
the Socialist party, has had to start taking the Socialists into account
as Mr Jospin, elected his party's candidate only a fortnight ago, has
miraculously begun to win support.
According to the opinion polls which haunt every political adviser and
newspaper editor in the land, Mr Jospin might even make it to the second
round of voting and score 45% against Mr Balladur's 55%. Which, like so
many other aspects of the election, would have been unthinkable only a
month ago.

Railtrack boss Bob Horton was gradually replaced on the television news
during last year's signal workers' strike by the tall, angular features
of John Ellis.
They had known Ellis in the late 1980s when he was general manager,
Scotland, for two years, and when he had a reputation as a railwayman
through and through; a man who cared about the network, even though he
was fluent in management-speak that would see the occasional eye or two
glaze over when he rambled on.
He moved to England to other senior posts in Southern Region, Network
SouthEast, InterCity, and then Railtrack. His house moves must have been
more frequent than some railway services.
Then, when the signal workers took industrial action, the Government
was stunned when the strikers continued to hold public support, due in
no small measure to the arrogance and faux pas of Horton. Gradually he
was replaced as spokesman by Ellis.
And there came the surprise. Instead of the conciliatory tones he used
in Scotland, Ellis was pushing a harder line, claiming there was a drift
back to work by signal workers that seemed to be more imaginary than
definite. Any suggestions that there were safety risks in the Dad's Army
of management operating the signal boxes were loftily shrugged aside by
a more hectoring Ellis.
The conundrum to be solved on his return to Scotland is: has there
been a conversion to macho-management on the road to Railtrack's London
headquarters, or was he simply mouthing a management line with which he
did not fully agree?
Richard Rosser, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs'
Association, is willing to give Ellis the benefit of the doubt. ''I only
hope that the industrial relations policies he will pursue at ScotRail
will be less confrontational than at Railtrack.
''My feeling is that he wasn't naturally comfortable with the line he
had to take. I have no doubt that John will do a good job,'' Rosser said
yesterday.
Ellis's other problem, of course, which he will be tired of everyone
pointing out, is that he has a hard act to follow. The lamentations
following Chris Green's sudden resignation would almost suggest that he
ran ScotRail single-handedly, driving every train, selling every ticket.
The fear is not so much that Ellis lacks Green's ability, although he
certainly lacks his charisma, but that he will put up little fight
against the Government's plans to move ScotRail's future privatisation
ahead as smoothly as possible with little public dissent.
Chris Green was not against privatisation. Indeed, he came back to
Scotland to head a management buy-out of the service. But the endless
paperwork, the complexities of so many separate companies, the starving
of funds to provide the services he would really like, frustrated him
enormously.
John Ellis may eventually share such frustration, but is likely to
share it in private, with a public face of little criticism of the
Government's plans.
That is the benign view of the return of Ellis. Now 56, he joined BR,
following a degree at Oxford, as a management trainee in 1962. After
working in a number of sales and marketing positions in the passenger
and freight businesses, he became chief freight manager of BR's eastern
region before entering general management, with his eventual appointment
in Scotland.
Railway folk are clannish. They like people who have spent all their
working lives on the railways. BR has shrewdly calculated that while
Ellis's appointment may not satisfy everyone, it will be more acceptable
than most.
But has the man changed since he was last in Scotland? There are
concerns that he has.
In December, Railwatch, the magazine of pressure group the Railway
Development Society, published comments by Ellis noted at a rail users'
conference. If quoted accurately, there may indeed be cause for some
concern in Scotland.
Railwatch quoted him as saying: ''We will not necessarily support
every station or every route. We want to develop the network as far as
we can, but it will be on a commercial basis. We cannot, and should not,
take into account social issues.''
Asked about the threat to outlying stations, Railwatch quotes Ellis as
saying that money might be better spent on providing a bus to take
passengers to a ''railhead.''
In answer to another question, according to Railwatch, he replied:
''We are not a public service.'' In Scotland, people believe very much
that ScotRail IS a public service.
All of which will dismay campaigners who believe that the West
Highland Line will eventually be under threat if the Government goes
ahead with plans to cut sleeper and Motorail services.
As Campbell Christie, general secretary of the STUC, put it yesterday:
''I'm frankly apprehensive that Mr Ellis's role will be to carry out the
Government's bidding, rather than to do what Chris Green did, which was
to fight for services and the railways in Scotland.''
In his defence, Ellis issued a brief statement in which he said he
''looked forward to working closely with Railtrack Scotland to ensure
that Scotland has the strong rail business it deserves.''
What John Ellis believes Scotland deserves, and what most rail users
believe it deserves, may be running along different lines at present. He
will have a hard job convincing suspicious commuters otherwise.

Raleigh, North Carolina, Friday
COMPUTER physicist Tsutomu Shimomura is accustomed to solving complex
problems, and his skills as a cyber-sleuth helped track down the FBI's
most-wanted hacker.
However there is something he cannot figure out about Kevin Mitnick,
the quarry of his tortuous electronic manhunt.
''I'm curious to know what's broken in him,'' said Shimomura, ''why he
feels compelled to do this.''
Arrested this week at his flat in Raleigh by FBI agents, Mitnick had
been sought for two years for allegedly violating probation on a
previous hacking conviction.
Authorities say Mitnick, 31, electronically raided some of the most
heavily protected corporate computer systems in the nation and pilfered
information worth more than ##660,000, including at least 20,000 credit
card numbers.
He faces up to 35 years in prison and heavy fines if convicted of
computer fraud and illegal use of a telephone access device.
Mitnick appeared before a federal magistrate today, his long hair tied
back with a rubber band and wearing leg shackles. He was denied bail.
Prosecutors depict Mitnick, who once broke into a top-secret military
defence system as a teenage prank, as a world-class computer outlaw.
Others, from his former therapist to some law enforcement officials
who pursued him, describe him as a lonely man addicted to computers and
pitifully obsessed with defeating their security systems.
In 1989, Mitnick was convicted of infiltrating MCI telephone computers
and accessing long-distance codes, and of causing #2.6m in damage to
Digital Equipment.
When he was sentenced to a year in prison, a federal judge ruled that
his hacking was an addiction -- like the junk food he lived on -- and
ordered him to undergo therapy.
In therapy, 21st Mitnick lost 7st and worked on his self-esteem. His
former therapist, Harriet Rosetto, called him ''a sad, lonely, angry,
isolated boy'' who spent more time with computers than people.
Alan Rubin, who defended Mitnick in 1989, said Mitnick's hacking was
relatively benign.
''He never planted a virus, never destroyed any information, never
tried to make money off any of it,'' said Rubin.
However the guardians of databases have a hard time seeing Mitnick as
harmless.
''The security of our database is an ongoing effort . . . It could be
used to harass a person, to leverage credit files, to create false
identities,'' said Evan Nosoff of the California Department of Motor
Vehicles, which was allegedly infiltrated by Mitnick while he was a
fugitive.
Shimomura, a computer security expert, made catching Mitnick his
crusade after the hacker allegedly broke into his home computer on
Christmas Day and stole security programmes Shimomura had written.
Shimomura agreed that hacking could not be taken lightly.
''Kevin has caused a lot of people a lot of trouble, a lot of grief,''
he said.--AP.

Sleptsovsk, Friday
THE ''Angel of Mostar'', British nurse Sally Becker, tonight blasted
British policy on Chechnya en route to its ruined capital, Grozny.
''I never thought I'd see anything worse than Bosnia but Chechnya is a
real horror show,'' said Miss Becker, who visited Russian mothers
demonstrating against the Chechen war in Sleptsovsk today.
Miss Becker, who riled international officials in 1993 by
singlehandedly driving sick children out of the besieged Bosnian enclave
of Mostar, said: ''Why is Britain still pumping money into Russia when
there are such flagrant violations of human rights in Chechnya?
''I'm headed to Grozny today and then back to London where I hope to
wake the Government and the public up to what's going on here.''
Little international assistance has reached the victims of the Chechen
war. Travel in the battle zone is severely restricted, even for aid
organisations.
Miss Becker said the stories of death and destruction she had heard
from Chechen refugees were worse than anything she came across in
Bosnia.
''Women have told me about having to eat dog meat because they had no
food and there are lots of reports of people being dragged from their
homes in Grozny by Russian soldiers and beaten and shot,'' she said.
''It's dreadful that nobody from the West is willing to stand up and
say this can't go on. What's wrong with the world?''
Miss Becker described her trip as a personal fact-finding mission and
said she would be reporting back to a number of aid organisations upon
her return to Britain.
Meanwhile, Russian and Chechen military leaders agreed today to extend
their ceasefire until Sunday. It had been due to expire at midnight.
The two sides failed to agree on an exchange of their dead and
prisoners, but planned to lists of prisoners in Grozny tomorrow.

Cape Town, Friday
THE premier of South Africa's Western Cape province today overruled
his Education Minister to keep open a school in a row pitting black
pupils against white neighbours.
As the pupils won back their school, hundreds of chanting black
children protested in central Cape Town against poor education.
Premier Hernus Kriel's Education Minister ordered the school to close
yesterday after several days of confrontation.
Whites in the Ruyterwacht suburb of Cape Town had armed themselves
with whips, clubs, and attack dogs in a bid to prevent black students
from being bussed to the disused white primary school.
Kriel, the only member of the white National Party to head a
provincial government, said he would not allow racial intolerance to
prevent efforts to ease the crisis in black education.
Buses carrying about 1000 students to a Cape Town protest today were
stopped by a huge police presence in the city for the opening of
Parliament by President Nelson Mandela.
A token 200 protesters were let through and cordoned off by armed
police to prevent a repeat of yesterday's incidents, when black youths
mugged several white women and wrecked fruit stalls during pupil-power
protests.
Mandela said of incidents at Ruyterwacht, where a black child was
beaten by a white armed with a whip: ''Those responsible for these
crimes of racism must be brought to book without delay.''--AP/Reuter.

Cape Town, Friday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela today opened the second session of South
Africa's new democratic Parliament with a tough warning to white racists
and to militant blacks who had ''misread freedom to mean licence''.
In a state-of-the-nation address after nine months in power, Mandela,
76, called for discipline from the victims of apartheid and co-operation
from its perpetrators.
''Let it therefore be clear to all that the battle against the forces
of anarchy and chaos has been joined. Let no-one say they have not been
warned,'' he told a joint sitting of the Senate and National Assembly in
Cape Town.
''All of us must rid ourselves of the wrong notion that the government
has a big bag full of money. Mass action of any kind will not create
resources that the government does not have.''
The president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, John
Gomomo, who listened from the public gallery, said workers would not
give up their right to mass action.
''People on the ground who are suffering and are very poor will not
approach the president's speech in a very positive way,'' he warned.
Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a partner in Mandela's government,
said: ''It was a very down-to-earth speech. It struck all the right
notes.''
To whites who continue to resist the transition from minority rule to
democracy, Mandela said not enough had been done to root out the cancer
of racism.
To the police, many of them veterans of the white-led force that
enforced racial segregation, he said: ''The government is opposed to and
has no intention to conduct a witch-hunt against the police as a result
of activities arising from orders given to the police by the apartheid
regime.''
Mandela has been criticised by blacks for failing to deliver the
fruits of democracy, but he said today that a minority was trying to sow
anarchy through strikes, road blockades, vandalism, hostage-taking, and
assault.
''Some of those who have initiated and participated in such activities
have misread freedom to mean licence. They have wrongly concluded that
an elected government of the people is a government that is open to
compulsion through anarchy,'' he said.
On corruption, Mandela said: ''We need no educators with regard to the
matter of rooting out corruption, which will be dealt with firmly and
unequivocally.''
However with his estranged wife, Winnie, and other members of his
African National Congress facing allegations of financial impropriety,
he warned South Africans against ''a primeval instinct to pillory and
burn people at the stake''.--Reuter.

Washington, Friday
A BILL to slash US funding for UN peacekeeping operations came under
fire from Defence Secretary William Perry, and the Pentagon's top
general.
Perry predicted that the defence Bill, passed by the House of
Representatives, would never become law.
Army General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, warned that it would increase rather than decrease American
military costs and responsibilities around the globe.
''I am implacably opposed to this Bill,'' said Perry, adding that he
did not think it would be passed ''both because of the opposition of the
administration and because of the different direction in which the
Senate is heading''.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher also attacked the Bill, saying
it was a security risk that compromised the president's authority.
''Intentionally or not, the Bill would eliminate peacekeeping as an
instrument of US foreign policy,'' Christopher said after the House
vote, terming it ''a threat to this and every future president's
authority to protect the security of the United States''.
Christopher said the administration would work with Congress to change
the Bill before it came up for a vote in the Senate.
Perry and Shalikashvili, speaking after a ceremony to honour soldiers
for their part in the US military operation in Haiti, attacked a
provision in the Bill demanding that American troops serve only under a
US commander in virtually all joint military operations. They said this
would force Washington to ''go it alone'' around the world.
Documents obtained by the Washington Post show that the Republicans
are considering ending and reducing US payments to the UN for
peacekeeping and other programmes, saving $3.2bn.
Other suggestions include eliminating the Agency for International
Development, the main conduit for US foreign aid; phasing out aid to the
former Soviet republics, and to countries suh as Ireland, Turkey,
Greece, and Cyprus; cutting food aid; and ending support for development
banks such as the World Bank.
A Foreign Office spokesman in London said: ''We are very concerned by
the cash crisis in the UN, and the US attitude is an angle to that.
''We have made proposals for budgetary reform.''
The UK and Sweden were working on proposals to reform the UN's budget,
the spokesman said. They wanted to see countries' contributions to the
UN brought more into line with their capacity to pay.
This would reduce the contribution from the US which currently pays
some 25% of the peacekeeping budget, and 31% of the UN general budget,
the spokesman said.
The UN's budget crisis was not restricted just to the US. Some 39
countries failed to make any contributions last year, and the UN was
$2bn short, he said.--Reuter/AP.

Buenos Aires, Friday
A STRAY dog climbed Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in the world
outside the Himalayas, and rescued two lost climbers before
disappearing, an Argentine newspaper reported.
Austrian mountain guide Armin Liedl told the daily Clarin that, when
he and four German climbers were beginning their ascent of the 23,000ft
Andes peak separating Argentina from Chile, a mongrel began to tag
along.
It wandered off but later returned, and Liedl found it one morning
shivering in the snow outside his tent.
''I decided to climb with him up to the peak and, if we made it, to
call him Summit,'' the guide said.
At 21,000ft the dog helped save two lost Argentine climbers suffering
from altitude sickness, barking to alert Liedl and his companions, who
went to the aid of the pair.
However ''Summit'' vanished after reaching the summit of Aconcagua,
which has claimed many lives in the past.
Hoping that the dog may not be one of them, Liedl said: ''In the next
few days I'm going to go back to look for it and take it back to
Austria.''
* Dozens of mourners attended the burial of a stray mongrel dog which
made a habit of attending church and other public gatherings in a small
Brazilian town.
Jorge, as the people of Andradas called him, was buried in the town
zoo. ''He was the size of a calf and as sweet as a lamb and people loved
him,'' said the mayor's wife.--Reuter.

THERE'S a chance to win a free wedding reception at tomorrow's Wedding
Fair at Westerwood Hotel, Cumbernauld. The hotel management is offering
a prize (worth #1500) of its complete wedding reception package -- for
up to 50 people -- at this exciting event, which looks like becoming a
regular annual fixture at the four-star hotel, golf and country club.
And even if you don't have the luck of the prize draw there are lots
of special discounts on offer at tomorrow's fair (including a 10%
discount on the reception itself) and masses of ideas to be gleaned,
covering every last detail from the bride's and the guests' clothes and
accessories, to the video recording, the flowers and the limousines. You
can arrange absolutely everything for your special day at the Westerwood
Wedding Fair.
Westerwood expects more than 600 people at the fair, which runs from
1pm until 5pm. Entrance is free, though there will be a charge of #2 for
entry to each of the two fashion shows to be staged at 2pm and 3.30pm,
featuring the work of local design specialist Karen Rotchford. Karen
will unveil her new collection -- which is almost guaranteed to have a
subtly Scottish flavour -- while Catherine's of Partick will provide
sartorial ideas for the going-away outfits, clothes for
mothers-of-the-bride and groom, and the other wedding guests.
There will be representatives from the Silver Limousine Service of
Stonehouse, Variety Florists, Impromptu Accessories (that's shoes and
handbags and so on), Graham's Videos and the photographers, Sharp's of
Hamilton. Legal and General will also be on call should you wish to
arrange a mortgage and McGhee the bakers will be taking orders.
Many couples like to think well ahead, sometimes two or three years,
when setting the date and booking the reception, and Westerwood has
bookings well into the nineties, mostly for Saturdays, though Fridays
and Sundays are steadily gaining in popularity. Impromptu wedding
receptions, however, on any day of the week, can be arranged for those
couples who favour spontaneity. The hotel will even engage a minister to
perform the ceremony, thus cutting out additional travel and
complications.
The hotel's facilities are first-class and the ambience is relaxed but
elegant, with a superb standard of decor and finish throughout. The Old
Masters restaurant, a stunning room which takes its name from the
original oil paintings displayed on rich, green walls, makes a perfect
setting for a pleasantly intimate wedding breakfast -- be it lunch or
dinner.
A variety of function rooms is available and Westerwood also offers
attractive overnight rates for the wedding guests -- this apart from the
complimentary accommodation which is made available to the bride and
groom as part of the wedding package.
There are no hidden extras when you book a wedding at Westerwood.
Welcoming drinks await the guests, there's a choice of three
well-balanced menus accompanied by the house red or white, and sparkling
wine to accompany the cake-cutting.
Thoughtful extras such as personalised menus, table plan and place
cards complete the picture and Westerwood's carefully landscaped gardens
provide a perfect backdrop for your wedding photographs.
The free wedding reception is not the only prize on offer at
tomorrow's Wedding Fair. Dollar Helicopters will be there with an offer
of a free trip for another lucky person.
But prizes aside, there will be plenty of advice on hand to ensure
that your special day suffers not the slightest hitch. And for couples
who book their weddings on the day of the fair there will be an
attractive discount.

PITY John Major. How must it feel to have as your Chancellor a man who
is patently everything you have failed to be? Confident, combative,
unafraid, prepared to believe in something and say so publicly, Kenneth
Clarke has all these qualities. And one more, one that must have the
Prime Minister quaking in his Y-fronts: if John Major is an accident of
history, Kenneth Clarke shows every sign of having history on his side.
That day in 1993 when Clarke was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, the
picture said it all. Posing for photographers outside the Treasury, his
rumpled double-breasted suit hanging unbuttoned over a contented belly,
his fluorescent pink and green Garrick Club tie dangling unfashionably
far below his belt, Kenneth Clarke looked like a bouncer outside a
nightclub, prepared to defend his turf and spoiling for a brawl.
Over the past 10 days the bruiser has thrown his weight around, and
John Major has felt the consequences. Clarke's supporters are delighted,
the Tory right is incandescent, and the Prime Minister must be fearing
for his job. For what the political world is witnessing could well be
the first, telling skirmishes of a battle for the leadership of the Tory
party. If a Government depends on the relationship between its
Chancellor and Prime Minister, then the rift between Ken and John is
ominous. Was not the resignation of Nigel Lawson in 1989 the beginning
of the end for Margaret Thatcher?
Clarke has held the unofficial post of Prime Minister-in-Waiting since
Michael Heseltine suffered the ill-luck of a serious heart attack, which
effectively ruled him out of another chance at the job. With his
exuberant self-confidence and the evident relish with which he takes on
opponents at the despatch box, Clarke stands out in a Cabinet of grey
men in grey suits who like to hide behind euphemism and dissimulation.
But what divides him most from his colleagues, and now, publicly and
dangerously, from the Prime Minister, is his enthusiasm for all things
European. Though his views are not new, the timing of this latest
intervention is everything. Starting with a speech last week in which he
argued it was possible to have European monetary union without political
union, he has been outspoken in his belief that the Tory party should
embrace membership of the European Union.
On Thursday, despite frantic efforts by his colleagues to shut him up,
and demands from the right of the party for him to be gagged by Mr
Major, Clarke returned to the fray. In a newspaper interview he declared
that it was his responsibility as Chancellor to set out the
''undoubted'' benefits of Britain's membership in the EU. Above all, he
claimed a single currency would not threaten the British nation state.
This was too much. Hours later the European split at the top of the
Cabinet was confirmed. Once allies, Clarke and Major were in open
disagreement. Asked three times in the Commons to back his Chancellor's
views, Major refused. St Peter denying Christ could not have been more
hesitant: what hope can there be for a Prime Minister without an answer
on the future of the British nation-state?
The damage wrought is evident by the vain attempts yesterday to
contain the crisis. Clarke has exploded the pro-Europe troika of Major,
Clarke, and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, which until now had opposed
the Cabinet ''bastards'' of Employment Secretary Michael Portillo,
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley, and Welsh Secretary John
Redwood. Clearly, he is no longer prepared to stand quietly by while
John Major, under pressure from the Euro-sceptic right, repositions the
party along a far more nationalist line.
Now all attention is on the Chancellor. Without warning he has given
us what political junkies desperately hope will turn into that great
Tory ritual, the Leadership Contest. Despite yesterday's assurances from
both sides that all is well, few now are in any doubt that Mr Clarke has
at last shown his hand. What has puzzled observers is his strategy. Was
it intentional? Is it an attempt to oust Mr Major? Or is it something
deeper, the first step in a realignment of British politics, away from
the old Labour-Tory division and towards one based on conflicting
visions of Europe: For and Against, Europhile and Europhobe, Federalist
and Nationalist?
Kenneth Clarke, born in 1940, shares his birthplace of Eastwood, near
Nottingham, with D H Lawrence, although he has never shown any literary
inclinations. His father, also Kenneth, was a colliery electrician who
became a watch repairer. His mother had a problem with drink. His
brother sells cars. Young Kenneth went from Nottingham High School to
Caius College Cambridge, where he studied for the Bar. His political
ambitions were obvious at university, where he joined the mafia that
continues to dominate Tory politics. He played politics in the Cambridge
Union with Michael Howard, John Gummer, Norman Fowler, and Norman
Lamont, and continues to play politics with them in and out of Cabinet.
He was called to the Bar soon after coming down, and seven years
later, in 1970, entered the Commons. Now 54, Mr Clarke remains the
partying politician, always ready -- to the despair of his more
abstemious civil servants -- for a few late night pints and small cigars
at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in Soho. In 1964 he married Gillian Edwards,
who gave up a Fellowship at Cambridge to support his political career.
They have two grown-up children. An extrovert in politics, he protects
his private life. His recreations are resolutely Middle-England: jazz,
football, cricket, and bird watching.
His career at Westminster has been marked as much by controversy as by
a steady upward progression. By the time he took over at the Treasury he
had held seven ministerial posts and taken on the toughest Whitehall
departments -- among them Health, Education, and the Home Office -- with
the task of forcing Thatcherite market reforms down the throats of
nurses, ambulance drivers, teachers, policemen -- just about every
public sector employee there was. He did not make himself popular.
He smoked during meetings at Health, he called the ambulancemen
''professional drivers'', was rude to anyone who contradicted him, and
managed to leave simmering disputes in his wake. His skill lay in
avoiding the unforeseen disasters which wreck many a ministerial career
by side-stepping every political banana skin that came his way. And
throughout he never disguised his yearning for the top job.
At the Treasury he has been a success with its civil servants. Their
initial frustrations at his refusal to be led -- the Treasury does not
like independent-minded Ministers -- have been replaced by respect for a
politician who, though by no means an intellectual, has proved a master
of his brief, clear in his objectives, and prepared to take the
difficult decisions necessary to achieve them. His greatest
accomplishment in the Treasury's eyes is to have so far resisted any
pressure to ease up on the fight against inflation.
As Chancellor Clarke has made clear, he wants it all: as much growth
as possible without stoking inflation, and sharp reductions in the
nagging budget deficit without having to impose unpopular cuts on social
welfare. So far so good. Lower than expected inflation has allowed him
to claim spending cuts and a reduced deficit, growth remains steady and
even this week's inflation figures show the all-important underlying
rate still below a distinctly un-British 3%. It may all be due to the
unforeseen benefits of Britain's ignominious ejection from the exchange
rate mechanism, but his supporters are describing him as the most
successful chancellor since the war.
No wonder then that they have so far counselled a wait-and-see
approach to the next step, Number 10. They argue that with a Prime
Minister like John Major, apparently determined to blunder his way out
of a job, an heir presumptive need do no more than sit back, watch, and
wait for the call to Buckingham Palace. Clarke has never been disloyal.
But he is honest, which at crucial moments is a deadly quality. He
backed Lady Thatcher in the first ballot, but saw the way things were
going by the second, walked into her room, and told her the game was up.
Major must know that the man who declared from the podium at last
autumn's party conference that ''any enemy of John Major's is an enemy
of mine'' is an avowed fan of Harold Macmillan. He knows a wind of
change when he feels it. As a committed Middle-Englander, whose grammar
school education and political career was founded on the One Nation
Toryism of the fifties, Clarke is desperate to get to Downing Street.
To understand his motivations one must look back at those roots. He is
proud to be from the Midlands. For all the evenings at Ronnie Scott's,
he is determinedly not a metropolitan sophisticate, or part of the
landed patrician order which sniffs at any sign of foreignness. Even if
his radicalism is old fashioned, from the days when jazz was considered
risque, it is based on Macmillan's cry for decolonisation. As a student,
Clarke boycotted South African sherry over Sharpeville.
He supports closer European integration not because he buys all the
calls from Brussels for more regulation, but because he passionately
believes in Europe as a force for change and a natural buffer between
the United States and the East. But he is not fanatical about it. He
once proudly claimed not to have read the Maastricht Treaty. He is not
persuaded by the Euro-idealists, and is suspicious of too much
interference from the centre. He once dismissed the European Space
Agency as a plan to ''put a European dwarf on the moon''. Clarke is, by
all accounts, a federalist.
His views are shared by a large chunk of the Labour Party, just as the
fear of the Continent expressed on the right of the Tory party finds
friends on the left of Labour. So no wonder that Clarke's declaration
has prompted musings over the future of British politics. If the
extremes of socialism and capitalism have lost out to a middle ground of
agreement on a market economy based on a perpetual welfare state, then
politics must look for other divisions. With nationalism verging on
xenophobia increasing among the Tories, and John Major paying it lip
service, the way is clear for the party's pro-European federalists to
emerge and strike off on their own.
In the meantime, Kenneth Clarke is a Tory politician who wants to be
the next Tory Prime Minister. His success as a populist may be his
downfall. Tory leaders are usually those who are felt to be a force for
unity. Clarke's unrestrained Europhilia -- though stopping short of
Euro-fanaticism -- and the lack of subtlety he has shown in throwing his
weight about, may militate against him. But if the Tory party's greatest
strength in the face of electoral disaster is its instinct for survival,
then it may have to turn to the man who, obnoxious though he may be, has
the greatest chance of persuading voters -- preferably over a pint of
Fed -- to give the party one last chance.

A CALL for radical change to Britain's construction industry, to halve
the cost of building and bring it in line with other countries, was made
yesterday by Sir John Egan, chief executive of the BAA, the airport
operators.
In an exclusive interview with The Herald, Sir John said that BAA,
which spends more than #1m a day on its building programmes, had carried
out its own research. This, he claimed, had shown how uncompetitive
British construction companies were.
The keys to the elimination of waste in the industry were pre-planning
and standardisation, and he said the recommendations in the Government's
Latham Report, which forecast that construction costs could fall by 30%
by the year 2000, were not enough.
Sir John, in Aberdeen as part of an annual staff briefing exercise,
said that, aided by Reading University where BAA has a chair in project
design and management, it had carried out exercises comparing the cost
of building in the UK with other countries.
The Government has been extremely concerned about this and its Latham
Report said buildings in the UK are about 35% more expensive than in
Europe.
He said: ''Our figures show that in fact buildings in the UK cost
twice as much as the world best which is in the United States. We have
done a lot of investigation to find out why and it is quite clear what
the reasons are -- although it will be quite difficult to put it right.
''To start with contractors in the UK don't pre-plan their work very
well. Each new project seems to bring a new team together. There doesn't
seem to be a very clear framework in which to plan the concept of the
building.
''Teamwork in the construction industry isn't good and pre-planning
isn't very good. They tend to get started on building and then design as
they go along instead of pre-planning the whole building before work
starts.''
Sir John said that in the United States standardised components were
used, which meant not only that they all fitted together well and could
be produced more cost effectively, but the sub-contractors became
familiar with them and could fit them together more quickly.
BAA is now trying to pre-plan all its work and standardise components.
''Productivity on a British building site might be as low as 25% --
that is, only 25% of the people are working at any one time -- and you
can get that up to 70% or 80% if people carefully pre-plan their work
and use standardised components,'' Sir John said.
A spokesman for the Building Employers' Confederation said later: ''We
recognise there are improvements which need to be made and we agree
there is considerable potential for cost saving and this confederation
in particular has supported the recommendations of the Latham Review
which aims to do just that.
''We are working hard in the confederation to support the Latham
proposals and introduce measures which will help our members to reduce
costs and meet some of the points Sir John is making.
''Having said that, it really does sound to be rather a strong and
sweeping criticism which doesn't take into account the efforts the
industry has been making over the past few years to improve its
performance in these areas.''

Pre-match violence in city centre should have alerted the authorities
on the night Irish football lost its innocence
SOMETIME around 7.22 on Wednesday night, Irish football came of
international age in a traumatic rite of passage that was as shocking as
it was unexpected. For the last 15 years, while hooliganism had been
jackbooting its way across Britain and Europe, Ireland had remained
largely untouched.
In the pre-Jack Charlton days, the conspicuous lack of success by the
national team meant that matches never attracted the sort of interest
that could lead to crowd trouble. And since Charlton's arrival as
Ireland manager, the whole experience has been surrounded by a kind of
bonhomie that made the prospect of crowd violence almost absurd.
But as the first piece of ripped-out seating rained down from the west
stand at Lansdowne Road during the game against England, that was
changed forever. Irish football lost its innocence.
Last Tuesday night in Dublin wasn't like the numerous
pre-international nights of the past 10 years. This time, instead of the
usual relaxed atmosphere, there was an unfamiliar tension as the 2000 or
so visiting English supporters fanned out around the pubs in the city
centre.
Tales of violence spread quickly -- a pub wrecked here, a waiter
head-butted there -- and it culminated in the stabbing with a broken
glass of a barman in an O'Connell Street pub. All the signs were there.
However, even as late as Wednesday lunchtime, the Football Association
of Ireland and the Gardai (police) remained blissfully unaware of the
mounting threat. Bernard O'Byrne, the FAI head of security, appeared on
a television news programme to say that they weren't expecting any
trouble. And, he added, if there was any, the FAI was well equipped to
deal with it. In the days since, those claims have rung hollower and
hollower.
At around 3pm on Wednesday the English supporters started to spill out
of the city centre pubs. Grafton Street, the city's well-heeled
pedestrian shopping area, had seldom seen anything like it as groups of
20 and 30 shaven-headed men strutted their way towards the ground, beer
bottles in their hands, in a display of controlled menace.
Any semblance of control by either the Gardai or the FAI security
staff had now been surrendered and they had, unknowingly, entered a
damage limitation situation. Recriminations between the English police,
the FAI, and the Gardai have been tossed back and forth since the game.
The English claim they drew up a list of far right sympathisers
travelling to the match and sent it to the Gardai; the Gardai claims it
passed it on to the FAI, who, in turn, says it never received it.
The scenario has all the appearance of high farce, and none of it
takes away from the woeful lack of preparation by the Irish authorities.
The FAI's O'Byrne says it was only 10 minutes before the game that they
realised it wasn't 30 to 40 troublemakers, but instead ''a situation
where we had a military operation mounted against us.''
At least 24 hours beforehand, any reasonably informed observer could
have told him this wasn't a group of carefree day trippers.
Before kick-off, the Irish and English teams lined up for the national
anthems. This was the first time that God Save The Queen had been played
at a football international in Dublin for 31 years.
In most areas of the ground there was sporadic booing, but in the
upper deck of the west stand it was greeted with Nazi salutes by
hundreds of English supporters. The Irish anthem was given an English
accompaniment of No Surrender to the IRA. The battle lines had been
drawn.
For 22 minutes of the game itself the Republic of Ireland played
surprisingly well, and David Kelly's goal was as good as they have
scored in the past five years.
But just five minutes later, the teams were back in their dressing
rooms, a photographer from the Irish Daily Star was on his way to
hospital with a fractured skull, and scores of Irish fans who had been
sitting in the lower deck of the west stand had poured on to the pitch
to escape the debris falling from above.
Ninety minutes after the game was officially abandoned, charges by the
English supporters and counter-charges by baton-wielding Gardai were
still continuing in front of a bemused Irish television audience. The
hooligans had come to town.
In Ireland, there is a marked reluctance to point accusing fingers at
the Gardai and the FAI. Policing of Irish internationals has always
passed off peacefully in the past, and there is a certain degree of
sympathy directed towards a football association that found itself
facing up to imported thuggery.
But none of this exonerates the FAI completely. Naivety and ignorance
are the flimsiest of defences.
The television pictures show the Gardai riot squads moving in with
considerable force. But they did so at least an hour too late.
It now appears that they were prepared for trouble not inside the
ground, but outside where English fans had gone on the rampage on their
last visit to Dublin, in 1990. At best, the Gardai is guilty of a gross
miscalculation.
If anything, the FAI is more culpable. Since the 1988 European
Championships the FAI's star has been steadily in the ascendance -- two
World Cups, spiralling revenue from commercial contracts, and
artificially high ticket prices -- and the success of the team on the
pitch has made the FAI immune from criticism.
One direct result of the riot is that the unquestioning deference of
the Irish fan to the FAI has disappeared forever. At least some of
Wednesday's problems stem from good old fashioned greed. The English FA
was allocated 4000 tickets for the game and around 1300 were returned
unsold.
What did the FAI then do? It sold on these tickets to Irish supporters
desperate to see the game but who, unknown to them, would have to sit
surrounded by English supporters.
Then there was the stewarding of the west stand. There have been
numerous testimonies from Irish supporters that there wasn't a single
policeman or FAI steward to be seen before the trouble began. This is
damning enough, but the ineptitude didn't end there.
FAI policy, it seems, was to give complimentary tickets to
''unofficial'' stewards who were expected to sit in an area between the
Irish and English fans. One of the stewards said: ''The role, I
understood, was as a buffer zone where respectable, decent Irish fans
would sit next to these English guys. Basically, we were fodder.''
As a credible stewarding policy this is unheard of, even at the lowest
club level; for this type of highly organised international violence it
is inexcusable.
By Thursday afternoon, the last of the English supporters had been
ferried home. At the port in Dun Laoghaire they had saved one final
salvo of bile, spit, and abuse for reporters and photographers.
In England, the public was waking to the fact that, as far as football
was concerned, nothing had changed. In Ireland, everything had changed
and the national relationship with football could never be the same
again.
The age of innocence was over. Welcome to international football.

A BID to secure legislation for safety measures on all buses
transporting children to school was announced yesterday, on the first
anniversary of the Biggar school bus tragedy which killed teenagers Tony
Cousins and Francis Scorgie.
It was also revealed that the mother of one of the victims, Mrs Shona
Cousins, intended to stand as an independent candidate for the Carnwath
ward in the new South Lanarkshire unitary authority.
Confirming the move, she said: ''I intend to make sure my son has not
died for nothing. It would be good to have someone on the inside, for a
change, instead of us always being on the outside, chapping the door.''
News of her intentions won the praise of Mrs Pat Harris, founder
member and UK national secretary of the campaign group Belt Up School
Kids, who visited Biggar yesterday.
She said: ''I think Shona's very brave. We're right behind her. It
takes guts. I've nothing but admiration for the lady.''
The BUSK official also attacked the Government's stance, claiming that
it seriously underestimated the extent of the problem and of parental
concern.
Mr Jimmy Hood, Labour MP for Clydesdale, revealed yesterday that he
intended to raise a Private Member's Bill in the Commons after what he
described as the Government's disregard and failure to take the issue of
school bus safety seriously.
He said: ''We have waited and waited for this Government to act, and
despite all the promises nothing has happened. It is a ridiculous state
of affairs and it is imperative action is taken before there is another
tragedy like the one at Biggar.
''I hope that my School Transport Safety Bill will receive the support
necessary to force this Government into implementing measures which
could save many children's lives.''
Among the measures planned by the MP in his Bill will be compulsory
fitting and wearing of seat belts on buses, licensing drivers, road
management schemes, and supervision on all school transport.
Mrs Harris said there had been 75 school bus accidents, resulting in
34 deaths and more than 1000 schoolchildren injured, some seriously.
She argued that Government figures were flawed and she was prepared to
submit the BUSK statistics for independent scrutiny.
She said the message was loud and clear: ''Act now.'' However, she
said it was essential that new laws were ''real and meaningful''.

MIDWIVES yesterday joined health union protests over the Government's
1% pay award.
The move, announced by the Royal College of Midwives, follows the
decision by Unison, representing 240,000 of Britain's 600,000 nurses, to
take the first step towards industrial action by agreeing to hold a
ballot.
Royal College of Midwives General Secretary Julia Allison said:
''Midwives are attempting to implement local and national requirements
for the maternity services, but at the same time many of them will be
worse off financially.''
The RCM plans a further meeting next Tuesday to decide on any further
action.
The Royal College of Nursing, also angry over the 1% award, is to hold
an emergency meeting at its London headquarters today.
The Government wants nurses and midwives to negotiate up to 3% locally
with the trusts, but they argue this will lead to variations across the
country.
But the director of human resources on the NHS executive, Ken Jarrold,
rejected the nurses' claims.
''To say that nurses can only get a 1% pay rise is a fundamental
misunderstanding of the report of their independent Pay Review Body, the
recommendations of which the Government has accepted in full.
''What the report says is that it expects the majority of nurses to
secure a pay rise in the range of 1.5% to 3% as a result of local pay
negotiation.''

<HEADLINE>#15m Guinness trust settlement cleared by court</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A DECISION by Maureen, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, to settle a
#15m Guinness family trust fund in favour of her two grand-daughters was
given legal clearance by the High Court yesterday.
The court upheld the validity of a disputed deed executed four years
ago by 88-year-old Lady Maureen, of Knightsbridge, London, appointing
her remaining interests in her part of the family trust to Evgenia Sands
and Ivana Lowell.
Mr Justice Knox's judgment means that Mrs Sands, 30, of Los Angeles,
who is married to actor Julian Sands, and her 28-year-old sister, who
lives in New York, will receive income from the fund and inherit the
capital when their grandmother dies.
Lady Maureen's power to make the settlement was challenged by her
daughters, the sisters' mother Lady Caroline Lowell, 63, also of New
York, and racehorse breeder Lady Perdita Blackwood, 60, of
Crawfordsburn, Newtownards, County Down, who has no children.
They were joined by Lady Maureen's daughter-in-law Belinda ''Lindy'',
Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, of west London, widow of Sheridan, the
5th Marquis, who died seven years ago. She is also childless.
Lawyers for the three argued that a 1948 deed, in which Lady Maureen
surrendered to them her life interest in the greater part of the fortune
she would later inherit from her father, Guinness heir Ernest Guinness,
was still binding to their benefit because she had given up her power to
make any future appointments of the money.
But the judge disagreed and, at the end of a complex 90-minute
judgment, said that she had not surrendered her right to change the
ultimate destination of the capital.
The case was brought to court, at the request of family members, by
the trustees of Lady Maureen's interests in the Jersey-based Iveagh Will
Trust for a ruling on the legal principles involved.
After yesterday's ruling, Mr Ludovic de Walden, solicitor for Lady
Maureen, the trustees, and the grand-daughters, said: ''We are, of
course, delighted at the judge's clarification.
''The judge found that Lady Maureen's power of appointment survived
the 1948 deed, and that her wishes as expressed in 1991 are valid.''
He said Lady Maureen was very saddened that the case was brought to
court.
He pointed out that, between 1948 and 1966, she gave her two daughters
and their brother ''a very substantial fortune'', including a share in
the Guinness family's wealthy Canadian trusts, and there was no question
of anyone being ''cut out'' by the 1991 deed in favour of the
grand-daughters.
''In 1991, she felt the time had come to give what was left within her
power to appoint to the next generation, to benefit them now. There are
also obvious tax advantages.''
Mr de Walden stressed that nobody was ''at daggers drawn'', although
there were opposing views -- or there had been until yesterday's
judgment.
No members of the family were in court for the hearing.
The history of the dispute goes back to an estimated #200m fortune
left in 1927 by Lady Maureen's grandfather, the 1st Earl of Iveagh, who
founded the Guinness dynasty.
Among his children was Lady Dufferin's father Ernest Guinness, who
died in 1949.

A FORMER Tory MP who championed the cause of some Lloyd's names has
been asked to help hundreds of shareholders left holding worthless
certificates when a Glasgow-based motor insurers collapsed in October
1989 soon after its #4.4m flotation.
But Mr Tom Benyon has warned them that they have little time to get
things moving as any action could be time-barred -- claims cannot be
brought more than six years after the date that share dealings were
suspended.
Some of the shareholders have arranged a meeting in Glasgow's Marriot
Hotel for next Thursday to dsicuss setting up an action group.
The high-profile Diamond Group was floated on the Stock Market in a
blaze of publicity in April 1989. But the breakdown insurance company
crashed six months later.
One major shareholder, Postel, managers of the Post Office and BT
pension fund, is suing Mr Derek Diamond and Mr Clive Miller, directors
of the Diamond Group and the group's professional advisers at the time
of its launch on the unlisted securities market.
Glasgow-based Allied Provincial Securities Ltd and accountants Arthur
Andersen are among the parties being sued for alleged negligence in
connection with the collapse.
Postel is claiming #832,000, which it says was lost from pensioners'
funds. It alleges that the causes of the group's collapse should have
been apparent to Diamond's professional advisers at the time of its
public listing. The action is likely to be heard early next year.
Mr Benyon, director of the Society of Names, yesterday confirmed that
he had been approached by some Diamond group shareholders to take up the
cudgels on their behalf.
Mr Benyon, founded the Gooda Walker Action Group, which earlier this
week secured an interim offer of #210m on behalf of 3500 investors at
Lloyd's.
He has written to Diamond Group plc shareholders inviting them to join
an action, which he claims has a high chance of success.
Postel has told Mr Benyon that itwould not object to shareholders
forming a Diamond action group to enable them to join its existing
action.
Shareholders would be expected to make a contribution to the costs of
the action, but could expect to recoup a substantial proportion of their
losses if the action was successful.
Mr Benyon said yesterday: ''I feel very strongly that the shareholders
should not be exploited. The only way they can get justice is to fight
back. We are confident that they have an excellent case.''
Mr Ronald MacDonald, a leading Glasgow insurance broker who lost ''a
substantial sum'' along with two fellow directors when the Diamond Group
failed, yesterday welcomed Mr Benyon's intervention.
He said: ''We considered legal action at the time to recover our
losses, but decided against this because of the prohibitive legal costs.
''Although our firm is now going well, the action group will give
ourselves and other shareholders who could not otherwise afford to
pursue the matter in court the opportunity to recover some of our
losses.''

TWENTY-five professional photographers were caught napping when the
elusive ''big beast' of the Highlands made an appearance -- and no-one
had a camera ready for the picture.
The photographers were busy ''concentrating'' on a model in bridal
dress in the grounds of Knockomie Hotel near Forres, Moray, when local
photographer Les Hester noticed cattle stampeding in a nearby field.
He said: ''The cows seemed really excited and were going crazy. They
were following an animal. The animal was a big cat which was loping
along the line of the fence in the next field.
''I was totally surprised, and then I realised what I was looking at.
It was definitely not a dog. It was big.''
He said that it was dark dun in colour and similar to the ''Beast of
Bodmin' which was filmed in Cornwall last year.
There have been many sightings of big cats in the Moray area over the
years. In 1980 a puma was captured by farmer Ted Noble. It was tamed and
cared for by Eddie Orbell at the Highland Wildlife Park in Aviemore
until its death in 1985. It is now preserved as the prize exhibit at
Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.
The session at which American Heidi Mauracher was demonstrating her
latest wedding photography techniques had been organised by the British
Institute of Professional Photographers.
The institute has hundreds of members in Scotland and is able to award
degree-level qualifications. Its aim is ''to promote higher standards in
professional photography''.
One of the speakers at another recent meeting of the institute, Lawrie
Campbell, was just back from a tour of Chile photographing pumas.

TWELVE neo-Nazi skinheads, including two Scots, were jailed yesterday
for their part in an attack on a left-wing bookshop.
Nottingham Crown Court was told how a gang of 40 skinheads, many
dressed in combat jackets and wearing Nazi insignia, wrecked the
Mushroom Store, a minority bookshop, causing #10,000 of damage on a busy
afternoon in January last year.
The gang terrorised customers to ''amuse themselves'' after a Blood
and Honour gig in London by the skinhead group Skrewdriver was cancelled
by police.
Stephen Bradley, 24, of Belmont Street, Townhead, Coatbridge,
Lanarkshire, who was among those who entered the shop, was jailed for
three years after admitting violent disorder.
Iain Simpson, 28, of Hillhead Road, Kirkintilloch, was among the other
11 jailed for two months after they admitted a lesser charge of
threatening behaviour.
Mr Paul Mann, prosecuting, said because of the cancellation the
skinheads were very upset. ''They chose to travel to Nottingham to amuse
themselves and had a drink in a pub there.''
Two shop assistants and a disabled customer were injured in the
attack. As missiles smashed through the shop windows, 15 other customers
took cover behind bookshelves.
Mr Mann said: ''One of the skinheads, wearing an antique Nazi badge,
took hold of a lady. Three of them began attacking the manager, striking
him in the head and back.''
Judge Richard Benson told the 12 he was sentencing them for their
crimes and not their political views. ''This was an incident of loutish
thuggery,'' he said.
After the hearing violence flared when supporters of the 12 left the
court and clashed with left-wing protesters outside.
One man was seriously injured and taken to hospital after being
attacked by a gang of 30 men chanting anti-Nazi slogans. There was one
arrest.

SHADOW agriculture spokesman, Dr Gavin Strang, and fellow Labour MP,
Mr Eric Clarke, were down on the farm yesterday to find out if
bureaucrats have their heads in the sand.
They visited Carrington Barns near Carrington village in Mr Clarke's
Midlothian constituency to help Mr Hugh Mann cut through the red tape
stopping him and his son, Chris, 28, putting ostrich meat on Scottish
restaurant menus.
The Manns began breeding the birds almost three years ago with a view
to selling their meat and by-products. Their ostrich flock of 10 will
not be ready for slaughter for another couple of years.
Meantime they have been testing the market for the Scottish palate by
providing a few restaurant chefs with supplies imported through Europe
from South Africa.
However the Ministry of Agriculture has said that, although ostrich
meat from South Africa is on European menus, it is banned in the UK
until trade controls are harmonised within Europe in July.
Dr Strang and Mr Clarke are now to raise the issue with officials.

TWO dairy owners accused of producing contaminated milk will have to
wait a month to know their fate.
If found guilty, Robert and Margaret Haston could face a maximum fine
of #20,000 and six months in jail.
At the end of a five-day trial yesterday, Sheriff John Young announced
he would give a written verdict at Linlithgow Sheriff Court on March 23.
He had heard fiscal Linda Ruxton describe management at the Redhouse
Dairy in Blackburn, West Lothian, as a shambles.
She claimed: ''The milk was dirtier than it should have been. There
were poor management practices and a lack of hygiene.''
But defence solicitor Patrick Wheatley told the court: ''There is no
evidence that any milk produced by the Hastons was capable of
administering a lethal blow.''
A total of 69 people were struck down by the bacteria E-coli 0157 in
West Lothian in May and June last year.
One child, 18-month-old Claire Davison, of Bathgate, died. Two others
are still receiving kidney dialysis treatment.

CELTIC player Tommy Boyd has lost a court action for payment of
#50,000 from his former club, Motherwell, the team he captained to
Scottish Cup victory.
The Scottish international defender had claimed the Lanarkshire side
owed him the money following his transfer in 1991 to Chelsea.
But Lord Cameron ruled in a written judgment issued at the Court of
Session yesterday that he was satisfied that Motherwell had met all
their financial obligations to Mr Boyd.
Two English clubs -- Nottingham Forest and Chelsea -- were originally
competing to sign up Boyd at the end of his five-year contract with
Motherwell during the 1991 season.
In January that year the player approached Pro International Ltd, run
by agent Dennis Roach, to act on his behalf in negotiating future
contracts.
After Motherwell won a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against
Morton on March 19, 1991, Chelsea and Nottingham Forest approached then
Motherwell manager Tommy MacLean about the player.
Forest were still in the English FA Cup at the time and were due to
play a semi-final on April 14 in which they hoped to play Mr Boyd. They
offered #750,000 for the player, but Chelsea put in a #800,000 bid.
Lord Cameron said Mr MacLean was anxious at that stage to secure
agreement with Forest as he considered that the deal proposed was a good
one from Motherwell's point of view.
A meeting was arranged for March 27 between the player and the
chairman and vice-chairman of Motherwell, without the player's agent.
The judge said: ''Mr MacLean explained in evidence that the reason for
his preference for dealing direct with Mr Boyd was because he did not
believe in dealing with an agent for a player such as Mr Roach.''
At the meeting Mr Boyd, 29, from Bothwell, Lanarkshire, was offered a
payment of #50,000. Mr Boyd said that he understood that the money would
be available if he left Motherwell on transfer at any time before his
contract was ended.
But in his evidence during the three-day hearing Mr MacLean said it
was a ''take it or leave it'' offer, which was ''off the table'' when
the player did not quickly agree to go to Nottingham Forest.
Lord Cameron said that he preferred Motherwell's version of events --
that the #50,000 offer was made in relation to the proposed move to
Nottingham Forest and that they had wanted a rapid response.
Chelsea pursued their interest in the player and by the middle of May
had agreed to pay #750,000 to Motherwell for Mr Boyd with a further
#50,000 going to the player from the London side. That sum was to be
paid to Motherwell and put through their accounts as a salary payment to
the player.
Representatives of the two clubs, the player and his agent met at the
Excelsior Hotel in Glasgow on May 15. Chelsea warned that they would
pull out of the transfer if a final agreement was not reached that day.
Mr Roach, on behalf of the player, tried to get Motherwell to pay
#100,000 as a condition for the player signing for Chelsea.
The meeting initially broke up without a settlement being reached and
the player and his agent left the hotel.
But the Motherwell chairman phoned Mr MacLean, who could not attend
because of the death of his father, and the Lanarkshire side agreed to
offer #25,000.
Both sides then shook hands on the deal.
The judge said: ''My clear impression of the evidence of Mr Roach was
that he had entered the discussions that day on the assumption, which I
hold to be unfounded in fact, that the (original) offer of #50,000 would
still remain open.''
Lord Cameron said he was satisfied that the #25,000 could only be
understood as being the figure which Motherwell on their own account
would pay the player as a condition of his agreement to the transfer to
Chelsea -- and not #75,000 as the player's agent contended.

NIGEL Mansell issued a warning to his rivals yesterday when McLaren
unveiled their radical new 1995 Grand Prix racing car.
Mansell, who has joined the Mercedes-powered McLaren team for the new
season, took one look at the MP4/10 and said: ''If it goes as quick as
it looks everyone else had better watch out.
''It has obviously been designed and prepared to the limit of the
regulations and I think the job done is very clever. I am very
optimistic.''
The car has a revolutionary central wing positioned immediately behind
the driver's head, right on the limit of legality. It also has a
Benetton-style raised nose.
The unveiling at the Science Museum in London was the third by a major
team in recent weeks after Benetton and Ferrari.

PASSENGERS, the travel industry, and manufacturers were last night
celebrating a ruling by the High Court in London which will allow the
multi-million pound cross-Channel duty-free sales business to continue.
Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel yesterday lost its legal action to
stop its competitors selling duty-free goods.
The High Court took the unusual step of blocking permission given last
July for Eurotunnel to seek a judicial review.
The court ruled the company had delayed too long and failed to meet
time limits imposed for launching such actions.
Eurotunnel is not allowed to sell duty-free goods on its trains
although it has duty-free shops at Folkestone and Calais. It claims its
competitors are enjoying an unfair and discriminatory advantage under
European free trade laws because they can subsidise fares from on-board
sales profits.
Eurotunnel, which is considering whether to renew its application in
the Court of Appeal, is barred by yesterday's decision from taking its
complaint to the European Court of Justice.
Mr John Noulton, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said: ''It
is very disappointing for us, especially as the decision has been taken
on procedural grounds, on grounds of delay.
''The substantive issues which we raised have not been addressed by
the court.''
Mr Barry Goddard, secretary general of the Duty-Free Confederation,
said: ''This result is good news for the millions of travellers
throughout Europe who can continue to enjoy all the benefits of
duty-free and tax-free shopping, including cheaper travel.''

A Royal Navy commander
who admitted negligence in allowing his #92m warship to run aground
was sacked from his post by a court-martial panel yesterday.
Commander Paul Collins -- decorated for flying helicopters during the
Falklands conflict -- allowed an inexperienced colleague to take charge
of navigating the frigate HMS Brazen through notoriously dangerous
waters.
The 37-year-old commander -- described by one admiral as a key figure
in neutralising the Iraqi navy during the Gulf war -- appeared at the
hearing in Portsmouth with navigation officer Lieutenant Matthew Payne,
25, and Lieutenant Sarah Brothwell.
All admitted negligently allowing the ship to be stranded on September
12 last year off the southern tip of Chile.
Collins was dismissed from his present job and Lt Payne was
reprimanded but Lt Brothwell was cleared -- the panel declining to
accept her plea of guilty ''with regards to all the circumstances''.
She had been on the bridge for only eight minutes before the ship ran
aground.
The Type-22 frigate was stuck in a ''nose up'' position and had to be
refloated by two tugs.
Lieutenant Commander Andrew Jameson, prosecuting, said that under
Royal Navy guidelines two officers were required on the bridge at all
times.
''Despite this agreed arrangement, Lt Brothwell was considered of
sufficient experience by the commander to conduct her own watch with
only occasional help from the navigator, even though she had only had
one experience of piloting HMS Brazen,'' he said.
The collision happened shortly after midnight, when the 4100 tonne
ship was doing 14.5 knots, with Lt Brothwell as officer of the watch in
overall control of the ship.
It suffered damage put at #100,000, with the hull and sewage treatment
areas flooded.
Lt Cmdr Jameson said: ''The ship was grounded as a result of an
ill-considered navigation plan that was not properly prepared. The ship
was proceeding at significant speed in confined and unfamiliar waters at
night.''
Cmdr Collins also admitted failing to ensure navigation records were
preserved, while Lt Payne pled guilty to failing to ensure such records
were maintained.

A DISPUTE over Powderhall Stadium in Edinburgh was resolved yesterday,
but owners and trainers still fear that the track will be closed and
redeveloped as a housing and office complex.
Since last month, Mr Eddie Ramsay, the owner of the 70-year-old
greyhound and speedway racing stadium, has been locked in negotiations
with brewers Bass Leisure over a #1.8m debt the company claimed he owed
it.
Last night, Bass said in a brief statement: ''The operators of
Powderhall Stadium, Beaverhall Road, Edinburgh, have now agreed a
refinancing package for the stadium.
''As a result, Bass Leisure can confirm that they have now been
repaid, and no longer have an interest associated with the stadium.''
Racing owners recently withdrew their dogs, claiming they had no
confidence in Mr Ramsay.
Owners and trainers have voiced fears that the stadium will be closed
and have called for another promoter to step in to rescue it.
Mr Ramsay, who recently introduced Sunday racing with receipts higher
than normal weekday events, was not available yesterday to confirm if
racing would continue or whether he had other plans for the stadium.
A spokesman for Powderhall said Mr Ramsay had left for the weekend.
Calls to his home at Pencaitland were unanswered.
One greyhound racing owner and trainer, Mrs Jane Glass, said last
night: ''I do not know what his plans are, but we were hoping that Bass
would repossess it.''

DOCTORS hit out yesterday after a Bill aimed at increasing health
warnings on cigarette packets was defeated.
The president of the Royal College of Physicians, Sir Leslie Turnberg,
spoke out after MP Terry Lewis's Private Member's Bill failed to get a
second reading in the Commons.
He said: ''The college has been advocating more prominent warnings for
many years and we are very disappointed at the failure of this Bill.
''The college's influential Smoking and Health Now report in 1971 was
instrumental in getting the Government to introduce the concept of
warnings on packs, but they are still not big enough . . .
''It is unacceptable that 24 years after our report we are still in
this terrible situation where thousands of people take up smoking every
year without adequate warnings on packs as to the true effect which
smoking can have on their health.''
Mr Lewis's Tobacco Products Labelling Bill aimed to increase the size
of warnings from the existing 6% to at least 25% of the packet's
surface.
But the measure was talked out by MPs opposed to it.
Junior Health Minister Tom Sackville said the Government could not
back the idea because it went ''far beyond what is sensibly required.''

EMPLOYERS used teenagers as ''cheap labour'' and saved #400m last year
by hiring school pupils rather than adult workers, a union said
yesterday.
A report for the GMB said 300,000 people between 16 and 17 had
part-time jobs.
The study found an increasing proportion of schoolchildren were
working part-time -- partly as a result of longer opening hours by shops
and also because more youngsters were staying on at school.
The majority of youngsters (37%) are in the retail trade, followed by
catering, cleaning, or office jobs.
Under 16-year-olds mainly had newspaper delivery rounds although some
were involved in selling or cleaning.
Sainsbury's paid the best rates for 16-year-olds at #3.20 an hour,
followed by Marks and Spencer at #3.17. The worst rates were #1.83 and
#1.94 an hour paid by Shoefayre and Dewhurst, according to the union.
Of the leading retail chains, Superdrug said 18% of its workforce was
under 18, followed by Tesco (12%), Ryman (11%), and Comet (6%). B &amp; Q
said 7% of its workforce was aged 16 or 17.
Mr Bill Brown, a GMB youth spokesman, said: ''We all know young people
are often exploited by employers with low rates of pay and poor working
conditions.
''This study shows there are far more schoolchildren trying to keep up
with their school work as well as holding down part-time jobs. We must
ensure they are paid a fair rate for the job.''
The report, compiled for the union by the Labour Research Department,
is due to be presented to the TUC's youth conference in London today.

<TEXT>
THE Government moved yesterday to end the ban on all Irish republicans
entering Britain.
Exclusion orders against 10 were lifted by the Northern Ireland
Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, while Home Secretary Michael Howard will
consider the cases of more than 50 more.
Hundreds of men and women -- the overwhelming majority republican, but
some loyalists as well -- have been barred from travelling to mainland
Britain because of suspected links with paramilitary organisations.
They included Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, who is now free to go
wherever he likes.
Most of the 10 who are being allowed into Britain have not been named,
but they are thought to live in the Irish Republic. The decision to lift
the bans came after a review of the Northern Ireland Emergency
Provisions Act by British lawyer John Rowe.
It was completed before IRA and loyalist violence stopped.
Sir Patrick, in a Commons written reply, said: ''His recommendations
do not therefore take full account of the new situation which these
events created, nor of the Government's working assumption that the
ceasefires are intended to be permanent.
''The Government's hope is that a lasting peace will prove to be
established and that the need for the exceptional powers provided by
this Act will accordingly be removed.''
Nationalist politicians on both sides of the Irish border said the
decision was linked to the developing peace process, but the Rev Ian
Paisley of the DUP claimed the Government had given in yet again to the
IRA.
He said: ''It is another concession. The Government is now listening
to the threats and making concessions. There is no mention of the guns
and explosives these men still possess. They have the power to kill and
maim.
''The greatest killing machine in western Europe is still in their
control.''
Mr Howard is to announce his decision soon on the 56 exclusion orders
he signed.
Belfast Sinn Fein councillor Alex Maskey, who was once banned himself,
said it was only a small step towards ending repressive measures which
governed Northern Ireland.
He said: ''It is good news, but as far as we are concerned it's almost
akin to being too little too late.
''It is a small step forward, but if they want to show good intention
and good faith, particularly in regard to the peace process, there are a
variety of other measures which they can move on quite easily.''
It was also welcomed by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring who meets
Sir Patrick in Dublin today to finalise details of the British and Irish
framework document on the future of Northern Ireland.
Ulster Unionist unease over proposals to introduce cross-border
institutions as part of any new political arrangement could mean a
boycott of discussions on the framework.
But Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux said he was still prepared
to meet the Prime Minister to discuss his party's own proposals for the
way ahead.
He told BBC Radio Ulster: ''We will have our document ready in advance
of theirs hopefully and that won't be unacceptable to the greater number
of people in Nothern Ireland . . . We will talk to the Government about
those proposals and to other parties as well.''
Labour welcomed Sir Patrick's decision to lift the exclusion orders,
which was taken after security consultations, and urged the Government
to reconsider the need to retain the power to exclude.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said: ''I hope that the Government
will now accept Labour's call for a general review of the powers
contained in the Prevention of Terrorism Act.''
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alan Beith also suggested the
time was approaching when parts of the Act should be reviewed.

FORMER body building champion Michele Caira was jailed for seven years
at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday for drug dealing.
Caira, of High Street, Kirkcaldy, was arrested after crime squad
officers launched a complex surveillance named Operation Hybrid. They
followed him as he supplied drugs and met contacts in central Scotland
in a variety of sports cars.
Caira, 43, a former runner-up in the Mr Universe contest, was found
guilty of being involved in the supply of ecstasy said to be worth about
#2000. The offences took place in Kirkcaldy and Dundee on June 17 last
year.
He was also found guilty of being involved in the supply of cannabis
resin said to have a street value of #40,000. These offences took place
in Leslie and Kincardine, both Fife, between July and August last year.
Caira pled guilty to supplying amphetamine in his home in Kirkcaldy
between November 1993 and February 1994, and offering to supply ecstasy
to two people in Kirkcaldy on the same dates.
Mr John Mair, defence advocate, told the court his client was twice Mr
Scotland, a former British national body building champion, and a
finalist in the Mr Universe contest.
He said that a number of business ventures which Caira had set up had
failed.
Co-accused Gary Mollins, 26, of Maryfield Crescent, Leslie, was jailed
for four years. He was found guilty of being involved in the supply of
cannabis resin in Leslie and Kincardine between July and August last
year.
Drug squad officers saw Mollins throw a blue rucksack from a sports
car driven by Caira. Inside, 33 bars of cannabis resin, with a street
value of #40,000, were recovered.
A third accused, George Davie, 29, a computer operater, of Hill Road,
Arbroath, was jailed for two years. He admitted being involved in the
supply of ecstasy in Riverside Drive, Dundee, on June 17.
At the end of the trial, Lord Cullen praised the police officers who
took part in Operation Hybrid.

A SCOTTISH Office television commercial hammering home the message
that neglecting to maintain domestic smoke alarms costs lives is to be
given a third run.
Resuscitation, which depicts the horror of failed attempts by
firefighters to revive a child rescued from a house fire, was first
shown two years ago, then repeated almost a year later.
The four-week rerun on Scottish, Border, Grampian, and Channel 4,
starting today, stresses the need for regular maintenance and testing of
smoke alarms, and the importance of replacing batteries regularly.
The Chief Inspector of Fire Services for Scotland's annual report for
1993 showed that in 92 fatal house fires -- in which 109 people died --
only 39 houses had smoke alarms, just 21 of which were working.

<HEADLINE>Superquarry 'higher than Arthur's Seat'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979796243</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE proposed #70m coastal superquarry at Lingerbay in Harris would be
one-and-a-half times as high as Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, the public
inquiry into the development was told at Stornoway yesterday.
On display on the 52nd day of the inquiry was a photomontage showing
Arthur's Seat superimposed on the quarry site. It was one of the
productions on display by Scottish Natural Heritage -- the principal
objector to the development.
Giving evidence was Mrs Jane Read, an associate of the Turnbull
Jeffrey Partnership of Edinburgh, which is engaged as independent
landscape consultants by SNH.
She told Miss Gillian Pain, chief inquiry reporter, that after
receiving its visual assessment for the proposed superquarry, SNH became
aware of a general problem in relation to understanding the scale of the
proposed superquarry.
Mrs Read said this was partly due to the majority of photographs of
Lingerbay and Roineabhal hill lacking any objects of known size which
could be used as reference points for scaling purposes.
She said her firm had been asked to produce a comparative illustration
of the proposed superquarry with a well known and readily recognised
landscape feature. Arthur's Seat had been chosen for the purpose.
She explained: ''Originally, it was proposed that we produce a
computer-generated image of Arthur's Seat, but we were able to provide
the comparison directly by superimposing two photographs.
''The photomontage confirms the maximum height of Arthur's Seat at 251
metres, the quarry rim at 375 metres, and Roineabhal at 460 metres.''
Presenting conclusions on the visual assessment, including
consideration of different working levels, Mrs Read said: ''Only when
the highest level of the quarry rim is lowered to 200 metres and 150
metres would the visibility of the superquarry be reduced to areas in
Harris, Skye, and the sea and air routes.
''At 150 metres the visual effect would be 'not significant' from
Skye, but would still be significant from at least one viewpoint on
South Harris, and very significant from te sea and air routes.''
She added: ''Contrary to its popular reputation the area has frequent
periods of excellent visibilty, when South Harris and the island chain
can be readily seen from Skye.
''These occur mainly during the summer, particularly in June, when the
superquarry could be expected to be visible from Skye, at distances of
more than 40km, for 26% of the daylight hours.
''The proposed superquarry is much larger than Arthur's Seat in
Edinburgh, being one-and-a-half times as high. All the elements
associated with the quarry are also enormous. For example, single
buildings 250 metres long which would dwarf nearby crofts.''
The inquiry continues on Tuesday and, during the week, will move on to
hear ballast water evidence.

A SERIAL killer who murdered homosexuals in revenge for contracting
HIV has died from an Aids-related illness, it was revealed yesterday.
Michele Lupo went on an eight-week killing spree in 1986 after
learning he had caught the virus. Each of his four victims was strangled
during sex sessions in derelict buildings and their bodies mutilated.
He was jailed for life at the Old Bailey after admitting the killings
and two other attempted murders.
The court heard the shock of learning he had the disease created a
''callous rationale'' in which Italian-born Lupo developed a hatred for
other homosexuals. He killed as he cruised gay bars in London, after
learning he caught the virus in 1985.
The former fashion boutique owner died at the weekend in the hospital
wing of Frankland Prison, County Durham.
Although classed as a death by natural causes, an inquest will be held
on Monday because it occured in prison.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard met the European immigration controversy
head-on yesterday with the strongest defence so far of Britain's border
control rules.
At the end of a week which has seen the issue close to the top of the
political agenda, he made it clear that Britain was not in the mood for
compromise and would strongly resist European pressure to relax UK
restrictions.
The only concession to the current mood was a statement that since the
Government took office in 1979, it had seen firm policy on immigration
control and good race relations as inseparable.
Mr Howard, speaking to Tories in Wantage, Berkshire, said: ''This
country has an honourable record of providing refuge for people escaping
persecution. We are determined to maintain that record, but the fact is
that the vast majority of those claiming asylum are bogus applicants.
''In most cases they are really economic migrants seeking a better
life than they can find in their own countries. With the best will in
the world, we cannot offer such people a home. We must be robust and
been seen to be robust in denying them settlement if we are to prevent
ever-larger numbers seeking entry.
''The numbers which were decreasing are now growing so rapidly that
they threaten to overwhelm the system. A huge backlog of cases has built
up and the social security bill has grown.
''Under the powers provided under the 1993 Immigration Act, I have
acted this week to simplify and speed up the appeals process. At the
same time, 150 extra immigration officials are to be recruited to handle
applications. This will allow for an extra 7000 cases to be considered
each year.
''These measures taken together will greatly improve the existing
situation. They will mean speedier decisions for genuine applicants and
they will mean speedier deportations for bogus applicants.
''They will also help save the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds in
benefits being paid out to applicants while they wait for their cases to
be heard.''
The Home Secretary made it clear that Britain would not be persuaded
to change its policy on the issue of European border controls.
He said: ''Our geography gives us a particular advantage in
maintaining effective frontier controls. It is an advantage we are
determined to keep and we shall do whatever is necessary to keep it.''

Findlay was one of the first to join the station last September and

THE chairwoman of the Scottish Consumer Council, Mrs Deirdre Hutton,
warned yesterday that the new single-tier councils would not succeed in
improving services unless they put consumers ''first, middle, and last''
in everything they did.
She told a conference of councillors and officials in Edinburgh that
the planned reorganisation had to be seen as an opportunity to improve
local government and service delivery.
''Viewed from the outside, the current agenda looks pretty remote from
the needs of users. We have heard about jobs, geography, and councillors
but not enough about consumers,'' she warned.
Mrs Hutton, who was addressing a conference organised by the East of
Scotland Institute of Public Administration, stressed the importance of
the new councils finding out what their local communities wanted and
using that knowledge in the design of the new authorities and in the
services they sought to provide.

AN anti-English group has targeted Service families at Rosyth naval
base.
In a move condemned as ''cowardly'', members of the minority movement
Scotland Watch waited until dark before leaving racist literature on car
windscreens in the town's Sherbrooke Estate, which is populated
exclusively by Navy families.
The leaflets claim that a ''steady stream of new English settlers''
are grabbing the best houses and jobs, thus forcing Scots to live on
caravan sites and go on to the dole.
Mrs Helen Spear, originally from Yorkshire, moved to the estate six
months ago with her husband, who serves on a fishery protection vessel.
She said yesterday she had never experienced any anti-English feeling
before, and added: ''I can understand Scotland wanting rights and to be
separate from England, but I think this is the wrong attitude.
''It's going to get people's backs up.''
Mrs Helen Walker, one of the leaders of the former Rosyth Naval Wives
Action Group, is concerned at the blatant attempt to stir up
anti-English hostility in an area which is still recovering from the
double blow of Rosyth Royal Dockyard losing the Trident submarine
contract to Devonport and the run-down of the naval base.
She said: ''I read one and then crumpled it up and binned it. This was
a cowardly way of distributing the leaflets, leaving them on cars.''

GUNSHOT victim David Dunn had two bullets in him, but there was only
one wound, the High Court in Edinburgh was told yesterday.
The 63-year-old retired mining engineer must have died within minutes
from the close-range shot to his chest, said a pathologist.
Professor Anthony Busuttil said: ''There was only one entry gunshot
wound where two bullets from a self-loading pistol must have entered
simultaneously in tandem.''
He said the bullets passed through both lungs and the two main
arteries before separating when they struck the left shoulder blade.
Professor Busuttil was giving evidence at the trial of Robert Smith,
33, Gerald McQuade, 40, and Paul Bootland, 25.
They have denied murdering Mr Dunn, from Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on
October 19 last year.
They have also denied attempting to murder Detective Constable John
Duffy, 42, and two other men, John Girdler and Duncan Milliken.
They are also accused of robbing a branch of the Bank of Scotland in
the town of #185,000.
The trial continues.

A MAN who robbed a 75-year-old woman in her home expects to serve a
prison sentence in solitary confinement.
Andrew Hayes, 33, fears that other prisoners will attack him.
He had already served a seven-year sentence in solitary after being
convicted of sodomy, the High Court in Glasgow was told.
Advocate Edgar Prais, defending, said: ''He has an appalling record
and he expects to be kept in strict solidary confinement again.''
Hayes, of Ferguslie Park Avenue, Paisley, was jailed for four years
after admitting robbing the woman of household items.
His denial that he raped her in her home in Govan was accepted by the
Crown half-way through his trial.
The woman told the court that Hayes had attacked her at night after
forcing his way into her home, where she lived alone.

Teacher Sara
Jobling's week with a police drugs squad quickly paid off when she
spotted a pupil peddling cannabis in her school playground.
The 36-year-old biology mistress had been seeing how detectives probe
narcotics crime to help her with a health education project.
Her own drugs-busting operation at Southmoor Comprehensive,
Sunderland, led to a boy of 15 being disciplined by the school.
''After spending a week with drugs squad officers, working under cover
with them, I spotted straight away what was going on,'' said Ms Jobling,
who is thinking of becoming a special constable.
She added: ''My credibility among pupils has shot up, and I have also
been able to share my knowledge with other staff.''
Head teacher Mike Crook said many pupils were so streetwise that only
someone with first-hand experience could get through to them.
Detective Superintendent Dave Wilson said this was the first time a
teacher had been allowed to work so closely with the squad, as much of
its activities were carried out covertly and were dangerous.

SOLICITOR Margo Stevens and advocate Vincent Connor, above, made light
of their rivalry at the Royal Scottish Geographical Society's Great Time
Trial yesterday.
The argument presented by leading advocates during a mock trial in the
Burgh Court Hall in Glasgow's John Street was whether British clocks
should move one hour forward and fall in line with Europe.
But despite the conviction of Mr Connor in support of Daylight Extra
Now's campaign to wind clocks on, the jury -- made up of society members
-- voted 9-3 to retain the status quo.
Those who defended against 60 minutes of change, led by advocate James
Taylor, were jubilant. However, some jury members were moved to vote for
the defence.
The attitude of Mr Angus Crichton-Millar, director of the Rank
Organisaton and a vocal member of Daylight Extra Now, was said to be
influential in convincing the jury to vote against his proposals.
He said: ''I have spoken to several members of the jury who said that
they all agreed that our case was the stronger and the better presented
but that we didn't have enough Scottish accents.''
Daylight Extra Now's argument for Euro-time is that lighter nights
would be noticeable all year round and result in fewer accidents and
boost tourism and business.
Those who opposed the change, including Dr Gregor Hutchison, said it
would result in dangerously dark mornings for schoolchildren and
farmers, and could increase accidents.
On the result, Dr Hutchison said: ''We're delighted. There has been a
big lobby on the other side with a lot of press and we are very pleased
to have stemmed the tide.''

<TEXT>
THE net was closing last night on the thugs responsible for the Dublin
soccer riot after angry English fans jammed a special hooligan hotline.
More than 500 calls were logged within 24 hours from ''true fans''
offering information, including names and addresses, on the hooligans,
many of whom were caught on film.
The Football Association said everyone identified as being involved in
the riot would be banned from England matches.
Spokesman Mike Parry said the FA was toughening up the way it assessed
evidence before blacklisting thugs. ''We will no longer be giving anyone
the benefit of the doubt,'' he added.
The backlash came as the first of those arrested on Wednesday were
jailed by a Dublin court.
Stephen Sloan, 21, and Stephen Kearns, 23, from Birmingham, were
sentenced to two months after admitting causing a breach of the peace.
They were later freed on bail after being given leave to appeal.
The pair -- and a third man who was fined -- were arrested on Thursday
after two of them were recognised from newspaper photographs which
showed them attacking a steward.
While the English FA was seeking to reassure, the recriminations began
in Dublin, where the Irish police trade union criticised security on
Wednesday night.
English police passed on detailed warnings and information about the
troublemakers -- including seat numbers and travel arrangements -- but
little action apparently was taken in advance by the Gardai.
Mr John Ferry, of the Garda Representative Association, said: ''If
police here knew in advance that thugs were on the way, and that
information was not passed on to the football authorities, then somebody
has to answer a very serious question indeed.''
Meanwhile, footballer ''hard man'' Vinnie Jones has apologised for his
attack on a newspaper reporter. Jones said he had been drinking
champagne at breakfast in a Dublin hotel before sinking his teeth into
Daily Mirror reporter Ted Oliver's nose.
Mr Oliver said the attack caused a fountain of blood to squirt from
his nose.
He said Jones shook him ''like a dog with a dead rabbit'' before
telling him: ''I always do that to people I like.''
An FA spokesman said reports of the incident would be investigated.

<TEXT>
A FINANCIAL consultant, who claimed that sexual harassment by
colleagues led to her being admitted to a psychiatric hospital, has had
her complaint rejected by an industrial tribunal in Glasgow.
Mrs Deborah Lindsay, 31, from Kirkintilloch, took Allied Westminster
and Co Ltd to the tribunal, claiming men at the company's Clydebank
office ''made her life hell''.
However, Mr Peter Welsh, the firm's former office manager, and Mr Mike
Preston, a London-based sales director, denied sex discrimination.
Mr Welsh, 32, who gave up his manager's post to return to a sales job
as a result of Mrs Lindsay's complaint, said: ''My conscience was clear.
I was only in the frame because of my position as manager. I hope she
gets the help she needs to get better.
''I thank God the tribunal was there to see fair play. It has restored
my faith in a lot of things. This is something I am happy to get over
with and get on with my life.''
Mr Welsh had told the tribunal that Mrs Lindsay had put her hands up
men's kilts and groped them at a Christmas party, and how he had had his
bottom felt.
He also claimed she asked men in kilts to remove their boxer shorts
and went into the gent's lavatories.
Mrs Lindsay claimed office colleagues told dirty jokes, used filthy
language, and would give women visitors marks out of 10 for their looks.
She also claimed they made personal remarks about her underwear, the
size of her breasts, asked her what female condoms were like, and
suggested she should go out and buy one so they could see for
themselves.
Mrs Lindsay, who was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for three days
following a breakdown, told the 11-day tribunal hearing how she ended up
in tears at work every day, and would scream, bawl, have tantrums, and
throw things.
A psychiatrist who examined her said she was suffering from an
''adjustment reaction'' which was a less severe form of post traumatic
stress disorder. He said her sexual harassment claims would have been
enough to trigger her breakdown.
In its written decision, which runs to more than 60 pages, the
tribunal found Mrs Lindsay had not been discriminated against on the
grounds of her sex and dismissed her complaint.

<FLAG>THE RAIL DISPUTE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>979796258</RECORDNO>

SCOTTISH local authority transport chiefs yesterday agreed to lobby
Parliament over the threat to rail services, although there is no
guarantee they will be able to meet members of the House of Commons
Transport Committee.
The committee has asked only for written evidence from the Convention
of Scottish Local Authorities.
However, members of Cosla's roads and transportation committee meeting
in Edinburgh decided the issue was so important they would send a
deputation to Westminster in the hope the Commons committee would see
them.
Cosla's committee chairman, Walter McLellan, said the resignation of
ScotRail chief Chris Green reflected the seriousness of the situation
and must emphasise to everyone in Scotland just how great the pressure
was on the country's services.
He said Mr Green was a man who wanted to run a railway and believed he
could do so even within a privatised situation, but obviously it had
become apparent to him he could not.
Councillor McLellan added: ''Any cut in the service or timetable in
Scotland poses a significant threat to the whole of the Scottish rail
network. Given that threat, Cosla must go forward and do all we can to
support the retention of existing services and timetable in Scotland.''
Among those in the delegation heading south next month will be
Councillor George Barnes, of Grampian region, and Councillor William
Brand, convener of Cosla's economic affairs committee.
Meanwhile, a full-scale inquiry was under way last night into how
thieves bypassed Government security to break into the Department of
Transport headquarters in London.
It is understood they stole computer hard disks and valuable memory
chips which could contain confidential information, including
commercially sensitive details on British Rail privatisation and road
building plans.
One civil servant claimed that vital information may have been lost
for good, with the threat of chaos in some areas of the department.
A spokesman for the department refused to confirm or deny the claim
that there was no back-up for the information on the stolen disks and
chips.
The intruders managed to get on to the floor on which Ministers have
their offices at the Marsham Street complex. There and on other floors
they vandalised a number of computers and stole parts from them in the
raid which was discovered by a security patrol on Thursday night.
Another civil servant claimed the raiders appeared to have targeted
floors dealing mainly with planning and building of roads.
A spokesman for the Department of Environment, which is responsible
for the security of the complex, said last night: ''We will be looking
to see exactly what went wrong and each department is holding its own
investigation.''
Police were called immediately after night patrols discovered the
break-in. They took away film from security cameras and spent all day
taking forensic evidence.
Asked whether an urgent review of the security of Government buildings
was under way, a Downing Street spokesman replied: ''We will have to
wait and see what the police say about the nature of the break-in.''

STRIKERS yesterday forced more than 50 branches of the Clydesdale Bank
to close as they staged a one-day walkout.
They warned that a second 24-hour strike would go ahead on Monday,
February 27, if the bank did not resume pay negotiations next week.
Leaders of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union declared the
strike, the first in the Clydesdale's history, a success and estimated
that about 3000 of its 4000 members on the staff had taken part. But
that estimate was almost triple the figure given by the bank.
In addition to closing many of Clydesdale's 309 branches, the strike
reduced ''scores of others'' to providing only a limited service,
according to Bifu.
The response had been particularly strong in Glasgow, where hundreds
of head office, cash, computer, and clearing staff had joined the
action. Money deliveries had been turned away from the bank's cash
centre, said the union.
A third of the staff at the Aberdeen service centre had also joined
the strike, and cash machines in the Aberdeen area had been able to
offer only a limited service to customers.
Mr Keith Brookes, Bifu assistant secretary, said: ''We have severely
disrupted the Clydesdale Bank and we hope the bank will take a salutary
lesson from this.
''We are asking them to return to negotiations and talk to this union
in a proper way about pay,'' he added.
Mr Brookes estimated that the ''conflict created by the bank today''
had cost the Clydesdale between #500,000 and #1m. ''It could be more.
The conflict is costing them more than the price of a settlement.''
He added: ''This is the first strike the Clydesdale Bank has had. I
would like to think it could be the last. But that is up to the bank's
negotiators. The bank has the solution to the dispute.''
Mr Leif Mills, Bifu's general secretary, urged the bank to attend more
talks next week.
He stated in a letter to the bank's chief executive, Mr Frank Cicutto:
''The dispute is about the way the bank treats staff, the cavalier
attitude of the bank to the union, the whole performance ethos of the
bank, and the pay issue.''
The bank is pressing ahead with a pay package which, it says, will
mean rises of between 3.5% and 7.5% for employees whose performance is
satisfactory or above.
But Bifu says this leaves between 5% and 10% of staff with either no
pay rise or very little. It is seeking a 4% increase for all staff, with
a further payment linked to performance.
According to figures released by the bank yesterday, the strike closed
52 branches. It said only 1199 employees had elected to strike -- less
than 30% of Bifu's claimed membership at the Clydesdale, and less than
20% of the overall staff.
Mr Pat Lennon, the bank's head of human resources, said: ''This is a
strike that should never have happened.
''I would hope that Bifu would seriously reconsider its position and
not go ahead with another strike. More than 70% of the people the union
says are members have clearly rejected the strike action call.
''If the union believes in democracy, it must understand the clear
message its members have given it today.''
Asked if the Clydesdale was prepared to hold further talks, he said:
''The bank will always be willing to accept an invitation from the Acas
conciliation service.''
But he added the union had to enter into the conciliation process
wholeheartedly, and claimed it had failed to do that at talks held at
Acas earlier this week.

A HISTORIC ruling on miscarriages of justice by Scotland's leading
judge is already under threat, despite being issued only last week.
The Lord Justice Clerk, the country's second senior judge, yesterday
cast doubt on the decision by Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, which
was interpreted by some lawyers as opening up the floodgates to
miscarriage of justice appeals.
Lord Ross made it clear that some judges had doubts as to whether Lord
Hope's ruling in the case of Alan Church was correct.
The law will now be considered by a Bench of five judges, which will
inevitably include both Lord Hope and Lord Ross.
The issue involves appeals taken on the basis that additional evidence
has emerged following a conviction which would have had a signficant
effect on the deliberations of the jury had it been available at the
trial.
Until the Church case last week, it was accepted that an appeal based
on additional evidence would be allowed only if the evidence was not
available at the trial and could not reasonably have been made so.
However, last Firday, Lord Hope, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and
Brand, ruled that an appeal could go ahead as long as the convicted
person could provide a reasonable excuse for failing to lead the
evidence at the trial.
In the case of Church, jailed for eight years for a building society
robbery, it was accepted that the video enhancement evidence he was now
seeking to lead was available at the trial. Despite that, the appeal
court agreed that additional evidence could be led at a future hearing.
Yesterday, Mr Paul McBride appeared at the appeal court representing
Angus Elliott, who was jailed for life last year at the High Court in
Kirkcaldy for the killing of Miss Irene Martin, his policewoman partner.
Elliott has now lodged an appeal involving the question of additional
evidence, and Mr McBride explained to the court yesterday that since
Elliott's appeal had been lodged the Church decision had been issued.
That might have a bearing on Elliott's appeal and a number of others.
Lord Ross commented: ''I have to say that some members of this court
have some doubts about the case of Church and are wondering whether the
case may have to be reconsidered.
''If there are questions about Church, the sooner they are resolved
the better.''
The Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, appeared in person
yesterday for the Elliott appeal, and told the court that in his view
the question of fresh evidence cases now had to be reconsidered by five
judges.
That should be done irrespective of whether the Church case had been
correctly decided because it conflicted with an earlier decision in 1987
which the Crown had cited to oppose Church's appeal.
Lord Ross, sitting with Lords McCluskey and Morison, said: ''We have
come to the conclusion that what the Lord Advocate says is well-founded.
''This case will therefore be continued for a hearing by a Bench of
five judges in view of the desirability of reconsidering the case of
Church.''

A SHERIFF ruled yesterday that there had been no contempt of court by
The Herald by publication of a photograph of an accused during a trial
at Elgin Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Donald Booker-Milburn had ordered The Herald editor, Mr George
McKechnie, to appear before him yesterday when it was brought to his
attention that The Herald had published a photograph of the Rev James
Scott on January 13, midway through his trial on a charge of assaulting
a 12-year-old girl.
Mr Scott was ultimately cleared of the charge.
The issue had been raised by procurator-fiscal James McKay, and
Sheriff Booker-Milburn ordered Mr McKechnie to explain his position on
what he said was a possible contempt of court.
However, at Elgin Sheriff Court yesterday Mr McKechnie did not appear,
having written to ask to be excused, and was represented by solicitor Mr
Martin Smith.
The sheriff told him: ''Having considered the matter further it is my
feeling there was no contempt in the terms of the Act.
''I was quite satisfied at the time that the matter of identification
was not an issue in the trial at all.''
Mr Smith said: ''Your lordship has said exactly what I was going to
say. The Rev Scott's case had been followed closely and legal advice had
been taken as to whether or not it was proper to use the photograph.''
He said there was no question of identification as the accused had
confirmed he was the individual and the only question was whether his
conduct was criminal.
''In these circumstances my clients felt they would not be breaching
any law by publishing the photograph,'' Mr Smith added.

POOLS company Littlewoods announced yesterday that it intends to cut
nearly 600 jobs but stressed that the National Lottery was not to blame.
The firm, which employs around 4000 people, wishes to make the cuts
through voluntary redundancy. An enhanced compensation package is being
offered.
More than 600 people are employed at Littlewoods' base in Glasgow and
it is thought between 80 and 85 may go there.
Although the pools industry has suffered badly since the launch of the
lottery, the Liverpool-based firm said the cuts followed an 18-month
review of business operations.
It said the study recommended a number of areas where it could achieve
significant savings if business practices were improved and more new
technology introduced.
The company confirmed that any savings achieved would be passed on to
its customers with bigger prize pay-outs.
A series of staff meetings were held last week at four of the
company'ssites in Glasgow, Liverpool, Birkenhead, and Cardiff, at which
details of the job losses were announced.
A spokesman said more than 200 staff had already expressed an interest
in voluntary redundancy and the company remained confident it would gain
the necessary numbers.
He added: ''We are working in full co-operation with the trade unions,
who believe we can do this through voluntary means. We certainly hope we
can do that.''
Although the company has lost 10% of its business since the launch of
the lottery, Littlewoods believes it will be able to regain it.
The Government recently changed the rules to allow the pools industry
to compete on more equal terms with lottery promoters Camelot over
advertising and paying out winners in shops.

THE Prime Minister moved to reassure Ulster Unionists last night that
forthcoming documents on the future of Northern Ireland would not be a
nationalist agenda.
He insisted they would be ''fair and balanced proposals'' put forward
merely as a basis for negotiation.
Mr Major was replying to three Ulster Unionists who wrote to him
protesting he was operating to a ''one-sided nationalist agenda''.
They fear the Government has secretly sold out to Dublin over
cross-border institutions with executive powers.
Mr Major's letter to the Unionists last night comes on the eve of
another meeting between Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and deputy
Irish premier Dick Spring.
They hope to reach the end of negotiations to draft a framework
document charting the way forward for Northern Ireland's political
parties. Success will open the way for a summit between Mr Major and
Irish counterpart John Bruton formally to launch the document --
possibly in London before the end of next week.
In his letter, Mr Major wrote: ''As I have said many times, I fully
support the Union. It is in no sense my aim to see it dismantled.
''The papers we put forward will be neither a Unionist agenda nor a
nationalist agenda but fair and balanced proposals as a basis for
negotiation.
''Taken together, they will be intended to recognise the interests of
both sections of the community. If they represented only one point of
view they of course would not achieve their purpose of encouraging
further discussion by all participants and progress towards agreement.''
Mr Major ended his letter by inviting the Unionists to discuss the
proposals in further talks when the documents are published.

THE driver of a high-powered car which knocked down and killed a
13-year-old boy ''playing chicken'' on a busy road has been cleared of
blame for the youngster's death.
Barry Davies died about 8.30pm on October 14, 1990, after he was
knocked down crossing the road at Easthouses, Dalkeith, Midlothian.
The car which knocked him down was a white Ford Escort XR3 Turbo being
driven by Mr Allan McGuire, then 24, of Parkhead Crescent, Easthouses.
The dead boy's parents, Stephen and June Davies, of Parkhead Park,
Easthouses, sued Mr McGuire at the Court of Session. They blamed him for
their son's death, claiming that he had been driving too fast and not
keeping a proper lookout.
Mr McGuire claimed that the accident had been entirely the boy's
fault. He said that Barry had been ''playing chicken'' with cars by
running across the road in front of approaching vehicles. The driver
maintained that he had been unable to avoid hitting the boy.
Lord Gill, who issued a written judgment yesterday, said that he found
Mr McGuire to be a straightforward and credible witness and accepted his
evidence that he was travelling within the 40mph limit.
The judge added that an accident reconstruction expert put the car's
speed at about 20-25mph at the point of impact.
''I conclude that Mr McGuire was not travelling at an excessive
speed,'' said Lord Gill.
The next question he had to decide, said the judge, was whether the
driver had been keeping a good lookout.
Lord Gill said that Barry had been one of a group of boys who had been
crossing back and forward across the road, several times. Mr Vijay
Pandya, then manager of a nearby pub, had given evidence that for about
half an hour youths were running across the road in both directions,
causing oncoming drivers to brake.
He said he had seen Barry do that three or four times.
The judge ruled that the driver's blamelessness was beyond doubt.
''I infer that two minutes after Mr Pandya went inside (the pub) the
deceased was still doing what he had been doing for the previous half
hour, namely running headlong across the road into the path of oncoming
traffic.
''This confirms me in the conclusion that the accident was caused by
the sole fault of the deceased.''
If Barry's parents had succeeded in their claim, the judge would have
awarded them damages of #7500 each.
Later yesterday, the boy's father declined to comment, stating that he
had not been officially informed of the decision by the solicitor.
Mr McGuire, who lives only a few streets away, was not available for
comment.

THE senior manager sent north by British Rail to replace Mr Chris
Green as director of ScotRail has been warned by unions and Opposition
politicians not to bring his macho management techniques with him.
Mr Green's resignation became official yesterday when it was announced
that he had been appointed as chief executive of English Heritage, the
Government body which conserves England's historic monuments and
gardens.
One senior rail union official said that if the Government ran down
the railways any further, Mr Green might end up in charge of them again
as part of English Heritage.
BR acted swiftly to dampen the criticism of Mr Green's departure by
immediately naming Mr John Ellis, Railtrack's production director, as
the man in charge at ScotRail. He was general manager at ScotRail for
two years in the late eighties.
Since then he has been general manager Southern Region and then deputy
managing director of InterCity before joining Railtrack in 1993.
Mr Ellis yesterday admitted Mr Green's departure had come as a ''very
speedy and surprising development'', but said it would not scupper the
privatisation of ScotRail.
He added: ''I think many railway managers would not have regarded this
as being the best structure of privatisation. But I think, generally
speaking, you will find we believe it is our responsibility to manage
the industry as professionally as we possibly can.''
He thought Mr Green's ''disappointment'' dated back to his failure to
persuade the Government to keep InterCity together as an entity.
Restructuring of the industry could provide benefits by introducing
contractual relationships between its various components, and it could
be made to work, he added.
During the signal workers' dispute last year the unions became
concerned when Mr Ellis became the main spokesperson to put over the
management line. He claimed frequently that many signal workers were
defying the union and returning to work -- a claim the union involved,
Aslef, strongly denied.
One union official described him as the mouth of macho management,
attempting to replicate the coal board's strategy of claiming a drift
back to work, but without achieving the same amount of success.
Aslef's general secretary, Mr Lew Adams, said yesterday: ''ScotRail,
as any other train operating company, cannot do with losing managers of
the calibre of Chris Green.
''We only hope that his replacement does not follow the policy of
macho management which he demonstrated during his time at Railtrack.''
Labour's industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, expressed similar fears.
''As far as the ScotRail staff are concerned, John Ellis will have to
overcome the memories of his role as Railtrack's mouthpiece during last
year's dispute.
''I think he was just finally sickened by these huge budget cuts which
ScotRail are having imposed on them.''
Meanwhile, the criticism following Mr Green's sudden departure
continued to reverbrate in Scotland. Although he has said little about
his departure, it is regarded as an indication of his frustration at
trying to run a rail service in Scotland while being denied the proper
funds by Government to do the job properly.
Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy has called on Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang to make a statement in the House of Commons over where the
proposed privatisation of Scotland's railways now stands.
''We know that the timetable has already slipped severely, now the key
individual has departed. This disaster must be stopped before it goes
any further,'' Mr Kennedy said.
The SNP's transport spokesperson, Mr Keith Brown, claimed that Mr
Green's departure was a ''stunning vote of no confidence'' in the
Government's plans.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT transport union, described the
resignation as a ''massive vote of no confidence'' in the Government's
rail privatisation programme.
''The irony is that, initially, Chris Green believed he could make
privatisation work, and for him to walk away now is an indication of the
total disarray that the Government has created in the industry,'' he
added.
The general view is that the Government wanted Mr Green out because of
his vocal complaints that he was not being given the resources required.
The fear now is that Mr Ellis will be more amenable to toeing the
Government line, and pressing on with the run-up to privatisation.
In his favour is the fact that he has spent all his working life on
the railways, albeit in management, and that will be welcomed by staff
who were concerned that someone with less rail experience would have
been brought in.
The Department of Transport tried to play the resignation down, saying
that it would make no difference to the privatisation programme.
''A job change is obviously a matter for Mr Green's own decision. BR
has different managers all the time, so I don't think it will make any
difference. It's just a change of managers,'' said a spokesperson.
Mr Green was on leave when the announcement was officially made
yesterday, saying little more than that he believed the ''time was
ripe'' for him to make the move.
In a letter to all ScotRail staff, he praised their professionalism,
dedication, and commitment to an industry he had been proud to serve.
However he said his new job allowed him to combine his life-long
interest in history and heritage with the challenge of heading a public
sector organisation of such international importance.
His salary at English Heritage will be between #66,000 to #80,000 a
year -- similar to what he earned at ScotRail -- but the job
satisfaction is now likely to be greater, which supporters of Scotland's
railways say is of great regret.

M77 PROTESTERS plan to burn wrecked cars in an elaborate sculpture
they call Carhenge this weekend.
Four ruined cars have already been embedded, bonnet first, in concrete
in the route of the M77 at Pollok, and 20 English sympathisers drove up
overnight on Wednesday bringing three vehicles for an extension of the
display.
One Oxford environmentalist, who gave him name as Ceri, drove his Ford
Cortina two-litre, a family present, north to burn it.
He said: ''This car is a typical gas guzzler and is responsible for
seriously polluting the environment. It was never going to pass its MoT
so I thought what better could I do with it than make it into art,
decrying our obsession with the car.''
The other cars, driven north from Brighton, include a Vauxhall
Cavalier estate and another large hatchback. The protesters plan to
embed them in concrete, soak them in petrol, then set them alight in a
ceremony described as ''a shamanistic exorcism of the evil of the car''.

A MAN who threatened to shoot a bar manager after his drinking
companions were told to leave a pub was jailed for five years yesterday.
George McGuinness, 28, of Couther Quadrant, Airdrie, admitted
presenting a home-made firearm to the manager of the Quarry Inn in the
Lanarkshire town on December 30 last year.
He also admitted firearms charges when he appeared at the High Court
in Edinburgh.
Advocate-depute Scott Brady said McGuinness and two other men had been
served drink in the bar.
However, when the manager came on duty he asked one of them to leave
as he was barred.
He also told the other man to get out as he was wearing a Celtic
jacket and football colours had been banned.
McGuinness brought out an object made from an air rifle barrel. A
weapons expert thought it could fire a .22 cartridge. He said: ''You
picked the wrong guy to mess with.''

BRITISH Gas workers last night pledged to fight attempts to cut their
pay and announced plans for a national demonstration to protest against
the 75% rise paid to chief executive Cedric Brown.
A national conference of workers, who belong to Unison, also voted to
submit pay claims aimed at keeping pace with inflation.
Delegates representing 30,000 British Gas workers said they would
resist any compulsory redundancies among the 25,000 jobs being axed by
the company.
Mr Brown's controversial pay rise, which increased his salary to
#475,000, was strongly criticised at the London conference where
delegates agreed to organise a demonstration at the British Gas annual
meeting in April.
Delegates agreed a motion which read: ''Unison pickets should
concentrate on exposing the double standards and injustice of the huge
board pay rises and the proposed salary and conditions cut for staff.''
Mr Dave Stirzaker, the union's national officer for the gas industry,
said: ''British Gas must be the only company in the world to increase
the salary of their executives for turning a profit into a loss last
year, demoralising their staff, and seeing a doubling in the number of
complaints from consumers.''
Mr Stirzaker said they were looking for a rise of at least the current
rate of inflation.

PRIME Minister John Major and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke tried
yesterday to brush off questions over Cabinet splits on Europe, while in
the background it remained clear there were deep divisions within Tory
ranks.
Former Chancellor Norman Lamont stoked up trouble with a speech in
which he said that a single currency would inevitably lead to a federal
Europe. European Commissioner and former Tory Minister Sir Leon Brittan
warned that interest rates would soar in Britain if a decision was taken
not to join other EU nations in a single currency, and former Tory
chairman Sir Norman Fowler said debate on the single currency had become
''hysterical''. He added his voice to those calling for for a referendum
on the issue.
Mr Major, on a visit to Cambridgeshire, was asked by reporters if the
Chancellor's position was unassailable.
He said: ''I'm not going to waste my time with trivial nonsenses like
that sort of question. The reality is that there are some very serious
issues to be considered in terms of European policy. We are considering
them -- short-term issues and long-term issues.
''We're absolutely clear that the balance of advantage lies in us
playing a full part in the European Union, in advancing the British case
in the European Union, making sure the European Union is deregulated,
making sure that it's enlarged.''
Other decisions would be taken ''as we have to'' and in ''what we
believe to be the interests of the country''.
Mr Clarke, on a visit to Wales, insisted there was no split on Europe
between him and Mr Major and denied he had been ''gagged'' on the issue.
''We've run out of ways of making clear there aren't any divisions.
I've had another week where people are going for tedious textual
analysis, he said.
''Last night the Prime Minister and I put out -- he sent it -- a
letter to Gordon Brown (Shadow Chancellor) explaining for the umpteenth
time that we're agreed on this.
''The Prime Minister and myself have gone practically blue in the face
telling people how much we agree because we and the rest of the Cabinet
work on this policy together. It is just exasperating when people pick
up words about a policy on something which, if it happens, isn't going
to happen before 1999 anyway.'' Mr Clarke urged the press to ''give it a
rest'' over Europe.
Mr Lamont, however, fuelled the fire, stating: ''Once we have the
single currency, it would be irreversible and irrevocable. For this
reason, even if the other countries of Europe go ahead with a single
currency, we should not participate but wave them goodbye and wish them
well.''
Criticising the European Court of Justice -- over which Britain had
''no control at all'' -- Mr Lamont said: ''In complaining about the
court, we are really complaining about the nature of the EU itself, and
acknowledging that the treaties we have signed gave too much away.
''Standing still on an escalator does not stop it. We need to get off
the escalator altogether.''
He insisted: ''Britain must make clear that it will not hand over any
more of its rights to Europe. We should say 'no' to a single currency,
'no' to the future of political integration and 'no' to further powers
to the European Parliament and the European Commission.
''We must recognise we may not be able to stop other countries
agreeing amongst themselves that they want closer political union.
''If that happens we will need special arrangements for Britain.
Whether that means that Britain remains a full member of the European
Union or the Economic Area is a secondary issue. What matters is
restoring the right of the people of this country to say how Britain
should be governed,'' Mr Lamont added.
Sir Leon Brittan said: ''If our partners do create a single currency
and we decide, when the time comes, to stay out, it is likely we would
pay an interest rate surcharge as a result. Outside the EU, our domestic
economy would inevitably be less stable, our currency more subject to
the attacks of speculators, and our interest rates higher.''
Sir Norman Fowler said: ''I believe we should commit ourselves to a
referendum on the single currency. It would allow industry and business
to put their views, it would allow the public to weigh up the arguments
on what it would mean for them, both politically and economically in
terms of jobs.''
Labour, meanwhile, sought to make maximum capital out of the
Government's predicament. Labour leader Tony Blair spoke of a ''fault
line'' running from No 10 to No 11 Downing Street and right through the
party, which he said had momentous consequences for the governance of
the country.
By refusing to state a position, Mr Major was simply a ''don't know,''
hopelessly trying to straddle two ultimately irreconcilable positions
within his party. Labour believed in a policy of ''constructive
engagement,'' which was the only serious alternative to retreating to
Europe's margins.
