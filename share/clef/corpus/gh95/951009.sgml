Heriot's FP 21, Boroughmuir 30
BOROUGHMUIR'S formidable forwards made their rolling mauls a highly
contributive feature of their impressive rally from 14-3 down to a
merited win at Goldenacre. Heriot's FP had lost some direction with the
injury departure after 15 minutes of their New Zealzand stand-off Terry
Rahui.
Not only had Rahui potted three penalty goals towards that early
Heriot's lead but he was the catalyst in midfield operations that
exploited the intrusive power of the 16st Stuart Lang, who was deprived
by obstruction of one follow-up try.
Heriot's placed a heavy burden on Rahui's replacement, Donald Fowler,
by loading him with the goal kicking duty. He missed three. Nor was the
leggy Campbell Aitken totally at ease as stand-off, although he had a
major constructive role in David Officer's try for that 14-3 lead after
23 minutes.
The Heriot's forwards were set an abrasive example by Tam McVie and
stood up well to being pounded by Boroughmuir's rolling smuggling play,
in which Stuart Reid proved a vibrant spearhead and Neil Dickson
materialised time and again to mighty support effect.
The Heriot's scrummage held its own but they must have the prayer mat
out for the return after back damage of Andrew Macdonald to boost their
lineout return. Yet Gordon Lawrie straightened at pace and Tony Glasgow
has that invaluable sizzle in take-off that launched a sensational
break-out for Lang's blazing late try.
Derek Stark showed that touch of class in the creation and scoring of
his own try. He fastened on to loose ball and drifted inwards out of
grasping hands to launch David Laird and Iwan Tukalo. Stark then
appeared like a friendly genie tight to the left touchline, took
Tukalo's timed feed, hinted inwards, floated outwards then subtly
changed pace for a gem of a score.
The second, third, and fourth of Bryan Easson's six penalty goals had
sparked the Boroughmuir revival, Stark's try put them ahead for the
first time at 17-14, and Beveridge's burrowing score, converted by
Easson, after Reid had driven close, made sure, although that
scintillating Glasgow-Lang effort over 80 metres brought the stand to
its feet. This was counter attack par excellence.
The 19-year-old Alasdair Cadzow had driven close from a scrummage but
as the ball squirted loose Glasgow exploded out of a seemingly
unpromising situation and a pitch length later Lang dived to score in
Tukalo's tackle. Aitken was thus inspired to convert from the touchline
with the goal kick of the day.
Heriot's FP -- S D Lang; C K Aitken, A C Glasgow, G M Lawrie, D G
Officer; T Rahui, F R McMillan; M W Livvingstone, K S Milne, S W Paul, C
Humphries, P T Young, I M Shand, T A McVie, G F Dall. Replacements -- D
S Fowler for Rahui(15 mins); J G Bryce for Shand (71 min); C E Turnbull

Graham for Wright (67 min).

A BRITISH scientific expedition to the crocodile-infested Blue Nile is
to search for the unknown grave of a Scottish SAS corporal killed in the
river 27 years ago.
Corporal Ian Macleod was swept to his death as he tried to cross the
river on a rope during the first successful attempt to survey unknown
parts of the river in 1968. His body is thought to have been recovered
by Ethiopians.
The search party, led by explorer Colonel John Blashford-Snell, left
Britain on Friday for Ethiopia, taking a simple plaque to Corporal
Macleod from Govan, Glasgow. They are also on reconnaissance for a major
scientific expedition next year.
Bearing the badges of the Black Watch and the SAS, which Corporal
Macleod later joined, the cast bronze plaque reads: ''In loving memory
of Corporal Ian Angus Macleod, the Black Watch, 1941 - 1968. A caring,
remarkable, and adventurous young man from Scotland who was drowned near
here on September 18, 1968, while a member of the Great Abbai
Expedition.'' Great Abbai is the Ethiopian name for the Blue Nile.
According to Colonel Blashford-Snell, who also led the 1968
expedition, Corporal Macleod disappeared when he was swept over a
cataract in a deep gorge after volunteering to get a line across the
swollen Abaya tributary to the Blue Nile.
It was only later that the party realised the leg injury Corporal
Macleod had suffered earlier in the expedition was far worse than he had
said. As a paramedic, he had been treating himself with large quantities
of antibiotics but had not told anyone.
They later learned that during the dry season a body had been
recovered by travelling Ethiopian merchants, who gave the soldier a
Coptic Christian burial. But the civil war in Ethiopia prevented further
detailed investigation.
Before leaving Britain, Colonel Blashford-Snell said: ''Ian was hardy
and tough. He did not say a lot but when he did it was sound common
sense.''
The search for Corporal Macleod's grave has been given the blessing of
his 92-year-old mother and his sister, Mrs Irene Paget, who live in
Kilsyth. ''I hope to fly out anyway to visit a friend in Addis Ababa and
see the plaque and his grave if they find it,'' said Mrs Paget.
The present expedition is an advance party for a group of scientists
who will return to sites visited by the 1968 expedition, which included
mountaineer Chris Bonington. They twice fought off bandits with pistols
and shotguns and were held hostage by rebels opposing Emperor Haile
Selassie. The expedition was later compared to the film Raiders Of The
Lost Ark, and author Wilbur Smith based a novel on their adventures.
This year's reconnaissance for the Great Nile Expedition planned for
1996/1997 intends to visit the site of the battle of Magdala where in
1868 Lord Napier's British-Indian army defeated the Emperor Theodore.
This year's reconnaissance team will also visit Lake Tana, where the
Ark of the Covenant is said to be hidden, and study the feasibility of
restoring ancient palaces and carrying out research into traditional
medicines and local wildlife.

TERRY Venables promised yesterday that he would never be tempted to
''do a Revie'' and desert England before next summer's European
Championships.
But the England coach confirmed that he had been head-hunted by
Inter-Milan and offered the chance to name his own multi-million-pound
salary to become their new manager.
His loyalty to the FA, who gave him the England job when he was out of
work, and his ambition to crown his country kings of Europe in 1996,
ensured that Massimo Moratti's representative received short shrift.
''It was very flattering to be approached by such a big club, I have
to admit, but I made it clear to Inter that I was under contract to the
FA until the end of the European Championship next year and that I
intend to see the job through,'' Venables said.
His decision will be a relief for the FA, still haunted by the memory
of Don Revie's infamous walk-out in 1977 to take an oil-fuelled fortune
offered by the United Arab Emirates.

ERIC Cantona faces a week of intensive care in a bid to be fit for
next Saturday's Manchester derby.
The Frenchman went off after only 18 minutes of a reserve match
against Leeds on Saturday with a knee injury.
United initially said the injury was only slight, but then admitted he
would need three or four days of rest and will miss tonight's
testimonial match for Swansea caretaker-manager Bobby Smith.
The second-division side had sold 12,000 tickets -- three times their
average home gate -- on the strength of Cantona's appearance.
His nine-month ban from the game seems only to have served to increase
his astonishing appeal among supporters far and wide. The biggest crowd
in England on Saturday, 21,502, were drawn to Old Trafford to witness
his reappearance in the red shirt, albeit with the reserves.

A LAST-MINUTE Dario Scotto goal gave Diego Maradona a winning return
with Boca Juniors in his first competitive match since returning from a
15-month drug ban.
The 34-year-old Argentinian, who was tested for drugs after the match,
had made an impressive comeback in an unofficial friendly against South
Korea a week ago -- and on Saturday he showed several glimpses of his
old magic in the first-division home clash with Colon.
Maradona, who was tightly marked, received a yellow card for
protesting at a foul against Claudio Caniggia, who was lured to Boca in
July by the prospect of teaming up again with his former Argentina
team-mate.
The only goal of the match came as the restless Buenos Aires fans were
beginning to jeer in frustration at Boca's four consecutive draws and
the prospect of a fifth.
Later Maradona, who was suspended after taking banned substances at
last year's World Cup in the USA, was chosen to undergo a mandatory drug
test along with three other players.

LENNOX Lewis kept it simple. The former World Boxing Council
heavyweight champion displayed patience, an outstanding jab, hurtful
hooks and right hands as he overcame Tommy Morrison in six rounds in
Atlantic City on Saturday night.
But now it will all start to get complicated. The potentially
dangerous engagement with Morrison now out of the way, the gloves will
be off in a scrap to get WBC heavyweight champion Frank Bruno back into
the ring against Lewis by the end of March.
Bruno is obviously Plan A. But Plan B will be a Lewis fight with
former Olympic adversary Riddick Bowe -- or Evander Holyfield -- if the
WBC instead order Bruno to defend his title against Mike Tyson. Either
way, a Lewis victory would go a long way to installing him as the widely
acknowledged world No.1.
Bowe is still rated in America as the best heavyweight of the present
crop, although the feared WBC move of matching Bruno and Tyson first
will prompt legal action from Lewis's handlers.
Lewis, of course, won the right to fight for his former title by
beating Lionel Butler in last May's ordered WBC final eliminator. But
during the week building up to that fight, Tyson was put into the
leading contender's spot ahead of schedule, hence the politics.
Duva is giving ''serious consideration'' to taking any legal recourse
if Lewis is denied. And cable network Home Box Office will give their
backing to a Bruno re-match, even though they would prefer to feature
Lewis against the winner of the November 4 non-title third fight between
Bowe and Holyfield.
''Hopefully, Bruno will honour the agreement made at the last WBC
convention in Seville and fight Lewis,'' said Duva. ''Nobody has any
more excuses. Lennox has beaten Butler and now Morrison in two dangerous
fights -- fights he didn't have to take.''
Morrison went down four times -- if only briefly -- before referee
Mills Lane intervened after one minute 34 seconds of the sixth round.
The American's right eye was cut and almost closed under the force of
Lewis's controlled, power boxing.
A left-hook clip to the temple in round two put the American down,
then the masterful Lewis had Morrison on the canvas in the fifth, and
twice more in the sixth.
An off-key Morrison did not pose the early threat expected, rarely
throwing his much-vaunted left hooks -- and when they came Lewis was
geared up to block them. But, obviously, Morrison could only fight as
well as he was allowed.
Lewis's damaging and tactically vital jab has for some time been
under-used. But now, in league with new trainer Emanuel Steward, it is
re-emerging as a major weapon.
''I've sent out a message from this fight,'' said Lewis. ''Obviously,
Bruno and Bowe are watching -- and Bruno is trying to duck me.''
* EAMONN Loughran rejected suggestions that he made a meal out of his
fifth defence of the World Boxing Organisation welterweight title in
Belfast.
Loughran won a landslide points decision in a rematch against Angel
Beltre, of the Dominican Republic, and in doing so he set the record
straight after a ''no contest'' with Beltre four months ago, when the
challenger came off worst in a clash of heads.
But some ringsiders felt he should have finished off a big-hearted,
but limited, opponent inside the 12 one-sided rounds.
Loughran, nursing two stitches in a cut left eye, said: ''It would
have looked better if I had stopped him. But I did the next best thing
by winning almost every round. If I had knocked him out in two, people
would just have said he was a bum.''
It looked as if Loughran might finish it in the second round following
a big right hand, which buckled Beltre's legs. It was one of several
rough passages Beltre had to negotiate. But the champion was never able
to press home his advantage to the full and it soon became clear that
the fight was going the distance.
* GERMANY'S Dariusz Michalczewski retained his World Boxing
Organisation light-heavyweight title with a points victory over French
challenger Philippe Michel in Frankfurt.

THIS is a story about the homeless and uncaring councillors. It is a
story about Airdrie.
Now, just because in the past they sometimes behaved like the Bash
Street Kids is no reason for their continued persecution. No matter how
hard they try, it seems no-one will let them build a new home.
When you consider that Airdrie first started talking in November,
1989, about the possibility of moving to a new ground, it is not
unreasonable to assume the club have been more than unfortunate still to
be without a home of their own.
Even the Graham family from Fife have been better treated than Alex
MacDonald's lads. At least the Grahams got a new house.
Airdrie might still be a bit raucous, but footballers will be boys and
no-one should be surprised when occasionally one of them becomes a touch
rebellious. If you mistreat someone for long enough eventually there
will be a backlash of some kind.
Jimmy Sandison got himself sent off again at the weekend and Sean
Sweeney might also find himself in trouble with the authorities, because
it is alleged he refused to shake hands with a linesman after the game
against St Johnstone, but they are not really bad boys. Who knows, a
sociologist might even try to tell you the behaviour of these players
was a cry for help, perhaps also for some attention.
It does seem that for a long time Airdrie have been the club least
appreciated by the football community and they have been lectured to and
punished by referees and the SFA. Local government, including their own
councillors in Monklands, have not exactly been fighting their cause,
which is why they are still lodging at Broadwood in Cumbernauld.
Airdrie's planning application was rejected by Strathclyde Region's
planning department last week, when it was suggested some councillors
were unhappy that they had been placed in the position of either
dismissing or approving the plan to build a 10,000 seater stadium on a
green-belt site on the outskirts of the town.
It is thought they believed Monklands District Council, who attached
conditions which would have cost around #800,000 to the application,
should have allowed the club to build on another site which is not green
belt.
In November '93, Airdrie were prepared, with the backing of a
house-building company, to erect a ground, a golf course, and some
houses on a piece of land known as Brownsburn, but Monklands District
Council, who own the site, refused, saying no commercial developments
would be allowed there. Almost two years down the line it appears the
local council have agreed to a similar scheme themselves on the same
piece of ground, only there won't be a stadium.
Airdrie, of course, can appeal to the Secretary of State or wait until
the new local authorities come into being next year and try again, but
all these delays will, in the end, cost them dearly. They received
approximately #5.5m from Safeway for Broomfield, but that money has been
dwindling over the last couple of years and, with construction costs
continually increasing, the first-division club do not have enough left
to erect a proper ground.
The directors, who claim they had to sell Broomfield before they had
permission to build elsewhere because Safeway's offer might have been
withdrawn or reduced, feel disillusioned and forsaken. They thought they
were looking ahead and planning for the future, but after all this time
-- and also 14 sites later -- they are left wondering why no-one wants
them to build.
It is a bizarre situation, because Airdrie wanted to do what the
game's authorities, and also the government, would applaud. They wanted
to build a modern ground which would have more than met the
recommendations of the Taylor Report, and the country would have had
another new facility.
All very laudable, but then no-one was reckoning with the small and
narrow minds of petty politicians. No-one thought, either, that a
campaign bordering on hysteria would be whipped up in a small community
called Glenmavis next door to where the club wanted to build.
Airdrie's problem is also their community's problem and the
councillors, as well as MP Helen Liddell, should have been doing much
more to assist.
Even Albion Rovers, who live in an old and shaky ground in Coatbridge,
are trying now to benefit from Airdrie's plight. The Rovers, who have
debts with the bank, rejected an offer to move in with Airdrie when it
was thought planning permission would have been granted, and now the
third-division club would like the Diamonds to move in with them at
Cliftohnill.
Airdrie's money would reconstruct that ground to a high and modern
standard and that would be an option, provided Rovers' new directors and
chairman David Shanks, who had trials at Broomfield when he was much
younger, were willing to be realistic. However, if Airdrie put in #4.5m,
plus bring grants perhaps as high as #2m from the Football Trust, then
that club must be owners of the refurbished ground and not half-owners,
as Rovers would no doubt prefer.
Cliftonhill is Rovers' ground, but they have no money to reconstruct
it and a recent independent survey suggested they might be forced to
move at some point in the future.
Perhaps Airdrie should buy Rovers' ground, which is worth around
#700,000, and then invite them to take up lodgings. If not, Monklands
could lose both its senior clubs, and if that happens there are so many
people who could be blamed.
It isn't too late for the councillors to do their duty.

England 20, Australia 16
THEY certainly know how to treat a chap down here, I thought to
myself. I had been ushered into the banqueting hall at Wembley Stadium,
exchanged greetings with Virginia Bottomley, given a nod to Bruce
Forsyth, and mingled with the entire cast of The Bill. A rather cheeky
little Chardonnay was going down well.
Did my eyes deceive me or was that two members of the English Rugby
Union committee, blatantly blazered? At this point an official sidled up
and whispered in my ear. I was in the wrong room.
The jam butty in the press lounge was perfectly acceptable.
A double first. I had never been to a live rugby league match and I
had never been to Wembley. This was the place where Lawrie Reilly used
to score all those last-minute goals, where thousands of Scots tramped
up the Way, where Henry Cooper fought Cassius Clay. And who was sitting
just opposite me on the flight down? Our 'Enery, I kid you not.
Rugby league? Game for hooligans played by hooligans. No rucks, no
lineouts, no pretence about paying the players. This was their World Cup
and England were playing Australia, the reigning champions, in the
opener of a 10-nation tournament.
The first World Cup, he says authoritatively, was in 1954, when Great
Britain, captained by Dave Valentine from Hawick, beat France 16-12 at
Parc de Princes. Not a lot of rugby union people know that.
The game, post Eddie Waring, has moved on since then. The Rugby
Football League has a woman president, Kath Hetherington -- imagine that
at Murrayfield -- and Rupert Murdoch's money is about to change it from
a winter to a summer sport.
But they were still worried about the attendance at Wembley, a long
and expensive way from ''ee ba goom'' land; I was expecting the sort of
crowd one would obtain for a Tory rally in Motherwell.
Not so. Some 41,271 souls gathered -- ''There are more Aussies in
Earl's Court than in Auckland,'' a man on the tube confided -- and they
were regally entertained.
Miss Diana Ross, who I can tell you has sold more records than any
other female performer, opened proceedings by appearing in a black and
white Rolls-Royce wearing a gold cape. She has more hair than Virginia
Bottomley, Brucie, and The Bill combined and shouted some song that I
could not quite follow. It was quite a change, I reflected, from the
pipes and drums of the Queen Victoria School, Dunblane.
The hooter went. Rugby league is a very fast, very repetitive game, in
which one side runs at the other, constantly. It can also be skilful and
exciting, which it was.
Passing becomes an art, the ball transferred like the flick of a
lizard's tongue. Yet, and this did surprise me, kicking is important,
too, and led to three of the tries.
England were without two of their best players, Gary Connolly and the
black-flash winger, Martin Offiah. Australia were short of several
because of a dispute about who is going to take Mr Murdoch's shilling.
The game exploded into life when Barrie-Jon Mather, the English
centre, made a 40-yard dash down the right touchline. The real Barry
John would have been proud of him.
But it was the Kangaroos who scored first, captain Brad Fittler
prising open the defence for Steve Menzies to score and Rod Wishart to
convert.
Not to be outdone, the English skipper, Shaun Edwards, hoisted a kick
which full back Tim Brasher fumbled to let Andrew Farrell in. That made
it 4-6 (tries are worth a point less in league).
Four minutes into the second half Chris Joint was first to an Edwards
kick through and Farrell converted to put England in front. Another punt
by Fiddler -- they are not very good at fielding high balls in this game
-- was missed by England, and Mark Coyne tied up the score.
Jason Robinson, the smallest man on the park, darted in for the next
home score. In league, a lot of scoring comes in the last quarter as
players simply get tired of tackling.
Farrell, the man of the match, converted that before Barry Newlove
sealed it with an interception try.
The Kangaroos were not at all skippy now, but they did manage a late
try by Menzies, converted by Wishart. ''Only a few seconds to the hooter
now,'' I said to the guy on my right, getting into the spirit.
It had been a grand day and, as Colin Welland and I went down the
stairs together, the words of Edwards, the winning captain, rang in our
ears. ''This has been a fantastic occasion for rugby league,'' he
declared.
I still prefer union; Jonathan Davies still wants to come back. But I
would happily go again; their presentation was excellent and I was much
impressed by the field discipline in a very physical sport.

in the battle of the Group one minnows at Keighley. The Fijians
displayed athleticism and awesome power to run in 10 tries against the

YOU will be courteously shown to your business class seat. No effort
has been spared to make you comfortable. The armchair seating is even
heated. A transatlantic flight, perhaps? Or you may be on the top deck
with service to match. The QE2?
In fact, you'd be attending a football match at either Parkhead or
Ibrox, where a caste system is thriving.
In case you have forgotten, football is the game that used to be for
everyone. The people's game. A simple game that brought people together
with the common aim of seeing their team triumph over another. But now
it is in danger of being riven by social divisions.
It is driving at breakneck speed down a rocky road that many other
sports have taken in recent years. And there is a woeful disregard for
those who matter most along the way -- the fans.
Commercial success and the business ethos have taken over. There are
arguments over footballers' rights and ticket prices have soared.
Marketing has become the buzz word of the football of the nineties.
In young supporters, clubs have a captive audience for their
over-priced, constantly changing strips. Manchester United have had so
many recently that it is almost impossible to keep count. Even the
players must be confused. Could that be why they were so unceremoniously
dumped from the Coca-Cola Cup last week by lowly York City?
Last week, Rangers published their annual report. Chairman David
Murray promised that the grass-roots supporters would not be neglected.
But he also said: ''Having achieved full use of executive facilities on
a regular basis over the last two years, growth in this area will now
require examination of a new, wider range of opportunities.''
Executive and corporate facilities are seen by many as the way
forward. A four-course meal and as much champagne as you can drink
before the game, a name plaque attached to your seat for the season, a
private lounge -- even an invitation to the club's Christmas cocktail
party -- are the kind of incentives offered by some of the big clubs to
bring in the fat cats.
It used to be that this kind of flattery was saved for corporate
entertaining at Wimbledon, the Open Championship, and Cowes. But it
crept into rugby, and now it is rampant in football. What you know about
the sport is immaterial, but at least you can gloat about the executive
perks.
But what of the unemployed, life-long supporter, the one who knows all
the club history and who can recite scores from 10 years ago without
prompting? He cannot afford a season ticket and struggles to get a brief
on a one-off basis, because at some clubs there are as few as 5000 left
after away allocation and season ticket-holders are catered for.
And because of clubs' successes ticket prices have risen accordingly.
The cost of a visit to Ibrox to see Rangers play Borussia Dortmund was
#27 for the Broomloan Stand. On a Saturday, the same seat will cost #12.
A regular Saturday sees well over 40,000 at a game, but for the Borussia
match there were only 33,000 onlookers. Admittedly, the game was live on
television, but the majority of fans cannot afford the rising cost of
being a regular attender and then paying for European ties as well.
Of course, Rangers are not alone in the move towards New Football. At
Parkhead the new stand has opened up a new era. But there are also signs
of the Dark Ages.
Those who invested in the share issue last year were able to choose
between five different levels from member to investor to, ultimately,
ambassador.
At the recent Old Firm match a place in the investors' seating of the
new stand cost #30. Of course, like a Volvo, the armchair was heated. As
one worthy said: ''It's warmer here than it is my house.''
But even more ridiculous than the cost of a seat is the dress code
that comes with it. No denims, trainers, T-shirts. Definitely no club
colours. A scarf? Absolutely not. Things have got to a sorry state when
football is about what you wear to be a spectator.
But if nothing else, the ordinary fans have not lost their sense of
humour. At the Borussia game some supporters arrived with huge balloons,
which they bounced back and forward in the stand. What film's theme tune
were they humming? The Dambusters, of course.

YOU might expect that when a Scottish-based publisher comes out with
''the real story of England's 1966 World Cup triumph'' that words like
''cheating bastards'' and ''blind Russian linesman'' might creep in. But
no, a sense of balance has been achieved.
The book It Is Now! (Mainstream, #14.99) is written by an Englishman,
Roger Hutchinson, who has lived for 18 years on the Isle of Skye. This
naturalised Geordie Hebridean looks at how England's victory was won in
the face of almost universal hostility, much of it directed towards Alf
Ramsey.
The book offers an interesting insight into Ramsey, the cold and aloof
football-manager machine whose off-putting strangulated tones were the
result of his undergoing elocution lessons in an attempt to hide his
working-class Essex background.
A fellow Essex football professional who encountered the new,
properly-spoken Ramsey on a train journey exclaimed: ''Bleedin' 'ell,
Alf, leave it out!''
A young Terry Venables, born and brought up only three streets from
Ramsey in Dagenham, was snubbed at his first England training session
when he tried to bring greetings from Sid, one of Ramsey's old pals.
Sir Alf, as he later became, knew how to endear himself to the Scots.
Hailed at Glasgow Airport by a young football writer with the words
''Welcome to Scotland,'' he replied: ''You must be f****** joking.''
A stick-out
WE are grateful to Ian Allan, of Loganswell Road, Glasgow, for news of
the progress of one of the players in Scotland's international football
squad. Not the one run by Craig Brown, but the squad which exists in the
imagination of the creator of the FIFA 95 Sega football game.
The squad consists of 16 fictitious players with names such as
Dempsey, Ferguson, and MacGregor. The name which tickled Mr Allan's
fancy is one P Ness. (The chant for this player would be similar to the
''Sou-Ness, Sou-Ness'' in days of yore at Ibrox. We hope you get the
picture.)
In the Sega game ratings, the boy P Ness gets 86% for speed and 91%
for acceleration so he is obviously very quick into the box. The P Ness
ball control is rated at 80% and he has a fair amount of stamina.
Blame Mr Allan for the comment that P Ness appears to be a stick-out
in the Scottish team.
Terry who?
FORMER Rangers favourite Terry Butcher is making a success of his
post-playing career as a TV and radio football pundit. In this role, he
turned up at Ibrox to collect the accreditation for the BBC Radio Five
Live team which was covering the recent big European match against
Borussia Dortmund.
He identified himself to the member of the Rangers administration
staff dealing with the passes. ''Do you have any form of identification
with you?'' she asked the former skipper, stalwart, and very foundation
stone of the Gers revival of the past decade. Sic transit gloria mundi,
you might say, if the followers of the Teddy Bears will forgive this use
of Latin.
Food for thought
THERE are those who say that it was Steve Fulton's fondness for fast
food that prevented him from reaching the heights as a Celtic player.
Steve is still no sylph but is gracing Brockville with his midfield
skills.
He was the subject of the player profile in a recent Falkirk match
programme. He has not lost his appetite for snacks, his favourite food
being tortilla. Significantly, his answer to the straightforward
questions ''Height? Weight?'' was a ''no comment.''
* IT'S not quite in the class of Mo Johnston's ''this is the only club
I've ever wanted to play for'' but young Steve MacAnespie's words in the
Raith Rovers programme have quickly come back to haunt him.
Asked about his vision of the future, he said he looked forward in
five years' time to be playing with a successful premier-division team,
hopefully Raith Rovers.
This was followed in rapid order by his #700,000 transfer to Bolton.

<HEADLINE>Euro target for a changed Kilmarnock chairman. Flamboyant days are over as Fleeting pursues dream</HEADLINE>

BOB Fleeting has changed. Subtle are the differences in his style
which has been toned by traumatic times, but while he is far from a
broken or impoverished man despite the collapse several years ago of an
extensive property business, he had to pay a toll.
The very least it has cost him is the ostentatious flamboyance with
which he entered the football business as chairman of Kilmarnock, but
that is no bad thing. He is also a much less strident individual and
although still something of an emotive orator, he tends now to be more
measured in his approach.
When he took over at Rugby Park six years ago he was the young owner
of shopping centres, pubs and nightclubs, and with the backing of
Kilmarnock's supporters, the then rather bullish Fleeting forced through
boardroom change. It was very much a consequence of people power long
before the concept had been considered on the terracings of the old
Celtic Park.
The 44-year-old is still chairman of the club and, while the business
portfolio has gone, he retains a profound belief in his own abilities,
even though his detractors refer to the problems which befell him in the
business world. Some wonder if he is of the right stuff to be chairman,
but their doubts are unfounded. They are also disrespectful.
Anyone who questions his commitment has not looked at a stadium
rebuilt at a cost of approximately #5.7m. Rugby Park is a shining
example of prudence and determination.
Apart from that Kilmarnock are in their third consecutive season of
premier division football and the club's annual turnover has gone from
just under #200,000 six years ago to more than #3m while administration
costs are the lowest in the premier division. The club transfer fee has
been broken four times in the last year even though the full costs of
the ground's redevelopment have still to be met. These are testimony to
success, not failure.
Perhaps if Fleeting had devoted more time to his business ventures
they would not have collapsed. ''Perhaps, but I don't know. No-one ever
will,'' he said, ''but even though I was very much aware my business was
being hit by the slump in the property market I had made promises to
thousands of Kilmarnock fans. I couldn't walk away from them.''
When Fleeting and his wealthy backers -- American Laurel Chadwick
whose daughter Annie is married to Fleeting, and former owner of A T
Mays Jim Moffat -- moved in Kilmarnock were in the second division. ''We
were thirty-fifth out of 38 in the Scottish League,'' he recalls, and in
need of direction and financial input.
Fleeting won control and immediately set off in pursuit of three
objectives, two of which, the rebuilding work and a place in the premier
division, have been achieved. The third, however, is proving more
elusive.
''I want to see Kilmarnock in Europe on a regular basis,'' Fleeting
says without even a hint of embarrassment despite the club's place at
the bottom of the premier division. This is Kilmarnock's worst start to
a season since the 1914-15 campaign, but Fleeting regards it as no more
than a slow start and he is confident the team will recover just as they
did last season when they were standed at the bottom after nine matches.
The chairman has faith in himself and those around him and that is why
Alex Totten, the third Kilmarnock manager in Fleeting's reign, was able
to spend almost #1.4m on players when only #600,000 came in through
transfers out of Rugby Park. In common with his species the manager is
always looking for more, but he, too, is pragmatic and accepts
Kilmarnock can't afford to pursue the top clubs by spending wildly.
Totten knows the chairman will allow him more money as soon as it is
available, but he still frets. ''I look at our current position and I
feel guilty,'' Totten says.
''I'm supposed to pick a winning team and I feel I'm letting an awful
lot of people down, but of course there can never be any guarantees
attached to what we do. You only have to look at what happened last
season to Aberdeen and Dundee United.''
These two clubs figure in Fleeting's philosophy as he declares:
''Aberdeen and Dundee United took Kilmarnock's place in Scottish
football and I want it back. We will never be the same as Celtic or
Rangers, but we can compete with them,'' he said.
''It is up to me to make sure the manager has the necessary tools to
do that and at the moment I might not be doing my job properly. That was
why I recently said that if there was someone out there willing to
invest in the club then that person should come forward.''
Fleeting's statement seemed to alarm Moffat, but there is no conflict
within the boardroom, although the chairman has a different opinion with
regard to possible investors. ''I tend to believe that if anyone wanted
to put in a significant amount of money that person would want to hold
the reins,'' he said.
''If that meant I would have to move aside then I would do so, but
only if it was for the good of the club, only if someone else could
drive Kilmarnock on to the next stage.''
Fleeting doesn't have to shoulder his way through a queue of people
clutching cheques when he arrives at the ground and it is likely he will
continue to lead the club towards the third aim. Europe is the final
frontier, but no matter how frustrated he may become he would never
consider questioning the manager's tactics or selections.
''I wouldn't know a good player if he jumped up and bit me,'' Fleeting
pointed out. ''The chairman of a company appoints experts to perform
specific functions and if they don't get their parts right they go,
while if the chairman fails in his duties and the company is on the
rocks then he must go.''
Totten, who was asked to succeed Tommy Burns because of his experience
and track record with Alloa, Falkirk, Rangers (assistant to Jock
Wallace), Dumbarton, St Johnstone, and East Fife would be one of the
most disappointed if Fleeting did leave. ''He has given me a great deal
of support and encouragement as well as money for players last season
and I haven't really found his flaws yet,'' he said.
''The chairman knows what I want and where I want to take the club and
I feel that if he is in a position to give me what I require to do the
job then he will not hesitate.''
In the beginning Fleeting might have been willing to spend more than
the club could afford on top-quality players, but he learns from the
mistakes of others and will not take his club into heavy debt. ''Some
clubs have already tried to match Celtic and Rangers by spending big on
players and salaries but that always comes back to haunt clubs like
ours,'' he said.
''You have to meet costs somehow and you can end up in serious trouble
because you tried to live beyond your means. We have people at this club
with lots of money, but if they started to put their hands in their
pockets regularly for players we would be operating on a false economy
because at some point that source would dry up. The club would be left
with massive wage bills.''
Fleeting prefers to move at a slower pace and stresses that once the
current transition period is over more money will be available for
transfers. ''We have rebuilt this place and we have still been able to
provide money for players. Also, in my time at Kilmarnock no manager has
ever been asked to sell a player. That isn't bad,'' he said.
In fact, that is a remarkable achievement and that is why the majority
of Kilmarnock's supporters continue to back Fleeting and his judgments.
No-one could say for certain what or where he will be in the future, but
he has made his mark in Kilmarnock.
''A modern stadium was always going to be the basis of this club's
future and that stadium is in place,'' he said.
''No matter what happens now, no-one can ever take that away from
me.''

YOUR recent report and correspondence from readers expressed concern
about injuries sustained while playing shinty, particularly highlighting
the accident to Oban Camanachd's Gordon MacIntyre, who, unfortunately,
lost an eye. The Camanachd Association, shinty's governing body, shares
these concerns but must remain calm in its deliberations on how it
should respond.
It is important to remind your readers that shinty does not have a
higher incidence of injuries than any other contact team sport.
The association regularly reviews its policy on safety and the
equipment available to players to prevent injuries. Our equipment
convener is continually researching the design and quality of sticks,
balls, and protective wear available to players. Our policy includes a
strategy of improved coaching techniques on safe play, optional wearing
of mouth guards, helmets, and gloves. With assistance from medical
practitioners, who have developed expertise in sports injuries, we are
continually reviewing our practices and monitoring trends.
Our strategy has to be viewed in the context of the equipment
available on the market. Shinty, as a minority sport, finds great
difficulty in persuading manufacturers to design and develop equipment
specifically for a limited market and we have to rely on what is
available to other sports.
The association has examined a number of models of helmets on the
market with face guards and visors, manufactured principally for other
sports and concluded that while they would protect a players face from a
direct blow from the ball, they presented potential danger in their
design to the wearer if struck by a stick in the area where the guard
and helmet join.
We are very conscious of our responsibility and strive to promote safe
practices to the benefit of all players. Hopefully, designs will improve
now that manufacturers are required by law to meet the BSI Kitemark
standards.
Be assured that the Camanachd Association is actively pursuing
solutions to avoid incidents similar to that experienced by Gordon
MacIntyre and Dr Peake.

WELL done The Herald and James Traynor for the excellent coverage and

4000 metres individual pursuit championship in Colombia.
Contrast this with the BBC Scotland team who have scarcely mentioned

RICHARD Gough is a fine club captain, an accomplished football player
and an inspirational figure on the field who has recently run into his
finest form for years.
He is not Scotland's best central defender, however, and James Traynor
and the rest of the Scottish media pack don't seem to have noticed that
he is no longer playing a traditional central defender's role.
The inclusion of Gordan Petric alongside Alan MacLaren in the Rangers
central defence has freed Gough to attack the ball and career forward
into the midfield in an auxiliary attacking role -- and right well he is
doing it too.
In this new capacity, Gough's slowness in the turn -- a very important
factor in the modern defender's game -- is not critical and rarely
exposed. But I still remember the Portuguese nightmare.
Colin Hendry turns quicker than Richard Gough, tackles more precisely,
and holds down his position in the Scottish team on merit. If there is
an argument for the inclusion of Richard Gourgh in Scotland's plans, it
would be as a midfielder. He rather reminds me of Roy Aitken in full
flight.
On the other hand, Richard Gough is an intelligent and articulate man.
He must have been fully aware when he attacked Roxburgh and Brown in his
book just exactly what effect this would have on his career as a
Scotland player. I don't imagine he would expect many games for Rangers
if he had had the temerity to publicly slag Walter Smith and Archie
Knox. I can only assume that playing for Scotland was no longer very
important to him.
Colin Hendry's commitment to the Scotland cause is in no doubt.

ONCE again the media, and in this particular instance, James Traynor
and Ken Gallacher, are attempting to whip up interest in the tiresome
subject of Richard Gough's continuing absence from the Scotland football
squad.
Reporters apart, the only people likely to be concerned are Rangers
supporters who have mainly deserted the national team in the vain search
for European glory at club level.
The truth of the matter is that the vast majority of the loyal
Scottish supporters have consigned the debate to the past. They are
satisfied with the level of commitment and performance being given by
players such as Hendry, Boyd and Calderwood. It might well be different
if the player was a Dalglish or a Baxter, but Richard Gough does not
carry that amount of influence not withstanding his performances in
Sweden.
I must admit to being pleasantly surprised with regard to the
remarkable job which Craig Brown has done with the limited resources
available to him. Assuming that Scotland will now qualify, it seems only
fair that the media should get off his back until after the European
Championships at which time there can be a rational assessment of the
team's performance.
In the meantime, I would urge the team manager to keep his own counsel
on the subject of Richard Gough as some of his earlier public utterances
have been ill-judged and only provided ammunition for his detractors.

<HEADLINE>Time for McCann to rethink wages policy. Celtic must come to terms with reality</HEADLINE>

If Billy McKinlay had been a target for Rangers and had travelled to
Ibrox or to David Murray's Edinburgh headquarters, would he have left
without signing? The answer is no.
THE list grows longer. Players travel to Parkhead to consider signing
offers from Celtic, then travel homeward to think again and finish up
going to another club.
It happened with Belgian Marc Degryse and Frenchman David Ginola, and
now it has happened with Dundee United's Billy McKinlay.
Each time the word from inside Celtic Park has been that the players
have been greedy, that they have been excessive in their demands, and
that they have missed a major career opportunity in not choosing to join
the Glasgow club.
That may well remain the belief at Parkhead after this latest snub,
but I would suggest that it is time for Fergus McCann to rethink his
wages policy at the club.
There is little doubt that, on this occasion, Celtic gave it their
best shot as they attempted to add the midfield talents of McKinlay to
their squad.
Which leaves the inevitable question of how and where they will find
quality international players to join them if their top offer could not
lure McKinlay away from the clutches of English champions Blackburn
Rovers?
It may well be that over the next decade the prudent financial
policies that McCann has introduced at Parkhead will be proved correct.
At the moment, I do believe that in many instances players are being
paid too much money by clubs who cannot afford the wage bills.
However, those vast numbers of newly enfranchised Celtic supporters
will not see it that way in the short-term. They made an investment in
the club and became shareholders so that they could see the very best
players arrive at Parkhead and lift the club back to its former glories.
They are hardly going to be satisfied with a Scottish Cup victory, no
matter how important that was.
They want more. They want another championship victory, knowing if
they achieve that aim they will halt what seems to be Rangers'
relentless march on Celtic's own record nine-in-a-row title wins.
That is what they want. All of them, and questions could be asked
tomorrow at the club's annual meeting.
And if it means meeting the going rate in football's inflated market
place over the next couple of seasons, then that is what will have to be
done.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns edged himself ahead of Blackburn in the
race for McKinlay. While the Premiership champions delayed on making a
renewed offer for the player after their first attempt had been turned
down by Dundee United, Burns made his move. He outbid the big spenders
of English football and within 24 hours he had the player at Parkhead
for signing talks.
That should have been it. The club should have made their biggest
offer then and the player might have signed before he even knew that
Blackburn were back in the race.
Instead, because of the management structure which exists at Parkhead,
McKinlay was allowed to leave, Blackburn stepped back in, and, from that
moment, the Celtic bid was destined to fail.
Celtic may not enjoy the analogy I am now make -- but it is a view
they must take on board if they are to remain as a genuine force in the
game, not only in Scotland, but on the Continent.
If McKinlay had been a signing target for Rangers and had travelled to
Ibrox or to David Murray's Edinburgh headquarters, would he have left
without signing? The answer is no.
Other interested clubs would never have had the opportunity of
speaking to him. That has been the way at Ibrox since Graeme Souness
sparked off the Rangers' revolution almost 10 years ago.
I can recall Souness whisking Terry Butcher to Glasgow after the
England skipper had flown in from a charity game in Los Angeles. Butcher
didn't even get the chance to go home to his family in Ipswich.
Instead, he was being shown around Ibrox and having Souness sell the
club to him, and then having the money men give him a contract which
rivalled anything he would have received if he had remained down south.
That way of doing business has never changed.
Burns can sell his club with all the fervour which Souness sold
Rangers to the many players who paraded through the marble halls during
his reign.
The difference comes when money is spoken about. It is there that the
major gulf between the clubs still exists.
Until McCann and his financial people can come to terms with the wage
deals which are being struck at Ibrox and in the Premiership, and even
the first division in England, then Burns will be left to pick up on
what is left after the big guns have plundered the transfer market every
summer.
This year they had success with Andreas Thom, who probably is the
highest paid player at Parkhead, but also chalked up three notable
failures. That is not what the support wants.
Former Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer had a much-loved phrase he liked
to use and it was: ''You have to be able to sit at the big table if you
are going to do anything in football. That is where it all happens.''
Wallace never made it there -- but McCann must, or his vision for
Celtic may perish.

AN unlikely history, darts has. It kicked off as a practice for
archery -- which is probably why, to this day, players refer to their
tools of the trade as ''arrows''.
In the days of knights jousting and such, darts was played using a
quintain, a lance target. Very strange indeed is that the Pilgrim
Fathers played the game on board the Mayflower. They probably played it
sober. A splendid game it is, oft played by young people in bedsits and
teenagers in bedrooms: bloody dangerous too, for visitors to such cells.
And, of course, played in pubs.
Just why such a potentially fatal attraction as darts should have been
so much associated with bevvy is difficult to grasp really; why the
feathered friends should have made such an impact on pub culture when
tavern sports such as skittles or Shove Ha'penny, or even playing-card
games like cribbage, have virtually died out, nobody knows.
True, in the continent of Europe, there are still many inn-centred
games like baccarat and boules, but darts, and perhaps dominoes, have
lasted in Britain's boozers ever since we started up boozers. I suspect
one cannot trust these foreign johnnies with a dart in one hand and a
glass of red biddy or foul-tasting pilsner in the other grubby mitt.
Darts is horribly British.
So off to Ayr, to Butlins, to what is now called Wonderwestworld. The
ideal spot for something splendidly proletarian like darts, the World
Professional Team Championships of it, at that.
Four groups of four teams with two in each team. A round robin with
each match the best of 11 legs, and the final the best of 27 legs. I
know, I can't work out the mathematics either, but then I was always the
bloke who wasn't allowed to chalk the board, either.
Sky telly filmed it all (is there any damned sport which Sky doesn't
have the rights to?), and they had a pleasant venue for it, too, with
much larger an audience than one would have thought, and a great deal of
razzmatazz.
But truly, the show was good and much needed by the players there last
week, for darts has seen a spectacular down-turn in television coverage.
Thus the British Darts Organisation, which was the ruling body, has been
ditched by many of the top players, who have set up their own
organisation, rather as Chaplin and Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks set
up United Artists -- to get a fairer slice of the action.
The World Darts Council, the professionals themselves, are hoping for
a better deal. Darts manufacturers like Harrows, Unicorn, and Data
Darts, have sponsored much, as of course have a great number of brewers.
Certainly the darts lads have never earned anything like the massive
sums that, say, snooker players can obtain.
Strange things, audiences for small sports; always horribly
enthusiastic. The place was awash with darts fans, and their weans. Oh,
what weans. They were everywhere, dressed to kill, with enough colour in
their trackies and trannies to suggest the TV set turned to full. Your
retinas were shattered after five minutes.
The nearby bar (Buffalo Billy's, a ranch-style emporium of lavish
pomp), had darts blokes with long-suffering wives in Lycra, the wee boys
sporting that haircut which looks as though a sheep-shearer has been
attending them, and the teenage girls wore sequinned mini-skirts and
pink ankle boots (there was also the Butlins talent contest final).
I liked it, I liked the darts players, and yes, I did get to talk to
one of our national heroes, Jocky Wilson, who must be getting fed up
explaining to journos breathing whisky over him that he has given up the
booze for eight months. Jocky was a lovely man who told me that he was
glad he was earning a living playing darts: ''I was a miner: I wouldnae
earn a tosser digging coal noo.''
I liked the place. Frankly, it is a little recherche -- a word I
suspect neither Jocky nor his partner last week, Phil Taylor of England,
are likely to use very often. But I felt at home myself. A touch of one
hundred and EIGHTY! Even a bull's eye.

TWO of the top staying chasers in Britain are set to clash in a new
#15,000 race at Ayr next month. Jodami, winner of the 1993 Cheltenham
Gold Cup and last year's Hennessy Gold Cup winner One Man, are on course
for the race, a limited handicap over three miles and a furlong on
November 11.
''Jodami is brighter and sharper than at the same stage last year and
the intention is to run at Ayr,'' said trainer Peter Beaumont. ''That
may be his second race of the season, however, as he could run in the
Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby at the end of the month.
''His early-season aim is the Hennessy and it would be nice to get two
runs into him before that.'' One Man, who also has the Hennessy at
Newbury on November 25 in his sights, also is fit and well, according to
trainer Gordon Richards.
''The Ayr chase is ideal for him. Apart from that there is a shortage
of suitable races in the north early in the season,'' he said.
* ASCOT has its royalty, while Longchamp has chic, but for big money
it has to be the Middle East, and prize money guaranteed at $4m puts the
inaugural Dubai World Cup race on March 27 in a class of its own.
Some 60% of the purse -- $2.4m -- goes to the winner, who will become
the champion of international champions.
First entries for the 10-furlong race, designed exclusively for the
best four-year-olds from every continent, are due to be nominated on
tomorrow.
The race will be run at Nad al Sheba, a modern complex lavished with
the best that money can buy within sight of the bustling city of Dubai.
Only 14 starters will be allowed to run on the floodlit track. They
will be the champions of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the
Breeders' Cup and the Arlington Million in the United States, the
Melbourne Cup in Australia, Tokyo's Japan Cup, the Hong Kong
International races, and other famous races.
Three will come from Europe, three from the Americas, two from
Australia and New Zealand, two from Asia, and four from hosts, United
Arab Emirates.
* HERNANDO was the best of the three French runners in the Grade 1
Turf Classic at rain-softened Belmont Park in the USA, finishing second
behind 17-1 shot Turk Passer.
Connections of the 1993 French Derby winner said they were satisfied
with his run, considering that he is much better performer on a sound
surface.
The race developed into a duel ahead of Celtic Arms, the 1994 French
Derby winner, who took third a further five lengths back.
Cigar, America's latest wonder horse, gained his eleventh consecutive
victory when beating Unaccounted For by a length in the Jockey Club Gold
Cup, although the manner of his victory didn't convince everyone.
''He didn't handle the track well but won in spite of it,'' said
jockey Jerry Bailey.
* ONE leading firm of bookmakers have clipped the odds of Cesarewitch
favourite Top Cees. ''His odds have been cut from 4-1 in to 7-2,''
explained Coral's Hillary Spooner.
''That is due to liabilities of around #20,000 carried over from
Coastal Bluff and Night Dance winning at Ascot and Double Bounce at
York.'' Latest betting:
7-2 Top Cees, 6-1 Saleel, 8-1 Salaman, 10-1 Istabraq, New Reputation
(12-1), 14-1 Imad (20-1), 16-1 Old Red (20-1), 20-1 others.

LUCINDA Russell's first season as a trainer continued along the right
lines with yet another success at Hexham on Saturday, Fiveleigh Builds
trotting up in the feature handicap chase.
This was her third winner from five runners, all achieved in 17 days.
Best known for representing Scotland at eventing and preparing
point-to-pointers, Lucinda took out a licence this summer to train at
Milnathort, Kinross.
Her run of success started at Perth last month when Fiveleigh Builds
gained her the first trophy of her training career, the Perthshire
Challenge Cup, for beating Zamirah in the Royal Bank Chase.
She followed up last Saturday at Kelso with Vavasir's decisive victory
in the Highland Malty Chase.
Although he was running over a shorter distance and carrying a 5lb
penalty in the Federation Brewery Chase, Fiveleigh Builds had no
difficulty in repeating his Perth performance. He jumped well for jockey
Andrew Thornton and was never headed throughout.
The eight-year-old, formerly with Charlie Brooks, cost 4000 guineas in
May. He is owned jointly by the trainer and Liz Noble, who left her home
in Inverness early on Saturday morning on the first leg of her journey
to Hexham. They are already thinking of Cheltenham in March, but their
horse will probably next run at Carlisle later this month.
The two women had gone to Northumberland confident of a double, but
their hopes were dashed when Miss Enrico, winner of four point-to-points
and a hunter chase last season, fell in the early stages of the novice
chase.
Peter Monteith consolided his position in The Herald Scottish
Trainers' Championship, with Master Bavard giving him his fifth winner
of the campaign.
The seven-year-old just failed to make all at Kelso when beaten by Hit
The Canvas. This time jockey Brian Harding gave him a breather midway,
having taken an early lead. He led again before two out and the 5-4
favourite appeared to prick his ears at the bottom of the hill as he
went on to beat Saint Martine by a length and a half.
This afternoon, Beldine, going for his third consecutive win, is one
of four runners from Monteith at Sedgefield.
The 10-year-old grey, who at Hexham last month had his thirteenth
success over jumps, goes well for Tony Dobbin and will be difficult to
beat in the Chilton Club Chase.

Division Four
THE first half of the programme has finished with Kilmarnock and
Glasgow Southern confirmed as promotion favourites, as Gordonians'
challenge faltered in a 9-3 defeat at Langholm. At the foot, Edinburgh
Wanderers produced a chink of hope by winning at Wigtownshire.
Kilmarnock won in style at Haddington to displace Southern from the
top spot. In the first half only their own over-elaboration prevented
the score reaching more impressive proportions than 17-0. In the second
half they got it right with a number of brilliant tries ensuing. Full
back Robbie Stewart and Tony Finnigan each had a brace, with Philip
Gordon, Stuart Jenkins, Robin Carswell, and Kevin Pattie each grabbing
one. With Stewart kicking one conversion and Gordon three plus a
penalty, and Haddington's Cammy Murray scoring a try, Killie won by
51-5.
Southern negotiated their potentially difficult visit to Millbrae to
win 25-12. Neither side had the edge with 10 minutes remaining, but
Southern stepped up their game, with Jeff Kayne going in off Gavin
Walsh's drive. James Dunlop, who kicked six penalties in the match,
converted. For Ayr, Andy Hay dropped a goal and Foster goaled three
penalties from 11 attempts.
At Langholm, Gordonians' stiff defence prevented the locals building
the lead their pressure deserved. As a result the match reached a real
climax as the Aberdonians twice in the closing stages produced thrilling
breakouts, only to thwarted by home full back Ray Elliot.
Gordonians took the lead with a penalty by Bruce Doney in 14 minutes
and all Langholm's points came in an eight-minute spell in the middle of
the first half. Colin Turk dropped two goals and Gary Brannan kicked a
penalty as Langholm moved into third place.
The bottom-of-the-table clash at Stranraer was the fully anticipated
scrap. Wigtownshire opened the scoring with a penalty from Davie
Drysdale but Wanderers got in front with the next score and went on to
win 23-18.
Wanderers' tries came through scrum half Craig Dunlop, blindside
flanker Ken Glendinning, and a penalty award.

Stewart's Melville 17, Kelso 33
ERIC Paxton remains confident that Kelso can climb away from
relegation trouble after this victory at Inverleith which allows them to
swop places with Stewart's Melville at the bottom of Division Two.
''We've always been slow starters,'' said the coach. ''Even in the
years we won the championship, we lost matches early on.''
Paxton was especially pleased by the performance of scrum half Iain
Fairley, returning to the side after a long absence due to injury.
As for Australian centre Ben Mannion, who scored a try on his league
debut, he added: ''He has good hands and good vision. I'm sure he will
be an asset.''
It is hard, though, to be optimistic about Stewart's Melville's
chances of survival. However, they played with considerable spirit and
actually dominated the game for long spells in the second half.
There must also have been consolation in the performance of young
left-winger Mark Tweedie, another making his first appearance, who
scored both of the Colleges' tries.
Kelso, though, made the early running, and Graeme Aitchison followed
his fourth-minute penalty by converting his own try nine minutes later.
Home prop Ross McNulty was held up over the Kelso line and Graeme
Stirling kicked a penalty after a trip on Tweedie, but it was no
surprise when Adam Roxburgh took Fairley's pass from a scrummage and ran
through for a try virtually unopposed. Aitchison converted and landed
his second penalty from over 40 metres out, and although Stirling
converted Tweedie's first touchdown, Kelso pulled away at the start of
the second half with another Aitchison penalty and his conversion of
Mannion's try.
The home side then applied pressure, although all they had to show for
it was another try for Tweedie, but Aitchison's fourth penalty was the
last kick of the game.
Stewart's Melville -- G Stirling; A Huett, F Pollock, J Scott, M
Tweedie; D Wyllie, G Burns; R McNulty, A Cadzow, J Blackhall, M Paton, W
Faulds, K Dobson, D Clark, N Penny. Replacements -- J Forbes for Clark
(35 to 52 min), and then for Dawson (76 min permanently).
Kelso -- G Aitchison; S Ross, G Laing, B Mannion, J Thomson; S Tait, I
Fairley; J Ramage, K Thomson, R Hogarth, S Rowley, I Fullarton, S
Bennet, J Jeffrey, A Roxburgh. Replacements -- Charlie Meadie for Rowley
(from 5 to 10 min) (28 to 30 min), and for Roxburgh (67 to 75 min), A
Miller for Laing (8 to 10 min).
Referee -- K Harrower (Forrester).
SCORERS: Stewart's Melville -- Tweedie, 2t; Stirling, 1p, 2c. Kelso --
Aitchison, 1t, 3c, 4p; Roxburgh, 1t; Mannion, 1t.

KELBURNE'S lack of discipline cost them dearly at Maryfield on
Saturday against Torbrex Wanderers when four of their players were given
temporary suspensions -- three for dissent -- and not surprisingly were
sent crashing to a 6-0 defeat. The Paisley men were down to nine men at
one stage in the second half, and Wanderers hit three goals.
Wanderers were deserved winners, with Darren Gibson and 14-year-old
schoolboy Neil Stott causing mayhem in the Kelburne defence. Gordon
Shepherd and Mark Lappin had two goals apiece.
Wanderers moved into pole position in the first division, as overnight
leaders Grange were toppled by Touche Ross Gordonians by 4-1.
The six first-division games over the weekend produced a staggering 44
goals. The principal contributors were Western and MIM, who scored 12
apiece, but when the teams clashed yesterday at Auchenhowie, it was
Western who won 5-1. Results:

SARAH Taylor, the Royal High Gymnasts centre forward, was rushed to
hospital on Saturday. It was feared that the Scottish Under-21
internationalist had suffered spinal injuries, but fortunately her
condition was not as bad as first thought.
''Sarah's grip has almost returned and she now is making good
progress, although she will be out of action for some time,'' said Val
Neil, Gymnasts' captain.
The incident happened after just seven minutes, and during that time
Gymnasts' opponents, Heriot Watt University, had hit a post. The game
was abandoned.
Edinburgh Ladies, meanwhile, went top of the table when they got the
verdict in an enthralling game with Bonagrass Grove after Rhona Simpson
had set up the only goal of the game for international colleague Louise
Burton.
This match featured some superb attacking hockey. Charlotte Jones,
however, was the busier keeper mainly because of the efficiency of
Simpson.
However, Simpson's scoring exploits were put in the shade by Linda
McKay, the Hyndland centre. She netted six of their goals in a 12-0
defeat of Boroughmuir. Results:
Saturday. National League. Division 1 -- Edinburgh Ladies 1, Bonagrass
Grove 0; Hyndland 12, Boroughmuir 0; Western A 1, Menzieshill 1.
Division 2 -- Stepps 2, Grange 1; Kelburne 4, Eglinton 0. Division 3 --

NEALE Dougan and Chris
Wood won the Weir Toyota Forest Stages Rally on home soil in the final
round of the Burmah Scottish Rally Championship in South Ayrshire and
Galloway on Saturday -- but the national title went to third-placed
David Gillanders and John Bennie.
Dougan and Wood set the pace from the start of the 45-mile event,
faster over the opening stage by 10 seconds from Volkswagen works
driver, Dom Buckley.
On the second stage, Dougan's run nearly came to grief when his Ford
Escort Cosworth slid off, but luck was with him and he lost only 15
seconds. He regained the lead on the third test and thereafter eked out
a few more seconds on Buckley to take a hard-fought victory, and his
second of the season, by just 15 seconds.
But all eyes were on the battle behind the leading pair as Chris
Wagner/Alan Stark, David Gillanders/John Bennie,and John Baird/Martin
Forrest fought out who would win this year's Burmah Scottish Rally
Championship.
With a pre-event eight-point advantage over his two main adversaries,
Wagner looked as though he had his first national title in the bag and
both Gillanders and Baird were resigned to battling it out for the
runner-up spot.
But in the first stage, Wagner inexplicably dropped more than a minute
to the top seeds, in twentieth place overall. Wagner's vain chase ended
in the fourth stage when the Audi 90 Quattro spun off the road.
Then followed a duel between Gillanders and Baird, with the honours
falling to Gillanders, who finished third.
That meant the duo tied for the championship on the same points total,
and this year's title was decided on the tie-break. Gillanders got it,
with three outright victories during the season to Baird's one. Results:

GREAT Britain completed a convincing win against the USA at the
Scotstoun Leisure Centre, Glasgow, to claim the Maureen Connolly
Challenge Trophy for the third successive year.
Their victory in the annual 21-and-under women's fixture was achieved
with a day to spare, the hosts establishing a 7-1 winning margin at the
end of play on Friday. The final score was 9-2.
Karen Cross made up for her straight-sets defeat by Sandy Sureephong
on Friday with a 49-minute success against Kristen Sanderson. The Devon
player dropped the opening game before reeling off the next 12 for a
6-1, 6-0 win.
Sureephong collected her second win in the three-day event when she
claimed the scalp of British No.1 Lizzie Jelfs in the final singles
match.
A ''disappointed'' Jelfs shrugged off her 6-3, 6-3 defeat and ended on
a winning note when she helped to clinch the final doubles rubber. The
19-year-old from Banbury revealed glimpses of the form that earned her
the doubles title with South African Nannie de Villiers at last year's
junior Wimbledon, when she teamed up with Cross to inflict a 6-1, 6-4
defeat on Traci Green and Farley Taylor.
British team captain Ann Jones was ''delighted'' with the result,
which gives Britain its first hat trick of victories and narrows
America's overall lead in the competition to 17-6.

GHK 0, Selkirk 17
IT HAS become fashionable to proclaim that Borders rugby isn't what it
was. But at Old Anniesland on Saturday, Selkirk did what countless
Border sides have been doing on Glasgow grounds for years.
They found themselves on the receiving end for much of the match but
they refused to be fazed. They stuck together as a unit. They did the
simple things simply. As the opposition failed to turn opportunities
into points, they realised the game was there to be won and when the
inevitable chances came, Selkirk took them.
The GHK programme noted the number of recent injuries and indicated
that Kenny Wilson, John McLeod, and Gus Kerr would be coming in. GHK
could also point to the long-term injury exclusion of internationalists
Alan Watt and Shade Munro. But this was scarcely a factor on Saturday.
The home pack had the upper hand, with Murray Wallace the pick, and this
allowed GHK to dominate the opening quarter, by the end of which they
could have been well ahead.
As early as the fifth minute Harry Bassi missed a penalty. With Bassi
off for attention to an eye cut George Breckenridge missed two more and
McLeod came close with a drop goal. GHK began to fidget.
Maybe this tension was the cause of a flare-up on halfway in 22
minutes. Scott Nichol put the penalty well into the home twenty-two.
Keith McConnell took the throw and the seven-man home pack couldn't
defend the subsequent rolling maul, with Billy Gentleman the man to
ground the ball.
The match then returned to type. When Gerry Hawkes for once got round
Rodney Pow, the cover kept him out. Bassi missed a penalty before the
turn and Breckenridge, too, in the five minutes thereafter.
Play then settled more in midfield. Penalty awards came Selkirk's way
and Pow put over four. Several times it seemed that a Selkirk man could
equally have fallen foul of the referee, but GHK couldn't really
complain, they'd earlier had enough chances to win the match.
GHK -- G Breckenridge; G Agnew, S Little, H Bassi, G Hawkes; J McLeod,
A Kerr; S Gay, C Docherty, G MacIlwham, N Adams, K Wilson, A Ness, M
Wallace, I Sinclair. Replacement -- S Hutton for Ness (60min)
Selkirk -- D Hunter; R Pow, K Johnston, D Gage, D Hulme; S Nichol, S

PRESTWICK, the holders, have not taken long to move to the top of
Division 1, Section B, in the CIS Insurance Indoor League. Their 96-76
home win against Auchinleck in the second week of matches gives them
pole position ahead of Bainfield on shots aggregate.
Edinburgh, without Commonwealth gold medallist Richard Corsie, tumbled
to an unexpected 79-89 home defeat from East Lothian despite the home
side having three winning rinks.
East Lothian's hero was Willie Wood, who defeated Alan Poole 35-9 to
offset defeats from Ian Bell, Angus Blair, and Graham Robertson.
In Section A, newly promoted Cumbernauld have taken a clear lead in
the table, a point clear of West Lothian, while Cumbernauld defeated
Turriff 95-71 and West Lothian returned from Ayr with an 86-67 win.

WINTER athletics -- road and cross-country running -- is all about
staying power, so it would be foolish, after just one Saturday of the
season, to write off any contender for honours, least of all Cambuslang,
whose eight successive Scottish team cross-country crowns bear witness
to their depth of talent and commitment.
But Leslie Deans Racing Club and Shettleston Harriers gave the
sternest possible warning in the fifty-seventh running of the 4 x
3[1/4]-mile McAndrew Relay at Scotstoun that Cambuslang's domination
faces its strongest challenge in recent years.
These two clubs, winners and runners-up respectively, took the
tightest stranglehold ever on the event, filling the first five places
with their A, B, and C teams. Kilbarchan, sixth, more than
three-and-a-half minutes down, were the nearest challengers, with
Cambuslang ninth, more than four minutes adrift.
More significantly, of the 18 individuals who bettered 16 minutes,
only one, Charlie Thomson, wore Cambuslang colours, while 12 were from
Racing or Shettleston.
The yielding glaur of the country will suit Cambuslang better than the
roads, but the gauntlet has been cast down, auguring an exciting season.
Shell Bitumen and Tilcon, new joint-backers of the Victoria Park race,
could put the event on more solid foundations. But they could not have
hoped for a more engrossing battle than this, in which Racing and
Shettleston exchanged the lead four times before Glen Stewart broke
clear of Adrian Callan in the final mile, recording the fastest lap of
the day, 15min 07sec, to give Racing victory by 12 seconds, in 61-27.
This equalled the course record set by Dundee Hawkhill in 1990, and was
their fourth win in five years.
Neither of the leaders made the optimum selection. Frank McGowan, left
out of Racing's A team, ran the third-fastest time of the day to bring
their C squad home ahead of the field on the opening leg, with veteran
Brian Kirkwood, for Racing A, 19 seconds behind in fourth.
Last week, at the Kilbarchan relays, Shettleston's Dave Cameron had
the better of clubmate Billy Coyle. Cameron was promoted to the first
team for Saturday, and Coyle relegated. The inevitable happened: Coyle
turned the tables, beating Cameron by four seconds to bring Shettleston
B home second, ahead of their A team.
The second stage shook down the real contenders, John Mackay carrying
Shettleston A to the front with the under-rated David Ross narrowing
Racing A's 19-second deficit to just four seconds.
Racing's Ian Brown attacked immediately, and was soon shoulder to
shoulder with Shettleston's international cross-country man, Graeme
Wight, before breaking clear. Wight bided his time, and Brown, still
suffering the effects of a top-10 finish in the previous weekend's Great
Caledonian Run, was reeled in to such effect that Wight handed a
six-second lead to Callan for the final stage.
A week earlier, a 15-second cushion had enabled Callan to hold off
Stewart at Kilbarchan, but over a further mile, six seconds was
insufficient.
Callan clung briefly to Stewart when he caught up, but Stewart's surge
over the final mile made Racing Club's winning margin comfortable.
Disconcertingly for their rivals, Racing left at home a team capable
of having won this race -- Tom Hanlon, John Robson, Peter Fleming, and
Keith Lyle, and on Saturday, for the first time in a relay, they fielded
former London Marathon winner Allister Hutton. The 41-year-old clocked
an impressive 16-08.
Stewart's time was 18 seconds outside Steve Ovett's course record.
Following discussions with his father and coach, Lachie, the former
Commonwealth 10,000m champion, Glen has decided on a more intensive
programme this winter, but will miss next month's national cross-country
relay championships while he attends his sister's wedding. Saturday's

INVERARAY, the shock troops of the first shinty premier league, look
like being the only team capable of sustaining a long-term challenge to
Kingussie's title aspirations, on current form.
The Argyll side's win over Oban Camanachd, while important for the two
points it secured, was just as important from a psychological point of
view, given that Camanachd were last year's south champions.
A goal in each half from Garry MacPherson and Douglas Watt, countering
an early strike from David Devine, was enough to see Inveraray move
smoothly into second place in the league. Camanachd had five players
booked by Glasgow referee Rab McMillan, and remain anchored at the foot
of the table.
Kingussie, meanwhile, strolled through their game against Fort William
to maintain their top position. Fort's eager youngsters, while playing
plenty of attractive shinty, failed to dent the solid Kingussie defence,
in which Ian Borthwick was outstanding, alongside his two older
brothers, Dave and Stephen.
Glenurquhart's defeat at Newtonmore cost them their share of second
place. The result was largely due to the Glen's failing in front of
goal, squandering a huge amount of possession.
Newtonmore's solitary counter, only their third goal in four league
matches, came from Colin Stewart, who had earlier seen a brilliant save
by Billy MacLeod keep the score-sheet blank. MacLeod also produced a
brilliant penalty save.
Glasgow Mid Argyll's comfortable win at Oban Celtic means that both
Oban sides are anchored at the foot of the table. Robbie MacKillop's hat
trick was the main feature of the match, which only came to life after
half-time when the teams were level at 1-1.
In the south first division, Kyles continue their surge towards the
title, accounting for Bute away from home. In the north, meanwhile,
leaders Caberfeidh had to withstand a late rally by Lovat, before
clinching a nine-goal thriller in injury time.
Skye suffered a highly damaging reversal at Kilmallie, going down by
the odd goal in three, but the biggest upset was at Lochaber, where the
home team were beaten for the first time this season.

RICHARD Corsie last night defeated world champion Andy Thomson 21-18
to land the Flogas Causeway Coast Masters title.
Corsie started well with a maximum 4 on the opening end and by the
close of the fifth end, he had forged into a 7-2 lead. Thomson tied the
match at 11-11 after 13 ends but Corsie then edged in front again. By

one shot, but a single on the next followed by a 3 helped him stand
within one of victory at 20-15. Results:

LIZ McColgan recorded the fastest 10-mile time by a British woman this
year, but was well outside the UK record as she won the BUPA Great South
Run in Portsmouth yesterday.
McColgan, racing the distance for the first time, clocked 53min 12sec
in very warm conditions, for her third win in three weeks. Attacking
Jill Hunter's UK best of 51-40, she covered the opening three miles
inside 15 minutes, and admitted: ''I went off much too fast -- but if
you want to break records, then you have to go for it from the
beginning.''
McColgan will race a further 10k, in Coventry next Sunday, before
altitude training in Mexico, preparing for the Tokyo Marathon next
month.
Kenyan Benson Masya produced the fastest 10-mile performance in
Britain, 45-56, beating British runner-up Gary Staines by almost two
minutes. He took six seconds from Richard Nerurkar's UK best, finishing
18 seconds outside the world record set by countryman Ismael Kirui in
Washington this year. Result:
Men: 1, B Masya (Kenya) 45-56; 2, G Staines (Belgrave) 47-47; 3, E
Wanderi (Kenya) 49-08. Women: 1, L McColgan (Dundee Hawkhill) 53-12; 2,
K McCandless (Parkside) 54-31; 3, S Rigg (Warrington) 56-55.
* KAREN Macleod, recovered from a mystery nerve pain in her foot which
forced her out of the World Half Marathon championships, won a 20.6k
race yesterday in Thasalonika. The Edinburgh AC runner clocked 70-40, 25
seconds clear of Poland's Lydia Camburg.
* SCOTTISH records fell in yesterday's British Wheelchair Grand Prix
10,000m road race at Batley. Scottish Commonwealth Games 800m
internationalist Ross Low (Red Star) improved his own Scottish best by
22 seconds, finishing sixth in 24-48, with clubmate Robert Bird seventh
in 26-03. Karen Lewis (Red Star) sliced more than a minute from her
record with 34-25, while George Wemyss set a quadraplegic record of
35-19.
* VETERAN Bob Brown was fifth in the European Firefighters' 10,000m
Road Race Championships at Leverkusen, Germany, leading Strathclyde Fire
Brigade to victory in the international team championship over Germany

WINDS muscled in with a vengeance on the twin, late-season tracks on
the Clyde, giving testing work for crews racing off Inverkip and Largs.
Both venues had an overdose of gales a week ago and their scheduled
opening races were cancelled but yesterday, despite strong gusts, racing
went ahead.
Robert and David Macleman, in their vintage IOR design Bolero 35,
Highwayman, proved a competent all-rounder, racing up and down the Largs
channel in what proved to be a moderating breeze.
The brothers scored a four-minute victory over Peter Carrick's MG 335,
Pure Magic, in Class 1, while David Clark's Jeanneau 35 OD, Eauvation,
took third place.
In the Sigma 33 class at this Autumn Series off Largs, John and Hilary
Connelly's Rover series-winning Phoenix won the opening race. Results:
Largs Autumn Series (Race 1). Sigma 33 Class -- 1, Phoenix (J and H
Connelly); 2, Rupert (J Watson); 3, Catalina (B Bower).
Class 1 -- 1, Highwayman (R and D Macleman) 2hr 26.29min; 2, Pure

Hawick 20, Gala 10
IT was the Welsh influence that did it for Hawick. Not that Mansfield
Park has imported any talent from the Principality, just that Scott
Welsh showed his value as a points scorer.
The fly-half collected all the Greens' points, as they not only
overcame their deadliest Border rivals, but notched their first home
victory of the season. A statistic hard to believe.
Few would leave the ground having been satisfied by the quality of the
rugby. There was little to savour in what is normally a mouth-watering
confrontation.
They were two ordinary sides striving for past glories. Hawick will at
least have the satisfaction of climbing back into contention in Division
One after some unexpected results elsewhere. Gala are still left
propping up the table with only one win in seven outings.
In the end the difference between the sides was Welsh's deadly boot.
In all other departments the quality of play was fairly equal . . .
equally poor.
The first half will be remembered mostly for the demonstrative
refereeing of Nick Cousins fron England, who must have known there were
four assessors in the stand. He performed admirably and the players were
never in doubt as to his rulings.
The game was over-punctuated by poor kicking from both sides but Gala
at least made attempts in the first half to use their backs. And in Mark
Moncrieff and Chris Dalgleish they had two elusive wingers who must be
frustrated at seeing so little of the ball. The Maroons were well served
by Gary Isaac, Ian Corcoran, Matthys Stolz, and Mowbray Tod in the first
40 minutes and they were unfortunate to be trailing 9-3 at the interval,
three penalty successes for Scott Welsh answered by one from the same
number of attempts by David Changleng.
The Greens gave themselves a shake after the turnround with Derek
Turnbull, Brian Renwick, and John Graham showing greater belligerence in
the rucks. However, it was the boot of Welsh that provided the points
again when he slotted his fourth successive penalty after Stolz was
first spotted throwing a punch then arguing with the referee and
incurring a 10-metre punishment which put the kick into Welsh's range.
The fly-half struck again in 50 minutes by slicing through the Gala
right wing defence and feeding powerful wing Keith Suddon. He made
further inroads and although halted five metres short, the ball squirted
loose and Welsh pounced for a try. Ironically, he failed with the
conversion.
This had come after a third Changleng penalty miss and Gala were
looking a bit downhearted.
Welsh had penalty No.5 in 71 minutes to conclude Hawick's scoring but
with three minutes to go, Gala showed their fighting spirit with a try
from Brian Swan after some poor tackling by Hawick. Changleng converted
and although Gala continued to throw the ball around in the closing
minutes, it was all too late.
Gala coach Peter Dods wasn't a happy man, but nor was he totally
despondent. He said: ''It's not all over yet. But we need to get another
win to restore confidence. And we must get points on the board. We
sorely need a reliable place kicker.''
Hawick coach Billy Murray wasn't exactly bouncing with joy but
conceded: ''It was two points and that is important.''

Melrose 26, Stirling County 27
SO, who is going to say that they can't do it now? Three weeks ago, as
they surrendered to Gala, back-to-back championships for Stirling looked
about as likely as an acquittal in the OJ trial.
The Juice walked free and, at The Greenyards on Saturday, County
confounded the jury who had them marked down as one-championship-wonders
with a first-half display which had Melrose reeling on the ropes.
Melrose, who still head the standings with five wins from seven
outings but with the four-win pack of Watsonians, Boroughmuir, and
County closing them down fast, came within a Gary Parker conversion
attempt of stealing the game in the dying seconds.
Which is not to say that Melrose did not display great strength of
character to come back from a 22-6 deficit at half-time. There was
character there aplenty but it served only to mask the fact that, for
most of the time, and for all of the opening period, Stirling were
streets ahead -- and much more streetwise -- than the Borderers.
There isn't a side in Scotland so adept at creating chances from
seemingly lost causes. It would be interesting to run some stats on the
turnover rate in Stirling's favour. Time and time again, the Stirling
pack snaffle ball from rucks and mauls to which they have no earthly
right.
And then there was Logan. The Stirling left-winger has had a funny old
season. Tall trees catch the most wind and our Kenneth, with his Herald
column and tabloid intrusion into his private life, is currently the
tallest tree in the Scottish rugby plantation.
With two rattling good tries, and a hand in another, Logan was the
star of the Stirling show. At his best, he is that rare breed of player
who can set the game alight with a streak of blinding opportunism. He
also knows where the line is and, quite simply, likes scoring tries. His
second on Saturday, following a dash from the Melrose 22 plus a bump and
a birl out of tackles by Bain and Shepherd, would not have been scored
by too many wingers in Scotland these days.
But it was up front where Melrose experienced the most trouble. In the
lineout Doddie Weir was largely subdued by Hamilton, Norval and co.
Melrose conceded, too, a penalty try when a five-metre scrummage was
brought down. Stirling boast one of the tightest scrummages in Scotland
and it was surely suicidal for the Greenyards No.8 Isaac Feaunati to
have stood off at such a crucial juncture. He was, of course, caught in
the classic back-row man's dilemma of whether to detach and police the
break, or to stay down and aid the collective scrummaging effort, but
with eight shoving seven the penalty try was always on the cards.
Craig Chalmers, who can only ever be as good as his forwards allow him
to be, kicked Melrose into the lead with a penalty goal after eight
minutes. The penalty try and Mark McKenzie's conversion put Stirling in
front four minutes later and for the rest of the first half it was all
Stirling.
Logan's first try, a penalty goal from Mark McKenzie, and a try by
Flockhart -- impressive, as was Craig Sangster -- converted by McKenzie
(Mark), put Stirling well in command, the County dominance being
countered only by a late first-half penalty goal from Gary Parker, the
winger taking over the kicking duties from an off-target Chalmers.
In the second period the Melrose fightback began with another Parker
penalty goal which he followed up with a try and conversion. Logan tried
a couple of long-range penalty attempts when wiser and less adventurous
counsel might have favoured kicks into the corner but the winger made
amends with his second, barnstorming, try.
Brave, never-say-die tries from Jimmy Turnbull and Rowen Shepherd took
Melrose to within a single point of Stirling but Parker's conversion
attempt flew wide and County were left to savour a win and to consider
the fact that if they can string together 80 minutes as good as the
opening 40 then they will, indeed, be a force in the land once again.

DEFEAT for Kirkcaldy by 21-18 at Musselburgh leaves Glasgow Accies and
Biggar out on their own at the top of the division three table.
Biggar surged to a 50-13 scoreline over winless Corstorphine.
Biggar's Western Samoan No.8 Simon Read touched down three times, and
other try-scorers were brothers Ewan and Robin McAlpine, Alan Harvie,
and Struan Jack, with Malcolm Bruce kicking three conversions and two
penalties and Graeme Watson dropping a goal.
Glasgow Accies' winger Torquil Mathewson's brace of tries in his
club's 32-0 success at Peebles takes him to the round dozen.
Accies opened with a penalty from Calum MacGregor from the kick-off
but waited until five minutes from the break before Mathewson got his
first touchdown. In the second half, Mathewson, Julian Richmond, and
Mike Davis all scored tries. MacGregor kicked three conversions and a
penalty.
Kirkcaldy went ahead at Musselburgh with a try and conversion from
John Mitchell, but Musselburgh fought back with a penalty by Neil
Lockhart. Duncan Lindsay and Stuart Campbell scored tries, with Lockhart
converting one and kicking two more penalties for the 21-18 win.
Preston Lodge won 29-9 against Grangemouth. Jim Michie and Paul
Fairweather grabbed PL's touchdowns, with David Allan dropping a goal
and Rodney Gibb kicking four penalties and two conversions.

THE times they are a-changin' was how Bob Dylan put it. Harold
Macmillan had his post-colonial winds of change blowing through the
continent of Africa. So far as rugby is concerned, International Board
chairman Bernard Lapasset said that change was inevitable. And so it
was.
The game has changed more within the last 100 days than in the past
100 years. Everybody concerned is struggling to come to terms with the
changes and some never will.
One of the by-products of the changing status of rugby union is the
increased media coverage it now attracts. Newspapers which only a couple
of years ago would have been as likely to devote space to the
Auchenshoogle chess championships as they would to the affairs of the
rugby union world have now realised that there is a lot of interest out
there and have concluded that maybe they, too, should carve out a slice
of the action. The more the merrier, I say.
Much of the attention of the traditionally non-rugby papers is still
personality based. No matter.
So far as the game is concerned -- and within certain constraints --
those with responsibility for marketing rugby, and raising the profile
of the game amidst a welter of competing interests, must realise that
there is seldom anything as bad publicity. Just publicity.
Sometimes. On Saturday, before their match against Stirling County,
Melrose called a press conference, as they saw it, to set the record
straight over an article which appeared in a Sunday newspaper last
weekend in which they were alleged to have been paying ''generous
expenses and securing the mortgages of their leading personnel''.
Not true said Melrose. Sloppy and slapdash reporting, they implied.
But as the alleged culprits were the only members of the Fourth Estate
not to turn up at the press conference, we were denied the opportunity
to hear their side of the story. Sorry on Sunday. We may never know.
However, as the same story contained reference to Border flax mills
and Melrose District Council, both of which entities do not exist, there
remains the possibility that, just perhaps, the section which reduced
Hugh Pollock, the chartered accountant and Melrose treasurer, as he puts
it, to ''blind fury'' would qualify for John Prescott's pork pie award
as well.
Here, then, is an imperfect example of the way in which the reporting
of the game has changed in recent years. Groin strains are now on the
back-burner and three cheers for that. The issues are now receiving the
kind of airing that they never did a couple of years ago.
And an issue which is perplexing me currently is the Scottish Rugby
Union's continuing refusal to make public the sentences passed on those
miscreants who fall foul of the referee and depart for an early bath.
They are wrong, wrong, wrong. The deliberations of the disciplinary
hearing always leak out in any case and in the context of the
International Board's new ''open'' game it surely cannot make any kind
of sense to keep secret the sentence passed for an offence which was
committed in such a public arena as a game of rugby football.
The Stirling County player Murray Fraser, who was sent off for
allegedly head-butting an opponent last week, will be before the beaks
soon. If the sentence is made public, along with the pertinent section
of the referee's report, then at least all concerned will better able to
come to a reasoned conclusion on whether or not the sentence was merited
and there would be less grounds for the kind of disgruntlement that
Kelso coach Eric Paxton feels over his man Darren Howlett being banned
for 16 weeks.
If the sentence is fair, and seen to be fair, then the SRU have
nothing to fear or feel uncomfortable about. I've not spoken to a player
or a coach who believes that the current system stands up to scrutiny.
At a time when all around is change, this is one change which would be
so much for the better.

Watsonians 23,
Edinburgh Academicals 31
THE old doubt about the ability of Watsonians' pack to deliver a
championship title resurfaced on Saturday as Edinburgh Academicals,
humiliated a week earlier by Hawick, gave a reminder that driving
forward play can be effective even when conditions invite a more
expansive approach.
Somehow in spite of much individual talent in the Watsonian eight --
one thinks of Tom Smith, Murray Rudkin, and Cameron Mather in particular
-- the aggregate of the parts is a good deal less than the whole.
Particularly worrying for Watsonians must be their inability to secure
their own ball at the lineout and their loose defence round the fringes.
Melrose exposed this latter weakness; so did Academicals.
On the matter of lineout ball, the fast-maturing Scott Murray had
something of a field day, despite the fact that, in the absence of Andy
Adamson -- a late call-off -- the young lock forward was a veritable
one-man band.
Moreover, one could hardly be unimpressed with Murray's all-round play
promoting the thought that the 6ft 7in' youngster could be Scotland's
next Doddie Weir.
Murray's two-handed take from the throw of debutant hooker Ken Day
made the first try for Academicals, the young lock being driven 15
metres to the try line before the promising Barry Stewart burrowed over
for the score. A good try -- but where were the Watsonian blockers?
Academicals again showed the difference in power up front when Murray
and Dave McIvor made short drives before Martin Waite -- in splendid
form on Saturday -- forced his way over for a try.
The Murray-McIvor combination also made the initial dent to produce a
second-half try for Day, the score which gave Academicals a 26-13 lead
and the definite scent of victory.
To their credit, Watsonians responded in the way that has brought them
success this season -- by using their talented back division --
resulting in tries by John Kerr and Mark te Whaiti.
But without Duncan Hodge, absent after picking up an injury in a
Cyprus tens tournament, the Myreside backs lacked their usual poise,
albeit that Scott Hastings, before he retired with a rib cartilage
injury, produced several good breaks.
Having watched the try of the month by Jamie Weston in Watsonians'
match against Boroughmuir, one can easily see why the Myreside men are
so enthusiastic about running the ball from deep positions.
It is of course a gamble and despite the ''who dares wins''
philosophy, such tactics can be costly. Against Academicals the risk
failed when Gavin Hastings' attempt to run the ball out of defence
foundered, resulting in an easy try for Simon Burns.
But if there was a hint of opportunism about Burns' score then the
visitors had a final positive say when Ken Baillie, the former
Hutchesons' and Scottish Schools full back, scored a fine try in the
corner to seal the match.
This Academicals side, in restoring their won credibility, exposed
fundamental flaws in Watsonians' game.

Hastings J Weston; T Smith, G McKelvie, M Stanaway, G Hannah, M Rudkin,

West of Scotland 21,
Dundee HS FP 12
BEFORE the league campaign kicked off, most pundits would have backed
GHK as the most likely Glasgow side to gain promotion. With exactly half
the fixtures played, however, the Glasgow challenge is coming not from
Anniesland but from Burnbrae.
While the poor form of GHK can in part be blamed on their horrendous
catalogue of injuries, the cause of the rise of West's fortunes is more
difficult to define.
What tangibles can explain how a young side which gave the ball away
at the contact points with alarming regularity can, in a few short
weeks, have developed into a powerhouse outfit producing that rare
commodity this season -- exciting running rugby.
West were simply a revelation on Saturday and while coach Sandy
Service was critical that their workrate had slackened in the last
quarter, he felt that there was no other second-division side which
could have lived with his team in that first hour.
West's first sortie realised a penalty for Dave Barrett after a
softish award for a late tackle on the stand-off. Within minutes they
had added a try -- prop David Jamieson touching down following a scrum
five. The build-up had featured controlled mauling and driving, crisp
handling, and quick ball regeneration.
The pattern continued and only resolute Dundee defence and errant
goal-kicking by Alan Williamson held the score to 8-0.
Two quick scores immediately after the interval -- a Barrett penalty
and a Gordon Bulloch try courtesy of Barrett's deft pass, converted by
Barrett -- gave a truer reflection of the home dominance.
In the last quarter Rod James and Ian Hope managed tries for the
visitors, Chris Robinson converting the second score, but between the
touchdowns Barrett kept his side comfortably ahead with a lazily struck
drop goal which just crept over.
West of Scotland -- T Greenshields; D Riding, A Bulloch, R Little, A
Williamson; D Barrett, F Stott; S McGregor, G Bulloch, D Jamieson, S
McKechnie, G Perrett, D McLeish, J Shaw, J Lonergan.

JUST minutes before a torrential tropical rainstorm swept across the
course, battling Brad Bryant ended his own personal drought by winning
the $1.2m Walt Disney World Classic in Orlando, Florida, yesterday.
Bryant, in his 460th US Tour event, parred the final hole to record
his first victory in his eighteenth season on tour.
He sank his winning putt from two feet for a closing four-under-par 68
on the Magnolia course. He finished at 18-under 198 in the
rain-shortened event, one ahead of fellow Americans Hal Sutton (66) and
Ted Tryba (65), both of whom finished hours earlier.
Bryant collects $216,000, a place in next year's Masters and, most
probably, the $3m US Tour Championship in a fortnight. Leading scores:
198 -- Brad Bryant 67, 63, 68. 199 -- Hal Sutton 67, 66, 66; Ted Tryba
69, 65, 65. 201 -- Mike Reid 68, 66, 67; Joe Acosta 68, 67, 66; Bob Tway
65, 70, 66.
* NORTH rallied to a singles success yesterday at Edzell to beat Angus
5-4 and land only their second Scottish Area Team Championship.
Trailing 2-1 after the foursomes, North, whose only other victory came
in 1977, won four out of the six singles matches. The clinching point
came when Stewart McIntosh defeated former Scottish Amateur finalist Len
Salariya at the third extra hole.
Angus had an 8-1 semi-final victory over Argyll and Bute on Saturday
while North scraped past Lanarkshire 5-4. Final details:
Foursomes (Angus names first) -- G Tough and M Brown beat R Beames and
N Hampton, 5 and 4; G Hemsley and P Cunningham beat R Shiels and E
Forbes, 2 and 1; L Salariya and W Taylor lost to S McIntosh and B Wann,
3 and 2.
Singles -- Tough beat Hampton, 2 and 1; Hemsley lost to Beames, 2 and
1; Brown lost to Forbes, 2 and 1; Cunningham lost to Wann, 2 and 1;
Salariya lost to McIntosh, at 21st; Taylor beat Shiels, 1 hole.
* IRELAND'S Liam Higgins pulled off his first win of the season when
he retained his Lexus Trophy Seniors title with a five-shot win at the
Breitenloo club near Zurich on Saturday. Leading scores (British or
Irish unless stated):
206 -- L Higgins 69, 70, 67 (#9170). 211 -- R Vines (Australia) 70,
66, 75, (#6000). 212 -- T Horton 72, 72, 68; V Tshabalala (S Africa) 71,
70, 71; D Butler 71, 70, 71; B Waites 72, 69, 71; M Gregson 72, 69, 71;
J Morgan 72, 69, 71; D Creamer 70, 69, 73 (#2315 each).
* KEN Hutton and Lee Vannet shot one-over-par 73s in windy conditions
yesterday to share top prize in the Carnoustie Pro-Am. Leading scores:
73 -- K Hutton (Downfield), L Vannet (Carnoustie). 74 -- G Jack
(Kirriemuir), R Weir (Cowal). 75 -- F Mann (Musselburgh). 77 -- C Brooks
(Glencorse), I Young (Braid Hills), C Maltman (Eyemouth), S Henderson
(Kings Links). Team: 61 -- G Harvey (Grangemouth) G Hall, D Tully, G
Blair (Bowring).
* SCOTLAND'S Simon Yates shot a final-round 70 to finish on 290, seven
off the pace in the #333,000 Western Dubai Creek Open yesterday.
Australia's Robert Willis won after a play-off with Jamnian Chitprasong
of Thailand.
* GLEDDOCH, represented by assistant pro Craig Orr and amateur partner
Scott Garrett, narrowly failed to win the Lombard Top Club Trophy at San
Lorenzo, Portugal, yesterday. They ended their two fourball rounds on
nine-under-par 135, one too many to join eventual winners Kent's
Sundridge Park and Princes Risborough in a play-off.
* SCOTTISH girls' champion Laura Moffat, of West Kilbride, added the
West of Scotland Girls' title at the weekend at Troon Portland. She
defeated Cawder's Fiona Prior by 4 and 3 in the final.

Jed-Forest 32, Currie 16
IT WAS a good day all round for Jethart. The local shop sold every
copy of Gary's new book that he could sign, he and his mates brought the
unbeaten record of Currie to an abrupt end, and the pensioners were
treated to their tea and a brass band recital.
This was always going to be a critical game in determining how things
would go at the top of Division Two of the SRU Tennent's Premiership,
and although Currie still lead this morning, they know that they have a
Jed-Forest team snapping at their heels and more determined than ever
that the title will be theirs.
And, having had a chance to see most of the opposition in action, it
is difficult to imagine that, injuries permitting, Jed should not grow
in stature and realise the goal of promotion and even the league flag.
It would be easy to record that the return of Gary Armstrong made all
the difference to the performance, but that would be to ignore the huge
contribution every player makes to the smooth operation of this
impressive side.
The relief on every face around the ground as he trotted off having
completed his first full game for 18 months was clear. The international
scrum half is back and took great delight in reminding his colleagues
who had, tongue firmly in cheek, given him the ''eggshell'' tag.
Jed had rung the changes for this vital match, switching Gareth Scott
to inside centre to allow a rejuvenated Gregor McKechnie to team up with
Armstrong. Add to that a superb back row trio of Kevin Armstrong,
skipper Ronnie Kirpatrick, and Calum Brown and you find what is making
Jed tick.
No surprise, perhaps, that they played a part in all of the tries and
contributed to an 18-point half-time lead which never looked like being
threatened.
Currie were never allowed to look like league leaders, and their late
tries owed more to some of their opponents being a shade short of peak
fitness than to any real hint of gaining the upper hand.
Ally Donaldson was never allowed to dictate the game as he so often
does, and young Ross Hunter had a torrid afternoon dealing with the
close attentions of the Armstrong brothers and their cohorts Kirkpatrick
and Brown.
Some of the visiting forwards spent too much time mixing it to pose
any real threat and if they had come bent on intimidation they had
called at the wrong address.
Richards opened the scoring with a penalty goal and a minute later
Gary's interplay with the back row from halfway released Kevin Amos to
squeeze over in the corner for a try.
Donaldson and Chris Richards traded penalty goals before McKechnie
broke, the forwards drove, and Gary Armstrong was unstoppable from five
metres out. Richards converted and added two further penalty goals to
put the visitors on the rack with just a second Donaldson penalty goal
to show for their first half efforts.
A dreadful mix-up as Currie dropped out led to a scrum from which Gary
and the back row combined again to release Amos for his second try
before Richards stroked over his fifth penalty goal.
A short penalty ploy, with Donaldson the link, gave David Wilson the
first of two consolation tries, the second of which went to Bruce Ward
from injury time pressure by the visitors.

IT WAS bad boys' day in the basement on Saturday, with four players
earning red cards.
All will be suspended for next weekend's games, but not one point was
lost on the day through any of the indiscretions.
The one match free of red cards was at Dingwall, where Livingston at
last played in front of the size of crowd their exploits deserve.
Jim Leishman's men did forfeit their 100% record, but ever-reliable
Jason Young silenced the crowd of 2209 with a last-minute header after
Colin Milne's sixth-minute penalty had looked sure to give Ross County
the points.
Livingston thus remain unbeaten as they prepare to complete the first
quarter of the campaign next weekend with a home game against Brechin
City, who will not be in the best shape after a home defeat by Albion
Rovers in a match which had eight bookings.
The sending-off of John Gallagher early in the second half was an
unlikely prelude to Rovers' second straight win, courtesy of defender
Gordon Young's shot. Earlier Brechin's Sandy Ross saw his penalty saved
by Marc Osborne.
Rovers moved up two places to fourth bottom thanks to a draw at
Hampden, where Alloa's Kenny Hannah was sent off in the goalless draw
against Queen's Park. Alloa's Robert Balfour saved a penalty from Dave
Graham.
Cowdenbeath also survived the departure of an offender, Brian Malloy,
seven minutes from time and they held out for a draw against Arbroath.
David Scott had shot the Fifers into a half-time lead and Lee Gardiner
equalised.
East Stirlingshire's Alan Neill was the only early-bath sinner to be
on a losing side, but bottom-of-the-table 'Shire were already trailing
to a Dave Brennan strike on the stroke of half-time for Caley Thistle.
Neill went off with 25 minutes left and the Highlanders continued their
recent revival with goals from Dave Ross, Iain Stewart, Colin Mitchell,
and Stewart again.

CLYDE'S Paul Patterson is something of an Alan Lawrence lookalike and
the ''Nipper'' clone showed enough skill against Stranraer at Broadwood
on Saturday to maintain the illusion.
Like Lawrence, Patterson has the pace to trouble defences and he
celebrated his first start for the top team by scoring the goal which
gave Clyde the lead midway in the first half when he drove the ball in
following a corner.
According to Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie, half of his players
''should have paid to get in'' on the basis of their lack of
contribution to the proceedings before the interval and, in fact, Clyde
would have been beyond recall but for two point-blank saves by Stevie
Ross from Patterson.
The visitors showed more commitment after the break and soon were on
level terms when Darren Henderson beat keeper John Hillcoat to Tommy
Callaghan's lob from halfway.
They ended up good value for the 1-1 draw and, in spite of a bad start
to the campaign, Stranraer could go second in the division by beating
rivals Forfar and Berwick in the next two weeks.
East Fife player-manager Steve Archibald led by example at Berwick,
where he scored the only goal 17 minutes from time as his team forged
five points clear. Their position was made even cosier through a
remarkable score at Forfar.
It is not often that a third-placed team loses 6-0 at home but it
happened to Forfar at the hands of Stirling Albion. Lanky Steve
McCormick led the rout with a hat trick, Ian McInnes hit a double, and
Craig Taggart completed the scoring.
Stenhousemuir cruised to victory over Montrose with Paul Logan, Miller
Mathieson, and Gareth Hutchison all finding the net in the first
half-hour. Shaun Smith reduced the leeway.
The rival fans of Queen of the South and Ayr both deserve better than
the lack of quality demonstrated by the goalless draw at Dumfries.

Dundee 3, St Mirren 1
THE fickle nature of the football fan was portrayed to the letter in a
display of contrasting behaviour by St Mirren's enduring support at Dens
Park on Saturday, with manager Jimmy Bone again starring in the role of
prime suspect as his side slumped to defeat at the hands of Dundee.
His managerial hands having been well and truly tied behind his back
when it came to selecting his starters for the Tayside task -- Bone had
only 14 from out of a playing staff in excess of 30 to pick from -- the
pre-match odds were scarcely in his favour.
So, with his side having reached the halfway mark only a goal behind a
Dundee outfit which had dominated the opening period, it came as a
surprise to hear the bayings of the faithful demanding Bone's head on a
platter.
The interval having had a soothing effect on the fans, there followed
a quite remarkable change in attitude as Saints resumed battle in a mood
promising better things.
The volume of the supporters' backing matched the newly found
enthusiasm on the pitch as Saints suddenly threatened to make serious
inroads into contesting the issue with a home side which increasingly
looked to have shot its bolt.
However, thanks to the goalkeeping qualities of Frenchman Michel
Pageaud, netbound efforts from Mark Yardley, Brian Hetherston, and Paul
McIntyre were all redirected wide of the target.
And with them went St Mirren's chances of staging a comeback, as Jim
Duffy's men gave themselves a shake as to the unfinished task in hand.
Before you could say Jim Hamilton and Morten Wieghorst, Dundee's
scorers after 66 and 73 minutes, the Saints' supporters had assumed the
nastier side of their Jekyll and Hyde characters.
John Boyd drove in a quite memorable 20-yarder to reward the visitors
with some minor consolation five minutes from the end, but that did
little to affect the planned reception for Bone on the final whistle.
Afterwards, he shrugged off the demonstration as ''part and parcel''
of the modern game, and appealed to those behind it to offer suggestions
as to a solution in the present circumstances. The manager said he would
be only too ready to listen to anything constructive.
While the visitors continued to puzzle their problems, the hosts
admitted satisfaction at getting back on the winning ways, their
first-half lead being produced by striker Paul Tosh, who shrugged off a
couple of tackles before finding the net from 15 yards.

* THERE was dancing in the streets of Deveronvale on Saturday, and
probably much of Sunday, as the tiny Banff club celebrated reaching the
Scottish Cup for the first time in 35 years.
But for the first time in five seasons, Huntly, the most feared club
in the Highland League, will not be entering the Scottish Cup draw.
A magnificent fighting display, and two goals midway through the
second half, gave unfancied Fraserburgh a famous win.
Super-sub Ian Murray was only two minutes on the field when he set up
Jim Young's opener for Fraserburgh in 67 minutes. Just four minutes
later, Murray broke clear to complete a 2-0 win.
Deveronvale made a wee bit of history with a 2-1 win at Elgin. Steve
Dolan gave them an early lead and Eddie Wolecki made it two before
half-time. Elgin fought back and scored through John Hardie in 65
minutes, despite John MacDonald's sending off. But when Iain Polworth
joined MacDonald for an early bath with 15 minutes left, City's chance
was gone.
Keith claimed their place with a John Wilson double and another from
Scott Taylor giving them a 3-2 win at home to Peterhead.
Lossiemouth clinched the fourth semi-final place with a 2-1 win at
Buckie.
In the league, Clach stumbled to a 2-2 draw at home to Wick Academy.
Fort William won 3-2 at Nairn, and Brora drew 0-0 with Forres.

Hibernian 2, Falkirk 1
KEVIN McALLISTER could see the whites of his friends' eyes in the
Falkirk end at Easter Road as he thumped Hibernian's winner past Billy
Lamont. His goal was the second blow from the ''old boys'' in four days
for the Brockville club, after John Hughes' winning header for Celtic in
Falkirk on Wednesday night.
And the former Chelsea and Falkirk winger virtually read the script
when he met up with his mates in the town after the match.
''Scoring against them didn't make the goal any sweeter for me, and I
know for certain I'll get stick from my mates for days,'' he explained.
''The last thing that I want to see is the five years of hard work and
progress at Brockville beginning to be undone.
''But I'm a professional and my job here is not to worry about what is
happening to them, but to get on with doing the business for Hibs.
''And really, that was made easy for me on Saturday because I was
virtually given the freedom of the right wing by the way they played.
''It was a really enjoyable comeback after injury, although I had to
come off after the goal, because I have not been able to do any
training.''
The winger finished superbly after 57 minutes, but he would no doubt
direct his gratitude toward the brilliance of Kevin Harper, who superbly
created the close-in chance.
The 19-year-old Scotland Under-21 star simply streaked away from the
Falkirk back four before cutting back the perfect pass right into
McAllister's stride.
Earlier, Hibs had to thank referee Eric Martindale for the goal that
allowed Darren Jackson to shoot them ahead from the penalty spot after
half an hour.
It was impossible to see why the match official could decide David
Weir had pushed Gareth Evans, just inside the penalty area, when in
truth both players were nudging each other.
Falkirk's players protested furiously, and manager John Lambie refused
to discuss the incident until he watched television footage, but the
decision clearly was a turning point.
However, Falkirk recovered from that blow and came close to rescuing a
draw from a lost cause after Scott McKenzie dragged them back into the
argument when he punished a Stephen Tweed error after 68 minutes.
''That's the best we've played all season, but the bottom line still
is we have come away with nothing,'' complained Lambie.
With Steve Fulton and Derek Ferguson spraying impressive passes from
the centre of their midfield, and Mo Johnston typically inventive up
front, Falkirk are not far away.
But Lambie knows he needs to find urgently a striker with a real
cutting edge to capitalise on Johnston's industry, if real progress is
to be made.

Motherwell 0, Raith Rovers 2
IT WAS almost as though they could not believe it themselves, a dream
perhaps that some secretly wished would be concluded, to get back to
normal if you like, but there is little sign of that just now.
Raith Rovers' players once again were under the spotlight after the
ball had stopped rolling at Fir Park, and as Motherwell's lot drifted
almost unnoticed, out of the stadium, it was the gifted ones from Fife,
some uneasy and apprehensive at being the centre of attraction, who had
microphones thrust to their lips and with some journalists hanging on
their every syllable.
Raith's rise from almost obscurity to prominence under Jimmy Nicholl
has been staggering, and judging by the style of this latest success,
there will be more glamorous clubs brought to heel before much longer.
Nicholl spoke quietly about his men's work, but the Irishman could
have been forgiven for wishing to punch the air in glee after Raith had,
at least in the second period, given Motherwell a tutorial in the finer
points of the sport.
However, matters have not always been so sweet this season. ''We had
been playing well at home this season,'' said the manager. ''So when we
played Rangers and Aberdeen, we said we would take the game to them.
That was fine until they scored, and the next thing we knew we were four
down. We've changed things now with Ronnie Coyle giving us more
insurance at the back.
''There's a good atmosphere about the place, and things are looking
hopeful. The club is in a great financial position and a great place in
the league compared to two years ago.''
Alex McLeish poured himself a shandy and sighed deeply, gathering his
thoughts while children in Motherwell tops kicked a make-shift ball
around and shouted as they ''scored'' outside the manager's window. The
little lads apparently found something to cheer and excite them. McLeish
was less fortunate.
''The second-half performance was probably the worst since I arrived
at the club,'' he said. ''We were shapeless. Raith deserved to win.''
With the first half drawing to a conclusion, Julian Broddle took a
throw-in deep in Motherwell's half, cutting out two statuesque defenders
in the process. The ball dropped at Jason Dair's toes, and he simply
drew back his right foot and belted the ball past Scott Howie.
The second was spectacular, if surprising, even to the scorer, David
Sinclair. The defender looks like the kind of guy that Rottweilers come
to for help in a tight spot, but his accuracy was finite when he ''took
a touch and just hit it. I don't know how I did it, mind you,'' he said.
''I was just delighted to see it going in.''
Two strangers, employees of Bayern Munich, sat in the stand minding
their own business. They were startled when Raith's Jim McInally
innocently sent the ball zooming towards them, being caught by a fan
before it dirtied the Germans' hands. Will this be the last time Raith
give Bayern people cause for concern?

Aberdeen 0, Rangers 1
THERE was really no need for Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken to lecture us
at the after-match press conference at Pittodrie on how we should report
the game.
No-one, not even the most committed Rangers supporter, would have said
anything other than that the Ibrox side were fortunate to return to
Ibrox with all three points.
But there was a salient point for the rest of the premier division
clubs, and for his own club, too, that Aitken didn't mention as he
talked of how his team had given Rangers ''a hiding.''
This was a patched-up Ibrox side, with five first-choice players
missing from the starting line-up, two more playing while carrying
nagging injuries, and another forced back into action after an injury
lay-off without the benefit of a run in the reserves.
And, yet, Rangers won the game and remained at the top of the table,
pushing Aberdeen further behind them.
That they could do this without major stars is a problem for the rest
of Scottish football. Aberdeen, in contrast, had been unchanged for nine
games and, therefore, were able to benefit from a continuity of
selection.
This, of course, remains the problem for the Ibrox team and for
manager Walter Smith. No sooner do they get one player back than another
limps out of the campaign.
After the game, midfielder Stuart McCall, whose tigerish tackling and
non-stop running made him one of Rangers' most effective players at
Aberdeen, pointed out the problems his side have faced.
''If you take a look at the defence, where there have been fewer
changes than in the rest of the team, then you can see the benefit of
continuity,'' he said. ''Our defence has been the most effective part of
the team, especially in recent games, while, middle to front, we have
been struggling a little because of the changes we have been forced to
make in these areas.
''Aberdeen have had nine or 10 games unchanged -- I wish we had had
that luxury. If so, then our performance today would have been so much
better. I don't think any of us were particularly happy with the way we
played but the result was tremendous.
''The manager doesn't look too far ahead when he is looking at the
league programme. However, there are times when he sets us three-game
targets, and he did that last week. He spoke to us before we went to
Celtic Park about the importance of the games against Celtic,
Motherwell, and Aberdeen -- with two of them away from home. So, at the
end of that test, we have come out with maximum points. Yet, before this
game we might have settled for a draw with the position we found
ourselves in.''
McCall then praised the performances of the defence this season. He
said: ''We had another clean sheet today and that is down to the way the
lads at the back are playing. Richard Gough has been so consistent and
Gordan Petric and Alan McLaren have been solid alongside him. Then we
have the best goalkeeper in Europe -- Andy Goram -- behind them.
''Andy had one superb save in the second half from Eoin Jess, but that
is what we have come to expect from him.''
The goal which decided the match came from second-half substitute
Craig Moore following a free kick from McCall. The midfielder's curling
kick eluded Petric and Gough as well as the Aberdeen defence and Moore
was there, lurking at the far post, to bend low and head the ball over
the line.
In the remaining 11 minutes Aberdeen did their best to save the game
but, as McCall indicated, they ran into this new Iron Curtain defence
that Rangers have constructed.
Afterwards, when Aitken had finished instructing us on how the various
reports should be written, he declared: ''I'm obviously disappointed
with the result. I would have to be, after the hiding we gave Rangers
this afternoon.
''Football is a cruel game, as my players found out today, but if we
continue to give performances like that then we will win a fair
percentage of our games and will be in there challenging at the end of
the season.''
Certainly, there is no comparison between the Aberdeen of this season
and the disorganised and disgruntled group of players Aitken took over
early this year when they were favourites to be relegated to the first
division.
However, if they are to challenge then they may have to add some of
the grit McCall gives Rangers in midfield, and they must win games like
these when the opportunity presents itself, as it did on Saturday.
The weakened champions would happily have settled for a draw and, when
they are this vulnerable, then teams with title ambitions must kill them
off.
It is the one hope they have of stopping the Ibrox juggernaut.

St Johnstone 1, Airdrie 0
EDINBURGH referee Martin Clark was working overtime at Perth on
Saturday. He booked five St Johnstone players, two from Airdrie, and
sent off visiting skipper Jimmy Sandison.
But his day didn't end with the final whistle. There was an
after-match incident which resulted in the Diamonds' central defender
Sean Sweeney, who was one of those booked during the match, being
summoned to the referee's room.
A clearly angry Airdrie manager, Alex MacDonald, said later that after
30 years in football he had never heard anything like it.
Choosing his words carefully, he said: ''I have heard a decision about
one of our players and it is being reported to the SFA. It is for
ungentlemanly conduct.''
MacDonald agreed that it was Sweeney who had been summoned, but
stressed that the involvement had been with ''one of the match
officials'' which seemed to suggest the differences had been with a
linesman.
At any rate, Airdrie intend presenting a counter-case and MacDonald
said that the club would be making its own report on the official
concerned to the SFA.
As for the game itself, MacDonald felt that his team had been trying
to play football but had sometimes overdone it. His men had still been
pushing forward even after the loss of Sandison for a professional foul
on Kevin Twaddle in 57 minutes.
Coventry's assistant manager Gordon Strachan took in the game and was
no doubt running the rule over St Johnstone's talented Northern Ireland
youth internationalist Danny Griffin.
The 18-year-old midfielder was playing his fourth game in eight days
and it did show when the Perth side's manager, Paul Sturrock, withdrew
him in 72 minutes.
The star of the match was another midfielder. Saints' Phil Scott had a
particularly good first half and slotted home the only goal of the game
after six minutes.
Saints should have had the game sewn up at half-time and it was the
same story after the break, with Griffin spooning over from a good
position. Englishman Mark Proctor, who replaced Griffin, blazed the ball
over the top with only John Martin to beat.
The players booked were John O'Neil, David Irons, Gary Farquhar, Paul
Cherry, and George O'Boyle, of Saints, and Airdrie's Paul Jack and
Sweeney.

MARYHILL and Pollok had contrasting fortunes on Saturday in their
build-up to next week's clash in the first round of the OVD Cup.
Pollok had a convincing 2-0 victory over Kilsyth Rangers in the Reebok
League, despite having centre forward John Paisley red-carded in the
second half. Ten-man Pollok went ahead through new signing from
Stranraer, Paul McLean. Darren Stewart tied up the points late on.
Maryhill manager Ronnie McDonald will require to restore confidence in
his ranks following their comprehensive 5-0 defeat by Arthurlie.
League leaders Arthurlie went ahead in seven minutes when a mistake by
keeper Thomson allowed McCafferty to net. Scott Archer converted the
second from the penalty spot after defender McAllister handled and
man-of-the-match Jamie Donnachie made it three before half-time.
Despite heroics from substitute keeper Archie McLean in the second
half, he couldn't stop Arthurlie going further ahead with strikes from
Crichton and McCafferty.
Scott Miller, Shettleston's new signing from Clydebank, made an
immediate impact on his debut against Larkhall. He laid on the first for
Joe Gardner and scored himself late on. Paddy Kelly was the other
scorer.
An Alan Hendry hat trick gave high-scoring Renfrew -- 10 goals in
their past two games -- a share of the points in their 5-5 draw with
Coltness. Down 4-2 with 15 minutes to go, Renfrew fought back to level.
Auchinleck unveiled last season's league-winners' flag prior to their
game with Irvine Meadow on Saturday. But this turned out to be the
highlight of the afternoon as the teams fought out a dull 0-0 draw.
Cumnock bounced back from last week's defeat by Meadow to dump Beith
3-1. An outstanding display by Beith's veteran keeper Robert Hamilton
helped keep the score level at half-time. However, strikes by Sinclair,
Irving (penalty), and Montgomery took Cumnock through to the next round
of the Irvine Times Cup.
A Dave Reilly goal two minutes from time against Downfield took
Tayport to the top of the AT&amp;T League.

Clydebank 1, Morton 0
AT the age of 35, Bankies' striker Ken Eadie is no longer required to
get back and defend at corners, free kicks, or any other time for that
matter.
On Saturday, after 76 lonely and fruitless minutes running the front
line, he stretched out his old right leg and the ball was in the net for
the only goal of a torrid game.
Coach Brian Wright said later he had thought long and hard about
allowing Eadie this season to remain upfield to preserve his energy.
''In the dressing room the reaction to the goal was one of 'typically
Eadie,' but maybe he is not given enough credit for what he does. He
leads the line well and has a good finish.''
But Wright went out of his way to praise each and every player in a
team built for free except for Eadie, bought nine years ago for #35,000.
''There was a lot of commitment, work, and effort -- words we in
football still use. But there was also a lot of skill and we are doing
well,'' said Wright.
Morton, on the other hand, were deplorable, as was the football --
manager Allan McGraw's words, not mine.
That display, however, could be a blessing in disguise for the
Greenock side. ''They cannot go out and expect the game will take care
of itself; they need to work for it, they need to give themselves a kick
up the backside,'' said McGraw.
Morton looked good for just 10 minutes at the start, and perhaps made
only two clear chances overall as the game degenerated into a series of
individual feuds. They led to three bookings in the second half, before
and after Eadie's goal.
A long clearance by Gary Matthews was missed by centre backs John
Anderson and Dougie Johnstone, who came on for the injured Steve
McCahill at half-time. As the pair collided, Eadie escorted the ball on
before lobbing over David Wylie from 12 yards.
Colin Sutherland, who missed seven minutes of the first half after a
head wound which needed stitches, was the real Clydebank hero, however.
He repeatedly put a bandaged head in where it hurt to fend off Warren
Hawke, who outshone more illustrious names, including Marco Rajamaki.

Hamilton Accies 1, Dunfermline 3
IF Hamilton's problems were purely academical, then Iain Munro's job
would be reasonably simple. Extra homework, and more pupil tuition to
iron out the weaknesses.
Unfortunately for him, it is not that simple. The arithmetic is simple
enough -- losing too many goals, not scoring enough. The geometry has
too many rough edges, mainly because of what he describes as ''lack of
concentration,'' but the equation required to find a way back from lack
of confidence is the one which will be the most difficult to solve.
They could learn from Saturday's defeat at Firhill from Dunfermline.
The first-division leaders had been given a real kick up the nineties in
midweek when they were hammered in the Challenge Cup semi-final by
Dundee United on their own Fife patch.
Hear the words of Dunfermline manager Bert Paton: ''To come back after
that defeat was satisfying. Wednesday was a downer, but I was glad to
get back on the rails, particularly with other results favouring us.''
Paton was making reference to the fact that his side's lead now has
been increased to eight points after only eight games because Dundee
United lost at Dumbarton.
And a major boost is that striker Hamish French will play tonight,
against Unitd's reserves, for the first time since being injured in
March in a reserve match.
Back to Hamilton. Munro knows he has a mountain to climb. And so do
his players. One of the most experienced, Crawford Baptie, summed up
their plight: ''Every time we make a mistake, it's a goal. We are having
a tough time.''
Munro, as is his nature, remains defiant. ''There's a long way to go,
but we are making it very difficult for ourselves.''
Dunfermline's first goal proved that. Allan Moore, who had an
excellent match, went on a ''come-and-get-me'' run down the right after
only six minutes. Accies failed, and Moore's cross caused enough panic
for Hamilton keeper Allan Ferguson and central defender Craig Paterson
to fall over themselves in an effort to clear. As often happens, the
ball was left to take care of itself until Stewart Petrie gave it some
life with a shot which went in off a post.
Paterson had to go off within a couple of minutes of that with a badly
bruised back. Baptie, whose main role was supposed to cause trouble with
his height up front, was pulled back, but while this reorganisation was
going on, Dunfermline struck again after 22 minutes when Moore took
advantage of a superb David Bingham cross to head the ball home.
Hamilton then showed a spark of the belief that Munro wants. They hit
back with a superb header from Gary Clark from a Steven Thomson cross.
There was hope. There was defiance. There was the chance of an
equaliser, at least, as Dunfermline seemed to retreat into their shell.
It proved Munro's point when he said: ''The players are good enough to
pick themselves up. What they must do now is believe that they can do
it.''
Dunfermline had greater belief after that midweek show. They showed
the greater determination when under pressure, and Craig Robertson --
playing only his second game of the season after injury -- headed in the
killer goal from a Bingham cross, and, as they say, the game was a bogy.
In what was an intriguing game, it would be fair to say that
confidence finally had its say. Munro was not whingeing in any way when
he remarked: ''If we had been 2-1 ahead, three of our players still
would not have made a move forward to try to increase the lead.
Dunfermline did that even when we had them under pressure.
''I don't know the answer at the moment. Hard work and more
concentration may solve the situation, but the goals we are giving away
at the moment are horrendous. Their keeper was the busier in the second
half, and then we threw away that third goal. Every mistake we make
seems to be punished.''
On a lighter note, that Robertson goal was the subject of quite a bit
of banter in the Fifers' dressing room. As Bingham's cross was fired in,
Petrie reckoned he was on a certainty until Robertson nipped in front of
him to snatch the strike.
Munro's final remark still may boost an Accies side, which, if there
was an early term report, would read: ''Average but could do better.''
He said: ''If they keep feeling sorry for themselves every time they
make a mistake, they'll get nowhere. They must forget about it and get
on with the game.''
Someone with a degree in psychology may be needed for the Academical.
At least Dunfermline have proved that they can handle the bad times.

Dumbarton 1, Dundee United 0
NEWS that Dundee United expect every game to be like a cup-tie
appeared not to have reached Dumbarton. To begin with, they were baffled
hosts. What was going on had to be knocked into them. Specifically, they
saw the message being imprinted on the head and limbs of their Paul
Martin. It needed his suffering to improve the resolution of his mates.
Any graph of a memorable afternoon for the Sons would take the shape
of what used to be called a learning curve.
From being bamboozled by United's energetic aggression, Dumbarton took
a crash course in mastering it that lasted for most of the first half.
All of the second half was about putting in practice what lessons they
had picked up and enjoying them, especially a bright goal towards the
end by Martin Mooney.
Having quenched the hot fire of United, Dumbarton dished a cold
ducking. Jim Fallon, the manager, suggested that this victory showed his
team were competitive in their new division.
That was far from how it looked at first. United had an electric early
20 minutes or so, they readily got behind Dumbarton. With Christian
Dailly putting himself about to powerful effect in the middle of their
attack, United were especially threatening on the right through some
fast incursions by Mark Perry.
Gary McSwegan, in his first game, snapped up every trifle that came
his way.
Dumbarton's graduation with honours owed much to the nimble
examination of United's defence by Alan Granger. He tested Brian Welsh
to the point of making him look ungainly. Later he gave Perry some of
the same.
The Boghead side won a string of corners before the interval and a
couple of free kicks imprudently conceded by United, what with Chic
Charnley to take them.
By then Dumbarton had been strengthened by the appearance of Roland
Fabiani for the wounded Martin. Fabiani and the immense Jim Meechan were
the twin motors of Dumbarton's second-half romp.
Throughout the game, Charnley had been dropping balls into spaces
where a team might properly have been but wasn't. Although it earned him
plaudits, there was not much obvious profit in it.
Ten minutes from the end the dividend came. His well-judged cross from
the left was athletically lobbed home by Mooney in his fifth minute on
the field.
It was a goal that everybody felt coming, according to Billy Kirkwood,
the United manager, except his players. ''That's their trouble. It's
what got them into this position. They can't see what's happening,'' he
said.

Hearts 1, Coventry City 5
CRAIG Levein's big day turned into a bittersweet experience for the
Scotland defender when a mere 3500 people turned up at Tynecastle for
his testimonial match.
And to make matters worse, Hearts proceeded to get thumped 5-1 by a
Gordon Strachan-inspired Coventry City.
At 38, the former Scotland midfielder and current Coventry assistant
manager Strachan proved yet again that there's many a good tune played
on an old fiddle and he did his best to lift the occasion at every
opportunity.
Hibs-mad Strachan had even hinted beforehand that his side would play
in their change strip of green-and-white just for badness. But in the
event, Coventry paraded in their familiar sky-blue colours.
Levein couldn't play in his own game because of the knee injury which
has sidelined him recently. But with daughter Christie as a mascot, he
kicked off proceedings and was then replaced by David Hagen, who put
Hearts in front in just seven minutes.
All that did was make Coventry move up a gear and by half-time the
English Premiership side were in control.
Three minutes after Hagen's goal, John Salako hit the equaliser.
Another five minutes and Ghanaian striker Nil Lamptey put City in front,
and four minutes from the break Lamptey was brought down in the box by
Colin Miller and Peter Ndlovu scored from the spot.
Hearts tried their best to reduce the leeway in the second half, and
came close on a couple of occasions, most notably when two shots came
crashing back off the bar in the space of a couple of seconds.
But six minutes from time, Ndlovu struck City's fourth, and right on
time Salako rubbed salt in the wounds with the fifth.
''There were obviously a few factors which contributed to the turnout,
but I would just like to say a big thanks to the fans who did come
along,'' said Levein.
Among the watching spectators was Hearts' new signing Neil Pointon,
who was denied his debut because clearance hadn't come through to allow
him to play.
But despite the scoreline, he's happy enough with his cross-Border
move.
''I found out on Friday night that Hearts were interested and I had no
second thoughts about coming to Scotland,'' said the former Oldham
Athletic player.

Kilmarnock 3, Hearts 1
THERE are those of my generation who remember Hearts meeting
Kilmarnock on the last day of a season in what was a championship
decider. Kilmarnock won that, too, but the only resemblance between the
Tynecastle troops of 1965 and the ones who played at Rugby Park at the
weekend was that they wore maroon shirts.
There is no doubt that Hearts are facing a crisis and that manager Jim
Jefferies is facing a much bigger job than he perhaps thought when he
uprooted himself from Falkirk in the summer and moved to the club he
supported and played for.
Last midweek, after a home defeat by Aberdeen, Jefferies said:
''Either the players can't take anything in, or they are just not good
enough. Their effort is fine, but the bottom line is maybe they don't
have it.''
He could have repeated that line at the end of the 90 minutes at Rugby
Park, where Kilmarnock won their first league match of the season with a
great deal of comfort after they had come from a goal behind. It is true
that young goalkeeper Gary O'Connor let the Ayrshire side back into the
match when he made a dreadful blunder just before the interval, but the
21-year-old was certainly not to blame for what happened after that.
It is the more experienced players who are letting down Hearts at the
moment, and Jefferies may be tempted to take encouragement from the
showing of young left back Paul Ritchie and, to a certain extent,
O'Connor to turn to the youth at Tynecastle to try to find a way out of
trouble.
''Paul Ritchie was one of the plusses for me today,'' said Jefferies.
''And I'm not going to blame Gary O'Connor for us losing the points.
Okay, we were coasting, Kilmarnock were edgy, and we had no problems
whatsoever. The young lad had settled in well then he made an
unfortunate mistake.''
That came in 43 minutes when Hearts were riding on a wave of
confidence after an Alan Lawrence header had put them in front. Davie
McPherson conceded a free kick out on the left and when Tom Black sent
in a cross, O'Connor, under pressure from Neil Whitworth, dropped the
ball right at the feet of Tom Brown, who lobbed it into the net.
Said Jefferies: ''We had enough seasoned professionals in the side to
recover from a blow like that, but what happened? They conceded another
goal a couple of minutes later and from being one up, we came in at
half-time a goal behind. You have to look at the experienced men in
front of the goalkeeper and ask questions.''
It was Colin McKee who grabbed Kilmarnock's second, and the former
Manchester United player added a third after 63 minutes to put the match
beyond the reach of Hearts. Kilmarnock certainly didn't look like giving
anything away after that and there was no way back for Hearts.
Jefferies explained his reasons for fielding O'Connor in goal -- apart
from his one mistake, the youngster made a very impressive debut and
will do well -- when he said: ''Craig Nelson hasn't done well since he
took over from Henry Smith and we can't keep going back to Henry, who is
now 39. He has done a tremendous job for this club, but we have a young
keeper who was farmed out to Berwick and did well there. You can't wait
until there are six games left to give him his chance.
''I know what the problems are at Hearts and the quick remedy would be
to go into the transfer market, but we don't have the money for that, so
we have got to do it within the club.''
Hearts did, however, add to their staff at the weekend when they
signed Oldham full back Neil Poynton for a nominal fee.
Kilmarnock will hope that Saturday's win will prove to be a
springboard to better things after a bleak start to the season, and they
did have a secret weapon in the shape of former Rangers manager Jock
Wallace in their corner. Jock flew from his home in Spain on Friday to
give support to Killie manager Alex Totten.
Said Totten: ''Jock was my old gaffer when I was at Ibrox and he gave
me great encouragement before and after the match. He told me I was a
good manager and that I had to believe in myself. I'm afraid I can't
repeat the other things he said to me. As you know, Jock calls a spade a
shovel. Maybe I should ask him to fly over every Friday.''

Celtic 2, Partick Thistle 1
INEVITABLY, like all managers, Celtic's Tommy Burns suffers from
severe frustration. It is that kind of job and always will be, but, in
his case, there is the legacy of others' monumental frustration at many
years of failure which makes his task all the more difficult.
He revealed some of the annoyance within his breast after a narrow but
sound defeat of Thistle when he talked of the need for fans to try to
understand the route he is taking.
''I know how hard it has been for these fans for years coming to see a
club they love dearly -- we all love dearly -- going down the way. But
we have managed to win something and we are trying to change things
around, bringing in young players and playing in a manner that is right
for Celtic.
''I am sure they know that nobody thinks more about the team than I
do, in the middle of the night, first thing in the morning, and last
thing at night. We are all passionate about the club but we have to
build the team and I believe the best way to do that is to bring through
young players as well as call in others.''
He pointed out that the team's youngsters (there were four under the
age of 21 in the side that started) have shown that they have a lot to
offer. ''I wouldn't patronise our fans -- they are the best in the world
to play in front of -- but I hope they will see that we are trying to
get the club playing in a certain manner.''
Burns is not the first man to discover that building a team is a great
deal more complicated than building a new stand but the signs are that
he is getting there, albeit gradually, particularly with the
establishment of players like Pierre van Hooydonk and Andreas Thom, as
well as the promise of players like Jackie McNamara, Simon Donnelly,
Brian McLaughlin, and Jamie McQuilken.
One man not mentioned there, of course, was John Collins, about whose
impending transfer more has been written than his on-field exploits. For
me, he ought not to be allowed to leave Scotland, never mind Celtic.
There are very few players in this country who can match his inherent
skill, the intelligence of his play, or dead-ball expertise.
Collins scarcely ever gives the ball away, passes accurately, and
shoots with venom. Alongside him, the new boys at Parkhead are learning
good habits and whoever is bought in his place, if that is what is to
happen, will have a hard act to follow.
Van Hooydonk, who recognised Collins' talents from the day he first
played in the team, put it rationally, if diplomatically: ''John is a
good player and we know what he can do. We don't know what anyone who
comes in will do.''
It seems to me that Burns, a midfield talent of some class himself
and, therefore, well aware of the Collins contribution, would do himself
and Celtic a favour by calling the man in, sorting it all out, and
starting from scratch with John on his side.
Collins scored one of his specialities, a free-kick goal from just
outside the penalty area, which secured the points for Celtic, as
Thistle snatched a goal of their own in the last minute. It was no more
than the home side team deserved after having dominated almost the
entire 90 minutes, even if Thistle's Rod McDonald missed the easiest two
chances of the afternoon, both in the first half before Celtic had
scored.
Some of the Parkhead fans voiced their disapproval of the blank
scoreline at half-time and certainly the lack of direct penetration was
disappointing for them. Both van Hooydonk and Thom, who is a player of
all-round talent, did some excellent things but not often enough in the
penalty box, where most damage can be done.
However, excessive criticism would be unjust, as the team played some
splendid football and were faced with a superbly organised, if
ultra-defensive, Firhill side. Incidentally, defensive or not, the Jags
worked tremendously hard for each other and will play a lot worse and
win this season.
McNamara and McQuilken provided Celtic with enthusiastic, enterprising
full backs, who, given the time needed to mature, could become fixtures
in the side, while Donnelly had his best game of the season.
So well did Thistle stick to their discipline in the first half, they
hardly allowed Celtic a look at goal, other than the odd, long-distance
effort from Collins, although Thom did have a couple of snap chances and
Donnelly went near with a left-foot bending effort.
Van Hooydonk, who has no doubts at all that the team is better now
than last season, pointed out that the gap between Cetlic and Rangers is
not even a victory, two points. ''When I came here last January it was
the distance between here and Dover. Now, we are close and playing the
kind of football I prefer, not the long ball which was the way when I
came at first.''
He scored the opening goal with a fierce shot after Donnelly had made
the opening with a superb pass and, when Collins smacked in the second,
there was no way back for Thistle, even if Tom Smith collected a
consolation goal with a free kick of his own which was deflected off
Collins past Gordon Marshall.
With Paul McStay, Phil O'Donnell, Tosh McKinlay, and Brian O'Neil all
still to return, there is healthy competition in the squad but still two
or three players short of the level Burns seeks.

GERMAN MASTERS
ANDERS Forsbrand held on to win the Mercedes German Masters in Berlin
yesterday despite a gallant effort by Russell Claydon, who twice shared
the lead with the Swede in the closing stages.
Claydon, who began the last round six behind Forsbrand, birdied six of
his first 10 holes to draw level but fell behind when he bogeyed the
eleventh and caught his rival again with a birdie at the twelfth. But
Forsbrand drew away again to finish in 69 to win his sixth European Tour
title with a four-round aggregate of 264, 24 under par.
Bernhard Langer, winner of the European Open in Dublin last Sunday,
also passed Claydon in the final holes to finish in 66 for second place
on 266, with the burly Englishman, round in 67, third on 268.
Langer, who had started the day five off the pace, could never really
get to grips with Forsbrand, but his great effort now gives him a
sporting chance of finishing the year as European No.1. The German
superstar won #72,210 and is now only #60,307 behind Sam Torrance, who
won #4810 for joint thirty-third place.
Torrance now leads the order of merit by just under #4000 from Colin
Montgomerie, with Langer in third and only the Volvo Masters in
Valderrama later this month to come.
The Scot, who shot 68 for 277, has set his heart on finishing in the
European top spot for the first time in a 24-year professional career
and says confidently: ''Well, I'm in pole position. Monty and Bernhard
have got to catch me so the pressure will be all on them in
Valderrama.''
Claydon also had his own personal triumph, despite his third place. He
won #40,690 and it took him from sixty-fifth to thirty-ninth in the
order of merit and gave him a guaranteed place at Valderrama, an event
limited to 56 players.
''I thought I had a chance of winning when I caught Anders at the
tenth hole,'' said Claydon. ''But I missed two short putts at the
sixteenth and seventeenth and those are the ones you have to take if you
are going to win a tournament.''
Forsbrand's score of 264 was the lowest total on the European Tour
this year, beating the 267 set by Germany's Alexander Cejka in the
Austrian Open in August.
Before he began his last round, Forsbrand tried to tape his driver
because his fingers were sweating but, when told it was illegal, he gave
up the idea.
Now Forsbrand, who is attached to the Valderrama Club, will play in
the Volvo Masters there this month, but his long-term plan is to make
the European Ryder Cup team that plays the United States there in 1997.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
264 -- A Forsbrand (Sweden) 64, 64, 67, 69 (#108,330).
266 -- B Langer (Germany) 67, 66, 67, 66 (#72,210).
268 -- R Claydon 66, 61, 74, 67 (#40,690).
269 -- P-U Johansson (Sweden) 64, 66, 71, 68; J Parnevik (Sweden) 68,
64, 70, 67 (#30,015 each).
271 -- P Eales 65, 69, 70, 67; J Haeggman (Sweden) 67, 67, 68, 69
(#21,125 each).

DINAMO Kiev yesterday broke their silence on the bribery scandal which
cost them their place in the Champions' League.
The Ukrainian champions were ejected after having been found guilty of
bribing the referee officiating at their tie against Panathinaikos.
However, Kiev claimed that there had been a conspiracy between the
Spanish referee Antonio Lopez Nito and UEFA to oust them from Europe.
Spokesman Olexli Semenlenko said the referee and his two linesmen had
insisted on shopping for mink coats and accessories immediately on their
arrival, but never offered to pay for the goods.
''When the referee was later shown the bill for #20,000 he was
shocked,'' said Semenlenko. ''He thought he would take them for free.
'Why would we need to buy the first match in the Champions' League? It
was against the weakest team in our group and nothing could be decided
that night.''
He said that Kiev were only allowed one minute to state their case
before being thrown out by UEFA.
''This is a political game being played by UEFA and we are the
victims,'' he added. ''They do not want poor clubs in their competition,
only the rich and famous ones from the West.''
* UWE Seeler's return to SV Hamburg has been less than triumphant.
Their legendary former player vacated the president's post within 24
hours of accepting it because of boardroom strife.
A group of fellow directors refused his order to resign. Instead
Seeler went, lamenting that Hamburg will never regain their former
glories.

QUALIFICATION for the next World Cup in France will be much more
difficult under the format now arranged by FIFA.
The draw, which will take place in the Louvre on December 12, will
ensure that 13 European teams along with the host nation are represented
in the Finals.
There will be nine qualifying groups comprising six with five teams,
and three of six.
The nine group winners will automatically go through along with the
country which finishes best of the runners-up.
The eight others will be drawn against each other in sudden-death
play-offs decided over 90 minutes, where the luck of the ballot box will
determine which nation has home advantage.
Seedings will be based on performances over the last three World Cup
finals along with results in next summer's European Championships.
FIFA are also confident their World Cup for clubs will become a
reality before the millennium. Talks will be held next month to shape
plans but it will be loosely based on the Champions' League.
Sepp Blatter, secretary general, said: ''The future of the game will
rest on competition between clubs from Europe, South America, Japan, and
Africa.
''We will adapt the international calendar to make this possible and
ensure games are played at the same time. We want these games to be seen
in the huts of Mali and in the mountains of Nepal through worldwide
television coverage.''
* UEFA have acted swiftly to clamp down on racial abuse following a
complaint from Ajax at the treatment received by their players in
Hungary in the last round of the Champions' League.
Their opponents, Ferencvaros, have been fined #40,000 for the
behaviour of their supporters, who taunted Ajax's black players
throughout.
The punishment satisfied the Dutch club, who had threatened a walkout
at half-time as a protest against racism.

NEWSVIEW: Moment of discovery to rival that of Tutankhamun.
LOUDON TEMPLE reflects on the discovery of a lost masterpiece crafted
as part of the only major European commission for Glasgow's most famous
son.
MUSEUM curators in Vienna made a remarkable discovery in their dusty
vaults when workmen uncovered a lost masterpiece made for Charles Rennie
Mackintosh's only major Continental commission -- the
turn-of-the-century music room for the extravagant home of avant garde
collector Fritz Waerndorfer.
The priceless Art Nouveau frieze, by Mackintosh's wife Margaret
Macdonald, had lain without being noticed in the cellar for over fifty
years.
It was only when contractors began preparation for a basement
renovation programme in Vienna's Museum of Applied Art, that the
astounding discovery was made.
Scholars of Mackintosh and his work have for decades believed that all
of the contents of the Waerndorfer music room had been lost forever.
Then, in 1990, a large wooden crate was found concealed behind a
partition wall and a large chest. When museum staff prised open the lid
they discovered the three long-lost panels, each measuring 60ins by
79ins, illustrating a scene from Maurice Maeterlinck's play The Seven
Princesses.
The discovery must have mirrored the magical moment in November 1922,
when Howard Carter first set eyes on the gleaming solid gold mask of
Tutankhamun.
Protected in its wooden casket from the harmful effects of the
atmosphere and daylight, the triptych, as good as new, presented a
stunning sight.
Mr Reinald Franz, the museum's resident expert on Mackintosh, is in no
doubt that the piece ranks alongside all the important works from the
Art Nouveau period.
Describing the find as ''incredible'' and the frieze as ''amazing'',
he estimates its value to be several hundred thousand pounds ''or
more''.
''As far as we can tell, it was brought to the museum during the
Second World War, as lots of pieces were, to be protected here. Whoever
was responsible must have feared that the slightest hint of its location
would have placed it in some peril,'' he said.
''We have correspondence between the lawyer who was handling the sale
of the house and its contents on behalf of Mrs Lily Waerndorfer in 1916.
She was looking for 30,000 Crowns for some of the artefacts, including
the panels, but the museum just could not afford it at that time,'' he
revealed.
The elaborate frieze, executed in classic Art Nouveau style, captures
the moment in The Seven Princesses when the central figure of the prince
cradles the dead princess in his arms, with two mourning figures on his
right and four to his left.
The exotic, almost fairytale scene, lavishly decorated with huge
sweeping swirls, was built up on a gesso-covered wooden base, on which
layer after layer of plaster was applied, then heavily decorated with
inlays of mother-of-pearl and semi-precious stones.
Following careful restoration, the fabulous tryptych can be seen again
in public for the first time since it was concealed in the darkened
chamber during the Nazi era.
The panels have been placed on permanent display in the museum and are
rated among the most important pieces held in its impressive collection.
''There is no doubt that it ranks alongside the very cream of the work
from the period.
It is of major worldwide importance and, in my opinion, is up there
with the very best of Gustav Klimt,'' added the enthusiastic Mr Franz.
''Quite apart from the fact that it is an extremely rare piece, it is
also in amazingly fine condition, due to the fact that it had lain
protected for half a century.''
Despite being preserved intact, restorers found the frieze was
criss-crossed with hairline surface cracks, and set about a year-long
programme of restoration work, before it could again go on display.
Exactly how the panels came to be hidden away is a mystery that may
never be solved. The crate containing them had no labels.
There is now no doubt that the frieze, one of the most important
pieces from the Glasgow school to have survived, was the dominant
feature of Mackintosh's impressive music room.
The find finally puts an end to the fierce debate which has raged over
the years between rival camps, some of whom believed it had never even
been installed.
Another entirely separate controversy centred on whether or not the
panels had been executed by Mackintosh or his wife.
That argument can finally be laid to rest, as the elaborate panels
carry Margaret Macdonald's signature and are dated 1906.
The fate of the other furnishings, including a peculiar
rectangular-shaped grand piano, still baffles the experts.
Mr Fritz Waerndorfer, the wealthy son of a prosperous family of Jewish
textile manufacturers, gave the Scottish architect the commission after
Mackintosh had submitted entries for Alexander Koch's design competition
in 1902.
An enthusiastic patron and collector of the avant-garde, he had
befriended Gustav Klimt and, over the years, amassed many of his
drawings as well as some of the artist's best-known early canvasses.
He also possessed numerous drawings, and around 150 letters, by the
English artist Aubrey Beardsley, including the famous ''last letter''
written ''in my death agony'', in which the artist pleaded with his
publisher Leonard Smithers to destroy all of his obscene drawings in the
hope that his immortal soul ''might be saved''.
Mr Waerndorfer suffered severe financial misfortunes and was declared
bunkrupt a few years after the impressive room was completed. He left
Vienna for exile in America in 1914, and his wife Lily tried without
success to sell the house and its furnishings separately.
The entire contents of the room -- including the panels -- were
offered to the Austrian Museum for Art and Industry in 1916, but the
museum declined the opportunity to acquire them.
Records show that the house and contents were subsequently purchased
that year by Wilhelm and Martha Freund. There is an unbelievable
anecdotal suggestion from the period that the Mackintosh furniture was
''chopped up by a little girl of dubious taste''.
It was believed that a Viennese Professor, Mr Eduard Wimmer, from the
School of Applied Arts, had saved the panels from destruction and that
they had later been exhibited at the city's Museum of Arts and Crafts,
but no documentary details survive to support this assertion.
In an essay written in 1981 by a leading authority, Mr Peter Vergo, on
the vexed subject of the missing Mackintosh artefects, he states:
''Despite continual rumours that this or that piece of furniture has
turned up at some sale or in some private collection, not a trace of its
furnishings or decorations has survived.''
He believed the music room was completely destroyed around 1916, and
added: ''We are dependent on verbal descriptions and on surviving
photographs for any idea of what the room was like. The photographs,
however, provide only a partial glimpse of the interior.
''As a result, there have been disagreements among scholars over the
precise details of some of the decoration. Particularly puzzling is the
question of the frieze, which must have run along the upper part of the
walls of the room.
''In the surviving photographs, probably taken in 1903 or 1904, the
spaces above the shallow cornice on each side of the room are bare, and
are clearly waiting for decorative panels of some kind to be inserted.''
In his 1968 catalogue for the Mackintosh Centenary Exhibition, Mr
Andrew McLaren Young doubted whether the panels were ever installed, but
Mr Vergo admits that, from descriptions by art critic Ludwig Hevesi, it
would seem they had finally been in place by 1909.
All those who appreciate Mackintosh and his work were convinced,
however, that the remarkable furnishings and fittings, including the
panels, had vanished, until the triptych was unearthed in the bowels of
the Viennese museum.
Mr Reinald Franz agrees the story has intrigued students for decades
and continues to fascinate those interested in the genius of Glasgow's
most famous son.
Sadly, it is unlikely that the panels will ever be seen outside
Vienna.
He explained: ''It would be almost impossible to transport the piece.
It is extremely delicate and I fear the risk of damage would be far too
great to contemplate such a thing.''
When Mrs Pamela Robertson, curator of the Mackintosh and Scottish
Collections at Glasgow's Hunterian Art Gallery, worked on mounting the
1983 exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of Margaret Macdonald's
death, she wished forlornly that somehow the panels might miraculously
turn up.
The frieze would certainly have given her a magnificent centrepiece.
But never in her wildest dreams did she imagine that they would
re-appear just seven years later, under such dramatic circumstances.
A leading European expert on Mackintosh and Macdonald, she describes
the frieze as the most ambitious and sophisticated piece of work she
created.
Speaking from her base at Glasgow University this week, Mrs Robertson
revealed that she had been given a sneak preview while it was lying
tucked away in the Viennese museum cellar.
''I was shown them by torchlight as they lay in the basement. It was
indeed like something from the Tutankhamun story. 'What do you see?' I
see wonderful things.
''It was just as if a veil was being drawn back -- hugely exciting --
as this is such an important piece of the Mackintosh jigsaw puzzle,''
she said.
''As one of the commentators on the Vienna scene said, the loss of the
music room was one of the greatest acts of vandalism in Mackintosh's
career.
''There has been so much intrigue about the subject, and all we were
left with was black and white photographs from this mecca for the
artistic avant-garde.
''It's like a miracle. There was an assumption that the work had not
survived.''
Glasgow museums chiefs had hoped to be able to bring the frieze to the
city next year, to coincide with the major Mackintosh retrospective
being staged in the McLellan Galleries.
The exhibition will tour the US after its Scottish run.
A spokeswoman said: ''We asked Vienna to loan us the panels, but sadly
this will not be possible. They are just too fragile and valuable.''

NEW ZEALAND, the land of the silver fern, is justly famous for its
rugby and the magnificence of its scenery. However, in the farming world
that country holds a particular fascination in that it is virtually the
only nation in the developed world to operate in a climate totally
devoid of subsidies.
It was in 1984 that, strangely enough, a Labour Government decided
that the economy could no longer stand the cost of paying subsidies to
farmers and that they would overnight have to stand on their own two
feet and rely on what the international market would give them for their
lamb, beef, dairy products and wool.
Disaster was predicted and it was claimed that 20% of the farmers were
likely to go out of business. In the event only around 3% went to the
wall and now much of New Zealand farming has never been in better
health.
There are few Scottish farmers who would willingly surrender the
support of the Common Agricultural Policy to take their chance in New
Zealand. However, that is precisely what Bill Hogg, who farms 900 acres
at Clackmae, near Earlston in the borders intends to do.
So, last Thursday in St Boswells Mart his cows came under the hammer
with 98 spring calvers selling to a top of #1480 and averaging #1052.
The autumn calvers averaged #942, giving a herd average of #1013 for 151
sold.
Early in the New Year Bill, his wife Janice and daughters Gemma
(4[1/2]) and Kirsty (18 months) will head for a new life on the other
side of the world.
It's a move which he has been thinking of for some years: ''It's a
challenge for us to try a different style of farming without subsidies,
and I honestly think there are more opportunities out there.'' He also
feels increasingly uneasy over the whole way in which farming systems in
the UK have been driven so that producers can make a decent living.
He said: ''We've built up a herd of 250 cows but we seem to have them
inside for six months of the year and have to buy in a lot of straw and
feed. I just think it's too artificial. It's not the way I want to farm
because I prefer to use the skills of stocksmanship and to rear cattle
in a more natural environment. I'm also very worried that so much of our
income is in the form of subsidies, but that's the way it is and we have
to take them while we can.''
A 250-acre property has already been purchased by the Hogg family in
the South Island, 50 miles west of Christchurch in the foothills of the
Southern Alps. Bill Hogg intends to concentrate on beef production and
will buy 250 Aberdeen-Angus cross cows which will be kept outside all
year round with only a little hay being fed in the winter months. It's
real grass country with a rainfall of 40ins and as in much of New
Zealand little fertiliser is required with a high proportion of clover
in the sward fixing atmospheric nitrogen.
The economics of beef production without subsidies are radically
different in New Zealand. There will be No Beef Special Premium and no
Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances, but in turn the capital cost of
establishing a herd is much less.
Cows with calves at foot can be purchased for around $NZ600 or #260
which is equivalent to about one quarter of what the Clackmae cows
should make when they are sold this week. Currently beef prices in New
Zealand are lower than they have been for some years but Bill Hogg has
done his calculations.
''It's a cycle, and I reckon this is the right time to move in. All
the signs point to an early upturn and the demand from the Pacific rim
is increasing.'' Currently beef producers in the South Island are being
paid just over #1 per killo carcass weight, while a 17-19 kg lamb is
worth almost #16.50.
The facts and figures of New Zealand farming make for interesting
reading and at once reveal that the popular conception of agriculture
being the most important industry in that country to be erroneous. The
statistics show that agriculture contributes 7.3% of the GDP, though
that is way ahead of the corresponding UK figure of under 2%. However,
the vast majority of produce is exported -- no less than #3.87bn in
1994. The pattern of trade is also trading markedly. Agricultural
exports to the UK have fallen from 8.8% of the total in 1984 to 6% last
year while those to China and Asia have doubled to over 20% during the
same time.
Moving to New Zealand is no leap in the dark for Bill Hogg who has
been out there no less than four times in recent years. ''I like the
country which is unbelievably beautiful and the people are very
friendly.'' It's also a country with loads of space with the population
of 3.6c million dispersed at the rate of just 12.8 people per square
kilometre compared to the UK's 236.3 on the same area.
He also knows which sector of the farming industry is doing best.
''It's boom time for the dairy industry with things never having been so
good. In the area where we will be farming 20 new producers are moving
into milk each year. They have no quotas and have to rely on the
international market for their profits.''
Milk is priced on a total solids basis and sold to Co-ops in which a
farmer must have shares before he can sell to that organisation. The
upturn in production must, reckons Bill Hogg, be envied by UK dairy
farmers whose numbers are shrinking fast. There are now more than two
million dairy cows in New Zealand while exports have risen in the last
three years from #1.04bn to #1.23bn and are set to go still higher.
The Hogg family appreciate that operating in the free market 250 acres
will not be enough to provide a living comparable to what they currently
enjoy in Scotland. They plan when the opportunity arises to double up to
500 acres.
However, as Bill Hogg said, that may not be too easy: ''Very little
land actually changes hands with the same families running the same
properties for generations, and then there are dairy farmers who are
snapping up every available a bit of bare land.
''At present land prices in New Zealand are high with the best acres
fetching up to #1000. Dairy farmers who buy at those levels are then
quite prepared to spend another #1000 per acre setting up new units or
expanding existing ones.
Currently the Hogg farm in New Zealand is about to be planted with
spring barley under a share cropping agreement, but when they arrive in
early February the entire farm will be put back to grass and the
stocking programme will commence.
Meanwhile Clackmae, which Hoggs have farmed for 200 years, will be
managed by Bill's father Billy who holds the distinctions of being the
first to export blackface sheep to France, the first to import Normandie
cattle from France into Scotland and of having sold for #49,000 in
Newton Stewart the most expensive Blackface Ram yet sold.
Like son, like father and there are plans to change the farming system
at Clackmae to a more relaxed operation. Only 70 suckler cows will be
run, including a herd of pedigree Charolais, but sheep numbers are being
pushed up to around 1500 ewes.
Innovation and enterprise are synonymous with the Hogg family over the
generations, not the least being Bill's late grandfather Will who was
instrumental in starting up the first suckled calf sales at St Boswells
back in the early 1920s.
He would certainly have encouraged his grandson to have followed his
intuition. He would also have approved of the quality of the suckler
herd offered for sale this week. All the cows have been bred on the
farm, are EBL accredited, BSE3 and Farm Assured.
Bill Hogg, not unnaturally, has mixed feelings about leaving Scotland
and the Borders in particular. He said: ''I shall miss it all and our
friends, but we shall be back on a regular basis.''
New Zealand will be a challenge and it's a certainty that many
Scottish farmers will be keen to find out how the Hoggs fare. The odds
are surely that they will prosper and be proud to do so in a financial
climate where farmers can stare the world full in the face and say --
it's all my own work.

BLACKBURN Rovers' #1.8m transfer target, Billy McKinlay, reported for
training with the Scotland squad at Hampden yesterday, his future still
undecided.
The one thing which is certain is that the Dundee United midfielder
will not now be joining Celtic, who had initially agreed terms with the
Tannadice club and had spoken to the player on Thursday.
After McKinlay rejected the Parkhead club's offer, manager Tommy Burns
pulled out of the race for his signature.
Yesterday McKinlay would not comment on his impending transfer.
However, it would be a major surprise if he did not return from Sweden
on Thursday, renew his talks with the English champions, and decide his
future is at Ewood Park.
He spent Saturday afternoon in talks with Blackburn manager Ray
Harford, and now the 26-year-old McKinlay, who has waited so long and so
patiently for this transfer, looks certain to end his Dundee United
career later this week.
The present uncertainty will not affect McKinlay's chances of playing
for Scotland against Sweden on Wednesday. When he named the squad for
the Stockholm match, Scotland manager Craig Brown indicated that
McKinlay was one of the players he felt he needed to start the match.
Yesterday he said: ''There is obviously some uncertainty about his
future, but I don't see it as the kind of situation which will divert
him from the game.''
In the meantime, Brown faced a lengthy list of call-offs as player
after player reported at Hampden, was examined by the SFA doctor, and
then left for home.
The men who dropped out were Rangers' Stuart McCall with a recurrence
of his troublesome knee injury, Celtic's Paul McStay with a foot injury,
and, of course, earlier another Ibrox man, Ally McCoist, had also been
ruled out.
The B team, who play tomorrow, lost Tosh McKinlay of Celtic and
Rangers' Steven Wright, while Chelsea's John Spencer was another early
call-off.
However, goalkeeper Andy Goram, who has a hip knock, will travel and
looks likely to play. There may be decisions today on both Scott Booth
and skipper Gary McAllister, who are also injured.
Brown had named players to cover this kind of contingency and
admitted: ''It was inevitable that we would have a lot of players out
when we had so many playing at the weekend.''
Aberdeen's Eoin Jess, originally named in the B squad, has now been
moved into the full international pool. He said: ''The timing could not
better for me. I have been out of the international scene since the
first qualifying game in Finland more than a year ago. I played for just
20 minutes then and that has been my lot in this European campaign.
''Some of that absence was my own fault. I just wasn't playing well
enough to be picked. I also had injuries. Now, though, I feel I am
starting to reach the standards I have set for myself.
''Now I have the chance to stake my claim for the matches in England.
It has been very frustrating, very annoying, having to sit at home and
watch the qualifying games.
''I have been playing in a midfield role this season and I'm enjoying
it, but it won't matter to me where Scotland want me to play. If they
want me to go back up front then I'll do it.''
* NICK Barmby heads a new England generation that faces graduation day
in Norway on Wednesday -- and the chance to emerge from Terry Venables'
toughest test as serious European Championship contenders.
Barmby, Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp, and Gary Neville are no
longer kids with their noses pressed to the window after last month's
impressive collective performance against Colombia.
Proof in Oslo that it was no fluke will propel them across the
threshold into next summer's all-important squad as the England coach
stops his research and starts production.
''We're not talking about the future any more,'' admits Venables,
whose team flies out today looking for more than just revenge against
Egil Olsen's Norse bogeymen.
''We now have to deal with teams and get results. Just because we've
got youngsters in doesn't mean I'm looking to the future. We're looking
at youngsters who are able to operate with the experienced players now.
It's a good mix.''
Realistically, Venables knows he could continue to tinker until
Christmas before arriving at a settled side, and he will never close his
mind to any exciting late developers.
But after wins only against the USA, Nigeria, and Japan in the nine
games since Norway left Wembley with a goalless draw 18 months ago, he
knows it is time to start generating belief in his side.
Paul Gascoigne is missing, and Matthew Le Tissier consigned to
oblivion in the same wasteful way as France now treat Eric Cantona. But
Venables believes England have already progressed beyond the old
faithfuls and 21-year-old Barmby was surely in his mind when he
promised: ''I don't think we will lack creative players -- we will have
talent in the team on Wednesday.''
Liverpool's Redknapp, supported by Newcastle's Robert Lee, looks set
for the Gazza-like role, roaming the length of the pitch, while Barmby
can have its width in Peter Beardsley's old role. The end product,
hopefully, will be more all-round invention than we have yet seen from
England.

THE inaugural Partnership in Livestock lamb carcass competition,
staged on Saturday at ABP, Scotland's Bathgate abattoir, attracted an
entry of 130 pairs from Scottish lamb producers.
Entries were invited from the lamb producer groups and individual
farmers who are involved in the Partnership in Livestock Scotland scheme
-- an agreement between producers, ABP Scotland and supermarket chain
Sainsbury's. Lamb from this scheme is sold on Sainsbury's meat counters
as their premium earning ''tenderlean'' range.
The supreme champion -- a pair of three-quarter Texel wethers -- came
from Highland Glen Lamb Group member Willie Stevenson of Ballingry Farm,
Lochgelly, Fife. The two carcasses weighed 20.0 and 20.5kg, both graded
E2.
The reserve supreme champion pair were from Girvan farmer Johnnie
Logan of Dalfask, a founder member of the Ayrshire Lamb Group. These two
lambs were described by Mr Logan as being ''almost pure Texel'', they
weighed in at 20.0 and 20.5kg and graded E3L and E2.
Meanwhile, a sound commercial trade devoid of any real high prices was
the principal feature of Saturday's sale of blackface rams at Kildean
Mart, Stirling. The 1271 shearlings averaged #371.65 -- up #64.38, while
the 494 ram lambs averaged #304.17 -- up #16.38. The top price came
early in the sale for a shearling from R M Adam and Son, Auldallan,
Forfar, which sold for #6500 to Sandy Smith, Haughton, Glenkindie.
Three shearlings made #4000 with the first coming from Neil McCall
Smith, Conanchan, Crieff, selling to John Carruthers, Siloans,
Otterburn, who also purchased one at the same price from William Dunlop,
Elmscleugh, Dunbar. Matthew Hamilton, Woolfords, West Calder, was the
final recipient of a #4000 bid when he sold to Jim McCurdy, Ballymena,
Northern Ireland.
Bert and Elizabeth Grant, Glendamph, Glenisla, sold first at #2600 to
Doldy Farms, Glenisla, and then #3500 to Tom Paterson, Craigneich,
Crieff, while to #3200 Michael Scott, Troloss, Elvanfoot, sold to J
Little, Letar, Callander.
Alex Murray, Lurgan, Aberfeldy, who last year set a new Stirling
record of #10,000, sold the best of his shearlings at #3000 to Colin
McArthur, Nunnerie, Elvanfoot, while at the same price Frank Bosomworth,
Glenhead, Glenisla, saw the best of his useful pen go for the same price
in a joint purchase by J Forbes, Clunebeg, Pitlochry, and J Ferguson,
Middleton of Kilrie, Alyth. The same price saw R E Wood and Son,
Kingledores, Biggar, sell to James Sharp, Longcroft, Lauder.
The lamb trade was headed at #4700 for one from Elsmcleugh which sold
to Tom Paterson for his Dunruchan flock at Crieff. Mr Paterson, selling
from Craigneich, received #3000 from Elizabeth Johnston, Chamberwells,
Glamis.
At #2500 Doldy sold to the Northern Ireland syndicate of Sandy and Tom
Adams, Andy Hunter and Jim McCurdy. Three lambs made #2000, first David
Ker, Craigdarroch, Sanquhar, to H McCulloch, Kilmichael, Rothesay, and
then J Wight and Sons, Midlock, Biggar, to Bert Mitchell, Killellan,
Dunoon, and finally Troloss to J and J MacPherson, Balliemeanoch,
Dalmally.

STRUGGLING French companies are keeping more British exporters waiting
for their money, according to a survey today.
The exporters are suffering fewer losses from unpaid bills as business
conditions in Europe improve, but are having to wait longer for their
money when dealing with French customers whose payment delays are up by
3%.
The quarterly survey, by NCM Credit Insurance, which insures firms
against bad debts, found that the proportion of UK companies suffering a
loss as a result of non-payment by EU buyers has improved to one in five
from one in four since July.

<HEADLINE>Battling against the paperwork. Agriculture Minister backs campaign to reduce endless form-filling 'which burdens our farmers'.</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>

<TEXT>
THE good news for farmers from the Scottish Office last week was that
war has been declared on the need form-filling in the agricultural
sector. It is all part of the blitz on unnecessary paperwork announced
by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth earlier this year.
Our own Agriculture Minister, the Earl of Lindsay, had adopted the
idea with enthusiasm -- being a farmer himself and keenly aware of what
he describes as the ''endless flow of official paperwork which burdens
our farmers''.
Much of the form-filling, he accepts, is necessary to protect human
and animal health -- and to safeguard taxpayers' money -- but he still
sees scope for making cuts in paperwork.
The sentiments are commendable but it will be interesting to see how
it all works out in practice. The trend sometimes seems to be in the
opposite direction.
Cattle now have to be accompanied to the mart with their own personal
curriculum vitae and the move is on to impose stricter identification of
individual sheep as part of the anti-fraud measures which are aimed at
ensuring nobody gets paid sheep annual premium twice for the same
animal.
Nevertheless the hunt is on under the title of the ABC project -- ABC
standing for Agricultural Bumph Cutting, which just goes to show that
our Scottish Office chaps are not at all as prissy as they are sometimes
portrayed.
A taskforce has been set up to review the need for existing forms and
to report directly to the minister on what can be done away with. The
first target area will be the main Common Agricultural Policy schemes.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland and the Scottish Agricultural
College have both been invited to nominate members for the taskforce and
are reported to have responded with enthusiasm.
I would suggest that the remit of the taskforce might be extended to
considering the excessive use of acronyms which seems to beset the
farming world. We have all learned to recognise things like STUC and CAP
but organisations which operate in an agricultural context seem to take
a delight in ditching their names in favour of initials.
I know I am not alone in being puzzled at times by some of this
initialisation. Muir Russell, secretary of the Scottish Office
Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department once confessed that
shortly after taking office he was reading through one document in which
he marked 14 acronymns which he did not recognise. Any thoughts of
issuing a blistering memo about the need for clarity receded when he
came to the final page. A glossary had been provided.
The problem is exacerbated when an organisation's name is changed. At
one time we had DAFS (Department of Agricultural and Fisheries,
Scotland); then we had SOAFD (Scottish Office Agricultre and Fisheries
Department); now environment comes under that particular ministerial
umbrella and we have, SOAEFD. Little wonder that a delegate at the
Scottish Fish Farming Conference at Aviemore suggested it would be
simpler to refer to '' the department formerly known as DAFS''.
I must accept that acronyms do serve a purpose. It would be tiresome
to have to refer always to Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances rather
than the shorthand form HLCA's but there is a case for the journalistic
practice of using the name full out the first time it is mentioned
adopting the shortened form thereafter.
The difficulty comes when companies or organisations register
themselves in an initialised form and decline to give a clue as to what
the initials once stood for. When asked they are most reluctant to
deviate from the new shortened form of corporate identity.
I have on my desk an informative magazine The Agronomist, from BASF --
whoever they may be. I know they are a big name. I know they must have
money and clout to produce such a magazine but they only want to be
known as BASF plc.
A quick flip through the last few days' mail shows communications from
BOCM, which I understand used to be British Oil Cake Mills; UKASTA (who
get bonus points for providing a translation at the foot of the page
which identifies them as the United Kingdom Agricultural Supply Trade
Association); AEA (Agricultural Engineers Association); the TMR centre
which is obviously into agricultural equipment and talks of CAD
designers; LIST (Livestock Industry Support Trust) and FAF (Farming and
Agricultural Finance Ltd).
The acronym may be here to stay but it has been adopted with such
enthusiam by the agriculture and ancillary industries that it has ceased
to be snappy and is more likely to be puzzling.
Companies which really want to stand out in the crowd should consider
going back to calling themselves something really original -- like John
Smith Feedstuffs Ltd.
Meanwhile I am off on holiday for two weeks, so TTFN as they used to
say on ITMA.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke faces a stark choice between cheering voters
with either tax cuts or shaving interest rates -- but not both, a team
of economists said today.
In their latest forecast, the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club, which use the
same computer model of the economy as the Treasury, said the recent
slowdown in growth meant there was more economic justification for a
base rate cut than for tax reductions.
A #4000m tax reduction -- equivalent to 2p off the basic rate of
income tax -- was likely to mean that public borrowing, which has been
forced up in recent months by sluggish revenue growth, would rise in
1996/7 when the Treasury is projecting a fall, threatening to invoke the
ire of financial markets.

THE UK has hung on to fifth spot in the top ten European tourism
destinations in 1994, according to statistics from consultants Touche
Ross. But Hungary has now moved into fourth place on the list and two
more former Eastern Bloc countries -- Poland and the Czech Republic --
have now pushed Germany and Switzerland down the table and are fast
gaining on the UK.
France and Spain held onto the first and second slots. While the UK
saw a 1.11% annual rise in the number of overseas tourist arrivals in
1994 - which totalled 19.7 million - Hungary had a 6.50% increase,
Poland was up 3.50% and the Czech Republic enjoyed a huge 47.83% rise.

THE number of companies floating on the stock market has plummeted
from levels enjoyed last year, despite the FTSE 100 index remaining
buoyant, a report claimed today. A pick-up in the number of public
listings is unlikely before the early part of next year and even then
levels are unlikely to match those of 1993 and 1994.
During the first nine months of the year there were 61 flotations
raising #1800m compared with 177 new issues raising #77000m for the
corresponding period in 1994, according to accountancy and management
consultancy firm KPMG.
The summer quarter is traditionally a quiet time for companies
beginning life on the stock market, but this year there were just 18 new
issues which raised #400m a sharp drop from the same quarter last year
when there were 44 flotations raising #1400m.

A BATTLE seems almost certain to begin this morning on the foreign
exchanges between the Bank of France, and other central banks, and
currency speculators trying to push the French franc lower against the
German mark.
The crucial factor is the extent to which the markets will heed the
warnings from the Group of Seven Finance Ministers meeting in Washington
over the weekend where Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said they were ready to
take concerted action if necessary.
Last week, market operators managed to weaken the franc by more than
five centimes against the mark, although it closed above the worst on
Friday at 3.0573 against the German currency. The slight recovery was
after the central bank effectively moved short-term interest rates to
make borrowing more expensive for those wanting to sell the currency
short.
That was seen as the French authorities being prepared to fight back
at a time when the currency has been attack on almost all sides.
The pressure came from the expectation that the French government
would not be able to meet the target of lowering its 1997 budget deficit
to 3% of gross domestic product in preparation for the introduction of a
single currency in 1999.
Finance minister Jean Arthuis said in Washington on Saturday that the
goal had been tightened further by trying to reduce the deficit to below
3% to ensure there were no mishaps in public finances which might
prevent France from qualifying for the monetary union criteria targets
demanded by Germany.
Under the Maastricht Treaty, budget deficts must be reduced to 3% of
GDP or below before a country can qualify for European Monetary Union.
However the franc fort policy has been undermined on the political
front by personal scandals surrounding Prime Minister Alain Juppe and
also his repeated warnings that French finances were ''in national
peril''.
With a proven record of low inflation stretching back a decade or so,
France can be considered in the first division of European economies
with Germany and the Netherlands.
But it now faces the distinct possibility of being relegated to the
second division by financial markets.
President Chirac faces several problems with the economy which the
markets concerned about how he will meet his election pledges without
threatening the country's enviable inflation record.
This concern was heightened by the resignation of Alain Madelin as
Finance Minister. He called for a radical reduction in public spending
along UK lines, which is just the sort of thing the markets like to
hear.
The one key pledge from which much else flows was a reduction in
France's stubbornly high unemployment rate, which at 11.5% is one of
Europe's highest, and it is clear this attracted many votes in the
presidential election.
Rather than attack the supply side through freeing up labour markets,
which appears to have reduced UK unemployment -- though whether this
will be a lasting improvement remains to be seen -- France is aiming to
raise demand in the economy.
During his campaign Mr Chirac even suggested that wages should rise
faster and the imminent 1996 budget will contain measures to encourage
people to spend more and save less.
The problem with raising wages is that it is incompatible with cutting
the budget deficit from its present high level of 5% of GDP because of
the large public sector wage bill.
Historically the state has been a very important part of the French
culture and remains so. France may have a government on the right but
there is no chance of an Anglo-Saxon right wing agenda of cutting back
the state's influence being followed, though there is a privatisation
programme.
With some five million direct employees plus those in nationalised
industries, 40% of public spending represents pay and the unions are
agitating for more, emboldened by the departure of Mr Madelin who had
dared to suggest that the public sector was too pampered.
Already tax on fuel has been increased so that the public sector
deficit does not breach the target of FF290bn and a high wage agreement
would push the total higher. Industrial action is threatened for
tomorrow by civil servants though there is not likely to be much popular
support for it.
However, there are no holds barred when it comes to industrial action
in France and the authorities have traditionally been afraid of the mob,
despite their fearsome riot police, and tend to cave in. Before this
point is reached a compromise is likely to have been effected, given
that Mr Juppe is committed to consensus. The unions may agree to
restraint next year in exchange for bigger rises in 1997.
The assumption here is that by then the economy will be growing,
thereby swelling the tax take and enabling such rises to be funded
within a declining borrowing requirement. This has a familiar ring to it
but looking at current trends is unlikely to be fulfilled.
That is what the currency battle will be about.

<HEADLINE>GEC searching for Weinstock successor</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>18</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>975978682</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SEARCH is under way by GEC to find a successor to Lord Weinstock,
who is to step down next year after 33 years at the helm of the
electronics and defence giant, it was confirmed yesterday.
Chairman Lord Prior said an announcement about a new chief executive
would be made in the next six months.
Lord Weinstock, 71, has been managing director since 1963, but that
title will disappear when he leaves.
GEC's share price, which has languished during recent months, rocketed
last week to close on Friday at 339[1/2]p -- its highest level for more
than 18 months -- amid speculation a successor was being planned.
Institutional discontent has been increasing over the last two or
three years with the shares underperforming the market and so pressure
has grown for Lord Weinstock to stand down to make way for someone who
could exploit its very considerable assets more effectively.
Lord Prior's comments to a newspaper are the first confirmation on how
the group is managing the task of finding a replacement for the man who
has dominated GEC for more than three decades and who has built the
company into the #9300m giant it is today with a cash mountain of about
#2000m.
When he was appointed MD in 1963, GEC was a struggling electrical
company with profits of #4m on sales of #135m. Analysts reckon latest
annual profits to the end of March will reach a record #980m.
Lord Prior dismissed reports that the selection process was running
into trouble and that the board was divided.
''There has been no dissension in the boardroom. It is part of my job
to ensure that all the views of directors are considered,'' he said.
Internal and external candidates were being considered, although
several major institutional investors are understood to be keen to seen
an outsider appointed. A shortlist was in the process of being
completed.
It is widely believed that Lord Weinstock's 43-year-old son, Simon,
who is also a board director, will not be included in the running for
his father's post.
Lord Weinstock has been one of the most successful industrial leaders
of post-War Britain, having built a giant manufacturing empire in 33
years which has seen GEC's profits rocket from #4m to an expected #980m.
As one of the central pillars of the UK's industrial base, Lord
Weinstock, 71, has systematically developed the business into the 18th
biggest company in Britain with a stock market value of #9300m and cash
resources of about #2000m.
He joined what was to become GEC in 1954 at the invitation of his
father-in-law after getting a degree in statistics and working as a
civil servant.
The company was then called Radio &amp; Allied Industry and became GEC in
1960 following a takeover. In 1967 GEC swallowed Associated Electrical
Industries and followed that with English Electric a year later in what
was then the biggest merger in Britain.
Lord Weinstock successfully launched a takeover bid for Plessey in
partnership with Germany's Siemens in 1989 and started joint ventures
with Alsthom of France and General Electric of the United States.
Talk of a takeover bid for British Aerospace has not materialised,
although he retires next year with the satisfaction of having outgunned
BAe for Trident submarine VSEL earlier this year with a knock-out #800m
offer.
As a defence supplier, GEC's relations with government are of paramout
importance and it is Lord Weinstock's dexterity in this area which will
also make it such a hard act for his successor to follow.

Castles and distilleries cross Gary Buchanan's path as he journeys in
the North-east of Scotland.
AT a time when English lords were relaxing in their stately piles and
considering calling in Capability Brown to landscape their gardens, the
Scots were stirring things up with lairds, great and small, looking to
their old strongholds and undertaking extensions and refurbishments.
Stuart rebellion and the Gothic revival supplied powerful atmospheric
support.
Today, Scotland has an almost indecent supply of imposing castles --
nowhere more so than in the north-east, in Gordon particularly. Each
edifice is unique, the settings are spectacular and for visitors, the
experiences remain memorable.
Sadly the A96 between Inverness and Aberdeen and the A95 along the
Spey Valley seem to be overlooked when we opt to turn a dreich weekend
-- with nowhere to go and nothing to do -- into a brief sojourn around
this land of ours, so rich in myth and legend.
From Loch Ness eastwards to Royal Deeside this scenically stunning
corner of Scotland oozes with romantic castles that have a story to
tell, interesting ruins that bear testimony to a troubled past and
breathtaking vistas that reassure even the most dubious traveller.
Fortified country homes and fortified barley bree are the trademarks
of this region of castles and stills. These remote mountains and glens
of old Caledonia have been emphatically put on the map by astute tourism
folk with the creation of the Castle Trail and the Malt Whisky Trail.
''Now y'know why the Malt Whisky Trail's s'close,'' says a chattie
quine from Craigellachie -- referring to the concentration of
distilleries on the banks of the silvery Spey -- ''Efter y'trapse around
they stoorie castles, y'need a bit o'help t'put a spring back in yer
step.''
Whether the good lady from the epicentre of the Malt Whisky Trail has
actually visited all seven castles and three great houses in the Castle
Trail will never be known -- ancient they may be, but stoorie they most
certainly are not. They are an eclectic collection of Scotland's finest
-- one moment you are in Norman Scotland, the next, Renaissance
Scotland. Here you can let your imagination run riot in dark romantic
ruins or in magnificently furnished country piles.
Charming and picturesque, absorbing and fascinating they are, but none
rivals the ruined Kildrummy Castle as a mighty fortress, built in an age
when great baronial castles were at the epitome of their prestige.
It cannot be said with certainty who built the castle or when, but an
Earl of Mar and a date in the second quarter of the thirteenth century
seem the most likely. By the time Edward I visited these parts in the
summer of 1296, almost 700 years ago -- the first time Kildrummy appears
in recorded history -- the castle was certainly in the possession of
Donald, Earl of Mar and building work largely completed.
In its finished state, the castle consisted of a large courtyard,
massively defended by high stone walls called curtains, punctured at
intervals by lofty towers, two of which formed the well-protected
gatehouse. Within the enclosure itself, the earl's great hall, chamber
and chapel dominated.
By the time of Edward's return visit in the autumn of 1303, Kildrummy
had truly become the ''noblest of northern castles'' and was among the
foremost aristocratic residences in all Scotland. The castle was
abandoned after the first Jacobite uprising in 1715 and all that remains
today are the well-preserved ruins that offer a real insight into this
massive medieval fortress.
Ten miles south-west, half lost among the brown Donside hills,
Corgarff Castle is by no means a romantic ruin. Little more than a
rather stark white house set within a star-shaped wall, this restored
castle also has an eventful history of turbulent times.
Dating from 1537, it played a prominent part in the Jacobite Risings
of 1715 and 1745 and was converted into a barracks for Hanovarian troops
in 1748. Its last military use was to house the English Redcoats who had
the unpopular task of combating whisky smuggling -- a one-time
profitable hobby in some of the more remote glens. No doubt the sage of
Craigellachie would have her own views on that infamous practice.
Tolquhon and Huntly Castles are two ruins well worth visiting on this
sign-posted trail, while to the south of the River Don lies Castle
Fraser. One of the ''Castles of Mar'' dating from 1575, this sturdy
edifice is the grandest of Midmar Castles. The glory of this castle is
in its elevations, bare lower walls contrast with the flourish of
decorative detail at roof level. From the long drive the layout of this
Z-plan castle becomes apparent, while inside a wealth of historic
furnishings, paintings and fine embroidery are in evidence.
Craigievar -- another Castle of Mar -- is quite simply, the perfect
Scottish castle. The single tower house rises clean out of green lawns,
seven storeys high, its pink walls straight and uncluttered, crowned by
a profusion of turrets, high-pitched roofs, decorative stonework and
corbelling. Built between 1610 and 1624, in a period when castles were
no longer built for defence, Craigievar is the very essence of Scottish
baronial style and is one of Scotland's most compelling tower houses.
The five towers of Fyvie Castle enshrine five centuries of Scottish
history. The oldest part dates from the thirteenth century and is now
probably the grandest of Scottish baronial architecture. Apart from the
great wheelstair -- the finest in Scotland -- there is an exceptionally
important collection of Gainsborough portraits as well as 12 works by
Sir Henry Raeburn. The exquisite dining room is nowadays rented out for
corporate entertainment, guests can hob-nob among the Flemish
tapestries, Delft tiles, arms and armour.
Duff House, Haddo House and Leith Hall complete the 200-mile-long
Castle Trail which criss-crosses the River Don as it meanders through
moors marbled like chocolate cake that rise up to heather-clad hills,
bisected by pine-covered glens swatched in riverside birchwoods and
Scots pines, endorsing this region's sense of remoteness.
However, it is another remote river valley that plays a vital role in
the Malt Whisky Trail. The Gaelic translation of Spey is ''hawthorn
stream'' -- an anachronism for such a mighty river. The Spey is the very
reason for its valley's success, bringing it economic life as much as
the water of life through centuries past.
Scenic roads follow the Spey on either bank, the narrower but less
crowded B9102 travels the north bank while the main A95 follows the
south bank of the river from Craigellachie south to Aviemore, just over
the Morayshire border the Speyside Way follows the river for 48 miles to
the coast at Spey Bay.
The Malt Whisky Trail is a clearly signposted, 70-mile meander around
eight great distilleries. Starting at the trail's gateway of Keith,
close by the River Isla, you can visit the Strathisla Distillery. This,
one of Scotland's most beautiful and oldest distilleries, dates from
1785. Even before this there was a brewery on the site as early as the
thirteenth century operated by Dominican monks.
Travelling west you reach Glen Grant Distillery. Built in 1840 by
brothers James and John Grant -- proud descendants of generations of
illicit whisky distillers and smugglers -- they are depicted on the
label today. The spring water used for this whisky comes from the
Caperdonich well in the surrounding hillside.
Heading south you pass through Craigellachie, home to an imposing
cast-iron bridge designed by Thomas Telford and of course, a chattie
quine who knows how to put a spring back in your step.
Continue south and watch the production of the classic Spey malts of
Cardhu, Tamdhu, Glenfarclas, The Glenlivet and Tamnavulin before heading
north to end the Trail in the Glenfiddich Distillery at Dufftown. These
tours offer an audio-visual presentation outlineing the company's
history and how the brand has been developed. A sampling of the amber
nectar follows -- or a miniature for drivers following the esoteric
''pagoda'' roof signs of the Malt Whisky Trail through remote mountains
and glens.
To visit this north-east corner of Old Caledonia is to travel with a
purpose and fulfil an interest in self-enlightenment and amusement. This
region should not be the sole preserve of the tourist, for as Burns put
it so eloquently, ''From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur
springs, that makes her loved at home, revered abroad.''

ALL Hell has broken out on the land of my fathers. From the farm on
the little hill, the good people of Methlick can hear the gentle calling
of 40 mothers who have their 42 calves' suppers ready and want them home
-- at once. It is weaning time again.
We have taken them all in except the four in-calf heifers and the one
whose calf spent itself. We've wormed the calves and built the walls of
their jails high. The cows have not been wormed because they are going
out again onto pastures which after all those rains must be infested.
They aren't going out yet though. We don't have a fence on the place
that would keep them back from their calves. We tried it four years ago
and they just made a straight line for the steading through two of my
fences and the Breadwinner's vegetable garden and lawns.
There will be no such mistakes this year. The cows are penned and the
door is shut. It will stay that way until the old dears realise how nice
it is not to be bothered with their offspring and stop roaring. It will
take about five days.
And for those five days the good people of Methlick can expect little
sleep.
The Breadwinner and I will be all right, though. We're going to take
three days off for a run up to Gairloch.
It'll be nice to get away from the aftermath of the floods.
No-one's talking about anything else.
Mossie says it proves his new theory: ''More acres, less profit.''
It is an attempt to justify the fact that he sold a farm to the
Irishman. Say what you will, farmers don't like selling land. It is a
sad day when a farmer sells a farm. Even if the banker is breathing down
his neck, his wife has run away with the postie and is claiming half his
wealth and even if there is a (tax) rollover available, the last thing a
farmer will usually do is sell land.
And yet Mossie has sold a farm and lost a bit of ground he was
renting. As he says, he gets his fertilisers and sprays from the local
garden centre now. With only 700 acres left he feels it's hardly worth
bothering the big agricultural suppliers.
So he has adopted his new slogan. But it really isn't so daft.
There is no doubt the more acres you have when things are going well
the more money you make. It is also true that when things are really bad
like it's been for the late crops this year, the more acres the bigger
the loss.
But there is more to it than that. If you have a small acreage there
is more chance that you'll get your harvest in decent order in a bad
year. If you've only got a six-day harvest and there are six good days
you'll get away with it. If you have 1000 acres and perhaps a 20-day
harvest you will be struggling in a year like this. Furthermore your
crops are less likely to have been properly looked after than if you had
a smaller acreage.
And what about the potato Barons? I dare say I could have handled 30
acres if I'd won the lottery and could afford the equipment. But look at
the state Crookie's in. He's got hundreds of acres and the land is so
wet he can't get on it. There is no doubt it will be dry one day and it
is wonderful how potatoes will keep in the ground but Crookie can't even
get on the land to spray them for blight or to kill them off for their
protection. So he has hired every helicopter in the North East to hold
the line for him.
There are consolations in being a crofter of 250 acres.
Indeed the farmer's mind has turned to how he might profit from the
misfortunes of those who have been caught with too many acres or the
wrong crops.
When we had the calves weaned I looked proudly at Argus' last crop of
bull calves. There are just 22 of them and they're fairly rattling in
what was once my father's dairy byre. It held 40 cows and a bull then.
The stalls are away now and so is the bull's box. Surely I could manage
another 10 or even 20 calves for the winter?
And surely a few extra calves will be easy to buy if half the country
lost half their fodder in the drought and the other half lost half their
crop in the monsoon?
There is no sign of it yet. Cattle prices are the highest I've ever
seen them at this time of year.
Mossie says it's because so many big farmers have salvaged their wheat
as whole-crop that they now have to find something to eat it. Farmers
who long ago realised that cattle were for show and that grain was for
dough have forgotten themselves. Desperate for something to eat all that
remains of their harvest they are buying cattle ''to lose a heap more
money''
He could be right.
And it may just be that it will be into the new year before the
farmers of the North-east fully realise what this harvest has done to
their balance sheets. All right, they're feeling a bit better now that
the salvage is complete. But by February they'll know just how small
their cheques were for that huge heap of mouldy wheat in the close. And
they'll have the accounts in as well.
There just might be a blip in the cattle prices then.
I'll be ready -- and to be sure about that I've bought some more wheat
straw off big Hamish.
''But Hamish it'll be wet,'' says I during the negotiations.
''Oh aye,'' says Hamish, never the best of salesmen. ''But it's nae
muck weet.''

<HEADLINE>Consortium to develop Caspian Sea oil fields</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Baku,
A CONSORTIUM of oil giants helping to develop Azerbaijan's offshore
Caspian Sea fields is expected to announce tomorrow that it will use two
pipelines to export the oil to Western markets.
''There will be two pipelines and it will be announced on Monday'',
Vafa Gulizade, chief aide to Azeri President Haydar Aliyev said.
In what would be a triumph for Moscow, the consortium is expected to
ship most of its early output -- so called ''early oil'' -- through an
existing Russian pipeline to the Russian port of Novorossiisk, officials
said.
However, the route would be complemented by a second pipeline through
the former Soviet republic of Georgia which could eventually run into
Turkey, allowing it to handle the bulk of the oil when production gets
into full swing.
Russia and Turkey have been engaged in a tug-of-war to win the
pipeline route.
The consortium -- the Azerbaijan International Operating Company --
includes British Petroleum, Pennzoil, Russia's Lukoil, Unocal, Turkish
Petroleum, Norway's Statoil, Mcdermott International and Exxon, who are
working with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR).
The Western companies are footing 90% of the $8bn investment in the
project. SOCAR has a 10% stake. Profits will be split roughly equally
between the consortium and Azerbaijan.
Initial production will start at about 75,000 barrels per day in early
1997 and is expected to rise to 700,000 barrels per day. Reserves are
believed to be sufficient to last 30 years.
Both the Russian and Georgian routes will use existing facilities
which will need upgrading. A separate, new pipeline would have to be
built from the Georgian city of Poti to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on
the Mediterranean.
Eventually additional pipelines would need to be added either along
those two routes or in a new direction.
The consortium says it is weighing only economic criteria in deciding
which way the oil should flow.
But oil analysts say the pipeline route decision has turned into a
symbol of the battle between Russia on one hand and Turkey and Western
countries on the other for economic and political leverage in the
region.
''The reality is that the pipeline decision has been based largely on
political factors, no matter what the consortium says'', a Western
diplomat said.
Moscow has threatened to challenge Baku's unilateral exploitation of
its shore of the Caspian and has virtually cut off trade with it by in
effect shutting the only land border between the two countries.
Azeri officials also say Russia is deliberately hampering the peace
process in the seven-year-old war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh to force its will on Baku.
Turkey has embarked on a blitzkrieg campaign to get consortium members
to route a pipeline through Georgia and its territory and has openly
frowned on the Russian option.

A BUSINESS initiative set at the heart of Europe will be launched this
week. It involves a unique gathering of corporate, trade union, and
local authority representatives.
The Flanders Scotland Foundation aims to strengthen business and
financial ties between the two historically-linked regions.
Already meetings have been staged between corporate heavyweights like
Sir Iain Noble and Mr Grant Baird, executive director of Scottish
Financial Enterprise, and Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the
Scottish TUC.
A Belgian Cabinet representative will attend an Edinburgh City
Chambers reception on Thursday. Mr Christie will also attend, along with
representatives from the local council and business and commerce.

<HEADLINE>ScottishPower takeover of Manweb. Wiring into that great feeling of being in control</HEADLINE>

''I FEEL good,'' said a remarkably relaxed Ian Robinson on Saturday
morning, less than 24 hours after ScottishPower had gained control of
the Manweb electricity distribution company in a slighly more nail
biting finish than had seemed likely.
Certainly, he bore little sign of fatigue for a chief executive who
for the last ten weeks had been at the centre of the most hostile
successful takeover of privatised utility to date.
However, unlike some colleagues and advisors, he did leave the Friday
evening celebrations early at 8pm to return to his home which he has
owned for several years in a secluded part of North-west London.
He had intended attending the World International Energy Conference in
Japan but he had ''some pretty important'' meetings with the vanquished
Manweb executive. However, he hopes to depart today for Tokyo.
The house is clearly very important to him and and will continue to be
extensively used, partly by his two children at university, despite
having moved out of rented accommodation in Glasgow to a bought house in
Bearsden.
It will be used as a base for the increasing proportion of his time
that must be spent with politicians, regulators, and other energy
company executives in an industry which is undergoing a revolution as
rapid and intense as that in communications.
Time is something he values and he tries to get an hour a day to
think. That can be difficult with such a punishing work schedule.
Born near Newcastle in 1942, the son of a station master, he lived for
21 years in a railway station and always wanted to be an engineer.
Only half jokingly, he says it was the sound and sight of steam
engines that sent him in that direction. Educated at Middlesborough High
School, he was good at chemistry and so decided to beome a chemical
engineer.
His academic record at Leeds University was the springboard for ascent
through the ranks of some of the world's best and largest engineering
companies.
Mr Robinson has few doubts about his own abilities and takes
demonstrable pride in his track reord to date.
''I deliver the product at the end of the day,'' he said.
Pressed only a little, he added: ''I believe I am a good leader and
communicator. At the end of the day, success is what matters.''
He said that people like working for him. Leadership is about example,
communication, and selection of people.
Perhaps, the communications skills were partly forced upon him. He
admits he is lucky in that his hair turned prematurely grey at the age
of 28, as did that of his father. That gave him an appearance of
seniority and maturity which undoubtedly helped his advance. By the time
the task was successfully completed, the age factor was irrelevant.
The first overseas trip was to the Copperbelt in then Northern
Rhodesia with Roan Selection Trust. He next joined Kellogg, one of the
world's biggest engineering consultants, where he was the first Britsh
graduate ever to work in its New York Office.
At Fort Dodge he was the first Englishman most had ever seen and so he
became a social gain. ''We like to hear you talk,'' he was told.
He worked in Belgium for 12 hours a day for several months which for a
newly married man was not much fun, then in Australia, and then a dozen
years with American engineers Parsons before moving to John Brown.
Although he had been involved in several takeovers at Trafalgar House,
where he became chief executive of the John Brown engineering subsidary
in 1988 and built it up into being the finest engineering company in the
world by the time he left, the Manweb acquisition is in a totally
different league.
The ability of some 200 people in about 10 different companies to keep
secret such a price sensitive transaction in its preparation stage and
for so long is something which still amazes him and is a tribute to the
professionalism of his advisers and the 40 or 50 people at ScottishPower
who were involved in the takeover at various stages.
The most exhausting part was the preparation for launching the
takeover by putting the team of advisers into place and ensuring the
financial resources were lined up. That meant doing all the normal
activities such as turning up at routine meetings while secretly having
an increasing volume of additional work sifting through the Manweb data
-- that target was arrived at through a process of elimination.
The takeover was a roller coaster of emotions. Undoubtedly the
greatest moment was last Friday morning between 11.15am and 11.45am when
an avalanche of acceptances poured in to give ScottishPower control.
One benefit for the future is that the members of the ScottishPower
team understand each other better and seem certain to be able to combine
to even greater effect in the future.
A self-confessed workaholic, Mr Robinson seems scarcely to have begun
at ScottishPower -- he has been there only since March when he was
headhunted from Trafalgar House where he decided that when the Jardine
Matheson interests assumed effective control he would not become its
chief executive.
He took a little persuading but is happy with the bit between his
teeth.
ScottishPower is now benchmarked against other high performers such as
British Airways and Federal Express in its efficiency and customer care.
Plans for the future include increasing the amount of coal being taken
from Scottish Coal at Longannett and Cockenzie, which will be good for
Scotland as more energy is sold into England through the enlarged
interconnector.
Mr Robinson also plans further diversification in telecommunications,
while looking to become a world player in the energy markets
He relaxes less frequently than he would like. Golf is the hobby, but
as he said over the weekend, he is now hitting the ball 20 yards further
than ever before -- a good omen for ScottishPower.

TONY Rush is adept at rescuing companys which are in difficulty but he
prefers to describe himself as a paramedic rather than a company doctor.
The difference, he says, is that a paramedic brings a
multi-disciplined approach while the doctor is likely to concentrate on
a particular ailment.
His recent experience with the troubled construction division of
Shanks &amp; McEwan illustrates his success.
He was asked to put right the problems of the division and to
determine an exit for the parent company.
''It was a three year strategy,'' said Mr Rush, ''and we completed it
in 20 months.''
The chairman's statement in the recent Shanks &amp; McEwan annual report
says: ''Mr Rush was appointed to take charge of the construction
division as the extent of its losses began to unfold and he has carried
out his unenviable task with distinction. The group is very grateful to
him.''
After Mr Rush had successfully concluded negotiations with the
Scottish Office over outstanding claims concerning the division's M74
and A1 contracts, Shanks &amp; McEwan were able to sell the division to
Jarvis plc.
''I didn't do it on my own. There were a team of people involved, and
some of those people are still with me,'' said Mr Rush.
He added: ''The skill in being a manager is not the skill of doing
individual management but is the skill of being able to select people
who can do the right job.''
His company, Harris Rush Associates Ltd, is now solving new problems.
''We have six current clients, but I have to say that not all are in
trouble. We also offer companies a service whereby we will deal with
contractural problems they may have, and at present we are negotiating
on around #4m worth of claims on behalf of companies,'' he said.
The construction industry is in the doldrums, made worse by the
Government's reluctance to invest in a major public works programme, but
Mr Rush does not see the much vaunted Private Funded Initiative as the
answer.
Instead, Harris Rush Associates, which has offices in Glasgow and
London, is in discussions with another company to offer clients a
Guaranteed Maximum Price on site regeneration. Mr Rush believes this
could lead to the development of more projects on brown land.
''Our plan would remove the uncertainty and allow more developments to
take place,'' he said.

THE supermarket, they say, is now the modern church, drawing together
a congregation this time in the service of mammon. But in those days
before the church itself was less bereft of followers, the local post
office was also a gathering place of certain uplifting renewal.
There, in that secular communion of spirits, people not only dropped
off their mail, they dropped by for a chat. The missing pensioner would
be immediately detected, the incomer quizzed and noted. And from behind
that unpretentious counter, with its halting Biro and time-served
sponge, the custodian of stamps and bureaucratic forms would go about
his duties attentively as any cleric.
All changed with the soulless doctrine of new technology. But the
Government, seeking one more sector to privatise, underestimated the
vigour of public loyalty to the Post Office and last spring it was
forced to retreat from its sell-off policy. Even so, Post Office
Counters, like Royal Mail, had already undergone a radical
transformation which started in the early 1990s, and poised in the
vanguard of that ongoing revolution there is still the industry's first
woman general manager in Britain: Wendy Goldstraw, postmistress supremo
whose professional zip code covers the entire territory of Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
In her office at the top of the Athenaeum Building in Glasgow's Nelson
Mandela Place, Goldstraw keeps an industrial hard hat not far from her
desk. It's a jokey souvenir, she says, from one of those brainstorming
management conferences, but you suspect that it also hangs there as a
symbolic reminder, in the Age of Uncertainty, that everyone is in some
kind of firing line today.
Three years ago, when the profound restructuring began, Goldstraw was
district manager for Edinburgh, the Lothians, Borders, Dumfries, and
Galloway. ''I knew my job would disappear,'' she says, ''and for six
months I had no idea where I would end up. So I really do understand
people's worries about security.'' Today her charge covers 2850 post
offices and 4200 employees and carries a Scottish budget of #106m. All
of which makes her one of Scotland's key figures in business life.
As a graduate trainee Goldstraw joined the service 22 years ago, and
although she is loath to describe herself as a feminist she is clearly
among those women who know they are as capable as any first-class male
executive of energising British industry for the future. ''When you talk
to senior managers and directors these days they certainly say the right
words about advancing women's careers. But, if that's the case, I just
wonder why there aren't more women at major executive level in Scotland
and, really, in Britain as a whole.''
After a long illness Goldstraw's father died when she was 11, leaving
her mother to raise her single-handedly. Maybe partly because of that
early loss she values team spirit enormously, but you do also sense in
her that self-contained yet driven quality which often marks out
only-children. ''I don't know if my father's death affected my attitude
towards men. Certainly, coming from farming stock, we had a lot of male
relatives who were chauvinistic.'' Goldstraw remembers one cousin
roundly dismissing her early dream to be a vet, insisting that no woman
would be strong enough to calf a cow.
With luck, such put-downs act as spurs. Competition for Goldstraw's
present post was open to all 30 of the then existing district managers
stationed throughout the United Kingdom. She won as the result of
intensive, skilled analysis, her initial task being to unite Scotland
and Northern Ireland under one management with the aim of making the
service more accountable to customers.
Essential to that, of course, is an informed knowledge of what the
public wants. ''The starting point is also what they think of us. We've
always sought that type of information but now we try to find out what
is important without drawing on a list of pre-determined questions.'' In
fact Goldstraw's mission is to loosen up any lingering civil servant
mind-set so that the Post Office and its franchises will readily be
perceived as versatile commercial outlets.
But of the 20,000 post offices in Britain today only around 800 remain
in public ownership because of an accelerating trend to convert Crown or
main offices into agencies. This involves selling the operation to a
retailer who is then paid by the Post Office to maintain counter
services. These themselves now cover a far wider spectrum of business,
and Goldstraw wants the bill-paying facility to extend well beyond
utilities, so that increasing numbers of people automatically think of
using the post office not just for savings transactions but club
membership subscriptions (RAC dues can now be paid directly over its
counters), and, in time, theatre and travel ticketing, including airline
bookings. She also believes household insurance and even funeral plans
will eventually be a routine part of trade.
''With its vast network of outlets the service is ideally suited for
such growth.'' Proof is there already, she says, in its lead position as
Lottery ticket and scratch card retailer, and its growing success as a
Bureau de Change and travel insurance centre. But isn't there a danger
in all this diversity that the good-old post office of all our
yesteryears will overlook its core activity -- the duty to sell stamps.
''I don't like the idea of having business as of right. It's good for us
to have competition because that drives change and improvement, so I
still want us to be the main centre for buying stamps, but only because
we sell them most efficiently.''
But Goldstraw also knows as well as anyone that smart intentions and
schemes for profit can be unravelled in minutes by that curse of all
consumption -- the queue. ''Perceived waiting time is always longer than
the reality, but to the customer, of course, perceived time is the
reality.'' The fact is, though, that independent research reveals people
wait for a shorter period in the post office than they do in banks,
building societies, or supermarkets. The most recent post office
feedback shows that 97% of Scottish customers reach a counter clerk
within five minutes. Goldstraw won't be content until that small
remainder is also served inside that time.
If this hints at an unremitting personality patrolling her parish with
a stopwatch the image is unfair. Goldstraw doesn't fit the mould of
today's bullying manager. Hers is more the air of a committed
headmistress at a progressive school for girls: pleasant, articulate,
unflappable, a good listener to all employees, and tough when required:
that hard hat might also be an emblem for her own determination.
''I do believe that the right leadership approach -- valuing your
workforce, being upfront with them, and that old thing of generally
treating others as you would wish to be treated -- all this does feed
through into staff commitment and customer satisfaction, and so helps
financial results. The days of the autocratic manager ought to be gone
by now. There's so much talent out there and we must learn to harness it
in more imaginative ways.''
The Post Office, she says, can be proud of its record for
non-compulsory redundancies but industry must exploit all manner of work
options arising from new technology. ''The whole social fabric of the
country has to be reinvigorated. Five or 10 years ago great promises of
more leisure time were made because of new technology, but what is the
use of leisure if there's no sense of security?''
Goldstraw is reluctant to discuss politics publicly but, like Howard
Davies, a former director-general of the CBI and now the deputy governor
of the Bank of England, she is forthright today about her genuine
concern for the growing social divisions in Britain. ''The eighties
marked the start of a much less caring society. If you were unlucky to
be without a job then it was presumed there was something wrong with
you. To some extent that still informs certain people's attitude, but
now many of the haves also wonder if they will be the haves of the
future.''
Born in the East of Scotland and educated at Edinburgh University, she
received her marvellously pastoral surname through marriage: Brian
Goldstraw is a Royal Mail personnel manager, and they married 17 years
ago. She was a Bruce then but his name is rooted in the farmlands of
North-east England.
When women make it to the mountain-top of business they do so usually
by being outstandingly good and attentive to detail. Often, though, the
journey is carried out at significant cost to themselves. ''In 1986 I
was the first woman district manager in Britain, and to my shame I must
confess I became a bit like a man in drag, or is that a woman in drag. I
started to be a lot more authoritarian than I had been in the past, and
I can't really explain why except that it might have been the awesome
nature of the task. Perhaps I felt I should be my predecessor's
look-alike. Anyway, as my confidence grew about an ability to do the job
I relaxed back into what I hope is my natural style.''
And that style? Colleagues described it as consultative and
conciliatory. ''It took around a year for me to feel comfortable, that
is comfortable but never satisfied. Because women do believe themselves
under such scrutiny they give 110%. In my case that was a self-inflicted
pressure, and possibly still is, but as I was such an oddity I felt I
had to be better than the norm.'' Now a confident speaker on the
management conference circuit, Goldstraw has not forgotten her first
encounter at a public meeting called to discuss changes about to be
imposed on a rural post office.
''I was met at the door by a policeman who asked if I wanted
protection. I thanked him and said I thought I'd be all right. Certainly
there was a heated debate inside but I left unscathed. However, I did
feel it was probably not the best start to a new job as district
manager.'' As it happens, that particular area, which she diplomatically
leaves unnamed, now regards its newly empowered post office as
wonderful.
In the Goldstraw vision the nice, warm, friendliness of the
neighbourhood post office still has a place. It must have, if only
because she and her husband live in a village. What she wants for our
nostalgic idyll, though, is that can-do atmosphere she so admires in the
United States. And all those who forecast death by Internet for the
hand-posted letter should think on this: the sale of stamps is rising.
That time-served sponge has not yet had its day.

THE Edinburgh-based Johnston Press newspaper group yesterday confirmed
it was taking an interest in parts of the business curently up for sale
by Reed Regional Newspapers, the biggest freesheet publisher in Britain.
However, the company's managing director Tim Bowdler refused to
confirm speculation that Johnston Press has linked up with two other
group -- Midlands Independent Newspapers and the Guardian Media Group --
to launch a joint bid.
He added that if Johnston Press were to bid for a substantial part of
Reed Regional Newspapers, it would have to fund such an acquisition with
another rights issue. That, however, would depend on how big an interest
it wanted and whether it was successful in bidding for particular
titles.
''We are on record as having said that obviously the fact that Reed
Regional Newspapers had come on the market was of interest to us. There
are titles and businesses which would fit well with our current
portfolio of newspapers.
''It is obvious, also, that the whole of Reed Regional newspapers
would be too big a bite for Johnston Press. That having been said we
have looked at the whole of the RRN business in that light and can
confirm that we are interested in parts of the business.
''Whether we are involved in a consortium, or, if we were, who were
members of it, it would be inappropriate for me to comment,'' said Mr
Bowdler.
He added that from RRN's point of view, its management would probably
want to sell the business as a going concern without breaking it up. If
Mr Bowdler is correct in that view, this would lend weight to current
speculation that Johnston Press has linked up with two other groups
which have traditionally been its rivals in order to carve up the RRN
business into three separate operations convering London, the Midlands,
and northern England.
RRN, which made #18m profit on sales of #130m last year, is likely to
fetch between #150m and #200m. It publishes four evening and 90 weekly
titles, including the world's oldest newspaper, the Worcester Journal.
Johnston Press this year reported a 17% increase in 1994 pre-tax
profits to a record #14.7m and last year aquired the Halifax Courier
Holdings for #29.4m. The company currently has 81 titles, 60 of them in
England where the bulk of them are concentrated in Yorkshire and
Derbyshire. It also owns newspapers in Sussex. It is said to be
interested in some of RRN's northern titles in towns such as Doncaster,
Bolton and Blackburn.

TWO years ago WB Alloy Products ventured into England when it opened a
base in Darlington. Today its North of England presence generates
#500,000 of business.
This success encouraged the company to look further south, and last
week the Lanarkshire welding rod manufacturer opened a branch in
Birmingham.
''We expect the Birmingham operation to be at least as successful,''
said Mr John Oliver, group managing director.
In its current financial year, which has just begun, WB Alloys expects
its turnover to show a 20% improvement and reach #2m.
Its plan is to keep up this rate of increase. To achieve this progress
it intends to open more branches in England but is coy about the exact
locations.
''The Scottish engineering industry is pretty flat and we have reached
saturation point in our end of the market which is mainly the smaller
companies,'' explained Mr Oliver, ''which is why we are now targeting
England.''
This does not mean that the company has given up hopes of expanding
its business nearer its Coatbridge factory.
In addition to manufacturing welding rods, WB Alloy also supplies a
range of welding accessories, gloves, and helmets.
To increase sales in this area the company has invested in nine vans
and a direct sales approach to customers.
It has come a long way since John Oliver led a management buy-out in
June 1993 with the backing of such bodies as Scottish Enterprise and
Strathclyde Region.
Mr Oliver believes another possible route for expansion is in the
repair of gas equipment.
WB Alloys is one of only two companies in Scotland officially approved
by the British Compressed Gases Associations to do this type of work.
It already undertakes gas equipment repairs for a number of major
concerns, including Yarrows and ScotRail, and Mr Oliver intends to place
more emphasis on this area of the company's activities.

Too often the debate on the way society supports its children focuses
on the family situation rather than the long-term welfare of the
offspring. Should policies target childcare to encourage more parents to
work, would extra allowances and tax changes ease the burden? Jennifer
Cunningham and Sue Innes assess the options.
AS taxpayers we should all worry about the costs of families headed by
lone parents, because the total cost to the state of the benefits on
which most of them depend is estimated at #10bn.
The DSS knows the score. They call it lone parent benefit, because
that is who gets it. They are usually unmarried in the sense of
de-married rather than never married. Yet the critical politicians
repeatedly refer to single parents, because it carries the undercurrents
of young, single, and uncommitted.
The idea was floated last month that the lone parent benefit of #6.30
a week was to be scrapped to save an estimated #330m a year, which would
allow room for tax cutting manoeuvres. The speculation was hastily
denied as merely that, and the usual angry reaction from recipients
threatened with a cut in income was elicited.
This time round, though, the reaction was less ''how am I expected to
make ends meet?'' and more ''I am not a feckless sponger from the
state''. It is clear that jibes from MPs about teenagers becoming
pregnant to jump the housing queue have struck a deep chord of
resentment among divorced and deserted women struggling to bring up
children alone.
The setting up of the Child Support Agency was supposed to help trim
the benefits budget by extracting maintenance from absent fathers in
accordance with their income and the needs of the children. Voting power
in the form of large numbers of articulate, well-organised,
twice-married fathers and their second wives, whose concern is for the
second family, had the effect of lessening the amounts originally
diverted towards the first families.
What concerns the first wives, many of whom depend on income support,
or a mixture of housing benefit, family credit and maintenance as well
as their own earnings is that tinkering with the system almost always
leaves them worse off.
The benefits trap penalises ordinary people trying to provide for
their families and scuppers some of the best intentions of the pundits.
One of the best examples is the effect of a small amount of additional
income on housing benefit, which is removed at the rate of 65p for every
#1 of income. As one increasingly bitter and single lone parent said:
''It's taxation at a level that would get any government turfed out of
office if they tried it on any other section of society.''
The negative effect of the current benefit system on people trying to
earn their way out was unexpectedly highlighted by the deputy governor
of the Bank of England, Howard Davies, shortly before he took up the
post.
While the unexpected source attracted interest, the proposals are more
pragmatic than radical:
* Investment in training,
* Extended use of in-work benefits to allow on-the-job training,
* A springing of the Benefits Trap jobs by an extension of Family
Credit.
He raised the question of taxing child benefit, which is one of the
proposals of the Labour Party's Social Justice Commission, and extended
the principle to older children. ''Should wealthy professional people
receive grants for their student offspring? Perhaps, as many millions do
in the United States, they should cough up something towards tuition
fees?'' he suggested.
Yet the current tax debate follows the clear demonstration earlier
this year that people without children have gained tax advantages while
families with children have lost them. The gradual erosion of the
favourable tax treatment of families with dependent children means that
a married couple with two children living on average male earnings now
pay 12.9% more of their gross earnings in tax than they would have done
30 years ago, according to the report by David Utting for the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation.
Child Benefit was the replacement for child tax allowances, but for
the past 10 years has not been allowed to keep pace with inflation. At
all income levels, the extra financial responsibilities of parenthood
have gone unrecognised by the tax and benefits systems, with single
people and married couples paying less tax, while parents pay more than
a generation ago. The effects are particularly severe on families with
below average incomes. That means that tax and benefit changes have to
be tackled simultaneously.

SINGLE mums on welfare are never far from political debate. In
conference season, for Labour's leadership a ''sensible position'' on
single mothers is a marker of distance from the family-unfriendly Left.
On the Right the luxury lifestyles of the teenage mothers of Maryhill
and St Mellon's focus the fears of those who see welfare spending
spiralling out of control. Debate has been reduced to attack and
defence.
But whether you favour reducing benefits or increasing them, whether
you think lone mothers are a burden on the state or doing a great job in
difficult circumstances, the status quo is no longer an option. Welfare
support for single parents isn't working from anyone's perspective,
either in terms of keeping them and their chidren out of poverty or as a
buffer before a return to work and independence. Three-quarters of
children in one-parent families live in poverty and the gap between one
and two-parent families' average incomes has got a lot wider during the
past decade. Lone mothers are now less likely to work than they were in
1980, despite the trend of increasing women's employment.
The insecurity of many jobs now plus the poverty trap discourages
independence at the same time as there is more public focus on the need
for it.
Sue Robertson of One Parent Families, Scotland puts it bluntly: ''It's
a policy muddle.'' What's needed, she argues, is a comprehensive look at
the tax and benefits systems ''and their impact on low income families
generally -- two-parent as well as one parent''. With the current
emphasis on welfare spending and ''quick-fix solutions, narrowly
conceived answers'' she doesn't see that happening.
The most recent national survey of lone parents' circumstances,
published in late September by the DSS in conjunction with the Policy
Studies Institute, shows a slight increase in the proportion of lone
parents in work due to the change to Family Credit qualifying hours. It
found, not surprisingly, that reliable childcare was the most important
factor in whether lone parents could work, followed by decent wages, job
security and convenient hours of work. Both Family Credit and
maintenance payments were important, but much less so. The childcare
problem was, they note dryly, solved most frequently by the children
getting older.
They conclude, with qualified optimism, that part-time work, backed up
by maintenance and in-work benefits means ''lone parents can fit
together a viable, if not prosperous alternative income package in
low-paid work compared with their former life on Income Support.''
However the detail of the report partially contradicts this, showing
that for those now working 16-23 hours a week and claiming Family Credit
''their position had deteriorated noticeably since 1991, to the extent
that they were, as a group, no better off than the out-of-work lone
parents.''
Opportunities for training and education would meet most lone parents'
longer-term needs much better than low-paid work plus benefits. But the
additional costs of student life, the unavailability or cost of
childcare and the absolute maze of trying to work out funding are all
serious barriers.
The Australian system of encouraging single mothers into work and
training is a model UK politicians have looked at but there is evidence
that single mothers face considerable harassment from benefit agencies
in some areas in Australia.
Raising young children is the tie in most people's lives when their
income-to-expenditure equation, as the economists put it, is at its
least favourable. Since for many low-income families there was barely
the money to support one household, how is there enough to maintain two
after separation? Encouraging more lone mothers to work plus ''transfer
payments'' through maintenance means, in effect, creating more
two-earner families although occupying different homes. It is another
way out of hardship but has its limitations.
One single mother commented wryly: ''There's a bit of a contradiction
here. The good married mother is one who stays at home with her
children. The good single mother goes out to work!'' Since many married
mothers become lone mothers, how is she, especially if she has been at
home and has lost work skills, to turn herself into the good lone
parent?''
Research by Jane Millar at the University of Bath, and by the OECD,
shows that poverty rates among lone parents are generally higher than
average everywhere but that they vary a lot from country to country
(even with comparable economies), with around half of all lone parent
families classified as living in poverty in the USA and Australia but
only between 7% and 10% in Germany, Sweden, and Norway.
Millar's analysis shows that countries with high employment rates for
both lone and married mothers are those with better than average
childcare and where women have come closer to equal pay, and are also
countries which ensure support for children in separated families
through maintenance guarantees.
Comparing different approaches shows that the key issues in
understanding and improving lone parents' circumstances are not family
form but family-friendly employment practices, childcare and low pay,
all of which ''draw attention to what lone mothers have in common with
married mothers rather than what separates them''.

A NEW industry is waiting to be developed in Scotland and the raw
material is in our fields.
Agronomist Richard Constanduros believes that Scottish farmers could
grow commercially many of the plants which already grow wild in the
countryside for use in the food, pharmaceutical, chemical, and cosmetic
industries.
His consultancy, Agros Associates, which is based in Beauly near
Inverness, has already identified 22 species of plants in the Highlands
and Islands which could be harvested for commercial use.
When Mr Constanduros sees rowan trees in full bloom with red berries
or hawthorn hedgerows with their colourful display he can't help but
think of the uses the berries could be put to.
''In Germany there are six companies who use the extracts from rowan
berries as an ingredient in products for gargles for sore throats,'' he
explained.
There are 900 products which use extracts from Hawthorn berries and
one German company alone uses between 250-300 tonnes of dried berries
every year.
Agros Associates recently completed a project for Highland and Islands
Enterprise to identify the potential of plants which grow in the area.
''We identified 22, and some of these could be grown by crofters and
farmers, and then jointly processed on a co-operative basis,'' he said.
One possibility is the bearberry plant whose leaves provide an extract
which can be used in the treatment of bladder and kidney disorder.
In the past, processors relied for much of their supplies on Eastern
Europe where villagers would go into the fields and pick the wild
berries and plants.
Economic growth in these countries has meant this tradition is slowly
disappearing and the processors are now looking for new sources on a
more substantial basis.
Mr Constanduros explained: ''If the plants are grown commercially and
harvested properly then it means the companies receive a better quality
of plant which in turn means they can pay a higher price for the raw
material.''
Agros Associates is advising several companies in Scotland as to
possible uses for certain plants and is also trying bridge the gap
between possible growers and users.

It's very frustrating -- you feel you're getting somewhere, then you
hit another barrier.
Moyra ended up reassuring me that ''it'll be OK -- it will be, I'm
determined it will''. Yet the thicket of barriers -- bureaucratic,
economic and practical --between Moyra Loughery and the education she
once took for granted, shows little sign of being cut through even when
her daughter Zoe goes to school next year.
Moyra, who grew up in Lanark and left school with four Highers,
intended to study history at Edinburgh University when, after a summer
romance, she became pregnant. ''I thought, this is the nineties, it'll
be OK. I really thought it would be possible. I'd have to take a year
out but then I'd be able to start university.'' Instead she found that
while the University had a creche it cost #80 a week and there was no
way on a grant she could afford that. She was equally interested,
however, in a Community Education course at Moray House.
They encouraged her to apply but, sorry, there was no nursery or help
with childcare. ''Each year since when it comes time to apply I have the
same conversation with them. They encourage me, they want to have a
creche but each year they say 'maybe next year . . .' ''
The list of possibilities Moyra has explored is a long one. One
college has a creche, but only for a short course that she doesn't see
as leading anywhere. Another offered a business degree and had a creche
-- ony at a campus an hour's bus journey from the part of the college
where her lectures would be; the creche opened at 9am, the first lecture
was at 9.30.
''I want to work, I don't want to be on benefit -- just the same as
any other single parent I know. But you need a well-paid job to pay for
childcare and you won't get a well-paid job without an education. And
you can't get the education without the childcare.''
Zoe was born when she was 18. She is now four and when she goes to
school Moyra had thought she'd finally find a way. Now she's not so
sure: after-school childcare would be ideal but not all schools have it,
and it costs. She lives in an insecure rented flat and doesn't know
where she'll be living by then so doesn't know which school Zoe will be
going to. Then there's the cut in grants, plus the worry of taking on a
loan with a child to support. Too, some colleges now put a time-limit on
how long exam qualifications count towards admission.
''It's a catch 22. And there are hundreds of girls like me.''
Listening to her, you only marvel that she hasn't given up trying.
Childcare provision in all educational establishments, or help so
students can use a childminder, she argues, would save the Treasury a
fortune in the longer term. ''If I could get some qualifications I could
provide for Zoe and not cost anyone anything. It's very frustrating --
you feel you're getting somewhere and then you hit another barrier. In
this country it used to be that everybody had a right to a good
education -- it doesn't work like that anymore.
''I want Zoe to have a happy, stable home and I want to work to
provide it. I'm not daft and I don't want to be on benefit. But the only
other option is to get a bar job, but it wouldn't cover the cost of
childcare or the rent.''
Persistently seeking a way out of her own dilemma has taught her a
lot, which she now wants to use in campaigning -- ''and doing voluntary
work is another way of getting an education, after all''. If Moyra finds
a way through the maze she will have, as well as educational
qualifications, a knowledge of how policy works on the ground and an
analysis that policy-makers might envy. ''I would love just five minutes
to stand up at the Tory Party conference and tell them,'' she says.
''Say there's no need to blame single parents for being a burden on the
state -- we don't want to be and we wouldn't if we had the assistance.''
If Moyra can see where the solutions lie, why can't the policy-makers?

* LIZ Cameron is that relatively rare thing, a single mother in
adequately paid work. ''There are no easy solutions. Childcare's the
main thing. I've spent four years trying to get after-school care for
our area. Now they're getting it and I can't afford it,'' she says.
Penilee, where she lives, in not considered socially-deprived so
there's no subsidy available. ''And there's no cover for the school
holidays -- what's the point without that? Not everybody's got a granny
to help out.''
At 42, and a qualified nurse with a lot of work experience, Cameron is
only able to work consistently now that her oldest child, Donna, is 16.
She still working on a temporary basis. She has three girls and a boy,
the youngest is aged nine. She is also a widow -- although she was
separated from her husband for a period prior to his death three years
ago.
''I'm lucky,'' she says. ''It's a hundred times more difficult when
your children are younger and if you have no qualifications or work
experience.'' Before this year she could only do shifts at weekends.
''As a lone parent you have to give more time to your children -- you
have to compensate them I suppose. I don't mean materially because you
can't but you have to give them more of your time and self. At work I
think well that's the TV licence and the phone bill -- getting the bills
paid take a tremendous strain off it. Having enough hot water, feeling
the children are well-fed and reasonably clothed.''
She'd like a part-time job but there are none on offer; nor can she
see how ward routines could fit with school hours. Instead, for three
days a week she gets her eldest up, before leaving at 7am and then
phones from work to make sure they're leaving for school at 8.30. The
two back shifts mean a day to clean the house and another for washing
and shopping, and leaving a meal ready cooked when she leaves at 1.45pm,
plus a note of the chores the children must do. ''I'm a very organised
person -- you have to be. Yes, it is exhausting and fraught with
problems. But Christmas is in 12 weeks, and Louise needs a coat for
school.''
On a widow's pension she pays tax, but doesn't face the pound for
pound deductions for income earned which are part of the Income Support
poverty trap. But she is not eligible for a number of other benefits,
such as loans for equipment (like a washing machine -- sore point) and
''passport'' benefits like free school meals.
''And having four of them, well, you're stretched out. I need to get
out sometimes to keep my sanity -- talking to other people, feeling I'm
not just a mother, that there are lots of things I can do.''
Most single parents, she's convinced, given the opportunity and the
childcare would go out to work.
''I get so angry at how single parents are seen. Okay, there's some
16-year-olds but most are mature women who've got out of a bad marriage.
Politicians! Unless you have to live with it you can't truly understand.
Anyone should think twice before they make single parents feel as if
they are parasites -- there but for the grace of God . . . .''

As some firms set themselves broader horizons, Harry Conroy looks
through the corporate window at some prime movers in the big picture
BUSINESS partners Bernard Paul Dunn and Jack Murphy are looking to
expand their double glazing firm throughout Scotland and Asia.
Pyramid Windows (uPVC) Ltd is in its tenth year. Until two years ago
it specialised in supplying replacement windows mainly for Scottish
local authorities.
Its horizons widened, however, when approached by a Malaysian
businessman who often visited Scotland to play golf.
''Our contact had spotted PVC tilt and turn windows while in Holland
on a business trip,'' explained Mr Dunn, ''and this type of window it
seems was not common in Malaysia.''
The firm eventually formed a Malaysian joint venture company, Pyramid
Scotframe, and now have a 12,000 sq ft factory in Klang, just south of
Kuala Lumpur, employing 15 Malaysians.
''We are having to educate the market in Malaysia regarding PVC
windows,'' said Mr Murphy, ''but our factory is already the largest PVC
window manufacturer in South East Asia.''
The partners visit their Malaysian factory three times a year, and
already their Far East development has clinched several lucrative
contracts, including a 600 bungalow development and the Malaysian High
Commission building in Singapore.
''The theory of double glazing and thermal efficient windows works in
reverse in Malaysia where their job is to keep the heat out of buildings
rather than in,'' explained Mr Dunn.
Pyramid Window is now looking at a similar business venture in Taiwan
where it is talking to a prospective partner. It has also assisted in
establishing a PVC window manufacturing company in Mauritias.
However, it is not only abroad that Pyramid has been expanding. In
Scotland turnover has increased from #2.4m to #4.1m, and it now employs
72 people at its Chapelhall factory in Lanarkshire.
''We work for almost every local authority within a 50 mile radius of
the factory, and are the market leaders in the local authority window
replacement market,'' said Mr Murphy.
The increased turnover came from a deliberate decision last year to
expand the Lanarkshire factory.
''We were working to capacity, and could not take on more work,'' said
Mr Dunn, ''but we decided to expand the manufacturing unit here, and
employ a further 15 people.''

A TWO-WEEK-OLD baby was fighting for her life yesterday after her
23-year-old mother was killed in a head-on crash on the weekend.
Shannon Wilson was critically ill yesterday in Glasgow's Royal
Hospital for Sick Children. Just two weeks ago, her parents, Sandy, 29,
and Rachel, 23, had celebrated the birth of their first child in
Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.
This weekend was to have been their first wedding anniversary.
The couple had visited Mr Wilson's parents in Oban and were heading
towards Skye to celebrate their anniversary with family when the
accident happened on the A87 at Balmacare, near Kyle of Lochalsh.
Mr Wilson, a chef at the Cuillin Hills Hotel in Portree, was seriously
injured in the crash. Last night, he was ''seriously ill'' in the
MacKinnon Memorial Hospital at Broadford on Skye, 200 miles from his
baby's intensive-care ward at Yorkhill.
Shannon was thrown from her parents' Peugeot when it and a Volkswagen
collided head-on just after 5.30pm on Friday.
The occupants of the Volkswagen, Mr John MacLeod, 49, his wife,
Katherine, 42, and son, Keith, 14, of Skye, received minor injuries.
A child specialist, a nurse, and an incubator were flown from Raigmore
Hospital by air ambulance to Broadford Hospital late on Friday night
before the baby was airlifted to Glasgow.
Mrs Wilson was a native of Raasay, where her parents, Finlay and
Isabella Maclennan, run the island's post office and general store.

A SCOTTISH couple are celebrating the birth of their two daughters,
born two years after their ''triplet'' brother.
Mrs Sarah Gordon has just given birth to twin daughters, Jane and
Mary, 26 months after having their brother, Jimmy. Technically, they are
triplets as they all came from the same batch of fertilised eggs.
Mrs Gordon and her husband, Neil, of Gight, near Methlick,
Aberdeenshire, were told five years ago they could not have children
naturally and they decided to have in vitro fertilisation treatment.
In 1992, nine eggs taken from Mrs Gordon, 33, were fertilised using
sperm from Mr Gordon. Two of the eggs were frozen and hospital staff
decided which three of the remaining seven had the most chance of
success.
Mrs Gordon said: ''They put those three eggs back in, one of them
took, and I became pregnant with Jimmy. We were so occupied with him
that we did not think too much about the frozen ones.
''But at Christmas last year we thought 'they are there, we should
given them a whirl' so we went back to hospital.
''I did not really think for a minute that I had any chance of getting
pregnant again.
''When I found out I was pregnant, I found it unbelievable. Then, when
I was having a scan, the nurse said she could see two.''
When the girls were born two weeks early on September 29, Jane weighed
in at 5lbs 14oz and Mary tipped the scales at 6lbs 4oz.
It is the first time doctors at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital's assisted
reproduction unit have had births spread over a period of time
originating from eggs fertilised at one time.
''Births of this nature are not unknown but are very unusual,'' said
consultant Mr Mark Hamilton.
''We have had triplets before but all born together, so the Gordons
are very lucky,'' he added.
The treatment which the Gordons paid #4000 for is now to be available
to a limited number of childless couples in Grampian.
Grampian Health Board recently agreed to fund IVF care on the NHS for
100 sets of potential parents.
''We would not have grudged paying the money even if we did not have
any success because at least we would have known we had tried everything
and given it our best shot,'' said Mrs Gordon.
''I am so glad this treatment is now available on the NHS. It must be
heaven for families who cannot afford it to finally get the chance.
''It is important that they give this funding but it is not enough. It
should be available to everyone and should be up to a couple and no-one
else to decide if they want to try more than once.''

It is now 35 years since legislation ended the horrors of life in some
of our psychiatric hospitals. Unfortunately, says PETER GRAFTON, society
still needs World Mental Health Day
IT'S a bizarre coincidence that 35 years ago tomorrow -- World Mental
Health Day -- Hitchcock's Psycho opened at the Gaumont, Glasgow. A new
Mental Health Act had just been passed that year, replacing legislation
that, in some respects had hardly changed since the late nineteenth
century.
The Lunacy (Consolidation) Act of 1890 in England and Wales had laid
down that only those patients ''certified'' as mad could be admitted to
hospital. What had started as an attempt to allay public fears about the
improper detention of people in asylums ended up with hospitals full of
people who couldn't get out of them until years later, when the 1959 and
1960 Mental Health Acts brought in ''de-certification''.
Put bluntly, if you were ''certified'' as a teenager in 1910 the
chances were that you'd die in hospital of old age.
If you were that teenager, ''de-certified'' and released on October
10, 1960, it's an odds-on bet that your first act of freedom wouldn't be
to rush to see Psycho.
Although Scotland had had a system of ''voluntary'' admission
alongside ''certification'' during this period, the reality was that a
young man could be admitted, for instance, to Dingleton Psychiatric
Hospital in the Borders, for ''insubordination''. Other psychiatric
conditions in the 1930s included ''moral laxity'', a condition diagnosed
among single pregnant women.
Whether morally condemned or medically diagnosed, treatment was
limited and too often desperately drastic. Anti-depressants and
anti-psychotic medication would not become available until the 1950s.
Until then either electro-convulsive therapy, insulin coma treatment,
psycho-surgery, castor oil, or locked wards could be the medical
response.
It would have been too ''X'' rated for Hitchcock to have focused on
some of the horrors that were happening behind closed doors. When
Georges Franju's La Tete Contre Les Murs (The Keepers, 1958), with its
chilling depiction of life in a French psychiatric hospital, was first
shown on television in the 1960s, the BBC had to preface the
transmission with a statement from the French Government stating that
conditions as depicted no longer existed.
Jimmy Laing's own Scottish story of 50 years in the system is another
appalling illustration of everything that could be wrong with
psychiatric hospital ''care''. There were exceptions. During the 1950s
Dingleton Hospital and the Maudsley in London were gaining reputations
for a progressive approach to care and treatment.
Meanwhile in America, around the time that Psycho was flickering
across the screens of five continents, Ken Kesey was writing a novel
about his experiences of working in a psychiatric hospital. When the
novel was filmed 15 years later it would anger and outrage audiences
world-wide. Its name? One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.
''John'' (not his real name) remembers what it was like to be a
patient in a Scottish psychiatric hospital at that time. In the week
that Psycho went on general release Tell Laura I Love Her was number one
in the Top Ten, shortie-style raincoats and rayon ballerina skirts were
the fashion, Senior's were 3/6d for 20 and Bonanza and The White Heather
Club were on television.
But for John and the others there was no television in the ward to
watch, the nurses controlled the ward radio, clothes were hospital
issue, and cigarettes were rationed. John was 27 in 1960. He'd been in
institutions since 1939, the year war broke out.
John was six when he was first admitted. ''Mary'' (not her real name)
was 19 when she went into hospital in 1959. Although she had her own
clothes they still disappeared in the laundry wash. She'd supplement her
cigarettes with the extra one she got for polishing the ward. Striking
up friendships with male patients was discouraged.
The reforming Mental Health Acts of 1959 and 1960 meant not only
''de-certification'', but for the first time made psychiatric in-patient
care possible within a general hospital. Equally far reaching, the Acts
put an obligation on local authorities to provide community care. There
were two schools of thought about this new ''community'' approach, and
the then recent availability of psychiatric medication.
The optimists believed the new drugs and community care policies would
halve the psychiatric hospital population. The pessimists saw the new
drugs as basically sedating, and believed that both health boards and
local authorities were less than enthusiastic about community care.
Unfortunately, the pessimists were too often right. John recalls being
asked in the 1960s by a psychiatrist if he knew the difference between
an apple and an orange. ''Doctor,'' he replied, ''you taste it and
see.'' He was then asked if he knew how many pennies there were in a
pound. He replied truthfully: ''Doctor, I've never had a pound to know
how many pennies in a pound.''
Two days after the interview, John says, his medication was doubled
(it was the anti-psychotic Largactil). His face went scarlet, a side
effect, and, as he puts it, ''I suffered torture.''
Mary, who now has her own flat in the community, still remembers the
soreness of the injections she got for ''shouting'' in hospital. The
Mental Health (Scotland) Act of 1984 underlined and extended the reforms
of the earlier Acts, and kick-started Community Care. Mary was
discharged from hospital in 1994.
Both agree that things have got better, but for both it's been a case
of too little and too late. ''They took my life away,'' John says. When
he was finally discharged in 1992 he'd been in ''the system '' 53 years.
And how can doctors and nurses help ill people? ''They should be nice to
them,'' says Mary, ''because they're not very well.''
Throughout the world, wherever illness is still exorcised by beatings,
wherever illness is ''cured'' by containment or punishment, wherever an
ill person is seen as a diagnosis and not as a person with an illness,
then we are going to continue to need world mental health days. Although
John wants the truth of his own experience told, he doesn't use his real
name for fear of being put back ''inside''. That that is the legacy of
53 years of ''care'' is the real shocker.
* The Real Shocker is written by Peter Grafton, a former psychiatric
in-patient and now Education Co-ordinator for Renfrewshire Association
for Mental Health.

EVERY performance by our national music companies, in the light of the
events of late last week, is a political statement as well as a musical
one. We now know that not only Scottish Opera is in desperate trouble,
but that the orchestras are also heading for a financial precipice.
And we also know that the heads of these organisations, though they
cannot say it publicly, are -- in the words of one this weekend --
''completely scunnered'' at the attitude of the Scottish Arts Council,
which is not going to represent their case to the Government. So if the
bureaucrats of the SAC, completely becalmed in a sea of their own jargon
and doublespeak, will not recognise the quality of the companies they
are supposed to safeguard, then we'll all have to do it for them.
And there was a striking example on Saturday night in the opening
concert of the Royal SNO's winter season, with a blistering performance,
under Alexander Lazarev, of Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony, an
appropriately subversive work for these times. It was the sort of
playing, with the RSNO at white heat, that made you want to stick it in
the face of the SAC and force it to recognise what we've got here in
Scotland.
The scorching performance -- bristling with grit, defiance, and
aggression -- produced by Lazarev and the RSNO was streets ahead of many
you will hear elsewhere (and I include the new recording by the Kirov
Orchestra).
Its complement, in the first half, was a supremely concentrated, fleet
yet soulful account of Elgar's Cello Concerto with soloist Steven
Isserlis in magical form. A good turnout; and never has public support
been more urgently needed.

AS Stewart Laing's She Wolf opens at The Citizens', his Opera-Go-Round
staging of Puccini is in the closing stages of a tour which began at the
beginning of last month (you can still see it in Oban tomorrow,
Stranraer on Thursday, Ayr on Saturday, and at Glasgow's Tron on Tuesday
October 17). The same attention to detail -- as befits their origins --
can be seen in both pieces, but this Boheme may still cause a frisson in
the breasts of traditionalists.
Laing's quartet of starving artists inhabit a simply-suggested garret
(a balcony rail along the front edge of the stage is particularly
effective). They are a louche, cynical posse, not excepting Rodolfo, and
the production goes out of its way not to engender sympathy for them.
The casting, however, does the trick. This is a young, attractive crew
whose acting is sharp.
This may be a piano accompaniment show (by musical director Jeremy
Silver) but Laing orchestrates a busy stage, full of business that never
distracts from the focus of the story, occasionally choreographing
stylised shapes with his performers.
The singing is first-rate. Incredibly this was Ian Storey's first show
back as Rodolfo after missing a couple of performances with pleurisy,
but the tenor was in fine form. Ditto Sarah Rhodes's Mimi, although she
had sensibly eschewed genuine illness.
But of a strong cast, Roderick Williams (Marcello) could be the name
to watch out for. A rich baritone perfectly capable of producing a clear
note with a mouthful of baguette, he is also a very thoughtful
performer.
Take a hanky, though. By Mimi's death scene our sympathies are
entirely won round and you may never see her often excruciating demise
more movingly done.

THE Government will trigger a new row over smoking and cancer today
when it accuses the European Commission of pandering to the tobacco
industry at the expense of public health.
The attack will be made by Junior Health Minister Tom Sackville at the
start of Europe Against Cancer Week -- a commission initiative to
increase awareness of the disease, cut down smoking, and promote
healthier lifestyles.
Years of antagonism between London and Brussels over British refusal
to agree to an EU-wide ban on all forms of tobacco advertising has come
to a head in a European survey criticising UK attitudes towards cancer
risk and possible cures.
Mr Sackville's speech, to be delivered at the London launch of the
latest anti-cancer drive, accuses Brussels of double standards --
promoting anti-smoking campaigns while spending hundreds of millions of
pounds a year supporting the production of tobacco in seven EU member
states.
He says Britain has one of the best track records in Europe for
cutting smoking and discouraging the purchase of cigarettes, but the
Government's efforts are undermined by lack of action elsewhere in
Europe, including at EU Commission headquarters.
''Hundreds of millions of pounds of subsidies are still being paid to
tobacco farmers in southern Europe. If Europe Against Cancer is to mean
anything, Europe must stop pandering to the tobacco industry at the
expense of its people's health,'' he says.
Mr Sackville will also point out that Britain is doing more than most
other countries to keep cigarette prices high through taxation. Only
Denmark has higher prices -- while holidaymakers can buy cigarettes at a
quarter of the UK price in Spain and bring back virtually unlimited
quantities because of the single market.

I'D imagine that most people, like me, lost contact with Big Country
sometime around the dismal Seer album, nearly 10 years ago. There was a
time in the early 1980s (the ''Celtic grunge years''?) when things
looked promising for fists-in-the-air folk rock, but that time passed,
Simple Minds and U2 moved on and blanded out (to serious financial
gain), and Big Country, stubbornly clutching their Neil Young albums in
one hand and Hugh MacDiarmid collections in the other, were sent
straight to rock 'n' roll oblivion.
So there's something almost tragic about this show -- it's painful
watching ex-rock stars making last-gasp grabs at imaginary lifelines. As
an attempt to prove that Big Country can still teach pop's young pups a
thing or two, it fails miserably -- there is nobody here under 20.
In fact, stepping into the Barrowlands for this show is entering a
cultural vacuum; there are no signifiers of contemporary British music,
either visual or aesthetic, only a sea of Big Country T-shirts (where do
they go the rest of the year?), beer guts, and beards.
During the Fields of Fire-accompanied stage ''invasion'', I wonder how
it feels trying to convert an audience to new material when you know
that everybody's really here to sing-along with a tune you wrote 15
years ago.
The show ends with a cover of Neil Young's Hey Hey, My My. Stuart
Adamson looks like he's enjoying it, but it must take every shred of
dignity for him to sing ''It's better to burn out than fade away'' with
his head held high.

I'M a sucker for Willy Russell. At their best, his plays do just about
everything that good plays should do. They amuse, they move, and they
provoke. And seeing Our Day Out again is a refreshing reminder of what
socialism used to be like before Tony Blair got his hands on it.
Which is why it's rather odd to find it cropping up at Perth Theatre,
never noted for being a hotbed of radicalism. This tale about a remedial
class of Liverpool teenagers who are taken on a day trip to North Wales
(here transferred to a class of Glaswegians heading to Dunbar) is the
kind of cheap and cheerful thing you can imagine fitting in at, say, the
Byre Theatre in St Andrews, but in neighbouring Perth it seems as if
creatures from another planet have just landed.
Not that the audience is put off. There's enough straightforward
comedy in the misadventures of this gang of underprivileged children --
pluckily played by members of Perth Youth Theatre -- for anyone to be
happy going along for the ride.
But Russell's weightier theme, simply put and passionately felt, about
a generation of children neglected by an education system that knows
society has no use for them, is an alarming argument that, thanks to the
playwright's ability to keep the audience on his side, is keenly felt.
Colin Gray's production is a little rough round the edges (only to be
expected with Perth's short rehearsal times) and the music sounds as if
it's been recorded and played on a personal stereo. But Ian McNicholl's
set is fun and, with a heartening performance by Alyxis Daly, the show
has the right warmth and fizzy energy to carry it through splendidly.

SCOTS are being urged to follow commonsense diet and exercise regimes
in a bid to reduce cancer.
The advice comes at the start of Europe Against Cancer Week and
includes an often-repeated warning to give up smoking, cut down on
alcohol and fatty foods, eat more fruit and vegetables, and take regular
exercise.
The Europe-wide campaign, designed to spotlight cancer prevention and
treatment, also advises that people visit a doctor if they notice any
unusual lumps, suffer dramatic weight loss, or are plagued by persistent
coughs and hoarseness.
Women are advised to have regular cervical smear tests and participate
in mammographic screening programmes if they are over 50.
Yesterday, Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
claimed the self-help strategy, combined with Government health
campaigns, had seen a slight reduction in the number of premature deaths
from cancer in Scotland.

AS he is being hailed as the next Chancellor, I was interested in the
content of Gordon Brown's address to his party's conference. I have long
since given up hope of even the slightest reaffirmation of anything
approaching socialism from those quarters, but I wanted to see how much
of a difference to expect should Labour win the next General Election.
I was hard pushed to find anything which could be described even as
social democratic. Indeed the most radical proposals -- on cutting VAT
on fuel, and spending on unemployment -- were only being considered, and
were not firm pledges.
Labour has become a conservative party, wanting to keep the bulk of
the Thatcher revolution in place, from the refusal to renationalise
public utilities, through to the acceptance of the post-1979
anti-trade-union legislation, and the abandonment of redistributive
taxation.
Perhaps most disappointing of all is the refusal to set a figure on
the minimum wage; without a figure this pledge is meaningless.
May I advise Labour activists to return to The Ragged Trousered
Philanthropists which I suspect has become the Little Read Book in New
Labour? Sadly, in a climate which sees the increase of temporary
contracts, the lack of job security, and the insistence that very low
pay is the only way to ensure employment, Robert Tressell's book is
becoming more and more relevant, not less.

<HEADLINE>Funding attack on university. Leading scientist demands radical change.</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975978708</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LEADING scientist based at Dundee University has launched an attack
on the leadership and financial management of the institution.
Professor Philip Cohen, who is credited with building up bio-medical
and life sciences at Dundee University to rival those at Oxford,
Cambridge, and Edinburgh, has called for a radical change in the running
of the university.
Widely tipped as a future Nobel Prize laureate, Professor Cohen
earlier this year persuaded the Wellcome Foundation to invest #20m in a
new Biomedical Sciences Institute on the Dundee campus. It will recruit
240 scientists, taking the number of researchers and staff working in
biomedical sciences in Dundee to 1500.
But, had he not been successful in attracting the Wellcome investment,
Professor Cohen said he feared many of his top researchers would have
deserted Dundee because of inadequate laboratory facilities.
The Department of Biochemistry, headed by Professor Cohen, is
internationally renowned and is the only department at Dundee University
to have attained a top ''five'' rating for its research.
But critical underfunding had threatened its position as a centre of
world-class research, Professor Cohen warned.
He said the ''weakness'' of some other departments was a threat to
biochemistry, already labouring under financial stress.
''The labs in our existing building are run-down and we need a lot of
money to refurbish them,'' Professor Cohen said. ''There are many good
things happening here, but I never rest on my laurels and we still face
many dangers.
''I'd like to see the University of Dundee make some more radical
decisions in terms of deciding where to put money and where not to. A
bit more leadership is required in the university.''
The professor's remarks were made in the same week his colleague,
Professor David Lane, was honoured with a #120,000 prize for
ground-breaking cancer research, by the Curie Institute in Paris.
Last night, a colleague, who declined to be named, said: ''Philip is
just sounding off and talking through a hole in his head. His department
would not be in the red if they had gone out and attracted more
undergraduate students.
''To be properly funded, departments have to strike a balance between
research and teaching.
''Because of biochemistry's excellence in research, it has tended to
neglect the need to build up its student numbers.''
0 University vice-principal Dr David Swinfen rejected the suggestion
that the university lacked leadership and said major funding changes,
which might eliminate some courses, were being considered.
''Philip Cohen is a fighter and he fights his own corner,'' Dr Swinfen
said. ''Many comments and complaints he has made are ones that we fully
agree with.
''We have exercised considerable leadership in proposing to introduce
a new system to fund departments.
''Two working groups will put forward their final reports to the
university's planning and resources committee on October 16.
''The introduction of the new system, if agreed, requires leadership
at the top. There will be opposition because people don't like the
status quo being upset.''
Dr Swinfen said many people involved in planning the changes would
agree university staff were ''spreading ourselves too thin''.
''Biochemistry, in terms of research, is absolutely at the top of the
tree,'' Dr Swinfen said. ''I admit that there are parts of the
university that are not in that league, but they might have other things
going for them. They might be attracting students.''

DESPITE his well-rehearsed, well-delivered, and passionate speech
which roused his faithful followers, Mr Tony Blair refused again to
answer two very simple questions on unemployment. Mr Gordon Brown has
also failed to answer these questions.
First: what total of unemployed, nationwide, will be Labour Party
accept as satisfactory?
Second: knowing that automation has greatly reduced the number of
workers in many factories, and that some machines can do the work of 10
manual workers, how, even with retraining financed by a ''windfall''
tax, will the Labour Government suddenly find one-and-a-half to two
million jobs? This can only be done if they ''manufacture'' new jobs,
paid for the Government and thus eventually paid for by our taxes.
I suggest that, for political reasons, no-one in the Labour Party --
not even Mr Blair -- will have the courage to stand up and answer these
two simple questions.

WHO does Tony Blair think he is? He may not share the STUC view, as
articulated by Campbell Christie. None the less he surely must respect
the integrity and maturity of both the STUC as an organisation and
Campbell Christie as its spokesperson.
Campbell Christie is never naive. He is seeking to negotiate for what
he believes in, and what's wrong with that in a democracy? Any notions
about a leader's divine right to rule fell into disrepute a long time
ago.
I am left wondering if it matters what any of us who have worked in
the Constitutional Convention or live in Scotland believe. It seems that
if Tony Blair has his way, we will just have to take the kind of home
rule he chooses to give us.
I have been down that blind alley with Labour before, and I do not
intend to do it again.

THE Labour Party is now committed to collecting a windfall tax from
the privatised utilities amounting to #2.5 billion. This money will be
spent on creating jobs for the unemployed under the age of 25.
We are told this is to be a one-off tax, but in the light of your
report (October 2) concerning the enormous share windfalls received by
the leaders of some of the largest businesses in the private sector, is
it not just possible that a future Labour Government might find another
windfall tax an attractive option?
Most people would agree this sort of unearned income is grotesque, but
where is the line to be drawn and what will be the consequences in terms
of jobs if the real entrepreneurs decide the game is not worth the
candle?
Of great concern, however, is the idea that #2.5 billion will, at a
stroke, remove the under-25s from the unemployed register by the
creation of jobs. Just how many jobs will be created? If the target were
to be say half a million jobs then #2.5 billion will provide #2000 per
year for two-and-a-half years. Then what?
Of course by then we shall have a minimum wage. Even at #3 per hour, a
40-hour-per-week job costs more than #6000 per year and at #4 per hour a
35-hour-per-week job costs more than #8000 per year. Who is going to pay
the difference?
Just what sort of jobs are these going to be? A real job, which is
sustainable in the long term, must either produce something people want
to buy, or provide a service for which someone is prepared to pay. Just
where are these jobs going to appear from upon the instant that Labour
is elected?
If there is such a demand for people to do this work, whatever it may
be, surely some enterprising employer would have already found a way of
getting the job done.
We must not forget that the current welfare budget, of which
unemployment benefit forms a major part, is #92 billion per year, so
#2.5 billion does not look very significant.
I suspect that we are again being subjected to another massive
soundbite-with-a-smile con trick.

In the beginning was the backcloth . . . Clare Henry focuses on the
studio portrait angle of Fotofeis, a Scotland-wide festival of
international photography
PHOTOGRAPHY as art? Does the camera lie? What is reality anyway? Big
questions -- but on a more mundane level, try the physical challenge of
tackling Fotofeis, a top-rate, exciting, exhilarating, but exhausting
festival of international photography with, wait for it, 101 shows
scattered all over Scotland from Dumfries to Benbecula.
It's diverse, truly international, and incredibly well-run, certainly
the biggest and best UK photo event. Together with the splendid Light
From A Dark Room: 150 Years of Scottish Photography, at the Royal
Scottish Academy till October 15, it may at last precipitate fine-art
photography into the big-time.
Fotofeis is modelled on the famous Houston Fotofest, whose president,
Fred Baldwin, is in town, one of 60 high-powered delegates from Moscow
to China and Canada, Berlin to Braga, Japan to Sweden. Baldwin told me:
''Our festival began in 1986, but Paris came first in 1980. This year
Scot Ron O'Donnell showed in our European section. I think Scotland's
Fotofeis is just wonderful: great shows -- and what terrific landscape
to drive through too!''
We were on a coach packed with curators visiting Ayr and Kilmarnock at
the start of this weekend's comprehensive five-day launch. Today
Aberdeen is the focus with 11 shows opening. The city also hosts
Fotofeis's conference next month.
Fotofeis has three main, broad themes: mortality, migration, and
cities. Some of the strongest shows, like Harry's Diary at Glasgow's
Tramway, address the taboos of old age, illness, and mortality, which I
will look at later separately. But I'll start with a theme of my own
which I fell on by chance: the posed studio photograph from Europe to
India and Africa.
My father was a photographer so I grew up with the concept of studios,
darkrooms, and big plate cameras along with Leicas and film. My father
even possessed a painted backcloth for portraiture, inherited from the
1920s. For in the beginning was the backcloth: a painted landscape or
architectural setting for folk to pose by.
It's by no means a European phenomenon. In India it continues to this
day -- as Satish Shama demonstrates in the wonderfully theatrical Dreams
That Money Can Buy at the Dick Institute, Kilmarnock. Here Indian
families pose for the photowallah in front of painted backdrops of
Rajput tigers, famous film stars, or crude cardboard cutouts of cars or
Vespas. Children in their Sunday best hold old black telephones: the
status symbol of the rich in India. Anyone who has ever tried to make a
phone call there will understand its significance!
These small family snapshots make no attempt to hide their staged
make-believe via any digital seamlessness. They are what they are: a
surreal set for the enactment of dreams and fantasy of power and wealth.
We all want to look our best in photos. In West Africa, Seydou Keita
understands this. In 1945 his father gave him a camera aquired from
Senegal plus money for film. ''So I took up photography. I had no help
and knew nothing. In all sincerity it's a job that I've tried to do as
well as possible. I love photography so much.''
Keita became a successful commercial photographer, standing his
clients against a patterned hanging or bedspread. ''I changed it every
three years. That's how I date the 1950s shots. Sometimes these
backdrops went well with the clothes, but that was just luck. I had lots
of clients. Saturdays were best; sometimes there were over a hundred.
Not everyone could afford good gear. In the studio I had three different
European suits, with tie, shirt, shoes, hat -- the lot. And props:
Biros, a radio set, a telephone.
''I did the printing during the night and put the finishing touches
next morning, before clients came for their pictures. It was vital their
finery came out well. Customers liked my photos because of the clarity,
precision, composition, and backdrop.
''I never used colour because you had to send everything to France!
Anyway, I prefer black and white. I had the same camera, same format. I
never met or saw any foreign photographers or magazines. Today lots of
people get called photographers, but plenty don't know a thing. It's
machines that do the work.''
See his stunning images at Edinburgh's Fruitmarket before visiting
American Photography at the Gallery of Modern Art. This blockbuster
includes big names from 1890 on. Steichen takes Stieglitz posed in
starched collar and tie in 1909 and Gloria Swanson glamorous in 1914
lace. Walker Evans sets his tired tenant-farmer's wife against
clapboard.
Orson Welles is hypnotic, Irving Penn elegant, Avedon caresses
Bardot's hair -- and full circle to Liebling's Negro Boy &amp; Car, New York
1948. A surreal set-up features in Faurer's 1947 manipulated image of a
masked man and an imaginative 1946 shot of Max Ernst by Sommer which
surely inspired several TV ads.
In contrast Darius's portraits of refugees in a Berlin Red Cross
hostel (at Glasgow's Street Level) seem heartbreakingly honest.
Wide-eyed children from Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Vietnam,
and Iraq stare at the lens in hope, resignation, and despair. See
happier kids at Edinburgh's Museum of Childhood where Children in Focus
1860-1960 would welcome donations of old snaps.
The Bitter Years 1939-47: Europe through the Eyes of Czech
Photographers at Edinburgh's Talbot Rice contains Fotofeis's most
memorable posed photograph. Amid the horrifying ruins of bombed Warsaw
two soldiers smile for the tripod cameraman in front of his tattered
backcloth painted with a peaceful pastoral and strung from makeshift
poles. Is it malevolent Nazi war propaganda or merely a happy family
snap of a city returning to some sort of normality? Without a date it's
difficult to tell.
So how credible is photographic reality? Do photographic spin doctors
rule the roost? It's a topic also explored by Frohlich and Palmer at
Glasgow School of Art, by Rothchild and Nicoll on posters in Glasgow
Underground, Maud Sulter at CCA, Witkinat Street Level, Thorneycroft at
the Collective, Modotti at Inverleith House, Gray in Ayr, Club 2000 at
Transmission, Stephenson in Paisley, and by Hafkenscheid at KJP Gallery,
where he exploits the line between photographic fact and fiction with
artificial light and dramatised poses. Authenticity? It's half the
problem -- and half the fun.
One thought. If Fotofeis's small team led by Alasdair Foster can
manage to collaborate with venues all over Scotland, thus raising
photography's profile nationwide, why can't someone do the same for
painting or sculpture? Aberdeen's supremo, Ian McKenzie Smith, was one
of several who suggested to me that a co-ordinated, themed nationwide
Scottish painting festival would be a good move.
Meanwhile, amid the glory that is Fotofeis, one area lets the side
down. Glasgow Museums, all 11 of them, ignore Fotofeis. It took a French
curator from Edinburgh to get them to accept minimal imput (a train
image at the Transport Museum, a jigsaw picture and book at
Kelvingrove). This is not good enough. Glasgow deserves a major
blockbuster on the lines of Edinburgh's world-class American Photography
show. Oh dear. Thumbs down again.

IT was with some disappointment that I read Tom Weir's article
(September 30). The background information is not wholly accurate and
may have led to an inappropriate conclusion.
The National Land Fund set up in 1946 by Hugh Dalton, was indeed used
to acquire the Rowardennan Estate in lieu of death duties. What the
article does not make clear is that the Treasury directed that the land
was to be transferred to the Secretary of State for Scotland as Forestry
Minister without restriction, but with the general requirement to
increase the nation's timber reserves following the ravages of two world
wars.
The Forestry Commission fully refunded the purchase price of the land
and since purchase the public has enjoyed free and unrestricted access
on foot to this area which is now part of the Queen Elizabeth Forest
Park. The woodland is managed fully in accordance with the principles of
the National Land Fund and indeed with the recommendations of the 1947
report on National Parks in Scotland.
Not only does the public enjoy access to some wonderful woodlands,
conifer and broadleaves; we are also able to provide valuable timber
from the area.
The article gives the impression that we will be planting the whole of
Rowardennan with sitka spruce, but this is simply not the case. Our
plans are based on a carefully balanced view of all the benefits the
Loch Lomond woodlands can provide, not just the conservation highlighted
in the article but also the recreation and timber production benefits,
fully meeting our objective of providing multi-purpose forests, an
objective that has been widely supported in recent years.
The replanting plan involves a considerable increase in the amount of
native broadleaf woodland and open space, together with areas of
timber-producing woodland designed in such a way as to produce a
Rowardennan woodland that is able to provide a continuation of the
valued oakwoods as well as recreation opportunities and timber for
tomorrow's needs.

NOW that we have been reminded by Tom Weir of the nation's vision for
Loch Lomond (September 30) action must be taken now to establish a
special authority with responsibilities for the planning and management
of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs area.
We have all forgotten that the Rowardennan Estate was purchased with
money from the National Land Fund, formed from the sale of war surplus
and inspired by Dr Hugh Dalton's wish to have the best of the country
secured as the heritage of all in tribute to those who laid down their
lives for their country.
The Government has already shown a willingness to have special
arrangements made for the future administration of Loch Lomond and the
Trossachs. It wholeheartedly approved of the joint committee recommended
by its working party, chaired by Sir Peter Hutchison.
But that is not enough with time passing and the new local authorities
still undecided on the course they will take when they come into being
in April. To persuade them of the nation's commitment to the area, the
Government should make it clear that it will provide adequate financial
resources over the long term.
It should also show greater leadership in guiding them towards the
establishment of a joint board, a model that equates more appropriately
with a national park.
The three new unitary authorities directly concerned, Stirling, Argyll
and Clydebank and Dumbarton, have a difficult task ahead of them. But to
give Dalton's vision full purpose it is essential they come together as
a Joint Committee.
The Forestry Commission, which still holds most of the land acquired
through National Land Fund procedures (fortunately, the National Trust
for Scotland bought Ben Lomond when the commission put the estate up for
sale), now has a difficult decision.
In the light of the purposes for which the land was bought should it
re-plant as much sitka? The Friends of Loch Lomond believe consideration
should be given to planting native species, enhancing the landscape, and
if necessary the commission should reconsult on its plans now that the
original aspirations for the land have been rediscovered.
The announcement of the Millennium Commission's support for the
creation of a native woodland on Loch Lomond's east shore, as part of
the Millennium Forest for Scotland, gives further purpose to radically
changing the Forestry Commission's re-planting plan.
The scenic importance of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs area has long
been recognised but the area lacks the cohesive planning and integrated
management which are appropriate to its national and international
status.
It is now time for all authorities to revive Dalton's ideals and put
them fully into practice.

Music
AT last the Paragon Ensemble got its act together at the opening
concert of the group's winter season last night. Year in year out the
group's performances are fractured by the furniture-moving between
numbers that require different instrumental formats. Masses of time is
lost, and continuity goes out the window.
Last night's solution was beautifully simple: three numbers in the
first half, each requiring different instrumental forces. So three
separate performing areas were laid out. Off went the first group to the
left, on came the second from the right. Of course it won't work out so
easily every time, but the difference in flow within the concert was
marked -- it actually brought a new strand of professionalism to the
proceedings.
The evening was improved even further by a stream of excellent pieces.
Ross Campbell's The Box, a clever piece for string quartet that drew its
materials from across the centuries, created a strange continuity by
cutting them short with almost filmic techniques, and slamming them hard
against each other. Very witty, very effective.
In Gordon McPherson's Impersonal Stereo, the composer took an
unusually ascetic stance (''clinical'', he called it), and produced a
wind quintet that was compelling in its rigour and objectivity.
James MacMillan was represented by two works, the splendidly performed
As Others See Us, and a fully choreographed version of his graphic
Exorcism of Rio Sumpul, in which dancers from the Southbrae Centre,
Woodlands Community Centre, and Whiteinch Primary School drew a telling
portrait of the incidents which inspired the piece: the chaos among
villagers suffering a military assault, the aftershock, and the
remarkable catharsis evoked by the village priest who released their
fear. First-class concert.

MICHAEL Fry's article supporting nuclear power should not go
unchallenged (October 4). In presenting his version of the truth on the
economics of nuclear power he is being economical with the truth
Nuclear power does not supply Scotland with cheap electricity.
Scottish Nuclear, in addition to a #1.36 billion Government debt
write-off in 1990, has received an above market price from Scottish
Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric for its output.
The real benefit to electricity consumers in Scotland comes from hydro
power which generates electricity at less than 1p per unit.
On the issue of safety, regulation of the nuclear industry is no
guarantee against human error as the recent prosecution of Nuclear
Electric over the dangerous operation of its Wylfa station showed.
Given the scope for using energy more efficiently and for renewable
forms of energy like wind, wave, and hydro power, there is no
justification for running the risks of nuclear power.

YOUR editorial (October 4) brings us back to what Tony Blair's pledge
to ''legislate for'' a Scottish parliament really means. This has been
interpreted by the Scottish quality newspapers and by BBC Scotland radio
news as the provision of a parliament within Labour's first year in
office.
Others have assumed its intention is limited only to the provision of
relevant legislation and the matter seemed settled when George Robertson
MP agreed with the latter (Letters, January 7, 1995).
It is probable that the expression was designed intentionally to mean
all things to all persons, namely a politician's fudge, but the public
looks to the media to expose and clarify political ambiguities.
So what does ''legislate for'' actually mean? Would a scribbled draft
on the back of an envelope suffice? Would Labour's Scotland and Wales
Bill, published in 1976 and thrown out by Parliament three months later,
have qualified? Does it include everything up to and including the Royal
Assent?
Or does it indeed, despite George Robertson, mean the actual creation
of a parliament as your editorial assumes?

YOU printed four letters from nationalist correspondents (October 4).
Two of them dealt directly with George Robertson's protest at the
failure of the SNP leadership to distance itself from the use of the
word ''traitor'' by their supporters with reference to their political
opponents.
It is regrettable that not one of them saw fit to take that step and,
in my view, until the SNP leadership does so the majority of Scots --
who do not support the SNP or independence -- are entitled to treat them
with suspicion.
Why is it that it is felt appropriate to characterise simple political
disagreement as equivalent to a betrayal of one's country? Are we to
expect some form of reckoning with these so-called ''traitors'' in a
post-independence Scotland?
I am sure I am not alone in viewing the failure of your correspondents
and their party to reject such language as a matter for dismay and,
perhaps, alarm.
Our country has a healthy democratic tradition. During the Thatcher
years one was able to discern in Scotland -- even among more thoughtful
Conservatives -- a real disgust at the suppression of dissent embarked
upon by that administration. Its successor has done little to improve
matters. The SNP would do well to consider whether the real betrayal of
Scotland and her traditions lies in the failure to allow room for other
views.
More political good manners and less name-calling would not go amiss.

I DON'T know if I'm being ultra-sensitive, but I often sense that the
media in England tend to make political capital out of the strangest
issues.
The coldest place in Britain last week was a place called Eskdalemuir,
and the newspapers and the BBC were not slow to tell the world what a
cold and miserable place Scotland is. There was, however, no mention
that the warmest place in Britain was Leuchars.
In fact, whether it's Thurso or Stranraer, Peebles or Wick, it's
always ''Scotland'' which is referred to as if all these places are
somehow joined together.
I know that for the ordinary English person, education is practically
non-existent, but the media certainly don't help with their geography
lessons.

THERE is little they can do but to keep smiling, hold heads high, and
pray earnestly that the albatross which has hung around Tory shoulders
for an age may decide to slip off for a paddle along Blackpool beach. We
would not bet on such a happy outcome, though, for what is clearly the
most important Tory Party conference in many years. The departure of
Alan Howarth to the Labour Party is an event which many Tories are
having difficulty in understanding. The internecine wars of recent
years, bad as they were on any scale of political conflict, had at least
the dubious significance of being kept within the family. Mr John
Redwood took his defeat well and stayed around to fight another day. The
crucial difference between Mr Redwood and Mr Howarth is that the
leadership challenger clearly believes he is on the ascendant wing of
the party, no matter how far right it may move. Mr Howarth, being of an
opposite temperament and political understanding, knows just as
certainly that his beliefs are redundant in modern conservatism. When
seen in this context his decision to go begins to be understandable. Mr
Howarth is simply saying what many have already said about the Tory
Party's lurch to the right. It is the overweening arrogance of the right
and the complacency of the leadership which have made his decision to
take action, rather than simply talking, seem so shocking.
All of this makes the task of even such experienced conference
manipulators as the Tory leadership that bit more difficult this week.
The success of the Labour Party conference has put pressure on Mr Major
and his colleagues to come up with something, if not as good, at least
as hearty and sustaining in Tory terms. The expectations of the party
around the country can hardly be misunderstood. The overwhelming
evidence of the motions submitted for the conference concentrate on the
need to cut taxes. For the less cerebral Tory back benchers this is a
simple and sufficient solution. Cut taxes, they say, and find the money
by much more stringent pruning of public expenditure. If this brings a
warm glow to hearts from Basildon to Brighton, they should pause and
think again. It is impossible to slash public spending without damaging
public services and further denting the way the electorate in general
views life and the Tory Party. It is impossible to believe that
Chancellor Clarke, just home from talking to IMF colleagues who take a
dim view of tax cutting, could agree to unrealistically large cuts in
direct tax.
What, then, can the Tories do this week? The key to it all is to look
busy. It would be fatal to counter Labour's moral vision by simply
attacking Mr Blair. Mr Mawhinney may be an accomplished assassin but to
have any chance of convincing the electorate of Tory credibility his
brutal skills must be accompanied by lively proposals. We can all guess
what some of them might be. Mr Howard may well be moved to consolidate
the suggestion of identity cards and new guidelines for tougher prison
sentencing: he may even be unwise enough to pluck the race card from his
sleeve. Mr Lilley, ably previewed yesterday by Mr Heseltine, will
announce crowd-pleasing attacks on social security fraudsters and
employment policy will also be gingered-up a little. Mr Portillo, we are
told, will remain quiet on Europe, though this is only to be expected
from a man who is anxious to appear loyal so that his chances of
leadership succession may be enhanced. Sir George Young, decent but
hapless as ever, will be forced to announce that rail privatisation must
not be postponed any longer. Yet the trouble with this is that, though
it may play well to the Tory Party, it is more of the same as far as the
electorate is concerned. Party conferences, even blighted ones, always
give an element of lift. The albatross may go for a paddle but rest
assured, come the opening of Parliament, he will be back.

I ATTENDED a performance of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe with
my two grandsons aged six and four years. The children sat spellbound
throughout as were all the children sitting nearby.
It was refreshing to see them looking and listening and obviously
enjoying the performance.
Although I agree with your critic regarding Lucy's inappropriate
dress, and the need for better stage maintenance, I felt he was
particularly harsh towards the company who played several parts.
Perhaps he needs to look at performances through the eyes of children

IN the light of juries, prejudice, and justice, has the time come to
consider other ways of assessing guilt or innocence in the courts?
Perhaps the use of a computer?
At least a computer is not influenced by religion, sex, race, colour,
politics, etc. Even more futuristic would be a built-in means of gauging
the reliability (truth-wise) of the evidence presented.
The success of the jury system is dependent on the integrity of those

Comedy
VIC and Bob last night behaved like Vic and Bob always do, ie in the
joyous manner of a pair of giddy 15-year-old schoolboys acting daft in
front of their bedroom mirror, making a mockery of the very worst of
British light-entertainment television over the past 30 years.
No-one dances as badly as Vic and Bob do, or with more brainless
gusto. The duo are unrivalled in the precious art of wringing mirth from
bad wigs, strained puns, hackneyed telly quiz-show conventions, and
3ft-long winklepicker shoes.
Aye, when it comes to singing calypsos which extol the worth of
cottage cheese, Vic and Bob are the business. Pretending to be afflicted
with magnetised gonads; hitting one another with outsize rubber frying
pans, hammers, garlic presses, cheese graters, and kettles . . . Tom and
Jerry meets Tom O'Connor and Jeremy Beadle: this is laddish surrealism,
and we like it like a fish likes a woman who needs a man who's
bicycle-shaped.
Charlie Chuck: do we like him? Yes. Not that he makes us laugh. A
Yorkshireman who affects mental illness in order to retell 25-year-old
jokes which first saw use on the long-lost workingmen's club circuit?
Ecologically sound, but not funny.
Vic and Bob are funniest when they slip into different characters. Fat
northern buffoons like Councillors Cox and Evans, or Mulligan and
O'Hare, the hormonally-confused singers of sentimental balladry.
But is there a danger of our becoming fed up with Vic and Bob acting
like Vic and Bob always do? Indubitably. And very soon. But not just
yet.

THE car bomb designed to assassinate the President of Macedonia, Mr
Kiro Grigorov, last Tuesday failed. Although elderly, he is 78, Mr
Grigorov survived but it is far from clear that he can continue to
execute the duties of his office and a new Presidential election is
likely. So far no-one has ''claimed responsibility'' for the bomb, and
no-one has suggested any culprits, though the idea that interests
outside Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic, were responsible has
been mentioned. Nobody knows. The neighbouring Greeks are hostile to
Macedonia and so are the Albanians, who form just over a quarter of the
population. It is hard to imagine governments conniving at anything akin
to assassination, but extremist bodies are another matter in a region
where ethnic tensions are exceptionally high and the ongoing Bosnian war
has always been thought capable of spreading into either Kosovo or
Macedonia.
The Greeks suspect that an independent Macedonia might develop
expansionist ambitions at their expense for their neighbouring region is
also called Macedonia and has a Macedonian minority as well as an
ancient Macedonian identity. It seems unlikely that historic
considerations would move the Yugoslav Macedonians to put any pressure
on the Greeks: the republic is too small for such dreams. The Greek
fears are unjustified, though they help to explain the strength of Greek
popular support for Serbia, and for the Bosnian Serbs. The Macedonians
for their part worry about the Albanians and the possibility that their
large Albanian minority could prove disloyal.  The possibility of a new
Presidential election gives the Macedonians a chance to woo the Albanian
minority by ending all the discrimination against it. Macedonians tend
to deny this discrimination and suggest that Albanians themselves create
their under-representation in higher education, for example, by
straightforward boycotts. this is where wooing is the right word.
Albanians need to be encouraged to participate in such institutions; and
they need to be granted the franchise in proportion to their numbers,
though the deficiency in that respect is not great. Albanians who are
just over a quarter of the population have about a sixth of the
parliamentary seats. It would be in everyone's interest to ensure that
any discrepancy there is not due to deliberate policy.
Possibly Macedonians are afraid to grant their Albanian minority the
fullest civil rights lest they simply press for union with Albania. That
risk has to be run. A generous policy at least cuts the ground from
beneath the feet of those Albanian extremists who insist that they are
victimised by social and civil exclusion, and so show no loyalty to
independent Macedonia. The fact is that all the Balkan states have large
minorities. Granting them rights is preferable to ethnic cleansing which
is what has disfigured the lands where Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian
Muslims previously coexisted in central Yugoslavia. The Macedonians will
benefit from a contented Albanian minority. Fortunately, the Greeks will
not interfere on the Albanians' behalf for they have their own
difficulties with Albanians in North-western Greece. And Albania itself
has, it would seem, sufficient problems of its own; but feelings of
political discrimination are a powerful solvent of many political
unions.

IT seems no time at all since I wandered through a quiet auditorium in
the heart of Glasgow and felt a quiver of excitement at the prospect of
what lay ahead.
Up to that point, the only sound to reverberate from the rafters of
this vast building was a symphony of tradesmen as they hammered together
the final fragments of what would soon become the Glasgow Royal Concert
Hall.
It had been a long time a-coming, ever since the great St Andrew's
Halls were burned down in 1962. But, 28 years later, it was on the verge
of reality and soon the artistic performers of the world would parade
once again before a West of Scotland audience.
Five years on and we have seen everything from the great orchestras
and operatic stars to the full range of popular favourites, from Neil
Sedaka and Howard Keel to Wayne Sleep, Daniel O'Donnell, and the Moody
Blues.
The truth of this splendid addition to the cultural life of Glasgow is
that it not only replaces the old concert hall but takes on part of the
mantle of the much-loved Empire Theatre. (Appropriately, for those who
have forgotten, it stands diagonally across the street from the site of
the Empire.)
So there, at the top of Buchanan Street, we have a treasure of
entertainment which celebrated its fifth anniversary last week in a
manner so enriching to our lives that it will be with us till the day
our souls depart.
There was, alas, an embarrassing side to it all; but let us
concentrate first on the undiluted joy.
I went along on Wednesday evening for the second of three concerts by
the great St Petersburg Philharmonic which was playing two of
Tchaikovsky's symphonies. It was such an overwhelming experience that I
turned about at the exit door and went back for the later concert, which
would give us two more.
As the great Temirkanov conducted his players to the final strains of
Tchaikovsky's Sixth, I was almost at the extreme of emotional tatters.
Then came the encore -- and that finally did it!
As those men and women from Tchaikovsky's home-town slid gracefully
into one of my favourite pieces I knew that I might never again hear it
in such perfection. Elgar's Nimrod had me on the edge of the seat,
absorbing every precious moment, wishing it would never end.
And when it did, I was roaring approval and applauding till the palms
stung red and raw.
Nor would you have been left in any doubt that our own Michael
Tumelty, who doesn't suffer mediocrity, was another man with tears on
his cheeks. It was that kind of night.
And as I looked at that orchestra, from one of the world's most
spectacular cities, it struck me that, somewhere within their vast and
brilliant ranks, must surely be a player whose grandfather was a
musician in St Petersburg in the lifetime of Tchaikovsky and would
likely have known him.
It was an intriguing thought. For this orchestra shared the composer's
background and played as if they knew precisely the fount of his
inspiration. They moved into their instruments with total sympathy.
In that Sixth Symphony in particular they conveyed the despair of his
last days. He lived only a week after its premiere in 1893, already well
under pressure, it seems, from the ''court-of-honour'' at the
Conservatory which decreed that the great man should commit suicide
before his association with a Russian aristocrat could disgrace then
all.
I thought back to that summer day this year when I stood by his grave
in St Petersburg and surveyed the bronze of his expressive face, feeling
grief for the bones which lay beneath me in that simple churchyard. He
was only 53, after all, and should have had another 30 years of plucking
that music from heaven and arranging it for our eternal delight.
Tchaikovsky, poor man, was dead; yet he lives for ever.
And that brings us to the embarrassment of last week. In a city not
slow to boast of its cultural image, how disgraceful that, with a
catchment area of two million people, it could not produce for the total
of those three performances a better-sized audience than would watch
Partick Thistle on a wet night. A very wet night.
As Michael Tumelty said, this famous orchestra did not deserve the
sight of a single vacant seat. Yet, on Wednesday evening, it faced the
discouragement of such blanks that you wouldn't blame them if they
didn't want to come back. It will be sad if Glasgow turns out to be not
quite the cultural place it likes to portray.
The actual fifth anniversary was marked with an operatic night in
which the fanfare was composed by Tommy Fowler, part-time doorman at the
concert hall, who has been studying music. Tommy was one of my
successors as the local reporter in Fraserburgh many years ago. Not bad
going for a Brocher!
A book on the First Five Years of the hall, by the way, is coming from
Ken Colville, who retired as its community affairs officer on Friday. It
rounds off a splendid five years for Ken as well as the hall. And all on
a week when the hairs of the neck were made to rise with one of music's
finest sounds.

EITHER by a stroke of inspired planning or more likely by mere
coincidence there is a full moon outside on the night Black Grape visit
Glasgow.
To any would-be moral guardians their hedonistic brew must be the
devil incarnate (even in their allegedly straight current condition), to
the neutral observer, Bez, the show's undoubted star, and his cohorts
are simply mad.
To the uninitiated Bez is Black Grape's utility man, a non-playing,
non-singing dancer whose movements and looks are not of this planet or
any other known to man.
However, he has much to dance to: away from the clowning around of his
fellow front men, the equally redundant rapper, Kermit, and Shaun Ryder,
the four real musicians in the background produce some serious grooves,
a measure of this being the way Shake Well Before Opening merges
seamlessly into the Gap band's Oops Upside Your Head.
They are equally at home on the hyper funk of Kelly's Heroes as they
are on more mellow workouts like Big Day in the North, bringing a
solidity to the proceedings, which in their notorious past would have
disintegrated into a wiped-out, spaced-out shambles.

WE have just had a Labour week of virtual reality based on the
assumption of virtual power. That is what a commanding lead in the
opinion polls gives you. This week, I suspect, we are going to have a
Tory week of reality. That is what actually being in power forces upon
you.
Mr Tony Blair offered us the earth with a bit of heaven thrown in. Mr
Major will eschew heaven and concentrate on delivering the earth which
looks as though it might include a free market from Leipzig to Los
Angeles. Their roles could be reversed in a General Election in 18
months or so.
Along comes Mr Alan Howarth MP, defecting straight from Tory to
Labour, as if to provide some flesh and blood to role reversal. Here we
have an erstwhile creature of Thatcherism turning to Blair, not because
Major has abandoned Thatcherism but because he still espouses some of
it.
It is not even as if his seat is an election loser; he has a 22,892
majority at Stratford-upon-Avon. If there could be anything more bizarre
than Mr Blair and Lord Tebbit shaking hands in consensus at a Labour
Party conference, it is the 51-year-old Howarth crossing the floor of
the Commons.
It may be only a one-week wonder, but it makes the likes of Arthur
Scargill weep. In his view it is not so much that Howarth has left the
Tories, but that Blair has joined them. Not for the first time, the
miners' leader has given the Tories their line.
Now that the Tories have ceased to vent their anger on themselves they
will turn it on Labour (coupled with the name of Howarth). Redwood and
Portillo will appear as icons of loyalty compared to him as the Tories
strive to match Labour in harmony. The defection may actually do Major
some good.
The first reality that Major should expound is that Europe should no
longer divide his party. The closer our partners look at the
practicalities of a single currency, the more the prospects of one
diminish and the better his Maastricht opt-out deal looks. He can even
quote Jacques Delors, so instrumental once in swinging a Labour
conference back into Europe, in aide.
The second reality, already observed by Chancellor Ken Clarke in this
newspaper and elsewhere, is the paramount need for economic probity. No
tax cuts (or significant tax breaks) until they are ''affordable''.
Having produced two recessions in the past 16 years, Major must convince
the electorate that there is not going to be another one if the Tories
should be re-elected.
Cuts in direct taxation should be placed firmly in the context that
they will be continuing, right into the next century, and not just
before General Elections. Labour told us nothing about taxation last
week that would match this commitment, even if 100 Tory MPs were about
to join them (which they are not).
There are a couple of realities to be going along with; the Tories
assembling at Blackpool today have many other problems of reality. There
is no point in spotting the realities if you are as incapable as they
have been over the past three years of presenting them.
All eyes fall on Michael Heseltine. Have his new titles of Deputy
Prime Minister and First Secretary of State made any difference to the
woeful state of affairs? Or were they concocted merely to enhance his
ego and keep him on side? This Tory conference needs to know the answer
to this by the evidence of their own eyes and ears.
Since July, the Prime Minister has been a good deal more relaxed and
self-assured, as well he might be having reasserted his leadership with
a bit of flair and courage. Imagine what this week's conference would
have been like, especially after Labour's success in Brighton, had he
allowed the leadership question to remain unresolved until November.
Behind the scenes, in the corridors of Whitehall and Central Office,
things have not been relaxed. Credit is given for a new sense of
direction and urgency to Heseltine. Co-ordination of Cabinet policy is
chaired by him and on this committee serve the key Ministers concerned
with Government business, plus the party chairman Brian Mawhinney.
From this committee, via the Prime Minister, issue demands on all
other Ministers to produce their ideas, their intentions to act, and the
timing thereof. Much effort in particular has been put into how the
Government is to use the party conference. Presentation will contain
plenty of hi-tech glitz, and Mawhinney will see to the attention to
detail. He is nothing if not methodical.
It is not just a matter of projecting the idea that Mr Major has
established a new grip on his Government. More important is to trump
Blair's cards in policy areas. Ministers are to administer a daily dose
of announcements, particularly on the key concerns of health, education,
social security, and law and order. They will be constrained somewhat by
the impending Budget statement next month. But, if they really know
where they are going there is the old political art of nods and winks to
hand.
Despite his evangelical triumph at Brighton, Mr Blair is still a
cautious man and he will be watching the opinion polls very closely in
the coming weeks. If the Tories can cut his lead to about 10%, they
reckon that they are in with a chance. Nothing would galvanise them
faster. Mr Blair's fear of complacency -- and it is not mere virtual
caution -- is based on the economic position.
Ministers believe that all the major indicators are in place to give
them an economic wellbeing that is pretty well unequalled since the war:
steady growth and inflation, increasing exports and investment, rising
consumption. Before long it could be the pound and not the franc that
rides with the D-mark.
The Labour leader realises that if the Tories can unite this week and
get all this across, they have the makings of another ''feel-good''
factor and another ''Don't Let Labour Ruin it''. He is also aware that
if the Tories can tip the opinion polls in the way they seek to do, his
party's unprecedented discipline might begin to crack.
Positive reality must be Mr Major's task and maybe his deliverance.

Jennifer Cunningham examines an occupational hazard that is claiming
an ever greater toll.
TODAY'S news that one-third of the workforce is putting in longer
hours and only half of them are getting paid for it confirms what the
country already knows and has been complaining about for a good half of
Mr Major's term of office.
The redundancies and cut-backs of the recession have produced a
workforce driven less by the desire to produce their best than by fear
of losing their jobs. The result is now being shown in increased
illness. Some would argue that the most serious sickness is the refusal
of managers, fearful of their own jobs, to acknowledge the cause and
effect.
When Britain's best-known occupational psychologist, Professor Cary
Cooper of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, warned that working longer hours increased significantly the
chances of having a heart attack in a booklet on stress he wrote for the
Department of Health, the Department decided not to distribute his work.
The decision has dismayed him, not because he has a political axe to
grind but precisely because it was intended as an apolitical help manual
for employers and the reference to hours of work was part of a synopsis
of possible factors.
The screening of tonight's television documentary on stress in the
wake of that row, is sheer coincidence. ''We've been working on it for
months and it is looking at all kinds of stress, not just in the
workplace,'' he said yesterday, determinedly unstressed about having his
weekend relaxation interrupted.
''The thing about stress-related illness is that it affects different
people in different ways. As far as hours of work go, I myself am not in
agreement with the European directive (for a 40-hour week). Stress-point
might be 48 hours for one person and 56 for another; it depends how
overloaded people are at work.
A survey carried out for the programme showed that 63% of the 1003
people surveyed felt under more stress at work than they did five years
ago. That should not surprise us, said Professor Cooper, because it is a
common perception. Indeed it is regularly backed up by surveys. Only
last month a seminar for Scottish businesses reported four million
working days a year lost through stress.
Cary Cooper's real concern is when stress is such that it begins to
cause illness. ''We are probably all genetically pre-disposed to one
illness or another. In some people it will be a heart attack, in others
it will be irritable bowel syndrome and in others mental breakdown.
''What we did in the booklet, which I understand will be published
although without the Department of Health's endorsement, is suggest that
employers have a look at what is going on in their organisation, by
doing some kind of audit.
The primary task is to find out what is wrong; the secondary one is to
do something about it and that could involve training managers to
recognise symptoms or to employ some outside counselling service, which
larger and even medium-size companies are doing more and more.
''I look at it this way: we are all a loaded gun and stress in life or
work can be the trigger. If we don't get the stressful situation or if
we manage it properly, then the trigger is not squeezed.''
The question for all of us -- employers, employees and the Department
of Health -- is how to keep fingers off the trigger.

GALLIPOLI by Michael Hickey, John Murray: #19.99
ONE of Winston Churchill's colleagues noticed his remarkable mental
fertility: ''He has 10 new ideas a day but only one of them is any
good.'' Identifying the good one was a guess, however. The Dardanelles
operation of the First World War was one of his ideas and it was a good
one, though it failed utterly in its execution and almost ended
Churchill's career: he was such a convenient scapegoat.
A malign aspect of the failure, the supposed careless use of the
Australian and New Zealand troops in the expedition, survives to damage
British relations with Australia even today.
Too much was probably hoped for from the project, though the concept
was sound enough. The narrow straits, the Dardanelles and the
Bosphorous, separating the Mediterranean and Black Seas, were to be
rushed by a purely naval task force which would have the twin effect of
overawing Constantinople so taking Turkey, a German ally, out of the
war, and opening permanent warm water communications with Russia.
The latter state enjoyed enormous potential but required allied help
particularly with military resources (especially shells), and needed a
route to export its huge grain surplus to finance its war effort.
Whether there would have been spare ammunition for the Russians is a
moot point given the Western allies' shortcomings in that very
commodity. Grain exports are another matter; and it might have been
easier to keep Russia in the war had there been direct access to its
southern provinces in 1917.
None of that came to pass. The rush was called off after the Turks'
land-based artillery proved too much for the fleet in March 1915.
(Churchill had earlier felt the purely naval option had run out by
1911.) Instead, a full-scale amphibious assault was planned for the
Gallipoli peninsula to take the forts from the land. Unfortunately, the
preliminary naval demonstration had advertised allied intentions but the
combined land and sea operation could not follow immediately (it began
the following month).
Moreover, the Turks, who were augmented by what would now be called
''advisers'' from the Imperial German Army, were able to frustrate the
whole enterprise by courage and clever tactics.
Colonel Hickey tells the story of the operation well, but it has been
told often before. He says a little more than usual about the Turkish
efforts, but hardly much more. There were several occasions when the
whole matter was in the balance, but the Turks proved able to tilt
things to their advantge, no matter how narrowly.
The main British failure was in leadership, though the whole
enterprise was inadequately planned. There were no good maps at the
start of the landings and later improvements were still deficient, a
vital shortcoming given the exceptionally difficult terrain. Units were
often sent straight into battle with only the most rudimentary orders
and no briefing as to what they might expect. Communications between
commanders at almost every level was always poor but often non-existent.
A sense of unjustified optimism tended to accompany all initial
reports and assessments of attacks, something which was combined by a
lack of despatch almost everywhere. Initial gains were seldom exploited
and it proved possible more than once or twice for small but determined
numbers of Turks to hold up vastly superior forces until their own
reinforcements arrived.
The British commander, Sir Ian Hamilton, was a good man with a sound
record but he proved at Gallipoli to have two deficiencies: he was
overawed by Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, and he was
too diffident in dealing with his own subordinates. In the first case he
was unable to ask Kitchener for the size of force really required to do
the job but put up with less than enough until near the very end of the
campaign when Kitchener anyhow refused the necessary reinforcements
Hamilton eventually requested.
In the second case, he let subordinates away with murder (almost in
the literal sense) and was reluctant to impose his orders on them or
sack them when they had conspicuously failed. He was too prone to
over-optimism himself and lent insufficient scepticism to their claims.
If Hamilton lacked what Monty called ''grip'', so did most of his senior
officers (and his own Chief of Staff was particularly baleful).
Officers only a little lower down were more able and enthusiastic
leaders but a combination of courage with stupidity subjected them to
disproportionately heavy casualties: they led from the front without
divesting themselves of the insignia of their rank so exposing
themselves to the ubiquitous Turkish snipers who were unusually
talented, and so destructive.
The landings themselves were seldom outstandingly successful but
Hickey notes how the generals tended to ignore those beach heads which
were ''winners'' and so reinforced failure instead. Again Hamilton, who
often saw clearly, found he could not impose his will, a fault
compounded by his not being on shore most of the time but on a warship
instead. Hickey notes, too, how his authority suffered from his not
being the unambiguous Commander in Chief, controlling the naval as well
as the military forces. By one of these ironies in which history abounds
the eventual evacuations across the beaches were thoroughly planned and
perfectly executed.
The generals misused their troops at Gallipoli much as they did on the
Western Front. No evidence exists that they were especially prodigal
with the Anzacs -- the corps formed by the Australian and New Zealand
formations. The Anzacs were certainly magnificent infantry, even winning
Turkish respect, which they reciprocated; but so were the 29th and 52nd
Divisions of the regular British Army. Hickey identifies other units
which performed exceptionally well. Had their been any evidence to
identify especial disregard of the Anzacs it would have been considered
here; but all the infantry was maltreated alike.
Hickey is right to give high marks to the Turks, who added great skill
with grenades to their sniping. He notices how the campaign ''made''
Mustapha Kemal who was not the only outstanding Turkish leader.
Generally, however, more attention needs to be devoted to the Turks who
won the campaign as well as the respect of their enemies who had been
previously inclined to underestimate them.
Gallipoli was as cruel a theatre as anything in the First World War.
Hickey is unusual in devoting much attention to medical provision which
improved from massively inadequate beginnings. His book is gripping,
though it might well be found disappointing by Antipodean readers who
could want even more to complain about than is available here.

Andy Murray examines how a pioneering bidder for a broadcasting
licence wants to revolutionise local radio in Scotland, letting it tune
into the world.
HE has rubbed shoulders with George Harrison, Charlie Chaplin, Joan
Baez and Rudolf Nureyev. He has made documentaries on the lives of Henry
Moore, Pablo Casals and Igor Stravinsky. He has worked with Eric
Clapton, Joe Cocker, Muddy Watters, Elton John, and Carlos Santana. Rex
Pyke's credentials are as impeccable as those of any London-based film
producer, writer or director, let alone one who has rusticated in
South-west Scotland for the past 10 years.
One of his favourite anecdotes originates from a television
documentary which he produced about his friend Van Morrison: ''Van used
to be a window cleaner and we tracked down Willie, someone he used to
work with in Belfast. Willie told us to tell Van that if he did not make
it in what he was doing there was always a job back with him.''
Despite Pyke's impressive background (he edited several major films
including Universal Soldier, he produced Channel 4's highly-acclaimed
Dream Ticket and Peter Hall's Akenfield which was praised by
international film critics), he asked not to be hoisted upon a pedestal
in his attempt to make Dumfries and Galloway famous throughout Britain
as the generator of a pioneering form of broadcasting.
Pyke's brainchild, D&amp;Gfm, is one of three contenders challenging South
West Sound, a subsidiary of Ayr-based West Sound Radio, for the
independent broadcasting licence in South-west Scotland.
While other stations keep their costs down by playing well-worn music
and phone-ins, D&amp;Gfm have told the Radio Authority they intend to use
the Internet as a low-cost method of programme acquisition and exchange.
The latest Internet audio-technology, Real Audio, enables conversations
worldwide once the link has been established.
''KFM in Kent have pioneered this method and are the most successful
station in the country. Within a month they had a year's projected
advertising revenue because they enfranchised the local community.
''Dumfries and Galloway was thought of as being grown-up enough to
have its own local radio, without having other regions' hand-me-downs
dumped on us.
''However, there are three transmitters in the region, other than the
one used by West Sound and the station has failed to use them; instead
they have creamed off the Dumfries area.''
Pyke, and his team, which includes Liz Niven, Dumfries and Galloway's
Scots language development officer, dream of setting up a worldwide
Internet alliance of local broadcasters.
He plans to link local fishermen live with their counterparts in, say,
Nova Scotia. He also means to make his own programmes for syndication on
the Internet.
''A vast range of human-interest stories will be brought to our
listeners by eavesdropping on other communities around the world,'' Pyke
says.
''There is hardly a family here which does not have friends or
relatives in Australia, New Zealand, Africa, or Canada. Our Internet
alliance could be used as a new Family Favourites, but with people
talking to each other as well as having birthday record requests.''
Pyke may be English, but he abhors the status quo of Carlisle-based
Border Television ministering to the televisual needs of people in
Lowland Scotland. He is also dismissive of CFM Carlisle, one of his
rivals in what he calls ''the David and Goliath struggle for a
licence''.
''We are being commercially and culturally colonised by broadcasters
established in Ayr, Carlisle and Glasgow. To them it is just building up
their portfolios.''
Despite Pyke's good-humoured pugnaciousness and his track record, he
is less than optimistic that the Radio Authority will award D&amp;Gfm a
licence to broadcast from 1997 until 2005.
''The Radio Authority will probably go for one of the other
contenders, Glasgow-based Solway Sound, 97.5% of which is owned outwith
the region.''

THE Scottish National Party yesterday accused the Government of
misusing public money for political ends in publishing revenue and
expenditure figures for Scotland.
SNP Treasury spokesman John Swinney said the figures, due out today,
would be as credible as the monthly jobless figures, which no-one
believed any more.
''The Tories have instructed civil servants to change the method of
counting unemployment 30 times and they will have similarly fiddled the
Scottish budget figures. This is a politically-driven exercise, with
politically-directed conclusions,'' he said.
''If Michael Forsyth want to publish Tory figures running down
Scotland, then he should get Tory researchers to do it, not civil
servants. The Tories are cooking the books at public expense.''
Mr Swinney said former Scottish Secretary Ian Lang failed in 1992 to
pretend that income and spending figures collated by civil servants were
objective statements when, in fact, they were simply a political stunt.
He said correspondence indicated that the Prime Minister and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer both had reservations over this approach.
''The SNP demonstrated last month that Scotland more than pays her
way, with a #200m surplus relative to the UK in the current financial
year,'' Mr Swinney told an SNP meeting in Newton Stewart.
''The Scottish people know that not only can Scotland easily afford
independence, but would be better off with it.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said there would an official announcement
today. ''For obvious reasons, we cannot make any comment on something
which is not yet in the public domain,'' he added.

YOU have to feel a pang for Campbell Christie do you not? In the space
of one short week the generary secretary of the STUC has been labelled a
potential villain by the leader of the Labour Party, and a would-be hero
by the Tory Secretary of State for Scotland. It's the kind of
embarrassment to have a man three putting all the way round the Sunday
fourball.
First then, let us examine his apparent crimes. Mr Christie and his
council have pronounced themselves unhappy with the deal on numbers for
the first Scottish parliament on the general grounds that the figure is
too small and the more particular one that they make gender parity
difficult to achieve.
No sooner was the council's verdict relayed to the people's party in
Brighton than Mr Christie became the subject of some high-level
vilification.
George Robertson could scarcely comment to BBC's finest so firmly
gritted were his teeth, while Tony Blair was prevailed upon to advise
the nation that the STUC could think what it pleased but had no
authority to decide on the composition of the parliament.
Lesser luminaries were then unleashed from the spin doctors' holding
pen to peddle the line that only fools and dinosaurs would dream of
messing up on a plan six years in the building and a few short weeks
from formal presentation to the Scottish masses.
Conveniently forgotten in this version was the pivotal role the STUC
has played these many months and years helping to keep the devolution
show on the road through many bouts of indifference bordering on apathy
punctuated by occasional glimpses of sheer hostility from the Labour
Party in the south. Forgotten, too, was the fact that the fact that
progress had been apparently so painstakingly slow was not down to any
lack of intellectual rigour on the part of the conventioneers, but
rather a determination, most uncommon in the political classes, to move
forward on each stage only when genuine consensus had been reached.
Mr Blair is right; it is not just down to the STUC to decide. Neither
is it down the leadership of the Labour Party except in the technical
sense that a Labour government could legislate as it saw fit.
But if it did so in a way that made significant numbers of the
convention partners unhappy then it would be totally at odds with the
spirit in which this grand adventure has so far been undertaken.
Who would have thought at the start that the Labour Party in Scotland
would go along with a deal which was bound to cut its own representation
in order to make the first parliament at least partly proportional? That
was a very real sacrifice. Who would have thought the the Lib Dems would
have agreed the method of PR to be adopted when it differed from its own
preferred strategy? That was very real compromise.
And you could, of course, go on to argue that in splitting the
difference between the number of seats they both wanted, George
Robertson and Jim Wallace displayed real statesmanship.
But just because we are in sight of the finishing tape doesn't mean we
should sprint unthinkingly past very real obstacles. Deadlines like St
Andrew's Day are very useful for concentrating minds. They can also be
tyrannical.
If the evidence of Westminister is anything to go by it is absolutely
crucial that the initial parliament is as logical and representative and
equitable a body as it is possible to devise. It has to be large enough
to have muscle and significance and to redress the ludicrous gender
imbalance of the UK chamber. And if you fondly imagine that is an issue
which can be attended to later, remember that the move to all-women
short leets for selection moved off the national political agenda so
fast you didn't dare blink in case you missed the revolution.
The first Scottish parliament has to be constructed so that our
brightest and best of both sexes are attracted; so that our young people
are not blocked by clapped-out councillors manipulating their party
selection systems; so that knee-jerk hostilities are replaced with
intelligent debate and we don't wake up of a morning to a routine
slagging match on parliamentary reports; so that many intelligent Scots
who have been well and truly scunnered by party politics may be
encouraged to look afresh at the prospect of standing for election.
And if we haven't quite got the mechanics right to service that vision
then it's no great folly to sit down again and talk it through. That's
not spoiling tactics; that's common sense.
Now that the Lib Dems have endorsed the 129 deal the pressure on Mr
Christie will doubtless intensify. Happily he is not a chap easily
pushed about.
Which brings us to his second incarnation in the week's headlines. In
his latest newspaper interview -- and Mr Forsyth seems intent on
bestowing one a week till the ink runs dry -- the Scottish Secretary
talked of his plans for beefing up the moribund Scottish Economic
Council and turning it into the sort of quango which might serve as a
fig leaf to cover the embarrassment of a party going into the next
election offering nothing more electorally stimulating than the status
quo. As a response to Scotland's aspirations to run its own affairs it
is, of course, a total non-starter.
But the fascinating sentence in the interview is the one attributing
the initial idea to Campbell Christie. I suspect this is being more than
a little economical with the actualite. A suggestion to beef-up an
existing talking shop to give people like the trade unions more input
into Scottish Office deliberations is unremarkable.
That this would be instead of a directly elected parliament is not the
kind of policy likely to have Mr Christie's fingerprints anyway near it.
Ah well. Tories with big majorities rushing to embrace Mr Blair.
Tories with very small majorities rushing to embrace Mr Christie. Funny
old game, politics.

AFTER travelling on the Brussels-Berlin train I shall think twice
about kicking British Rail, or whatever this week's name for our railway
system is, when it's down.
It seemed a good idea to let the train take the strain mainly because
the airlines wanted #600 for the flip from Belgium to Germany unless I
stayed over a Saturday, which I could not, in which case the price would
have been #200. Businessmen with fat expense accounts are plentiful in
midweek but the seats go empty at weekends, hence the huge difference.
This is exactly the kind of thing the EU is trying to stamp out. Its
open skies policy aims to make air travel cheaper for all. Resistance is
all around and particularly strong in Britain where our Government's
proclaimed policy of breaking monopolies by privatisation has led to
higher fares. You can fly to the American west coast more cheaply from
Glasgow than to Paris or Brussels these days.
The overnight train to Berlin sets off from Ostende but picks up most
of its passengers in Brussels. By the time I was booked the beds were
all gone and only a couchette was available.
This was my introduction to a distinctively continental style of
travel. It requires six strangers to share a cabin in bunks which are
not so much beds, more a shelving unit. Three bunks, one above the
other, on either wall -- and guess who got the top one?
Clambering into a couchette is like doing contortions while
pot-holing. And there was no breakfast, only a cup of lemon tea for
#2.50. Sanitary arrangements were unspeakable.
It surprises me that continentals still put up with this sort of
thing. Presumably they do so because it is cheap -- just over #100
return -- which explains why most of my companions were students and
back-packers.
Only the French in my experience have outstandingly good trains.
Elsewhere rail travel is mostly uncomfortable and slow.
Speed the day when the EU's big cross-border transport plans come to
fruition -- but by that time I suspect we shall all be long gone.
And so, with backache, to Berlin and last week's fifth anniversary of
unification. The first person I bumped into was none other than our own
William Russell, diplomatic correspondent of this paper, who vouchsafed
with a smile that he had once been a guard on the East German border in
his days as a trained killer doing national service.
The very idea of Oor Willie guarding Germans must explain why the Wall
came down so quickly. Nowadays he swops his helmet for his film critic's
hat and goes back to Berlin regularly for the film festival.
We agreed that the atmosphere of Berlin which once made it a city like
no other has gone -- disappeared with communism's defeat and the tension
which the Cold War pressed on a divided community. Berlin was never a
glamorous place after the war but it had an air of sharp suspense which
made it seductive and exciting. Now the distinctiveness is lost and
Berlin is just another big town but one with a new sense of purpose in
unified Germany.
Someone once told me in the Berlin of the 1970s that the safest place
to be when the Third World War broke out would be below the Brandenburg
Gate. Well, when Bill Russell got to the spot last week there was a pipe
band there playing Scotland the Brave.
The Kurfurstendamm still offers Versace, Yves St Laurent, and
Jean-Paul Gaultier at rip-off prices but a grander style is now being
rediscovered in former East Berlin where wonderful old buildings are
being restored after communism's neglect. West Berlin's glitter has also
been dulled by the absorption of the city's eastern poor.
But even in its struggle to meet the cost of unification the signs of
underlying German economic power are all around. Berlin's streets are
jammed with German cars. You will search long enough for a Rover or
Jaguar. Even Toyotas and Hondas are scarce compared with other European
countries.
The Germans, you see, still make things, and buy their own work.
Despite their strong currency -- or perhaps even because of its
trustworthiness -- they sell to people like us. In return we now receive
a paltry DM 2.20 for our shrunken pound.
Germans would never have permitted the destruction of their industry,
the lifeblood of their nation, in the belief that the service sector
would be an adequate replacement.
For Britain in Europe it's a lesson too late for the learning.

Julia Langdon considers a young Tory Turk to be an apt subject for an
earnest author embarking on his first biography.
WHOEVER it was who opined that there was no such thing as bad
publicity was not thinking about politics at the time. The latest
unauthorised biography of Michael Portillo, written by a young Scot, is
all about ambition: Michael Portillo's personal ambition; his political
aspirations for Britain; and also the hopes of the Conservative
right-wing for the future of our politics.
These are serious matters and it would obviously be high ly
regrettable for Mr Portillo if his chances of fulfilling his promised
political potential were to be put at risk by injudicious publicity. He
is, after all, still a very young man, only 42; isn't the book, The
Future of the Right, rather a precocious idea, still really much too
early? The reason for it lies not with Michael Portillo, however, who
did not hamper the researches of the author but made plain that he would
have preferred the book not to have been written, but in the efforts and
interests of that author. Michael Gove is another clever and ambitious
young man in a hurry.
He is a 28-year-old Scottish journalist, earnest and serious-minded
and himself immensely interested in politics and the sub-text of the
sub-title.
He wrote the book because two of his BBC colleagues were engaged in
writing biographies of Tony Blair and the idea of doing something
similar appealed to him. His working schedule, as a reporter on the
early-morning Radio Four Today programme, was also sufficiently flexible
to provide the time. And Michael Gove is clearly a pragmatist, too: it
occurred to him that it would be as well to write a book ''while I'm
still young and unmarried''; although he does not say so, he no doubt
also calculated that it would be helpful to his own future.
He claims to have arrived at the choice of Michael Portillo as a
subject by means of a process of elimination. There was no-one else in
the Labour Party he could imagine as a suitable case for biography.
Gordon Brown? John Prescott? It would be too early to assess them, he
says. The Defence Secretary was an obvious choice, however, not least
because Michael Gove admires him. He acknowledges: ''Anyone reading the
book could probably discern my views about politics and various
individuals.'' This is true.
He is anxious to emphasise that he is not a member of any political
party and although he is identified by some on the fashionable
intellectual right as one of their number, he himself insists that this
emphatically does not mean that he has plans to become an MP. He prefers
being a journalist, if only for the interim. He hit on the idea in his
final year at Oxford.
''It struck me that journalism would be the most fun way to fill up my
time until I decided what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.'' He
is something of an ageist, this young Gove, talking a great deal about
the cult of youth.
''In journalism in general and the BBC in particular, there are very
few people who are still there after the age of 40,'' he says airily, an
observation which will come as something of a surprise to many
journalists and broadcasters. ''For that reason you can't be certain
that you can stay in the same job. I'm a member of a generation that
realises you're probably never likely to be in the same profession for
the rest of your life and you're going to have to change.''
He was born in Edinburgh, the son of a fish merchant, and brought up
and educated in Aberdeen. He went to Robert Gordon's College and then
read English at Lady Margaret Hall. He chose a women's college,
correctly assessing that his application would enhance his chance of a
place because the principal was seeking more men students. ''I was a
beneficiary of positive discrimination in reverse.'' He enjoyed the
college and Oxford and became president of the Union.
When he came down, he did a bit of shift-work on the diary of the
Daily Telegraph, worked for the Press and Journal in Aberdeen and then
joined Scottish Television as a researcher before signing up with the
BBC. It is politics, though, that fascinates him. His family are not in
the least involved in politics, but he became interested in the subject
during the course of the protracted debate about devolution when he was
a schoolboy in the 1970s. As well as issues, he is interested in
personalities and the importance of gossip and the soap opera aspect of
our political life.
He engaged in a great deal of gossip as well as more profound
political research for his book. It is workmanlike. He covers the
ground. His style is somewhat clumsy and one longs for him to have a
glance at Flann O'Brien's Catechism of Cliche to know what to avoid. But
the story of Michael Portillo's life is frankly told and there is much
solid material there that will doubtless be useful to later biographers
when the clouds at present obscuring the possible future of the Tory
Party have cleared.
We do not know what will happen with Michael Portillo. The
Conservative Party's next choice of leader will depend not so much on
the candidates available, but on their electoral fortunes, on what
happens next. Michael Gove believes that if the Conservatives do not
lose badly at the next election, or possibly even win, the exotic,
adventurous choice of Michael Portillo as a successor to John Major
would be enhanced. But this option is not one greatly favoured at
present.
It is all too early to tell. All one can surmise is that the
brilliance that Michael Portillo radiates for the right wing of his
party is not such as might fade into obscurity in any imaginable
circumstances.

JUBA: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, was given a
tumultuous welcome by thousands of Christians in Sudan's war-ravaged
south yesterday and later made an appeal for peace in an address to
50,000 people. Dr Carey urged the strongly Islamic government and the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army to end the civil war which has torn
the country apart since 1983.
His last visit to Sudan in 1993 caused a diplomatic row which led
Britain and Sudan to expel their ambassadors. He went to rebel areas of
the south and left the capital, Khartoum, off his itinerary.

THE moral establishment equates pornography with sexual violence. So
much so, that a sex offender is shown pornography as a test to determine
whether he will reoffend. The integrity of this link is in some doubt,
because the Prison Reform Trust recently demanded that the ''penile
plethysmograph'' test be reviewed. Their spokesman Andrew Groves
explains: ''The PRT feel that insufficient research has been conducted
into links between pornography and acts of sexual violence. (It) has not
found conclusive evidence that the PPG test is an effective predictor of
the future behaviour of convicted sexual offenders.''
The test dictates that an offender is shown contrasting images of sex,
including seductive pictures of children and/or audio tapes where the
noise of heterosexual sex is contrasted with the sounds of rape. The
contrast is important. Arousal is interpreted as the desire to commit
the particular act which excites. But this is where the test fails. Not
all those who have rape fantasies, either as victim or perpetrator,
would submit to them in real life. Pornography then, surely, does not
determine what makes one man's fantasy another man's crime.
People who buy porn often do so because it is a substitute for what
they cannot or will not do in reality. But sex offenders who are found
with a store of pornographic material in their homes have taken out
their fantasies on other people. No-one knows what finally makes a
person cross the line.
In some way, however, porn is still regarded as aiding and abetting
sex crime. Reduce British society's stance on pornography and you are
left with the cliched conundrum about beginnings: which came first, the
chicken or the egg, the crime or the craving? There is no evidence to
back-up censorship, and there is no reason to believe that pornography
bridges the gap between thinking about assault and conducting it.
Pornography, here, is viewed as a vile threat, a corrupting force, but
under British law all that can be showcased is the merest hint that
normal, heterosexual intercourse might take place. In essence, no more
slutty and loose than a singles night at the local meatmarket.
''Europe call soft what we call normal heterosexual hardcore, which is
two people, a male and female, having intercourse. Hardcore in Europe is
group sex and anal sex,'' says Lionel Darling, 42, an English freelance
hardcore porn director who, for that reason, works mostly in Germany. He
explains that what passed as softcore porn 10 years ago is now classed
as hardcore.
''This country is the most censored in the world. Porn is a
multi-million pound industry and we're losing money. The real change
came last November with the Criminal Justice Bill. Tony Blair sending a
note to John Major, saying that the only thing he agreed with was his
stand against pornography.
''I have a letter from the British Film Board of Classification. It
says: ''After 23 minutes remove any clues that sexual intercourse may
take place''. The remit from the Government is to let the tapes go for
the big build-up, then cut.''
If this is the case, then soft pornography is more likely to patronise
or frustrate. Which is probably why most British consumers of porn buy
hardcore, illegally, from Europe. ''A massive number of people in
Britain consume pornography. They get it by mail-order based in
Holland.''
Lionel goes on to compare the censorship of sex in Britain to that
dictated by Islam in Iran, Iraq, and the Middle East. There is no
British porn industry as such, only a seedy subculture of prostitution,
where a woman is often first violated by her father, then her pimp, then
by men who can pay. Pornography is pure Disney compared with exchanges
made on the streets. Europeans and Americans have video-cassette
theatre, rampant displays of appetites and positions for both sexes. The
titillation made here on film is for men, closet schoolboys, of a tragic
and pitiful calibre, probably more suited to inadequates. And against
this, some might say, hypocritical backdrop, pedlars of soft and
hardcore porn are jailed. Perhaps rightly so. Perhaps not.
''I sold seven hardcore tapes to an undercover police officer who had
been trailing me for four years,'' Lionel said. ''I got nine months for
it. I could have gone to the pub and stabbed three people for that.
There was a guy inside the same time as me who'd done the DSS out of
#360,000 over six years and got nine months, and a guy who'd committed
39 burglaries and got nine months. I've been making porn for 15 years
now and I don't care anymore. We've lost the battle against censorship.
If a member of the public was caught sending pornography out the
country, they would be arrested.''
Members of the public, in fact, regardless of the risks involved, not
only buy but sell hard pornography abroad. What is significant about
censorship and the softporn peddled in this country is that it does not
preclude ordinary citizens from producing their own video porn and
exporting it abroad for money.
We've had This Is Your Life, an innocuous TV show designed to showcase
emotion and celebrity friendship. Now we have This Is Your Sex Life, a
British cottage industry where men and women video their bedroom
shenanigans for public consumption.
Amateur Video is one of many top-shelf titles distributed by Northern
and Shell PLC, including flagship Penthouse magazine, Real Wives and New
Talent. Editor Ric Porter, 38, a former adult model and director of
pornographic videos, has the credential of being approached for advice
by the recently launched satellite station, TVX, The Fantasy Channel.
His #4.95 magazine is six issues old and includes a 30-minute
cover-mounted video, for which readers are paid #20 per minute of
footage used.
Prostitution is the use of an anonymous body for sex. Pornography is
the use of an anonymous image. But men or women are not featured, it is
alleged, in these home-made videos with a client, but with the boyfriend
or wife. The magazine, by punting visions of a suburban sexual paradise,
fuel the fantasy that all sexual intercourse between a man and a woman
is pure Hollywood. This is the world of the George and Lynne cartoon in
The Sun. Abandoned, uninhibited, naked, erect, and free. The incentive
for readers' to contribute is, as the magazine manipulates, the fact
that ''in a recession, this offers a very useful opportunity to earn
extra cash''.
There will always be men willing to pay to see naked women, and in
this way, British porn, because it is male-orientated, is supremely
exploitative in the economic sense, and marginally in terms of morality.
In pornography for men, it's important to see everything, because every
woman is different. Put crudely, in porn a woman's individuality is
established by the shape of her nipples or pubic hair. In pornography
for women, such as magazines as Women Only, men are artfully posed
against moody landscapes, in designer boxer shorts. Sexual pornography
is a science for men, a doctor's appraisal of the female form. For women
it's a mere pitstop in an unfolding drama.
Ric Porter edits the videos that are provided with each magazine issue
himself. Does dealing constantly with the nude and lewd take its toll?
''When I worked in video production, I mixed with a lot of hardcore
porn actresses, and it's like working with prostitutes. My attitude to
sex changed. I became almost celibate. I didn't get turned off by it,
but because it was my work I wanted to go home and do something else.
Now I get sent videos and edit them together, and I'm removed from the
actual point of contact.
''I find my job stimulating, I've no problem with it, but I did at one
point. If you see someone take their clothes off for the camera and
they've never done it before, you are very aware that they are sharing
something that's very personal to them. It teaches you to be diplomatic,
which is contradictory to what people might think of those involved in
the adult porn industry. I'm not a cigar-chomping, uncaring, rich
bastard. If anything, I think making pornography teaches you to be more
aware of other people's feelings.''

Calum MacDonald and Craig Watson investigate the background to the
alarming outbreak of incendiary devices being washed up on Scotland's
shores.
THE mystery of the munitions from the deep remained unsolved last
night, but there were clear signs that the political fall-out could
eventually resemble the potent effect of water on phosphorous.
Some of the main players in what may become a full-blown environmental
cause celebre were beginning to ignite yesterday.
At Clyde Coastguard's HQ, a spokesman admitted that the munitions
involved could kill, but said he could not speculate on the precise
source of the devices. In any case, the first priority was to help the
police and Royal Navy bomb disposal experts clean up affected areas.
However, he pointed out that prevailing tidal patterns in the
Beaufort's Dyke area were south-easterly, which would take any flotsam
away from Scottish waters. In addition, beaches at Girvan and
Portpatrick had not been affected, as would have been expected if the
devices came from the controversial explosives dumping ground between
Stranraer and Belfast.
A more likely source, said the spokesman, was a dump east of Arran,
although no confirmation was possible at this stage. The strong tides
and powerful winds typical at this time of year could have swept the
weapons towards the north Ayrshire coast.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research for Friends of the Earth Scotland,
said the outpourings from any arms dump in the Irish Sea could easily be
''the next Brent Spar''.
He claimed that the most likely trigger for the release of the
phosphorous sticks was contractors employed by British Gas, preparing
for the company's interconnector pipeline between Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
British Gas last night rebutted this suggestion, stating that its
subsidiary company, Premier Transco, was working with approval from the
Department of Trade and Industry, and well away from known munitions
dumps.
However, Dr Dixon said it was also possible -- and a ''much more
alarming'' theory -- that an underwater container had simply broken open
from a dump such as Beaufort's Dyke, and was spewing its dangerous
contents into the sea.
He said: ''At the end of the Second World War, things like German
nerve gas canisters were being disposed of as quickly as possible, and
it appears that full records were never kept.
''It is also possible that some of the munitions did not actually go
into the dump itself, but were left nearby. It's yet another example of
the old thinking that the sea is a great dumping ground.''
Dr Dixon said many fishermen, who were forced to trawl at deeper
levels because of a strict quota system, had pulled up old weaponry from
the sea bed in their nets.
''Apart from the munitions, radioactive waste can be very mobile if
its casing corrodes, which is also pretty alarming. We will be pressing
for an immediate inspection of all dumps, which would allow the
appropriate agencies to make an informed decision on what to do with
their contents.''
Government representatives from the Scottish Office, Ministry of
Defence and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were not
prepared yesterday to shoulder responsibility for undertaking an
underwater investigation, although an MAFF spokeswoman said a routine
check of Beaufort's Dyke was due to be carried out next year.
A counterpart at the MoD was slightly more cynical. ''I think certain
people are secretly hoping the devices did come from the Dyke, because
that's where the recent arguments have been focused.'' MoD scientists,
working from a base at Faslane, have been examining the mystery devices
to discover their type and origin.
Cunninghame North MP Brian Wilson said yesterday, on behalf of himself
and neighbouring Labour colleague George Foulkes: ''We are asking for a
joint meeting with Defence Secretary Michael Portillo.
''We want a full investigation into the source of these incendiaries,
and also want a far-reaching survey to identify as far as possible what
is in the Channel between Ulster and Scotland and in the Firth of Clyde.
''In the meantime, we both believe it is crazy to disturb areas of the
seabed where it is known munitions lie, and we want this to stop
happening while that investigation goes ahead.''
Mr Wilson said it was mostly his constituency which had been affected
this time, although ''the shores of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley
constituency have been the scene of regular, if less spectacular,
landings of munitions over a long period. The fear is that there may be
a lot worse out there, and no risks must be taken.''
Police and bomb squad officers involved in the weekend clear-up
admitted the scale of the incident had taken them by surprise.
The head of the Faslane bomb disposal team said it had been a ''quite
extraordinary'' exercise given the number of devices involved. He said:
''From time to time the fishing community trawl up Second World War
landmines or torpedo parts but we have never dealt with anything like
this.''
Several squads have been sweeping the coastline between Largs and
Stevenston searching for devices. The disposal experts carefully remove
the toxic cannisters and store them in a container filled with water. A
council tractor trailed along the beach yesterday, picking up buckets
full of devices and taking them to a secluded area near Stevenston for
incineration.
The devices, which are roughly the size and shape of paint rollers,
appear to be made of a petroleum gel which may include phosphorous. They
would originally have been contained in a metal casing, which has eroded
over the years. They have consistently been described as flares but they
are more likely to be incendiary bombs, it is believed.
They are relatively harmless if damp but can burn the skin or
spontaneously ignite if they dry out, as has happened to dozens over the
past few days. The bomb squad leader said members of the public should
be extremely careful if they find any cylinders, notifying the police or
coastguard immediately.
But the people of north Ayrshire are more concerned about the
long-term effects of washed-up munitions. There has been a relatively
high concentration of devices (about 350) around Stevenston and
Saltcoats. A similar quantity was discovered on Arran at Kildonan. Up to
900 had been discovered in total by last night.

In the so-called caring nineties, pornography has spread throughout
the nation. Beginning a challenging new series, Stephen McGinty and
Anvar Khan investigate the nature of the beast -- and look at the battle
being waged to control it
TO reach Wonderland, Alice went through a little door on the side of a
hill. Another door exists in the pages of top-shelf men's magazines,
through advertisements, to a dark landscape of suburban living rooms,
hand-held cameras and crime. This is no wonderland. Here Alice is
routinely raped, beaten and abused.
Who could watch this and, worse, why would anyone take part? For as
little as #20 -- including post and packaging -- men can witness a
crime.
Illegal pornography in the nineties has quietly, insidiously spread
throughout Britain, attracting tabloid bluster yet little analysis.
Holland and Germany have been held up as the Sodom and Gomorrah of
Europe. Twin pillars propping up an industry based on the exploitation
and abuse of women. But in the past few years Britain has begun its own
distressing trade in the filmed sexual and physical abuse of women, plus
boys and girls as young as five.
And these films are distributed not in dozens, nor hundreds, but
thousands.
In October 1993, Prime Minister John Major branded pornography a
''loathsome trade'', making a solemn promise to fight it. Every force
with responsibility in this area is seriously undermanned, swamped in
work. In London, the Obscene Publications Squad's intelligence database
has 4000 names of men waiting to be investigated for activities linked
directly to child pornography. The squad has 17 officers.
Exactly two years after Mr Major's speech, an Edinburgh man will
appear in court later this month charged with the sexual abuse of young
boys during the filming of pornographic videos. In Strathclyde three
years ago, between 80 and 90 children from the area were abused in films
made by Francis Curran, a paedophile who was sentenced to 14 years'
prison.
Hard-core pornography slips easily across a border and Scotland is no
exception.
A torture chamber exists in the Ibrox area of Glasgow. And police have
seen its work. A needle slowly being pushed through a woman's breast.
Chains, beatings. Hooks and nails driven through a man's genitalia into
a plank of wood. All captured on the video film of sadomasochists. As a
result of the same inquiry into the Strathclyde abuse, a large number of
videos were withdrawn from Glasgow and an Edinburgh address, but were
then returned.
There was no proof of forced involvement or intent to sell. They were
the antics of consenting adults. A joint operation, between Strathclyde
and the Lothian and Border's police, raided the premises after a tip-off
that child porn was being produced; but no evidence was found.
That is the dark side. But hard-core pornography between consenting
adults of a German, Dutch or American background is available, for a
price. Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen. Each city has its
suppliers, a network of enthusiasts for the spicier European titles.
In Edinburgh, a van used to drive around industrial estates offering
office workers the chance to book an evening of Debbie Does Dallas. A
small secondhand book store still deals in caning magazines. In Glasgow,
it's #35 to purchase each tape near the Gallowgate, a tenner to trade it
for the next.
Clandestine contacts in Aberdeen continue to supply off-shore oilmen
with a range of extremely graphic tapes, despite the busting of a local
bookshop owner who received a #1350 fine from Trading Standards for
supplying unclassified material.
For 15 years, Raymond Stern operated a pornography dealership from
Dundee in which millions were estimated to pass through the accounts.
More than 18,000 people throughout Britain purchased videos from a
400-tape library of violent, deeply misogynous material which was
smuggled into Britain and wound on to mainframe computer reels. In
August 1988, Stern was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
But, despite the clean-up operations, the industry has continued to
grow.
A similar distribution system is still widely used by UK pornography
dealers. A contact in Amsterdam or Germany brings master tapes into the
country by car, or concealed in mail to a distribution centre; linked
video machines make copies which are distributed from within Britain.
Today, Dutch dealers hire English receptionists to take credit-card
orders and guarantee delivery seven days later.
Police say pornography is not a big problem. It is not like drugs or
violent crime. ''It is not that it does not exist, but that we do not
have any great evidence of it,'' said Chief Inspector John Fleming, of
Strathclyde Police.
However, by its very nature it is almost undetectable. ''It's very
difficult to police. The type of people who view this material and who
trade in it are not likely to inform the police.''
There is no law in Britain against pornography. In Scotland, such
material is prosecuted under the description: obscene matter through
Section 51 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.
This makes it an offence to display such material in a public place.
It also prohibits the sale, distribution and possession of material
which is likely to deprave and corrupt those who are likely to read it.
A troika of bodies are involved in prosecuting distributors. Police
forces work closely with officers of Customs and Excise and also Trading
Standards. Customs is the first barrier to be breached. Staff cuts
prevent extensive searches.
In 1993-94, seizures of pornography in Scotland numbered 109. For the
year 1994 to 1995, the figure fell to 70.
''To give you an idea of what we are dealing with, the duty-free shop
at Amsterdam airport is divided: Drinks, Cigarettes, Porn,'' one customs
investigator said. Confiscated videos are incinerated.
While men carrying a couple of adult tapes for home-viewing will have
them confiscated, material which involves children will go to court.
Included in Scotland's 1994-95 figures was a Glasgow man fined #150 for
possessing pictures of naked children. Gordon Millar, of the Customs and
Excise Investigations Unit, says: ''Any paedophile material entering the
UK from the EU or outwith the EU will be investigated to ascertain the
people involved. It's important to get them to court.''
Across Britain in 1993-94, 37,014 indecent or obscene items were
seized. Thirty-two people were prosecuted, of whom four received
custodial sentences. The total of these sentences was three years, 11
months. These details from Custom and Excise's annual report were
followed by a passage highlighting the digital future of pornography
smuggling.
The report said that while magazines still dominated the market,
CD-Roms and computer disks were increasing in popularity. It poses a
grave concern because they are easy to copy.
''A small number of imported disks can form the basis of a significant
trade in pornography,'' said the report.
In the dingy office of a computer confidante, the screen is awash with
serial numbers lined in columns. Each number is a door which can be
opened by the ENTER key, revealing, at first, Playboy-style pin-ups
scanned from the pages of top-shelf magazines. Scroll down to a numeric
basement and the pictures change. Smiling girls are replaced by women
trussed like turkeys, whip marks on their backs, gags over their mouths.
Photographs of women sodomised and beaten.
At the Fettes offices of Lothian and Border's Serious Crime Squad,
Detective Inspector Willie Manson is juggling to bring three cases
involving pornography to trial. Two involve computers, one involves
videos. Computer pornography, he explains, is a multimillion-pound
business and Scottish firms are involved.
Hard-core pornographic pictures and short films on CD-Roms are
imported from Sweden and America for as little as #5 or #10. Copies are
easily made, then sold for about #40 each. In a manner similar to 0898
sex lines, interested parties can call numbers, quote credit-card
numbers, then download pictures. Payment is deducted.
Concerns that the Internet is a legislative wilderness, where anything
can go, are unfounded. Two pieces of legislation trap computer
pornographers. CD-Roms are classed as video cassettes and so require
certification. Those uncertified are liable for heavy fines by the
Trading Standards department. It is illegal to send obscene material
through telephone lines and modems, in much the same way as it is
illegal to make obscene phone calls.
''It can be difficult to police,'' said Mr Manson, ''but I'm not in
the game of targeting individual people who are looking at the stuff. I
want to stop the people that we know of, in this country, who are making
lots of money out of it. There is no argument about censorship because
the images that we are looking at are so obviously illegal that there
can be no complaint.''
Mr Manson said that if children know where to look for pornography,
then they can gain access to it. He encourages parents to take an active
interest in the material their children are viewing.
And then there is digital manipulation.
Computers are being used to convert glamour poses by adult women into
examples of paedophile porn, by erasing pubic hair and reducing breast
size.
And so doors continue to open and the images keep tumbling out. Yet
rarely on an unsuspecting public.

TOURIST spending in Scotland rose by 16%, from #325m to #378m, in the
first six months of the year, even before the good summer weather began,
the Scottish Tourist Board announced yesterday.
Mr Derek Reid, the board's chief executive, described the figures as
very encouraging but warned against complacency amid worldwide
competition.

A CHURCH of Scotland minister at the centre of a row over his personal
money-making enterprise has resigned his ministry of a Clydebank church.
The Rev Thomas Logan was ordered by Dumbarton Presbytery to end his
involvement in a networking organisation selling household cleaning
products but he challenged their decision in the the Court of Session
and was granted an interim interdict allowing him to continue.
That decision was later reversed by three appeal judges who said the
High Court did not have the power to intervene because the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland was a recognised court in its own
right.
Officials at the Dumbarton Presbytery confirmed yesterday that Mr
Logan had demitted his charge at Abbotsford Church. Clerk of the
Presbytery the Rev David Munro insisted he had made his decision without
pressure from the Kirk.
Mr Munro said: ''He has decided to demit his charge at Abbotsford. It
does not mean he is not a minister any longer, but if he wanted to
preach again elsewhere he would have to reapply for a Presbytery
certificate.
''As far as I know, he has not done that and I have no idea what he
intends to do or where he intends to go.''
Mr Munro added: ''He is still living in the Abbotsford manse. His
demission takes effect on October 31 and I would expect him to vacate
the property by that date.''
The clerk confirmed that Mr Logan would still qualify for an ex-gratia
settlement from the Church of Scotland which is usually given in cases
of demission.
But another Kirk spokesman said: ''Legal costs were awarded in our
favour after the appeal was upheld. Mr Logan is liable for these and
they will be deducted from what is due.''
Mr Logan was not available for comment at his Clydebank manse
yesterday.
When he refused to stop selling goods, he was charged by Dumbarton
Presbytery with disobedience of their instructions regarding his
activities with the sales networking organisation, the Amway Company,
and was suspended.
Mr Logan accepted his suspension but hit out at the the procedures
under which he was tried. He said, at that time, that the Kirk had its
own constitutional ''Clause 4'' situation to resolve.

Washington
THE Pope wound up his tour of the eastern United States today in a
Baltimore soup-kitchen, after once again reminding Americans of the duty
of Christian charity and compassion. A country that has recently
reverted to the work-house attitude towards the poor, and proposes to
close its doors to immigrants, has been slightly abashed at the message.
Americans, or at least Roman Catholic Americans and those who take
social policy seriously, expected the Pope once again to discuss
abortion, priestly celibacy, the ordination of women, and contraception,
all matters that divide the church and provoke the opposition of many
people, particularly women.
Instead, he asked: ''Is present-day America becoming less sensitive,
less caring towards the poor, the weak, the strange, the needy? It must
not!'' He has insisted repeatedly on Christians' moral responsibility
towards the less fortunate.
Americans voted last November for a party that believes that the poor
are responsible for their poverty and cannot expect help from the more
responsible.
Roman Catholic conservatives are now faced with the need to put a
conservative spin to the Pope's words. One is quoted in a newspaper this
morning as saying: ''The Pope does not come here to propose either
himself or the church as an expert in social welfare policy. It is very
important to realise that his welcome call to compassion for the poor,
for solidarity for the poor, is linked in his social doctrine to
empowerment of the poor, of breaking them out of the cycle of
dependency.''
This last is a Newt Gingrich-Republican catchphrase -- and most Roman
Catholics, certainly most of the church hierarchy, would argue
strenuously that the church is, indeed, expert in social welfare policy.
The church has been lobbying vigorously against new restrictions on
immigration, and defending the welfare system.
The Pope has called repeatedly for compassion to the poor, and has
most explicitly stated that this means using America's wealth to help
the less fortunate, abroad as well as at home. He is flying in the face
of current American sentiment: the most militantly Roman Catholic
candidate for the presidency, Patrick Buchanan, is also the most radical
in wanting to disclaim any American responsibility for the foreign poor.
The Pope addressed an audience of 125,000 in New York's Central Park
yesterday, then said mass in St Patrick's Cathedral.
Afterwards, he walked down Fifth Avenue, surrounded by flurried
security men and clerics. All the same, he managed to meet a few New
Yorkers.
Today, he celebrated mass in a baseball stadium in Baltimore, the
oldest Catholic diocese in the country. It was filled to capacity, about
55,000, and scores of thousands more flocked to see him come and go.
Afterwards, he had lunch in a soup kitchen run by a local Roman
Catholic church. It was another opportunity to demonstrate that the poor
are always with us, and show us our duty to help them, whatever the
Republican Party may say.
Mr Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole both asked to see the Pope. He had no
time to fit them in.

BALTIMORE: A woman died yesterday after plunging from a 30th
floor-window of a hotel only one block from the Pope's parade route. The
fall happened at about the same time as the Pope arrived at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport, said hotel security director
Carl Smith. The woman, a hotel employee, landed 2ft away from three
people standing outside the Tremont Plaza Hotel. Within minutes the
hotel and surrounding area were closed off by Secret Service agents and
police.

A SCHOOLGIRL holidaymaker ''played dead'' when she was shot in the
hand by a gunman who ran amok in a Moroccan hotel, killing two British
tourists and severely injuring another.
That instinctive action saved the life of 12-year-old Charlene Barker,
from Norfolk, who was confronted by the killer when she opened her
bedroom door.
Yesterday, as the hunt continued for the off-duty policeman who began
his killing spree after shooting dead his wife, Charlene was
astonishingly calm and philosophical.
She said it was her first instinct to shield her face with her hand as
the man opened fire in the Hotel Tarik, outside Tangier, and her second
to ''play dead'' until he went away.
Charlene, of Bradwell, near Great Yarmouth, was still nursing her
bandaged left hand as she got back into the holiday routine yesterday,
leaving with her 17-year-old brother, Andrew, mother Janet, 38, and
stepfather Francis Hall, 45, for a family day trip along the coast.
Meanwhile, Moroccan police stepped up their hunt for the killer who
brought carnage to the supposedly quiet package tour retreat on Friday
night.
Mustapha Hamouch, 37, had earlier shot dead his wife, Samia Benjedi.
Then, in the bar of the hotel, he shot dead Martin and Margaret Gower,
of Ruislip, Middlesex, who were celebrating their 40th wedding
anniversary.
Another British tourist, Mrs Patricia Sharratt, who had been
befriended by the Gowers during their holiday, was hit by two bullets as
she tried to flee upstairs.
It was when Mrs Sharratt collapsed outside Charlene's third-floor room
that the youngster opened her door to be confronted by the gunman.
Mrs Sharratt was flown back to Britain by air ambulance yesterday
evening. A spokesman for First Choice Holidays in Tangier said: ''We
understand her condition is serious but not critical.''
Dr Layachi Bohmidi, duty registrar at the Tangier clinic where Mrs
Sharratt was treated, said the two bullets which hit her were still
lodged in her back. One of them may have penetrated a lung, but there
was no danger to her life, he said.
Other British tourists who witnessed the shootings joined Charlene's
parents in praising her courage.
Mrs Barbara Kirkham, an emergency telephone operator from Rainford,
Merseyside, said: ''I can't imagine what she went through. I didn't
sleep at all that night. I was a nervous wreck, so I dread to think what
a 12-year-old must have been thinking.''
A police spokesman in Tangier said he was ''shocked and surprised'' by
the actions of the killer. ''He was an inspector . . . and he was very
good at his job,'' he said.
The official acknowledged that police were considering the possibility
that Hamouch might later have turned the gun on himself.
Police were convinced that he was still in the country. The spokesman
assured holidaymakers that the incident was isolated. ''We say to
tourists: Please come to Tangier -- it is safe and peaceful,'' he said.
The Foreign Office also said yesterday that British tourists should
not be deterred from visiting Morocco because of the shootings.
''This is a one-off, it's not going to affect general tourism to the
country, and was not targeted at tourists,'' an official said.
Yesterday the Tarik Hotel, in a quiet location several miles outside
the bustle of Tangier, was closed and all the guests had been
transferred to other hotels.
Most of them, like Charlene and her family, had been upgraded to
beach-front hotels in the centre of the resort.
Several of the Gowers' relatives, including Mr Gower's 90-year-old
mother Phyllis, found out about their deaths on the radio.
The couple's son, Adrian, told ITN yesterday: ''A lot of relatives,
like my dad's mum -- she's 90 -- found out through the news. It's
devastating for her to find out on the radio that her son had been
killed rather than someone coming to her.''
Many of the Britons who had been at the Hotel Tarik said that the
horror of the killings remained fresh in their minds.
Mr Graham Brake, a 47-year-old social services worker, from
Huddersfield, said: ''I just heard 'bang, bang' and I thought it was
party poppers.
''The man ran in front of me with the gun and I thought it was all
part of a cabaret act.
''He went up a few steps and shot someone at the bar. Everyone was
screaming, but I was wondering if it was all an act and was it real
blood or blood capsules.''

Geneva,
RUSSIA and the United States agreed today that their troops should
work together to implement a peace accord in Bosnia, but they appeared
to make no headway on the thorny question of who would run the
operation.
After a day of talks in Geneva with Russian Defence Minister Pavel
Grachev, US Defence Secretary William Perry said ''substantial
progress'' had been made but there was still a lot of work to be done on
the shape of the force.
After the rival sides in the Bosnian war sign an accord, the US and
its Nato allies want to pour up to 60,000 troops into the republic to
separate the warring parties and give peace a chance to take hold.
Washington is expected to provide the backbone of the force, around
20,000 troops, and is keen that Moscow should also contribute.
However, after years of military frustration in the Balkans, Nato
allies are set against the idea of ''dual command'' and want the force
to be under Alliance control -- an idea that Russia rejects.
''Russia wants to participate in the peace implementation force and
the United States and other Western countries want Russia to
participate,'' Perry told reporters.
''(But) there are difficult questions to be worked out, particularly
on the issue of command and control.''
He added: ''I think we have made substantial progress today but it is
very clear to both of us that there is a lot of hard work ahead.''
Perry said Moscow would send a team of senior military officials to
Nato headquarters in Belgium next week to join in the planning of the
force. The issue would also be tackled at the next meeting of the
Russo-Western Contact Group on Bosnia.
''I do not want to underestimate what we were not able to agree on,
which is the difference on how the operational control of the force will
be effected,'' Perry said.
''It is also an issue of political control. Our view is that political
guidance for this operation comes from the North Atlantic (Nato) Council
and it is quite clear the Russians do not agree with that.''
The Geneva meeting, the fourth between Perry and Grachev this year,
also covered a range of other security issues including Nato's expansion
into eastern and central Europe and the possibility of joint Russian-US
military exercises.
Grachev said the joint exercises to train soldiers in peacekeeping
duties had been rescheduled and would start in Kansas on October 23.
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin are due to meet near New York
the same day.
Gracehv said: ''We confirmed Russia's position that (Nato) enlargement
is inadmissible. At the same time we are ready to continue our
co-operation with the Alliance but this in no way shows that we agree to
enlargement.''
On the Bosnian peace force, Grachev said Russia backed the idea of a
multi-national force acting under UN Security Council mandate. ''We have
agreed that it will not be called a Nato operation but a name which
reflects reality,'' he said.
''The name will be the Operation of the Implementation Force in
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and that is not only a name because the
contributions to the force will come from many countries, not just
Nato.''
Asked how many troops Russia would be willing to contribute, Grachev
said Yeltsin had suggested leaving the two battalions now in the UN
peacekeeping force and sending a reinforced division -- a much larger
unit -- in addition.
However he said Perry suggested the Russians should send in
''several'' additional battalions, implying that Nato wanted to avoid a
large Russian unit with high-ranking command.--Reuter.

SERIOUS concerns about the potential dangers of deep water trawling to
the west of Shetland as the new oil province opens up will be voiced at
a conference next month in Aberdeen.
Huge fishing nets, too large for the shallow waters of the North Sea
and big enough to envelop the Eiffel Tower, will be deployed to the west
of Shetland by pelagic fishermen. If they snag on to a seabed structure
they could pose a risk to the lives of fishermen, their vessels and
their gear, causing a pollution danger.
Mr Ken Knox, of the Kingfisher Chart Department of the Sea Fish
Industry Authority -- a statutory body which for 30 years has collected
and distributed seabed information to fishermen -- will detail the
dangers at the Subtech 95 conference.
He will tell delegates there are considerably higher risks of
dangerous encounters than in the North Sea, where those involved are
well known to each other. In the West of Shetland, there were numerous
''flag of convenience'' trawlers which did not necessarily abide by the
rules.
According to Mr Knox, the new fishing grounds are inhospitable and
relatively uncharted, vessels are much larger and more powerful, and a
major difference is the net size, which in some cases is 3000 metres in
circumference.
Some of the vessels weigh 7000 tonnes, have 4000 horse power, and are
capable of trawling at a depth of more than 1000 metres.
Such is the power of the vessels that, while a small trawler of 100
horse power may become stuck fast on a seabed obstruction, a 4000hp one
might plough straight through it.
The large ''otter boards'' which precede the net in a deep water trawl
are likely to be the first things to collide with a sub-sea structure,
cable or pipeline and could cause considerable damage.
If the gear did not catch a seabed obstacle, the most dangerous
manoeuvre was likely to be trying to free it, when a vessel may be at
risk of capsizing.
Mr Knox will call for ''non-aggressive'' dialogue between the oil and
fishing industries.
Kingfisher Charts has already held preliminary talks with groups from
the oil and fishing industries on the possibility of establishing a west
of Shetland seabed information service.
The offshore operators have expressed their support, and Kingfisher is
now seeking the backing of European skippers. A progress report will be
given at Subtech.

Brussels,
EUROPEAN Commission officials are believed to be preparing a challenge
which could halt French President Jacques Chirac's nuclear testing
programme in the South Pacific.
Tension between France and the commission is high as Eurocrats in
Brussels prepare today to seek, if necessary, an injunction in the
European Court of Justice banning President Chirac from continuing his
test programme in defiance of world opinion.
The French authorities responded testily to EU Environment
Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard's claim last week that France was
withholding scientific information necessary to enable the commission to
assess whether the tests breached the Euratom treaty.
The latest exchanges followed a two-hour debate behind closed doors in
the commission on Wednesday when there was a reportedly deep division of
opinion. ''There was blood on the walls,'' one official claimed.
According to one insider, Mrs Bjerregaard took the view that ''getting
the truth out of the French is a lost cause''. She claims EU officials
are being refused access by France to vital scientific information
although some facilities have been granted to commission investigators.
In the past few days the European Parliament, which has condemned the
tests, has demanded the presence of France's top scientists involved in
the experiments at a hearing in Brussels to be chaired by Mr Ken
Collins, the assembly's environment committee chairman.
Mr Collins, Labour Euro-MP for Strathclyde East, said last night:
''These people will be there. It has all been arranged. This will be one
of the biggest hearings in the history of the European Parliament -- the
only parliament in Europe which has been able to organise such a
gathering.''
Mr Collins believes the French are acting illegally under the terms of
the Euratom treaty.
France has challenged Mrs Bjerregaard for allegedly deriding an
invitation to her personally to visit French Polynesia. ''We hope she
will seriously study the details of the invitation,'' a French
Government spokesman said.
Mrs Bjerregaard has given no details of the reported commission row
but has accused the French of failing to take the issue seriously.
The French Government responded: ''The European Union is an
institution about which we do not joke.''
Mrs Bjerregaard, a Dane, was already unpopular in Paris last week
after Danish newspapers reported her alleged belief that commission
president Jacques Santer had stitched up a secret deal with the French
authorities to prevent the commission taking action. The claims were
angrily denied in Brussels and Paris.
A Brussels observer said last night: ''Some commissioners are itching
to have a go at the French but they have no legal precedent to go on.
This is most of the problem.''
Neil Kinnock is believed to be among the commissioners supporting Mrs
Bjerregaard.
The commission's principal difficulty is that it has insufficient
information on which to decide whether to call for a ban on tests on the
basis that they constitute ''particularly dangerous experiments'' as
laid down in the Euratom treaty. Only the French authorities possess
that information.
Observers last night said the commission had decided to meet this
problem head on by demanding reports on damage to test sites within five
days from French authorities. A failure to respond could mean the French
being hauled before judges in Luxembourg.
The European Parliament meets in Strasbourg today and has demanded a
clear statement from Mr Santer immediately after nuclear testing is
debated again by the commission on Wednesday.

Sungai Penuh
FRESH tremors caused panic today at the scene of a devastating
earthquake on Indonesia's Sumatra island which killed at least 100
people.
Indonesian soldiers, working under torrential rains, dug mass graves
to bury the scores of dead from yesterday's earthquake, in which the
toll was expected to rise.
A 41-member medical team, including five specialists, was flown from
Jakarta to the remote mountain region around the north-west Sumatran
town of Sungai Penuh today to treat more than 2000 injured.
Homeless survivors slept overnight in tents pitched outside what was
left of their homes, living in fear as aftershocks shook the area.
Five fresh tremors forced terrified survivors to flee from homes that
were still standing. Some huddled on the ground and cried.
Survivors were instructed to stay in their tents to avoid injuries
from aftershocks.
''I thought maybe this time it's going to be my turn,'' said Yus Joko,
40, a schoolteacher who lost his entire family of four.
Yus said he barely got outside his home when it ''crumbled like
matchsticks, burying my whole family in it''.
Nine-month pregnant Nisawati managed to escape with her eight-year-old
son through a window of her collapsed house when the quake struck. ''It
was terrifying,'' she said.
Fires dotted the area around Sungai Penuh as survivors tried to stay
warm tonight.
Most people expected to spend several nights under the open sky.
Meanwhile, a battalion of 800 troops helped police and residents
remove bodies from the rubble.
The dead were wrapped in white shrouds and carted in lorries to graves
outside the town to avoid outbreak of diseases. The work was slow as the
downpour filled the graves with water and turned the freshly filled
earth into watery mud.
Still, ''they were given a decent Muslim burial'', said a military
officer. ''Most of them, with the consent of the families, were buried
quickly.''
The quake, which measured 7.0 on the open-ended Richter scale,
flattened more than 10,000 buildings in villages around Sungai Penuh, a
hill town 466 miles north-west of Jakarta.
It was the seventh quake to hit Sumatra since 1990 and the worst since
a 6.5 magnitude quake in February last year killed 200 people and
destroyed thousands of buildings in Lampung district.
Meanwhile, officials said a second big quake, with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.2, hit neighbouring Java island this morning.
Its centre was 70 miles from Sukabumi town in Western Java. There were
no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties.

O J SIMPSON was on his way to the Dominican Republic today for a
speedy marriage to his Italian girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, according to
a Dominican newspaper.
Listin Diario said that the former American football star and Barbieri
left Los Angeles yesterday for Miami and were to fly on a private plane
to the Dominican Republic today.
The newspaper claimed they were heading for the exclusive Casa de
Campo resort, where singer Michael Jackson secretly married Lisa Marie
Presley last year. Listin Diario broke the story of their wedding.
Listin Diario said its sources indicated that Simpson, 48, and
Barbieri, a 28-year-old model and actress, were accompanied by Simpson's
lawyer F Lee Bailey and two friends.
The marriage rumours started a few days after a jury in Los Angeles
acquitted Simpson in the murders of his ex-wife and her friend.
Simpson began seeing Barbieri in 1992, the year he separated from and
later divorced his wife. He and Barbieri broke up for several months
while he tried to patch up his marriage but they later resumed their
relationship.--AP/Reuter.

Skopje
A VIRTUAL news blackout has surrounded the investigation into a car
bombing that seriously injured Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov in
central Skopje on Tuesday.
He remains in hospital in critical but stable condition.
Investigators, including British experts, may be keeping quiet so as
not to tip their hand before they have made any arrests. However they
may also be silent out of fear that their findings may destabilise the
tiny Balkan state.
Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania are all at odds with Macedonia
for various reasons, so Skopje can ill afford a confrontation if a
suspect from one of those nations is found and punished.
One Macedonian official said that even if a culprit is found, the
person's identity or origin might never be released.
However police have released a photo-fit picture of a suspect who
bought the Citroen used in the blast, after which a bystander and the
president's chauffeur died. Gligorov was seriously wounded by shrapnel
in the head and right eye.
A team of French eye specialists arrived tonight to prepare for
surgery on Gligorov, 78, who led Macedonia to independence in the
break-up of the former Yugoslavia but managed to keep it almost free of
the bloodshed which engulfed other states.
Parliament Speaker Stojan Andov is now in charge of Macedonia. If the
constitutional court determines Gligorov cannot continue in office, new
elections must be held within 40 days.--AP/Reuter.

A SAFEWAY store in Edinburgh was at the centre of a police inquiry
yesterday after an alert on possible ''spiked'' drinks -- only a few
miles from another of the company's stores that was involved in a
contaminated tonic water investigation earlier this year.
Both police and Safeway issued statements warning that two bottles of
Robinson's apple and blackcurrant concentrate sold at the store in
Morningside, on or since Monday, October 2, may have been contaminated.
Police emphasised, however, that measures had been taken purely as a
precaution. A batch of one-litre bottles of the product had been removed
from the shelves -- both standard concentrate and ''Special R'', which
contains no sugar.
They moved in after information received at the weekend, discovering
that 73 bottles had already been sold through the check-outs, and set up
a helpline for the public. A report has already been submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.
While no other products are considered to have been affected, the
public health alert was issued in full consultation with Edinburgh
District Council's Department of Environmental Health.
Investigations were being led yesterday by Detective Superintendent
John McGowan of Lothian and Borders CID, the man who headed the earlier
inquiry. It led to university lecturer Dr Paul Agutter, from
Athelstaneford, East Lothian, being jailed for 12 years for a plot to
murder his wife.
He was convicted last February at the High Court in Edinburgh of
attempting to kill his wife by placing bottles of tonic contaminated
with the poison atropine on the shelves of a Safeway supermarket at New
Swanston.
Several Safeway customers became violently ill after drinking from the
contaminated bottles, and shelves were cleared in a nationwide safety
campaign.
Police, along with the company, stressed that no other products at any
other store were a matter of concern.
Yesterday, Mr McGowan declined to say what the contaminant, if any,
may have been, but said that it was important to alert customers not to
drink the product.
As laboratory tests were being held yesterday, one difficulty facing
police was that the latest incident could lead to ''copycat'' incidents.
Mr McGowan said: ''We want to hear from people who may have bought
this product, but I am quite happy about other drinks products bought
from the store. Information given to us is being actively pursued.''
A spokesman for Safeway said that as soon as the company was alerted
to the possibility of a product contamination it was withdrawn, with
co-operation beginning with the police and the health department.
He added: ''We join the police in asking our customers who have bought
the product to return it to the store, or call the police. There have
been no reports of illness to date, and this action is purely a
precautionary measure.''
Earlier, a company spokeswoman said there were no plans to withdraw
the concentrate from other branches.
* The helpine number set up by police, 0131-311 3535, will operate
until further notice.

from Kendal, Cumbria, and Mr Tom Henson, of Carnforth, Lancashire, had
been forced to shelter on the Cuillins ridge when gales and driving rain
made climbing impossible.

JOHN Cairncross, alleged to have been the ''fifth man'' in a Soviet
spy ring that included Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Mclean, and
Anthony Blunt, has died at the age of 82, according to the Daily
Telegraph.
Cairncross had been living secretly in England after returning from
self-imposed exile in France six months ago to write his memoirs, it
said. A former civil servant, he had repeatedly denied he was a member
of the famous Cambridge University ring of spies.
Soviet spy Oleg Gordievsky, who worked as a double agent for Britain
before defecting in 1985, unveiled Cairncross as the ''fifth man'' in
1990.

AN Ayrshire castle and estate are up for sale six years after they had
been bought to be transformed into a five-star hotel and leisure
complex.
Rowallan Castle, between Fenwick and Kilmaurs, was sold by the Corbett
family in 1989 in a move described at the time as ''sad but
inevitable''.
Since then, the slack leisure market has seen the plans come to
nothing and the owners, property development company Alexander George,
has been advised by bankers to put the estate on the market.
The fourth Lord Rowallan, who moved from the family home to live
nearby, has expressed his disappointment at the failure of the original
plans and warned that the estate should not simply become a private
home.
The estate, with its grade A listed castle dating from the thirteenth
century and ''new'' castle built for the family in 1901, extends to 281
acres. It includes a separate working farm with staff cottages, stables,
and garages.
At the time, Lord Rowallan, then heir to the title, made it clear that
the estate was being sold for development but the dream failed to turn
into reality.
''I know that the estate now has nothing to do with me any longer but
I am disappointed that nothing has happened about the original plans
which were exciting and would have met our wishes that the castle and
estate should be available to the public,'' he said.
He said there was a clause in the sale preventing it becoming a
private house.
The estate is now in the hands of the Ayrshire division of Bell
Ingram, who were called in by Alexander George and the TSB to market the
property.
It is available in eight lots, including offers over #650,000 for the
''new'' castle.
The entire estate and buildings are valued in excess of #1.2m.
Bell Ingram makes it clear that there are various planning consents in
place, including those for a hotel and conference centre, 18-hole
championship golf course and timeshare development.
Mr John Cowan, of Bell Ingram, said: ''The estate has already
attracted considerable interest and there is one potential buyer looking
at it with a view to creating a top-class hotel.''
Mr Cowan said one of the most important conditions of the sale is the
deed of guardianship, which makes it essential for the original castle
to be preserved and for public access to be made available.
Rowallan came into the hands of the Corbett family in 1901. The family
were landowners and merchants in Glasgow.
Mr Archibald Cameron Corbett, a Liberal MP, found the old castle too
cramped and called in the rising young architect Robert Lorimer to
design a new country home.
Lorimer, like his contemporaries Rennie Mackintosh and Lutyens,
designed the house and many of the pieces of furniture which it
contained.

<HEADLINE>Call for legal ban on salmon fishing</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975978775</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE start of the salmon fishing season on the River Dee is to be
postponed for a month to protect dwindling stocks.
Owners of lucrative beats on the river are seeking permission from the
Scottish Secretary to delay the start of the 1996 fishing season until
March 1.
The Dee District Salmon Fishery Board also wants full legal powers to
prosecute anyone caught using a rod and line out of season.
It claims the move is essential to stop spring salmon from dying out
altogether.
The move comes after rebel anglers defied a voluntary code introduced
this year. Two large beats on the river broke ranks and allowed anglers
to fish, despite warnings that the future of one of the world's finest
salmon rivers was at stake.
The tougher action has received backing from the Prince of Wales, who
has attended meetings to discuss the crisis facing the river.
''The prince is a supporter of the voluntary ban, and has given us his
full support as a beat owner,'' said board chairman Colonel Robert
Campbell.
Only the Ardoe timeshare stretch and Upper Drum Fishings at Drumoak
defied the self-imposed code and allowed anglers to fish the depleted
stocks this year.
Col Campbell confirmed yesterday that their actions had prompted the
appeal to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
''It is absolutely vital that we get people to respect the agreement.
The message really is 'respect the conservation code or lose the fishing
forever'.''
''We are asking the Secretary of State to approve that there will be
no fishing of any sort until March 1.
''If he makes a by-law, then anyone who ignores it and goes fishing
will now be breaking the law.''
Col Campbell said he was satisfied the majority of owners would again
observe the extended close season.

A SCOTS student who won a one-off prize to walk down a catwalk has
been snapped up by a top London modelling agency.
Now she is putting her books to one side and concentrating on her
looks as she attempts to become the country's next supermodel.
It all happened for Susan George, 20, after she won a competition on
her local radio station which offered her the chance to be a supermodel
for a day.
Now she is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Scots supermodel
Kirsty Hume who can command thousands of pounds per day.
The trim blue-eyed blonde from Elgin, Morayshire, did not know she had
been entered in the contest which could yet propel her to fame and
fortune.
Her father had sent two holiday photographs of her to Inverness-based
Moray Firth Radio and Susan was chosen from hundreds of entries to be a
model for a day at a fashion show.
After just one stroll along the catwalk at the Homes '95 exhibition in
Inverness, top agency boss Corrina Bouffard offered her a professional
camera-shoot -- modelling bridal wear in London the next day.
Susan, a communications student at Queen Margaret's University,
Edinburgh, could not make that appointment at such short notice. But she
has agreed to try out the agency's offer of work in London.
Ms Bouffard runs an international agency, recently featured on BBC
TV's The Clothes Show, and was in Inverness with five professional
models who were taking part in the show.
She said: ''Susan is a complete natural and could make a good living
in modelling with proper guidance.''
A local photographer is compiling a portfolio for Susan which she will
take with her to London in two weeks' time.
Susan said: ''Corrina says there is plenty of work for me down in
London if I want it. I am not due back at university until February, so
why not.
''I am walking on air at the moment. I can not believe that all this
has happened so quickly. It is a dream come true.''
Susan, who wants to be a journalist once her university course is
finished, says she intends finishing her course even if the modelling
work comes flooding in.

LABOUR'S transport spokesman Mr Henry McLeish has called on the Tories
to debate why the Government is ''tearing the heart out of the
railways'' at their conference in Blackpool.
Mr McLeish threw down his challenge after leaked documents revealed
that Railtrack will not have to improve performance standards in the
run-up to privatisation in order to make it more attractive to City
buyers.
Under the passengers' charter, rail operators must make cash refunds
and season-ticket discounts if annual performance targets are not met.
But Transport Secretary Sir George Young has told Railtrack it does not
have to improve standards in line with the charter, which calls for an
annual improvement in rail services.
The leaked documents said: ''Railtrack's participation in meeting
season ticket discounts or extension payments to passengers provides a
strong incentive to train operators not to raise standards as they will
carry all the risk if performance declines.''
Mr McLeish said: ''This is another example of standards for passengers
being sacrificed for shareholders and profit and it doesn't say much for
the Prime Minister and his much vaunted standards that, as they prepare
to privatise Railtrack, they are now seeking to lower standards.''
Mr McLeish challenged the Transport Secretary to make a statement at
Blackpool on his ''abandonment of punctuality and reliability
standards''.

<RECORDNO>975978778</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday declared war on what he
describes as the ''crackpot proposal'' by Labour and the Liberal
Democrats for a Scottish Parliament.
Mr Forsyth accused the two parties of ''gambling with Scotland's vital
services'' and warned that a formula for determining public expenditure
based on need, rather than population, would lead to a considerable gap
in spending.
It seems inevitable Mr Forsyth will soon take the gloves off and
exploit the uncertainties over the ''real cost'' of a Scottish
Parliament.
He said Labour and the Liberal Democrats, in arguing for change, were
putting at risk the benefits which we enjoy north of the Border, such as
smaller class sizes and a better funding regime for the NHS.
The Scottish Secretary, speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Eye to Eye
programme, described the proposal for a parliament in Edinburgh, as
''simply unrealistic''.
He said he could not support it because it would be something that
would ''damage Scotland and our way of life''.
Mr Forsyth conceded, however, that he had asked officials in the
Scottish Office to look at ways of revamping the Scottish Economic
Council to provide a forum for people to have a greater say in the
''hard choices and difficult decisions'' which had to be made in
Scotland.
The proposal, first suggested by Scottish TUC general secretary Mr
Campbell Christie during the summer, would not be a substitute for a
Scottish Parliament, Mr Forsyth said.
It would be about ensuring people had more say and more involvement in
the government of Scotland and would deal with the perception that
people did not have a strong enough voice.
Mr Forsyth is looking to devolve power to local government and in turn
looking for local authorities to devolve power to community councils
which are to receive extra funding in an attempt to get ''power down to
a low level''.
However, he said: ''The alternative which is put forward by our
opponents of a patronage parliament sitting in Edinburgh, where nearly
half the members will be appointed by the poltical parties and not
elected and which will put in danger our ability to fund our caring
services, is not something that I could support because it would be
something which would damage Scotland and our way of life.''
Mr Forsyth said Labour and the Liberal Democrats had still not
declared whether the block grant from Government for a Scottish
parliament would be based on need or on some kind of population formula.
When he asked Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, he claimed
he was told ''wait and see''.
The Scottish Secretary argued that the difference in deciding how the
formula was based could place at risk several billions of pounds of
vital public expenditure for schools, hospitals, higher education, or
employment.
He added: ''The proposal that we are going to have a parliament in
Edinburgh cutting taxes, which is more generously funded than
constituencies south of the Border and where there was no proposal to
make that funding in some way based on need, is simply unrealistic. They
are gambling with Scotland's vital services.''
Speaking on the eve of the publication of Scottish Revenue and
Expenditure estimates, Mr Forsyth rejected suggestions that Scotland was
overfunded and defended the Barnett formula, which allows the Scottish
Secretary to determine how public expenditure is disbursed in Scotland,
a system he has said would only be changed over his ''dead body''.
He said: ''The people who are putting that at risk are the Labour
Party and the Liberal Democrats going around talking about a block grant
funding for a Scottish parliament based on need.
''That would result in a substantial reduction in the funding for
Scotland. It is deeply irresponsible that they should be putting forward
these proposals and not a little unhelpful actually for those of us who
are fighting Scotland's corner based on the status quo.''
Mr Forsyth went on: ''We are the party that is arguing for the status
quo. It is our opponents who are arguing for change. In arguing for
change they are putting at risk the benefits which we enjoy north of the
Border.
''Anyone with eyes to see can see we have smaller class sizes in
Scotland compared to England, that we have a better funding regime for
the health service. I shall fight to the end to support that.
''It is Labour and the Liberals who are putting all that at risk with
this crackpot proposal for a Scottish parliament,'' he said.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, commenting on Mr Forsyth's
proposal for changes to the Scottish Economic Council, said: ''Revamping
an old quango with more Forsyth appointees is a feeble and unacceptable
substitute for Labour's Scottish parliament inside Britain which people
consistently tell us they want.
''If Mr Forsyth listens to that deafening message he will be praised,
but if he continues to defy the will of the people, he endangers not
only his own political skin but the unity of the country.''
* A delegation from the Scottish TUC general council will meet Shadow
Scottish Secretary Robertson today to discuss the scheme for a Scottish
Parliament. It follows discussions between STUC general secretary Mr
Campbell Christie and Mr Robertson on Friday and comes four days after
the STUC publicly opposed Labour's plans for the make-up of a Scottish
Parliament.

<HEADLINE>Senior registrar attacks NHS trust managers over under-staffing in hospitals. Cost-cutting 'is killing patients'</HEADLINE>

A ''SIGNIFICANT'' number of patients in Scottish hospitals are dying
because of cost-cutting measures, a senior registrar has claimed.
In a blistering attack on NHS trust managers, Dr Anila Reddy of
Inverness's Raigmore NHS Trust said under-staffing sanctioned by the
Government was putting patients' lives at risk.
He said he had collated evidence and spoken to doctors from across
Scotland over the past two years and he was prepared to substantiate his
claims in court.
Yesterday, on duty in the Raigmore's paediatric ward, Dr Reddy stated
that in Scottish hospitals:
* Seriously-ill patients are being left neglected in wards for hours.
* There are no guidelines recommending the number of doctors to
patients, leaving some intensive care units badly under-staffed.
* Significant numbers of patients are dying due to medical negligence
caused by under-staffing.
* Junior doctors are being forced to carry out treatments that should
be carried out by their senior counterparts.
Dr Reddy's criticism comes two years after he publicly claimed that
staff at Raigmore were at breaking point, seven months after the
hospital gained trust status.
He said then that doctors were not spending enough time at bedsides
and patients were being discharged too quickly. Yesterday he said all
his predictions had come true.
Raigmore NHS Trust's medical director, Dr John Machin, said that as Dr
Reddy had given no specfic examples he did not feel the hospital could
comment.
''Dr Reddy is perfectly entitled to express a personal view about the
workings of the NHS. It is something that affects us all and everyone
has a legitimate interest in its well-being whether as a patient, an
employee, or a tax-payer,'' he said.
Dr Reddy's claims were also greeted with some caution by the health
union, Unison.
Its spokeswoman, Ms Grace Robertson, said: ''I would like to see Dr
Reddy's proof. We have continuing concerns about cost-cutting measures
in NHS trusts.''
However, the experienced doctor from Papua New Guinea, who has worked
for the NHS since 1984, challenged trust managers to contradict his
claims.
He said: ''The trust cannot rubbish my opinions. The onus is on them
to prove that patients are not dying due to medical negligence.''
He said the cut in junior doctors' hours had not been compensated for
by an increase in the number of hours worked by experienced medical
staff.
''There is no flexibility in the system. Nurses and doctors all over
the country are screaming about the quality of care but middle-line and
top management are not listening.''
He said he was reluctant to give details of individual cases on the
grounds of patient confidentiality and was also reluctant to blame
individual doctors or nurses.
He said: ''The point is that the NHS is crumbling beneath the surface.
Not one consultant has come to me and told me I'm wrong but they also
take the attitude that that is how it is.
''I think it is up to society to help solve the problem and I would
encourage people to sue hospitals if they believe their relatives have
died as a result of poor care.''
Dr Machin said he did not want to comment on any litigation involving
Raigmore Hospital.

THE skies above a Scots town were being eagerly scanned yesterday as
locals prepared themselves for the coming of a trio of beings from
another place.
The threesome are set to reveal the reasons for the baffling number of
UFO sightings in the Falkirk area in recent years.
Their revelations will emerge at a meeting in Falkirk Town Hall
tonight.
One of their number, an American psychic, has promised to reveal the
secrets of the universe through her contact with a shadowy group named
the Council of Nine. It is claimed the Council of Nine is a group of
superbeings said to watch over mankind making sure it does not destroy
the planet.
Nearly 1000 people are set to cram into the hall, searching for an
explanation to strange sightings in their skies.
The village of Bonnybridge nearby has been dubbed Britain's UFO
capital after hundreds of sightings.
The Cosmic Agenda Lecture is the brainchild of local councillor Billy
Buchanan.
There was worldwide publicity for the conference when he was reported
to have said an alien called Zal-us would be the star guest. He later
denied he had been in contact with the alien.
However, greatest interest should be aroused by the lecture to be
given by psychic Phyllis Schlemmer.
A friend of Star Trek creator, the late Gene Rodenberry, she is due to
divulge revelations told to her by the Council of Nine.
Edinburgh UFO researcher Geri Rogers will also be beaming in to speak
to the capacity crowd.
Extr-terrestrial hunter Mr Ken MacFarlane from Cheshire, England, is
the third speaker.
Interest in the bizarre meeting has spread all over the world with UFO
fans from as far afield as Canada due to fly in.
There has also, of course, been a great deal of local interest.
One teenager, who claims to have seen a UFO soaring in the skies above
her home town, said she was hoping for answers.
Lisa Carr, 16, of Grangemouth, said: ''I saw strange lights hovering
in the sky about three months ago.''
Not everybody in Falkirk was convinced by the independent councillor.
Mr Joe Margiotti, 31, who works in a Falkirk camera shop, claimed the
lights spotted in the skies above were only model airplanes, not alien
space craft. He said: 'What these people don't realise is that there is
a model club in the area and they fly their planes at night.''
Ms Agnes McKay, 23, admitted she thought there could be something out
there but was baffled as to why alien visitors would want to come to
Falkirk.
Local UFO hunter Mr Malcolm Robinson of Strange Phenomena
Investigations says he would be attending the meeting but remains
sceptical as to what will be revealed.
Last night, Councillor Buchanan, who has spent months organising the
meeting, defended the controversial event.
''I'm delighted that the speakers are still prepared to come after all
the rubbish that was printed about this alien called Zal-us.''

<TEXT>
SINGER Cliff Richard's fame, after 30 years in show business, is out
of this world.
He is entitled to be over the moon, and owes the recognition to two of
his most devoted fans. Ms Pamela Gallan, 26, and Ms Amber Beattie, 31,
have paid #50 to have a star in the Cygnus constellation named after
their favourite entertainer to make his elevation to the knighthood
later this month.
''We just wanted to do something really special to mark the occasion,
something that nobody else had thought of,'' said Ms Gallan, a nannie,
of Hammerfield Avenue, Aberdeen.
The pair have been fans of Richard for more than 10 years. They
estimate that they have spent a total of about #10,000 on records and
memorabilia.
''The choice of constellation was easy. It had to be one visible to
the UK for most of the year and we chose Cygnus because it is shaped
like the cross of Christ,'' said Ms Gallan.
''We are both committed Christians and Cliff did play some part in
converting us to the faith. He's great at putting the message across
simply and clearly,'' added Ms Beattie, a technical assistant with BP.
Their bedrooms are shrines to the singer whom they have seen live
around 100 times, travelling the length and breadth of the country from
their Aberdeen homes.
''I've got eight or nine unissued discs worth around #300 a time and
I've bought all his British LPs and singles,'' added Ms Beattie, of Back
Hilton Road.
Although Richard will not have time to meet the two before his
investiture, Ms Beattie will travel Buckingham Palace in the hope of
catching a glimpse of him.
Other celebrities who have been given the star treatment by an adoring
public include Elvis Presley, Harrison Ford, and Marilyn Monroe.
The two women got the idea for the star from a magazine after spotting
the address of an American company offering the service.
The certificate of authentication is currently being framed for the
occasion and will be sent to Richard's office.
Now, after more than 30 years on top of the pops, Richard is about to
be on top of the world.
The International Star Registry lists all named stars along with their
co-ordinates in Your Place In The Cosmos. The book is updated every few
years and a copy is lodged with the British Library. No star can be
named more than once.

<HEADLINE>New group to lobby for M74 extension</HEADLINE>

A NUMBER of Scotland's key business organisations have formed a lobby
group advocating the building of the M74 motorway extension in the south
of Glasgow.
Glasgow District Council is to discuss granting permission for the
4.8-mile extension later this week. If built, the #250m road beside the
Glasgow to London railway line on the south side of the Clyde will
complete the motorway box ringing the city centre.
Calling themselves the M74 -- Complete to Compete group, Glasgow
Chamber of Commerce, the Glasgow Development Agency, and the CBI have
joined forces with Scottish Enterprise, the Lanarkshire Development
Agency, Renfrewshire Enterprise, and the electronics group Speed to
lobby the council and present its views to the public.
The group argues that the motorway is a vital segment in Scotland's
roads infrastructure. If planning permission is not granted, the
business community predicts Glasgow will lose out on inward investment.
It is also argued that the road is a necessary link to the city's
airport which last year failed to lure central belt passengers away from
Edinburgh Airport.
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive, Mr Geoff Runcie, said
yesterday that Scotland's business community had already put its case to
the council's planning department but wanted its views aired in public
given the level of recent debate on the plan.
He said: ''The M74 is the missing link in a chain that will release
the full potential of previous investments in this vital transport
infrastructure.
''Scotland demands an efficient transport infrastructure to compete on
an international level.''
Protest against the motorway from local residents and environmental
organisations has centred around fears over pollution and asthma and a
belief the motorway would simply induce more traffic.
The scheme also involves demolition of 100 commercial properties and
27 homes around Eglington Toll and has been prompted by Strathclyde
Regional Council in contradiction to the Labour Party's road building
moratorium.

FORMER gangland henchman ''Mad Frankie'' Fraser quipped he would
perform free dental work on any prison officers in the audience when his
one-man comedy show opened last night in London's East End.
Mr Fraser, nicknamed ''The Dentist'' in the 1960s for extracting teeth
from victims who had fallen behind with their debts, played before a
packed house at the Brick Lane Music Hall.
Insisting he was not nervous, he said: ''This must be better than
appearing at the Old Bailey. Court number one -- that was my stage. I'm
a bit disappointed, as the equivalent of court one should be the London
Palladium. But I suppose there's still time.
''I say I'm all heart. So if there are any police officers or former
prison governors in the audience I will pull their teeth for nothing.''
He added: ''They always called me The Dentist, although that's not
strictly true as I've never done fillings . . . only extractions.''
Actress Barbara Windsor, ex-wife of armed robber Ronnie Knight, who
was one of the celebrity guests at the show, wished Mr Fraser luck.
Posing for photographs before the show, Mr Fraser joked to a
journalist: ''If you're wearing stockings I can use one of them on my
head as if I was robbing.''
The two-hour show transferred from the Edinburgh Festival, where it
was a rated a success by critics.
In the 1960s, Mr Fraser was part of the infamous south London
Richardson Gang, which rivalled the east London empire of the Kray
twins.
He has 15 convictions, was certified insane three times, and once
tried to hang the governor of Parkhurst prison.
In the past year, he has sold 40,000 copies of his autobiography,
taken tea at the House of Commons, and developed a career as an
after-dinner speaker.
Although most of the theatre audience looked as if they were born
after Mr Fraser's heyday, they cheered and applauded.

Boulevard in Los Angeles.
The 29-year-old also told Mr William Cash, who shared a flat with her
during her own stays in Los Angeles, that she plans to become a Roman
Catholic.
Mr Cash, a journalist, said Miss Hurley now finds the house she and
Grant share outside Bath ''horrible'' because of the ease with which the
media approached it after Grant's arrest with the LA hooker.
''In Ireland you can buy a place that is surrounded by its own land
and not marred by footpaths, and for me that is going to make a huge
difference,'' Cash quotes her as telling him in Harpers &amp; Queen
magazine.
''I'm seriously considering moving to southern Ireland. I've always
loved Ireland. I am half Irish even though I don't know any of my Irish
relatives at all. Also because I'll be a very good Catholic, it will be
lovely to be in Ireland.''
Ireland has long been a favourite get-away place for Grant and Miss
Hurley, but Mr Cash said she was unwilling to speak for the Four
Weddings and a Funeral actor.
He writes: ''Whether they would want to buy the property together
would be another question.''

A 22-year-old man is expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today
in connection with the death of a 16-year-old Glasgow Academy pupil
following an incident at Bridgeton Cross in the city's East End.
Mark Scott of Newlands, Glasgow, died outside the Windsor Bar in
London Road about 5.15pm on Saturday.
The teenager, who had earlier attended the Celtic-Partick Thistle
match at Celtic Park, was the eldest of a family of five. His father, Mr
Niall Scott, is the managing partner with McGrigor Donald, one of
Scotland's leading legal firms.
Meanwhile, four other, unrelated deaths were being investigated in a
weekend of violent assaults across central Scotland.
Detectives in Edinburgh launched a murder investigation after a woman
was found dead in the docklands area of Leith at the weekend.
The woman's body was found at around 7.30am on Saturday on a footway
in West Bowling Green Street. She was named yesterday as Ms Christine
Dinnie, 40, who lived in the Craigmillar area.
They are appealing for witnesses. Detective Chief Inspector Ian
Jackson, of Lothian and Borders CID, said, information ''can be given in
confidence''.
He added: ''Death would appear to have been the result of a violent
assault.''
The victim is described as small but heavy build with brown
shoulder-length hair. She was wearing black shoes, a black mini-skirt, a
pale yellow round-neck jersey, and a brown leather bomber-style jacket.
Central Scotland Police, meanwhile, said two men were expected to
appear at Falkirk Sheriff Court today in connection with two separate
deaths in the area early on Saturday.
Police said a man was in custody after a 25-year-old man died in an
incident in the village of Slamannan.
A 21-year-old man was also in custody after the body of a 25-year-old
man was found lying on a footpath in Main Street, Bainsford, Falkirk.
Two 20-year-old men were also detained in a serious condition in
hospital last night after alleged assaults in Glasgow and Paisley.
Police said a 44-year-old man was expected to appear at Glasgow
Sheriff Court today after Mr Daniel O'Neill, of Knightswood, Glasgow,
was allegedly assaulted in Lincoln Avenue, Knightswood, early yesterday.
A 21-year-old man is expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court today
after Mr Gordon English, from Paisley, was allegedly assaulted in the
town's Bridge Street early yesterday.
A 25-year-old man is also expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court
today in connection with the death of Mr Andrew Browne, 36, who was
found dead in his home at Logan Drive in the town's Ferguslie Park
estate on Friday.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson said yesterday that Alan
Howarth's move was a huge boost to New Labour and a body blow to the
Tories.
Mr Robertson claimed that it underlined the fact that the Government
was ''out of touch and on its last legs''.
He said Mr Howarth's move was far from being isolated and that, in
Scotland, New Labour was attracting support from left and right
factions, as well as from the Scottish National Party.
But SNP leader Alex Salmond used Mr Howarth's move as much to lambast
Labour as the Tories. He said it had left the Government and the Tory
party in a ''state of total and utter chaos''.
''Having had their slim majority reduced by the SNP in the Perth and
Kinross by-election, this defection further erodes it to just five,'' Mr
Salmond said.
Mr Salmond said the defection said as much about the right-wing nature
of Labour as it did about the ''chaos'' of the Tories.
The SNP leader added: ''When a political associate of Michael Forsyth
can join New Labour, it is clear that Tony Blair has succeeded in
'out-Torying' the Tories.''
''Rather than reassuring people north of the Border, this news is
likely to set alarm bells ringing all over Scotland about the rootless,
right-wing nature of the Labour Party..''

SENIOR Scottish Conservatives were united in the their surprise and
disappointment yesterday at Alan Howarth's defection.
One MP pondered at whether there was a ''hidden agenda''. It was also
suggested that it was ''a fraud'' that Mr Howarth should remain in his
Stratford-upon-Avon seat and that he had ''cheated'' Conservative voters
who returned him at the General Election with a thumping majority.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth spoke of his ''sadness'' at the
MP's decision.
Mr Forsyth said Mr Howarth, a former public school headmaster, was a
personal friend who was ''actually quite a thoughtful, intelligent
person''.
He and Mr Forsyth were founder members of the No Turning Back group --
a group of MPs who supported Margaret Thatcher and the views of
so-called Thatcherism.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Eye to Eye programme yesterday, Mr
Forsyth said: ''At the end of the day, MPs are flesh and blood, and they
have to do what they think is right.
''My only sadness is that he has clearly done it in a way, and timed
it in a way, to cause much embarrassment to the people who have
supported him over the years. I think that really is rather unfortunate
and rather a sad way to end his career in the Conservative Party.''
The Scottish Secretary said he believed the Government could still
survive its full five-year term if John Major believed that was what was
in the best interests of the country, despite only having a majority of
five seats.
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Party, said he was ''extremely disappointed'' at Mr Howarth's action.
Sir Michael said: ''When I was in the House of Commons, Alan Howarth
was well to the right of me. I am surprised that he feels his place is
now in the Labour Party.
''I am also extremely disappointed that he is not doing the honourable
thing and resigning his seat to fight it in a by-election.''
Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for Tayside North, who himself has
experienced some friction with the party's hierarchy over his stance on
constitutional matters, also expressed surprise at Mr Howarth's
decision.
Mr Walker said: 'I find it astonishing and incredible that anyone who
has been a member of the No Turning Back group can find Labour, even the
so-called New Labour, acceptable.
''I just cannot see how the views of the No Turning Back group can in
any way be anything close to the views of the Labour Party and
Socialism.
''Therefore I can only assume Mr Howarth's decision has been based on
an agenda which has not yet been revealed.''
Former Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro, Conservative MP for
Dumfries, was equally vociferous.
He said: ''One of the great strengths of the Conservative Party is
loyalty. I am most disappointed that Mr Howarth should have defected to
the Labour Party.''
Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch, the Conservative MP for
Kincardine and Deeside, shared the feelings of his Scottish colleagues.
''I am obviously very disappointed that Mr Howarth has felt the need
to do this in such a cowardly fashion,'' Mr Kynoch said.
''I would have thought that, if he really felt the way he has said he
felt today, the proper way to go about it would be to resign from the
Commons and face a by-election.''
Mr Kynoch added: ''He has a huge obligation to his constituency, but
he doesn't seem to have paid any attention to that obligation.''

The Herald examines one of the most significant switches of allegiance
for years and its implications for the Government.
Our Parliamentary Correspondent Stephen McGregor unearths a remarkable
change of heart
THE most remarkable thing about the defection of Tory MP Alan Howarth
to Labour is that here is a man who came into the Conservative ranks at
Westminster with impeccable right-wing credentials and went on to add to
them in spades during his party career.
Consider this for a CV: educated at Rugby and King's College,
Cambridge, where he read history; research assistant to Field Marshall
Montgomery; private secretary to the chairman of the Conservative Party;
director of the Conservative Research Department.
Not bad for starters, but let us move on. Vice-chairman of the
Conservative party, Parliamentary Private Secretary, Government whip,
and Education Minister.
In short, Mr Howarth has been steeped in the Conservative ranks at the
very highest level for years, and now what does he do? If there are few
surprises left in life, his decision to join the Labour Party is
certainly one of them.
He entered Parliament in 1983 and quickly was seen as one of the new
breed of Thatcherite right-wingers. Never a firebrand at the dispatch
box, he always took a measured, argumentative approach, somewhat
reminiscent of one of his mentors and one of the people likely to feel
most let down by his defection, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Competition quickly developed on the Tory Right at this time, with Mr
Forsyth and the now Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley vying for the
championship, but Mr Howarth was in there pitching, arguing for some
very right-wing principles, and being spotted by the Thatcher hierarchy
as one to watch.
A former merchant banker, he followed another of his mentors, Dr
Rhodes Boyson, into the Education Department, where he quickly earned a
reputation as a middle-class intellectual and a pioneer of student loans
and opting out. He was thought to be anti-union, especially
anti-teachers' unions, which makes his advocacy now of the teachers'
cause all the more remarkable.
So what went wrong? Some observers claim that his move reflects much
of his own emotional turmoil, particularly that he has been distressed
the Government has not done enough for the disabled. He has a son who is
handicapped and who has campaigned actively for greater Government
support, and he appears to have been concerned for some time that the
Government's attitude is uncaring.
He was, for example, a supporter of the Labour-inspired Civil Rights
Disability Bill.
He separated from his wife, Gillian, last February, and friends have
been quoted as saying that they had spotted for some time a growing
disillusionment with the Government as his domestic problems increased.
The real reason, however, may be even more deep-seated. Mr Howarth, by
all accounts, enjoyed his time at the Education Department, where he was
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State from 1989 until 1992. He had been
expecting promotion, but instead one of his key responsibilities,
science, was taken away from him and he resigned to return to the back
benches, fulfilling a role only as a member of the Select Committee on
National Heritage.
This clearly is the point at which he began his intellectual
adjustment from what might be described as the hard right of the
Conservative Party to the soft left, and thence to full-blown advocacy
of Mr Tony Blair's New Labour, one-nation vision of Socialism.
In his time on the Conservative back benches after 1992, he was not
regarded as a problem to the leadership in the way that, for example,
the Euro-sceptics such as Mr Bill Cash or the anti-Majorites such as Mr
Tony Marlow were, but in the background and in his mind, he was going
through as great a political sea-change as one could imagine, and was
beginning to believe that the policies he once advocated with enthusiasm
were not producing the kind of Britain he wanted to see.
In a way, one feels that he possibly would have been more comfortable
in the Conservative Party of Lord Whitelaw -- always a brake on the
worst excesses of Thatcherism -- or Sir Edward Heath, than in the brave
new rightist dawn of the likes of Mr Michael Portillo or Mr Stephen
Dorrell. Perhaps he arrived at Westminster about 10 years too late for
his own conscience.
Either way, the right has lost someone it once saw as a leading
advocate of its cause, and one of the principal consequences of his
decision to cross the floor of the House is likely to be that others on
the Tory right will begin to reassess their standpoint.
They may decide that he is a one-off and that what is needed is more
radicalism, but Mr Howarth by his bold move -- ''rather than heal the
divisions in our society, the Conservative Party is deepening them'' --
will at the very least have provided food for thought.
He is essentially a quiet, thoughtful man -- perhaps his nearest
equivalent on the Labour benches would be the likes of Mr Frank Field --
but the days when he warned Mrs Thatcher to hold fast against calls for
rising expenditure, said teachers would be better represented by a joint
teaching council than unions which imported methods alien to the
profession, and urged restraint in subsidies to agriculture, industry,
transport, and the arts are clearly over.
Just one year ago, as the Tories were heading for their Bournemouth
conference, Mr Howarth warned in a newspaper article that the
Conservatives must stop pandering to the ''retributive'' right.
He wrote: ''The left-right divide is less and less relevant in our
emerging politics,'' and went on: ''Competitiveness, discipline,
independence, and responsibility -- goals identified by Margaret
Thatcher and now common to all parties -- need to be pursued in ways
that appeal to moderate opinion and the British sense of fairness.''
Only three months ago, he dropped a broad hint about his feelings
after Mr John Major had been re-elected party leader. He said: ''The
party should from now on worry less about differentiating itself from
Labour, and more about finding convincing ways to address the problems
that face all parties in an unstable, insecure world.''
He is said to be a keen runner, taking part in the London Marathon in
1985, but all he has to do now is walk a few feet across the Commons
chamber to sit on the other side. The most chilling thought he leaves
behind for his former colleagues on the Tory benches is his reckoning
that between 30 and 40 of them now share his views. Will more follow his
lead?

University of Strathclyde lecturer Dr Malcolm Dickson makes no bones
about the fact that something momentous has happened in British party
politics
THE decision by Mr Alan Howarth to defect to Labour is quite the most
remarkable U-turn in British politics during the Conservatives' 16 years
in government.
Forget past policy U-turns, forget the ERM crisis. When a leading Tory
MP, considered to be associated with the right, ditches his party and
joins the ranks of the opposition, something momentous is happening.
It is quite simply this, in a week that has also seen a former Tory
chairman, Sir Norman Tebbit, backing Labour leader Mr Tony Blair with
his so-called deal with BT, there is now clearer evidence of what many
have suspected over the past year, namely the Labour party is no longer
claiming to be a party of the left, but is really a party of the centre.
Mr Howarth's description of Labour as the party of ''one nation''
shows just how much has changed. Mr Blair must have been disappointed at
being somewhat relegated last week after the O J Simpson verdict, but he
must surely have realised the devastating impact Mr Howarth's decision
would have on the Tory conference this week in Blackpool. It has now
emerged that Mr Blair and Mr Howarth had been in constant touch for more
than a fortnight.
But what of the implications for Mr Major's troops in Blackpool. The
timing of this high-level defection could not have come at a worse
moment. For the first time in three years, the Conservatives were
preparing to go into their conference in a positive frame of mind. This
summer had seen the leadership issue resolved and with it an apparent
return to a united front.
In the polls, the Tories have benefited. Over the last two months,
there has been clear evidence in Gallup, Mori and ICM surveys that the
Tories had bottomed out at about 21%, and have probably recovered to
around 26%.
Adjusting for problems in measuring Tory support in opinion polls,
there was even a possibility that support had once again reached 30%. So
there seemed to be a glimmer of hope for Mr Major.
However, the news of a former founding member of the Thatcherite ''No
Turning Back'' group defecting to Labour has smashed all pretence of a
truce in the internal battles within the Conservative ranks. The Tories
now face a bleak week in Blackpool with any hope of using the conference
platform as a building block to further strengthen a Conservative
revival now sunk in very muddy ground.
Of course, the implications of Mr Howarth's decision will spill over
into the new parliamentary term as well, ensuring more difficulties for
the Tories ahead. The Conservative majority is now reduced to five, and
with it goes really any hope of steering legislation through the Commons
this year that is even remotely controversial or detailed.
The problem here is serious for the Conservatives. Mr Howarth has
suggested the Government is directionless and without vision. Many
voters agree. Yet the Conservatives cannot hope to build a new vision
without a good working majority and major pieces of legislation.
It would only take three by-elections this coming parliamentary year
(less than the average number) to reduce the Government to a minority
administration. It is almost certain that Mr Major had hoped to ride
things out to the last possible moment in spring 1997. That now seems an
even more difficult timetable. This parliamentary year has therefore
become even more crucial. Yet the reliance on old Tory foundations such
as tax cuts are unlikely to bring back the necessary level of support.
Mr Howarth is a respected and intelligent parliamentarian. Someone of
his standing does not make a decision such as this lightly. Yes, it may
well be eccentric in terms of the history of adversarial politics in
Britain, but it loses none of its significance for that. In yesterday's
Observer, an ICM poll showed that 64% of Tory voters still thought the
Tory party was divided. That was before Mr Howarth made his decision.
There is, of course, some danger for the Labour party in all of this
too. Although this past Labour conference week has shown the left of the
party membership to be more isolated than ever before, there is a danger
that Mr Blair's courting of right may mean isolation for many left-wing
voters.
Although, in electoral terms, this may not be a great danger yet, as
many of such voters are in safe Labour seats, there is a possibility
that Mr Blair's New Labour may be beginning to make the same mistake as
the Conservatives ultimately have.
During the 1980s, Mrs Thatcher rigorously nurtured a small cross
section of British voters, enough to build a power base. This has
ultimately failed, but Mr Blair's shift of emphasis to concentrating on
those self-same voters may in the long run sew the seeds of his own
downfall. Mr Howarth has concluded that Labour is the ''one nation''
party. Many on the traditional left, and in strong Labour areas such as
Wales and Scotland, would hesitate to agree.

The Prime Minister: ''I have spent three years urging the party to

has been like spitting in the wind. The Prime Minister, if he had wanted
to engage me in discussion . . . could have done so at any stage. Not
only he, but other senior Ministers have simply been unwilling to engage
in debate with me.''
Arms sales: ''I do not think it is right and proper for this country to
try to earn its living by saturating poor parts of the world with
weapons of destruction.''
Tory policy: ''During the three years since I came out of the
Government I have argued that the Conservative Party should return to
the 'one nation tradition'. Tragically, the party has moved the other
way.''
The poor: ''They have not shared as they should have in the nation's
wealth and are made to feel the objects of indifference or even contempt
by too many Tories.''
Tax cuts: ''The Conservative Party is clamouring for tax cuts for the
comfortably off while teachers are being sacked because schools are
inadequately funded.''
Foreign policy: ''Hostile and discriminatory attitudes to foreigners
and minorities exist in a wholly unacceptable way in the party.''
Labour: ''New Labour has an immense amount to offer this country. It
is characterised by a passionate concern for social justice, a
generosity of view, and an opitimism about human nature which, sadly, I
find lacking in today's Conservative Party.''

TORY defector Mr Alan Howarth met the Prime Minister in London
yesterday to tell him the reasons for his decision.
Talking to reporters later, he explained the timing of his
announcement by saying it would have been hypocritical of him to attend
this week's Tory conference after deciding to switch to Labour.
Mr Howarth returned home to his farmhouse in his Stratford-upon-Avon
constituency after meeting Mr John Major yesterday morning.
He told reporters outside his home he was disappointed not to have
been able to talk to Mr Major on Saturday night before news of his
decision became public.
He said: ''The decision didn't please him at all, but at the same time
he was very courteous. It was a mutually respectful and mutually
friendly conversation.
''I greatly regret we were unable to speak to each other before it
became public. It was not for lack of trying.''
He said they spoke about the timing of his decision, the day before
the Conservative Party conference opens in Blackpool.
Mr Howarth said: ''I explained it was precisely because of the
Conservative Party conference that my mind was finally concentrated.
Having made the decision to join the Labour Party, if I had gone to
Blackpool, it would have been a complete hypocrisy.''
Mr Howarth had been due to hold a debate with Mr John Redwood about
the future of the Conservative Party during the conference.
''I think the audience, listening to the speech would have asked 'Why
aren't you in the Labour Party?'. I think I have anticipated their
question,'' he said.
Mr Howarth has not yet made clear whether he will stand for Labour in
his own constituency, where he won a majority of nearly 23,000 at the
last election.
''There are formalities that need to be pursued and I hope very much
that my application for membership (of the Labour Party) will be
accepted,'' he said.
''But it is far too soon to talk about where I will stand. Of course,
I hope I will be able to find a Labour seat.''
Mr Howarth, 51, who separated from his wife earlier this year, has
four children, Catherine, 21, Sophie, 20, James, 18, and Charlie, 10. He
says they all knew of his move and were supportive.
Charlie is disabled and Mr Howarth said this had helped direct his
mind against particular Conservative policies.
''Charlie was born in 1985 and there is no doubt that my experience as
a parent of a disabled child has been a deepening one,'' he said. ''It
has been a great joy to me and also a great sadness that anybody should
be disabled.
''I feel passionately and no doubt with intensified passion because of
that experience. I am disappointed that the Conservative Party has been
as equivocal as it has about civil rights for disabled people.
''Legislation has not been based on the assumption that we ought to
legislate comprehensively so that the social causes of all types of
disability are removed. I am disappointed that the Tory Party has held
back,'' he said.
He added that Tory education policies, and particularly their effect
in Warwickshire, had also helped him make his decision.

THE local Conservative association of renegade MP Alan Howarth
yesterday expressed anger and astonishment at his defection to Labour
and said it would work to find a new candidate for Stratford-on-Avon.
After a 90-minute meeting yesterday, association chairman Mr Don
Rushton said: ''It is with extreme regret that we have received last
night the news that Alan Howarth has chosen to switch his political
allegiance in such a dramatic manner on the eve of the Conservative
Party conference and not have the courage of his own convictions to
resign his seat.
''We are disappointed that Alan discourteously chose to reveal his
decision through a Sunday newspaper and not through prior consultation
with his constituency association chairman, agent, or officers, with
whom he has worked for many years.
''We are astonished that Alan, a former Government Minister, has
chosen to join the Labour Party when only a short time ago he had been
so fervent in his support for John Major and, indeed, the Conservative
policies.''
Mr Rushton refused to answer any further questions about Mr Howarth's
future.
Stalwart Conservative voters in the town reacted angrily to Mr
Howarth's switch to the Labour Party, while others saw the step as
courageous.

Does the Howarth defection reveal politics turning upside down? Jimmy
Reid gives his view of the red rose party under Tony Blair
TONY Blair is a Tory. His New Labour is New Tory. Months ago, I wrote
in The Herald that John Major faced a phenomenon unknown to his
predecessors: a leader of the Labour Party politically further to the
right than the leader of the Conservative Party.
Think of the events of the past seven days. Alan Howarth, Tory MP for
Stratford-on-Avon, a Thatcher Minister, an acknowledged right-winger
within the Tory party, joins New Labour, and will sit on New Labour's
benches. Is he a convert to democratic socialism? No, Mr Howarth hasn't
changed. Labour has.
New Labour represents his traditional Tory values, so he claims. Mr
Blair welcomes him into his ranks just as he kicked out Liz Davies, the
elected Labour candidate for a Leeds constituency. In New Labour,
right-wing Tories are welcome and Socialists are shown the door.
Last Thursday, Sir David English, Thatcher's darling, chairman of
Associated Newspapers, owners of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, and
London Evening Standard, revealed that he had had talks with Viscount
Rothermere, the proprietor, about whether they should support Mr Blair
at the General Election. Sir David gushes that lunches with a leader of
the Labour Party suddenly became ''much more fun''. I bet it did.
The Daily Mail was the paper that printed the Zinoviev letter which
purported to show that a Labour Government would be a pawn of Bolshevik
Russia. This was published on the very eve of the 1924 General Election,
and brought about the defeat of the first Labour Government. After the
election, the Daily Mail admitted that the Zinoviev letter was a
forgery.
The Daily Mail was the Fleet Street paper that hailed Hitler as the
saviour of Europe and had kind words for his agents here in Britain,
Oswald Mosley's black-shirts. The Daily Mail hasn't changed. It has
supported every extreme right-wing movement in Britain. It hates
democratic Socialism. It hates the organised working class movement for
enabling workers to get off their knees. Its readers favour law and
order. Mr Blair scavenges for votes among them.
His speech to Labour's conference was an example of the art of saying
nothing, with a spurious gravitas. A classic of this genre was John
Kennedy's declaration: ''Ask not what your country can do for you, but
what you can do for your country.'' It sounds great but doesn't mean a
bloody thing. It didn't stop the rich fiddling their taxes? Nor the poor
claiming social security, and why shouldn't they? It was just high
falutin' verbal guff.
Mr Blair's blanket generalisations carried no commitment about
anything except for a few tenacious specifics. He said that in the event
of privatisation, New Labour would make British Rail publicly owned and
publicly accountable. It sounded Socialist, something that otherwise
seemed alien at Brighton last week. Now it's doubtful if the Tories will
be able to privatise the railways before the election for it is a
shambles. Highly unpopular even among Tories.
Paddy Ashdown at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow just a few
weeks ago urged Mr Blair to join him in a pledge to re-nationalise rail,
if the Tories did manage to privatise it. This, Mr Ashdown asserted,
would dissuade people from buying BR's assets and virtually guarantee
our railway industry would not be privatised, at least in the short
term. In other words, Mr Blair was promising to do something that
sounded leftish but wouldn't have to be done. Why didn't he promise to
take back into public ownership British Telecom or the water companies
in England?
Then he told us, as if it was the coup of the century, that he had a
deal with BT, which transpired to be not so much a deal as an
understanding. BT is the biggest utility to be privatised. Its politics
are reflected by the appointment to the board of Lord Tebbit, a man who
urged the unemployed to ''get on their bikes'', and advocated the
''Cricket Test'' by which ethnic minorities in Britain could prove they
were pukka English by their enthusiasm for the English cricket team.
Mr Blair has promised BT that a New Labour government would guarantee
it access to the home entertainment market. The Conservative Government
imposed this restriction on BT to prevent it becoming a giant monopoly
in this, completely dominating the market. In return, Mr Blair was given
a pledge that BT would link schools, colleges, libraries, and hospitals
to the superhighway for nothing. This was no coup, but the bargain of
the century for BT.
On this issue, as on others, when you examine what lies beneath Mr
Blair's rhetoric, you find he is further to the right than Mr Major.
Rupert Murdoch is having talks with BT chief Sir Iain Vallance about
forming an alliance to dominate Britain's information highway. A Blair
government would let them build a nationwide cable network and Mr
Murdoch's worldwide empire would provide the programmes.
Mr Blair has had lunches with Mr Murdoch, met and spoken to his
executives on an offshore island in Australasia. It is likely that the
Murdoch papers, particularly the Sun, will support Mr Blair at the next
election. It makes sense if you're Rupert Murdoch.
No wonder Lord Tebbit is applauding Mr Blair. It stinks.
New Labour hasn't re-defined Socialism for the millennium, it has
abandoned every principle that Labour has ever stood for. Mr Blair talks
in the first person. I will do this, I will do that, as if the Labour
Party was his personal fiefdom. Dissent is crushed whether it be Roy
Harttersley or Liz Davies.
The leader now appoints the party whip. He wants to appoint the Shadow
Cabinet. He rides roughshod over the NEC and the Shadow Cabinet. He has
contempt for the mass organisations of the Labour movement. When two
Westminster career politicians got together to stitch up a deal on the
composition of a dissolved parliament for Scotland without consulting
the other partners in the Constitutional Convention, particularly the
STUC, this was Blairism at work.
The STUC was campaigning for a parliament for Scotland in the 1960s
when the Labour Party was anti-devolutionist. The STUC protested at
being presented with a fait accompli and Mr Blair called its leaders
immature. His ignorance of Labour's principles and the philosophy of
democratic socialism is only exceeded by his arrogance.
New Labour will probably win the next election. Labour would have done
so with John Smith as leader. A Blair government will, I fear, destroy
the Labour Party. An attractive proposition for the long term interests
of Sir David English, Rupert Murdoch, and their likes, but not for the
rest of us.

Alan Howarth's decision to defect on the eve of Blackpool can be no
coincidence, says The Herald's Political Editor, Geoffrey Parkhouse
ALAN Howarth has not just abandoned the Tories for Labour. He has
deliberately set out to destroy their chances of recovery for a General
Election. His intention is to poison their ''fight back'' conference,
starting today.
The timing of his announcement yesterday, having discussed his
defection with Mr Blair way back on September 26, is calculated to abort
signs of a Tory recovery. Naturally, the Tories see this as the worst
betrayal, one that nullifies his claim to be acting on principle.
No party likes a turncoat, and the party receiving the new allegiance
is always suspicious of it. The Tories are going to hate this one, and
they hotly deny Mr Howarth's imputation that there are 30 others who are
tempted to cross the floor of the Commons. Had he made his move last
year, this might have been the case.
Acting as he has, however, is more likely to cause other Tory MPs to
shrink from emulating him. The moderates are appalled by his timing, and
the right wing is outraged by this ex-Thatcherite going over to
Socialism, even ''new'' Socialism.
The Labour leadership, of course, welcomes his defection and regards
it as an astonishing boon as the media moves from its party conference
in Brighton to the Tory one in Blackpool. But left-wingers are bemused,
and the hard left alarmed. The miners' leader, Arthur Scargill, declared
yesterday that the move is the other way. Mr Howarth has not joined a
party of the left, he said, but Mr Blair has transformed the Labour into
a party of the right.
Nothing highlights Labour policy shifts so vividly as a devotee of
Lady Thatcher's lining up with them. By the same token, Majorism (or the
''new'' Majorism) is made that much more distinct from the days of the
poll tax, despite the fact that Mr Howarth had already defected from
Thatcher.
Mr Major is clearly set on treating this as another of political
life's bizarre events. ''Nothing will distract us from the task ahead,''
he said. ''We have an election to win and we intend to win it.'' Perhaps
if Mr Major had granted him an interview before the summer, this could
have been avoided. But one suspects that, if he had told the Chief Whip,
Mr Alastair Goodlad (or his predecessor, Sir Richard Ryder) of his
intentions, he would have been in to see the Prime Minister quick
enough.
Instead of this, Mr Blair was the first to know; and in plenty of time
for him to turn it to devastating propaganda against the Tory
conference. Mr Howarth's unfortunate constituency party in
Stratford-upon-Avon, which delivered him a solid 22,892 majority in
1992, had to learn that he was abandoning it from the press. He is now
looking for a Labour candidature elsewhere.
There will be plenty of talk about Howarth at Blackpool, but I shall
be surprised to find any ''me-tooism''. It will be written off at the
conference as an eccentric act, a one-week wonder. Back at the Commons
on October 16, Labour will gloat for a while. The Tory retort: ''You are
welcome to him. Watch your backs.''
* Mr Howarth is thought to be the first Conservative MP to move to
Labour but defections from one political party to another, though rare,
are not unknown.
There have been about 70 defections in the last 60 years.
One Tory MP and 27 Labour defected to the Social Democratic Party when
it was founded in 1981. But the most famous defector was Sir Winston
Churchill, who switched from Conservative to Liberal as MP for Oldham in
1904.

FETTES College in Edinburgh yesterday confirmed that a former pupil
had raised a court action claiming #20,000 damages for his alleged
treatment by staff before being expelled for drug offences.
Mr James Delesclefs, now 18, from Edinburgh, is also seeking an
apology, backdated interest, and the costs of the action against the
headmaster, Mr Malcolm Thyne, three housemasters and the board of
governors.
The college, which yesterday held its annual open day and whose old
boys include Labour Leader Tony Blair, has until Friday to respond to
the action at the Court of Session.
Mr Thyne said in a statement: ''I can confirm that an action has been
raised against the school. Fettes denies any liability, and the action
will be vigorously defended.''
The action relates to circumstances leading up to Mr Delesclefs's
expulsion in 1992. He is believed to be complaining about the way he was
treated by staff as they tried to get him to agree to confess to smoking
marijuana. Five other boys were expelled at the same time for similar
offences.
Mr Delesclefs was not available for comment yesterday.
Allegations of bullying involving pupils and masters were made by a
number of parents of former pupils in the Scotsman newspaper on the
college's founder's day in July. Mr Thyne denied them, and said they
were linked to a campaign which had been waged against the school
following expulsions in 1992.

POLTICAL thriller writer Michael Dobbs has demanded his name be erased
from the list of credits which will accompany the forthcoming television
adaptation of one of his books.
The move is in protest at the BBC's treatment of his work, The Final
Cut.
Mr Dobbs has protested that the portrayal of what he said could only
be interpreted as the state funeral of Baroness Thatcher in the opening
episode was in ''appalling taste''. The scene does not feature in his
novel.
The former Tory Party deputy chairman said he wanted to dissociate
himself from the programme after the BBC admitted it had not responded
to some of his criticisms.
He had also objected to the emphasis given to anti-hero Francis
Urquhart's condemnation of Lady Thatcher, and the portrayal of thuggish
British Army actions in Cyprus.
Mr Dobbs said the BBC's adaptation did not reflect the tone of his
book at all.
''The BBC has the contractual right to put on screen its own
interpretation of an author's work: in doing so, I believe it has a
corresponding professional responsibility to honour the spirit of the
original work. Authors have rights too.
''As an author, I must have the right to have a good old stand-up
professional disagreement with the BBC.
''This is categorically not a matter of party politics or
personalities, but an argument about the best way for authors and the
BBC to collaborate in order to produce the best in television drama.''
The Final Cut is the third in a trilogy. The House of Cards and To
Play The King, charting Urquhart's political rise, were also adapted by
the BBC. The Final Cut, the first episode of which is due to be screened
on November 5, takes up the story 10 years later.
A BBC spokesnan said editorial control rested with the BBC, adding:
''Michael Dobbs has been consulted throughout the making, and he will
have his own views about the way the book has been transferred to the
screen.
''You have to keep this in perspective. The Final Cut is a piece of
fictional hokum.''
Referring to the funeral scene, the spokesman said: ''People might
conclude it is Thatcher, but at no point do we say it is Thatcher's
funeral.''

<HEADLINE>Offices pass buck as munitions wash up on Scottish coastline</HEADLINE>

Offices pass the buck
THREE Government departments spent last night passing the buck as
police, coastguards, and bomb disposal experts tried to remove
potentially lethal munitions from the Ayrshire, Clyde, and Argyll
coastlines.
Up to 900 phosphorous sticks have been washed up on popular beaches
during the past three days, leaving communities fearful that children or
unwary adults may be badly injured or even killed by the explosion of a
device.
However, staff at the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), and the Scottish Office were
last night absolving themselves of responsibility for investigating the
underwater source of the munitions.
The MoD blamed MAFF; a MAFF spokeswoman said responsibility lay with
the MoD and the Scottish Office; and the Scottish Office said it was
primarily a matter for the MoD and MAFF.
Even Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, an energetic campaigner on a
broad range of issues in recent months, was playing it low-profile last
night. A spokesman said: ''The Secretary of State does not feel it
appropriate to comment on this.''
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that the most likely source of the
latest devices washed ashore is not Beaufort's Dyke, the deep trench in
the Irish Sea between Stranraer and Belfast which is known to house
thousands of tons of nuclear waste and chemical weapons and munitions
from the Second World War.
A Clyde Coastguard spokesman said tidal patterns, combined with the
fact that not all beaches had been affected, meant that blaming the Dyke
was ''a dangerous assumption''.
He suggested the devices may have leaked out of a munitions dump east
of Arran, one of several in the area which is identified on Admiralty
charts.
Nonetheless, Friends of the Earth Scotland warned yesterday that the
munitions outbreak could become ''the next Brent Spar'' as an issue of
global environmental concern.
Police, bomb disposal experts, the coastguard, firefighters and
council officials worked over the weekend to clear the hazardous
cylinders. Up to 900 had been recovered last night on the north Ayrshire
shore between Largs and Stevenston and on the islands of Arran and
Cumbrae.
Superintendent John Young said the number of washed-up devices had
dwindled during the weekend. But he warned that police would need help
if the problem persisted. And he said officers would contact all the
relevant authorities, including Government departments, to plan a future
strategy.
He said: ''Until now it has been a reactive strategy because we were
concerned with the numbers being washed up on the beach. We are getting
reports of fewer devices now, but we need to look at the longer term and
develop a pro-active strategy.
''While we have a responsibility to look into all matters of concern,
I think there will be a multi-agency investigation.
''So far, everyone involved has been marvellous. The operation put in
place since Friday has been absolutely appropriate to the circumstances
and successful in every respect.
''Every device has either been destroyed under controlled conditions
or has burnt out itself after being spotted and marked. But we are still
concerned, and that is why we are continuing with searches of the area.
We will carry on with that until we are as sure as we can be that no
more are being washed up.
''It has been a mammoth operation already, but the problem we now face
is trying to find any devices hidden in rocks or seaweed. We can clear
one ton of kelp only to find another ton in its place after the next
high tide.''
He said the police would need the help of local authorities and other
agencies if the operation continued at the same level.
Superintendent Young added: ''It is not unusual for military parts or
munitions to be washed up on the Ayrshire coast, but they are usually
inert. It is the first time we have dealt with anything in these
numbers, and I was surprised it was concentrated in a relatively small
area.''
He said there had been no reports of damage or injuries to members of
the public or those involved in the clean-up operation.

Howarth explains move to Labour under a barrage of attacks from former
colleagues.
THE Tory high command launched an urgent damage limitation exercise
last night after former Minister Alan Howarth's decision to join Labour,
a body blow to the party on the eve of its conference.
Angry Tory leaders moved to sideline Mr Howarth, accusing him of being
vindictive, misguided, and out of touch after he stunned the party by
his move. It has cut the Government's Commons majority to just five.
The Prime Minister insisted the Government would not be blown off
course.
A clearly shaken Mr Major said he was ''very sorry'' about Mr
Howarth's decision. ''I profoundly disagree with his analysis of the
Conservative Party, but nothing will distract us from the task ahead. We
have an election to win, and we intend to win it.''
Mr Major said: ''I have spoken to Alan Howarth. I'm very sorry at his
decision. I believe it was a mistake and I believe he will come to see
it as a mistake.''
Mr Howarth said: ''The decision didn't please him at all but at the
same time he was very courteous. It was a mutually respectful and
mutually friendly conversation.''
Labour was understandably delighted by its propaganda coup. Deputy
party leader John Prescott hailed it as a devastating blow for Mr Major
on the eve of the Tory conference, stating that Mr Howarth could not
''stomach the Tory Party lurching further and further to the right''.
However, Education Secretary Gillian Shephard, launching the most
outspoken attack on Mr Howarth, said the MP had made a ''vindictive
decision'' timed to cause the party maximum damage.
Tory chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney denounced the renegade MP's ''slide''
across the political spectrum as ''eccentric'' and ''bizarre''. He
added: ''He is MP for Stratford, Shakespeare country, and I suspect
William Shakespeare probably summed it up when he wrote Much Ado About
Nothing.''
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said Mr Howarth had lost his political way,
and Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine said the MP was ''out of
touch with what the public want''.
At his 200-year-old farmhouse in South Warwickshire, Mr Howarth said
he was disappointed not to have been able to talk to Mr Major on
Saturday night before the news became public.
He explained the timing of his announcement by saying it would have
been hypocritical of him to attend the conference after deciding to
switch to Labour.
''I explained it was precisely because of the Conservative Party
conference that my mind was finally concentrated. Having made the
decision to join the Labour Party if I had gone to Blackpool it would
have been a complete hypocrisy,'' he said.
Mr Howarth, 51, won a majority of nearly 23,000 as a Conservative at
the last election.
He separated from his wife earlier this year. They have four children.
His youngest son, Charlie, 10, is disabled and Mr Howarth said this had
helped direct his mind against particular Conservative policies.
He said he was ''disappointed that the Conservative Party has been as
equivocal as it has about civil rights for disabled people''.
He also said Tory education policies had helped him make his decision,
fearing ''redundancies with teachers and larger class sizes.'
He said the Government's ''arrogance of power'' was damaging
democracy, while Labour offered a commitment to social justice combined
with a clear-sighted understanding of the realities of governing.
The MP said on televison he had spent three years urging the party to
come back to its better self, but no notice had been taken. It had, he
said, been like spitting in the wind.
He said Mr Major and ''other senior Ministers, have simply been
unwilling to engage in debate with me, to the extent of not even
answering letters''.
On one occasion, he claimed, he had written to the Prime Minister but
had not received a reply for six months.
The MP also had protested to the Ministry of Defence about arms sales.
He said: ''I do not think it is proper for this country to try to earn
its living by saturating poor parts of the world with weapons of
destruction. I simply got a brush-off.''
Pressed on whether other Tory MPs could follow him and defect to
Labour, Mr Howarth said: ''There are perhaps 30 or 40 backbench
Conservative MPs who I suspect broadly share my views.''
Mr Howarth made clear he would not resign and fight a by-election, but
would remain as an MP until the next election, which he hoped to contest
as a Labour candidate in another seat.
Despite his explanations on the timing, his decision has cast a heavy
cloud over Mr Major's planned relaunch conference in Blackpool, and also
has exposed divisions on the Tory left just as the Prime Minister hoped
he had quelled rebellion on the right.
Another former Minister, Mr Jim Lester, who has expressed unease about
Government policy, said that while he would not be crossing the Commons
floor himself, he understood Mr Howarth's thinking. ''One shares many of
his instincts as far as the Conservative Party is concerned,'' he said.
''I don't think he is a one-off in what he is trying to put over.''

Attack puts peace talks in jeopardy
BOSNIAN Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic threatened to call off peace
talks with separatist Serb rebels last night after a cluster bomb fired
at a Muslim refugee camp killed at least six people and wounded dozens.
The incident, near the United Nations-declared ''safe area'' in Tuzla,
was thought to be the worst single attack against civilians since 37
people were killed by a mortar bomb in a Sarajevo street on August 28.
That brought Nato air strikes against Serb forces which forced the
current US-led peace initiative.
Last night, Nato warplanes again took to the skies in response to the
attack, in which four of the dead and many of the wounded were children.
Nato sources in Naples said it responded to a UN request to ''locate
and neutralise'' Serb heavy weapons near Tuzla but bad weather and
darkness forced the mission to end without success.
Earlier, Bosnian Government sources said the attack on the camp at
Zivinice, 50 miles north of Sarajevo, was carried out by Serb warplanes
dropping cluster bombs.
A UN spokesman in Sarajevo said the cluster bomb appeared to be fired
from a rocket launcher.
Nato spokesman Captain Mark Van Dyke said the planes were launched
this afternoon under Operation Deny Flight, the Nato enforcement
operation against violations of the UN-declared no-fly zone over Bosnia.
''Serb terrorists are continuing to kill our children,'' Mr Silajdzic
told Government radio.
''I still have not had a chance to speak to President Izetbegovic but
I think if these attacks continue that we should postpone these
negotiations until the international community is capable of obtaining
such conditions which would secure the basic safety of our citizens.
''We are talking about an attack on children here, a refugee camp, the
murder of children. It is the worst kind of criminal.''
Mr Silajdzic also said a ceasefire, due to come into effect tomorrow,
would fail to start if gas to Sarajevo were not switched on in time, one
of the preconditions for the truce.
President Alija Izetbegovic told Government television: ''There are
conditions that we have set for a ceasefire regarding Sarajevo and
Gorazde. If they are met, there will be a ceasefire. If not, there will
be no ceasefire until they are met.''
The refugee camp is home to about 1000 refugees, most of whom fled
fighting around Zepa and Srebenica this summer.
A reporter who visited the Tuzla hospital put the casualty toll at
three women and four children killed, including a 10-month-old baby. A
total of 49 people were wounded, she said.
''The victims were mostly children who were out playing because of the
fine weather,'' government radio said.
Three more people were killed in later bombings of the Tuzla area and
more than 50 people wounded during the day, the radio added.
Bosnian Government television reported at least two dead and 50
wounded by a Serb air raid on Tesanjka. It also said that, as evening
fell, Serb artillery was bombarding the nearby town of Tesanj. People
were huddling in shelters and the hospital was operating on many
wounded.
Elsewhere in Bosnia, fighting raged as military leaders attempted to
secure better positions ahead of the ceasefire and enhance their side's
negotiating position ahead of talks.
Heavy fighting broke out along Serb-Muslim confrontation lines in
north-west Bosnia yesterday, according to Bosnian Army sources and
eyewitnesses.
They said fierce artillery and rocket duels were raging to the north
and east of Bosanska Krupa. There was ''heavy fighting'' along a
frontline between Otoka and Kljuc. The United Nations said it was
concerned at the fighting.
Bosnian Army Brigadier Mirsad Selmanovic told reporters in Bosanska
Krupa, 12 miles east of Bihac there was heavy fighting along the entire
northwestern frontline.
Despite the fighting, prospects for the ceasefire improved after the
Government said technical delays to restoring electricity and gas in
Sarajevo would not affect its timing.
Mr Silajdzic said gas from Russia was due to start flowing soon
through an international pipeline crossing territory held by the rebel
Bosnian Serbs.
Soldiers from all three Bosnian armies began clearing mines from
around pylons on a mountain near Sarajevo so engineers could restore
power to the city.

* The UN war crimes tribunal begins proceedings today at which alleged
victims and witnesses of atrocities in the former Yugoslavia will give
evidence in public for the first time.
They will testify at hearings in the case of former Bosnian Serb
prison camp commander Dragan Nikolic, the first person indicted by the
UN criminal tribunal.
Nikolic has remained free since he was charged in November, 1994, with
killing eight Muslim prisoners, torturing 10 others, and injuring three
more at the Susica camp in north-east Bosnia.
Nikolic is formally charged with crimes against humanity and violating
the laws of war and the Geneva Conventions.
