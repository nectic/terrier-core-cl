CRAIG Brown. Superstar. Emperor of Planet Football. From this day
forth, whenever Brown walks among us, we must bow down and chant: ''We
are not worthy.'' The national team manager is the business, so good in
fact that one of the greatest this country has ever produced sought to
entice him to be his right-hand man.
However, Jock Stein failed in his attempt to persuade Brown they
should work together because the latter was only 38, and besides, he was
employed at the time by the mighty Clyde, who had just won the second
division championship.
No-one in his right mind, of course, would have turned his back on
such heady success, but another of Scotland's finest managers, Alex
Ferguson, did manage to entice Brown to work with him. How do we know
this? Why, Brown told us.
You must understand, however, that our leader spoke only to let the
world know there was a time when he was in great demand lest some
outsiders continued to underplay his work in edging Scotland's national
side towards the finals of the European Championships. He had to put the
record straight and it wasn't a case of seeking adulation or plaudits,
although I dare say a wee knighthood might be acceptable.
The day after his team had struggled to beat Finland at Hampden last
midweek, Brown felt compelled to take time out to talk, but not just
about his players or the way in which he will ensure that Scotland
manage to negotiate successfully the first phase of the finals. He spoke
in praise of himself.
It was fair enough, I suppose, because there has never been a long
line of others waiting to speak in his favour, but it was still
extremely disconcerting to listen to His Master's Voice in effect
telling us how wonderful he is. Even the more sycophantic of the
newspaper tribe, and there are plenty of them, stood in awe at his
self-belief, especially in this day and age when so many people don't
believe in any God at all.
Frankly, we can do without Brown telling us how good he is, although
he would be entitled to bask if Scotland reached the second phase of the
finals, something they have never done in the finals of any major
championships at the top level, but by speaking about what he could have
been, he merely set himself up for more slapdash newspaper polls and
further criticism, when all he had to do was let the team's achievement
speak for itself.
Brown had done well to ignore almost all of the comments which cut
like broken glass, and indeed there was a dignity about his calm silence
which infuriated his critics. All he did by allowing recent success to
interfere with his normally sound logic was make himself an even bigger
target. He made a mistake and his detractors will have stored the
information away.
Brown has insisted consistently he is not ego driven, that knowing the
exact extent of his own abilities was always enough. In fact, his teams
mirrored the man himself -- no frills, nothing ostentatious, and while
more will always be expected of the players, Scotland's support were
settling behind Brown.
He was doing well until the other day when he came across as very
bullish, which is not really him, but while we have the manager in that
kind of mood, perhaps he would be bold enough to answer a question. Why
has he never stated publicly the reasons behind Richard Gough's
isolation from the international arena?
The Rangers captain has started the season in fine style and Brown
must hope his favoured central defenders don't suffer any physical
mishap or loss of form just before next year's finals. The public would
want, and would be entitled to a full explanation for Gough's
banishment, especially if he finishes the season the way he has started.
Gough was critical of the Scottish team management when Brown was
assistant to Andy Roxburgh, but if the current manager really does not
have an ego, he would select the best players available.
Italy's Arrigo Sacchi has been criticised much more severely by
Gianluca Vialli, who was ignored these past few years, but they have
ended their vendetta, and the Juventus player is being welcomed back
into the squad.
Personal differences should not come into the equation, the only
criteria should be ability and compatibility, nothing else.
Despite displaying the extent of his ego, Brown will still try to tell
everyone that he is modest, but but here's a tip for you Craig. When
next you're out walking, watch out for the speedboats.

No room for error in battle for supremacy.
GOLF: LANCOME TROPHY
COLIN Montgomerie had to produce ''a miraculous shot'' yesterday at
the last hole to ensure victory in the Lancome Trophy in Paris.
Montgomerie, winner of the German Masters two weeks ago, was faced with
a 30-yard downhill chip on hard ground at the 209-yard eighteenth hole
which he could not afford to fluff if he was to beat fellow Scot Sam
Torrance.
He hit his sand wedge to within three feet of the hole and, even
though Torrance sank a six-foot putt for a birdie 2, Montgomerie cooly
sank his own putt to win with a 72-hole aggregate of 269, 11 under par.
Torrance shot 69 for 270, while David Gilford, who, like the two
Scots, is in the European Ryder Cup team, finished with a brilliant
seven-under-par 63 for 271.
Later Montgomerie said: ''I was two shots ahead of Sam when we got to
the last hole, but I hit my No.6 iron from the tee out to the left and
he put his shot really close.
''Mentally, I gave him his putt as I was walking down to the green and
knew that I would have to get up and down to win the tournament, because
my play-off record isn't very good.
''It didn't look too good when I reached my ball. A downhill chip on
hard ground where the spectators had trampled it down is not my idea of
fun. I could have hit 100 balls there and not got it as close as I did.
It was a miraculous shot, the best I've hit all week.''
Montgomerie and Torrance, who are first and second in the Order of
Merit, had battled for the lead all week. Now Montgomerie is more than
#63,000 ahead of his rival and looks almost certain to be European No.1
for the third successive year.
Since missing the cut in the Open at St Andrews, Montgomerie has
played in six tournaments and won #442,971, which works out at #1025 per
hole.
He admitted that he did not play very well yesterday, having four
bogeys, as against three birdies, on his card, but it was just enough to
give him the ninth European PGA Tour victory of his career.
Torrance, who called Montgomerie ''a relentless, large Scot,'' said:
''I tried my best but it wasn't just good enough. But I'm not giving up
trying to beat him for top place in the Order of Merit.''
For the moment, however, the two Scots have their sights set on the
Ryder Cup later this month and five of the European team, Montgomerie,
Torrance, Gilford, Bernhard Langer and Costantino Rocca finished in the
top nine in Paris.
''That is very encouraging'' said Montgomerie. ''We all seem to be
playing well and I think we will win the Ryder Cup.''
The only doubt on the horizon is still whether Jose Maria Olazabal
will be fit enough to play against the Americans. He limped round on his
bad right foot for a 73 yesterday for 281, one over par, which left him
in joint twenth-sixth place.
Olazabal will be in touch with cup captain Bernard Gallacher and a
decision on whether he will play will be made today. Olazabal says he
has ''most probably'' made up his mind on what he wants to do, but adds:
''I will have a little chat with Bernard and talk to him about the
situation. My foot is about the same as when I began the week.''
For the fourth day running Olazabal played the back nine worse than
the front nine, which is not a good sign. But he is waiting to see what
Gallacher suggests before making a final decision.

otherwise stated):

TRYGG HANSA OPEN
LOTTA Neumann was cheered home by a gallery of 10,000 spectators
yesterday, when she posted a closing round of 72 to hold off Swedish
rival Annika Sorenstam and retain her title in the Trygg Hansa Open at
Haninge near Stockholm.
With an 11-under-par aggregate of 281, Neumann finished one stroke
clear of Sorenstam, the US Open champion, with Lancashire's Lora
Fairclough in third place on 285.
Scotland's Julie Forbes followed up her fourth place in the English
Open a week earlier with another fine performance. A closing 70 after
her 69 on Saturday lifted the Aboyne golfer into a share of fifth place.
Neumann had started the day two strokes clear of Sorenstam and three
ahead of Fairclough, but it was Sorenstam who drew level when she
birdied the fourth before Neumann dropped a shot at the next hole.
Fairclough, with birdies at the fourth and sixth, had closed to within
two strokes of the lead, but the Swedish pair pulled away around the
turn.
Neumann hit her wedge to three feet for a birdie at the ninth, but
Sorenstam was level again when she holed from 18 feet for a 2 at the
short twelfth before another birdie at the long thirteenth hole.
They were still level until Neumann broke the deadlock with a birdie
at the eighteenth. Her No.5 wood second shot finished on a bank at the
side of the green, from where she chipped to six feet for her 4.
Forbes had been three under when she turned in 34 after holing from
six feet for a birdie 3 at the ninth. She then dropped her only shot of
the day at the tenth, but twice found the greens with No.4. wood second
shots for birdies at the long thirteenth and eighteenth holes. Leading
aggregates (British and Irish unless otherwise stated):
281 -- L Neumann (Sweden) 70, 71, 68, 72 (#17,250).

Mucha and Italy's Stefania Croce at 139 five under par, on the 6319-yard
Columbia Edgewater Country Club course. ''Some of the pin positions
today were tough,'' said Nicholas, who had four birdies and five bogeys.
''The two putts to save par on 17 and 18 had a foot break on them from
right to left.''
Nicholas won the Corning Classic in May for her first LPGA title.

TENNIS: US OPEN
AMERICAN Pete Sampras, the No.2 seed, last night added the American
Open title to the Wimbledon crown he landed earlier in the year when in
New York, he defeated top-seeded Andre Agassi 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 in the
men's final at Flushing Meadow.
Sampras started well, winning the opening two sets. He broke Agassi's
serve in the final game on his second set point of the game in the
opening set.
It was the only service break of the set and came when Sampras ended a
long, thrilling rally by striking a backhand crosscourt deep into a
corner.
He grabbed a two-set lead by taking the second 6-3. Agassi was 3-0
down and Sampras then built the lead to 4-1 by holding serve at love
behind three successive aces and found himself serving for the set four
games later.
Agassi saved two set points in that ninth game and then held a break
point with a chance to put the set back on serve. But Sampras saved that
break point with a 125-miles-per-hour serve that Agassi returned long.
He then closed out the set with a second serve ace right down the middle
of the court.
Agassi kept his title defence alive by winning the third set. Sampras
again broke Agassi early for a 2-1 lead, but this time Agassi broke
right back and went on to take the set.
But this just prolonged the inevitable, and Sampras took the fourth
set 7-5, and with it the championship.
Monica Seles was beaten in the final of the women's singles by Steff
Graf, although she left the Stadium Court feeling like a champion.
''It's been very exciting to be playing again. Just being out there,
feeling everything once again,'' said Seles after her first Grand Slam
tournament in more than two years ended with a 7-6, 0-6, 6-3 defeat.
Gigi Fernandez of the United States and Natasha Zvereva of Belarus
clinched the women's doubles title with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands and Rennae Stubbs.

CANADIAN OPEN
MAGNIFICENT Mark O'Meara compiled a best-of-the-day final round of 67,
five under par, before parring the first extra hole to win the $1.3m
Canadian Open in Toronto yesterday.
O'Meara beat fellow American Bob Lohr in a sudden-death play-off after
they tied at 14-under-par 274 at Glen Abbey.
Teeing off three behind overnight leader Lohr, O'Meara took the lead
at the twelfth hole and went three in front with four holes left. Lohr
birdied three of the final four holes to force the play-off. They
returned to the par-5 eighteenth, where Lohr drowned his second shot
boldly going for the green.
''My short game won the tournament,'' said O'Meara. ''I really putted
well. It's huge anytime you win on tour, but to win a national open is
even more special.''
O'Meara, 38, received $234,000 for his tenth US Tour victory, his
second this year. He also clinched a berth in the world's richest
tournament, the $3m end-of-season US Tour Championship.
On a day when cool temperatures, a tricky breeze, and extremely
difficult pin placements conspired to produce an average score of more
than 75 strokes, O'Meara was simply the best.
Despite his excellent late-season form, O'Meara, who tied for sixth at
last month's US PGA Championship, is not in the American team for next
week's Ryder Cup. Lohr was consoled with a cheque for $140,400.
Sandy Lyle finished equal seventy-fourth on 13-over-par 301 after a
78. Lyle started well with six successive pars, before compiling five
straight bogeys starting at the seventh.
''My morale's a bit down. I've got no fight left,'' said Lyle, who had
little to show for his long trip across the Atlantic. Final scores
(Americans unless stated):
274 -- M O'Meara 72, 67, 68, 67; B Lohr 68, 67, 69, 70 (O'Meara won
play-off).
277 -- N Price (Zimbabwe) 72, 69, 68, 68.
278 -- H Sutton 69, 72, 68, 69.
280 -- B Glasson 68, 74, 68, 70; A Magee 68, 68, 73, 71.
Others included: 291 -- F Couples 71, 71, 72, 77. 301 -- S Lyle
(Britain) 74, 72, 77, 78. 302 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 71, 75, 75, 81.

IN early July, I submitted to Celtic Football Club an application for
season tickets for myself and my two sons aged 12 and 14. Some two or
three weeks later I posted a similar application on behalf of my brother
and his son. On August 1, I was somewhat surprised to receive my
brother's tickets, having still to receive my own. I immediately
telephoned Celtic Park and received no explanation for the apparent
anomaly but was content to be assured that my own tickets would follow
shortly.
On August 2, I received a letter from Mr Ferrell, marketing director,
advising me that due to the large number of applications, a delay in
processing season tickets was unavoidable. However, the letter enclosed
tickets for the Newcastle and Liverpool matches for myself and my sons
and thanked us for our continued support. On the same day, managing
director Fergus McCann, stated in the club newspaper that processing of
applications had been suspended until August 10. He went on to assure
the supporters that everyone who had applied to date would receive a
season ticket. On August 16, I telephoned again and was delighted to be
told that our tickets were being processed that very day and would be in
my hands by the end of the week.
By August 28, I still awaited my tickets, while at the same time, fans
were being advised to call at Celtic Park, with season tickets, to
collect briefs for the Coca-Cola Cup-tie, now only three days away.
Naturally concerned, I made numerous telephone calls to the park and was
continually frustrated by promises that someone would call me back. No
return call was forthcoming. When I eventually did manage to speak to
someone in authority, I was amazed to be informed that the club were
refunding my money as all season tickets had been sold and my
application had not even been processed. My anger boiled over as my
attempts to obtain an explanation as to how this was possible fell on
deaf ears. I was told that I ''wasn't on the computer'' and the
inference was that by the time my application was picked up I had missed
the boat.
Was my second application successful while my first had apparently
fallen down a black hole? How did the club manage to bank my cheque in
mid-July then send me match tickets and a thank-you letter in early
August if my application hadn't been ''picked up''? Why did Fergus
McCann, in the Celtic View on August 2, promise me and my children
season tickets which he now cannot deliver? My vehement protests were
brushed aside with a kind of ''tough luck matey'' attitude.
It broke my heart to then have to sit down and tell my two boys that
they wouldn't be getting season tickets after all. Their obvious
disappointment soon turned into anger, disgust, and a sense of betrayal.
It breaks my heart even more to say that, after having followed Celtic
for more than 30 years, at home and abroad, I will never again darken
the doors of Celtic Park as long as the club is being run by this bunch
of bungling amateurs.
Whether they will ever be able to win back the hearts and the lifelong
patronage of my sons is another question.

THE administrators of professional rugby union have been put right in
at the deep end. At the end of the international match involving world
champions South Africa and Wales a Welsh player, Garin Jenkins, was
correctly sent off for retaliatory punching van der Westhuizen (no
angel). He has been banned for 30 days and this seems about right for a
player losing his temper after provocation. Contrast that with the
pre-meditated taking out of an opponent after only three minutes' play
by means of a vicious haymaker from behind. Kebus Wiese, of South Africa
did this to Derwyn Jones well away from the ball and would have escaped
punishment if it had not been for the presence of a slow-motion camera
replay. He went on to complete the match and hypocritically offered
handshakes to some of his opponents, thinking that he had got away with
a cynical piece of ''professional cheating.''
After seeing the TV evidence the South African Rugby Football Union
also banned Wiese for 30 days. This is simply not enough. The punishment
has to fit the crime and I am in agreement with your chief rugby writer,
Derek Douglas who has advocated that ''Cheats must be banned for life''
(see his column September 4 mainly about the possible use of drugs etc).
The SARFU is to hold a meeting on September 7 to consider further
action against Wiese (possibly a fine which would have little or no
effect). Let us hope for the sake of the future of rugby union that the
ban is increased dramatically.

I WOULD like to congratulate James Traynor on his excellent article
(''Bruno Never a True Champ'', September 5). I'm sure some of Bruno's
fans will be incandescent with rage, but never a truer word was printed.
The line between the pantomimes that ''Widow Twankey'' stars in and the
farces masquerading as boxing matches has rapidly narrowed and now it
wouldn't be out of place for a bit of ''Oh no he isn't, oh yes he is!''
etc. during recent boxing matches.
Boxing is rapidly losing all credibility and the possibility of an
exciting, evenly-matched sporting contest is being consigned to the
dustbin as the greed for punter's cash to fund escalating jackpots
becomes the over-riding target. I find it hard to believe that big money
contests will continue for the long-term as constant mis-matches and
sham contests send serious boxing fans away in droves. The reason that
recent ''World Championship'' bouts have been so ridiculously hyped and
developed into pantomime is to hide the extreme paucity of contenders
and their lack of any boxing calibre.

NOW that rugby has finally gone the way of all sports and descended in
the name of commercialism, can we at last look forward to all those
schools who worshipped the ethos and philosophy of the amateur team
spirit finally placing association football on the same level, and
allowing pupils to choose to play the most popular team sport on the
globe?

AS a member of Greenock Golf Club I noticed you are confused by the
photograph of six (!) golfers on one of the greens. These are not
golfers at all (such a number would never be allowed) but members of the
Club's Scottish Country Dance Team performing the Gay Gordons -- a term
which, I trust, will not be misunderstood.
They are all Japanese Gaelic speakers -- in Gaelic ''Failte Towers''.
The boat in the background is, of course, the ''Waverley'' and not, as
many think, The ''Vital Spark'', a sister ship of the QE2.

THE public debate surrounding Partick Thistle Football Club has
demonstrated the need for some further efforts in the Scottish football
world to support the Let's Kick Racism Out of Football Campaign.
There are a number of complex issues which require some detailed
attention -- why are there so few black and ethnic minority players or
supporters?
We have a fair idea about why there are so few directors!
Perhaps the new season will give us a fresh start and an opportunity
to reflect on what can be done in a positive way to address some of
these issues.
It would be valuable to have the public support of the Scottish
Football Association.

THE onset of professionalism in rugby had me eagerly awaiting the
start of this season.
I had been fielding at first slip all summer so there were no concerns
over my fitness.
Saturday morning, 10 minutes before ''meet'' time saw me furiously
boiling my boots under the hot tap to get them into a fit state to wear.
This was achieved whilst consuming two rolls and sausage. OK, I must get
more professional in my pre-match preparation.
I arrived at the club with minutes to spare. Despite the fact I was
soaked through, my glasses were steaming, as was I, and I had forgotten
my towel, my spirits were high.
Two steps in the door and I was approached by a club official. I
thought ''Here we go, my first payment.'' He looked down at me
menacingly (his tie splendidly outside his jumper) and said: ''Three
quid please.'' I said: ''What?'' He repeated himself and I realised he
was not joking. I think we settled on #2.73. ''You are lucky it's not an
away game, that would cost a fiver,'' were his parting words.
The game passed without incident, and in the bar afterwards I realised
nothing had changed.
The showers were cold, as were the pies, the backs were crap, but the
beer and the crack were magic!
Professionalism. Who needs it?

MY son was good enough to send me a cutting of your paper including an
open letter to Fergus McCann from Tom Carbery. What Mr Carbery says may
be good and proper -- as far as it goes!
The first game I saw ''My Celtic'' play was the Empire Exhibition
Trophy final in 1938 I was 11 years old. After army service I stood for
20 years in the ''Jungle'' along with fair and foul weather supporters.
I've seen my team at the top . . . and I've followed my team when they
just escaped relegation.
I was among 40,000 who went to Celtic Park to see them return with the
European Cup and I was with 5000 at Dumfries seeing them being
''cuffed'' 4-0 by Queen of the South! When the trains broke down I ran
from Central Station to Hampden and got in just in time to see John
McPhail score the only goal in the cup-final against Motherwell.
I tell you all this just to let you know that I was, and still am, a
Celtic fan. When Mr McCann took over, I should say saved, Celtic I
wrote, personally, to thank him and wish him well in the mammoth task he
had taken on. Mr McCann was man enough, and good enough, to answer me
personally to thank me for my wishes.
What I am getting round to saying is that I have been a Celtic fan for
nigh on 60 years and I wouldn't have the cheek to think that if I was in
Glasgow during the next Old Firm game I would be entitled to purchase a
ticket for the match. Why should Mr Carbery?

Watsonians 29, Stirling County 16
WATSONIANS shot off their blocks at such a lick as to create a 10-0
gap within nine minutes, and thereafter seemed unlikely to lose even
when Stirling County closed to 13-6 and 16-9 in a lively contest,
superbly refereed by Jim Fleming, before a large Myreside audience.
Watsonians allied sharp opportunism for their two tries with power in
mis-move alliance involving the Hastings brothers. Despite notable
attack efforts by Matt McGrandles, once when he romped clear but was
recalled for obstruction, the champions were unable to turn territorial
advantage into scoring gain. Some close-range scrummaging went
unrewarded although Watsonians twice came near to conceding collapse
tries. Yet that busy hooker Si Farland claimed one against the put-in
and the Watsonian scrummage seems more dependable with the bulky Stuart
Mather at tight head.
Splendid throwing in enabled the rival jumpers to cream off some
quality balls. The evergreen 39-year-old Stewart Hamilton took his share
in a rare duel with Murray Rudkin.
Whereas Brian Ireland overcame early leg bruising to still make an
impact in infiltration and replenishment, Watsonians compensated for the
loss of John MacDonald with a head knock just after the break with an
outstanding display from Cameron Mather who, among his other
accomplishments, augmented the South African-style defensive width
coverage of his backs among whom Fergus Henderson gave an admirable
captain's lead.
Watsonians also were more positive at half-back. Duncan Hodge punted
with power and placement and landed five penalty goals and two
conversions from eight attempts for 36 points in his first two
Premiership games. Mark McKenzie, whilst nibbling away at Watsonians
lead with three penalty goals and a conversion, yet was subject to
uncharacteristic indecision.
An explosive tackle by Henderson on McGrandles enabled Andrew Garry to
score the first Watsonians try. The second came from attempted pass
clearance by Gareth Flockhart but Scott Hastings intercepted and dashed
over untouched. A clever narrow-side probe by Ireland sent Murray Fraser
romping over as Stirling increased the tempo and their loose forwards
and Kenny Logan got close, but it took a thrilling chase and tackle by
McGrandles to arrest the powerful Graeme Inglis, and Hodge closed the
door on the champions with his sixth successful goal kick after Cameron
Mather crashed close and Stirling dropped over.

Edinburgh Academicals 13, Gala 13
SO it has turned out that Gala are not going to be the soft side of
the Tennents championship, judging at any rate by their much improved
showing against Edinburgh Academicals at Raeburn Place on Saturday. It
was, according to Peter Dods, the Gala coach, all about restoring
confidence after the morale destroying result against Watsonians. The
Netherdale side achieved their objective and, as a result, rugby in
division one will be all the more competitive.
There is little question that the extra ballast of the new recruit
from Pretoria, the 6ft 7ins Matthias Stoltz, had much to do with Gala's
resurrection on Saturday. Stoltz, a prime cut of South African beef,
proved an immense asset in the lineout and ensured, too, that the Gala
pack never suffered the indignity of being shoved backwards.
Of course, Stoltz's introduction to the Scottish game was made easier
by the absence of Jeremy Richardson whose all-round experience -- so
valuable against Boroughmuir a week earlier -- was patently missing. But
Gala were also indebted in the lineout to Robert Hogg.
Gala also had on show Mark Stumbles, their Otago B centre, whose
defensive qualities made it difficult for Academcials to play a more
expansive game. In this context it was disappointing that neither side
sought to run the ball from deeper positions, the frequent missed touch
kicks providing numerous opportunities to do so.
That said, it was just such an attempt by Academicals to run the ball
from broken play that gave Gala the lead for the first time in the game.
The Academicals backs had produced several threatening attacks but in
such situations vision is required. Academicals should have hoofed the
ball into touch when the move intially faltered but instead opted to
carry on. When for a second time a fracture appeared, David Changleng
hacked the ball forward before winning the chase for the touchdown.
Changleng's conversion put Gala into a 13-10 lead but thoughts of a
Gala win were torpedoed as Brian Hay-Smith, whose first-half break had
initiated the try for Kevin Troup, kicked his second penalty goal to
level the scores.
Edinburgh Academicals -- S Burns; R Porter, C Murray, C Simmers, G
McKinley; B Hay-Smith, K Troup; D Wilson, P Haslett, B Brown, A Adamson,
S Murray, C Allan, D McIvor, R Houle. Replacement: M Duncan for Burns,

N Crooks, T Weir, J Amos.

Melrose 9, Boroughmuir 16
WATCHING Craig Joiner jump into his sponsored car, with his name
emblazoned proudly on the side, after losing against Boroughmuir, you
couldn't help but have a pang of pity. It's a scene that will have
happened all over the country as our top guns seek all they can from the
game, and start realising that the pressure of that fame will come home
to roost.
Joiner's plight, both after and during the game, when he toiled
through with an injured foot, summed up Melrose's fate as they struggled
to contain a livewire Boroughmuir side which seemed far more adept at
the basics of rugby than their hosts.
Darren George, Muir's import from New Zealand, took lineout after
lineout with two hands, a feat that was watched from the sidelines by
the injured Doddie Weir. Stuart Reid was at his dynamic best, and wing
forwards Alastair Cadzow and Steve Wands were a revelation.
''Remember,'' said Sean Lineen after the game, ''we had five under-19s
in that team.'' And so he did, and the best was Graham Beveridge at
scrum half.
Melrose's rucking, once so formidable, was a disgrace as forwards
flopped to the ground instead of staying on their feet. Rowen Shepherd
will have to find touch more regularly if he wants Gavin Hasting's
berth, Graham Shiel was easily marshalled by Lineen and Co, Bryan
Redpath scurried well, Craig Joiner looked below his explosive best, and
only Craig Chalmers gave his side some steadiness. The steadiest thing
he could have done, though, was shoot his forwards, who were a
nightmare.
Behind the 'Muir eight, the backs look more than handy, with Nick
Mardon a stand-out, Andy Knight a controlled stand off who nevertheless
takes some time to rifle his kicks, and the centres, Lineen and Craig
Finnie, a happy partnership.
'Muir were ahead 3-5 at half-time, a glorious try by Derek Stark the
fitting way to punish a Rowen Shepherd missed touch. Gary Parker replied
with the sole penalty.
In the second half, Lineen scuttled in after superb lead up work from
Mardon, Wands, Darren Burns and Derek Stark. Parker slotted two more
penalties, and Kight had just one. Melrose were flattered by the
scoreline.
Melrose -- R Shepherd; G Parker, J Turnbull, G Shiel, C Joiner; C
Chalmers, B Redpath; M Browne, S Scott, K Allan, R Brown, E Simpson, A
Redpath, S Aitken, S Inglis.
Boroughmuir -- N Mardon; D Stark, C Finnie, S Lineen, A McLean; A
Knight, G Beveridge; L Graham, N Dickson, P Wright, D Burns, D George, A
Cadzow, S Reid, S Wands.
Referee : Mr K McCartney (Hawick).

LAST Thursday morning, we should all have been rejoicing over
Scotland's virtual certainty of making it to the European Championships
in England next year. Instead most of the talk was about the acrobatic
antics of Colombian goalkeeper, Rene Higuita. Not only does that speak
an encyclopaedia about Scotland's performance, but also about how devoid
of entertainment football has become.
So often the passion is still there among the fans, but the tension on
the park is almost tangible, and the need for a good result has a
stifling effect on exciting football. There's just no fun any more.
That's why Higuita's outrageous behaviour stood out in an ocean of
mediocrity.
Goalkeepers have always been, well, different and Higuita is following
in a long line of colourful individuals. Of course, there are always
exceptions, but then Bob Wilson played for Arsenal.
Now the Scorpion move could be the new lambada of the football
grounds. Already, there have been countless attempts to copy his
athleticism. There have also been dire warnings about the consequences
if the move doesn't come off.
Former England keeper Peter Bonetti, now a goalkeeping coach for
England's under-21s, says: ''If I'd tried it, I would have got a right
going over in the dressing room, and I wouldn't want any of my
goalkeepers to try it at any time.''
Of course, it could be that Higuita learned the move for safety
reasons. Playing in goal for Colombia requires a special kind of person.
It's not the most douce country in the world, and he may have perfected
the Scorpion move to avoid the brickbats, never mind the bullets, which
followed his country's dismal performance in the World Cup finals last
year.
Higuita has always been controversial and his save, which, after all,
was in a friendly, earned him a reprimand from Colombian coach Hernan
Gomez. Mind you, it would have been nothing in comparison to the
lambasting he received after he handed away a goal to Cameroon's Roger
Milla in the World Cup finals five years ago. On that occasion, he was
caught in possession on the halfway line.
Now he wants to play in the Premiership, presumably because another
gaffe, and life would not be worth living in Bogota. Several clubs are
supposed to be interested and he is said to be considering offers to
play in Japan and the United States.
Higuita says he would jump at the chance of signing for a Premiership
team. That's fine as long as he jumps in the right direction. Perhaps he
could give Celtic's Gordon Marshall some lessons after his shaky start
at Pittodrie yesterday.
But goalkeepers are known for their eccentricity. Certainly, it's
said, they have got to be characters. Everyone always remembers the
gaffes. Nobody every recalls Frank Haffey's good games, only the 9-3
drubbing at the hands of England, and similarly the five goals Stuart
Kennedy lost at Wembley in '75. Others revel in the limelight. Mexico's
exuberant goalkeeper Campos, or El Loco as he was rightly nicknamed,
frightened his opponents away with his outrageous, bright outfits. He
even designed them himself. If he wasn't a goalkeeper, you would
probably tell him to have his eyes tested.
Some wilt under the constant pressure. Andy Goram pulled out of the
Scotland game because he wasn't 100% upstairs. Not many people are. But
he has come in for a huge amount of abuse. When his weight ballooned,
the opposing fans were quick to chant ''There's only two Andy Gormans''
or else they broke into the age-old ''Who ate all the pies?'' routine.
Now they suggest that he might be in two minds whether to go for a ball
or not.
Mind you, the best save that any goalkeeper ever made was when Jack
Harkness liberated the ball in 1928 at the end of the 5-1 trouncing of
England at Wembley.
Nevertheless, all the talk of wonder saves only highlights the
ordinariness of the football on display during the international against
Finland last Wednesday.
Jock Stein used to say that his players put on their working clothes
for the qualifying rounds of a tournament and then changed into their
finery for the later stages. Craig Brown and his artisans would be best
advised to take a change of boiler suits with them to England next year.
In the meantime, as the Four Tops were wont to sing: ''Don't walk
away, Rene.''
Football needs you.

IT SCARCELY seems 10 years since that awful night in Cardiff when Jock
Stein died, perhaps because the events are still etched in the memory in
a way which will never leave you.
The sudden flurry of activity around the Scotland dug-out as Stein
collapsed on his way up the tunnel, the first terrible indication that
somthing was wrong . . .
The haggard and haunted faces in the corridors beneath the stand at
Ninian Park as we waited for news from behind the closed door of the
treatment room where the Scotland manager was fighting for his life . .
.
The tears shed by the country's captain, Graeme Souness, as the
verdict everyone feared became known. Even Souness, that hardened,
cynical professional whose tackles made strong men wince, broke down and
cried like a baby.
Outside, hundreds of Scots' fans stood in silence waiting for news of
the man who had just guided their team towards the World Cup finals
again. When it came, they drifted off into the night many of them
weeping, feeling a sorrow they could not put into words . . .
And at Edinburgh Airport, when the official party arrived back in the
early hours of the morning, I can still see the luggage carousel going
around with just one air bag left making a solitary journey.
It was one of Jock's bags. I picked it up and took it home, and that
small incident remains a poignant personal postscript to one of the
darkest nights in Scottish football history.
But, now, 10 years on, we should be able to look beyond that night in
Wales, to look back and celebrate the man's greatness. Jock Stein's
chosen career was football management, but it is my belief -- and it's
shared by many others who knew him well -- that Stein would have been a
success in any walk of life.
He had a wit and wisdom that few could match, and man management
skills which set him above all other managers. Stein had an instinctive
feeling of how players should be treated. He knew when to give them
hell, when to coax them, and when to treat them almost as equals. I
should stress the ''almost'' because none of his players were ever
allowed to think anything other than that he was The Boss.
Few would have dared to do that. He had a formidable presence, more
than just the natural bulk of the ''Big Man.'' When you walked into a
room with him, you knew that his appearance and his personality had
overwhelmed the other people there.
Yet Stein, for all his days of glory, never lost touch with his roots.
He worked in the pits because there was never much else back then for
Lanarkshire men to do and he never lost his fellowship with the miners.
During the last miners' strike, when the Scotland bus was taking the
team up from Turnberry to Hampden for a game, dozens of lorries were on
the road in the bid to break the strike, and Alex Ferguson, then his
assistant, remembers how Jock railed bitterly against the lorry drivers
and their bosses for what they were doing to his people.
It was that background, the same as those which produced Sir Matt
Busby and Bill Shankly, which forged Stein, which turned him into a
genuine legend.
He was always able to straddle that religious divide which has been
the curse of the West of Scotland for too many generations. He was a
protestant captain of Celtic -- though there were dressing room
rumblings against that appointment -- and he was the first protestant
manager.
And Stein hated that being brought up. Celtic, you see, had given him
his chance as a player and he had never forgotten that. The club
inspired great loyalty in him and even at the end, when he was offered a
job running the pools, he never publicly stated the hurt he had felt.
But the hurt was deep and genuine. He must have felt as though his
family had betrayed him because, for most of his time with the club, he
saw Celtic as a second family.
I have never met a manager with a greater knowledge of the game. Nor
have I met any non-journalist who understood newspapers the way that
Jock Stein did. And how he used that to project Celtic when he became
manager.
Stein was able to take over the back pages, and when his team began to
win those trophies which arrived year after year with a regularity which
had never before been known, he became a one-man publicity machine for
his team as well as the architect of these years of success.
Of course, he was less than perfect. He was lousy loser. At anything.
I remember playing golf at Gleneagles with him once. The late John
Mackenzie was my partner, while Bobby Brown, then Scotland manager
teamed up with the Big Man.
After six holes we were two up and Jock was livid. His anger erupted
when suddenly approaching one of the greens Bobby stopped and exclaimed:
''Listen, I can hear a curlew.''
''A what?'' roared Stein.''We are two down and you're listening to
birds singing. Get a grip of yourself, we have to win this match.''
The fact that Jock was playing badly didn't enter the equation. But
the fact that his partner's mind was wandering from the task in hand
did. Needless to say, Bobby Brown was shocked into some fine form. We
lost at the sixteenth and Stein was a happy man.
Even at that level, he had to win. When it came to Old Firm games he
was much worse. If he lost, then he would often retreat into silence for
several days before returning refreshed to the perpetual fray.
Jock Stein's achievements will live for forever. At Ibrox today, there
are hopes that Rangers can go on to win 10 titles in succession. But,
even if they do, nothing will take away from Stein's remarkable years of
glory. Nothing can diminish the man or his memory.
Ten years on, I still miss the late-night phone calls when he used to
come on to talk about some player or other, or to hand on some football
gossip he had gleaned, or to give me stick about something I had
written. Then, abruptly, he would say good night and hang up and leave
you lying in bed trying to get back to sleep. And you knew he would be
laughing about that.
After his death, his family asked me to put together an authorised
biography of Jock and I was pleased, proud, and privileged to do that.
Tonight, I'd give anything for the phone to ring and for that voice to
come on the line, and there are many thousands more like me who miss
Jock Stein every day of their lives.

IT was off to Old Anniesland on Saturday afternoon to see the new,
professional face of Scottish rugby. But it was more like the old face
as GHK failed yet again to beat Currie.
The only change was that this time, GHK were losing to Currie in the
Tennents SRU Championship instead of the McEwans national league. The
match was only part of the bad day for rugby in the north-western
reaches of Glasgow and its suburbs as GHK, Glasgow Accies, and West of
Scotland were all defeated.
After only two matches, the atmosphere at GHK is verging on the
despondent. They have played two and lost two and a crunch tie with West
looms at the decidedly unfriendly time of 5.45pm on Wednesday night.
GHK are famous for having ups and downs. Great results before
Christmas can be followed by relegation in spring. Given the brief
duration of the premier leagues, it could be all over for GHK by
Hallowe'en.
The dispirited feeling at Old Anniesland is not helped by the slow
start to the season shown by Cecil Duplessis, the South African on whom
much hope has been pinned and on whom much of the gate money is spent.
Despite being 6ft 7ins tall and 19st, Duplessis was hardly noticeable
in the match against Currie. I hesitate to criticise the big man. That
would be unfair after only two competitive games. And also unwise since
his day job back in South Africa was in the polis. He comes here as
proud bearer of proficiency certificates in unarmed combat, night
surveillance, and use of the sub-machine gun.
Give the lad a chance, I say, and ask him how many pints he would
like.
It may have been the disappointing start to their campaign in the
second division of the premiership or it may have been the maudlin'
effect of the clubhouse gin, but one of the chaps in the GHK blazer and
tie was talking about merger with old rivals Glasgow Accies.
The harsh facts of life, he said, are that rugby now is all about
attracting the best players and that needed money.
The neutral fans which clubs like GHK need to attract to fund the new
professional life-style will only turn out for the more glamorous
fixtures. Otherwise, it's only the committed members who will turn up.
And many of them, it appeared to this observer, are adept at sneaking
into the grandstand without the required fee leaving the pocket.
A merger of GHK and neighbours Accies to form The Glasgow Rugby
Football Club makes financial sense. Between them, the clubs own huge
chunks of attractive real estate, some of which could be sold to pay for
top-class players and to set up the wide-scale youth coaching system
which Glasgow rugby needs if it is to compete with the rest of Scotland.
The success of Clarkston RFC in transforming its image into Glasgow
Southern has also not gone unnoticed.
The behind-the-scenes business clout of a combined club would do no
harm at all in the ceaseless search for sponsorship.
There is a strong economic argument, but that is really as far as it
goes. The deep-seated rivalry between the clubs is such that many of the
GHK chaps were just as upset on Saturday about their fourth team being
defeated by Glasgow Accies as they were about their firsts losing to
Currie.
A total lack of compatability on the social front would probably rule
out a coming together to achieve results on the field. And the social
side of Glasgow rugby is, thankfully, still a vital part of the scene.
A spot of research appears to reveal that the ladies of Glasgow Accies
have the edge when it comes to the afternoon teas on match days.
Excellent scones and sandwiches. But the GHK lads are apparently the
better singers and much more effective womanisers on tour.
Lest I leave you with the impression that all is doom and gloom at
GHK, a day at Old Anniesland is an extremely pleasant experience --
especially if you can persuade one of the members to take you into the
clubhouse and let you buy him quantities of drink.
A rugby expert of my acquaintance commends the GHK clubhouse for its
''high tottie factor.'' This is apparently a reference to the large
number of comely young ladies and equally comely slightly less young
ladies who frequent the place.
This is of purely academic interest to the likes of me, but the match
against West of Scotland on Wednesday sounds worth the fabrication and
excuse to leave the office early.

Old Firm need European riches rather than rags.
MANAGERS and players can always be relied on to talk good games, and
often their optimism washes over supporters making them believe in the
impossible.
But reality is about to cut through Scottish football.
Before this month is over, the credentials and aspirations of the
country's two most powerful clubs will have been tested severely, and
the consequences could have a significant bearing on the remainder of
the season.
It is not an exaggeration to suggest the next few weeks will be be
crucial to both these clubs as they attempt to re-establish themselves
in Europe, while also stretching one another on the domestic front.
Students of the game will discover much as Celtic and Rangers set off on
journeys of discovery.
Celtic have to cope with Dynamo Batumi, whose head coach has spoken
exclusively from Georgia to The Herald, in the European Cup-winners' Cup
while Rangers are focusing on Champions' League matches against Steaua
Bucharest and Borussia Dortmund, but neither premier division side can
dismiss totally two other matches which will be played at Celtic Park.
The Old Firm come together there for the first time since Celtic's
sweeping new stand was completed to settle a Coca-Cola Cup quarter-final
tie a week tomorrow, and 11 days later, Celtic and Rangers will be back
to contest a premier division match.
Everything you wanted to know, but perhaps were afraid to ask about
the strengths and weaknesses of the Old Firm, will be there for everyone
to see, and it is conceivable one of these two clubs could come out of
what will be a frenetic period feeling as though they have been mugged.
It is also possible that either Celtic or Rangers could be plunged into
the depths of despair.
The need to survive in Europe where riches and credibility can be won
is obvious, but defeat in that arena followed by a couple of bad results
against the traditional domestic enemy might cause confidence to
haemorrhage to such an extent that long-term damage would be inevitable.
The next few weeks will indeed tell us much about which of these two
sides has the greater strength and desire. We will learn which manager,
Burns or Walter Smith, has the kind of resources capable of toughing it
out when the pressure is on.
Rangers have greater numbers, but Celtic are confident they can make a
play for the premier division championship, which has not been in their
possession since 1988, and with the league campaign demanding staying
power and a large squad, Tommy Burns' side might be less likely to
survive two hefty setbacks this early in the campaign.
However, they could do themselves a power of good by travelling to the
seaside town of Batumi and securing some kind of result.
While Rangers have had no trouble in compiling dossiers on their
opponents, information on Dynamo Batumi has been patchy, but it is known
that all 25,000 tickets for the match on Thursday night have been sold,
and that even though they are in seventh place in their own
championship, Batumi's players, who have been offered $5000 a man to
beat Celtic, feel they can cause problems even though they have great
respect for the Scottish Cup-holders.
In an interview with The Herald, their head coach, Valery
Chkhartishvili, said: ''Before the draw, I was quite happy with what we
had achieved in the preliminary round, but Obilic from Belgrade can't be
compared with Celtic. I think they are still rated as one of the best
teams in Europe.
''However, I don't want you to think I am in panic or that we are
doomed because we are playing Celtic, just the opposite in fact. My team
are ready, and they are determined to win.
''I dare say they have been finding it hard to get information about
us, and we have an advantage in that respect because we have watched
videos of them, read the press reports, and are taking information from
various specialists.''
Batumi were formed in 1936 and did fairly well in the old USSR third
division before winning promotion to the second division in the late
'80s. The Footbal Federation of Georgia seceded from USSR federation in
1990, and Batumi's highest finish in the Georgian chanmpionship was
fourth place in season '93-'94.
They are the only club in Georgia to operate a reserve side, and they
also have a decent coaching system farming players out to Shukura, a
team from the nearby town of Kobuleti. Chkhartishvili, who has been
leading the team for two years, says his side is experienced and relies
heavily on the keeper, 35-year-old Aslan Baladze, who was brought in
from Dynamo Tbilisi, and defenders Soso Malaniya (31), Valery Shanidze
(30), and Gela Shekiladze (25.)
His strikers David Udzhmadzhuridze (25) and Zurab Mindadze (23) and
the versatile Amiran Mudzhiri (21) have recently been chosen for the
Georgian national side.
Mudzhiri and Udzhmadzhuridze are being watched by foreign clubs, but
the coach is unwilling to part with them while still in the cup-winners'
cup.
In midfield, the coach normally prefers Tengiz Sichinava (23), Rostom
Torgashvili (24), Malkha Makharadze (32), and Paata Machutadze (27)
although he pointed out that he will change the team's style to suit the
European tie.
He will not have his team, which will be 4-4-2, charging forward at
Celtic but points out his players are very fit and determined and that
they tend to score goals in the second half.
While Celtic are entitled to have concerns about their trip to
Georgia, they should not be too upset by Batumi's pitch which was given
approval recently by a UEFA observer, although he did insist that
improvements be made to some of the facilities even, though they were
refurbished only nine years ago. In response, the club upgraded the
showers and baths, the referee's room and press seating.
Chkhartishvili insists Celtic should not be over-confident about this
tie and he pointed out that his side's record away from home is decent.
He believes Batumi's defence will be ready for anything Celtic come up
with, and that his own side will be able to take a lead which would put
Burns' side under pressure for the return leg in Glasgow.
Frankly, Celtic need to emerge from this period with their confidence
and credibility intact because they have had to live in the shadow of
Ibrox for too many years, and if they can survive their trip into the
unknown, they would be buoyed by a sense of wellbeing which might be so
strong as to carry them towards success.
Rangers, of course, also need to come out of this month in good shape
because their supporters are now accustomed to success, and Smith and
his players would have a rough ride throughout the season if they find
themselves always pursuing Celtic. Smith knows it is important to take
an early initiative and the first signs of health or otherwise are about
to register as the real tests begin.

''THEY MUST NOT: instruct players during play. Shout abuse. Emphasise
results. Be a negative distraction.''
And then follows ''THEY SHOULD: highlight good play, emphasise good
behaviour. Be patient and supportive.''
Lots of other things. The instructions of the above were for adults
attending the Soccer Sevens for under-13s on Saturday at St Mungo's
playing fields, Loretto, out in Bishopbriggs.
Loretto has been good to the Glasgow Schools' Football Association,
who held this event -- which it described as historic -- on a pleasant
sunny morning on Saturday, for which the pitches, thanks to the titanic
efforts of groundsman Des McLean, ex-goalie with Celtic, Arsenal, and
Airdrie. He came in for a month. That was eight years ago.
This year was a nightmare for any groundsman -- with flooding enough
for the Hoover Dam, and a drought fit for the Sahara. Not good for such
fine folk.
But the pitches were perfect at the weekend. It was a historic
occasion, too, for the Glasgow Schools have taken the decision -- the
first football association in Europe to do so -- to abandon its Under-13
League and institute a series of soccer sevens' festivals instead.
There has been much campaigning for this development. The pitches are
smaller, the goals smaller, the duration of any game is between 10 and
15 minutes. This is certainly the most sensible move in kids' footy for
years.
I spoke to the youngsters, and they all loved the morning. Paul and
Chris and David and Stephen from Bearsden Academy were adamant that they
liked the sevens more. ''We get more space and more time on the ball,''
said 12-year-old Stephen Hilland. ''Get to show your skills on the
ball,'' piped up young David Moore,'' to hoots of comradely derision
from his pals.
But it's true what the young hopefuls were saying. They did have more
time and space, and most certainly, we were seeing more skills, the way
it should be.
One of them was the splendid outbreak of attempts to copy eccentric
Colombian keeper Rene Higuita's ''scorpion'' save. Every wee boy was
doing it. This probably was the first time I have seen strikers wishing
they were custodians of the nets. But what surprised most of all was the
youngsters preferred the sevens' format.
There are no rewards given, no trophies or medals, no scoreboard
produced, no winners declared.
Present was Craig Brown, Scotland's manager, who had just been
presented with a splendid painting by Brian Matthews, a first-year pupil
at Victoria Drive, which earned the comment that if the boy doesn't make
it as a player, he'll make it as an artist.
Brown said: ''There are also no referees. This is the way we played it
as kids, and they regulate their own game.'' And he added two important
points. ''We have to educate some of the parents and adults that skill
and fun is what football is all about, not over-cometitiveness at that
age level. And we hope that other areas of youth and children's football
take note from what we feel sure will prove successful''.
At present, the primary schools are still operating the old system of
11-a-side, and trophies and the rest, though they do occasionally opt
for seven-a-side too. Girls can, of course, play in mixed teams at
under-12 level, but with what one sincerely hopes will prove the best
move in youngsters' football -- and certainly seems to look like that if
the splendour of this first event of the experiment is anything to go by
-- I would suggest that the age of the girls should go up to 14 or 15.
Brown, who took time -- and often does in youngsters' football --
before a busy afternoon to spend the entire morning at the event, is
increasingly convinced that the skills are there, waiting to be tapped.
SSFA president, gentleman Jimmy Crawford, and ex-colleague of mine from
back in the days when we were both dominies at Queens Park Secondary,
and a man long known in footy with 50 years of experience, pointed out
that Glasgow Schools' Association is, in fact, the biggest in Europe.
''We've 16 teams involved from all over the Glasgow area. The aim is to
get the young people to enjoy their game -- and become stars in later
years, too, of course''.
There were stars of yester-years, too. Danny McGrain and Dom Sullivan
were there for the duration, giving out autographs and bonhomie and
cheerfulness to the awed children. Danny was wry and to the point about
the size of the goals. ''I couldnae score with the big goals: how these
boys do it with the wee ones is beyond me.'' Yer a damned liar, Danny.
But you cheer me up. Last words. ''There are no losers today: only
winners,'' said Jimmy Crawford. ''Aye,'' said Craig Brown. ''All of
them.''

SHINTY
Oban Camanachd, last season's beaten Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup
finalists and south league champions saw this year's premier league
campaign off to a dismal start on Saturday when they found Glenurquhart
in irresistible form.
The Glen, who had taken a point from their first match against Mid
Argyll, obviously benefited from having a game under their belts.
Camanachd, actually took the lead, but Glen hit back immediately through
Peter MacDonald.
Further goals from Colin MacLean and Jamie Bell gave the visitors a
comfortable half-time lead. And goals in the second period from Bell and
MacDonald, following a brief rally by Camanachd which saw Dave McUish
pull one back, gave Glen a victory which was probably more comfortable
than they anticipated.
Premier league favourites Kingussie made light work of Glasgow Mid
Argyll's challenge, sweeping them aside thanks to five goals by Ronald
Ross.
Fort William were amongst the goals as well with both Ronnie MacLeod
and Victor Smith getting hat-tricks at home to luckless Oban Celtic.
In the north first division, Lochaber made a winning start, with a 4-2
win on Skye.
Strathglass had perhaps the best result of the day, defeating Lovat at
home. Strath, Lochcarron and Caberfeidh now share joint spot in Division
one on three points.

HOCKEY
WESTERN spent most of last season on the fringe of the relegation
zone, but this winter could see them occupy a more favourable position.
That is, if their form of recent weeks is maintained.
They completed an excellent build-up to the start of the new men's
hockey league championship next Saturday by winning the Programme
Software tournament at Millerston yesterday, hitting 27 goals in three
games.
Club coach Calum McLeod will, however, not read too much into their
14-1 defeat of English side Stockton, but will take much satisfaction
from their victory over first division rivals Kelburne (7-4) and
Clydesdale (6-1).
Grange will be well pleased with their efforts at the Budweiser Super
Cup in Dublin, where they reached the semi-finals.
Their unbeaten run was eventually terminated by the 1994 English
champions Havant, who beat them 4-1 with England's first choice penalty
corner striker Calum Giles scoring half their goals.
Meanwhile, Western Klick Photopoint, Scottish women's hockey champions
for the past 13 years, won the women's event in the Programme Software
tournament. Like Western, they too had a maximum record, beating Ards
2-0 with Wendy Fraser netting both their goals, while Sheena McKelvie
secured an odd goal in three victory over Sunderland.

BOXING
CHRIS Eubank's golden chapter of huge purses and super-middleweight
title glory may well have had its last sentence written by relentless
Irishman Steve Collins on Saturday night.
Not that Eubank is about to quit boxing after losing the second time
in five months to WBO champion and fierce rival Collins -- indeed he
confirmed before leaving Cork yesterday: ''Sure, I'm carrying on.''
But the former champion's amazing earning power of the last five
vintage years must now have diminished. The treasure chest surely sank
to the bottom of the Irish Sea with Collins' split decision victory, and
Eubank can now bid farewell to a big money third fight with WBC holder,
Nigel Benn.
His tormentor Collins will now be pursuing that rich avenue while
Eubank is left to fight his way out of a cul-de-sac, almost certainly in
the less glamourous light-heavyweight division.
The two leading champions, America's Virgil Hill (WBA) and the German
Henry Maske (IBF), are good technicians but in no way household names
outside of their respective back yards, although the WBC holder, Fabrice
Tiozzo, of France, is likely to be synonymous with bigger cash.
There has been some talk of a fight with WBU light-heavy champion
James Toney in Las Vegas, but for a relatively modest challenger's
purse.
Eubank's huge eight-fight Sky TV deal has now run its course. So what
is his television future?
Talks are due to go on with the satellite network, now the major
paymasters of British boxing.
0 Eubank has waged a constant war with the scales to trim down to the
12st limit.
Not for the the first time, the former champion had to forego food and
drink -- apart from one sandwich -- for a couple of days to make the
necessary poundage.
His trainer and close friend Ronnie Davies sees the only possible way
ahead coming through the light-heavy category (12st 7lb).
''He can't keep making the weight,'' said Davies. ''He's got to go up
to light-heavy. It's been like that for the last two or three years.
''His heart has kept him going. He kills himself to make super-middle
and it's taken the edge off him.
''I just didn't think Collins could keep that pace up. It dropped a
bit, but he was till too busy. Collins fought exactly the right fight to
beat Eubank. He didn't let him use his hands, threw Chis out of his
stride.
''With a few extra pounds fighting at light-heavy will make him
brilliant. Don't write him off.''
Collins' frenzied fighting which constantly nullified Eubank's efforts
to win the #1.6m re-match deserved better than a split decision,
although Eubank did land some heavy right hand shots in the later
rounds.
Chicago judge Genaro Hernadez somehow made Eubank a 115-114 winner,
but his American colleagues both carded 115-113, which was still harsh
on Collins.
There had been much animosity between the two fighters in the last few
months, but Eubank rejected Collins' peace offering before the decision
was announced.
''Some things he said were derogatory, but I asked him to call it
quits. I said 'let's finish this animosity, let's forgive and forget',
but he pushed me away,'' said Collins.

SAILING
SCOTLAND'S two boat team in the first-ever Five Nations Teacher's
Round Britain Challenge had to be content with second place overall as
the Welsh team, led by the 2200-mile race's top individual boat Pride of
Cardiff skippered by Richard Tudor, finished the final leg at Southend
with a second and a third place.
Scotland's Paul Jeffes in Lord Inverforth and Jon Fitzgerald in
Glendronach came off worst in the final tussle with the other Welsh boat
Celtic Dragon (Colin Lyons) up the Thames estuary to the finish in the
first hour of Saturday. Fitzgerald tore a spinnaker and had his boat on
its side for several minutes in the 30 knot winds, but finished fourth.
Jeffes lost time making two sail changes and slumped to seventh.
The first Bute Channel Handicap weekend saw five short
windward-leeward races in patchy breezes. Yesterday Chris Bonar's Tripp
402 took their third first gun just as the 7-knot wind shut off, winning
them Class 1 overall, but counting four firsts in Class 2 it was Howard
Morrison's Sigma 36 which won Class 2 and the main trophy.
At Gourock, Frazer Hunt won the Henri-Lloyd Scottish Sonata
championships in Diana. Hunt's successful title defence could not have
been closer as he finished on the same score as Alan Jeffrey, a newcomer
to the class, in Mickey Mouse. Counting a second place where Jeffrey was
third, Hunt broke the tie.

BOWLS
YARROW Recreation won the Glasgow Top Five title at Burnbank yesterday
when they beat Mount Vernon 3-1 in the final.
Yarrow claimed the opening two points when Bert Canning and Donald
Nelson both cruised to 21-7 wins.
That left Yarrow just needing one win from the three remaining
matches, but Jack McQueen gave Mount Vernon a glimmer of hope when he
edged out Archie Glencross 21-16.
Yarrow however secured their win when Alex MacWhinnie counted a double
on the nineteenth end, followed by a single on the next to beat George
Drummond 21-17.
In the morning semi-finals Yarrow beat Springboig 3-2 with Canning and
Nelson again among the winners.
Mount Vernon beat Rutherglen 4-1 in the other semi-final with their
wins coming from Barlow, Cannon, Wilson and Drummond.

MONTE CARLO GRAND PRIX
KELLY Holmes added a UK 800m record and a fat cheque to her two world

World Mountain Racing Trophy:
RUNNING with cracked ribs, diagnosed just hours before the start of
the World Mountain Racing Trophy yesterday, Tom Murray climaxed an
already illustrious career by finishing runner-up and leading Scotland
to team silver and their first victory over England in the 11 years of
the event.
His performance over a brutally demanding course, 12,200 metres on
Arthur's Seat, involving more than 2500 feet of climbing, inspired the
host nation to one of the most memorable days in Scottish athletics
history.
A pre-race visit to view the film Braveheart set the final
motivational seal after the Scots had read the event preview in what
purports to be Britain's athletics magazine.
''They hyped the English, and never even mentioned we were running,''
said Kilbarchan's Robert Quinn, second Briton home, in seventh place.
Martin Jones, England's former two-time title-winner, was the
much-touted favourite. Murray shadowed him briefly, then set such a
demanding pace that Jones dropped out, and was taken to hospital by
ambulance. Last night he was well on the road to recovery, on a fluid
drip.
A second runner, Northern Ireland junior Paul Curran, was hospitalised
with a leg fracture, after a fall on one of the plummeting descents
which offered no respite to legs leaden after pumping their way up
gradients as steep as one in three.
Murray fell during training last week. ''I was told I'd probably
cracked a couple of ribs, and was given pain-killing tablets,'' said the
Spango Valley man who was running only his second hill race -- the first
was the trial whereby he qualified -- yet it was only in the final four
minutes yesterday that he was finally headed, by Lucio Fregona who led
Italy to the team title.
The Italians, with almost limitless funds, had a two-week altitude
camp, at Sestriere, prior to arriving in Scotland with a contingent of
40.
In contrast, Murray, who cuts grass for Inverclyde District Council,
took three days' holiday, and wrote asking for two more days' leave.
''I never even got a reply,'' he said. ''I won silver in spite, rather
than because, of them.
''I've worked there for 17 years, won nine Scottish titles and
represented Britain twice in the world cross-country, winning bronze.
I've never had so much as a letter saying: 'Well done, Tommy.' Morton
win division two and they get a civic reception.
''But I am proud of what we have achieved today. Will I run another
hill race? I don't know. I always thought these mountain men were mad --
and now I know they are.''
Austrian Gudrun Pflueger, a World Cup cross-country skier, botanist by
profession, wasted no time smelling the flowers en route to retaining
the women's title.
Like all of the visitors she was stunned at the lack of TV coverage --
a shocking omission for the first world championship athletics event in
Scotland since 1977. Details and Scottish placings:

and it might as well be offered immediately without ambiguities. He was,
and is, not the greatest communicator of all time, nor has he ever come
across as one of the world's great philanthropists.
He, Lester Piggott, is also an ex-con, yet no jockey before or since
his halcyon days, has attracted the kind of blind devotion and
inexplicable faith on big race days that this remarkable man enjoyed.
The news that he has retired, for the second time, will come as some
relief to his multitude of admirers who got no kick out of seeing the
master being treated by trainers as some kind of has-been.
He had retired from riding in 1986 at a time when he was still close
to his peak but, after a fine start to his training career, he spent
three years in prison for tax evasion, and although he returned to be
assistant trainer to his wife, Susan, he could not resist the temptation
to go back to what he did best, even at the age of 55.
Now, as he approaches 60, perhaps even Lester has admitted to himself
that he can't do it like he did any more, although he is putting the
decision down to wearying of harsh dieting, and we fans can now recall
the glorious days with undiluted admiration.
According to the legend, nothing has been able to motivate Piggott
like winning, with the possible exception of money, and everything he
did during his long career was designed to get him past the post first.
Both his father and grandfather were heavily involved in the sport,
grandad Ernest as rider of three Grand National winners and dad Keith as
a trainer. His mother, Iris, was a sister of jockeys Bill and Fred. With
that background, there was never much chance of him being an accountant.
The biggest hurdle he faced if he wanted to make it as a Flat jockey
was his height, 5ft 7ins, which even today remains very tall for men who
sit on the world's best thoroughbreds. He overcame it so well that by
the end of his career he has ridden 4512 winners in Britain, second only
to Sir Gordon Richards. He was twice champion apprentice, 11 times
champion jockey, and sought after and admired on every racecourse in the
world.
Known as the 'Long Fellow', perhaps not the most original of monikers,
Lester was unquestionably the best big-race rider in the history of the
sport.
His record in the Derby, for instance, may never be equalled. He rode
his first winner of the world's biggest classic in 1954, on Never Say
Die, when he was 18, and was to go on to ride nine of them altogether.
In all, he collected a record 30 classic victories, the last of which
came during his second-time-around spell on Rodrigo de Triano in the
2000 Guineas in 1992. The man who was to become one of the most famous
sportsmen in the world had his first winner at the age of 12 when he
rode The Chase to victory at Haydock in 1948. Maybe it is fitting that
his last winner was also at Haydock, Palacegate Jack, last October.
In the same year that Piggott won his first derby, he rode the Triumph
Hurdle winner and was banned for six months for dangerous riding. He was
ruthless in his desire to win, but no-one was ever stronger in a finish,
a feature which endeared him to punters who will settle for anything but
non-triers.
There was never much sign of the nervous tension that invariably
drives on great sports stars in the Piggott make-up, rather an ice-cool
pragmatic approach which, if it was a subterfuge, was brilliantly
performed. Born with a speech impediment which perhaps coloured his
fondness or otherwise for interviews, he cultivated a monosyllabic
persona which allowed him to make salient observations with the minimum
of effort.
Lester's association with the man who is the most successful trainer
of all time, Vincent O'Brien, and multi-millionaire owner Robert
Sangster proved to be the dominant force in the sport during the
seventies, and they had one last fling in 1993 when the team won the
Cork and Orrery Stakes at Royal Ascot.
Lester had associations with wonderful horses, among them Nijinsky,
the Triple Crown winner of 1970, The Minstrel and Sir Ivor, and he had a
good start to his training career in 1986 when he saddled 30 winners in
his first year.
A year later, however, he made the headlines on the front page when he
was jailed for three years after being found guilty of tax evasion.
When he emerged, he soon had the urge to get back into race-riding and
won the Breeders Cup Mile in New York on Royal Academy and then had a
great year on Rodrigo de Triano, lifting the 2000 Guineas, Juddmonte
International and Champion Stakes.
Recently he has been religiously ignored by trainers and the 'word'
has had it that they considered Lester past it. He certainly was not the
jockey he was which, at 59, is hardly surprising, but he might still
have been better at the job than the great majority of the current
generation.
However, the great stars are judged on impossible standards and The
Long Fellow has had a fair run.

FOURTH DIVISION
KILMARNOCK and Glasgow Southern top Division Four with Ayr and
Langholm tucked in behind.
However, Kilmarnock's tendency to flit in and out of games was never
more evident than in their home success over Edinburgh Wanderers. The
36-5 winning margin should have been much wider.
The Langholm v Ayr fixture ended with the points shared in a 21-21
draw so both sides remain unbeaten.
Ayr had the balance of possession in an exciting match and can look
back on missed chances.
Three penalties from Gary Brannon against two from Craig Foster kept
Langholm in front over the opening half-hour, and the Borderers
consolidated a 16-6 half time lead with a try from Alan Hodgson,
converted by Brannon after Ayr had failed to clear from a line-out.
Foster kicked his third penalty in 46 minutes and Ayr drew level after
67 minutes with sustained passing, rounded off with a try by winger
Stuart Magorian, converted by Foster.
They then went ahead with a fine try from Gordon McMillan, but
Foster's conversion kick hit the post and back came Langholm to tie the
score with a try from Kenny Donaldson.
For the second successive week, Wigtownshire made opponents work hard
for victory. This time it was Glasgow Southern who knew they had been in
a match at Stranraer, before producing a 24-9 win.
Gordonians opened their account with an 18-13 win at Haddington, whose
backs looked dangerous but were forced to live off scraps. They scored
first when scrum half George Cringan went blind, chipped ahead and took
the ball on the bounce for a try.
But a try from Charlie Richards converted by Bruce Doney put Gordonian
ahead by half time.
In the second period they built on this with two Doney penalties and a
try from Andrew Fleming, while Haddington managed only a try from Phil
Hodgson, who also kicked a late penalty.

TENNENTS 1556 CUP
WHEN the line was drawn to separate the teams for this season's
Tennents Premiership from the rest, Hillhead/Jordanhill were the last
team excluded. On Saturday they ran out at Hughenden to face Ardrossan
Accies in the first round of the Tennents 1556 Cup. With the best
appointed ground in Glasgow, the president of the SRU Ian Todd watching,
a Kiwi coach, Matt Lee, and players of quality, they have high
aspirations. By contrast Ardrossan's much-washed jerseys lacked numbers.
After some early visitor resistance, Hills scored six tries in 22
minutes to turn 38-3 ahead. The backs sparkled, with the choicest try
scored from a scrum on half-way, when most feinted right but full-back
Jimmy Gow took Keith Robertson's pass at pace to release left-winger
Paul Assur on a 50-metre run.
But the currently much-identified powder-puff centre to Glasgow clubs
then appeared. Ardrossan, who will play a division below, dominated the
third quarter, scored a good try through Robert Bradford, and held
Hillhead/Jordanhill to a 43-13 scoreline.
The biggest scalp of the day was taken by up-and-coming Lochaber, who
sent Berwick homewards with a 41-16 defeat.
First division Portobello had a narrow squeak at Fifth Division Madras
FP, who got a try through Scott Forest in 50 minutes. Ten minutes later
Evan Vaughn equallised, but even extra time could produce no further
points. Portobello go into Tuesday's second round draw by virtue of
being the visitors.
Extra time was also needed at Greenock where a late second try for
Allan Glen's from veteran winger Jim McParland tied the score at 13-13.
Another golden oldie, Alistair Robertson, put Glen's ahead by adding a
penalty to his earlier try.
The only seventh division side definitely through are Hamilton Accies,
who were tying 16-16 at Walkerburn until a last-minute home defensive
error let flanker Rab Hunter grab the winning try.

THIRD DIVISION
GLASGOW Acads have put themselves under needless pressure by losing
15-13 at Kirkcaldy. Even without injured No.8 Dean Barr, the pack was in
control, with the Fifers' only route to points via the sure boot of
fullback John Mitchell.
Accies produced a try in each half, both sparkling affairs with winger
Torquil Mathewson scoring the first and flying half Calum MacGregor
dotting down the second. However, Accies problem was with goalkicking,
only a MacGregor effort registering.
Nevertheless Accies controlled the closing quarter, although only a
point ahead. Then, two minutes into injury time, Accies foolishly
conceded a line-out penalty under no pressure.
For the fifth time Mitchell did the needful to maintain Kirkcaldy's
unbeaten record.
They share the lead with Biggar who won 27-19 at home to Grangemouth.
Although dominating the opening half, they led only 12-9 but after the
restart found the way to the line.
Short range drives twice ended with No.8 Simon Reid scoring. Dennis
Lavery converted the one under the bar, and added a fifth penalty.
However, Biggar then relaxed and Grangemouth pounced, Kenny Halliday
adding a penalty to his first half successes and converted Gus Smith's
try.
A big improvement in forward play bought Musselburgh their opening
win. No-one blossomed more as a result than young scrum half recruit
from Dunbar, Douglas Easingwood. He was one of three first half try
scorers, pinching ball and diving over.
Cliff Livingston, still operating as a centre, kicked four conversions
and a penalty and also scored a try. It arrived when his penalty effort
bounced from a post for Musselburgh to secure and move wide for Clifford
to touch down.
Without a point, Corstorphine suffered the blow of hooker David
Williamson breaking a leg.
Preston Lodge also registered a first win. They trailed Peebles 9-3
until late on before producing two tries from high kicks to the home
line.

THE popular image of the agent -- he of the 10% variety not 007 -- is
that of the spiv with the pencil-thin moustache, the trilby worn at a
rakish angle, corespondent shoes, a cigarette dangled at an interesting
angle from, perhaps, a limp-wristed hand.
Alternatively, he may be a blue-nose (whatever that may mean) and
sport the kind of hairstyle made trendy by Georgie Best 20 years ago but
now seen only when rock dinosaurs Status Quo lay aside the zimmers and
shuffle their stuff.
We do not, then, describe Mr Ian McLauchlan. But agent he is.
McLauchlan, who was the Mighty Mouse when that George Best hairstyle was
still fashionable (?) first time around, is the man who represents the
commercial interests of the Scottish rugby squad. He is the man who
fixes them up with their cars and their newspaper columns and those
glad-handing personal appearances when they have to be nice to the suits
and their wives on those blessed corporate occasions.
The Mouse is no stranger to controversy. In his playing days he hit
the headlines when his then education authority employers suffered a
collective wobbly when he announced that he was going to South Africa
with the British Lions. There was bother, too as I recall, over the
proceeds from his autobiography and he was, for certain, the first man
-- Henry Ford aside -- who ever I saw with his name spray-painted on the
side of a sponsored car.
Currently, he is the man charged with negotiating on the players'
behalf with the Scottish Rugby Union as the game attempts to confront
the issues raised by the IB decision to scrap the amateurism
regulations.
The issues involved are too numerous to list here and please excuse
the mangled syntax, but the issue which comes top of the international
players' list, and presumably that of McLauchlan too, is the bottom
line. How much and when? The squad is to be placed under contract to the
SRU at some point in advance of the first international outing of the
season against Western Samoa on November 18. There are, then, just nine
weeks or so during which time a lot of hard talking will have to be
done.
That refreshingly robust and candid individual Jim Telfer reckons that
Scotland could field a pack of chimpanzees in blue shirts and
Murrayfield would still be sold out twice over. He would, of course,
demand that the chimps' body position was up to scratch and we know what
he means. But even the massed ranks of the corporate hospitality
freeloaders at Murrayfield would soon recognise that there wasn't a
Chalmers or a Wainwright or a Weir on parade. Or perhaps I endow them
with a capacity for discernment to which they are not entitled!
Nevertheless, the point is this. Over the next few weeks, but
presumably not until it has all been done by the book and the
International Board has finally consigned amateurism to the dustbin at
its Tokyo meeting in a fortnight's time, there will have to be a clear
indication from the Union as to how much it can afford to pay its
international players. That will, no doubt, be the starting point for
negotiations.
And at this point the scenario becomes more interesting still. Who
will negotiate on the players' behalf? The first thing they have to do
is elect a negotiator, or two, who can go in to bat with their agent.
It's extraordinary that they haven't yet managed to do so. McLauchlan
still has a year of his contract to run and, although we hear rumblings
that a recently retired captain might place his hat in the ring, we
assume that he will continue to fulfil this function.
The SRU are right when they say that they will retain the Trust Fund
by which means the players have been awarded their fees for promotional
and marketing work undertaken under the old laws.
Individual negotiations could become messy in the extreme. We hear
talk, too, of agents from the association code licking their lips at the
prospect of rich pickings from the union game. Forget it. Jim Telfer
couldn't live with the hairstyles.

Hawick 24, Heriot's FP 25
TERRY Rahui, a 23-year-old Aucklander who breezed into Edinburgh only
last week and was plunged straight into the playmaker slot of fly-half
for Heriot's premiership challenge against Hawick, worked his passage to
the extreme satisfaction of the Goldenacre recruiting sergeants and
represented, largely, the difference between the two sides.
Hawick take scant satisfaction from having outscored Heriot's by 3-1
on the try count but, with seven goal kicks flying wide of the posts
compared to only two by the opposition, the Greens made life more
difficult for themselves than ever it should have been.
Rahui kicked five penalties and a conversion, missing only twice,
while Colin Turnbull's strike rate was two from five and Scott Welsh --
recovering from an upset stomach and carrying a leg strain -- logged
four misses, the most crucial being that in the dying seconds when
conversion of John Graham's try would have secured a single point
victory for Hawick.
As a slice of Saturday afternoon entertainment the game went some way
towards offering value for money in terms of the #6 admission charge.
Heriot's, profiting from solid set-piece work, especially in the lineout
where Kenny Milne's throw-in was handsomely rewarded with fine jumping
by Young and Humphries, strode away to a 9-0 lead (two Rahui penalties
and a Gordon Lawrie drop-goal) before Hawick retaliated with a Cameron
Murray try on the half-hour mark.
Thereafter, a Turnbull penalty goal and Murray's second try handed
Hawick a 13-9 lead at the interval. Turnbull kicked Hawick further ahead
with another penalty goal two minutes into the second half but David
Officer's try and Rahui's conversion saw the sides level-pegging with 45
minutes on the clock.
Another Rahui penalty goal put Heriot's back in front before Welsh
dropped an equalising goal and, once again, there was little to choose
between the two sides.
Rahui kicked Heriot's back in front with a penalty goal after 70
minutes and seven minutes from the end Milne pulled off a try-saving
tackle on Andrew Johnston just a metre short of the line. Turnbull
failed with a long-range penalty effort -- that failure being greeted by
a deathly hush from the Mansfield crowd -- and when Rahui made it 19-25
with another successful penalty goal just a minute short of regular time
that seemed to be it.
However, Hawick's full back replacement Gregor Sharp kicked Hawick to
a lineout within five metres of the Heriot's line and John Graham took a
priceless ball at the front. It was moved left and the Herioters
conceded a penalty in front of their posts.
Hawick had to run it and they did. Reid and Welsh sent Graham
scampering off to the right and the flanker got the touchdown just at
the corner flag. It was all or nothing as Welsh lined up the difficult
touchline kick and, as the ball veered wide of the posts, Eddie Murray
blew for no-side and Heriot's had logged a deserved, single-point
victory.
Afterwards, the retired Scotland hooker Kenny Milne confirmed that
Rahui had been the Heriot's Antipodean ace-in-the-hole. ''I'm not
particularly in favour of all this recruiting from New Zealand and South
Africa but Terry made a big difference for us. He controlled the game
and if we'd had him last weekend against Melrose then we would have put
them under a lot more pressure.''
However, Milne was merely underlining the widespread concern now
evident throughout the game when he criticised the savage nature of the
''two down'' eight-team premiership: ''Despite the fact that they voted
for it last season, I think if you asked most clubs now then they would
say 10-team divisions and if it is to remain at eight then there should
be only one side for relegation.
''I enjoy the harder games when every match is crucial but this is too
cut-throat. It's crazy,'' he said.
Hawick captain Brian Renwick, who last weekend had tasted the fruits
of success after the Bridgehaugh victory over Stirling County, was
critical of his side for conceding kickable penalties. ''That's
something we'll have to look at. Also, the lineout didn't go as well as
we had hoped after we had done so well at Stirling. We varied the
lineout in the second half and it got better then but, maybe, we should
have been looking at that earlier.''

Kelso 9, Dundee HSFP 20
KELSO must be hoping Selkirk score first when the teams meet at
Philiphaugh on Wednesday evening. For the second successive week, they
gained a useful early lead over their opponents (16-6 at Currie, 9-0
against Dundee) and ended up losing.
Dundee deserved their first-ever win in the Borders but in a physical
contest, the victory came at a price.
They had to use all four replacements, with the worst injury being
suffered by Mark Lamont, after a collision with Kelso centre Ross Laing.
Laing briefly required treatment, but the Dundee full back was left with
concussion, a broken nose, and a probable three week absence. Scrum half
Alan Featherstone retired with a suspected cracked cheekbone.
In a match which rarely flowed, thanks to a proliferation of
penalties, the winning margin might have been greater if Dundee's
stand-off from Wellington, Chris Robinson, had not had a mixed day with
the boot. He landed just four goal kicks from 12 attempts, although he
was unlucky that three of them struck posts.
However, one of the rebounds led to the opening try in 56 minutes,
Graeme Aitchison having kicked three penalties to Robinson's two.
Stewart Bennet knocked the loose ball on, and from the scrummage,
replacement scrum half Giles Sandford sent Robinson hurtling through a
gap for a fine touchdown.
The visitors scored again straight from the restart. Mike Cousin broke
away up the touchline, Sandford carried on, and Stewart Campbell was
first to collect his inside pass and plunge over the line.
Kelso -- G Aitchison; S Ross, G Laing, R Laing, J Thomson; P Dunkley,
G Cowe; J Ramage, B Cassie, R Hogarth, S Rowley, I Fullerton, S Bennet,
A Roxburgh, C Millar. Temporary Replacement: A Miller for R Laing (19 to
28 min)
Dundee -- M Lamont; M A Cousin, P M Rouse, D R Hamilton, J Jardine; C
Robinson, A Featherstone; S Lithgow, G Scott, M Robertson, S Campbell, R
Gray, G Hayter, T McWhirter, D Milne. Replacements: R Pledger for Lamont
(19 min), G Sandford for Featherstone (38-40, then 43 min permanently),
I Hope for Hayter (79), K Burnett for McWhirter (80).
Referee: D Girdwood (Stewart's Melville).
SCORERS: Kelso -- Aitchison, 3pg. Dundee -- Robinson, 1t, 2pg, 2c;

BRITISH TOURING CAR EVENT
JOHN Cleland yesterday clinched the British touring car championship
drivers' title at Oulton Park.
The Vauxhall team leader won neither race in Cheshire -- that honour
fell to Alain Menu -- but claimed third and second places respectively
in the twin races to put his overall points tally beyond the reach of
any of his rivals.
Menu's twin wins for Renault moves him into second place overall
behind Cleland and puts Vauxhall under pressure in the manufacturers'
title race.
Another BTCC championship title wrapped up was that for the
privateers' class, Matthew Neal clinching the #25,000 Total Cup.
In the first of the day's races, Cleland minimised the risks to his
title chances. Although quicker away, Cleland handed over the lead to
Menu at Lodge Corner before the end of the first lap.
Bailey's race came to an end on lap 12 when his car's power steering
failed, depositing oil on to the rear tyres and causing the ex-Formula 1
man to spin off. That let Cleland back into a safe third place behind
the Williams-Renault 1-2 of Menu and Hoy.
''This is the best championship in the world outside Formula 1,'' said
Cleland, ''so to win it is a tremendous honour. Having wrapped up the
drivers' title here, we can now go on to the final round and go all out
to ensure that Vauxhall wins the manufacturers' and teams' championships
as well.'' Results:
Round 22 -- 1, A Menu (Switz), Renault Laguna, 22m 48.71s, 95.70mph;
2, W Hoy (GB), Renault Laguna, +5.50s; 3, J Cleland (GB), Vauxhall
Cavalier, +6.21s; 4, G Tarquini (It), Alfa Romeo 155, +11.10s; 5, R

(GB), Ford Mondeo Ghia, +28.21s.

GHK 22, Currie 28
GHK have a self-destruct button code-named Currie. Whatever the
circumstances, whether early or late in the league season, they cannot
beat the club from Edinburgh's hillside edge. Five times they have met,
five times Currie have won.
Yet GHK were 11 points up after 24 minutes at Old Anniesland on
Saturday.
Kenny Wilson was dominating on the touchline, and two Harry Bassi
penalty goals bracketed a try that George Breckenridge scored from a
goal-line throw-in. The match seemed to be theirs.
Instead, Chad Eagle, Currie's Kiwi newcomer, and Matt Blair countered
Wilson, and the visitors struck back with 18 points in 15 minutes.
Currie equalised with Colin Robertson's try from Dean Sheppard's kick
through on the stroke of half-time, and they took the lead with Ally
Donaldson's try and conversion early in the second half. Donaldson went
on to score 18 points in all with three penalty goals and two
conversions as well as the try, the fulfilment of an attack from long
range.
Even better was to follow when Currie countered from inside their own
twenty-two for a Graham Ellis try. It had much that is good in rugby --
perfectly timed passes, persistent support, and the confidence to
improvise, as when Geoff Keen flipped the ball blindly over a shoulder
in the certain knowledge that back-up was there.
It restored Currie's lead after the eager Gordon McIlwham had edged
GHK to 19-18 after 54 minutes with a try when Sean Little exploited
Sheppard's fluffed clearance. But the only other home scores in the
second half were two more Bassi penalty goals.
GHK -- H S Bassi; I H MacArthur, S Little, S N Hirini, G F Hawkes; G M
Breckenridge, C E Little; A G J Watt, C P Docherty, G R McIlwham, C du

FURTHER talks are to take place this week between Watsonians and
millionaire businessman John Connor as the two parties make painfully
slow progress towards the creation of Scotland's first super club,
writes Derek Douglas.
Connor, who recently sold his Gartcosh-based Stirling Fibre
waste-paper recycling business for a tidy sum, wants to create a
cash-rich Scottish club which can profit from the new professionalism by
enticing big-name draws to play in the Scottish game.
Last week's purchase of the Newcastle-Gosforth rugby operation by
Newcastle United owner Sir John Hall has laid down a marker for the
brave new world of professional rugby, although scaremongering tales of
cross-border defections by Scottish players are, at best, premature
because of England's new club rules limiting recruitment of non-domestic
talent.
Nevertheless, the Connor masterplan is the nearest Scotland has come
to something rivalling Hall's vision for rugby on the Tyne. Connor was
at Myreside on Saturday to watch Watsonians defeat champions Stirling
County but, according to the club, there was little opportunity to talk
business.
Yesterday, Watsonians' president Ian Monteath said: ''There was so
much going on that we never really had a chance to sit down and talk.
We're meeting again later this week and, hopefully then, there might be
something to say.''
* WILL Carling's reign as England captain is again in doubt after
manager Jack Rowell revealed he will choose a leader nearer the November
Test against South Africa. Carling believed he would be carrying on
after a talk with Rowell last month and was introduced as the England
captain at a news conference on the eve of the season.
But the job has been put on hold because Rowell wants to keep his
options open and because the correct procedures -- that few knew existed
-- have not been gone through.
Carling, who has missed only two Tests since becoming captain, was
dismissed by then president Dennis Easby prior to the World Cup after
calling the RFU committe ''old farts'', but was reinstated after a show
of public support and led England in South Africa.

West of Scotland 16,
Jed-Forest 21
THE tension is quite clearly beginning to tell and we are only in week
two of the new super soaraway league set-up. The Lord alone knows what
it will be like come the end of November.
When the normally loquacious Sandy Service offers just a few words
like crumbs from the rich man's table, you know that all is not well,
and when Burnbrae fails to buzz something has to be done.
Never mind the fear factor which has been explored in these columns by
wiser counsel than mine. Whatever happened to the fun factor and what
the Irish describe as ''the crack?''
Instead we see coaches and players walking around with their faces
tripping them, simply because the team was not good enough to beat
Border opposition for the second week in a row.
Yes, defeat is sore. Yes, it is important to find as high a league
placing as possible. But what is for sure is that it ain't the end of
the world.
What could be gleaned from the coaching team of Service and Gordon
McPherson was that their charges would be reminded at training this week
of the importance of reducing the number of penalties conceded.
Indeed, West of Scotland were punished most severely in this match for
what was not so much indiscipline as carelessness.
None of this takes away from the fact that the game was there for West
to win against a Jed-Forest side with an injury list which has robbed
them of the excellent half-back pairing of Gareth Scott and Gary
Armstrong.
In mentioning the absence of Gary Armstrong, though, there is no
intention to belittle the contribution of young Clark Laidlaw. There is
something about Jedburgh which breeds great scrum halves and while it is
far too early to talk of him in the same breath as dad Roy or uncle Gary
the potential is enormous.
He has a fine eye, a good service and punts when required to telling
effect. The 18-year-old dealt effectively with the wily attentions of
Fraser Stott and all the time, surprise, surprise, he seemed to be
having a good time.
The Jed pack, as ever, is mobile and effective, although there were
occasions when the speed to assist with the defensive chores could have
been sharper.
For West, there is much to cheer, with the Bulloch brothers settling
well, Andy Kerr fitting into a storming back row, and Guy Perrett and
Scott McKechnie providing excellent lineout ball.
And what Mr McPherson has brought from New Zealand is a physical and
mental hardness which has been missing from West teams in the recent
past.
The aimless punting must be limited, however, and the fact that on one
of the few occasions Alan Bulloch was given the ball he scored a fine
try speaks for itself.
The ding-dong battle for points saw David Barrett and Chris Richards,
a player showing signs of real quality, trading penalties before the
reliable Harry Hogg dropped a goal to give Jed the advantage.
Richards added a second penalty before Bulloch's try and Barrett's
conversion gave West hopes which were dashed by a third Richards penalty
goal.
Barrett twice gave his side the lead in the second half with penalty
goals but three similar scores from Richards gave the visitors full
points.
West of Scotland -- A C D Greenshields; A Hogarth, R Little, A J
Bulloch, D Riding; D N Barrett, F H Stott; S McGregor, G C Bulloch, D
Jamieson, S G McKechnie, G C Perrett, A J Kerr, D R McLeish, J Lonergan.
Jed-Forest -- C J Richards; S Shaw, A J Douglas, H G Hogg, M A K Yule;
K A Amos, C Laidlaw; N A McIlroy, C K Brown, G Kerr, A T I Dunnett, C R

Stewart's-Melville FP 20, Selkirk 18
STEWART'S-Melville had to rely on the last-minute heroics of Murray
Thomson once more at Inverleith. After stunning Dundee last week with a
last-minute penalty, Thomson's last-ditch tap tackle on Darren Hulme on
Saturday kept Selkirk at bay.
Selkirk, though, had more than enough chances to grab the winning
score but, all too often, the final pass failed to match the build-up.
After a Rodney Pow penalty in the seventy-first minute, Selkirk
continued to press for the winning score, but the closest they came was
a Scott Nichol drop goal attempt and Hulme's thwarted efforts.
With Keith McConnell and Dave Cameron dominating the early lineouts,
Selkirk had the best of the opening exchanges and Hulme opened the
scoring after seven minutes. Pow converted, then Thomson kicked a simple
penalty, but then Stew-Mel began to make their presence felt.
Only a superb Pow tackle after 21 minutes prevented a certain try, but
the score was delayed less than a minute as Danny Bull rounded Hulme and
squeezed over in the corner.
Keith Johnston scythed through the home defence on the stroke of
half-time to put Selkirk back in front, but their lead was only fleeting
and Thomson charged over for a try only a minute after the restart. The
Colleges went further ahead after 48 minutes when Bull appeared on his
wrong wing to take the pass from Graeme Stirling and cruise over for his
second score.
Two penalties from Pow closed the gap but, despite their pressure,
Selkirk could not make the final breakthrough.
Stewart's-Melville FP -- M Thomson; D Bull, L Hamilton, F Pollock, G
Stirling; D Wyllie, G Burns; R McNulty, J Conlin, A Kittle, B Gordon, B
Faulds, K Dobson, D Clark, K Hamilton.
Selkirk -- D Hunter; R Pow, K Johnston, J Brett, D Hulme; S Nichol, S
Tomlinson; B Johnson, D Graham, S McColm, K McConnell, D Cameron, W
Gentleman, D Nichol, P Minto.
SCORERS: Stewart's-Melville -- Thomson, 1t, ppg, 1c; Bull, 2t. Selkirk

CHAMPIONS Leicester hammered newly promoted Saracens 31-2 on the
opening day of the Courage Leagues, but were still unhappy with their
try-count.
Three tries -- all from three-quarters -- exactly doubled last
season's match average, but coach Ian Smith said: ''There were countless
opportunities and we put away only about one in four.
''That is not good enough for the first division and not good enough
to win the championship again.''
Irish international Naill Malone looks set for a long run at stand-off
after an authoritative display for Leicester, who were again well served
by full back John Lilley who kicked six goals from 10 attempts.
Bath, bidding for a sixth title in nine years, maintained their
reputation for winning in a tight finish. Tim Stimpson clawed West
Hartlepool back to just 17-15 down with 23 minutes left, but Jonathan
Callard instantly rammed over his fifth penalty to clinch a 20-15 win
for Bath.
Wasps amassed the biggest score in the first division as they beat
Bristol 33-5. Shane Roiser and Damian Hopley both ran in a couple of
tries.
Last season, Wasps averaged more than three tries per game and are
clearly on course to finish as the top try-scorers again.
David Pears launched his come-back to top rugby and a possible recall
to the England squad with an early drop-goal as Harlequins won 23-9 at
Orrell.
Pears has endured injuries to almost every part of his body but hopes
to stay fit enough to add to his four caps.
Northampton, coached by ian McGeechan, emphasised their belief that
they will return to the top flight after relegation by beating London
Irish 65-32 in a high-scoring division two encounter, while London
Scottish returned from a trip to Waterloo with an 11-3 victory.

ROWING
WITH more than 3000 crews from all over the world now taking part, the
annual World Masters is easily the largest rowing competition of each
year, and once again this year's event, taking place over the weekend on
Lake Bled, in Slovenia, has been marked by Scottish success.
Continuing their remarkable record at this event, Clyde's Gordon Day
and Ian Stanners again took gold in the over-55 coxless pairs category,
while, some 30 years their junior, Lesley Stewart and Ailie Ord, of St
Andrew (Edinburgh), had success in the 'A' category double sculls as
well as contributing to the victory of a veteran 'B' women's composite
eight with London club, Sons of the Thames.
On Saturday, Alistair Brown, of Glasgow, fought his way through a
horrendous storm of hailstones to a creditable second place in veteran
'B' single sculls in the last race before the programme was postponed.
Meanwhile, not surprisingly, the excess rain of the last few days
caused the postponement, on safety grounds, of the Aberdeen Sprint
Regatta on Saturday.

JUNIORS
ARDEER Thistle and Cumnock will contest the final of the Jackie
Scarlett Cup.
Cup favourites Cumnock, undefeated this season, struggled against
second division Maybole. It was the sixty-fifth minutebefore they broke
the deadlock, Norman Montgomery heading home a Paul Anderson knock-on,
and with four minutes to go Jamie Murphy scored a second.
Ardeer Thistle beat the cup holders, Kilbirnie, on penalty kicks.
Twice Kilbirnie came from behind. Alex Eadie equalised a Scott Dunbar
goal to take the game to extra time, and with Ardeer 3-1 up with goals
from Gerry Rodger and substitute Darren Hughes, counters from Scott Reid
and Alex Eadie took the game to penalty kicks.
Kilbirnie missed their first three penalties and Ardeer took full
advantage.
Pollok and Blantyre Vics will meet in the final of the Abercorn
Builders League Cup at Fir Park, Motherwell, on Monday, September 25.
Maryhill must consider themselves unfortunate not to have taken more
from their semi.
With Pollok down to 10 men following the dismissal of full-back
Cranmer and Maryhill's diminutive wingers Templeton and Bainbridge
literally tearing Pollok apart, Pollok's Darren Stewart was the catalyst
for their ''smash and grab'' act. He scored from a 30-yard free kick and
laid on a second for John Paisley.
In the other semi, a Cameron goal in extra time gave Blantyre Vics a
passage to the final. The 90 minutes finished 1-1, with Yoker's McIntyre
equalising an earlier Grant goal.
An eighty-fifth minute Tom McDonald goal against Baillieston kept
Petershill at the top of the Reebok League on goal difference from
Arthurlie, who gained sweet revenge for their League Cup defeat by
Benburb by beating them 4-2.
Luncarty's goals-against column reached 68 in six games following a
14-0 defeat by St Joseph's in the PA Cup.
The Scottish Football Association's appeals committee will meet today
to decide the fate of Shotts Bon Accord.
The committee will now consider the Central League's decision to expel
Shotts until the third Saturday in June, 1996. Results:

MANAGERS expect their share of bad breaks, but Elgin City's Chico
McHardy was justifiably sickened by the second to hit his club in just
seven days.
McHardy, who was not known for holding back in tackles during his own
playing days, seemed deeply disturbed by defender Andy Cowell's
agonising injury on Saturday. The 22-year-old could be sidelined for
months after shattering his leg in three places in a crunching 50-50
challenge with Forres's Gerry Davidson. Cowell was rushed to hospital
after the clash midway through the second half.
Said McHardy: ''Last week it was Peter Maguire, now this. Andy was
taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, and I've been told his break is a
very bad one. To be honest, I wonder if the lad will play again.''
But McHardy defended Gerry Davidson, saying: ''It was a clean and fair
challenge.''
A fine double by City hit-man Iain Polworth, either side of a Davidson
reply, secured Elgin's 2-1 victory.

Dumbarton 1, Airdrie 2
THE visiting team's dressing room door at Bogside isn't exactly
soundproof. You didn't have to be a fly on the wall at Airdrie's
post-match de-briefing to realise that Alec MacDonald was not best
pleased with his team's performance in the latter stages of the game at
Dumbarton on Saturday.
The Diamonds, having threatened to over-run a fairly mediocre home
side for three-quarters of the match, suddenly turned into a fumbling
outfit which almost snatched a draw, and even defeat, from the jaws of
victory.
After a while MacDonald emerged to tell the assembled hacks that his
pleasure at winning three points with an excellent first half
performance had been tarnished somewhat by his team's volte face in the
last 20 minutes.
The newly-appointed Dumbarton supremo, Jim Fallon, was disappointed by
the tendency of his defence to lose the place and go walkabout at
crucial moments, but he was encouraged by his team's fightback from a
seemingly hopeless situation.
The pre-match managerial comment had clearly indicated the importance
for both teams of getting back on the rails. Airdrie had come to Bogside
trailing a dismal run of form which had taken only one point from their
opening three games. Dumbarton had been taken apart by Dunfermline the
week before, when the Pars had rattled in four goals without reply.
Airdrie opened in brisk fashion and were quick to exploit the defects
in a leaky Dumbarton defence which was at its most vulnerable with the
cross ball. It must have frustrated their support that Airdrie were only
two ahead at the interval, by which time the opposition should have been
well and truly buried.
The two goals were a mixture of sloppy defending and opportunism. In
23 minutes a crisp shot from Jim McIntyre rebounded from the bar and the
lively Jim Boyle beat several defenders to the ball to head it firmly
into the net. Ten minutes later a deep cross from Paul Harvey found the
home defence comatose, and Tommy McIntyre nipped in to give the home
keeper no chance with a vicious shot from close range.
After totally dominating for more than an hour, the visitors suddenly
did a Jeckyll and Hyde. Urged on by the home fans Dumbarton started to
threaten, and reduced the leeway mid-way through the second half when
one of many inch-perfect crosses from Chic Charnley was headed high into
the Airdrie net by Paul Martin.
For the last 20 minutes it was backs to the wall for Airdrie as they
struggled to contain a now rampant home side. Indeed, Dumbarton had two
golden opportunities in the closing minutes but poor finishing and the
safe hands of John Martin denied the Sons an equaliser.
The punters seem to have enjoyed the game, with both sets of
supporters adamant that their team should have won. They were all
agreed, however, that Chic Charnley alone was worth the price of the
admission. The legs may be a yard or two slower, now but the brain and
that left foot are still magic. Chic The Peg is a class act.

Kilmarnock 0, Hibernian 3
IS it really just a matter of months since Kilmarnock chairman Bob
Fleeting was cracking jokes and flashing smiles around Rugby Park to
whoever was watching? My, my, how times change.
The man was quite naturally excited back then, with his revamped
stadium looking a picture and his side remaining upright in the premier
division. And now? Well, the ground looks even better, but the team,
well that's a different matter entirely.
Fleeting could be seen sitting in the stand at half-time, face
expressionless, chatting to Kilmarnock supporters. One thing is for
sure, had they been discussing the finer points of their side's
performance in the opening 45 minutes against Hibs, their chat would
have been brief.
But it has been that kind of season so far for the Ayrshire lot -- one
stuttering success against a side from the nether regions -- and as fans
took their seats, keen perhaps to read a pick-me-up message from manager
Alex Totten in the match programme -- ''don't worry, I have everything
under control'' -- you know the type of thing -- some could have been
excused for fumbling for the valium as Totten's written words of gloom
and doom seeped out of the page and into already worried hearts.
Kilmarnock's people deserve better. They trudge along in good numbers
to witness their finest at work, home and away, but one is left with the
impression that not all who pull on the boots on match day actually do
enough for the cause.
As soon as the ball started bouncing on Saturday it was Hibs' play
that was easy on the eye, while Kilmarnock? Well, their efforts at
entertainment were nothing much to speak of, with central defender Neil
Whitworth, a bright, shiny star last season, looking as though it was
all too much for him, as play and opponents whizzed past, making the
Englishman appear very, very ordinary.
Keith Wright headed the opener then, with Whitworth dithering in the
danger zone, Wright nipped past him before belting the ball past Bobby
Geddes for number two.
In fact, such was the excellence of Hibs' play, especially in the
opening spell when they scored all of their goals, that manager Alex
Miller managed a smile when chatting about the afternoon's goings-on.
''We really played well,'' said the manager. ''We kept the ball and
created good openings.''
Indeed, so carried away was Miller that he must have blinked and
missed his side's third goal.
He was discussing Hibs' attacking form when he stated: ''The lads
today worked very hard. Gareth (Evans) didn't score but did well''. When
it was pointed outthat Evans had indeed stuck the ball away, Miller just
smiled again and said: ''Did he? I'm not too bothered just as long as we
win.''

Aberdeen 2, Celtic 3
ABERDEEN stared disaster in the face last season and yesterday found
out that life in the premier division is going to be just as difficult
again.
This was the first major test of the new season, and they lost a
spectacular clash with Celtic at Pitoddrie. It was a game which even had
the rival managers drooling over its quality after the final whistle.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns insisted: ''That was as good a game as I
have ever been involved in, especially that first half.''
Aberdeen's Roy Aitken added: ''I'm still out of breath after watching
that. It was a tremendous advert for the Scottish game.''
Aitken had to hide a measure of disappointment. He had seen his
players go two goals ahead after only 10 minutes. But less than half an
hour later they were again facing the cruel facts of premier division
life.
In that crucial period ''we just switched off,'' admitted Aitken. They
saw their two-goal lead vanish and, worse still, saw it transformed into
a 3-2 deficit.
It had been an astonishing half-hour of action, a roller-coaster match
which Celtic eventually edged over the first half. Then, facing problems
after half-time, found themselves holding on grimly to their lead.
Yet, while the attacking play from both teams earned praise, the
defences allowed errors which helped create that scoreline.
The first vital error, between Tom Boyd and Gordon Marshall, allowed
Aberdeen their early opening goal.
A free kick from Stewart McKimmie was headed into the penalty box by
Scott Booth. Boyd, hustled by Billy Dodds, headed the ball back towards
goal, only to find that Marshall had advanced from his line and the ball
went beyond the keeper and into the net.
It was a bitter blow for Celtic who, a minute earlier, had seen a
'goal' from Pierre van Hooydonk disallowed for offside. Two minutes
later Aberdeen went further in front, this time helped by an error in
midfield, where Simon Donnelly, who otherwise played superbly, gave the
ball away to Booth.
He, in turn, sent a ball down the left-hand side of the Celtic penalty
box, Eoin Jess got to it first, fired in an angled shot and Marshall
could only touch it as it went past and into goal.
By now the Aberdeen fans had banished last season's memories, but they
reckoned without Celtic's fighting qualities and their own defensive
frailties.
In 21 minutes the Parkhead comeback began. Donnelly released John
Collins and he flighted a left-foot shot over Theo Snelders and sparked
the revival.
The equaliser arrived in 33 minutes. This time Andreas Thom was the
man who accepted another telling pass from young Donnelly. The German
moved into the penalty area and then appeared to try to send the ball
across the face of goal. It deceived Snelders and his team-mates, struck
the inside of the far post and ended in the net.
Five minutes more and Snelders was in trouble yet again. Thom sent in
a fierce shot from 20 yards, the Dutchman blocked the effort but allowed
the ball to run clear and Collins followed up to finish things.
Now Celtic were in control and Aberdeen, who had started so
magnificently, were wondering just what had gone wrong. They tried to
make amends in the second half.
In 54 minutes, for instance, Marshall made a superb save from Jess.
Then Celtic's worries began. Tosh McKinlay was injured. He limped off
and that brought a reshuffle at the back with Boyd going to left back
and substitute Malcolm Mackay slotting in at the heart of the defence.
In 64 minutes, John Hughes was booked for a tackle from behind on
Duncan Shearer, who had just taken over from Joe Miller.
Eight minutes more and Hughes handled the ball at the edge of the box.
McKimmie had headed forward, Dodds was breaking clear and Hughes used
his hand to prevent the danger. He was shown the red card.
That meant one more reshuffle with Peter Grant dropping back, and from
then until the end Celtic held on as Aberdeen applied pressure but
little subtlety as they tried to rescue the points.
There were two more players in trouble in the match -- Peter
Hetherston, who was yellow-carded for a trip on John Collins in the
first half, and Tom Boyd for a late tackle on Eoin Jess in the hectic,
desperate closing minutes.
Afterwards, Aitken promised his supporters: ''We are on the way back.
We will be back among the top teams in the country.
''OK, we did lose a two-goal lead when we seemed to switch off for a
spell. But in the second half it was one-way traffic, and we deserved at
least an equaliser.''
Burns was delighted with the result, the winning send-off he wanted as
he heads into the unknown for Thursday's European Cup-winners' Cup game
in Georgia.
He said: ''It was always going to be difficult. When you're two goals
down in 10 minutes then it becomes very daunting for the players. But
their attitude was right and their approach was right.

Dundee United 1, St Mirren 0
APART from a player ending up in hospital, a substitute publicly
displaying his annoyance at his manager after being replaced himself,
and an own goal winner of such spectacular quality that it was deserving
of contesting a ''Goal of the Month'' award, it was otherwise a pretty
dreich and dismal Saturday afternoon on Tayside.
Billy Kirkwood's Dundee United may well have produced the win which
spiralled them from seventh to second place in the first division
standings, but there was not a fan clad in the tangerine and black of
the hosts who would admit to having enjoyed the manner by which victory
was achieved.
In truth, had it not been for the unfortunate Jamie Fullerton's
dramatic intervention two minutes into the second half, when the Saints
midfielder volleyed a Brian Welsh cross high into his own net, then
chances were that neither set of frontliners would have troubled the
scoreboard attendant at all.
New skipper Christian Dailly, fresh from his under 21 international
triumph of last midweek, is fast recognising that pretty patterns are
unlikely to replace hard graft as the passport back into next year's
premier division. He pointed out: ''Everyone so far has been hyped up to
face us, but we knew that that was going to be the case.
''What we are learning though is that this sort of thing is going to
continue throughout the entire campaign. It is clearly going to be a
struggle the whole way, with effort outdoing the fancy stuff in terms of
importance.''
With battling qualities a priority, United's weekend loss of
experienced midfield grafter Dave Bowman for the next three months may
prove to be a key factor.
The ex-Scotland man suffered a depressed fracture of the cheekbone in
a second-half clash with Paisley's substitute John Boyd. Such was the
extent of the facial swelling that planned surgery for the weekend had
to be abandoned until tomorrow at the earliest.
Manager Kirkwood's disappointment at that must have been further
compounded by a bizarre incident as his side held on for the three
points. Scott Crabbe, an earlier replacement for Bowman, found himself
subjected to the dreaded ''hook'' himself as he was substituted by Paddy
Connolly.
Crabbe's all-too-apparent anger at the move may have been temporarily
smoothed over by Kirkwood's swift explanation that injury had played a
part in his decision, but even that may not prove to be sufficient to
ease what the player clearly saw as a public embarrassment.

Dunfermline 2, Clydebank 1
A BELOW-par Dunfermline extended their 100% league record to four
games, but that was the only consolation for the first division leaders.
After taking a two-goal lead early in the first half they let a hard
working Clydebank team back into the game and ended up hanging on for a
narrow victory.
Dunfermline's performance certainly did not impress assistant manager
Dick Campbell, who warned that his table-toppers would need to improve
if they were to maintain their title challenge.
''We were extremely disappointed with the way we played and the
players have been told that in no uncertain terms,'' said Campbell. ''We
definitely got out of jail.''
Campbell sportingly paid tribute to visitors Clydebank, who were
rather unluckly to lose their own unbeaten league record. ''I must
compliment Clydebank, who came here very positively,'' he said.
''But it was a sloppy performance by us. It simply is not acceptable.
You will never win championships playing like that. We are extremely
disappointed.''
Dunfermline started brightly and a well taken goal by man of the match
Allan Moore gave them the lead in 17 minutes. When Andy Todd headed home
a Jackie McNamara cross in 25 minutes the Fifers appeared to relax and
Clydebank came more into the game. Ken Eadie was twice foiled by good
saves from Guido Van de Kamp before half-time.
Joe Robertson pulled one back for the visitors in 48 minutes after
good work by Gary Bowman, the first league goal conceded by Dunfermline.
Greg Shaw hit a post for the home side and in the closing stages
another fine Van de Kamp save from substitute from Craig Flannigan
denied Clydebank a share of the points.
Clydebank coach Brian Wright admitted he was disappointed with the
result. ''We lost two bad goals, but we didn't play very well in the
first half,'' he said.
''I feel we took the game to them in the second half. We are certainly
progressing. We just want to be a bit more positive this season. It just
wasn't our day.''
Dunfermline captain Norrie McCathie said the victory was important to
the team. ''We have seen games like that before, where we ended up
drawing or losing,'' he said.
''It is nice to perform well and score goals every week, but results
are the most important thing. A good performance is a bonus.
''The gaffer will not be too happy, but that is another three points
and we still have a 100% league record.''

The feast is nearly ruined by referee.
Morton 2, Dundee 2
THOSE of a Greenock Morton persuasion, when out on a Saturday night,
may be inclined to sing of the river they're happy beside. After the
controversial draw against Dundee at Cappielow, the ''Wrong of the
Clyde'' may be a more appropriate title.
It would refer to referee George Clyde of Bearsden, and both teams
suffered from what can only be described as his sheer inconsistency.
Referee bashing always seems to be easy meat because of the rule that
reads ''no comment,'' courtesy of the SFA. But until whistlers have a
chance to defend themselves, then so be it.
Mr Clyde, as far as both sets of fans were concerned, caused
controversy in what otherwise would have been a spectacle, a fast
flowing feast of football. The managers, of course, and players must
beware ''the house of jaws'' -- speaking out of turn.
After 59 minutes, Michael Pageaud brought down Alan Mahood, who was
running through on him, just inside the box. ''Off, off, off,'' was the
cry. A penalty was awarded, but there was merely a booking for the
keeper who, it must be said, looked mightily relieved.
If he had saved Derek Lilley's penalty kick, there would have been a
break-in.
Step up Neil McCann, a star in the Under-21s victory over Finland in
midweek. The Dundee winger's sheer acceleration led Dougie Johnstone
into a late challenge. Down went McCann and off went Johnstone for what
basically was his first misdemeanor.
It was not a malicious challenge. The player was merely committed to
the tackle on the half-way line and skinned for speed. Surely sense
would have ruled a deserved booking.
McCann made the most of the treatment he received, and it must be said
that his recovery -- he had been felled earlier in the match without
action being taken -- and his continued dashes down the wing were
amazing to say the least, and he certainly caused the Morton defence
trouble to the end. A very fit young man.
The 10-man Morton kept their shape and flowing football, despite Ray
Farningham -- on as a first-half substitute for the injured Morten
Wieghorst -- having a header cleared off the line by Mahood from a
McCann corner after 77 minutes.
Seven minutes later, the same Mahood was adjudged to have been brought
down by Dundee skipper Neil Duffy, and a penalty was awarded. No names,
no pack drill, but even Morton folks thought the penalty award was a
soft one.
Lilley did the business again, and Morton proved they they will be
no-one's pushovers this season. And the two-penalty hero, Lilley, as
well as manager Allan McGraw pointed out: ''Don't count us out as title
challengers.''
Having taken four points off the Tayside double act -- remember they
drew at Tannadice in the first game of the season -- McGraw is correct
when he says: ''No-one will enjoy playing us. This team is capable of
doing a lot of damage.
Lilley, meanwhile, with superb service from Finns Marko Rajamaki and,
particularly, Janne Lindberg, who had a cracking game in the second half
against Scotland at Hampden, is hitting the net regularly so far this
season. That's three goals in five games, which gives him hope of
passing the 20 he scored last year.
Lindberg, meanwhile, is enjoying the hard work in the middle of the
park, and is described by McGraw as ''different class.''
Dundee manager Jim Duffy still can't put his finger on why his side
manage to get their noses in front and then slip up. That's two away
games on the trot which have cost them four valuable points.
Farningham summed it up later when he said: ''We were not playing
particularly well, yet went in two goals up at the interval. The manager
has told us we're forgetting the basics of the game, and no doubt we'll
be working on that this week.''
Paul Tosh must have hit the quickest goal of the season after only 48
seconds, and Farningham got the second himself just before the break.

Hamilton 0, St Johnstone 3
HOW St Johnstone at last brightened their slow start to the season
needs more than the usual garage metaphors about putting feet on pedals
and moving up a gear. Their heavy defeat of Hamilton Academical was
notable for more than its size. With it went abundant style.
More aggressive training about taking goals was one of the formal
explanations given afterwards. Paul Sturrock, the manager, said also he
had had a series of individual interviews with his more experienced
players.
''Quiet chats,'' he called them. They had been along the lines of
taking more responsibility to help younger mates out of a difficult
patch and about the basic virtues of being consistent.
On the face of it, George O'Boyle and Davie Irons had been chatted
into performances of mature excellence, while Paul Cherry flourished
above all.
Really, though, it was more how the game went that had the most tonic
effect. The action might have been scripted for the old Hotspur
adventure paper.
St Johnstone were a goal up within five minutes, which they followed
with a second about halfway to the interval that ripped Hamilton apart.
To make trebly sure, they added a screamer right after half-time that
would have quelled the ambitions of more optimistic teams than the
Accies.
O'Boyle, who led well, especially when operating with his back to
goal, opened for St Johnstone. John O'Neil had the second, a simple
ground shot, after Kevin Twaddle had zipped along the left touchline,
separating Hamilton's defence as if tearing along the dots of a phone
bill.
At the start of the second half what looked like a reflex shot of
fierce power from around the edge of the box by O'Neil suggested that St
Johnstone might now hope to rise in their league as by express hoist.
For their part, the Accies appear not so much stuck as cemented at the
base of the table. Their shots on goal totalled one, a routine effort by
David Lorimer that Alan Main easily gathered.
Hamilton never surrendered. For the second half they even tried to see
if the light skills and quick craft of Paul Hartley might do the trick
for them. John McQuade worked manfully throughout.
Accies don't need to be told they need a magician who could make a few
goals out of nothing. Ideally, they need a scorer who can be creative
with less than that.

Hearts 4, Falkirk 1
TO THEIR credit, the Falkirk fans showed admirable maturity and sound
commonsense in ignoring the temptation to barrack their ex-manager, Jim
Jefferies, who left the club after saying he would stay.
They might feel that decent behaviour brooks pretty poor dividends
after Jefferies' new team gave their own side a proper going-over.
Nobody ever said the old game was fair.
The two conclusions which were not difficult to reach were: Hearts
have indeed been given a new lease of life by the arrival of their
biggest fan in the manager's room, and Falkirk' new leader, John Lambie,
has a big job on his hands to erase the persona of his predecessor from
the minds of players and fans.
Jefferies himself said it best. ''Jim Jefferies is in the past for
Falkirk. John will take time to get things the way he wants, but that is
the Falkirk future. My concern now is Hearts.''
His concern is not too demanding at the moment in that the staff have
at least voted with their feet to demonstrate that he is welcome. That
is a large asset for a new manager and a sound foundation to build upon
if the talent is there. There were signs that considerable ability still
lurks in the Tynecastle dressing room, particularly in the younger
element, Gary Locke and Alan Johnston.
Locke, who had to be taken off with an injury early in the second
half, had shown his promise in the Under-21 match during the week and it
was the turn of Johnston to take the spotlight. He didn't let himself
down either.
Not for a long time has a Hearts player dazzled with such close
control, wispy deceptive feints, and incisive passing that there was a
temptation to believe Jefferies had sprung a ''ringer.'' Was this Son of
Laudrup?
If that sounds a touch exaggerated, listen to his team-mate John
Colquhoun who, incidentally, was selected as man of the match: ''Alan is
one of the most skilful players I have ever played with, maybe even the
most. He could be anything, maybe a tanner ba' player, but he could also
be the best player ever to come out of Tynecastle. What you see is only
70% of what he can do in training. He is a frightening talent.''
Colquhoun, who is articulate and thoughtful about the game, is not one
to overstate any young player's case, and for that reason his assessment
is especially interesting. The young man's new manager, who has quickly
brought him back to the first-team scene after he and Locke had
disappeared for a while last term, also expressed his delight at the
performance. ''Alan has got real, natural talent. He will make mistakes
but he is the type of player who can have you on the edge of your seat.
He has wonderful feet and the ability to go past people.
''He has to have belief in himself but he is the kind of player the
Scottish game needs. I don't know why he and Locke were out of things
here, but sometimes club confidence can slip, and young players like
them will make mistakes. If he keeps playing as he is, there is no doubt
he will be back in the Scotland eye.''
Colquhoun believes that Johnston will bloom now that he knows he will
be given a run in the first team. He is not doing too bad in the
blooming stakes himself. Scorer of two of his team's four goals, John
was playing in his third different position for Jefferies already. ''I
have been wide on the right, through the middle and wide of the left,
and I have enjoyed them all,'' he said.
He and Dave McPherson agreed that the dressing room has had a buzz
about it since the new man's arrival. ''He is the type of manager who
talks the same way to young lads as he does to experienced players,''
said Dave McPherson. ''We are trying to play good entertaining football
and if we do that, people will turn up,'' said Colquhoun.
Jefferies' team were much better than Falkirk but that is not
excessive praise. The Brockville side were ominously vulnerable, almost
naive at the back, to the point where they may have been fortunate not
to lose more goals. A defence that seemed to have become reasonably
solid last season seems to have sprung alarming leaks, and you might not
be surprised to know that their new manager had used his own picturesque
language to highlight the deficiencies.
''We were raped,'' he said, ''after we made crazy mistakes. We don't
look fit, do we? I don't know where to start sorting it out. We lost
crazy goals. If this was midway through the season, I would be a worried
man.
''There is a long, long way to go but we will have to sort this out
quickly. We have lost 11 goals in three games, so it is back to the
drawing board. We'll start on Monday, and if that doesn't work, we'll be
in every afternoon and then on Sundays.''
He had some consolation in the debut of Derek Ferguson who, as Lambie
said, did well enough considering he had played only two games this
year. He, Maurice Johnston, and Colin McDonald tried desperately hard to
lift their colleagues but the cause was lost virtually from the
fourteenth minute when Alan Lawrence put Hearts in front after a neat
flick from Johnston. Falkirk were two behind five minutes later when
Colquhoun found himself with an inexplicable amount of space in the
middle of their defensive area, took a pass from Brian Hamilton, and
shot past Neil Inglis.
Lambie's side did get a toe-hold on a comeback when McDonald took
advantage of a comedy of errors in the Hearts defence to pull a goal
back, but they never really looked like rescuing the situation.
Colquhoun nipped inside a static Steve Kirk to head in a Johnston
cross for the third and the fourth came when John Robertson scored from
the penalty spot to pass Willie Bauld's league scoring record of 182
goals and is now chasing Jimmy Wardhaugh's all-time Hearts record. The
penalty award was indisputable when Inglis brought down Lawrence after
he had been put through by a superb pass from substitute Scott Leitch.
Referee Jim McCluskey decided to show only the yellow card to Inglis,
and, at the time, I felt that was reasonable as another Falkirk man was
in hot pursuit of Lawrence. However, with the benefit of TV evidence, I
reckon Inglis was fortunate indeed to stay on the park.
Maybe some kind of compassion was due, however. Falkirk had been
through enough for one day.

Rangers 4, Raith Rovers 0
THERE were times when it seemed as though Raith Rovers would be
disposed of by Brian Laudrup and Paul Gascoigne on their own. The Dane
and the Englishman combined so often and so sublimely that, where there
had been a worrying lack of creativity in midfield, suddenly there was
slick, intelligent play.
By the time Ally McCoist had scored his second and Rangers' fourth
goal in the closing minutes at Ibrox on Saturday the smiles were broad
and bright. A sense of wellbeing had settled over the team which this
week heads into Europe.
Belief that the Champions' League campaign will begin positively runs
high, even though Steaua Bucharest will be technically impressive at the
very least. However, with Laudrup and Gascoigne seemingly eager to
provide the required sharpness of thought and passing there is cause for
hope.
By way of stark contrast, Raith Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl has much
work to do as he begins to pick up the pieces of broken egos and
convince his own players, who were called in to Stark's Park yesterday
morning, that they are not as inept as a 4-0 defeat might suggest.
They left Ibrox bewildered and bereft of confidence and Nicholl will
have to play some serious mind games with his players before tomorrow
night's UEFA Cup tie against Akranes.
Leaking four goals before such an important match was bad enough, but
the manner in which they were outplayed was the more damaging setback.
Reality hit Raith Rovers with the force of a Ronald Koeman free kick
after they had started the match looking as though they intended
pursuing full points vigorously.
''I can't remember a team coming here and looking so good in the first
10 minutes or so,'' said McCoist, who required only 16 minutes to
disabuse Raith of any fanciful notions.
The striker, who says he is feeling sharper then ever since winning
back his place in the team after a long spell on the sidelines because
of injury, scored with a glancing header which finished off a gloriously
simple move involving Laudrup, Gascoigne, and Salenko.
Headed goals are not exactly the striker's speciality, as he was
honest enough to admit. ''That's the only kind of goal I can score with
my head, because I'm never going to out-jump anyone.''
His goal was, as Nicholl said afterwards, typically McCoist, because
it was the sharpness of his mind which carried him clear enough of his
marker in the box to connect with Laudrup's delivery, and it was the
beginning of the end so far as Raith Rovers were concerned.
They spent the remainder of the match galloping after Laudrup and
Gascoigne, in particular, but they failed miserably and would have had
to suffer their manager's wrath had he not felt they had been tortured
enough. ''If they don't give me a performance against Akranes then they
will suffer,'' he warned.
Walter Smith was much more content, even if he will be unable to
select from a full squad. Stuart McCall's knee ligament problem will
keep him out for at least another week, Mark Hateley, who also has a
knee injury and will be examined by a specialist on Thursday, can't
play, and Trevor Steven will be idle for four weeks after having
undergone a cartilage operation last Thursday. Ian Ferguson has a
hamstring injury and will not play for 10 to 14 days.
Still, he has Laudrup and Gascoigne, who were playing together in the
midfield for the first time on Saturday, and if they continue where they
left off against the Kirkcaldy side Smith need not worry, although he
and his players accept Raith Rovers and Steaua are two very different
propositions. Also, the style will change slightly in Bucharest, where
Rangers won't be quite so extravagant in their forward play.
''But even though Steaua will be a much better side than when we beat
them 4-0 in our own tournament during the clsoe season, I feel we have
the players who can do something over there,'' said McCoist. ''We are
capable of creating chances and our defence is solid.
''We have the best keeper in Europe, Richard Gough is playing out of
his skin, and Gordan Petric looks as though he's been playing in our
defence all his days. A point would be good, but you never know, we
could do better.''
McCoist and anyone else who might find himself in a goal-scoring
position will have to make sure, because chances will be rare in
Bucharest, Dortmund and Turin, but there would be no point in being
downbeat about what has to be done. Besides, the coming together of two
special talents like Laudrup and Gascoigne must offer hope and much will
depend on their contributions.
''I think that when you get two creative players in the midfield they
try to out-think one another,'' the Dane said. The result of this battle
of wits was immensely enjoyable and even Nicholl had to praise them.
''We couldn't get near them today. It was men and boys, and we were
outclassed,'' he said. ''As for Laudrup, the fellow's gifted and there
is nothing you can do about him.''
Rangers' still blossoming midfield player, Charlie Miller, cannot fail
to learn from the players around him, but he showed them something
special when he scored the second goal in 23 minutes. His shot from 25
yards was powerfully struck and entered the net via Scott Thomson's
left-hand post.
Six minutes later Laudrup dinked the ball through to David Robertson
to score the third from close range, and although Rangers enjoyed most
of the possession in the second half, McCoist's second didn't arrive
until three minutes from time, when the striker stabbed in a Gascoigne
pass.
Oleg Saloenko, who played the full 90 minutes, thought he had scored
in the final minute, when his shot seemed to have beaten Thomson, but
the keeper applied the slightest of touches and deflected the ball on to
his bar. Salenko was pleased with his performance, but he remains far
short of full fitness.

DIVISION THREE
IT should be quite an occasion when Jim Leishman's unbeaten Livingston
team eventually are able to play at their new home ground some time next
month. The chances are that they could still be unbeaten in the league
when that homecoming takes place.
Livingston maintained their 100% league record with Saturday's 2-1 win
away to East Stirlingshire. It was not a good performance overall, but
often it is the mark of a team destined for great things that they can
get away with a poor display and still win.
'Shire were good value for the half-time lead given them by Peter
Dwyer's goal. However, Jason Young can usually be relied on to get his
team out of jail and he struck twice in the second half.
Jamie McPherson broke away to give Ross County the lead at Brechin,
but the home side hit back in the closing 15 minutes through a Sandy
Ross header and Bobby Brown's winner, leaving both teams on nine points
with Cowdenbeath.
The Fifers had to beat Albion Rovers three times in a five-goal
thriller at Cliftonhill. Goals by Graham Buckley and Garry Wood were
equalised by Lee Collins and Joe McBride, with Mark Yardley's winner
coming in the final minute.
David Pew and Steve McCormick got the goals in Abroath's 2-0 win at
Alloa while Caley Thistle gained their first victory of the season. An
Iain Stewart penalty gave them a half-time lead which was cancelled by
Scott Edgar for Queen's Park but Dougie Green and Alan Hercher both
struck in the last six minutes.

Motherwell 1, Partick Thistle 1
''HAS Dick Turpin finished?'' asked Motherwell manager Alex McLeish
with a grin when he popped his head round the press room door at Fir
Park on Saturday. He wanted to know if Thistle manager Murdo MacLeod had
finished his interview following a match which the home side side should
have won by a distance, yet just managed to save at the last gasp.
Seldom can Motherwell have dominated so much without anything to show
for it. Indeed, at times they looked like one of those old steam engines
you find in a railway museum. Polished, even sparkling. Very pretty to
watch, but going nowhere.
Yet, with eight minutes to go, Thistle looked like winners. After very
few moves towards Scott Howie in the Motherwell goal, they surged
forward with Curran and McKee involved in putting Rod McDonald in a good
position. The striker's shot spun off Brian Martin and although Howie
managed to get a hand to it, he couldn't hold it and McDonald followed
up to prod the ball over the line.
Murdo MacLeod, who later revealed that McDonald had been booked, after
being substituted, for saying something to a linesman, said: ''When you
go in front so late in a match you are entitled to think you will get
three points, but you have to give credit to Motherwell. They flooded
our penalty box with players, hoping to get something, and they did.''
What they did get was an amazing gift from their former keeper, Nicky
Walker. With just two minutes left, and Thistle trying to make a
substitution, Eddie May picked up the ball near the touchline. Spotting
a cluster of players at the far post he sent over a cross, which looked
like sailing past until Walker leapt and turned it into his own net.
It was a tragedy for the keeper, who had earlier produced a couple of
magnificent saves and seen another effort from Billy Davies rocket back
off a post. ''It was going to take the bizarre to get a goal against us
today,'' said Walker. ''Unfortunately for me, that's what happened. I
got too much on the cross. I tried to touch it behind, but ended up
pushing it into the net. It's not a good feeling.''
But MacLeod refused to condemn his keeper, saying: ''Nicky was a bit
unlucky. He has been superb for us, and he is allowed one of them now
and again. Well, now -- not again.''
MacLeod acknowledged that his men were forced to defend for long
spells as Motherwell played some magnificent one-touch football, but he
praised them for the way they fought. It was shades of their great
escape act of last season, when great determination and a willingness to
run their legs off saved their premier division status.
However, to avoid a repeat of their predicament of last term, Thistle
must strengthen their squad and bring in a couple of quality players.
Money, or the lack of it, is the problem.
Motherwell will again be at the sharper end of the table. Their
football was, at times, first class, and when top scorer Tommy Coyne
recovers from injury he could be the man to convert chances into goals.
One disappointing aspect of the match was the inconsistency of
Edinburgh referee Tom Brown. Midway through the first half he refused to
let young Motherwell striker Alex Burns have treatment on the field,
even though the player looked in some distress -- and the ball had been
deliberately put out of play three times by Motherwell and Thistle
players. It was downhill for the referee after that.
Motherwell people claim they should have had three penalties. I don't
agree. They should only have had two. Reports from other grounds also
indicate that match officials were found wanting and that is a rather
depressing thought so early in the season.

DIVISION TWO:
STIRLING Albion manager Kevin Drinkell will look back on Saturday's
1-1 draw at Stenhousemuir as a fixture with a hidden cost because of
indiscipline.
It was also a case of two points dropped as they held a 1-0 lead from
before half-time until Ian Little levelled just two minutes from the
end, with Albion having played all that time with just 10 men.
Ian McInnes was sent off in 36 minutes for arguing with the referee
after having been booked for a foul. Five minutes later Paul Watson put
Albion ahead after the home keeper fumbled a cross.
David Bingham set Forfar on the way to a 3-1 win at Ayr which takes
Tommy Campbell's team to second place. Ayr caretaker manager Gordon
Dalziel equalised but Paul Hannigan struck twice early in the second
half to leave Ayr second bottom.
East Fife kept their 100% record with a 3-0 over pointless Montrose
who had Colin Mailer sent off in 28 minutes. Dougie Hope corners were
converted in the first half by John Cusick and Robert Scott, with the
latter netting from a pass by Hope in 65 minutes.
Stranraer have overcome their lack of scoring with seven goals in two
games. For Queen of the South, it was a second successive 3-0 home
defeat. Early scoring shots by Tommy Sloan and Darren Henderson were
added to by Lex Grant.
Berwick opened the scoring at Broadwood when a Willie Irvine corner
slipped in, but Tommy Harrison shot Clyde's equaliser. A Charlie
Nicholas goal was followed by a header from Eddie Annand and Clyde

THE earliest travellers on England's great European expedition this
week were the only ones to leave the country with victory adding a
spring to their step.
Manchester United wasted no time getting away from Merseyside on
Saturday night, not simply because it has never been a healthy place for
them to tarry, but because Alex Ferguson was keen to get his squad into
the Ukraine with maximum preparation time for tomorrow's UEFA Cup tie
against Rotor Volvograd.
Despite the anticipated rigours of the journey, the United party were
in good heart following the exhilarating 3-2 victory over Everton. Two
goals by Lee Sharpe, and then one from substitute Ryan Giggs, had given
them a measure of revenge for last May's FA Cup final defeat and, more
important, joint leadership of the Premiership with Newcastle.
It was United's fourth successive win to follow the opening-day defeat
at Aston Villa, after which the word ''crisis'' featured large and black
in more than one headline. Only Andy Cole's hamstring injury, which
caused him to miss the Ukrainian jaunt, spoilt the day.
Everton, on the other hand, were distraught, not just about defeat
after they had twice equalised (Anders Limpar and Paul Rideout), but by
the dislocated shoulder that Andrei Kanchelskis suffered against the
club he left amid so much bitterness recently.
Already resigned to being without the forceful winger for the
Cup-winners' Cup tie in Reykjavik on Thursday -- because United took so
long to sort out the transfer -- Everton cannot realistically expect him
to be fit for two months.
There were defeats for two of the UEFA Cup contingent, Leeds and
Liverpool, who lost their places in the top three as a result. Leeds
allowed Tottenham a first win of the season, 2-1 at White Hart Lane,
despite another goal (and a fierce shot against a post) from Tony
Yeboah.
Liverpool, facing a trip as daunting as United's when they go to
Spartak Vladikavkaz, lost a wild game 1-0 at Wimbledon. Vinnie Jones was
sent off for the tenth time in his career for barging into Stan
Collymore, and the home team's Andy Thorn, bizarrely, thought he had
been dismissed too, only to be recalled from the dressing room to set up
the winning goal.
Nottingham Forest might have completed a weekend of inglorious
preparation for the UEFA Cup quartet, but survived for a 1-1 draw away
to improving Coventry City. Bryan Roy equalised Dion Dublin's headed
goal and Andy Silenzi, a second-half substitute, became the first
Italian to tread the Premier League boards.
Saturday's 1-1 home draw with Aston Villa left champions Blackburn
with only one win from their opening five games, while Ian Wright
snatched a 1-0 victory for Arsenal when scoring in the final seconds of
their FA Carling Premiership match at Manchester City.

UEFA will next week consider a proposal intended to force countries --
particularly England, Spain, and France -- to reduce numbers in their
top leagues.
Secretary general Gerhard Aigner will tell high-ranking delegates at
the conference in Porto that the quality of the game is being diminished
by placing too many demands on players.
Aigner will call for the introduction of leagues with a maximum of 16
clubs or no more than 30 games. If such a reduction is resisted, he will
demand that the countries involved be limited to just two UEFA Cup
places.
His intention is to have his plan in place within two years. It will
hit Spain hardest of all. They have 22 clubs in their first division.
This would mean eight clubs being relegated to comply with the UEFA
ruling.
France and England have 20-team premier leagues, while Italy and
Germany would also be affected, although their intention to cut numbers
has already been stated.
But the proposal must also be addressed in Scotland, where there is a
36-match programme for premier clubs, and if ever the allocation of UEFA
Cup places is to be increased then so, too, must the number of clubs
involved.
Moves are also afoot to regularise the international calendar to avoid
the incessant conflict betweens clubs and countries over the release of
players.
FIFA intend to move all dates for international games from midweek to
weekends as from next season, when the qualification process for the
1998 World Cup commences. No club games would be permitted on the same
day.
Dennis Bergkamp, still without a goal this season for Arsenal or
Holland, was yesterday warned to get his act together to fulfil his
undoubted potential.
Former Dutch captain Wim van Hanagem -- now the respected coach at
Feyenoord -- is infuriated at the decline in a player on whom so many
hopes rested.
''Basically Bergkamp needs a kick up the backside,'' he insisted. ''At
the moment he is relying purely on his skill to see him through, and
that is not enough.
''The best players make their presence felt by putting themselves
about.
''Bergkamp is too nice. I am not saying he should become a dirty
player, but there are times when he must stick in his foot and not let
people mess him about.''
If Holland are to qualify for the European Championship finals,
Bergkamp must rediscover the form which saw him score 24 goals in 38
appearances for his country.
Unusually, Dutch club Heerenveen have chosen to stage an opera at
their stadium to mark their seventy-fifth anniversary. It is called Abe,
after the late Abe Lenstra, their most famous player.
One of the scenes re-enacts their best-ever match, when they came from
5-1 down to beat Ajax 6-5 some 43 years ago.
Portuguese authorities have become tired of the draft-dodging antics
of gifted attacker Paulo Futre. He has now been ordered to respond
within 30 days or face arrest on his return home.

CELTIC fans at Pittodrie were celebrating their first Premier League
victory there in seven years yesterday -- but left for home concerned
about the fitness of two of their stars.
Scottish international Tosh McKinlay and the Dutch striker Pierre Van
Hooydonk, both limped from the field in the second half of the
astonishing 3-2 victory over Aberdeen.
Initially it seemed that both would be doubtful for the European
Cupwinners Cup clash with Dinamo Batoumi on Thursday.
But after the game manager Tommy Burns appeared confident that both
players would be able to travel to Georgia.
Meanwhile, master marksman Ally McCoist returns to Bucharest this week
believing Rangers have the armoury to get off to a Champions League
flier.
Seven years ago McCoist made a miraculous comeback eight days after a
cartilage operation when Rangers faced Steaua Bucharest in a European
Cup quarter-final.
The Scots were beaten 2-0 on that occasion but McCoist, after two
goals in Saturday's 4-0 romp against Raith Rovers at Ibrox, is full of
confidence as Rangers prepare to open their Champions League campaign in
Romania.
Rangers will be without Stuart McCall and Mark Hateley on Wednesday.
McCall has a knee ligament problem and will be out for at least a week,
while Hateley is to see a specialist about a cartilage problem.
But Hateley and McCall were hardly missed on Saturday as Walter
Smith's ''dream team'' pairing of Gascoigne and Laudrup wrecked Raith's
return to Ibrox.
Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl faces a task to repair shattered
confidence among his players ahead of Tuesday's UEFA Cup tie against
Akranes of Iceland after their mauling by Rangers.
But the popular former Northern Ireland international says he will
forgive his players if they ''give me a performance'' in Tuesday's first
round, first leg tie at Stark's Park, Kirkcaldy.

RACING has been quick to pay tribute to Lester Piggott following the
news of his retirement from race-riding.
Riding contemporary Geoff Lewis, now a successful trainer, said:
''It's going to be a long time before we see his like again. His is a
record which will be unsurpassed. But I'm pleased that he's decided to
call it a day.
''It had to come to an end, but let's hope he is not lost to the sport
-- he could give so much back if people would let him.''
Broadcaster and journalist Lord Oaksey said: ''It's sad in one way,
but not at all sad in another. As far as I am concerned he's going out
at the top with dignity.''

Porthcawl
SHOWING firm resolution in the foursomes and, vitally, putting the
decisive point on the board in the singles before the opposition's two
biggest guns could affect the outcome, Britain and Ireland beat the
United States by 14-10 at Royal Porthcawl yesterday in the 35th Walker
Cup match.
In unrelenting heavy rain, the memory of the debacle of two years ago,
when the United States inflicted a 19-5 demolition, was laid firmly to
rest by this four-point victory, the biggest so far accomplished. To be
sure, this was only the combined side's fourth success, and the first on
home soil for 25 years since the series began in 1922, but it was all
the more to be relished for its rarity.
Having established a two-point lead after Saturday's games, Britain
and Ireland needed 5[1/2] points for victory, and by sharing the
foursomes kept their opponents at arm's length. Thus 3[1/2] points were
needed for overall victory.
The condition that the captains have to decide their entire order of
play the previous day, persuaded America's Downing Gray into the
tactical error of dropping Tiger Woods, the national champion for the
last two years, and John Harris, his predecessor, into the last two
places. Both won, but only after the result had been attained.
As 9500 spectators slithered and scrambled about the course, memory
was jolted into recalling that in losing the last Ryder Cup match,
Europe lost the first hole in seven of the 11 singles and so were
immediately under pressure. Here Britain and Ireland won the first hole
in five of the opening six singles.
The amateur champion, Gordon Sherry, again gave the lead expected of
him, although not without an anxious spell. Having taken the fifth and
sixth in par from Chris Riley, the Barassie golfer was apparently in
command after the next seven holes had been halved in three under par.
But two bunkered shots cost Sherry 14 and 15, and the game was on
again. However, Sherry regathered his composure magnificently. He
finished 4,3 -- both birdies -- first pitching to eight feet and then to
five feet.
Sherry commented: ''The putt on the seventeenth was the most important
I've ever made. I knew I had to get the point.''
Then Stephen Gallacher made his contribution, establishing his
authority over Trip Kuehne, runner-up in last year's US championship, by
taking four successive holes in one under and somehow escaping the worst
effects of hypothermia, despite playing only in his shirt sleeves.
Gallacher said: ''I don't think I could have gone another hole,
everything was so wet. I am so excited for the team and for the
supporters, who were fantastic.''
David Howell came up with the third point with a fighting display on
the inward half against Notah Begay. Even more than Gallacher, the
holing out of the English internationalist was stubborn and repetitive.
When Howell birdied the long seventeenth he ensured that the combined
side could not lose, for behind Jody Fanagan was by then safely
ensconced on dormie 3.
Fanagan, a Dublin funeral director, fully justified the confidence of
the selectors in gaining his maximum of three points out of three and it
was fitting the Irish internationalist should hammer the final nail in
America's coffin with his seven-foot birdie putt at the seventeenth.
Cochrane Castle's Barclay Howard, at 42, the doyen of the British
side, celebrated his first and presumably his last appearance in the
match with two half points.
By coincidence both Howard's games finished with birdie 3s. On
Saturday he must have thought he had won when he holed from 20 feet, but
Alan Bratton robustly followed him in. On the second occasion, with the
genial concurrence of Tim Jackson, the US mid-amateur champion, a
gentlemanly half was called.
Sherry and Gallacher won all three foursomes in the recent European
team championship, but their partnership, largely self-destructive on
Saturday, was undone by the short games of Riley and Bratton. With three
birdies and a concession, the Americans were four up after five holes
and for the match they were four under par.
Similarly, Lee James and Gary Wolstenholme, the latter a late
substitute for Graham Rankin, who had to withdraw after he had torn a
tendon in his left wrist practising, were condemned to an increasingly
fruitless struggle after they lost the first three holes to par.
The other two partnerships had to come to the rescue, which they
emphatically did.

BERNARD Gallacher sent a message of congratulations to his nephew
Stephen from his sick bed after hearing of Britain and Ireland's Walker
Cup victory over America.
Ryder Cup captain Gallacher, who helped to coach the Walker Cup squad,
attended the first day of the match but yesterday was suffering from
flu. ''Bernard was watching on television, but the moment he knew
Britain and Ireland had won he went to bed and fell asleep,'' said his
wife, Lesley. ''Let's hope it's a good omen for two weeks' time at Oak
Hill.''
* THE torn tendon in his left wrist which prevented Graham Rankin from
taking part yesterday will surely cause him to withdraw from Scotland's
team for the home internationals next week at Royal Portrush. First
reserve is Inverallachy's Steven Young, the British and Scottish boys
champion.

ITALIAN GRAND PRIX
BRITAIN'S Damon Hill was given a one-race ban, suspended for one race,
after a collision with arch-rival Michael Schumacher which eliminated
both from the Italian Grand Prix yesterday.
The crash, the latest in a series of clashes between Hill and the
German world champion, overshadowed the victory of Hill's compatriot
Johnny Herbert, just as a similar collision did at July's British Grand
Prix at Silverstone.
To complete a miserable day for the Williams team, Scotland's David
Coulthard, who had started from pole position, spun off while leading
the race.
Hill lost control of his Williams at the second chicane on the
twenty-fourth lap of the 53-lap race when he appeared to be attacking
Schumacher's hold on second position.
The Williams collided with the Benetton and both spun off, Hill
afterwards blaming another driver in front for upsetting his braking as
he approached the chicane.
Schumacher was livid and had to be pulled away from Hill by the track
marshalls immediately after the collision when he climbed from his car.
Benetton lodged an official protest at Hill's part in the incident and
Schumacher blamed the Briton. Hill blamed Taka Inoue of the Footwork
team, who was being lapped, and said the Japanese driver should be
thrown out of Grand Prix racing.
Schumacher said: ''I turned into the corner not expecting anything,
just a normal entry into the corner. I was really into it and I know I
braked late when suddenly I felt a big crash from behind and Damon went
into me.''
Hill verbally blasted Inoue as he marched back to the Williams trucks.
''This guy should not have a licence. It's just ridiculous as he just
changed his line in front me twice. He let Schumacher go past and then
he blocked me.''
Schumacher, referring to Hill's protests over his difficulties in
passing Inoue, said: ''Racing drivers should know what they are doing
when they overtake people.''
Hill said they discussed the incident but added: ''We did not agree --
it seems we can never agree on anything.''
The Ferraris of Frenchman Jean Alesi and Austrian Gerhard Berger led
the race at different times but they, too, failed to finish.
Herbert completed the 53 laps in his Benetton 17.7sec clear of Mika
Hakkinen of Finland driving a McLaren. Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Germany
was third in a Sauber to claim the best result of his career.
Herbert's win, following his first Formula One triumph in the British
Grand Prix, lifted him to third in the drivers' championship. Details:
1, J Herbert (Britain) Benetton 1hr 18min 27.916sec (average speed
145.292mph); 2, M Hakkinen (Finland) McLaren at 17.779sec; 3, H-H
Frentzen (Germany) Sauber at 24.321; 4, M Blundell (Britain) McLaren at
28.223; 5, M Salo (Finland) Tyrrell at 1 lap; 6, J-C Boullion (France)
Sauber at 1; 7, M Papis (Italy) Footwork at 1; 8, T Inoue (Japan)
Footwork at 1; 9, P Diniz (Brazil) Forti at 3; 10, U Katayama (Japan)
Tyrrell at 6.
World drivers' championship standings (after 12 races): 1, Schumacher
66pts; 2, Hill 51; 3, Herbert 38; 4, Alesi 32; 5, Coulthard 29; 6,
Berger 25. Other Britons: 9, Blundell 10; 12, Brundle 7; 13, Irvine 6.
Constructors' championship: 1, Benetton 94; 2, Williams 74; 3, Ferrari
57; 4, McLaren 21; 5, Sauber 17; 6, Ligier 16.
Benetton deducted 10 points and Williams six for fuel irregularities.

A new breed of 'incomers' has no regrets about taking the road to the
isles.
FOR more than a century, the big glen above Loch Duagrich has been
virtually deserted. The ruins of ''black houses'' scattered on the
hillsides bear mute testimony to the loss of a crofting community
numbering several hundred that thrived in this remote valley on Skye in
the 1850s. It has long been a lonely place where eagles soared over a
mere handful of hardy souls clinging to their ancestral lands.
Now wee Ella McCran is bringing life back to Glenmore with her
laughter. She is a bright-eyed scamp who likes nothing better than
scrambling around the ruins with her best friend from Portree primary
school. Three years ago, her horizons were limited to a row of terraced
villas in a Dunfermline housing estate. Now they extend over a
magnificent sweep of hills and forests and rivers to the jagged peaks of
the Black Cuillins. The playground outside her door is now bigger than
the town she came from.
The transition in Ella's life is part of a trend that has reversed the
depopulation of Skye and neighbouring Lochalsh to the point where it has
the fastest-growing community in the Highlands. From well below 9000 in
1971, it has risen steadily to almost 12,000 and there are no signs of
the momentum slowing.
It is still a far cry from the days when 30,000 people lived on Skye
alone, but local council leaders are encouraged by a mood of optimism
and confidence introduced by a new breed of ''incomers'' with young
families prepared to put down roots on the island.
''The influx has increased pressures on existing services, and
particularly for affordable housing,'' says David Noble, chief executive
of Skye and Lochalsh District Council. ''But we're quite happy to deal
with problems of growth. Overall it has been positive in reviving some
of the smaller, outlying communities.''
Mr Noble admits there is still occasional resentment of insensitive
''white settlers'', but insists that most recent arrivals have adapted
well to the Hebridean way of life. ''No doubt there have been incidents
of friction, but in a remarkable number of cases people coming in have
actually reinforced local traditions. It's been getting harder to tell
the difference between them and those whose families have been here for
generations.''
In the wilds of Glenmore, the McCran family is a classic example. John
McCran and his wife Linda, both social workers from Edinburgh, look as
if they had been born to the island life.
Their white-washed cottage by a single-track road is the kind that
adorns picture postcards, and inside it has the cosy feel of a family
home where a crofter would happily put his feet up by the fire after a
day in the hills. The McCrans and their children Cole, 13, and Ella,
eight, have acquired ruddy complexions, and only their Lowland accents
betray them as ''incomers''.
After visiting friends in Skye for years, they made the move
themselves from Dunfermline three years ago when Linda was offered a job
as manager of a community advice service in Portree. John had always
been attracted by the idea of living in a rural community, but Linda was
not so sure.
''It was a huge decision for us,'' she recalls. ''But both of us had
been under huge pressure at work in Dunfermline, we were always stressed
out, and we were looking for a better quality of life. When this
opportunity came we took the view that we should at least give it a try,
or we might regret it later.''
So they moved, lock, stock, and computer games to arguably the most
remote settlement on the island, a scattering of old crofts at the end
of a narrow road winding for more than 1000 feet up into Glenmore, six
miles from Portree. ''We wanted a family house we could afford, a
garden, some privacy, and good scenery,'' says John. ''This seemed to be
the answer.''
It is certainly about as far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife
as one can get without falling off the planet. There are only 14 other
people living in the huge glen, and when the mist and clouds descend
over the wild moorland the impression is not so much of being on an
island as on another world. ''It is a wee bit off the beaten track,''
John concedes with fine understatement.
They get snowed in three or four times every winter, but it is not a
source of much concern. ''The man with the council contract for keeping
the road clear lives fairly close by, so we know we'll get out
eventually,'' John says. ''If it's a blizzard, we just snuggle in and
get a fire going. If it's a clear day, we get the sledges out.''
After a few months of casual work planting trees and collecting
winkles, John was appointed assistant manager of The Cabin, a mental
health project in Portree. A drop-in centre for people having difficulty
coping with life, it offers advice, counselling, and a range of social
activities ranging from fishing to photography.
With their vocation for serving the community that has adopted them,
the McCrans are popular figures. ''We've been made to feel very
welcome,'' Linda says. ''We've never once felt any resentment or
hostility. People almost go out of their way to be pleasant.''
John agrees: ''I think if people come to the Highlands and put up wire
round their houses, they'll get exactly what they ask for. But if you're
prepared to adapt and integrate, then you'll be accepted.''
John's circle of friends expanded considerably when he began playing
football for the local heroes, Portree United. His biggest thrill
recently was seeing his name in the local newspaper after scoring a goal
against arch-rivals Dunvegan. The fact that the opposition scored four
goals, thereby clinching the West Highland League title, did not
diminish his pleasure.
The McCrans have no thoughts of ever leaving Skye, but accept that
their children may have to. ''It's inevitable if they want to go to
university,'' John says. ''And because industries are plugged into the
universities, the bright young kids and the expertise needed to sustain
the Highlands tend to go down south and stay there. It seems a shame.''
In the meantime, they are happy to enjoy a new-found quality of life
revolving around rambling in the hills and forests, fishing for brown
trout in the rivers, and simply sitting outside their croft on a
summer's day soaking up the peace and quiet.
John always knows where his car keys are -- they are left in the
ignition -- but locating the house keys can be a problem. The one time
they were used, the family was locked out.
''I can't quite believe it sometimes,'' says Linda. ''I can walk all
the way home from Portree and never worry about getting mugged or raped.
My kids can play on their own anywhere, and I'm not worried about them
getting mixed up in drugs or violence.
''On my way to work one day, I saw a bunch of crows chasing an eagle.
How about that? It beats the hell out of an Edinburgh traffic jam.''
A few miles away, the Slater family also has a new outlook on life. It
is of a leafy lane running down to a sea loch on the outskirts of
Portree, a world away from the red-brick monotony of Mansfield from
whence they came six years ago.
Phil Slater, his wife Anne, and their children Daniel, 11, and Luke,
nine, are now installed in a modern bungalow which has a separate office
for Phil's business as a graphic designer.
Like the McCrans, it was disenchantment with the pressures of urban
life and the prospect of a steady job in a healthy environment that
brought them to Skye. But driving up from Kyleakin for the first time on
a winter's night, Anne wondered where on earth they had come to.
''I remember it seemed so empty. You drove for miles, and all you saw
was sheep. I suddenly thought how far away I was from my own family, and
I felt isolated. But we soon settled. The local people have been very
kind to us.''
Anne is returning the compliment by working as a care assistant in an
old folk's home, while Phil has been enlisted as community services
officer by the Round Table, to help raise funds for diverse necessities
such as wheelchairs and shinty helmets.
He has also been appointed a director of a new radio station, Cuillins
FM, which is due to go on the air for the first time today. He has
agreed to host two one-hour programmes each week, focusing on community
groups.
''We're glad to be able to put something back into a community that
has accepted us with such hospitality and generosity,'' he says. ''There
are always some Scots who just don't like English people, even if
they've never met any, but you get xenophobes everywhere. We've
experienced a spontaneous kindness here that you'd just never find in
Nottinghamshire.''
Their younger son, Luke, is putting down even deeper roots. Having
attended a Gaelic nursery school, because it was the only one available
at the time, he opted for a Gaelic-medium class in primary school, and
is now fluent in the language. He also plays a mean chanter.
The family is looking forward to the winter, when the tourists have
gone and their favourite beach on the west coast is deserted. Then it
will be time to gather driftwood, make a bonfire, and drink coffee while
the big Atlantic rollers break on the shore.
Not everyone welcomes this new blood to Skye, fearing it will dilute
the old Hebridean strain. The taxi driver taking me to the ferry
terminal at Armadale says: ''It's a shame, the old ways are dying out.
Some of these incomers don't just want to live here, they want to change
everything to suit themselves. Soon it won't be like Skye at all, any
more.''
He pauses for reflection, and adds: ''But there's good folk among
them, right enough. I suppose there's good and bad in everything.''
The good is that up in Glenmore, as night falls, anyone passing along
the road will see lights shining from windows that once were dark, and
hear wee Ella McCran's laughter.

MORE than 300 years ago a box of cloth from London was delivered to a
pretty Derbyshire village. A few days later the man who opened it was
dead. He was just the first. It was the start of a tragic episode in the
village's history, one which has made Eyam famous all over the world.
Eyam (pronounced ''eem'') is in the heart of the Peak District,
sandwiched between the industrial centres of Derby, Manchester and
Sheffield. It's a quiet village, discreetly signposted and tends to be
ignored by the TV tourists making their pilgrimage to Peak Practice
country. Yet Eyam's story is far more interesting than any medical
drama.
It began in September 1665 when the cloth for the village tailor
arrived from his suppliers in London. It turned out to be infested with
rat fleas, the carriers of the bubonic plague which was sweeping the
capital at the time. Within three weeks the tailor's assistant, who
opened the parcel, and five close neighbours were dead. Today you can
still see their neat little cottages, arked with plaques. You can't go
inside because people still live there, but this helps to make them more
compelling. It's as if the past is somehow alive.
Of course Eyam wasn't the only place outside London to get bubonic
plague. There had been outbreaks up and down the country since 1347 and
some settlements had been completely wiped out -- not even featuring on
maps today. What made the place unique was the calm way in which the
villagers dealt with the disease. They would have recognised the
symptoms, like the distinctive ring of red sores on the skin (the Ring
of Roses in the nursery rhyme), but even as the death toll rose they
didn't panic.
By May 1666, 73 people in Eyam had already died -- a significant
number in a small community. They knew that things could only get worse
during the heat of summer. So, at a meeting called by their religious
leaders, they agreed to place themselves under quarantine, to prevent
the disease spreading to other towns and villages: effectively
sacrificing themselves to save others. The village cut itself off from
the world and walked into history.
The quarantine conditions appear to have been strictly observed --
perhaps because this was a deeply religious community. The village was
not self- sufficient, so a supply system had to be set up or they would
have starved. Free food and medicine was donated by the Earl of
Devonshire from nearby Chatsworth House. This was left at specified
pick-up points, where villagers could also leave requests for extra
items. In order to wash away the plague, the money to pay for them was
left in running water or in holes drilled into stones and filled with
vinegar. Walk to the Boundary Stone today and you can still clearly see
the hollows, now worn smooth with time and weather.
Although the villagers tried hard to cut down the risk of cross
infection, the death rate increased dramatically -- 56 in July, 78 in
August. They still held church services, but in the open air now, and
funerals were no longer held in the graveyard.
The custom of burying bodies 6ft deep originated in London during the
plague, but no-one can be sure whether this was followed here. People
buried their own dead wherever they could, on waste ground, in fields
and in gardens. I found these little plots immensely moving,
particularly the graves of the Hancock family. They're now enclosed by a
wall and mark the spot where a woman had to bury her husband and six
children within the space of one week.
Many other graves are unmarked and local residents must take care not
to dig too deeply in their gardens, in case they unearth human remains.
What I like about Eyam is its simplicity. There are no bubonic burgers
or Ye Olde Plague Teas for sale. Nor is there an authentically smelly
''time tunnel'' filled with wax plague victims and black rats. Yet the
past still seems to seep from every stone and even the most
sophisticated kids find the place fascinating. The local people, many of
whom can trace their roots in the village back to the time of the
plague, are determined to keep things this way.
They don't want Eyam to become mummified but to retain its dignity as
a close working community. Apart from the many plague cottages and the
graves, there is plenty more to see. Eyam Hill, built shortly after the
plague, is a fine manor house and there's a small, but interesting
museum. The church is also worth a visit. Among its contents is a
cupboard which is said to be made from the wood of the box which
contained the deadly flea infested cloth.
By the time the plague had run its course in November 1666, 260 people
had died, over one-third of the population. The community was devastated
-- some people had lost as many as nine members of their family. But the
courage of the villagers had saved hundreds more.

A VOYAGE on Scandinavian Seaway's Princess of Scandinavia is really
something. This elderly, 1976, vessel may be only a ferry but its
regular services between Harwich and Sweden's Gothenburg is a treat.
Cinema shows, discos, bingo, keep-fit classes, swimming pools, gambling
and shopping together with a trio of restaurants and bars make short
work of the 24-hour crossing and at the end of the voyage, the biggest
treat of all -- the city of Gothenburg.
Landfall is the west coast of the country, the approach being made via
the plethora of islands including Vinga's solid lighthouse and the
Elfsborg fortress, both celebrated Gothenburg landmarks. Disembarkation
takes place in the shadow of the graceful Alrsborgsbron Bridge.
Buses take one into town (for cyclists there is a fine network of
two-lane cycleways). Being a major port, the city is very much a working
one with few frills but nevertheless, in addition to fine shops, there
is much for the visitor to see and do even within the urban confines.
For a stay of a few days or more it is advantageous to purchase a
''Goteborg Card'' entitling the holder to free road and water
sightseeing tours, entry to the numerous museums, use of city trams and
buses. The cost is 300 Kroner or about #27 and, if you have a car, it
includes free parking -- alone more than #1 an hour in the city centre.
The port is a big attraction and boat tours of it run every 15 minutes
via the network of canals that gives to Gothenburg an aura of Amsterdam.
A grid of pedestrianised streets make for undisturbed window-gazing, the
Liseberg Amusement Park on somewhat similar lines to Copenhagen's Tivoli
Gardens is a mecca for families, the Tradgardsforeningen city park's
3000-variety English rose garden make for a link with home, and, further
afield, your ''Goteborg Card'' offers you gratis day excursions to some
of the islands as well as a trip to Denmark and back.
In the port a four-masted sailing vessel, a Second World War destroyer
and submarine are available to explore from stem to stern. Here too is
the mouth of the Gotha Canal from which cruise boats voyage into
Sweden's interior.
Within hours I had generated an affection for a city where the second
language is English and when I left for Stockholm on that country's
super-efficient railway I had come to understand why its citizens so
love the place. Further details from the Swedish Travel &amp; Tourism
Council, 73 Welbeck Street, London, W1M 8AN.

I HAVE sacrificed a lock of hair in the interests of medical science.
That may seem a small sacrifice to some of you, but for me it is a
generous gesture.
A close study of the picture which appears above my name will confirm
that in the hair department I have a paucity of supply.
However, there we were at the Royal Show and there was the Scottish
Agricultural College needing hair samples to test out a theory relating
to heart disease.
In general terms, the thinking is that a high concentration of calcium
in the hair indicates a low concentration in the aorta -- ''the main
vessel in our arterial system which spreads oxygen-rich blood from the
heart to all parts of the body.''
A low concentration in the aorta could be a good sign of healthy,
unclogged arteries.
Heart disease and stroke are the chief causes of death in the Western
world. If it can be proved that a simple test on a very small sample of
hair gives an early danger warning then there are more opportunities for
taking preventive action.
As the SAC cheerfully puts it, ''this would not only extend life
expectancy in those who would otherwise have died prematurely but would
enhance the quality of life into old age for many who would have had
their lifestyle severely curtailed''.
So the measurement of the calcium concentration in hair is being
evaluated as a way of assessing the risk of coronary heart disease.
Populations it seems, normally divide into two groups -- those with a
high concentration of calcium in the hair and those with a low count.
The low group would have a mean value of about 350 parts per million
(ppm) and the high group about 1500ppm. The dividing line between the
two groups falls at about 700ppm.
The SAC's research, under Dr Allan MacPherson, of the Biochemical
Sciences Department at Auchincruive in Ayrshire, shows that between 90%
and 97% of people who suffered heart attacks belonged (as I do) to the
low-hair calcium group.
With European financing, the college is collating hair samples from
5000 men in 50 health districts throughout the UK, covering the
standardised mortality rations for coronary heart disease.
If that survey establishes a significant relationship between hair
calcium levels and the known risk of coronary heart disease, the
likelihood is that the hair test could be introduced as an initial
non-invasive screening procedure.
Early detection of risk would allow those of us in the low count area
to take the appropriate steps which should result in a change in calcium
levels in the hair and a decreased risk of coronary heart disease.
This would, in turn, have major implications in reducing the costs of
the National Health Service.
Personally I have quite a mountain to climb when it comes to forcing
calcium into the hair follicles. It would be much easier if you could
smooth it on like Brylcreem, but I don't suppose that would do much
good.
My count is 250ppm compared to a mean value for all Royal Show
participants of 573ppm -- and the desirable level, you will recall, is
in excess of 700ppm. Some lucky so-and-so's have levels of 1500.
Dr MacPherson is not a GP, but when I phoned him to ask what kind of
dietary changes might be desirable he sounded very much like one (like
mine anyway).
Things that might help, he suggests, are eating more fruit and
vegetables and taking more exercise. That is in line with current advice
on coronary prevention.
Exercise apparently uses up some of the calcium in the aorta and the
fruit and veg will provide anti-oxidants to prevent damage to the aorta
walls. Together they will help to eliminate some of the ''baddies'' from
the system -- which is my understanding of much talk about ''free
radicals'', active molecules, and metabolisms.
At the end of the day it all sounds like the kind of advice I have
had, and ignored, in the past. However, it just so happens that on the
day before I received Dr MacPherson's letter with the results of my
test, I had started one of my periodic health kicks.
Two apples for lunch and, whenever possible, a brisk half-hour walk at
lunchtime -- that's the new regime. Trouble is I have done it all before
-- many, many times. The good news is, however, that it is never too
late to start. ''You can improve the situation by change at any time,''
said Dr Macpherson.
You may, like me, be wondering what all this heart research has to do
with an agricultural college. Dr Macpherson's background, after all, is
in the field of animal nutrition.
The answer is simple -- funds for research in that area became scarce,
but the European Union was prepared to support his current work. The SAC
is now a very broad church indeed.

Paris
FRENCH President Jacques Chirac said tonight he would use more troops
to guard public facilities against a wave of bomb attacks in what he
called a war against terrorists.
France implemented a security plan this week, including putting troops
on security duties after bomb attacks which have killed seven people and
wounded more than 120 in six weeks.
''We will call in more troops to free police from missions of static
control and guard,'' Chirac told TF1 television. ''We have virtually
reached total mobilisation.''
Algerian Muslim fundamentalist guerrillas are suspected of being
behind the bombings but Chirac said there was scarce information on what
the bombers were trying to achieve.
He condemned those responsible as ''savage animals'' and suggested
they were Islamic militants, but not a team of terrorists infiltrated
into France from outside.
In the television interview, Chirac also accused Australia and New
Zealand of using his decision to resume nuclear weapons testing in the
South Pacific to try to drive France out of the region.
And he said independence campaigners in French Polynesia had taked
advantage of the protests by the Greenpeace environmental pressure group
and ''certain foreigners'' to send looters into the streets of Tahiti
last week.
''What the Australians and the New Zealanders can't stand is that we
are in the Pacific,'' Chirac said.
He said neither Australian protests nor public opinion polls showing a
majority of French voters oppose his policy would deter him from
completing the six to eight nuclear tests necessary to secure the future
of France's arsenal.--Reuter/AP.

TONY MAJOR and Mr John Blair are not going to like this. I'm sorry, I
will start that again. Mr John Major and Mr Tony Blair are not going to
like this. Spot the difference? What's in a name when their positions
are so similar? At the next election -- autumn next year, or spring
1997, say -- are we to change governments, or merely Prime Ministers?
What is Mr Blair for that differentiates him from Mr Major? The question
is given urgency by the Labour leader's warning in an interview
yesterday that this could be his party's last chance to defeat the
Tories.
''If the left of centre really cannot find in these circumstances the
intelligence, the vision, and the discipline to present a coherent
alternative, it's hard to see in what circumstances it can,'' he tells
the Observer. The emphasis, I suspect, is on ''discipline''. There is to
be no going back to decades-old policy. That ''complacency'' is to be
''smashed''.
We know that he is young, new, vigorous, and that he articulates a
vision of Britain that is vaguely different. We know that the opinion
polls indicate that the country is weary of Tory rule and looks like
ending it in 1997, if Mr Major can last that long. We know that ''New
Labour'' is determined to gain power and will do nothing to frighten the
Middle England electorate.
But what is Mr Blair for? He is for ''a fairer society'' of course;
who isn't? But he is against wholesale redistribution of wealth. He is
for a minimum wage in principle, but against a set figure. He is for
better education and health, but he is against commitment to the
taxation to make it possible.
He stands shoulder to shoulder with the Prime Minister on the two big
life-or-death issues of the day, Bosnia and Northern Ireland. Like Mr
Major, he supports our membership of Nato and the European Union. Like
Mr Major, he is silent on France's nuclear tests in the Pacific.
Both believe that inflation must not be turned on and off for
political advantage and that steady economic growth must replace periods
of boom and bust. Neither can promise old-fashioned job security, even
for the middle classes, whom they both need.
Neither wants another housing boom; neither has a plan to rescue
people from the privations of re-possession and negative equity.
The Tories believe that privatisation will make the railways work so
much better that they won't need to tax drivers off the roads. Mr Blair
is against this and will try to block it. But what, precisely, would he
do about the railways? I assume that Labour is brim-full of policies,
but we must wait to see what commitment is to be given to them.
Mr Blair, to be sure, is for devolution to Scotland and Wales, to be
enacted in the first parliamentary session of a Labour government. The
idea is to give a Scottish administration tax-raising powers but, even
after all this time, it is still unclear how this is to be done. Mr
Major says that a Scottish parliament will kill the Union; Mr Blair says
that it will sustain it. Tam Dalyell and the West Lothian question still
haunt the Braveheart argument.
We are reassured (if that is the word) that John's Smith's commitment
to a referendum on voting reform is still an essential ingredient of
constitutional reform. Mr Blair's home affairs spokesman, Jack Straw,
denigrates unworthy beggars in a way that Mr Major and the Home
Secretary, Mr Howard, have not yet had the candour to do.
So there are some differences between Mr Major and Mr Blair, but not
enough, according to some in the Labour Party (the view is largely
suppressed, so far). We got a glimpse of the insipient irritation with
the blandness of Blairism during the summer months. A few brave souls
ignored their leader's designer suits and quiet ties: ''Can't see our
emperor's clothes'', they said, childlike and fairy-tale innocent.
Blair declairs with passion that he detests the status quo in the
running of the country, but all his utterances are directed at not
upsetting the status quo. The way to get ''last chance'' power is to
make as few enemies along the way as possible.
The history of Opposition leaders gaining power supports him in this
strategy. But most of that history was made pre-media dominance.
Now, irritating journalists keep asking in the newspapers and on the
airwaves: ''Yes, but what would you do?'' If we expect him to divulge
this just yet, we are deluding ourselves. This week at the TUC Congress,
dissenting voices may grow in the decibel or sound-bite levels.
Following that, at the Labour Party conference, more dissent may make
itself heard.
Come the November Budget, it may be that the Chancellor can find a way
to cut taxes. If so, will Mr Blair denounce them? More likely he will
declare that the thrust is right but the execution is wrong. Supposing
the Chancellor and the Prime Minister risk their new-found party unity
by denying tax cuts in the interest of ongoing stable recovery? Will Mr
Blair denounce them for failing to deliver the path to a 20p in the
pound standard rate? Or will he say that the Government is absolutely
right, this is no time for tax cuts?
It is going to be difficult enough for the Prime Minister to deliver
tax cuts with Government borrowing rising rather than subsiding. In
these circumstances the middle classes will be watching Mr Blair's every
word. So far he has got by on replicating the policies of the ertswhile
Social Democratic Party. Had these been put in place in the eighties by
Michael Foot, Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, and Dr David Owen would
still be leading lights in the Labour Party.
It took subsequent Labour leaders, Kinnock, Smith, and now Blair, to
put the SDP's reforming demands into place. This done, what does Labour
say to us now? We can't be worse than the other lot, so trust us? We'll
give you capitalism in the Social Democratic style. This is fine, but it
looks like Majorism, does it not? The sort of thing the Tory right wing
complains about.
So far Majorism and Blairism can be defined thus: Major still talks
about the politics of envy and Blair talks about the politics of social
justice. They are mere phrases that serve to help unite their respective
party factions. Constitutional issues, from domestic devolution to
European policy, divide the two ''isms'' -- but both leaders know that
such comparatively arcane debate cannot be relied on to deliver power.
In the polling booths in the North of England, the Midlands and the
South, and maybe even Scotland, the middle-class voters will need
something more to be convinced that their lot will improve. They are the
largest section of voters now and they tend to vote with their pockets
(or, more likely, their overdrafts).
They may well vote for the same government with a different party
leader if it suits their purses. In which case Mr Blair may need to make
more class enemies to succeed and Mr Major, many more friends.

COUNCILLOR J McCarron recently complained that he is angry at
criticism of Tony Blair coming from the left in Scotland.
What does he expect? The Blairight camp pushes candidates from the
professional middle classes, has no commitment to redistribution of
wealth, or even a guaranteed minimum wage.
Nothing changes for the majority of the working class who now provide
the sweatshop labour in electronics factories and service industries.
New Labour denies the class struggle and for that reason should rename
itself ''New Conservatives''.
To deny the class struggle is to deny the essence of the Labour Party.

YESTERDAY the Iraqi National Assembly voted unanimously for Saddam
Hussein, the existing President, to be the sole candidate in a new
presidential election to be held within the next two months. The
election is effectively a referendum to endorse Saddam and it will be
held by secret ballot. This will be the first such vote since the
revolution of 1958 which overthrew the British-imposed monarchical
regime, killing the young king and his chief minister, Nuri es Said. The
ballot will be observed by foreign delegates, including some hundreds of
journalists, from Western and other Arab states (but not Kuwait). How
far that, and the pledged secrecy, will matter to voters, or to the
outcome, is not likely to inspire much guesswork. In a society with no
freedom and no independent law, and a long history of the most savage
reprisal against any sort of opposition, it would take much courage to
abstain from voting, never mind voting against the sole nominee. The
commonplace mechanisms of liberal democracy are sought after by regimes
such as Iraq's but any reality invested in them is negligible, though
the craving for the legitimacy they confer is real enough.
Yesterday's unanimity was eloquent of the plight of the legislators
involved. Even allowing for their hand-picked nature as Saddam
supporters, any body of 250 people might have been expected to contain
the odd man out, especially when the regime has been so massively
unsuccessful in its chosen policies. Any dissenters would, however,
merely have been advertising their own suicide. It is only possible to
oppose Saddam by arms as part of an established grouping (like the Kurds
or the Shi'ites) and even there the dice are loaded in his favour; or to
flee abroad. This latter option is not open to many people, but it has
been taken by two of Saddam's sons-in-law and their immediate families.
The most senior of these defectors, General Kamel Hassan, in an
interview in the current issue of Time magazine, predicts that a
combined popular and military rising against Saddam is ready for
launching any time. The National Assembly's decision shows how hard it
will be for that to arise, even if the defections themselves are proof
that Saddam has enemies right at the heart of his command, among those
whose personal preferment was hardly to be doubted.
General Kamel Hassan laid out a general political programme which will
appeal to the magazine's readers: Iraq should be a stable secure country
with pluralism and political parties, and without the shameful
executions. The only Middle Eastern society that most nearly meets these
criteria is Israel, though Kuwait approximates, and a great effort is
being made to move Egypt in their direction, no matter how slowly. The
chance of Iraq, even if relieved of Saddam Hussein, being moved
similarly is slight, though plenty in the exiled groups in the West
would jump at the chance to try.
Before the chance appears, Saddam must be overthrown. There seems
little chance that he will go into exile himself, though in theory the
referendum might offer an outcome which would leave him with little
alternative. General Kamel Hassan's claim to know the dissident
personnel and the detailed plans of their plotting to encompass the
violent overthrow of his father-in-law can hardly carry much conviction,
though it would be comforting to believe it. His view that a conjunction
of popular and military discontent is needed seems beyond dispute, but
their deliberate fomenting remains improbable, an opinion underlined by
the necessity of his own need to escape. Something unplanned,
spontaneous, and so unanticipated by the regime, seems more probable,
though few will feel able to predict its timing.

IT HAS been a long, hot summer on Loch Lomond, increasingly a large
stretch of water surrounded by controversy and acrimony. On close
examination the loch's environment is showing even greater signs of wear
and tear, as are many of the poor souls associated with it, and,
crucially, there are still no by-laws in place to regulate loch use.
After years of consultation, confrontation and compromise, hearts are
heavy at the prospect of a public inquiry into the existing by-law
proposals while the by-law package, so painstakingly midwifed by the
Loch Lomond Park Authority, languishes on the sidelines -- the victim of
a late objection by the Scottish Sports Council.
The putative five-knot speed limit within 150 metres of most
shorelines is in open disrepute and the sensitive areas which would be
specially protected by the by-laws are being treated with ill-disguised
contempt by speed boaters and jet skiers. Meantime, the #80,000 patrol
boat with its crew of water rangers is all dressed up with nothing to
enforce, reduced to an advisory capacity when it should be enforcing
by-laws which do not yet exist.
Throughout the summer the misbehaviour by the speed craft users has
plumbed new depths.
* In the sensitive shallow area bounded by Inchcruin and Inchmoan
islands, known as the Geggles, an area where fast water sport would be
specifically forbidden under the ghost by-laws, as many as four
high-speed water ski boats have been reported operating simultaneously,
along with several jet skis, turning a favourite picnic area for
cruisers and families into an exclusion zone.
* There have also been well-documented incidents where fishermen in
the same area, with children on board their small craft, have been
deliberately driven at at high speed by a large power boat in answer to
gestures asking it to moderate its speed through prime salmon and sea
trout water. At the last moment the power craft's helm was thrown over
with the aim of sending a high wave toward the fishing dinghy.
* A number of new cases have also gained currency among loch users of
anglers trolling for salmon down the east shore being deliberately
driven at by water ski boats with the aim of cutting lines. An official
of the main angling body, the Loch Lomond Angling Improvement
Association (LLAIA), says many anglers are now physically afraid to
complain. Water ski and ''doughnut'' boats are operating through the
prime fishing grounds off practically every island.
* A complaint was made to police of two jet skiers who had been
driving at high speed around the moored Maid of The Loch then travelling
all out down the River Leven, through a group of young boys swimming
across the river, and down to the public slipway at Balloch. The area is
designated in the by-laws as one of environmental sensitivity where wake
should be kept down and one where public safety is a paramount
consideration. The police officer to whom the complaint was made said he
would have to wait for his partner to arrive in case the jet skiers
''cut up rough''. The complainer has heard nothing further.
* The bad behaviour is taking new forms, highlighted in complaints
from caravanners on the ''quiet'' east side of Loch Lomond that power
boats with ghetto blaster radios are tearing up and down close to shore
playing rock music at full volume in the early hours of the morning. One
caravan site manager says that customers have left in disgust saying
they will never come back after the arrival on the east shore of a
mobile disco in the early hours with several dozen people celebrating a
21st birthday. There is even a large disco boat operating on the loch
with lasers and loud music into the early hours.
* When the unofficial shore access point at Auchentullich Bay on the
lower west shore was closed off by a gate because disturbance from water
skiers, jet skiers and speed boaters had reached outrageous levels, a
group was observed producing oxy-acetylene cutting equipment to
dismantle the padlock. When this was reinstated others arrived with a
Range Rover, hitched a chain around the gate post and ripped it from the
ground.
The Scottish Sports Council, the body who dispense Scottish cash to
various sports organisations, are not, of course, responsible for the
degenerate behaviour. But the objection of the council to the proposals
is mystifying many loch users and is subject to several interpretations.
Although their chief executive, Clive Alstead, refused to disclose to
The Herald exactly what the nature of the council's representation to
the Scottish Secretary is, he expressed a devout hope that no public
inquiry would be necessary.
Alstead and his council have, however, caused widespread dismay on the
loch itself where the perception has taken hold that the council have
acted on behalf of the water skiers to the exclusion of the dozens of
other water users who are excluded from practising their particular
sports by the noise, the disturbance, the pollution and the sheer danger
occasioned by water skiing.
Much of the disquiet centres on the obvious conclusion that the
Scottish Sports Council appear not to regard as relevant to their
function questions of environmental sustainability or the precautionary
principle -- the idea that should there be a fear of environmental
damage caused by an activity that activity should be curtailed
regardless of whether immediate empirical evidence is available.
What is apparent is that a vast credibility gap has grown up between
the people on the loch itself and the council. Alstead said that his
council has objected on behalf of many sport governing bodies, including
canoeists, yachtsmen and anglers -- precisely the loch users who lose
out from water skiing.
Yet the Loch Lomond Angling Improvement Association, a venerable,
highly active body with a vast monetary and emotional investment in Loch
Lomond, express outrage at the Sports Council's actions.
The representative of the only Royal Yachting Association club on the
loch, the quaintly named Clyde Canoe Club -- which is a yacht-racing
body with more than 100 member boats (the name coming from the old sport
of canoe sailing) -- is equally incensed that the by-laws have been
deliberately stalled.
David Smith, commodore of the club, says he has written to the Sports
Council stating they should represent all sports, not just water skiing.
''Water skiers are detested throughout the country and banned
everywhere in England because of the noise and the danger. Their noise
goes on and on, round and round and they now start at five in the
morning on Loch Lomond. We are convinced that the real reason behind
this late objection is the well-founded fear that after Loch Lomond is
regulated every other loch in Scotland will follow suit. No-one wants
speed boaters, jet skiers or water skiers and the Scottish Sports
Council must be aware of this.''
Smith disclosed that two of his club's members have written to their
MP, Michael Forsyth -- the new Scottish Secretary -- drawing attention
to what is happening in his constituency.
''I understand several letters have been written so we would expect
that Mr Forsyth would be aware of the situation,'' said Smith. ''It will
be interesting to see if there is any meaningful reaction. Mr Forsyth is
not universally pouplar around here, but he could certainly increase his
public standing by being seen to be doing something to get the by-laws
in place.''
Forsyth will no doubt also have been made aware by his Scottish Office
civil servants that his predecessor, Ian Lang, and the then-environment
minister, Sir Hector Munro, both promised the Loch Lomond by-laws ''a
fair wind'', clearly holding out high hopes that their introduction
would rid them of a constant source of embarrassment occasioned by
Treasury refusal to sanction spending on a national park in Scotland.
The Scottish Sports Council told the LLAIA, whose membership, once
1000 strong, is much diminished because of the water sport free-for-all,
that they were objecting to the by-laws because of the lack of
consultation with national bodies, their unneccessary scope (they
considered them only to be needed at peak times) and their allegedly
ambiguous wording. They also claimed that the impact on water skiing
would be severe and would affect the loch's use ''as a regional
facility'' and that speed limit areas would lead to a decrease in safety
as water sports were forced into deeper water offshore.
The LLAIA in turn urged the council to consider the wider
implications, saying they should not be party to delaying tactics. They
also pointed out that consultations had been widespread, including with
the local water skiers, and that the by-laws represented the best
compromise for future harmonious use of Loch Lomond. Both the anglers
and the Loch Lomond Park Authority have pointed out also that under the
by-laws the water skiers would still have 12 miles of unrestricted
shoreline -- all in sheltered areas -- and that more than 95% of the
loch's vast surface was available to them provided they travelled at no
more than 50mph.
The vice-chairman of the LLAIA, Hamish Campbell, is at a loss to
understand why the water skiers have taken up a radical stance and
enlisted the Scottish Sports Council. It would be intolerable, he has
said to the council, if the good work and negotiation of years was to be
undermined at this late stage by a selfish minority with apparently
little regard for other loch users.
''We had a dialogue with the local water ski people,'' he said. ''We
agreed that we could live with them if they carried out their pastime
far away from the shorelines and in a proper fashion. They claim they
need calm water, but Loch Lomond is the same for everyone and they must
take the rough weather with the smooth. They say now that inshore speed
restrictions will make their sport more dangerous but if a sport is at
all dangerous for beginners or young people, as they say, they should
simply not be doing it.''
Jack Bisset, the by-laws officer at the Loch Lomond Park Authority,
who is watching his hard work and diplomacy threatened with being cast
into limbo, says the obvious solution, zoning of fast water sports, is
impossible because Loch Lomond has a unique right of navigation. The
right can be regulated and modified, which is what the by-laws intended.
Equally, because the right is unique, no precedent is set for other
Scottish lochs. In each case where local interests are currently
watching the Loch Lomond saga with trepidation and with an eye to
ensuring their lochs do not become speed-boat hellholes, Bissett
believes the same extensive consultation would have to be undertaken
before local rules could be put in place. The suggestion of precedent he
dismisses as ludicrous and the Sports Council's attitude, from their
correspondence, as reeking of arrogance.
The battle for the soul of Loch Lomond looks set to run and run; the
battleground has shifted to the Scottish Office where it appears that
the wisdom of Solomon will be required to reconcile increasingly
polarised views.

JOHN Carlyle's letter about a so-called ''dignity of unemployment''
(September 6) is as hilariously naive as it is offensive. He puts
himself above all the rest of those terrible proles, by claiming that he
is in the fortunate position to be able to select employment according
to his own personal criteria.
I am glad that he has never been so unlucky as to have found himself
in conditions so vulnerable that any job whatsoever is impressive. His
ludicrous assertions show he has very little grasp of the reality
principle.
May I be so cheeky as to ask Mr Carlyle to live on my student grant of
less than #900 per year and the proceeds of my part-time #2.97 per hour
job? Spiritual happiness is always that bit easier when the bills are
paid and there's a couple of bob in one's pocket.

<HEADLINE>Open-cast mining protest held in Heseltine's garden</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976437457</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AROUND 60 campaigners opposed to open-cast mining occupied the garden
of Mr Michael Heseltine's country home yesterday.
The group included environmentalists, mining support groups,
ex-miners, Native Americans, and Mrs Anne Scargill, wife of NUM leader
Arthur Scargill.
Deputy Prime Minister Heseltine was at home in Thenford House,
Northamptonshire, but did not speak to the protesters.
Demonstration co-ordinator Steve Parry said: ''He came to the bedroom
window, wearing lavender pyjamas. We understand that he is not pleased
by what is going on.''
The demonstrators scaled a fence to enter the garden at 5am.
They proceeded to stake off a small area as a mock open-cast mine and
laid out sods of earth to spell the words: ''No open-cast.''
The protesters have submitted a planning application to
Northamptonshire County Council to develop an open-cast mine in the
grounds of Thenford House.
Mr Parry said: ''We are looking forward to Mr Heseltine opposing that
application.
''If he believes that open cast mining shouldn't happen in his
picturesque estate, why should he permit it on beautiful green-field
sites elsewhere in the country?
''Open-casting is destroying our environment and damaging the lives of
thousands of people.
''Heseltine has a direct responsibility for this devastation through
his senseless destruction of the UK's deep mine coal industry.
''Our action today is in support of hundreds of local communities
opposing open-cast sites in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Wales,
Nottinghamshire, and elsewhere.''
Mr Parry added: ''We were surprised at how easy it was to enter the
grounds. You might expect the Deputy Prime Minister to have more
effective security.''
Police attended and warned the demonstrators they were trespassing,
but no arrests were made.
The protesters left after a six-and-a-half hour occupation.

ANOTHER busy week for company results is in prospect as the interim
reporting season continues with Thursday in particular once again
jampacked. Tommorrow, though, sees the half-year progress from
pharmaceuticals group Fisons whose war of words with hostile bidder
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) has grown increasingly sour.
RPR has dismissed the Fisons defence document against its #1700m bid
as failing to produce any evidence that the company is worth more, while
Fisons' chief executive Stuart Wallis described RPR's response as ''no
more than a recycling of old and tired arguments highlighting how much
RPR needs Fisons.''
Fisons' defence has so far kept its shares at a premium to RPR's 240p
a share offer with the market taking the view that the ante will need to
be lifted.
Analysts, meanwhile, are forecasting pre-tax profits in a range of
#30m-#37m against #30.4m last time. Clearly Fisons will be anxious to
make the figures look good although it will concentrate on prospects
under its 'new look' strategy. The interim dividend could be lifted to
1.8p from 1.7p as a litle extra sweetener for shareholders.
Wednesday has the interim figures from Kingfisher, the Woolworth,
Comet, and B&amp;Q group which is expected to report continued poor trading.
Profits are forecast to fall to #69m-#72.5m from #88.1m last time. The
damage will be done by Comet and B&amp;Q with steadier performances
elsewhere unable to offset this. However some increase in the 4.4p
dividend is not ruled out.
The Prudential is also due on Wednesday with analysts looking at a
range from #319m to as high as #342m, up from #280m for the same period
last year. The interim dividend is projected to be hiked from 4.9p to
5.25p.
Troubled United Biscuits (Thursday), which takes in McVitie's and
Keebler biscuits, McCoys crisps, and KP Nuts, has put its UK Keebler
business up for sale and forecast a cut in the interim dividend from
5.5p to 3.5p. It also warned in July that half-year profits would be
''substantially below'' last year's level at not more than #30m.
Analysts have pencilled in #27m up to #30m.
British Aerospace will be presenting its half-timer on Thursday buoyed
by recent news of a big regional jet order from Belgian airline Sabena.
There is a wide range of profit projections for the aerospace and
defence giant from #109m up to #165m after excluding an exceptional
charge of around #35m, giving a consensus of #132m which would compare
with #90m for the same period of 1994. The interim dividend could be
lifted from 4p to anywhere between 4.5p to 6p.

TODAY, Norweb's shares are expected to add to last week's gains with
the bid battle for the company expected to intensify with the
possibility of a counter offer from an American utility.
Norweb, the regional electricity company serving two million customers
in Manchester and North-west England, is already the subject of a
hostile #1600m offer from North West Water which has drawn criticism
from consumer groups and politicians from all sides.
Jack Cunningham, Labour's Trade and Industry spokesman, said: ''The
implications for competition, choice and an efficient market all need
examination before we reach a situation in Britain where half a dozen
private monopolies control vast areas of our lives.''
US power group Houston Industries is thought to be considering making
an offer for Norweb. Others mentioned as potential white knights include
California-based Pacific Gas and Electric, Florida Power &amp; Light and the
Texan utility Central and Southwest.
Combined utility companies are not an usual feature in the US.
Competitive pressures in their own market, (for example, the 1992
National Energy Policy Act which required the big companies to allow
independent producers and municipal suppliers access to transmission
systems), coupled with higher returns abroad are prompting American
electricity companies to look overseas.
American interest in the UK electricity sector has been further
fuelled by last month's successful #1100m takeover of South Western
Electricity (Sweb) by Southern Electric International of Atlanta,
Georgia.
Last Friday when it rejected North West Water's offer, Norweb said it
continued to be in talks with other interested parties. It had been in
discussions with North West Water for the best part of a year over
possible joint ventures to reduce costs. They are unlikely to have been
the only utility companies to hold such talks.
Meanwhile, the regulatory bodies governing both the water and
electricity industry are seeking outside views on North West Water's bid
in a consultative document. Norweb shares ended the week at #10.08p
compared with North West Water's cash and share offer which values each
Norweb share at about #10.22p.
There is a full cash alternative of 975p. Norweb wants a cash offer
comfortably exceeding #10.00 a share in return for a recommendation.
Whatever happens, original shareholders in the privatisation who still
retain their shares stand to make a killing. In 1990, Norweb was floated
at #2.40.
* THIS week Manweb will announce its package of giveaways to
shareholders, worth around #5 a share, in return for their support
against the hostile #1000m takeover bid from ScottishPower.

THE current year is expected to be disappointing for the motor
industry with global vehicle sales up by just 1%. While demand remains
strong in parts of Asia and Eastern Europe, sales have slowed down in
North America in line with the economy and the scrapping of sales
incentives in Europe has depressed demand.
Next year is expected to be better but not by much and the prospects
for new vehicle sales are not rosy. This is the view expressed in the
DRI World Car Industry Report published today, based on the prospect of
a lingering recession in the US, the risk of the Japanese economy
turning down, and the likelihood that the recovery in European sales may
remain subdued. On balance, DRI forecasts a rise in global vehicle sales
of less than 5%.
Looking at the UK motor industry, DRI notes that despite a third year
of domestic economic recovery the automotive industry, along with the
housing market, remains sluggish. The recovery in car sales has faltered
against a background of lower income tax allowances and higher excise
duties which has reduced consumers' disposable income.
Despite an attractive range of offers consumers are proving difficult
to entice into showrooms, with car sales expected to remain flat or show
only modest growth this year. Next year is expected to be better with
growth to 2.04 million, hitting a peak of 2.2 million in 1997/98 as the
General Election approaches. The 1989 peak of 2.3 million is not
expected to be recovered before the end of the decade.
Against this sluggish market background, UK car manufacturers are
surprisingly upbeat. This is due to the fact that exports are strong,
more than compensating for the weak domestic market.
Backed by a competitive pound and the strategic decision by the
Japanese to expand production in the UK, car production is expected to
finish the year at 1.54 million (up 5%), hitting a record 2.15 million
by the year 2000.
In addition to the Japanese, Rover, Vauxhall and Jaguar are all adding
capacity. Rover is increasing capacity at its Land Rover plant at
Solihull in Birmingham to meet strong export demand and prepare for the
new Sub-Discovery (codenamed Pathfinder) in 1997.
Meanwhile, Rover Cars will produce a new Rover 400 saloon and Rover
200 Series over the next six months. As part of the BMW Group, Rover's
medium-term plan is to boost production by 50% to 750,000 units.
Europe's car makers are going to unveil several news models this week.
The vehicles, costing billions of dollars to develop, will be on display
at the big Frankfurt car show.
The manufacturers can justly claim that the show will premiere an
unprecedented number of brand new, mainstream cars.
And the ballyhoo and free publicity promised by swarms of TV, radio
and newspaper reporters at the show will have to be divided between
Europe's mass car makers, desperate to fan interest from a public whose
buying confidence remains bruised from the recession.
The Opel Vectra, from General Motors' German subsidiary, makes its
debut, but will have to share the limelight with Peugeot of France's new
406 family car. The Swedish company Volvo Sweden unveils its S4.
Fighting it out in the small family car sector dominated by the Golf
of Germany's Volkswagen will be the new Megane from France's Renault and
Fiat of Italy's stylish debutant the Bravo.
If that is not enough to persuade the German public to swarm through
the turnstiles at the show, luxury car maker BMW will unveil its new 5
series. But even this will have to fight for attention from Mercedes'
recently introduced E class mid-range car.
* Greenville, South Carolina, Sunday -- Workers at BMW's new North
American plant have begun building the first of the German car maker's
new two-seat roadsters that will be sold to the public.
The first Z3s for public sale are now in the body and paint shops and
are expected to come off the assembly line in a few days, plant
spokesman Robert Hitt says.
''We're crawling the roadster into production and it will speed up
between now and the end of the year,'' he said.
The plant is making 55 to 60 318i sedans daily. By the end of the
year, workers are scheduled to be making about 120 cars a day, most of
them roadsters.

INDUSTRY and business leaders hope they will have a friend at the Bank
of England on the crucial issue of interest rates from today hen Howard
Davies takes up his post as Deputy Governor.
The former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry
brings with him an intimate knowledge of the concerns of all types of
business.
Analysts believe that, while he is unlikely to make a huge difference
to the Bank's policy stance, he will act as a counterweight to the
Governor Eddie George in any debate on important issues of monetary
policy.
The most important issue is the level of interest rates. The rate
remained unchanged after Thursday's crucial monthly meeting between
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Mr George.
But Mr Clarke will come under increasing pressure from his own
backbenchers and some business lobby groups to cut the rate in a bid to
boost the economy.
The Bank is thought to still support a rise to ensure the Government's
inflation target 2.5% by the General Election is met. The view of Mr
Davies's former employer, the CBI, is that rates should be held at
6.75%.
One leading City economist said: ''If there is a difference of view
then I think that Howard would be able to press his case strongly.
''This would reflect his entree into the higher reaches of industry
because of his recent history, and there is a sense in which he might be
able to convert that ethos into singing industry's tune.
''If he picks up strong hints from his various contacts and sources
that high interest rates would be deeply damaging, then he could press
that case.''
As far as the Bank is concerned, Mr Davies brings with him a
reputation for excellent connections within Whitehall, and more
significantly, with the Labour leadership.
After the embarrassing resignation of his predecessor Rupert
Pennant-Rea, who left in March after his former lover made allegations
about their relationship, the bank is anxious to re-establish its
reputation.
Mr Davies, 44, who was born in Manchester, had a classic Establishment
pedigree.
After Oxford, he worked as a civil servant in the Foreign Office and
the Treasury where he advised the then Chancellor Nigel Lawson on
monetary policy.
* CONSUMER spending is set to rise next year and the recovery is
likely to be sustained, new Bank of England Deputy Governor Howard
Davies said yesterday.
Mr Davies said that unlike previous years, wage-earners were set to
enjoy real-term rises for the first time in some years.
Other factors likely to underpin consumer spending were the maturity
next year of Tessas (tax-exempt building society saving schemes) and
pay-outs from building society mergers, he said.

THIS is the busy week in the month for economic statistics with key
indicators being published on inflation, retail sales, and unemployment.
In July, unemployment rose a little, breaking a long run of monthly
declines, but it was not clear whether this was a blip or the start of a
new trend.
With the economy slowing down to around its trend rate it would
occasion no great rise if the August figure, due out on Wednesday, was
again higher. Economists at James Capel have pencilled in a rise of
5000.
Average earnings growth has been held in check at historically low
levels this year, but with the trend in pay settlements picking up
average earnings may edge up from an annual rate of 3.5% in June to
3.75% in July.
On Thursday, inflation figures are expected to produce a
month-on-month increase in the retail price index of around 0.5%. This
would result in the headline rate picking up from 3.5% in July to 3.6%
in August.
Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, would
be unchanged at 2.8% and the RPIY measure, which excludes indirect and
local authority taxes as well as mortgage payments, would stick on 2.3%.
Producer prices figures for August are due this morning. Factory gate
price inflation is expected to rise by 0.3% on the month, leaving the
annual rate unchanged at 4.5%. Input prices may also rise by 0.3%, but
in this case the annual rate would drop from 10.3% to 9.3%.
Retail sales data are a volatile series, and after two months in each
of which there has been volume growth of 0.4%, Thursday's numbers for
August are difficult to forecast, especially given the prolonged summer
heatwave.
The CBI distributive trades survey was a touch gloomy last week.
Economists at Capel are still betting that the recovery on the High
Streets will continue. They forecast a rise of 0.3% taking year-on-year
growth up from 1.4% in July to 2%.

FARMER'S DIARY
BEWARE the Greeks bearing gifts -- beware the bankers offering lunch.
I thought everyone knew that, but apparently not. Big Hamish was down
the other day and he told me how he was looking forward to Friday. He
was being taken out to his lunch by his banker, ''aye and you get a
right good feed.''
Hamish was contracted to stack the big round bales in our Dutch barn.
I have a digger of my own, of course, but it can only reach high enough
to put three up. Even finishing with a triangle of three only gives me
nine bales per stow whereas with Hamish's supercharged digger we could
look for five high or 15 to the stow.
Even with the price of straw these days I would have been unhappy
about employing a contractor to do such a job had that contractor not
been Hamish. For he is just the best digger driver there is. So much so
that we persuaded him to come and make an attempt at the world record
for stacking 600 bales.
He accepted the challenge and while Potions and I hauled the bales in
about he threw them up. I have never seen anything like it. He has full
torque on his digger and an extra spool valve which means he can turn
the bales sideways. When he went from reverse to forward his front
wheels came anything up to 18 inches off the ground.
Anyway, he did it in four hours, which works out at about six pence a
bale.
It can't be bad but Hamish showed he has all his back teeth when he
declined my invitation to cheat slightly and call it three hours which
would surely give him a record which will never be bettered.
Anyway, Hamish will need a long spoon on Friday.
I tried to tell him that as soon as the bankers get past the Christmas
card stage, they are bad news. If you are summoned to the office ''for a
chat about renewing your facility'' you are fairly safe. All they want
is the #50 they charge for the meeting.
But if they invite you to lunch you are on a different ballpark. It
isn't so bad if you are invited to lunch at Ellon, no-one with the power
to put you out of business works there. Things can be stickier if you're
invited to lunch in Aberdeen. But if your banker invites you to lunch at
the North British in Edinburgh, look out! You can be sure it's you
that's paying.
And why do they use lunch as a stick with which to beat us? Our only
crime is giving them too much business?
Well, the answer is that the bankers are nice feckless people like the
rest of us. They hate being the bearers of bad news. They can't stand to
see grown men cry. If they have to have a client in to tell him he has
another six months to pull his business round, they feel the least they
should get out of it is a good meal. And the banker can't very well eat
while the unfortunate client looks on.
Mind you, how can you enjoy a meal when your heart is in your mouth?
I must admit I never got the call to Edinburgh, but I do know about
the bank lunches in Aberdeen. To me they were a sort of assault course
from which I tried to emerge as a chap the bank couldn't afford to be
without, no matter how unsound his business might be.
And it isn't easy. There's far too much drink for a start. Now, that
wouldn't bother some people but drinking is my hobby and it's hard to
show a modest appetite when the bankers are paying -- or, more to the
point, when you know you are paying and that you haven't chosen the
company.
I used to go armed with two good jokes. I would get them in early and
establish myself as a man of humour. Then I would proceed to flatter my
hosts by laughing at all their witticisms without regard to whether they
were funny or not. That was quite an ordeal especially as I had a thing
called a hiatus hernia. That meant that I sometimes had difficulty in
swallowing. The food would go over my neck but wouldn't enter my
stomach.
This condition which was largely nervous, was made a hundred times
worse when food was taken with anxiety -- and there is nothing more
anxious than lunch with the banker.
So it wasn't long before my neck was full.
The only thing to do was to drink more and hope the liquid would clear
the drain. Course after course would have to be played with rather than
eaten while the effects of alcohol on the nerves and on the choking mass
finally cleared the blockage. It was not pleasant and all the time you
had to laugh heartily at the least pleasantry from the hosts.
''I'm afraid the farmer is drinking more than he's eating these
days,'' I could hear them say.
The bankers never did close me down. I will always remember the
wonderful feeling of relief when an even higher overdraft limit had been
negotiated. ''Yes!'' I would be able to farm for at least another year.
Those were the days when I had credit at the mart for 200 grazing
cattle, a #1000 an acre on overdraft and a queue.
I was telling the lads about it on Sunday at the discussion group when
Penny Washers, the white settler, said: ''Gosh, it would be nice to get
down to that.'' He's bought three farms in Aberdeenshire recently.
I wouldn't be surprised if he was invited to lunch in Edinburgh soon.

IT will come as little surprise to learn that the growth in emoluments
for top directors has outstripped that of average earnings in recent
years, writes NICOLA REEVES.
A median increase of 8.6% giving typical total earnings of #492,000 a
year, was awarded to top directors of Britain's largest FTSE-100
companies in their most recent financial years. This was more than twice
the rate of increase in average earnings over the same period.
This is among the findings of the sixth annual analysis of top
directors' remuneration by the employment consultancy Income Data
Services, IDS.
Its Management Pay Review shows that the base salary and the value of
benefits -- the fixed elements of remuneration -- increased by a median
6.2% to about #390,000. Annual bonuses, paid on top of fixed
remuneration, jumped by a median 20% to #127,000.
As in previous years, most of the large movements in total emoluments
were due to changes in incentive payments.
Increases in total emoluments of more 30% occurred at six companies,
while at a further 14 increases exceeded 20%. Apart from British Gas and
Reuters, where the main influence was a substantial rise in basic
salary, bonuses accounted for the majority of these rises.
For the second year running, despite a decrease in total emoluments,
the Royal Bank of Scotland's highest paid director, Peter Wood, was the
highest paid director in the FTSE-100 firms receiving total emoluments
of #17,402,251 in the year to 30 September 1994.
The largest element was #13m, paid by Direct Line Insurance, as a
buyout in January 1994 of his previous service contract, which entitled
him to a share in the growth of the company. Direct Line also paid a #4m
performance bonus for the period 1 October 1993, to 13 January 1994.
Thorn EMI had the second highest paid director in the survey, with
total emoluments of #6,627,747, received by the head of EMI Music, based
in the US. This included the highest basic salary of #1,923,077, and an
annual bonus worth 100% of salary.
The amount of information on top remuneration in company reports has
increased greatly in recent years, particularly in the case of bonus
payments.

DANNY and I arrived in a similar state of mind: sceptical of Kenny
Rogers's artistic worth. Danny, sitting resignedly with his arms folded
in the front row, had been dragged there by his wife. I'd been impelled
to turn up by professional duty.
By Saturday night's end Danny was #100 and a T-shirt better off,
publicly professing himself Kenny's best fan. My reward was less
concrete but no less real: I'd been convinced that, as well as being
able to spot a good tune, Kenny sure can sing one.
Kenny can also spot a non-believer in his audience, too. For the
tenners all came direct from Kenny's pocket, Kenny deftly flicking them
Danny's way each time he could recognise one of Kenny's syrupy
pop-country hits even if he didn't like any of them. Of course, the rest
of the audience were in Kenny's pocket from the start.
Morbid toe-tappers featuring impotent Viet-vet cripples abandoned by
their cheatin' wives. Mid-paced ditties about philosophisin' card
sharps, moralisin' bar-room harpies, and hurtin' redneck farmers left
alone to tend four hungry children and a crop in the field . . .
country-lurvin' Glasgow digs 'em.
Yet having sung these songs for almost 20 years, Kenny doesn't seem to
share his fans' affection for them. On Saturday he lavished more time
and effort on his jazz-inflected big-band swing explorations of forties
standards.
It was here that Kenny revealed an unexpected willingness to dissect
easy melodies and take a few risks. Aye, yon Kenny Rogers: he's more
than OK. And he didn't have to pay me to say that.

IT'S an odd thing hearing reviews read out in a theatre. Sure, when a
review is good they'll pin it up in the foyer and when it's bad they'll
misquote it in their adverts, but that's as close as the critic's work
ever gets to the sanctuary of the stage itself.
So to see Dame Diana Rigg build an hour-long show out of devastating
put downs, stinging one liners and witty send-ups, is akin to a priest
telling dirty jokes from the pulpit. For one of her profession it's as
sacrilegious as referring to Shakespeare's Scottish play by name and
defiantly repeating it for the rest of the evening. After all, there are
many actors who won't even read reviews, never mind perform them.
Rigg breaks a great theatrical taboo by publicly recognising that the
reprobate business of reviewing is, like it or not, an integral part of
the theatre machine. And that being the case, what better way of
belittling the critic's earnest efforts than laughing along with them?
We're still here, we actors, no matter what spiteful things have been
written about us, is the subtext of Rigg's performance, as she quotes
some of the worst notices received by her great -- ''and secure'' --
friends in showbusiness.
So dare I criticise this benefit evening to launch the MacRobert's
autumn season? Dare I suggest that in her attempt to cover the history
of theatre abuse from 560BC right the way through to Jimmy Chisholm in
Dumbstruck! (they wrote ''appalling'', they meant ''appealing''), Rigg
delivered a little too much of the theory and not quite enough of the
practice? Of course not. That would be playing straight into her hands.

Music
WELL, the old team did it again. In a Prom at the Albert Hall last
night, before a capacity audience and a Prom arena packed to the edges,
Neeme Jarvi and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra proved that the
chemistry which made them unique in the eighties still works. And the
crowd knew it, baying for more (which they got).
It must be nearly a decade since Estonian conductor Jarvi and the
Royal SNO carved themselves a unique sound with the music of Prokofiev
-- lean strings, sexy woodwinds, fat, beefy, bronzed brass, and a
distinctive, rich and glittering quality. It was enshrined in a whole
series of discs. And it was theirs.
In their second-half performance of extracts from Prokofiev's Romeo
and Juliet last night they recreated it in a series of magnificent
performances which tore the Albert Hall crowd apart -- though it was all
topped by a typical and torrentially virtuosic performance of the Death
of Tybalt from the same score.
As usual, the band played out of their skins for Jarvi. These days
they have other excellent conductors. Jarvi always brought out of them
an inimitable incandescence. He still does. Mean, moody and
magnificent; wha's like them?
Earlier, Jarvi had -- predictably -- run the gamut from elegance to
eccentricity in a performance of Carl Nielsen's Third Symphony that
brought out of the music perhaps rather more than is in it, while, with
Russian cellist Natalia Gutman, Elgar's Cello Concerto had tons of
intensity and soul, though it lacked its characteristic breadth; very
East European in colour.

Music
ON the Scottish music scene, you can almost feel the orchestral
autumn/winter seasons revving up at the starting post. The BBC SSO was
first out of the blocks at the weekend, opening new concert seasons in
Inverness and Stirling.
At the MacRobert Centre on Saturday night the SSO was flying, in
splendid form in a programme of big Romantic warhorses under the
direction of French conductor Jean Yves Ossonce. This man, in his
mid-thirties, is a real find -- he conducted the SSO in a Chabrier opera
at the 1994 Edinburgh Festival. It's tempting to suggest, from his work
on Saturday, and particularly from the response of the orchestra, that
Ossonce is a natural.
It's not just that he is extremely confident, stylish and polished --
though he is all of these, as the long-breathed, spacious, and secure
openings to both Wagner's Tannhauser Overture and Cesar Franck's
Symphony in D minor demonstrated. He has a natural and unforced
flexibility, exactly catching the ebb and flow of the music -- both in
the boiling emotional temperature of the Tannhauser Venusberg music and
in the dark, turbulent, surging and swaying of the Franck Symphony --
the latter played with real weight and rhythmic bite by the SSO.
Centrepiece of the concert was a dazzling performance of Liszt's
Second Piano Concerto, with Boris Berezovsky, a pianist of immense power
and restraint, as soloist. Berezovsky's Liszt played down the rhetoric
and gave more to the poetry of the piece, though when the big Russian
did unleash his power, he had a touch like steel. Splendid concert.

CORIOLANUS, commonly regarded as the most political play in the
Shakespeare canon (though for my money, Julius Caesar runs it a very
close second) is the play about dictatorship versus democracy.
Here is all the drama of great but flawed leadership versus the common
but fickle people -- arguments of great state and governance pitted
against personal peccadillo and the interventions of human emotion.
David Thacker's blood-red, Napoleonic set production however makes
this less a political drama -- though the battles are exciting enough in
themselves -- than an intensely personal portrait of one, firey, proudly
intractable, individual.
Toby Stephens -- son of Robert Stephens and Maggie Smith -- much
touted after his performance in Stratford last year, again repeats the
role and it's not hard to see why such glowing claims are being made for
him.
He holds the stage as if born to it. Audiences already love him. And
although he swallows words for dinner, he has the sudden, wrenching
fullness of emotion that can make lines like: ''There is a world
elsewhere'', or, ''Mother, what have you done'', cut swathes through the
heart.
Yet there is a crucial dimension missing. For all the physical thrill
of his Coriolanus -- a young, emotionally overwrought war machine, all
supercilious swagger with a public schoolboy's nasal contempt for the
lower orders who can't wait for the next battle but still tied by
subtle, tight, strings to his mother, Caroline Blakiston's cool, ironic
and aristocratic Volumnia -- the central, political dilemmas seem
reduced, almost insignificant.
Philip Voss's wonderfully meddling, busy camp-follower almost steals
the show away as the older statesman Menenius while Barry Lynch is a
slightly understated if still menacing homoerotic mirror-image of
Coriolanus's arch enemy and Volscian conterpart, Aufidius.

''WHERE was I all those years I was away?'' asks Alex Jennings's
wearied, bedraggled Peer Gynt of the woman he abandoned in wanderlust.
''You were in my faith, my hope, and in my love,'' answers Haydn
Gwynne's preposterously patient but noble Solveig.
It gets you every time -- one of the most poignant of replies in all
classical drama, though taking an uncommonly long time to get there.
After a lifetime of searching for who he really is -- he would have
fitted well into the 1960s hippy culture -- Peer's discovery of the
meaning of life turns out to be something much less complex than
philosophy or money. It comes in the simplicity of being, raising a
family, or as Voltaire puts it, ''cultivating your own garden''.
For Ibsen, that tension between doing in the external world and the
drives of the inner life were a constant torment, nowhere more
theatrically expressed than in his long and winding tale of Peer Gynt --
three and a quarter hours in this John Barton-adapted version from a
Christopher Fry translation -- which ends where it started.
Barton's crisp, unadorned story-telling style, much admired at its
opening last year in Stratford, is a slow beginner, lacking variety and
magic in its initial stages. But it comes gloriously into its own in the
second half where, in Barton's hands, the normally heavy-handed series
of travel tableaux acquire pace and eloquence and Peer's white
imperialist, colonialist tendencies are exposed with unusual force.
Jennings, too, is commanding -- a wild, unruly Irish brogued youth,
ruthless in his personal quest, deepening into tragic self-knowledge by
the end. Like life, a journey of mixed but finally, triumphant
blessings.

VISUAL ARTS
Clare Henry examines the Italian and Russian influences on the work of
printmaker Stuart Duffin
THE year 1984 was a watershed for Stuart Duffin. He became etching
technician at Glasgow Print Studio and took his first trip abroad, to
Tuscany. Long enthralled by early Christian art and architecture, Italy
strengthened his imagery with madonnas, saints, shrines, candles,
campaniles, and churches. GPS exposed him to working with Scotland's
best artists. He's not looked back, and is now well known for his
prowess in the field of etching.
The Italian trip bowled him over. ''It had such an impact on my
philosophies and attitude to art, that I felt I almost grew up
overnight!'' Echos of Byzantium and the Renaissance are central to his
work. Masaccio's Trinity fresco with its intimations of mortality proved
to be the single most important spur. ''Its poignancy and absolute
truthfulness laid the foundations for all I've achieved since.''
As to the Print Studio, ''I showed my face once too often and was
given a set of keys and a job!'' he says modestly.
In fact for the past 11 years Duffin has been a mainstay of GPS,
editioning for superstars like Paolizzi, Howson, Ken Currie,
Wiszniewski, Dhruva Mistry, Gonzalez from Spain, and Elizabeth
Blackadder, who wrote his catalogue introduction. But he also does his
own work, writes music, and plays in a band. (His record, Moor Fire
Burn, is released later this month.) With two small children as well,
how does he manage? ''I have a very supportive wife!''
Duffin sees the demands of editioning for others as a plus,
''Definitely. I get the best of both worlds. I enjoy the technical side,
and the artists are great to work with. Ken is very open-minded but can
be a nightmare! He's an enthusiast, so leaps straight in with the copper
and acid. But his rich velvety prints have influenced the way I look at
things and, with hindsight, I see connections with my mezzotints.
Elizabeth's ability to compose almost effortlessly has also influenced
the way I see and think.''
Siena and Pisa continue to inspire but in 1992 he was captivated by
another, more unlikely place: Senej, 50 kilometres from Moscow. He
planned to compare Russia's orthodox icon tradition with Italy. In the
end it was the landscape around Senej's printwork shop that fed into his
work.
''When we arrived everything was covered in snow. Till it melted all
we saw was silver birches. My bedroom window looked on to the frozen
lake and forest,'' a view used in his strong self-portrait drawing,
Crows in Snowstorm Chaos. Hooded crows are everywhere, their black wings
and tiny bony sculls imbuing paintings and prints with a mysterious air
of ominous melancholy. The Bosnian war started during Duffin's
three-month stay in Senej and this tragedy also informs his work, as
does his childhood passion for birds' eggs, natural history, Victorian
display cases, museums -- and music.
''I was brought up a Christian in an artistic family. We were
encouraged with music lessons (Duffin's brother Graeme, is part of Wet,
Wet, Wet), and I've always listened to chamber music, sacred music, and
jazz. I use text a lot in my prints. It's important from an aesthetic
point of view and I hope it entices people to study my pictures.
Sometimes it's from psalms, or Renaissance inscriptions. Sometimes it's
words from a song I'm writing. I try to make people think.''
Here is the crux. Some artists go for colour, drama and movement;
others for romance, elegance or novelty. All are valid. But quiet,
questioning voices have their place too. Duffin is by nature sincere,
honest, kind, and thoughtful and he holds deeply felt convictions. In
Russia he experienced the bewildering switch from communism to
consumerism and its misguided craving for superficial Western values and
material possessions. It was a legacy he describes as ''the colour of
ashes''.
His intense, personal reaction reached its emotional apogee at Easter,
''the first to be allowed in Russia in over 70 years''. By coincidence
he was drawing birch trees (in groups of three) on top of a hill
(characteristic of his Italian compositions) with a skull (laid bare by
the melted snow) at its foot. ''On the day I made the drawing and sat
back to look at it later in the evening, the realisation that it was
also Good Friday was enough to bring me to my knees.''
New work, premiered at the GPS Gallery in King Street, till September
30, features a rich vocabulary of seemingly innocent objects culled from
both Russia and Italy, and interwoven with new significance. Happily,
his work is never bombastic or didactic. He leaves viewers to extract
their own interpretation.
Duffin's virtuoso technical expertise, so useful to GPS clients, was
also changed by Senej. ''They only had hard rollers but I began to like
the textures they made.'' Etching involves a complex process of incised
lines made by acid. Recently he's taken to using the backs of old
etching plates, which are full of incidental marks and what's called
''foul biting''.
''I print this and try to see a composition within it.'' Duffin then
adds an exciting mix of drypoint or mezzotint work to the plate. ''A
piece of steel or copper can be etched, scraped, scored, hammered,
drilled, dented, and distressed in various ways, ground down, burnished
and polished to yield a remarkable array of tones and textures. This for
me lies at the heart of intaglio printmaking.''
Duffin also combines photoetching with detailed drawing, the
cornerstone of his art and essential for the difficult, meticulous
mezzzotint which he learnt from the Russian expert, Constantin Chmutin
who he met in Russia and who has since spent time at GPS. ''The bigger
the Russian, the finer the drawing.''
Now 36, this Aberdeen graduate says, ''I may not be composing or
playing my guitar at 80 but I could never stop making art.'' See his
evocative, gently haunting images, (reasonably priced from #98-#198) and
you can see why.
* Duffin will talk about his work at GPS on Wednesday, September 20 at
7pm. All welcome. Admission free. On October 15 his band, The Moors, are
involved in Solitary Citizen, a multi-media performance with the
Scottish Chamber Quartet at Cottiers Theatre, Glasgow.

Theatre,
IT'S nice to be reminded that theatre can just be fun. Take a simple,
uncomplicated plot, economically executed and clearly told, dig out your
tap shoes and rustle up a few good tunes, and go ahead and enjoy
yourselves.
There's nothing more -- or less -- ambitious about Richard Baron's
production of Sandy Wilson's feelgood musical, and neither does there
need to be. Apart from the shrill line of precocious and giggly students
at a fancy French finishing school, there isn't even much of an attempt
to keep with the idea that the show is a parody of the musicals of the
1920s. Baron just gives it to us straight -- brief scenes, too short to
let us see whether the dancers can act or not, getting quickly to the
point, then stepping aside for another number. Cue applause, cue
reprise.
One of the refreshing and all too rare aspects of seeing musicals
produced under these conditions is how direct and unsynthetic it feels.
Compared to the big budget, slick, over-amplified West End productions,
it's far more to do with the joy of a good song (and The Boyfriend has a
couple of great ones) and the love of a lightfooted dance than with star
names and hi-tech effects. That said, Perth has managed to get together
an uncommonly big company -- 16 of them plus twin-piano accompaniment by
John Scrimger and Ian Strachan -- with lively choreography by Rita
Henderson and witty designs by Nigel Hook.
Some of the older performers are a little stiff and some of the cod
French accents start to grate, but when the balloons tumble down into
the auditorium for the finale you know that everyone's enjoyed the
party.

Music
EVEN allowing for the four empty seats next to me, Simple Minds at the
concert hall felt distinctly claustrophobic. For a band whose previous
Glasgow shows were at the SECC and Ibrox Stadium, being within a stone's
throw of Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill and being able to see their faces
without the aid of a giant TV screen, seemed somehow wrong.
The predictable and cliched parts of the show were all present and
correct: by the end of the first chorus we were invited to put our hands
in the air, by the second (Up On The Catwalk) Kerr was writhing on his
back, and midway through the third (See The Lights) Burchill got his
extended guitar solo. Kerr proclaimed his undying love for his home town
in what sounded like a broad Irish accent.
Putting a band like Simple Minds, hardly renowned for their subtlety,
in a venue known for its acoustic perfection was surely superfluous.
Even allowing for an admirable trimming of the musical girth surrounding
them, the concert hall did little for Simple Minds or vice-versa.
Their set at least played to their strengths, a greatest hits
run-through which by and large ignored the excess baggage of their last
three albums. Alive and Kicking and Waterfront are at least
well-constructed stadium anthems, while Love Song and The American
flashed back to a more intriguing past.
On the contrary, the authors of the beautiful traditional ballad
around which Belfast Child is constructed should sue for criminal
damages: Kerr as a social commentator cuts no ice, that its intro is the
only reprieve from the pounding bass and drums was no consolation.
This was the stuff of consolidation and reaffirmation for the loyal
and still sizable hardcore of Simple Minds' once huge following. To the
rest of us it looked and sounded like a band revisiting a more glorious
past to compensate for its current mediocrity.

''DON'T tremble at Trimble'' was the headline over an editorial in the
Sunday Tribune which sums up the nervous reaction in the Irish Republic
to David Trimble's unexpected election as leader of the Ulster Unionist
Party.
When news reached Dublin late on Friday evening of the hard line
Trimble's decisive victory over the centrist John Taylor, there was a
totally negative response in private from dismayed Government Ministers
and from prominent front benchers in the republican Fianna Fail Party.
Recall was made of how during the Gulf war Trimble compared the Irish
Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland with Saddam Hussein's
claim to jurisdiction over Kuwait. There were also references to how
Trimble, on the eve of the Downing Street Declaration, accused the
former Irish Premier Albert Reynolds of negotiating for the IRA and of
offering Ulster Unionists ''surrender by stages''.
Trimble's runaway victory was seen by the Dublin political
establishment as having been secured on the strength of his appeal to
the Orange Order. It was also judged as proof of a hardening of Unionist
resistance to talks with Sinn Fein.
It was the nightmare scenario which Dublin most feared but had
discounted as most unlikely. Coming at the end of a week in which
Taoiseach (Prime Minister) John Bruton had called off the Chequers
summit with John Major because of Sinn Fein pressure, Trimble's triumph
was regarded as a further setback to the fragile peace process.
However, diplomatic courtesy overcame these private reservations, as
Bruton welcomed the outcome and spoke of his hopes for an early meeting
with the new Unionist leader. Foreign Minister Dick Spring, warmly
congratulating Trimble, pointed out that the full involvement of the
Ulster Unionist Party, as the largest party in Northern Ireland, is
essential in working for a stable and comprehensive settlement.
On Saturday public sympathy in the south shifted somewhat in Trimble's
favour. In interviews on Irish national radio the mid-Ulster MP played
down his demonised image as an Orange bigot by correctly pointing out
that the media had got the election so badly wrong that they were not
necessarily objective in their profiles of him.
Trimble won further goodwill by his willingness to meet Bruton and
other constitutional nationalist leaders in the near future.
However, a careful analysis of Trimble's weekend comments shows that
he has closed off prospects of an early political rapprochement with the
republic and Sinn Fein. He did not pull his punches when he claimed that
the Chequers Summit was postponed because of the Irish Government's fear
of Sinn Fein.
On this point, Trimble appears to be on solid ground. It has now been
disclosed that two senior Irish civil servants were told 10 days ago by
the Sinn Fein leadership in Belfast that there would be ''bodies on the
streets'' if a proposed international commission on the decommissioning
of IRA arms and explosives had gone ahead.
But in a desperate effort to restore his Government's credibility in
the eyes of the British Government and the Ulster Unionists, Bruton has
promised that he will do a deal on arms decommissioning with Major even
without Sinn Fein support.
Dublin Ministers realise that Trimble will be unyielding in his
defence of the Union, and that he will reject the so-called Irish
dimension in the governance of Northern Ireland until the republic
removes its territorial claims over the north. Dublin will never again
underrate Trimble.

IN the betting shops of Belfast, the odds were so short on John Taylor
becoming the next Unionist leader, that no more wagers were accepted.
Outside the Ulster Hall on Friday evening, the political
correspondents had their profiles of Taylor prepared as he and the four
other contenders for the leadership arrived along with the 806 voting
delegates of the party.
The great wooden doors of the hall were closed to observers while the
grassroots of Northern Ireland's largest political party listened inside
to brief speeches from each contender, and then made their choice by
secret ballot.
By 9.30pm the first sign of the shock to come was evident. Party
secretary Jim Wilson emerged from the hall to reveal that not Taylor but
the youngest and least experienced of the five had a commanding lead on
the first count. William David Trimble, a 50-year-old father of four,
who had initially said he was not a runner and only declared his hand a
week before the contest, was about to become one of the most influential
political leaders in Ireland, and a force to be reckoned with at
Westminster, too.
His comparative inexperience -- he became an MP less than five years
ago -- seemed to rule him out of the race, as did the fact that he was
written off as too young for a party whose previous leader had retired
at 75.
Perhaps the media pundits and the bookies had been carried away by the
changing face of Ulster in its year of peace and promise. Perhaps the
wishful thinking of commentators, looking for a new political visionary,
a de Klerk of Unionism, was at fault. But whatever the reason, David
Trimble's success suggests the mood of Protestants in Northern Ireland
was badly misread in advance of Friday night's vote.
The candidates like Ken Maginnis and, to some extent, John Taylor, who
were seen as potential mould-breakers, were swept aside in favour of a
resolute and fairly uncompromising Unionist figurehead who is expected
to be a tough political adversary in the face of Irish nationalism.
''I'll not be pushed around,'' was the early message from Trimble at
the weekend and it is what the Unionist grassroots wanted to hear to
counter what they regard as undue pressure from London and Dublin for a
new political settlement, involving all of Ireland's parties, including
Sinn Fein.
In David Trimble, a civil servant's son, they believe they have their
man. Little or nothing in his political baggage suggests a new and
radical approach to the future, even if he was at pains after his
election to describe himself as a ''moderniser'' rather than the
hard-liner some observers have labelled him.
He laid the foundations for his rise to influence in the mid-1970s as
a member of Ulster Vanguard, a breakaway faction of the Unionist Party,
which helped orchestrate the Protestant Workers' Strike of 1974. Trimble
became a close ally of William Craig, who had been a high-ranking
minister in the old Northern Ireland government at Stormont and adopted
a tough militant stance against Westminster intervention in the
province.
In 1968, when Trimble was just starting on his career as a lecturer in
law at Queen's University, Craig was the Home Affairs Minister who
banned Catholic civil rights marches and became at that time one of the
most disliked Unionist figures in the minds of the nationalist
community.
Opposed to what he saw as a vacillating Unionist leadership at the
time, Craig went his own way at the helm of Vanguard, which eventually
attracted Trimble to its ranks. By 1975, Trimble was an elected member
of the then Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention, just one of the
many British initiatives over the past 20 years which have failed to
find a formula for lasting stability. He became Craig's deputy but the
Vanguard movement fizzled out after the hard-line image of its leader
was dented by his proposal for a ''voluntary coalition'' with the
nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party.
Trimble now turned his energies towards the Ulster Unionists,
attracted by the new leadership in 1979 of James Molyneaux. He became
one of Molyneaux's backroom strategists, his analytical, academic
background seen as a valued asset.
In the 1980s, Trimble combined his lecturing job at Queen's University
with an increasingly influential role within the Unionist Party. He
experienced the horror of terrorism first hand when one of his closest
colleagues, Edgar Graham, another law academic and a leading Unionist,
was shot dead by the IRA in the university area. Had Graham lived, he
would almost certainly have been a contender for the leadership which
Trimble has now captured.
Trimble failed to win his party's nomination for the 1989 European
election but, the following year, he became MP for Upper Bann, upon the
premature death from cancer of the sitting member, Harold McCusker. In
the period since, his stature within the party has gained through an
ability shared by very few of his eight parliamentary colleagues to
perform confidently on television and in the House of Commons.
Ironically, he shared an office at Westminster with John Taylor, the
odds-on favourite to succeed James Molyneaux. Until a week before the
selection meeting it was thought the two men had come to an
understanding whereby Trimble would support Taylor and, as the younger
of the two, await another day to seek the leadership.
However, with only seven days left, Trimble, spurred on by favourable
comment about him in some newspapers and by a strong showing in opinion
polls, announced he was a contender. Despite the focus of attention on
others such as Taylor, he was quietly confident he could win.
In the end he had what it took for a party frustrated by the low
profile of its previous leader, a sense that it was losing the
propaganda war to the nationalists and failing to stop moves towards
more involvement of Dublin in Northern Ireland. Grassroots Unionists
wanted someone who could stand up to Sinn Fein, to the impressive SDLP
leader John Hume, and to the constant pressures from the British and
Irish governments for a new political settlement. Enough is enough, they
were saying. Trimble, with his speech to delegates last Friday and in
his actions during the summer, presented the image they wanted.
Significantly, he had been photographed earlier on Friday in the
company of Ian Paisley, as both men received a special Orange Order
medal struck to mark the so-called ''Siege of Drumcree'' in July.
Defiantly, Trimble and Paisley stood side by side when a major
confrontation developed between thousands of Orangemen and police, over
the re-routing of a parade at Drumcree. There were violent clashes
between protesters and the police and Trimble proclaimed at one point:
''Orangemen have marched along this road for 188 years so abandoning it
is not something that is going to be done lightly. We are not going back
the way we came.''
That episode, perhaps more than any other, singled out David Trimble
for the leadership he now holds, even if it also caused deep resentment
and anger among moderate Protestants and Catholic nationalists. A member
of the Orange Order and of the Apprentice Boys of Derry, Trimble's
Protestant credentials are a comfort factor to traditional Unionists and
a matter of concern for others, who hope for a new pluralist approach to
Ulster politics.
Some Unionists have been pressing for an end to the Orange Order's
formal link with the Unionist Party, arguing that it dissuades Catholics
who support the Union from joining. Despite his own Orange links,
Trimble is likely to support such a change, if cautiously. He once said:
''Unionism is not a narrow, insular creed but recognises the many ties,
economic, social, and cultural, which bind us in the greater part of the
British Isles together in a genuinely pluralist and tolerant state in
which it is possible to be Irish and British, or Ulster and British.''
He takes over at a time when the peace process in Ulster is stumbling
from one crisis to another but the fact that the Unionist Party chose
him is a clear sign of a hardening mood within the party. Peace there is
in Northern Ireland but Unionists are saying not at any price. In
William David Trimble, they believe they have found a rock that will not
easily crack.

THE Government's proposed Job Seekers' Allowance was criticised
yesterday by Labour's Scottish training spokesman, Mr John McFall.
The Dumbarton MP said that the legislation, currently going through
Parliament, was part of the campaign to reduce the welfare budget.
He said the plans to reduce the number of hours that unemployed people
can study while claiming benefit from 21 hours a week to 16 would hinder
the unemployed from helping themselves.
''This is part of the Conservatives' current strategy to cut benefits
and welfare costs,'' said Mr McFall. ''It is sad, but not surprising,
that their contribution to the 1996 European Year of Lifelong Learning
is to place restrictions on the ability of the unemployed to help
themselves by improving their qualifications and skills.
''Participation in part-time education and training should be regarded
as a positive thing and encouraged by the Government.''

ONE of Scotland's smallest education authorities faces a bill of more
than #100,000 in the first year if all eligible teachers press on and
win equal pay.
Already the regional council in Dumfries and Galloway has received
word from the Industrial Tribunal that five claims have been submitted
by teaching staff employed in the region.
Councils throughout Scotland are bracing themselves for equal pay
claims following the success of a claim by nine female teachers in a
test case against Strathclyde Regional Council.
The Strathclyde teachers were all unpromoted or assistant principal
teachers who claimed the work they did was the same as, or of equal
value to, that done by their male counterparts, all of whom were
principal teachers.
Since then, teachers' organisations have invited teachers throughout
Scotland to pursue similar claims through industrial tribunals.
Dumfries education director Kenneth Macleod said: ''It is understood
that significant numbers of claims against other authorities have also
been submitted.
''We are facing #104,000 in a full year if all the unpromoted, senior
and assistant principal teachers were to become principal teachers.''
The claims could go back five years and the possible cost to the
authority was being investigated, he said.
The organisational structures within schools may have to be examined
to minimise the financial consequences for councils, he said.
''The potential knock-on effect of these cases for the education
services as a whole is considerable,'' Mr Macleod said.
''It is therefore imperative that these and any other subsequent
applications are vigorously resisted.''

DEMANDS for an inquiry into prison staffing levels were made yesterday
as two escapees from Friarton prison in Perth remained at large.
The SNP MP for Perth and Kinross, Ms Roseanna Cunningham, made the
call following the jail break on Saturday morning by three men, one a
convicted rapist.
The rapist was recaptured in Glasgow on Saturday night and was back
behind bars less than 24 hours after his escape. The other two were
still at large last night.
Yesterday Ms Cunningham claimed only two officers were responsible for
more than 70 prisoners on the night of the break-out.
Ms Cunningham said she had been told the staffing ratio was in
accordance with prison rules.
''This event -- which leads to the escape of a convicted rapist --
must surely raise questions about staffing levels in prisons,'' she
said.
Ms Cunningham said she would contact the Scottish Office, asking them
to reconsider regulations for staffing levels in light of the incident.
Staff at the prison found the trio missing from their cells early on
Saturday morning. They are thought to have climbed through their cell
windows and scaled a perimeter fence.
The returned prisoner was serving a sentence of five years and three
months for rape, attempted rape, and breach of bail. He is expected to
appear in court tomorrow.
Police across Scotland are still hunting prisoners Ronald Stewart and
John Byrne, both from Glasgow.
Stewart, 33, is serving a six-year term, imposed at the High Court in
Glasgow in December 1992 for theft, assault, and attempting to defeat
the interests of justice.
Byrne, 26, is only a few months into a 21-month sentence imposed at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court in July for theft, assault and robbery and a
traffic offence.
A spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service said: ''None of the men's
recent behaviour while in prison suggests they would present a danger to
the public, but each has been convicted of a crime of violence. Police
have been informed and are investigating.''
An urgent report would be compiled on the circumstances of the escape
and a review of security was likely.
A report by the Chief Inspector of Prisons earlier this year expressed
concern about overcrowding at medium-security Friarton, which houses
Category C and D prisoners.
The report said more than 70 men were housed in a complex designed for
56, in single cell and dormitory accommodation.

Theatre
WHEN the new generation of angry young playwrights came to prominence
in the 1950s, it was the likes of Terence Rattigan that they swept away.
Even now the belief persists that British theatre in the years prior to
1956 just doesn't count.
And I have to say that not only was While The Sun Shines written to
take audiences' minds off the horrors of wartime (in other words its
very aspiration was to be lightweight), but also its setting is the
central London chambers of one of the wealthiest men in the country.
Thus, at the time of the biggest social shift towards democracy the
country had ever known, Rattigan still seemed to think it was the toffs
who made the best dramatic material (albeit with a passing and
unconvinced nod to the arrival of socialism).
But so what? Revolutionary it ain't, funny it is. While The Sun Shines
is a drawing room romance with a rude farce bursting to get out that
takes advantage of the wartime practice of sharing houses, even beds,
with complete strangers to generate a hilarious and surprisingly
sexually licentious comedy of confusion.
Director Joan Knight has assembled a buoyant young cast who perhaps
don't get the upper class setting spot on, but do manage exceedingly
well at the deadpan cool and detached resignation of a group of people
for whom life is a continual stream of unexpected events. Strong
performances from a foppish Philip Pickard, a dizzy Jane Reilly, an
American Gregor Powrie, and a very physical and French Kevin Felbie,
help build a production that avoids the nostalgia trap yet still has
enough emotional heart to produce a touching and satisfying happy
ending.

WELLINGTON: At least 12 people, including several children, were
feared killed after a mobile home plunged from a bridge into the icy
Mohaka River on New Zealand's North Island last night. Rescuers
recovered two bodies after a four-hour operation to secure the vehicle
with wire cables, and divers were expected to recover the other victims
today.

Washington
IRAQI President Saddam Hussein's defector son-in-law said the
opposition within Iraq was ready to overthrow his regime.
His claim came on the day that Iraq's National Assembly unanimously
approved Saddam as the sole candidate in a presidential election.
Lieutenant General Hussein Kamel Hassan, who fled Bagdad on August 8
with his brother and their wives -- both daughters of Saddam -- told
Time magazine: ''Everybody is now ready (to depose Saddam). But there
are things that must be done before the first spark is ignited.''
He added: ''The catalyst will be for the people to join the army in
taking the initiative.
''The Iraqi opposition is now in place to overthrow the regime. I am
talking now about the opposition inside the country. I know everything
about it, all the details -- Iraqi army officers, government officials,
university professors, and all the graduates, and also the Iraqi
citizenry.''
Kamel Hassan, in what Time said was his first important interview with
the Western media, said he decided to flee Iraq because he could not
change ''erroneous policies'' and there were ''too many executions in
our society, too many arrests''.
Asked what he would like to see for Iraq's future, Kamel Hassan
replied: ''Iraq should be a stable, secure country, able to interact
with the Arab countries and the West.
''Iraq should avoid wars. There should be pluralism and political
parties. We should put an end to these shameful executions,'' he said.
Asked why Iraq did not use its chemical and biological weapons during
the Gulf war, he said: ''How can you use them while you are fighting the
whole planet? Any mistake of using these unconventional weapons will
make the major powers use nuclear weapons, which means Iraq will be
exterminated.''
He said it would take the United Nations a long time to analyse new
information provided by Iraq on its nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapons programmes.
In Baghdad today, meanwhile, Iraq's National Assembly unanimously
approved Saddam as the sole candidate to stand in a presidential
election to be held within the next two months.
The ruling Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) nominated Saddam on
Thursday when it approved amendments to Iraq's interim constitution,
among them a provision to elect the president through secret ballot for
a seven-year term.
The RCC asked the Assembly to meet in an emergency session to endorse
Saddam's nomination and today the 250 Assembly members all raised their
hands when the Speaker asked them to give their opinion.
The referendum to endorse Saddam as president will be the first such
vote in Iraq since it became a republic after the 1958 revolution which
toppled the monarchy.
Iraqi officials said the referendum would renew allegiance to Saddam
and lend ''constitutional legitimacy'' to his leadership.--Reuter.

FRANCE stood virtually alone today as nearly all of its European Union
partners expressed controlled anger at the country's renewed nuclear
testing programme in the South Pacific.
''Thirteen out of the 15 countries expressed their regrets at the
first nuclear test in the Pacific and asked for restraint in continuing
the tests,'' Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos told reporters
after a two-day EU meeting.
He said that only Britain refrained from any criticism, although the
tone from Germany was muted.
About 200 demonstrators outside the meeting vented their anger at the
tests, although their targets appeared to include all EU nations, not
just France.
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said he and his counterparts from
Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Finland, Greece,
and Sweden all expressed strong criticism of the tests.
He added, however, that the tone of the meeting was far calmer than
the irate exchanges yesterday, when French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette accused those EU states which objected to the tests of being
bad Europeans for breaking ranks.
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, who led the barrage of
objections today, said the points had been firmly but calmly made on
both sides, and that he hoped that each now understood their neighbours'
positions.
''It is important to stress to French decision-makers that this will
create increasing difficulties in Europe if the testing continues,'' he
added.
He said many of the ministers called on France to cease testing
immediately, but de Charette insisted that the tests would continue
until France had gathered all the data it wanted.
European Commission President Jacques Santer urged France to refrain
from tests until information on their safety had been provided and
assessed.
De Charette agreed to allow an EU monitoring mission into the area
''as quickly as possible'' although he gave no dates and did not say
whether it would be before the second test.
De Charette told reporters he had repeated the French offer to extend
the nuclear defence umbrella to his EU neighbours, but his fellow
ministers denied hearing him make the offer.
''I was quite surprised it did not come up,'' Luxembourg's Poos said.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed the special relationship
between France and Germany and the importance of EU solidarity, but said
even that should not prevent anyone from airing their views.
''We have to clearly state our opinions, but it makes no sense to put
France in the dock,'' Kinkel told reporters.
In another development today, the French military seized a protest
yacht carrying eight MPs from Europe, Australia, and Japan after it
violated an exclusion zone around the Mururoa Atoll nuclear test site in
the South Pacific.--Reuter.

Hollywood hairstyles have influenced fans for decades but, as KENNEDY
WILSON finds, it was often aesthetics and not historical accuracy which
inspired the looks
WITH recent talk of Winona Ryder taking the role of fifties French
film star Jean Seberg in a forthcoming biopic, it's timely to look at
how the cinema has influenced hairstyles. Seberg was famed for her
boyish crop which influenced a generation of suburban wannabe beatniks.
Over the years a host of other stars have influenced coiffure -- think
of blonde bombshells from Harlow to Madonna.
So important did director Roman Polanski think Mia Farrow's Vidal
Sassoon trim in the sixties shocker Rosemary's Baby that he flew Sassoon
in specially and made a photo opportunity out of the event.
The scene when a star is shorn is almost as big a cinematic cliche as
riding into the sunset or the tearful railway station farewell. Most
recently, Kevin Costner as the maverick marauder in Waterworld punishes
his two female stowaways by bestowing short-back-and-sides with a
machete.
In National Velvet the young Liz Taylor cut her hair so that she could
race with the boys. When Glenda Jackson's character quits her job in
Sunday Bloody Sunday she celebrated with a change of hairstyle. Barbra
Streisand gets snipped in Yentl. In A Dangerous Woman Debra Winger cuts
her hair and smartens up her image in order to win a man and there are
movie makeovers for the two Aussie, ugly duckling heroines in Muriel's
Wedding and Strictly Ballroom, faint echoes of the transformation Bette
Davies undergoes from frumpy spinster to glamour puss in Now Voyager.
Audrey Hepburn, the gamine of them all, was shorn in Roman Holiday
when she tried to disown her title of Princess Diana and become an
ordinary girl. In Funny Face she was a Miss Average that was turned into
a beautiful model with the fashion editor's cry: ''The hair is awful, it
will have to go!''
The importance of a change in hairstyle cannot be underestimated for a
woman. Look at the fuss made over Marcia Clark, the O J Simpson trial
prosecutor, when she arrived in court having her corkscrew perm swapped
for more demure curls.
A couple of years ago redheads were back in vogue thanks to the
movies. Rita Hayworth's role as the goodtime girl Gilda in the film of
the same name first promoted hot-tempered glamorous redheads. Then in
the nineties redheads Thelma and Louise went on red alert and had
everyone reaching for the henna: Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman, Jessica
Lange (in Rob Roy) and Kylie Minogue. It's all a far cry from the
fifties when bubble-cut blondes like Monroe and Mansfield held sway.
Other movie stars became as famed for their hair as their screen
presence: Veronica Lake's trademark was peek-a-boo cascade, and where
would Bardot have been without her ponytail?
The most famous movie hairdo is probably Louise Brook's black bob from
the twenties. Even as an old woman Brooks, who died 10 years ago, held
on to the style. At the height of her fame (thanks to her daring role in
the German expressionist movie Pandora's Box) Brooks's bob was hugely
influential. Even today artistic women with dark hair (like
controversial artist Helen Chadwick) opt for the Brooks look.
Long before Max Factor became a brand of cosmetics the name was
associated with Hollywood wigs. Before he emigrated, he worked as
wigmaster at the Russian Imperial Theatre and he opened his Hollywood
store in 1908. He helped establish the film industry's standard for
lifelike period wigs and boasted that he could create hair pieces with
''a realistic hairline that even the cameras cannot betray''.
As Factor's success grew he formed a vast photo library of hairstyles
from around the world and from different periods in history. Yet, for
all his efforts, it was normally only the character actors in lesser
roles that sported historically authentic hairdos. The big stars
preferred more flattering styles. As adviser on a film about Byzantine
empress Theodora, the historian Sir Steven Runciman wrote in his book A
Traveller's Alphabet that he knew that his job would be ''to insist on
the leading lady having a hairstyle proper to the period; but actresses,
however much they may be ready to wear period costume, cannot bear to
alter their coiffure''.
''Viewers expect heroes to look strong and handsome and heroines
beautiful and glamorous -- in modern ways not historical ones,'' says
Alicia Annas, author of Hollywood and History. ''In most period films
the goal was simply to suggest a period in picturesque style while
carefully preserving the star's modern image. Thus while period films
feature costumes and sets that are authentic, hairstyles and wigs rarely
are. Because studios banked so heavily on the box-office appeal of their
stars, few were willing to jeopardise the star's image and risk the
rejection of fans just for the sake of historical accuracy.''
This helps account for all sorts of anachronistic aberrations like
Tony Curtis's fifties Brilcreemed quiff in the Roman epic Spartacus and
Monroe's curves and curls in Some Like it Hot, set in the 1920s.
Even in modern films there can be some awful hairdo mistakes, captured
forever on celluloid. What may have looked perfectly acceptable in a
brief wardrobe screen test appears hopelessly artificial and misguided
over the period of a two-hour film. One of the most famous examples of a
Hollywood hairdo from hell was Meryl Streep's monstrous fright wig in
Cry in the Dark.
A beauty magazine once awarded Jodie Foster its ''beauty Oscar'' for
''most mis-coifed in a leading role''. The offence was playing a
working-class waitress with a $200 haircut.

Termination of a pregnancy after pre-natal testing reveals a problem
that requires an informed decision by parents alone, as Griselda Gordon
explains
THE debate that has raged over the ethics of pre-natal testing and
diagnosis during the past few months has been largely dominated by the
personal opinions of two fathers of young Down's syndrome children,
Dominic Lawson, a journalist and editor, and Brian Wilson, MP for
Cunninghame North.
I applaud Brian Wilson's most recent piece in The Herald for raising
awareness in our society of the reality of life with a Down's syndrome
child. He paints a refreshingly positive picture. However, I feel
saddened at the implied criticisms he makes about those who choose to go
down a different route.
When I embarked on my first pregnancy seven years ago I agreed to the
alpha-fetoprotein blood test that was offered, more as a way of
reassurance, than from any preconceived notion that I would definitely
end a pregnancy on the basis of certain hypothetical circumstances.
I hoped subconsciously that the baby I was carrying would be without
handicap. When my healthy son was born in a fast and furious manner four
months later, I gave no further thought to the implications of the test
I had undertaken. Instead I found myself launched without paddle into
the unprepared and uncharted territory of motherhood.
When he was barely six months old, the blue line that appeared in the
''window'' of my pregnancy testing kit indicated that another baby was
forming and growing inside me.
Again I had the AFP blood test, and when the result showed a high
reading, I was called in for a detailed ultrasound scan. Each time I
recall that scan I do so with the raw emotion of a recurring nightmare
-- the protracted silence, the palpable tension in the air, the kindly
hand of the assistant clutching my upper arm in reassurance, the
lemon-shaped head of our baby, the breaking of the news that there might
be a problem, and the ensuing numbness.
I was sent for a second opinion to a hospital with ''higher
resolution'' ultrasound equipment and in a dark and dingy curtained-off
corridor outside the scan room I heard the news I had been dreading. Our
baby had the beginnings of hydrocephalus and a major lesion on the back
of his neck. This is known as a neural tube defect, or, more commonly,
spina bifida.
The prognosis was grim. It was possible that our son might not survive
until full term, would almost certainly need major surgical intervention
shortly after birth, and even if he survived through this he was likely
to be severely mentally and physically handicapped. (A post-mortem
examination revealed our baby also had a chromosomal abnormality,
Edward's syndrome, one that can also be identified by a ''Down's test''
-- ie amniocentesis. Unlike Down's syndrome, however, the majority of
children with this condition die within their first year of life.)
My ''hypothetical circumstances'' were now a reality. Because we had
chosen to have the tests, we now had two options: either to continue
with the pregnancy or to end it. The choice was ours alone, not the
doctor's, the hospital's, or society's. And my husband and I were not at
any point subjected to any implicit pressure by any party.
In the end, we made the most heartfelt and painful decision of our
lives and chose not to bring our son into this world. We take full
responsibility for what we did and still believe that the decision was
the right one at the time, based on our circumstances and the
information we had.
As night dawdled its way towards the dawn of our hospital appointment,
when we would cross the Rubicon and begin the process which would end
our baby's life, I was alert and terrified. I spent the time either
retching into the lavatory bowl, or lying on the bed, hands clasped over
my swollen belly, feeling the first flutters of movement from our
19-week baby. He was not some abstract principle we were ''getting shot
of''. He was our child and we loved him.
Our decision was, at one and the same time, selfish, altruistic and
pragmatic. I had to consider my own capabilities as a mother of such a
child, bearing in mind that we already had another small child. We were
new parents. Faced with the certainty of a severely handicapped second
child, not only did I feel emotionally and spiritually inadequate for
coping with such a sacrificial role, but I was also concerned that the
constant and necessary intensive care was bound to have an effect on our
other son.
In the five years since the termination (a long and painful induced
labour which was carried out with sensitivity and dignity by the medical
staff), and now, as a full-time mother of three children, I have
constantly been faced with the consequences of our decision, and its
moral dilemma. I have questioned deeply my faith and my values and have
cried more tears than I would have thought possible. These tears emanate
from feelings of guilt, anger, and loss; the loss of our special,
much-loved and wanted child.
In those early days of grieving, when the pain, emptiness, and
isolation threatened to overwhelm me, I sought the help of a small
voluntary organisation, called CARE, whose compassionate members
supported me through those first desperate months.
Five years on, I am now the organisation's secretary, and have spoken
to many women who have been through the same experience as myself. I
find it personally insulting of Brian Wilson (and others) to suggest
that we are victims of ''insidious counselling'' and part of a hidden
strategy to eradicate Down's syndrome and other handicaps.
Are we all so lemming-like that we leap without question over the
cliff and down the path towards termination, because society or our
doctor presses us to do so? Every family is unique and every
circumstance is different.
Wilson's declaration that the strategy (to eradicate Down's syndrome)
is 90% effective and the fact that only 58 Down's syndrome children were
born in Scotland last year so worried me that I requested some
statistics from the Scottish Office. The figures I received tell a
different story. Not only is there no appreciable decline in the numbers
of Down's syndrome children being born (in Scotland anyway) but the live
births, for the most part, still outnumber the terminations.
Nevertheless, he is right to say that advances with technology will
mean that more accurate, earlier tests will be developed. New screening
programmes introduced in the past four years are detecting more Down's
syndrome babies (because now women of all age groups can have their
''risk'' assessed), and so more women than previously are being
confronted with the dilemma. But the fact that more are being detected
does not prove that more are opting for termination.
There is no evidence to suggest that the ratio (of those who end their
pregnancy to those who carry on) is any different to 10 years ago.
Let us not forget that these tests are optional. CARE believes that
parents should only embark on pre-natal testing when fully informed
about their possible implications.
It is important that parents should feel they are making an ''informed
choice'' based on a ''balanced'' picture. Non-directive counselling is
therefore essential at the time of diagnosis.
However, is a balanced picture altogether achievable? How much
information does one need to make an informed choice? Too much
information is confusing and difficult to assimilate. Biased information
is unethical. Moreover, parents who have had close experience of Down's
syndrome (such as a sibling) will be heavily influenced by that
experience.
Although Brian Wilson professes to be pro-choice, in the light of his
own positive experience, he obviously questions the ethics of testing
for Down's syndrome. If one is against testing for Down's, then one
must, by extension, be against testing for any fetal abnormality.
Abandoning pre-natal screening and diagnosis would effectively deprive
parents of their legal right to choose.
For my part, I have now learned to live with the consequences of our
decision, but I fully appreciate that my family life follows quite a
different road than it would have done, had that choice not been there.

I WAS mildly amused by George Birrell's satirical piece on the SNP
(September 7). However, rather than concentrate his grapeshot on the
''virtual reality'' of the SNP he may care to address the reality that
the United Kingdom has been consistently outperformed by its competitors
for the past 50 years.
Every few years another country which in a previous time would be our
poor relations overtakes us in the economic stakes. The Unionists have
failed miserably and only offer genteel poverty. An acceptance of
second-best is their reality.
In the meantime George Birrell and his Unionist ilk think they are
pouring scorn on the SNP when, in reality they are questioning the
Scottish people's ability to govern themselves.
The SNP does not offer itself as the government of Scotland, but it
alone offers itself as the means by which the people can elect a
Scottish government. That is surely nobler than the parties of the Union
who long for power for themselves.

MICHAEL Fry writes (September 6) concerning a possibly lower tax
regime in Scotland than in England: '' . . . it is the eternal Scottish
dream: screw the English and keep the money . . . Somehow I do not think
it will go down too well south of the Border''.
His first point shows an extraordinary contempt for his fellow Scots
and perhaps says more about the Thatcherite approach to the public purse
than that of most people in Scotland. It is the sort of attitude which
has seen his party decline so markedly in popularity north of the
Border.
As to his second point: what will the English think about this? The
answer is: They won't. It will provide ammunition for a bit of
jock-baiting from the yahoo element in the Tory party and some whingeing
from the dog-in-the-manger tendency among North of England Labour MPs.
But the English electorate will react with that serene indifference they
display towards all matters Scottish. And why not? They know perfectly
well how much ''a union of equals'' it all is.

STEPHEN J McSorley's defence of Fundamentalist Christianity (September
7) and his statement that it ''has nothing to do with acts of terror
from perpetrators who can claim divine inspiration for their inhuman
acts'' reminded me of observations upon Christian Fundamentalism in an
earlier time.
In sixteenth-century Orkney, a ''notorious witch'' called Alison
Balfour was accused of assisting the brother of the Earl of Orkney in a
plot to murder him. There was no evidence, but in those times accusation
was sufficient. The full horror of the investigation was set in motion.
She would not confess. Next her husband was tortured, and still she
refused. It was not until the last of her children was put to the
torment before her eyes that she ''confessed''. Her execution followed
swiftly.
It is the observation of the nineteenth-century English historian J A
Froude, who was recounting these events, that really chills: '' . . .
the men who inflicted these tortures would have borne them all
themselves sooner than have done any act which they consciously knew to
be wrong. They did not know that the instincts of humanity were more
sacred than the logic of theology, and in fighting against the devil
they were themselves doing the devil's work''.
Just as that Christian Fundamentalism of four centuries ago is
patently wrong today, I wonder for how long Stephen J McSorley's version
will stand the test of time, and how highly he would value the
''instincts of humanity'' against the ''logic of theology''.

JOHN Carlyle was of course right about Scots immigrants to the Baltic
(September 2). Danzig was largely a Scots business community at one
time, and when Gothenburg was founded in 1619 as Sweden's window to the
west the king ordered that half the population should be Scots and half
Dutch, to get the most astute traders of the time; and a member of one
of my ancestral lines was provost/mayor/burgomeister of Stockholm in the
eighteenth century.
But is John Carlyle right in equating Scots and bagpipes? In Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales (about 1400 AD) the miller was a piper, and the pipes
were for long a fairly universal European instrument.

ONCE again calls are being made for Government action to ''stimulate
the housing market'' by cutting interest rates. This is nothing more
than code language for house-price inflation, which benefits sellers and
bodies such as mortgage lenders and estate agents, which have a vested
interest in such inflation.
The losers are, of course, those wishing to buy, especially for the
first time, and that is the last thing we want in a supposedly
property-owning democracy.
The best way to keep prices low is to impose a high tax on land
values, in order to discourage speculation of the kind which culminated
in the crash several years ago, the consequences of which are even now
evident, with widespread negative equity and litigation against Lloyds
Bank.
At present the taxation of land values in the UK is minimal, not least
due to the switch from the admittedly flawed rating system to the Adam
Smith Institute's brainstorm, the poll tax.
A far higher land-value taxation would provide welcome scope for cuts
in those taxes which currently blight production, trade, and capital
formation, and kill off land speculation, the curse of the UK economy
since at least the 60s, when Centre Point in London symbolised what
Canary Wharf did after the latest crash.

THE legal decision against a major clearing bank for giving bad advice
would appear to stretch credibility somewhat in that it partially
rewards the speculators whose speculation came unstuck.
One must question the inherent justice in the outcome of this case.
If a speculator seeks to finance his venture with borrowed funds,
freely given, and is successful in his scheme, then all is well. If, on
the other hand, his judgment is not vindicated and loss results, does
the entire blame attach to the banker who provided the money and whose
judgment must, surely, be subject to the same fallibility as his own?
Those who borrow cannot abdicate responsibility for the risks they
take; rather should they heed what must always be good advice -- ''let
the buyer beware''.

THE Scottish Sports Council has lodged a 50-page objection to proposed
Loch Lomond by-laws, increasing the possibility of a public inquiry.
The objection has meant that yet another summer has passed with no
controls on the loch where power-boating, water-skiing and jet-skiing
are now reckoned by many to be close to taking over the water to the
exclusion of other recreational users.
The crux of the objection seems to be an attempt by the water-skiers
to have a proposed 150-metre exclusion zone around most loch shorelines
for power boats tossed on the scrapheap, leaving the situation
essentially unchanged.
A picture of confusion is emerging over the objections, with the
Scottish Sports Council stating it has acted on behalf of the national
governing bodies of not only water-skiing and power-boating, but of
angling, canoeing, yachting and windsurfing.
Yet on the loch itself, the local associations representing these
latter sports all say they support the introduction of the by-laws.
If the controls can be introduced on Loch Lomond, councils and
riparian owners on other waters may want to follow suit.
The authorities at Loch Ness are known to be interested and at Loch
Doon in Strathclyde, a move is already under way to restrict engine size
to exclude water-skiers and power-boaters facing curbs at Loch Lomond.
The Scottish Office is understood to have limited legal powers to
amend the proposed by-laws, opening the door to the possibility of
further public consultation or a public inquiry.
Mr Alan Alstead, chief executive of the SSC, told The Herald his
organisation had no wish to see an inquiry, and rejected out of hand the
widespread perception of a hidden agenda involving other loch
authorities.
He wanted the Secretary of State to ''moderate'' the proposed by-laws,
he said.
But in correspondence with the Loch Lomond Angling Improvement
Association, Mr Alstead's organisation says that the impact of the
by-laws on water-skiing would be severe and ''would affect the loch's
use as a regional facility''.
But the LLAIA has replied, saying that ''the ill-reasoned,
single-minded attitude of water-skiers to the exclusion of all other
loch users does no more than confirm the positive need that exists for
very rigid controls to be maintained on the loch''.

BLAKE. By Peter Ackroyd (Sinclair-Stevenson, #20)
AN internationally respected psychic told me some time ago: ''I have a
message for you. Study the engravings and poems of Blake. You will find
the meaning of life in them.''
My studies of Blake have been advanced by the publication of Peter
Ackroyd's biography of a neglected genius who has a message for all of
us 170 years after his death.
Most people know William Blake's name from two works, the poem that
begins, ''Tyger, tyger, burning bright'' and the spiritual lyric
Jerusalem that opens, ''And did those feet in ancient time . . .''
But there was so much more, as Ackroyd shows in 400 pages of insight.
Ackroyd, author of a daring life of Dickens, has a profound
understanding of the history of London, where Blake was born in 1757,
into lower middle-class stock numbering Dissenters and radicals.
At the age of nine Blake was sent to the leading school in London for
promising young artists, but instead of proceeding to the recently
opened Royal Academy Schools he became an apprentice engraver. His
resistance to formal learning meant that his mind was not narrowed and
cluttered with specialism, a lesson here for us in this age of so many
higher education institutions with their proliferation of courses.
Instead, the supreme autodidact absorbed only those ideas that seemed to
be vital to his development as a man and as an artist.
As Blake walked the streets of London, with its 50,000 prostitutes,
its disease and crime, he saw angels in the gutters. The capital city
was to obsess him all his life.
''I see London blind and age-bent begging through the Streets/ Of
Babylon, led by a child . . .''
Blake's spiritual mentors were Paracelsus and Boehme.
Paracelsus maintained that ''it is a great truth, which you should
seriously consider, that there is nothing in heaven or upon the earth
which does not also exist in man, and God who is in heaven exists also
in man, and the two are but One.''
The cobbler Jakob Boehme began to formulate his extraordinary body of
mythical teachings after seeing a vision of light in a pewter dish.
''Our whole doctrine is nothing else but an instruction to show how man
may create a kingdom of light within himself . . .''
Blake himself claimed to have seen the released spirit of his brother
Robert rising through the ceiling, clapping its hands for joy. Blake
incorporated the beliefs and teachings of Paracelsus, Boehme, and his
own occult experiences into a personal system by which he was to live
his life, and produce his visual and written art. Ackroyd points out
that ''as is often the case in Blake's writing, his own vision is
strangely implicated with the great oral myths of the past''.
He knew his Bible thoroughly, and would have loved to rewrite the
scriptures, which was what in effect he was doing in some of his epic
poems. His engravings -- and he was a consummate artist of the copper
plate, even introducing colour -- show an abundance of angels, an
obsession with death and the fate of man. Ackroyd assists the general
reader by asserting that ''much of his prophetic symbolism can be
understood without undue difficulty, but it requires in the reader an
awakening of what is essentially a clear and simple vision''.
Blake's wife Catherine was a humble uneducated woman, completely
devoted to her exceptional husband. She made his clothes and worked the
wooden press in their modest Lambeth home as he produced engravings for
other people's books, in his spare time illustrating his own poems. But
Catherine was lonely. ''I have very little of Mr Blake's company; he is
always in Paradise.''
There is the delightful story of a friend dropping by to find Blake
and spouse sitting naked in their summer house. ''Come in!'' cried
Blake. ''It's only Adam and Eve, you know!''
He understood the power of sex and the subconscious a century before
Freud and Jung went down into the mine. His sexual imperative was that
''enjoyment and not abstinence is the food of intellect''. He understood
women, and the Ossian-influenced Visions of the Daughters of Albion,
which is about energy and sexual liberty, ''has no parallel in the
poetry of the eighteenth century,'' Ackroyd argues. ''The moment of
desire the moment of desire! The virgin/ that pines for man; shall
awaken her womb to enormous joys.''
Blake seemed to have no politics, though he lived through times of the
making and breaking of nations. ''I am really sorry to see my countrymen
trouble themselves about politics. If men were wise the most arbitrary
princes could not hurt them; if they are not wise the freest government
is compelled to be a tyranny. Princes appear to me to be fools; Houses
of Commons and Houses of Lords appear to me to be fools. They seem to me
to be something else besides human life.'' Blake appears to have held
advanced republican views and was put on trial for sedition after an
altercation with a soldier.
His epic, The French Revolution. A Poem, in Seven Books, priced one
shilling, was never published, like so many of his productions.
There is a lesson here for today's writers looking for big deals.
Blake printed his epic masterpieces, half a dozen at a time, but these
dazzling literary and visual illuminations (the colour plates in the
Ackroyd biography are superb) did not sell. As Ackroyd points out,
Blake's reward for working outside the artistic market-place was that he
would never be taken up and then forgotten. With his work around him
always, he could entertain the possibility of future success.
Blake claimed that his dead brother gave him advice and that ''even
now I write from his Dictate''. Yeats had a spirit guide; Rilke was
convinced that his poems came from the dead; Isobel Allende believes
that her magic realism stories are dictated by a departed relative. We
should not dismiss these claims as mumbo jumbo.
In his recent book The Hallelujah Revolution (Little, Brown), Ian
Cotton discusses the experiments of Dr Michael Persinger, inventor of a
helmet which, it is claimed, induces visionary experiences by
stimulating the temporal lobe with magnetic forces.
My own observations of psychics (a natural interest for a Highlander
with second sight in the family) and my reading in Blake make me suspect
that such people may have the ability to access part of the brain --
perhaps the same part stimulated by the Persinger helmet -- that may
have a ''visionary'' function free of the constraints of time, though
not necessarily depending on communications from the dead.
When asked by a woman where his visions came from, Blake tapped his
forehead and said: ''Here, Madam.'' He declared that ghosts appeared to
unimaginative people.
Blake (''I labour upwards into Futurity'') is a model for modern man
to aspire to. ''All Religions are One,'' he maintained. He lived all his
life in a state of heightened awareness and receptivity, his brain
humming with self-generated ideas. His belief that man has within
himself the power to get the maximum benefit out of life through
self-confidence, while retaining consideration for others, is the basis
for personal development systems like Mindstore. It is called positive
thinking. He never doubted his own genius, though the world dismissed
him as mad, and he remained poor till the end.
On the day of his death Blake sketched devoted Catherine, then sang
hymns to her. ''My beloved, they are not mine,'' he told her as she
listened to what she later called ''songs of joy and triumph''. His
works are ours, prophetic books for the new millennium, and we should
learn from them, with Peter Ackroyd as our guide.

Bogota
THE sole survivor of an air crash that killed 20 people appears to
have a charmed life, having also escaped death in a bus accident and an
avalanche.
Pedro Gaitan Puentes, who is in stable condition with cuts and
bruises, escaped injury a month ago in a bus accident on a mountain
road, said a spokesman for the Colombian Red Cross.
Seven years ago, Gaitan left Armero in central Colombia a day before a
volcano erupted and buried the town, killing nearly all of its 23,000
inhabitants, including his daughter.
Gaitan lost his nine-year-old son Camilo yesterday when the plane they
were aboard crashed as it was about to land in rain and fog near a
national park 100 miles south-west of Bogota, killing all four crew
members and 16 passengers.
''Lucky? I guess it depends on what you consider lucky,'' said the Red
Cross spokesman.--Reuter.

I HAVE followed with growing anger the reports in your paper about the
reaction of French Government officials and some sections of the French
media to the protests of countries and other territories in the Pacific.
This reaction is arrogant and contemptible in the extreme. Today's test
announcement (September 6) brings to a disgusting climax weeks of
preparations in spite of protests.
A few months ago I visited a number of war cemeteries in France and
could not help noticing the large number of young men from Australia and
New Zealand who fell defending France in the First War and liberating it
in the Second.
Perhaps the present regime in France should remember this while they
treat the present generation of these countries with such arrogant
disregard.

THOMAS Inglis ridiculously accuses women at the UN Conference on Women
of wanting ''selective'' rather than ''total'' equality because they
neglect to ask for equality in the field of athletics (September 7).
The UN Conference is about fairness without which there is no justice
or equality. There's nothing fair about a woman running the same race as
a man just as there's nothing fair about a bantamweight fighting a
heavyweight. Is this men displaying ''selective'' equality or fair play?
The issue is that women are denined access to tasks which have nothing
to do with physical strength and where they could compete fairly. This
is my understanding of ''total'' equality.

IF nothing else, Michael Fry's article on the strategic development of
the Scottish tourist product was well-written but ill-informed (August
30).
Indeed he mentioned ''foggy image'' and ''Scotch mist'' in his piece
and I can only assume that his version of what is going on in Scottish
tourism is seen through such a haze. (Perhaps the ''free triple
whiskies'' have left their mark?)
The Scottish Tourist Board is better placed than I to respond to hus
remarks about strategy, Government funding (or serious lack of it by
comparison to Ireland), advertising campaigns, and market segmentation
and penetration.
However, I can't imagine how he is going to apologise to David Wilson
at the Peat Inn for his unmeant insult and the misplaced barge pole!
''Hoist on your own petard,'' Mr Fry?
David Wilson is, of course, a member of the Taste of Scotland Scheme
as are many other very well-respected establishments; Auchterarder
House, Balbirnie House, Caledonian Hotel, Cameron House, Celler
Anstruther, Gleneagles, Lochgreen House, Murrayshall, Nivingston House,
Rogano's, St Andrews Old Course Hotel, Turnberry, Ubiquitous Chip and
Westerwood to name a small selection alphabetically.
If Mr Fry thinks that the above establishments are not committed to
quality then perhaps if he buys or rents a television (his ''idiot
box'') he will find out it is 1995 and Scottish tourism has moved
forward.
There is neither time nor space to explain the current professionalism
in the industry but I would be prepared to discuss it with him over a
large Macallan on Royal Deeside. Macallans, by the way, are principal
sponsors of Taste of Scotland.

SOME easier teasers to get you going. Why do young men in faded denim
nicking car radios get a worse press than gents in #500 pinstripes
ripping off their company to a six-figure tune? Why is one of those
crimes stealing and the other something much cosier called fraud? Why is
one a crime, period, and the other only wrong if you're stupid enough to
get caught? Students who have completed this warm-up paper, should now
turn to the section on philosophy.
Does it concern you that companies manufacturing anything from tobacco
to baby-food preparations should deliberately target foreign
market-places in the Third World where the health implications of use
and misuse have yet to be debated? Do you think it legitimate to talk up
the fortunes of a company bound for public flotation in the sure and
certain knowledge that investors ignorant of this insiders' ploy will
get their fingers burned?
Do you think the Barings and BCCI banking scandals were the result of
individuals getting too greedy or companies too little concerned with
trading standards? Did you applaud the effort of small shareholders in
British Gas to intervene in the row over executive pay? Did you stop
buying petrol from Shell during the Brent Spar affair; are you now
setting your face against French Burgundy and Brie on the grounds that M
Chirac is guilty as charged of post-colonial imperialism?
I only ask having just consumed a new slimline paperback issued by the
independent think-tank Demos a few days back. It's not the kind of
publication over which Jeffrey Archer and Catherine Cookson are going to
lose much shuteye, but Sheena Carmichael's lengthy essay on business
ethics should find its way on to the bedside table of any chief
executives seriously grappling with building a dynamic, profitable, yet
values-driven company in the new millennium.
In fact that ''yet'' should probably be deleted. For Carmichael's
well-researched conclusion is that the ethically sound company by
definition is likely to prove more successful, and she underlines that
point vividly in her chapter on the US market-place where the top 30
ethically aware companies have outperformed their rivals pretty
significantly. So even if you're driven to examine your company's
ethical procedures by nothing other than a concern for the bottom line
it makes sense to do so.
The US experience can't of course be lifted and used as a template
over here. Not least because the country with a written constitution has
now got detailed written legislation covering corporate misconduct, the
small print of which would give the British business community the
screaming ab dabs. A country whose corporate leaders can't stomach the
modest provisions of the EC's social chapter is not going to go down the
US road of complex regulation.
Nevertheless, it's instructive to look at just how they did manage to
clean up a pretty murky market-place, not least in the defence industry.
And not least because while we are still investing our hopes in the
recommendations of committees like Cadbury and Nolan to raise standards,
and still hoping the City can be relied upon to sniff out its own bad
eggs, the Americans have concluded that self-regulation simply doesn't
work.
Carmichael reminds us that following a series of major defence
industry scandals in the early eighties 46 of the US big boys all signed
up to a good conduct agreement.
An end to bribery and corruption as they well knew it. Two years later
all but seven of the signatories were being investigated for fraud and
other crimes. Similarly all the insider dealing scandals made it
apparent that if there were voluntary codes of conduct in operation
nobody was paying too much attention to them.
But the interesting corollary of the move from voluntary to mandatory
codes in the US is that although the penalties are tougher, the
authorities can vary them dramatically according to how the company
concerned normally goes about its business.
If you're a company with an entrenched system of sound ethics as
opposed to one just making mouth music about it, and you fall victim to
some rogue individual's piece of private enterprise, your fine can be
reduced by as much as 95%. In other words it pays to be the kind of
organisation which establishes rules of fair play with clients and
employees and develops a bottom-up company culture monitoring and
encouraging them with full staff involvement and training.
While that kind of commitment to ethics is confined to a handful of
blue chip companies in the UK, the vast majority of American companies
at least have a code of conduct and growing numbers incorporate an
office of ethics and business practice into their company structures.
This is because, argues Carmichael, ''a company which relates all its
decisions back to a base of essential values . . . will find even the
hard decisions easier to implement''.
British managers whose knee-jerk reaction to such information would be
that it is time-consuming transatlantic jargon which would interfere
with their drive to be competitive in a shark-infested world business
order would do well to note a few home truths.
One is that almost all the available research suggests that a
well-treated, well-informed, well-motivated workforce with a pride in
its company's reputation will not only deliver increased productivity
but be comprehensively less prone to petty theft and misuse of office
equipment. It's interesting to learn, for instance, that one former
public utility had to tackle a major increase in theft and petty fraud
after privatisation. Carmichael's theory is that this reflects the fact
that most people think bad behaviour in some businesses to be the norm.
In fact she cites a Mori poll which reveals that a paltry 15% of Brits
trust multinationals to be honest and fair while twice that number trust
their daily newspaper. If you're polling worse than journalists, chaps,
time to think again about how you're running your railroad!

BACK in European exile after the hols and suddenly the long, hot
Scottish summer seems a distant but happy memory. Never again, I expect,
will I be able to boast to friends on the Continent who laugh at our
climate that I spent one calendar month in Bonnie Scotland, much of it
on the golf course, and never once put up an umbrella. And Scotland in
summer really was spectacularly bonnie to one who lives nowadays in a
country which resembles a billiard table.
I watched tourists at play in Scotland. They are our biggest industry
now and as they marvelled at our scenery I wondered what they really
thought of us and our ways. For, in the words of the travellers' song,
''Scotland's greatly altered now . . .'' -- especially to those who live
there.
Some reflections: for example, how can Scottish tourism be helped when
the world's most famous golfing country is slowly putting up the
shutters to golfing pilgrims? You cannot now play at Gleneagles or
Turnberry unless you check into their hotels which are light years
beyond the budgets of average holidaymakers. The magnificent new course
at Loch Lomond is closed to casual visitors and caters mainly for fat
cats with corporate funding. (This despite, as I recall, permission
being granted for the development on condition that it was open to local
people.)
Come the revolution and I seize control of the Scottish Tourist Board
I will be wanting answers from those who are abusing a great national
resource in this way. Golf in Scotland, as in Ireland, has always been a
game for everyone, with none of the English nonsense of courses for
artisans. This creeping elitism is alien to Scotland and bad for
business. It should be stopped now, before it spreads.
We are getting poorer. This is reflected in Britain's declining
contribution -- in proportional terms -- to the European Union. We are
about seventh in the league now as per capita net contributors, a
reflection of comparative national economic decline, although the
Government will insist that in truth we are better off. I prefer the
evidence of my own eyes.
Take Glasgow's Argyle and Sauchiehall streets which are no longer
great shopping attractions, more a concentration of cut-price stores
guarded by Big Issue hawkers and surrounded by litter. The customers
look poor in their cheap clothes and trainers. Shopping centres in most
of our cities and towns resemble tawdry markets in Athens or Poland. For
most Glaswegians a trip to Marks and Spencer has become an indulgence.
There is also a bleakness in the national persona which shows itself
in dealings with foreign visitors. We are friendly, but we have a lot to
learn about serving holidaymakers. Words like please and thank you would
be a start.
Foreigners, especially continental Europeans, puzzle at why our pride
in Scottish hospitality is sabotaged by outmoded and silly restrictions
on family eating and drinking. We sampled the Kirkcudbright hotel,
advertising coffees and snacks where snacks were forbidden -- with no
negotiation -- before noon.
Or the Lanarkshire motorway cafe which advertised cappuccino, cafe
creme, or tea. ''Cafe creme for three, please,'' we said. ''Whit's a
cafe creme?'' answered the lad behind the counter. ''It's on your
menu,'' we replied. ''Naebody telt me,'' he scowled. Somehow I can't see
him greeting guests in five languages at the Metropole in Brussels.
Or the Carnoustie hotel which refused to deliver the promised coffee.
''We've got a big function later and we're busy,'' was the excuse. On
the pavement a group of visiting Americans with dollars burning holes in
their pocket were similarly rebuffed and wandered off, mystified.
I know it is not always like that but our tourists are not all
millionaires paying for luxury and civilised service. We spurn them at
our peril.
Back in Milngavie I looked up the splendid lady who works at my local
petrol station. She is a popular character whose cheeriness attracts
lots of business, although her multinational oil company employers would
never know that. After years of loyal service she had just been sacked
and offered her own job back at a miserable wage. She had a choice, of
course. Take it or the dole.
I visited my favourite restaurant only to find that the famous head
waiter was gone, having suffered the same fate. He had been told by a
new owner that his wage was being slashed and if he did not like it he
could get lost. He quit in disgust. His appeal to an industrial tribunal
is pending and I hope he wins a stack.
There are now millions like them or, worse, unemployed. I trust their
lawyers are even now delving into European law which was designed to
prevent gross abuse of working people in this way. John Major's boast
that Europe can keep the social chapter and Britain will keep the jobs
is daily being exposed as stupid. How can it be otherwise when our
unemployment is going up again and Britain has been transformed into a
nation of taxi drivers?
Milngavie's pedestrianised town centre was being torn apart last month
to make way for the dreaded cables. A pile of bricks had been left
overnight in the care of a watchman. The poor chap had to flee in terror
as teenagers fired them through shop windows all along the main street.
This sort of thing happens almost nightly. According to the local
paper the business community is in despair. No sane person goes near the
place at night without compelling reason. Not for douce Milngavie the
pavement cafes of the Continent -- even in a sultry August evening -- or
a lively street life at night. Instead the place is turned over to bands
of menacing social inadequates and drunks in Gazza haircuts who
terrorise anyone daft enough to walk through the area after the shops
close. Funny, but after several weeks in Milngavie I cannot recall
seeing a policeman in the town centre.
I conclude that I am becoming a typically crabbit expatriate. You know
the type: they live abroad for a few years and increasingly find fault
with their homeland on their occasional visits. But seeing ourselves as
others see us is always instructive, and sometimes embarrassing.
I take comfort in the hope that the Scotland which we Scots know best
is not the Scotland we show to the rest of the world.

MR DAVID TRIMBLE, the new leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, is long
on dogmatism and short on experience. He has inherited the leadership of
a disgruntled party which feels that it has been sidelined in the
discussions taking place on the peace process in Northern Ireland and on
the future of the province. That disgruntlement has been Mr Trimble's
opportunity, for it allowed his candidacy to be preferred over that of
more experienced and less severe figures. It may also lead to serious
problems for both Mr Trimble and the Ulster Unionists. He will feel
bound to live up to the hard-line image which he has fostered and which
is expected of him by the surprisingly large proportion of UUP members
who preferred him to Mr Taylor. He is, after all, a hero of the Siege of
Drumcree, that unfortunate episode in July when Mr Trimble stood side by
side with the Rev Ian Paisley as a nasty confrontation developed between
Orangemen and police over the re-routing of a parade. To describe that
unruly affair as a siege may be a pleasant conceit for those Unionists
who breathe the air of a different age, but Mr Trimble must take care
that such nonsense does not distract him from wider duties and greater
responsibilities.
He has not made a good start, at least as far as the wider context is
concerned. His hint that getting rid of some weapons may not be enough
to allow Sinn Fein to take part in all-party talks on Ulster's future
will have delighted many members of his party just as certainly as it
will have dismayed more moderate Unionists and those who hope for a
convincingly pluralist approach to political affairs. It was needless
confrontation at this point. The test for Mr Trimble will be to see how
far he needs to take a hard line in order to reassure his party, and how
soon he feels able (if, indeed, he does) to work with others to maintain
and extend the present peace. His inexperience may work against him in
this respect. He has been a member of Parliament for only five years and
although he is an able performer on television and when making speeches
he has not always won the support of parliamentary colleagues, some of
whom find him difficult and impetuous.
Much will depend on how Mr Trimble tackles the task of finding a new
position for the UUP in the fluid and increasingly faltering peace
process. He has obvious strands of pragmatism, particularly in his
expected support for ending the formal ties between the Orange Order and
the Unionist Party. He was, moreover, something of a strategist for the
former leader, Mr James Molyneaux, who was not always as unbending as
his formidable exterior suggested. One of his first tasks will be to
decide whether to accept an invitation from the Irish Foreign Minister
to take part in talks with the Dublin Government. Mr Trimble has said he
is willing but it seems that his purpose will be only to set out the
position of the Unionists. Whether he will feel able to take the next
step and to contemplate negotiations, with all that implies of necessary
compromise, is quite a different matter. Just as importantly, he will
have to decide what sort of relationship he wants with the British
Government and whether he feels able to continue the understanding which
Mr Molyneaux achieved with Mr Major. That understanding was a potent
source of friction for Unionists and Mr Major should not assume it will
continue. The mood of the Unionists is hardening; that much is clear.
Whether Mr Trimble will lead his party creatively or merely reflect and
reinforce its mood is crucial to hopes of peace.

THE reaction to Jacques Chirac's decision to resume French nuclear
testing, in particular the reaction to the test on Muroroa Atoll, has
frankly astonished me (September 6).
Mr Chirac called it ''hysterical,'' and once again the worst offenders
were the environmental lobby who clearly cannot be trusted to argue on a
scientific basis, preferring instead to use propaganda which, as the
Brent Spar debacle demonstrates, is somewhat economical with the truth
at times.
I am not trying to condone nuclear weapons, for any weapon with such
destructive power cannot be supported by any right-thinking person. I am
saying that we must make the best of the situation in which we presently
find ourselves.
Anti-nuclear groups and environmental protestors would like to see
countries such as Britain and France get rid of their nuclear deterrent
but this is simply madness given the potentially volatile nature of the
situation in the former USSR and in many other places around the world.
The world will never be totally free of nuclear weapons and, as such,
certain countries must act as ''guardians'' to ensure that any mad
dictator in the future is deterred from using this most hideous of
weapons.
France is one of those countries, and it has a duty to ensure that its
arsenal is in working order.
Chirac must continue with the tests for the long-term good of mankind
to ensure that we are safe and that we will never again be subjected to
the horror of Hiroshima.

Tallahassee
FOR the third time in less than a year, an 18-year-old Florida youth
will stand trial for the murder of a British tourist gunned down at a
remote highway rest stop two years ago.
Jury selection is due to begin tomorrow in the trial of John ''Billy
Joe'' Crumitie for the murder of Yorkshire lorry driver Gary Colley, who
was killed during a botched robbery attempt in September 1993.
The two previous trials ended in hung juries. Crumitie, who is also
charged with attempted murder and attempted robbery, faces life
imprisonment if convicted.
The trial has been moved to Pensacola, about 220 miles from
Monticello, Crumitie's home town and site of the first trial.
The upcoming trial is expected to last less than a week. If so, the
prosecution again will call Mr Colley's girlfriend, Margaret Jagger, as
a witness.
She was wounded in the attack and has been unable to identify Crumitie
as being one of two shooters at the scene.
The couple were shot at an interstate rest stop where they had stopped
to sleep after driving back from New Orleans.
Mr Colley was shot as he tried to escape in the couple's rented car.
He was the ninth foreign tourist killed in Florida within a year,
igniting international outrage that harmed the state's $32bn-a-year
tourist industry. -- Reuter.

ABOVE the floodlit ramparts of Stirling Castle, the pyrotechnics lent
their own mysterious magic to one of Scotland's finest settings -- and
helped to bring us once more to the story of our greatest national hero,
William Wallace.
After the fireworks, Hollywood heart-throb Mel Gibson, resplendent in
Highland dress, took his persona of William Wallace to the dance floor
of the Great Hall and charmed the ladies who had the good fortune to
join his particular line of Strip the Willow.
No wonder that line extended far beyond the accepted limits as Gibson,
with plaid a-swinging, birled his way towards the last ecstatic dame!
That party for 750 has generally been acclaimed as one of the most
glittering occasions in Scotland's social history. It followed
immediately upon the premiere of Braveheart, Gibson's portrayal of
William Wallace, and if the star was upset to find himself used as
propaganda for the cause of Scottish independence then his naivety is
greater than you would normally find in his native Australia.
I'm not sounding the horn for the Nationalists but if they didn't seek
to make capital from this, the highest exposure the great Wallace may
ever know, they would be acting out of character.
You can pick many a hole in the historical accuracy of the screenplay
but the American Randall Wallace has nevertheless come up with a very
fine, general impression of what Wallace did for Scotland.
I'm always fascinated by the starting-point of major events, the seed
which was sown in someone's mind. In this case, the writer Wallace was
visiting Scotland in 1983 when he spotted the statue of his namesake at
Edinburgh Castle. Inquiring from a family point of view, and discovering
what a hero Wallace was, he was appalled to think he had never heard of
him.
When he later visited the Wallace Monument at Stirling and tested a
few passers-by, he found that even native Scots didn't know much more.
So he set about his book and, in time, the screenplay which is currently
firing much enthusiasm among American film-goers. From this week onwards
I reckon it will stir an even deeper reaction in the Scots themselves.
As Randall Wallace said: ''The great legends about this man built a
fire in my heart. His life communicated that you will prevail if you are
faithful to what you believe in, and if those you love believe in you.
Your body can be broken but not your spirit.''
Well, Wallace's body was broken right enough -- beheaded, drawn and
quartered, and sent to the corners of the kingdom as a warning to others
who might think of standing up for Scotland.
Somehow, our school history gave us a stronger sense of Robert the
Bruce than it did of Wallace but it was Bruce who deserted the great man
at the crucial Battle of Falkirk and was stirred only later to take up
his fight against the English. Thus we know about Bannockburn but much
less about Wallace's famous victory over Edward's army at Stirling
Bridge.
Not that our history teaching was ever adequate. A friend of mine can
claim an honours degree on the subject from Glasgow University --
without having done a single line of Scottish history!
The irony is that Mel Gibson, an Australian-American who made most of
this Hollywood film in Ireland, may do more to tell the world about
Scotland's most heroic figure than any soul has ever done.
Braveheart is a brave effort indeed, defying the imagination when you
study the logistics of making such a film, with its fearsome battles
between armies which seem to run into thousands. My attention span for a
film seldom runs to three hours but this one didn't threaten my rear
quarters with even a hint of numbness. In other words, don't miss it.
When 20th Century Fox had wrapped up Wallace at the Stirling premiere,
the limousines took guests to that spectacular bash at the historic
castle. Familiar faces from film and television were there, along with
sponsors, local councillors, and dignitaries.
Scotland is too small a country to possess any large body of celebrity
so we tend to see the same faces, drawn from one of those rent-a-guest
lists which pass from one organiser to another.
So there was a modern-day hero in Gavin Hastings, fresh from his rugby
triumphs, and Jackie Stewart, now fading a little in the public memory.
Inevitably these days there was Ally McCoist, who may not have played
much football in recent years but still suffers from gross over-exposure
in the Scottish press.
And there were the glamorous newscasters who can become famous these
days by reading an Autocue; as well as Kirsty Young who was given the
seal of celebrity by one of our tabloids, which offered a page-one
splash on the claim that, after the Stirling party, she shared a
romantic night at a posh hotel with a top sportsman.
Who cares? But such is the froth of triviality which occupies so many
minds in a so-called sophisticated society. It's a depressing measure of
our progress in the 700 years since William Wallace, without benefit of
newspapers or television, fired the spirit of a nation. We certainly
don't make them like that any more.

INVESTIGATORS have finished their fingertip search of the rail track
where an InterCity express caught fire and one fleeing passenger died
when he was hit by another train.
No evidence of vandalism has been found on the line, and inquiries
will now focus on the train itself.
Civil servant Mr Ian Jones, 35, died as he fled the blazing 18.30
Paddington to Swansea InterCity express into the path of a Bristol to
Paddington train near Maidenhead station, in Berkshire, on Friday.
British Transport Police said its initial investigations had uncovered
no criminal involvement, but inquiries would continue. The police
appealed for anyone who was on the train which caught fire and who may
have information to contact them, on 0171-380 1400.
It is thought the train's fuel tank came loose and dropped on to the
track, fracturing and leaking fuel, which ignited around the carriages
behind, causing terror to the hundreds of passengers on board.
Mr David Mathieson, of the Great Western Trains Company, said a Health
and Safety Executive inspector would now piece together the bits from
the train which were recovered by the weekend's search to try to find
out what happened. He said that the train driver was ''very distressed''
and was off work for the time being.
About 20 people received minor injuries in the incident and were
treated for cuts, bruises and smoke inhalation.
Mr Jones's widow, Carol Ann, a 35-year-old teacher, who friends said
was expecting her second child at Christmas, was being comforted at her
home in Broad Hinton, near Swindon, yesterday.

<HEADLINE>Minister admits rail sell-off is off target</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976437523</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government has apparently accepted that its rail sell-off is
running into trouble following an admission by Transport Secretary Sir
George Young.
He said in an interview yesterday that, if the Government's timetable
for rail privatisation failed to meet its target, ''it wouldn't be the
end of the world''.
He confirmed that the target was to sell off 51% of the train
franchises by April 1996. But he added: ''It wouldn't be the end of the
world if it slipped a bit. But I want it to remain a target.''
Sir George, interviewed on Alastair Stewart/GMTV's Sunday Programme,
said: ''It remains a target, and we're making good progress towards
it.''
But franchising was not the only part of the process and many of the
British Rail assets have already been sold.
Railtrack would be floated during the lifetime of this parliament, he
said, and by the end of this year, the rolling stock companies, the
companies that own the trains and the engines, would have been sold.
''I want to make it absolutely clear that we are going ahead.
Railtrack will be floated during the lifetime of this parliament. There
is an irreversible momentum of the franchises.
''The first ones will be let this year, and there is a rolling
programme which will go on. ScotRail, West Coast mainline, will go out
to tender next year.''
He accused the Labour Party of doing a lot of ''huffing and puffing'',
and complaining about what the Government was doing but they could not
say it was so unacceptable that they would reverse it.
This was the weak link in Labour's approach, said Sir George, adding:
''They can't say, and they won't say 'we will reverse what the
Government's doing','' he added.
Meanwhile, it was claimed that young rail users could see their fares
rise by a third in the wake of privatisation.
The Save our Railways pressure group produced a letter from the Office
for Passenger Rail Franchises, which sets out proposed fare structures
under the privatised system.
Child fares are currently restricted to 50% of the adult fare in most
cases.
But the letter from Mr James Cruddas of the rail fares watchdog
indicates that after privatisation child fares will be restricted to 34%
below the adult fare, the same level as currently applies to the young
person's railcard, which gives 16 to 26-year-olds discount fares.
The letter, sent to the anti-privatisation group, says child fares
''must generally be available on terms which are no less favourable than
those available to the holder of a Young Person's Railcard''.
Save our Railways co-ordinator Jonathan Bray said the decision would
''price many families off our rail network''.
''It shows that the Government's claim that rail fares will be capped
following privatisation is a joke,'' he added.

AN OVERWHELMING majority of Scots want water and sewerage services
kept under local government control, according to a System Three poll
commissioned by Unison.
The results show that four out of five voters and 72% of Tory voters
are in favour of retaining council control, the trade union said today.
Only 11% of voters want water to be transferred to three water
authorities.
Mr Matt Smith, Unison Scottish secretary, said the poll, of 1045
people, was a huge vote of confidence in Scottish local government. ''If
John Major has come to listen to grass-roots Tories in Scotland he
should heed the message they are sending him. And if Michael Forsyth is
serious about returning powers to local government, the poll suggests he
should begin with water and sewerage services.
''It is unacceptable that a service as vital as water should be run by
hand-picked appointees of the Secretary of State instead of
democratically-elected councillors.''
The poll was conducted between August 24 and 29.

VANDALS were probably responsible for a power failure that caused
severe disruption to several train services to and from Glasgow Queen
Street station last night, a ScotRail spokesman said.
The failure, just after 6.30pm, knocked out all the points and
signalling systems, affecting services for more than an hour. Services
were expected to be back to normal today.

A PUB landlord faces a #920 bill after a man was able to call India
for 10p a time on the bar's payphone.
While the mystery man made hundreds of 10p calls to his girlfriend in
India, BT charged the publican, Mr Jack Cooper, at a rate of #2.90 a
minute.
The owner of the Globe Bar, West Port, Dundee, normally receives a
quarterly bill of around #200 for the payphone which he owns.
But when his last bill came in, Mr Cooper was stunned to discover that
the demand from BT was for #920.
Mr Cooper, 53, explained: ''The Indian chap used to come in every
lunchtime and get #2 worth of 10p pieces to call his girlfiend in India.
''He only got through for a few seconds every time, but he just used
to keep phoning her up.''
He added: ''I never thought anything of it at the time.''
When the bill arrived Mr Cooper asked for a print out of all calls
made on the payphone because he thought BT had made a mistake.
He said: ''We found out that hundreds of phone calls had been made to
India.
''In less than an hour one day there were 75 calls made to the
country.
''The bloke only got through for a few seconds each time for his 10p,
but BT have charged me at #2.90 a minute.''
The bar owner said: ''I've no intention of paying this huge bill. The
fault lies with BT.
''I've now removed the international dialling facility from the
payphone.''
He added: ''The money in the cash box usually pays the bill, but this
time I've been left with a #700 headache.''
The Indian man has not been seen in the bar since the bill arrived.
A spokesman for BT said: ''The bill is accurate. Our exchange
equipment has recorded these calls.
''The payphone is owned by Mr Cooper. He is responsible for setting
the charges for the calls on the phone, which is his own property and
responsibility.''
The spokesman added that Mr Cooper had been charged the ''proper fee''
for the calls.

FORMER trader Nick Leeson, blamed for the #860m Barings collapse, has
told of his feeling of unreality as huge losses began to mount, tempting
him to gamble more to recover the money.
''There were days when I could lose #25 to #30m. There were days when
I made #50m. Not every day is a down day,'' he said in an interview with
Sir David Frost, filmed at Hoechst Prison in Germany, where he is being
held.
Mr Leeson, 28, is fighting extradition to Singapore, where he faces
charges of fraud and forgery. His wish to face justice in Britain could
come closer today as the Serious Fraud Office meets to decide whether to
ask for his extradition.
Mr Leeson said he was protecting a female member of staff the first
time he failed to enter a loss in the bank's books. The woman, a local
from Singapore, had mistakenly sold futures when she should have bought
them, creating a #20,000 loss.
Mr Leeson said he reactivated a ''dormant'' account which was not
monitored by Barings chiefs in London and which could be used to absorb
the loss. This account became the hiding place for the debts of #325m
which he then built up.
Accusing Barings chiefs in London of being out of their depth and
unable to control the futures trading of the bank's Singapore office, Mr
Leeson added that he never realised while he was trading that he had
brought the bank to its knees.
The first time he understood what had happened was when he saw a
newspaper stand while on holiday with his wife, Lisa, in Malaysia. On
hearing the news, the couple flew back to Europe.

<TEXT>
THIRTY roads were closed by floods, landslides, or subsidence in the
North and North-east of Scotland yesterday with the driest summer on
record turning into monsoon conditions.
The deluge, associated with the tail-end of a tropical hurricane, has
produced almost one inch of rain falling on average every day since the
start of the month, with more to come. Already most places in Moray,
Banffshire, and Buchan have had their wettest recorded September,
although it is only one-third of the way into the month.
An expert said part of the problem was the summer heatwave, which left
the sea surface unusually warm.
The main A96 Aberdeen to Inverness road was closed all day when the
River Deveron overflowed, turning the Huntly by-pass into a torrent. All
traffic was diverted away from the floods through the main streets of
the Strathbogie town.
Thirty miles further east the carriageway was under water near Alves,
Morayshire, and Grampian Police issued warnings to drivers thoughout the
region to drive with extreme care due to the amount of surface water on
all roads.
Flood alerts were in force for the rivers Spey, Findhorn, and Lossie.
The Spey overflowed its banks and shut the access road from the A96 near
Fochabers to Spey Bay on the Moray Firth coast.
An unclassified road serving the Speyside distillery village of
Carron, Moray, may remain shut for several days as the deluge loosened
topsoil, bringing a landslide of hundreds of tonnes of mud and rocks on
to the carriageway.
Another road in Moray, the B9010 linking Dallas to Craigmill will be
closed for several days, with the carriageway undermined by subsidence
caused by flooding.
The worst-affected flood areas were around the towns of Huntly, Keith,
and Elgin, where thousands of acres of low-lying farmland was under
water and higher ground in Upper Morayshire and Banffshire was also
affected.
The deluge has come from an intense area of low atmospheric pressure,
associated with the tail-end of Hurricane Louis.
Metereological expert, Mr Roland Chaplain, of Castle Douglas-based
Weather Watchers, explained that the intense rain-carrying ''low''
tracked up the English Channel and then up through the North Sea where
its warm air picked up extra moisture, as the sea-surface was unusually
warm following the prolonged heatwave.
He said: ''That system then sent fronts over North and North-east
Scotland which have stayed almost stationary for days on end, bringing
the rain bucketing down in torrents.''
He said it was ''very unusual'' for the North of Scotland to get wet
weather from an easterly direction in September.
Up to eight inches of rain has fallen since the start of the month in
the North and North-east. In contrast, the west coast, which usually
takes the brunt of Atlantic-origin storms at this time of year, has been
in the rain-shadow, with South-west Scotland still in near-drought
conditions.
The forecast is still more rain. Another depression over southern
England is heading northwards and the areas currently most affected by
the freak monsoon conditions are again most at risk from renewed
rainfall today and early tomorrow.

AN ornate set of gates marking the 900th anniversary of Colinton Kirk,
in Edinburgh, was yesterday dedicated by the Moderator of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
The gates, which create a new entrance to one of Scotland's oldest
churches, have been donated anonymously.
They have been designed by sculptor Jack Sloan, whose most recent
commissions include the fences and gates of Provan's Lordship in
Glasgow.
The congregation joined the Moderator, the Right Rev James Harkness,
in an appropriate song of praise -- ''Ye gates, lift up your heads on
high'' -- following the service.
The minister of Colinton Kirk, the Rev George Whyte, said: ''The gates
will be a permanent reminder of the passing of this milestone in our

TUC general secretary John Monks has warned of, and indeed welcomed,
the prospect of an upsurge in union militancy.
Writing in the current issue of Aslef's Locomotive Journal, he accuses
some bosses of lining their pockets with scant regard to the wider
interest, and suggested that some needed to be challenged.
''Militancy reminds us not to be too complacent,'' he writes, adding
that unions would challenge injustice and the policy of greed that had
suffused British boardrooms.
''So some militancy is to be welcomed,'' he said.
''The only reason there has not been more militancy of late is the
high levels of unemployment and job insecurity.''
His warning comes as the Transport and General Workers' Union and the
GMB embark on industrial campaigns to win basic rates of ''at least'' #4
an hour for their low-paid members. The TGWU has set aside a #1m ''war
chest'' to support any industrial action in support of that demand.
Meanwhile, a survey by solicitors Dibb Lupton Broomhead has warned of
a ''significant surge'' in industrial unrest.
A survey of 100 companies found that one in three had been hit by some
form of industrial unrest in the past year, a big rise over the previous
12 months.
One in four employers which recognise trade unions said it expected
some form of industrial unrest over the next 12 months, according to the
report.
Actual strikes remained constant at 8% over the past year, and nine
out of 10 unions were more likely to opt for selective forms of action,
the report found.
More companies in the north were hit by industrial action than in the
south over the past year.
Mr Paul Nicholls, one of the report's authors, said: ''Our survey
shows a mounting undercurrent of industrial tension which has yet to
manifest itself in an increase of actual stoppages.
''Disputes seem to be resolved before actual strike action, but more
employers than ever expect industrial trouble in the future, and there
seems every reason to believe that this expectation is correct.''

ONE in three workers is afraid to take time off work when sick because
it could be held against them, the TUC claimed yesterday.
A report -- Trade Unions and Insecurity at Work -- sets out the
results of a national survey, which, the TUC says, reveals new levels of
insecurity at work which includes ''fear of crossing the boss''.
Seventy seven per cent say their job is less secure than two years
ago, and 56% think it will be less safe still in two years.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, used the report to boost the
need for unions as ''Your voice at work'', the theme of this year's
conference.
He believed ''this intensifying insecurity results directly from the
Government's drive to remove basic protections for people at work''.
The report shows 76% of people in work, including those who are not
union members, think unions do protect their interests.
Mr Monks also referred to research showing that the fear of
unemployment is widely seen as a key reason for the sharp decline in the
numbers of days lost through strikes.
He pointed out: ''Ironically, when strikes do take place, insecurity
at work is now a major cause, second only to pay.''
He also drew attention to a poll by the Institute of Managment and BBC
Business Breakfast programme showing 90% of business managers responding
saw a meaningful role for trade unions in the economy.
Mr Monks saw this as leaving the Government ''out on a limb in
refusing to be positive about trade unions''.

THE Roman Catholic priest who questioned his Church's ban on sex for
its clergy yesterday won support for his views from his parishioners.
He was described as a ''very popular'' priest who had trebled the
number of churchgoers since taking charge more than a year ago, and many
agreed that priests should have a choice in the matter.
The Church itself played down any suggestion of controversy over the
call for an end to compulsory celibacy for priests. It also said there
was no question of the priest being reprimanded.
The ban on sex was questioned by Father Steve Gilhooley, of Our Lady's
in Currie, Midlothian, who said priests should be allowed to choose
whether to be celibate.
In a programme broadcast by BBC Radio Scotland yesterday, Father
Gilhooley said: ''We are not given the forum to actually say it's okay
to be a sexual being. We are saying you're not allowed to have sex and
not only that, you're not allowed to think about it.''
He said listeners would want to know if he was celibate or not, but he
added: ''I am not going to answer that, because it's my business.
''But what I do feel is that at the moment it is enforced celibacy. I
have chosen celibacy, but in a lot of ways it was forced or fobbed upon
me, and what I would like to see is people choosing it.''
In the Benchmark radio programme, the 33-year-old priest was asked if
he wanted sex or needed a relationship. He replied ''Yeah'' to both
questions, adding: ''Because I see the two as one thing.''
There appeared a great deal of support for him in his parish. Mr Neil
Doherty, 40, said: ''I think a priest is the same as anyone else and has
the same needs and wants. They should have a choice, and I think priests
should be speaking out on issues such as this.''
Mr Hugh McKnight, 23, said: ''I think each person has a choice and
he's entitled to have his own personal opinion.''
Ms Catherine Sweeney, 72, said: ''Everyone is entitled to their
opinion, priests included. There is supposedly a great shortage of
priests. I'd rather have married priests or women priests than no
priests at all.''
The priest was not at morning Mass and a colleague took the service.
He appears to have been upset by a BBC press release, rather than the
programme, claiming it had tried to ''sensationalise'' matters. A
spokesman for BBC Scotland declined to comment.

<HEADLINE>New report claims excise duty policy is damaging economy. Lower tax urged for drinks industry</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>NICOLA REEVES</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976437540</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE British drinks industry is overtaxed and undervalued, according to
a report published today by the Adam Smith Institute.
Mr Keith Boyfield, the author of the report entitled Too Much to
Swallow -- The Case for Lower Excise Duties on Alcohol, says tax policy
on alcohol has created a mass of anomalies and is damaging both the
domestic drinks industry and the economy as a whole.
Since 1979, 12,000 jobs are said to have gone in the Scottish whisky
industry with nearly 40 distilleries closing.
More than 10,000 full-time equivalent jobs have been lost as a result
of lower beer sales.
The tax discrimination is said to be particularly marked in the case
of spirits which are taxed twice as heavily as beer or wine, encouraging
consumers to purchase wine, which is nearly all imported.
In contrast, prices in Italy for whisky, gin, and vodka are about half
those charged in Britain.
The British drinks industry is a major moneyspinner for the
Government. Excise duties and VAT from Scotch whisky sales in the UK are
estimated to contribute around #1000m each year to the Treasury.
Scotch whisky is a big export earner for the UK, generating #2200m in
foreign currency earnings, making it among the top five UK exports.
In gross terms, the Scotch whisky industry is Scotland's largest
manufactured export.
Despite job losses, it remains a major employer particularly in rural
areas of Scotland. More than 90% of Scotch whisky production occurs in
areas which have been designated for Regional Fund assistance by the
European Union.
Mr Boyfield argues in favour of the principle of equivalency being
adopted in the UK and EU as the basis for levying duties on alcohol.
Alcohol would be taxed in accordance with a given rate of duty per unit
of alcohol.
He says such a reform would minimise distortions between the UK and EU
which have led to the emergence of a thriving trade in bootleg alcohol,
thought to be attracting the attentions of organised criminal gangs.
As a means of reform, Mr Boyfield suggests a five-year programme in
which the duty on spirits would be halved to bring it into line with
that on beer.
Over the same period, excise duties on beer and wine should be frozen
with the aim of reducing the real rates of duty as it applies to these
drink categories.

<TEXT>
GIRLS are better than boys at coping with problems even at primary
school age, experts heard in Glasgow yesterday.
Research among eight-year-olds has found girls have a larger armoury
of skills for dealing with problems, and are more likely to enlist
support from other people.
The findings of psychologists Gill Burdett and Harriet Gross from
Loughborough University of Technology were presented at a conference of
the British Psychological Society.
The researchers asked children aged eight and 10 to fill in
questionnaires based on common problems -- bullying, falling out with
friends, parents not listening to them, and being treated unfairly.
In all the cases, girls responded differently, said the researchers.
They had more ways of coping, were more likely to show their emotions,
avoided problems and confrontations, and tried to get more support from
other people.
''These early differences between girls and boys are important
indicators of later coping strategies,'' the researchers said.
The conference also heard that Scottish secondary school pupils who
did small amounts of part-time work got better Standard Grade exam
assessments than other pupils.
Fourth-year students who worked five hours a week or less were
compared to those classmates who had never worked, and those who worked
longer hours.
Those doing five hours or less got better exam assessments, had better
school attendance, and were more likely to return to school for a fifth
year, according to the study carried out by Paisley University.
But pupils working the longest hours got the poorest Standard Grade
results, suggesting part-time work was good for youngsters, but only in
small doses.

POLICE divers will today resume a search sparked off after two women
spotted what they thought was a human hand sticking out of a giant
reservoir.
An underwater camera was used to scour the depths of the 750 million
gallon capacity Craigmaddie reservoir at Milngavie Waterworks, the main
source of Glasgow's water.
The water level was dropped by two to three feet to help the divers
gain access to parts of the reservoir.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said last night: ''The women
thought they saw a body in the water.
''So far all we've found is a piece of wood which may or may not be
the object the women saw.
''However we have to be 100% sure and a diving team will resume a
search of the reservoir on Monday morning.''
A Strathclyde Water Services spokesman said: ''The sighting was
reported to us about 5.45pm on Saturday and we immediately contacted the
police.''

<HEADLINE>Fowler calls for help to first-time buyers. Rent blow to house-owning democracy</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976437543</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FURTHER bad news was heaped on the housing market last night with a
report that the proportion of people owning their own homes is falling
for the first time in a century.
The City housing analyst Rob Thomas, of broking house UBS, said on
BBC2's The Money Programme: ''Two-thirds of the population now own their
own homes. The number is now falling, as more and more properties that
were brought into owner-occupation in the 1980s become rented out.''
His warning that ''the property-owning democracy in that sense has
died'' coincided with a plea from the former Conservative Cabinet
Minister, Sir Norman Fowler MP, for more help for first-time home
buyers.
The former party chairman, referring to recent reports that the
Government is close to rejecting such a move, warned: ''In my view that
would be a great mistake.''
A survey for The Money Programme found that 50% of non-home owners do
not expect ever to own a home. It said that 17% did not expect to own
before the turn of the century and only 10% thought they would buy in
the next two years.
The programme also predicted that the changes to income support being
introduced next month would see repossessions rise dramatically.
According to Mr Thomas, there will be 55,000 repossessions this year and
65,000 in 1996.
Nationwide Building Society chief executive Brian Davis told the
programme the Government's measures would make mortgages harder to
obtain for some.
He warned that marginal borrowers will find it more difficult because
they will not be able to find the required insurance premium, and
building societies will be cautious because they will fear borrowers
will run into debt in the future.
Sir Norman said in a speech to the New Hall branch of his Sutton
Coldfield constituency association that owning a home lay ''at the
heart'' of Conservative philosophy.
Although he did not think the Government could introduce a specific
negative equity scheme, or guarantee particular prices, it could
encourage the market generally, in particular the first-time buyer.
Sir Norman, chairman of the National House-Building Council, warned
that the housing market was ''in crisis''.
''Sales are down. New home starts are starkly lower. Some
house-builders have pulled out of the market altogether. Thousands of
home owners remain with negative equity.
''No-one wants to see a return to the housing inflation of the late
1980s. But that is not the prospect. Currently housing is in recession,
and yet all the surveys show that people still want to own their own
home.
''Ironically, in terms of inflation, price of houses, interest rates,
this is an exceptional time to buy.''
Sir Norman said a first-time buyer scheme which increased the rate of
mortgage relief to 25% and the Miras threshold to around #40,000 could
have a knock-on effect throughout the housing market.
Many Tory back-bench MPs believe Government failure to try to revive
the depressed property market could cost them their seats at the next
General Election.
And there was speculation that the Prime Minister was poised to act
after he made a speech in July, ruling out any further cuts in mortgage
tax relief.
However, a recent newspaper report said Mr Major and Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke are close to deciding there will be no special measures
to help the housing market in the forthcoming Budget. It seems they are
unmoved by back-bench pressure to intervene and believe that keeping
interest rates low is more effective.
But some mortgage lenders hope the Chancellor could decide to scrap
the 1% stamp duty on house sales.

HOUSE break-ins and car theft reports dropped significantly in the
Fife region earlier this year
In a report to be published today, the Chief Inspector of
Constabulary, Mr John Boyd, praised Fife Police for a 15% fall in
reported crime and a 5% increase in detection rates.
Statistics for the early part of 1995 revealed a particular drop in
housebreaking, car thefts and thefts from cars, Mr Boyd said.
''It is hoped that this trend can be maintained throughout the year
and beyond,'' he said.
Community schemes aimed at crime prevention and education, which aided
detection, also came in for praise.
Mr Boyd described Fife as ''a traditional-style force with strong ties
to the local community it serves''.
He commended the implementation of 10 recommendations made in his
primary report of 1994, including the introduction of target times for
urgent response calls.
''Cognisance has also been taken of various observations and comments
which were not accorded the status of full recommendations and in
consequence I am very satisfied with the force response to the views of
the inspectorate,'' he said.
''I was pleased to see that specific targets have now been set,
initially at 20-minute and 10-minute response time in rural and urban
areas respectively.''
And the force's new headquarters at Glenrothes, replacing the existing
base at Dysart, will accommodate communications and garaging as
recommended.
Mr Boyd said he was impressed with work on the building and to see his
suggestion had been taken on board.
He commended the Fife force for taking the changes on board.
Fife was entering ''a new era'' as the force prepared to meet the
changes of the new single-tier authorities, Mr Boyd said. The new
authorities would allow a more integrated police and civilan support
structure, freed from central government establishment controls.

MORE investment in marketing is needed to build on this summer's
tourism success, the chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board claimed last
night.
Mr Ian Grant, speaking at the Council for Travel and Tourism dinner in
Edinburgh, called for more investment to sustain the industry's growth.
''The right marketing messages alone are not enough. Worldwide,
competition is growing and standards rising. We must offer the visitor
value for money, high standards and an excellent tourism infrastructure
or there simply may not be a second visit.
''We need more resources for high-grade marketing and continuing
investment by the trade itself in the tourism product,'' he said.
After a decline last year, Mr Grant revealed a boost of 14% in tourism
expenditure in the first five months of 1995, but he stressed
sustainability should be the ultimate goal of Scotland's tourism
industry, which employs 8% of the country's workforce and injects #2000m
into the economy.
Meanwhile, Glasgow is set to have its best tourist season since 1990,
when it reigned as European City of Culture, according to Greater
Glasgow Tourist Board.
Figures for January to July show a 7% increase in inquiries at the
Glasgow Tourist Centre, with a 12% rise in accommodation bookings
through the centre and a 6% upturn in hotel occupancy rates.
Greater Glasgow Tourist Board chief executive Jack Munro said a
sustained and targeted marketing programme, along with ongoing product
investment, had boosted visitor numbers to the city to 1.2 million each
year, worth an estimated #400m to the local economy.

SCOTS holidaymakers are among the thousands believed to be affected by
the collapse of a travel company.
London-based Villmar Travel Ltd ceased trading on Friday, leaving a
group of hundreds of tourists, including Scots, without accommodation.
They were stranded at a Turkish airport for hours.
The holidaymakers were said to be furious that the company went bust
before they flew out on holiday.
The Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday that all those stranded at
the airport had been placed in local hotels on Saturday.
A CAA spokeswoman said: ''Normally when a company collapses we let
passengers who have already packed their bags fly because the
accommodation has been paid for in advance. Obviously this hasn't
happened in this case.
''The passengers have all been taken to accommodation and will be able
to have their holidays and fly back without any further worry.''
Almost 300 people are due to fly to or from Glasgow Airport on Villmar
holidays this week. Tour company Inspirations dealt with 16
holidaymakers bound for Cyprus yesterday and 30 more are due to leave
Glasgow for Corfu today. The holiday destinations are all in Cyprus,
Greece or Turkey.
Airport staff said the collapse of the company should not cause any
major disruption of flights, which will continue as scheduled. Staff at
Edinburgh Airport said they were not aware of any Villmar passengers due
to arrive or depart from the capital.
The company was authorised to carry 59,688 passengers and unconfirmed
reports suggest a couple of thousand people are already on holiday and
several thousand more have advance bookings with the company. By
comparison, travel giants Thomson Holidays carry around three million
people a year.
The Civil Aviation Authority has called in its Air Travel Organiser's
Licence (ATOL) bond of #1.4m. That money will be used to provide
alternative transport and accommodation as well as refunds for people
who do not take their holidays.
A CAA spokeswoman said: ''We don't know detailed numbers of the people
involved but we will be working on this over the next few days.''
She said it was ''impossible to say'' if the bond would cover the
entire cost of the refunds and provision of alternative travel
arrangements but added that it ''should be sufficient''. Claim forms
will be sent out automatically to those who booked Villmar holidays.
The spokeswoman said: ''We go to great lengths to ensure that no-one's
holiday is spoiled.''
Mr Keith Betton, head of corporate affairs for the Association of
British Travel Agents (ABTA), said anyone who had booked a Villmar
holiday should contact their travel agent.
The company traded as Villmar Holidays, Shades, Fly N Fish, Sunshine
Flights and Golf Getaways and specialised in holidays to Greece and
Turkey. Villmar Travel Ltd also operated as an ABTA retail agent.
The Air Travel Organisers' Licensing Scheme, introduced in 1973, gives
comprehensive consumer protection to the 17,000,000 people in the UK who
take air holidays each year. The system protects them from losing their
money or being stranded abroad if their tour operator fails.
Before it gets a licence, the tour operator has to lodge a bond -- a
financial guarantee provided by a bank or insurance company.

<HEADLINE>No room at the law firm for unfairly sacked secretary</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976437547</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN expanding law firm that sacked a secretary after it ran out of
space has been ordered to pay her #9099 compensation for unfair
dismissal.
Mrs Mary Burnside, of Hume Drive, Uddingston, Glasgow, was employed by
Hennessey Bowie &amp; Co., of West Regent Street, Glasgow, as a legal
secretary from July, 1984, and prior to that had worked for Mr Alistair
Bowie in his own practice for 10 years.
In recent years Mrs Burnside and another secretary both worked
part-time in the mornings for Ms Barbara Watson, an associate of the
firm.
In January this year Hennessey Bowie &amp; Co. decided to hire a court
department assistant.
The industrial tribunal noted: ''This caused them a space problem
because they did not have accommodation for the court assistant and for
the secretarial assistance which she would require.
''In order to make room for the assistant they divided off part of the
typing room and then refurnished the typing room with smaller desks.
''Having done so they could not accommodate another desk for a
secretary for the new assistant.''
The law firm then decided the only solution to its problem was to get
the two existing part-time legal secretaries to cover the whole day
between them in such a way that they didn't overlap, leaving one of the
two workstations for the new secretary.
Various suggestions as to how this should be done proved unsuccessful
and on February 16 Mr Bowie dismissed Mrs Burnside.
In declaring the dismissal unfair the tribunal stated: ''At the end of
the hearing we had no difficulty in deciding that the reason for the
dismissal was the space problem.
''It seems to the tribunal that a number of other courses of action
should have been contemplated before any dismissal took place.''
The tribunal set a basic award of #1506 plus #7539, which represents
Mrs Burnside's net earnings up until December, 1996, when she would have
retired aged 60.

THE all-star ''instant'' charity album Help, recorded to raise funds
for victims of the war in Bosnia, has gone straight into the charts at
No. 1 after one day's sales.
The album, recorded within 24 hours, sets a virtually unbeatable
record for the fastest No. 1 long-player of all time.
Stars, including Suede, Blur, Oasis and ex-Beatle Paul McCartney,
recorded 20 tracks in studios around the country on Monday, and
producers, pressing companies and distributors worked flat-out to get it
into the shops for Saturday.
In a single day, 71,000 copies of the album, released on the Go! Discs
label, were snapped up.
Organisers initially hoped to raise #1.1m for the War Child charity
from the release, but Go! Discs managing director Andy Macdonald said
yesterday that the remarkable first-day response could mean even more
money coming in.
War Child was started by two cameramen shocked by what they saw in
Croatia, and is supported by former Roxy Music musician Brian Eno.

A TWIN-seated fighter aircraft, veteran of 12 combat missions in the
Gulf War, went on its final journey yesterday . . . at two-and-a-half
miles per hour.
The low-level strike aircraft gave traffic officer Jim Soutar, from
Elgin, Morayshire, the most unusual assignment of his career. He
supervised its road-trip from an RAF hangar to the forecourt of an Esso
service station.
The operation took three hours and the A941 main Lossiemouth to Elgin
road was closed during the manoeuvre.
Rather than place the aircraft on an RAF low-loader, it was decided to
tow it along the road at speeds of up to 8mph -- a big change from its
top speed of 600mph.
And because there was a risk, albeit remote, that the Buccaneer could
break away from its tow, the Scottish Office insisted that a pilot be on
board to steer the aircraft and apply the brakes, if necessary.
The fold-wing Buccaneer Mark III, with an extended span of 44ft, now
resides at the newly renamed Buccaneer Service Station at Bishopmill,
owned by Ian and Isa Aitkenhead.
Regarding the Scottish Office stipulation, Mr Aitkenhead said: ''My
son, John, joked that the Scottish Office were worried we might
bump-start it on the road.''
But the entire operation would have been cancelled if Mr Aitkenhead
failed to fulfil the condition, so he brought in a friend and former
Buccaneer pilot Ian Aitchison to sit at the controls for one more
mission.
Then, while the Buccaneer sat in an RAF hangar waiting to be taken to
its new home, Mr Aitkenhead spent months obtaining the appropriate
towing permissions from the police, BT, Hydro Electric and the Scottish
Office.
The very first Blackburn Buccaneer, built as a sea-fighter for
Britain's aircraft carriers, entered service in 1955.
That was the same year the former Bishopmill Service Station opened on
the A941.
1 Buccaneer XW 530 was dubbed Glemorangie, after the famous Highland
malt whisky, when it was flown into action during Operation Desert Storm
against Iraq in 1991.
The 63-foot aircraft carried state-of-the art laser devices which
allowed accompanying RAF Tornadoes to hit targets with pin-point
accuracy.
Mr Aitkenhead said he would follow advice from aircraft preservation
trusts and museums in covering the outer shell with a water-based matt
laquer and applying wax to the instrument panel and interior. The
engines and all other moving parts in the fuselage would be sprayed with
grease.
''We are determined to keep it as long as possible here and there will
be on-going maintenance costs,'' Mr Aitkenhead said. ''But, at the cost
of a few thousand pounds, I have a real talking point right here in the
forecourt in a part of Scotland with a continuing important flying
tradition.''

PROJECTS in Scotland will receive #10.5m of the first #66.5m awarded
in the first National Lottery grants towards millennium projects, it
will be confirmed today.
The bulk of the money the Millennium Commission is to contribute, just
under #10m, will go towards the creation of about 575 miles of new cycle
routes in Scotland which will stretch from the Borders to Glasgow,
Greenock, Edinburgh, Inverness, and Aberdeen.
The #10m is part of a grant of #42.5m awarded to Sustrans for the
creation of a UK-wide 2500-mile millennium cycle route, costing #183m,
which will extend from Dover to Inverness. It is expected to be
completed by the year 2000.
The biggest part of the funding for the route will come from local
authorities, voluntary support and donations, and national funding
programmes.
Beyond the millennium, Sustrans plans to produce a further 3000 miles
of cycleways to complete the national network.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, chairman of the Millennium Commission, has
described the Sustrans project as ''ambitious, visionary and exciting''.
The two other Scottish projects to benefit in the first lottery grants
towards millennium projects are in Wigtown and Aberdeenshire.
Wigtown District Council has been awarded #547,000 towards the cost of
a #1.43m project to develop Agnew Park in Stranraer town centre into a
''modern, high quality seafront amenity''. Mrs Bottomley said the
project would improve the quality of life for the people of Wigtown
district as well as the 1.7m visitors who pass through Stranraer each
year.
A small community group in the village of Insch, north-east of
Aberdeen, will receive #311,000 towards a #622,000 community centre. Mrs
Bottomley said she believed the project could become a ''flagship for
community centres nationwide''.
Meanwhile, an ambitious scheme to regenerate one of Scotland's
unemployment blackspots, which looks likely to attract #5m from future
Millennium Commission funding, has been unveiled.
After months of speculation the backers of the project have released
details of an innovative package of proposals which will cost more than
#14m and create up to 2000 jobs in the ''Three Towns'' of Ardrossan,
Saltcoats and Stevenston.
The Nobel Project -- named after Alfred Nobel, who created the British
Dynamite Company at Ardeer in 1870 -- aims to create a business park and
a new educational campus in assocation with Paisley University. There
will also be an annual award for scientific achievement aimed at young
people.
The centrepiece of the project will be a development aimed at bringing
visitors back to the area. The visitor attraction, known as the Big
Idea, will bring to life the inventions and discoveries of the
millennium as well as celebrating the lives and work of those who have
won Nobel Prizes over the past 100 years.
In what is being billed as ''an explosive day out for all the family''
visitors will be taken through the history of fire and explosions,
taking in the birth of Chinese rockets and the Napoleonic Wars and
meeting Alfred Nobel as he arrives at Ardeer from Sweden to set up his
new company.
The whole project is seen as essential to the regeneration of the
area, which has seen unemployment rise in recent years to more than 14%,
making it among the worst in Scotland.
The Millennium Commission is currently studying the batch of
applications from throughout the UK, a handful of them in Scotland,
which have progressed to the last stages.
Mr Cairns Campbell, chief executive of the local enterprise trust,
Asset, said: ''We are quietly confident of success in the application to
the Millennium Commission as the signs so far have been encouraging.

JOHN Cairncross, the infamous Fifth Man, is back in Britain after 40
years exile and has married an opera singer half his age, it was
reported yesterday.
Mr Cairncross, 82 and frail after two strokes, the last only a week
ago, is apparently living in the West Country while completing his
memoirs.
The former Whitehall mandarin was identified four years ago as the
Fifth Man by Colonel Yuri Modin, his former KGB controller.
The other four in the Cambridge spy ring were Sir Anthony Blunt, Kim
Philby, Guy Burgess, and Donald Maclean.
Scotsman Cairncross, who previously said he worked alone and did not
know the other four were spies, told the Mail on Sunday: ''There was a
hard core of three and Kim Philby was associated with them. Then there
was me who was a loner outside.''
He said he became one of The Five during the Second World War.
''I hope this will put an end to the Fifth Man mystery. I was promoted
to become one of The Five after the Battle of Kusk in 1943,'' he said.
''I had provided information which helped the Soviets to win that battle
against the Germans.''
Cairncross has always denied being a traitor, insisting he helped the
Russians by passing on secrets about Germany, the common enemy.
His book, provisionally called Memoirs of The Fifth Man, will be given
to the Ministry of Defence for clearance before publication next year,
said the newspaper.
It said Cairncross flew into Gatwick in March, and on Friday married
his long-time companion Gayle Brinkerhoff, a 39-year-old American.
The newspaper said that after working in Rome, and spending a year in
jail on currency smuggling charges, Cairncross lived in France.
His marriage came a week after the death of his estranged first wife
Gabriella, with whom he was negotiating a divorce.

THE trial is expected to begin today at Paisley Sheriff Court of the

Mr Stewart, 52, of Neilston, Renfrewshire, MP for Eastwood, faces a
breach of the peace charge arising from events at an M77 demonstration
in February.
In the wake of the incident he resigned his post as Scottish Industry
Minister, ''to save the Government embarrassment''.
He has denied by letter that he conducted himself in a disorderly
manner, brandished a pickaxe and committed a breach of the peace at
Pollok Castle Estate, Newton Mearns.
His son, Jack Stewart, then 17, and a friend, David Clow, 16, of
Scotstoun, Glasgow, have both denied charges arising from the same
incident.
Jack Stewart denied having a loaded air weapon without lawful
authority in public places. He also denied buying an air weapon while
under the age of 17, contrary to the Firearms Act.
David Clow denied the same charges, and trial for all three was set
for today.

<RECORDNO>976437555</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PUPILS at a Dundee primary school break a 300-year-old law every time
they wear their blazers.
Their school crest, designed by a parent when Grange Primary opened 20
years ago, contravenes the Lyon King of Arms Act of 1672.
The school could face prosecution if it fails to register the crest
with the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh.
The shield-shaped crest of Grange Primary, Monifieth, Dundee, features
two dolphins, castle ramparts and white roses.
But the school has recently discovered it faces a bill of #780 to
record the crest to comply with Scots laws which govern the use of
heraldic devices.
The school crest is emblazoned on blazer badges, letterheads,
sweatshirts and on signs in the school building itself.
Now Grange Primary is faced with the choice of paying to register the
crest or redesigning it.
Headteacher Eric Kidd explained: ''I believe that the pupils are
breaking the law every time they put on their school blazers.
''It does seem a bit harsh that this law could be imposed upon us.
''The news about the badge came totally out of the blue. We received a
letter from the education authorities informing us that this matter had
been raised with them.''
Mr Kidd added: ''I am very concerned at the amount of money we are
going to have to pay.''
Pupils at the school will be told about the problem with the crest
before a decision is made on how to solve the it.
Mr Kidd said: ''We have the choice either to pay the money or change
to a new school badge.
''It would cost a lot less to redesign a badge than to register the
existing one but there is also the inconvenience to consider.''
He added: ''We need to weigh up the pros and cons. The cost is
significant, but the badge has meaning and is important to the school.''
The Lyon Clerk in Edinburgh explained that all heraldic devices in
Scotland must be registered with the Court of the Lord Lyon.
While declining to discuss an invidual case, the Lyon Clerk said that
it would be up to the procurator-fiscal to decide to bring a case
against an individual or organisation.

<HEADLINE>Labour picks women candidates. Party's Ayr and Stirling choices are first from controversial all-female shortleets</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN SMITH</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE Labour Party put its controversial all-women shortleets policy
into action in Scotland yesterday, with members choosing opponents for
the Scottish Secretary and the MP for Ayr.
For the Labour Party the most crucial decision was taken in Stirling,
where the party hierarchy was desperate to ensure a top-quality
candidate was picked to take on Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Mr Forsyth had already attempted to rubbish the selection procedure,
claiming the Labour proposal of only allowing women to go forward for
the nomination stopped the best people from standing.
In the end, Stirling party members chose Mrs Anne McGuire to be the
prospective candidate by a large majority.
Mrs McGuire, who was unlucky not to have been the Labour candidate in
the Glasgow, Govan and Central by-elections, is regarded as a very
professional, and lucid, campaigner.
She is a former Labour Party chairman in Scotland, and is currently
deputy director of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations.
In Ayr, local Labour Party members chose South Ayrshire councillor
Sandra Osborne from an all-women shortleet, to be the prospective
parliamentary candidate to face Phil Gallie. The seat is regarded as
Labour's most winnable in Scotland since boundary changes removed some
Tory strongholds.
Ironically it was Mrs Osborne's husband Alastair who stood for Labour
at the last election, only losing by 85 votes to Mr Gallie.
He said after the selection meeting that he was delighted his wife had
won the nomination.
Stirling, however, will be the seat where Labour will put in the most
resources in an attempt to unseat Mr Forsyth who proved most political
commentators wrong by holding the seat by narrow margins at the past two
elections.
The party admits it has failed to match the Conservatives in
organisational terms in the past, and will put more resources into
telephone canvassing, direct mailing, and street canvassing.
Mrs McGuire is well known in the Labour Party, after being on the
executive for some 10 years. She has also been on the national executive
of her union, the GMB. Currently living in Cumbernauld, she is married
with two teenage children.
Curiously, although she won her nomination via the all-women shortleet
route, she has never been regarded as a particularly strong supporter of
the all-women policy, which may be ditched by Labour after the next
election.
Last night she said Mr Forsyth's comments about the all-women
shortleet were patronising and insulting. ''I don't think anyone would
regard me as a token woman,'' she said.
Labour's new candidate in Ayr, Mrs Osborne, 39, works for Kilmarnock
Women's Aid and is secretary of the Labour group on the new South
Ayrshire Council. She has also been a member of Kyle and Carrick
District Council for four years.
Asked how she will answer the inevitable attacks from Mr Gallie, that
Labour was unable to choose the best candidate to face him as half the
party members were excluded from the shortleet, Mrs Osborne said: ''When
Phil Gallie comes out with that, I would like to ask on what basis he
was selected. I don't feel the least bit defensive about Phil Gallie.
''I feel I have a very good record as a local councillor. On the South
Ayrshire Council I am responsible for housing and social work. I am sure
they wouldn't have put me in that position unless they thought I was
capable.''
Although Mr Gallie is regarded as the most vulnerable Tory MP in
Scotland, Mrs Osborne said they would not be taking anything for
granted.
Mrs Osborne was always regarded as a favourite to win the nomination
as it was felt that Labour members in Ayr were keen to field a local
candidate.
* Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson scored an
important victory at the weekend when Labour's Scottish executive backed
his plans for a Scottish Parliament to have 129 MPs.
The number of MPs had been a sticking point until Mr Robertson, and
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace, broke the deadlock by
jointly supporting 129.
When it came up for consideration at the executive on Saturday, only
six people voted against it, and it now becomes Labour policy. The
proposal will go before the executive of the all-party Scottish
Constitutional Convention, where support for 129 is also expected.

MORE than 100 people assembled at Glasgow's Sighthill cemetery
yesterday to pay homage to the radical martyrs of Scotland's 1820
Rising.
They gathered around the Martyrs' Memorial, the burial place of John
Baird and Andrew Hardie, executed for their part in the insurrection.
Among the guests speaking at the 175th annual commemoration was Booker
Prize winner James Kelman who attacked the ''disinformation'' about the
radicals, punished for trying to improve conditions of the ordinary
people who had no vote.
The 1820 Society was founded in 1969 by Mr John Murphy, from Paisley,
to publicise and commemorate the Scottish Radical Insurrection.
Mr Kelman said: ''The 1820 Rising is part of our history and I just
feel that it's worthwhile that we have access to our own history.''
A descendant of Alexander Johnston, one of the 19 Scottish radicals
shipped to Botany Bay for their part in the rising, Mrs Angela Lind,
arrived yesterday from Australia to lay a wreath at the Sighthill
memorial. Mrs Lind, a great grand-daughter of Johnston, travelled from
Sydney especially for the ceremony.

A TOTAL ban on GPs prescribing Scotland's most widely abused drug is

on the issue.
The Scottish Office yesterday dismissed speculation that the
Department of Health had bowed to manufacturers' pressure and caved in
on a commitment to remove Temazepam in its jelly form from NHS lists.
''The consultation process on the drug's removal only finished on
Friday,'' said a spokesman, ''and both the Department of Health and
ourselves remain committed to a ban. Ministers have yet to discuss the
issue, but that will take place in the immediate future.''
Scottish Office sources also said they fully expected a ban to come
into force in the coming months.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth will tomorrow unveil measures to
criminalise possession of the sleeping pill, commonly melted down with
heroin to provide a cocktail for injection, for the first time.
Temazepam will be reclassified as a schedule three drug carrying a
maximum two-year jail sentence for those caught in possession without a
prescription.
There has been intense pressure to have Temazepam ''jellies'' banned
because of the drug's popularity with youngsters in Scotland and the
horrific side effects of its misuse.
When injected the jelly can coagulate in the bloodstream leading to
gangrene and amputation. And the unpredictable results of mixing
Temazepam with heroin has led to a growing number of deaths.
Temazepam also has a growing popularity on the rave scene, where
youngsters take it to come down from ecstasy, and has been linked to
violence when taken in conjunction with alcohol.
Criminalisation is only seen as a preliminary step in removing the
drug from Scotland's streets. It is widely accepted that an NHS
prescription ban is needed to hit street supply and many experts are
looking for a total ban in the UK.
MP Irene Adams, whose Paisley North constituency has been in the front
line of the Temazepam trade, said she would be ''very surprised'' if an
NHS ban were not agreed. ''The leader of the House of Commons announced
two or three months ago that the drug would be banned,'' she said.
Mrs Adams, who is in favour of stronger measures than an NHS
prescription ban, said that vast bulk of Scotland's supplies were
leaking on to the streets from pharmaceutical wholesalers.
''On paper Britain is exporting more Temazepam than it is
manufacturing. The problem is anyone can set up as a wholesaler. They go
along to the DTI and ask for an export licence. It is granted but the
drugs never leave the country.''
She added that the costs of a replacement drug for prescriptions
should not be a factor in the decision on Temazepam's future. ''It is
about 14p for a tablet in jelly form. The next available drug is only
about 2p more.''
Mr Dave Liddell, director of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said a total
ban on the jelly form of the drug was needed to stop supply. ''Even if
it is taken off the NHS list the drug will still be available for
private prescription. Most of the stuff that is available on the streets
does not come from GPs. It takes the wholesale route from England.''

ONE young Scot has been killed and another seriously injured in a car
crash the day after they arrived for a holiday on Ibiza.
Last night Northern Constabulary confirmed that the dead man, who came
from Wick, Caithness, had been killed in the incident on Saturday. His
friend, who comes from Easter Ross, was seriously injured in the
collision, when their hire car left the road. A police spokesman in
Inverness said that the Spanish authorities had made a request, through
Interpol, for Northern Constabulary to contact relatives of the young
men, who are both believed to work in the North Sea oil industry.
The two men had arrived in Ibiza for the start of their holiday on
Friday.
Police said the names of the young men were being withheld until
relatives had been informed.

<HEADLINE>Dublin invites Trimble to talks. Hard line expected from the new unionist leader</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
THE Dublin Government has sought to give fresh impetus to the Irish
peace process by inviting the new Ulster Unionist leader, Mr David
Trimble, to talks.
The move, by Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dick
Spring, came shortly after Mr Trimble's surprise victory as successor to
Mr James Molyneaux, and may be followed by a similar invitation from US
President Bill Clinton. It provides hope that some way might be found
through the impasse caused by last week's cancellation of the Chequers
summit.
Mr Trimble, however, is widely regarded as a hardliner and he made
clear in a television interview yesterday that getting rid of some
weapons may not be enough for Sinn Fein to be admitted to all-party
talks on Ulster's future.
Prime Minister John Major is under intense pressure to keep the peace
process on track. He described the cancellation of last week's summit as
''a setback, but not a crisis'', but he will undoubtedly be concerned
that Mr Trimble's victory is likely to signal a tougher line by the
unionists.
The British Government is standing by its insistence that there must
be some evidence of decommissioning of weapons by the IRA, and officials
from London and Dublin remain in constant touch in a bid to come up with
a package to allow the peace process to edge forward.
Mr Spring's move involves Mr Trimble in high-level contact which may
help to clarify Dublin's position and find some way round the problem.
One report at the weekend suggested that Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
would have gone along with the idea of political talks starting while an
international commission considered the problem of disarmament, but the
IRA refused to give up a single weapon.
Mr Trimble said he was willing to meet the Dublin Government to put
forward the case of the unionists in Northern Ireland.
However, he has made clear that weapons should not be handed over
simply as a gesture, stating: ''It is not enough for people whose
intention still is to revert to the use of threat of violence as a lever
simply to make a gesture and think that lets them off the hook.''
On the BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme yesterday, Mr Trimble said
the IRA must realise that disbandment was part of the peace process.
Although it was not a precondition for all sides to take part in talks
on the future of Northern Ireland, private armies were not consistent
with a peace commitment, he said.
''This process is going to result in the disbandment of all
paramilitary organisations and private armies, because people cannot say
they are committed to exclusively peaceful methods and still have a
private army at their back. Not a private army that is as active as the
IRA is, because there is good reason to believe the IRA committed one
murder in Belfast this week.''
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew has given his backing to
the setting up of an international commission to advise the governments
on the subject of how a scheme for decommissioning terrorist arms could
best be devised and implemented.
In a speech to the British-Irish Association conference in Cambridge,
Sir Patrick said there was some competition as to who should be
recognised as the author and sole progenitor of this idea but added:
''No matter, it is a good one.
''It is not necessary that arms should be disposed of to us or to the
Irish. It is enough that they should be verifiably disposed of somehow
so that they cannot be used again.''
A report in the Observer, meanwhile, that Sir Patrick will quit if it
is felt he has exhausted the trust and goodwill needed to keep the peace
process going, was dismissed yesterday. A spokesman for the Northern
Ireland Office said: ''It is complete fiction.''
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams flies to America today for talks with
the Clinton administration.
Mr Adams will meet President Clinton's national security adviser, Mr
Anthony Lake, in an effort to get the US to put pressure on Mr Major to
drop his demand for arms decommissioning in advance of all-party talks.
He is also planning a series of meetings on Capitol Hill with
Republican and Democratic congressmen. Mr Martin McGuinness, the party's
deputy leader, has been on his first visit to the US for the past week
laying the groundwork with a series of media interviews and meetings.
* A woman was recovering yesterday after being beaten up in her
Belfast home by men claiming to be from the IRA.
Three masked men took over the woman's house off the Old Park Road in
the west of the city late on Saturday night, said the RUC. While her
husband and three young children were held in an upstairs room two of
the men took the woman into the living room where they punched and beat
her about the face and body.
The attack bore all the hallmarks of an IRA punishment squad beating.
An Orange Hall in south Belfast was extensively damaged early
yesterday in an arson attack. The IRA faces official blame for a series
of fires at halls belonging to the Protestant order.

A COUNCIL employee sacked after a door thrown from a multi-storey
block missed a tenant by inches has won his unfair dismissal claim.
An industrial tribunal awarded the driver/labourer #7217 and ordered
he should get his job back.
Mr Thomas Halpin, of Craigielea Road, Duntocher, Clydebank, was sacked
last September by Glasgow District Council's building and works
department.
The industrial tribunal heard that, on September 16, 1994, Mr Halpin
and Mr James Wilson were clearing a council house. .
A door which was thrown from a veranda towards their truck narrowly
missed hitting a tenant.
The tribunal noted: ''He looked up and saw two men looking over a
veranda.
''At no time did he suggest that he knew who the two men on the
veranda were and that there was nothing in what he said to link the two
men with the throwing of the door.''
At a disciplinary meeting manager Gordon Smith dismissed Mr Halpin
after concluding that he and Mr Wilson had thrown the door.
The tribunal stated: ''Mr Smith had no reasonable ground upon which to
sustain the belief that Mr Halpin had been party to the door being
thrown over the balcony.
''Mr Halpin's version had always been -- and in this he was supported
by Mr Wilson -- while he was on his way down, and before he got there,
Mr Wilson threw the door.''

Belfast in protest at RUC rerouting of an Orange parade away from the
nationalist Lower Ormeau Road. Protesters confronted the police and
staged a demonstration for several hours. In Bessbrook, County Armagh, a

POLICE found a body in undergrowth yesterday while searching for an
18-year-old girl who has been missing from her Norfolk home for five
days.
The body was discovered yesterday afternoon by search teams near RAF
Coltishall. It has not been identified.
Rachel Lean disappeared on Tuesday between the RAF station and the
family home two miles away in Buxton, near Aylsham.
Her mother Vanessa contacted police on Tuesday evening when she failed
to turn up for dinner after leaving the Naafi shop at RAF Coltishall.
Rachel's father Peter, an RAF engineer helping Nato missions over
Bosnia, left his base in northern Italy on Thursday to return to Britain
and join the search.
Mr and Mrs Lean, who also have a 17-year-old son Steven, are divorced
but the family maintain close links.
Mrs Lean lives a couple of miles away, while the children live with
their father.
Family and friends said Rachel's A-level exam results were very good
and she was looking forward to starting an English degree at university
in Southampton.
Home Office pathologist Dr David Harrison is expected to carry out a
post-mortem examination on the body today.

A PLUMBER and two emergency workers are dead after a rescue from a
farmyard well turned into a disaster.
A fireman and an ambulanceman were killed after going underground on a
remote farm near Ballymoney, Country Antrim, on Saturday to help a
plumber who had become trapped in the well after taking ill.
They are believed to have been overcome by fumes and died in hospital
just hours later.
The plumber died in hospital last night.
An investigation into the tragedy has been mounted but post-mortem
examination results on the two emergency workers have not been released.
The men were: ambulanceman Francis Barr, 56, and part-time fireman
Robert Neill, 39, both from Ballymoney.
Police have not released the plumber's name.
The well is understood to be the main water supply to the farm and the
plumber was called in to carry out work after water levels fell.
After taking ill, the plumber tried to climb up a ladder but fell back
and became trapped.
Fireman Robert Neill was lowered into the well to help the plumber but
he too got into difficulties.
Mr Barr went down next but was quickly overcome by fumes.
It took rescuers an hour to get the men to the surface for emergency
treatment.
The seriously ill men were taken to hospital but Mr Neill and Mr Barr
died a short time later.
Local RUC divisional commander Gerry Davidson praised the courage and
heroism of the dead rescuers and expressed his sympathy to their
families.

THE show of trade union unity over introduction of a national minimum
wage was shattered yesterday.
On the eve of Congress, which opens in Brighton today, leaders of the
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union revived fears they would
press for the restoration of differentials where they are eroded.
While welcoming Saturday's agreement by the Fire Brigades Union and
construction union Ucatt to give in to pressure and withdraw amendments
seeking to insert a figure of #4.15 an hour, the AEEU leaders reopened
old wounds over differentials.
Acting AEEU president Nigel Harris, who is also a member of the Labour
Party executive, stressed that dustmen should not expect to receive the
same as his members with many years of experience fitting jumbo jet
engines.
Acting AEEU general secretary Ken Jackson supported this line, saying
that it would be Britain's skilled men and women who will lead the
nation out of recession and they have to have their contribution valued
and rewarded.
As if this was not enough to trouble the leaders of both the TUC and
the Labour Party, Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and
General Workers, the largest party affiliate, said he was ''happy'''with
#4.15 an hour and would endorse it with the TGWU block vote if it
appeared on any agenda.
Several other major unions, including Unison, feel equally bound by
their own union policy conference decisions to suggest that a
''victory'' for TUC leaders in suppressing #4.15 may not necessarily
mean Labour leader Tony Blair can count on doing the same.
Several constituency Labour parties have motions including #4.15 per
hour on the agenda for the party conference in Brighton in three weeks
and it is unlikely they could be put under such intense pressure as
forced the FBU and Ucatt to back off on the same issue.
The two would-be rebel unions were left isolated by the bigger unions
who were content to go along with the TUC line of retaining the formula
of half male median earnings while not putting a figure on it at this
stage.
Within the TUC there is argument over just how much the formula
justifies with estimates varying between #3.63 and #4.15. Fresh
statistics due out next week are expected to spark more controversy by
pushing the higher calculation to nearer #4.40 a hour.
Welcoming the accommodation reached with the FBU and Ucatt, TUC
general secretary John Monks said it would avoid splitting congress and
allow further time to evaluate the formula.
He reiterated that the TUC would agree a target figure before too
long, certainly before the next election.
Although Mr Blair is known to have been in touch recently with FBU
general secretary Ken Cameron over this issue, Mr Monks denied the
Labour leader's fingerprints were on the final non-controversial
composite motion on the national minimum wage to go before congress on
Wednesday.
Mr Cameron, however, accused the Labour leader of wanting to have it
both ways -- seeking to distance himself from the trades unions while at
the same time interfering with the TUC agenda.
The key composite phrase, which mimics Blair's line, stresses:
''Congress recognises that a Labour government will have the
responsibility of fixing the level of the national minimum wage in the
light of all the economic circumstances prevailing at the time,
following consultations with the social partners.''
Meanwhile, the TGWU and the General Municipal and Boilermakers are
proceeding with their industrial campaigns to win at least #4 an hour
for their low paid members in this year's wage negotiations.

<HEADLINE>Forsyth in the hot seat with boundary changes. Boundary changes will test Forsyth</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth will be facing a harder battle to
retain his Stirling parliamentary seat following boundary changes,
although Mr Major can look forward to a statistical boost.
A detailed survey of the changes, based on votes cast at the last
General Election, shows Mr Forysth's margin would have been reduced to
just 236 -- his actual majority is 703 -- had the boundary moves been in
place in 1992.
The survey takes account of regional election results from 1994, but
clearly cannot take account of current public opinion or shifts in
political support in the run-up to the General Election. Either way, Mr
Forsyth clearly is in for a struggle to hold on to a seat which he has
twice been expected to lose.
A total of 494 out of 659 constituencies will be fought on new
boundaries at the next election.
Again, extrapolating the figures based on 1992 voting patterns and
adding in local results, Mr Major's chances of holding on to power are
boosted by up to seven parliamentary seats.
It was also good news for Scottish Office Minister of State Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, who gave up a claim to a Lords seat to help defend the
Government's Commons majority. He is calculated to have improved his
Edinburgh West lead from 879 to 4291.
However, the study indicates that in Scotland Labour would have picked
up one extra seat, making 50, the Tories would have stayed on 11, with
the Liberal Democrats down one to eight and the SNP on three.
The Ayr constituency, held by Tory Phil Gallie with an 85-vote
majority, would have gone Labour, with an 1895 turnaround. But the party
would have been compensated by a big turnaround in Gordon, where the
274-vote lead of Liberal Democrat Malcolm Bruce would be replaced by an
8486 Conservative one.
Other changes in Grampian would have given Labour the extra seat
allocated in Aberdeen, but with the Tories strengthening their hold on
Aberdeen South, currently held by Scottish Office Minister Raymond
Robertson with a majority of 1517.
Labour loses a Glasgow seat, but changes at Strathkelvin and Bearsden,
represented by former brain surgeon Sam Galbraith, look like
transforming it from a marginal to a safe seat.
As well as losing out in Gordon, the Liberal Democrats also see
Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale reduced to a marginal, their
difficulties compounded by the fact that former Liberal leader Sir David
Steel is retiring as MP.
The party's margin in the new seat of Inverness East, Nairn and
Lochaber is still close at 736, compared with the 458 won in the
existing seat by Sir Russell Johnston, who also is standing down. This
sets the scene for a fascinating three-cornered fight involving the Lib
Dems, the Tories and the SNP.
SNP leader Alex Salmond sees his Banff and Buchan margin over the
Tories boosted by more than 2000, but at Angus, the present Angus East
MP Andrew Welsh has his cut from 954 to 473.
The survey, commissioned by the Press Association, the BBC, ITN and
Sky News, is the first independent, large-scale study of the effect of
the boundary changes, and coincides with indications that the Tories
have started to haul back Labour's impressive opinion poll lead.
A Gallup poll published on Friday showed Labour's lead down from 35
points in late July to 28 points now, following Mr Major's clear victory
in the Tory leadership challenge and persistent internal sniping at Mr
Tony Blair's Labour leadership.
The survey concludes that if the boundary alterations had been in
effect at the last election, the Commons line up would have been:
Conservatives 343 -- up seven; Labour 273 -- up two; Liberal Democrats
18 -- down two; United Ulster Unionsts nine; Democratic Unionists four
-- up one; Plaid Cymru four; SDLP four; and SNP three. The Tories'
overall majority would have gone up from 21 to 27.
The survey, conducted by Dr Colin Rallings and Dr Michael Thrasher at
the University of Plymouth, also shows how the new boundaries affect the
chances of a switch of power.
Opposition parties would now need a swing of 0.7% to deprive the
Tories of their overall majority, compared with 0.5% under the old
line-up. If the movement was only to Labour, the figure would be just
under 0.8%, compared with 0.5%.
To gain an overall majority, Labour would need a 4.1% switch from
other parties, or 4.3% from the Conservatives alone. Both these figures
are slightly higher than before. For a 50-plus majority, Labour would
need a swing of just above 7%.
Although the Tories do best on balance, Labour is said to be well
pleased with the outcome of the four-year boundary review, and clearly
in the current atmosphere is well placed to cast doubt on some of the
conclusions.
Initial forecasts were that the Tories would benefit by up to 20
seats, with part of the battle concentrating on the so-called
''sandwich'' effect: splitting a Labour-dominated urban area in two and
sandwiching the halves between rural Tory areas.
Another controversy over the changes involves Tory MPs who have left
their seats for allegedly safer ones: they have been accused of
indulging in a ''chicken run''.
Parliament has approved the boundary commissioners' proposals for
England, Wales, and Scotland, and they will come into force at the next
General Election. Only by-elections before then will be fought on
existing boundaries.

BRITAIN and Ireland's amateurs turned what had been dubbed the
''Walkover Cup'' on its head with a stunning Walker Cup victory at
rain-lashed Royal Porthcawl yesterday.
Two years after suffering a record 19-5 defeat in Minnesota -- their
30th defeat in 34 matches -- Clive Brown's side romped to a 14-10 win.
''It's the best moment of my life,'' said 20-year-old Scot Stephen
Gallacher, whose uncle Bernard will be hoping to express similar
sentiments in the Ryder Cup in a fortnight.
Dublin undertaker Jody Fanagan, the only man to win all his games,
said: ''There was a lot of pressure on us because of the result two
years ago. It's been called the Walkover Cup, but it's no longer a
walkover.''
The margin was the widest of their four rare victories in a series
which dates back to 1922, the other successes coming at St Andrews in
1938 and 1971 by three and two points and at Peachtree, Georgia, in 1989
by a single point.
Needing 3[1/2] points from the eight concluding singles, Britain and
Ireland won the first four games -- making American captain Downing Gray
pay dearly for his risky decision to put stars Tiger Woods and John
Harris out last.
British champion Gordon Sherry birdied the last two holes to beat
Chris Riley, calling his eight-foot putt on the long 17th ''the most
important I've ever made''.
Gallacher then made an eight-footer on the 16th to close out Trip
Kuehne three and two and, with Fanagan three up with three to play on
Jerry Courville, the putt which won the cup was holed from six feet by
Swindon's David Howell to see off American Indian Notah Begay two and
one.
Gray said: ''Great Britain and Ireland earned it. It was a wonderful
exhibition of amateur golf at its finest.''

A UNITED States warship last night opened fire on the Bosnian Serbs
with the latest cruise missiles, using satellites to pinpoint their
targets.
The bosnian serbs said many were killed in the waves of attacks, and
there were many others wounded and trapped under the rubble of destroyed
buildings.
It was an explosive end to a short pause in Nato attacks to allow
talks between UN and Serb commanders, including General Ratko Mladic.
The Tomahawk missiles from the USS Normandy were sent in sequence
against anti-aircraft installations near the Serb stronghold of Banja
Luka in northern Bosnia.
''It was time to take out those air defences in north-west Bosnia.
They were dangerous to us,'' said Captain Jim Mitchell, spokesman for
Nato southern command in Naples.
The US Navy said the Tomahawks were recently improved. Called Block 3,
they are more accurate than those used in the Gulf war. Their navigation
system is enhanced by use of what is known as the Global Positioning
System, a satellite-linked means of pinpointing locations. The new
Tomahawks carry a 700-pound high-explosive warhead.
The all-weather, ground-hugging missiles lit up the sky as they sped
towards their targets.
Nato has consistently targeted the Serbs' integrated air defence
system. Nato officials say the systems tracking and targeting radar and
surface-to-air missiles pose a formidable threat to their pilots.
Nato denied that the use of the missiles represented an escalation in
its air campaign. But its pilots may feel more comfortable if radar and
missiles which brought down a US F-16 in June are out of action.
According to CNN, FA-15 jets, carrying 2000-pound ''smart bombs,''
were also launched from the US aircraft carrier Roosevelt minutes after
the missiles were fired.
Bosnian Serb government officials expressed incredulity and outrage
that cruise missiles had been fired moments after UN and Serb military
commanders ended talks.
''I think this does represent an escalation. I just can't imagine what
is on the minds of the people who fired these,'' a senior government
source said.
It was equally hard to believe, he said, in the light of Friday's
Geneva negotiations which yielded a tentative framework for peace.
French President Jacques Chirac had earlier intervened, saying he had
secured a brief pause in Nato air strikes to permit talks on Bosnian
Serb promises to lift the siege of Sarajevo.
''Raids will stop for a few hours at my request,'' Mr Chirac told
French television.
There appeared to be a gap of about four hours between the last
reported air raid, and the cruise missile strikes at Banja Luka.
Mr Chirac said the pause was for General Mladic to meet General
Janvier to work out how to comply with UN demands to withdraw heavy
weapons and lift the ground and air siege of Sarajevo.
Bosnian Serb authorities earlier indicated readiness to lift the
blockade and discuss a ceasefire, but said they would not withdraw big
guns they claim vital to protect Serb-held areas.
Mr Chirac said attacks would resume if the Serbs did not move.
Mr Chirac had contacted Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on
Saturday.
Nato had launched the air and artillery campaign on August 30 after a
mortar attack on Sarajevo killed 37 people. It halted the strikes last
weekend but the Serbs did not take the opportunity to comply with the UN
ultimatums.
Nato aircraft, meanwhile, were out in force earlier yesterday.
In Tuzla, a UN-declared safe area and government-held city in the
north of Bosnia, Nato jets struck back at Bosnian Serb artillery
positions which shelled the UN-run airport.
The shelling followed a Bosnian government army offensive against
Bosnian Serb forces on the strategic Mount Ozren nearby, an attack sure
to raise questions about government promises not to take advantage of
Nato protection to attack from safe areas.
Russia has already condemned the ferocity and breadth of the Nato air
attacks against its traditional Slav and Orthodox Serb allies.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who met General Mladic
and Mr Milosevic in Belgrade on Saturday, and said yesterday that the
general had told him his men were ready to lift the blockade of Sarajevo
if Nato stopped its raids.
But they would not withdraw heavy weapons they felt were essential to
protect Serb-held areas of the city.
UN peacekeepers said yesterday the Serbs were moving heavy weapons
deployed in the zone but saw no sign of a withdrawal. Therefore the
''air operations continue''.
The Bosnian Serbs are capitalising on what they say are civilian
casualties from the air strikes.
Bosnian Serb television gave extensive coverage yesterday to what it
said were the deaths of a young brother and sister whose car was hit in
a Nato attack on a road north of Sarajevo late on Saturday night. Three
others were injured.
UN officials were keen to get permission to inspect a Bosnian Serb
hospital just outside Sarajevo where it was claimed 10 people were
killed when UN Rapid Reaction Force artillery fired on the area on
Friday.
