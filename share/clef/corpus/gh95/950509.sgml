MIKE Atherton fired a warning to the newly arrived West Indies with
his fourth century of the season as Lancashire beat Durham by eight
wickets in the Britannic Assurance Championship at Old Trafford
yesterday.
The England captain's unbeaten 155 off 265 balls eased the home side
to the target of 312 after Glen Chapple had polished off the Durham
innings with the first ball of the morning.
Atherton and Jason Gallian (43) put on 94 for the first wicket,
followed by a glorious 179 in 32 overs with John Crawley, who scored 81
from 93 deliveries.
Former England paceman Gladstone Small made up for the absence of
Allan Donald and Dermot Reeve by taking five for 71 as champions
Warwickshire beat Surrey by 91 runs at Edgbaston.
Elsewhere, it was a good day for spin, as Peter Such helped Essex beat
Worcestershire by 208 runs at Chelmsford qith six for 94.
Left-arm spinners Jimmy Hindson and Andy Afford both picked up four
wickets as Nottinghamshire beat Derbyshire by 114 runs at Trent Bridge.
Former England off-spinner Eddie Hemmings grabbed four for 63 and
left-arm paceman Jason Lewry three for 54 as Sussex secured a 75-run win
over Kent at Hove.
Northamptonshire all-rounder David Capel produced a burst of three
wickets in four balls but it was not enough to stop Glamorgan completing
a three-wicket victory at Cardiff.
Gloucestershire's 19-year-old Australian Andrew Symonds blasted his
second championship century to earn a draw with Somerset at Taunton.
County results:

POLICE last night appealed to campers for help in their search for the
killer of Mr Robert Higgins, of Dalmeny, whose body was found near a
quarry at Kirkliston last Monday. A Lothian and Borders police spokesman
said people camping on an old pitch and putt course near the murder
scene may have vital information. The driver of a red Renault car parked
near the site early on Saturday morning is also asked to come forward.

EIGHT months after the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland, a new sense
of concern is creeping in. The euphoric images of those early days of
peace are giving way to the grim reality of old-style street rioting and
sectarian confrontations, with the Royal Ulster Constabulary under
attack from both sides.
Today sees another remarkable step in the peace process -- the meeting
of a Sinn Fein delegation, led by a man reported to be a former IRA
chief of staff, Martin McGuinness, and a Government Minister,
Scottish-born Michael Ancram. But whatever optimism surrounds their
encounter must be more than tempered by the troublesome events of the
past week and fears of more to follow in the weeks ahead.
An ugly mood that still lies close to the surface of Ulster was
revealed to the outside world in the violence which coincided with Prime
Minister John Major's visit to Londonderry last Wednesday.
Since then, police have faced a series of potentially explosive
problems on the streets of Belfast as hard-liners on each side put down
markers to show their respective political clout.
When the IRA decided on its ceasefire, an obvious issue faced its
leadership. Without violence, what was the role of volunteers,
activists, and political supporters? The answer is now evident. Certain
types of terror continues as the IRA tries to enforce its will on
Catholic districts where it was most active. The result has been a wave
of punishment beatings and the kind of intimidatory tactics often
associated with underworld gangs in inner cities.
Despite appeals to Sinn Fein, from Catholic churchmen, the Irish
Government and other moderate nationalist voices, to cease such
activity, there is no sign of this happening. To add to such concern,
Sinn Fein's supporters are taking to the streets more regularly, raising
the danger of more violent confrontations with the RUC such as occurred
in Londonderry.
As if that were not enough for police to handle, loyalists, too, are
flexing their muscles again. Last Thursday night's rioting and looting
in Protestant East Belfast has led to more tension and other sporadic
attacks on police. Some Protestant community leaders claim the loyalist
discontent has much to do with the authorities' handling of parades, in
particular recent decisions to reroute marches away from flashpoint
neighbourhoods.
The issue of parades has long been a thorny one. It seems that for as
long as there have been Protestants and Catholics in Ulster, parades
have led to sectarian trouble. Old newspaper files, dating back beyond
Victorian times, chronicle such incidents; through decade after decade,
and still they occur.
The latest flashpoint is Belfast's Ormeau Road, one of several main
routes which spread out from the centre of the city like spokes on a
wheel. Until the early 1970s and the sectarian terror which engulfed
Belfast, this busy two-mile road, which heads south-east from the city
centre, was flanked by mainly Protestant homes and businesses. Only a
tiny enclave of Catholic streets existed near the city end but the past
20 years have seen these extended, as inner-city Protestants left for
more peaceful neighbourhoods. Today, the Catholic population spreads
half-way along the road, towards the Ormeau Bridge, straddling the River
Lagan.
Beyond the bridge at the Protestant end of the Ormeau Road, stands
Ballynafeigh Orange Hall. The hall has been the gathering place and
starting point for generations of Orangemen, setting out to march
unhindered into Belfast via the bridge. From Easter to late August such
occasions can be numerous; for example, to Sunday church services, or on
summer evening band parades, or on July 12 to join tens of thousands of
other Orangemen for the annual major demonstration through Belfast.
Suddenly, however, what the Ormeau Orangemen have always regarded as
their God-given right, has gone. On each of three marches since Easter,
the bridge has proved as far as they have been allowed to go before
encountering a phalanx of police vehicles barring their way.
Whether the Orangemen will ever again march down the full length of
the Ormeau Road is doubtful. On each occasion that they now choose to do
so, a body of Catholic residents and Sinn Fein activists calling
themselves Lower Ormeau Residents Group has appealed successfully to the
police to bar the march, and also threatened to block the road if they
did not. Faced with the prospect of a sectarian clash and a major breach
of the peace, the RUC has angered the local Orangemen by deciding on
rerouting.
Though small numbers of people are involved on either side in this
parochial dispute, the police handling of the Ormeau parades has a much
wider connotation and is being watched closely by Protestants and
Catholics across Ulster. On the loyalist side there appears a hardening
of attitudes against any further moves to restrict marches along
traditional routes.
Among Sinn Fein supporters, there seems a militant determination to
force the issue elsewhere where such marches pass through or near
Catholic neighbourhoods, towns or villages. Like the Orange Order, Sinn
Fein also wants no restrictions on its protests and parades but last
Sunday a republican parade was rerouted after police feared a clash with
protesters in a small Protestant enclave of West Belfast.
When Martin McGuinness meets Michael Ancram at Stormont today, he will
almost certainly spell out Sinn Fein's demand for the disbandment of the
RUC. Central to that aim is his party's tactic of mounting more and more
public protests, from sit-downs to parades. The RUC believes these
tactics risk more clashes with the police, as happened in Londonderry
last week, or will provoke counter-protests from loyalists, as in West
Belfast last Sunday.
All this adds a further headache for the police just at a time when
they are attempting to pursue a new image without flak-jackets and the
heavy weaponry which was necessary before peace broke out. The police
would also like to dispense with their armour-plated patrol vehicles,
but the onset of street riots sets back any such move towards normality.
At best, constables are now seen tunic-less on sunny days but still with
a standard issue hand-gun strapped in its black leather holster.
On Sunday last, an officer, attacked in the mainly Catholic village of
Coalisland, had to fire a warning shot to scare off his assailants. Thus
it seems that days of true normality remain far off for the RUC, facing
a summer of tension and trouble surrounding Orange parades and Sinn Fein
street protests. The worst may be over for Northern Ireland, as far as
terrorism is concerned, but the battle for a true and lasting peace has
yet to be won.

WINSTON CHURCHILL, the Right Honourable Member for Davyhulme, would do
well to take a leaf from Janey Buchan's book. Or perhaps that should be
books, because they rise in piles around the house of the former Euro-MP
for Glasgow, who retired last year.
There are thousands, on subjects from socialism to sex. A photographer
took her picture recently sitting beside a towering bookshelf when she
shouted ''Halt''. ''I was sitting between Marx's Das Kapital and Alex
Comfort's The Joy of Sex,'' she laughs.
Mr Churchill bridled at suggestions that he donate his grandfather's
papers to the nation; instead, he graciously accepted #13m, and retained
copyright. Janey Buchan will receive only heartfelt thanks when she
hands over a major part of the collection gathered over 50 years by her
and late husband Norman.
The grateful recipient will be Glasgow Caledonian University, which
between now and a ceremony of thanks in October will be carting
cardboard boxes of books from Buchan's West End home to its own shelves.
Professor Jo Haythornthwaite is the academic in charge of the flitting,
and already a decade's worth of Hansard's record of parliamentary
proceedings are at their new home.
Other university libraries will not want. Paisley has plugged a gap
with six volumes of Hansard from 1984-89 and Aberdeen will receive books
to complement a new department on the culture of the North-east. The
Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh has laid claim to rare volumes and
periodicals, one American civil rights group will recieve books on the
death penalty, while the printed fruits of Buchan's life-long fight for
South Africa will be sent back home.
Selling the books was suggested by Norman as a means of support should
she be broke after his death, but it is not a necessity, nor even an
option. ''I think it's my Calvinist Scottish upbringing that makes
selling something of such worth so abhorrent, which is why I detest what
Winston Churchill has done. Karl Popper has also had his library sold.
It's going to have grave repercussions.
''County archivists for England and Wales go back to Tudor times, and
they say they are terrified that this sort of thing has opened the
floodgates and they can't see how they can stop, in court, someone
saying these books belong to my great great grandfather.''
Since retiring as Glasgow MEP last year, Janey Buchan has wondered
what to do with the books and was keen to assist a fledgling university.
So when Liam Kane, chief executive of Caledonian Newspapers, was invited
on to the court of Glasgow Caledonian University she contacted him and
the idea was launched. Yet there is no air of a spring clean in her
sprawling flat.
Today it is like one giant book box waiting to be topped-up. There are
a few gaps along the hall and between the sofas, but everywhere else is
books, books, and books. They rise like print cliffs, and Janey wanders
among them to browse and sort. ''One thing this isn't, is a collection.
It's a midden, a guddle, but there is a lot of worth here.
''I'm certainly not going to be sitting around in floods of tears when
they go. I will be genuinely pleased that somewhere, someday, someone
will be picking up and working on things that we had hoped we would work
on. Norman and I would have liked to have worked on an encyclopedia of
political song and I hope that maybe we will be able to find the money
to get Caledonian a centre for the political song.''
As well as the extensive copies of titles from the Left Book Club and
A Worker's Library, there are dozens of books on folk and political
songs. As she points them all out on the high shelves of a spare room,
titles like Greig Duncan's Folk Song Collection and John Ord's Bothy
Songs and Ballads, she sings: After the strike was over, after the scabs
went home. ''That was written in America 1880 to the tune of After The
Ball Is Over.''
Buchan, 69, remains a staunch supporter of press freedom and continues
to hold Rupert Murdoch in withering contempt. She is donating a large
number of media books to Caledonian University. ''There is the freedom
of the press, but is it our freedom or Rupert Murdoch's freedom? We were
trying to persuade the Labour Party we needed to go at him. But I don't
think we have the courage to take him on.''
Buchan also believes in government subsidy and is not impressed by the
tokenism of other people's actions. The decision in October by the
rector of St Andrews University, Donald Findlay QC, to appeal to local
businessmen to donate #25 by purchasing a ''text-book'' annoyed her.
She has no time for CD-roms and computers and believes nothing will
replace ''the sensual pleasure of a good book''. She is dismayed how
people read so little now, and finds it curious that her careful reading
of seven daily newspapers is uncommon and not mandatory among public
figures. The love of all literature was instilled in her by her father,
a bus conductor, who always had six pence for a Penguin paperback.
The first gift she received from Norman at the beginning of their 45
years together was a book about Latin America entitled How Broad And
Alien Is The World. And difficult times were always more bearable with a
book. ''When Norman was sacked by Neil Kinnock I sent a friend to the
flat in London with a book -- it was Robert Hughes's Distant Shores.
Phoning him that night he said it was just what he needed.''
Since her retirement last year she has enjoyed more time to read but
still takes a book to the butchers. ''The butcher laughs, but life's
just too short.'' While the sorting and logging continues she can lose
herself in a pile, browsing from book to book. ''When you're on your own
it's a great comfort to you. The world of books is a friendlier world to
me than the world of politics.''
The two are now on different shelves, as political books become the
remit of academics while politicians prefer the soundbite or brief
printed quote. ''It is appalling, and we in the Labour Party would be
well advised to give ourselves a right bloody shake. We are either about
ideas or we are about nothing. You can't put ideas out in a soundbite.''
Later, with pride, she shows the books that will not be handed on. The
big red copies of the Dictionary of Labour Biographies. Looking at the
life of Charlie Richard, radical journalist and freethinker, she sighs
and says: ''Those were the days when politicians wrote books, or at
least read them.''

THE news from the Court of Session yesterday that Lord Kirkwood had
granted Highland Regional Council an interdict preventing the withdrawal
of overnight rail services from Fort William without proper
consultation, was greeted with genuine joy throughout the Highlands and
Islands.
Within the council, the decision was seen as a victory, no matter that
it could still be overturned on appeal. A victory had been won in
defence of the Highland transport system, and there are few issues held
so dearly.
It was seen as a victory for common sense; in the first place against
the officially created confusion embodied in the 1993 Railway Act.
According to the vice-convener of Highland Regional Council, Peter
Peacock, last month this had produced the Pontius Pilate approach to
government.
''You go to the British Railways Board and they wash their hands of
responsibility and tell you to go to the Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising; you go to Opraf and they tell you to go to the Rail
Regulator; you go to the Rail Regulator and he tells you to go to the
Department of Transport, and of course the last person who is going to
accept any responsibility is Dr Brian Mawhinney.''
This mess completely blurred democratic lines of responsibility, never
better illustrated than last autumn when Highland's elected convener,
Duncan McPherson, wrote to the elected Dr Mawhinney requesting a
meeting.
Dr Mawhinney did not acknowledge the request for weeks and when
representations were made in December it emerged that Dr Mawhinney had
passed the letter over to the non-elected franchise director, Roger
Salmon. Mr Salmon finally told Mr McPherson he saw no point in a meeting
with him, which, of course, Mr McPherson had not requested in the first
place.
It was also common sense that there couldn't be proper consultation
once the service had been withdrawn. Everybody saw that, from Mr Peacock
to the chairman of the Rail Users Consultative Committee for Scotland,
Lawrence Kemp, who likened it to signing a permission form after an
operation.
In addition, it was hardly likely that legislation safeguarding the
public interest would be satisfied with the device of running a few
ghost trains. As Mr McPherson said yesterday, the whole rail network
could be effectively closed without the statutory consultations simply
by running a few meaningless trains in the dead of night.
Common sense further dictated that if the service was being withdrawn
on the grounds of cost, and the bulk of these costs (those levied by
Railtrack) remained, then the services that survived would have to bear
the additional burden. It would then only be a matter of time before the
same cost arguments would be deployed against these services.
The fact that the Government and the British Railways Board were using
figures which set public subsidies for the Fort William service at six
and seven times the independent estimates has served only to harden
these suspicions.
Highland worries are, however, not over. ScotRail either has to get
#2.5m more to run the Fort William sleeper or it will have to cut
services elsewhere.
ScotRail's finance director, Alex Lynch, said yesterday that because
of Strathclyde's protected position, this would mean looking at the
commuter services in and around Edinburgh and Fife plus the rural
routes.
The chances are that he is not thinking of the Stranraer line in the
latter category, but rather the three Highland lines: Glasgow to Fort
William/Mallaig; Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh; and Inverness to
Wick/Thurso.
The far-north line has already lost one of its normally four summer
services this year. But the justice in ScotRail having to reduce
services at all, simply because Mr Salmon acted prematurely, by
announcing on December 14 that he was effectively ending the sleeper and
Motorail, will not be discernible to many in the Highlands.
Mr Salmon has already seen fit to protect the London to Penzance
sleeper and, given yesterday's ruling, he should face up to his clear
responsibility and release the 0.8% of his #2.1bn which would allow the
Fort William service to continue running.

A MACHINE-SHOP worker was sacked after he wrote an anonymous letter
about his new supervisor to the local radio station and it was
broadcast.
Mr Peter Ferries was fired by Hydrobond Engineering Ltd, of Bridge of
Don, Aberdeen, and the Northsound Radio disc jockey who read out the
letter was suspended for two weeks.
Mr Ferries, of Mastrick Lane, Aberdeen, took the company to an
industrial tribunal, claiming his sacking was unfair. The tribunal
rejected his claim.
The tribunal heard that the letter was about new machine-shop
supervisor, Mr Keith Drummond, and claimed the atmosphere was murder.
''He grasses you off for the slightest thing. For example, if you've
been to the bog for more than two minutes, he's up telling the general
manager.''
The letter -- read out in its entirety on air, and referred to several
times during the three-hour show, which was broadcast throughout the
factory -- named Mr Drummond. It added: ''He is only 26-30 in age and
would probably be a good laugh like everybody else here, if he would
only stop being a brown-nose.''
The tribunal heard that one of the workers reported the matter to
general manager George Smith, who went to the machine shop to listen to
part of the broadcast. He spoke to Mr Drummond, who was initially going
to laugh the matter off but became more upset as the programme continued
and eventually complained. His family was extremely upset and his wife
wanted to move back to Edinburgh.
Management contacted Northsound and was given a copy of the anonymous
letter. The handwriting was compared and it was found to be like Mr
Ferries'. He denied he was to blame but was eventually fired.
At a later meeting, he admitted writing the letter and posting it to
Northsound Radio. He apologised to Mr Drummond but Mr Drummond told the
tribunal he didn't consider it an apology as he had expressed no feeling
of remorse to him. He felt he was just trying to get his job back.
Mr Ferries also went to ask Mr Smith for his job back but shouted at
him: ''Don't think for one single moment I'm back to beg for my job back
-- I'm not.''
At an appeal hearing, he admitted writing the letter but claimed his
actions did not justify being sacked. His appeal was dismissed.
In its findings, the tribunal said Mr Ferries' behaviour could only be
described as gross misconduct and would have merited summary dismissal.
He had given no thought to the distress caused to Mr Drummond and his
family.
The tribunal agreed that the letter was offensive and could only have
been construed as such and ruled his sacking was fair.

SCIENTISTS searching for a treatment for Alzheimer's Disease have
located the mechanism which causes the build-up of brain ''plaques''
leading to dementia.
It is hoped the discovery could mean the use of experimental drugs
against the disease within a few months. It might also be possible to
treat patients suffering from a form of plaque build-up in other parts
of the body.
Details of the study -- led by Professor Mark Pepys at Hammersmith
hospital in west London -- have been published in the US journal,
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.
However, the Alzheimer's Research Trust, which plans to set up a
centre in the UK, gave a guarded welcome to the report.
A spokesman said: ''It will take years of research before any final
announcement or significant breakthrough can be made. But there cannot
be enough research into it. The problem is, every time there is a report
like this it raises false hopes for sufferers.''
The disease is one of the most devastating forms of dementia, starting
with memory loss and progressing until the victim loses all sense of
identity.

A ROUTINE school medical examination uncovered a serious vascular
condition in the daughter of Rangers defender John Brown, it emerged
yesterday.
Lauren, five, had appeared perfectly fit and healthy, with no symptoms
to betray her condition, until a heart murmur was picked up during the
check-up at Glasgow Academy six weeks ago.
It meant an operation at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in
Glasgow -- and a visit to Yorkhill by Ibrox mascot Broxi Bear yesterday
as Lauren prepared to go home a week after surgery.
The heart murmur led to the discovery that Lauren had a constriction
in her aorta, the artery leading from her heart down to the lower half
of her body; as a result her heart was having to beat harder to get
blood through, increasing blood pressure to the upper part of her body
and her head.
''There was the potential for damage, a stroke for example, resulting
from this high blood pressure, perhaps in 10 or 20 years,'' said
consultant cardiologist Dr Alan Houston.
In an operation lasting several hours, consultant surgeon Mr Morgan
Jamieson opened the constricted area.
Her mother Diane, 33, said yesterday she had been devastated to
discover that her apparently healthy daughter had such a problem but was
reassured when the doctors explained what was wrong and what they
intended to do.
Now she is expected to be fully fit in a few weeks, with every
prospect of a normal, healthy life, said Mr Jamieson.
The couple have a younger daughter, Megan, aged two. She has been
checked and found to have no such problem.

A JUDGE yesterday said he would take time to think on a Government
move to prevent former Greater Manchester deputy chief constable John
Stalker giving some of his evidence in a civil hearing.
Ministers have said they fear some evidence by Mr Stalker could
''prejudice or impede'' efforts to permanently end terrorism.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew intervened at the start
of the hearing being brought by former wealthy businessman Kevin Taylor,
63, at the High Court in Liverpool.
Mr Taylor is claiming damages from the former Chief Constable of
Greater Manchester, Sir James Anderton, for alleged malicious
prosecution.
Mr Taylor, of Accrington, Lancashire, was charged with defrauding the
Co-Op Bank of #250,000 but the case collapsed in 1990 amid allegations
that the police had fabricated evidence.
He claims police concocted the charge to discredit his friend Mr
Stalker, who is due to give evidence early in the hearing.
Yesterday, Mr Justice Owen heard submissions by counsel in camera for
more than two hours.
He then reserved his decision until Thursday, when his judgment is
expected to be announced in open court.
The court heard earlier that it was up to the judge whether Sir
Patrick's objections were upheld.
Sir Patrick objects to a ''huge swathe'' of Mr Stalker's proposed
evidence in the hearing, which is expected to last up to 10 months.
Crown counsel Ian Burnett, representing the Treasury Solicitor, said
Sir Patrick objected to some evidence for reasons of public interest and
national security.
''He is not satisfied that the overall balance of public interest is
in favour of disclosure,'' said Mr Burnett.
On the IRA and loyalist ceasefires, he stressed: ''Her Majesty's
Government has made the working assumption that the ceasefires are meant
to be permanent.
''The Government has begun an exploratory dialogue with
representatives of Sinn Fein, the Ulster Democratic Party, and the
Progressive Unionist Party.
''Nevertheless, terrorist organisations retain the capability to
continue or renew their violence.
''Nothing should be done that would prejudice or impede the efforts of
Her Majesty's Government to that end -- or which would be of assistance
to terrorists, either now or in the future.''
However, Mr Roger Farley QC, for Mr Taylor, said : ''The plaintiff's
case is that he was the victim of a high-level conspiracy to destroy
him.
''This late intervention by the Government can only serve to confirm
in his mind that those forces are closing rank again to prevent the
light of truth shining through.''
There was a major controversy in 1986 in what became known as the
Stalker Affair.
Mr Stalker, then deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester police,
was removed from an inquiry into the alleged ''shoot to kill'' policy in
Northern Ireland.

ADVERTISEMENTS which mislead overweight people into thinking they can
shed pounds of fat could be banned under new guidelines.
The move comes after research showed a ''disturbing'' number of
slimming, health, and beauty promotions broke advertising codes.
In future, firms which breach codes three times will have all future
adverts vetted for a year.
The Advertising Standards Authority monitored 174 slimming
advertisements in two weeks in January and found 41% misled the public,
while another 7% were borderline.
Of 470 adverts for health and beauty products, 10% broke advertising
codes while another 13% where borderline.
Adverts for slimming therapies and beauty products caused the greatest
concern, said the ASA.
Troublesome adverts included those for slimming clubs which said
weight loss was guaranteed.
Earlier this year, the Independent Television Commission announced a
clampdown on slimming adverts on TV, including those for WeightWatchers,
featuring actress Cheryl Baker.
ASA spokesman Bill Lennon said yesterday: ''These ads are making
miracle-cure claims to vulnerable people.
''Although we regularly see unacceptable ads, we receive a
surprisingly low level of complaints about them.
''This may be because consumers are too embarrassed to admit they have
been misled.
''People blame themselves for not losing weight, rather than the
product.''
The ASA says the number of slimming adverts which break guidelines has
improved in the last year -- from 65% in 1994 -- but there is still room
for concern.
An ASA spokesman added: ''We are confident this new procedure will go
a long way to clearing the bad name a few wayward advertisers have given
to the otherwise respectable health and beauty industry.
''Only those who regularly flout the codes will be caught by the
requirements of the new procedure.
''It will not affect the vast majority of health and beauty
advertisers who are extremely careful to ensure they do not mislead the
public.''

A RURAL community fighting plans for an open-cast coal mine bigger
than its village last night confronted the developers who are behind the
project.
Residents of Ormiston, population 2000, packed their village hall to
voice their objections to James Fenton and Sons, which has lodged a
planning application with East Lothian District Council for a 110-acre
open-cast mine 200 metres to the west of the picturesque village.
Mr David Carlisle, of the Campaign for the Ormiston Environment, said
the proposed mine would break local and regional planning policies. It
would also cause dust and noise difficulties and cause transport
problems for the village, with lorries rumbling to and from it.
Mr Carlisle said the public should be wary of the number of
applications for open-cast mines being lodged all over Scotland. He
added: ''We believe there should not be such developments near any large
centre of population.
''The number of open-cast mine applications lodged with councils has
risen from around 20 to 120 in the last calendar year. That is worrying
for people up and down the country concerned about the environment.''
Local district councillor Mr Tom Ferguson said there had been
''universal condemnation'' of the plan.
Consultant John Taylor, who is giving advice to Fentons, said it had
been happy to take up the offer from the community council to attend
last night's meeting. He played down local fears about environmental
problems and said that the mine would create about 22 local jobs.

ABERDEEN were left reeling yesterday when Eoin Jess was ruled out of
the relegation decider at Falkirk.
The Scotland striker, recalled to prompt the Pittodrie club's revival,
has damaged knee ligaments.
The injury means his season is over and he will be unavailable if the
Dons are involved in the play-offs.
Acting manager Roy Aitken's plans for the Brockville match on which
their fate will hinge have been wrecked by injuries and suspensions.
Apart from having Jess sidelined, striker Billy Dodds and midfielders
Paul Kane and Peter Hetherston are all suspended and the Pittodrie club
is awaiting a specialist's report on Scott Booth, who has undergone
exploratory surgery on a pelvic injury at a Harley Street clinic.
Aberdeen's fightback from a seemingly impossible position has rallied
their fans behind the cause. The Brockville match will be all-ticket
with a 13,400 capacity with 7000 tickets being allocated to the
Pittodrie club.
* DUNDEE United manager Billy Kirkwood is planning major surgery for
the club during the close-season -- no matter which division they find
themselves playing next season.
Kirkwood, haunted by the threat of relegation since he took over from
Ivan Golac in March, will push his players towards one final effort to
beat the drop when they face Celtic at Tannadice on Saturday.
But yesterday, he made no effort to hide the fact that win or lose,
there will be sweeping changes in personnel at the club.
He already has decided that there will be no close-season break as he
bids to reshape a club that has fallen on unexpected bad times since
winning the Scottish Cup last season.
Kirkwood said: ''I have a shopping list of players I would like to
bring here and these players are the same whether we are relegated or
not. I want to bring better quality men to Tannadice and that means
people who can play in the first division or the premier division.''

RANGERS' hopes of signing Paul Gascoigne were given a boost last night
when England manager Terry Venables said he would be happy if the Lazio
player moved to Ibrox.
Venables spoke to the player he took to Tottenham Hotspur, and has
since maintained is a vital part of the England set-up, on Sunday night
when he arrived home from a visit to Majorca.
Yesterday, he was furious at suggestions that he was trying to push
Gascoigne towards a Premiership club in England.
''People seem to be trying to portray me as a Mr Fixit, some kind of
middle man,'' he said. ''That's totally wrong. As far as I'm concerned,
if Paul goes to Rangers, then that will be good for him and his career
-- and good, too, for England. That, after all, is my major concern.
''I would hate for people in Scotland to think that I would put Paul
off going to Rangers, but why should I do that?
''They are as big a club as any, and they will be playing in the
European Cup next season.''
The England manager simply wants Gascoigne to make the kind of move
which could resurrect his career.
''I spoke to Paul on Sunday night and told him that all I wanted was
for him to go to a club where he would be happy, and where his talents
would be allowed to flourish,'' Venables said.
''I could see that happen at Rangers. There is a stage for him there
and they have a manager in Walter Smith who could bring the best out of
him.
''As far as I'm concerned all I want is the chance to see Paul playing
regularly and at the top level.
''He can do that with Rangers. It will be easy for me to watch him
there and if he is in Europe with them then better still.''
One former England internationalist who enjoyed his days at Ibrox
believes Gascoigne may well choose to come to Scotland.
Ray Wilkins, who spent two years at Ibrox after he signed from Paris
St Germain in 1987, would like to sign the controversial midfield man
for his own team, Queen's Park Rangers, but admits that the bidding is
going beyond his club's range.
''Rangers have the financial backing to compete for someone in the
higher price bracket,'' said Wilkins, who showed that he retains some of
his classy skills when he played in the Scott Nisbet testimonial match
at Ibrox last week.
''When it was first mentioned I was interested at #2m to #2.5m and I
think that would have applied to several Premiership clubs.
''Now, it seems to be heading towards #5m and only a few can compete
in that bracket, with Rangers being one of them.
''Paul wants to play on a big stage and they can offer him the chance
to play in the European Cup next season. That could be a factor, he
would grace Ibrox, I'm sure of that.''
Wilkins, who was capped 84 times for England, was past his
international days when he played at Ibrox but others, like Terry
Butcher and Chris Woods managed to combine playing in Scotland and
turning out for England.
Butcher won 33 of his 77 caps while a Rangers player while keeper
Woods, now with Sheffield Wednesday, collected 20 of his 43 caps while
he was between the posts at Ibrox, and Gary Stevens was chosen 20 times
for England, out of a total of 43, as a Rangers player.

* RANGERS are being blocked by the Government in their attempt to keep
Alexei Mikhailichenko at Ibrox for at least another year because the
Home Office department which deals with work permits say the Ukrainian
has not played enough matches for the Ibrox side, writes James Traynor.
Walter Smith discovered the problem only after he decided
Mikhailichenko should be offered an extension to his contract and
yesterday the Rangers manager said the stance of the authorities was
unfair. It is easy to sympathise with him because the midfield player,
who has been at Ibrox for four years, has not been able to play much
this season because of injury.
Rangers have been told their player's work permit can be extended for
six more months, but that is hardly a suitable compromise.
Smith said: ''It seems unfair. They are saying Alexei hasn't played
enough matches, but how could he play when he was injured?
''We are still talking to them about the permit but it is difficult to
discuss a contract with Alexei when I don't know if he'll be allowed to
stay.''
There was better news on the medical front with Smith reporting Ally
McCoist's operation on a troublesome ankle looks to have been
successful.
The striker had minor surgery in London last week and believes he will
be able to take a full part in pre-season training and be ready for the
start of the new season.
''It is looking as though the operation will clear up Ally's trouble
once and for all,'' said Smith.
The Ibrox manager has cut his playing staff by 16 since the end of
last season and has brought in only three players, Alan McLaren, Gary
Bollan, and Alex Cleland, in that time. ''I have an interest in a few
players and I am still looking at Scottish players as well,'' he added.

* DOUG Walker of Heriot-Watt University yesterday won the 200 metres
in 20.53secs, fastest time in Britain this season and highlight of the
three-day British Universities Championships at Meadowbank.
Walker, 21, not only booked himself a trip to Japan in August -- he
was the only competitor to meet the UK qualifying standard for the World
Student Games in Fukuoka -- but proved he is ready to challenge for full
British senior status.
A slight following wind (+3.1mps) did not outweigh the disadvantage on
the bend, or invalidate the mark as a meeting best performance, but
there will be debate as to whether Gary Jennings' 46.95 will be deemed
to have equalled the hand-timed 400m record of 46.9, set by Seb Coe in
1981. Glasgow's Hugh Kerr finished third in 47.75.
Scotland's Commonwealth decathlete, Jamie Quarry, was denied a title
treble by Andy Lewis after a countback in the long jump, both athletes
reaching 6.89m. Quarry had won the 110m hurdles in 14.23 to add to his
discus title.
Euan Calvert (Strathclyde) picked up a good 800m scalp, out-lunging
English international Paul Walker in 1-53.53. Yesterday's winners:
Men: 200m: D Walker (Heriot-Watt) 20.53; 400m: G Jennings

TOM Murray and Chris Robison, Spango Valley clubmates and the only
Scots in the Northumberland Castles Challenge, took yesterday's final
event by storm to finish second and third overall in the all-terrain
series of six races on successive days.
Murray's fourth place in the hill race, which completed the marathon
distance, was enough to retain second on total time, clinching a $3000
prize behind Martin Jones, who collected $5000. But Murray broke clear
on the final prime to edge Jones for the King of the Mountains title.
Robison sprinted into second yesterday, clocking 19-06, three seconds
behind winner Adrian Passey and four ahead of Murray, but that allowed
him to leap-frog Carl Thackery into overall third, landing a $2000
prize. Second in the women's race confirmed Angie Hullay as overall
female winner.

CALEDONIAN Thistle and Huntly could be on course for a Tommy
Burns-style managerial wrangle.
The Scottish League side want to entice Huntly manager Steve Paterson
to Inverness one year before his contract expires.
But the chairman of the Highland League side, Forbes Shand, yesterday
hinted he could slap a ban on any formal talks between Paterson and the
Caley Thistle board.
Paterson, a former Manchester United player, admits he is still in the
dark about behind-the-scenes moves, but stated he would disappointed if
Huntly blocked a Caledonian Thistle approach.
He said: ''All I wanted was a chance to speak to Caley and find out
what they have to offer. But there is a strong possibility the board
will say no. The contractural situation is a grey area because I'm
actually on a player's contract with Huntly.
''The other possibility would be for Huntly to slap a ridiculously
large compensation price on my head. If that happens, it could kill the
issue, but if Caley had to pay say #50,000 to Huntly I would not go. It
would not be fair to Caley and it would not be fair to me.''

ARSENAL'S progress to the European Cup-winners' Cup final where they
meet Real Zaragoza in Paris tomorrow night has astonished the Continent.
For here is a team built on solid British foundations, playing the
direct football which is so derided across Europe, on the verge of
winning the trophy for the second year in succession.
If they do they will be the first-ever team to win the cup twice in a
row and their success would be a huge boost to the supposedly ailing
British game.
It would also push Stewart Houston towards the manager's job on a
permanent basis. At present the Scot, who played all his football in
England, remains in a kind of managerial limbo.
He was pitchforked into the caretaker role he still holds when George
Graham was sacked. Since then, he has guided Arsenal to Premiership
safety -- there was a time when the Highbury side slipped into the
danger zone -- and has taken the team to victory over two of the most
respected teams in Europe.
His reward, so far, has been silence from the boardroom and a constant
barrage of rumours suggesting that Arsenal's directors are ready to
appoint Bruce Rioch as their new manager.
Houston ignores the talk and gets on with the job, as he admits:
''When I first took over we were a club with a lot of problems and the
most immediate task for me was to make sure we were not relegated.
''I know that people will take a look at the table now and see where
we are placed and think that we never were in danger. But that's not
true.
''So, I looked at the situation and I worried in case the Cup-winners'
Cup became a diversion which would take the players' attention away from
the league games.
''Then when we began to put together the results in the European
tournament it actually became a bonus for us. Instead of giving me
headaches it lifted the players and it was as if the two campaigns began
to feed off each other.''
The win over French side Auxerre was the spark for the Arsenal
revival. Then came the semi-final victory over Italian side Sampdoria,
who were favourites to win the competition. Suddenly, Houston found
himself looking at a possible place in the history books -- but still
without confirmation that the job will be his on a permanent basis.
Said Houston:' 'Obviously, I want the job, but, so far, no-one has
said anything to me about it. What I have to do is carry on and try to
win this trophy.
''It has been difficult. The games we have had to play have not been
easy. In fact, I would imagine that in the last two matches we were not
given any chance at all of winning.
''But what we have been able to do is give the continentals a taste of
something they don't like. They don't enjoy facing a British-style game.
I know we get a lot of stick about how we play in this country but there
are strengths we have that they don't.
''And when you go into battle we have the men you can rely on. Tony
Adams, for instance, has been magnificent. The man is a born leader. You
only have to watch him in action for this club to see the influence he
has on the players around him.
''I still look back and wonder just how we were able to beat Auxerre.
They are a superb team, very skilful, highly talented, and technically
better than we are. But we did win and we did again when we played
Sampdoria and it was Tony Adams and Steve Bould who helped us so much in
these games.
''We will miss Steve in this match. He is suspended and I am still
tinkering around in my mind trying to decide who will take his place.
But no matter the personnel we will still take the same approach. We
will play the way we are happiest playing and we will pressure them the
way we have pressured other teams this season.
''They won't like it but it is our best bet of achieving a result. I
believe we can do it and it would be a tremendous thing for the club if
we could become the first in the history of the competition to be
winners two years in a row. That would really mean something to me and
the players.''
It would, in fact, take the man from Dunoon into the record books and
make people in his own country sit up and take notice.
He has not had much recognition on this side of the Border. The highly
respected full back with Manchester United won one Scottish cap in l976.
From Old Trafford he moved to Sheffield United and afterwards into a
coaching career at places like Colchester and Plymouth until George
Graham, a former Old Trafford team-mate, invited him to join the
backroom staff at Arsenal.
Now he is the manager -- at least for this attempt at glory -- and if
he is successful in the Parc des Princes then perhaps Arsenal's
directors will make Houston the man to restore their image and
consolidate their Premiership position.

HYBRID trials being conducted by the Scottish Agricultural College and
the National Institute of Agricultural Botany could lead to a revolution
in UK rape production, according to leading rape breeder CPB Twyford.
First-year results with the variety Synergy show that growers could
expect up to 20% higher yields and a #90-a-hectare jump in profits
compared to today's top rapes. However, in order to get the best results
farmers would have to accept a radical alteration in their husbandry
methods.
''Hybrids require precise drilling of lower than normal seed rates,''
said Twyford's oilseed rape consultant, Mike Pickford. ''They also need
well-timed high rates of sulphur, and pollen beetle control.''
The yield benefits came from pooling the very best genetic material
from each of two unlike parents, he explained.
Normal rape plants are usually 80% self-pollinating but hybridisation
is only possible if this supply of self-pollen is removed. When this
''sterilised'' plant is sown alongside normal oilseed rape
cross-pollination occurs and hybrid vigour is achieved in the resultant
plant.
''The biggest shock to the system will be seed rates of around 3.5 to
3.8 kilogrammes per hectare,'' said Mr Pickford. ''That is just 70 seeds
per square metre -- under half of what growers are used to drilling with
traditional rapes.

<HEADLINE>Lambing in May reduces costs</HEADLINE>

HIGH subsidies and ''fairly high'' prices for lambs have combined to
make farmers complacent about the future, Dr John Vipond, specialist
sheep advisor with the Scottish Agricultural College said yesterday.
Speaking at a preview for Scotsheep '95, which will be held at Flass,
near Westruther, Berwickshire, on May 26, Dr Vipond said that farmers
had to look ahead and be aware that things could change.
''We have to make the best use of labour on the farm'', he said.
Visitors to Flass would see that it was possible to produce lamb
cheaply, efficiently and effectively.
One of the ideas which host farmer Tom Macfarlane had adopted was May
lambing, which resulted in reduced costs for a significant part of his
total flock.
The theme of impending change was taken up by Dr Basil Lowman, a beef
specialist with SAC, who took the view that the extension of the
European Union to include Eastern European states must result in less
money being available to support farming in existing member countries.
The CAP structure could remain, he said, but the amount of money
available would be substantially reduced because the expanded European
Union would not be able to afford payments at existing levels.
''We have to take this time to restructure out businesses and ensure
that in five to ten years time we can compete, with less Government
input, on the world market -- because that is where, eventually, we will
have to be,'' he said.
Dr Lowman added that being competitive on the world market meant
adopting quality as a watchword. By quality, he said, he did not mean
carcass qualification but the taste of the product.
The Scotsheep venue, Flass Farm, is a 1700-acre unit on which Mr
Macfarlane and his wife Mary run 2000 ewes and 340 suckler cows. All
lambs and calves are finished on the farm along with 300-400 bought-in
store cattle. Flass is widely recognised as one of the best-managed
stock units in the Borders and has seen many changes since Mr Macfarlane
bought it nine years ago.
Three years ago, because of a depressed lamb trade and a shortage of
housing for all his ewes Mr Macfarlane decided to put a small percentage
of his mule ewes into a late lambing flock -- tups going out in December
and ewes lambing in mid May and early June. Now 25% of his ewes are
lambed outside in May, with reduced costs in concentrate feeding and
labour.
He believes the late lambing flock is now the more profitable despite
a lower lambing percentage because his over-wintered lambs can oftem
make twice as much as lambs sold through the previous summer and autumn.
On the beef side the Macfarlanes have opted for a compact calving
period with their bulls going out for just seven weeks in the year.
Calves are weaned in November-December and steers finished on a ration
of silage, maize gluton and barley to produce a 320-340 kg carcass. The
aim is to hit the peak of the early summer market in June. Heifers are
over-wintered on ad-lib silage and sold off the grass the following
summer.
30 breed societies will be represented at the Scotsheep event, which
is sponsored by the Bank of Scotland. There will also be 120 trade
stands and an invitation sheepdog trial.

ALL eyes will be on the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report
published at 11.30am on Thursday after Kenneth Clarke's controversial
decision to leave interest rates unchanged on Friday.
The City will have to wait six weeks to find out what advice Eddie
George, the Governor of the Bank of England, tendered at the meeting.
There is speculation among City economists that the Bank's report will
conclude that the Government is likely to fail in its objective of
pushing down the underlying inflation rate to the bottom half of its 1%
to 4% target range.
Two hours earlier the April inflation figures will have been released.
James Capel is forecasting a 1% rise in the retail price index on the
back of the restriction in Miras to 15% and higher council taxes and
rents.
But the annual rate of headline inflation is expected to moderate from
3.5% to 3.3%, largely because the Government dropped plans to increase
VAT on domestic power from 8% to 17.5%.
Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest, will rise by
around 0.8%, enabling the annual rate to drop back from 2.8% to 2.6%,
still in the top half of the target range.
The new RPIY measure, which excludes mortgage interest, and indirect
and council taxes, will gain 0.6% on the month, but the annual rate will
rise from 1.9% to 2%.
Also due on Thursday are February's visible trade figures. The betting
is on the deficit dropping from around #1100m to #900m.
On Friday March industrial production figures may show a recovery with
the headline figure and its manufacturing component sporting
month-on-month increases of 0.5%.
If so the annual rate of increase in industrial production will rise
from 3.8% in February to 4.7%. Manufacturing output would be 4.1% after
3.3% in February.

Blackburn 1, Newcastle 0
ALAN Shearer was in the mood to make history, not just celebrate it,
and gave Blackburn their very own special VE Day with the victory at
Ewood against Newcastle which surely has decided the championship's
destiny. And let's not forget a superb display by keeper Tim Flowers
Not one but two world wars have been fought since this Lancashire town
were last on top of the football world.
But there has been a sense of destiny about the place since
millionaire Jack Walker arrived on the scene.
His appointment of Kenny Dalglish was astute, but the signing of
Shearer has been pivotal and his thirty-sixth goal of the season put
Blackburn five points clear of Manchester United at the top.
Rovers were lucky, however, that Colin Hendry's lunging tackle on
Keith Gillespie late in the second half did not result in a penalty.
As it is, the street parties could be launched tomorrow night. If
United do not beat Southampton, Blackburn will be champions for the
first time since 1914.
Even if they do, Blackburn will still take their crown if they win at
Dalglish's old club, Liverpool, on Sunday or United simultaneously fail
to win at West Ham.
So much for cracking up. Alex Ferguson had taunted Rovers as United
moved to within two points with Sunday's anxious win over Sheffield
Wednesday.
But instead of stretching their nerves, it had the opposite effect,
winding up the leaders to prove him wrong. And the cheer which greeted
Shearer's header after 29 minutes will have echoed all the way down the
A666 to Old Trafford.
The Geordies, who can see a UEFA return disappearing with their
dreadful away record, showed all the tension and it cost them a fatal
series of defensive misfortunes from Pavel Srnicek's fly-kick under
pressure.
Shearer's persistence won the ball for David Batty whose shot was
turned aside by Darren Peacock to Graeme Le Saux on the left.
he England full-back chipped to the back post where Shearer boldly
rose for to steer in his header.
No-one was more pleased than Walker who half an hour earlier had
handed over the Supporters' Association's player of the year award to
Shearer and cheered the crowd by declaring: ''I want to keep Alan
Shearer at Blackburn Rovers.''
0
Newcastle, so anonymous for most of the first half, roused themselves
and if it had not been for keeper Flowers' brilliance, they could have
yet tilted the scales Manchester's way.

SCOTTISH companies feature strongly in this week's list of companies
reporting their figures, many of them leading names. Scots include Royal
Bank of Scotland and Scottish Power tommorrow, which also takes in the
the first quarter figures from General Accident.
Starting off, though, are today's half-year figures from
Edinburgh-based Sidlaw, which recently severed its connection with the
jute industry in Dundee with the sale of its jute, flax and trading
business.
The company warned at the time of its AGM that there would be a
significant reduction in the packaging division's profits for the first
half and according to some estimates interim profits could have dipped
from #7m to around #5.5m before any exceptional losses. The interim
dividend is likely to be unchanged.
The consensus forecast by analysts for Scottish Power's full year
results is for a rise to #377m from #351.1m last time with estimates
ranging from #368m to #390m. But for the relatively mild weather in
Scotland which would have affected volumes, some analysts believe the
company could have shown a truly spectacular increase. The dividend
total is projected to be lifted from 12.4p to between 13.5p to 13.7p.
Royal Bank of Scotland's half-timer is expected to be well received.
Profit estimates range from #264m to #302m before tax at the top end
compared to #201m for the first half of the previous year. On the
dividend front, last year's 4p interim is forecast to be boosted to
4.75p or 5p.
For General Accident, first quarter profits are thought likely to
emerge in a range of #82m to #106m which would be a useful increase over
the #60.4m seen in the first quarter of last year.
The oil sector is also in the spotlight this week with both BP (Today)
and Royal Dutch/Shell (Thursday) unveiling first quarter figures. Rising
oil prices and better chemical margins will have provided a substantial
boost to both these giants though refining margins remain weak. BP's
replacement cost net income is forecast at #410m-#430m against #328m a
year ago with the dividend set to rise from 2.5p to 3p. North Sea oil
prices averaged just over $17 a barrel in the January/March quarter, $3
more than in the first quarter of 1994.
Royal Dutch/Shell, basking in strongly improved margins in its
chemcial business, should also report a strong rise in first quarter
profits. Analysts predict replacement cost net income will reach from
between #1034m to #1210m from #949m in the same period of 1994, with the
consensus around #1150m.

IT COULD end in tears.
The move for Paul Gascoigne is typical of Rangers, whose ambitions
extend well beyond the premier division, and despite the interest of
other clubs the Ibrox side remain favourites to sign the enfant terrible
of British football.
Having agreed a fee of #4.5m with Lazio, Walter Smith is waiting to
talk to Gascoigne's agents and if all goes well in those discussions,
Rangers again will have demonstrated their determination to compete with
the best.
Gascoigne commands a skill which is granted to mortals only
occasionally. He is capable of performing on a plateau beyond the reach
of others, but he is also likely to frustrate and infuriate those around
him, and there should be no doubt Gascoigne's self-destructive
tendencies are often the dominant forces.
When everything is working well, when he is healthy in body and mind,
he is a joy to watch, quickly making an audience forget the many flaws
in his character. How someone who can be so obnoxious at times also
contributes to the beauty of the game in such a sublime manner must
remain one of life's mysteries.
His movements and touches are the products of an instinctive flair for
the game. Gascoigne reads a match with a vision which is panoramic,
seeing each game as a whole rather than sporadic bursts of fist-clenched
energy, and such extraordinary vision helps him to stay a couple of
moves ahead of everyone else.
By now, Gascoigne should have been one of world football's genuine
superstars, but he has not achieved that status because a combination of
downright misfortune and stupidity has denied him. That alone should
have been enough to make Smith look and say: ''No, thank you.''
There can never be any guarantees when a player signs for club, but in
the case of Gascoigne, the doubts have to be greater than normal. He has
a history of injury and is no stranger to controversy. Away from the
game, he has fallen short of what is required of a top professional in
Italian football, otherwise he wouldn't be up for sale.
Do Rangers need another player who doesn't know how to behave, and do
they believe they will have uninterrupted use of him should he
eventually sign on at Ibrox? Surely they have already discovered that
with players of fragile temperament anything is possible at any time, on
or off the pitch.
They signed Duncan Ferguson from Dundee United for #4m and were
relieved to get their money back when Everton took the wayward striker
off their hands last year. The striker fell foul of both the game's
authorities and also the law of the land and Smith did not look
disappointed when he saw the player head south.
Life as on Old Firm player can be a stressful existence and successful
survival often depends on the strength of a player's character, his
ability to walk away from difficult situations. Better still, the smart
ones see trouble approaching and remove themselves out of the line of
fire.
There is nothing in the Gascoigne story so far to suggest he has the
mentality to cope easily with life in the West of Scotland and, in
attempting to buy him, Rangers are trying to purchase a flawed genius.
The risk is too great and I believe it is one Rangers can't afford to
run.
Their desire to be seen as a serious player in the major league is
admirable and negotiating with world football's most influential leaders
is good for the image of Rangers chairman David Murray. He probably
enjoys life at that lofty level and his determination to do so also
reflects well on the Scottish game in general.
Awareness of Rangers and their playing environment is heightened by
this pursuit of Gascoigne and, of course, the prospect of the former
Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur player settling at Ibrox would
stimulate commercial activities at the club.
Only recently Rangers offered season ticket holders the chance to pay
#399 each for the right to purchase a seat at Ibrox for the next 25
years and Gascoigne's signature would help to entice more fans to accept
this deal.
However, the argument against signing Gascoigne, I believe, is much
stronger than any debate in favour.
In May 1991, Gascoigne seriously damaged his right knee playing for
Spurs in the FA Cup final against Nottingham Forest after he had lunged
into a tackle and his #5.5m transfer to Lazio was put on hold.
Later that same year, he required a second knee operation after an
incident in a Newcastle nightclub, and he suffered fractures to the
tibia and fibula of his right leg during training in April of last year.
Like some kind of oaf, he made an insulting remark to a Norwegian
television crew and Lazio fined him #9000 after he burped into a
microphone.
Can Gascoigne be relied upon to play often enough for Rangers and
champion their cause in the manner of Brian Laudrup, who conducts
himself with dignity at all times? Indeed, what would Laudrup make of
someone like Gascoigne?
Having given Scottish football the Dane, it would be disappointing if
Rangers were now to present someone with dubious credentials. It could
also be potentially damaging, especially if after having signed,
Gascoigne was unavailable for a big match or matches because of a
failure to grow up.

CELTIC are moving steadily towards settling the transfer of Belgian
striker Marc Degryse, who has repeated his wish to join the Glasgow club
after more talks this week. Parkhead chief executive Fergus McCann was
in Brussels yesterday to discuss the terms the player and Anderlecht
want, but the transfer fee of around #1.3m should be no obstacle.
Degryse is said to be on #7000 a week in Brussels and there may need
to be some manoeuvring if he is to become a Parkhead player, but the
Belgian club indicated yesterday that they now are ready to consider a
bid from Celtic.
Their general manager, Michel Vershueren, said last night: ''I met
with Mr McCann and am now awaiting his offer. No obstacles have been
placed in Celtic's way to buying our player. The ball is in their
court.''
The player himself pointed out that it could still be a couple of
weeks before the transfer is settled, adding: ''Negotiations are moving
slowly, but I still want to join Celtic and I am very happy that they
beat Rangers yesterday. This proves to me that they are a good side.
With some new players I believe they can be a great team again.''
Be that as it may, Celtic at least showed remarkable foresight to
decide in advance to launch their new first team strip yesterday, the
day after they beat their oldest rivals 3-0.
The new jersey, which begins what many fans will hope will be the
route back to traditional hoops, will be seen for the first time at
Hampden on Tennents Scottish Cup final day, SFA permitting, when the
Parkhead side hope it will prove even luckier and see them collect their
first trophy for five years.
If that turns out to be the case, the trio of ''model'' players who
sported the new shirts, Paul McStay, John Collins, and Pierre van
Hooydonk, are sure to have played major roles. They all sounded
confident enough, naturally, but aware that the win over the Ibrox team
needs to be followed by two more good displays against Hibs tomorrow and
Dundee United on Saturday if the boost to morale is to be carried
through to the final against Airdrie.
McStay said: ''The win on Sunday gave everybody at the club a lift,
players as well as fans, but we have got to show the same quality in our
last two matches. I think we would be a lot happier on Saturday night if
we had played well. We would then have a couple of weeks to get rid of
wee knocks and bruises before the final.''
His team's inconsistency, demonstrated by defeats by Hearts and
Partick Thistle on either side of a victory over Falkirk, has been as
frustrating for the players as it has for the fans, but Collins at least
offers one reason, if not an excuse. ''The so-called smaller teams make
it difficult for us by sitting back and not giving us have space to
play, but Rangers make it an open game. It is an old cliche, but it is
true that it takes two teams to make a game.''
* THERE are reports that Russian internationalist Dimitri Radchenko,
who plays for Racing Santander, also is on Celtic's shopping list.
* ABERDEEN were left reeling yesterday when Eoin Jess was ruled out of
the relegation decider at Falkirk. The Scotland striker, recalled to
prompt the Pittodrie club's revival, has damaged knee ligaments. The
injury means his season is over and he will be unavailable if the Dons
are involved in the play-offs.
Apart from having Jess sidelined, striker Billy Dodds and midfielders
Paul Kane and Peter Hetherston are all suspended and the Pittodrie club
is awaiting a specialist's report on Scott Booth, who has undergone
exploratory surgery on a pelvic injury at a Harley Street clinic.
The Brockville match will be all-ticket with a 13,400 capacity and
7000 tickets allocated to the Pittodrie club.

THE long-established links between the Torrance and Gallacher golfing
dynasties have been further strengthened by the outcome of two of the
weekend's competitions -- Sam Torrance's victory in the Italian Open and
Stephen Gallacher's in the Lytham Trophy, on the face of it worlds apart
but in this instance closely connected.
Sam Torrance advanced his prospects of securing an eighth successive
place on Europe's Ryder Cup team, to be captained by Stephen's uncle,
Bernard, and Stephen, taking on board the advice on his downswing he had
had from his coach, Sam's father, Bob, did likewise towards making his
first appearance in the Walker Cup match.
Bernard Gallacher must be encouraged with the way his side is
developing, although there are 16 points-counting events still to play
(as well as, for the first time, the US Open and PGA championships) and
the seriously lucrative portion of the season is launched this week with
the Benson and Hedges tournament at St Mellion.
But as Torrance remarked after his win in Milan: ''It is always good
to get your blows in first.'' Now, in fifth place on the points table,
he joins five of Europe's six foremost players among the first eight --
Ballesteros, Montgomerie, Langer, Olazabal, and Woosnam, the others
being Gilford and Rocca.
Moreover, of the first 10, who eventually will be automatically
selected, seven played in the 1993 match against the United States.
Faldo is missing, but he will play in five European tournaments and both
American championships and given the scale of the prize-money at stake
(a point for every #1 earned) he could well have played himself into the
side by the August deadline.
In Italy, Torrance, who will be 42 by match time, confirmed two
golfing truisms. He keeps reserving his best form for a Ryder Cup year
-- he won three times in 1993 against eight finishes in the first 10
last season -- and the injured or ailing golfer is frequently to be
feared more than the healthiest specimen of the breed.
Torrance, whose eighteenth regular tour win this was, since his first
in 1976, almost withdrew before the first round, having pulled a thigh
muscle, and he cancelled a bet he had placed on himself. But a record 63
in the third round brought him from four strokes behind to one in front
and after that he was never overtaken.
Gallacher, whose erratic driving was mainly responsible for his taking
but half a point from a possible four for Scotland against Sweden at
Loch Lomond only five days before, was all of seven strokes behind his
compatriot, Gordon Sherry, well into the final round at Royal Lytham.
But Gallacher made six consecutive 3s from the eighth, one of them an
eagle, whereas Sherry double-bogeyed the fourteenth and bogeyed the next
to finish runner-up to Gallacher, just as he had done in the 1994
European individual championship and this season's Scottish pipe-opener,
the Champion of Champions at Leven.
As these two made their way south to play at St Mellion, they may have
reflected on the simultaneous success of another member of the Walker
Cup squad, 19-year-old Gary Harris, who added the Berkshire Trophy to
his success in the English open stroke-play championship last year.
They might actually have had him as a more direct rival, for Harris
had originally entered for the Lytham only to decide instead to commute
more locally from his Swindon home. The wisdom of that change of mind
gave Harris his second victory of the spring in five outings.

* This week's tip comes from KEN HUTTON, the professional at Downfield
Golf Club, Dundee.
WHEN I play in pro-ams, the shot that always appears to trouble my
amateur partners is the drive into a strong wind. They invariably tee
the ball very low and then try to belt it. That is not the answer.
The secret is to make a better contact with the ball, and that is
achieved through an easier-than-normal swing.
When playing into the wind, I always tee the ball slightly higher than
normal, and grip about half-an-inch down the shaft.
I then concentrate on making a smooth swing with the emphasis on
striking the ball on the upswing. This action imparts top-spin on the
ball an helps it to fly much further into the wind.
Try this method, and the par-4s rendered out of reach due to climatic
conditions should suddenly become reachable again.
When hitting tee shots into the wind, remember the secret -- grip low,
tee high, and swing sweet.

WHILST Scotland's elite are gearing themselves for their assaults on
the World Cup and on Zimbabwe, and other rugby men are reaching for
their golf clubs and cricket whites, as well as perhaps making an
acquaintance of the family hoover, one small Scottish unit will be
contemplating a weekend during which they will go to where many other
Scots have gone but, of whom, very few have tasted high success.
What is more, they may have to aim for the stars without, arguably,
their most gifted exponent.
The event is the Middlesex Sevens, the venue a jam-packed Twickenham.
The club is Selkirk, and the player is Rodney Pow.
It was a savage blow to Selkirk at the Jed-Forest tournament on
Saturday that, having battled their way to the semi-final whilst
appearing eminently capable of then giving Gala a genuine test, they
lost Pow with shoulder damage that did not involve dislocation, but
severe bruising.
Pow means so much to Selkirk as a gifted performer who can shift,
creative and lethal in finishing, and a goal-kicker as well. Selkirk's
coach John Rutherford has described him as ''undoubtedly one of the best
sevens players in Scotland capable of absolute brilliance.'' With Pow's
pace to set alongside that of Scott Nichol, who will dash back from the
sevens for a Zimbabwe-bound squad session, Selkirk's scoring potential
would be massively boosted. Pow is doubtful, but Selkirk will wait and
hope.
They face a mighty task on their Middlesex Sevens debut. They will be
the siteenth Scottish club to have played there since the war, and only
Heriot's FP in 1949, and Stewart's-Melville FP in 1982, have emerged as
winners. It is something of a surprise that not one club from the home
of sevens, the Borders, has returned with the Russell Cargill Trophy,
named after the Edinburgh Academical who was the driving force behind
the inaugural tournament in 1926.
City clubs have responded more sucessfully to the peculiar challenges
of the Middlesex event. Whereas Heriot's FP (three times), Edinburgh
Wanderers (twice), Stewart's College FP, and Stewart's-Melville FP have
made it to the final, only Hawick of the senior Border clubs have done
so.
Border sides seldom have taken their home form to Twickenham. Some
have been invited after ''going off the boil,'' most have found the
standards at Twickenham, especially in overall pace and commitment,
higher than expected. There was a time too when the southern English
seldom were sevens fit and played a gentlemanly-type game, but now they
are fit and strong and certainly don't stand on ceremony.
So it would be some feather in the Selkirk cap if they could go all
the way. Whilst not setting heather afire in the Border Spring series
just ended, they made marked improvement from first round exits at Gala
and Melrose to quarter-finals at Hawick and Langholm, and the semi-final
at Riverside Park on Saturday.
Perhaps the key problem for Selkirk will be winning enough ball
against bigger opponents and, if Pow is unable to play, in matching them
for overall strength and pace. They also must keep their focus amid the
distintive end-of-season atmosphere generated by a huge crowd who
usually give guest sides a warm welcome.
Actually, it is harder to win at Twickenham nowadays in that clubs
cannot now enter a second string for the preliminary rounds from which
only six teams qualify for the final day. Invitations now go out to the
six top clubs in division one of the Courage leagues which vastly
increases the number of big club heavyweights in the draw. Then there
are the previous year's finalists and two other guest sides.
Selkirk's first opponents are Northampton, runners-up in 1993. That
will bring together in coaching opposition two of Scotland's finest
stand-offs, John Rutherford and Ian McGeechan, and whatever the outcome,
good crack between those two most respected figures will be high on
their agenda. If Selkirk win they are likely to meet Leicester in the
quarter-final.
Some prospect then for the Philiphaugh players, but they can take
heart from the fact that Northampton lost first time out last season by
26-12 to Rosslyn Park and that in recent seasons Jed-Forest (1987),
Edinburgh Academicals (1991) and Boroughmuir (1992) have exceeded
expectations in reaching the Middlesex semi-final. Nowadays also there
is a plate competition for those beaten first time out.
Rutherford, with a wise old head, has stressed to his players that
they should just go down there, relax and enjoy a unique experience.

PERSEVERANCE with a new swing paid off handsomely for Buchanan Castle
24-handicapper Ian Fraser, who earns the distinction of being our first
outright bandit of the week of the 1995 season. After months of
difficulty following a series of lessons from the club pro Keith Baxter,
the 39-year-old managing director of Kilsyth-based steel stockholders
Tube Developments was delighted that his determination paid off with a
net 57 in the Stirlingshire club's April Medal and a Parbusters score of
minus 12, the best this year in men's handicap by two shots.
That may well be good enough to end up in the top 10 and thus qualify
for the final, but first we will have to wait and see how good the
scoring is over the next 14 weeks.
The performance merited a handicap cut to 18, a mark with which he
feels much more comfortable. ''I was playing to that standard in bounce
games recently, but this is the first time I have put it all together in
a medal.''
He also made a plea for more weekend medals at his club than just one
a month.
Two years ago, his pro had told him he would never be able to hit the
ball well with the grip he had. ''Keith has helped me a lot,'' he said.
''He warned me it would be hard and it was for about six months, but I
stuck with it.''
In the other sections, Fiona Campbell, of Erskine, has set the pace in
women's handicap with a net 62, a score of minus 11, while Neil Black,
of Kilmarnock Barassie, carded a splendid gross 64, which leads this
week's men's scratch section on minus 5. It also features at minus 9 in
the handicap section.
Catherine Malcolm, of Prestwick St Cuthbert, and Dunblane New's
Heather Stirling jointly top women's scratch on plus 2. This week's

DRAKE, and those of his English descendants who fondly subscribe to
the traditional belief that Britannia rules the waves, will be spinning
in their graves this morning.
Whisper it quietly around Plymouth Ho, and among the white-ducked gin
and champagne-swillers of the Cowes set, but Britain's honour on the
high seas is about to be defended, for the first time, by Scots.
Stirling businessman Stephen Smith yesterday revealed he is investing
a slice of a fortune built on Space Invader machines to mount a Scottish
challenge in the Admiral's Cup.
The event, to be staged during Cowes Week which begins on July 24, is
effectively the world championship of ocean racing, a team event
involving competition in six races by three classes of yacht. Britain
has won only once since 1981. Germany, winners thrice in that time, are
currently backed by Mercedes to the tune of #5m.
England were frightened off naming a challenger in the largest of the
three classes by the professional but buccaneering approach of Smith's
Regatta Team Scotland, which yesterday unveiled their vessel at Largs.
''There is an attitude of Corinthian snobbery down south -- they'd
like to exclude the Scots,'' says Smith, who concedes that his personal
yachting accomplishments are, as yet, insufficient to establish his
credentials.
Though he has three times won the Scottish Sigma 38 title, was
runner-up for the UK championship, and in last year's West Highland
Week, cleaned up three awards including overall winner, the leap to
Admiral's Cup is akin to moving from sports car racing to Formula One
grand prix.
However critics would do well not to under-rate the Scots. They have
already bought a tried and tested #350,000 yacht, which as Corum Rubis,
under French colours, won the 1991 Fastnet race, final event of the cup.
And Smith's company is busily signing up the best expertise available.
As owner, he intends to be on board, but already pressed into service,
as navigator, is Campbeltown-born double Olympic gold medallist, Rodney
Pattisson.
The 51-year-old Pattisson, who in addition to Olympic Flying Dutchman
titles in 1968 and '72, also won silver in 1976. He was co-skipper of
Victory, Britain's 1983 America's Cup contender, and won world and
European titles from 1968-72.
Also enlisted, as coaches, are New Zealander Peter Warren, twice an
America's Cup competitor and winner in San Diego this year of the
Congressional Cup, plus Jock Wishart, veteran of the 1981 America's Cup.
The crew is packed with men boasting experience in world and European
championships. Others in the team, in various capacities, include naval
architect Paul Jeffes, who finished fourth in the British Steel
Challenge trans-world race, and tactician Nicky Kirk, a sailmaker from
Musselburgh who is European Impala champion.
''We believe that the professionalism of our campaign will attract the
#160,000 commercial backing we need to mount a reasonably competitive
challenge,'' says Smith. Gourock-born and educated, his first job was as
a boat salesman, but he branched into the leisure business with
amusement machines, and currently owns eight pubs/clubs and discos. His
company's long-term aim is to establish a centre of yachting excellence
at Largs, where they already have a fleet of five Sigmas available for
charter.''

THE practice ground at Glenbervie had been booby-trapped. Balls were
placed in alleged burrowing animal scrapes, in ground under repair on
and off the green, straddling out of bounds lines, in a bunker with one
covered by a divot and resting against a rake . . . and many more.
The experts were demanding rulings. Is it in or out? Is it a drop or
place and where? Is it free relief or not? Can you move the rake? What's
the position if the ball and divot move in the process?
What's more, they were arguing in mock Spanish accents. ''I no play
from there,'' insisted Charles Dernie, an acknowledged rules guru and TV
pundit on Sky, pretending to be Severiano Ballesteros, the bete noire of
golf referees worldwide.
Yes, it was back to the annual PGA Referees School in a bid to restore
pride after having failed to achieve the 70% pass mark in the
horror-strewn two-and-a-half hour final exam last year. At the time I
blamed the dead rat in a bunker for this disgrace.
The rat, you may remember, was removed prior to the player putting
through the bunker. It took some 15 minutes of searching through the
Rule Book and Decisions on the Rules of Golf to find the answer. (The
use of both these books plus the additional PGA Tournament Rules card
are allowed in the exam).
But with an average of three minutes per ruling, this degree of
fumbling uncertainty was not good enough.
The object of the exercise is to find answers to thorny situations
quickly and correctly as would be necessary in the heat of tournament
battle.
So, having now committed the 34 rule headings to memory to help speed
up the searching process, it was back for three more one-day seminars,
and more homework with questions like this:
A player hits his ball into a water hazard. He then plays a
provisional ball on to the fairway. He finds he can hit his original
ball out of the water hazard, but one foot would be in the water. He
takes a stone from the hazard and places it under the foot to keep it
dry and hits the ball out of the hazard. He then decides to abandon that
ball and continue with the provisional. What is the ruling?
A nightmare, you might think, what with moving a loose impediment in a
water hazard, building a stance, and then reverting to the provisional
after finding and playing the original ball. It must be a world record
for penalties at a single hole, but wait. The answer is this:
The one time you cannot play a provisional ball is when you are
certain you have hit the first into a water hazard. As a result what the
player thought was a provisional was in fact the ball in play (Decision
27-2a/2). His original ball was then a wrong ball, but you cannot play a
wrong ball in a hazard, and strokes played -- and, it follows, penalty
strokes incurred -- with a wrong ball don't count anyway (Rule 15-3).
When the player abandoned the first ball he corrected his mistake before
doing any damage and so he had unwittingly played under stroke and
distance penalty off the tee (Rule 26-1) and was about to play his
fourth.
Everyone clear on that?
Having reported failure last year, I can happily bury modesty this
time round and declare an 83% pass on the resit. The dead rat was there
again, and this time it was a breeze. Of course a loose impediment can
be removed from the bunker without penalty provided the ball is not in
it at the time (Rule 23-1).
Golfing companions, however, have not allowed vanity to set in. ''Your
mark means,'' they say with the same kind of stunning logic that you
find in Decisions on the Rules of Golf, ''that there's a 17% chance of
you being wrong.''
Still, if I were a PGA member the result would entitle me to don the
'L' plates and step up the next rung by going out in a small tournament
under the wing of an experienced referee. As a non-member, though, it's
the end of the road except for the reason for attending the course in
the first place, our Rules Corner feature on legal teasers which resumes
this week.
Should any misinformation creep in I'm sure we'll hear about it. Touch
wood, it hasn't happened yet.

<HEADLINE>Need for public confidence in auditing to be restored Ernst &amp; Young wants independent regulator</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAN MCCONNELL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978485397</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IN a move likely to rock the accountancy profession, one of its
biggest players, Ernst &amp; Young, is calling for an independent body to be
appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry and Bank of England to
regulate auditors.
The watchdog which the firm is proposing would have a similar status
to that of the recently established and controversial Personal
Investment Authority.
With issues such as predator pricing having attracted the spotlight of
publicity recently, Ernst &amp; Young believes self-regulation must come to
an end if public confidence in auditing is to be restored.
The accountancy firm's view is given in its written response to The
Audit Agenda paper issued by the Auditing Practices Board (APB), the
standard-setting body.
At the moment, auditors are regulated by the six professional
accountancy bodies in the UK, which have the power to suspend, expel or
fine members for misconduct.
Ernst &amp; Young proposes that an independent regulator should have
similar powers and believes such a body would inspire greater public
confidence in the profession.
Ian Lee, audit partner at Ernst &amp; Young's Glasgow office, said:
''Where we have regulation based on consensus among the regulated we are
inherently incapable of countering public criticism.
''However well we carry out our task and however well founded the
evidence might be that we are doing a good job, it is only if we have an
objective and external independent regulator that we are going to be
seen as having truly independent regulation on us.''
Highlighting the novelty of Ernst &amp; Young's stance, technical partner
Allister Wilson said: ''The other firms will say: 'We congratulate the
APB on this fantastic paper they have produced.' We are saying perhaps
the opposite.''
Ernst &amp; Young, which employs about 64,000 people in more than 100
countries, is concerned that the APB is being unrealistic in its belief
that it can make unilaterally significant inroads into meeting
ever-increasing public expectations.
The independence of auditors has always been a burning question. There
is, without doubt, the view that they would not dare bite the hand that
feeds them by becoming involved in disputes with a client which could
lead to the loss of the audit and fee.
This perhaps devalues auditors' ''true and fair view'' pronouncements
on company accounts.
Ernst &amp; Young's surprise call for an independent regulator perhaps
signals an acceleration of the profession's drive to regain public
confidence.
Professor Niall Lothian, the academic who was appointed president of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland last month, is aware
that a change of Government may throw up a raft of new public interest
considerations for the profession.
He believes the powers of chiefs of public companies, especially
utilities, to appoint and agree the fees of supposedly independent
external auditors must be examined by icas.
Other issues which are currently causing concern within the profession
are the provision of lucrative non-audit services to audit clients.
In its response to The Audit Agenda, the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants says the auditor of a listed company, or major
economic entity, should have no involvement in the marketing or
provision of other services to that client.
It says the Auditing Practices Board's recommendations relating to the
provision of non-audit services do not go far enough to ensure auditor
independence.
''Low-balling'' or predator pricing, where another firm undercuts the
fee  of the existing auditor, also raises questions about whether the
new auditor will compensate for its lower fee by selling other services.
Alternatively, the quality of a cheaper audit could perhaps be
questioned.

YOU mark your ball on the green, and set it aside a couple of feet.
When it comes to your turn to putt you forget to put it back and play
the ball from where you set it aside. What is the penalty?
THIS is one that foxed students at this year's PGA Referees' School.
The answer, you might guess, is a penalty of two strokes, but it is
under Rule 15-3 for, would you believe, playing a wrong ball. Some
explanation is necessary, and full details can be found in Decision
15-3/3.
When you marked your ball and set it aside, it was out of play,
therefore it was not the ball in play and, hence, it was a wrong ball --
a rare case of the right ball being the wrong one -- and if the error
was not corrected before playing from the next tee the penalty would be
disqualification.
This decision is not to be confused with the situation where you
replace the ball in the wrong spot and then play it, for example
forgetting you have moved your marker one putter-head length away. In
that case it still would be a two-stroke penalty (under Rule 16-1b), but
the ball is in play (see Rule 20-7b).

THE second Scottish Business Information Technology Show is being held
on May 10 and 11 at Ibrox Stadium, Glasgow. Sponsored by Axiom Business
Computers Limited, 71 Berkeley Street, Glasgow, this unique event
attracts major companies in the computer industry presenting
leading-edge technology aimed specifically at the business user.
Last year's show attracted more than 500 delegates from over 250
companies. All had a common purpose in wanting computer systems which
they can apply to their business to make a difference in efficiency,
greater intergration across applications, and improve the overall
productivity and profitability of their firm.
Among the major computer companies attending this year's event will be
such industry leaders as Microsoft, Novell, Apricot, Lotus and many
others providing keynote seminars and presentations which fully explain
the application of their systems in the business environment. Indeed the
Scottish Business IT Show is so highly regarded that many of these major
companies will be launching new products at this year's event.
Axiom's managing director, Mr George Blair, explained that:
''Microsoft, Dragon Dictate, Apricot, and Lotus all recognise that the
Scottish market is a very important one to be in, hence the reason that
they are so keen to be present at this unique event.''
Among the many highlights of this year's show will be displays by
Specialix who will be showing the latest ''ISDN'' digital telephone
network technology which allows users to access huge files of
information across telephone lines including images, video conferencing
etc. Also on show will be Apricot displaying the latest links to the
Internet and the practical applications business can make of the
information superhighway.
Dragon Inc. have developed the latest in voice-activated software
which allows hand-free dictation at speeds of up to 80 words per minute
and can also be linked to any Windows-based software in your computer.
Axiom are Scotland's only VAR for the product.
Informix, probably the world's leading developer of fourth generation
languages (4GL), will be showing their ''New Era'' Windows-based
development environment. Axiom, who are the sponsors of the show, are a
software house which has been developing in Informix for the last six
years.
Axiom have been operating since 1982 and have built up a considerable
reputation in that time for being suppliers of computer systems to the
legal profession (some 200 law firms use Axiom systems), and to general
business users where they currently have around 250 clients.
The company's intention in sponsoring the IT Show is to present a
unique selection of major companies to Scottish business and let people
see the diversity and range of computer products currently available and
the ways in which these differing products can be assimilated both with
existing computer systems and with new systems.
Cost control and management remain among the key issues for businesses
in the 1990s and purchasing the most appropriate computer system can
make a difference to a company's profitability both through increased
efficiency and improved customer service. Flexibility and the ability to
upgrade over time are crucial features in the purchase of new equipment
and Axiom, and the Scottish Business IT Show, reflect these needs.
Most business people recognise that, in an increasingly competitive
world, the company that invests in the right equipment for the job,
which improves its efficiency and profitability, is the one that is
going to survive. In the field of computer systems, customer support is
crucial throughout all stages in deciding which system to buy, potential
areas of expansion, the supply, installation, training by accredited
staff, and after sales support. Axiom provide all of these key features
and believe that quality counts in bringing the highest standards of
assistance to the customer.
These seminars have limited places so Axiom are urging all those who
are interested in attending any particular event to contact them
immediately by telephoning 0141 248 6699 or by faxing 0141 221 8262 to
reserve a place or to get further details of the event.

ONE of the world's biggest diesel-engine manufacturers has just moved
into Central Regional Council's newest industrial park, putting it
centre stage in Scotland's business and industrial scene.
It was vital for KHD Great Britain Ltd to have a central location for
its new service centre. And Broadleys Industrial Park, only minutes from
Scotland's motorway and rail networks and within 45 minutes' drive of
Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, was ideal.
''Also, it is a mixed-use industrial area,'' says service-centre
manager Derek Griffiths, ''not a row of industrial sheds. This is an
attractive location for our business and our stylish 10,000sqft unit
will complement the image we have already established for build quality
and fine after-sales care.''
KHD Great Britain is a division of the multinational KHD
(Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz) concern which has 80% of the European market
alone for portable compressors.
In recent years it has been anxious to take over full responsibility
for servicing and after-care of the engines and machines it supplies in
the UK, as opposed to relying on a distributor network, and the
establishment of Deutz Great Britain Ltd at Stirling represents a
development of this policy.
Derek Griffiths emphasises that the company looked at a large number
of sites before selecting Broadleys, which is being carved out of an
area of former farm and grazing land just outside Stirling.
''As a company which wishes to offer a speedy service and fast access
to parts and personnel, we felt it vital to be centrally situated,'' he
says. ''And this is an attractive and landscaped park from which it is
possible to be on the M9 and heading for all points north, or the M80 to
the south and west, within a few minutes.
''The main centres of Glasgow and Edinburgh are also within
comfortable reach and it is useful to have the choice of their
airports.''
The Stirling operation went into full swing last week along with
another new service centre in Aberdeen, run by Bill Scott. Together they
will cover Scotland and the North-east of England, offering improved
access to Deutz's diesel-engine technology and providing an exhaustive
store of spare parts.
Its Stirling premises are able to handle engines and machinery of all
sizes, up to and including mobile cranes and coaches, and to provide
complete overhauls. Full technical support is available across the
entire range of Deutz engines.
The Deutz group is one of the biggest names in its field, supplying
11,000 new engines to the UK alone each year, from forklift trucks to
hovercraft.
It manufactures a total of about 150,000 engines a year at its own
plants around the world, and when licensee operations and joint ventures
are included, for operations in countries such as China, Russia and
Japan, the number rises to nearly 250,000.
Broadleys Industrial Park is already promising to be one of Central
Regional Council's job-generation success stories, with the earlier
arrival of a company which specialises in designing and manufacturing
presentation boxes and the impending opening of a veterinary hospital.
The infrastructure is already being laid for the next phase of
speculative industrial development, to follow the #750,000 investment
already laid out. In all, 65 acres are available for industrial
development.
Stirling has about 95% of Scotland's manufacturing base within a
35-mile radius and is within easy reach of Grangemouth's port
facilities. All units built at Broadleys are built with flexibility in
mind, and with extra ground space provided at each one for possible
future expansion.
Deutz Great Britain Ltd is well aware of the need to provide for
future requirements, and has set aside about a third of its 10,000sqft
unit to allow for this. Another third is earmarked for parts storage,
and the rest is taken up by offices, training rooms, and the actual
workshop.
Engines are first steam-cleaned in an outside washing-down bay, where
special drainage ensures that no oil or petrol silts contaminate the
local environment and particularly the water supply.
After that they are taken inside, stripped, serviced, and reassembled.
Specially large steel doors have been installed to allow access to the
tallest machines.
Deutz's enthusiasm for Broadleys is welcomed by John Shaw, Head of
Property Services at Central Regional Council. ''It is most heartening
to hear a company extol precisely the virtues the council set out to
create at the industrial park,'' he says. ''The original master plan was
designed to create a flexible and attractive environment in which
companies could operate and develop.
''With the second phase of infrastructural work under way, Broadleys
is set to continue its success.''

The world has changed a lot over the past two generations -- not least
in the way marriages have become much more brittle affairs. And that has
brought about a new role for grandparents, finds Elizabeth Westcott.
CHILDREN today would have a hard time recognising the childhood world
of their grandparents: a world where people expected to live and work in
the place they grew up; where divorce was unheard of and single parents
were the exception; and where women were assumed to find fulfilment
within the prescribed roles of wife and mother.
Drastic changes to the shape of the conventional family have brought
with them new freedoms, opportunities to create individual lifestyles
when conventions don't fit; but they have also brought a sense of loss
and anxiety about family roles.
This anxiety is often keenly felt by grandparents. They can no longer
rely on the stability of their children's marriages or expect they will
live close by; but this does not mean that grandparents have been left
without a role to play. Families may have to work harder to maintain the
ties that could once be taken for granted, but there is a strong feeling
that the role of grandparents is becoming more significant.
So believes Nancy Foraker, a grandmother of two who also works as a
''rent-a-granny'', but she doesn't see her grandchildren as much as she
would like, because they live in England. ''I think grandparents are
more needed these days. That whole neighbourhood feeling, with children
playing outside, seems to have gone,'' she said.
''Women work, there are marriage break-ups, people move around a lot
more; all these things taken together make a big difference to family
life. There are a lot more lonely grandparents.''
Modern grandparents may find they need to create their own role in the
same way as their children are inventing different family models. In
each case it will define itself according to the unique needs and
problems of the family concerned.
One grandmother, Mrs Agnes Brown, helps her daughter-in-law, a widow,
dress and feed her disabled son every day -- and has done for the past
25 years. Other grandparents may only see their grandchildren several
times a year and still feel that this fulfils a psychological need.
Walter Nichol, co-ordinator of Family Mediation, Strathclyde, says the
increased rate of divorce means that grandparents can be unexpectedly
cut off from their grandchildren, and often don't realise how easily
this can happen.
''The major change has been separation and divorce between couples,
and the effect that has had on grandparents is significant,'' he
said.''Statistically, 40 to 45% of children lose contact with one parent
within a few years of separation -- and it's by no means just the
fathers disappearing. Almost without exception, those grandparents are
cut off from that child.
''It's very sad for the child, but also for the grandparents. I've
talked to many over the years and it's been a great sorrow for them.''
Walter Nichol believes grandparents need to practise restraint in
judging their daughter-in-law or son-in-law if the couple have decided
to part.
''If the prime response is a judgmental attitude in terms of whose
fault it is, then it sows the seeds of great difficulty in maintaining
the relationship with the in-law and the grandchildren. It's difficult
to stay neutral, because you automatically side with your own, but the
consequences of it are usually unpredicted. Relationships with children
mean so much to everybody; they are fundamental to how we see
ourselves.''
Children relate differently to grandparents than to parents. The day
to day anxieties of running a household are far less likely to impinge
on this relationship. Children can be cuddled, indulged and adored --
and handed back at the end of the day. As one grandmother, Janet
Thompson, points out, grandparents can be an alternative refuge for
children: ''When something upsets them they can turn to their
grandparents. Our grandson says he doesn't know what he'd do without
us.''
It is by no means a one-way street, either. Grandparents often comment
how much they enjoy watching their grandchildren grow, and find it often
puts their own mortality into perspective. Nancy Foraker says that as
she grows older she thinks more about her grandchildren; in them she
sees the future.
Grandmother of nine children, Sara McEwan has found the experience of
grandparenting to be a vital phase of her life. ''People who haven't had
it can't know what they are missing -- especially all the love and
affection they give you. Without them you'd be missing out on life, to
put it bluntly,'' she says.
McEwan says she sometimes can't cope with the changes that have taken
place in her lifetime. ''All these divorces! I'm married 56 years this
year, and if I could stick it, why can't the younger ones? I believe in
one marriage, one man, but maybe I'm old-fashioned.''
Janet Thompson feels the same. She thinks promiscuity is contributing
to failing marriages, and says that children are now far too often left
unsupervised, creating unforseen problems.
Alma Pursley feels young people'sattitudes have changed in a waywhich
is hard for grandparents to take on board.''Children are much more
independent. They know things at 10 that I didn't know at 20. They're so
cheeky now, and they're not afraid to show it. They'll look at you then
turn around and scratch your car -- we would never do things like
that.''
She says that while grandparents don't wield much influence over
children, the relationship between children and grandparents has in
general become much stronger.
''In my day we were taught to be seen and not heard -- we never opened
our mouths. There's more of a relationship now.
''I think being a grandparent is a very important experience. It's
another part of family life. There's the care and love, everything in
it. I just wish there was more discipline and people could go back to
what we were -- but there's no chance of that.''
Many grandparents feel they have a potentially more active part to
play with both parents working. Some grandparents are not especially
enthusiastic about childminding, having already raised their own
families, but others jump at the chance for regular contact.
Mary Given, grandmother of eight and great-grandmother of two, has
always had a lot to do with her grandchildren. Every Saturday she takes
two of them to swimming lessons and they stay overnight at her house.
''I enjoy seeing them have fun,'' she says. ''I would say with all the
mothers going out to work grandparents have a lot more to do; it's
better for the children to be with them than in the hands of
strangers.''
Dr Caroline Bamford, author of Grandparents' Lives, says that today's
grandparents are pioneering later life -- the ''Third Age'' after
retirement from paid work. It is only in this century, she points out,
that being a grandparent has become a long period in people's lives,
with many seeing all their grandchildren born and growing into
adulthood.
''For grandparents there's often a good feeling of life coming full
circle. It's a much freer relationship than what they had as parents;
having grandchildren gives them back something they missed when their
own children were little.''
In these ways, the relationships between children and grandparents can
be rich souces of joy and satisfaction. The feeling of being connected,
a sense of belonging, these are still human needs despite family
patterns being in a state of flux. For some grandparents it may mean
accepting the challenge of firmly staking out their own place, but the
rewards are great.

THE EXPECTED sterling crisis failed to materialise yesterday with the
London financial markets closed for a public holiday and European
markets preoccupied with the franc in the wake of the French
Presidential elections. However the pound is not out of the woods yet.
Indeed yesterday it was quoted at DM2.1890 against the German mark, just
a pfennig above its all time low.
When trading resumes today sterling could face further downward
pressure, a situation which could accelerate markedly on Thursday when
the Bank of England publishes its Inflation Report and the retail price
index (RPI) for April is published.
Some dealers think that sterling could test new lows around DM2.1500
in the near future.
The weakness of the dollar -- which is expected to continue following
last week's publication of a depressed US employment report -- will also
add extra downward pressure on the pound. Yesterday, sterling took
advantage of the soft dollar to add a cent to $1.6085.
Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England is widely thought, along
with some senior Treasury officials, to have disagreed with the
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's decision not to raise
interest rates above their current 6.75% level. Mr Clarke has refused to
disclose the advice given to him by Eddie George at last Friday's
monthly meeting.
If the Inflation Report together with the RPI data suggests that
inflation is indeed more of a problem than has hitherto been
acknowledged, then sterling could be in for a rough time. Underlying
inflation is expected to have dropped in April from 2.8% to 2.5% as the
VAT on fuel effect drops out of the annual comparison.
The Chancellor will have seen the April RPI data before last Friday's
decision not to raise interest rates. The decision; which wrong-footed
politicians, the financial markets and the media; has called into
question the anti-inflation credibility of the Chancellor.
This coupled with the Tory party's massacre in local government
elections in England and Wales last Thursday could start to unsettle
financial investors, particulary those overseas.

WHILE much of the nation enjoyed a day off yesterday, it was business
as usual for John Ashworth, chairman of Renfrewshire Enterprise, who was
making his final selections in the Renfrewshire Business Awards.
Sponsored jointly with The Herald, the awards have had an outstanding
response with over 300 companies making submissions.

FORGET Power Rangers, Ninja Turtles, Batman and Captain Scarlet; it
seems an increasing number of little boys these days are rejecting the
garb of modern-day TV heroes and want to dress up, instead, as old
fashioned cowboys and Indians.
Toyshops are reporting a steady growth in sales of fringed trousers
and waistcoat sets, feather headdresses and sheriff's badges.
Hugh McNaught, manager of the Jolly Giant toy superstore, confirmed
that there was a strong demand for bows and arrows, guns with holsters,
Indian tepees and cowboy hats.
Claire McMurray, of the Sentry Box toy shop in Glasgow, has just taken
delivery of a child-sized covered wagon -- the only one of its kind in
Britain. Interest in it has been so great that it shouldn't be too long
before she has to re-order, despite the #140 price tag. She's
anticipating a big demand for a new line in sew-it-yourself, Indian
style suede moccasins, complete with bead decoration.
The Perthshire costume manufacturing company DLR, which carries a
range of more than 70 styles of dressing up clothes for children, said
that while cowboy suits were always popular, there had recently been a
run on Indian maiden outfits for girls .
David Croan, buyer for Jenners renowned toy department in Edinburgh,
was interested to hear that DLR had been experiencing an increase in
demand for the native American look. It seems their customers may have
anticipated a dressing up craze which is set to take Britain by storm
when Pocahontas, the latest full length animation film from the Disney
studios, reaches our shores sometime in late summer or early autumn,
following its American release this coming June.
Pocahontas, you may recall, was the Indian chief's daughter from
Jamestown, Virginia, who, in 1614, married an English colonist, went to
London with him on a trade mission but died of smallpox shortly
afterwards, aged 22, and was buried at Gravesend in Kent.
Mr Croan revealed that manufacturers were already at work producing a
vast range of Pocahontas merchandise -- everything from dressing up
costumes and pyjamas to Indian princess dollies, schoolbags and lunch
boxes.
Commenting on the forthcoming Pocahontas film, Mr Barrie Cox, founder
of the Glasgow-based North American Indian Association, said: ''I'll
have to see it, but I shudder to think what Disney will have done to the
story.''
A Disney spokesperson was unavailable for comment.

JEAN SANDISON is building a career and finding strengths as a single
parent she never thought she had.
ISOMETIMES feel very much alone as a single parent, and worry about
whether it is a good thing or a bad thing. I look at people who might
feel sorry for me and think myself into their shoes: but hop out again
pretty quick. After all, I may not have a husband, but then neither do I
have a problem marriage, as so many seem to these days.
I am not saying I don't want to meet Mr Right someday; someone to take
over for a while, to share the load. But my life just now is certainly a
lot less hassle than it has ever been; and, most importantly, I have my
freedom and I have my daughter, Jessica.
Still, it would have been good to have some support when Jessica had
an operation in Aberdeen when she was very tiny. Thanks to the surgeon,
Mr Youngson, she made a full recovery and is fit and well. But when I
stayed in hospital I noticed Jessica was the only child on the ward
without a father.
I felt alone and wished someone had been with me when Jessica was in
surgery: the longest three hours I have ever spent in my life. I kept
thinking ''What have I done?'' but when I saw Jessica, and when she
smiled at me, it didn't matter any more -- in her own way she was
reminding me that I was the only person she needed.
When I wrote my first Singular Thoughts piece for The Herald I wanted
to explain what a young woman felt on learning that she was to be a
single parent. Now the term ''single parent'' has become less distinct,
the edges blurred by experience. My life has changed. I am more mature,
more responsible, I think.
Moving to Inverness was the best thing I ever did. Not that I am
suggesting every single mother moves here, but it worked for me. Maybe
it has something to do with Highland people. They are friendly,
welcoming, supportive, never over-judgmental, and the Highland capital
has great facilities for single mums.
Alone with a child in this day and age, you really have to persevere
and make plenty of sacrifices; and besides, if you want things to go
your way you have to make them happen. No-one else will. When they do go
according to plan it does a world of good for your personal self-esteem
and happiness.
I have made a home for my daughter and myself, and the activities I am
involved in include her. Slowly, and promisingly, I am building a career
and discovering personal strengths and abilities I never thought I had.
The urge to do something positive with my life has become an
irresistible force.
Leaving school at 16 hasn't helped and college or university, if ever,
is a long way off in my calendar. However, I am trying to pick up where
I left off and have enrolled with the Open University. I also recently
joined the Highland Print Makers, a super arts workshop in an old
building overlooking the River Ness, which encourages single parents.
You can screen print, lino-cut, etch, and there are regular tutorials
and art classes. The workshop offers a concessionary annual price of
#21, instead of the full rate of #42, and there are even concessionary
prices for class fees. I enjoy every moment -- and the companionship and
sociability that goes with it.
Paying for a babysitter is expensive but it is money well spent,
because Jessica also benefits from my interests: watching me work at
home, helping with paints, brushes and anything else she can lay her
hands on; and, often, creating far more presentable works of art than
mine.
Had I married and ''lived happily ever after'' I doubt if I would have
had these opportunities. People might say ''well at least Jessica would
have a father,'' but it is not about how things should seem, it is how
they are that matters. Had I not been a single parent these interests
would probably have remained pie in the sky.
I believe there is a reason for everything. Jessica is a bright,
intelligent little lady and she needs all the stimulation life can
offer. In my present circumstances I can give her this.
Too many people judge others' actions without thinking. I believe it
depends on the individual. And, after all, doesn't a mother know what is
best for her child? I think I do.

Enter the Rotosphere: MARY BRENNAN talks to Steve Hooper who gives
movement a new dimension his latest work.
VARIOUS events in choreographer Steve Hooper's life have left him
painfully aware of how much store he sets on dance-making. Tonight's
premier of his latest piece, La Belle Dame, at the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre is likely to remind him of one in particular.
There was a time -- in his mid-twenties -- when it looked as if
sudden, crippling illness would put a stop to even his most basic
mobility. The new career directions, the possible future in dance, were
in jeopardy almost before he had made any real beginnings. Luckily the
cause of his distress -- mercury poisoning -- was traced to the amalgam
fillings in his teeth. Once they were replaced, the misery in his joints
and muscles subsided.
But the prospect of losing all spontaneous freedom of movement had
triggered another response in Steve Hooper. He had started to plan an
alternative means of getting about. One that had aesthetic, as well as
practical features: the Rotosphere. Drawing on his previous work
experience as an RAF engineer, Hooper sketched out ideas for a
wheelchair where the occupant -- not just the wheels -- could move
through 360 degrees.
Forwards, backwards, head-over-heels. Suspended between two huge,
six-foot circles of metal, the travelling body would become part of a
visually exciting, mobile sculpture. The possibilities so intrigued him
that, even after his own recovery, he persevered with trying to get a
prototype up and rolling. But easier designed than done.
Hooper freely admits to feeling frequently discouraged at the long,
slow haul involved in pulling together the finance and the manufacturing
expertise. ''Oh yes. Months would go by. Nothing happening. And I'd
seriously long to pack it in. But . . .'' But he didn't. Two years on,
and at last the vision has become hard metal.
Two years . . . in which time Hooper's own development as a
choreographer has progressed in similar fits and starts. He speaks
feelingly, of the days, the weeks, that moped past between projects and
commissions. A bit of youth dance here, a women's group there -- the
longed-for chance, not just to put his own choreographic ideas into
practice, but to enjoy the routine of a structured work pattern. And
it's this routine, as much as the debut of the Rotosphere, which has
made creating La Belle Dame such an intensely affirming experience for
him.
''This five-week period has been bliss. It's partly to do with the
team dynamics. Everyone has really gelled brilliantly together. I've had
to work so hard, and that's been tremendous too. I've had to plan
things, be places, meet deadlines. Be part of a status quo, part of a
team that has things to do. And it feels so good. It's scary. Because I
feel it's turned me into a person, given me self-esteem, new priorities.
And I want to be like this all of the time.'' He pauses. There's an edge
of bleakness in what he's saying, a recognition that -- when the
production begins its life on stage -- this energising structure will no
longer fill his days.
The hope is, of course, that La Belle Dame will be something of a
career breakthrough. Certainly there's been a lot of advance interest in
the Rotosphere. Companies with disabled performers are keen to explore
new ways of moving beyond conventional wheelchairs. Hooper's contraption
offers them the possibility of experimenting with pure movement for
movement's sake. But, as he is quick to point out, the Rotosphere is not
the be all and end all of the piece.
''Really, the piece is about people who are completely at cross
purposes. It's about disfunctional relationships, non-communication --
and it doesn't have a happy ending.''
Nor, for that matter, is it a strictly literal reading of Keats's
poem. Poring over it again and again, Hooper started to form his own
versions of the main characters.
The Knight he saw as a mercenary. Someone brutal, yet potentially
vulnerable. Someone who uses women, yet who is utterly susceptible to
being manipulated by them -- enter La Belle Dame. Her very isolation
conjured up connections with the weird women of other times, the beldams
who were so often mistaken for witches and burned in what Hooper
considers a blaze of Christian misogyny.
He has dipped into pagan beliefs, the politics of religion, cycles of
the moon -- and here the appearance of the Rotosphere has plangent
echoes -- in order to construct a mesh of references to surround his
Lilith with all the enchanting powers ascribed to the alter-ego of Eve.
No wonder the Knight is putty in her hands.
Wheelchair athlete Evelyn Neave has been recruited to play the name
part. Hooper is eloquent in his praise of her commitment, her stamina,
her marvellous ability to carry out his choreographic intentions -- and
all without any of the dance training he and the others have at their
disposal. Craig McKnight and Peter Titus are the other on-stage members
of the company Hooper has called Soft Bodies Hard Metal Physical Theatre
Company.
Tonight's debut at the Festival Theatre will be followed by two
appearances at Mayfest (at the RSAMD on Friday and Saturday), thereafter
a date at Lochgelly and then -- well, nothing. Hooper tries not to let
despondency creep in before opening night has actually happened. But
there is a kind of irony in all this. The Rotosphere has been hailed as
a marvellous mechanism that will enable the disabled to move with new,
poetic versatility. But what will enable Steve Hooper to make his kind
of dance? One Rotosphere does not necessarily mean a bridge to instant
success.

THE arm of a bronze statue, blown off in a German bombing raid on
Glasgow during the Second World War, has been found on the banks of a
river.
It was presumed lost until Yorkhill Hospital worker, Mrs Isobel
Scobie, 54, discovered it lying in silt on the edge of the River Kelvin.
Peace and War, created by Paul Raphael Montford in 1910, was damaged
during an attack on the city on the night of March 13 and 14, 1941.
Searches of the devastated area near the Kelvingrove Museum and Art
Gallery following the raid found no trace of the arm. In 1951, Glasgow
Corporation, who owned the statue, commissioned its repair under the
direction of sculptor Benno Schotz, a member of the Royal Scottish
Academy.
The arm, cast with a broken spear to represent the power of peace over
war, belongs to one of four statues now standing at each corner of the
Kelvin Way Bridge in Kelvingrove Park.
Mr Julian Spalding, Glasgow District Council's director of museums and
art galleries, said yesterday he would be interested to see the arm.
However, he cast doubt on whether the statue would be restored to its
original glory.
He said: ''It is very unlikely that we would replace the repair unless
we found that the old arm is very much better and makes the sculpture
look significantly different.''
Mrs Scobie, who lives opposite the museum and art gallery, told
yesterday how she was walking near the river Kelvin when she saw what
appeared to be a hand clutching a broken spear.
''It was just the knuckles I could see holding the spear,'' she said.
''I managed to get down to the edge of the river but it was too heavy to
pull out.''
Mrs Scobie's nephew, Mr Angus McPhee, 18, dug the arm out of the mud
with a spade.
A Glasgow District Council spokesman described the find as
''remarkable'', adding that the council's legal department would check
to see who was the rightful owner of the arm and what should become of
it.

George Hume reports on a new widget which could make your Naional
Lottery dreams come true -- or perhaps not
THOSE punters with ''systems'' who are sufficiently misguided as to
put their shirt on them share a fate similar to that of the professional
bank robber who risks all for the big tickle, sticks up a safe
containing only small change, escapes into the arms of the force's
finest, and spends the next 10 years perfecting his mail-bag stitch
while wondering what went wrong.
The moment of truth for the system-driven gambler is generally less
dramatic, amounting to little more than his racing certainty tripping on
an unpunched return ticket for the bus home when just a nose from the
post. But the effect is the same -- nae money. Such is life -- long odds
and fat bookies.
You too may have observed a quaint aspect of the betting world -- the
fact that the majority of punters prefer to travel in the comfort of a
charabanc whereas bookmakers stoically make do with the rigours of a
Rolls Royce. Even the National Lottery, in place to keep the Churchill
family in the style to which it would like to be accustomed while
allowing the nation to support a worthy cause, has not noticeably
changed the chasm between those who stake their money and those who use
it to buy steak.
Now all that is to change, for word has leaked out from the Isle of
Wight, aided by an advertising campaign and press publicity, that a
pocket computer, said to have won millions for lottery punters abroad,
is to go on sale throughout the land later this week. The Loto-Master,
we are assured, has been a huge sales success.
Developed in Canada by Alex Moosz, a ''Quebec-based electronics
genius'' -- their words, not mine -- and a team of engineers, it took,
apparently, 14 months of cleverness to perfect the little gadget that
may put you in a vicuna coat and leave young Mr Churchill with an empty
filing cabinet and a full wallet. An Isle of Wight distribution firm has
bought the UK rights to the computer and, for a mere #24.99p it could,
as the saying goes, be yours.
What you get for your #24.99 -- very nearly half a year's flutter on
the National Lottery if you have been able to restrict yourself to just
one stab a week -- is the programming of your favourite numbers into a
spread of combinations to ''bring multiple number betting down to an
affordable cost''. Whose affordable? DKS Distribution's affordable? Alex
Moosz's affordable? George Hume's affordable?
Now, being that rare thing, an innumerate among illiterates, I can't
even begin to understand how the Moosz widget works and, I suspect, I am
not intended to. Mine not to reason why, mine but to spend and try. But
I do remember one Horace Batchelor, a man who sold, by means of pirate
radio and a voice tuned to sound like a carrot grater being drawn down a
harled wall, a system for winning the football pools. Remember them?
Hundreds had won thousands the Batchelor way, or so we were told, but
today, as then, I still do not understand why Horace, for it was he,
stayed up to broadcast his wares at midnight if his system was such a
runaway success. Why was he not long tucked up in bed, his duvet stuffed
with fivers, rather than trying to flog his system to an audience
largely made up of teenagers too young to gamble -- youngsters who were,
in any case, saving their pennies for the National Lottery to come and a
chance to help defray the costs of the young Mr Churchill's divorce.
Thus, still suspicious, I wonder why the boys and girls at DKS
Distribution are giving you the chance to bring the National Lottery to
the point of meltdown when, equipped with a boxful of Mr Moosz's genius,
they could hit the jackpot themselves, and bring untold wealth and
never-ending happiness to the Isle of Wight.
I also marvel at the apparently feeble state of the nation's
collective greed after learning that #17m of National Lottery winnings
are lying unclaimed; the notes unspent, the joy unspread, the waiting
not yet taken out of wanting. What on earth are National Lottery punters
up to? Has ennui now reached such a level that the winners are just
checking their lucky numbers, buying a Ferrari down the phone by quoting
their card number and waiting for the money to be stuffed through their
letter box in bundles?
Some punters have let things go so far that they have just nine days
left to claim a total of #600,000 -- all won in the first six draws
after the lottery began last November. If prize money is not claimed
then it, and accrued interest, goes to the National Lottery Distribution
Fund which does just that -- doling it out to five good causes among
which, undoubtedly, Churchill's male heirs would wish to be counted.
That alone, I would have thought, should spur the reluctant winners to
overcome their shyness, rake out their tickets, climb on their bikes and
get down to their local National Lottery office fast. There are no
pockets in a shroud.

Scots blockbusting author Margaret Thomson Davis has been through many
pains and traumas in her life -- but is always willing to hear others'
tales of woe. For it is her ability to work that suffering through that
has brought her most of her professional success, discovers Anvar Khan.
BETTE DAVIS once said that if the home was a jungle a child was better
prepared for the world. ''I often say to beginner writers that an
unhappy childhood is an asset to a novelist,'' announces the author of
15 novels and more than 200 short stories. Storytellers aren't born,
they're made.
War pushes the best men to the fore, but the players who dominate the
work of Margaret Thomson Davis are weak in mind and spirit. No-one faces
life head on, they lie to themselves and others. Davis, herself, is
strong. But moral vacuity is what she knows best.
Her talent for presenting the human dilemma was honed by an abused
childhood. Her need to record life is an act of self-preservation. She
combines storytelling with knowledge collated from a life which has
encompassed tragedy. What she has never felt, she researches.
In her bright, white living room in the South Side of Glasgow, where
portholes into a thriving family life -- gilded oval frames of friends
and grandchildren -- stand on guard, Davis interviews various members of
society about their life. Married, church-going women chat about illicit
sexual adventures, security men list the diplomatic skills necessary
when dealing with gangsters. To register disgust, for example, at a man
who says he's killed another would be to judge him. Davis can't judge,
it would impair her ability to reflect.
''I'm ill-equipped for a relationship. I'm a warm, affectionate
person. I love my friends, I get terribly fond of my men friends as
well. I can feel passion. But when I'm alone with a man and he makes an
advance to me, I'm a child again. I don't know what to do, how to react,
how to cope with the situation. Now that I'm a granny, I may as well
resign myself; it's too late to do anything about it.'' She hoots, falls
back into the arms of her comfy chair and returns to sit on the edge.
Writing may be cathartic, but readers of Margaret Thomson Davis are
consistently traumatised by various incidents in her books. A Herald
theatre critic once fainted during the DIY abortion scene in the stage
version of Rag Woman, Rich Woman. ''Gritty'' is an adjective often used
to describe working-class drama which appals the liberal mind. But it's
a cowpat of a cliche. Davis's characters are not heroic. They are very
small people. None is free from the intrusion of the past into the
present. And it is into their world that she draws you.
''I never had an abortion but I had a miscarriage and I was whipped up
to Stobhill. In those days you felt as if the staff were all punishing
you, that everyone there had done it to themselves. There were a lot of
people who had. It was through one of them that I heard the story about
doing it with knitting needles in the washhouse.''
There are novels which are intellectual exercises. Academic attempts
at fiction. Overworked paragraphs, references to highbrow culture, a
smartass style designed to showcase the writer. Margaret Thomson Davis
tells tales. She doesn't allocate half a book to the description of a
character; they materialise by what they do and say. Her protagonists
are both the product of their circumstances and masters of their
destiny. Just like real people.
She surveys mankind from a zenith built on emotional experience. When
Davis was a mite of five, her mother used to vanish without warning.
No-one panicked; they just waited until she came back home. But Davis
became obssessed with her mum leaving her.
''My suspense would gather and increase as I came home from primary
school and as I reached the close I'd look through the letterbox, and if
I could smell disinfectant and saw newspapers covering the linoleum, I
knew she'd gone. When she left my father she'd scrub her way through the
whole house first. Then I'd sit on the stone stairs. A child has no
concept of time and as far as I was concerned she was gone forever. I
had no idea what to do or what was going to happen to me until a
neighbour took me in. I was very sensitive to every nuance of feeling
and that was the beginning of being a novelist because that's what you
have to develop. Your parent is the only one you know to love, you see.
''You get your self-confidence undermined by a host of small things. I
would sit at the window and see my father coming along the road from his
work on the railway. I was the bearer of bad tidings. He'd know my
mother had gone. It would cause him a lot of trouble because he had to
arrange for someone to look after me when he was on nightshift.
''Sometimes I wasn't looked after. Sometimes I was abused. As a young
child you don't know what's happening; you can't tell anybody because
you don't know if it's wrong, although you sense it is. There's a fear
element and a lack of self-worth. You imagine it's your fault and you
feel dirtied. It's well-known now that someone who has been abused has
these reactions, however illogical, but to a young child that is how you
feel. That is you being formed.''
Davis jumps as the telephone rings. It's on a yellow, plastic,
detachable tray which is secured on the left arm of her chair. It's the
second call in an hour. Davis constantly fiddles with spectacles hanging
on a chain around her neck. Just like the past, they help her to see.
She's wearing blue-bead stud earrings and a blue-bead necklace and M &amp; S
satin slippers with bows. A navy Moschino handbag expires on the floor
beside her, yielding a purse and hankies.
Margaret Thomson Davis has a big personality. Her gallery of friends
testify; they are from all countries, professions and classes. She would
not be able to conduct any research if people didn't want to talk to
her. But she can be naive.
For nine years Davis had a penpal in Russia, for example, before she
found out he was a KGB agent. When she complained to her friends that
she had no idea, she was chastised for not seeing something so obvious.
He had to be a spy, they chorused, because he was a member of the Soviet
Union who could talk with foreigners and travel without restriction.
Davis has the intelligent ability of being able to take people as she
finds them. She is quite happy with what you want to tell her. She is
above being suspicious. Davis has been through so much, she's not scared
of what she doesn't know. It also gives her the air of a
psychotherapist, who allows folk to waffle on about what they think is
important. You can almost see the files being laid open, the drawers
slamming and summary notes being taken in her head while she listens.
''Tolstoy once said all art is the communication of feeling and that
is the basis of how I write. I remember an old black range and standing
up in a zinc bath. The bath was right up against a man's knees. I don't
know who he was, but I knew there was something frightening in the way
he looked at me. He carried me to a dark room and put me in a
hole-in-the-wall bed. I remember crouching in the darkness holding a
blanket up to my mouth. As I talk about it I can feel my throat
constricting through fear.'' Her eyes water, Davis swallows and looks
embarrassed.
''I use all these feelings in my work. I feel as if I have made
something positive of them. I loved my mother then and I loved her till
the end, as I did my father. As a child, I felt for them. My mother was
very gregarious though my father was shy. She thought he was quiet at
social functions out of badness, but he had a very dogmatic Scots
upbringing, a bully of a father. I used to go there for New Year's
dinner and all the grown-ups at the table sat with their heads bowed,
even his wife. The family were all cowed.''
Davis married the first man who asked her, to escape her parents. The
marriage dissolved in her teens. Her second, 30-year marriage was to a
taxi driver who had as much respect for her as her childhood abuser.
''What I've got now,'' she asserts, ''I've worked for and got by
myself. When I was married, I was undermined. My second husband felt
insecure because I had a talent. Some people, to feel big, have to stand
beside a dwarf. And if they can't find a dwarf, they'll make one. That
was my situation. He knocked me down at every turn. I gave him a short
story to read and he tossed it aside. When I was married I was making
money but I was putting it into the housekeeping because he would say
'Is that all you've got for the dinner?' I was trying to impress him. He
wasn't earning the money; I was. But he wasn't giving me credit for
that.
''When things got so bad and my health was being affected, my doctor
said 'You are getting destroyed. If you don't get out now, you're going
to die'. I couldn't cope on my own, but things were so bad I thought
they couldn't get worse. But I hadn't any money. I walked out without a
teaspoon. I persuaded the bank manager to give me a loan, got this flat
to rent. That was 10 years ago. I had just enough to buy something to
sleep on. I hadn't any money to buy food.
''My landlady heard what a state I was in and she came to my door one
day with two carrier bags full of tins. She handed me an envelope and
said 'Take this in the spirit it's given. When you get big money for a
film or a book, pay me back', and inside was a cheque for one hundred
pounds. From a landlady! I burst into tears. Just after that, a
paperback went up for auction and I got a great sum of money. Wonderful
woman that. There's somebody up there. If we believe in God, the time we
live is just a flash. All that's happened in between, it's nothing
really.''
There are areas of life which are predictable. In Hold Me Forever, the
lead female character, who was ignored by her mother as a child, begins
to ignore her own. History repeats itself, as patterns of abuse osmose
from generation to generation. Negative behaviour can be traced, but
there are miracles for which no-one is accountable.
After Davis left her second husband, her son Ken, from her first
marriage, asked if she'd mind if he tried to find his real father. She
had heard he'd joined the metropolitan police in London, married again
and had a son and three daughters. Ken wrote to the chief constable and
soon received a letter from his real father asking if they could meet at
Waverley station in Edinburgh. Ken had always maintained that the only
reason he wanted to meet his father was to see if he was bald, because
baldness was hereditary. In fact, it was a very emotional meeting. ''You
were a baby, after all,'' sympathised Davis, ''when he last saw you.''
''No, it was more than that, mum,'' said Ken. ''He was weeping.''
Davis then heard how her ex-husband had recently lost his son from his
second marriage, Ken's half-brother, in a motorbike accident. ''I was a
broken man, on a bottle of whisky a day; that was the saving of me,
being given another son,'' Ken's father later explained.
At that, Margaret Thomson Davis, successful female novelist and friend
of a KGB spy, turns to me in an attempt to explain her craft. ''Now, you
see? I couldn't put that in a book because it's too unbelievable,'' she
said.

THE Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
yesterday said the VE celebrations should spread a message of peace.
In his sermon at Scotland's memorial service at St Giles' Cathedral,
Edinburgh, yesterday, the Rt Rev Dr James Simpson quoted the late John
Lennon when he urged: ''Let's do all we can to 'Give peace a chance'.''
He stressed that peacemaking was not something to be left to the
great, noble or powerful, but something on which everyone could work.
''We are all called to be peacemakers . . .
''Being peacemakers involves seeking to eradicate the violence of
injustice.''
Encouraging peace meant supporting organisations that seek to promote
peace, such as the UN and the Red Cross,and encouraging councils and
Government to use their influence in the interests of justice for all.
Earlier, Dr Simpson said that, while commemorating the victory of 50
years ago, those who were still suffering from the ravages of war around
the world should not be forgotten.
Remembering those who fought between 1939 and 1945, he said they had
served because their horizons extended beyond themselves.
''War is not John Wayne heroics. At best, it is a tragedy, at worst --
as we have been reminded in Bosnia, Chechnya, and Rwanda -- an
obscenity,'' he said.

Space travel is set to take a major leap forward with a successor to
the Shuttle, reports Chris Boyce
ON JUNE 27 last year, an experimental rocket vehicle suffered an
accident during an evaluation run at the White Sands testing facility in
the United States. An explosion blew a hole in its side. What happened
next was completely unlike what might be expected.
Instead of becoming engulfed in a cloud of fire and fumes, which might
be expected, the rocket shuddered, steadied itself, and settled gently
back to earth close by its launch point in a near-perfect landing.
Everyone watching realised immediately that here was something very
new, and perhaps the way of the future.
The days of Nasa's Space Shuttle are now numbered. It was a concept
based on 1970s technology which has now all but run its course.
There are no plans to build any new shuttles; even the near clone
built by the former USSR sits mothballed at the Russian spaceport at
Baikonur. Yet there is a demand for a replacement vehicle -- one which
will do the job better than the Shuttle, cheaper and much more reliably.
Ironically, the design which is currently exciting many in the
American aerospace industry is based on a much earlier concept of
spaceflight -- the 1950s science-fiction rocketship. The Delta Clipper
will lift off straight up and land the same way, not gliding into a
landing strip like the Shuttle, but straight down, under power, on to a
pad.
The facility gives the Clipper -- the model is being tested this month
at White Sands, New Mexico -- much more flexibility than any previous
spacecraft. Clipper should have the same flexibility about landing that
the RAF's Harrier jump-jet has, or even a helicopter.
However, the real difference with this machine lies in its engines, in
its airline-like procedures for servicing and, crucially, in its
construction. It is made from extra-lightweight materials. This
combination could reduce the cost of reaching space by as much as 90%.
Imagine what the costs of air travel would be if, after every flight,
the engines had to be taken apart and rebuilt, the entire aircraft
repainted, parts had to be recovered from the sea, and the whole
take-off configuration reassembled before it could fly once more.The
reduction of costs could make space flight as accessible as air travel
is today.
This is not the only successor to the Shuttle which is being
considered. Many people, particularly in the US Air Force, prefer a
winged vehicle. One design under consideration is for a craft which
would take off and land like an airoplane. The big problem of taking off
loaded with the amount of fuel needed to reach orbit has been approached
from a new angle.
This vehicle would take off with its fuel tanks almost empty, but
would refuel in mid-air. Then, with its tanks full, it would blast on up
to space. It would employ a lot of the same kinds of materials used in
the Clipper design, but might need a good bit more research and
development.
Problems with noise pollution would have to be looked at closely. One
of the reasons the supersonic Concorde never became the success its
designers had hoped, lies in the resistance put up to having sonic
booms. These are now strictly controlled over the continental USA, and
legislation might have to be reconsidered if the Air Force spaceplane
was to be adopted.
The Clipper is comparatively a low-pollution vehicle, as it takes off
and lands vertically, and the sonic boom will be heard only in the
immediate launch and landing areas. Another environmentally friendly
aspect of Clipper is the fuel which burns off as simple water vapour in
the atmosphere.
McDonnell and Boeing have announced a partnership to compete for the
contract to research the concept. They now have all the information they
need from the one-third scale vehicle and arein a position to move on to
the next stage, the full-size -- 33 feet -- vehicle which will test the
viability of the concept.
If they succeed, being aircraft manufacturers, we are unlikely to see
the handful of craft that represents the complement of today's Space
Shuttles. We are more likely to see a fleet of rocketships instead, with
''spaceports'' serving every major urban area in the world.

STEPHEN McGINTY meets a young artistic director hungry for success.
IT wasn't deliberate, but at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe last year
Cathy Boyd, artistic director of Theatre Cryptic, teased tramps. To
promote their previous production, Bonjour Tristesse, they printed fake
French francs. ''We'd see tramps picking them up off the street and
skipping down the road . . . I felt terrible,'' she says on a break from
harassing Saturday shoppers.
To promote Lovers in 1992 she manacled two actors in the window of a
bridal wear shop and was banned from her local family planning clinic
for taking more than 4000 condoms for distribution. At last year's
festival she persuaded the chain Deli France to offer free food at
lunch-time shows, while for Child-Lover, her latest play, Canadian Club
and Clearly Canadian will be serving the drinks.
You see, Cathy Boyd has the pluck of the Irish. She's no artistic
wallflower wilting while waiting for an audience. Child-Lover has eaten
a year of her life and she wants people to see it. ''You can't sit on
your arse and wait; you've got to convince people.'' Which is why French
actress Loeiza Marig Jacq was in the window of Frasers on Buchanan
Street, Glasgow.
In a form of corporate sponsorship, the store's general manager is
allowing the cast to perform. So while Loeiza smiles, tilts, turns,
spooks and stares at the gathered shoppers, Cathy weaves in and out,
thrusting flyers into reluctant mitts. While explaining the story to
startled shoppers she tends to break the sound barrier.
Child-Lover was commissioned from author and poet Michele Roberts and
tells the story of Annie and Daniel, a childless couple. In an attempt
to conceive, Annie pays a clandestine visit to the mysterious lady of
Noire Fontaine where she is tricked into a dreadful promise.
''The show tells us about two people who can't communicate. You hear
in their separate monologues that they both feel the same way and want
each other to talk about how they feel. But they just can't, and they
think the baby is the solution, but it's not.
''Music was the language of the piece. What I was looking for was
music that speaks more than words ever could. From the very beginning of
Cryptic I've worked with an original score. For Child Lover David Paul
Jones has composed the original score and will be performing it with
cellist Anthea Haddow.''
Also joining an international cast of French and Canadian actors is a
Danish opera singer playing the role of Lady Noire. Marianne Cotterill
performs extensively through-out Europe and has just released her first
solo CD, Airs by Handel and Purcell.
The play unravels on a stage constructed from 28 woven-fabric doors
and promises to be visually stunning. For Boyd, actions and performances
convey much more than words. ''There is a certain creative process at
Theatre Cryptic. I believe it's important to give artists room to use
their own creativity. I ask them for feelings and what they bring to it
I work with.''
The company is Cathy Boyd's baby and her vision is the creation of
truly international and multi-cultural pieces which can tour through-out
the world with a five-year shelf life. Child-Lover will be the first
production to be seen outside Britain, though both The Lovers and
Bonjour Tristesse were invited to tour abroad.
''I'm never happy with my work and I just felt that the company wasn't
ready to tour abroad, but with Child-Lover it's time.'' Boyd, who was
born in Belfast, still runs Theatre Cryptic from her flat in Glasgow's
West End, and draws the smallest wage. ''To be honest, it's more
important that the piece is a success than if I eat.''
Somehow, you imagine that even a global hit would be unlikely to stop
Boyd from staying hungry.
* Child Lover is at the Tramway, Glasgow from tomorrow to Saturday at
9.30pm, and on Sunday at 7.30pm.

THE VE Day celebrationsbrought a surprise reunion for a veteran of the
Lovat Scouts.
Major Lyon Balfour-Paul met up again with his former batman, Mr Iain
MacLeod, whom he had not seen for 50 years, during an anniversary event
in Beauly, near Inverness.
Major Balfour-Paul, 81, was in a parade which marched through the
village and laid wreaths at the Lovat Scout memorial.
Mr MacLeod, originally from the Highlands, had travelled up from his
home in Peebles to attend the VE celebrations in the North.
''I was standing by the Post Office when this man recognised me and
walked up and we started talking,'' said Major Balfour-Paul. ''It came
completely out of the blue and it was a splendid surprise.
''I didn't recognise him right away but he recognised me, which is a
great compliment after all this time.''
The pair had joined up at the same time and served together during the
Second World War. They parted company at the end of hostilities when the
regiment moved on to Greece and Major Balfour-Paul remained in Austria
to take up another post.
''We had not seen each other since then and we have not even been in
touch -- after the war I just lost touch with him, so it was marvellous
to see him again -- and he looked in fine shape.''
The wreath laying at the Lovat Scout Memorial had an added poignancy
coming just weeks after the death of Lord Lovat, who lived in Beauly.
Lord Lovat, whose father formed the Lovat Scouts, led troops on D-Day
landings in Normandy.
''It was a sombre occasion with an added poignancy coming so close to
Lord Lovat's death,'' said one of the parade organisers. ''It's a great
pity he did not live to celebrate the anniversary.''
However, his widow was among a large crowd, which also included
serving and ex-servicemen, youth organisations, and British legion
members, which attended the parade.
Lady Lovat had asked organisers to attend the ceremony, although other
members of her immediate family were out of the area and unable to be
there.
The ceremony was one of many events held across the Highlands to mark
VE Day.
The Royal British Legion held a commemoration ceremony at the war
graves at Tomnahurich Cemetery in Inverness when schoolchildren laid
flowers in tribute to fallen soldiers.
A thanksgiving service was held in the Old Parish Church, Nairn,
followed by a parade, and a VE Day bonfire was lit at Nigg Ferry Beach
in Ross-shire with a collection for veterans' associations.
Street parties were held around Aviemore and the event was also marked
with a release of balloons at the town's war memorial.
In Grantown, a beacon was lit last night in the town square followed
by an Old Tyme Concert at the British Legion.
Newtonmore Golf Club held a special VE Day medal competition followed
by a family barbecue.

Murray Ritchie reports that Jacques Chirac presented himself as all
things to all Frenchmen and must now deliver
JACQUES CHIRAC's pledge to make France the engine of the European
Union is reminiscent of John Major's promise to put Britain at the heart
of Europe. It could also be as meaningless.
In Germany, which really is the engine of Europe, the new French
President's good intentions will go down well with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, whose first consideration in all matters European is the attitude
of France. For Britain's battered Conservative Government, the
Gaullists' victory in France was the best possible outcome but any
portrayal of Chirac as a Eurosceptic ally of the British is too simple
by half. (Major need only try raising the idea of French backing for the
British idea of slashing spending on the EU's common agricultural
policy.)
Jacques Chirac is, after all, the man who said he wanted to see France
as the motor of Europe, France as the champion of the Franco-German
bedrock of Europe, and France as a new ally of the United Kingdom in
critical policy areas.
For Jacques Chirac, expressions of intent have always come easily,
almost glibly. He supports higher wages, says he will increase France's
minimum wage, frowns on global spending cuts, prefers no income tax
increases, supports Maastricht and Nato, and is against poverty. Like
any good political opportunist he is probably against sin, too,
especially if there are votes in it.
Major can take greatest satisfaction from the fact that Chirac is not
Lionel Jospin, who would have chosen Jacques Delors as his Prime
Minister. That raised the prospect of a French socialist President
across the negotiating table in the EU with his Euro-federalist premier
on hand to cause trouble long after the British thought they had seen
the last of Delors.
Major avoided that nightmare by a measly 5% of French electoral
opinion but his worries are not resolved. The differences on European
policy between Chirac and Jospin are probably not all that wide.
Chirac does share some of Major's suspicions about Brussels centralism
and, like the British Tories, favours a more inter-governmental approach
to EU decision-making over the German federalist ideal. He wants more
focus on the workings of the Council of Ministers where the real
decisions in the EU are still taken, mostly in private, and he opposes
-- like Major -- substantial new powers for the European Parliament.
The big difference between Major and Chirac is that when the going
gets tough Chirac's Eurosceptics can be slapped down. With a huge
majority in both houses of the French parliament and strong support in
most of France's regions, Chirac is in a position of great power.
Barring mishaps he can enjoy the luxury of seven years to pursue his
ambitions. His presidency truly is the beginning of an era and a final
break with the long years of Mitterrand's forced compromises. No other
leader of a large European democracy has such domestic political freedom
extending into the next millennium.
In the wider European context this freedom is curtailed because EU
decision-making is increasingly becoming collegiate, despite British
reservations. His views on more majority voting and consequent
reductions in the national veto in EU affairs will be interesting.
Chirac now looks like being Major's best bet for a strong ally in the
coming scrap over voting rights.
Chirac is unlikely to try to push the EU around, British-style. Most
continental Europeans take the view now that the days are gone when the
enlarging community can be manipulated by any one country, no matter how
powerful. Even the Germans, who pay for much of the EU, accept that a
community of 15 now and possibly 25 or 30 in years to come must take
decisions by collegiate procedures; in other words, they know the EU
would seize up without more majority voting. For all his rhetoric Chirac
cannot change that.
Major's pity is that he might not be around to ask for help when the
crucial decisions are made. Remember, Major has already sworn in advance
to block any moves to reduce the British veto or increase the European
Parliament's powers. Many in Brussels take the view that the simplest
way to resolve the apparently unresolvable in next year's
Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) -- barring a British climbdown --
will be to wait until after the British General Election.
Chirac's style so far has been to promise everything, sometimes
recanting quickly as he did with his offer of a referendum on a single
currency. Now he has said, as opposed to promised, that he is inclined
to a referendum on the Maastricht renegotiation, a fact which could
thrown the EU into confusion and dispute. Some nifty backtracking is
expected on that idea now that the election is in the bag. He did, after
all, support Maastricht in the 1992 French referendum.
Chirac's firmest commitment is to tackle unemployment which must bring
him into early conflict with European moves towards economic and
monetary union (Emu) which the French, nationally, are reasonably
supportive. To achieve Emu the French must, like everyone else, cut
their budget deficit in line with the guidelines laid down in
Maastricht's so-called convergence criteria. Chirac knows that obedience
to the letter of Maastricht will do little to create jobs.
Other nations face the same challenge. How the new boy at the EU top
table will approach this tough issue will be watched with interest
throughout the community. Should he decide to cut up rough he will
quickly find an ally in London, but most Brussels observers assume he
will simply behave pragmatically which is his style and that he will not
risk isolating France in Europe in the way Major has done with Britain.
Emu is almost a holy grail in Brussels these days. French sabotage of
the ideal would leave Chirac rather like the British Prime Minister,
whose promise to be at the heart of Europe is now a joke. France cannot
distance itself from the EU while being its engine or staying faithful
to its understanding with Germany.
More constructively, from a British viewpoint, is the fact that Chirac
will genuinely want the UK and France brought closer in areas such as
defence and foreign affairs. Major and Francois Mitterrand pioneered the
principle, citing their joint status as Europe's nuclear powers, but
political ideology tended to dampen their enthusiasm.
Chirac will probably reinvigorate efforts in this area, giving London
and Paris a potentially decisive influence in the IGC where the EU's
failing foreign policy is going to be a dominant issue. His probable new
Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, currently the Foreign Minister, is known to
favour more Franco-British co-operation in defence and, as a Europhile,
will encourage his new President in the ways of constructive engagement
in Brussels.
Chirac's alternative choice for Prime Minister is the Eurosceptic
Philippe Seguin who, significantly, is being discounted for job. Indeed
all the speculation from Paris is that Chirac is working on assembling a
strongly pro-European Cabinet. (Mind you, so did John Major in his early
days.)
For the moment Jacques Chirac can bask in his success, which has been
achieved by a combination of determination, style, daring and reckless
commitment. As a wily old campaigner he knows that saying only that
which pleases comes with an inevitable political price. Winning the
presidency was the easy bit -- the real work starts now.

ST MARY'S Cathedral, 300 Great Western Road, is Mayfest's newest
venue, and a good one, too. St Mary's developed an enlightened approach
to art with its 1990 City of Culture commission for chancel murals from
Gwyneth Leech. Now Leech has organised a rolling programme of
exhibitions, beginning with the SSA, who for several years have made a
point of coming to Mayfest from their Edinburgh base.
Yet several exhibits look so at home as to be permanent features of
the church. Pete Bevan's simple gazebo sculptural form, a sort of
21st-century Madonna, has real presence when placed near the altar.
Virginia Izzo, Paul Furneaux and Susie Paterson use warm colour to
echo the lovely stained-glass windows, while Sigrid Becker's To
Everything There Is a Season is beautifully displayed in a side chapel
surrounded by candles. Stuart Duffin and Colin Wishart both employ
lyrical monochrome to great effect. Lys Hansen's Elegy with its feet and
nails and Eddy Summerton's Catherine Wheel update age-old Christian
imagery. George Wyllie and Kenny Munro do not allow a religious setting
to overawe their usual panache and sock it to us with red neon and
humour: the rock of ages was never like this before.
For all we know, some artists may be atheist, but faith comes in many
forms and each artwork has an unmistakable sincerity.

WITH a sense of regret, I feel as though I've been saying the same old
things about Rhona Cameron ever since she burst to stand-up prominence
during the 1992 Edinburgh Festival. ''Engagingly-conspiratorial manner .
. . limpid eyes that have a cheeky twinkle to them . . . possessor of an
easy, winning smile which masks an ability to be brutally shocking.''
I've been praising her with these somewhat worn-out observations for
the past three years because Rhona's stand-up career sadly hasn't, in my
opinion, made the advances it should have done; Rhona's material hasn't
evolved at a rate commensurate with her natural flair for conversational
comedy.
Having seen her on Sunday night, though, I can now report that Rhona
Cameron has made the great leap forward. She's still as twinkly, smiley
and disarmingly-shocking, but she's more relaxed, more open, more
honest.
Rhona's current material these days isn't so much based on
observational routine as on the bitter realism of personal experience,
magnified and skewed. There is thus much mirth in Rhona's strange desire
for sideburns and her propensity for self-reinvention on foreign
holidays. There is her terrified awareness that year by year she is
turning into her mother.
And come to think of it, there's someone else Rhona seems to be
turning into. Slicked-back hair. Slow, mesmeric smile. Starry presence.
Ready charm. Bless-a mah soul! I have seen Elvis Presley miraculously
made young in 1995, and he is from Musselburgh, not Memphis, and he is a
she . . . and Rhona Cameron will have you all shook up with laughter.

CHARLIE YOUNG reckons Hitler was getting personal. Less than two weeks
after a doodlebug demolished the house next door to his in Soho, he was
evacuated to Sevenoaks, where his new home was flattened in another
raid.
''Blew me right out of the bath it did,'' he says with a throaty
chuckle. ''I still think he was trying to get me.''
Mr Young, 63, is standing on a corner in the Woodberry Down estate on
the edge of Hackney. There is supposed to be a large VE Day party nearby
but no-one knows anything about it.
''Street party? Not up here. Everyone's just enjoying the day off.
It's all happening down in the centre but then there's a lot of tourists
at that. Up here we're just taking it easy. If there was a party I'd be
there, wouldn't I?''
Where tens of thousands flocked to Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace
yesterday to watch the marching bands and the royal waves, the rest of
London seemed strangely inured to VE Day proper -- flattened by a
weekend of pomp and circumstance and unseasonably warm weather.
On Oxford Street, the steady drone of a Lancaster bomber barely raised
the glances of shoppers. A few carried plastic Union Jacks, curling
limply in damp palms. Some sported plastic bowlers and the odd red,
white, and blue T-shirt.
Up in Stoke Newington, officials at the Oak Tree Community Centre were
a little disappointed at the turnout to their VE Day celebration.
They had wanted to hold the party in the street but the police refused
because children and main artery traffic do not mix.
''All of the things going on in Hyde Park I think are really for the
privileged few,'' said Mr Brian Wilkerson, 64, the entertainments
chairman. ''The ones that can afford the 25 quid or so to sit in the
front row and see the Queen.''
Behind him, a group of children are slavishly copying the twists and
turns of an aerobics instructor to the pounding beat of a Michael
Jackson imitator.
''We are having a tea dance for the old folks later,'' he said
apologetically, gesturing to the drooping string of bunting and
hand-made VE Day signs.
''We did want it to be more authentic but it costs about #40 to hire
an old uniform or a forties-type dress and not many can afford it.''
Mr Wilkerson has lived in the area all of his life and he points down
the street towards his old home, where he helped dig his mother out of
the rubble after a direct hit. She had been trapped for seven hours.
He remembers the community spirit of the time where neighbours rushed
to save lives and prized possessions and he remembers even more clearly
the real VE Day.
''It was real hope and glory stuff. They had barrels of beer rolled
out and the whole street was up -- quite a feeling.''
Meanwhile, Alice, 7, has been driven out into the sunshine of Bethune
Road by the boom of the aerobics backing track. She thinks it is a pity
they were not allowed out on the street, where there is more room to
play, but she claims to know what the party is all about. ''It's the
war, isn't it, the big one,'' she says.
Back at Woodberry Down, Charlie Young thinks London has just about had
enough in the way of celebrations.
''I think, you know, after the Jubilee and all and the other royals, I
think London is all street-partied out. It's a shame, really, when you
see these old ones with the medals on and marching. It's very moving. I
mean that's what it was all about, wasn't it?''

Viva the Featherstonehaughs! Mary Brennan on the group bringing Las
Vegas action to Scotland.
ACTUALLY, none of The Featherstonehaughs has ever been to Vegas . . .
Come to that, neither has the company's founder and choreographer, Lea
Anderson. But isn't the latest touring show called Featherstonehaughs Go
Las Vegas . . . ? Well, yes -- but as Anderson cheerily points out,
there are real advantages to giving the field trip a miss. It leaves you
free to explore the fantasies and myths that are clustered round the
place.
''It's an English look at Las Vegas,'' she says. ''It's to do with the
images we've picked up over the years from television, films,
newspapers, and magazines. All those glamorous stars -- like Frank
Sinatra, Dean Martin -- who've 'played Vegas'. The bright lights, the
almost Disneyland feel to it all, as if it's a fantasy park for
adults.''
Except of course, that the glamour -- like the dice -- is heavily
loaded. Once Anderson and the company got down to devising the show they
kept finding that a darker side shadowed almost every angle of the
glitz-and-gambling experience. For one thing, there are many more losers
than winners. Las Vegas stakes its livelihood on collective gullibility.
Despite being surrounded by obvious proof that the odds are against
them, folk still believe that if they keep trying, they must surely win.
''The lottery started up while we were getting ideas together,'' says
Anderson. ''It just brought it home to us. The whole business of making
gambling a family entertainment. It's this thing about methods of
presentation, how you sell something to an audience, how you make it
easy for them to be swept along.''
Bit by bit certain themes started to emerge from the brainstorming
sessions. Dance sequences evolved that encompassed both the high-octane
excitement and cheesy insincerity of Las Vegas. Sandy Powell arrived and
yanked the lads out of their regulation dark suits and Doc Martens.
For this show they would face the music (by Steve Blake and Drostan
Madden) in crossed cheques of primrose yellow and baby blue. And just to
make sure their toes twinkled, even in the low lights of iniquitous
dives -- white patent shoes by cult cobbler, Patrick Cox.
Like so much that goes down in Vegas, there's a hidden price to be
paid for cutting an expensive dash -- the shoes are, according to
company member Dan O'Neill, fairly tricky to dance in. Especially in
something as demanding as the number he tags as Jerry Lewis. This one
sounds a killer-diller. ''I've been on the bike, down the gym, working
for this one,'' laughs O'Neill. ''We've done it several times now and
it's still a case of pushing, of really sweating, having to dig deep to
get it.''
Ask O'Neill why he stays with the Featherstonehaughs pronounce it
Fanshaws -- unlike the dance, the name is easier than it looks -- and
the answer would partly echo his description of what Jerry Lewis
entails. ''Lea's stuff is really exciting, challenging. It doesn't go by
the usual rules. It feels very contemporary. She has a real awareness of
what's going on, what the current buzz is. And she brings that into the
work.'' I've never been bored onstage in her work.''
Nor have audiences been bored by what they've seen so far. Shows like
the highly successful Big Feature delighted onlookers because the lads
didn't come on like esoteric troupers. Instead, this bunch of blokes
looned into view, as if en route to the dogs. Six of them. All different
sizes, all uniform in their Camden Market dark suits and heavy boots.
The orchestrated movement just seemed to sprout out of their
goings-on. One minute these guys are sprawled on a park bench, the next
minute there's this funny, touching dance, that's full of gawky
camaraderie and a sudden outpouring of hidden feelings.
O'Neill agrees that this apparent ordinariness has been a real plus in
winning audiences, whether in small community venues in the extreme
north of Scotland or in city-centre venues in Germany, where they have
built quite a following.
''I love it when people don't think we're dancers. It somehow makes
the whole thing feel fresh, unexpected. A lot of folk can't imagine,
either, that it's a woman who's the choreographer. But that's one of the
really amazing things about Lea. She'll come into the studio with gems
of ideas and there'll be this very social process -- everyone making
contributions -- and by the end, she'll have decided what she wants. But
it's as if the personalities we have, the differences between us as
performers, have been sewn into what she's choreographed.
''You do get to be yourself, and I feel very fortunate being part of
that.''
Luck, it seems, is a lady called Lea Anderson. The Fanshaws are
bringing their slice of Las Vegas action to two Scottish venues. You too
can be a winner -- buy a ticket!
The Featherstonehaughs Go Las Vegas can be seen at Eden Court Theatre,
Inverness tonight, and the MacRobert Arts Centre, Stirling on Tuesday
May 16.

Obituary / RAY BUCKTON
RAY BUCKTON, one of the last of the left-wing, strike-leading union
general secretaries of the seventies and eighties, has died after a long
illness. He was 73. A big, bluff Yorkshireman, Buckton led one of the
smallest, but in its day very influential unions, the train drivers'
union Aslef.
He attracted the anger of the travelling public when he led strikes in
1973, 1979, and 1982, in pursuit of pay and conditions deals for the
enginemen.
While many felt strongly about the inconvenience caused by the
disputes, ridiculing the drivers as greedy Luddites, Aslef fought to
preserve its position as a well-paid craft union as others overtook its
members in the pay league.
Mr Buckton may be best remembered as the man who presided over the
1982 two-week rail strike against ''flexible rostering''. At the time he
was variously described as ''public enemy number one'' and a ''national
disgrace''.
He was pilloried in more than 200 cartoons in the national press
during the period, and a former chairman of British Rail once shouted at
him: ''You belong in the steam age.''
On his retirement as general secretary five years later, Buckton was
philosophical about the abuse and said he had never felt bitter. ''I was
expressing the views of my executive committee and my membership, and I
took the flak. I accept that,'' he said.
It was often assumed that Aslef, with its membership dwindling rapidly
-- brought on by line closures and the dropping of double-manning in
locomotives -- would be swallowed up by a larger union, but this was
skilfully avoided by Buckton in his 17 years as general secretary.
He was also active in Labour Party politics and in the wider trade
union arena, becoming president of the TUC in 1983. One of his
disappointments as TUC president was the inability of the union movement
to give more support to the miners during their two-year national
strike.
The National Union of Mineworkers' president, Arthur Scargill, paid
tribute to Buckton yesterday, stating: ''His unswerving dedication and
loyalty to not only his own members but all workers, will never be
forgotten. The trade union and Labour movement has lost one of its truly
great leaders, and I have lost a highly valued friend.''
Buckton was born in agricultural Yorkshire and left school at 14 to
work as a groundsman. But a boyhood fascination with trains took over
and at 16 he became an engine cleaner.
His interest in politics followed, and he became a union branch
secretary at only 19. He won office as a Labour councillor in York, and
became the council's youngest alderman.
The current Aslef general secretary, Lew Adams, described Buckton as a
giant of the trade union movement. ''He stood for peace and
international reconciliation, not least in South Africa, where he was
devoted to the cause of the anti-apartheid movement,'' he recalled.
John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, said Buckton's courage in
battling cancer was typical of his style as a trade union leader. ''He
combined determination with cheerfulness and militancy with unfailing
courtesy. He was a leading TUC figure for many years and we salute his
memory.''
After retiring, Buckton and his wife Barbara briefly ran a restaurant
in England before moving to Portugal, where he died on Sunday. He is
survived by his wife and sons Trevor and Ian.

SONGWRITERS' singarounds are popular in Nashville clubs, a chance for
country hitmakers to test their latest songs on their peers. For one
night only The Ferry joined the Nashville circuit, except the songs
offered had been rigorously market-tested, many to the point of earning
discs embossed with various precious metals.
Pat Alger, Jon Vezner and the man they call simply Kostas are dashed
good songwriters but as performers, while enjoyable, they are no great
shakes, singing sufficiently well to put their songs in the shop window.
In Vezner's case, he has something of an in-house shop window, being
married to Kathy Mattea, who polished Where Have You Been? into a
transatlantic (and evidently transclyde) favourite.
This sad, sentimental tale of ailing grandparents and Vezner's
throwaway, ironic All Things Considered typified the breadth of the
writing on show. Despite Nashville's hits factory image, these are no
formula merchants. Kostas, whose high, keening voice was the most
convincing, sounded equally at ease on the campfire singalong Lonely
Side of Life and the more sophisticated If You Think. Happy to mention
the singers such as Dwight Yoakham who made him big bucks, he was
self-effacing enough to co-credit his dog with a lesser-known song which
suggested the mutt had been listening to Buddy Holly.
Alger, whose ''customers'' include Crystal Gayle, Don Williams and
Mary Black, and whose simple but apposite guitar embellishments added
colour to the others' songs, has a pleasant, soft voice which proved
tough enough to take on the rockin' Smalltown Saturday Night. But his
functional singing of Lone Star State of Mind made it hard to put Nanci
Griffith's angelic version on hold.

THE Princess Royal yesterday joined 600 ex-servicemen and women and
politicians at Scotland's VE Day anniversary service in Edinburgh.
As the veterans gathered at St Giles Cathedral, they were entertained
by the Army's Lowland band, drawn from the Scottish southern regiments,
who played a selection of war-time favourites.
Young soldiers of today lifted wheelchair-bound heroes and heroines of
50 years ago into the historic church, which houses many of the
regimental flags of the armed forces of Scotland.
While enjoying the reunion with their colleagues, it was a sombre
occasion for many, who said they were there only to remember.
The Princess, who was accompanied by her husband, Commander Timothy
Laurence, read a lesson from the New Testament during the hour-long
service.
They were escorted into the cathedral by the minister at St Giles, the
Very Rev Gilleasbuig Macmillan; Mr Norman Irons, the Lord Provost of
Edinburgh; and Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Among the politicians who attended were the Shadow Scottish Secretary,
Mr George Robertson; SNP leader Alex Salmond; the leader of the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace, and his predecessor, Sir David Steel.
Scottish Office Ministers Lord Fraser of Carmyllie and Air Commodore Sir
Hector Monro, who read the lesson from the Old Testament, were also on
hand.
Mr Robertson said later that more could have been done to mark the day
north of the Border. ''I think it is a pity so many of the events are
based in London. I think a bit more effort should have been made by the
Government to have a bigger celebration,'' he said. ''A lot of people
here feel that Scotland was missed out, although the Scottish role in
both the victory and fighting was huge.''
The veterans, who joined comrades from France, Norway, and Canada,
gathered after the service at a special reception in Parliament Hall,
where they spoke of their memories of the war and the victory
celebrations -- and the tinge of sadness they felt.
Telegraphist Robert Knox, 72, of Armadale, West Lothian, was a member
of the crew of the motor launch which brought the first German submarine
to surrender on VE Day back to Britain.
Mr Knox, who served with Britain's Coastal Services, said: ''Today is
a happy day and a sad day too. My brother was a glider pilot who was
taken prisoner at Arnhem but my younger brother was killed in Burma. He
was only 19.''
Those who gave their lives in the war were also on the mind of former
Royal Dragoon Guard, Mr George McNulty, 70, of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire,
who served with the amphibious tanks division. ''When I go to any of
these services, I do it for the boys I left behind. Our regiment really
took quite a hammering,'' said the past chairman of the Normandy
Veterans' Association.
Mrs Anne Ross, 72, of Blackford, Edinburgh, was a signaller with the
Women's Royal Naval Service at Scapa Flow, Orkney. ''I was on duty on VE
Day. There was no difference, except I put out the signal which had come
from the King, to 'splice the mainbrace'. We still had to put the
signals out,'' she said.
Resplendent in Highland dress, Mr James Ferguson, 75, of Edinburgh,
served with the Lothian and Borders 19th Armoured Car Company. He served
with the Eighth Army at El Alamein and took part in the Italian
Campaign. ''When you come to these things, you think of the people you
left behind,'' he said.
Victory Day in 1945 held bitter-sweet memories for the Polish soldiers
based in Britain. Mr Stan Klimowiczi, now 83, who settled in Glasgow at
the end of the war, said Stalin had banned the troops from taking part
in the celebrations in London.
He said he was about 50 yards from the King and Queen on the day.
''Every nation was marching but we were not there,'' he said. ''We are
very pleased today that we can join with the Scottish veterans.''
The efforts of the ladies behind the scenes in the newly-formed
Women's Voluntary Service, were also not forgotten. Some of the women,
now in their 70s and 80s, who are still members of the organisation, now
the WRVS, chatted to their patron, the Princess Royal.
When war broke out, the group had been in existence for only a year.
It carried out a multitude of duties, including dealing with evacuated
children, running forces' canteens, and escorting troops.

NO doubt about the hit of the night, and the best performance, at the
Bearsden Burgh Choir's concert at the RSAMD on Sunday. A bright,
bustling, lively (and loud) choral performance of Leonard Bernstein's
Chichester Psalms, with singing of beautiful purity from boy soprano
Kenneth Reid, electrified the packed house.
It would be wrong to say that Bernstein's Chichester Psalms is a
neglected piece. It constantly surprises me, however, that it is not
more frequently performed; sometimes I suspect that it is almost locked
away in the ''more serious'' category of his compositions, along with
his symphonies. Yet Bernstein's Hebrew masterpiece is saturated with
some of his most tuneful writing and Latin-American rhythms that could
have come straight out of West Side Story.
The strings of the scratch orchestra, directed by James Hunter, at
last got their act together for this piece. Earlier, in Haydn's Nelson
Mass and Te Deum, there had been really ropey playing from the band,
rather spoiling the full effect of the chorus (which has a huge impact
the the confines of the Stevenson Hall). I know these bands -- all
professional, well-known figures -- have a single rehearsal to put the
show together, but in the music of Haydn there is no hiding place.
And the effect rather marred the performance of the soloists, Irene
Drummond, Christine Cairns, William Strachan, and Frank Carroll, where
there was, anyway, an unbalanced ensemble, with the men lightweight and
underpowered.
In the middle of all this, the choir hosted a soulful and characterful
performance of Poulenc's Oboe Sonata by Katherine Mackintosh, a finalist
in the Young Musician of the Year competition.

MANY and varied were last night's pre-gig indicators, leading to a
degree of expectant confusion before the famously-reclusive Ms MacColl
made her long-overdue indoor concert debut in Glasgow.
Aye, Kirsty had been OK at yon Fleadh on a wind-blown Glasgow Green,
but what would she be like in a packed and sweaty club?
Her soundman gave no clues, opting to play a tape which refused to
advance beyond the dread year of 1972. Drearsome amounts of Doobies. To
much Dan.
Offensively anonymous, last night's support act, the Libertines, then
trolled on to reveal their tragic ambition: instead of trying to be ace,
they wished to become one-hit non-entities Ace.
Thankfully, they went away. A tape of fifties-vintage orchestral salsa
played. Eventually, Kirsty's band appeared. A power trio. Only the
guitarist looked like Harry Nilsson used to.
And the shaven-headed drummer resembled a hip hop frontman.
But then Kirsty began to sing and all was certainty and assurance.
Her voice is a thing of unadorned folkiness: plaintive, sinuous,
reedy, and strong. Her songs similarly manage to blend disparate
qualities, being familiar and fresh, witty and distinctive.
And these songs are borne to surprising conclusions by an unstoppable
narrative force which utilises pithy couplets and an ironic,
self-accusatory tone. ''I've been a token woman all my life. A token
daughter, a token wife.'' In short, Kirsty MacColl is a timeless Randy
New-woman for the here and now.
And if ever some reconstituted version of the Monkees needs a bagful
of insistent, pithy songs -- Unpleasant Valley Sunday perhaps -- Kirsty
MacColl has written them already.

WE are seated on pews. In our centre is an altar-like table standing
on a rough wooden floor. Sand is all around. In cavernous rooms beyond
we hear the ominous echo of a military drum or the plaintif chorus of a
solemn psalm.
There are many things to recommend this stunning production of Arthur
Miller's witch-hunt classic, but so much of its success is due to the
crypt-like location, one arch down from the regular theatre, a
claustrophobic place where we too gather as a community to wonder how
much we can trust each other, that it's impossible to imagine how well
it will transfer to Edinburgh's Traverse after its Mayfest run.
If you have the choice, see it now. If you don't, see it anyway.
Andy Arnold's production for the resident company, out in force with a
17-strong cast, is dark and austere in tone. Performances are raw and
impassioned, at first a touch too earnest but, as the feverish momentum
of the play builds, with accusation piled upon accusation, lie added to
lie, they become compellingly pitched. Certainly by halfway through the
second act the show is hurtling along, a tense and rigorous court-room
drama, the audience hanging on to every word.
If it misses anything it is the full sense of burgeoning adolescent
sexuality, that potent force that should fuel the young girls'
accusations and dramatic performances in court while unsettling the
steady order of Miller's God-fearing Salem.
In its place is a feeling of the catastrophic effects when those
traditionally dispossessed suddenly find themselves in possession of the
reigns of power.
Magnificent stuff, doing all the things great drama should -- engaging
us politically, emotionally . . . utterly. Even the trains out of
Central Station seemed to rumble their approval.

Perth and Kinross can be tapped as a political barometer for
possibly the only time in its history as the by-election looms.
Jennifer Cunningham looks at the constituency and its people
LAST autumn, when the parks department of Perth and Kinross District
were growing the plants for the flowering city's early spring display,
they chose black and gold pansies. They did not know then there would be
a by-election in May; now every hanging basket in the town centre is
spilling over with those cheeky little pansy faces in SNP colours.
This is not Monklands. A poster war is more likely to irritate than
excite the burghers of Perth. The champion of champions in the Scotland
in Bloom competition should perhaps say it with flowers. Is it
significant that only the baskets hanging round Frasers department store
are trailing blue and white?
If this were England it would be middle England, heart of the Tory
vote. In Scotland, the rules are different, but much as the tourist
board likes to call Perthshire the heart of Scotland, this is not middle
Scotland, but the meeting point of Highland civility and the east coast
merchant tradition. By the standards of this stable part of Scotland a
seismic shift has taken place in the population since the 1963
by-election which returned Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who sloughed his
peerage to take on the task of Prime Minister. There was never a
scintilla of doubt that he would be returned.
By the second of the two 1974 elections the Scottish impatience with
both Labour and Conservative parties was expressed as strongly in this
well-heeled rural constituency as in the mining and fishing areas which
returned a record team of Nationalist MPs. Nicholas Fairbairn was
elected in Kinross and West Perthshire but with a margin of only 0.2%
from the SNP contender.
Neighbouring Perth and East Perthshire returned Douglas Crawford for
the SNP with a margin of just under 2%. The significance is that the new
Perth and Kinross seat formed by the 1983 boundary changes was formed
from 65% of the old Perth and East Perthshire constituency and 46% of
what was previously Kinross and West Perthshire. Only a month ago, the
local election results showed the SNP power base had spread from Kinross
to Perth itself and the new unitary council will be SNP-controlled.
The parliamentary constituency, however, does not match the local
authority boundary -- and is the more interesting and representative for
that. It stretches eastwards through the farming-turned-commuter
villages of the Carse of Gowrie to Longforgan, dormitory for Dundee,
skirts round the north of Perth westwards to Crieff, Comrie, and St
Fillans, back south round Auchterarder and along the northern side of
the Ochils to Kinross.
The tourist board's boast that it is the Highlands in miniature: loch,
mountain, river, moor and castles all within an easy drive is true up to
a point, but even the northern fingers stretching towards Loch Tay do
not include the kind of hill farms which have been hovering on the brink
of viability for generations. It does include the whole of Perth, in
statistical terms affluent, but with small pockets of deprivation.
Unemployment is lower than the national average, but so are salary
levels.
In the city of Perth, unemployment is 7.5%, compared with the Tayside
average of 9.9%. The highest rate in the constituency is in the
well-heeled spa town of Crieff, where the figure of 9.9% represents the
particular difficulties of rural areas. Tourism overtook farming as the
largest single employment sector five years ago.
It is a service-based economy, with banking, finance, and services
accounting for 41% of employment and distribution, transport and
catering 30% in a district council analysis last year. Despite a few
recent knocks, such as the loss of the Dewar's bottling plant,
employment levels have remained stable, largely because of the small
size of the manufacturing sector, now 11%.
The confident county enjoys flexing its electoral muscle. While happy
to vote for the impeccable Scottish, farming, and political credentials
of Douglas-Home, they would also vote for the urban sophisticate
Fairbairn while deploring some facets of the self-styled bon viveur and
wit, because they recognised they were getting a first-class legal
brain.
To many, the candidate is as important as the party. Douglas Crawford
clung closely to the tartan Tory mould during his brief incumbency. A
republican, left-wing Nationalist candidate is a new kettle of fish and
a distinct challenge to the old order in West Perthshire, who regard the
Queen Mother, born just over the hill in Strathmore, as one of them.
Country habits die hard, but the explosion of new housing on the
western and northern fringes of the city testify to an influx of
population which has made it Scotland's fastest-growing town for the
best part of a decade.
''If the developers had their way, Perth would be twice the size it is
now. The main headache for planners is how to fit everybody in who wants
to live here,'' said one local government official. Placed top of
several different quality-of-life surveys, it is a question Perth has to
address seriously.
''People here recognise that they are fortunate, but they are not
complacent. Twenty years ago you could have called it smugness, but no
longer. They know it is a tough world out there, but they know they have
something worthwhile,'' said one adopted son. Even the farmers, who have
some of the finest agricultural land in the United Kingdom, will admit
that life in Perth and Kinross is more than fair to them.
At the west end of Strathearn most families have moved out of dairy
farming, but some of the bigger farms still mix dairy cattle with a
broad arable range. Everywhere the crucial question in this by-election
is the Union, but here it is the consequences of that for the farmers'
voice in Europe that is uppermost.
At the council elections they returned one of the two Conservative
councillors to the new authority, but many have doubts about the new man
they are being asked to send to Westminster. The perversity factor could
be significant. There are indeed only two things farmers will concede to
pollsters: they don't like being taken for granted and they take a very
long view of things.
''Since it's a by-election and not a General Election, there will be a
protest vote. What worries farmers about the SNP is that Scotland on its
own would not have a strong enough voice in the framing of agricultural
policy, which is at the heart of Europe. Some Scottish farmers have
benefited from the French farmers' lobby, but they are the very small
ones who have to have some other source of income,'' said one who wasn't
going to give anything away.
Only a few people will acknowledge that Perth has its drugs problem
''and not just in the worst areas''. There are two areas synonymous with
deprivation, but even they look respectable by city standards. Perth
folk think so too: recent refurbishment and tree-planting in Muirton has
enticed so many people to park there that traffic wardens had to be
called in. Among the struggling unemployed and single parents there is
some resentment that improvements are only cosmetic. Two urban-aid
schemes however, will continue with council backing.
Pressed to name a grouse about the town, one businessman said the only
complaint he heard regularly was that the curlers took up too much time
on the ice rink, squeezing out the skaters, eventually adding that
through-traffic was an increasing problem.
It makes good business sense to give your customers what they want.
Perth folk have always been good at business. The insurance giant
General Accident was founded there 110 years ago ''and we have never
seen the need to move away'', said their spokesman. Now employing over
1000 people in the town, including a handful of the highly-specialist
top level of accountants, lawyers, assessors and technocrats required to
handle the ''world headquarters'' part of the business, they are a very
stable influence in the town.
Few people are willing to give up the company mortgages and the
recreational facilities to move elsewhere. Other companies to keep their
historical base in Perth are similarly prestigious. Matthew Gloag, the
wine and spirits company, is building a new headquarters as is Scottish
Hydro-Electric. Caithness Glass is a major employer and it is the base
of the entrepreneurial bus company, Stagecoach.
Almost everywhere there is praise for the currently Tory-controlled
district council, which has recently extended its provision of
first-class sporting facilities not only to the larger communities such
as Kinross, but Aberfeldy and even Letham now boast brand-new fitness
and leisure centres.
What is not said, but hinted at, is that the kind of Tory they expect
to stand in Perth and Kinross is of the paternalist Douglas-Home sort
and not the self-seeking Thatcher/Major sort.
The most astonishing measure of political change in 15 years is that
in West Perthshire, the air laden with the scent of gorse, they weigh up
Labour and Tory tax policies, but otherwise do not have a lot of
argument with Tony Blair. This may be the only time in history Perth and
Kinross can be tapped as a political barometer. The newly-forged leaves
of the copper beeches ripple in the wind and there is a daftness in the
air.

WHO could envy the Prime Minister this week? On Friday, John Major
must rise to address the Scottish Tories in Glasgow, a bare week after
the party's disastrous showing in the local elections of England and
Wales, and only weeks after the calamitous rout in Scotland.
After 16 years in office -- even fighting on boundaries gerrymandered
by their own Ministers -- the Scottish Conservatives failed to win
control of a single council. They lost their last European parliamentary
seats in 1989. They lost their last region in 1986. They seem shortly
set to lose Perth and Kinross in the looming by-election.
One may have little empathy with Conservatives. And yet their
political tradition was once an honourable one. Men like Stanley
Baldwin, Winston Churchill, and Alex Douglas-Home brought dignity and
humanity to politics. Hundreds of Scottish Conservatives have toiled
hard, for little reward, in the service of their communities.
After 16 years of oppressive and increasing seedy administration in
London, one has to take a certain grim satisfaction in the latest routs.
And yet the general tendency, today, to use local polls as a referendum
on national government is deeply regrettable. People should take an
informed interest in the affairs of their local communities. And a
Tory-free Scotland, while darkly satisfying in the short term, could
threaten the public interest in the long term. A monopoly of the
ideological left is not good news. A one-party state like Glasgow is a
negation of democracy.
Yet, sure as eggs, there will be nothing on Friday for the sturdy old
contemptibles in the Royal Concert Hall but the same tedious nonsense
from a Prime Minister who seems incapable of deducing the obvious. If
the Scottish nation is deaf, their occupying generalissimo is blind.
The Ministers of our Government cannot understand our country. At many
levels Scotland is relatively prosperous. Unlike over-crowded England,
we enjoy a superb environment; clean air, ample parklands, vast tracts
of wild country, the best drinking water in Europe. The recession of the
early nineties struck far less cruelly here than in England. Spared the
worst excesses of the English property boom, we have been spared, too,
the nightmares of negative equity and wholesale repossession. As far as
the Highlands are concerned, this Government -- blunders such as the
Skye bridge apart -- has a surprisingly good track record; it compares,
indeed, very favourably to that of the Wilson and Callaghan years.
Tory rule has coincided with the stirring revitalisation of Glasgow.
With the completion of wonderful new transport links -- the Kessock
Bridge, the revamped Strathclyde rail network, the Edinburgh City
by-pass, the unrecognisably modern and efficient Caledonian MacBrayne.
The arts flourish north of the Border as never before. If you have
employment and money -- and that, of course, is a big if -- the Scotland
of 1995 is a delightful land in which to live.
Except, of course, that we are under an alien and blundering
Government which seems determined to insult Scottish perception and
Scottish aspirations at every turn. In a nutshell, the Major regime
appears incapable of understanding any voting dynamic beyond that of
bread and circuses.
There are several things Mr Major should understand about the Scots,
and if he did he might on Friday come up with a very good speech.
First: there is a natural Scottish distaste for a certain kind of
political leader -- the kind who has reinvented their character, their
voice, their bearing and buried the attributes with which they were
born.
Mrs Thatcher was detested here because of her obvious nouveau riche
remoulding. By 1979 she betrayed little of the Grantham grocery. Her
heavy vowels, her concrete perm and her tones of feigned sincerity sank
north of the Border like a concrete kite. At least she had a Norman
Tebbit. Today the whole Cabinet seems one holy huddle of arriviste
re-treads and the impact is hugely unpopular.
Second: the Scots are long since beyond the days of Pathe newsreels,
when virtually every character in public life seemed fresh from the
pages of John Buchan. The days of the pukka, stern-jawed North Briton
are dead. Ian Lang and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton have great virtues.
But, as far as the voters are concerned, they represent a risible
anachronism. It is striking that the few long-term Tory survivors in
Scotland -- Bill Walker and Allan Stewart, the late Sir Nicholas -- all
boasted shameless Scottish accents and an endearing Scottish bluntness.
Yet such Tories have been repeatedly marginalised.
Third: the Scots are great believers in deserts, just ones. Too often
this Government has lied. In 1979, for example, promises were made of
better devolution measures, and ''Road Equivalent Tariff'' restructuring
of island ferry fares. These promises were broken.
More: the Tories seem incapable of admitting folly, even when its
calamitous consequences are self-evident. The community charge fiasco
cost taxpayers millions and millions of pounds, criminalised thousands
of people and greatly inflated municipal bureaucracy. Above all -- and
this the electorate seems determined to remember and avenge, there was
the ERM debacle in September 1992, when Norman Lamont wasted more in one
day trying to save sterling than Labour had promised to spend on the NHS
in an entire term, and lost.
''Black Wednesday'' was a turning point. The ERM had kept our interest
rates artificially high for months, spreading bankruptcy and misery
throughout the private sector. Yet Major and Lamont swore, not days
before, that they would never -- no, never -- abandon the mechanism; it
was the old Tory obsession with inflation. When they did, at last, dump
it -- when they had to -- they remained in office. The public has never
since recovered faith in the Tories as the party of sound money.
But the biggest hurdle for Scottish Tories is the national question.
Love for one's native land is an essential force in the appeal of any
party of the right. By setting their faces as a flint against any
self-government aspiration, the Tories have thwarted that appeal. Until
they turn on this issue, we will continue to vote and vote and vote to
destroy them.
The horror of it is, time is running out. Who now seriously predicts
the return of a Tory Government in 1996 or 1997? Blair and his bed of
red roses are all but enthroned. And with them, for sure, will either
come a trendy-lefty toy-town Scottish assembly (with wall-to-wall Lesley
Riddoch clones) or, in failure so to deliver, a massive surge for the
SNP and a threat to the Union unparalleled in centuries.
There could be one last chance for the Tories, and that is for they
themselves to deliver home rule in a final defiant act of scorched
earth. They could set up a Scottish parliament elected by a genuine form
of PR -- denying, in perpetuity, one-party rule by Labour. And they
could, as quid pro quo, slash the number of Scottish seats at
Westminster. Even in the teeth of gibbering, embarrassed Labour
opposition, they could deliver such a blow. They have the voices in the
Commons. They have -- just -- sufficient time.
They have everything but the leadership.
Friday: the sermon. And, coming soon, Caledonian re-enactment of the
Jonestown massacre.

NO one accessory asserts a man's identity more tellingly than a hat.
Solidly housed beneath his tweedy beak, Geoffrey Boycott could be taken
for nothing other than a Yorkshireman, and yet something curious is
happening to cloth-cap culture in that part of the country.
A small firm of manufacturers, which for generations has been selling
its caps at a steady, unremarkable pace, suddenly finds demand has
spiralled into round-the-clock production as youngsters lust after its
standard check which sells at #8.99.
In Leeds, last week, this cap was everywhere and mostly back to front
-- which is the cool way cloth-capped dudes stand cap convention on its
head. It took to the sun on benches outside the Henry Moore Gallery on
the Headrow, it bobbed through the university campus, and rode the waves
of dreadlocks in Chapeltown. Only around Headingley did it seem to turn
itself about again to slope forward rather than aft, but then that is
Boycott territory anyway.
Of course, in one particular quarter cap reversal was in evidence long
before any youth movement started hoisting it aloft and t'other way
round. Worn the wrong way about, the cap has always been the trademark
of the paparazzi who need to keep their heads covered when missiles fly
but can't afford to let a peak cast shadows on the lens.
On the wider scene, however, mention of the cap raises a delicate
issue: when is a cap a bunnet? The most obvious answer is: when it is
worn in a sort of plopped-on manner as if it were a pancake that has
been tossed and crash landed in a mistaken location.
It is difficult to understand why so many men wear a cap in this way,
unless they are pursuing that old daft laddie pretence of adopting a
gormless air in order to blind the world to their innate guile and
cunning. But the angled cap is a thing of finely balanced discretion.
Worn with just the right amount of dip over one brow the look suggests
David Niven. Tipped too much towards the ear what you get is Norman
Wisdom.
During one of Mikhail Gorbachev's visits to London in the days of his
historic Russian presidency, the compulsion to own a squirish cap
overtook one of the KGB men in his entourage. On the first day of the
tour the press corps noted that the man we shall call Boris was as naked
on top as the dome of St Paul's, even though an appropriate wind from
Siberia made fur helmets the most sensible attire that day.
But as the week progressed Boris somewhat eccentrically complemented
his black rhino-hide overcoat with the kind of inverted dogtooth shovel
often worn by Prince Charles. Boris had probably bought his in Gieves
and Hawkes; the royal farmer, being thrifty, might well have picked his
up, via an equerry, at C &amp; A.
A colleague in Paris once ventured into a certain hatters on the
Avenue Georges V, and found his head being measured with the kind of
engrossed curiosity you expect only from a man with a scalpel and a
surgical coat. ''You have la belle tete, Monsieur,'' exclaimed the
elderly assistant, referring to the customer's rather -- how shall we
say -- exaggerated cranium: narrow but long from front to back.
In Britain such a head in search of a cap is merely regarded as ''a
problem, sir''. But in Paris the elderly assistant was down on his knees
in seconds, rooting through a cedar drawer for the perfect fit which he
knew, no matter how unsought, would be there waiting for just this
chance demand.
The fact that the elderly assistant's breath carried with it the
plummy aroma of many post-prandial brandies did not seem to affect his
selling expertise in the slightest. The perfect cap was produced,
appraised, tried on, and the elderly assistant remarked that, in his
opinion, no other style could be considered; this was the casque of a
gentleman. If the casque fits a stranger in Paris, he buys it, and such
is the peculiar thrill of small, sartorial transactions in a foreign
country that there is even a certain pleasure to be had in discovering
later that the cap of caps is Scottish-made.
Of course, a certain protocol should escort the hat. In an elegant
world, gentlemen lift their hats in greeting women in the street, and
remove them altogether when they join female company for any length of
time. Cowboys are one of the few exceptions to this rule. They keep
their hats on in and out of doors, whatever the occasion. So, in any
current study of headgear one conclusion is inescapable: these days
gentlemen wishing to disguise themselves as cowboys appear to be a
proliferating breed.

IN the weeks and months ahead we will hear much from disgruntled
Ministers about how Labour, under Tony Blair, is finding mass popular
appeal only because it has consistently and brazenly stolen Tory
clothes.
The Prime Minister parodied it as ''We were wrong, the Tories were
right, so vote Labour'' in one recent broadside. He denounced Blair as a
soundbite politician leading a soap powder party. But the mounting
vehemence of the attacks suggest that much more than media froth and
bubbles lie behind this gnawing Tory concern.
In the absence of detailed policy commitments from Labour, Blair's New
Model Labour Party is being judged, this far, on two core criteria. The
values the party now espouses. And Labour's credibility as a would-be
party of government. The values no longer scare the populace at large.
The mix of respect for individual choice and concern for civilised,
communitarian values, the attempt to rebalance the forces of competition
and opportunity, seems to have struck a potent chord in the electorate
at large.
And, after 16 years in opposition, with hardly an ounce of senior
ministerial experience among them, Blair's team is gaining credibility
as a government in waiting, in large measure, because the Major Cabinet
-- with enough accumulated years of ministerial experience to fill a
whole bookshop with memoirs -- lurches weekly from one glorious gaffe to
another.
The Tory electoral rout which now stretches from Eastwood to Essex,
and will soon encompass Perth and Kinross, proves the scale of the
threat. Hence the mounting bitterness behind the charge that New Labour
is simply masquerading as soft rose-tinted Tories to get elected. Then,
so the charge goes, the Old Labour fist in the velvet New Labour glove
will make its presence felt. The rose will rediscover its thorns.
As a tactic it is probably as good as a desperate party, clinging on
to office -- 10% of the popular vote in Wales, 11% in Scotland, a mere
25% in England, in the recent polls -- can hope to come up with. But it
does carry considerable risks. The charge is that Labour's new values --
individual choice, personal responsibility, respect for markets (albeit
regulated), prudence in public spending -- are, in most essentials,
traditional Tory values. But, if they make that charge stick, Mr Major
and his colleagues may simply be making a Blair-led Labour Party more
electable than ever.
The key issue will be whether enough of the electorate believes Mr
Blair speaks for the party he leads and whether he is strong enough to
see off any left-wing backlash. After he spoke last Thursday evening at
a Herald-sponsored World of Hilton dinner in Glasgow, former Sunday
Times editor Andrew Neil surprised some of us, during a
question-and-answer session, by warmly endorsing Blair's credentials to
be a potentially great Prime Minister. Neil's only qualification: can he
take his party with him?
Proving that he can is one of the Labour leader's central challenges
in the months ahead. And, once the Clause 4 debate was out of the way,
all the new talk from Blair's inner circle was of putting even more
clear sky between the party and the trade unions. That made it crystal
clear that more clear (pink?) sky is precisely what he intends to
create.
The other main risk in the Tory counter-attack is that it assumes that
all the values which have underpinned the past 16 years retain
widespread (if temporarily mislaid) popular support. It also assumes
that Labour is simply into clothes stealing and has no army of tailors
and seamstresses closeted away in some policy backroom, refashioning the
apparel to meet the fashions of a new millennium.
John Major and his colleagues underestimate, I suspect, the extent to
which the popular mood has changed and continues to change. People have
become much more individually self-reliant. Many have had to, as the
world of work has undergone a revolution. Market-style solutions have
entered more and more areas of life. But as the language and rhetoric of
the market has spread, I suggest, there has been the inevitable
counter-swing back towards other, discarded values.
Life is not all a Lottery. So, while millions of us continue to dream
that a #1 ticket will turn into a fortune, public discontent with the
health service reforms simmers and popular outrage at the pay bonanzas
for privatised utility directors knows no bounds. Many of us are,
indeed, materially better off than we've ever been before. But we rail
against the squalor still evident in much of our public infrastructure
and we carry our quantum of guilt about the waste and abuse so evident
elsewhere in our society.
Labour has latched on to some of these changing concerns. We have yet
to see, when more policy detail is forthcoming, how effectively it
manages to repackage and reshape the values Tories claim are being
nicked from under their noses.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown is already embarked on a series of
speeches this month, to be shared between him and his leader, putting
more flesh on the bones of Labour's new economic thinking. The first
instalment came last week.
It included some important ideas, notably a CBI-inspired suggestion
that capital gains tax could be given a new two-tier structure -- with
the tougher rate reserved for those who buy and sell investments for
quick profit -- to encourage the longer-term view among investors. The
first Brown speech in the series also set out to turn Labour into the
real voice of the consumer.
Now there is plenty of evidence -- from the mis-selling of personal
pensions to public unease over the way privatised utilities are being
run -- that consumers do not currently believe that market solutions, as
they currently operate, are delivering the goods (and services) as
efficiently and effectively as they could be delivered.
That does not, however, mean that Labour's plan for a new Competition
and Consumer Standards Office -- a merged Office of Fair Trading and
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, with sharp new teeth -- will switch
people on. One of the abiding problems of British politics is the
penchant, on all sides, to solve problems by creating (or abolishing)
this structure or body or that.
Tony Blair may be reading the popular mood much better than John Major
at present. Whether he can meet its aspirations is still an open
question.

Brussels
EUROPEAN Union nations must work together to resolve the problem of
unemployment which has defeated individual single member states'
efforts, Mr Jacques Santer, European Commission President, said in a VE
Day message.
Linking his message to Europe Day -- today -- Mr Santer remarked:
''None of our member states on its own has been capable of solving a
problem which in recent periods of high economic growth seemed to belong
to the past. Structural unemployment still hits one in 10 workers in the
EU and one in five unemployed is younger than 25.''
He said social exclusion was a new form of poverty which deprived some
people in European society of its benefits. Although it was concentrated
in the big cities it was now spreading throughout Europe.
''It is essential that the EU shows it can contribute to solving this
problem, which lies like a discouraging, grey veil over the daily lives
of each affected person,'' Mr Santer said.
''The growth and competitiveness which are necessary to give to as
many as possible a job and a prospect in life can only be achieved by a
determined, concerted effort within the EU.
''This is also a battle which must be won for the sake of solidarity
between social groups, between regions -- solidarity with our future
generations and solidarity with our neighbours who want to join the
EU.''
Noting that the EU had led to many years of peace in Europe, he added:
''Never assume that the point of no return has been reached. What has
been built up over the past 50 years must be defended every day. It is
worth it. With new problems to solve, we must now more than ever step
out resolutely on the path towards European Union.''
* The Trades Union Congress is challenging the Employment Minister, Mr
Michael Portillo, to meet its representatives, along with the
Confederation of British Industry, to discuss how unemployment in Europe
can best be tackled.
The Government, and in particular Mr Portillo, has seen little need in
the past to consult bodies such as the TUC.
However, the European Union's Council of Ministers recently decided
that governments should consult their social partners on plans for
lowering high unemployment levels throughout Europe.
TUC general secretary John Monks has written to Mr Portillo, urging
him to meet union representatives to discuss unemployment.
Not only does the TUC believe it has valuable points to make but it
would also benefit from the higher profile that meetings with Cabinet
Ministers would give it.

OPEN FORUM
AS we approach the dawning of the twenty-first century it really is
quite astonishing that the provisions of the 1918 Education Act (that
established separate Roman Catholic schools) still remains on the
statute book.
It is beyond dispute that in the nineteenth and early twentieth
century there existed a strong and genuine case for separate Roman
Catholic education, given that the minority Roman Catholic population
throughout Scotland experienced quite blatant and unashamed social,
religious, and political discrimination. As a heavily-victimised
minority, Roman Catholics were denied basic human rights, and the 1918
Act set out to remedy that intolerable situation, which it did to a
significant extent.
However, over the past 80 years or so the Roman Catholic minority in
Scotland has, through its own efforts and in conjunction with the
provisions of the Act, struggled to achieve basic human rights and has
succeeded beyond all expectations, so much so that the sense now
prevails that Roman Catholicism has triumphed not only socially and
religiously but also, and much more significantly, politically.
Thus, from being a despised and heavily-victimised minority in
Scotland, Roman Catholics have become a prominent, and indeed highly
dominant, force in Scottish social, religious, and political life. Every
legitimate grievance held by Roman Catholics in the nineteenth and early
twentieth century has now been fully addressed and satisfied. Why, then,
does the Roman Catholic Church (those who have no children) frantically
cling to the provisions of the 1918 Education Act which have,
effectively, become an anachronism?
It's quite simple. Given that church attendance figures have been
declining rapidly since the 1960s, the separate Roman Catholic schools
may well come to represent the church's only sphere of influence left
over Roman Catholics, and if the Act is ever repealed by Parliament then
those who have no children will lose all control, power, and influence
over their flock and thus will have no-one left to manipulate, threaten,
and coerce into submission.
Therefore it is in the best interests of those who have no children
(and in their best interests alone) that the legal requirement for
separate Roman Catholic education be maintained at any cost, for without
the 1918 Education Act they will have no raison d'etre.
In truth, the Act, at the time, was a necessary piece of legislation,
given that it was designed to counteract sectarianism in Scotland, but
now this particular piece of legislation is perceived to be but a
creator of sectarianism in our country and, as such, we in Scotland
simply must act to rid ourselves of it forthwith.
Let's consider the way in which the provisions of the Act have now
become a primary cause of sectarianism and then let those who have no
children dare to argue otherwise.
Until the age of four both Roman Catholic and Protestant children (I
refuse to use the highly offensive term ''non-Catholic'') are quite
content to enjoy each other's company: share soggy jam pieces, hug one
another, attend each other's birthday party and sing The Wheels On The
Bus at the same pre-school playgroup. Life is but simple and
uncomplicated, replete with innocence and beauty.
However, as ever, dark forces are abroad (Rome to be exact). No sooner
have our Roman Catholic and Protestant children celebrated their fifth
birthday than along come those who have no children to manipulate,
threaten and coerce Roman Catholic parents into dragging their offspring
away from their erstwhile Protestant friends and dump them in St Pape's
Primary School. That begs the question as to where the hell is parental
choice in any of this?
Bearing in mind that those who have no children are the master
practitioners of celibacy (the purest form of birth control known to
mankind) then who, or what, gives them the right to determine and
dictate what Roman Catholic parents must do (under the threat of eternal
damnation) with their child's educational requirements?
It must be said, that more and more Roman Catholic parents are opting
to enrol their sons and daughters in non-denominational schools, but the
sad fact remains that the majority of Roman Catholic parents still yield
to the intense pressure exerted by those who have no children and simply
cave in.
What happens then is that our Roman Catholic child is condemned to
spending the next 11, 12 or 13 years at St Pape's while his erstwhile
Protestant friend is equally condemned to spending his educational life
at Prod Street Primary and Secondary School. We must ask what each
ultimately ''learns'' in their respective school environments.
The first thing they will ''learn'' is that ''Proddy dogs eat the
frogs'' and that ''Catholic cats eat the rats''. They will also
''learn'' that God is a Roman Catholic or that God is a Protestant, that
they have become, overnight, Celtic and Rangers supporters respectively,
and they will ''learn'' the difference between a ''chapel'' and a
''church''. Thus, the seeds of sectarianism have been sown.
Our Roman Catholic and Protestant children, on becoming a mere five
years of age, are thus ''educated'' into believing they are
''different'' (attending different schools, attending different football
grounds, and attending different places of worship). From being bosom
buddies our Roman Catholic and Protestant children become strangers, if
not sworn enemies, and the provisions of the 1918 Education Act, allied
to Roman Catholic parents' highly irrational fear of those who have no
children is fully responsible for such a deplorable situation.
Of course, long before our Roman Catholic and Protestant children have
reached pubescence, they have been garbed in tribal colours and dragged
along to Celtic Park and Ibrox Stadium respectively where their
''education'' is completed.
For God's sake, why do we in Scotland continue to ''educate'' our
children thus? Where, in any of this sectarian nonsense, does there
exist even a vestige of Christianity?
Roman Catholic v Protestant, Celtic v Rangers and Chapel v Church. As
we approach the dawning of the twenty-first century, is it not high time
that parents in Scotland (particularly Roman Catholic parents) fully
recognise the barrenness of sectarianism and rear our children in
Christianity as opposed to Roman Catholicism and Protestantism?
After all, Christ did not sacrifice Himself on the Cross for the
benefit of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism; neither did he intend
that our Roman Catholic and Protestant children's friendships be ripped
asunder, nor is Christ a Celtic or a Rangers supporter, and, naturally,
he would not recognise the difference between a ''Chapel'' and a
''Church''.
Yet those who have no children would vehemently proclaim otherwise.
Wouldn't it be marvellous if we in Scotland could rid ourselves of
sectarianism once and for all? It can and must be done. As a first step,
let all truly Christian-minded parents (particularly Roman Catholic
parents) campaign for the immediate and timely repeal of the
anachronistic 1918 Education Act. Then, perhaps, as a nation we will be
able to reach our full potential by working together, as opposed to
being at each other's throats from the age of five years onwards.
Let's rid ourselves of the highly divisive sectarianism that has
blighted our country for centuries. Let's throw off the shackles of the
1918 Education Act now.
The sense now prevails that Roman Catholicism has triumphed not only
socially and religiously but also politically

UNSTINTING in their efforts to promote world understanding. Unsparing
of themselves in travelling the many air miles thus involved.
Yes, we are talking about our Members of Parliament. We read in the
Caymanian Compass newspaper of a visit to the Cayman Islands by Mr
George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley.
Foulkesie was in the sunny tax haven in the company of Matthew Banks,
the Tory MP for Southport, with a view to forming a Britain-Cayman
group. The Ayrshire MP was approached, he said, because of his
''interest in the Caribbean''. George's job as a Shadow Minister for
overseas development requires him to have broad horizons. As well as his
interest in the Caribbean, he is a member of the UK-Canada,
UK-Netherlands, and UK-Spain groups of MPs.
Another Scottish Labour MP, also called George and no stranger to the
airport departure lounge, is off on his travels. George Galloway, MP for
Glasgow Hillhead, will lead a tour to Palestine later this month.
It sounds very much like a trip for the committed with visits to
refugee camps, meetings with the Palestinian leadership, as well as a
look at life in trouble-torn Jericho and Gaza.
The trip, advertised at #499 in the New Statesman, offers the light
relief of a wee swim in the Dead Sea.
Hedging bets
STRAWS in the political wind: One of the decorated lorries taking part
in the May Day parade had the name Labrokes on it along with the word
Labour. It was bedecked in red with young ladies, also in red, handing
out leaflets. It seems the conglomerate, with interests from bookies to
holiday camps and a natural ally of the Tory Party, is hedging its bets
about the future government of Britain.
Lost for words
MORE on airline acronyms. Nothing printable yet for British Airways
but a reminder that their predecessor BOAC meant Better On A Camel. From
David McGill of Edinburgh, a new one for Lufthansa, based on a recent
promotional exercise in our own dear newspaper: Left Under Free Ticket
(Herald) And Never Seen Again.
Tea and sympathy
WE mentioned the Glasgow Licensing Board's po-faced attitude to
late-night fun at the city's Mayfest. It appears the blight has spread
to the normally hospitable Isle of Bute.
Someone (thought to be a local hotelier) complained to the licensing
cops that various Rothesay sports and social clubs were serving drinks
to visitors on the island for the Bute folk and jazz festivals. The boys
in blue had to be seen to be upholding the law and advised the clubs
concerned of the illegal nature of their hospitality.
Not to be outdone, the Isle of Bute Sailing Club served fans at the
jazz festival with cream teas. Absolutely not laced with rum.
On a roll
DEPT of Great Events We Could Have Attended Yesterday If We Weren't in
the Office Writing This: The International Festival of Worm Charming at
Blackawton, Devon. And Stilton Cheese Rolling at Stilton,
Cambridgeshire. (Where else?)
An upcoming event in The Field magazine Country Diary which time and
distance will unfortunately prevent us attending is Sunday's World Dock
Pudding Championship at Elephaborough Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire.
A dock pudding, in case you're interested, is a dish made out of
docken leaves, oatmeal, and sundry other items. Ah, well, maybe next
year.
Now you know
IT is not given to us all to understand the art that is put on at the
Tramway in Glasgow. The Mayfest show is called Nation and is by artists
from Glasgow and Belgrade. The following description may or may not shed
some light:
''Nation is a declared autonomist State, a non-territorial territory
of the mind. Propagandist and protagonist it is a counter-border,
globe-ing the village. Inter-netting and fornicating the premise of
Nation is a performance installation exploring the captive obsession of
information expansion and the need to f***. As Europe regulates its
deregulation the intended stability of Law attempts to confine instinct.
Nation uses organic software, sound sampling and body performances to
cultivate an ambience of restriction and abandonment, guilt and
confession, exploring the primal sources of territory, possession,
oppression, surrender.''
At least we understood the last word in the third sentence. The
asterisks are ours. The punctuation is all their own.
Insult to injury
SINCE it is the week the Conservatives gather for their annual
conference in Glasgow, we thought it appropriate to return to the
subject of the mythical Carrick Cumnock, MP for Brigadoon South.
Louise Quinn writes from Cumnock with some information on his career
so far: ''Carrick left school at 16 and got a YTS apprenticeship as a
defender with Auchinleck Talbot, until injury during a local derby
forced him out of the game.
''The injury was inflicted by a member of his own team who took
exception to Carrick, in a moment of mental confusion, scoring a superb
own goal. This was in response to cries from rival supporters of 'Come
on, Cumnock! Have a shot at goal!'. Final result -- Auchinleck Talbot 0,
Cumnock Juniors 1.''
Mr J B McCole of Minnigaff, Newton Stewart, has some more information
on Carrick: ''He always insists on reading the opinion polls while being
driven down the Electric Brae, thereby creating the illusion that the
Tory vote is going up.''

A forensic anthropologist explains to Geraldine Abrahams why his
profession is in such demand.
IT is ironic that in a year when we are celebrating 50 years of peace,
the forensic anthropologist has become more important now than ever
before, because of the growing evidence of mass graves, the legacy of
wars and oppressive regimes all over the world.
There are relatively few forensic anthropologists in this country and,
given the military, criminal, and accidental crises worldwide, there is
an increasing need for their skills. Unlike in the US, there is no
formal career structure in this discipline. Most start off as
anatomists, with a knowledge of bones, vital in dealing with skeletal
remains.
Professor Peter Vanezis, head of the Department of Forensic Medicine
and Science at Glasgow University, is a forensic pathologist with an
interest in forensic anthropology. He is also a member of Concerned
Physicians for Human Rights.
He is finding that the department, which has become something of a
specialist in mass grave identification technology, has received more
and more enquiries and requests, particularly from South American
countries like Argentina and Chile, and members of staff are helping to
coordinate a course in Colombia and Chile.
''These countries are interested in identifying the bodies in their
mass graves, and in acquiring all of the techniques to do this,'' said
Professor Vanezis. ''There is a lot of pressure from human rights groups
all over the world and governments like that of Chile, for example, are
keen to make sure they do things right.
''The National Forensic Anthropology team in Argentina has also
inquired about software for looking at facial identification for people
it cannot otherwise identify. Many of these countries do not have the
up-to-date DNA techniques that would enable them to identify people.''
The Department of Forensic Medicine and Science at Glasgow University
is running an intensive four-week course in Forensic Anthropology and
Archaeology from 7 August to 1 September this year, which has been
designed to appeal to forensic medical practitioners and scientists,
police officers and anatomists all over the world. So far, interest has
come from countries like India, France, Lithuania and Australia, which
have no similar course running.
Involving the detection of skeletal and more recent remains from
graves, the course also covers methods of investigating the bodies in
them.
Additionally, it will involve all aspects of body identification,
through bite marks, DNA, facial identification, fingerprints and so on,
and will look at the importance of the forensic archaeologist in the
detection of human remains, in how to dig up a dead body, and how to
collect information. The different techniques available for dating
bones, like strontium 90 and carbon 14, will also be examined.
Police are often the first involved in identifying a body, so the
course will supply them with background knowledge about where they
should look when they need special techniques.
''We decided on an intensive course so that we could attract people
from other countries as well as those from here because there are not
many courses in this field that present such a full picture. Most of
those that are running at the moment are perhaps a little too
specific,'' said Professor Vanezis.
''There is a weekend course in forensic archaeology at Bradford but it
is confined to the detection of human remains. It does not discuss
taking DNA from compromised remains, or facial identification, dental
identification, mass grave work. It would be impossible to do all that
on a weekend.''
A number of centres in the UK are innovators in DNA work, including
Glasgow, which at present is working on a series of 21 cases with Chile.
Glasgow University is also involved in looking at the, as yet,
unidentified remains of the recent Romanian air crash. Most of the other
forensic science labs in the UK concentrate on criminal work.
Another aspect of the course will be facial reconstruction, using a
laser scanner, a beam of light that picks up 40,000 points on a skull as
it rotates on a platform. This is linked up to a video camera which
feeds all the information into a computer, capturing and storing a 3-D
image of a skull.
Before this, the anthropological data on the skull -- age, race and
sex -- will have been calculated from a databank of faces already in the
computer. The skull image is then aligned with the facial image, with
pre-determined landmarks, then the facial image models itself on the
image of the skull, and features like eyebrows and hair are added. This
computerised, facial reconstruction technique has been going now for
about five years and can be carried out in four hours.
Facial mapping, where facial features from video shots, for example,
can be matched with custody shots, will also be examined on the course.
Professor Vanezis considers that the most important development in
forensic anthropology at the moment is the use of DNA and the refinement
of DNA techniques, particularly on skeletal remains using muscle, skin,
bone, or any human tissue with cells, as experienced with the air crash
a few weeks ago where the remains were fairly mutilated.
''We are particularly interested in the mitochrondrial DNA
technique,'' he explained, ''where we use the maternal line and take
hair samples from the root and a pin prick of the blood of relatives.
That is compared with the DNA that is extracted from the tissue from the
skeletal remains.
''With something as specific as an air crash where you have a
passenger list and relatives, it is very easy to discriminate in
virtually all circumstances.''

Political Correspondent Stuart Trotter reports on the pressures John
Major and the Government will face when Tory MPs return to Westminster
today for the first time since the party's disastrous showing in last
week's local elections
THE Prime Minister faces a difficult week as he seeks to restore
confidence in his Government among voters and his own backbench MPs.
The Opposition is expected to taunt the Government in the Commons
today about the voters' repudiation of the Conservative Party in last
week's local elections in England and Wales, following the earlier
debacle in Scotland.
Labour strategists doubt if Mr Major, having failed many times before,
can halt the downward slide in the Tory Party's fortunes and are giving
some thought to the tactics to be adopted if Mr Major is deposed in the
autumn and replaced, most probably by Mr Michael Heseltine.
Tomorrow, the Government could lose the vote at the end of a
Labour-sponsored debate on the NHS in London.
The Health Secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, is expected to announce
some concessions on her programme of hospital closures, which has
infuriated many London Tory MPs. A number of these MPs had a shouting
match, rather than a meeting, with her in her room last week.
Several look unlikely to be able to bring themselves to vote for the
Government, which may not be able to rely either on the support of the
Ulster Unionists.
A defeat would see a condemnation of the Government's NHS policies for
London written into the Commons record, but also probably would result
in Mrs Bottomley being moved in the next Government reshuffle.
On the same day, the Opposition also will mount an attack on the
Transport Secretary, Dr Brian Mawhinney, who is to announce that only
about a third of rail fares will be regulated after privatisation.
Most of the controls will aid commuters into London from South-east
England, but there will be none on Savers, Supersaver, Apex or
long-distance fares.
The Rail Users' Consultative Committee already has warned that
off-peak and weekend services also are likely to be cut.
Mr Major has to decide whether to leave a Government reshuffle until
the traditional period before Parliament rises in July for its summer
recess, or have one earlier to try to create a fresher image as he tries
to launch a political recovery.
Downing Street said yesterday that, with Mr Major abroad taking part
in VE celebrations, it had no idea if his mind had yet turned to
considering a reshuffle.
Sacked former Education Secretary John Patten yesterday called on Mr
Major to use a reshuffle to make his Government ''more exciting''.
Mr Patten said: ''We've got to have the right style. We've got to have
the right structure and we've got to have the right strategy.
''I think at the moment our style is thought to be a bit boring. We've
been around for 16 years. People are a bit tired of the same old faces.
They think there's someone new, fresh and appealing coming along.''
Despite calls from a couple of backbench Tory MPs for the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, to be moved, he seems to be secure
at the moment.
The only senior post to which he could be shifted -- having already
been Home Secretary -- is the Foreign Office, and his reputation as an
enthusiastic pro-European would enrage the Tory right and open the
European divide in the party even wider.
Mr Major, who will be obliged to adopt a Euro-sceptical stance at the
inter-governmental conference on future developments in the EU next
autumn, almost certainly would not want Mr Clarke as his main
negotiating partner.
Although his political stock has dropped sharply in recent weeks and
may drop even further if he is forced soon to make the interest rate
rise he rejected last Friday, Mr Clarke remains too strong a figure in
the party to be dropped.
The same does not apply to the party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, who
could leave in advance of the general reshuffle if the Prime Minister
decides to keep that until the summer. Even a dearth of volunteers or
likely replacements does not look like saving him.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has been mentioned as a possible
replacement, as has Lord Cecil of Essenden, who has won much praise for
his sure handling of the VE celebrations. Mr David Hunt, the Public
Service Minister, is another candidate.
Mr Major is preparing a series of meetings for Ministers with party
members, partly to explain policy and partly to hear suggestions for
improving the party's standing.
Labour yesterday announced that it is set to add to the Government's
woes with a summer campaign designed to force a series of policy
U-turns.
Its first target is tomorrow's Commons debate on health.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ''We will speak for the British
people and use the summer months to force the Government into ditching
damaging and dogmatic policies on the NHS, education, privatisation and
the railways.''
Deputy Labour leader John Prescott yesterday warned the Tories they
were stuck with John Major because there were no alternative leaders.

A JET with 141 passengers on board was forced to make an emergency
landing at Glasgow Airport yesterday.
The pilot of the American Airlines flight from Chicago to Dusseldorf
had reported smoke in the cockpit.
Air traffic controllers diverted him to Glasgow where fire engines and
ambulances followed the 767 airliner through its landing and taxi run.
An airport spokesman said the passengers and crew were able to
disembark normally and that engineers were called to check the flight
deck.
He added: ''It would appear to have been an electrical fault, but
clearly we could take no chances. Full emergency procedures were
instigated.''
There was a similar incident at Ireland's Shannon airport yesterday
when a German airliner landed safely.
The Boeing 747's instruments had indicated an engine fire during a
transatlantic flight. The jet was diverted to Shannon en route from
Gander in Newfoundland to Frankfurt.
However, no fire was found on the jet, which carrying cargo for
Lufthansa and had a crew of four.

Sex education in schools often confuses young people instead of
clarifying issues for them, says Joan McFadden.
APPARENTLY the Victorians were an interesting lot, despite their
traditional image of being upright and moral souls.
That respectable veneer hid some strange and wonderful sexual
proclivities which often bordered on the perverse, if the figures on
child prostitution are to be believed.
There is a very smutty air to the idea of outwardly conforming to some
social code of decency, while secretly hankering after the complete
opposite. That particular era is often used as an illustration of
everything that is wrong in sex education.
This generation cannot claim to be much better off when we consider
the way we were educated about sex, or how our children will be taught
under the present system. The only real step forward is in doing away
with the stork, or gooseberry bush, as even the tiniest toddler can now
associate with being ''grown in mummy's tummy''.
At that age every new piece of knowledge is accepted in the same way,
with momentary interest. Then it is simply and calmly stored away for
future reference, with no fuss.
This tranquil acceptance of the facts of life is an ideal foundation
for developing a child's knowledge of sex and sexuality, but one which
is rarely used.
In the 10 years between three and 13 sex becomes awkward, embarrassing
and strangest of all, alien. The average teenager is disgusted by the
thought of adults indulging in such a youthful pursuit although it must
be conceded that they suffer similar anguish over parental dress,
opinions and such outrageous behaviour as dancing in public.
A grandmother told me that every generation thinks they invented sex,
since they were told so little about it by their parents. This was true
back in the twenties when she was growing up. I wonder if it still holds
good in the nineties.
The sixties and free love were a temporary aberration, as most of the
swingers eventually settled down and started to produce their own
families. Yet again, the traditional views of respectability ruled, and
although cohabiting or having children out of wedlock did not carry the
same stigma as before, it still was not quite the done thing.
Then came the punishment. Aids appeared and the moralists hit the soap
boxes, shrieking about divine retribution and filthy perverts. I won't
attempt to argue that particular case, but the end result is the same.
What used to be termed a healthy sex life can now have fatal results,
and it's long past time sex education was reviewed.
It seems to me that the Scottish Office is both helpful and vague. Sex
education must be taught in every secondary school in Scotland but the
extent to which it happens, and the content, depend entirely on local
education authorities and headteachers.
Surely all you need is one narrow-minded, over-zealous, sexually
repressed individual and you have a school full of uninformed and
confused teenagers. Add a good dose of guilt for even thinking about sex
and you can give a child sexual problems and inhibitions which could
last into old age.
The sex education at my school consisted of a highly embarrassed
science teacher muttering about rabbits and the reproductive life of
plants, which still leaves me baffled.
Fortunately, my mum has always had the ability to remain calm under
pressure, and patiently put me to rights about the sex education I had
had at school. Her straightforward approach made everything seem so
simple that I was left wondering what all the fuss was about. Like the
aforemention toddlers I was able to store all the necessary information
until it was actually needed.
Parents have a role to play, and cannot expect to abdicate all
responsibilities to teachers. Talking about intimate matters can be
embarrassing, but there are many excellent guidance books for every age
group. Answering questions honestly and in as straightforward a manner
as possible is the best starting point, which you can capitalise on as
the child matures.
My older daughter, Rosie, is still at the blissfully innocent age of
the average three-year-old, quite content to know only that I grew both
her and her little sister. I have no doubt that her questions will
become more complicated as time goes on, but I hope I will have the
courage of my convictions and give her all the answers at the right
time. Over-burdening a child with knowledge is unnecessary and counter
productive, and I would like to have confidence that her school will
give me good back-up when it feels she is mature enough to deal with
various aspects of sexuality.
Irrespective of religious belief or moral codes, parents and teachers
have a responsibility to give children all the facts. Homosexuality,
contraception, protection, Aids, and other sexually transmitted diseases
are subjects they will hear about in the playground, and cannot be
ignored no matter how unpalatable you consider them to be. On a lighter
note, how many teachers of sex education have been heard to say -- or
allowed to say -- ''and above all, sex should be fun?''
Victoriana is attractive only in antiques, certainly not in attitudes.
It's time for the Scottish Office to sit down with parents and teachers
and expand on the ''bare bones'' sex education offered in our schools.
If it's felt necessary to protect delicate sensibilities, I suggest that
every sentence is prefixed with ''within marriage'' or ''in a loving
relationship''. Let's give our children credit with having the sense to
deal with information they will need throughout their lives, and make it
as much part of the norm as social etiquette or good manners. In this
climate, knowledge is the power to make educated choices, while
ignorance is anything but bliss.

A BAN on delivery vehicles in Edinburgh's Royal Mile is to be
challenged in the courts.
The Freight Transport Association said yesterday that it had raised an
action in the Court of Session against the decision, which is due to
come into force on June 5.
The FTA's Scottish region director, Mr Frank Tristram, said Lothian
Regional Council's ban was invalid because there had been no public
hearing into objections against it lodged by his organisation.
He said a ban would cause havoc to shop owners, who relied on delivery
vans to bring them their supplies.
Mr Tristram added: ''The regional council has largely ignored our
efforts to create an informal dialogue to seek a reasonable solution.
Our action in the Court of Session is essential to protect the rights of
our members to a full and public hearing of their objections.''
The traffic order would ban delivery vehicles over a certain tonnage
from using the Royal Mile between 10am and 4pm. There has already been
controversy over plans to ban tour buses from the road this summer.

THERE seems to be just one bit of bad news after another about budget
cuts. Is there nothing that can be done about it?
One-off budget cuts can usually be coped with, however painfully. The
problem in the schools sector is the cumulative effect when they are
repeated year after year.
In the higher education sector, universities again face a three per
cent cut. It has become an annual event. If the squeeze continues, a
reduction in quality will become an inevitable reality. The Government's
perception is that it is not imposing cuts but demanding ''efficiency
gains''. But it would say that, wouldn't it?
What kind of campaign can councils run against spending cuts? The
difficulty about pursuing it through a national organisation -- in this
case, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities -- is that the
Government is aware that authorities are not all in equally dire straits
and that a uniform solution might be too generous to some.
Councils which feel particularly hard done by could try adopting the
initiative just undertaken in England, where the seven poorest education
authorities are getting together to put pressure on the Government to
review its funding system. These seven have to make total education
savings of #67m, and around 1000 teaching jobs may be lost. The group is
challenging Kenneth Clarke and Gillian Shephard to visit each authority
with expert accountants and tell them how they can manage their business
within the projected budgets.
We can be dismissive about the initiative -- the odds are that it will
have little effect. However, it is a variation on what the Scottish
Office must see as a hoary old theme, and has the advantage of replacing
the blanket approach by one which highlights special needs.
All this stuff from the unions about class sizes goes over my head. I
was taught in a class of over 50 pupils and I'm none the worse for it.
What is it teachers want -- a one-to-one situation?
No. They wouldn't want that. Most teachers will tell you that classes
can actually be too small -- that there can be too little interaction
between pupils.
Unlike England and Wales, Scotland has legal limits on class sizes. In
that sense, it can at least be argued that teachers here have the
assurance that maximum sizes cannot be increased at the whim of
Government, or because councils have to balance their books. On the
other hand, the legal limits in Scotland were set 20 years ago and a
great deal has changed since then.
Group and individual teaching has become the norm. A never-ending
sequence of important but demanding national initiatives has been
introduced, including Standard Grades, Revised Highers, the 5-14
Programme and national testing.
A recent piece of research in England suggests that bigger class sizes
may be helpful to the teaching process. Frankly, that seems to me
nonsensical. Teachers who have to cope with preparing and offering new
courses -- with presenting pupils, as and when they happen to be ready,
for national tests, with catering for the individual needs of young
people in mixed-ability situations -- will clearly benefit, as will
their pupils, if numbers are made more manageable.
The difficulty could lie -- as with the budget cuts -- in the
scattergun approach. It seems logical to argue that, 20 years on, the
need has developed for all types of class -- primary and secondary,
composite and non-composite, academic and practical -- to be reduced in
size.The argument is, however, too wide to impress the powers that be.
Within any set of demands there are always priorities, and a phased
programme of cuts might prove a better negotiating tactic.
I am studying at Edinburgh University. I have heard of a new scheme at
Aberdeen, designed to help those who, like me, are in financial
hardship. Can you tell me about it?
Aberdeen University is setting up a new fund, Student Action Relief
(Star), under which former students and local firms will be invited to
assist students in financial distress. According to the Principal,
Professor Maxwell Irvine, about 20% of students ''are in extreme
difficulty meeting their day-to-day living costs''. He asked student
representatives, within the context of the university's 500th
anniversary celebrations later this year, for their advice on spending
the quincentenary funds. The unanimous response was that the priority
should be tackling hardship.
The student body will be a notable contributor to Star through a
series of fund-raising events. However, it is graduates who will largely
determine the impact which the initiative makes. They will be invited to
take out an annual covenant of several hundred pounds, having been
presented with the depressing news that the average student has, on
graduation, a debt of #6000, and that three-quarters of students spend
large amounts of time in paid work to make ends meet.
Though there already exists a scheme -- the Government's Access Fund
-- which assists students in financial need, many are not normally
eligible to receive help from it. Most of its finance is disbursed to
mature or disabled students, or to those with families. There may,
therefore, be interest from other universities in Aberdeen's Star Fund
at a time when the issue of student hardship is rising fast towards the
top of the political agenda for education.
My granddaughter told me that her teacher had removed all his own
books, pictures and maps from the classroom. He had explained to the
children that the quality assurance inspectors, who had been in school,
had asked all the staff to do this. Why should this be?
According to Glenda White, chief inspector with Strathclyde's Quality
Assurance Unit, this is not a normal request for inspectors to make. The
school may have overreacted to a suggestion that, perhaps, some
materials might be out of date, or might not reflect a multi-cultural
society, or that not enough pupil material was on display. If you remain
concerned, a chat with the head teacher should up clear matters.

DICK LOUDEN gets in the swing of celebrations organised by Scottish
schools to mark VE Day in traditional style at Scotland Street museum.
THEY like doing things in style at Scotland Street Museum of Education
in Glasgow. Their street party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of VE
Day brought the generations together -- local residents of the Kinning
Park area who had lived through it all, and primary children who were
keen to pay their own tribute.
The weather could not have been more glorious for a street party, and
the youngsters had come kitted out in period costume. It was a poignant
reminder for their more elderly guests, who had been treated in advance
by Strathclyde's Catering Direct to a wartime menu -- but not wartime
rations -- of cream of parsnip soup, mutton and stout casserole with
dumplings, and bread and butter pudding with vanilla sauce.
The three schools involved in the street party at Scotland Street were
Clachan Primary from Argyll, Clarkston Primary of Airdrie and Linnvale
Primary of Clydebank. Simultaneously, in a coordinated initiative, three
other schools -- St Gregory's Primary in Glasgow, Pennyburn Primary
(Ayr) and St Mary's Primary (Renfrew) -- were engaged in a similar
celebration across the river in the Museum of Transport.
According to Helen Gunnion, who teaches at Scotland Street, staff from
the Museum of Education had prepared the ground well by spending a day
in each of the six schools. They had depicted the existence of a typical
Glasgow family during the early 1940s, using as teaching materials a box
of objects linked to aspects of the family's lifestyle e.g. gas masks
and bullets. The schools had then taken up the theme themselves in
preparation for the VE Day celebrations.
Jean Dewey, head teacher of Clachan Primary, considered the round trip
of over 200 miles to be well worth the trouble. Most of the school's
total roll of 27 pupils had accompanied her to Scotland Street, though
the war had hardly impinged directly on their corner of Argyll. ''The
village's closest acquaintance with the war was when Keil School from
Dumbarton had to be evacuated there,'' she said. ''Clachan itself had
only one fatality because of the war.''
The programme for the street party was devised, and expertly
supervised on the day, by Dorothy Stewart, the curator of Scotland
Street, Helen Gunnion and another member of the teaching staff, Fiona
Turnbull. It was a blend of song, dance, drama and reminiscence, plus of
course the richly deserved break to devour snacks and refreshments at
long tables set out, naturally, in the shape of a V.
The communal singing was jovially accompanied at the piano by William
Brown, head teacher of Clarkston Primary, and there were many nostalgic
expressions on the older faces in the audience in response to the
strains of such wartime favourites as The Quartermaster's Stores, The
White Cliffs of Dover, and Run, Rabbit, Run.
All three schools then performed short dramatic pieces about living in
wartime which they had written themselves, with Clachan's contribution
taking the form of a mock radio interview.
The youngsters listened intently to a reminiscence of wartime in
Glasgow provided by a local resident, Edmund Campbell. In 1939 it had
been a case of lights out and curtains drawn, of older brothers being
summoned to war service. In 1940 soldiers from many countries came over
to Scotland, and public parks were turned into camps. In 1941, when the
German Air Force bombed Glasgow, young Campbell was working as a
milkboy. Two years later he was attached to Rolls-Royce -- where 24-hour
shifts were in operation to keep the production of aircraft engines
going -- and was not called up. On VE Day he was on nightshift when the
good news came in -- thereafter it was just one gigantic party.
For the children it was an exhilarating experience as they were
transported into a critical epoch of their country's history. Nicola
Jackson from Linnvale explained that they had prepared by making hats,
pictures, posters, and flags. ''This morning we even made crunchies --
these biscuits that were rationed,'' she said. Nicola thought it right
to celebrate VE Day. ''Loads of people died -- we should show how much
we appreciate those that fought for us.''
Robbie Clark from Clarkston Primary knew about VE Day because his
teacher had read out stories and he had seen a video. ''My grandma
remembers the barrage balloons and the man who tried to kill Rommel,''
he said proudly. ''It's good to remember those that were killed saving
us from the Nazis.''
Matthew Parkhouse from Clachan agreed. ''People should be remembered
for what they've done,'' he said. ''The war is still talked about in
Clachan -- it's not a young person's village. We're doing a project on
World War Two in our school and that makes you feel it's only right to
offer your own tribute.''

SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams left Ireland yesterday for a 12-city
coast-to-coast tour of the United States prior to this month's
Washington conference on the economic future of Northern Ireland.
Mr Adams, flying out just 48 hours ahead of crucial talks in Belfast
between his party and Northern Ireland Office Minister Michael Ancram,
said he would be kept up-to-date with the outcome of the discussions.
''I will be in daily contact with our office here in Ireland,'' Mr
Adams said at Dublin airport.
''The meeting will be an important one. We are entering into it very
positively and want to bring the entire process forward into all-party
talks.''
Sinn Fein plans demonstrations in advance of the talks, and Mr Adams
insisted they would be peaceful -- despite trouble last week.
''Sinn Fein has a long history of peaceful demonstrations,'' he said.
''It is noteworthy that it is only when the Royal Ulster Constabulary
misbehave themselves that there is any difficulty. Everyone recognises
the need for demonstrations to be peaceful.''
The aim of Mr Adams's three-week trip will be to ''secure greater
interest and participation by the US in the process of building peace in
Ireland''.
He is expected to take the opportunity to urge American pressure on
Britain for the early implementation of a talks programme involving all
parties in Northern Ireland.
Developments in the peace process will be reviewed by the Prime
Minister and his Irish counterpart, Mr John Bruton, when they meet today
in Moscow.
They are attending VE Day anniversary ceremonies with other
international leaders in the Russian capital.
Prospects for tomorrow's exchanges between Mr Ancram and a Sinn Fein
delegation headed by Mr Martin McGuinness will top the agenda at the
Moscow meeting.
Mr Bruton is likely to request that Mr Major encourage moves towards
round-table, all-embracing discussions on Ulster's future.

<TEXT>
THE excellent report detailing the alarming state of the Kingston
Bridge in Glasgow must give cause for concern to all those who use it
regularly (May 4).
Permit me to supply some additional information which is, I believe,
very relevant to the situation.
On March 3 a convoy of 19 vehicles which included five Foden TCHD
lorries, passed over this bridge. Each of these five lorries was loaded
with two Trident warheads and weighs 48 tons when loaded. This is eight
tons over the legal limit.
Since 1992, when these vehicles first came into service, there have
been 22 officially acknowledged breakdowns (''unscheduled stops''),
including one for four hours on the off ramp at Erskine Bridge.
If a breakdown can occur at Erskine Bridge there is no reason to
believe that there could not also be one on Kingston Bridge. Bearing in
mind the fact that your report specifically emphasises the dangers from
a concentration of lorries on the centre section which has sagged by
about one foot and the dire track record of these Foden carriers, it was
surely highly irresponsible for the MoD to take them over the Kingston
Bridge.
One may assume that the military were aware of potential disaster
since all the convoys for the previous year had been rerouted through
Stirling/Balloch/Loch Lomondside/Helensburgh, then on to the nuclear
dump at Coulport.
As I write a convoy is loading up with nuclear warheads at Burghfield,
and is due in Scotland soon (they come every four to six weeks).
Although EU directive 89/618 requires that citizens be notified of the
movement of nuclear material through their areas, you will be told
nothing.
I should also add that the transport of radioactive material and
explosives in the same vehicle is banned by the Radioactive Substances
(Carriage by Road) (GB) Regulations, 1974 (No 1735), Section 6b. It
seems that the military are above the law.
In spite of regulations these vehicles carry no radiation warning
signs. They are a uniform dull green, presumably because the MoD wish to
suggest that Trident warheads are environmentally friendly.
If any of your readers are on the road, I suggest they keep a sharp
lookout for a large convoy of green lorries, with an escort of armed
Marines, fire trucks, police, outriders, etc, all desperately trying to
look invisible.
If these head off towards Glasgow and Kingston Bridge, I strongly
advise you to take a trip in the other direction.
If they make for Stirling, why not follow along and give a merry wave
as they hurtle along Raploch Road, trundling 80 Hiroshimas of killpower
past primary schools, lollipop ladies, swarms of children, bewildered
shoppers, and the inevitable gallant band of peace protesters?

NO-ONE watching television at the weekend can fail to have been moved
by the emotion of London's VE Day celebrations.
I say London -- for Glasgow and most of Scotland seem to have opted
out of this great national occasion.
What on earth has happened to us? Perhaps the apathy is a sign of our
estrangement from the rest of Britain.
Yet victory in 1945 was in no small part due to the huge efforts of
the Scots in the armed forces, in the shipyards, in the coalmines,
wherever they were called on to serve.
Surely VE Day if nothing else must remind us of what we can achieve as
a united Kingdom.
Devolution by all means. But we have more to gain from building on our
bonds with the rest of Britain than by severing them.

WE'VE come a long way since May 8, 1945, so long it would seem that
members of a national organisation see fit to take strike action over
the moving of their traditional May Day holiday to May 8, thereby
allowing a one-off, special marking of a very special anniversary.
Sad when people actually think this way. Fifty years on, at least they
have the freedom to indulge in such misguided behaviour. What price
freedom if Fascism had won the day?
This year throughout Europe VE will be specially poignant for many,
many thousands. On a personal level I have witnessed the intervening
years of a woman whose marriage was cut short after months, never having
a grave to visit, and left as mother, father, and struggling provider
for the child of that marriage.
Alongside this I saw the continuing grief of grandparents, bereft of a
much loved son, and experienced the personal pain of second hand
memories, with nothing to cling to except by courtesy of others' words.
How many times has this situation, and worse, repeated itself
throughout Europe and yet, in this country, supposedly proud of its
resistance role against the greatest wrong of this century, we find
people chewed up over the piffling priority of a holiday custom.

ALTHOUGH I did not serve in the Royal Navy I take the most profound
objection to the gratuitously insulting remarks of your anonymous TV
critic concerning the film In Which We Served (May 1).
Had it not been for the selfless devotion and courage of thousands of
ordinary British sailors during those interminable and painful years
your idiot columnist would not be here today to indulge in a cheap sneer
at their magnificent discipline and comradeship -- qualities regrettably
absent in your critic and in too many of his or her generation.
Fortunately, there are still young people in the country who carry on
the great traditions of their predecessors, as we saw in the Falklands
and in Desert Storm.
But God help us if the defence of the country in the face of another
implacable enemy ever depended on the unprincipled and ignorant wimps
typified by your critic.
In the week of VE Day commemoration, it is unforgivable that any
responsible newspaper should devote space to such a gross, snide
calumny. I consider that a public apology to the Royal Navy is due.

AS we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the war in
Europe we all, hopefully, will be saying never again. There is always
that threat that history will repeat itself -- if we are not vigilant.
One of the horrors of the war was Nazi Germany's treatment of not only
the Jewish people but also of the disabled, physically and mentally
handicapped Germans.
Authors Francis Schaffer and Dr C Everett Koop wrote of what happened
in Germany as the Hegelian philosophy, of what is useful is good,
flourished: ''The first to be killed were the aged, the infirm, the
senile, and the mentally retarded and the defective children. Eventually
as World War II approached, the doomed undesirables included epileptics,
amputees and even bed-wetters.''
The Law Commission in England and Wales has recently issued a report
on mental incapacity and claims to usher in a new era for mentally
incapacitated individuals.
The Law Commission proposes statutory rules to ensure independent
supervision of serious medical decisions such as sterilisation and
abortion for the mentally incapacitated as well as the withdrawal of
feeding with those with PVS.
A further proposal is made that it may be acceptable to experiment on
people who are mentally incapacitated. The Law Commission report also
includes a suggested statute making living wills legally binding.
Have we learnt anything at all from history, or are George Santayana's
words true, ''Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat
it.''

WELL said, Mr Beattie, in his letter (May 1).
I too have been wondering the same thing since I heard a commentator
on TV actually refer to this two-minute silence being to commemorate the
VE Day as the end of the War not ''the War in Europe''.
Like so many others, I was involved in the Far East up until VJ Day
and we should hold a service then and observe the two-minute silence for
the end of the Second World War.

WHAT with this and that and the bingo loot, all of the Churchill
family have had their nether garments hung out like street bunting,
except one. Only he has been not revered, reviled, nor reassessed. It
does not seem fair to leave him alone under the debris of the war
nostalgia that is all around. Vic Oliver, for he was the one, would have
felt so. ''I am colossal,'' he liked to say. He took to calling himself
Mr Showbusiness.
His name will endure, if for an incidental reason. Apart from
deserving the attention of a grateful nation, he was the first castaway
on Desert Island Discs.
Vic Oliver was a comedian, married for a while to Sarah Churchill, a
daughter of Winston. While the father-in-law stirred the loins of an
empire for the fight, Oliver tickled ribs in Moss's Empires.
He was one of the gang of laughter-makers whom showbiz has since
awarded tinsel medals for Commando service against the Huns. Vic Oliver
was more of an age to say the Bosches. Not for nothing was he called The
Old Vic.
In British vaudeville he was billed as the American comic, although
the backcloth to his early life was gaudier. Mr Oliver, a bald gent of
craggy mien, was a scion of Austrian aristos, a son of Baron Vilctor von
Samek. As a young man he toured America as a concert pianist.
Around l927 he took a turn to improve his performances with jokes. He
later raised more laughs by pretending to be an excellently bad
violinist.
His accent was most droll. Central European vowels mingled with a
mid-Atlantic drawl. Audiences fell about even when he said nothing much,
which was most of the time. He was such a warmly agreeable fellow that
he could extract great fun from small jokes, some of them small indeed.
If memory serves -- and mercifully it does not serve well -- a part of
his act was to keep threatening to play his fiddle, but then spared
ears. Finally, he sawed away.
''I shall play for you a cantata,'' he announced in his most
Hapsburgian tones. ''First the can and then the ta-ta.''
He owned a racehorse which he said he fed on pate de foie gras and
champagne. Although it never won a race, he boasted that it was always
the happiest horse running.
His whimsy survived the war in a wireless series he called Oliver's
Twists. He would call it that. To the music of Stanley Black's dance
orchestra sang Pat Kirkwood, famous as the fifth victim on Desert Island
Discs.
How Vic Oliver beat Hitler was on a show called Hi Gang! that starred
Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon, two American film actors. They had sailed to
Britain in l939, and stayed, while sundry heroic figures of stage and
screen were steaming the other way. Oliver played an intrusive radio
reporter called Peep Keyhole.
By a piece of luck too dire to ignore a scrap of a Hi Gang! script has
come to hand. It cries out to be shared. Here is some of the merriment
that the people came home to after a hard day in food queues and
munitions factories.
Ben Lyon: ''Do you like dogs?''
Vic Oliver: ''I do. I have a dog.''
''What's its name?''
''Corset.''
''Why corset?''
''Because I tie him up during the day and let him out at night. Ha ha!
What a joke! I am colossal.''
For anybody who needs more, there is more. Again it is Ben Lyon
feeding the questions.
''What is your profession?''
''I am an inventor.''
''An inventor? That sounds interesting. What do you invent?''
''I've invented luminous pyjamas.''
''Luminous pyjamas?''
''That's for people who walk in their sleep in the blackout . . .''
The effervescent Old Vic went on to volunteer the information that he
had invented also bottomless bird cages. ''Bird cages with no bottoms at
all,'' he added by way of emphasis. ''That's for canaries you can
trust.''
Sentimental history insists that the radio comedians helped win the
war. Good on them if they did. They also sometimes made the show against
Hitler seem to go on even longer than it did.
Wartime comedy was so unfunny that even the Governors of the BBC once
noticed. In l94l they almost apologised to licence holders for its low
quality. On Saturday there was a reminder of how low.
A repeat of the victory broadcast of Itma, the top radio comedy show
of the war years, surely divided the nation. Any listeners at the
weekend were either too young to find it funny or else have grown so
mature they felt sheepish about having once laughed at it.
Itma was a creation of Ted Kavanagh, a New Zealand scriptwriter who
passed some of his formative years at Edinburgh University, if that
helps explain anything. I'd hoped to have forgotten all that good stuff.

YOUR VE Day supplement would be received by veterans with great
interest (May 4). We rely heavily on the media to get such information
to those who need to know the details.
I hasten to draw the attention of your veteran readers to the item on
page 60 which wrongly indicates that the Perth reunion, the biggest
outside London, takes place on May 7.
This event, which invites veterans of all the forces to reunite in
Perth, will take place on the North Inch on Saturday, May 13, as
planned. Veterans should assemble for the parade at 2.15pm.
Extensive preparations have been made for what will be a glorious
spectacle with veterans coming from all over the country. A memorial to
the 51st Highland Division will be unveiled.

GAVIN BELL, writing about Iona and the late John Smith's burial in the
Reilig Odhrain (May 8), has made two statements which require to be
questioned.
First, he states that this is also the burying place of many Celtic
and Nordic kings.
The designation Iomaire nan righ (ridge of the kings) was first
recorded in 1772 by the travel writer Thomas Pennant as applying to the
site of three cairns mentioned by Donald Munro, Archdeacon of the Isle,
in 1549 bearing Latin descriptions identifying them as the tombs of
kings of Scotland, Ireland, and Norway.
These are not to be found on Iona today.
From the inscribed medieval grave slabs in the Abbey and Nunnery
museums there is no doubt that Iona and the Reilig Odhrain was the
resting place of numerous local royal and noble families.
In the absence of any supportive archaeological evidence, however,
isn't it time modern writers stopped perpetuating the multiple king
burial myth no matter how popular it may be?
Secondly, Gavin Bell implies that orientation -- the burial of the
dead with the feet towards the east -- is peculiar to the islanders of
Iona. Not so.
Orientation in burial has been strictly observed in the case of nearly
all Christians throughout the world from a very early period. It is only
within modern times that it has been neglected in the newer cemeteries
and in many recent additions to parish graveyards.

WE are concerned that your readers may have worries about the purity
of Seven Seas and cod liver oil and would like to reassure them that all
our products are safe (Health warning on cod liver oil, April 21).
It is certainly true that fish from certain seas have been shown to
contain small amounts of environmental pollutants. In the case of fish
and fish products the level of contamination can often be related to the
source and age of the fish.
Levels are much lower in fish from open waters, as in the North
Atlantic and Arctic oceans, with higher levels of environmental
pollutants occurring in fish caught in coastal waters and in landlocked
seas.
Seven Seas fish oil products are produced from fish caught in the
Arctic waters which have extremely low levels of pollution.
Continuous extensive testing and quality control is carried out on the
fish oil at each stage of the purification process and the fish oil is
checked regularly from the time that purchase is envisaged right through
to the processing and bottling or encapsulation of the oil.
This includes monitoring and testing for pollutants to ensure that
Seven Seas Pure Cod Liver Oil is completely safe and free from harmful
levels of pollutants.
Seven Seas has one of the biggest cod liver oil purification systems
in the world and uses the latest technology in the purification and
quality assurance processes. All crude fish oil is processed and
monitored during production.
The processing includes a high temperature, vacuum step which has the
effect of further reducing any small amount of environmental pollutants
that may be present.
The special processing techniques and associated stringent quality
control procedures guarantee the purity and safety of the Seven Seas
brand of cod liver oil and pure fish oils.

SOME 30 years devoted to extolling the commanding excellence of
Scottish cuisine -- Scotland sharing only with Brittany among Celtic
nations the right to the dignity of the accolade ''cuisine'' -- entitles
me, I believe, to anathematise your third leader as mendacious (May 3).
The indignities inflicted on Falmouth have nothing to do with real
Pasties. The true pasty is serendipitous in its combination of raw beef,
onion, and swede turnip, in a secure envelope of shortcrust pastry,
whereas the flaky Forfar Bridie uses pre-cooked meat and assorted
vegetables.
If you seek higher authority than my native knowledge of the pasty's
superiority to all other foodstuffs, it is by coincidence suggested by
Willie Hunter's admirable piece on Lord Woolton's contribution to
victory in the last war, adjacent to your leader.
He allocated a special ration of meat to Cornish bakers for the
provision of pasties in compensation for the fact that in mainly rural
Cornwall we had no British Restaurants. Thus was born the Ministry Pasty
as defined by law.

I WAS interested in George Craig's letter regarding the dish of
potatoes with milk and butter added (April 28). I also enjoyed this
self-same dish as a youngster; indeed it was my father's only culinary
achievement and we had it usually for Sunday dinner.
However, I can't help thinking that it was perhaps making a virtue out
of necessity as I am sure a little meat, fowl, fish, etc, would have
enhanced an already excellent base content.
The dish was known colloquially as ''rummlees'' which is
self-explanatory.
I am unfamiliar with syboes, but scullion would have its origin from
somewhat deprived circumstances and perhaps that is why this dish was
known more in the Celtic fringes rather than in the more affluent
established areas.

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Chirac may have won the French presidential election, if
only at the third attempt; the really interesting question is whether
this ebullient chameleon of a man will be able to live up to his
campaign. In one particular respect this will be of the greatest
interest to Britain. Despite lengthy periods of high unemployment, the
issue of the unemployed and the resulting drag on the welfare bill and
the economy failed to become an important election issue in Britain. Why
this should be so is not entirely clear. True, the vast bulk of the
population was in employment and the self-centred ethos of the eighties
undoubtedly led to a feeling that my neighbour's unemployment is of no
concern to me. It is also likely that the British electorate is cynical
about the issue of unemployment, perhaps partly out of a feeling that
the figures have been massaged for years. The recent improvement in the
employment situation has been largely accomplished through part-time
jobs and this, too, has not encouraged any real feeling that the problem
is on the way to resolution. Nor has it led to a perception that it is
of real importance.
France's unemployment rate is higher than in most European Union
states. At 3.3 million it represents more than 12% of the population. In
France it is a live issue but the reasons for it are the same as in
Britain, with the recession combining with increased automation and new
working patterns to break down old certainties. As an astute politician,
Mr Chirac made the issue of unemployment the main plank of his campaign.
As he won, if narrowly, this must be taken as proof that the French
presumably care more about unemployment than do we. Mr Chirac's proposed
solutions are much more problematic. He believes that all of the
conventional remedies have been tried and have failed miserably.
His key suggestions seem to sit oddly with a centre-right politician
in that he proposes a budget to encourage employers to hire the
long-term unemployed, a programme to encourage public housing, and an
increase in the minimum wage. All of this could have come from his
socialist opponent, Mr Jospin, or perhaps even from Mr Tony Blair. The
problem with Mr Chirac's solution for unemployment is that few people,
apart from Chirac zealots, believe that his plans will work. The theory
is that the measures already detailed will stimulate the economy, thus
bringing down unemployment and reducing the welfare bill. But France's
budget deficit is high and it is difficult to see how Mr Chirac can
finance his programme. Most probably he cannot, but at least in France
(and under a right-wing president) unemployment is taken seriously as a
social ill.

IT is hard to like Will Carling. Honestly, that has nothing to do with
the fact that he is captain of the England rugby team (again), but a lot
to do with his status as an insufferably rude brat. The officials of the
Rugby Football Union in England may well be foolish, as he clearly
believes, but if they are all that foolish how did they come to appoint
young captain Carling, and to persist in that appointment for 48 matches
and through years of tension between the RFU and the players? Those
tensions have been swelling and gathering of late and part of the reason
is the strong desire of the England players to make money out of their
sport and the undoubted lead given to them in this matter by their
captain. The arguments for and against this development are lengthy and
bound round with a good deal of hypocrisy. There is no need to rehearse
them here, except to regret the hypocrisy and to hope that honesty and
openness might return soon to an important and exhilarating game which
is a testimony to the values of sport when it is played well.  Whether
Carling's profuse apologies, and the extraordinary reversal of the
sacking decision just two days after it was made, will allow the affair
to settle is quite a different matter. The timing of this odd episode,
in which all concerned clearly lost either their heads, their tempers,
or both, is extraordinarily bad for English rugby. The assertion of
player-power will not necessarily be to the benefit of the England team
on the pitch during the coming World Cup. Tensions of various sorts will
remain and it is not clear how differences of opinion within the England
party can be resolved when the officials and the players have no respect
or liking for each other.
Indeed, in the decision to reinstate Carling, the officials have shown
that they have lost their nerve and a good deal of their power. It is
likely that the false calm within English rugby will remain until after
the World Cup. Then, no matter the result, there will be a number of old
scores to be settled. This will have repercussions on both the team and
the officials. Hopefully, by then, they will have learned how to behave
like adults.

IT would take dedicated research to compare the merits of every pub in
Britain. Mr Arthur Amos, of Bury St Edmunds, spent half a century just
recording those with different names, and his son John brought the list
to 23,563. Some names, unfortunately, are very common. There are no
fewer than 650 Red Lions, for instance, and with the White Harts, Black
Bulls, etc, they are often under pressure to modernise. When it held a
competition to find a ''pub sign of the twentieth century'' the Brewers'
Society not only had frightening suggestions like The Iron Lady and The
Thatcher, but The Silicon Chip and The Computer and Mouse.
Older drinkers resist such changes, and their best weapon is a
historic connection. No-one would dare rename the Cheshire Cheese in
Fleet Street, for instance, or the Saracen's Head in the Gallowgate,
both associated with Boswell and Dr Johnson. Such considerations may
weigh heavily with bidders for The Great White Horse Hotel, Ipswich,
which is currently on the market. It was this tavern, it will be
recalled, which was immortalised by Dickens in The Pickwick Papers,
although hardly with the hospitality of Dingley Dell. It was where
Pickwick lost his way and found himself in the bedroom of a middle-aged
lady in curlers. ''Never,'' said Dickens, ''were such labyrinths of
uncarpeted passages, such clusters of mouldy, badly-lighted rooms,
beneath any one roof . . .'' It had dirty grates, he said, and served
the ''worst possible port wine, at the highest possible price''. The
reality of some English inns must have been like The Maypole's bar in
Barnaby Rudge -- ''crammed with men, clubs, sticks, torches, pistols;
filled with a deafening noise, oaths, shouts, screams . . . new faces
and figures presenting themselves at every instant, some yelling, some
singing, some fighting, some breaking glass and crockery . . .''   It is
fashionable to decry modern pubs, and laud the old ones, but Dickens was
an accurate reporter. Conditions were often like those Dr Johnson found
at a tavern in Bristol. ''Describe it, sir?'' he cried. ''Why, it was so
bad that Boswell wished to be in Scotland!''

Helsinki, Monday
THOUSANDS of flag-waving Finns flocked onto the streets today to
celebrate a much smaller, more recent victory than the end of the Second
World War.
Beating their former colonial ruler Sweden in the world ice hockey
championships yesterday was, for Finland, almost as significant as the
making of this young nation in 1917.
The team that secured Finland's first world championship trophy
returned to a heroes' welcome -- escorted by air force fighter planes in
Finnish airspace and paraded in an open limousine through streets packed
with cheering crowds.
''Other people are having their victory day today -- now we're having
one too,'' said a middle-aged woman in the crowd.
Ice hockey is important to Finns, but beating their dominant Nordic
neighbour is seen here as a national coming of age.
''This is a matter of national culture,'' Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen told the daily Helsingin Sanomat. ''Perhaps this success is
evidence of (our) national maturity.''
Yesterday's televised broadcast of the match was watched by nearly
half the entire population of five million.
People flung themselves into chilly fountains and wrapped up in blue
and white Finnish flags; youths laid giant flags over the steps of the
parliament building; statues were draped in hockey shirts and given
hockey sticks and helmets.
Such displays of national pride are rare from the usually shy and
insecure Finns. Sweden ruled Finland until 1807, then it was a Grand
Duchy of Russia for a century.
''God isn't Swedish after all,'' said a local radio commentator. The
victory could be an important psychological boost to the often gloomy
Finns, a diplomat agreed.--Reuter.

Manila, Monday
PRESIDENT Fidel Ramos appeared to be heading for triumph in Philippine
elections today, but a victory blighted by violence in which dozens of
people were killed.
Ramos's coalition party was heading for an 8-4 win in the Senate vote,
according to early unofficial returns compiled by Manila television and
radio stations.
The trend, confirming pre-election opinion polls, would indicate
strong public endorsement for Ramos's economic reform policies if it is
sustained through the protracted counting process.
Full results are not expected for several days, election officials
say.
The worst election violence came in the town of Maganoy 580 miles
south of Manila on the troubled southern island of Mindanao, where six
people were killed and 17 injured in a mortar attack.
Hundreds of people fled and army reinforcements were sent in after 10
mortar bombs hit the town in an attack by suspected Muslim rebels.
More violence was reported on the southern Sulu Islands where voting
was abandoned following a clash between supporters of rival candidates.
The violence in the south, as in the rest of the country, was the
result of intense local rivalries and was not linked to a recent upsurge
in Muslim extremism, officials said.
Nearly 60 people have died since campaigning began. Thirteen people
were killed on the eve of the election and about 15 on the day itself,
officials said.
The Commission on Elections also reported scattered attempts at
poll-rigging, including vote-buying and the snatching of ballot boxes.
Ramos, who has said the election would serve as a referendum on his
administration, himself cautioned against a too early assessment of the
results.
Opposition candidate Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos, Jr, complained his
party workers had been systematically harassed.
His flamboyant mother, Imelda, is expected to win a seat in the House
of Representatives from her native Leyte province.

Paris, Monday
NUCLEAR testing, the former Yugoslavia, European Union reform and
relations with the United States are just some of the international
policy challenges awaiting French president-elect Jacques Chirac when he
takes office.
In his first weeks in the Elysee Palace, the conservative Paris mayor
will have to take several decisions that will test his instincts and may
set the tone of his presidency.
Probably the most difficult will be whether to resume French
underground nuclear weapons tests at its South Pacific site on Mururoa
Atoll, suspended by his predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, in 1992.
To do so would antagonise South Pacific nations, which have rushed to
warn Chirac, and risk harming prospects of a worldwide total nuclear
test ban under negotiation at the United Nations.
Not to do so could call into question the reliability of France's
arsenal and prevent Paris developing a new generation of warheads since,
unlike the United States, it has not yet perfected its simulation
technology, military experts said.
Chirac said last week he would take the advice of experts on whether
France needed more tests. If he did resume them, he would set a firm
date for ending testing, he said.
''I expect there will be one campaign of tests. It will start as soon
as possible after mid-May and end by May 1996,'' a senior Western
diplomat in Paris said.
''It won't help negotiations to extend the non-proliferation treaty
and agree on a comprehensive test ban, but it would be manageable if a
deadline were set,'' he said.
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Chirac's likely prime minister, has said
France must review within a few weeks whether to keep its 4800 UN
peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia, the largest national contingent, in
light of renewed fighting there.
French officials and foreign diplomats said Juppe's remarks were
probably meant to put pressure on the warring parties and show the
French public the government was doing something after two soldiers were
killed by snipers last month.
They said it would be almost impossible for France to pull its men out
without the agreement and help of its allies.
Chirac said during the campaign that UN forces should be better
equipped to defend themselves and shoot back if attacked.
But diplomats said the new government would undoubtedly give serious
consideration to withdrawal if the situation in Croatia and Bosnia
continued to deteriorate.
Chirac's first foreign trip is almost certain to be a symbolic visit
to Bonn to reaffirm the central importance of the Franco-German
partnership for the future of Europe.
The president-elect used his international baptism at VE Day
ceremonies in Paris to have a first conversation with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, whom he knows well through conservative political ties and as a
former French premier.
Diplomats forecast that Chirac and Kohl would meet perhaps as early as
next week and pledge to take a joint approach to next year's conference
on reforming European Union institutions.
That should go some way towards reassuring European partners unsettled
by Chirac's frequent position shifts on Europe during the campaign. He
first demanded a referendum before France joins a single EU currency,
then dropped the idea and finally called for a referendum on the outcome
of the 1996 institutional reform.
While German officials privately cite lingering doubts about Chirac's
commitment to Europe and about the influence on him of Gaullist
Euro-sceptics, British officials have welcomed him as a potential ally
in their crusade against Brussels' powers.
Chirac will chair a key EU summit in Cannes on June 26-27 at which the
15-nation bloc must decide how to apportion aid among Eastern Europe,
Mediterranean states and the Third World, as well as launching the 1996
inter-governmental conference.
Kohl's help will be vital to unblock the aid issues, stalled because
of German and British reluctance to maintain past levels of aid to
Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries in real terms.
Before Cannes, Chirac will make a trip to Washington and Halifax,
Canada, for annual talks between the EU and the United States, followed
by a Group of Seven world economic summit.
French ties with Washington have been strained over the French
disclosure in February of US spying in Paris, as well as transatlantic
trade disputes and differences over Bosnia.
Chirac studied in the United States and speaks English, in contrast to
Mitterrand. But he is a French nationalist in the Gaullist mode and,
while open to closer ties with Nato, he will probably be as prickly as
his predecessor, diplomats say.
After the champagne celebrations and street parties to mark Chirac's
victory, French financial markets turned more cautious awaiting the new
president's first moves.
The franc, which hit a 10-day high of 3.5350 against the German mark
after last night's news, slipped to around 3.5470.
Investors cheered Chirac's win over Jospin, but dealers said they now
wanted to know whom he would name prime minister.
The market's favourite is Juppe, a close Chirac ally and currently
foreign minister in the government of outgoing Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur.
Another man mentioned as a possible premier is National Assembly
speaker Philippe Seguin, but analysts said investors would turn very
cautious if he was appointed, remembering his fierce campaign against
closer European unity last year.
* Outgoing President Mitterrand long believed Chirac was unfit to
succeed him, Mitterrand's former chief adviser says in a new book.
Jacques Attali's Verbatim II, based on notes taken during
conversations at the Elysee Palace, chronicles a litany of acid
one-liners on the energetic Paris mayor.
''He runs fast, but he doesn't know where,'' Mitterrand reportedly
said of then-prime minister Chirac in November 1986, according to
extracts from the book published by the magazine L'Evenement du Jeudi
out on Wednesday.
''He's a fake tough guy flanked by fake professionals,'' Mitterrand
opined a month later.
''He's incapable of being president'' and ''Chirac thinks the same way
he goes up the stairs'' are among other Mitterrand gems revealed by
Attali.
Attali told the magazine the two men did gradually come to respect
each other to some extent in ''a relationship built on mutual curiosity
and real sympathy''.
Mitterrand came to feel that the former prime minister had matured a
great deal, learned much and now kept politics and politicking at arm's
length.--Reuter.

THE first children's Gaelic choir from Scotland to compete in the
Canadian National Mod set off yesterday from Glasgow Airport.
The 22-strong choir, from Port Ellen, Islay, are able to make the
12,000-mile round trip to Vancouver thanks to a two-year effort by
fellow islanders to raise the #30,000 needed to pay for their fares and
accommodation.
They will spend two weeks at the Mod and are excited at the prospect
of taking part.
Ms Annabella Perrie, who helped organise the trip, said: ''It is a
dream come true, as some of the children have never been on a plane
before, let alone travelled 12,000 miles.''
Some of the children, whose ages range from eight to 14, will be
taking part in the Action Shield for solo singing and Alison McIntosh,
12, hopes that her efforts will be enough to bring it home to Islay.
''I am very excited about taking part, although nerves will probably
set in once I take to the stage,'' said Alison.
During their two weeks' stay the choir will entertain people not only
at the venue, but also on the ferry to and from Vancouver Island and
across the US border in the main shopping mall in the city of Seattle.

Stuart Trotter describes how the Scottish Secretary could be in line
to become Tory Party chairman -- but for the Scottish problems that
stand in the way
LAST week, over dinner with colleagues on London-based newspapers, the
discussion turned to the expected Conservative local election disaster
and what the party might do to try to dig itself out of one of the
deepest holes in British political history.
Naturally, there was much speculation on whether Mr Major would be
heaved overboard, if not immediately, in the autumn.
Then speculation turned to the expected Cabinet reshuffle of this
summer, another and perhaps final, attempt by the Prime Minister to
create a team in which the voters might have some confidence.
After what was regarded as the inevitable removal of Mr Jeremy Hanley
from the job of party chairman, I was interested that several of my
companions suggested that Ian Lang would be the man for the job,
accompanying this advocacy with enough complimentary references to make
the subject blush if politicians were still capable of such a thing.
Readers may not realise quite how remarkable that was. The holder of
the job of Scottish Secretary does not loom large in the calculations of
most of my UK lobby colleagues and when, for some reason, a Scottish
issue becomes of interest to the UK media, Scottish correspondents find
themselves quizzed about what Scotland's man in the Cabinet thinks about
it all.
Scotland, to much of the London-based press, is a far away country of
which they know just a little, and many of whose concerns, like those of
Wales, seem parochial viewed from the metropolis. This did not prevent a
general recognition when he was doing the job that Malcolm Rifkind was
an able Minister who might well go farther, but he had had a spell at
the Foreign Office which brought him to the attention of London
newsdesks.
Going further back, few of my London colleagues even seem to realise
that in Bruce Millan the Scottish Office possessed one of the most
outstandingly able members of the Wilson-Callaghan Cabinets of the late
1970s.
Last year, Mr Lang was the guest speaker at the Parliamentary Press
Gallery Lunch, given about half-a-dozen times a year, to which
Westminster journalists invite MPs and other guests usually involved
with Government, the outside media or business.
Mr Lang made a hit with a witty speech, stylishly delivered, and
several colleagues who usually give Scottish business in the Commons a
miss, told us we appear to have a bit of a star on our territory -- to
which I, for one, said I had mentioned now and again that the Scottish
Secretary was pretty good but the fact that he was looking after
Scotland had dimmed any interest.
Anyhow, as amidst the wreckage which extends rather deeper into the
vitals of the UK Conservative Party than simply the horrific loss of
local government influence -- serious though that is -- the party chiefs
wonder how best to regroup and recover, Mr Lang's name now pops up quite
frequently.
His appearances on television programmes like Any Questions and The
Jonathan Dimbleby Interview have added to his reputation as a
personable, articulate spokesman for a party which desperately needs
one.
He is also recognised as a Minister who is a good administrator. Apart
from the detail of being Scottish, he looks tailor-made for the job of
party chairman.
A debate on constitutional matters at last year's party conference at
Bournemouth gave him the rare opportunity for a holder of his office to
make a platform speech. That went down well.
He got one of the biggest standing ovations from a conference more
sparing than normal of them, and a national gathering of influential
representatives saw an impressive Minister whom few of them may have
known much about previously.
Thus, his appointment as party chairman probably would be
well-received, even though he comes from a country which has its own
party organisation.
It is too much to say that any new appointment would be welcome after
the unhappy tenure of the amiable but gaffe-prone Mr Hanley.
One suspects that the bruised party faithful are fearful that Mr Major
could come up with someone not a lot better, and that would be as bad as
not replacing him at all.
Mr Lang could contribute something of the clarity and attractive
gravitas previously best demonstrated in the job by Cecil (now Lord)
Parkinson.
Mr Lang also was an active campaigner for Mr Major in the leadership
election and still is regarded as one of his most reliable supporters.
He is also well-placed in the middle of the party and well-regarded by
most, both on the right and left, though not perhaps on the harder
right.
With that curriculum vitae, it might look as though Mr Lang's
appointment could be expected confidently. However, there are two big
snags.
First, who is to replace him as Scottish Secretary? If the popular Sir
Hector Monro, 72, was 10 years younger, there would be no problem. Some
saw the right-wing but popular Allan Stewart as a possibility before his
resignation.
Malcolm Rifkind, one of the most senior members of the Cabinet, could
hardly be returned to Edinburgh from defence.
Which leaves Mr Michael Forsyth. That able, articulate Thatcher
devotee arouses strong emotions, not just among the Scottish Opposition
parties but within the Scottish Conservative Party itself, some of whose
members would be as appalled by his appointment as Messrs Robertson,
Wallace and Salmond.
His term as Scottish party chairman was remembered for, among other
things, opening up the division between the wings of the Scottish party.
Another able right-winger, John Redwood, is ruling Wales at the
moment, without much political return. At least, Mr Forsyth has a
Commons seat in the country he would be running.
It could be that -- faced with the near-impossible task of surviving
the next election with a majority at the last one of 703 and unhelpul
boundary changes -- Mr Forsyth might feel that the higher profile he
would have as Scottish Secretary, instead of English Prisons Minister,
might help him in his fight to hang on to Stirling.
His majority brings us to the second snag for Mr Lang. His majority in
Galloway and Upper Nithsdale is healthier, but, at 2468, not that much
healthier. Given the current climate of public opinion, it is a majority
in intensive care.
The job of UK chairman, which surely now would be held up to the next
election, would allow little time for campaigning on his own patch even
during the General Election.
It is also an appointment which could be exploited by his nearest
challengers, the SNP.
Poor Chris Patten made almost daily helicopter flights from the
election news conferences in London to Bath, and still lost. It would
not be much of a satisfaction to become party chairman if, along with
it, went the strong likelihood that you would lose your own seat.
Mr Patten, who believed he probably would lose it, did the job out of
a sense of loyalty to Mr Major and the party. So might Mr Lang. Some in
the Scottish party see it as a sacrifice that they would rather he was
not asked to make.

Rio de Janeiro, Monday
POLICE killed 14 suspected drug traffickers in a fierce, eight-hour
gun-battle in a Rio slum today, police said.
The shootout, in the Nova Brasilia slum where 13 people were killed by
police last year, began when officers from a bank robbery unit entered
the shantytown shortly before dawn, a police officer involved in the
raid said.
Police believe drug gangs have branched out into other crimes,
including bank robbery and kidnapping, in response to an attempted
crackdown on drugs in the city.
A policeman was seriously injured by a grenade thrown by the
traffickers and was undergoing surgery, the officer said. The total
number of casualties and arrests had not yet been calculated, he added.
A radio station said 15 people were injured and 10 arrested during the
operation, which resulted in the seizure of arms and drugs.
An inquiry into last October's killing by police of 13 suspected drug
traffickers in Nova Brasilia revealed that some of the dead had been
executed. That incident prompted the government to put crime-fighting in
Rio under military control.
Between November and February, troops backed with helicopters and
tanks staged high-profile raids on the shantytown strongholds of drug
traffickers. But the crime rate barely fell and in March security in Rio
was again placed under military control.--Reuter.

Riyadh, Monday,
UP to two million Muslim pilgrims journeyed today from the holy Saudi
city of Mecca to Mina where a fire had earlier swept through part of a
tent city, killing three people.
Workers had re-erected tents in Mina and connected water and power
lines after yesterday's fire. An official said the dead were two Saudis
and an unidentified person.
He added that 78 people, including 66 Saudis, suffered breathing
trouble while 10 people had different degrees of burns. All had left
hospital, he said.
Witnesses said there were no major incidents as the haj pilgrims made
their way from Mecca to Mina to the south in cars, 15,000 buses and on
foot.
Witnesses said several civil defence workers were also injured in the
fire which spread through a 60-acre area.
At dawn tomorrow some two million pilgrims will march to Mount Arafat
as the haj reaches its climax. They will gather later in Mina to stone
three symbols of the devil over the next three days as Muslims around
the world celebrate Eid al-Adha.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
A WAITRESS who alleged she was sexually harassed by a restaurant chef
has been awarded #1500 compensation.
The 28-year-old married woman from Dumbarton claimed she was fired
after she complained that the chef was pestering her.
A Glasgow industrial tribunal found by a majority that she had been
sexually harassed by the chef but ruled that there was insufficient
evidence to decide if she had been dismissed.
The woman told the tribunal that the chef pestered her repeatedly in
the kitchen and in a corridor at the restaurant.
She claimed he put his arms around her from behind, tried to touch her
breasts, and declared ''I love you''. She also alleged that the chef
tried to kiss her and touch her in an intimate manner.
She told the tribunal: ''I told him to stop and he just laughed. I
would say: 'Get off me.' I would throw him off and get as far away from
him as possible. I just felt dirty. I was very upset. I was coming home
from work at night not wanting to go in next day.
''I thought about leaving but I couldn't because I needed the money.''
She said she complained to the owner and the restaurant manager, who
she said had had to pull the chef off her on one occasion.
Neither the restaurant owner nor the chef appeared before the
tribunal.
The restaurant manager denied having to pull the chef off the
waitress. He said she had never complained to him and denied she had
been dismissed.
The tribunal ruled by a majority that her complaint of sex
discrimination was well-founded and awarded her #1500 compensation.
The woman said she took the case to a tribunal to stop the same thing
happening to others. ''I hope what happened to me never happens to
anyone else,'' she said after the hearing.
* The Engineering Employers' Federation today called for employment
law to be simplified after reporting a 10% increase in the number of
industrial tribunal cases it handled last year.
Its 13 regional associations dealt with more than 3000 cases in 1994,
more than double the 1990 figure.
Most of the claims were for unfair dismissal, followed by redundancy
and equal pay disputes. Seven out of 10 claims were settled or withdrawn
before reaching a full industrial tribunal hearing.
Mr Peter Martin, the federation's head of legal affairs, said: ''There
is an urgent need to simplify current statutory individual employment
law, especially aspects of maternity rights, redundancy payments, and
statutory continuity of employment law.''

Addis Ababa, Monday,
ETHIOPIA'S ruling coalition swept towards a new five-year term today
after what was billed as the country's first multi-party general
election.
Analysts said initial counts at polling stations in Addis Ababa
signalled yesterday's election was building up to a rout by the
Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) which was
favoured by an opposition largely boycotting the poll.
''There will be one, all-knowing, omnipotent party running the country
for the next five years,'' said Nebiyu Samuel, head of the largest
opposition party to take part in the election.
''It is speculative but we hear from different quarters that we should
be surprised to win even a single parliament seat,'' he told Reuters.
''The EPRDF was overwhelming.''
In an early setback, however, to the ruling coalition in the capital,
analysts said a preliminary count had a critic of the EPRDF winning a
parliament seat with a big majority.
They said Major Adamsu Zeleke, an independent candidate, received some
1200 votes against 800 for the EPRDF candidate in the same Addis Ababa
district. A total of 368 independents stood across the country for the
new 548-seat parliament.
Official results will be announced in two weeks. Most opposition
parties, dwarfed by the size and organisation of the EPRDF, boycotted
the election for parliament and regional councils in the new nine-state
ethnically-based federation.
''We partly blame them (boycotters) because their not taking part
contributed to the complete dominance of the EPRDF in the election
process,'' said Nebiyu, 42, who came home from the United States in 1991
after EPRDF guerrillas brought down 17 years of brutal Marxist rule.
EPRDF leader President Meles Zenawi is bound to be elected prime
minister, with powerful executive powers, of Ethiopia's new federation.
The new president will be largely a figurehead.
''We have learned some lessons for the future. But now we must lick
our wounds,'' added Nebiyu, who heads the opposition Ethiopian National
Democratic Party (ENDP) with 84 candidates.

Sarajevo, Monday
THE United Nations today ruled out a military response to a Serb
mortar attack on Sarajevo that killed eleven people, a decision which
drew flak from the US and the Bosnian government.
A UN spokesman said a military response to yesterday's attack on
Sarajevo could have ''possible repercussions'' for the UN mission in
Bosnia and therefore would not be used. He said a protest would be sent
to the Bosnian Serbs instead.
US ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright angrily
denounced the move. ''I fail to understand the logic of turning down
such a request given the kinds of activities that have (recently) taken
place in and around Sarajevo,'' she said.
Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith, the UN commander for Bosnia, had
asked for air strikes against Serb positions, but Yasushi Akashi, the
chief UN representative in the Balkans and other officials based in
Zagreb rejected the request.
An official said Zagreb's reasons were fears of reprisals against
peacekeepers, the future of the Sarajevo airlift and tension between
Serbs and Croats in Croatia.
The decision coincided with an attack on Bosnian government positions
in the city from two Bosnian Serb tanks well within the capital's heavy
weapons exclusion zone.
The Bosnian government also reported shelling of Tuzla in northern
Bosnia today, saying four people had died.
The UN had said earlier that it planned to punish Bosnian Serbs for
yesterday's mortar attack and condemned the act as ''heartless evil''.
''We will not do nothing,'' said Colum Murphy, chief UN spokesman in
Sarajevo, earlier today.
Nine soldiers and civilians were killed and up to 40 were wounded in
yesterday's attack on the government-held suburb of Butmir. Two victims
later died of their wounds.
It was the worst single attack on the city since the Market Place
massacre of February 1994 that killed 68.
In Croatia, the UN mission stuck to its allegations that the Croatian
army had maltreated and targeted Serb civilians during an offensive last
week, although it could provide no independent evidence for the
assertions.--Reuter.

<FLAG>SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE PARTY ANNUAL CONFERENCE,CONFERENCE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>978485472</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Robbie Dinwoodie, Scottish Political Correspondent, describes the
gloomy mood of Scottish Conservatives as they prepare for their
conference
You cannot hope
To gag or twist,
Thank God! a Scottish
Conservative &amp; Unionist.
But, seeing what
the man will do
Ungagged, there's
No occasion to.
WITH due acknowledgement to Humbert Wolfe's observation on bribery and
the British journalist, his sentiments sprang to mind last week when the
president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association
announced in solemn tones that he would not be issuing gags to the
thousand or so delegates who turn up tomorrow for the start of their
annual conference in Glasgow.
We can take the word of Mr David McLetchie that he will be neither
handing out gags nor twisting arms up backs, for he is a decent,
honourable man. But would there be any occasion to?
The immediate build-up of poison brought on by local election results
last month which stripped the Tories of future power in municipal
Scotland was lanced at two meetings when activists in Edinburgh and
Glasgow were able to confront Minister of State Lord Fraser and
Secretary of State Ian Lang.
The Labour candidate in Perth and Kinross was able to enjoy his joke
at the weekend that Scotland now has more breeding pairs of ospreys than
it has Tory councillors.
The latter species is extinct across whole swathes of the country, but
when the Conservatives went belly-up in the corresponding elections
south of the Border last week it at least enabled the party's top brass
here to point out that it wasn't just a Scottish problem.
Today will see the official confirmation of last Thursday's Cabinet
decision to force a merger between Scottish Nuclear and its English
counterpart. In spite of some senior Conservatives putting an up-beat
gloss on the concession that the headquarters of the new privatised
company will be based in Scotland, most grassroots Tories remain
sceptical, knowing that such political promises give way to commercial
decision-making.
Throw in other Scottish concerns such as rail privatisation, or
broader concerns about sleaze and bungled decision-making -- of which
last week's will-he-won't-he performance on interest rates was the
latest example -- and there is a great deal for dissidents to get up and
shout about.
But that is not to say there will be much shouting. First of all,
there is the fact that we are already into the Perth and Kinross
by-election. The party is staring defeat -- and probably third place --
in the face anyway, but who wants to put their head above the parapet at
the Royal Concert Hall this week and stand accused of that most heinous
Tory crime, disloyalty?
Although morale is at its lowest ebb for decades, and anger and
frustration are at new peaks, to assume that all this will inevitably
burst out in Glasgow is to misunderstand the nature of Conservative
conferences.
The official description of these is that they are consultative.
More accurately, they are self-congratulatory, even when there is
little cause for self-congratulation, and above all deferential, for
there is always cause for deference.
Eight Cabinet Ministers will attend, culminating in the Prime
Minister. Only one would be likely to receive a hint of a hard time, the
hapless incumbent of the poisoned chair, Mr Jeremy Hanley, Cabinet
Minister without portfolio, party chairman, and all-round scapegoat.
By convention, the chairman from London does not address the full
Scottish conference, but it will be interesting to see whether the
Scottish Conservative Parliamentary Candidates' Association use their
fringe meeting to impress their concerns on him.
In terms of the main business of the conference, it is difficult to
see where the main outpourings of dissent could be.
Tomorrow, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Employment Secretary Michael
Portillo speak on their respective briefs, and it will provide a useful
barometer to see whether the latter is as popular a pretender to the
party leadership north of the Border as he is among some in the South.
Thursday's opening debate on the constitution would have been
interesting at one time, but the party devolutionists are but snow off
dykes these days. Mr Lang's address will be scrutinised like runes for
indications of any change of direction by the party in Scotland.
Then we shall see whether there are Scots Euro-sceptics to match their
south coast counterparts. They do exist, as witnessed by the resolution
(uncalled, as is the case with all the interesting ones) from Mid
Scotland Area Council, demanding that the EU ''abandons its wasteful use
of all other languages in its official workings.'' (Clue: this is not
all languages other than French, or even German.)
On Friday morning, party chairman Sir Michael Hirst will address the
conference, which will look to him for an explanation of where things
have gone wrong and how them can be turned round.
The final debate on Friday carries the biggest chance of bringing
dissent. The motion on transport is almost surreal in its
other-worldliness from debate outside the party.
Argyll and Bute constituency calls for the conference to note the
Government's commitment to infrastructure, applauds the transformation
of roads, buses and airports, and looks forward ''to a similar success
in the restructuring of our rail services.'' That, at least, should
produce something resembling a debate.
Elsewhere, over the three days, the purpose is not debate but
affirmation. The motions selected are uniformly bland in support of
Government policy. Many of those not selected are embarrassing in their
paucity of ideas.
Scottish Young Conservatives are now so thin in membership and
imagination that they put up: ''This conference congratulates HM
Government on 16 years' success in government.''
There are a few murmurings of discontent. Ross, Cromarty and Skye
protests at the concentration of quango chairmanships; Glasgow Maryhill
calls on the Government to recognise the growing gap between rich and
poor; and Bailie John Young of Glasgow thunders the party's greatest
crisis for a century. None of these will be called for debate, nor will
there be discussions of issues as great as local government or the
environment.
Even the officially sanctioned question time on Friday morning, when
delegates will have their say, is blunted by having a platform with just
three on it: SCUA vice-chairwoman Annabel Goldie, former SCUA president
Adrian Shinwell, and Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, MEP for East Sussex and
Kent South.
Had delegates had in the stocks instead Mr Lang, Mr Major and Mr
Hanley, we might have had a session requiring the issuing of gags at the
door, but even then, there would probably have been no occasion to.

DALLAS: Tornadoes and violent storms yesterday battered southern
Oklahoma and Texas, where fierce weather at the weekend killed 21
people. A man and two women were killed yesterday when a tornado ripped
through their homes in Eastman, Oklahoma, and a man died in Canyon,
Texas, when he stepped on to his porch to get a better look at a funnel
cloud.

BERGEN: At least six people were killed when a bus plunged off a ferry
crossing a fjord in western Norway yesterday, police said. Two ferry
passengers were rescued and divers were searching for up to two people
still missing in waters 100ft deep. The driverless bus, with passengers
aboard, plunged off the ferry as it was approaching the quay at Hatvik,
near Bergen.

* Sinn Fein tried to grab the spotlight with a political protest at
the Belfast Marathan yesterday.
Just as the leading runner was heading for the tape a man waving a
''free all political prisoners'' banner rushed on to the course and ran
briefly alongside the runner before being bundled away by marshalls.
The incident happened within 50 yards of the end of the race. The
leading runner, Mr John Ferrin, from North Belfast Harriers, although
shocked, did not miss his stride and went on to win in two hours, 18
minutes, and 40 seconds.
It is believed the protester was later interviewed by police.
The protest did not mar the marathon which had more entrants than for
many years. The event's organisers believe that the upturn in interest
was a result of the IRA and loyalist ceasefires.
Around 900 individual runners and 450 five-strong relay teams took
part in the full marathon and over 1200 more in an associated fun run.
Mrs Patricia Griffin, of County Leatrim, Eire, took the prize in the
ladies' race.
Among the relay teams was one from Warrington which was accompanied by
Colin and Wendy Parry whose 12-year-old son Tim was killed in an IRA
bomb blast in the town.

LABOUR MP Calum MacDonald yesterday urged the Liberal Democrats to
''get off the fence'' and admit that they were closer to his party than
to the Conservatives.
His call came as he prepared to launch an initiative aimed at
developing the existing co-operation between Labour and the Liberal
Democrats, a prospect which angers some of his party colleagues.
The Western Isles MP said: ''Everybody recognises there is a huge
overlap between Labour and Lib Dem policies: on Europe, investment in
public services, on fairer taxation, on democratic change, on a national
minimum wage -- the list is endless.
''It is now time for the Lib Dems to come off the fence they have been
trying to sit on and openly admit this overlap.
''It would mean the Lib Dems no longer had to pretend they were evenly
positioned between Labour and the Tories. Everybody knows that is a big
political fib. It does not do the Lib Dems any credit.''
Mr MacDonald is the chairman of the steering committee for the Labour
Initiative On Co-operation which will publish the first in a series of
pamphlets today.
He emphasised that the new initiative had nothing to do with merger,
pacts or any kind of electoral arrangements.
However, Labour left-winger David Winnick, MP for Walsall North, said
of the new group: ''I fear they have a hidden agenda which is to merge
the two parties.''
He and some of his colleagues oppose closer co-operation with the
Liberal Democrats, recalling that in the early 80s the Gang of Four
Labour right-wingers quit to form the SDP, eventually merging with the
Liberals.
The Labour leadership firmly denied any plans to get closer to the
Liberal Democrats before the next General Election. A spokesman for
Labour leader Tony Blair said: ''There are no pacts. There are no deals,
and how the Liberal Democrats position themselves is entirely a matter
for them.''
As the election approaches, voters will want to know which side the
Liberal Democrats would back in a hung Parliament. At the weekend,
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown warned his party that they must
make up their minds soon about which of the two main players they
preferred.
A Liberal Democrat policy paper to be published next month effectively
scraps the idea of ''equidistance'' between Labour and the Tories,
instead emphasising the party's ''independence''.
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark and Bermondsey,
said yesterday: ''I think the party will vote for a position that says
we are not equidistant between Tories and Labour because we want the
Tories out.''
However, deputy leader Alan Beith said he backed a policy of
''independence'' but did not want the party to become the ''creature of
the Labour Party''.

Berlin,
IN the Bar Patzenhofer in Berlin's fashionable Charlottenburg, there
is something odd about the clock on the wall. It doesn't tell time so
much as allow itself to be electro-magnetically repelled by it.
It works anti-clockwise. Which is not much use if you are half buzzed
and you might need your bed, but you need to be told. Either the clock
is off its face or you are, and it is going to take time to work it all
out.
This is Berlin, all right, perverse to the last. Wilful, cynical,
non-conformist, it was a city that neither Hitler nor Adenauer, to cite
the extremes, could get much of a handle on, and they both felt
disconcerted with the place, probably because of the rebellious mockery
of clocks like the one I'm squinting at now.
It reads quarter-to-ten. In five minutes it will read twenty-to-ten,
which means it will be twenty-past-two, which is twenty-past-one by my
body clock still ticking over patriotically, on the eve of VE Day, to
British standard time. So we're coming along nicely.
Which is what Germany likes to say about itself, even when it is
forced temporarily to turn the clock back for this fiftieth anniversary
of its capitulation. The anniversary supplements have pounded out all
week, sombre and dutiful.
They use the same archival photographs as their British counterparts
but the tone is understandably more solemn, less nostalgic. Fifty Years
Of Peace. The Day Of Liberation.
If that is what the official German voice is saying, this clock is
less politically correct because it advertises its own deceit and it
invites you to collude because it might suit your short-term interests
to cheat time. Closing times are usually negotiable in Berlin bars.
Not here, though. The Bar Patzenhofer is far too tidy and house-proud
a shop to tempt you to waste away an entire night's sleep. This is not
like the twilight zones of the pock-marked bars of East Berlin or
working-class Kreuzburg where tomorrow gets doorstepped.
Outside, you pass the bright shop windows with their strange goldfish
tank annexes out in the middle of the pavements and marvel at the lack
of vandalistic enterprise.
Telephone directories remain in orderly files in their kiosks and even
the streetwalkers look disapprovingly if you cross the main drag of
Kurfurstendamm on a red.
Berlin is a curious mixture of the permissive, the censorious, the
amnesiac, and the oblivious. In that, at least, it reflects the
dichotomies of German opinion on the fiftieth anniversary of its biggest
defeat, reflecting the perennial splits of East and West, old and young.
Yesterday's Der Spiegel commissioned a survey of a 1500 sample by the
Emnid Institute, and only 26% of those over the age of 65 believed that
the Nazi Wermacht Army was involved in the Holocaust, compared to 65% of
those aged between 18 and 34.
By the same 65%, the younger group thought Nazism was entirely a force
for evil, compared with 43% of the pensioners. The post-war expulsion of
14 million ethnic Germans by the Soviets was considered by the 65-plus
group as a graver crime against humanity than the Nazi extermination of
Jews.
The statistics suggest that education is safer than experience. It is
not that the over-65s all lived through the entire 12 years of the Third
Reich, many ended up fighting for it, certainly among the desperate
young conscripts for the final Battle of Berlin.
You learn of 60-year-olds who were weeping boy soldiers when mothers
took away their rifles after their commanders fled from the last of the
street fighting as the Soviet Red Army came forward remorselessly.
Later generations have been encouraged by their teachers' directives
towards ''a sense of historical responsibility, without a complex of
personal guilt''. Their biggest grievance about the war is
over-exposure.
History now has to strike a difficult balance between being
responsible and being made sufficiently entertaining to retain young
attentions.
Professor Hermann Schafer, director of the House of History in Bonn,
the federal republic's award-winning post-1945 museum, admits to an
''info-tainment'' approach with impressionistic sound effects within a
kind of theatre of objects. The danger might be more like info-taint.
You enter a black box to learn about the Holocaust. Through a vent,
you view a citation of the names of victims rolling like film credits
and there is a vague electronic drone for commentary, reminiscent of a
noisy washing machine.
Schafer calls it ''constructed environments'', and he could get a job
at The Tramway theatre in Glasgow any day. One of the exhibits shows a
child's wartime board game called Bomber Auf England.
Among the points-winning targets are Glasgow, Edinburgh, and (for the
ambitious player) Scapa Flow. Perhaps this helps to explain the
perspectives of the current generation of over-65s.
Uncomfortable though it has been for Germany through this year of
painful anniversaries, the clocks have been turning back to assist the
diplomatic process of reconciliatory gestures. After last night's State
Ceremony in Berlin, and the one minute's silence at six-o'clock, there
was an opportunity for the wall clock at the Bar Patzenhofer.
Backwards or forwards, six o'clock reads exactly the same way.

THREE Iron Crosses, tiny but distinctive, were all that marked out Mr
Hans Teske from other veterans at Hyde Park yesterday.
The former German parachutist and his five elderly companions mingled
unobtrusively with the festive crowds.
Their small party was invited by the Royal British Legion to the
German Embassy to represent their country's wartime servicemen at the
weekend commemorations.
''Very good! Especially all the pretty girls,'' joked former first aid
officer Mr Matthias Menzel, 74, when asked for his verdict on the Hyde
Park event.
Mr Hubertus Rogge, who works for the restoration of German war graves
in this country, said: ''We had very good seats for the heads of state
ceremony, very good.''
But however welcome, the group had mixed feelings about an anniversary
marking the end of a bloody war, but also the beginning of further
suffering.
Mr Teske has lived in Britain since 1946, so naturally spoke the best
English of the group. His home town of Stolp was handed over to Polish
rule after the war, his father murdered, his family expelled.
A prisoner-of-war in the US, he was trapped outside his country and
ended up by a series of accidents in Britain. ''There was nothing to
celebrate for us,'' he said.
Others among the group ended the war in Soviet prisoner-of-war camps
and soldier Mr Manfried Galda, only 18 at the time, lost his eyes when
forced to clear a minefield.
Mr Teske wears his Iron Crosses with pride. ''I won this one in
Tunisia for rescuing a British soldier wounded in no man's land in a
minefield,'' he explained, then shrugged: ''It was just a natural thing
to do.''
The British soldier was treated in a German field hospital, and Mr
Teske, 71, hopes to trace him through the computer reunion service
offered at the weekend.
A former Fleet Street print worker, he lives with his French wife,
Claudette, in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.
Boys at an English public school were barred from hoisting the Union
Flag at a VE Day rally -- but the European Union flag was allowed to
stay.
After realising that only the blue and gold EU flag was flying from
the tower of the Roman Catholic Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire,
some boys decided to put on their own show.
Using broom handles as flagpoles they climbed out of windows on to the
roof of the halls of residence, waving more than 20 traditional red,
white and blue Union Flags and the Stars and Stripes.
The rally was halted by headmaster Fr Leo Chamberlain.
One boy said: ''The European flag was flown because it was thought
appropriate for the day. Even after our flags came down it remained in
place.
''But many of us have fathers and especially grandfathers who fought
in the Second World War, so we decided to honour them ourselves. Flags
usually fastened to walls in our rooms were taken down and nailed to
broom handles.''
Fr Leo was said to be too busy to answer questions.

IF the Government were to introduce compulsory insurance cover for
climbers it would not save one life in the Scottish hills, Scottish MPs
and mountain safety experts said yesterday.
The Commons All-Party Scottish Sports Group was visiting Glenmore
Lodge in the Cairngorms on a fact-finding trip at the invitation of the
Scottish Sports Council.
There have already been 24 deaths on the Scottish mountains this year.
Last year there were 28, while 1993 was one of the worst years with 40.
As the parties gathered at Glenmore Lodge the dramatic mountain rescue
was under way in Skye. However, no-one could see how this or any other
incident would have been prevented by compulsory insurance.
Chairman of the parliamentary group Mr Dennis Canavan, Labour MP for
Falkirk West, said: ''We were told this morning that there is no country
in the world where there is compulsory insurance. I certainly would be
against any such legislation.
''What would happen if somebody didn't have an insurance policy --
would they be left to die in the mountains because they weren't insured?
The whole thing is unthinkable.''
Liberal Democrat MP Sir Russell Johnston agreed: ''I think the reality
is that when you are engaged in a sport which carries a risk there will
be accidents and where there are accidents there will be fatalities.
Every time there is a fatality people say this must be stopped, but it
can't be stopped.
''People like risks. The important thing Government can do is to
ensure that centres such as this are properly resourced so they can
train instructors effectively and warn people of the level of risk.''
Mr Andy Anderson, principal of Glenmore Lodge, said that research had
shown that 73% of those who had got into trouble on the hills had not
realised they were at risk.
''This was from a mountain rescue survey and it is dangerous to take
the figures out of context because they represent only 0.1% of the total
taking part.''
Mr Anderson agreed it was an uphill struggle getting the message
across but it had to be remembered that 99.9% were out enjoying the
hills without getting into trouble. The enormous increase in
participation perhaps made it appear worse than it was.
There had been a 528% increase in climbing over the past 30 years and
a 40% increase in roped activity in the past three years. He also
stressed that the current review of the #68,000 a year Scottish
Avalanche Service was not an attempt to abolish it.
''Nothing could be further from the truth. What we are doing is
reviewing our provision, which is now six years old, to ensure that it
continues to provide the best possible service.''

VETERAN paratroopers snubbed an official VE Day ceremony yesterday to
hold a minute's silence for Private Lee Clegg outside Wakefield jail.
Pte Clegg has been behind bars since 1992, when he was charged and
convicted of shooting Karen Reilly, 18, a passenger in a car driven
through an Army checkpoint in Belfast in 1990.
Members of Wakefield Para Regimental Association stood in silence as a
protest at the sentence and other comrades boycotted an official
ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of VE Day.
Association secretary, Mr Roland Mathery, said: ''We're all very
bitter that someone is being kept in prison for merely carrying out his
duties.
''We have argued time and time again that he should be freed and that
is why we are having a minute's silence and wearing yellow ribbons.''
The Hull branch of the Parachute Regiment Association decided not to
raise their standard in the parade through the city and instead held
their own ceremony.
Association secretary, Mr Trevor Wright, said: ''Everyone is saying it
is a celebration but we have no cause to celebrate when a man is in
jail. We are doing everything we can to support him.
''We told our members they could take part in the parade if they
wanted but our standard would not be there.
''We are not ignoring VE Day but we are hoping to get our point
across. It is a matter of principle and we must stick by it.''
Pte Clegg's mother, Mrs Wynne Johnson, said yesterday: ''Lee will be
feeling really proud of his regiment, that he belongs to, and proud of
the people who are still supporting him.''
She added: ''He will also be observing a two-minute silence for the
soldiers who died in the war.''

THE wartime spirit returned yesterday after arsonists burnt down a
marquee set up for a village's VE Day celebrations.
Organisers of the event at Stock, near Brentwood, Essex, were flooded
with pledges to help after making an appeal over local radio. Two people
offered replacement marquees and others were willing to give chairs,
plates and cutlery. The event included a dance last night at which 400
people were expected.
Flags stolen
POLICE are hunting a sneak thief who stole 13 flags from poles on
Llandudno promenade, in North Wales, early yesterday. The flags had been
raised as part of the town's VE Day commemoration.
Fawlty's rules
STUART Hughes, 45, offered visitors half-price accommodation at his
Fawlty Towers guest house in Sidmouth, Devon, last night -- as long as
they didn't mention the war.
Liner's visit
THE Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth II yesterday made her first visit to
Plymouth, during a week-long VE Day commemorative cruise. Passengers
have been re-living the period with Second World War films, big band
cabaret entertainment and lectures from Dr Gordon Mitchell, whose father
designed the Spitfire. The liner is due to visit Guernsey today for the
Channel island's liberation celebrations.
Veteran link
A COMPUTERISED ''veteran link'' service set up for the commemorations
in Hyde Park has reunited more than 1000 old soldiers. During the three
days, more than 3500 veterans registered their details on the BT Veteran
Link database and more than 2500 searched through the lists for former
friends and comrades from the war. BT is to continue operating its free
Veteran Link registration service in its shops throughout the UK until
May 13.
Swastika shock
LANDLORD Mr John Reddcliff yesterday vowed to track down the prankster
who marred his VE Day by draping a swastika flag over his pub sign at
the Upper Bilson Inn, Cinderford, Gloucestershire. ''If I find that the
person responsible for this evil act was one of my regulars, he will
never drink here again,'' he said. ''It was too high up for me to reach,
so the fire brigade came in and took it down. The police have taken the
flag away -- I hope they destroy it.''
Time for cake
A DOZEN friends who were schoolchildren when they enthusiastically
celebrated VE Day with a street party returned home yesterday to mark
its 50th anniversary. The friends were among a throng of smiling faces
photographed tucking into jelly and cake in Bolton Road, Undercliffe,
Bradford, West Yorkshire on May 8, 1945.
Tanks roll again
ARMOURED vehicles from the Bovington tank museum paraded along the
beach at Weymouth, Dorset, yesterday. The port was the embarkation point
for tens of thousands of troops on their way across the Channel to
European war theatres. The sailing ship Lord Nelson led a sail-past in
front of thousands gathered in the sunshine on Plymouth Hoe.
Ireland quiet
VE Day anniversary ceremonies were almost non-existent in the Irish
Republic, where the Second World War period is referred to as The
Emergency. The republic remained neutral throughout the war, operating
under special emergency powers, though many Irish people -- from both
Northern Ireland and the south -- joined and fought alongside the
British forces.
Protest day
THREE hundred people gathered at Stonehenge, in Wiltshire, yesterday
to honour those who died in the war and to protest against what they
claim is an erosion of the rights so many fought for. The Freedom
Network, an environmental pressure group, said it wanted to see a
Caravan Sites Act, giving gypsies and travellers somewhere to live.
Going cheap
PERTH commemorated VE Day yesterday with cheap drink for veterans. The
Royal British Legion in George Street was offering a free drink of
spirits to its members and pints cost 10 shillings -- 50p. The Kings
Arms, in George Street, was offering a free pint to anyone who handed
over an old half-crown piece.
Seeing red
PEOPLE living near Ye Olde Red Horse pub in Evesham, Worcestershire,
are complaining -- after landlord Mr Keith Ludlow painted it red, white
and blue. Mr Ludlow promises to restore the historic inn's vertical
pillars to black and white after the celebrations.

Moscow,
PRIME Minister John Major was to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin
briefly in the Kremlin this morning after watching a march past through
Red Square by veterans of the Great Patriotic War -- the Russian name
for the Second World War.
The parade of 5000 Russian veterans was scheduled for 9am today.
After he sees the president, Mr Major will lay a wreath at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier in the Androvsky Gardens just outside the Kremlin's
walls.
He will then go to Poklonnaya Gora for the opening of a massive
memorial complex the Russians have erected outside the city. But he is
unlikely to see the military parade which is being held there.
Some of the other world leaders including President Mitterrand,
Chancellor Kohl and the Canadian Prime Minister Mr Jean Chretien, either
have other engagements or will arrive too late for the military display.
It is thought that none of them wishes to be filmed watching the
parade which could include Russian troops who have served in Chechnya.
The event promises to awaken memories of Soviet times, since no such
show of military might has been seen in Moscow since the fall of
Communism.
Some 10,000 soldiers, 253 tanks, an unspecified number of armoured
personnel carriers and 70 war planes will be taking part.
Mr Major will be present at the unveiling of the monument and is
expected to make a brief speech before touring a new state museum which
deals with the history of the war.
This afternoon Mr Major will unveil a plaque commemorating a British
war mission to Moscow before he attends a state banquet in the Kremlin
along with the other 50 heads of state or government who have come to
the Russian capital.
All EC countries are represented by their leaders, as are all the
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
As far as the people of Moscow are concerned, there will be a May Ball
for the veterans and in the afternoon a parade with brass bands from the
Belorussky station to Red Square. The day will end with what is promised
to be a spectacular fireworks display from 33 sites around the city.
Yesterday central Moscow was closed to traffic as President Yeltsin
inaugurated the celebrations. He laid a wreath at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier and then unveiled an equestrian statue of Field Marshall
Zhukhov, just outside Red Square.
He also addressed an assembly of veterans in the Great Hall of the
Palace of Congresses. As a result, Moscow was full of elderly men and
women, some in uniform, torsos plated with medals which rattled as they
walked.
In a little park in front of the Bolshoi Theatre one veteran with an
accordion was playing and two women in uniform decked with medals were
dancing to the delight of the crowd.
It was a day of parades throughout Russia. On television there were
wreath-laying ceremonies and parades from cities all over the country.
Moscow itself was bedecked with flags and banners in preparation for
today's festivities.
Later today Mr Major and Irish Premier John Bruton are to have talks
about the situation in Northern Ireland during a break in the VE Day
celebrations.
The meeting will be at the British Embassy in Moscow and comes as the
first meeting between Sinn Fein and a British Minister is due to take
place. It is thought that Mr Major will use the occasion to update Mr
Bruton on the situation.

Paris,
A FEW hours after the last of hundreds of thousands of revellers
celebrating the election of Jacques Chirac as President had staggered
home to bed yesterday morning, the Champs Elysees were cleaned of empty
bottles and beer cans to become the scene of France's tribute to the
50th anniversary of Victory in Europe and the defeat of Nazism.
In sharp contrast to the relaxed commemoration in Hyde Park,
yesterday's austere military ceremony in Paris attributed no role to
Second World War veterans and kept members of the public cautiously at
bay behind crash barriers.
The celebration also marked the apotheosis of the 14-year term of
office of President Mitterrand and was carried out in the presence of
two French heads of state -- the outgoing socialist president and his
brand new Gaullist successor, Mr Chirac.
Under a hot sunny sky, 80 heads of state and governments were
chauffeured around 10am yesterday to the top of the Champs Elysees,
where they joined some 9000 other personalities waiting on podiums
around the Arc de Triomphe.
Prime Minister John Major chatted with American Vice-President Al Gore
and his wife. King Juan Carlos of Spain, in full dress uniform, arrived
with Queen Sophia, and Prince Rainier of Monaco was escorted by his son,
Prince Albert. The Duke of Edinburgh represented the Queen.
The star of the morning was Mr Chirac, who arrived after the guests
with his wife, Bernadette, from their private apartment in City Hall
which he occupies as Mayor of Paris.
The new and visibly elated president was given a celebrity mobbing by
distinguished guests, including Mr Major, who moved quickly from his
seat and craned over two rows of white plastic chairs to pay his
respects. Gallant, President Chirac went down on one knee to pick up a
scarf dropped by Mrs Danielle Mitterrand.
It was that lady's husband who really stole the day. While monarchs
and republican presidents alike perspired under the transparent plastic
awnings, President Mitterrand arrived, as ever, late. He was driven up
the deserted Champs Elysees at walking pace in a car escorted by 72 men
from the crack Republican Guard, half of them on horseback and the
others on motorcycles.
President Mitterrand then climbed into a command car and very slowly
circled the Arc de Triomphe, reviewing his troops. He was escorted to
his seat, after a moment's hesitation as to which way to go, by Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur, the main loser of the first round of the
presidential election, and defence minister Francois Leotard.
After a chaotic five minutes of handshaking, President Mitterrand sat
down to watch an acrobatic motorcycle display and listen to every single
verse of the ferociously anti-royalist French National Anthem, La
Marseillaise, performed by the band of the Republican Guard.
President Mitterrand then led all his 80 VIP guests, headed by a Duke
of Edinburgh evidently anxious to get on with the ceremony, across to
the Arc de Triomphe, where they observed a minute's silence and
rekindling of the flame on the tomb of the unknown soldier.
Guests were then treated to a march past by all the military units
present, before bussing back to the Elysee palace for lunch.

Berlin,
THE great London to Moscow peace tour rolled into Berlin last night on
the third and penultimate stage of its journey, this time to unite the
victors and the defeated on the very ground where the Second World War
ended 50 years ago.
The stately Schauspielhaus in former East Berlin was almost completely
destroyed in the air raids of 1944 and 1945, but its renovation as a
major concert hall was symbolic of the message of harmony and a new
Europe.
The formal State ceremony was hosted by Chancellor Helmut Kohl who
shook hands warmly with British Prime Minister John Major, French
President Francois Mitterrand, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and United States Vice President Al Gore, after each had
delivered speeches to an invited audience.
They followed German President Roman Herzog who called for an honest
and unconditional approach to history and a consolidation of European
understanding.
He accepted Germany's ''collective shame'' over the Holocaust but
Germany would atone by proving itself a reliable and peaceful partner.
Differences of interest might continue, but never again would they be
worth settling by military means. State nationalism belonged to the last
century.
This half of the century had established co-operation above
sovereignty, founded on peace, freedom and prosperity.
On the difficult question of defeat or liberation which has troubled
Germany in the past two months, President Herzog equivocally suggested
this failed to take adequate account of the different experiences of
different people.
His personal view was May 8, 1945, opened a ''gateway to the future''.
It was a ''gift'' received out of a sea of blood and a mountain of
rubble.
Mr Major painted a picture of a ''new age of reason'' after the defeat
of the two great enemies of reason, fascism and communism.
It was a curiously inaccurate version of history in a sector of Berlin
that had fallen to the Soviet Red Army, but this was a day for if not
exactly re-writing history, presenting it in a new gloss.
His contention that 1945 would prove the last time the represented
countries would ever fight each other drew applause, as did his later
reference to settling differences by compromise instead of violence.
The warmest reception was for President Mitterrand, making a farewell
speech on the international diplomatic platform. It was a moving
performance, personal, almost avuncular and valedictory.
He talked philosophically of the areas in which victory and defeat
merged, and he related his theme to his personal experiences as a
25-year-old prisoner of war, a soldier of a defeated and occupied nation
who owed his renewal of hope to the humanity and honesty of his captors.
His was the most directly forgiving speech towards his own generation of
Germans, who, he said, had fought in a bad cause to defend their
country.
It might have been the generous accommodation of a man preparing to
relinquish both office and life, and it offended Israeli pressmen in the
international corps, but it earned the 75-year-old president a standing
ovation when he ended his speech by affirming the necessity for human
solidarity and 1945 as a victory for Europe over itself.
The US Vice President permutated a new theme for VE Day as ''Not a
victory in Europe, but for Europe''. His tribute to twelve million
American men and women who ''stood in defence of liberty'' drew further
strong, if Pavlovian, applause.
Mr Chernomyrdin made what appeared to some commentators as a bid for
Russian involvement in Nato with a call for a unified security system
for the continent of Europe. Everyone should have a part in building
European stability in Europe, as part of a new world for the third
millennium.
Significantly, Mr Chernomyrdin acknowledged the Katyn Forest massacre
of Polish officers, long denied by the Soviet Union but more recently
admitted by Russia, as one of the Second World War crimes.
Berlin itself reflects the dichotomies of German opinion on the
fiftieth anniversary of its biggest defeat, reflecting the perennial
splits of East and West, old and young.
Yesterday's Der Spiegel commissioned a survey of a 1500 sample by the
Emnid Institute, and only 26% of those over the age of 65 believed that
the Nazi Wermacht Army was involved in the Holocaust, compared to 65% of
those aged between 18 and 34.
By the same 65%, the younger group thought Nazism was entirely a force
for evil, compared with 43% of the pensioners. The post-war expulsion of
14 million ethnic Germans by the Soviets was considered by the 65-plus
group as a graver crime against humanity than the Nazi extermination of
Jews.
The statistics suggest that education is safer than experience.

<HEADLINE>Student dies after 'hell-hole' ordeal. Climbers spent 48 hours trapped on rock face, frozen and unable to sit or lie down</HEADLINE>

A YOUNG climber who spent more than 48 hours stuck on a Scottish
mountain rock-face died in hospital late last night.
Mr Tom Taylor, 21, a student, of Midmills Road, Inverness, had been
taken unconscious to Broadford Hospital on Skye yesterday after his
weekend ordeal in the Cuillins.
Early today, a hospital spokeswoman said Mr Taylor had died despite
extensive attempts to resuscitate him.
It is understood that his mother and father, a consultant
haematologist at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, were at their son's
bedside when he died.
Mr Taylor, a sociology student at Inverness College, and his climbing
partner, Mr Ian Meek, 30, a food technologist from Billingham in
Cleveland, became trapped by their twisted ropes on An Stac on Saturday.
Both men were suffering from hypothermia, but the hospital said last
night that Mr Meek was now in a satisfactory condition.
Details of their plight emerged yesterday. Flight Sergeant Jim Smith,
leader of the RAF Kinloss mountain rescue team, said the two men were
left hanging from their abseiling ropes at a height of 2600ft and 500ft
from the summit of the rock face on An Stac.
Both attached themselves with climbing equipment they were carrying
against the rock face to secure their position but, during the entire
ordeal, were not able to sit or lie down.
Once they were secured against the rock face, all they could do was
blow their whistles hoping to attract attention.
There were rock falls around them all the time they were trapped. The
falling rocks also endangered the rescuers who were trying to reach
them.
Flt Sgt Smith said: ''Because of the poor weather conditions and
visibility down to 30 metres, none of the rescuers was able to pinpoint
the position of the two trapped men on Sunday evening.
''All anybody could do was shout to them. The RAF team was withdrawn
for the night but the Skye team leader, Gerry Ackroyd, remained through
the night with four of his members to keep contact with the two men and
give them moral support.
''At first light, one of his men climbed up on his own to a position
as near as he could to where the climbers were and tried to throw a rope
to them.
''This was incredibly difficult and took a very long time . . . The
two men had to attach themselves to the rescue rope and cut themselves
loose, which was very difficult in their condition.
''When they were first spotted, they were both huddled inside an
orange survival bag but when we saw them today this had fallen off down
the rock face during the night.''
Flt Sgt Smith added: ''Once the two men were ready to be lowered down
the cliff the next part of the operation to get them to the bottom
lasted eight hours. The whole rescue operation took 12 hours.''
Members of the two mountain-rescue teams inched their way up a
dangerous ''rotten-rock'' gully to reach the men, who were taken down to
a Sea King helicopter waiting below the cloud line. They were then taken
to hospital.
The men, who were with a party from Inverness Mountaineering Club,
went out on an abseiling expedition on Saturday morning around 8am.
They spent Saturday night in the open but their desperate plight was
not known until lunchtime on Sunday.
Charter-boat skipper Donald MacKinnon, 26, of the Bella Jane, in Loch
Coruisk -- a 10-mile long sea loch which penetrates into the heart of
the Cuillins, met 16 members of Inverness Mountaineering Club who were
worried about their two overdue companions.
Mr MacKinnon immediately contacted his uncle, Mr Ewen MacKinnon, a
member of the Skye Mountain Rescue team, who called police and started
one of the most difficult mountain rescue missions of the year.
Skye Mountain Rescue team leader Mr Gerry Ackroyd said the rescue spot
was ''an absolute hell-hole of a place'' which climbers should avoid at
all costs. However, the sheer survival instinct had forced the freezing
men, especially Mr Meek, to respond to bullying by the rescuers, which
allowed him to help operate ropes to help save himself and his
colleague.
Mr Ackroyd said he could only conclude that the climbers had lost
their bearings in the thick fog while they were negotiating the main
ridge of the Cuillins on Saturday.
He added: ''I'm sure they must have got lost because they should not
have been attempting to make a descent within half-a-mile of the place
where they got themselves stuck. The problem with the rock there is that
there is no hold on it.''
The Cuillins drama followed another on nearby Sgurr Dubh Mhor on
Saturday afternoon, when Newcastle-on-Tyne University student Emrys
Jones sustained compound fractures to both legs and a broken arm when he
fell 30ft. His rescue, also by members of the Skye Mountain Rescue team,
took until the early hours of Sunday morning.
* Two climbers were airlifted to safety late last night after getting
stuck on Buachaille Etive Mor in Glencoe.
A rescue helicopter from HMS Gannet, Prestwick, is understood to have
flown the climbers to Fort William. They are not thought to have been
injured. A Northern Constabulary spokesman in Inverness said it appeared
the alarm was raised after a male and female climber became exhausted
and could not move any further.

AS a lone piper played a war-time lament, Edinburgh's Lord Provost,
Norman Irons, last night set the seal on Scotland's celebration of VE
Day.
About 200 people gathered on the city's Calton Hill to watch the
poignant ceremony, which was beamed live to giant screens in Hyde Park,
London.
Steve Young, of Polkemmet Pipe Band, played Flowers of the Forest as
Mr Irons lit a ceremonial beacon after the two-minute silence.
As he did, flames from the bonfire singed the Lord Provost's eyebrows,
making him jump back quickly. Afterwards, he said he had been taken by
surprise at how quickly the flames had taken hold.
Mr Irons described the VE Day events as a significant celebration and
commemoration and hopefully a day of reconciliation. He singled out war
widows he had met at a ceremony in St Giles' Cathedral earlier in the
day for special praise. ''These women are amazing people, who deserve
respect and praise,'' said Mr Irons.
Before the Calton Hill ceremony, the Lord Provost took some blind
children round the bonfire to give them an idea of its size. He also
chatted to Army cadets who attended the ceremony.
Mr John Nisbet, 56, chairman of Edinburgh and Lothian area council of
the Royal British Legion Scotland, said VE Day in Scotland had been both
poignant and moving. ''It's vital to remind people of the sacrifices
made during the war years,'' said Mr Nisbet. ''Today has brought that
back into people's minds.''
The Edinburgh beacon was one of several lit all over Scotland,
including Girvan, Aberdeen, and Hawick.

The future of Gaelic TV soap opera
Machair is under threat.
Members of the programme's crew, currently filming on Lewis, say they
have been warned that the series may be cut to 18 episodes a year
instead of the present 26.
Senior executives from makers Scottish Television and Scottish
Television Enterprises will meet representatives of funders Comataidh
Telebhisein Gaidhlig later this week to try to thrash out a deal.
CTG director Mr John Angus Mackay confirmed: ''We will be meeting with
Scottish TV and STE on Friday.
''The aim is to try and secure the long-term future of Machair.''
It is understood TV chiefs are not satisfied with the #1.2m they get
from the CTG for the series.
An insider said: ''If there is no deal reached soon, we have been told
that the next block of shooting at the end of the summer may be cut to
only five episodes instead of 13. That would mean only 18 episodes a
year.
''Some people obviously think that Machair may have reached the end of
its useful life.
''Although the series is in its third year, the same students are in
the same classes doing the same thing as they were at the very
beginning.
''Machair students are like Oor Wullie. They never get older and
graduate.'' Fifty crew members and cast are involved in the making of
Machair, which is shown on Scottish TV and Grampian and shot mainly on
location on Lewis.
Scottish TV caused a row recently with proposals to cut costs by
making most of the series in studios in Glasgow.

THE Labour Euro-MP for the South of Scotland, Mr Alex Smith, has
attacked a restructuring plan by supermarket giant Safeway, which will
hit the middle management of the company.
Mr Smith claimed yesterday that departmental managers were being
forced to reapply for their own jobs on lower rates of pay.
He said: ''This is an absolute scandal. My information is that, over
the next few weeks, departmental managers at Safeway stores in Scotland
will receive notification from the company that they will have to
reapply for their jobs and that the new rates will be significantly
lower than their current levels of pay.''
Mr Smith added: ''Here we have a company which is in a very profitable
state turning the screw on loyal employees who have done so much to
secure a continued increase in the company's takings.''
Safeway is understood to be undertaking a similar type of
restructuring to that already carried out by its main competitors --
Tesco and Sainsbury.
A spokesman for the shopworkers' union Usdaw said, however, that staff
would not be reapplying for their current jobs but for new jobs which
would be quite different from their current positions.
Mr Ian Fraser, Usdaw area organiser, said: ''Usdaw is concerned about
the implications of this restructuring on our members and discussions
with the company are continuing. We are continuing to raise a number of
matters with the company and are waiting for the company to respond to
these.
''We appreciate Alex Smith's interest in this matter and will take
assistance from any quarter.''
A spokesman for Safeway said: ''Safeway and Presto are going through a
period of reorganisation and this may involve some job losses but the
company hopes to redeploy as many staff as possible.''
Meanwhile, the battle for customers among Britain's top supermarkets
seems set to continue with the publication of the latest financial
results.
In the City, Sainsbury is expected to post significantly higher
profits than Tesco this week.
Broker UBS stated yesterday that it had pencilled in pre-tax profits
of #810m for Sainsbury against #368.6m for the previous year to the end
of March -- figures which would confirm the group as the UK's most
profitable supermarket chain.
''The main news will be the current sales growth in the Sainsbury
chain, where the prospects are not good,'' UBS stated. Sales of more
than 2% would be regarded as satisfactory.
Leading discounter Kwik Save last week revealed some of the scars of
the fierce competition in the sector as half-year profits and sales fell
away. During the 28 weeks to March 11, pre-tax profits slipped to #61.6m
from #65.4m in the same period in the previous year. Overall sales at
Kwik Save stores, excluding Shoprite, grew by 3.1% but on comparable
selling areas sales were 3.5% down.
The group had grim news about current trading. Since the middle of
March, like-for-like sales remained down by 3%, although total sales
were up 7.4%. Analysts believe most of the price cutting in the
supermarkets sector is now over but the attempt to rebuild margins --
the difference between buying and selling prices -- will be painfully
slow.

SHELL has sent the Brent Spar protesters two warnings about the risk
they face on board the redundant tanker loading terminal which they took
over 10 days ago.
A fax and a radio message were sent from the nearby Brent Alpha
platform giving the Greenpeace protesters what Shell says was ''safety
information for their own protection on board the installation''.
So far Shell has taken no action to attempt to end the take-over of
the installation 118 miles north-east of Shetland.
Greenpeace press officer Martyn Lodewyjkx said last night from the
Brent Spar: ''The fax was slightly different to the radio message. The
radio message from the radio operator on behalf of Shell Expro said we
should get off immediately because it is hazardous.
''We have told Shell we will get off immediately they make public that
they are not going to dump the Brent Spar in the Atlantic. They must
bring it ashore to dispose of in the best possible way environmentally.
''None of the precautions which Shell advised us about were new to us.
We have professional engineers and seamen on board Brent Spar and we are
well aware of all the dangers and the safety precautions which are
required.''
Mr Lodewyjkx said they had been advised not to enter any enclosed
areas because of the dangers of fumes. The Greenpeace crew had breathing
apparatus and fume sensing equipment on board.
A Shell spokeswoman said they had faxed the routine safety precautions
to them to ensure no one was injured. ''The advice is for their own
protection because the last thing we want is for anyone to be hurt.''
Shell plans to tow the terminal to the Atlantic and sink it later this
year. It claims this method of disposal, which has been agreed by the
Government, was decided on after a full evaluation of the technical,
environmental, safety and cost factors.
However, Greenpeace accuses the company of taking the cheap option and
claims that the dumping could result in the release of toxic waste.
The Brent Spar protesters are planning to start a radio broadcast from
the installation. They hope North Sea oil and gas workers will tune into
the ''Save the Seas'' station, which will have its own presenter.

By RAYMOND DUNCAN
A BOY and a grandparent who had brought him up since birth died
yesterday when fire swept through a house in East Lothian.
A smoke alarm had been installed in the council house and could have
warned its four occupants of the fire, but it did not sound.
The alarm had a battery and an investigation will look at the
possibility of a fault in this vital part of the life-saving equipment.
Seven years ago, a family of four, including two young children, were
found dead under a window of their council home in Tranent. That
incident led to an East Lothian district policy of fitting smoke
detectors in all council homes.
In yesterday's fire, neighbours, one using a ladder, tried to reach
the three adults and one child inside the house in Schaw Road,
Prestonpans, but were driven back by dense black smoke.
The 10-year-old boy who died was Thomas Gray, described by one
relative as ''a magic wee boy''. He was said to be football mad.
''Toto'', as he was known to his friends at Prestonpans Primary School
and other players in his local football team, had been brought up by his
grandparents.
His grandfather Mr Thomas Somerville, 58, the manager of an Edinburgh
branch of Morrisons the bookmakers, was also killed in the blaze,
thought to have broken out in the kitchen and been caused by an
overheated chip pan.
Grandmother Mrs Anna Somerville, 50, a catering assistant at Cockenzie
Power Station, was rescued by firefighters and taken to Edinburgh's
Royal Infirmary.
Her son from a previous marriage, Mr Gary Currie, 24, was also taken
to hospital. They were being treated for severe smoke inhalation.
Mr Tom Kelly, 49, a neighbour who had been out walking his dog shortly
after 1am, told of hearing a cry for help and then seeing smoke
billowing from a rear bedroom window.
''I got a ladder and when I climbed to the top I was talking to Tam
Somerville although I couldn't see him. I told him to open the window
but he said he couldn't. I broke it with a brick but I couldn't put my
head in.
''The smoke was thick and it was pitch black. Then it just went
quiet,'' said Mr Kelly.
Mr Kelly, a bricklayer, described the dead boy, whose bedroom was
above the kitchen, as ''a wee gem''.
Mr William Gilbert, of Rope Walk, Prestonpans, a cousin of Mr
Somerville, said the boy's mother, Ms Alison Gray, who now stays in the
Bingham area of Edinburgh with two sons, James, three, and Christopher,
two, was in shock: ''She just can't take it in.''
It is understood she had handed Thomas over to her parents as a baby
because of domestic difficulties. However, she remained close to him and
visited him regularly at their Prestonpans house.
Mr Gilbert said the schoolboy, a keen Hibs fan, recently had agreed to
move from Hawthorn Boys football club to Tranent.
''He was always seen kicking a ball. He was a super left back and was
attracting a lot of interest from other clubs,'' he said.
''He was actually playing against Tranent on Sunday and was
disappointed his team had been beaten 3-2.''
The Hawthorn Boys was formed by families in the close Prestonpans
community in 1992. Mr Robert Strachan, club leader, said yesterday: ''He
was a quiet, well-behaved wee laddie, and a genuinely good player.''

THE Scotch Whisky Association has come up with what must be the
ultimate tourist attraction -- distilleries the length and breadth of
Scotland offering free drams for a day.
As many as 38 distilleries from Orkney to the Lowlands will throw open
their doors on May 27 to promote Scotland's most famous product.
The world's longest whisky trail will stretch from as far north as
Orkney's Highland Park distillery to as far south as Glenkinchie in
Pencaitland, East Lothian, and Drambuie at Kirkliston, outside
Edinburgh.
Distilleries as remote as Bowmore, Bunnahabhain, and Lagavulin on
Islay are also taking part.
For serious drinkers it could provide the ultimate crawl, several
hundred miles by road, air, and ferry to sample each tot on offer. For
virtually every one is offering visitors either a free dram or a
miniature to take home.
''It will enable visitors to unravel the myths and mysteries of
distilling, and at Bowmore people will be able to watch the Whisky
Olympics as well,'' said Mr Campbell Evans of the Scotch Whisky
Association.
The Whisky Olympics, it should be stressed, involve a Highland games
extravaganza rather than a demonstration of spectacular drinking.
Ms Elizabeth Lafferty, of William Grant, owners of the Glenfiddich
distillery at Dufftown, said whisky sales in the UK were still static.
''We live in hope that this open day might encourage more people to
take up whisky,'' she said.
Whisky sales actually fell by 3% in the first 10 months of last year.
The industry is desperate to promote the product, with some companies
even suggesting the ultimate sacrilege -- whisky cocktails.
Mr Richard Joynson, of Loch Fyne Whiskies, Inveraray, said: ''I take
my whisky with plain water, no ice, no fizz.
''But it's up to you. Other people can take it with licorice for all I
care -- just as long as they don't do it in front of me.''

<HEADLINE>Big bird with attitude fights back in the Highlands</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978485508</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE capercailzie -- a 30lb grouse-like bird native to Scotland -- is
making a comeback.
Twenty years ago, the Highlands boasted 20,000 of the birds -- today
there are only 2500.
Now, there are signs, at the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds' Abernethy reserve in Strathspey, that the bird is fighting back.
''Last year was the most successful in the Abernethy reserve,
certainly since we bought it in 1988,'' said RSPB spokesman David
Mitchell.
He said research had pinpointed a variety of measures which could be
taken to help the capercailzie.
They included removing or re-siting deer fences in pine woods, the
favoured habitat of the ''caper'', because birds are killed when they
fly into them.
Controlling predators such as foxes, protecting blaeberries -- their
favourite food -- and reducing disturbance when the females are nesting,
are among other ways of helping numbers recover.
While the population of capercaillie may be stabilising, it is highly
unlikely they will ever again become as prevalent as in the days when
they were found from Stirling north to Sutherland and west to Argyll.
''The main problem is that they once had something like one hundred
times the amount of pine woods that they have now,'' said Mr Mitchell.
''That's one reason that we are trying very hard with other
organisations to get more of the native pine wood back, with the target
of increasing it maybe by 3% a year for the next 30 years.
''Their range has decreased enormously. The bulk of the population is
now in Strathspey, Upper Deeside, some in Perthshire, with a small
population on the islands in Loch Lomond because they don't have any
ground predators like the fox there,'' he said.
The capercailzie is a formidable fowl, with a beak so large and strong
that it can snap thick branches. One particular bird, which is known to
have attacked humans, has been dubbed the ''mad caper''.
Mr Mitchell said: ''Virtually always, they are frightened of humans
and will fly off. But you get the occasional one which attacks Land
Rovers or cars.''
On the bird's future, he said: ''The picture is still very mixed but
there is a general feeling that the corner has been turned and the
future is looking a bit rosier.''

<TEXT>
A REPORT by the Prison Reform Trust has criticised plans for a British
boot camp -- a tough, military-style institution for young offenders.
The trust claims Home Office Ministers have ignored advice by
officials that there was little point in spending time and money on an
initiative that had little to offer.
Its director, Mr Stephen Shaw, said yesterday: ''Military-style
discipline may have a special resonance on VE Day. In fact, boot camps
are a politican's ramp and a waste of public money.
''Boot camps will prove an expensive and embarrassing folly.''
The trust is the latest group to condemn the proposals by the
Government to set up an institution along the lines of American camps
based on the survival training of military personnel during the Second
World War.
Prisons director, Mr Derek Lewis, said last week that details of the
first camp would be announced shortly. He predicted a high degree of
structure and discipline of young offenders.However, the trust report
said: ''Plans for a British boot camp do not seem based on objective
evidence or weight of opinion. Advice from senior Prison Service
officials on the merits of boot camps in the US is against the idea. The
best academic research evaluating American boot camps suggests they do
not work.''
A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said the boot camp was being
looked at as one option for strengthening the regimes for young
offenders.

GUIDANCE will be issued soon for police and social workers involved in
joint investigation of child abuse, Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser
has told Ayrshire MP George Foulkes
The Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley Labour MP had expressed concern
about some press reports of the cases of three Ayrshire families
involved in abuse allegations and criticisms of social workers.
In a written reply, Lord Fraser said: ''I sympathise with your view of
the simplistic and excessive reactions in the press . . . Child
protection is a serious and continuing public responsibility.''
He goes on to say that new guidance is about to be issued for police
and social workers.
''The guidance will deal extensively with interviewing children.
''It has been prepared by a multi-disciplinary working group appointed
by the Secretary of State and the Lord Advocate. We hope that the
guidance will be widely welcomed and help improve the whole process of
investigation in future.''
He told the MP he accepts that child protection poses very difficult
situations for social workers and added that training and appropriate
guidance should enable them to sharpen their skills and judgment in such
cases.
The Government, he added, had already made funds available for
training in this field.

THE man cleared three years ago of murdering the son of Glasgow
''godfather'' Arthur Thompson is to be the subject of a Channel Four
documentary.
Mr Paul Ferris is believed to have given his full co-operation to the
programme.
He has been interviewed by John McVicar, once described as Britain's
most wanted man and now a journalist and broadcaster.
Mr Ferris, who describes himself as a reformed criminal, said the
documentary has given him the opportunity to come to terms with his life
and allowed him to set the record straight.
''I was extremely paranoid after the trial,'' he told The Herald. ''I
am cured now after this filming. It was an extremely healthy thing to
do. I don't worry any more.''
Mr Ferris said he believes he is being demonised in the eyes of the
public.
He said: ''I am bothered about that because my nine-year-old son reads
these things. He sees them on television and he gets a hard time at
school because of it.''
Mr Ferris also believes he will die a violent death.
He said: ''One of the questions I was asked was: 'Do you believe you
will end up on a mortuary slab?'
''I think everybody ends up there one day but my biggest fear is that
I will be put there by the police. That is one of the factors I go into
in detail and I feel better now I have put it on the record.''
Last month, in a trial at the High Court in Glasgow, it was claimed
that Mr Ferris had put a contract out on the life of a senior Glasgow
police officer.
It is one of a number of allegatons raised at the trial which Mr
Ferris claims to refute in the programme.
''There was never any contract taken out on him. There can be no
justification to anyone taking out a contract on the life of a serving
officer. He is doing his job and everybody accepts that.
''If a police officer was to go outwith his capacity, then I'm sure
some people would think that was a different situation. If a police
officer steps over the line, then they would be acting as a criminal and
they should be treated as such.''
A spokesman for Channel Four confirmed the programme had been
commissioned for a series called Chapter and Verse.
He would make no further comment on it, saying it was at a very early
stage and filming had not been completed.

<HEADLINE>Dockyards sell-off talks in difficulty, says union chief</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978485512</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government will make a final decision on the sale of Rosyth and
Devonport dockyards within the next six to eight weeks, Mr Jack Dromey,
TGWU national secretary, claimed yesterday after meeting shop stewards
at Rosyth.
''Negotiations have commenced between the two dockyard companies and
the MoD,'' he said. ''But there is no doubt these negotiations are in
difficulty.
''The taxpayer will get a bad deal, but the MoD will press ahead with
privatisation because Chancellor Clarke needs the money and the Prime
Minister cannot afford another humiliating retreat.
''However, we want two cast-iron guarantees. We will not allow our
members' pension and redundancy rights to be sold down the river and we
want equality of treatment by way of contractual guarantees for Rosyth
and Devonport.
''Devonport gets Trident but Rosyth has only promises of surface ship
work.''
Rosyth workers will lobby the Conservative Party conference in Glasgow
on Friday.
''We also intend to make the threatened betrayal of dockyard workers a
major issue at the Perth and Kinross by-election,'' Mr Dromey said.
''We will ask every candidate to state clearly where they stand and if
they will back the dockyard workers and Scottish interests before
Ministers in London.''
The MoD has agreed to a top-level meeting with trades unions on May
24.
''Senior civil servants have promised us that if we are not satisfied
with their answers to our questions we will meet Ministers within a
fortnight.''
On May 24 Rosyth workers will stage a major lobby of Parliament along
with those of Devonport and union officials will be giving evidence to
the Defence Select Committee on the future of Britain's one million
defence workers.
If elected general secretary of the TGWU on June 23, Mr Dromey gave a
public undertaking that he would continue to retain personal
responsibility for the dockyards.
He discounted reports that the #5000m Trident contract would return to
Rosyth because of structural problems at Devonport. ''The Government
will go to any lengths and expenditure to keep Trident at Devonport,''
he said.
Mr Dromey also claimed the War Graves Commission was under pressure to
cut costs from the Treasury.
''This would lead to less care, less regular maintenance, fewer
flowers, and eventual privatisation,'' he said.
Mr Dromey revealed that 200,000 members of the armed forces and
defence workers had lost their jobs since the Berlin Wall was
dismantled.
''One in five of the million people who depend on defence expenditure
have lost their jobs. These are the biggest job losses since 1945.
''The message to those who helped in the Falkland and Gulf wars is:
'Thanks for your loyalty. Here's your redundancy notice'.''

CROFTERS' leaders have warned that new regulations aimed at stopping
overgrazing of heather moorland by sheep does not address the damage
done by deer.
Acting president of the Scottish Crofters' Union, Mr Alistair MacIver,
has written to Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro complaining
that the new Heather Moorland Scheme fails to recognise the impact of
deer.
The scheme compensates crofters to the tune of #25 for every ewe they
remove from the hill, to reduce grazing pressure.
Mr MacIver writes: ''We would suggest that if sheep are removed from
the hill there is an opportunity for expansion of the deer population as
more grazing becomes available.''
He claims the quota regime limits sheep numbers in the Highlands and
Islands while support mechanisms placed limits on stocking density.
He argues: ''There are no such limits on the deer population, which is
widely recognised to have expanded dramatically over over the last 10
years.
''We would suggest that there is a need to tackle the problem of a
much expanded deer population.''

MOTORISTS and pedestrians in Glasgow city centre yesterday looked on
as a man threatened to jump from the Kingston Bridge.
The 19-year-old took advantage of scaffolding erected around the base
of the bridge, which carries the M8 across the River Clyde, to climb
100ft up to the motorway and after crossing four lanes of traffic
climbed out on to a parapet.
Two police negotiaters were called in and attempted to talk him down
as he perched with his legs dangling over the edge of the bridge
directly above Washington Street on the north side of the river.
Police were forced to close one lane on the bridge and a feeder road
below to traffic while the rescue attempt progressed watched by a crowd
gathered on the Broomielaw.
Two fire engines, one with a hydraulic platform, an ambulance, and a
number of police patrol units were involved in the operation.
The man, until recently a patient at a hospital in Ayr, stayed on the
parapet for around three hours, occasionally shouting, before police
cleared spectators from the area below and the man agreed to climb back
over on to the road at around 3pm.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said late last night that the man had
been a voluntary patient in an Ayr hospital and had now been returned to
the hospital.
''The man was talked off the bridge by force negotiators. They are
specially trained to handle situations like this,'' he said.
The outside lane of the bridge, which carries traffic from the
Clydeside Expressway across the river was closed for around two hours.
''Congestion was minimised as there is no direct access to the motorway
from that lane at the moment,'' the police spokesman added.

A DEFEATED election candidate who lost the contest by a single vote
after four recounts will go to court today in an effort to have the
result declared null and void.
The case, which could make legal history, is being brought by Liberal
Democrat Mrs Pat Miller, who lost the fight for Jedburgh's Southdean
division in elections for the new Borders single-tier council on April
6.
After four recounts, Independent Mr Tom Dobson was declared the winner
-- and then only after returning officer Mr Kenneth Clark had ruled that
two ballot papers in Mrs Miller's favour were invalid because they had
not been franked at the polling station.
If the papers had been declared valid the situation would have been
reversed and Mrs Miller would have been the winner by one vote.
At today's hearing in Edinburgh, brought under the Representation of
the People Act, lawyers for the returning officer and Mrs Miller will
make submissions on the procedure to be followed when the sheriff
principal, Mr Gordon Nicolson QC, hears the case at Jedburgh early next
month.
Mrs Miller has already lodged a four-page petition at the Jedburgh
court on the advice of the Liberal Democrats' own lawyers. The case
could eventually result in a by-election being ordered.
The Liberal Democrats are claiming that although the two ballot papers
were technically invalid, in a case where they are crucial to an
election outcome, they should be accepted in the interests of natural
justice and the democratic process. The party lawyers claim an English
precedent, although the case is unique in Scotland.
In England, the process can include a complete recount in front of a
High Court judge.
Mrs Miller, a mother of three, said yesterday: ''It was galling to
lose by one vote on a technicality and I will be happy to fight a
by-election. The recounts were emotionally exhausting, one of the worst
things I have ever experienced. After the final ruling, I was ready to
lie down and eat the carpet.''
Winning candidate Mr Tom Dobson, who will be in court today, is
unhappy at the prospect of a by-election.
Mr Dobson, a 60-year-old retired oilrig communications officer, said
yesterday: ''If I had lost, I would have gracefully accepted that I was
beaten. Apart from anything else, I could not have afforded to bring the
case. I have heard estimates of it costing anything up to #3000. On top
of that, the public will have to bear the cost of a by-election if last
month's decision is overturned.''
Liberal Democrats are expected to raise funds to help meet Mrs
Miller's costs. A party spokesman said: ''We are in no way impugning the
competence of the returning officer, whose action at the count was
legally right but not sufficient.''
Mr Kenneth Clark said yesterday: ''Mrs Miller has been very courteous
and forbearing in the circumstances. However, I had no legal powers to
make any other decision on the night. The law is quite clear. When a
ballot paper is not franked by the official at the polling station it
cannot be accepted by the returning officer.''
A Liberal Democrat victory at any by-election ultimately ordered by
the sheriff principal would increase the party's strength on the new
Scottish Borders Council to 16.
The council is currently controlled by a mixed bag coalition of 11
Independents, 15 Lib Dems, eight Scottish Nationalists, and two Labour
councillors.
Sitting Councillor Tom Dobson is one of 19 Independents who refused to
take part in the coalition after the election, saying they were opposed
to party politics in local government.

IN spite of the lull in hostilities between those protesting against
the building of the M77 motorway through Glasgow and the contractors,
one war veteran used VE Day as an occasion to stage a one-man protest
over the road.
Mr Walter Morrison, 72, yesterday tipped his old army kitbag full of
chopped wood, the remains of trees felled in the path of the motorway,
outside the closed offices of Strathclyde Regional Council.
The veteran, who spent VE Day with the Royal Scots Fusiliers in the
Far East, said he had defended his country in battle and was now
defending the environment.
Over the last few weeks, protest over the motorway link between
Glasgow city centre and the A77 road to Ayr has died down, leaving the
contactors Wimpey to press on with levelling the site in preparation for
building work.
Wimpey's head of corporate relations, Mr Iain McConnell, said the tree
felling was complete, building work was going to schedule, and cost
targets were being met.
He said security had been scaled down since the height of the protests
a few months ago, when around 300 security staff were employed.
''Obviously we still employ security staff but at greatly reduced
numbers. We need people to protect the site, particularly in the Pollok
area at night, but we always employ security at any site.''
Mr Morrison, a retired printer, said he had lived in Corkerhill in the
city's south side for more than 20 years and been a member of Corkerhill
Community Council for nearly all that time.
Clutching a handful of bluebells, clumps of which he said had been
destroyed by the road builders, he declared: ''It seems to me
particularly sad that while we finally stopped the fascists in Germany,
Italy, and Japan in 1945 from destroying 'Our Dear Green Place', in
1995, between them, Strathclyde's Labour councillors and Wimpey's
chainsaw gangs have done more damage to Corkerhill in a single day than
Nazi bombers did in five years.''
On the other side of the city at the protesters' camp, the so-called
Pollok Free State, the handful of campaigners sitting round a fire
conceded there was little they could do now to halt the motorway.
However, protester Colin MacLeod said the camp would remain on the
site indefinitely as a focus for environmental protest. He said the
campaigners hoped to set up a land fund, a collective, and a community
learning centre.

SOUTH African Peter Francisco was banned from snooker for five years

The move follows a match against Jimmy White in the Embassy World
Snooker Championship on April 15 and 16 at the Crucible in Sheffield.
There had been allegations of heavy betting on a particular score.
However, solicitors acting for the 33-year-old player insisted the
subsequent inquiry by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker
Association had exonerated the player in regard to any match-rigging or
involvement in any betting coup following his 10-2 defeat.
His barrister, Mr Balbir Singh, said Francisco was likely to appeal
through the law courts.
''There appear to be inconsistencies in this matter and that the WPBSA
are able to suspend players simply for playing badly,'' he said.
Mr Singh suggested that the snooker authorities were going to clear
Francisco of any part in ''unusual betting patterns'' prior to the
match. However, in a statement issued by secretary Malcolm Hulley, the
WPBSA made no mention of it.
Instead, they said Francisco, the world No 48, had been found guilty
of breaching rule 1A of the rules of discipline. That rules that he
''had not conducted himself during the match in a manner consistent with
his status as a professional sportsman''.
His suspension is the heaviest punishment imposed on a professional
snooker player.
At the original hearing in Sheffield on April 19, White was cleared of
any involvement.
Mr Singh said his client was stunned: ''He co-operated fully at the
hearing and returned from Cape Town on Sunday to answer all their
questions in full.
''We shall look into all avenues of appeal but we would like to stress
that he has not been involved in match rigging or a betting coup.''

SCOTTISH exports soared in the first three months of this year,
according to the Scottish Council Development and Industry's latest
quarterly export index.
At an estimated #4140m, exports were marginally down on the total
recorded in the final three months of 1994. However, that is the normal
pattern of pre and post-Christmas demand. Compared with the first
quarter of last year, the latest export index was up a very healthy 41%.
The export index was first introduced in 1993, with a value of 100 for
the first three months, representing quarterly exports of #2570m by
value. A year later, it stood at 114.66.
It now stands at 161.16, having peaked at 166.95 in the last quarter
of 1994. That quarter-on-quarter fall of 3.5% compares with a fall of
9.6% between the last quarter of 1993 and the first of 1994.
Mr Ian Armstrong, SCDI's business information manager, said: ''That
the fall in the index was so modest (this time) suggests that exporters
have continued the robust performance of 1994 into the current year.
Scotland exported more than #4000m worth of manufactured goods for the
second quarter in succession.''
The authors are now projecting a further rise in exports in the
current quarter to an index of 168.65, representing exports of #4330m.
The computer industry and the food and drink sectors showed some
fall-off in demand, reflecting the seasonal nature of demand for items
like computers and whisky.
However, electronics exports showed strong growth overall, as did the
metal manufacturing sector. SCDI says that, despite pressure on costs,
exporters are still not passing these on fully to customers.
''Hence, while an element of the large growth in the export figures is
due to price changes, the main reason is due to improved order books,''
its commentary claims.
The index, supported by Scottish Enterprise, tracks the actual
performance of a selected panel of exporters, representing 50% of total
exports. The index is based on actual results and orders and is not an
opinion survey.

THEY turned up in their hundreds of thousands and wallowed in a sea of
sentiment, nostalgia, and patriotism that was as unashamed as it was
extraordinary.
In reality, the Queen Mother and her two daughters, taking up much the
same positions they had adopted on the Buckingham Palace balcony 50
years ago, were among the few in attendance yesterday who had any vivid
memory of what it was like then.
However, the people of London were told that here was the opportunity
to recreate the true atmosphere of VE Day, and recreate it they did:
upwards of 300,000 people joined the party.
The most remarkable moment was not of the noise, but of silence. At a
blast, at 8.38pm, the vast crowd fell quiet. For two minutes, the
sacrifice of millions was remembered. Across the country parties in
pubs, village halls, and greens fell silent. The crowd at the Blackburn
v Newcastle match joined the tribute.
Then it was back on with the party as the Queen lit the first of a
chain of 2000 beacons across the nation.
It was a scene, to a lesser extent, which was being repeated
throughout Europe. However, amidst the celebrations of the past, the
harsh reality of the present intruded.
In a speech, Mr Major deliberately missed out Russia from a roll call
of Allies who have helped win lasting peace in Europe. He changed his
prepared text in Berlin in what was seen as a move to avoid any
suggestion the Government tacitly supports President Yeltsin's military
offensive in Chechnya.
Mr Major's prepared speech before VIPs paid tribute to Churchill, de
Gaulle, Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy, Gorbachev, Adenauer and Kohl.
When the moment arrived, he missed out Gorbachev. There was speculation
he felt unable to mention the ex-president without reference to Mr
Yeltsin: the fighting in Chechnya made that politically and
diplomatically impossible.
For his part, Mr Yeltsin, at a Kremlin ceremony, warned the West
against any moves that could isolate Moscow.
Earlier, tens of thousands of Parisians jeered and booed startled
world leaders when police held them back from the main French ceremony
and a military parade.
In London, however, the mood was all of joy. Of course, they climbed
on lampposts, just as they did 50 years ago. Naturally, they waved their
union flags. Some turned up in period costume, with aviator's helmets
and replica tin hats.
Most of all they cheered at the slightest excuse and sang their hearts
out to wartime melodies.
It was a day for the people. And just as was the case 50 years ago,
the royal family, remote as they might have seemed through the scandals
of recent years, were very much part of the people.
No-one more so than the Queen Mother. She was centre stage on the
balcony. On her right was the Queen and on her left Princess Margaret,
just as they were 50 years ago. The masses reckoned the missing two,
King George VI and Winston Churchill, were there in spirit.
The community singing was being led by Dame Vera Lynn, Sir Harry
Secombe, and Cliff Richard. Sir Harry, introduced as Neddy Goon, told
them he loved performing in front of small audiences. Dame Vera told
them to sing the roof off . . . ''if we had a roof''.
The Queen Mother was first to join in the chorus of the wartime songs
but was soon joined by the Queen and Princess Margaret.
Later, the Prince of Wales surprised an audience at the Coliseum when
he movingly recited a war poem, Say Not The Struggle Nought Availeth, by
Arthur Hugh Clough as he launched the gala concert, Live for Peace.
First, however, there had to be more memories. A Swordfish, the first
in a series of Second World War British and US aircraft taking part in a
fly-past, buzzed over the palace, just as the crowd was singing '' . . .
bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover''.
The royal party on the balcony applauded every plane. The Queen Mother
waved towards the pilots. It was the last night of the Proms writ large
as the band struck up Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory: VE Day
had been recreated 50 years on.

THE Nuclear Installations Inspectorate is confident that the
relicensing of Britain's nuclear power stations can be completed in time
for the Government to privatise the industry before the next General
Election.
In a White Paper which could be published as early as today, the
Government is expected to propose that the public-sector company
Scottish Nuclear should be merged with its English counterpart, Nuclear
Electric, and sold off next year.
The inspectorate has told the Government that the process of
relicensing the eight power stations for new ownership should take 12 to
14 months.
As reported in The Herald yesterday, Labour's trade and industry
spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said it is ''extremely important that they
should have laid down these timescale parameters at this early stage''
and that ''if these are adhered to, and probably expanded upon'',
privatisation prior to the election would be impossible.
Environmental groups will be examining the published proposals closely
to see if there is a case for challenging the Government in the courts.
Such legal moves could delay the relicensing process.
Last year, the start of operations at the Thorp reprocessing plant at
Sellafield, Cumbria, was held up for several months while Greenpeace
sought a judicial review on safety grounds.
A spokesman for the inspectorate said yesterday: ''In theory, legal
action could upset the timetable but not, we hope, by very much. There
is always a window of opportunity for someone to challenge moves like
this on legal grounds but we have been working hard to prepare for the
licensing of any new applications and we are fairly confident we have
got it about right.
''Even if there is a challenge which has to be heard in court, it
should not take more than a few weeks.''
It had been know for years that the Government was reviewing the
industry and favoured privatisation and that the inspectorate had been
preparing for the relicensing process. Last year, the inspectorate had
published guidance for applicants and had also indicated what the
Government should bear in mind.
The spokesman added that the 12 to 14-month timetable included a
three-month period for consultation with public bodies such as local
authorities.
The London office of environmental campaigners Friends of the Earth is
understood to be preparing to scrutinise the proposals with a view to a
possible challenge in the courts. It could not be contacted yesterday
for comment.
At the Edinburgh HQ of Friends of the Earth Scotland, energy
campaigner Graham Stein said: ''Once the details are announced, I
imagine we would be working together with our colleagues in London on
this. We would look at what opportunities we had to further our
arguments and that could mean going to the courts, which would probably
be at UK level.''
He added: ''We are opposed to the privatisation because of the need
for public accountability and public control of the industry. Our policy
is for a phase-out of nuclear power and that is obviously easier to do
if it is a publicly-owned company.''

RAIL union boss Mr Jimmy Knapp has urged the Rail Regulator to act to
prevent British Rail from running down its Wembley maintenance depot,
which he insists would have a major impact on the quality of service on
the West Coast main line between London and Glasgow.
The Rail, Maritime, and Transport union general secretary has the
support of the Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee, which
believes that moves to close the depot also undermine attempts to
preserve threatened Motorail and sleeper services.
Ironically, there is evidence that the Wembley depot's problems are
partly as a result of new working practices and improved efficiency at
Glasgow's Polmadie depot, where management adopted private sector-style
changes two years ago.
Last month, Polmadie won the contract for refurbishment of 14
30-year-old carriages used by InterCity Cross Country, and it also
recently took over the servicing contract for ScotRail's sleepers. The
150-year-old Glasgow depot is expected to win a lot more work from train
operating units under the break-up of British Rail.
Despite assurances last week from the Rail Regulator, Mr John Swift,
that BR has made no application to close the Wembley maintenance depot,
The Herald has a copy of an Inter-City West Coast press statement
detailing how ICWC had ''approached the Office of the Rail Regulator to
initiate proposals to close the passenger rolling stock maintenance
depot at Wembley in North-west London.
''The decision follows a study of present and future maintenance
capacity and utilisation for ICWC which also has depots at
Wolverhampton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow. These have spare
capacity to perform work displaced from Wembley,'' it states clearly.
The RMT maintains that, although BR may not yet have begun the formal
closure application with the regulator as laid down in the Railways Act,
1993, it has already embarked on ''back door'' methods of letting its
closure plans be known and then inviting the 250 employees to apply for
redundancy.
Wembley currently tests and repairs brakes, examines and repairs
underframes, lightening and air conditioning, wheel changes, fire
alarms, door locks, and windscreen replacement.
Almost as important, closure would mean that the only facility for
flushing out blocked toilets, or emptying toilet tanks on the London to
Glasgow run would be at Glasgow.
Trains or sections of trains would have to run empty to Glasgow if air
conditioning was not working, toilets were locked out of use or
defective brakes or wheels could not be rectified, argues the RMT, which
accuses ICWC of trying to save money in advance of rail privatisation.
''We urge the rail regulator to ensure that the ICWC desists from
running down staff and insists on retaining a full maintenance service
at Wembley for the benefit of passengers between London and Glasgow,''
Mr Knapp said yesterday.
The CRUCC, meanwhile, says that BR's decision to seek to close the
10-year-old Wembley depot would, if implemented, make it impracticable
to restore threatened Motorail and sleeper services and would therefore
''be a frustration of the process of consultation''.

THE chairman of the charity Edinburgh Direct Aid, who was hit by a
sniper's bullet in Sarajevo last week, was back at work yesterday.
Mr Denis Rutovitz, 66, said his chest wound had to be dressed daily
but he would be joining another aid convoy in June, despite renewed
attacks by Serbs on the Bosnian capital.
Mr Rutovitz said the charity's aid convoy had left Split last night
before returning to Edinburgh next week.
He said the trucks would leave parcels for Sarajevo medical centres
and schools in storage at Mostar until fighting had died down.
The charity lost one of its trucks in the sniper attack last week. Mr
Rutovitz said yesterday that any aid convoys approaching Sarajevo faced
machine gun, mortar, and anti-tank fire.

ARMY hero Wayne Mills today becomes the first soldier to win Britain's
new gallantry award, second only to the Victoria Cross, for outstanding
courage in Bosnia.
As the nation recalled the bravery and fortitude of the wartime
generation, the 31-year-old corporal showed similar spirit and
resourcefulness in a potentially fatal firefight with Serb forces.
Corporal Mills, a member of the lst Battalion The Duke of Wellington's
Regiment, is awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, a distinctive
silver cross with a colourful ribbon.
General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN peacekeeping troops in
Bosnia until January, is also honoured, with the Distinguished Service
Order, for his ''inspirational leadership and personal courage''.
Corporal Mills, who is married and comes from Sheffield, was in charge
of a six-man patrol moving Bosnian Serb forces from the two-mile no-
man's-land around the Gorazde safe area in April last year.
His patrol was supported by just eight troops on the left flank as
they moved forward a mile into Serb territory. Suddenly, large numbers
of Serb forces opened fire and advanced to within 100 metres. The patrol
returned fire immediately with SA80 rifles and killed two of the Serbs,
Corporal Mills accounting for one.
As more fire rained down on the patrol from the right flank, he
organised a lengthy withdrawal down a steep, wooded gulley using ''fire
and manoeuvre'' techniques. He put his life in danger by acting as the
rear guard to protect the withdrawing troops.
''He put down very accurate and deliberate fire to delay the advancing
Serbs with a very real danger of being cut off from his comrades,'' the
official citation said.
However, the danger was far from over: at the bottom of the gulley,
the patrol found a clearing and Corporal Mills realised they would be
caught before reaching the other side.
''He dropped back, created a one-man ambush and waited for the Serbs
to reappear,'' said the citation. ''A group emerged from the trees; Cpl
Mills killed the leading Serb with a burst of automatic fire and the
rest ran away.''
The patrol made it back to base in Gorazde without casualties.
The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross was unveiled in February for acts of
tremendous courage by men and women of all ranks across all three
Services.
The new award is in line with the Prime Minister's insistence that the
distinction between awards for officers and ''other ranks'' should be
scrapped.
General Rose was hailed as a hero in Bosnia last year after restoring
near-normal life in the capital Sarajevo.
''General Rose will be best remembered as the man who restored the
situation in Sarajevo which had deteriorated into a virtual siege,'' the
official citation said.

WILL CARLING was reinstated as captain of England last night, two days
after his dismissal for calling the Rugby Union Committee ''old farts''
in a TV programme.
The U-turn took place after Carling had a meeting at Twickenham with
the man who sacked him, RFU president Dennis Easby.
They then drove to Marlow Rugby Club, Buckinghamshire, where it was
announced to the other England players that Carling would be captaining
the team at the World Cup in South Africa later this month. The decision
came after 29-year-old Carling, captain for seven years, apologised for
the remarks he made in a Channel Four documentary.
Mr Easby, 70, said: ''He gave me all the assurances I wanted. I regret
that all this happened and that I had to take the action I did.''
He clearly laid down massive restrictions on Carling's verbal conduct
while in South Africa and any word out of place would see a re-enactment
of the original decision.
Carling said: ''I regret what I said.''
He added: ''I bitterly regret the position I put Dennis Easby in. I
have the utmost respect for him. It is a situation I should not have
caused. I hope this is now dead. I thought my dream had gone but I am
delighted to have got it back.''
A statement issued by the Rugby Union had made clear that all 25
members of England's squad had indicated their support for Carling.
After last night's decision, Brian Moore, the pack leader, said: ''This
is the news we wanted.''
The RU statement began: ''Will Carling wishes to apologise to every
member of the committee of the RFU for his inappropriate and
gratuitously offensive comment at the end of a recent TV programme.''
It said after the World Cup, the position would be reviewed. ''This is
subject to certain conditions which will remain confidential and the
provision of a written undertaking by Carling that he will not say or
imply during this period anything which serves to denigrate or bring
into disrepute the game or the RFU.''
While Mr Easby and officials have climbed down in a major way, they
have also forced Carling into a strong apology.
England team manager Jack Rowell said the players' solidarity over the
fiasco may even have strengthened England's chances in the World Cup.
''I am pleased we have come together like this.''
Mr Easby concluded by saying that relationships with the players would
be improved by this regrettable episode. ''But the general public will
still think that we are old farts.''
